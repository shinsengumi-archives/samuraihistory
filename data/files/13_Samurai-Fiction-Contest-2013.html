9th Annual Samurai Archives Samurai Fiction Contest - 2013


Eighth Annual Samurai Fiction Contest, 2013

The parameters for the 9th annual Samurai Fiction contest are covered on this page. The story is to be historical fiction, but the genre is WIDE OPEN. Be it Horror, Sci-fi, Suspense, it&#39;s all up to you how you want to handle it.

 

Requirements:

This is to be a piece of fiction writing taking place within an unspecified period in Japanese history. As mentioned above, the genre is wide open

Parameters:

The story is required to be more than 1,000 words, with a 5,000 word targeted limit - overages are acceptable if necessary, but please don&#39;t overdo it. It can be done in the first person, or the third person, and must be a complete short story, not an excerpt from a larger story. Please list your chosen genre on your entry. Although the particular genre will not affect judging, all entrants will be judged on how well they utilize thier chosen genre.

Disqualifications: Stories with numerous blatant misspellings or poor grammar may be immediately disqualified at the judges discretion. Please spellcheck and proofread your stories.

There is no fee to enter the samurai fiction contest. The contest is completely free and open to all. The entries will be published on Samurai Archives.com, with the winner featured. Also, this year we&#39;ll present the top stories on the Samurai Archives Podcast. Writers will retain all rights to their stories. A maximum of two stories per entrant are allowed.

Please note that any stories that are disqualified for bad grammar or spelling will not be published on the website.


Submission Information:

Submissions are to be sent via email to samuraipodcast /at/ gmail in a WORD .Doc format, .TXT file or HTML. At the top of the first page, please include your full name, your Yahoo ID, or Samurai Archives Citadel ID (whichever is applicable, and if you have one of either) your email address, as well as the genre the story falls under, and the title of your story. You will receive a confirmation email that your submission has been received. A maximum of two stories per author are acceptable.

Judging and Winning the contest:

Submissions will be judged by a panel of Yahoo Group and/or Samurai Archives Citadel community members who are not submitting stories. The judges will not be told who the authors of each respective submision are until after the judging has closed, to avoid any swaying of the judges. The recipient of the submissions (The Samurai Archives webmaster) will not be a judge, and will only moderate the proceedings, to keep entries anonymous. The winning story will be featured on the Samurai Archives site as the winner of the 2013 Samurai Fiction contest, and the top stories will be read on the S-A podcast. All stories will be placed in the &#39;Fan Fiction&#39; section of the Samurai Archives as well. The winner will be announced at the Yahoo Group and the Samurai Archives Citadel and on Facebook/Twitter at the end of judging in December.

So, what do I win?

The winner will win the recent book The Way of Judo, care of Shambala publication, and $25 cash. Depending on number of entries, the runner up may also get a prize to be determined.
