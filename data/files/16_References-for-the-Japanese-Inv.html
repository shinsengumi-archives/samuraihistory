Up to this point the outgunned Korean defenders had suffered defeat after defeat and been forced to abandon all of Korea’s major cities and fortresses and seek refuge along the Chinese border. They requested help from Ming China, Korea’s tributary overlords and even though a small Ming expeditionary force was defeated in the summer of 1592, the Ming promised to send more aid. This arrived in early 1593 and together with Korean troops and volunteers, the Ming overwhelmed the Japanese with superior firepower and recovered the city of Pyongyang, Korea’s auxiliary capital. Within months Seoul was also recovered and the Japanese never regained their early momentum. OSPREY BOOKS:	“Fighting Ships of the Far East (2), Japan and Korea AD 612-1639”, by Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing Ltd, 2003.	Plate D shows Korean artillerymen in 1592.	Plate E shows Korean artillerymen, archers, and commander 1592	“Siege Weapons of the Far East (2), AD 960-1644”, by Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing Ltd, 2002.	Plate B shows wheeled rocket launchers, Korean artillerymen and commanding officer.	Plate F shows mobile mortar, Korean artillerymen and commanding officer.	“War in Japan 1467-1615”, by Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing	<DT><A HREF="http://login.yahoo.com/config/login?logout=1&.intl=us&.src=ym&.partner=&.done=http%3a//login.yahoo.com/config/login%3f.intl=us%26.partner=%26.last=%26.src=ym%26.done=http%253a//edit.yahoo.com/config/mail%253f.intl=us" ADD_DATE="1104097237" LAST_VISIT="1104097238" OBJECT_TYPE="LINK">Yahoo!</A>	<DT><A HREF="file:///Macintosh%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Online%20Downloads%20copy/MESSAGE.HTML" LAST_VISIT="1104092885" ADD	“The Book of Corrections, Reflections on the National Crisis During the Japanese Invasion of Korea, 1592-1598”, by Yu Songnyong (translated by Choi Byonghyon), Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, California, 2002.	“In the Field as a Kitten - In the Castle as a Tiger”, by Rob Morgan, published in various issues of the Arquebusier.	Part 1: “The Signal Gun?
