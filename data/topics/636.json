I live in<br/>\n&gt; Dallas, Texas and work for The Crow Collection of Asian Art.  We are having<br/>\n&gt; an Armor exhibition opening on March 21st.<br/>\n&gt; I work in the Education Department for the museum.  As a result I am helping<br/>\n&gt; to develop a lesson plan for teachers and students and also putting together<br/>\n&gt; background information for the tour guides.  I do have some information, but<br/>\n&gt; am very interested in learning more.  One of the perks of my job is getting<br/>\n&gt; to see some of the exhibits before they go on display.  I am blown away by<br/>\n&gt; the armor and masks. This stuff is sooo amazing and cool.  I can&#39;t wait to<br/>\n&gt; see the public&#39;s reaction.  The reason I am writing this is to hopefully get<br/>\n&gt; information from those with more knowledge on this subject matter.  In<br/>\n&gt; addition to the Samurai Archives on the web, I was wondering if anyone might<br/>\n&gt; have suggestions for more information (i.e. websites, books, movies, etc).<br/>\n&gt; I am also looking for pertinent information that might be especially<br/>\n&gt; interesting to children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks so much!  I look forward to being a part of this group!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Warm regards,<br/>\n&gt; Zehra Ahmad<br/>\n&gt; Outreach Coordinator<br/>\n&gt; The Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection Of Asian Art<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can start by taking a look at my website:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/katchu/0.Home.html\">http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/katchu/0.Home.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s anything I can do to help, let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",
