None are wearing two swords, symbol of the Bushi class, <br/>\nthey are wearing brightly patterned expensive looking Hakama and <br/>\nkimono, like a daimyo might wear, yet none of them seem to possess the <br/>\ndignity one would expect of persons of that class. Men and women are <br/>\nmixed together but without anything to indicate their status in the <br/>\ngroup or with whom they might be associated (women were more like <br/>\npossessions in those days so one would expect a female to stand <br/>\nrespectfully behind her father or husband while he was seated or in <br/>\nsome other way indicate her place in the group). A woman of good <br/>\nbreeding would never expose that much skin or any hint of her <br/>\nunderclothes in so public a display as a photograph.<br/>\n\tTo me at least this is not a photograph of samurai but one of many <br/>\nposed photos taken by photographers like Beato and others who were in <br/>\nJapan just after the fall of the Shogun...<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sep 12, 2004, at 11:19 AM, dcress wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;  Can anyone help me identify the persons in the URL below.
