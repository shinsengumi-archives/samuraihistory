Richard Kirkham B.Sc&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tutor2000@...\">tutor2000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Glad you said &quot;free&quot; ebook. Ebooks are my chosen way of publishing for several reasons which I won&#39;t bother with, but a good ebook is no different than a good hard copy book<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true, it&#39;s how it is edited and reviewed that makes the <br/>\ndifference, not the electrons or paper that make up the substance. One <br/>\nadvantage of books from reputable academic publishers is they usually <br/>\ntry to keep the real garbage from getting out since it can damage their <br/>\nname. They use real reviewers that check the book out before its <br/>\npublished as well as having a professional editor take a crack at it. <br/>\nWith self published books, its a crap shoot if you get anything decent <br/>\nor not. I have some great books on various craft subjects that are self <br/>\npublished but I&#39;ve also seen some incredible vanity press dribble as <br/>\nwell. Also even the best authors benefit from at least a little editing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have access to a college library, many of them now allow you to <br/>\nread academic journals online, even if its not one that they subscribe <br/>\nto. In my case the City of San Jose and Cal State San Jose library are a <br/>\ncombined library so I can access the databases at the library. I&#39;m not a <br/>\nstudent, otherwise I could access them from home!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn California and parts of Nevada, LINK+ gets you almost overnight <br/>\naccess to many library&#39;s collections.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving checked out other states library sites, many other states have <br/>\nsimilar setups. If your serious, it makes a nice day trip to hit your <br/>\nsomewhat local large library!<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
