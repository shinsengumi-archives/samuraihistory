            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-828442985\">Strange as it seems (and as much as I hate to believe it), it looks like Hayes really was in Shogun. I pulled out my 25 year old copies of old magazines to find the story written by him. It wasn&#39;t in Kick magazine (more on that little gem later) but in Fighting Stars magazine. There are quite a few photos, including 3 of Hayes in costume with other cast members (Hiromatsu, Chamberlain, Rhys-Davies). Hayes said he not only played the Erasmus crewman but also doubled for Rhys-Davies (he has the costume on in one of the photos) when he fell off the Japanese galley. The photos looked legit, so I set off to watch the Shogun DVD. Through the miracle of freeze frame and zoom I was able to pick out Hayes. He&#39;s the second crewman to exit the quarters after Blackthorne sends the helmsman to roust the crew after the reef is spotted (based on a comparison with photos of Hayes from The Secret Fighting Arts Of The Ninja which a misguided but well meaning friend had given me, it&#39;s either him or his good twin). He&#39;s also the first crew member to fall off the rigging. Hayes is harder to spot in the scenes where Rodrigues falls off the galley, but it appears to be him at times as well. Who&#39;d have thought it?<br/>\nOf course, it&#39;s vintage Hayes-he keeps prattling on about how his performance was aided by his total mastery of the forbidden Ninja arts. In one passage that&#39;s a real howler, Hayes states that he wants to star in a ninja film so he can strip away all the misconceptions and falsehoods raised about the ninja!  <br/>\nNow, as to the aforementioned Kick magazine-their special Shogun edition had a article on Ninjitsu that is the best two page summary of ninja misinformation I&#39;ve ever seen. Every sterotype you&#39;ve ever heard was in here down to the black stealth outfit. I wish I had a scanner so I could post it-it&#39;s a laugh riot.</div>",
