It still requires a significant amount of <br/>\nhand-formatting, putting the &#39;--------------&#39;s between each comment, typing each little &#39;-&#39; <br/>\nin one by one several times while going through the comments.   I have <br/>\nserious doubts that any of the Outlook users really have this sort of time and/or <br/>\npatience for this sort of custom-formatting.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I dunno, just a thought.

If users (using ANY email format) can be encouraged to snip out the <br/>\ncomments that are not directly relevant, then I don&#39;t see what the huge deal is about <br/>\ndoing a bit of scrolling down to see the relevant comments that a poster is <br/>\nreplying to. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany people use Outlook, with their reply format on many other lists that I <br/>\nparticipate in.  Snipping out old comments that aren&#39;t relevant does frequently <br/>\ncome up as an issue on these lists. But the &quot;top-posting&quot; thing has never <br/>\ncome up as an issue on any of these lists other than this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for me, I&#39;m now at home and using AOL. So no top-posting here.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNina</div>",

I do snip out the parts of previous postings that aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;  relevant,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; which I&#39;ve noticed some others don&#39;t do. <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I have Outlook, and it&#39;s difficult, but if it&#39;s really so very, <br/>\n&gt;  very<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; important, then I&#39;ll try to remember to cut-and-paste and move the <br/>\n&gt;  original<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; posting to the top and my comments to the bottom. <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Though I will NOT be able to put my comments below each section <br/>\n&gt;  that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; responding to. Outlook isn&#39;t set up to allow people to do that, so <br/>\n&gt;  I would<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; have to format it by hand.  Which might be convenient for you but <br/>\n&gt;  is quite<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; time-consuming and inconvenient to those who have to do this<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; hand-formatting.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Nina<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  It wasn&#39;t aimed at you directly, just a general comment - and I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;  not in attack mode :-D And I use outlook express, and I can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;  imagine it is that much different from Outlook, so I am at a loss as <br/>\n&gt;  to what exactly the problem is.  When I hit &#39;reply&#39; in outlook <br/>\n&gt;  express, the original text is there with all the &gt;&gt;&gt; and then I can <br/>\n&gt;  scroll to wherever I want, click just below the section of text I <br/>\n&gt;  want to respond to, hit enter a few times, and voila, I have space <br/>\n&gt;  to commment. I guess you are saying that in Outlook you can&#39;t touch <br/>\n&gt;  the text you are replying to, and have to type at the top?  Sounds <br/>\n&gt;  like a poor excuse for an email system (sorry to the Bill Gates fans <br/>\n&gt;  out there) It isn&#39;t a HUGE deal or anything so don&#39;t lose any sleep <br/>\n&gt;  over it, but it does keep the format standardized and is easier to <br/>\n&gt;  follow.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks. Not sure what version of Outlook I have at work, but you can&#39;t put <br/>\nthe little &gt;&gt;&#39;s in automatically in this version; I would have to do each line <br/>\nby hand and that is a huge pain which I simply don&#39;t have time for.  It&#39;s set <br/>\nup for business and the way it is set up, that&#39;s standard business practice. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you can pardon me, when I&#39;m posting from work, using their version of <br/>\nOutlook, I&#39;m going to go back to the top-posting. I will always try and edit <br/>\nout all of the comments I am commenting on, other than the relevant parts, so <br/>\nthere won&#39;t be that much to scroll down and read. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when I&#39;m home, using AOL, AOL will format it for me, so I can <br/>\nsprinkle in my responses between the &gt;&#39;s and &gt;&gt;&#39;s that AOL automatically puts in. <br/>\nHowever, I am unable to access my AOL account from work. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Nina</div>",
