My professor didn&#39;t like them (and <br/>\nthe Bungo manual is pretty short) and made his own materials to teach <br/>\nthe class.  I haven&#39;t seen the Shirane book, so I can&#39;t speak to it, <br/>\nbut the other has only limited utility.  Get yourself a good classical <br/>\nJapanese dictionary (be advised that the iwanami one lists verbs by the <br/>\nrenyokei) and just start reading texts.  I would suggest that you read <br/>\nthe introductory matter and the back matter (explains verbs <br/>\nconjugations and the joshi and jodoushi) of whichever dictionary you <br/>\nbuy thoroughly.  Also, it will probably help you to start with texts <br/>\nthat have translations already so that you can check your progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon</div>",
