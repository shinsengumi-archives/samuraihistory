Bryant&#39;s books<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 21 Feb 2002 20:54:55 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Not to attack the sacred cow, but Turnbull can definately not be accused <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;being an acedemic, or a &#39;true&#39; historian.  Many of his books are filled<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with small errors and innaccuracies that he very obviously took verbatim<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from Papinot - although he NEVER mentions Papinot in his sources...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Looking at his books, his information, and his sources together, one has <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wonder if he can even read Japanese at all...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of <br/>\n&gt;Inabayama<br/>\n&gt; &gt;took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in Japanese,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;including a few he lists in his bibliography state it happened in 1567.  <br/>\n&gt;So<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you may be thinking, &#39;what&#39;s two or three years?&#39;  Well, what if I told <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;You could write a treatise on just the errors and uncited Papinot sources<br/>\n&gt; &gt;alone.  Not to mention a picture listed as an &#39;authors representation&#39; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;something that actually looks suspiciously like a tracing of a picture in <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rekishi gunzo book. (Dont have his book or the Gunzo book on hand right <br/>\n&gt;now<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to cite which one)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Guess because he&#39;s the only game in town he thinks he doesn&#39;t have to <br/>\n&gt;work<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at it anymore...?  I&#39;ve seen him mentioned as Stephen &quot;buy my books&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Turnbull in some post before, and I can see why.  Just take a look at his<br/>\n&gt; &gt;website.  You can&#39;t help but get the impression scholarship takes a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;definate backseat to profit.  guess I can&#39;t really blame the guy, though.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gotta put food on the table somehow.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyway, I&#39;d rather read &#39;dry&#39; histories if they are more accurate than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&#39;popular&#39; histories, although I&#39;d prefer to read an accurate popular<br/>\n&gt; &gt;history! (like A.J. Bryant&#39;s stuff!  At least you get the impression that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;he has a real interest in the subject, and can actually read japanese, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;actually puts in the research!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Oh well, just a rant on my part, and I could very well be totally wrong.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;MarshMan6423 is writing to u!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>MarshMan6423 is writing to u!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>",
