            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-719490015\">Hmm.  I must admit the way you at least worded your message did raise <br/>\nmany thoughts and ideas.  It certainly is an umm.. interesting <br/>\ncomcept you have there.  Far be it from me though to tell you how to <br/>\nlive your life.  However, I think the book LIVING THE MARTIAL WAY: A <br/>\nMANUAL FOR THE WAY A MODERN WARRIOR SHOULD THINK by Forrest Morgan <br/>\n(intended for martial artists, but aspects can be adapted by non-<br/>\nmartial artists) will be able to help you in fuguring out how to <br/>\nthink and act like a warrior in the modern times.  Remember do not <br/>\nfollow things you read blindly because a book says that it was how <br/>\nthe samurai acted.  In my personal opinion you should be more <br/>\nconcrened about living a life of honor rather then a samurai since it <br/>\nwould be (to say the least) nearly impossible unless you were to find <br/>\nsome unusual people in this world.  Read on samurai philosophy, and <br/>\nthen use your own mind to figure out what it means.  As was suggested <br/>\nyou might also want to read on Confucianism and Buddhism.  For <br/>\nBuddhism, look into mainly the Zen, Tendai, and Shingon schools <br/>\nbecause they had the biggest impact on the samurai.  And look into <br/>\nNeo-Confucianism since it evetually took the place of original <br/>\nConfucianism in East Asia.</div>",
