Plenty of samurai did<br/>\nnot shave the forehead.

Shaving the<br/>\nforelocks was a mark of an adult samurai, but not<br/>\nshaving it didn&#39;t mean the person wasn&#39;t samurai, and<br/>\nin the Edo period the lower classes also shaved their<br/>\nforelocks, but arranged the hair differently (check<br/>\nout old episodes of Abarenbou Shogun to see this). <br/>\nHaving it shaved didn&#39;t mean you were a retainer of<br/>\nLord X--it wasn;t like wearing a unit patch on your<br/>\nshoulder. <br/>\n<br/>\nTurnbull&#39;s &#39;Samurai Sourcebook&#39; I believe has a<br/>\nsection on hairstyles with a good explanation. <br/>\n<br/>\nNice to see another tanker on the board--I was a 12A<br/>\nuntil they made me go MI.
