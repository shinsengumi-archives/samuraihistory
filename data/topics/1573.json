The <br/>\nByakko Tai were members of an irregular unit made up of boys 13-17 <br/>\ncreated for the defense of Aizu han. In 1868 when the forces of the <br/>\nTokugawa Shogun and those supporting his cause were pushed out of <br/>\nEdo, many fled north and gathered around the banner of Matsudaira <br/>\nKatamori,the lord of Aizu. As the Impperial armies of Satsuma, Choshu <br/>\nand others pushed north one by one the northern han opposed to them <br/>\nsuccumbed.<br/>\n\tThe Byakko Tai were sent to the outer line of defense on the <br/>\nfar side of iimoriyama hill, on the outskirts of Wakamatsu, to <br/>\nrelieve/reinforce regular troops fighting there. They were too little <br/>\ntoo late, suffering many losses they were put in retreat. When they <br/>\nreached the crest of the hill they could see Wakamatsu-jo burning. <br/>\nThinking all was lost, their homes, their mothers and sisters, they <br/>\nresolved to die like men. 19 young boys either stabbed each other in <br/>\nthe throat or committed seppuku on the spot.<br/>\n\tWe know their story because one of their number survived into <br/>\nold age, though he moved far from Aizu as an adult he asked to be <br/>\nburied among his friends as his dying wish. So there are 20 Names on <br/>\nthe memorial.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
