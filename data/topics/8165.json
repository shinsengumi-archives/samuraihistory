As I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nfor last two years this group is populated with a lot<br/>\nof people that have a very good knwoledge about Japan<br/>\nand about its history, so I throw you a question that<br/>\nmay be some of you can answer. Recently I&#39;ve listened<br/>\nabout the compund japanese term Yamato Damashii, I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried to find some information about but haven&#39;t<br/>\nsucceed too much, I think that is somtehing about<br/>\njapanese patriotic, ethics, feelings, ...<br/>\n<br/>\n¿could you explain briefly what does Yamato Damashii<br/>\nmean?<br/>\n<br/>\n¿can you recomend me some reading or book about this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance and happy 2006 to everybody<br/>\n<br/>\nMiguel A.
