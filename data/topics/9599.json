On 21st July at the Excel Centre in London&#39;s Docklands, there will be a Japan exposition. My understanding is that it will cater for all things Japanese, including modern and cultural. Certainly there is Manga, Anime etc and I will be manning a stand for To-ken Society of GB. This will feature swords and armour, mostly from my own collection so if you come, please say hello.<br/>\nDetails may be found on www.To-ken.com in the Members section.<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nClive sinclaire<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
