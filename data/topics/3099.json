            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-626203589\">Hi Rob,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been able to find some information on the<br/>\nSatsuma region and the Shimazu clan. Pretty much the<br/>\ntwo are very much intertwined and your ancestors were<br/>\nonce retainers to the Shimazu. The Kyushu Samurai was<br/>\na very fearsome, brave and honorable warrior. Notable<br/>\nexamples being the Shimazu of Satsuma, the Ryuzoji and<br/>\nNabeshima of Hizen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Satsuma samurai proved themselves in battles<br/>\nacross Kyushu, Korea and Sekigahara. At Sekigahara the<br/>\nSatsuma samurai were on the Toyotomi side. Though<br/>\ndefeated their Daimyo, Shimazu Yoshihiro ordered a<br/>\ncharge straight through the enemy center. Breaking<br/>\nthrough the Satsuma Samurai were able to retreat and<br/>\nmake it back to Kyushu. Observing this the Tokugawa<br/>\ngenerals were dumbfounded. Tokugawa Ieyasu just shook<br/>\nhis head and said &quot;only a Satsuma samurai would<br/>\nretreat by attacking and that they may have lost the<br/>\nbattle but not their courage&quot;. This would later be<br/>\nknown as Shimazu no nokiguchi or Shimazu style<br/>\nretreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many examples of their courge and tenacity<br/>\nin the face of ovewhelming odds. Being defeated only<br/>\nby Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1587 and Tokugawa Ieyasu in<br/>\n1600. Each time the Satsuma samurai impressed their<br/>\nenemies greatly with their courage and honor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggested research: Shimazu Takahisa, Shimazu<br/>\nYoshihisa, Shimazu Yoshihiro, and Shimazu Iehisa<br/>\n<br/>\nalso notable vassal families: Iriki-in, Togo, Niiro,<br/>\nIjuin, Hongo, Kiire, Hirada, Machida, Uwai,<br/>\nTamegashima, Kawakami, Kimotsuki, Honda<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is alot more info out there and I have only<br/>\nscratched the surface. I hope I was of some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck in your research and please share anything<br/>\nyou find. I&#39;ll be more than happy to share what I<br/>\ndiscover.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I wouldn&#39;t mind sharing my Grandfathers story.<br/>\nBut not today.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I&#39;ve babbled enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake <br/>\n--- Rob &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zarathu_stra@...\">zarathu_stra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Actually, I&#39;d like to know a bit about Satsuma<br/>\n&gt; region as well for personal reasons. My name is<br/>\n&gt; Robert Omura. My grandfather was Kenji Omura who<br/>\n&gt; came from the Kagoshima region of Japan and came to<br/>\n&gt; Canada in the early 20th C. He was the eldest son of<br/>\n&gt; a samurai family. I never knew my grandfather as he<br/>\n&gt; died in an internment camp in British Columbia.<br/>\n&gt; Before WWII my grandfather held title to property<br/>\n&gt; from Vancouver to Montreal, but these were<br/>\n&gt; confiscated and sold to Veterans Affairs during the<br/>\n&gt; war. My father, who was born in Canada, inherited<br/>\n&gt; his estate years ago, and was contacted in the late<br/>\n&gt; 1970&#39;s by his cousin there and, because he had never<br/>\n&gt; been to Japan, he transferred title to the lands to<br/>\n&gt; his cousin. These were in the Kagoshima area. I<br/>\n&gt; understand that he was adopted to the Watabe family<br/>\n&gt; as a child, but changed his name back to Omura. I am<br/>\n&gt; told that my great-grandfather was asked to move to<br/>\n&gt; the capital to run the Japanese tax system -- late<br/>\n&gt; Meiji period, but refused. I also<br/>\n&gt;  understand that the records are largely complete in<br/>\n&gt; Kagoshima, having been largely spared by the war.<br/>\n&gt; Any hints or suggestions on tracking more<br/>\n&gt; information would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; jacob gerhard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madbearscave@...\">madbearscave@...</a>&gt; wrote:Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Jake.
