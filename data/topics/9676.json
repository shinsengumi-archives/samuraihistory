This answers your first two questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne was BORN into it. No one was &quot;recruited&quot; as a samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as to three: of COURSE. They were the warrior class, of course  <br/>\nthey did.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo write an essay, you really should READ some material rather than  <br/>\njust asking questions. Let the material you read produce the questions  <br/>\nas they answer others. Just about any cursory reading of ANYTHING on  <br/>\nsamurai (for example, the wikipedia article) would have had the  <br/>\nanswers to these questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",
