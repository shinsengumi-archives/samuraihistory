            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-747563238\">Hi there<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a hard question but I will try to help you a little. <br/>\nThe Tsutsui were established in the province of Yamato this province <br/>\nis traditionally where Nara was the old capital of Heian period. It <br/>\nwas close by to the capital and thus was important to protect the <br/>\nShogun and the emperor. The Ashikaga were shoguns in control during <br/>\nthe early Sengoku period, they retained control until 1573 when <br/>\nNobunaga marched into Kyoto. It is a complicated area, as the Miyoshi <br/>\nand Matsunaga clans + Hatakeyama, Hosokawa, Rokkaku all were <br/>\ncompeting for land and power. The Tsuitsui had to resist all these <br/>\nefforts, but in 1568 when Nobunaga entered the Kinai region he allied <br/>\nwith him, and became daimyou of the Yamato territory. As regards to <br/>\nhis retainers, their is not much info as to many but Shima Sakon is <br/>\nwell known a retainer of Tsutsui Junkei&#39;s later became one of <br/>\nIshida&#39;s lieutenants for Sekigahara.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I knew more, but can&#39;t think of anymore, does this help?<br/>\nI think you have to realise it won&#39;t be easy finding info about this <br/>\nfamily unless you speak Japanese or find a good source book.</div>",
