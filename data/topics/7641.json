            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-800301019\">Romantic Edoites went both ways<br/>\n<br/>\nAs in other historical periods, Japanese in the Edo era (1601-1868) <br/>\nengaged in sex. (We can verify this assertion, needless to say, from <br/>\nevidence of their continued existence.) Such activities were, as <br/>\nhistorian Mikito Ujiie writes in Shincho 45 (September), both <br/>\nprocreative and recreational.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the tale of a certain 31-year-old hatamoto (vassal to the <br/>\nshogun) named Hitoyanagi Naosato, who, a high official named Mizuno <br/>\nTamenaga recorded, was stripped of his samurai status for having <br/>\nprocured the services of a prostitute in the Yoshiwara brothel <br/>\nquarter. The story, which broke in the eleventh lunar month of 1780, <br/>\nwas a bit more complicated than that: It seems Naosato&#39;s previous <br/>\nwife had given him a son, named Ushinosuke, who was 10 years old. <br/>\nThe new wife, whose name and age went unrecorded in this account, <br/>\nfelt little affection for her stepson and abused him severely <br/>\n(another crime). What&#39;s more, when Naosato was absent from Edo on <br/>\nassignment to the provinces, his wife would invite her cronies into <br/>\nhis compound, turning their residence into an illegal gambling den <br/>\n(yet another crime). She also engaged in trysts with other samurai, <br/>\nleading the official recorder Mizuno to accord her the sobriquet <br/>\nof &quot;inpu&quot; (slut).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wife, it was alleged, had formerly worked as a freelance <br/>\nprostitute (as opposed to those who labored under indentured <br/>\nservitude), and through connivance had somehow managed to get <br/>\nherself adopted into a samurai family. Armed with this new identity, <br/>\nshe then wed Naosato, and as a noble lady free from suspicion was <br/>\nable to launder prostitutes&#39; earnings. These funds were used to <br/>\nbuild up her husband&#39;s status to hatamoto.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was the parental abuse meted out to Ushinosuke that led to <br/>\nher downfall. A servant named Rokubei took pity on the boy and <br/>\nspilled all to Naosato. When news of the wife&#39;s misdeeds reached <br/>\nTokugawa Sadanobu --- the Shogun&#39;s cousin and chief advisor --- she <br/>\nwas brought before the Edo magistrate and publicly reprimanded. <br/>\nRather than beg for mercy, however, she turned to toward the judge, <br/>\nbatted her eyelashes furiously and said, in a voice dripping with <br/>\nfeminine guile, &quot;Oh your honor, it must be the first time you&#39;ve <br/>\never encountered a woman like me. . .&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nInfuriated by this brazen, unrepentant attitude, the judge sentenced <br/>\nher to exile on one of the Izu Islands.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the fourth lunar month of 1842, Inaba Masamori, the lord of Yodo, <br/>\nin Yamashiro province (present-day southeastern Kyoto) a lord named <br/>\nwas stripped of his title as High Commissioner of Temples and <br/>\nShrines. Three months later, he was divested of his domain.<br/>\n<br/>\nSix years earlier, his wife&#39;s infidelity had come to light when she <br/>\nwas found murdered in an Osaka storehouse. The investigation led to <br/>\na host of other sexual and financial indiscretions and a nationwide <br/>\nscandal ensued, in which Masamori became known among Japan&#39;s nobles <br/>\nas &quot;Baka-dono&quot; (Lord Fool).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most notorious scandals of the pre-modern era involved <br/>\nTokugawa Nariaki, lord of the powerful Mito domain, and a lovely <br/>\nlassie from Kyoto named Karahashi.<br/>\n<br/>\nNariaki was a compulsive womanizer and it wasn&#39;t long before <br/>\nKarahashi found herself with child. Although he was obliged to make <br/>\nperiodic stays in Edo, he began finding all sorts of pretexts to <br/>\nremain in Mito, giving the Shogunal authorities such excuses as <br/>\nneeding to build up the coastal defenses, conduct military maneuvers <br/>\nor make long-overdue reforms of the province&#39;s administrative <br/>\noffices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem was that Nariaki&#39;s official wife, the daughter of a <br/>\npowerful lord, realized that his philandering was endangering the <br/>\nfamily&#39;s position and began to take matters into her own hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nSensing the walls closing in, around 1843 Karahashi pleaded illness <br/>\nand fled to Kyoto. In addition to being stripped of his title, <br/>\nNariaki was punished by being forced to make the rounds of temples <br/>\nin his province and melt down their bells to produce cannonballs.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps part of the problem was that Japanese of the ruling samurai <br/>\nclass were just getting to know women again; up to 1700 or so, <br/>\nromance commonly took the form of &quot;shudo&quot; (pederasty --- written <br/>\nwith characters meaning &quot;the way of the masses&quot;). This was no doubt <br/>\na legacy of the period of 16th century civil war, when samurai were <br/>\nin constant battle and had little time for family life. While in <br/>\ntheir military encampments older men and adolescent youth would pair <br/>\noff for romantic trysts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after the Tokugawa dynasty consolidated its power, the samurai <br/>\nbecame more domesticated and from the late 1600s, authorities in <br/>\nsome provinces began banning the practice of shudo (also referred to <br/>\nas &quot;nanshoku&quot;) due to duels being fought between rivals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the reason, historical sources noted a pronounced shift in <br/>\nsamurai interests away from partners of the same sex toward women <br/>\nfrom around 1700 AD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs evidence of this, he cites a story of a love triangle that <br/>\nappeared in the 16th year of Genroku (1703), in which a gay blade <br/>\ncheated on his young male lover by cavorting with a prostitute. He <br/>\nfound the experience of passion with a woman so pleasurable he <br/>\npromptly jilted his colleague, setting up house with the daughter of <br/>\na respectable family, who subsequently gave birth to a child. The <br/>\nyoung bushi (warrior) became the odd man out and, to add insult to <br/>\ninjury lost his retainer status. Out on the street, he found himself <br/>\na ronin (masterless samurai) left to fend for himself.
