I am convinced I read or was <br/>\ntold that Rousseau was an influence on Ryoma. However in checking my <br/>\nreferences I can only find that Nakae Chomin was a student of French <br/>\nin Nagasaki at the same time Ryoma was there. At the time Nakae was <br/>\nstudying under Tosa sponsorship. He is famous for his liberal <br/>\npolitics in the Meiji period and his translations of French Code of <br/>\nLaw and &quot;The Social Contract&quot;. Clearly the democratic ideal inspired <br/>\nhim, but how early?  Thus there was likely no Japanese translation <br/>\navailable to Ryoma and he certainly didn&#39;t read it in the original <br/>\nlanguage. I will keep looking but may have shot down my own theory...<br/>\n\tI believe he would have been a positive influence on the new <br/>\nage. I imagine him growing fat and corrupt at the head of a <br/>\nMitsubishi type shipping concern and his own political party or <br/>\nperhaps leading elements of the new navy against the forces of Okubo <br/>\nin concert with Saigo and the forces of Satsuma or maybe staking a <br/>\nclaim as a world famous rogue after circumnavigating the globe with <br/>\nfrequent stops in the capitols and parlors of the worlds great <br/>\nNations.<br/>\n\ttom<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1035873814\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; &lt;Tom et al<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would suggest either the Aizu confrontation at Wakamatsu or the Satsuma rebellion of 1877. The Satsuma army were samurai, and Saigo Takamori is often called the last samurai. Both of these battles have a heroic, noble failure, last stand, feel about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, Takasugi Shinsaku was quite a high ranking Choushuu samurai and seems to have been very conscious of his own rank. It doesn&#39;t seem accurate to see him as a democratic figure. Like most of the Choushuu Meiji heroes, many of whom rose from being commanders of the shotai (samurai-farmer militia) he was a brilliant opportunist. Ito and Inoue were quite low-rank: Inoue&#39;s upbringing as described in Choushuu no Tenka was that of a farming-samurai family. Many samurai did not want to join the militia as the new methods of rifle drill and so on were considered too boring. Farmers on the other hand found this less boring than the hardship of their lives and possibly also saw it as a way to enter the samurai class. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be interested to know if any of the Meiji leaders were interested in western-style democratic ideas.</div>",
