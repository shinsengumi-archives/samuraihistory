A tokugawa <br/>\nstyle despot who can make laws and enforce them may be the &quot;best&quot; <br/>\nform of government, but I hope he/she is an enlightened one!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some random thoughts. Anyone want to discuss further?<br/>\n<br/>\nGillian<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
