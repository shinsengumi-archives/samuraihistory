The<br/>\nBakufu&#39;s point in outlawing junshi was that the<br/>\ndaimyo&#39;s heir needed experienced counselors, etc, to<br/>\nmaintain the government of the han, and if they all<br/>\nkilled themselves upon the death of the daimyo, there<br/>\nwould be no governmental continuity and the han would<br/>\nsuffer. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t make sense to outlaw the act of punishment<br/>\n (i.e. seppuku) the bakufu used to punish it&#39;s own<br/>\nretainers. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Might it be that in 1868 - after the formal close of<br/>\n&gt; the Bakufu - the <br/>\n&gt; laws established by the Bakufu were now obsolete and<br/>\n&gt; seppuku was now b<br/>\n&gt; ack in play, or at least the status was now unclear?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, junshi seemed to have been &#39;legal&#39;, though the<br/>\nwhole counry was shocked when Gen. Nogi and his wife<br/>\ncommitted junshi in 1910 following the death of<br/>\nMeiji-Tenno.
