The Court <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Out of all the confusion of bakumatsu politics I find the Court&#39;s role the hardest to grasp. If anyone knows of sources on this period I&#39;d love to hear from them. There were factions in the court, such as that led by Sanjo Sanetomi who supported the &#39;loyalist&#39; cause, but what was Sanjo&#39;s education?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Same question re: Shishi. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Choshu shishi were not usually ronin. They were still operating within the rule of their han. Choshu like all the great han maintained yashiki in Kyoto and Edo where young men were sent to learn sword fighting, other military subjects, Dutch learning and foreign languages. At one stage the Choshu Edo yashiki, the Yubikan was run by Katsura, later Kido Koin, a pupil of Yoshida Shoin, and a high ranking official in the han.<br/>\n<br/>\nHan education I think is important here. Choshu&#39;s Meirinkan in Hagi is famous: as well as all the martial arts, strategy, tactics and so on, classical learning, confucianism, and ethics were taught here. Inoue Kaoru was a typical pupil: he also attended Shoin&#39;s school at the same time. His family upbringing was extremely frugal and hardworking, yet he was of sufficiently high rank to be employed in the Mori family&#39;s service, was sent to Edo to learn rangaku and then to England to study English, was a close friend of Takasugi Shinsaku and so became a shotai leader, could speak English and so like Ito (another close friend) became involved in the negotiations after the war with the 4 Countries. Yet he was never a ronin, everything he did was with the permission of his han, though against the bakufu&#39;s rulings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the shishi came from a dynamic social culture, not the stagnation that &quot;sakoku&quot; is often depicted as. They rose in the same way young people of ability do anywhere, through a mixture of their own talents, their education and friendships, the circumstances of the time and luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nHan politics, as Tom says, swung from the conservatives (in Choshu the zokuronha) who supported the bakufu and were in favour of &#39;open country&#39; (ironically -they are far closer to what we would consider &#39;liberal&#39; now) and the &#39;loyalists&#39; (seigiha) who supported the emperor and wanted to expel foreigners. The Mori daimyo, Takachika, vacillated between the two. He was not a strong character (with the exception of Hisamitsu, few of the daimyo were at this stage: Ernest Satow in A Diplomat in Japan blames their education and uprbinging), but the feeling in Choshu was that if action were to be taken against the bakufu the house of Mori had to be involved (still lingering resentment towards the Tokugawa after Sekigahara!), but not to the extent that the Mori should be destroyed. Far more important in han politics, including protection and mentorship of the shishi, were the top bureaucrats like Sufu Masanosuke.<br/>\n<br/>\nTakachika retired after the restoration and handed leadership of the family over to his son. he died in the 4th year of Meiji. The Mori residence at Hofu was built for the family later in the Meiji period, but I think it illustrates the decline of the daimyo families very well. (In an earlier post I said Mori was called sansei - in fact I&#39;ve looked at my notes now and the phrase was souseikou, because this was all he ever aid in meetings: sorry about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust one thing to add, am trying to keep this short. Ii Naosuke&#39;s policies during the Ansei purges when many bakufu opponents were executed aroused massive resentment among the han bushi. If Ii had lived his strength of character and ruthlessness might have saved the bakufu, his assassination by Mito men in 1860 is probably one of the many turning points in this period.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s complex - one of the things I did not like about The Last Samura was it turned this dynamic, fascinating, complex, sophisticated society into a tribal village!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>g<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.c1tracking.com/l.asp?cid=5511\">http://www.c1tracking.com/l.asp?cid=5511</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.click.yahoo.com/mOAaAA/3exGAA/qnsNAA/BcOolB/TM\">http://us.click.yahoo.com/mOAaAA/3exGAA/qnsNAA/BcOolB/TM</a><br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

It has 2 parts. <br/>\n&gt; First, I have seen some famous statue photos of Masashige Kusunoki. <br/>\n&gt; It is a huge bronze statue of the man, powerfully posed, on a huge<br/>\n&gt; horse.  It seems to capture a strength that not many other statues of<br/>\n&gt; this type reveal.  I&#39;d like to see it myself but I don&#39;t know where<br/>\n&gt; it is at.  I&#39;m living in Tokyo, and I know it&#39;s somewhere around<br/>\n&gt; here.  Anyone know exactly where it is?<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it&#39;s just outside the Imperial Palace garden - if I remember <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Second, does anyone who has visited the statue have other pictures of<br/>\n&gt; it?  I&#39;d like to get a small collection of photos so that I can make<br/>\n&gt; a painting.  The staue would be a reference for the horse mainly but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to capture the strength of the samurai in it as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll send you a couple in private - I have a collection of pix <br/>\ndownloaded from the net, I am sure I have a few of thst statue. By the <br/>\nway, I don&#39;t remember when (probably Taisho period or so...) but that <br/>\nvery statue was on a Japanese currency bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nBye!!<br/>\ncepo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

I&#39;ll to keep it short as well.<br/>\n\tIn 1853 the American intrusion forced the Bakufu to call on all it&#39;s <br/>\nresources for an answer to the &quot;foreign question.&quot; One of the things <br/>\nthey chose to do was to petition the Court and the Tozama Daimyo, <br/>\nhoping that some brilliant solution or at least some consensus might <br/>\nresult. Instead it was a message to the entire country that the Bakufu <br/>\nwas crippled and powerless. The Court took a decisive albeit short <br/>\nsighted stand against foreign intercourse, which much of the country <br/>\nsupported, starting a shift of power from Edo to Kyoto.<br/>\n\tPrior to the 1850&#39;s Mito was a hotbed of Kokugaku, &quot;Japanese History&quot;, <br/>\nand where in their scheme of things greater loyalty was owed the <br/>\nEmperor than the Shogun, even though they were a house in line for the <br/>\nShogunate. In fact it was Mito Komon who &quot;discovered&quot; Kusunoki <br/>\nMasashige, located his grave and made him a national hero.<br/>\n\tIn Choshu Yoshida Shoin was preaching an anti-foreign and pro-Court <br/>\nmessage that took hold among the young men of his Han. In Han all over <br/>\nthe Japan of the time politically active young men had two choices, <br/>\nstay within their han and advocate for reform or leave and head to <br/>\nKyoto or Edo and try their hand there. In some cases out of deference <br/>\nto their lords they became ronin, or they had no other choice if they <br/>\nwere to travel to the capitol and take part in the action.<br/>\n\tSome Daimyo were unable or unwilling to act, others maintained a level <br/>\nof &quot;plausible deniability&quot; by fostering opposing factions within their <br/>\nhan. Thus if their advocates failed they could disown them, or swing <br/>\nthe whole han over to the successful policy. Therefore the Lord could <br/>\nbe seen to be acting thru his more radical subordinates, while assuring <br/>\nhis old guard that nothing would change. Of course this was a policy <br/>\nthat put extraordinary power in the hands of mid-level samurai. Beyond <br/>\nthat I&#39;ll be spoiling the story so, enjoy...<br/>\n-t</div>",

The Court seems to have had quite a large<br/>\ninfluence, especially with pro-Joi sentiment, and<br/>\nclearly gives orders to the Bakufu in 1862/1863<br/>\nregarding expelling the foreigners in Japan. How/When<br/>\ndid the Court gain the power to give orders to the<br/>\nBakufu? I realize that the power was always there, so<br/>\nto speak, but the court hadn&#39;t done anything political<br/>\nsince Go-Daigo and the Nambokucho. Where did this<br/>\nCourt resurgence come from?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most of it came when the Bakufu asked the court what do when Perry<br/>\ncame. It kind of threw the ball to the court and allowed certain court<br/>\nnobles and certain anti-bakufu Daimyo (namely Mito han) to start asserting<br/>\ncourt prerogative. This came on the heels of several decades of Kokugaku<br/>\nwhere several scholars in the late Tokugawa (Mabuchi, Norinaga,etc) were<br/>\npressing for the return of power to the throne or a least to themselves as<br/>\nrepresentatives of the throne.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;2. Same question re: Shishi. Totman talks about the<br/>\nShishi and the fact that many came from Choshuu and<br/>\nMito. Why all of a sudden were ronin all over the<br/>\nplace, and particularly from these two places? Did<br/>\nMori Yoshichika have a problem governing his han<br/>\n(Nagato/Choshuu) that necessitated letting go of<br/>\nsamurai? I&#39;m particularly confused about this.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of this had to do with the economic conditions of the time. The Tempo<br/>\nyears saw a lot of budget tightening in the hans and a lot of lower samurai<br/>\nwere set free. It also came as a result of many lower samurai releasing<br/>\nthemselves from the restrictive hans out of frustration that they couldn&#39;t<br/>\nadvance. Sakamoto Ryoma was a perfect example of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;3. I know I probably just haven&#39;t gotten to it yet,<br/>\nbut so far (I&#39;m in 1864) the main players are bakufu<br/>\nofficials, Tozama daimyo like Shimazu Hisamitsu and<br/>\nMori, and the Court nobles. Where do these people<br/>\ndisappear to, and how come when we get to the actual<br/>\nrestoration the main players are people like Saigo<br/>\nTakamori (a retainer of the Shimazu, if I&#39;m correct)<br/>\nand Sakamoto Ryoma and so forth? Where do the daimyo<br/>\ndisappear to? I understand the bakufu officials--of<br/>\ncourse they get defeated or pushed aside or whatever.<br/>\nBut if, for instance, Saigo Takamori is a retainer of<br/>\nShimazu Hisamitsu, where is the break that he no<br/>\nlonger is a retainer and is directly working<br/>\ntowards/for Meiji restoration? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course they were active at this time. Conrads book is told mainly from<br/>\nthe bakufu perspective so it looks like they aren&#39;t there but they are. The<br/>\nbakumatsu period had many actors working at the same time all over Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I know it&#39;s a lot, thanks for your patience. I&#39;m just<br/>\nfrustrated right now--NHK is a 10 min walk from my<br/>\nhouse, yet I can&#39;t seem to get it on my TV! No<br/>\nShinsengumi for me, sadly!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGee too bad. So close and yet so far. Its on every Sunday night at 8<br/>\nrepeating next Saturday at 1:05. Its also on BS at 10:00. I&#39;m taping every<br/>\nepisode.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilliam</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1719169323\">All--<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m reading Conrad Totman&#39;s &quot;The Collapse of the<br/>\nTokugawa Bakufu, 1862-1868&quot; and so far it&#39;s pretty<br/>\nilluminating about the end of the Bakufu. As it picks<br/>\nup the story in 1862, I&#39;m a little fuzzy on some<br/>\nbackground information that I was hoping someone here<br/>\ncould help me with. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. The Court seems to have had quite a large<br/>\ninfluence, especially with pro-Joi sentiment, and<br/>\nclearly gives orders to the Bakufu in 1862/1863<br/>\nregarding expelling the foreigners in Japan. How/When<br/>\ndid the Court gain the power to give orders to the<br/>\nBakufu? I realize that the power was always there, so<br/>\nto speak, but the court hadn&#39;t done anything political<br/>\nsince Go-Daigo and the Nambokucho. Where did this<br/>\nCourt resurgence come from?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Same question re: Shishi. Totman talks about the<br/>\nShishi and the fact that many came from Choshuu and<br/>\nMito. Why all of a sudden were ronin all over the<br/>\nplace, and particularly from these two places? Did<br/>\nMori Yoshichika have a problem governing his han<br/>\n(Nagato/Choshuu) that necessitated letting go of<br/>\nsamurai? I&#39;m particularly confused about this. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. I know I probably just haven&#39;t gotten to it yet,<br/>\nbut so far (I&#39;m in 1864) the main players are bakufu<br/>\nofficials, Tozama daimyo like Shimazu Hisamitsu and<br/>\nMori, and the Court nobles. Where do these people<br/>\ndisappear to, and how come when we get to the actual<br/>\nrestoration the main players are people like Saigo<br/>\nTakamori (a retainer of the Shimazu, if I&#39;m correct)<br/>\nand Sakamoto Ryoma and so forth? Where do the daimyo<br/>\ndisappear to? I understand the bakufu officials--of<br/>\ncourse they get defeated or pushed aside or whatever.<br/>\nBut if, for instance, Saigo Takamori is a retainer of<br/>\nShimazu Hisamitsu, where is the break that he no<br/>\nlonger is a retainer and is directly working<br/>\ntowards/for Meiji restoration? <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s a lot, thanks for your patience. I&#39;m just<br/>\nfrustrated right now--NHK is a 10 min walk from my<br/>\nhouse, yet I can&#39;t seem to get it on my TV! No<br/>\nShinsengumi for me, sadly!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool.

I live in Yoyogi. The<br/>\nstatue is right next to the Imperial Palace in the<br/>\nAkasaka area. I don&#39;t have my guidebook handy right<br/>\nnow (at work) to point out the exact subway stop, but<br/>\nI was there about 2 weeks ago with a military tour<br/>\ngroup--we went there and to the Boeicho headquarters<br/>\nat Ichigaya (the Japanese Pentagon). If you follow the<br/>\ndirections to get to the Palace, it&#39;s right there next<br/>\nto the bathroom/omiyage store/restaurant. Pretty cool<br/>\nstatue, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Second, does anyone who has visited the statue have<br/>\n&gt; other pictures of <br/>\n&gt; it?  I&#39;d like to get a small collection of photos so<br/>\n&gt; that I can make <br/>\n&gt; a painting.  The staue would be a reference for the<br/>\n&gt; horse mainly but <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to capture the strength of the samurai in<br/>\n&gt; it as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No pics in hand right now, they are all with my stuff<br/>\nyet to be shipped from the US. But as I said, if<br/>\nyou&#39;re in Tokyo go yourself and take as many pics as<br/>\nyou want!

By the <br/>\nway, I don&#39;t remember when (probably Taisho period or so...) but that <br/>\nvery statue was on a Japanese currency bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nBye!!<br/>\ncepo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
