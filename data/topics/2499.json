I decided one day I wanted to pursue the sword, but my old sensei wasnt teaching any more. He worked at the Army Surplus store I frequent. So at night, I would take my sword there to the store and he would show me forms and katas and such. I havent studied very much. Hence why in one previous email I said &quot;my very limited training&quot;. On a side note, Im working my way thru some books on the Eishin Ryu until I can find a sensei to start taking classes. <br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n--------- Original Message ---------<br/>\n<br/>\nDATE: Wed, 10 Dec 2003 19:26:12<br/>\nFrom: &quot;M.

The pictures of tachi that I&#39;ve seen have a cord or string that makes the sword dangle from the waist. That makes it lower and more natural to draw with edge down. The katana is usually worn stuck into a sash with the handle pointing up at a slight angle. This would make it easier to be drawn with the edge up. All the samurai movies as well as the old engravings and artwork I&#39;ve seen have the edge up on katanas, edge down with tachis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samurai-listowner@...\">samurai-listowner@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 08, 2003 11:44 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: TACHI<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve drawn a katana less than 100 times in my life and that was years ago, so I&#39;m <br/>\n  lost on the &#39;blade up / blade down&#39; conversation -- I am picturing a katana or <br/>\n  whichever type of sword you choose on your left side, basically parallel to the <br/>\n  ground, with the handle protruding out in front of you (the way I was taught to <br/>\n  wear it).

My appologies <br/>\nfor any miscommunication.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Richardson,<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is possible to draw the blade in a battou type action and not cut.  <br/>\nDefensive battou techniques, such as intetcepting cuts or angled parrys, <br/>\ncome into play quite often in Iaido.  As a general rule of thumb, according <br/>\nto my Iaido sensei, if you are doing a single hand technique, especially one <br/>\nfrom a draw, it is Iai.  Once the second hand touches the tsuka (handle) is <br/>\nbecomes kenjutsu.  Which separates schools like Kukishin Ryu from schools <br/>\nlike Muso Shinden Ryu.<br/>\n  For offensive battou techniques that do not involve a downward cut the <br/>\nturning of the saya (sheath) is not done until the very last possible <br/>\nmoment.  Partly to keep the side of the blade from being scratched up from <br/>\nany dirt inside the saya (sheath) and also to keep the ha (cutting edge) <br/>\nfrom splitting the saya.<br/>\n  I hope that this came off more as a response and not as an arguement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt Williams<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNeed a shot of Hank Williams or Patsy Cline?

Its involvement in the transision between<br/>\nkatana and Tachi i am not sure of.<br/>\n<br/>\nwe are also aware that in the early the days the<br/>\nsamurai were men of horse and the bow, this then with<br/>\ntime and change in the way battles were fought had the<br/>\nsamuari also go to fighting on foot, theref ore the<br/>\nbow was reduced in status and corps of archers<br/>\nappeared be it samurai or ashigaru. The Yari (spear)<br/>\nthen came into favour as the primary wepaon of choice<br/>\non the battle field. Of course when the fighting got<br/>\nhand to hand the yari was of no use and then the sowrd<br/>\ncame into play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my martial arts training I do a lot of sword and in<br/>\nmy dojo we are currently doing Yari. I also own a suit<br/>\nof armour which I train in occasionally. here are some<br/>\npoints I discovered when i first wore the armour.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe tachi is fine but to draw downwards when in arm<br/>\nyou have to bend a bit and the draw is slow. therefore<br/>\nturning the sword cutting edge up the draw was faster<br/>\nand the bending of the body  removed.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe tachi when moving about a lot and especially when<br/>\nrunning bangs up and down against you constantly. This<br/>\nwas annoying and you had to hold it if you wanted to<br/>\nkeep control of it<br/>\n<br/>\nA katana is nice and tight to the body, much easier to<br/>\ndraw. <br/>\n<br/>\ntachi work just fine two handed for those hwo have<br/>\nnever handled one.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Dave Jackson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontonut@...\">nihontonut@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nPerhaps the tachi was worn edge down so as to make<br/>\nspace for the bowstring to be drawn and released?<br/>\nJust a thought I had, but I would think that a large<br/>\nkatana tsuka would get in the way especially when<br/>\nshooting to your left,<br/>\nbut then again I could be wrong.

It developed from straight Chinese and Korean models imported <br/>\nfrom the continent. All of which were fighting weapons.<br/>\n\tThere is debate about the use of the tachi, I fall in the camp that <br/>\nfeels it took on its unique shape to meet the rigors of mounted combat. <br/>\nIf we examine the small points of these swords I think it is clear they <br/>\nwere not used much for thrusting. Rather they were for slashing from <br/>\nhorseback at armours made primarily of heavy silk. At the time the bow <br/>\nwas the premier weapon and the sword was a side arm resorted to after <br/>\nall arrows had been exhausted.<br/>\n\tWe imagine it to have been developed in the tenth century(or perhaps <br/>\nearlier) and by the 1100&#39;s was in use by the bushi class all over <br/>\nJapan. After the shock of the Mongol invasions, points became stouter <br/>\naustensibly because thrusting techniques became more prevalent. Then <br/>\nthe whole sword took on grand proportions. Not long after the katana <br/>\ncame a long but it was in the mid to late Muromachi that it became the <br/>\nsidearm of choice. The tachi continued to be worn by cavalry and in the <br/>\nAzuchi-Momoyama we see fighting generals carrying tachi made famous in <br/>\nthe days of Yoritomo.<br/>\n\tFor example Uesugi Kenshin and Akechi Mitsuhide were known to favor <br/>\nBizen Nagamitsu, considered by many to be the top smith from that part <br/>\nof the country known as &quot;the sword capitol&quot; of Japan. Edo period <br/>\nshoguns wore tachi for ceremonial and to this day we see them worn by <br/>\nenthusiasts of Yabusame, which is itself the kind of training a <br/>\nKamakura samurai would pursue...<br/>\n-t</div>",
