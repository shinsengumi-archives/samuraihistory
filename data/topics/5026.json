Thanks!<br/>\nI&#39;m in the midst of researching, and would like to get my facts <br/>\nright:<br/>\nFrom what I understand, the nagamaki blade may be as long and as <br/>\nshaped as a<br/>\nkatana&#39;s. the instances I have found in books and on the web <br/>\ndescribe the<br/>\nnagamaki pole shorter than the naginata&#39;s, and sometimes equals the <br/>\nlength of<br/>\nthe nagamaki blade on the other end.<br/>\nIs this true, or was there an instance of a katana blade on a <br/>\nnaginata pole?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nRami <br/>\n&quot;</div>",
