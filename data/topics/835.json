            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-277893418\">For me the two best places to visit is Mt. Hiei, site of the Enryaku-<br/>\nji monastery, and the Bishamon temple in Yamashina, Kyoto (a 20 or so <br/>\nminute walk from Yamashina station).  <br/>\nMt. Hiei is well worth it just to see not only how huge the whole <br/>\ncomplex is, but to marvel at how in the world Nobunaga could have <br/>\never gathered enough forces to surround and burn such a huge place.<br/>\nAs for Bishamon, for me it has a more authentic look and feel than <br/>\nalmost any other temples I&#39;ve been to (and I&#39;ve been to MANY) - it <br/>\nserved as rest stops for many Daimyo, including Hideyoshi and <br/>\nTokugawa.  It is still quite isolated, and doesn&#39;t get much tourist <br/>\ntraffic, which makes it even better, and my grandmother-in-law lives <br/>\ndown a path a few minutes walk away from it, so I&#39;ve been there quite <br/>\na few times. It is one of the temples I never get tired of walking <br/>\naround it.  The 5 or 600 yen entry fee is actually reasonable when <br/>\ncompared to the average. <br/>\nOsaka castle is also well worth the trip for the museum inside - just <br/>\npretend that it isn&#39;t a cement reconstruction, and you&#39;ll be fine.<br/>\nDaigo-ji in kyoto is also worth a trip to see the site of Hideyoshi&#39;s <br/>\nfinal cherry blossom viewing ceremony, although according to one of <br/>\nthe monks, it what is there now was completed after hideyoshi&#39;s <br/>\ndeath.  It was in the process of being redone while he was alive. <br/>\nIf you were going to Kyushu, I&#39;d recommend going to Omura castle in <br/>\nNagasaki, and to the remains of the castle in Saiki, Oita (I think is <br/>\ntsuru-yama), and the associated temple there.  The temple was <br/>\noriginally on the mountain where the castle remains now stand, but in <br/>\naround 1604 or so the lord had the temple taken off the mountain and <br/>\nrelocated, because he wanted his castle up there.  Soon after it was <br/>\nfinished, it was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.  They <br/>\ntook it as a bad omen for moving the shrine, and never rebuilt the <br/>\ncastle.  It is in a good location, you can see over the entire city.  <br/>\nThere is even the remains of a WWII AA gun emplacement on the castle <br/>\ngrounds.</div>",
