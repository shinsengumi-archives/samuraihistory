ALthough it could have <br/>\nhappened during the landings made by international forces when they <br/>\ntook the Satsuma batteries and destroyed them in August 1863. This <br/>\nwas in retribution for firing on foreign vessels. It might also have <br/>\noccurred when foreign representatives were in Kagoshima to witness <br/>\nthe seppuku of the man responsible for the attack on Richardson <br/>\n(Namamugi-jiken). However this would be highly unlikely.<br/>\n\tOne event I would like to research more is the incident at <br/>\nSakai, where 9 French sailors were massacred by Tosa troops en route <br/>\nto attack Edo. BUT because this was late in the game and &quot;the Regime <br/>\nchange&quot; followed shortly thereafter the European powers took little <br/>\nnotice of the deaths. I&#39;ve not been able to find much on this in <br/>\nprint but have always wanted to learn more.(The European governments <br/>\nof the time were very much involved in the events of the Restoration, <br/>\nthough it suited all concerned to let it play out as a &quot;civil&quot; war.)<br/>\n\tI have to agree with Tony and Hiraizumi Sensei, Saigo as <br/>\nwarmonger was the story put out by Okubos&#39; propaganda machine. There <br/>\nare very good reasons for his wanting to put himself at the center of <br/>\nthe Korean question. If you agree with Yates&#39; ideas they are easily <br/>\nexplainable. The saddest part is that inspite of the Okubo <br/>\ngovernments public protestations to the contrary they followed the <br/>\nvery same course of action proposed by Saigo just five years after <br/>\nthe Satsuma rebellion was put down.<br/>\n\tTom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-3284559\">Hi Laura<br/>\n <br/>\nThe only thing i can think of in regards to this matter, is that &quot;Shishi&quot; was believed to be an imaginary &quot;lion-like looking dog&quot;, placed at temple entrances in Japan. The only death close to such settings of a cliff, can be that of the ritual suicide of Saigo Takamori during September of 1877 on a hilltop in Kagoshima, which is a coast city. He was the aristocratic politician who led the Satsuma rebellion, but was one of 3 samurai who helped form the Japan army whom he turned against. This murder story your friend mentioned, have the liking of a rumor. The rebellion had nothing to do with another country. Only Samurai faught against the Meiji laws of the Japan army, in 1877 where about 21thousand perished...mmm...but I will follow this story up.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeon<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWarrior_of_bushido &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warrior_of_bushido@...\">warrior_of_bushido@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nHi, a college friend posed this question to me, and  as i dont know of any such story,  i wondered if any of you have any information.
