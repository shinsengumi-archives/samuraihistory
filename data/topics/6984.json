As<br/>\nCEPO said, he&#39;s baaack....when someone posts that, it<br/>\nshould be a clue to you that we&#39;ve dealt with him<br/>\nbefore. Anyone stop to think why he emailed you<br/>\nindividually? It&#39;s because he CANNOT post on the<br/>\nlist--us moderator types will immediately delete his<br/>\nemail and ban him, AGAIN. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuit wasting your time with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
