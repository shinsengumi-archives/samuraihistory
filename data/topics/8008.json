And even more <br/>\nespecially, there is little evidence that they were taken to battles. <br/>\nThe Japanese had panelized wooden houses and other buildings which <br/>\nwere at times moved from one place to another.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are right.  There is very little evidence of the use of Japanese <br/>\nusing tents at all - one way or the other - either in books, or <br/>\nscrolls or T.V or film.  However, I find it somewhat hard to believe <br/>\nthat they &quot;never&quot; slept in their tents or take them to use <br/>\nas &quot;command posts&quot;.  In my years of studying history from various <br/>\nparts of the world, I&#39;ve found that just because there <br/>\nisn&#39;t &quot;evidence&quot; that a particular thing was done, it more often than <br/>\nnot doesn&#39;t mean that it wasn&#39;t done either.  It has also been very <br/>\ninteresting to note that things that were spouted as &quot;fact&quot; twenty <br/>\nyears ago, are sometimes proven to be &quot;fiction&quot;.  It&#39;s one of the <br/>\nreasons why I LOVE history!<br/>\n<br/>\nI belong to a group of historical enthusiasts...Not the SCA....and I <br/>\nintend to set up a Japanese Feudal Age encampment that is as accurate <br/>\nas possible. (I will probably start out small, and expand as i go.) I <br/>\nand the other members in my household, need a place out of the sun <br/>\nand weather (since where I live is humid and rainy in the summer - <br/>\nkind of like Japan.).  I also need a place that will allow me to <br/>\nprotect weaponry and yoroi (as well as hide other non-historical <br/>\nperiod stuff like cots and sleeping bags when necessary.) from prying <br/>\neyes, inquistive hands and those same weather elements.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, when the public comes through the encampment, I want them to <br/>\nsay &quot;oooh!&quot; and &quot;Ahhhh!&quot;.  When they ask questions, they&#39;ll get the <br/>\ninformation like you just gave me regarding the use of the akunoya.  <br/>\nWhen they leave for the day, and the site closes down to the public, <br/>\nI need a place to lay my head and prepare for the next day.  Though <br/>\nperhaps historically inaccurate, I&#39;ll probably be sleeping in the <br/>\nakunoya out of convenience and neccessity.  (I don&#39;t think the local <br/>\nBaptist church would take kindly to my riding up in full yoroi and <br/>\nkicking them out so I have a place for me and my samurai to stay ;-<br/>\n)  ) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As for carports. I understand the allure of using carports. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>However, you should probably come up with simple box beam type posts <br/>\nto enclose the aluminium poles. Covering them with wood grain contact <br/>\npaper does little to disguise their essential wrongness.j Another <br/>\nproblem with carport construction is that the vertical supports may <br/>\nnot really be in the right places to replicate what we know of <br/>\nakunoya from iconographic evidence. If you are more industrious, why <br/>\nnot buy lumber and make the frame yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with you  - in principle - that using a carport is not very <br/>\npalatable.  Unfortunately, we have to live in today&#39;s day and age and <br/>\nI have to be concerned with ease of set up and take down, <br/>\ntransportability, structural integrity and safety.  Though I like the <br/>\nidea of using real lumber for the framework, I don&#39;t have the luxury <br/>\nof having a team of skilled Japanese carpenters who can produce <br/>\nhistorically accurate joinery or the desire to transport the weight <br/>\nof the frame work alone. (The truck I use to transport my encampment <br/>\nwill only hold so much in both cubic space and in weight and I don&#39;t <br/>\neven want to go into the logistical challenges that are added when I <br/>\nbring the horses and all of their accoutrements.) <br/>\n<br/>\nRest assured, that I will do a very good job of &quot;covering&quot; the poles <br/>\nand they will look just like wood (from far away).  I was originally <br/>\nthinking of using bamboo to cover the metal poles. (I have alot of it <br/>\navailable and could hollow it out to cover the poles.) BUT Tony said <br/>\nthat was definitely &quot;out&quot; so I&#39;m thinking of other ways to cover the <br/>\npoles to make them look like &quot;wood framing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll also look closely at the spacing of the vertical supports that <br/>\nhold up the top. (Along with the correct width of the fabric.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was hoping to have discussions like this and welcome your insight <br/>\nand experience.  If you have any pictures or drawings of what that <br/>\njoinery looked like, I&#39;d appreciate it.  If you have access to book <br/>\ntitles so I have research documentation to support my endeavors, <br/>\nthat&#39;s even better.  Anything that will add to the great information <br/>\navailable on Tony&#39;s site would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",

The best visual<br/>\nrepresentation would likely be in Taiga drama--1996&#39;s<br/>\nHideyoshi, for example, probably has one or two camp<br/>\nscenes per episode. 1997&#39;s Mori Motonari, 1990(?)<br/>\nNobunaga, King of Zipangu, or the Tokugawai Aoi Sandai<br/>\nor Toshiie to Matsu (forget the years) would all be<br/>\nfairly recent ones that should have many many scenes<br/>\nthat would help to give you an idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a Japanese food store or market near you,<br/>\nthey may have video rentals (I watched half of Toshiie<br/>\nto Matsu&#39;s 50 episodes in 2 weeks when I was in Kansas<br/>\nCity for business one time) where you can find these. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- kuroi_uma_samurai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kuroi_uma_samurai@...\">kuroi_uma_samurai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m a new member of this website.
