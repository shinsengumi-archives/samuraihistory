My name is Natan Ruiz, I´m brazilian student (architecture). Obviously in deep interest on japanese ancient culture and samurai tradicion. Iaijutsu and Kenjutsu student as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n    I found this group on Samurai Archives page, and I feel really pleased to join this mailing list, which it seems to be an outstanding source of knowledge and communication with people just like me. Domo Arigatô Gozaimashitá! =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I invoque the attention of experts and &quot;sempais&quot; to call some help!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI´m in need of some material about the European influence over Japan. And I say I´m REALLY in need of it, in order to accomplish a project. Portuguese arrivals and the jesuits, so as the trade relations with daymios, but specially in care of the introduction of Christianism, and the great cultural conflict with buddhism, and japanese manners, IN DETAILS. I´ve spent lot of time in reserch, but not very sucessfull. Maybe because it´s a very specific subject, I know that. I´ve had some contact with portuguese authors (Rainer Dahnenhardt) and some institutions, but It´s pretty hard to find support. Since I joined the group, I´m looking all the messages sent here, to see If I find something. (sorry if i´m repeating this subject) Anyway, It would help me a lot if anyone could point me author, books, sites, or even better, spend some time writing about it for me! hehehehe<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease mail me (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rnascimento@...\">rnascimento@...</a>) <br/>\nAnd once again, thank you for accepting me! I hope to be helpfull around here!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Sorry about poor english! =/<br/>\n<br/>\nNatan Ruiz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
