Meaning,... is there a clan that specifically focuses on wearing samurai armour to the SCA events??? If so, please let me know. I&#39;ve checked the SCA website and couldn&#39;t find any. Thank you. <br/>\n                             mark<br/>\n <br/>\nP.S. I take kendo. Will that be helpful in fighting in these events?? I&#39;ve never been to one but have heard a lot of awesome things about them. Thanks again. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Meet the all-new My Yahoo! ï¿½ Try it today! <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
