            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-214776258\">I&#39;m not Thomas. But a prime example of this is the famous revenge of the 47<br/>\nformer Ako retainers. Mainly, they conducted a vendetta without official<br/>\npermission. There were provisions in bakufu law where a person who sought to<br/>\navenge the death of someone else could seek a permit from the government.<br/>\nHowever, these permits would put the enemy on notice that a vendeta was<br/>\nbeing sought. The 47 ronin realized that by seeking a permit, they would<br/>\nalert Kira, their enemy, who had far superior manpower. They depended upon<br/>\nthe element of surprise so they planned and carried out their vendetta<br/>\nwithout the lawful permit. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the attack, there was a rather heated debate about what their fate<br/>\nshould be. Some argued for executing them as common criminals because of<br/>\nconducting a vendetta without government sanction. Others thought that,<br/>\nbecause they avenged their lord&#39;s death following cherished Confucian<br/>\nprinciples, that they should be exonerated completely. A compromise was<br/>\nstruck and they were ordered to die, but could die by seppuku rather than<br/>\nbeing executed as common criminals.<br/>\n<br/>\nNina <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seikei7248@...\">seikei7248@...</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 3:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] The &#39;Image&#39; of the Samurai<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 10/20/2005 1:02:34 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tom.davidson@...\">tom.davidson@...</a> writes:<br/>\nThus the occasions when samurai were brought before the court for acting<br/>\n&#39;properly&#39; - the instant redress of perceived offence - always put the<br/>\nbakafu in a difficult position - they wanted a samurai bound by his code of<br/>\nhonour, but they were stuck then when he acted without asking their<br/>\npermission first.<br/>\nThomas!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1261445725\">Great points. I&#39;m not a history expert. But from what I&#39;ve read and seen, it<br/>\nseems that the Tokugawa shogunate was one of the most effective<br/>\nauthoritarian governments that ever existed. It survived for 250+ years. One<br/>\nof the ways it survived was in &quot;taming&quot; the samurai class, once there were<br/>\nno longer any wars. The daimyo were &quot;tamed&quot; by the system of every other<br/>\nyear having to live in Edo and his wife and children basically being kept<br/>\nhostage there. The &quot;common&quot; ordinary retainers were &quot;tamed&quot; by instituting<br/>\ncodes of conduct that emphasized an interpretation of Confucian thought<br/>\nwhere serving the bakufu was what a &quot;superior man&quot; must do. The bakufu<br/>\nappears to have discouraged self-reliance and even discouraged service to<br/>\none&#39;s daimyo unless it also meant service to the bakufu. As you said,<br/>\nsayings such as &quot;the sword is the soul of the samurai&quot; were used to shift<br/>\nthe emphasis away from the samurai as an individual toward having the<br/>\nsamurai subsume his individuality to serve the best interests of the<br/>\nTokugawa state. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe huge &quot;sword of Damocles&quot; that the Tokugawa shogunate held over the<br/>\ndaimyo and their retainers was the threat of clan abolishment, where the<br/>\nfate of the clansmen was either seppuku (mostly for the daimyo and higher<br/>\nofficials) or for retainers, being thrust into the essentially non-person<br/>\nstatus of ronin. <br/>\n<br/>\nNina  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Thomas Davidson<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 1:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] The &#39;Image&#39; of the Samurai<br/>\n<br/>\n[snips]<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder, however - if Ieyasu could have done away with the sammurai after<br/>\nthe bakafu was safely established - would he have done so?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me &#39;the sword is the soul of the samurai&#39; shifts the emphasis away from<br/>\nthe man, and is all part of the &#39;cult of the Tokugawa&#39; in that the man now<br/>\nhas something to live up to outside of himself - and the person he should<br/>\naspire to be was founded on Confucian ethic of service to the state. -<br/>\nprecisely because the Tokugawa did not want a military class with such a<br/>\nstrong sense of self-determination and self-reliance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus the occasions when samurai were brought before the court for acting<br/>\n&#39;properly&#39; - the instant redress of perceived offence - always put the<br/>\nbakafu in a difficult position - they wanted a samurai bound by his code of<br/>\nhonour, but they were stuck then when he acted without asking their<br/>\npermission first.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a personal view, but it seems to me the bakafu always &#39;fudged&#39; the<br/>\nissue when faced with the question of self-determination v subjugation to<br/>\nthe state.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------ Yahoo!
