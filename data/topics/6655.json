            "msgSnippet": "Sifting through samurai spoils Local man opens shop fit only for a true shogun By Brian Freedman February 04, 2005 Paul MacLardy slowly opened the wooden doors",
            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-224914842\">Sifting through samurai spoils<br/>\nLocal man opens shop fit only for a true shogun<br/>\nBy Brian Freedman <br/>\n<br/>\nFebruary 04, 2005<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul MacLardy slowly opened the wooden doors to the dusty nineteenth-<br/>\ncentury Japanese cabinet and removed his weapon, cautiously <br/>\nunwrapping the sheet protecting the 36-inch samurai sword. With <br/>\npride and reverence, he gripped the sharkskin handle and held up the <br/>\nweapon capable of beheading a man in a swift motion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacLardy is the owner of Arise, an Asian antiques store that <br/>\nrecently moved to College Park. The store houses thousands of relics <br/>\nfrom a culture MacLardy has grown to love.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cluttered warehouse  hidden by an innocent-looking, building  <br/>\nhas everything from $5 silk candleholders to $6,000 seventeenth-<br/>\ncentury Buddha statues, from a $20 small, ribbetting wood frog to <br/>\nthe sword, which is worth $10,000.<br/>\n<br/>\nArise, which MacLardy has run for more than 20 years, mainly sells <br/>\nwholesale to museums, catalogues and antique shops, but also boasts <br/>\nan impressive list of celebrity customers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHilary Duff, after noticing Madonna wear a kimono to the Grammys, <br/>\nfell in the love with the Material Girl&#39;s dress and ordered her <br/>\npeople to contact Arise, said MacLardy. Duff then purchased a <br/>\ndecorative blue-and-white kimono from Arise, which she donned for <br/>\nthe Nickelodeon&#39;s Kid&#39;s Choice Awards in 2002.<br/>\n<br/>\nArise has also supplied furniture for sets of motion pictures and <br/>\nlocal plays. The Harrison Ford movie Random Hearts exhibited a few <br/>\nfurniture pieces from his warehouse, and MacLardy provided most of <br/>\nthe kimonos for the Arena Stage&#39;s production of M. Butterfly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the kimonos are designed by MacLardy and produced by his <br/>\nbusiness partner in India.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe purchases the other rare and avant-garde merchandise through <br/>\nconnections in Japan, China and Indonesia, and has it shipped back <br/>\nto his warehouse in 20- to 40-foot-long containers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I like the fact that we provide a lot of jobs overseas. That&#39;s <br/>\nimportant to us,&quot; said MacLardy, who has a background in public <br/>\ninterest work. &quot;It&#39;s creative. We do a lot of different things, so <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t get boring, and that&#39;s my personality. If I had wanted to <br/>\nget rich, I would have just done one thing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMacLardy first dabbled in the Asian antique business as part of a <br/>\nfund-raising kimono sale for a food co-op he owned. His interest in <br/>\nAsian culture began with books and television shows.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I got into it from the James Clavell novel Shogun. I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve seeing the samurai and stuff,&quot; said MacLardy. &quot;When I was in <br/>\ncollege I would go to the Metropolitan Museum and I would see the <br/>\nChinese and Japanese art and I kind of fell in love with it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow not only does he speak fluent Japanese, but he also co-wrote a <br/>\nbook about kimonos three years ago that sold 9,000 copies nationwide.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacLardy plans to reopen his store, which was previously in Takoma <br/>\nPark, by hosting a university-only pre-sale on Feb. 21, and sell <br/>\nitems at wholesale prices with a 50 percent discount.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3jcf4\">http://tinyurl.com/3jcf4</a></div>",
