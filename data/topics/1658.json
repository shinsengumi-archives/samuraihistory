Mr. Hyakutake trains Hyoho Niten Ichi ryu<br/>\nunder Imai Masayuki soke and has translated some of soke&#39;s writings<br/>\n(including some info about Musashi and Buddhism) here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bunbun.ne.jp/~sword/Hyoho1.html\">http://www.bunbun.ne.jp/~sword/Hyoho1.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn Koryu Bujutsu book (edited by Diane Skoss, ISBN: 1-890536-04-0,<br/>\nwww.koryu.com) there is an article by Mr. David A. Hall: Marishiten -<br/>\nBuddhist Influences on Combative Behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt www.e-budo.com there are couple of people who could propably point<br/>\nyou to better sources, so you might want to try there. Mr. William<br/>\nBodiford is an associate professor in UCLA and has specialized (IIRC)<br/>\non Buddhist studies and has trained Kashima-Shinryu for a long time.<br/>\nMr. Karl Friday is a history professor in University of Georgia and<br/>\nMenkyo Kaiden in Kashima-Shinryu and might also have some thing to say<br/>\nabout the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little older book: Blomberg, Catharina: Samurai Religion (1977,<br/>\nUppsala University) might also have something on the subject. The book<br/>\nmight be quite hard to get, but maybe you could try a local University<br/>\nlibrary.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw. our iaido teacher Takada Gakudo sensei is mikkyo buddhist. At<br/>\nleast one person who has visited him in Japan has taken part of some<br/>\nof his religious practises. Takada sensei has only once briefly talked<br/>\nabout his religion, so I don&#39;t have much knowledge about it. Maybe<br/>\nnext Autumn I can find something out as I was lucky enough to get<br/>\naccepted for an exchange student program and will spend a year in<br/>\nJapan near where our sensei lives (yes, I know I&#39;m a lucky bas**** :).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease share with us if you find something more about the subject! I<br/>\nbelieve many are familiar with the over emphasized zen buddhist<br/>\ninfluence in budo, while mikkyo buddhism (which propably has had more<br/>\ninfluence) is not very well known.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMikko Vilenius - co-admin:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hiphop-directory.com\">http://www.hiphop-directory.com</a><br/>\n&quot;As private parts to the gods are we,<br/>\n they play with us for their sport&quot;<br/>\n-Lord Melchett, Black Adder S2 EP06</div>",
