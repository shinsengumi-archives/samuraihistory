            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1522800036\">I have an original 2 poster set of &quot;The 47 Ronin&quot; The last time I <br/>\nwas in Japan, I tracked down the burial site of the 47, and was in <br/>\nawe of the reverance still given these guys. It is my favorite story <br/>\nof all time. If you haven&#39;t read it, I recommend it highly. For <br/>\nthose of you who have, and enjoyed it as much as I did, these <br/>\nposters are a must have. They are in mint condition, all in <br/>\nJapanese. This was purchased on site at the burial grounds. I also <br/>\nhave a tea cup, depicting a scene from the story. I have no idea <br/>\nwhat these are worth, but a recent divorce forces me to sell.All <br/>\noffers will be considered, but do not insult me, I really hate to <br/>\nget rid of these. I have lots of other art work of the 47 ronin, by <br/>\nan artist Hisashi Otsuka. If you are familiar with his work, we <br/>\ncould talk.<br/>\nMy email is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:terryw98241@...\">terryw98241@...</a></div>",
