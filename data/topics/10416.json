            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-510470610\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Brian and I am the author of the Killer Katanas miniature system, which has been around for 17 years.  I am also a teacher and I teach US History at Roosevelt High School in Southern California, part of LAUSD. Sixty of my students were invited to go to Manzanar (a former Japanese Internment Camp), on May 5th. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe great thing about this is that our guide is a former Internee AND Roosevelt Alumni who was removed from the school by soldiers back in 1942. This is a great opportunity for the kids to hear eyewitness testimony from a former &quot;Rough Rider&quot; and Internee about life at the school and in the camps.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Principal was not able to get the district to provide a bus, and so we must raise the funds our self. Being an inner-city school this is no easy task, but I have been able to raise about 3/4 of what is needed, and I just need a little more to make this trip possible. I can use some assistance<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am going to have a sale on my supplements. Even if you do not play miniatures, the information in these is most valuable to the person interested in samurai.  In fact, many buy my books just for the information and do not play my game.  They contain information on Battles, with complete maps and Orders of Battle, uniform information, flags, and personality descriptions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHidyoshi&#39;s Korean Invasion is my latest work, and a product of over 10 years of research.  Kenneth Swoop and Stephen Turnbull both provided assistance while writing the book. It has information on the Armies the Ming, Choson, and Toyotomi that fought the war, including information on their uniforms, flags, organization, and weapons.  There is several pages of illustrations showing the troops types and flags.  There is also information on 10 of the major battles of the conflict, each with a map and order of battle. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other books deal with particular samurai clans.  Date&#39;s battles is the latest, and deals with Date Masamune and his clan, complete with full-color plates depicting his troops and all his sashimono, plus information on two of his great battles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other books are older ones, like the Date book, but in black and white. They are unbound versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is the items and sale prices:<br/>\n<br/>\nHideysohi&#39;s Korean Invasion (normally $35 USDNOW $20.00 USD)<br/>\nDate&#39;s Battles (normally $25 USDNOW $10.00 USD)<br/>\nShimazu&#39;s Battles (normally $15 USDNOW $7.50 USD)<br/>\nMori&#39;s Battles (normally $15 USDNOW $7.50 USD)<br/>\nHideyoshi&#39;s Battles Battles (normally $15 USDNOW $7.50 USD)<br/>\nTokugawa&#39;s Battles (normally $15 USDNOW $7.50 USD)<br/>\n<br/>\nShipping will be $5.90 USD for any amount of books and they are limited to supply. The older supplements are almost sold out now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll have the sale until April 20th when I have to give my definite yes/no &quot;go&quot; to the bus service.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested please contact me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BBradford1973@...\">BBradford1973@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nArrigato,<br/>\nBrian</div>",
