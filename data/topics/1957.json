Which I see most commonly translated <br/>\nas &quot;Warrior Pilgramage&quot;.  It is when a warrior travels all over the <br/>\nplace training with different teachers and/or challenging other <br/>\nwarriors to duels to improve their skills.  It was very common <br/>\n(Compared to earlier times, although it did happen before)in the <br/>\nTokugawa period when samurai had little else to, and the ones that <br/>\ntook their training seriously saw the extended peace as an <br/>\nenivronment in which to travel and perfect their skills.  Actually <br/>\nthere are some martial artists that still do this today, although <br/>\nvery rare (and trains with different teachers, but the challenge part <br/>\nhas died off for obvious reasons).</div>",
