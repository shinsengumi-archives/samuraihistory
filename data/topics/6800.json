I seem to vaguely remember<br/>\nEiko Ikegami mentioning it briefly in the introduction to &#39;Taming of the<br/>\nSamurai&#39;, which I&#39;ll check when I get home. I had thought that prior to<br/>\nthe Tokugawa Bakufu bushi was the preferred term, where as during the<br/>\nEdo period the preferred term was samurai, as &#39;one who serves&#39; was a<br/>\nperhaps more the image the Bakufu was looking to promote than &#39;warrior&#39;.<br/>\n&#39;Samurai&#39; seems to carry more prestige with it.
