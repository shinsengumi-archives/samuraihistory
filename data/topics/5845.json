(although he did kill his son <br/>\nYoshinobu) I researched this fairly thouroughly at the library, and <br/>\nthis is what I found, basically cut and pasted right from what I <br/>\nadded about it to the Takeda Shingen bio.  Shingen was actually one <br/>\nof the few that let his father live, from what I can tell:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In 1541 Harunobu suddenly rebelled, supported by a great many of <br/>\nhis father&#39;s retainers. Nobutora submitted with little bloodshed and <br/>\nHarunobu exiled his father to Suruga. In this act he had the aid of <br/>\nthe top Takeda retainers, many of whom held personal grudges against <br/>\nNobutora or at least saw some gain in assisting the young usurper to <br/>\npower. Nobushige, for his part, seems to have borne his brother no <br/>\nill will, and became a valued retainer. Sources conflict on what the <br/>\nexact events where which led to the replacement of Nobuhide with <br/>\nHarunobu. One version of events is that in the 5th month of 1541, <br/>\nNobutora and Harunobu went on a campaign together to attack Unno <br/>\nMunetsuna in Shinano province. Unno Munetsuna lost and fled the <br/>\nprovince, and by the 4th day of the 6th month, they were on thier <br/>\nway back to Kai. However, on the 10th day of thier trip back to Kai <br/>\nprovince, Harunobu suddenly rebelled in a coup supported by his <br/>\nashigaru and retainers, forcing Nobutora to flee to Suruga Province, <br/>\nand in to the care of his daughter&#39;s husband, Imagawa Yoshimoto. <br/>\nThis generally follows the Koyogunkan, which essentialy states that <br/>\nHarunobu uncovered a plot by Nobutora to dispose of him and <br/>\neventually give control of the Takeda clan to his younger brother, <br/>\nNobushige. According to the Koyogunkan, Harunobu and loyal vassals <br/>\ndrove Nobutora out of Kai province into Suruga. Another version of <br/>\nevents states that during the 6th month of 1541, Harunobu and <br/>\nNobutora travelled to Suruga province to visit upon Nobutora&#39;s son <br/>\nin law, Imagawa Yoshimoto. Little did Nobutora know, Shingen and <br/>\nYoshimoto had a secret agreement, and upon arrival, Nobutora was <br/>\nforcibly retired to Suruga castle, and his son Harunobu was given <br/>\ncontrol of the Takeda clan. Although what really happened is not <br/>\nclear, historians seem to be in agreement that Imagawa Yoshimoto had <br/>\na hand in the removal of Nobutora. Regardless , Harunobu took <br/>\ncontrol of the clan in what is often specifically cited as <br/>\na &#39;bloodless coup&#39;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/shingen.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/shingen.html</a></div>",
