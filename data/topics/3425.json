            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-913121677\">Well, you can believe what you want to believe. Just realize that your personal religious views are NOT the &quot;stripped down essence&quot; of the teachings of Christ or Buddha. You&#39;ve more or less made up your own personal religion. Which is pretty audacious. You&#39;re taking a very deconstructionist approach to religion, and divorcing the religious beliefs from the intent of the original teachers, redefining it and reconstructing it to suit yourself. Which again, is audacious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as we&#39;ve discussed a lot on this group... the samurai code doesn&#39;t have much to do with the historical samurai. And as for inherent goodness... have you read the hagakure? A lot of it has to do with how to kill other people. Not a lot of inherent goodness in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to discuss religious views, we should probably do that off-group...<br/>\n<br/>\nDan.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hiya,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand the point of religions, but to me their point and the<br/>\n&gt; point of the beliefs (in the grander scale, what Christ, Buddha, and<br/>\n&gt; such taught) are different. To me, the inherent meaning of<br/>\n&gt; Christianity and the other beliefs is the morality (of course,<br/>\n&gt; morality is such a vague word, it can change depending on the POV of<br/>\n&gt; the society it comes from). You are right, I&#39;m not a religious person,<br/>\n&gt; which is not to say I don&#39;t believe in God, or even in the grand tale<br/>\n&gt; of angels, demons, and the rise and fall from grace of mankind, etc.<br/>\n&gt; What I don&#39;t believe in is in religions. I strip down the Message to<br/>\n&gt; its essence: do good and be rewarded (I&#39;m making it sound simpler than<br/>\n&gt; it is, but I won&#39;t go into too much detail). And one of the main<br/>\n&gt; reasons, if not the main one, why I do not believe in religions is<br/>\n&gt; precisely that very fervent (sp?) people do give more weight to the<br/>\n&gt; individual and unique aspects of their religions than to what really<br/>\n&gt; matters. Why is it that even amongst same Beliefs the different<br/>\n&gt; religions don&#39;t agree much and make those disagreements into something<br/>\n&gt; that matters? As if being a good person but NOT believing in God will<br/>\n&gt; take you to Hell, but one that is evil and constantly repents and<br/>\n&gt; confesses to the priest, and do all the things the religion requires<br/>\n&gt; will take you to Heaven, That doesn&#39;t make sense to me. So, once<br/>\n&gt; again, I strip it down to the core. Even the Samurai code has that<br/>\n&gt; inherent message of goodness embedded on it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Miburo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, golfmandan@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let me say first off that you&#39;ve misunderstood Christianity and<br/>\n&gt; Buddhism and most world religions if you think that the point is<br/>\n&gt; simply morality. Sure, most religions have a system of morality, but<br/>\n&gt; the defining of good and bad is NOT the point. In Christianity the<br/>\n&gt; point is peace with God through faith in Christ. In Buddhism the point<br/>\n&gt; is the cessation of individual existence in an illusory world, to<br/>\n&gt; exist only in Nirvana. Christians want to propogate their religion<br/>\n&gt; because they believe people will be judged by God when they die, and<br/>\n&gt; so they think people need forgiveness to enter heaven instead of hell.<br/>\n&gt; Buddhists propogate their religion because they believe people are<br/>\n&gt; blinded by the material world from their need to escape into a<br/>\n&gt; painless and selfless existence in Nirvana. It IS the root principle<br/>\n&gt; that matters. The moral system is a reflection of the root belief.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s why Buddhist morals and Christian morals are so different. They<br/>\n&gt; DON&quot;T teach the same thing. I&#39;d assume from your post that you&#39;re not<br/>\n&gt; a very religious guy. Talk to anybody who takes their religion<br/>\n&gt; seriously and you&#39;ll find that the beliefs are most important, not the<br/>\n&gt; least important.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Which, that&#39;s why the Jesuit missionaries tried to clothe Christian<br/>\n&gt; truth in the fashion of contemporary Japanese religion. Christian<br/>\n&gt; beliefs with Japanese rituals or practice. It&#39;s the underlying  belief<br/>\n&gt; that is most important. So, in theory, if you make it look a little<br/>\n&gt; more Japanese, it becomes easier for the Japanese to understand, but<br/>\n&gt; the core beliefs remain intact. This method of propogating Roman<br/>\n&gt; Catholic faith was used by their missionaries a lot. It isn&#39;t looked<br/>\n&gt; at as deceitful, but simply as communicating their beliefs in such a<br/>\n&gt; way as to be more easily understood, and to some extent, in a manner<br/>\n&gt; more palatable to the mind of the one being taught. Some of this has<br/>\n&gt; to do with Aristotelian distinctions between the accident and occident<br/>\n&gt; of a thing... The &quot;accident&quot; is the appearance of a thing. The<br/>\n&gt; &quot;occident&quot; is the core essence. The accident doesn&#39;t matter nearly as<br/>\n&gt; much as the occident. So, as long as the same core belief is being<br/>\n&gt; taught, then the Catholics didn&#39;t care what it looked like. (In actual<br/>\n&gt; practice, though, the old Catholic method tends toward syncretism...<br/>\n&gt; mixing of both belief and ritual... so nothing remains in its pure form).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, but what&#39;s the need to introduce christianity? Buddism (from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what I know of it) does a good job of teaching what&#39;s good from what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bad, and that&#39;s what is important, the message, not the belief.

As someone said, it&#39;s a matter of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WHICH <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (L)ord you&#39;re dying for.  In their cases, they were dying for a Lord<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not Of This <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; World.  They adhered absolutely to the tenets of bushido in that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they served <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their highest Lord to the death.  Show me one samurai who never lied<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or used <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; falsehood or murdered or committed some form of treason to protect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his lord -- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human or Otherwise -- and I&#39;ll show you a liar.  :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        As for Nobunaga, what about the threat of the Ikko Ikki?  Do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you think <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they wanted to party hearty?  Do you think they were going to<br/>\n&gt; try and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proselytize him and his army?  Hardly likely.  It is unlikely that a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; majority of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who stood in Nobunaga&#39;s way, even if they did congeal into a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; potent <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fighting force, would have stood a chance against a brilliant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; general such as the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leader of the Oda and his right hand man, Toyotomi, this is true. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t the issue.  The issue was that anyone who stood in Oda&#39;s way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of unifying <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Japan -- in WHATEVER WAY THAT WAS -- was seen as a threat.  Any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; threat -- no <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter how great or small, or how justified or unjustified -- must<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be removed. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Therefore, the genocide, however indefencible to us, was very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; defencible to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HIM, and quite frankly, that&#39;s the only opinion about the issue that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mattered in the end, although it is nice to bat it around and say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;what if&quot; and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;what was he thinking?&quot; now with four hundred years plus of<br/>\n&gt; hindsight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        And I must throw my hat into the ring about it too -- I may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not be a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Catholic (either belief or by church membership), but these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anti-Catholic posts <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have GOT to stop.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        Anyway, that&#39;s my two &quot;not-worth-much&quot; cents.  8-)  Take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; care, y&#39;all.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tim<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!

It is unlikely that a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; majority of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people who stood in Nobunaga&#39;s way, even if they did congeal into a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; potent <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting force, would have stood a chance against a brilliant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; general such as the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leader of the Oda and his right hand man, Toyotomi, this is true. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t the issue.  The issue was that anyone who stood in Oda&#39;s way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of unifying <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Japan -- in WHATEVER WAY THAT WAS -- was seen as a threat.  Any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; threat -- no <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; matter how great or small, or how justified or unjustified -- must<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be removed. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Therefore, the genocide, however indefencible to us, was very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; defencible to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HIM, and quite frankly, that&#39;s the only opinion about the issue that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mattered in the end, although it is nice to bat it around and say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;what if&quot; and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;what was he thinking?&quot; now with four hundred years plus of<br/>\nhindsight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        And I must throw my hat into the ring about it too -- I may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not be a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Catholic (either belief or by church membership), but these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anti-Catholic posts <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have GOT to stop.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Anyway, that&#39;s my two &quot;not-worth-much&quot; cents.  8-)  Take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; care, y&#39;all.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 8-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tim<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

Though the parties of each agenda are separate as to their intentions, they nonetheless seem to operate side by side. Sometimes it seems as if the missionaries are leading the way, and the imperialists are riding along in hopes of using the mission religion as a foothold for their economic plans. And sometimes it seems the other way around, like the Imperialists are leading the way and the missionaries are riding along to use the new colonization as an attempt to gain a foothold for religious purposes. Don&#39;t make the mistake of blending the two together, though. Missionaries and Merchants/Ambassadors are often like siamese twins that can&#39;t stand eachother. Always in the same place, but for totally different reasons, often despising the goals of the other. The Jesuits in Japan were there for love of the people. But they were accompanied by others who were there for the love of money.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Religions have historically been used to control and manipulate the masses.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you look at religious conflict, there is almost always a political reason <br/>\n&gt; behind the influx of a new religion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please note that this is not an attack on the validity of anyone&#39;s religion. <br/>\n&gt; Rather, I&#39;m just pointing out that there are always people an organizations who <br/>\n&gt; eagerly manipulate people&#39;s beliefs for their own profit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Thom <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hey.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         It&#39;s not necessarily a need, per se, unless you look at it that the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; missionaries were simply doing what their faith/religion commanded them to do <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in spreading their message &quot;to the ends of the earth&quot;.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1672875867\">Let me say first off that you&#39;ve misunderstood Christianity and Buddhism and most world religions if you think that the point is simply morality. Sure, most religions have a system of morality, but the defining of good and bad is NOT the point. In Christianity the point is peace with God through faith in Christ. In Buddhism the point is the cessation of individual existence in an illusory world, to exist only in Nirvana. Christians want to propogate their religion because they believe people will be judged by God when they die, and so they think people need forgiveness to enter heaven instead of hell. Buddhists propogate their religion because they believe people are blinded by the material world from their need to escape into a painless and selfless existence in Nirvana. It IS the root principle that matters. The moral system is a reflection of the root belief. That&#39;s why Buddhist morals and Christian morals are so different. They DON&quot;T teach the same thing. I&#39;d assume from your post that you&#39;re not a very religious guy. Talk to anybody who takes their religion seriously and you&#39;ll find that the beliefs are most important, not the least important.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich, that&#39;s why the Jesuit missionaries tried to clothe Christian truth in the fashion of contemporary Japanese religion. Christian beliefs with Japanese rituals or practice. It&#39;s the underlying  belief that is most important. So, in theory, if you make it look a little more Japanese, it becomes easier for the Japanese to understand, but the core beliefs remain intact. This method of propogating Roman Catholic faith was used by their missionaries a lot. It isn&#39;t looked at as deceitful, but simply as communicating their beliefs in such a way as to be more easily understood, and to some extent, in a manner more palatable to the mind of the one being taught. Some of this has to do with Aristotelian distinctions between the accident and occident of a thing... The &quot;accident&quot; is the appearance of a thing. The &quot;occident&quot; is the core essence. The accident doesn&#39;t matter nearly as much as the occident. So, as long as the same core belief is being taught, then the Catholics didn&#39;t care what it looked like. (In actual practice, though, the old Catholic method tends toward syncretism... mixing of both belief and ritual... so nothing remains in its pure form).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Yeah, but what&#39;s the need to introduce christianity? Buddism (from<br/>\n&gt; what I know of it) does a good job of teaching what&#39;s good from what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; bad, and that&#39;s what is important, the message, not the belief.

I&#39;ve read a copy of the original message of him to the pope with<br/>\n&gt; a translation to portuguese, and he admited that, to introduce christianity<br/>\n&gt; to japan, they would deliberatelly LIE and ACT WITH FALSEHOOD, disguissing<br/>\n&gt; christian religious practices with the buddhist ones...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>       Okay, just a question here: which would have been better: for them to <br/>\nhave used deception and get in to attempt the spread of their message or tell <br/>\nthe truth, probably get killed and never get a word in about their message?  <br/>\nTo me, missionary work can take on many disguises, because it&#39;s a matter of <br/>\nusing whatever means you have to to get your message out and if you believe it&#39;s <br/>\nthat important, you die for it.  As someone said, it&#39;s a matter of WHICH <br/>\n(L)ord you&#39;re dying for.  In their cases, they were dying for a Lord Not Of This <br/>\nWorld.  They adhered absolutely to the tenets of bushido in that they served <br/>\ntheir highest Lord to the death.  Show me one samurai who never lied or used <br/>\nfalsehood or murdered or committed some form of treason to protect his lord -- <br/>\nhuman or Otherwise -- and I&#39;ll show you a liar.  :-)<br/>\n       As for Nobunaga, what about the threat of the Ikko Ikki?  Do you think <br/>\nthey wanted to party hearty?  Do you think they were going to try and <br/>\nproselytize him and his army?  Hardly likely.  It is unlikely that a majority of the <br/>\npeople who stood in Nobunaga&#39;s way, even if they did congeal into a potent <br/>\nfighting force, would have stood a chance against a brilliant general such as the <br/>\nleader of the Oda and his right hand man, Toyotomi, this is true.  But that <br/>\nwasn&#39;t the issue.  The issue was that anyone who stood in Oda&#39;s way of unifying <br/>\nJapan -- in WHATEVER WAY THAT WAS -- was seen as a threat.  Any threat -- no <br/>\nmatter how great or small, or how justified or unjustified -- must be removed. <br/>\n Therefore, the genocide, however indefencible to us, was very defencible to <br/>\nHIM, and quite frankly, that&#39;s the only opinion about the issue that really <br/>\nmattered in the end, although it is nice to bat it around and say &quot;what if&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;what was he thinking?&quot; now with four hundred years plus of hindsight.<br/>\n       And I must throw my hat into the ring about it too -- I may not be a <br/>\nCatholic (either belief or by church membership), but these anti-Catholic posts <br/>\nhave GOT to stop.<br/>\n       Anyway, that&#39;s my two &quot;not-worth-much&quot; cents.  8-)  Take care, y&#39;all.  <br/>\n8-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

I&#39;ve read a copy of the original message of him to the pope with<br/>\na translation to portuguese, and he admited that, to introduce christianity<br/>\nto japan, they would deliberatelly LIE and ACT WITH FALSEHOOD, disguissing<br/>\nchristian religious practices with the buddhist ones...<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had a conspiratory behaviour since the begining, and Tokugawa just did<br/>\nwhat is right for the Japan national security, avoiding the terror that<br/>\nhappened in the hands of Nobunaga, and in Europe to the native religions<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey even attempted to kill Tokugawa himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the PC discourse that &quot;many religions did something reprobable in<br/>\ntheir history&quot;, no one did so much bloodshed than christianism, inclusive in<br/>\nJapan, and after the end of the Vietnan War, the catholic administrator put<br/>\n(again in recent history) several buddhist monks in concentration champs<br/>\n(fields), under the excuse to &quot;fight the communism&quot;. Unlike certain other<br/>\nreligions who have the habit to burn others when something they don&#39;t like<br/>\nhappens, the buddhist monks had burned their own bodies!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBushido is a way of Honour and LOYALTY! and again, those christians should<br/>\nnot be called Samurai!<br/>\n<br/>\nStop the lies.
