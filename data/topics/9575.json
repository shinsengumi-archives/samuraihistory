I have<br/>\nno university affiliation, so I have no &quot;colleagues&quot; to call on. Also,<br/>\nI am putting special and hard emphasis on quality sources and<br/>\nreferences.  The sources an article are based on will be evaluated as<br/>\nwell as the article itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Covered this in an old post, but only established PhDs can get<br/>\npublished in Monumenta Nipponica - I can&#39;t, and I don&#39;t know anyone<br/>\npersonally who can.  It will be a forum for independent scholars as<br/>\nwell as academic scholars.  Also, to put it simply (the old post goes<br/>\ninto greater detail) - this would be purely a &quot;history&quot; journal,<br/>\npre-20th century narrative history, biography, military, events.  Most<br/>\nJapan related journals don&#39;t cover &quot;just&quot; history.  The goal is to<br/>\ndevelop something interesting, readable, and useful for research.  The<br/>\nquality of writing, and veracity of ideas is more important than a PhD<br/>\nor lack thereof.  But I am also not disallowing any subjects related<br/>\nto Japanese history - anything regarding pre-20th century Japan will<br/>\nbe evaluated on a case-by-case basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI call it a &quot;journal&quot;, but the reality is that they will essentially<br/>\nbe books, more similar to a multi-volume set than a journal as far as<br/>\nexecution goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention, a print publication is the next logical step for the<br/>\nSamurai Archives, which is one of the main reasons I am moving forward<br/>\nwith this.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2100426669\">A month or two ago I announced the planned creating of a history<br/>\njournal.  It is moving along, and the webpage will be finished within<br/>\nthe next few weeks.  So, I&#39;m announcing here first that I am now<br/>\naccepting submissions.  The format for articles will generally follow<br/>\nthe Monumenta Nipponica stylesheet:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monumenta.cc.sophia.ac.jp/submissions.html\">http://monumenta.cc.sophia.ac.jp/submissions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough with some minor changes that will be covered in the webpage.<br/>\n Also, as I mentioned before, although we encourage students and<br/>\nacademic scholars of Japanese history to submit articles for the<br/>\njournal, academic affiliation is by no means a requirement.   Here is<br/>\nthe preliminary (in other words, rough draft) statement on the home<br/>\npage of the journal website.  Feel free to post or email me with any<br/>\nquestions.  We&#39;ll also be looking for anyone willing to make donations<br/>\nto help fund the journal, but regardless, I&#39;m moving forward with it.<br/>\n Thanks to the people who are helping me along with all this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Samurai Archives Journal of Japanese History is a new journal<br/>\ndevoted to the critical examination of the events and personalities of<br/>\npre-20th century Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goals of the Journal are to:<br/>\n<br/>\n# Encourage new and established scholars to share their research, as<br/>\nwell as to give independent scholars a forum for their work<br/>\n# To introduce readers to the wealth of material available in Japanese<br/>\nand English<br/>\n# To encourage interest and informed discussion on the topic of<br/>\nJapanese history<br/>\n<br/>\nThe journal is tentatively scheduled for publication in early 2008,<br/>\nand is currently accepting submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the general focus of the journal is on military history and<br/>\nbiography, articles dealing with all periods and subjects of Japanese<br/>\nhistory are welcomed; we demand only solid scholarship, clear writing<br/>\nand original ideas. Writers may approach their subjects from whichever<br/>\nfield or discipline they wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor several years the Samurai Archives has been the most comprehensive<br/>\nand widely recognized source of Japanese history in English on the<br/>\ninternet. This print journal will draw on the resources of the website<br/>\nand the talents of its members as well as the scholarship of other<br/>\ncontributors to present an authoritative and entertaining quarterly on<br/>\nthis fascinating subject.</div>",
