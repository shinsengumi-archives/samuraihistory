Tom Conlan has written an extraordinarily detailed <br/>\nand thorough history of warfare in the fourteenth century from a wide <br/>\nvariety of perspectives, including the function of the individual <br/>\nwarrior in everyday battle, the number and character of casualties, <br/>\nthe logistics of warfare, loyalty among warriors, and fighting as a <br/>\nsacred pursuit. STATE OF WAR makes a powerful contention that <br/>\nmilitarization was the principal force in the molding of fourteenth-<br/>\ncentury Japan.&quot;<br/>\nPaul Varley Sen Soshitsu XV Professor of Japanese Cultural History<br/>\nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This exciting book is a landmark in the study of premodern Japanese<br/>\nhistory. Informed by easy mastery of a wide range of largely untapped<br/>\nprimary sources and thoughtful conceptualization, Professor Conlan has<br/>\nproduced the most comprehensive study of warfare for any period of<br/>\nJapanese history. It is the first serious study of how warriors <br/>\nactually engaged in battle, and of the full range of logistic, <br/>\nintellectual, and religious factors that surround their lives; to his <br/>\ncredit, the author conveys well the human side of the story. The <br/>\nauthor&#39;s attention to issues of social change and technology is <br/>\nparticularly welcome and should inspire others to address these <br/>\nmatters in other periods of Japanese history. Readers will also <br/>\nappreciate the fluid writing style.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew Goble<br/>\nAssociate Professor of History<br/>\nUniversity of Oregon<br/>\n<br/>\nSTATE OF WAR, a path-breaking study of the transformative power of <br/>\nwar and its profound influence on fourteenth-century Japan, presents <br/>\na fundamental revision of Japanese history. By illuminating Japan <br/>\nthrough the lens of war, Thomas Conlan provides insight into how <br/>\nstate and society functioned, as opposed to how they were portrayed <br/>\nin ideal. Conlan recreates the experience of war from the perspective <br/>\nof one warrior, and then reconstructs how war was fought through <br/>\nstatistical analysis of surviving casualty records.<br/>\nSTATE OF WAR also shows that the battles of the fourteenth century<br/>\nmark a watershed in Japanese history. The fiscal exigencies of waging <br/>\nwar led to a devolution of political power to the provinces. <br/>\nFurthermore, the outbreak of war caused social status to become <br/>\nperformative, based upon the ability to fight autonomously, rather <br/>\nthan being prescriptive, or determined by edicts of investiture.<br/>\nThis work bridges the intellectual gulf between the fourteenth and<br/>\ntwentieth centuries by exploring how the seemingly contradictory<br/>\ncategories of religion and war were integrally related. The <br/>\nfourteenth-century belief that the outcome of battle was determined <br/>\nby the gods meant that religious institutions warred both ritually and<br/>\nphysically, and that religious attitudes frequently underpinned <br/>\nwarrior behavior.<br/>\nBased on diverse sources, including documents, picture scrolls,<br/>\nmedical and religious texts, and chronicles, STATE OF WAR <br/>\nrehabilitates warfare as a focal point of historical inquiry and <br/>\nprovides a fascinating new overview of premodern Japanese history.</div>",
