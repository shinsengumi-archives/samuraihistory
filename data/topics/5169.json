In 1554, he used spies to spread <br/>\nrumors about a certain Era Fusahide, who was a skilled and powerful <br/>\nvassal of Sue Harukata, saying that he was intending to turn against <br/>\nSue, and join the Mori.  Then Mori Motonari sent a <br/>\nletter &quot;discussing&quot; an offer to join the Mori to Fusahide, which was <br/>\nintercepted by Sue Harukata.  With this letter and the rumors spread <br/>\nby Mori spies, Harukata had Fusahide excecuted, and this took a <br/>\nstrong ally of Sue Harukata out of the picture for Motonari.</div>",

Ieyasu was the <br/>\nonly Daimyo who refused the &quot;inviation&quot;, so Hideyoshi was stuck with <br/>\na choice - Does he attack Ieyasu, or find another way to get him <br/>\nto &quot;submit&quot;?  Hideyoshi&#39;s choice was to send his own mother to <br/>\nIeyasu, essentially as a hostage.  Today I was watching a TV show <br/>\nthat I had taped a few days ago called - &quot;Kono Hito o Miyo - Toyotomi <br/>\nHideyoshi&quot; which covered the incedent.  It basicaly said that <br/>\nHideyoshi was a master at reading people.  It stated that Hideyoshi <br/>\nknew that Ieyasu was taken from his own mother at a very young age, <br/>\nand that because of this he would take care of Hideyoshi&#39;s mother.  <br/>\nThe incedent you mentioned happened while his mother was at <br/>\nHamamatsu, although the TV show didnt mention it - it was brought up <br/>\non the Samurai Forum a few days ago.  Basically, Ieyasu showed up at <br/>\nOsaka castle, and everyone saw this as a significant event showing <br/>\nthat Ieyasu was submitting to Hideyoshi.  So Hideyoshi basically won <br/>\nwithout fighting, and his mother came back without a scratch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I dont understand the reason the the other daimyo didnt <br/>\nsee Hideyoshi&#39;s mother going to Hamamatsu as Hideyoshi submitting to <br/>\nIeyasu, particularly because it was very well known how greatly <br/>\nHideyoshi cared about his mother....</div>",

Of<br/>\ncourse there were covert messages between Katsuyori<br/>\nand said administrator. Incidentally, it&#39;s killing me<br/>\nthat I can&#39;t remember his name. For some reason Ota<br/>\nYasusuke sticks in my head, but that&#39;s wrong--Yasusuke<br/>\nwas a Hojo retainer. I&#39;m currently not able to get to<br/>\nmy crutch, the Turnbull book on Nagashino, and when<br/>\nthe first hit on Google that comes up is a report that<br/>\nI myself wrote (and neglected to mention the name),<br/>\nI&#39;m out of luck. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I know, I know ... I think the reality is a lot<br/>\n&gt; more drab and <br/>\n&gt; dreary than we would like, with the occasional<br/>\n&gt; flashes of <br/>\n&gt; adventure!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Generally I find reality more interesting. I&#39;d rather<br/>\nread about how someone bribed the maid of Lord<br/>\nso-and-so to gain access to a room where they<br/>\noverheard x conversation, then snuck out dressed as a<br/>\nmonk and such, than to hear some silly story about<br/>\nsneaking in dressed in black pajamas, killing guards<br/>\nwith magical incantations, then disappearing in a<br/>\ncloud of smoke. Bah.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the Cold War days wasn&#39;t &#39;journalist&#39; the <br/>\n&gt; common cover? I suppose a Tendai Monk walking the<br/>\n&gt; streets of Prague or Vienna to the Harry Lime theme <br/>\n&gt; would have stuck out a bit...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Possibly, yeah. However, speaking as a member of the<br/>\nUS Intel community, the &quot;journalist&quot; cover is frowned<br/>\nupon, though it was used. Too easy to get into<br/>\ntrouble. At least you didn&#39;t say Red Cross worker or<br/>\nPriest--both of those are right out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Exploding Geisha? I&#39;d pay Y1500 for that ticket!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And Tom Cruise could play Shingen!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re trying to give me a heart attack, aren&#39;t you? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

At Yoshida-jo, it was too well defended for<br/>\na quick siege, and Katsuyori was afraid of the<br/>\nreinforcements coming up from Nobunaga. Nagashino,<br/>\nhowever, was too good to pass up, with the personal<br/>\nhistory between the Takeda and the keeper of the<br/>\ncastle for the Tokugawa. Katsuyori could have simply<br/>\nretreated back into Kai--he wasn&#39;t &quot;maneuvered&quot; into<br/>\nfighting at Nagashino by Ieyasu, per se. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, as Paul pointed out an age ago (hi Paul)<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a scene <br/>\n&gt; in Kagemusha where 3 peasants (in the employ of the<br/>\n&gt; Oda and <br/>\n&gt; the Tokugawa) are watching &#39;Shingen&#39; review his<br/>\n&gt; troops and are <br/>\n&gt; convinced it is he, which is the report that goes<br/>\n&gt; back to HQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>2 peasants and a monk, actually. THESE are true<br/>\n&quot;shinobi no mono&quot; or &quot;kusa&quot;. I&#39;d LOVE to do research<br/>\non the intell techniques of the sengoku, but man,<br/>\nwould I have to dig for resources...maybe this new<br/>\nRekishi Gunzo K is talking about...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No doubt Hollywood would have them attempt to<br/>\n&gt; assassinate <br/>\n&gt; Shingen with blow darts, exploding geisha, or<br/>\n&gt; something of that <br/>\n&gt; ilk.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exploding Geisha? I&#39;d pay Y1500 for that ticket!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

Presumably <br/>\nTakeda &#39;ninja&#39; were working the subversion operation, and <br/>\nTokugawa &#39;ninja&#39; were working counter-insurgency? Or am I <br/>\nbeing over-romantic?<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch being the case, the Tokugawa managed to manouvre the <br/>\nTakeda into overplaying their hand, as it were, which might be <br/>\ncounted as a highly successful ninja operation, based on sound <br/>\nintelligence rather than assassinations, wall-climbings, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise the eventual seppuku of Tokugawa Hideyasu was <br/>\nbrought about by a &#39;plot&#39; that was believed unlikely (by Sadler, <br/>\nanyway), but was considered a necessary expedient by Ieyasu to <br/>\nsecure the Oda-Tokugawa alliance. Might this not have been a <br/>\nplot to destabilise the two, and where would history have gone <br/>\nif they had fought each other?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, as Paul pointed out an age ago (hi Paul) there&#39;s a scene <br/>\nin Kagemusha where 3 peasants (in the employ of the Oda and <br/>\nthe Tokugawa) are watching &#39;Shingen&#39; review his troops and are <br/>\nconvinced it is he, which is the report that goes back to HQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo doubt Hollywood would have them attempt to assassinate <br/>\nShingen with blow darts, exploding geisha, or something of that <br/>\nilk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas.</div>",
