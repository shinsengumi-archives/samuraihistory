You <br/>\ncan give yourself a good slice but that would be the limit unless you <br/>\ndid something really swift and dropped it and the tried to catch it! Get <br/>\nhold of some well sharpened carpenters tools or microtomes and then you <br/>\nwill now how sharp is sharp. I like old American chisels or the new <br/>\nJapanese chisels, they are both high carbon steel that will take a great <br/>\nedge. They have planing contests in Japan where they try to remove the <br/>\nthinnest, most consistent shaving and in the old days they would pin <br/>\nsuch things up in wood shops in the US.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J.
