It&#39;s the best ww2 movie ever made... there&#39;s no close second. It&#39;s based on actual events, too. The interviews with the actual guys who were there are pretty good, too. But remember it&#39;s a ten part miniseries, with hour long episodes.  So rent it and watch a couple of the episodes a night, and you&#39;ll knock it out pretty quick. Sounds really good on surround sound, too. But there aren&#39;t any japanese in it if I remember right... it happens on the European front...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are 7 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       1.

By this point Japan has been<br/>\n&gt; mucking about in Korea and China for decades and showing their talent<br/>\n&gt; for colonial administration. I.E. virtually none. Previous to this they<br/>\n&gt; had already attacked Americans, read up on the Panay. These actions and<br/>\n&gt; others lead to the embargoes and other sanctions. Military dictatorships<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t make good neighbors and are generally poor at diplomacy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I also feel that the US has to bear a good portion of the blame -<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you have to remember that the Japanese people&#39;s only experience of the US<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was being forced to trade at gunpoint, and the US invasion of Hawaii because<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they were holding a referendum which would have made Hawaii a Japanese, not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;American, state.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The original treaty also dealt with treating shipwrecked sailors like<br/>\n&gt; humans and other things along those lines, this is close to 90 years<br/>\n&gt; before, I&#39;ve never heard of the referendum to make Hawaii a Japanese<br/>\n&gt; state, I doubt it would have come close to passing since the number of<br/>\n&gt; anglos, Hawaiians and Chinese far exceeded the number of Japanese on the<br/>\n&gt; island. Even if just the Hawaiians voted, they felt they could stay an<br/>\n&gt; independent country at the time. The US backed coup came as an<br/>\n&gt; unpleasant surprise. P.S. Look up the difference in the US between a<br/>\n&gt; territory and a state, It took about 60 years for Hawaii to become a state.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Plus in nearby Phillipines they had seen the Americans<br/>\n&gt; &gt;invade the islands and then keep it as a colony. Are they the actions of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;state that you would trust in their position?? I suppose it is little wonder<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that no diplomatic solution was ever reached.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; We were late to the colonial game, so we got the leftovers that the UK,<br/>\n&gt; France and Germany didn&#39;t want. We should have freed them like we did<br/>\n&gt; with Cuba. This still has little bearing on Japan&#39;s actions, they were<br/>\n&gt; an aggressive, expansionist, military dictatorship that had set out to<br/>\n&gt; conquer Asia, this would have lead to war no matter what and the US<br/>\n&gt; tried diplomatic means to prevent it including not going to war over<br/>\n&gt; attacking US citizens and soldiers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In some ways these does show samurai spirit, a bunch of bloody minded<br/>\n&gt; killers who are going to take what they want and only understand force<br/>\n&gt; as an argument. Which makes them no different from their European<br/>\n&gt; counterparts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2004 14:54:52 +0300<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:edy@...\">edy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Tsuruga-jo and other forgotten castles<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey all,<br/>\n&gt; Can you tell me more about castles like Tsuruga-jo,Hirosaki-jo.....<br/>\n&gt; Please!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Edy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2004 08:40:52 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: Dave Jackson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontonut@...\">nihontonut@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: OT? = Re: WWII... why?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree with Nate Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers are great, Two others <br/>\n&gt; I liked were Enemy at the Gates as well as Stalingrad.<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Nate Ledbetter <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, April 14, 2004 1:48 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: OT? = Re: [samuraihistory] WWII... why?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Windtalker was hideous.
