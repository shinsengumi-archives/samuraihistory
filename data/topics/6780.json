Were<br/>\nthey essentially interchangable? Why has samurai become the most<br/>\ncommonly used term these days, when most of the history books I have use<br/>\nthe term bushi, and you&#39;d think with all the nonsense out there about<br/>\nbushido that bushi would be the one people would be most familiar with?<br/>\nDoes samurai simply sound &quot;cooler&quot; and more Japanese?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nAngus<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
