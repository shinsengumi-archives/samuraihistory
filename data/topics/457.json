            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1073421834\">Dear O&#39;Keefe,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe samurai were well aware of the The Art of War from well before the <br/>\nSengoku era.  Though the exact entry date into Japan is unclear, the work <br/>\nattributed to Sun-Tzu (as well as the other 6 Chinese Military texts from <br/>\nancient China) were extant in Japan at least by the 12th century.  Of <br/>\ncourse, these texts came to Japan in their original classical Chinese form, <br/>\nwhich was unreadable to most.  Only those people with &quot;classical&quot; education <br/>\nwould have had any chance to read them.  Before the Tokugawa era it was only <br/>\nthe select few, (e.g. - Imagawa Ryoshun, Kusunoki Masashige) who were <br/>\nerudite enough warriors to have a chance to have read them for themselves.  <br/>\nThese men were generals -- great leaders of men -- and in that sense a bit <br/>\ncloser to the courtiers in terms of education.  As for the more &quot;common&quot; <br/>\nfighting men, though they may have learned of the strategic principles <br/>\ninculcated in Sun-Tzu and the like, there was almost no possibility for them <br/>\nto have read them individually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard recently, though, that by the 15th century there existed a sort of <br/>\n&quot;cheat book&quot; (Japanese name escapes me) -- similar to the books we have <br/>\nnowadays of useful quotations -- that had commonly quoted sayings from <br/>\nChinese classics (Military, Confucian and otherwise) as well as works of <br/>\nJapanese &quot;high&quot; literature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that in his book _The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China_, <br/>\nRalph Sawyer mentions that there is info in Samuel Griffith&#39;s translation of <br/>\nthe Sun-Tzu about its dissemination into Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;O&#39;Keefe&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Viva77@...\">Viva77@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory]<br/>\nDate: Thu, 13 Dec 2001 20:51:40 -0500<br/>\n<br/>\nHello.
