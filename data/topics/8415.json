Though the policy of  <br/>\nisolation was Bakufu policy, the Tokugawa government was more engaged  <br/>\nwith and better informed of the outside world that the Imperial court  <br/>\nin 1853. For years they had traded with the Dutch, kept up on  <br/>\ndevelopments in Europe and even sponsored schools of Western studies.<br/>\n\tAfter the coming of Perry, they were loathe to trade with the West  <br/>\nbut saw few alternatives, they chose to accomodate the Foreign powers  <br/>\nuntil they could stand on equal footing and perhaps drive them out.  <br/>\n(No one in Japan really wanted the Foreigners there) The Court  <br/>\nhowever, insisted that the Bakufu fulfill its mandate and immediately  <br/>\ndrive them out. When they chose not to do so, many in the country saw  <br/>\nthis as treason against the emperor and perhaps sensing weakness  <br/>\nbegan calling for the expulsion of Foreigners and the Restoration of  <br/>\nthe Emperor.<br/>\n\tMany of the most xenophobic Shishi did not live to see the  <br/>\nRestoration, those that did had to either adapt or be left behind. In  <br/>\nthe end the pragmatists within the new government chose the same  <br/>\npolicy as that of the Tokugawa; to accomodate the Foreigners, learn  <br/>\nall that they could from the West and then use Western technology to  <br/>\ndrive the barbarians out. They nearly succeed, but by the time of the  <br/>\nGreat Pacific War their dream had become so twisted, and they so  <br/>\ncorrupt it could never last.<br/>\n\tYou are forgetting BTW, my favorite, Hitokiri Hanjiro, who later  <br/>\nbecame known as Kirino Toshiaki...<br/>\n-t</div>",
