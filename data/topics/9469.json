I don&#39;t know where you&#39;d find<br/>\nmuch more than a couple of paragraphs written about him in an<br/>\nEnglish-language history book though, as most of the focus on the Taira<br/>\nclan is generally centred on his father. He was, like most of the other<br/>\nTaira clan members, a nobleman more than a general.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere are a number of passages involving Shigemori in the Heike<br/>\nMonogatari (Tale of the Heike), and there&#39;s a great translation from<br/>\nHelen McCullough available from most online bookstores and probably some<br/>\nlibraries as well. The historical accuracy of the Heike Monogatri is<br/>\nquestionable to say the least, but the image it paints of Shigemori has<br/>\nbecome commonly accepted, accurate or not.<br/>\n <br/>\n-AngusH<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
