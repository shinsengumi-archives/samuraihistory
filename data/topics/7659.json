His face is longer, his lips thinner, and his nose<br/>\nstraighter and more prominent than those of the lower class, and there<br/>\nis a difference in his manner and bearing. I have had a great deal of<br/>\ninteresting conversation with him.&quot;<br/>\nAlthough the class has gone, the author notes on a couple of occasions<br/>\nthis difference in bearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other note is the stunning beauty of the countryside on the one<br/>\nhand, and the utter and abject squalor, poverty and misery of the<br/>\ngeneral rural population on the other. Full of interesting observation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
