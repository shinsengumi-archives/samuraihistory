Anyway, Nate et al, when I <br/>\nmentioned Uesugi it was with the three well publicized koshirae which <br/>\nhave good provenance to Kenshin. I said THESE are called <br/>\nUesugi-koshirae because it is a CATAGORY of sword, I think you&#39;ll find <br/>\nthat when someone as famous as Kenshin adopts this style many others <br/>\ndid as well. This is not that rare a thing to see. I refer you all to <br/>\nUchi-gatana Koshirae, a catalog from a Tokyo National Museum exhibition <br/>\ndrawn from their extensive holdings. There you will find a number of <br/>\nexamples contemporary to the age of War. And as someone much more <br/>\nknowledgeable than I said on the same subject, &quot;There was no other <br/>\nreason to own a sword in the Sengoku period but for fighting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-t</div>",

Dressed as a man sporting a <br/>\ncrucifix, and a pair of gaudy swords, she was a huge hit. She founded a <br/>\nvery famous theatre tradition. I suggest that you do a search for her, <br/>\nI am sure you will get lots of wonderful info as well as the answer you <br/>\nseek.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  2. When did revenge killing become illegal, and what were the<br/>\n&gt;  penalties?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tNot sure it was outlawed but was highly &quot;legislated&quot; in the Tokugawa <br/>\nperiod. Under the right circumstances you could be rewarded for it. The <br/>\nAko-roshi are an excellent example, they did everything right but <br/>\nbecause at the very heart of their action was rebellion against the <br/>\nBakufu they were sentenced to death.<br/>\n\tSee &quot;Tales of Samurai Honour&quot; (by Callaghan I think it is) for some <br/>\ninteresting background and stories dealing with Adauchi.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  3. What would be the penalties for killing a shogun, and likely<br/>\n&gt;  repercussions politically of a shogun&#39;s murder?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See Nate&#39;s excellent post...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  4.

He is known to have cherished the work of <br/>\nBizen smiths and the great swordsmith Nagamitsu especially, he had <br/>\nseveral bona-fide blades. All mounted as tachi, all mounted WITHOUT <br/>\ntsuba. This style is not called aikuchi-koshirae which is used for <br/>\ntanto but rather Uesugi-koshirae. It was unusual but not unheard of. I <br/>\nthink one finds it easier to draw and return a sword of greater length <br/>\nwithout the tsuba and some have pointed to his example as evidence that <br/>\na tsuba is a &quot;hand stop and not a hand guard...&quot;<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also heard it said that many soldiers removed their guards <br/>\nbefore going into battle.</div>",

The penalty in that case was death,<br/>\nas it was for most offenses other than the extremely<br/>\ntrivial. Though if this is late-Sengoku, it depends on<br/>\nif there is an authority capable of enforcing the law.<br/>\nWould your character be punished by his own lord? It&#39;s<br/>\nperfectly conceivable that while in the late Sengoku<br/>\nthere was no Shogun capable of enforcing anything,<br/>\nthis particular person&#39;s daimyo could have a House Law<br/>\nagainst it, or something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. What would be the penalties for killing a shogun,<br/>\n&gt; and likely <br/>\n&gt; repercussions politically of a shogun&#39;s murder?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, where to begin...? It would depend on the<br/>\nsitutation, of course. I can think of 4 instances<br/>\nwhere the Shogun was assasinated/murdered/attacked and<br/>\nkilled: <br/>\n<br/>\nMinamoto Yoriie was the second Minamoto Shogun, but<br/>\nwas deposed and assasinated by his gradfather, Hojo<br/>\nTokimasa, in 1203. Tokimasa put Yoriie&#39;s brother<br/>\nSanetomo in the position. Yoriie didn&#39;t like being a<br/>\npuppet, so he was replaced. Sanetomo was in turn<br/>\nassasinated in 1219, by Yoriie&#39;s son or an unknown<br/>\nassailant, depending on whom you ask. The political<br/>\nfallout was that there were no more Minamoto to be<br/>\nnamed Shogun, so the Hojo regents first got two<br/>\nFujiwara, and then imperial princes to hold the<br/>\nposition, while they continued their actual control of<br/>\nthe bakufu as Shikken. <br/>\n<br/>\nAshikaga Yoshinori was assasinated in 1441, by<br/>\nAkamatsu Mitsusuke, a retainer who believed he was<br/>\ngoing to be deprived of his lands. He invited the<br/>\nShogun to a celebration, and had him assasinated<br/>\nduring the festivities. The bakufu reacted by<br/>\ncommisioning the Yamana family to destroy the<br/>\nAkamatsu, which they did, for the most part. The<br/>\nYamana gained all the Amako lands, and set themselves<br/>\nup as a major player in the bakufu, just in time for<br/>\nYamana Sozen to start the Onin War with his moves for<br/>\npower (The Shogun, at this point, was once again a<br/>\nlegitimizing tool for his &#39;vassal&#39; families to fight<br/>\nover, the strongest generally being named Kyoto<br/>\nKanrei). <br/>\n<br/>\nAshikaga Yoshiteru was assasinated by Matsunaga<br/>\nHisahide, a retainer of the Miyoshi clan at the time,<br/>\nwho themselves were former retainers of the Hosokawa,<br/>\nthe enemies of the Yamana in the Onin War. Yoshiteru,<br/>\nwhile a puppet like most of the others mentioned, did<br/>\nresist the Miyoshi, so they removed him by attacking<br/>\nhis palace in 1565. He held off the attackers<br/>\nadmirably for a while, then retired to commit seppuku.<br/>\nThe Miyoshi installed Ashikaga Yoshihide, only to be<br/>\nswept aside by Oda Nobunaga 3 years later, with<br/>\nYoshiaki. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll but one of these are instances of a puppet Shogun<br/>\nbeing killed by one faction so they could put their<br/>\npuppet, or at least a puppet more cooperative, in<br/>\nplace. If you&#39;re looking at the Shogun being a strong<br/>\nfigure, someone who might deserve to die in a revenge<br/>\nkilling, these examples might not help. If the Shogun<br/>\nruled rather than reigned, there would be a power<br/>\nvacuum while a successor was named, etc. If the<br/>\nsuccessor was young, a regent would be named, who<br/>\nwould probably be the strongest retainer. Conflict<br/>\nwould no doubt take place with other retainers who<br/>\nwere jealous...and you see the cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4.
