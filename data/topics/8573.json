But <br/>\n&gt; &gt; what did &quot;combat&quot; actually involve in those<br/>\n&gt; far-off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; days? It sure as <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hell wasn&#39;t like these neat roam-mat dojos we have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; today. They were <br/>\n&gt; &gt; fighting in the mountains, on riverbanks, tripping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over tree roots <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and stones. The weapons they used, swords...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spears... arrows... <br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything! You didn&#39;t even opponent would be on<br/>\n&gt; foot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he could have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; came at you on horseback! How effective would any<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our fancy <br/>\n&gt; &gt; modern sword styles have been, back then? While we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were still edging <br/>\n&gt; &gt; our toes forward gauging the distance between our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; swords... some <br/>\n&gt; &gt; armored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his spear!&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;And there are fools out there looking for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spirityuality in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the sword. Four hundred sword schools had opened<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a few years <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the founding of the shogunate. Four hundred!<br/>\n&gt; But<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that didn&#39;t mean <br/>\n&gt; &gt; swordsmanship was flourishing, it just means a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of bored samurai <br/>\n&gt; &gt; are selling their skills to buy rice. They can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; offer content so <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they babble about spirit. And to keep other<br/>\n&gt; schools<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from stealing <br/>\n&gt; &gt; their students--their moneybags--they cooked up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; useless &quot;secret <br/>\n&gt; &gt; techniques&quot; just so they&#39;ed look different from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other schools. Oh <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and god forbid those moneybags get hurt! Oh, no,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s face-guards! <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gloves! Body Armor! Light Bamboo Swords!

Save the dramatics for Steven<br/>\nSegal, he gets paid for it. You don&#39;t want to be<br/>\nstabbed, it doesn&#39;t feel nice. Believe me I have been.<br/>\nI&#39;m a former slum kid. Don&#39;t focus so much on being<br/>\nthought a tough person but rather a level headed one.<br/>\nNo offense but how old are you, man? Glory is just a<br/>\nword man and really nothing more.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!

It <br/>\nsure as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hell wasn&#39;t like these neat roam-mat dojos we have today. They <br/>\nwere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fighting in the mountains, on riverbanks, tripping over tree <br/>\nroots<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and stones. The weapons they used, swords... spears... arrows...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything! You didn&#39;t even opponent would be on foot he could have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; came at you on horseback! How effective would any of our fancy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; modern sword styles have been, back then? While we were still <br/>\nedging<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our toes forward gauging the distance between our swords... some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with his spear!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; \tTraining in the sword these days, at least with Iaido, is <br/>\nprimarily  <br/>\n&gt; training for encounters in an urban setting against one or a <br/>\nhandful  <br/>\n&gt; of attackers. If you are perceptive enough one can winnow out the  <br/>\n&gt; core combative techniques that would apply in a battlefield <br/>\nencounter.<br/>\n&gt; \tWe may train on flat level ground, most days, but what we <br/>\nare  <br/>\n&gt; building is a foundation for a proper cut delivered with all the  <br/>\n&gt; strength of the bodys&#39; musculature behind it. Technique discovered <br/>\non  <br/>\n&gt; the battlefield, but refined for generations by serious swordsmen.<br/>\n&gt; \tIt is easy enough to train in different settings, changing <br/>\nelements  <br/>\n&gt; like adding overhead obstructions, even so the &quot;programming&quot; <br/>\nshould  <br/>\n&gt; kick in and in spite of the obstruction the best possible strike <br/>\nwill  <br/>\n&gt; be delivered.<br/>\n&gt; \tThere are schools like the Yagyu Shingan ryu that practice  <br/>\n&gt; battlefield technique in armour, Their forms include strikes to <br/>\nthe  <br/>\n&gt; vulnerable areas of Japanese armour and grappling. I am certain <br/>\nthey  <br/>\n&gt; practice most of the time on flat level ground and probably use <br/>\nfoam  <br/>\n&gt; mats too. Few if any would argue that they are not authentic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;And there are fools out there looking for spirityuality in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the sword. Four hundred sword schools had opened up with a few <br/>\nyears<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the founding of the shogunate. Four hundred! But that didn&#39;t <br/>\nmean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; swordsmanship was flourishing, it just means a lot of bored <br/>\nsamurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are selling their skills to buy rice. They can&#39;t offer content so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they babble about spirit. And to keep other schools from stealing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their students--their moneybags--they cooked up useless &quot;secret<br/>\n&gt; &gt; techniques&quot; just so they&#39;ed look different from other schools. Oh<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and god forbid those moneybags get hurt! Oh, no, it&#39;s face-<br/>\nguards!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gloves! Body Armor! Light Bamboo Swords! So what do you wind up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with? Peacetime warriors who have never faced a naked blade; felt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the fear of death!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI believe that schools of swordsmanship followed similar <br/>\npaths of  <br/>\n&gt; development in other places. Combat techniques were refined and  <br/>\n&gt; stylized and the mystique of the swordsman grew in importance. I  <br/>\n&gt; think if you&#39;ll look deeply into the questions you raise here <br/>\nyou&#39;ll  <br/>\n&gt; see that among the 400 and more schools you mention that many have <br/>\nno  <br/>\n&gt; spiritual connections and teach only technique. Most place an  <br/>\n&gt; emphasis on etiquette as a means to guarantee  safety within the  <br/>\n&gt; dojo. However there are those that focus deeply on the teachings <br/>\nof  <br/>\n&gt; zen buddhism or connexions to Shinto gods. After-all many of the  <br/>\n&gt; great swordsmen at the end of the age of battles developed their  <br/>\n&gt; mastery in pursuit of spiritual development. I am not really sure <br/>\nhow  <br/>\n&gt; it is a bad thing to wish to behave in a gentlemanly fashion and <br/>\nto  <br/>\n&gt; seek to enrich ones spirit.<br/>\n&gt; \tThere are good and bad teachers, and unscrupulous people in <br/>\nall  <br/>\n&gt; ages. You have to choose your path carefully in all things. If <br/>\nyou  <br/>\n&gt; have lived in Japan then you will be familiar with the surprising  <br/>\n&gt; number of frauds and wannabees there, samurai culture is a <br/>\ncommodity  <br/>\n&gt; to some, even in the land of the samurai.<br/>\n&gt; \tIt seems that you have a poor opinion of Kendo as well. One <br/>\ncould  <br/>\n&gt; argue that many Kendo-ka today lack the spirit and physical <br/>\ntoughness  <br/>\n&gt; of the swordsmen of say the rough and tumble Bakumatsu period.  <br/>\n&gt; However if lyou ook closely at the practice today the top Kendo-<br/>\nka  <br/>\n&gt; demonstrate more speed, power and technique than has been seen  <br/>\n&gt; before. The rules and technique have been refined, and the <br/>\nathletes  <br/>\n&gt; groomed from childhood, in the same way as world-class sports  <br/>\n&gt; figures. Just as todays football players run, hit and throw <br/>\nbetter  <br/>\n&gt; than players past, todays top level Kendo-ka are arguably faster,  <br/>\n&gt; keener and stronger than their predecessors.<br/>\n&gt; \tOne wonders where Ijin you have faced a naked blade and the <br/>\nfear of  <br/>\n&gt; death? There is death everywhere even if we don&#39;t go about toting  <br/>\n&gt; swords any longer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;       I posted this to show one reason the samurai became weak <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the martial art people in the group. I&#39;d like to hear what you <br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tIf you know your history, you will know that throughout the <br/>\nperiod  <br/>\n&gt; we suppose the samurai as a class became weak, there were <br/>\nelements  <br/>\n&gt; within it that studied western science and military technology. <br/>\nThese  <br/>\n&gt; men and their students emerged as leaders with the strength of <br/>\nideas  <br/>\n&gt; to oppose western encroachment even as the upper structure of <br/>\nsamurai  <br/>\n&gt; society was collapsing.<br/>\n&gt; \tIn the world of swordsmanship also, there were fads and <br/>\nfashions but  <br/>\n&gt; it seems that the practical won out in the end; Jigen Ryu, <br/>\nHokushin  <br/>\n&gt; Itto Ryu and Eishin Ryu are known to us because their techniques <br/>\nwere  <br/>\n&gt; tested in the streets of Kyoto and on the battlefields of the  <br/>\n&gt; restoration war.<br/>\n&gt; \tMany of the restoration leaders were dojo mates or known to <br/>\neach  <br/>\n&gt; other from fencing cicles. So when the time came for strength, <br/>\nfor  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;men of spirit&quot; to lead the country they were to be found among <br/>\nthe  <br/>\n&gt; martial artists...<br/>\n&gt; -t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!

I myself use a spear in training sometimes, but a sword is just easyer to use (not all the time tho). As for the free-for-all after the Battle of Sekigahara the losers were hunted by the refugee hunters and they were just farmers and other villagers who village had been destoryed by the samurai fighting. So they really didnt care about one-on-one fights they justed wanted the rewards and must of them were armed with bamboo spears. And what I was talking about before was modern swordsmanship and how the poeple who study it would fair in a environment like that.

You are better off with either: a matchlock, a <br/>\nbow, a naginata, or a yari as your primary weapon. Also, free-for-alls <br/>\nare not something that classical and medieval strategists were <br/>\nparticularly fond of. Free-for-all approaches came about largely after <br/>\nthe development of modern firearms when tacticians realized that they <br/>\ndid not have to mass troops in order to mass strength. If you look at <br/>\nbattle paintings from Japan you will notice that unless a route is in <br/>\nprogress that you generally see troops on both sides drawn up in some <br/>\nsort of skirmish line or other. Incidentally, battle paintings from the <br/>\nSengogku period pretty clearly show massed formations using similar <br/>\nweapons. Think the battle scenes in Kagemusha except in 400 year old <br/>\npaintings. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",

But<br/>\n&gt; what did &quot;combat&quot; actually involve in those far-off days? It sure as<br/>\n&gt; hell wasn&#39;t like these neat roam-mat dojos we have today. They were<br/>\n&gt; fighting in the mountains, on riverbanks, tripping over tree roots<br/>\n&gt; and stones. The weapons they used, swords... spears... arrows...<br/>\n&gt; anything! You didn&#39;t even opponent would be on foot he could have<br/>\n&gt; came at you on horseback! How effective would any of our fancy<br/>\n&gt; modern sword styles have been, back then? While we were still edging<br/>\n&gt; our toes forward gauging the distance between our swords... some<br/>\n&gt; armored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with his spear!&quot;<br/>\n\tTraining in the sword these days, at least with Iaido, is primarily  <br/>\ntraining for encounters in an urban setting against one or a handful  <br/>\nof attackers. If you are perceptive enough one can winnow out the  <br/>\ncore combative techniques that would apply in a battlefield encounter.<br/>\n\tWe may train on flat level ground, most days, but what we are  <br/>\nbuilding is a foundation for a proper cut delivered with all the  <br/>\nstrength of the bodys&#39; musculature behind it. Technique discovered on  <br/>\nthe battlefield, but refined for generations by serious swordsmen.<br/>\n\tIt is easy enough to train in different settings, changing elements  <br/>\nlike adding overhead obstructions, even so the &quot;programming&quot; should  <br/>\nkick in and in spite of the obstruction the best possible strike will  <br/>\nbe delivered.<br/>\n\tThere are schools like the Yagyu Shingan ryu that practice  <br/>\nbattlefield technique in armour, Their forms include strikes to the  <br/>\nvulnerable areas of Japanese armour and grappling. I am certain they  <br/>\npractice most of the time on flat level ground and probably use foam  <br/>\nmats too. Few if any would argue that they are not authentic.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;       &quot;And there are fools out there looking for spirityuality in<br/>\n&gt; the sword. Four hundred sword schools had opened up with a few years<br/>\n&gt; of the founding of the shogunate. Four hundred! But that didn&#39;t mean<br/>\n&gt; swordsmanship was flourishing, it just means a lot of bored samurai<br/>\n&gt; are selling their skills to buy rice. They can&#39;t offer content so<br/>\n&gt; they babble about spirit. And to keep other schools from stealing<br/>\n&gt; their students--their moneybags--they cooked up useless &quot;secret<br/>\n&gt; techniques&quot; just so they&#39;ed look different from other schools. Oh<br/>\n&gt; and god forbid those moneybags get hurt! Oh, no, it&#39;s face-guards!<br/>\n&gt; Gloves! Body Armor! Light Bamboo Swords! So what do you wind up<br/>\n&gt; with? Peacetime warriors who have never faced a naked blade; felt<br/>\n&gt; the fear of death!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI believe that schools of swordsmanship followed similar paths of  <br/>\ndevelopment in other places. Combat techniques were refined and  <br/>\nstylized and the mystique of the swordsman grew in importance. I  <br/>\nthink if you&#39;ll look deeply into the questions you raise here you&#39;ll  <br/>\nsee that among the 400 and more schools you mention that many have no  <br/>\nspiritual connections and teach only technique. Most place an  <br/>\nemphasis on etiquette as a means to guarantee  safety within the  <br/>\ndojo. However there are those that focus deeply on the teachings of  <br/>\nzen buddhism or connexions to Shinto gods. After-all many of the  <br/>\ngreat swordsmen at the end of the age of battles developed their  <br/>\nmastery in pursuit of spiritual development. I am not really sure how  <br/>\nit is a bad thing to wish to behave in a gentlemanly fashion and to  <br/>\nseek to enrich ones spirit.<br/>\n\tThere are good and bad teachers, and unscrupulous people in all  <br/>\nages. You have to choose your path carefully in all things. If you  <br/>\nhave lived in Japan then you will be familiar with the surprising  <br/>\nnumber of frauds and wannabees there, samurai culture is a commodity  <br/>\nto some, even in the land of the samurai.<br/>\n\tIt seems that you have a poor opinion of Kendo as well. One could  <br/>\nargue that many Kendo-ka today lack the spirit and physical toughness  <br/>\nof the swordsmen of say the rough and tumble Bakumatsu period.  <br/>\nHowever if lyou ook closely at the practice today the top Kendo-ka  <br/>\ndemonstrate more speed, power and technique than has been seen  <br/>\nbefore. The rules and technique have been refined, and the athletes  <br/>\ngroomed from childhood, in the same way as world-class sports  <br/>\nfigures. Just as todays football players run, hit and throw better  <br/>\nthan players past, todays top level Kendo-ka are arguably faster,  <br/>\nkeener and stronger than their predecessors.<br/>\n\tOne wonders where Ijin you have faced a naked blade and the fear of  <br/>\ndeath? There is death everywhere even if we don&#39;t go about toting  <br/>\nswords any longer.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;       I posted this to show one reason the samurai became weak and<br/>\n&gt; the martial art people in the group. I&#39;d like to hear what you think<br/>\n&gt; about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf you know your history, you will know that throughout the period  <br/>\nwe suppose the samurai as a class became weak, there were elements  <br/>\nwithin it that studied western science and military technology. These  <br/>\nmen and their students emerged as leaders with the strength of ideas  <br/>\nto oppose western encroachment even as the upper structure of samurai  <br/>\nsociety was collapsing.<br/>\n\tIn the world of swordsmanship also, there were fads and fashions but  <br/>\nit seems that the practical won out in the end; Jigen Ryu, Hokushin  <br/>\nItto Ryu and Eishin Ryu are known to us because their techniques were  <br/>\ntested in the streets of Kyoto and on the battlefields of the  <br/>\nrestoration war.<br/>\n\tMany of the restoration leaders were dojo mates or known to each  <br/>\nother from fencing cicles. So when the time came for strength, for  <br/>\n&quot;men of spirit&quot; to lead the country they were to be found among the  <br/>\nmartial artists...<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; YAHOO!
