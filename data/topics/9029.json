Berry&#39;s book does <br/>\n&gt; discuss somewhat the Korean invasions, but the author does not go into <br/>\n&gt; intricate detail of the Korean invasions. She does not focus on blow by blow of the <br/>\n&gt; battles in Korea. She focuses far more on the battles within Japan to <br/>\n&gt; consolidate Hideyoshi&#39;s power over Japan itself, and his forming alliances within <br/>\n&gt; Japan. She also focuses more on when Hideyoshi was willing to show clemency <br/>\n&gt; even with defeated foes, like Chosokabe Motochika in Shikoku and Sassa Narimasa <br/>\n&gt; in Hokuriku. (Of course, the clemency toward Sassa didn’t last long, as he <br/>\n&gt; was forced to commit suicide some time later.) She also of course describes <br/>\n&gt; the more brutal, ruthless side of Hideyoshi, where he defeats and destroys <br/>\n&gt; Shibata Katsuie, and others. She also spends time discussing the social <br/>\n&gt; transformation of the disarming of the peasants and monks, as well as the stripping <br/>\n&gt; the samurai of their land. She describes how all of these moves were designed <br/>\n&gt; to stabilize the country by making rebellion by peasants and monks less <br/>\n&gt; likely. Also, by stripping samurai of land, the samurai themselves became more dep<br/>\n&gt; endent on their lords and daimyo, also making samurai less likely to make <br/>\n&gt; trouble independent of their daimyo. So the daimyo gave up some independence to <br/>\n&gt; Hideyoshi as the supreme central power, but the daimyo also acquired a certain <br/>\n&gt; new power vis-à-vis those peasants and samurai below them on the social <br/>\n&gt; hierarchy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you have a particular interest in Korea, or in those particular Japanese <br/>\n&gt; invasions of Korea?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; www.nihonshi. www<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 8/11/2006, &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BURKER1@...\">BURKER1@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BURKER1@...\">BURKER1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Mike,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How much coverage does the book give to the Imjin War (the Japanese<br/>\n&gt; &gt;invasion of Korea)?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bob Burke<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In a message dated 8/10/06 4:07:35 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tokyodog@...\">tokyodog@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The Japan history reading group, Nihonshi, has just completed reading the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tale of Genji.

When that ended we installed a<br/>\nlarger exhibition at the Hamilton Art Gallery also in country Victoria.  To look<br/>\nat pictures of the Hamilton exhibition please go to:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/hamilton/hamilton_2006.html\">http://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/hamilton/hamilton_2006.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe swords on exhibition range from ca1260 to ca1860, all found in Victoria and<br/>\nprofessionally restored in Japan by a top artisan.  Each sword has been examined<br/>\nby eminent scholars of the Nihonto at the NBTHK sword museum in Tokyo and<br/>\nawarded a &quot;paper&quot; certifying its authenticity and art-level (there are 4 ranks<br/>\nof &quot;paper&quot;).  This is the largest ever exhibition of properly restored and<br/>\nauthenticated Japanese art swords ever held in the Southern Hemisphere.  There<br/>\nis also a link to the Hamilton Art Gallery itself, and a link to a downloadable<br/>\npdf catalogue - the Gallery are currently charging $5 for the catalogues they<br/>\nhave...<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to publicly thank and acknowledge the expertise of our mate in<br/>\ncollecting, Richard Turner in Perth, for his fantastic help in setting these<br/>\nimages up for sharing with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas.</div>",
