The show, which is set in <br/>\nthe Edo period, is not a true historical title, but features action, <br/>\nadventure, and some comedy blended with an anachronistic hip-hop <br/>\nsoundtrack. Its name comes from the Okinawan word, &quot;champuru&quot; (e.g. <br/>\ngoya champuru), which means to mix or blend. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Watanabe started with Cowboy Bebop he now continues with <br/>\nSamurai Champloo. He has created a new genre by implementing a hip-<br/>\nhop theme into this title, much like Cowboy Bebop had a blues and <br/>\njazz theme. The score is composed of hip-hop beats by Japanese hip-<br/>\nhop artists Nujabes and Tsutchie among others, although the hip-hop <br/>\ninfluence is mostly subtle. Some samurai sport Adidas-like stripe <br/>\npatterns on their kimonos, while one of the main characters, Mugen, <br/>\nhas a capoeira-esque fighting style. The show has many other <br/>\nanachronistic elements as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe show revolves around three characters: The brash and lanky <br/>\nvagabond Mugen, the quiet and stoic ronin Jin, and the cute and <br/>\nquick-thinking waitress Fuu. Fuu helps Mugen and Jin escape from a <br/>\nvengeful daimyo and, in exchange, she persuades the two to help her <br/>\nin her search for a mysterious samurai who smells like sunflowers <br/>\nwith a coin toss. She will have trouble keeping the two from killing <br/>\neach other, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeneon Entertainment licensed the show for distribution in the <br/>\nUnited States nearly a full year prior to the show&#39;s airing in <br/>\nJapan. This decision was based almost solely on the reputation of <br/>\nits creator, Shinichiro Watanabe. On January 20, 2004, it was <br/>\nrevealed that the broadcasting rights were acquired by Cartoon <br/>\nNetwork, and the series began airing on the Adult Swim block on May <br/>\n14, 2005, in the 11:30 PM timeslot. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a manga adaptation of Samurai Champloo that debuted in <br/>\nShonen Ace in January 2004.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n--- <br/>\nYahoo!
