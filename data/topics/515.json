My suggestion to Scott would be to attack<br/>\nthe subject one topic at a time, for example if you<br/>\nwant to start with military history then you can pick<br/>\nup one of Osprey?s men at arms books. Good primers,<br/>\nwhich is what it sounds like you are interested in.<br/>\nThe book that got me into the military history of<br/>\nJapan is ?Arms and Armor of the Samurai?. <br/>\nIf, however you just want a general overview of the<br/>\nentire history of Japan then ?Japan, its history and<br/>\nculture,? by W. Scott Morton is reasonable.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;I do not think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday.&quot;<br/>\n-Abraham Lincoln<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
