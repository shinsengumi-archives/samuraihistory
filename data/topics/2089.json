Then 20<br/>\n&gt; years later when some people have done serious<br/>\n&gt; research to fix the problem you get sites like<br/>\n&gt; www.entertheninja.com sprouting up and sites made by<br/>\n&gt; 15 year old school boy wannabe ninja&#39;s and every one<br/>\n&gt; reads these and they must be real - I mean why would<br/>\n&gt; any one make a false web page.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The truth of the matter is Iga and Koga were the main<br/>\n&gt; areas of development. some fo these &#39;clans&#39; did sell<br/>\n&gt; thesleves out per contract, then there were some<br/>\n&gt; schools that were created within a samurai domain and<br/>\n&gt; was either made up of samurai or peasents. picked for<br/>\n&gt; certain skills they had or were told to develop. many<br/>\n&gt; of these schools survived for several generation many<br/>\n&gt; were only in existance for a small number of years. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; some of them did have codes of ethics, some didnt.<br/>\n&gt; some used there skills to be cat burglers, after all<br/>\n&gt; some ninjutsu skills required the skill to enter a<br/>\n&gt; building and escape unseen. Then you have the ninja<br/>\n&gt; that were information gatherers. Kagemusha by kurosawa<br/>\n&gt; is a great film to see this. there is a scene where 3<br/>\n&gt; men are watching the samurai army. All dressed in<br/>\n&gt; common every day cloths watching from a distance. all<br/>\n&gt; from different clans. some of these guys couldnt even<br/>\n&gt; fight properly other than the same skills of the<br/>\n&gt; everyday man or samurai. and before any one asks.<br/>\n&gt; Ninja did not run around wearing black suits with<br/>\n&gt; masks.

And I didn&#39;t mean to paint a <br/>\npicture that ALL Samurai were honorable and followed Bushido, many <br/>\nwere &quot;dirty&quot; samurai, whether they were ronin-criminals, or high <br/>\nranking corrupt officials. But most samurai followed Bushido and <br/>\nwere the &quot;ideal&quot; samurai most think of today. I also didn&#39;t mean to <br/>\nsay ALL ninjas were underhanded, deceitful, and un-honorable. But <br/>\nmost samurai thought this, hence most were &quot;bitter enemies&quot; with <br/>\nninjas.  Now we all know that ninjas were employed by samurai, and <br/>\nif they did have some kind of code they followed (anyone know the <br/>\nname?) they were still cast in a negative light by samurai, for <br/>\ninstance if a ninja was sent to assassinate someone, they would <br/>\ncertainly seek up on the victim and quietly dispose of him, which is <br/>\nquite understandable. However this goes against Bushido, you should <br/>\ndeclare your presence, challenge your opponent, then fight him in <br/>\none-on-one combat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also sure ninjas casted samurai in a negative light as well. <br/>\nGenerally ninjas were not of samurai class, (anyone know any <br/>\nexceptions?) they were made up of the other classes, since they <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t become samurai, they trained and became ninjas instead, and <br/>\nI&#39;m sure being oppressed by the samurai class led to animosity <br/>\ntowards them, therefore once again, &quot;bitter enemies.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dnastaj&quot; &lt;dnastaj@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Weren&#39;t some ninja&#39;s (shinobi?) servants of hans?

Then 20<br/>\nyears later when some people have done serious<br/>\nresearch to fix the problem you get sites like<br/>\nwww.entertheninja.com sprouting up and sites made by<br/>\n15 year old school boy wannabe ninja&#39;s and every one<br/>\nreads these and they must be real - I mean why would<br/>\nany one make a false web page.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth of the matter is Iga and Koga were the main<br/>\nareas of development. some fo these &#39;clans&#39; did sell<br/>\nthesleves out per contract, then there were some<br/>\nschools that were created within a samurai domain and<br/>\nwas either made up of samurai or peasents. picked for<br/>\ncertain skills they had or were told to develop. many<br/>\nof these schools survived for several generation many<br/>\nwere only in existance for a small number of years. <br/>\n<br/>\nsome of them did have codes of ethics, some didnt.<br/>\nsome used there skills to be cat burglers, after all<br/>\nsome ninjutsu skills required the skill to enter a<br/>\nbuilding and escape unseen. Then you have the ninja<br/>\nthat were information gatherers. Kagemusha by kurosawa<br/>\nis a great film to see this. there is a scene where 3<br/>\nmen are watching the samurai army. All dressed in<br/>\ncommon every day cloths watching from a distance. all<br/>\nfrom different clans. some of these guys couldnt even<br/>\nfight properly other than the same skills of the<br/>\neveryday man or samurai. and before any one asks.<br/>\nNinja did not run around wearing black suits with<br/>\nmasks. That is a Meiji period Myth.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at a street scene out of a kurosawa movie.<br/>\nImagine someone dressed in pure black in the middle of<br/>\nthat. he would be as moticeable as if he were naked.<br/>\nthe men in kagemusha are a good example of the way<br/>\nNinja dresssed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome records by ninja have survived - Shoninki -<br/>\nNinpiden - Bansenshukai.

The Kamihattori fled to<br/>\nNagaoka in Echigo Hattori Masanari, and his son <br/>\nHattori Hanzo (both from the Kamihattori), swore<br/>\nallegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while working for<br/>\nthe Tokugawa held the rank of &#39;Shinobi Metsuke&#39;, and<br/>\nhe had served Ieyasu&#39;s grandfather Matsudaira<br/>\nKiyoyasu. Hanzo later, with a friend, Shiro Tarao who<br/>\nwas a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa Ieyasu flee across<br/>\nJapan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely,<br/>\nutilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting up<br/>\nspecial defensive formations along the road, and by<br/>\nusing Ninja methods of running. This all helped the<br/>\nTokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. The Hattori<br/>\nwere not &quot;Watari Ninja&quot; (Ninja who moved around from<br/>\none Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the<br/>\nTokugawa, and remained in their service for many<br/>\ngenerations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at<br/>\nnight, Hanzo was young man of 16 years. For the skills<br/>\nthat he used during the battle, he earned himself a<br/>\ncommendation. He was given the name &quot;Hanzo the Ghost&quot;.<br/>\nEven Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the<br/>\nprovince of Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in<br/>\nuse. In his later years Hanzo was also known as &quot;Hanzo<br/>\nthe great lancer&quot; (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>\n<br/>\nHanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai,<br/>\nand then came to be known as &quot;Hattori Hanzo Iwami no<br/>\nKami&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him,<br/>\neach held the rank of Doshin. He developed problems<br/>\nwith these Ninja and he found it difficult to control<br/>\nthem, and he relieved them of their services. He then<br/>\nemployed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in<br/>\nhis life, he became a Monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHanzo Hattori was so famous that in the province of<br/>\nMikawa songs were written about him<br/>\n<br/>\nSome say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th<br/>\nDecember 1596, while trying to bring the Ninja of the<br/>\nFuma Ryu to justice. The date must be wrong as Hanzo<br/>\nhelped Ieyasu in the early 1600&quot;s. The story of his<br/>\ndeath says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding<br/>\nteeth), and his Fuma Ryu originally came from<br/>\nKanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and his men chased the<br/>\nFuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf of<br/>\nHanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of<br/>\nwater, and several swam under water, and began<br/>\ndismantling the rudders of the boats belonging to<br/>\nHanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo&#39;s men<br/>\ndecided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by<br/>\nshore. When they entered the water, they discovered<br/>\nthat the water was covered with oil. To which the Fuma<br/>\nRyu Ninja set fire, killing all of the Tokugawa<br/>\nSamurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\npaul Richardson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

He was given the name &quot;Hanzo the<br/>\n&gt; Ghost&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the<br/>\n&gt; province of Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; use. In his later years Hanzo was also known as<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hanzo<br/>\n&gt; the great lancer&quot; (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi<br/>\n&gt; Samurai,<br/>\n&gt; and then came to be known as &quot;Hattori Hanzo Iwami no<br/>\n&gt; Kami&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with<br/>\n&gt; him,<br/>\n&gt; each held the rank of Doshin. He developed problems<br/>\n&gt; with these Ninja and he found it difficult to<br/>\n&gt; control<br/>\n&gt; them, and he relieved them of their services. He<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in<br/>\n&gt; his life, he became a Monk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hanzo Hattori was so famous that in the province of<br/>\n&gt; Mikawa songs were written about him<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th<br/>\n&gt; December 1596, while trying to bring the Ninja of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must be wrong as Hanzo<br/>\n&gt; helped Ieyasu in the early 1600&quot;s. The story of his<br/>\n&gt; death says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two<br/>\n&gt; protruding<br/>\n&gt; teeth), and his Fuma Ryu originally came from<br/>\n&gt; Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and his men chased<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf of<br/>\n&gt; Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of<br/>\n&gt; water, and several swam under water, and began<br/>\n&gt; dismantling the rudders of the boats belonging to<br/>\n&gt; Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo&#39;s men<br/>\n&gt; decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by<br/>\n&gt; shore. When they entered the water, they discovered<br/>\n&gt; that the water was covered with oil. To which the<br/>\n&gt; Fuma<br/>\n&gt; Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the Tokugawa<br/>\n&gt; Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; paul Richardson<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

It is not fully known if he came from<br/>\nthe Heitaro or the Chigachi line (another branch of<br/>\nthe Kamihattori family).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the<br/>\nthree branches of the Hattori family dispersed to<br/>\ndifferent area&#39;s of Japan. The Kamihattori fled to<br/>\nNagaoka in Echigo Hattori Masanari, and his son <br/>\nHattori Hanzo (both from the Kamihattori), swore<br/>\nallegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while working for<br/>\nthe Tokugawa held the rank of &#39;Shinobi Metsuke&#39;, and<br/>\nhe had served Ieyasu&#39;s grandfather Matsudaira<br/>\nKiyoyasu. Hanzo later, with a friend, Shiro Tarao who<br/>\nwas a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa Ieyasu flee across<br/>\nJapan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely,<br/>\nutilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting up<br/>\nspecial defensive formations along the road, and by<br/>\nusing Ninja methods of running. This all helped the<br/>\nTokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. The Hattori<br/>\nwere not &quot;Watari Ninja&quot; (Ninja who moved around from<br/>\none Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the<br/>\nTokugawa, and remained in their service for many<br/>\ngenerations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at<br/>\nnight, Hanzo was young man of 16 years. For the skills<br/>\nthat he used during the battle, he earned himself a<br/>\ncommendation. He was given the name &quot;Hanzo the Ghost&quot;.<br/>\nEven Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the<br/>\nprovince of Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in<br/>\nuse. In his later years Hanzo was also known as &quot;Hanzo<br/>\nthe great lancer&quot; (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>\n<br/>\nHanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai,<br/>\nand then came to be known as &quot;Hattori Hanzo Iwami no<br/>\nKami&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him,<br/>\neach held the rank of Doshin. He developed problems<br/>\nwith these Ninja and he found it difficult to control<br/>\nthem, and he relieved them of their services. He then<br/>\nemployed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in<br/>\nhis life, he became a Monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHanzo Hattori was so famous that in the province of<br/>\nMikawa songs were written about him<br/>\n<br/>\nSome say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th<br/>\nDecember 1596, while trying to bring the Ninja of the<br/>\nFuma Ryu to justice. The date must be wrong as Hanzo<br/>\nhelped Ieyasu in the early 1600&quot;s. The story of his<br/>\ndeath says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding<br/>\nteeth), and his Fuma Ryu originally came from<br/>\nKanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and his men chased the<br/>\nFuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf of<br/>\nHanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of<br/>\nwater, and several swam under water, and began<br/>\ndismantling the rudders of the boats belonging to<br/>\nHanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo&#39;s men<br/>\ndecided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by<br/>\nshore. When they entered the water, they discovered<br/>\nthat the water was covered with oil. To which the Fuma<br/>\nRyu Ninja set fire, killing all of the Tokugawa<br/>\nSamurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\npaul Richardson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
