            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-161168191\">Hi Takezo-san,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks for the tips.  You have no idea how much that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My pleasure, knowledge is for sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes I think I have a rough idea of how much it helps, as having <br/>\nsomeone tell me this information when I started would have saved an <br/>\nawful lot of frustration!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about the last time I was involved in making some armour <br/>\nsimilar to this, a Kote (sleeve), and thought I&#39;d pass on what we <br/>\nlearned that would be of benefit to you (and anyone else reading this <br/>\npost).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here&#39;s one more tip:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen making the foundation layer of fabric, you&#39;ll need three layers, <br/>\nideally two of hemp or linen and one of hessian (sack cloth).<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Sew the outer shell to the hessian.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Make up a wooden frame, like that for a picture, pin the sewn panel <br/>\nto it, to keep it taught while you sew the finished metalwork to it. <br/>\nThat way you don&#39;t get any wrinkles or folds accidentally permanently <br/>\nunder the armour. They would drive you nuts when you wear it!.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW use a simple running stitch through the flat round rings of the <br/>\narmour. Otherwise you will be sewing forever! See #5<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Remove from the frame and cut it to shape.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Sew a narrow leather or textile edging about 20-25m wide around the <br/>\nedge of the foundation, so that the edging fabric and the foundation&#39;s <br/>\nedges match up. This will mean that the edging lays over the top of the <br/>\narmour at this stage.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Now &quot;paint&quot; the back of the hessian with a thin layer of PVA glue <br/>\n(they would have used rice or fish glue, but you don&#39;t want to go <br/>\nthere). This glues the threads holding the armour in position, so that <br/>\nwhen one breaks the whole thing won&#39;t unravel. This is why you don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to sew each plate individually. Seeing how the Japanese had done <br/>\nthis was a real revelation, as we had originally thought the sewing <br/>\nwould take forever. Back then labour was cheap, so we thought it wasn&#39;t <br/>\na problem - for them. This short cut really saves a tremendous amount of <br/>\ntime, and for the Japanese it would have enabled them to make these <br/>\narmours by the tens of thousands.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Now cut out and lay the inner lining on the back of the armour.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Fold the edging leather or fabric back on itself and sew through it <br/>\nand all the fabric. This means that from the outside of the armour you <br/>\nwon&#39;t see any stitching on the edging material, as it is covered by the <br/>\nfolded back leather. The stitches that close the whole thing up are <br/>\nideally running parallel to the edging fabric, but not through it on the <br/>\nfront face.  Again use a simple running stitch to in effect tack it <br/>\nclosed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is three fold, to protect the stitching holding the armour in <br/>\nplace from abrasion, by firstly having the entire back free of exposed <br/>\nthreads, and secondly by having the thickened edge of leather or what <br/>\never you use to shield the edge thread from harm. Finally, and so <br/>\ntypically Japanese, to permit the lining to be easily removed for <br/>\nwashing:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW if you need to access the inside to do repairs, all you have to do <br/>\nis unpick the closest edge and move the lining aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis knowledge was acquired with the help of Ian Bottomley formally of <br/>\nthe Royal Armouries, and Mike Jessop, former keeper of the Wade <br/>\nCollection at Snowshill Manor, who over several year&#39;s arranged access <br/>\nfor myself and Dave Gavin, to closely study various Tatami Do and other <br/>\npieces. The least I can do is pass the information around, otherwise <br/>\nit&#39;s just a self-indulgent waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hope this helps, and all the best with your project.<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n__<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- On Tue, 11/3/09, Dean Wayland &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean@...\">dean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Dean Wayland &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean@...\">dean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Tatami-dou Tosei Gusoku<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Date: Tuesday, November 3, 2009, 6:58 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am currently making a suit of tatami/karutakane armor (my first suit of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;armor), and I was wondering if I could get any tips or cool photos of<br/>\n&gt;various<br/>\n&gt;&gt;sengoku armor pieces. I am basing mine off of a suit from the Osaka<br/>\n&gt;&gt;castle museum (as seen on page 128 of Samurai, by Mitsuo Kure), and<br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is in a haramaki-do style.

Although extremely thin, they were well domed and hardened<br/>\n&gt;so<br/>\n&gt;as to resist deformation.

When properly shaped they stand up well even if not hardened<br/>\n&gt;and tempered. Note that the edge of each plate on an iron or steel<br/>\n&gt;example is turned out a tiny amount so it lays flat(ish) against the<br/>\n&gt;textile foundation, and the plates are arranged in a series of curved<br/>\n&gt;lines so that when worn it follows the contours of the body in<br/>\n&gt;horizontal rows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hope your project goes well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yours<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dean<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If the armour is of hardened and lacqerred rawhide leather, then<br/>\n&gt;typically you are looking at using circa 3mm thick hide.

Note that the edge of each plate on an iron or steel <br/>\nexample is turned out a tiny amount so it lays flat(ish) against the <br/>\ntextile foundation, and the plates are arranged in a series of curved <br/>\nlines so that when worn it follows the contours of the body in <br/>\nhorizontal rows.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope your project goes well.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the armour is of hardened and lacqerred rawhide leather, then <br/>\ntypically you are looking at using circa 3mm thick hide. Don&#39;t forget to <br/>\ncoat the outer shell with a very thin layer of car body filler before <br/>\nlacquering. Okay the Japanese didn&#39;t use car body filler, but it&#39;s the <br/>\nclosest thing you can get to the compound of stone and other stuff that <br/>\nthey did use:-) This will give you a fine smooth surface to paint.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDean Wayland<br/>\nHead Of The Fight School<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk</a></div>",
