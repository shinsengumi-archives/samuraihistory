I trust my <br/>\neditors, as a rule, and if they were my editors then their opinions would <br/>\nshape whether or not my company accepted a manuscript for publication.<br/>\n<br/>\n   FWIW, I have written or co-authored 12 published books and I have <br/>\ncontributed (as an editor, graphic designer and/or developer) to 48 <br/>\nadditional published works. I do have some experience in this realm as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n   One of the hardest things about being an artist (including authors) is <br/>\nrejection. The only thing that I find harder to deal with (other than <br/>\ncrappy sales &lt;G&gt;) is critique. When I create something I put a lot of pride <br/>\nin it, and I love my &quot;baby.&quot; So when people come along and tear it to <br/>\nshreds it&#39;s easy to take personally. But as one must make an effort to step <br/>\nback and remove the emotional filters, and re-evaluate the criticism.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Editors&#39; words can feel scathing, but ultimately they are uttered with <br/>\nthe intent of providing an unbiased evaluation -- and from an objective <br/>\nobserver at that! Such critiques are priceless.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Someone once told me that if I&#39;m writing for me, then it doesn&#39;t matter <br/>\nhow it reads, if it&#39;s accurate, etc. As long as I like it that&#39;s all that <br/>\ncounts. But if I&#39;m writing for someone else -- especially someone whom I <br/>\nexpect to PAY for the privilege -- then the standards go up dramatically <br/>\nand I better be prepared to make a lot of changes if necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n   One question that comes to mind (putting on my publisher hat for a <br/>\nmoment) is: Who is your target audience? That is, who do you hope will buy <br/>\nyour book?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Mark Arsenault<br/>\n    Sengoku List Taisho<br/>\n    ----------------------------------------------<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sengoku.com\">http://www.sengoku.com</a> - The official site of the Sengoku RPG!</div>",

The name was &#39;Kabima&#39;, a concoction <br/>\nfrom the names of my daughters, but on checking it out with a <br/>\nnative speaker, the word means something like &#39;mouldy cloth&#39; or <br/>\n&#39;mouldy clothes&#39; - not a good idea - if you&#39;re going to have <br/>\ncod Japanese names, better make sure you know what they <br/>\nmean.<br/>\n<br/>\n(As it stands now, the Toda existed, and a daughter did marry <br/>\nthe father of Tokugawa Ieyasu, but there&#39;s a couple of extra <br/>\nfamily members of my invention). <br/>\n<br/>\nRe places:<br/>\nI can&#39;t vouch for this, but I once had a discussion with an <br/>\navid fantasy reader who was amazed when I told him the plot of <br/>\na novel without having read it, because from the snippet he <br/>\ntold me I could see it followed the events of the Gempei War <br/>\n(1180-1185). The author had lifted the whole thing, changed the <br/>\nnames and location, and wrote a fantasy bestseller which <br/>\nno-one would identify with Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n(As mine stands, I have to make guesses, although my study <br/>\nwall is plastered with maps, pictures, etc. and my wife has <br/>\nokay&#39;d a solo holiday in Japan for me!)<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you&#39;re going to base a fantasy on Japan, then you <br/>\nhave to identify what it is that you like, and transpose it to <br/>\nyour own world - and identify it with your world, not back to <br/>\nJapan - this is my opinion only, personally I put down &#39;Across <br/>\nthe Nightingale Floor&#39; for that very reason - it&#39;s neither one <br/>\nthing nor the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise &#39;The Last Samurai&#39; - it&#39;s a vehicle for Tom Cruise, <br/>\nand that&#39;s all it is. What realy jars is when they change not <br/>\nonly the culture but the ethos to suit. &#39;Zatoichi&#39; is a lot <br/>\nmore fun, just as much a fiction, but offers no offence to <br/>\nJapan (which TLS does before the opening credits have even <br/>\nfinished).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own work stemmed from what I understood of the the <br/>\nsamurai and his arts, through my martial art practice and <br/>\nreading history - japanes ein translation - and the realisation that <br/>\nmost European fiction on the subject was grossly inaccurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could write like James Clavell, but from a purist <br/>\nperspective Shogun is a crap book serving up the same old <br/>\nnonsense stereotypes that perpetuates a load of bull about <br/>\nSengoku Japan which people mistakenly assume to be <br/>\n&#39;historically accurate&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI neither read nor write Japanese, so am massively limited if <br/>\nnot totally hamstrung, but I follow the Bernard Cornwell rule - <br/>\nI write what I&#39;d like to read, and what I like to read is based <br/>\non history and reality, not fantasy, so I do as much research <br/>\nas I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that aside, good luck with the project,<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",

I just wanted a<br/>\n&gt; critique of the <br/>\n&gt; _chain of events_.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, fair enough. But you did come to a history<br/>\nthread saying you wanted to make things &quot;accurate&quot;.<br/>\nWe&#39;re GOING to base our comments off of history, and<br/>\nwhat was real. If you don&#39;t want to do things a<br/>\ncertain way, don&#39;t--it&#39;s your fantasy world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As for names, if I&#39;m not writing a book set in<br/>\n&gt; historical Japan, I <br/>\n&gt; think the fantasy names are probably a better idea.<br/>\n&gt; Hear me out: <br/>\n&gt; look, if this was a remake of Shogun I would<br/>\n&gt; certainly try to use <br/>\n&gt; Japanese names. It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a fantasy world very<br/>\n&gt; much like a <br/>\n&gt; certain period in Japanese history, and I think<br/>\n&gt; trying to use real <br/>\n&gt; Japanese names would actually cloud the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s my take: either use Japanese names, or don&#39;t<br/>\nuse them. Don&#39;t make &quot;half&quot; names. If you want to use<br/>\na slightly Japanesey setting for your fantasy novel,<br/>\nbut don&#39;t want it to &quot;BE&quot; Japanese, that&#39;s cool--no<br/>\nissues. But then don&#39;t have one character be an<br/>\nIeyasu. That&#39;s not a fantasy name, that&#39;s a historical<br/>\nJapanese name, one what anybody who knows anything<br/>\nabout Japanese history will recognize. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think you should go with Japanese<br/>\nnames--just make them non-historical figures. People<br/>\nunderstand, or should understand, that it&#39;s<br/>\nFICTION--by giving them actual Japanese names, that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they have to be real people, or even<br/>\nbased on real people. There&#39;s nothing wrong with<br/>\nhaving a Shonai Masayori (a perfectly possible, yet<br/>\nmade up name) as a main character. If you use Ieyasu,<br/>\nhowever, people are going to associate that with the<br/>\nREAL Ieyasu, and look for parallels/connections to<br/>\nreality, which is apparently not what you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nGo one way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example, if I write a fantasy novel that uses<br/>\n&gt; the term &quot;Shogun&quot; I <br/>\n&gt; am reprimanded for having fantasy aspects in what<br/>\n&gt; should be a work of <br/>\n&gt; historical fiction. If I write with the term &quot;Jogun&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (which I thought <br/>\n&gt; was a fair fantasy bastardization, if one exists)<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m slammed for it <br/>\n&gt; being a knockoff. Help me win, guys. Help me find<br/>\n&gt; the right thing to <br/>\n&gt; do here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Using the term &quot;Shogun&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you need to make<br/>\nevents match history. But like I said with the names,<br/>\nif you don&#39;t want to be held to any history standards,<br/>\nuse something completely different. Jogun isn&#39;t a good<br/>\none--it&#39;s fairly obvious it should be Shogun. My<br/>\nopinion, but the right thing to do is either use<br/>\nShogun (and I&#39;m about as much of an accuracy Nazi as<br/>\nyou can get, but wouldn&#39;t have an issue with the use<br/>\nof the term in an obviously fantasy/parallel world) or<br/>\nmake up something completely unrelated for use in your<br/>\nworld. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, this is the seventh chapter, in rough draft,<br/>\n&gt; taken out of <br/>\n&gt; context, and a fantasy novel. I appreciate the<br/>\n&gt; critiques, and <br/>\n&gt; apologize for not being clearer in defining my<br/>\n&gt; terms. It&#39;s great that <br/>\n&gt; you guys are tkaing the time to set me straight on<br/>\n&gt; such important <br/>\n&gt; issues, I love this sort of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And again, write for your audience. Your audience may<br/>\nnot care if you spell &quot;sake&quot; as &quot;saki&quot;. But understand<br/>\nyour audience here, as well. That&#39;s the kind of thing<br/>\nthat might make me put a book down at the bookstore<br/>\nrather than take it to the register. Does it matter in<br/>\nthe grand context of your story? Probably not. But you<br/>\nsaid you wanted help with accuracy, and, well, that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat we&#39;re trying to give you. It&#39;s up to you then to<br/>\ntake it and go &quot;no, my fantasy world doesn&#39;t need<br/>\nthat&quot;, or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t read fantasy fiction, and as such, I&#39;m<br/>\nprobably not your audience. But again, it&#39;s so easy to<br/>\nget some little details right that make all the<br/>\ndifference in wether someone like me would read it or<br/>\nnot. The storyline itself seems fine--parents<br/>\ndishonored, kid raised to take revenge, etc. It&#39;s the<br/>\ndetails that are going to make me throw it away or<br/>\nstay up all night to get to the end. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1212853801\">WHOA, boys. Whoa.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first place, this is the seventh chapter of a book in the <br/>\nrough draft, so by this time, the showing has already done and a <br/>\nlittle bit of telling is in order. I just wanted a critique of the <br/>\n_chain of events_.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for names, if I&#39;m not writing a book set in historical Japan, I <br/>\nthink the fantasy names are probably a better idea. Hear me out: <br/>\nlook, if this was a remake of Shogun I would certainly try to use <br/>\nJapanese names. It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a fantasy world very much like a <br/>\ncertain period in Japanese history, and I think trying to use real <br/>\nJapanese names would actually cloud the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if I write a fantasy novel that uses the term &quot;Shogun&quot; I <br/>\nam reprimanded for having fantasy aspects in what should be a work of <br/>\nhistorical fiction. If I write with the term &quot;Jogun&quot; (which I thought <br/>\nwas a fair fantasy bastardization, if one exists) I&#39;m slammed for it <br/>\nbeing a knockoff. Help me win, guys. Help me find the right thing to <br/>\ndo here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is the seventh chapter, in rough draft, taken out of <br/>\ncontext, and a fantasy novel. I appreciate the critiques, and <br/>\napologize for not being clearer in defining my terms. It&#39;s great that <br/>\nyou guys are tkaing the time to set me straight on such important <br/>\nissues, I love this sort of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful,<br/>\n<br/>\nLili</div>",

So, without <br/>\n&gt; futher ado...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tony got to you first--however, I&#39;ll say a lot of the<br/>\nsame things, I&#39;m sure. But let me start by saying that<br/>\nif you listen to ANYONE, please listen to him! I&#39;ve<br/>\ngot no official research background or writing<br/>\nhistory--he&#39;s got both, been published several times<br/>\nin history, at least, and will tell you like it is.<br/>\nAnyways, on with my comments...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My father had once been a retainer to the Emperor.<br/>\n&gt; The o&#39;Diserah were <br/>\n&gt; an old and noble clan, known for their faithfulness<br/>\n&gt; to the Peerless. <br/>\n&gt; Endless feudal wars had reduced the o&#39;Diserah to a<br/>\n&gt; single family, and <br/>\n&gt; of that family my father was the last to survive.<br/>\n&gt; Such is life.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Names. Ouch. What&#39;s with the &quot;o&#39;everything&quot;? Are we<br/>\nJapanese or Irish? This needs serious work. Not to be<br/>\nharsh, but speaking, as Tony put it, from the<br/>\n&quot;Japanophile&quot; side of the house, I would pick up this<br/>\nbook, turn to the back cover, see that it&#39;s about<br/>\nsomeone in the &quot;o&#39;Diserah&quot; family, and immediately put<br/>\nit down, lamenting the fact that no one writes good<br/>\nfiction about Japanese history. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd strictly speaking, the Emperor himself didn&#39;t have<br/>\ndirect retainers. Everyone was technically a servant<br/>\nof the Emperor, but he wasn&#39;t a feudal magnate, and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t maintain his own warrior house. Think of him<br/>\nmore like the Pope than a European king (and ignore<br/>\nthe whole Pope maintaining standing armies in the<br/>\n1400&#39;s or so thing). <br/>\n<br/>\nKusunoki Masashige is one of the few examples I can<br/>\nthink of of someone truly dedicated solely to the<br/>\nEmperor, and that was to GoDaigo, who TRIED to regain<br/>\nrule from the Bakufu, in essence trying to act like a<br/>\nking, rather than what the Emperor by this point<br/>\nnormally did. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My father took service under the Emperor and was<br/>\n&gt; given the position <br/>\n&gt; of Kanhake- one of the Emperor&#39;s bodyguard. It was<br/>\n&gt; honorable, and my <br/>\n&gt; father was a skilled swordsman.  He protected the<br/>\n&gt; Emperor as he would <br/>\n&gt; have protected any lord- fearlessly, with honor.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this supposed to be something like the Praetorian<br/>\nGuard? Because that&#39;s what I&#39;m picturing. There were<br/>\nseveral Imperial guard forces, but service in them<br/>\nwasn&#39;t REALLY how we imagine a bodyguard, following<br/>\naround the Emperor like the Secret Service or P.<br/>\nDiddy&#39;s posse. They were more like police or palace<br/>\nguards, not personal ones. I can dig up descriptions<br/>\nof them, if you like--Sansom&#39;s volume 1 history gives<br/>\na basic outline, but Karl Friday is a better<br/>\nexplanation. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The Emperor&#39;s youngest sister and favored concubine,<br/>\n&gt; Azami, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She&#39;s his sister, AND his concubine? Um....yech. While<br/>\nthere doesn&#39;t seem to have been any issues marrying<br/>\ncousins (since for a long time the Emperors married<br/>\nwomen of the Fujiwara family, making their sons<br/>\nhalf-Fujiwara, who then married back into the Fujiwara<br/>\nfamily...you get the idea...), this wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nworked. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever an affair of the Emperor&#39;s wife/consort/etc<br/>\nwith another courtier isn&#39;t out of the realm of<br/>\npossibility--look at the Genji Monogatari for an<br/>\nexample. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Chief among those enemies was o&#39;Shotomori Shanjushi<br/>\n&gt; Ieyasu, not yet <br/>\n&gt; Jogun. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, names. Ouch. Especially famous ones. I&#39;ll give<br/>\nyou a website to peruse at the end that will help you<br/>\nwith developing real-sounding Japanese names, and of<br/>\ncourse you can run them by us all  to make sure they<br/>\nweren&#39;t real people, or at least really famous ones.<br/>\nIeyasu is a bad choice....also, I agree with<br/>\nTony--what the hell is Jogun? Either use Shogun, or<br/>\nuse another title--by using Jogun, you just look like<br/>\nyou can&#39;t spell correctly. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was an adept at intrigue and suspicion,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and had risen far <br/>\n&gt; to the position of Master of the Imperial Police.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your book, your fantasy. But my understanding (someone<br/>\ncan correct me if I&#39;m wrong) is that head of the<br/>\nImperial Police was a decent, but not fabulous, title<br/>\nduring the Heian period. During the later Sengoku,<br/>\nwhich if I remember is your target timeframe, this<br/>\nreally wouldn&#39;t have meant a hill of beans. But, as<br/>\nyou said, you&#39;re creating this world. I would read<br/>\nthis and go &quot;hmm, that&#39;s not right&quot;, but then move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsince her blood was his,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he could not <br/>\n&gt; order her suicide. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never really stopped anyone in reality, but okay. <br/>\n<br/>\n For the (SH)ogun had become emperor in all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but name, and the <br/>\n&gt; Emperor an empty puppet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Proudly puppeteering since 1185!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He searched Edon for Azami, and when he found her-<br/>\n&gt; driven mad, <br/>\n&gt; trapped in a bordello, no longer able to return to<br/>\n&gt; her former station <br/>\n&gt; even if she had been able to understand- he<br/>\n&gt; retreated to this <br/>\n&gt; mountain village, far away from Edokyo.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even a banished court lady wouldn&#39;t have been driven<br/>\nto prostitution. Banishment meant being away from the<br/>\npolitical and social center, Kyoto, not destitution<br/>\nand complete misery. Again, your story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She was sanjin<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Huh? You explain the title of (SH)ogun, which everyone<br/>\njust about will understand, but no explanation here of<br/>\nwhat this means. Just something to follow up on later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I nodded, pouring my father another cup of saki. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s &quot;sake&quot;. Saki is a literary pseudonym. <br/>\n<br/>\n The o&#39;Diserah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; believed that to wield <br/>\n&gt; a blade, you must know how it is made, despite the<br/>\n&gt; dishonor of <br/>\n&gt; selling your skill like a merchant.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone may correct me, but your sword maker&#39;s were<br/>\nheld in much higher regard than your average rice<br/>\nbroker. <br/>\n<br/>\n A new Emperor- a concubine&#39;s son- was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; enthroned in the <br/>\n&gt; Winter Palace. And this new Emperor was the creature<br/>\n&gt; of- who else?- <br/>\n&gt; the Jogun.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds very Fujiwara...interesting. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Dai-pa,&quot; I leaned forward a little, &quot;is that why<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m dressed like a <br/>\n&gt; boy?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Daipa&quot; is how the Japanese refer to Pampers, not how<br/>\nyou&#39;d address your father. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe message got cut off--I&#39;ll go back and see if there<br/>\nis anything else I had to add, but here&#39;s the website<br/>\nI promised:<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.sengokudaimyo.com<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to it.

And for the listmember who <br/>\nasked about copyright: if I can prove I am the owner of this email <br/>\naddress, posting a short chapter here actually proves my copyright, <br/>\nso no worries about that. Good question, though!<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow please find a short chapter that details the premise of the <br/>\nbook, tentatively titled &quot;Snowfire.&quot; If there is anything that seems <br/>\nillogical in it, or you would like to correct for historical accuracy <br/>\n(even though this _is_ a fantasy) please don&#39;t hesitate! I&#39;m only <br/>\n10,000 words into the book and want to catch any illogicalities (is <br/>\nthat even a word?) while the work is relatively young. So, without <br/>\nfuther ado...<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father had once been a retainer to the Emperor. The o&#39;Diserah were <br/>\nan old and noble clan, known for their faithfulness to the Peerless. <br/>\nEndless feudal wars had reduced the o&#39;Diserah to a single family, and <br/>\nof that family my father was the last to survive. Such is life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father took service under the Emperor and was given the position <br/>\nof Kanhake- one of the Emperor&#39;s bodyguard. It was honorable, and my <br/>\nfather was a skilled swordsman.  He protected the Emperor as he would <br/>\nhave protected any lord- fearlessly, with honor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my father fell in love.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Emperor&#39;s youngest sister and favored concubine, Azami, returned <br/>\nhis affection, though neither dared to make their feelings known. <br/>\nStill, it is hard to hide anything at the Winter Palace; and my <br/>\nfather had enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nChief among those enemies was o&#39;Shotomori Shanjushi Ieyasu, not yet <br/>\nJogun. He was an adept at intrigue and suspicion, and had risen far <br/>\nto the position of Master of the Imperial Police. And he too burned <br/>\nwith a double passion- to serve his own ambition, and to have Azami.<br/>\nWhen she rejected him- whether out of loyalty to the Emperor or love <br/>\nof my father- he retaliated.<br/>\n<br/>\no&#39;Inanke Kohenaki Azami was found guilty of intriguing against the <br/>\nEmperor. False letters were produced, witnesses as well- though the <br/>\nwitnesses were all Ieyasu&#39;s creatures. The Emperor had no choice but <br/>\nto pronounce her anathema- since her blood was his, he could not <br/>\norder her suicide. Azami left the Winter Palace and vanished into <br/>\nEdon. By the time the Emperor suspected he had been misled, she was <br/>\ngone and Ieyasu was Jogun- the War Lord, and too powerful to be <br/>\ndismissed. For the Jogun had become emperor in all but name, and the <br/>\nEmperor an empty puppet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father, then, made his choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe resigned, left his post as Kanhake and left Odokyo the great city. <br/>\nHe searched Edon for Azami, and when he found her- driven mad, <br/>\ntrapped in a bordello, no longer able to return to her former station <br/>\neven if she had been able to understand- he retreated to this <br/>\nmountain village, far away from Edokyo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned something that was not common knowledge that night: that <br/>\nthe Emperor had sent my father to find Azami. Find her he did, but he <br/>\ndid not return her to the Winter Palace. For she was broken in health <br/>\nand in madness, a child-woman forced to live in the streets and <br/>\ngutters, unprepared for the harshness of life.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Azami had little steel in her,&quot; my father said, staring into the <br/>\nfire. &quot;It was why the Emperor loved her, I think. She was sanjin, of <br/>\ncourse, and honorable... but she was a summer flower.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI nodded, pouring my father another cup of saki. I don&#39;t think he <br/>\nwould have told me some of the things he did that night had he not <br/>\nbeen drinking steadily since the tale started.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father stayed with her, barring her from taking further customers <br/>\nand earning his living-and hers- by the swordmaker&#39;s trade, for which <br/>\nhe had been trained when young. The o&#39;Diserah believed that to wield <br/>\na blade, you must know how it is made, despite the dishonor of <br/>\nselling your skill like a merchant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd eventually, Azami and my father produced me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know if my father cursed himself for breaking his honor with <br/>\nthe Emperor&#39;s sister. In his defense I will say that it was his only <br/>\nlapse in a long and honorable life, and that had I been born a boy, <br/>\nmy father&#39;s dishonor would have even somewhat erased. The fault is <br/>\nmine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was in the last year of Azami&#39;s life, as she grew round with <br/>\npregnancy, that my father learned the Emperor had been slain by <br/>\ntreachery. A new Emperor- a concubine&#39;s son- was enthroned in the <br/>\nWinter Palace. And this new Emperor was the creature of- who else?- <br/>\nthe Jogun.<br/>\n<br/>\no&#39;Shotomori Shanjushi Ieyasu, whose star had climbed so high.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understood far more than another child perhaps would have, having <br/>\ngrown adept at reading my father&#39;s silences as well as his words. My <br/>\nfather&#39;s enemy was my mother&#39;s enemy, and my father&#39;s enemy was also <br/>\nmine.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We are all that is left,&quot; my father said. &quot;Last of the o&#39;Diserah, <br/>\nand last of the Emperor&#39;s retainers. What is our duty, o&#39;Kohe-chan?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI shifted slightly in seiza, easing an ache in my right <br/>\nleg. &quot;Revenge,&quot; I answered.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hai.&quot; My father examined the empty saki bottle. &quot;If your mother&#39;s <br/>\nname were to be known,&quot; he said, &quot;you would be in grave danger. The <br/>\nJogun&#39;s spies know that I have a bastard child, but they have been <br/>\nduped into thinking that her mother was a common low-born prostitute, <br/>\nthat I left the Winter Palace in disgrace for my complicity in <br/>\nAzami&#39;s supposed treachery. The Emperor was careful to let them think <br/>\nso. When he was murdered, my duty became clear. So I have raised you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Dai-pa,&quot; I leaned forward a little, &quot;is that why I&#39;m dressed like a <br/>\nboy?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hai.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And why I learn the sword?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hai.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do I look like my mother?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hai.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What am I to do now, Dai-pa?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Wait. Watch. Learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI set my tea bowl aside and put my hands on the floor, bent forward <br/>\nuntil my forehead touched the mats. &quot;Hai, Dai-pa.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe grunted. &quot;Go to bed, o&#39;Kohe-chan. Tomorrow we will start.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hai, Dai-pa.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI bowed again, then rose and backed away from him, three steps. Then <br/>\nI turned and ran from the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran up the stairs and threw myself down on my bed. My eyes were <br/>\nterribly dry. I lay across my bedding and sobbed without a sound. It <br/>\nis a horrible thing, to learn that you have failed through no fault <br/>\nof your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have been born a boy. A boy could learn the sword without <br/>\ntrouble and carry out revenge with little but the law and the Jogun&#39;s <br/>\nretainers to dissuade him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, however, had been born female. And in doing so, I had failed both <br/>\nmy parents terribly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI lay in the dark, eyes burning, body shuddering with silent sobs, <br/>\nand heard the tinkling crash downstairs as my father threw the saki-<br/>\nbottle against the hearth.</div>",
