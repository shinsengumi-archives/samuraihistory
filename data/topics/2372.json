            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-970266004\">I believe Dr Turnbull has done a valiant effort  in bringing samurai studies <br/>\nbefore the public------and academics like me------who  are far from familiar <br/>\nwith the Japanese tongue.  However,  two points bothered me from his work.  In <br/>\nhis Battles of the Samurai,  he stated that the raid on the army of Takeda <br/>\nKatsuyori was staged by Oda Nobunaga the night before the battle of Nagashino in <br/>\n1575.  However,  in his The Samurai  Sourcebook he went with the other authors <br/>\nand stated it  took place in the morning of the battle.  This was a critical <br/>\nraid---since it relieved the castle that Takeda was besieging, and also <br/>\ncrippled the Takeda clan forces still back at the castle.  To misstate this would be <br/>\nakin to saying that JEB Stuart&#39;s cavalry raid did not affect General Lee&#39;s <br/>\nConfederate army at Gettysburg in the American Civil War in 1863.  Furthermore,  <br/>\nin his Sourcebook,  Turnbull shows an elaborate painting of a Japanese castle <br/>\nsiege, complete with European siege engines, which he says is based on the <br/>\nresearch he is doing in the Tower Armories in London. I have not had access to <br/>\nthose records---however,  in the research I have done in Japanese pictorial <br/>\nsources (again I admit to no language facility!)  I have not yet seen depiction&#39;s <br/>\nin the Japanese pictures that show anything similar to what Turnbull <br/>\nportrays.  Any comments?
