            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1915914294\">Old samurai don&#39;t just fade away<br/>\nBy J.C. Lockwood<br/>\nFriday, September 10, 2004<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone expecting a Kurosawa-like epic, a thrilling action film <br/>\nreplete with beautifully choreographed - and senselessly bloody - <br/>\nsword fights are in for a big disappointment with &quot;The Twilight <br/>\nSamurai,&quot; the new film by Japanese director Yoji Yamada. There are <br/>\nonly two short fight sequences in the film - both beautifully <br/>\nphotographed, but a minor part of the story, which looks at the <br/>\nquietly heroic life of a minor samurai. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The film is set in the 19th century, as the feudal Edo period <br/>\nwas giving way to Meiji Restoration. (A knowledge of Japanese <br/>\nhistory is not required for this film.) The days of the samurai are <br/>\nslipping away. Duels are forbidden, prowess with the sword doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncommand the respect it once did. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Seibei Iguchi (Hiroyuki Sanada), a minor clerk for the clan, <br/>\nmight have had samurai fire in his belly at one point. He trained <br/>\nwith a samurai master and taught at his school, but he has been <br/>\nbeaten down by life: caring for his wife during drawn-out death from <br/>\ntuberculosis, while dealing with a live-in mother in the grips of <br/>\nwith what appears to be Alzheimer&#39;s - and caring for his two <br/>\ndaughters. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Yet he is not unhappy with the strangely rewarding wreckage of <br/>\nhis life. He finds it fulfilling and wishes he could live a peaceful <br/>\nlife as a peasant instead of a poor one as a samurai. The boys at <br/>\nthe office - a warehouse controlled by the clan, mock Iguchi, <br/>\ncalling him &quot;Twilight Samurai,&quot; because he would rather go home to <br/>\nhis family than out whoring around with them at the end of the day. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The divorce and return of Tomoe (Ria Miyazawa), a childhood <br/>\nfriend, leads to a confrontation with her violent ex, a high-ranking <br/>\nsamurai mucky-muck who Iguchi beats senseless - using just a stick. <br/>\nThis pumps up Iguchi&#39;s profile within the organization, although not <br/>\nhis sense of himself - and his chances to find happiness with Tomoe. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Based on the best-selling novel by Shuhei Fujisawa and directed <br/>\nby Yamada, the Japanese director best known for his 48-episode &quot;Tora-<br/>\nsan&quot; series, &quot;Twilight Samurai&quot; is a seemingly ordinary story of <br/>\nsurprising depth and poignancy - and a film that seems, at heart, at <br/>\nleast, as much &quot;Unforgiven&quot; as &quot;Crouching Tiger.&quot; It plays through <br/>\nSept. 16 at The Screening Room, 82 State St., Newburyport.
