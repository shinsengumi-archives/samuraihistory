            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1031159744\">I&#39;m sure that the events depicted in the film SEPPUKU involving the Ii clan were fictional. The characters were clearly fictional and I believe that the Ii clan was selected by the authors of the script (and the novel the script was based upon) as representative of a powerful clan of that era. <br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, what may or may not have actually happened during the Edo period wouldn&#39;t be in the Ii clan chronicles, it would be in another clan&#39;s chronicles. I always can use another excuse to watch SEPPUKU yet again, as it&#39;s my favorite all-time film (in any genre on any topic -- and I do watch a lot of films). So I&#39;ll watch it this weekend to see if I can pick up the name of the ronin mentioned in passing in the film. Of course his name could have been fictionalized as could have been the use of the Sengoku clan&#39;s name. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe question that would be relevant for research on the topic of seppuku during the Edo period is if there was or was not any incidents where a ronin came to a clan and requested a spot to commit seppuku to avoid a life of poverty -- and if the clan, impressed by his sincerity, took him in as a retainer. What would also be relevant is if any ronin during that period, upon getting word of this incident, took it upon themselves to extort positions and/or money from clans by asking to commit seppuku, expecting to get either a job or &quot;go away&quot; money. <br/>\n <br/>\nNina aka &quot;Wave Tossed&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com] <br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 19, 2006 6:27 AM<br/>\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: RE: Research on Seppuku (was RE: [samuraihistory] - HOGEN INCIDENT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nabout seppuku(the film):Ii clan chronicles dont mention any such <br/>\nincident.so,its possible that its pure fiction...regards tengu64<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@ssa. &lt;mailto:Nina.Boal%40ssa.gov&gt; gov&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Research on Seppuku (was RE: [samuraihistory] - HOGEN INCIDENT)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2006 08:13:18 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d love to see your finished work. Perhaps you might want to put a link to <br/>\n&gt;it in the Edo Period section of the Samurai Archives Citadel.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Speaking of film and seppuku: I&#39;ve brought this up before. But Kobayashi&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;film SEPPUKU discussed incidents of early Edo-period ronin from disbanded <br/>\n&gt;clans coming to clan gateways to request a spot to commit seppuku. In the <br/>\n&gt;film, the main fictional character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) mention a name of a <br/>\n&gt;ronin who came to the Sengoku clan&#39;s gateway (unfortunately, the man&#39;s name <br/>\n&gt;mentioned in the film has escaped me at the moment). This ronin told the <br/>\n&gt;clan leaders that he preferred to commit seppuku rather than live on in <br/>\n&gt;endless poverty. The Sengoku clan leaders were so impressed that they made <br/>\n&gt;him a member of their clan. After that, supposedly scores of impoverished <br/>\n&gt;ronin went to clan gates with seppuku requests and the clans would give <br/>\n&gt;them &quot;go away&quot; money. Sooner or later most of these seppuku requests were <br/>\n&gt;insincere; the ronin involved wanted the money rather than actually wanting <br/>\n&gt;to commit seppuku. As many of us know, the film SEPPUKU involves a ronin <br/>\n&gt;making such a request -- with tragic consequences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I don&#39;t really want to discuss the film.

The film&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;name (the same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, and<br/>\n&gt;was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes place in<br/>\n&gt;12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a revolt.<br/>\n&gt;During the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal palace in<br/>\n&gt;Kyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescued by a <br/>\n&gt;soldier<br/>\n&gt;named Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revolt fails, Moritoh<br/>\n&gt;is told that he can have anything that he wants, and what he wants is Lady<br/>\n&gt;Kesa to be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that she is already<br/>\n&gt;married to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Rather than seek<br/>\n&gt;something different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with Lady Kesa.<br/>\n&gt;Filmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first color films<br/>\n&gt;from Japan), the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exquisite. The story <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;by no means dated, though it does become somewhat predictable. Still, it is<br/>\n&gt;both compelling and engaging and the acting is superb, especially Machiko<br/>\n&gt;Ky.

Perhaps you might want to put a link to <br/>\n&gt;it in the Edo Period section of the Samurai Archives Citadel.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Speaking of film and seppuku: I&#39;ve brought this up before. But Kobayashi&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;film SEPPUKU discussed incidents of early Edo-period ronin from disbanded <br/>\n&gt;clans coming to clan gateways to request a spot to commit seppuku. In the <br/>\n&gt;film, the main fictional character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) mention a name of a <br/>\n&gt;ronin who came to the Sengoku clan&#39;s gateway (unfortunately, the man&#39;s name <br/>\n&gt;mentioned in the film has escaped me at the moment). This ronin told the <br/>\n&gt;clan leaders that he preferred to commit seppuku rather than live on in <br/>\n&gt;endless poverty. The Sengoku clan leaders were so impressed that they made <br/>\n&gt;him a member of their clan. After that, supposedly scores of impoverished <br/>\n&gt;ronin went to clan gates with seppuku requests and the clans would give <br/>\n&gt;them &quot;go away&quot; money. Sooner or later most of these seppuku requests were <br/>\n&gt;insincere; the ronin involved wanted the money rather than actually wanting <br/>\n&gt;to commit seppuku. As many of us know, the film SEPPUKU involves a ronin <br/>\n&gt;making such a request -- with tragic consequences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I don&#39;t really want to discuss the film. Rather I&#39;m curious to <br/>\n&gt;know: did the incident mentioned in the film involving the Sengoku clan <br/>\n&gt;actually happen? Or did Kobayashi (and/or novelest Takaguchi) draw a <br/>\n&gt;completely fictional event with fictional names out of the hat?

But Kobayashi&#39;s film SEPPUKU discussed incidents of early Edo-period ronin from disbanded clans coming to clan gateways to request a spot to commit seppuku. In the film, the main fictional character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) mention a name of a ronin who came to the Sengoku clan&#39;s gateway (unfortunately, the man&#39;s name mentioned in the film has escaped me at the moment). This ronin told the clan leaders that he preferred to commit seppuku rather than live on in endless poverty. The Sengoku clan leaders were so impressed that they made him a member of their clan. After that, supposedly scores of impoverished ronin went to clan gates with seppuku requests and the clans would give them &quot;go away&quot; money. Sooner or later most of these seppuku requests were insincere; the ronin involved wanted the money rather than actually wanting to commit seppuku. As many of us know, the film SEPPUKU involves a ronin making such a request --<br/>\n with tragic consequences. <br/>\n  <br/>\n Anyway, I don&#39;t really want to discuss the film. Rather I&#39;m curious to know: did the incident mentioned in the film involving the Sengoku clan actually happen? Or did Kobayashi (and/or novelest Takaguchi) draw a completely fictional event with fictional names out of the hat?

The film&#39;s <br/>\n name (the same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, and <br/>\n was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes place in <br/>\n 12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a revolt. <br/>\n During the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal palace in <br/>\n Kyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescued by a soldier <br/>\n named Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revolt fails, Moritoh <br/>\n is told that he can have anything that he wants, and what he wants is Lady <br/>\n Kesa to be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that she is already <br/>\n married to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Rather than seek <br/>\n something different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with Lady Kesa.<br/>\n Filmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first color films <br/>\n from Japan), the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exquisite. The story is <br/>\n by no means dated, though it does become somewhat predictable. Still, it is <br/>\n both compelling and engaging and the acting is superb, especially Machiko <br/>\n Ky. Memorable scenes in the film include the confusion at the royal palace, <br/>\n Laky Kesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Moritoh meeting Lady Kesa and her <br/>\n aunt after the revolt, Moritoh given the choice of his heart&#39;s desire, the <br/>\n horse races, Moritoh at the home of Lady Kesa&#39;s aunt, and the ending scenes. <br/>\n The makeup used on Moritoh could have been better.<br/>\n <br/>\n The film won several awards including an Oscar for Best Costume Design, an <br/>\n Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the prestigious <br/>\n Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in France.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1428330580\">Jonathan, just an &quot;off the cuff&quot; thought - is the Hogen Incident the basis <br/>\nof the film &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;  (&quot;Jigokumon&quot;, 1953, directed by Teinosuke <br/>\nKinugasa)???  The list seems to be a little quiet at present so I&#39;ll be <br/>\nindulgent and ramble on a bit about this film, one of my favourites.<br/>\n<br/>\nA thoroughly enjoyable movie, one reviewer commenting &quot;Kinugasa&#39;s sublime <br/>\ncontrol of color intensifies every emotion in his Academy Award®-winning <br/>\nmasterpiece, a classic 12th-century tale about a warrior whose love <br/>\ndishonors a married woman. The screen is steeped in fiery reds for chaotic <br/>\nbattle scenes, then blanketed in soothing images of white-kimonoed priests <br/>\nbeside a calm blue sea. The exquisite compositions and charged performances <br/>\nof Kazuo Hasegawa and Machiko Kyo depict a culture dedicated to order, yet <br/>\neasily rocked by passion.&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reviwer <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Gate-Hell-Teinosuke-Kinugasa/dp/6303073093\">http://www.amazon.com/Gate-Hell-Teinosuke-Kinugasa/dp/6303073093</a> comments:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1953, Teinosuke Kinugasa (1896-1982) directed and co-adapted the <br/>\nhistorical play entitled &quot;Jigokumon&quot; (English transliteration of the <br/>\nJapanese title), which was written by Kan Kikuchi (1888-1948). The film&#39;s <br/>\nname (the same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, and <br/>\nwas released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes place in <br/>\n12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a revolt. <br/>\nDuring the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal palace in <br/>\nKyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescued by a soldier <br/>\nnamed Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revolt fails, Moritoh <br/>\nis told that he can have anything that he wants, and what he wants is Lady <br/>\nKesa to be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that she is already <br/>\nmarried to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Rather than seek <br/>\nsomething different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with Lady Kesa.<br/>\nFilmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first color films <br/>\nfrom Japan), the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exquisite. The story is <br/>\nby no means dated, though it does become somewhat predictable. Still, it is <br/>\nboth compelling and engaging and the acting is superb, especially Machiko <br/>\nKy. Memorable scenes in the film include the confusion at the royal palace, <br/>\nLaky Kesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Moritoh meeting Lady Kesa and her <br/>\naunt after the revolt, Moritoh given the choice of his heart&#39;s desire, the <br/>\nhorse races, Moritoh at the home of Lady Kesa&#39;s aunt, and the ending scenes. <br/>\nThe makeup used on Moritoh could have been better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe film won several awards including an Oscar for Best Costume Design, an <br/>\nHonorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the prestigious <br/>\nGrand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Overall, I rate &quot;Gate of <br/>\nHell&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars. Hopefully, the film will be fully restored and <br/>\nreleased on DVD one day. I highly recommend the film.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;jonathan ellgen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpellgen@...\">jpellgen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 9:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I am working on a section of my master&#39;s thesis dealing with the Hogen <br/>\n&gt;Incident.
