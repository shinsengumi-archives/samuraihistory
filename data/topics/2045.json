I am currently writing a story set in <br/>\nthe last years of the 16th century (a little bit before Tokugawa took <br/>\npower), obviously I need to do research to not mess up too much. In <br/>\nthis story I have used the names of Himura, Shimizu, and Iwamura, all <br/>\nas powerful clans. The fact is I don&#39;t know about the real history of <br/>\nthese clans, just used the names and made up some of their history <br/>\nfor the purposes of the story - which is fantasy-based. Then again, <br/>\nif I can find out about their history, much better!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s all for now, any specific inquiries that I might have <br/>\nI&#39;ll let ya guys know. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wolf of Mibu</div>",
