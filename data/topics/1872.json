As long as a topic is <br/>\neven vaguely or marginally related to Japanese history or culture or <br/>\nJapan or Japanese, it is free to go (and I think that gives a lot of <br/>\nleeway in discussion, and I&#39;m not against history-related posts that <br/>\nare more or less off-topic).  Allowing a free-reign of completely off-<br/>\ntopic posts opens a can of worms I&#39;d prefer to avoid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, tom helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Nate et al-<br/>\n&gt; \tMy point was that it is a little hypocritical to say it is ok <br/>\n&gt; to chat about mopeds because they are Japanese, but not politics <br/>\n&gt; because they are European.
