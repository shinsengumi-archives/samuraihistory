While he is not<br/>\nassociated with any great University, his <br/>\n  work seems to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is<br/>\nnot an amazing writer ( imean; his <br/>\n  style), but he seems to be truly in love with the<br/>\nsubject, and I really like the way he <br/>\n  fills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind<br/>\nof (perhaps?) self-made scholarship <br/>\n  is available.<br/>\n  Since this is the first time I write, I was<br/>\nwondering what you &quot;samurai-maniacs&quot; public <br/>\n  think of Turnbull in general.<br/>\n  Any book you would suggest in particular?<br/>\n  Thanx,<br/>\n  cepo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

He uses the<br/>\nsame anecdotes in many of his books--I can find at<br/>\nleast one that he uses three seperate times. And<br/>\nsometeimes what he writes is flat wrong, or<br/>\ncontradictory. I&#39;ve heard many people criticize that,<br/>\nas have I in the past.

But no one else has made available,<br/>\nin English, the sheer amount of information that he<br/>\nhas--who cares if it&#39;s rehashes of Rekishi Gunzo or if<br/>\nthere are minor mistakes? I&#39;m a qualified Japanese<br/>\nlinguist according to the US Army (just took my<br/>\nrecertification test and passed this morning! go me!)<br/>\nand Rekishi Gunzo kicks my behind when I try to read<br/>\nit!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-957874994\">Well..... Seeing battle lines are being drawn up I had better take up my position on the defences!!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephen Turnbull&#39;s books have done more to popularise the military history of the samurai and Japan in the western world than any other author.  Whilst I would agree with some, and I do make some critisism at times, that his work is not perhaps 100% academic, contains some errors and does suffer from a degree of repetition, it has never the less provided a firm foundation over the past 25 years for the &quot;samurai enthusiasts&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephen had an interest in Japan and the Far East from his early days and this no doubt helped him in his studies at Cambridge University and obtaining a Doctorate from Leeds with his thesis on the Hidden Christians of Japan. He has ben a member of the Japan Society for many years and is currently an Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of East Asian Studies at the University of Leeds.  So on one point a small correction, he is associated with a great university..  He is also associated with the Samurai Gallery of the UK National Armouries and has acted as consultant to the BBC, The History Channel and &quot;Shogun&quot; anmongst others...<br/>\n<br/>\nI first met Stephen in the early seventies when he and I were both members of the North Cheshire Military Modelling Society, there his infectious enthusiasm for the topic made me a convert. We still occassionally bump into each other up and down the country. His first book on the samurai published in 1977, &quot;The Samurai: A Military History&quot; was a mammoth task for those days and ignited a thirst for knowledge on the subject in the UK .<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own reasonably extensive library has over 20 Turnbull publications on various aspects of the samurai competing for space with books in japanese, german, french, italian and polish as well as many others in english.  I have much respect for Stephen in that he &quot;put pen to paper&quot; and put &quot;his head above the parapet!&quot; (how&#39;s that for mixed metaphors...). It is almost a standing joke between us that my book has yet to come to fruition - but then I am an engineer!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend that you view his website and perhaps obtain a couple of the books from a library before you decide to purchase your first... I am presently making my way through the two great volumes of collected papers in his editorial work &quot;The Samurai Tradition&quot;  {published cost over £200} <br/>\n<br/>\n                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freespace.virgin.net/stephen.turnbull/publications.htm\">http://freespace.virgin.net/stephen.turnbull/publications.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as another english author did say... &quot;let loose the dogs of war!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                        Rod Johnson  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cepooooo&quot; &lt;cepo@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; After studying premodern Japanese history for a few years through the texts of the <br/>\n&gt; classic American historians (Keene, Varley, Hall, etc.), I finally got me a couple of <br/>\n&gt; books from Stephen Turnbull.
