            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-444439234\">Ever wonder why a Japanese bandit covers his hair?<br/>\n\tOne reason is the dust, under floorboards and under eaves, it <br/>\nwould stick in the heavily oiled hair and it would be obvious to <br/>\nanyone that you had been crawling around above the ceiling. More <br/>\nimportantly though is the hairstyle. The Nihon Rekishi Zuroku shows <br/>\nsome 60 hairstyles for men and over 100 for women. Each is for a <br/>\nparticular caste or occupation. Edo residents would instantly <br/>\nrecognize a persons status and even occupation by their hairstyle. <br/>\nFor them it would be easy to see and remember even in the dark.<br/>\n\tBy covering your hair you could enter and a house and even if <br/>\nseen slip back into the crowd just by uncovering your head!<br/>\n<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

And of <br/>\nthis i have always wondered why they had it in the first place and <br/>\nwhy it changed? both the que and amount of shaved head over the <br/>\ncenturies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have wondered that perhaps it was a mixture of both thier warrior <br/>\ncult ways.( i use the term cult in the sence that after the Hideyoshi <br/>\nsword edics and the rise of the bushi as top of the political and <br/>\nsocial prymid. the bushi took the beliefs and ideals of Shinto, <br/>\nBuddism, and a little Confusionism to make Bushido.) And thier <br/>\nobvious religious underpinnings. If anyone has any idea&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nArigato<br/>\nKazuri Atsi</div>",
