Onimusha 3, and supposedly <br/>\nthe series closer).  Mitsuhide makes a brief appearance or two in this third <br/>\ngame and is mentioned in the first.  The BradyGames guide gives some actual <br/>\nhistorical background in the character bios section, but not enough to recommend <br/>\nit as a source.  In the games, though, Mitsuhide is referred to as Hidemitsu&#39;s <br/>\nuncle, instead of his brother (and hey, weren&#39;t they *cousins*?).  As I&#39;ve <br/>\nsaid before, though, don&#39;t knock it: it&#39;s what got me interested in this age in <br/>\nJapan&#39;s history.  Just my two senseless worth.  :-)  Take care.<br/>\n<br/>\nL8r<br/>\nTim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
