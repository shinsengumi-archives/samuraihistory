I&#39;m trying to learn the post-1865 samurai history mostly <br/>\nconcerned with the Japanese American imigrants to the US. I believe <br/>\nthe &quot;last&quot; samurai comment is a vague area. I&#39;ll explain.<br/>\n  Known facts :1877 Satsuma led by Saigo Takamori attack Kumamoto <br/>\nCastle. US tries peace agreements prior to attack.<br/>\n  I understand up to this point.(well documented) <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to find if the US govt took samarai family names<br/>\n(hereditary) + first names of all children in family at this time. <br/>\nThen..fast fwd.. to 1941-42 WWII.  Prior to Roosevelt&#39;s Ex. Order <br/>\n9066 (forced internment) there were JA men who were &quot;arrested/taken&quot; <br/>\naway. No charge against..no explaination(which i want to find). <br/>\nThese men were taken to North Dakota. As I have been told these men <br/>\nin North Dakota(not sure how many) were all either present or family <br/>\nwere present at the time of Satsuma reb. 1877 and were on the side <br/>\nof the Imp. Army?? fighting the Satsuma clan. Which makes sense to <br/>\nme on the US side to see Samurai in US but loyal to fight for <br/>\nMeiji.  But please correct me if my history is in err.  <br/>\n So i&#39;m looking for any information about this.  And from my <br/>\nunderstanding most of this information was held in both govt. and <br/>\nsamurai family secret until ?late 70&#39;s?.  <br/>\n  All this information should provide me with the answer to &quot;The <br/>\nFastest Hands in Japan&quot;--quoted from a dying 96 yr old man. born 1870</div>",
