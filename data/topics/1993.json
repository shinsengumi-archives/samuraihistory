The <br/>\nopening of the Japanese mind incited, inevitably, a <br/>\nreciprocal awakening in the American one.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher Benfey&#39;s book tells the story of the &quot;gifted, <br/>\nintrepid men and women, American and Japanese,&quot; who were at <br/>\n&quot;the hot edge where two very different cultures were coming <br/>\ninto contact&quot; during the half-century before World War I, <br/>\nsays Deresiewicz. &quot;The lives of certain key figures unfold <br/>\nacross the whole arc of the book, attaining something <br/>\napproaching the weight of fiction,&quot; he comments. <br/>\n<br/>\nDescribing the intersections between these peoples&#39; lives, <br/>\nDeresiewicz writes, &quot;Kakuzo Okakura, the connoisseur, curator <br/>\nand cultural historian mentored by Ernest Fenollosa, the <br/>\nTokyo philosophy professor instrumental in shaping Japanese <br/>\nfine arts policy, mentors in turn John La Farge, the painter <br/>\nmost responsible for bringing Japanese aesthetic ideas and <br/>\nmethods to American art.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The structure is symphonic,&quot; writes Deresiewicz, &quot;a symphony <br/>\nnot only of characters but of ideas.&quot; Benfey &quot;brings to his <br/>\nsubject a scholar&#39;s thoroughness, a critic&#39;s astuteness and a <br/>\nstoryteller&#39;s sense of drama.&quot; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/20/books/review/20DERESIT.html?8bu\">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/20/books/review/20DERESIT.html?8bu</a></div>",
