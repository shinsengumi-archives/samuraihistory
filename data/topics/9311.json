            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-980967578\">Martin and Barry<br/>\nI had heard that one of the swords owned by Musashi was a shodai Hizen Tadayoshi which would have been a new sword to Musashi as they both lived about the same time. Also about the long sword to which you refer, you may be confusing this with that used by Sasaki Ganryu in their famous duel. Sasaki was reputed to have a very long sword called the &quot;Swallow Cutter&quot; I believe.<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nClive Sinclaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Barry Thomas <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, January 20, 2007 1:33 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Nihonto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Martin,<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is no substitute for real knowledge - go here to begin your quest:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\">http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm</a><br/>\n  And above all, buy books if you have a serious rather than a casual approach to katana...<br/>\n<br/>\n  To answer your questions:<br/>\n  - Simply, katana are made of &quot;steel&quot; steel.
