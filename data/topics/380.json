            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1842224917\">Short answer: Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sword or swords were always worn on the left hip, the draw was<br/>\nalways with the right hand, and the two-hand grip was always with <br/>\nthe left hand closest to the body. If you were left-handed, you<br/>\nsimply <br/>\ntrained to be proficient either way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid the Japanese &#39;train out&#39; left-handedness as the Europeans used<br/>\nto? I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that the a swordsman would be proficient with either hand<br/>\n- as for example Miyamoto Musashi who is credited with founding the <br/>\nNiten Ichi Ryu (Two Heaven School) in which both swords are drawn - <br/>\nhis argument being if you have two swords why only use one? Even so, <br/>\nhe continued to wear both swords on the left side.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know the draw technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was once told by a collector he came across a short sword with the<br/>\ntang (the bit that goes into the hilt) curved the opposite way to the <br/>\nblade (so the whole thing looked vaguely S-shaped). He had been <br/>\ntold the sword had probably been made for a one-armed man, the <br/>\ncounter-curve of the tang helping the balance of the blade.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately it was impossible to tell which arm the man used!<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
