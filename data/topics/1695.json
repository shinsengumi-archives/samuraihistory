His speach and actions were always passionate and direct <br/>\n(to the point).<br/>\n<br/>\nHis personality is reflected in his military operations (movements), <br/>\nwhich were &#39;colored&#39; by his chivalry. He would help the weak and <br/>\ncrush the strong.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is recorded in the &quot;Meishougenkouroku&quot; that Kenshin admired <br/>\nMinamoto Yoshitsune.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenshin&#39;s genius for battle command came from ardent adoration of <br/>\nMinamoto Yoshitsune as well as his own battle experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Dragon of Echigo&quot;, Kenshin, was the second son of the Echigo <br/>\nShugo Nagao Tamekage. The Nagao clan was one of the &quot;eight clans of <br/>\nthe Kantou&quot; (Bandou Hachiheishi) which were descended from Emperor <br/>\nKammu.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Shingen was alive, he said &quot;Kenshin is an honorable and just <br/>\nman. He has no equal in the realm.&quot; In 1573, when Shingen died of <br/>\nillness on campaign, his final message to Katsuyori was &quot;If you ask <br/>\nKenshin for assistance, he will not refuse. He will definately <br/>\nassist you.&quot; Shingen recognized that Kenshin was an honorable man <br/>\nwith a strong sense of duty and justice.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenshin heard of Shingen&#39;s death while eating a meal at Kasugayama. <br/>\nHe threw his chopsticks without thinking, saying &quot;He was my rival for <br/>\nmany years, but the great general who was a pillar of the Kantou <br/>\nwarrior families has been lost. It is truly a shame.&quot; It is <br/>\nrecorded that he wept at the news.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;nez_uk1981&quot; &lt;nezy@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking to write a novel featuring real historical figures as <br/>\n&gt; back ground characters.
