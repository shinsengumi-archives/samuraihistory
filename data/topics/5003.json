It<br/>\nis more like a wide sword than a naginata and has a shinogi but no yokote<br/>\n(as Tom says). The blade, which is almost straight has a choji-midare hamon<br/>\nin the Bizen style and is 74cm in length, the nakago is another 51 cm and it<br/>\nwas a ploishing nightmare I am told.<br/>\nThe pole itself is 1mtr 29 cm. There is a Namabam style &quot;cupped&quot; tsuba and<br/>\nthe top part of the pole is wrapped like the tsuka of a sword over same (ray<br/>\nskin) and there is a aogai lacquered section below this. It is a fearsome<br/>\nweapon which I would think was not easy to use, in fact this is probably a<br/>\nparade rather than a battle weapon, considering its late date.<br/>\nI think some katana blades were mountd in poles but this is probably Western<br/>\ndealer adaptations.<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nClive Sinclaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tom Helm&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junkmail@...\">junkmail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 04, 2004 6:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] nagamaki/naginata<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Rami-<br/>\n&gt; While they are both &quot;swords on a stick&quot;, the naginata in general<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have a yokote line delineating the point.
