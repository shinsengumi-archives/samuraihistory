I earn my meager bread as a<br/>\nteacher of<br/>\ninternational sword arts (as well as naginata, spear,<br/>\nassorted peasant<br/>\nweapons from Europe and Asia, Chinese weapons,<br/>\narchery, empty-hand, and<br/>\nknife and stick styles - I even teach crutch<br/>\nself-defense from time to<br/>\ntime), and I&#39;m pretty serious about my accuracy.  I<br/>\nalso come from a family<br/>\nof academics, so bad research is a very sensitive<br/>\nsubject for me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nteaching one style or another for about thirty years,<br/>\npretty informally<br/>\nuntil the last ten years or so; and I&#39;ve been<br/>\npractising longer than I can<br/>\nremember offhand.  I got hooked, as you put it, on<br/>\nJapanese combat arts at<br/>\nan art house that screened Inagaki&#39;s &quot;Chushingura&quot;<br/>\nevery year back in the<br/>\nlate &#39;60s and early &#39;70s.  Musashi&#39;s _Book of Five<br/>\nRings_ had a hell of a<br/>\nlot more influence on me than the ninja craze that hit<br/>\na few years later.<br/>\n(And of course, my mother had Hiroshige and Hokusai<br/>\nprints around the house<br/>\nfrom the time I was born.)<br/>\nA few years ago, someone asked another teacher in the<br/>\narea, &quot;What does it<br/>\ntake to open a Ninjitsu school?&quot;  The teacher thought<br/>\nabout it a second and<br/>\nsaid, &quot;A black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a business<br/>\nlicense.&quot;  Which pretty<br/>\nwell sums up my attitude to 90-plus % of what is<br/>\ncalled Ninjitsu today.<br/>\nI&#39;ve talked with Steve Hayes, and one of my old<br/>\nstudents ran Frank Dux&#39;s<br/>\nsecond school back in the &#39;80s, before he got<br/>\ndisillusioned with Dux&#39;s cult<br/>\nof personality.  Neither of them impressed me much<br/>\nwith the quality of his<br/>\nbackground.  (Dux&#39;s fighting skill was remarkable, but<br/>\nit was mostly<br/>\nmilitary; and &quot;Bloodsport&quot; represented neither his<br/>\nstyle nor his<br/>\nwish-fulfillment history with any accuracy.)  As far<br/>\nas the craze for<br/>\nNinjitsu goes, in fact, I have seen precisely one<br/>\n&quot;Ninja&quot; film - some Sho<br/>\nKosugi silliness that turned up on late-night TV a few<br/>\nyears back - and my<br/>\ncomment to Nate was precisely in hopes that I would<br/>\n_not_ be lumped in with<br/>\nthis sordid batch of bad research and willful<br/>\nmyth-information by the<br/>\nserious minds on this list.<br/>\nSo if being a ninja wanna-be got &quot;the best of us&quot;<br/>\nhooked, then I guess I&#39;m<br/>\nnot one of the best of you.  And if that really were<br/>\nthe best of you, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe spikes and the stars are all known as shuriken.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is certainly true:  at least outside of Japan: <br/>\nbut then a great many<br/>\nthings are &quot;known&quot; inaccurately.  (Witness the person<br/>\nwho found a web-site<br/>\nclaiming the 47 Ronin killed the Shogun!)  So permit<br/>\nme to ask if you have<br/>\npositive knowledge that the term &#39;shaken&#39; is<br/>\nincorrectly applied to the<br/>\nstars, etc., and likewise that &#39;shuriken&#39; is correctly<br/>\napplied to them.  As<br/>\nI say, I&#39;m pretty serious about my accuracy, and I<br/>\nalways desire to learn<br/>\nmore and to refine my knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthe spikes are better know as Bo-shuriken<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I&#39;m interested in learning the sources for this<br/>\ninformation.  No<br/>\noffense, but what I have is your word on one hand, and<br/>\nGruzanski&#39;s<br/>\nMasaki-Ryu information on the other (and I do thank<br/>\nyou for providing me<br/>\nwith that footnote).  If what you say about Masaki-Ryu<br/>\nas the source for<br/>\n_Spike and Chain_ is correct, then why should that not<br/>\nbe regarded as<br/>\naccurate?  Have you reason to believe that Masaki-Ryu<br/>\nis not a legitimate<br/>\nstyle, and that its terminology is therefore to be<br/>\ndismissed?  And if so, on<br/>\nwhat grounds do you make that claim?  Another style&#39;s<br/>\nterminology that you<br/>\nprefer, perhaps, or a genuinely superior knowledge of<br/>\nstandard Japanese<br/>\nmartial terminology?  I&#39;m prepared to adopt new terms<br/>\nand thank you for it -<br/>\nbut I&#39;ll need some documentation beyond what you&#39;ve<br/>\nsaid here.  You&#39;ve said<br/>\nwhat your &quot;correct&quot; terms are without saying why the<br/>\nterms I cited are<br/>\n&quot;incorrect&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHavent we discussed Shuriken etc in the recent past -<br/>\nmaybe worth looking at the archive onthe yahoo site.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we have.  I believe I mentioned the same thing<br/>\nabout shaken vs.<br/>\nshuriken then, but nobody responded to it that time. <br/>\nLook forward to your<br/>\nresponse now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n<br/>\n      Gereg Jones Muller, Master-at-Arms<br/>\nThe Silk Road School of Sword and Self-Defense<br/>\nHome:  831-335-1395    Mobile:  831-234-5216<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Musashi&#39;s _Book of Five Rings_ had a hell of a<br/>\nlot more influence on me than the ninja craze that hit a few years later.<br/>\n(And of course, my mother had Hiroshige and Hokusai prints around the house<br/>\nfrom the time I was born.)<br/>\nA few years ago, someone asked another teacher in the area, &quot;What does it<br/>\ntake to open a Ninjitsu school?&quot;  The teacher thought about it a second and<br/>\nsaid, &quot;A black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a business license.&quot;  Which pretty<br/>\nwell sums up my attitude to 90-plus % of what is called Ninjitsu today.<br/>\nI&#39;ve talked with Steve Hayes, and one of my old students ran Frank Dux&#39;s<br/>\nsecond school back in the &#39;80s, before he got disillusioned with Dux&#39;s cult<br/>\nof personality.  Neither of them impressed me much with the quality of his<br/>\nbackground.  (Dux&#39;s fighting skill was remarkable, but it was mostly<br/>\nmilitary; and &quot;Bloodsport&quot; represented neither his style nor his<br/>\nwish-fulfillment history with any accuracy.)  As far as the craze for<br/>\nNinjitsu goes, in fact, I have seen precisely one &quot;Ninja&quot; film - some Sho<br/>\nKosugi silliness that turned up on late-night TV a few years back - and my<br/>\ncomment to Nate was precisely in hopes that I would _not_ be lumped in with<br/>\nthis sordid batch of bad research and willful myth-information by the<br/>\nserious minds on this list.<br/>\nSo if being a ninja wanna-be got &quot;the best of us&quot; hooked, then I guess I&#39;m<br/>\nnot one of the best of you.  And if that really were the best of you, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe spikes and the stars are all known as shuriken.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is certainly true:  at least outside of Japan:  but then a great many<br/>\nthings are &quot;known&quot; inaccurately.  (Witness the person who found a web-site<br/>\nclaiming the 47 Ronin killed the Shogun!)  So permit me to ask if you have<br/>\npositive knowledge that the term &#39;shaken&#39; is incorrectly applied to the<br/>\nstars, etc., and likewise that &#39;shuriken&#39; is correctly applied to them.  As<br/>\nI say, I&#39;m pretty serious about my accuracy, and I always desire to learn<br/>\nmore and to refine my knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthe spikes are better know as Bo-shuriken<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I&#39;m interested in learning the sources for this information.  No<br/>\noffense, but what I have is your word on one hand, and Gruzanski&#39;s<br/>\nMasaki-Ryu information on the other (and I do thank you for providing me<br/>\nwith that footnote).  If what you say about Masaki-Ryu as the source for<br/>\n_Spike and Chain_ is correct, then why should that not be regarded as<br/>\naccurate?  Have you reason to believe that Masaki-Ryu is not a legitimate<br/>\nstyle, and that its terminology is therefore to be dismissed?  And if so, on<br/>\nwhat grounds do you make that claim?  Another style&#39;s terminology that you<br/>\nprefer, perhaps, or a genuinely superior knowledge of standard Japanese<br/>\nmartial terminology?  I&#39;m prepared to adopt new terms and thank you for it -<br/>\nbut I&#39;ll need some documentation beyond what you&#39;ve said here.  You&#39;ve said<br/>\nwhat your &quot;correct&quot; terms are without saying why the terms I cited are<br/>\n&quot;incorrect&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHavent we discussed Shuriken etc in the recent past -<br/>\nmaybe worth looking at the archive onthe yahoo site.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we have.  I believe I mentioned the same thing about shaken vs.<br/>\nshuriken then, but nobody responded to it that time.  Look forward to your<br/>\nresponse now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGereg Jones Muller, Master-at-Arms<br/>\nThe Silk Road School of Sword and Self-Defense<br/>\nHome:  831-335-1395    Mobile:  831-234-5216</div>",
