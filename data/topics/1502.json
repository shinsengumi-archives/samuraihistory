Chivalry was an ideal as much concerned<br/>\nwith courtly love and Christian devotion as with<br/>\nconduct in warfare. Much of samurai-based literature<br/>\nwas similarly focussed, upon ideals. &#39;Heike<br/>\nMonogatari&#39; extolls the virtues of usurping Taira<br/>\nwarrios and the rather rougher Minamoto from the more<br/>\nrural east, and as Yoritomo shows he was as cutthroat<br/>\n(pragmatic?) as anyone else. The whole machinery of<br/>\nthe Kamakura bakufu/Hojo regency collapsed fifty years<br/>\nafter the second (attempted) Mongol invasion, largely<br/>\ndue to the fact the samurai who served were not<br/>\nhandsomely regarded, since it was a defensive<br/>\ncampaign.
