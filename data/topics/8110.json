You can&#39;t say anyone was the greatest<br/>\nsamurai, because samurai were a large group of people who did different<br/>\nthings. Not all samurai were soldiers/commanders/sword instructors etc.,<br/>\neven in the 16th century and before. Some were purely administrators or<br/>\nteachers or whatever.

If someone puts forth a set of criteria and an<br/>\nargument as to why Musashi were to best fit that<br/>\ncriteria for GSE(tm), then we&#39;d have an intelligent<br/>\ndiscussion going on. The problem is that it&#39;s<br/>\nimpossible to define GSE(tm) whatsoever.<br/>\nUnfortunatlely, the fanboy crowd has this perception<br/>\ngained from hollywood/games/etc. that is fed by the<br/>\nBushido mystique and Edo-period concepts of, as<br/>\nTurnbull said, the &quot;Lone Samurai&quot;, heavy on martial<br/>\narts and philosophical ideals that were codified in<br/>\nthe mid/late Edo period. Sadly, this neglects almost<br/>\n600 years of samurai history. (If you take 1000 as a<br/>\nbase, 1877 as the end, that&#39;s almost 900 years. 600<br/>\nyears would be 2/3 of the history of the samurai, when<br/>\n99% of the development, wars, etc. took place, and<br/>\nwe&#39;re just going to IGNORE IT? Insanity.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing superlatives is always dangerous. It&#39;s hard<br/>\nenough to define someone like Michael Jordan as the<br/>\nbest basketball player ever, and most people will<br/>\nagree with you. It&#39;s infinitely harder to say that X<br/>\nwas the GSE(tm), especially when you don&#39;t explain<br/>\nyour reasoning and criteria. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

That&#39;s what &quot;GREATEST&quot; means. We live in<br/>\nthe age of Sportscenter, where they throw that term<br/>\naround constantly without regard to the meaning of it.<br/>\nSome Joe Schmo gets considered the &quot;greatest&quot; for<br/>\nmaking a tackle.

I&#39;m going<br/>\nto ask the experts--the greats who&#39;ve played the game,<br/>\nthe people who get paid to analyze, the<br/>\ncoaches...these are the people who really know what it<br/>\ntakes to be the best. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimiliarly, I&#39;m not going to accept the statement that<br/>\n&quot;Musashi is the greatest&quot; because people ignorant of<br/>\nactual Japanese history know his name. This is<br/>\nprecisely my problem with this whole topic. People who<br/>\nKNOW Japanese history can come up with many other<br/>\nexamples (as I did in the previous email) of people<br/>\nthat, depending on your criteria, could be considered<br/>\n&quot;great samurai&quot;. Why would I go ask someone who&#39;s<br/>\nknowledge of Japan and the samurai came from Onimusha<br/>\nand the 3 weeks of karate classes he took in Hoboken,<br/>\nNew Jersey?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad once used this example with me: Do you know who<br/>\nChet Atkins was? I guarantee you that Eddie Van Halen,<br/>\nJimi Hendrix, and anyone else who became famous<br/>\nplaying a guitar knows. He was possibly the best<br/>\nguitarist of all time--not the most famous, but the<br/>\nbest. All the great guitarists after him know who he<br/>\nwas, and studied him. The point is that most<br/>\nfamous/widely known does NOT equal best. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

He was 5 time<br/>\nNBA Most Valuable Player. 6 time NBA finals MVP.<br/>\n1987-88 Defensive player of the year, and voted all<br/>\nNBA defensive team 9 times. Voted All-NBA first team<br/>\n10 times. Holds the NBA record for most seasons (10)<br/>\nleading the league in scoring. 13 time All-Star.<br/>\nThere&#39;s not enough space to go into all the records<br/>\nhe&#39;s got. He dominated the NBA the way no one with the<br/>\npossible exception of Wilt Chamberlain did--and not<br/>\neven Wilt made his teammates better like Jordan. The<br/>\nvast majority of sports pundits don&#39;t even question<br/>\nthat Jordan is/was the best NBA player ever. There is<br/>\ntoo much evidence, both statistics and championships,<br/>\nthat show he was the best. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;ll grant that modern sports documents things<br/>\nmuch better than 17th century martial arts. However,<br/>\nthat&#39;s EXACTLY why your argument is flawed, James. You<br/>\ncan&#39;t say &quot;Musashi was like Michael Jordan, so he was<br/>\nthe best ever&quot;, because you can&#39;t show me WHY he was<br/>\nlike Michael Jordan. Did he set records? Win<br/>\nchampionships? No--because he wasn&#39;t competing in<br/>\nsports. It&#39;s apples and oranges. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are researchers who claim that Musashi&#39;s famous<br/>\nduel with Sasaki Kojiro didn&#39;t actually take place,<br/>\nothers who claim that Musashi actually ordered some of<br/>\nhis disciples to ambush Kojiro, etc. I don&#39;t see<br/>\nanyone claiming that Jordan didn&#39;t take the final shot<br/>\nof the 1998 NBA Finals against Utah, that it was<br/>\nreally Scottie Pippen. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than relying on a flawed analogy to a modern<br/>\nsports icon (an analogy which gets blocked faster than<br/>\nme trying to take on Shaq one-on-one), why doesn&#39;t<br/>\nanyone build a real case for why Musashi is The<br/>\nGreatest Samurai Ever(tm)? Why, if you try, will you<br/>\nfail to convince me that he is said The Greatest<br/>\nSamurai Ever(tm)? <br/>\n<br/>\nPRECISELY for the reason that James&#39;s analogy fails.<br/>\nYou can list out Jordan&#39;s accomplishments, records,<br/>\nchampionships, etc. They are directly quantifiable and<br/>\ncomparable to other NBA players. You can debate<br/>\nwhether Jordan&#39;s 6 MVP&#39;s are better than Bill<br/>\nRussell&#39;s 5 MVP titles, etc. Maybe you have to take<br/>\ninto account different era&#39;s, level of competition,<br/>\nposition played, etc., but you&#39;re still comparing<br/>\napples to apples. <br/>\n<br/>\nContrast this with the Greatest Samurai Ever(tm)--what<br/>\nare the criteria? For some, it might be impact on<br/>\nhistory--Minamoto Yoritomo, Hojo Tokimune, Tokugawa<br/>\nIeyasu, etc. might be your nominees. For some, it may<br/>\nbe patronage of the arts--Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Oda<br/>\nNobunaga, etc. Perhaps it&#39;s tactical and strategic<br/>\nacumen as displayed as a commander of troops--Oda<br/>\nNobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Minamoto Yoshitsune,<br/>\nTakenaka Hanbei, Uesugi Kenshin, Takeda Shingen....and<br/>\non....and on... Maybe it&#39;s individual courage and<br/>\nloyalty? Benkei, Torii Suneemon, Kusunoki Masashige,<br/>\nTorii Mototada, Yamanaka Shikanosuke, the 47 loyal<br/>\nretainers of Ako, and many more would apply.<br/>\nIndividual prowess on the battlefield? Benkei again,<br/>\nYoshitsune, Kato Kiyomasa, Kamiizumi Nobutsuna... Made<br/>\nthe most of themselves? I think Toyotomi Hideyoshi<br/>\nwould win that hands down, but I&#39;m sure some could<br/>\nargue for others. Contibutions to samurai thought?<br/>\nYoritomo, Ieyasu, Kusunoki, Imagawa Ryoshun, Kato<br/>\nKiyomasa...and yes, for GoRin no Sho you could put in<br/>\nMusashi.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are those, perhaps, that consider individual<br/>\ncontributions to the martial arts, and Musashi would<br/>\ndefinitely be a candidate for this. But so would about<br/>\n3 members of the Yagyuu family, Kamiizumi Nobutsuna,<br/>\nTsukahara Bokuden, and others. Is that enough to give<br/>\nMusashi GreatestSamuraiEver(tm) status? Over all the<br/>\nother criteria I&#39;ve mentioned, and all the other<br/>\nsamurai I&#39;ve mentioned? In my mind, no--to give him<br/>\nBest Ever status, you&#39;ve got to explain WHY he&#39;s<br/>\nbetter than every other samurai in history. <br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Jordan? We can show (and anyone who saw him<br/>\nplay knows) why he was the best to ever play<br/>\nbasketball. Miyamoto Musashi? Being the most<br/>\nwell-known and talked about duelist doesn&#39;t even make<br/>\nhim the best duelist, much less the Greatest Samurai<br/>\nEver(tm).
