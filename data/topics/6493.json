            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1144200761\">Flight control: The ancient art of falconry takes a perch at <br/>\nBoston&#39;s MFA<br/>\nBy Chris Bergeron / News Staff Writer<br/>\nThursday, January 6, 2005<br/>\n<br/>\nWith their fierce eyes and cruel talons, falcons seemed perfect <br/>\nsymbols for Japanese samurai. <br/>\n <br/>\n     As wild birds of prey or trained hunters, their lethal beauty <br/>\ntouched a deep chord in warriors whose bushido code valued courage <br/>\nand loyalty as the supreme virtues. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The ancient sport of falconry provides a gorgeous window into <br/>\nthe art of the Edo period of Japan (1615-1868) in an informative <br/>\nexhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Through majestic folding screens, lovely scrolls and delicate <br/>\nink paintings, &quot;Pursuits of Power: Falconry and the Samurai, 1600-<br/>\n1900) uses a seemingly obscure subject to bring three centuries of <br/>\nJapanese history into vivid life. <br/>\n <br/>\n     It also includes four armor suits, decorative stirrups, <br/>\nwoodblock prints and rare manuscripts. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Anne Nishimura Morse, MFA curator of Japanese Art, said the <br/>\nexhibit should equally satisfy aficionados of Asian art and anyone <br/>\nwho appreciates rare works of beauty. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Visitors who cannot tell a goshawk from a falcon or Tom <br/>\nCruise&#39;s &quot;Last Samurai&quot; from Toshiro Mifune&#39;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot; will find <br/>\nart that strikes the eye and stirs the soul. <br/>\n <br/>\n     &quot;I think there&#39;s so much interest in America today about the <br/>\nculture of the samurai,&quot; she said. &quot;This exhibit offers insights <br/>\ninto a segment of Japanese society that used falconry in a very <br/>\ncontrolled way to assert its role to the public.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\n     As organized by Rachel Saunders of the MFA&#39;s Department of <br/>\nAsian, Oceanic and Asian Art, the exhibit complements an ongoing <br/>\nexhibit, &quot;Lethal Elegance: The Art of Samurai Sword Fittings&quot; <br/>\ncurated by Joe Earle. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Taking swords and falconry as starting points, the companion <br/>\nshows explore intriguing connections between Japanese martial <br/>\nculture and aesthetic traditions. <br/>\n <br/>\n     While Western films romanticize samurai as fatalistic <br/>\nswordsmen, the Japanese equivalent of Wild West gunslingers, the two <br/>\nshows use lovely art to chronicle their changing role in society. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The exhibit raises interesting questions about how men of power <br/>\nin all countries manipulate symbols of authority. <br/>\n <br/>\n     A woodblock print of a famous warrior receiving a gift painting <br/>\nof an eagle conveys the prosaic realities of court life. In an <br/>\namusing scroll, a 17th century samurai impresses passing women by <br/>\nshowing off the hawk perched on his sleeve while Mount Fuji towers <br/>\nin the background. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Three centuries later, presidential candidates posture as <br/>\nregular guys by duck hunting or attending NASCAR. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The exhibit&#39;s several large folding screens on the subject of <br/>\nfalconry combine revelatory beauty with subtle social observation. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The samurai&#39;s powerful identification with the solitary hunters <br/>\nbecomes obvious. <br/>\n <br/>\n     In a 17th century six-panel folding screen, &quot;Hawk Eagle in a <br/>\nPine Tree,&quot; the winged subject&#39;s glinting eye and curved beak, <br/>\ncaptured in remarkable detail with ink on paper, stare down on <br/>\nviewers, conveying an impression of unquestionable authority. <br/>\n <br/>\n     &quot;Samurai used falconry as a way to reinforce their position as <br/>\nthe dominant political force,&quot; Morse said. <br/>\n <br/>\n     One can only wonder whether ordinary citizens regarded samurai, <br/>\nlike the winged hunters they admired, as merciless exemplars of <br/>\nnatural law. Rather than focus exclusively on falcons, the exhibit <br/>\nincludes art featuring eagles, goshawks and other hunting birds to <br/>\nexamine the changing roles samurai played in Japanese society. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The word &quot;samurai&quot; means &quot;those who serve&quot; and originally <br/>\nreferred to a military caste that adhered to a strict code of <br/>\nloyalty, courage and cultivation of traditional arts. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Starting around the 12th century, samurai served large <br/>\nlandowners called daimyos. After the feudal system was abolished in <br/>\n1869 and Japan was united under a military leader or shogun, samurai <br/>\nwere reduced to ceremonial roles as reminders of a heroic past. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The samurai&#39;s changing role from fighters to highly regarded <br/>\ncivil servants can be seen through the evolution of their body armor <br/>\nfrom purely functional equipment to largely ceremonial suits. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Once samurai had no more wars to fight, Morse said, they used <br/>\nrituals and art associated with falconry to cultivate an image of <br/>\nrefined strength. <br/>\n <br/>\n     As war became a thing of the past, Morse said extended falcon <br/>\nhunts became both &quot;outlets&quot; for martial energy and ceremonies that <br/>\nconfirmed loyalty and status. <br/>\n <br/>\n     A finely wrought fan is decorated with a scene of a royal hunt <br/>\nfrom the classic novel &quot;The Tale of the Genji&quot; by Lady Murasaki. A <br/>\nfabulously detailed horizontal painting, &quot;Horse Racing at Kato <br/>\nShrine,&quot; depicts several levels of Japanese life with the subdued <br/>\ncomplexity reminiscent of Flemish master Pieter Bruegel. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The exhibit reveals Japan&#39;s ability to absorb and refine <br/>\nactivities and art borrowed from Asian neighbors. <br/>\n <br/>\n     According to the informative wall , falconry came to Japan from <br/>\nKorea in the sixth century. Chinese scroll painting was adapted by <br/>\nJapanese artists who changed the proportions to suit homes where <br/>\npeople sat on floor mats rather than chairs. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Morse observed both exhibits record the samurai&#39;s changing <br/>\nworld in times of relative peace when they used valued objects like <br/>\nswords and hunting birds to assert the status their forebears earned <br/>\nduring the brutal civil wars of the past. <br/>\n <br/>\n     After social reforms restricted falconry to the imperial family <br/>\nin the late 19th century, great hunting birds remained potent <br/>\nsymbols in new art forms. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The exhibit includes a striking sculpted bronze eagle with a <br/>\nsilver patina given to the emperor in 1917. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Over time, images of hunting birds that once adorned samurai <br/>\narmor were used to decorate gowns worn by merchants and courtesans. <br/>\n <br/>\n     At its best, &quot;Pursuits of Power&quot; provides aesthetic thrills and <br/>\nhistorical insights. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The gold-dappled, six-panel folding screen &quot;Goshawk Mews&quot; <br/>\nreveals the splendor of imperial Japan. At the height of the Edo <br/>\nperiod, a yellow-eyed hawk soars down upon a raccoon. In a charming <br/>\n19th century woodblock print, a child cries when his hawk-shaped <br/>\nkite becomes entangled in a tree. <br/>\n <br/>\n     One of Japan&#39;s greatest warriors, Tokugawa Ieyasu, said &quot;a true <br/>\nsamurai must do more than act courageously in the heat of the <br/>\nmoment. The Way of the Warrior is fully achieved in times of peace <br/>\nas well as times of conflict.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\n     This exhibit offers informed glimpses into both worlds. <br/>\n <br/>\n     The Essentials: <br/>\n <br/>\n     The exhibit &quot;Pursuits of Power&quot; is on view through June <br/>\n13. &quot;Lethal Elegance&quot; is open through Sept. 26. <br/>\n <br/>\n     Open seven days a week, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is <br/>\nopen Saturday through Tuesday, 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.; and Wednesday <br/>\nthrough Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:45 p.m. On Thursday and Friday after 5 <br/>\np.m., only the West Wing is open. <br/>\n <br/>\n     General admission (which includes two visits in a 30-day <br/>\nperiod) is $15 for adults, $13 for senior citizens and students 18 <br/>\nand above, and free for children 17 and under when school is not in <br/>\nsession. <br/>\n <br/>\n     For general visitor information, call 617-267-9300 or visit the <br/>\nWeb site, www.mfa.org.</div>",
