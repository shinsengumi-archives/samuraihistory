I&#39;m afraid I may have<br/>\nto resign from the cover art contest.  I don&#39;t have the spare time or<br/>\nresources to get good original art for your cover.  I&#39;m pissed,<br/>\nbecause I know I could do it if I was able to get to some good art to<br/>\nget some good shots with my digital camera.  All the art I can find is<br/>\ntoo cliche or copyrighted and I won&#39;t submit anything that isn&#39;t as<br/>\ngood as it should be.  I knew what I wanted to do and maybe you might<br/>\nconsider doing this.  I wanted to use old, but crisp looking<br/>\ncaligraphy art to cover the back behind the book description.  Not the<br/>\nwhole kanji, but a corner of the piece that would show enough to make<br/>\nword and not simply brush strokes but not the entire piece.  It would<br/>\nbe up close and askew.  I thought that would be stylish and still<br/>\noffer a good background behind the book description.  On the front,<br/>\nranger&#39;s post inspired me to do something a bit similar.  Remember the<br/>\none we both liked with the zoomed in gold piece and black backdrop.  I<br/>\nhad been considering something similar before that because of the<br/>\nbirds.  When I saw that I knew what I wanted to do.  I took pictures<br/>\nof menuki pieces I got off the tsuka of one of my swords and created a<br/>\nsimilar looking cover as the one ranger posted, but I need the back<br/>\nart not only to make the back but also to match the color for the<br/>\nbackground in the front or possibly use a shot of the free space on<br/>\nthe calligraphy art to give it more texture.  Anyway, I can&#39;t find<br/>\nwhat I need to make it as good as it should be.</div>",
