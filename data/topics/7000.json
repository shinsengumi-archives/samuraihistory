It wasn&#39;t the<br/>\nEmperor who made him a &quot;Fujiwara&quot;, it was his adoption<br/>\ninto the family. Similarly, nobody could &quot;make&quot; Ieyasu<br/>\na Minamoto--he had to concoct a family history that<br/>\n&quot;proved&quot; he was one by birth, whether it was true or<br/>\nnot. Both were fairly inventive about how they did it,<br/>\nin my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
