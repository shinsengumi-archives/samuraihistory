            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1531249711\">I do not live there now, but I recently returned to America after living in Tokyo for a while. As far as the swords go. The mass produced one you might be able to get in if you are a budoka. I did not try to take mine with me, but I have seen on a number of budo forums that others have without any problems. I would suggest you look into such forums to see how they did it. The treating of foreigners was in my experience generally pleasant and kind. I personally never really had a bad experience interacting with Japanese. Even with my bad Japanese they were very kind and patient with me while I tried to explain what I was trying to say. Just one time a police officer stopped me on the street and asked to see my passport and look into my bag. He was very polite about it though and he apologized afterwards. However, like anyplace, you will probably have bad experiences also. Someone I knew was waiting for her train one day and an old lady cut in front of her and yelled in Japanese &quot;no foreigners&quot;. As far as your job, working for a language school is usually worse than working in a regular school. I have heard both good and bad, plus of course it depends on what company you work for. Many of them seem to over work their teachers with low pay and little benefits. Not to scare you off... just do not expect a relaxing vacation of sightseeing with having to work a little to make ends meet. You will probably be paid barely enough for living expenses. I knew many teachers, both language schools and regular schools also to be fair, that had to take second jobs and/or tutor in order to pay their bills, or to get extra money in order to do fun things. Plus it depends on where you work and live, some places are cheaper than others. If you will be living in Tokyo, like I did, it can be very very expensive. Learn where to save money as much as you can. But, you might be going into a really good company so it is hard to say such things will certainly happen, but do not be surprised if they do. However, in my opinion if you love Japanese culture and really want to live there then it is worth such sacrifices and I would do it if I had to in order to live there again. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;James&quot; &lt;veritas.quest@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To anyone in the group who lives in Japan.

There is nothing they hate more than armed foreigners. I heard (I never bought one there) that if you buy one at a souvenir shop that they must be shipped to your home outside Japan. I can guarantee they will  take them away at customs.<br/>\nAs for how they treat Gaijin, it varies. Some will really like you and want free English lessons or date you. Then others (like at my former job, mostly older people), will discriminate against you and cause problems. Discrimination is illegal in Japan, but like my lawyer told me when I tried to sue for an on the job injury, no Gaijin will ever win in a Japanese court. <br/>\nAll places have good and bad.
