Since Japan belived in <br/>\nsome form of conformity at the time, left handedness was not well <br/>\nrecived and often left handed people were forced to be right handed. <br/>\nAlso they way samurai walked on roads forced them to be right handed, <br/>\nsince the sword was on the left side, they often walked on the left <br/>\nside of the road, as not to bang their sword on someone. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no disadvantage for being left handed and using a sword with <br/>\nthe right, aside from a minor discomfort at first, you grow out of <br/>\nit. In some sword styles the left hand controlled the power of the <br/>\nsword, the right controlled direction. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for left handed styles, I do not know completely, maybe it was a <br/>\nstory arch to make the character look odd compared to the rest of <br/>\nsociety. There are some styles of iaido though that teach left handed <br/>\ndraws, the saya still on the left side though. Such a draw can be <br/>\nseen at the end of Sanjuro.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaikeru</div>",

Some were asking why they couldn&#39;t learn left handed. For kyudo it <br/>\nis impossible for a number of reasons. First the viewing area is invariably <br/>\non the right in the dojo. Second, in battle formation, archers firing from <br/>\nany side etc. would cause confusion in the ranks. Third, (and most <br/>\nimportantly), the yumi is curved in such a way that it cannot be fired <br/>\nproperly from a left-handed stance.<br/>\n  In addition, the grip of the yumi is one of the more difficult aspects of <br/>\nkyudo for the beginner to master. Being left-handed is actually a bonus in a <br/>\nright-handed stance.<br/>\n<br/>\nM.J.Peters<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

Assuming that the unit of land area<br/>\nis derived by squaring this we get: 11898.446 metres, or call it 1.19<br/>\nhectares, not eight. A hectare being a lump of turf measuring 100 x 100<br/>\nmetres. And for those of us who don&#39;t know their hectares from their<br/>\nHectors, the above translates to a smidgen under 3 acres, okay for the<br/>\npedants amongst us 2.975 (a hectare being 2.5 acres) :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a guide, traditional rice production generates between 1 to 5 tonnes<br/>\nof rice per hectare per annum, depending upon the quality of the land<br/>\nand upon how many growing seasons per year you can get, which varies<br/>\nbetween one and three. A koku, is 180 litres of rice, which is about 135<br/>\nkg (ish) in the sack. Which means that roughly 1 cho of land should<br/>\nproduce somewhere between 8.8 and 44 koku per year, which is more or<br/>\nless the same figure of 30 koku that some one else suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the idea of three functioning farms per chou makes my brain go<br/>\nsproing!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk</a></div>",
