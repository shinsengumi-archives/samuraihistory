Most of these curse things are attached to <br/>\nsome specific wrong or other which is often reversed in Shintoh <br/>\npractice by holding some sort of annual commemorative festival. A good <br/>\nexample of this is the Soga brothers. This is written about in the book <br/>\nAvatars of Vengence. So, even in a Japanese context it doesn&#39;t make a <br/>\nwhole lot of sense. As for Buddhist practice, the idea here is that you <br/>\ninherit things from your own past lives not from your ancestors. There <br/>\nare a few ancestor worship religious traditions in Japan which might be <br/>\nof interest in the context of this ancestor&#39;s curse business.</div>",

One way to look at  <br/>\nthis though, would be to accept it as a very cool way to find out  <br/>\nabout your Japanese heritage.<br/>\n\tYou need to look into your family history and see if you can  <br/>\nidentify the people or events responsible for the curse. Then of  <br/>\ncourse you&#39;ll have to learn about esoteric religious practice in  <br/>\nJapan, which ceremonies of exorcism have been performed and which  <br/>\nones might help to lift the curse.<br/>\n\tYou&#39;ll want to study the language and necessarily will have to know  <br/>\nyour  cousins better. this might make a cool documentary done  <br/>\ncorrectly or a good book. The idea at least is more interesting than  <br/>\nmany of the &quot;I lived in Japan&quot; books out there.<br/>\n\tBe careful of course, you could end up spending a lot of money on a  <br/>\nfraud or get caught up in a cult, but the chance to learn about who  <br/>\nyou are, and perhaps face a real demon is too tempting. I say this  <br/>\nhas to be your personal mission, not one we can help much with but  <br/>\nthat I would love to hear about.<br/>\n\tGo for broke!<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 24, 2006, at 5:41 PM, Natalie wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I was born in Japan, Japanese mother, caucasian father.

Not <br/>\nmuch more to say, other than I don&#39;t think family curses are real... <br/>\nat all, but that is my own possibly eccentric and idiosyncratic <br/>\nopinion.
