Ieyasu and Hideyoshi were clearly in <br/>\nvassalage positions to Nobunaga (allies and vassals are very different things); <br/>\nand Ieyasu chose to put himself in a vassalage relationship to Hideyoshi rather <br/>\nthan keep fighting him. The choice was vassalage or enmity; there was no <br/>\nalliance option.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It signalled the ending of the &#39;sengoku&#39;.These three were Oda<br/>\n&gt; Nobunaga,Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Ieasu Tokugawa;all of them were great<br/>\n&gt; generals in their own right.They formed alliance to bring Japan to gradual<br/>\n&gt; unification.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not really accurate, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nobunaga was assasinated by one of his generals but Hideyoshi<br/>\n&gt; continued what Nobunaga began.After he avenged the death of  Nobunaga he<br/>\n&gt; worked to establish firm control of his rein in power.Though a brillant<br/>\n&gt; military genius Hideyoshi could not claim the title of shogun because of his<br/>\n&gt; humble origins.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ironically, the title of Kanpaku -- which he did take -- is vastly more exalted <br/>\nthan Shogun. At least in terms of imperial connection and relationship with the <br/>\nthrone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Actually he is a peasant from Totomi,also the province of<br/>\n&gt; Nobunaga;and became foot soldier in Nobunaga&#39;s army.He was promoted to become<br/>\n&gt; a military commander because of his spectacular brillance.Before his death he<br/>\n&gt; appointed Ieasu as one of the! regents to his young son Hideyori.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When Hideyoshi died it marked another beginning in the fortune of the office<br/>\n&gt; of the Shogun.The Tokugawa Ieasu did not keep up to the promise of becoming a<br/>\n&gt; protector to the heir of Hideyoshi.Ieasu being too concerned of the supremacy<br/>\n&gt; of his family against all the other daimyos when he led an army with a<br/>\n&gt; coalition of western daimyo, attacked the eastern daimyo under another regent<br/>\n&gt; appointed by Hideyoshi for his son named Ishida.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, not quite. Ieyasu was the leader of the EASTERN alliance. Mitsunari was <br/>\ncalling the shots (although the nominal leader was Môri Motonari) of the Western <br/>\nalliance. And Mitsunari had never been one of the regents.<br/>\n<br/>\nHideyoshi appointed a council of five elders (the go-tairô) to run things and <br/>\ntake care of Hideyori and see to his later rule. These five were the most <br/>\npowerful daimyô in Japan. He also appointed a council of five officials (the <br/>\ngo-bugyô) to deal with other matters. These were people Hideyoshi generally <br/>\ntrusted, but didn&#39;t have the political or financial sway than the elders did. <br/>\nMitsunari was one of the latter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This took place in the battle<br/>\n&gt; of Sekigahara.After this battle where he emerged as the victor,Ieasu took for<br/>\n&gt; himself the tiltle of shogun.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, he didn&#39;t. The emperor appointed him shôgun in 1603 (three years after the <br/>\nbattle). You can&#39;t TAKE the title of shôgun any more than any other <br/>\nimperially-awarded office or rank.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This did not pose any difficulty for him since<br/>\n&gt; he is of a Minamoto lineage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, maybe. The fact of his multiple genealogies -- with different backgrounds <br/>\n(Taira, Minamoto, Fujiwara, what have you) is well documented. In this case, the <br/>\nMinamoto one was more useful, and became the &quot;official&quot; one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe obliged the court to sanction his claim.The<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; title was later passed to his son and down to his descendants until the late<br/>\n&gt; 19th century.The offfice of the Shogun was later abolished under the Meiji<br/>\n&gt; restoration.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was during the Tokugawa period that the daimyo were classified into two<br/>\n&gt; categories: the &#39;fudai-daimyo&#39; & the &#39;to-zama daimyo&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I&#39;m not mistaken, Hideyoshi also used that distinction to identify those who <br/>\nwere his vassals and those who were his Vassals -- people who&#39;d been with him <br/>\nsince day one vs. those who joined up later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The former literally<br/>\n&gt; means &#39;heridetary-vassal lords&#39; which implies that they were a family of<br/>\n&gt; former Tokugawa vassals and more trusted daimyo while the latter literally<br/>\n&gt; means &#39;outside lords&#39; which implies that they belong to a class of daimyo who<br/>\n&gt; have not yet gained the complete trust of the Tokugawa.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Specifically, fudai were those who were vassals *before* Sekigahara, and <br/>\neveryone else -- even those who had been allies then but not vassals -- were <br/>\ntozama. There&#39;s also a third category of daimyô: shinpan. These were daimyo who <br/>\nwere related by blood to the Tokugawa/Matsudaira house. A small, but very <br/>\ninfluential, group, the shinpan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tokugawa house itself was broken into three branches: the Kii, Owari, and <br/>\nMito Tokugawa (the &quot;go-sanke&quot;), which were set to provide an heir for the <br/>\nshogunal seat if the main line of Ieyasu&#39;s son Hidetada failed to produce an <br/>\nheir. A few times (including the last shôgun), the heir came from one of the <br/>\nbranches. (In fact, one branch itself branched off to form a further three <br/>\nsub-houses.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTony<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony J.
