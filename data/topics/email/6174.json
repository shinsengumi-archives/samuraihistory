It can be amusing... for a few minutes, if &quot;Desperate housewives&quot; isn&#39;t on at the moment.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you could watch &quot;Ooku&quot; and get the same effect, just in period <br/>\nclothes instead ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: Gabriel Dodu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dodu_gabriel@...\">dodu_gabriel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello everybody!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;I have long thought whether to &quot;break the silence&quot; and ask something, seeing as newcomers (newbies) are not always welcome and especially because english is not my native language...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think Nate and some others object to bad English only from people who <br/>\nshould know better. Second languages are tough, I still can get a laugh <br/>\nwith some of my mistakes in Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Seeing that I am from the Eastern Europe, and books about Japan hardly get here (on-line shopping is out of the question for now, because, for example, Amazon does not cover my area - and also because I am somehow &quot;financially-challenged&quot; at the moment :D ), I mostly use the www. So, here is a list of sites that I use, please tell me if they are ok:<br/>\n&gt;2. Jim Breen&#39;s Japanese Page<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a great site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3. Nagasaki University Old Picture Database<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a great site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4. www.kanjisite.com<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you, I was unaware of this site and the random testing function is <br/>\nvery good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would also appreciate if you could direct me to some online japanese literature books (public domain, of course), since I can&#39;t buy any ( I know I ask much...but, hey, hope dies last...)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m spoiled rotten for libraries, so I usually get my history from them. <br/>\nI think there is a site that reprints old Japanese texts in Japanese but <br/>\nI forgot the link name.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
