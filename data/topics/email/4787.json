A daimyo ruled over a <br/>\nprovince<br/>\n&gt; and reported to the shogun, the military leader in Japan during the <br/>\n&gt; Edo period.

There were Shugos at that <br/>\ntime. Am I wrong?<br/>\nIndeed I think that the Daimyo is a title that born to be used by <br/>\nfully independent lords during the sengoku jidai, although I am clear <br/>\nthat in the Edo period they served like some kind of governors, but <br/>\nmore like princes, counts and duches in the european countries.<br/>\nRepeat, that is as long a I know, forgive me if I said something <br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nRodrigo Juri A. </span></blockquote></div>",
