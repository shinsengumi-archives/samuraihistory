Guess what people--there<br/>\n&gt; were dishonorable samurai, there were dishonorable<br/>\n&gt; knights...there are honorable people today. Get over<br/>\n&gt; yourselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW, Brandon, I haven&#39;t forgotten our outing--things<br/>\n&gt; have been kind of crazy here, hope you&#39;ll forgive me. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nate<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t it amazing how some tend to polorize groups of people.  Germans <br/>\nof WWII weren&#39;t all Nazis.  Japanese of the same period weren&#39;t all <br/>\nmonsters.  The thing I appreciate about eastern philosphy is that <br/>\nthey embrace the duality in nature.  Even an individual can be both <br/>\ngood and bad.  There is good and bad in every culture, country, <br/>\ncity...  I just hope that there is more good than bad in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Nate--I did venture out to the palace and took aboout 50 <br/>\npictures of Kusunoki.  My wife surprised me and planned the whole <br/>\nthing.  We can still do something else tho.  I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s <br/>\nmore to show me in downtown Tokyo.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon</div>",
