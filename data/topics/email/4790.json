When the daimyos took <br/>\nthis name for them, or whoever that chose it, they were thinking in <br/>\nthat figure of the 11th century? Or was just the &quot;great name&quot; thing?<br/>\n(Sorry if that thing was discussed earlier).<br/>\n<br/>\nRodrigo Juri A.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: I erased the former messages in order to limit the extension of <br/>\nthe post. If someone thinks that this is not right, please tell me.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael Lorimer <br/>\n&lt;mijalo_jp@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, there were daimyo as far back as the 11th Century, although <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they were very different from the daimyo of the Sengoku or Edo jidai. <br/>\nThe wealthier member of the rural peasantry were called &#39;myoshu&#39; <br/>\n(literally &#39;head of a named rice paddy&#39;). When the myoshu moved on to <br/>\nacquire more fields they became &#39;daimyo&#39; (literally &#39;great name&#39;). <br/>\nTheir duties included collecting dues for their lord, but by the late <br/>\n11th Century, many were making the rural situation even more <br/>\ncomplicated by placing their land under the indirect supervision of a <br/>\ndistant lord (eg; a Fujiwara noble or one of the larger Kenmon <br/>\ntemples).  These myoshu/daimyo were the foundations of the latter <br/>\njizamurai/ kokujin (basically the lower echelons of the military <br/>\nclass). <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; M.Lorimer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have been removed]</div>",
