I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get <br/>\nbetter answers, but allow me to comment on one or two of your <br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1) How long was the Uji bridge (width and length), or the width of <br/>\n&gt;the Ujigawa at this location?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know this. I do know that today the bridge is 155 meters <br/>\nlong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) The map on page 26 is not very detailed. Where is the Byodo-in, in <br/>\n&gt;relation to the Uji bridge and the box representing Nara shown on the <br/>\n&gt;map? Does anybody have a more detailed map of the region with the <br/>\n&gt;places marked and the topography?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have the book so I can&#39;t refer to what you are seeing. In <br/>\nany event, if you can read Japanese this is a very servicable map:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/uji-web/map.html\">http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/uji-web/map.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t read Japanese, then the Byoudou-in is in the lower-left <br/>\nhand corner of C4 (it&#39;s marked with a red dot that is also a <br/>\nhyperlink). The bridge (Uji Bashi) is right in the middle of C3. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3) Turnbull states that the Minamoto forces at the battle numbered <br/>\n&gt;300. Does anybody know the composition of these forces? He does <br/>\n&gt;mention that some were monks. How many?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>According to the Tale of Heike, it was 1000. This is probably <br/>\ninflated just like most old histories are. It might have been closer <br/>\nto 50 samurai. But I&#39;ll leave the rest to the experts. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a></div>",
