    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-167129811\">Now Kyle, I like that.  You have been fair with all of us by <br/>\nexplaining what you meant. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have some thoughts about the whole lineage thing.  I&#39;m not an <br/>\nexpert, so I hope Tony will correct me if I&#39;m way off.  I do believe <br/>\nthe practice of one on one combat existed in the early samurai <br/>\nperiod.  Even in the Gempei war many challanges were shouted to foes <br/>\nbased on the existing honor system.  Many Samurai did call out their <br/>\nlineage before a battle.  Although it seems silly to us now, we have <br/>\nto remember how isolated Japan was from the rest of the world.  They <br/>\nhad a system of fighting wars that was very different than any <br/>\nother...Until the Mongols invaded.  Then the Samurai began to wise <br/>\nup.  &quot;Hey, these Mongols don&#39;t really care about our family do they?&quot;  <br/>\nMy understanding is that the Japanese were totally unprepared to <br/>\nfight a war with an organized mongolian military machine.  The <br/>\nKamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But the samurai were <br/>\nprepared the second time, and the preparations/strategic philosophies <br/>\nthat followed changed the face of Samurai warfare.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInto the Sengoku is when Ashigaru are much more apparent in the <br/>\narmies.  Long after the lineage practice had been proven unwise by <br/>\nthe Mongols (I know, they were actually Korean and Chinese <br/>\nconscripts).  So at this point I can&#39;t see them doing it either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany years later, after a couple hundred years of peace, under the <br/>\nTokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is about the point that <br/>\nBushido is crystalized into what we know today.  Prior to the <br/>\npeaceful Edo Jidai, much of the &quot;honor sytem&quot; wasn&#39;t based on those <br/>\nhigh and holy precepts that everyone thinks the samurai lived by.  It <br/>\nwas only in the last years of the samurai that the bushido code would <br/>\ninfluence the population.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, I too get a little sick of generalizations.  I recently went <br/>\nto a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai and Kensei.  We were <br/>\ninformed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido code.  They were <br/>\nwarriors and role models that were bound by honor to better society.  <br/>\nThey helped everyone gain greater understanding by standing for <br/>\npeace, justice, and the American way (well, they didn&#39;t really say <br/>\nthat, but they might as well have).  Upon hearing this, I could hear <br/>\nTony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There were good and bad <br/>\nSamurai.  They didn&#39;t all live honorable and they Bushido code didn&#39;t <br/>\naffect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you must agree that they <br/>\nhad some system of honor.  How else could we quantify a good or bad <br/>\nsamurai?  But it wasn&#39;t &quot;Bushido&quot; persay.  Since &quot;Bushido&quot; did not <br/>\nexist in the Sengoku, it probably wasn&#39;t used to keep the troops in <br/>\nline.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate their troops but it may <br/>\nhave been much more simple and less dubious than you presume.  <br/>\nPromises of fame and fortune, political status, social status, pride, <br/>\nand land are other methods that could be used to obtain loyalty.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, I don&#39;t think that there was a universal conspiracy by <br/>\nleaders of the time, to devise a system to keep a brotha down.  That <br/>\nwas not the &quot;purpose&quot; of honor or bushido, although it (like anything <br/>\nelse) could be perverted and warped to serve sinister means.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kyle Segall&quot; &lt;<br/>\nklancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Try a little more than Shogun.
