    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-771917388\">Please don&#39;t get me wrong, I am sure that there are a great deal of honourable people in modern Japan (perhaps more, perhaps less than elsewhere, who counts?) but I think what we see by and large is not &#39;honour&#39; but &#39;face&#39;. Recently the owner of a large Chicken company in Kyoto Prefecture and his wife committed suicide after the company had been found to have continued selling their produce despite a huge number of chicken deaths due to Chicken Influenza. He did not kill himself because of a dishonourable, dangerous business decision, but because he was found out by the authorities. This was no &#39;honourable&#39; act of seppuku of death over surrender.<br/>\nThis tragic case is not alone. Reactionary bureaucratic corruption, a political and construction industry gravy train, marital infidelity, and widespread school bullying, to name a few other examples are rife (although obviously not just in Japan). A previous mailer correctly wrote that what is honourable is what is right (admittedly a subjective point of view, but there is always a certain lex naturae inherent in all societies), not just doing what is demanded of you (ie, obedience). Education in Japan, from Kindergarten to Uinversity is designed to cultivate a rigid hierarchical structure, where the uniformity of the &#39;ganbare&#39; attitude creates soild, unsurprising employees, rather than aspiring individuals. Before anyone accuses me of Japan-bashing, I am not. I live in this society, am married into it, and now work within its education system. <br/>\nThe Chushingura epics, or other historical figures like Sugawara Michizane or Minamoto no Yoshitsune are exemplars to be looked upto in Japanese society, not models for life. <br/>\nM.

What you had said seemed <br/>\nnot only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  <br/>\nYou had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense <br/>\nof honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos <br/>\nwere well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their <br/>\nsystem of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  <br/>\nIn fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a <br/>\nconformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must <br/>\nfit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is <br/>\nlost.<br/>\n  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s not because teenage boys couldn&#39;t find a girlfriend.  <br/>\nStudents, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot <br/>\nbear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.<br/>\nFor someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such <br/>\nblindness will prevent learning.  That&#39;s what this group is all <br/>\nabout.  Not making a snappy remark to make someone else look stupid.  <br/>\nIn this case, it was the snappy remark thet made Kyle look stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon  <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To Kyle Segall:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see <br/>\n </span></blockquote>below) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. <br/>\nThe point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it <br/>\nin the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai <br/>\nclass placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and <br/>\ntheir familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against <br/>\nNobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his <br/>\nfamily. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your <br/>\nfather were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad <br/>\nfamily.
