However, that&#39;s why I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to pursue the point further. The original<br/>\nreply smacked of overstatement and irony, though<br/>\nadmittedly it is difficult to tell tone on email. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Plus Tony doesn&#39;t need any defenders, although I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; caught errors a couple <br/>\n&gt; of times ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, he doesn&#39;t--but he wasn&#39;t the only one with<br/>\ncomments on the post. I had some, as did Naomasa298. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe man says he&#39;s not taking it personally, so I&#39;ll go<br/>\nwith it. He&#39;s obviously got quite a bit of knowledge,<br/>\nso I&#39;m eager to hear from Solomon some more. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
