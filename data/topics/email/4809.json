At least in terms of imperial<br/>\n&gt; connection and relationship with the <br/>\n&gt; throne.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I find it doubtful that he could&#39;t have taken the<br/>\ntitle of Shogun because he wasn&#39;t of &quot;Minamoto&quot;<br/>\nblood--neither was Oda Nobunaga, and he was offered<br/>\nthe title by members of the Court. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Actually he is a peasant from Totomi,also the<br/>\n&gt; province of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga;and became foot soldier in Nobunaga&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; army.He was promoted to become<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a military commander because of his spectacular<br/>\n&gt; brillance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Um, no, it&#39;s well documented that he was from<br/>\nNakamura, a village in Owari, Nobunaga&#39;s home<br/>\nprovince. Currently Nakamura is a district in the city<br/>\nof Nagoya. Many of Hideyoshi&#39;s later vassals,<br/>\nincluding Kato Kiyomasa, are also from Nakamura. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, not quite. Ieyasu was the leader of the<br/>\n&gt; EASTERN alliance. Mitsunari was <br/>\n&gt; calling the shots (although the nominal leader was<br/>\n&gt; Mï¿½ri Motonari) of the Western <br/>\n&gt; alliance. And Mitsunari had never been one of the<br/>\n&gt; regents.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>TOny, wouldn&#39;t that be Terumoto? Motonari was dead,<br/>\nright?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; This did not pose any difficulty for him since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he is of a Minamoto lineage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, maybe. The fact of his multiple genealogies --<br/>\n&gt; with different backgrounds <br/>\n&gt; (Taira, Minamoto, Fujiwara, what have you) is well<br/>\n&gt; documented. In this case, the <br/>\n&gt; Minamoto one was more useful, and became the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;official&quot; one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tony, why do you think he went with the Minamoto bio<br/>\nand the title of Shogun, as opposed to following the<br/>\nNobunaga/Hideyoshi pattern of more &quot;courtly&quot; ranks<br/>\nlike Dajo Daijin and Kampaku?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m supposing because he wanted to remain separated<br/>\nfrom the Court, having seen what it did to the<br/>\nAshikaga, but that&#39;s just supposition.<br/>\n<br/>\nNate <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
