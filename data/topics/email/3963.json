    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1772116059\">Dave,<br/>\nI hope that Kyle didn&#39;t upset you too much.  What you had said seemed <br/>\nnot only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  <br/>\nYou had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense <br/>\nof honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos <br/>\nwere well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their <br/>\nsystem of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  <br/>\nIn fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a <br/>\nconformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must <br/>\nfit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is <br/>\nlost.<br/>\n  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s not because teenage boys couldn&#39;t find a girlfriend.  <br/>\nStudents, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot <br/>\nbear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.<br/>\nFor someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such <br/>\nblindness will prevent learning.  That&#39;s what this group is all <br/>\nabout.  Not making a snappy remark to make someone else look stupid.  <br/>\nIn this case, it was the snappy remark thet made Kyle look stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon  <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To Kyle Segall:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see <br/>\n </span></blockquote>below) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. <br/>\nThe point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it <br/>\nin the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai <br/>\nclass placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and <br/>\ntheir familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against <br/>\nNobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his <br/>\nfamily. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your <br/>\nfather were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad <br/>\nfamily. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your <br/>\npedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has <br/>\ndozens of acounts. I ain&#39;t no kid, I have read about this subject for <br/>\nmany years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with me <br/>\nfine but a little manners on your part would be nice.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Kyle Segall <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 8:56 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Holy crap kid, do some freaking research.
