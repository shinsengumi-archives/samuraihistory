Yes, some samurai <br/>\n&gt;really believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to see <br/>\n&gt;that. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the <br/>\n&gt;peacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why it was written, during the Sengoku period offing your lord <br/>\nand taking his place wasn&#39;t considered a bad thing if you succeeded. You <br/>\ncould call Sengoku the Age of Treachery without stretching it. If Akechi <br/>\nhad succeeded, it would have gone done as a great feat and the Edo <br/>\nperiod would have been very different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eponymous13@...\">Eponymous13@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey.<br/>\n&gt;       There are such things as &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;dishonourable&quot; wars, this is true. <br/>\n&gt; One thing war always is, and that&#39;s UGLY.  There&#39;s no such thing as a <br/>\n&gt;&quot;beautiful war&quot;.  That&#39;s an oxymoron if ever I heard one.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some of the Italian wars of manuever were beautiful since the opposing <br/>\ntroops paraded around until out manuevered and then surrendered without <br/>\nfighting. Those troops either cost money or are citizens after all. Of <br/>\ncourse this rapidly ended when some bloody minded types showed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
