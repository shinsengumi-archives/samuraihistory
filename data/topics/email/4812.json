I suggest you not take things<br/>\npersonally. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had said Hideyoshi was born in Totomi, and he was<br/>\nactually born in Owari, I&#39;d want someone to tell me.<br/>\nBut I suppose that may just be me. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I sound upset in my message.Dont really want to be self-defensive; but how can you be very sure that I&#39;m really upset.Though I&#39;ll take note that you&#39;ve said that I sound upset & you&#39;re not really implying that I am really so but still you drag me to become upset.I was not upset while composing my previous message.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to this group and enjoy reading the discussions offered by those who answer the questions presented.I want to enhance my knowledge about the subject that&#39;s being discussed here and so I give further issues to tackle with regard to the topic that&#39;s being discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gladly take your suggestion not to take things personally;for in the first place I do not.Then why are we called a discussion group if after giving a reaction to the issues that had been touched recently someone will react in turn that I sound upset because someone took issue with what I&#39;ve said? <br/>\n<br/>\nAm I not corteous enough to admit my mistakes and acknowledge the person who pointed me out all of those?I&#39;ve repeatedly said that I appreciate it and thankful for it and I hope that the words that I type and send to be posted for our group to read will just convey that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt so happen that people send their corrections to your mistakes before you get any chance to correct it yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t reaaly want to take this personally & I&#39;ll never will.I just want friendly exchanges of knowledge and information and even opinions.And I believe that the people with interests to things connected to the samurai must have enough ethical sensibilty to respect that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solomon <br/>\n            <br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
