The fastest way to do this is to subjugate the neighboring <br/>\nwarlords. This is an action that results in the death of his father and younger brother and <br/>\nnot the least brings him to the attention of Hideyoshi and not in a good way either but <br/>\nintervention by the regents nephew Hidetsugu and Maeda Toshiie save his neck <br/>\nalthough he is forced to move to a smaller fief and send his wife to Kyoto as hostage. <br/>\nAlthough curbed of his lofty ambitions his friendship with Hidetsugu again lands him in <br/>\nhot water when Ishida Mitsunari arranges the downfall of the &#39;Unfortunate Hidetsugu&#39;, <br/>\nToshiie and Ieyasu save his neck and the flamboyant young warlord is sent to Korea <br/>\nwhere he wins great honors. Upon his return Hideyoshi is dead and Masamune allies <br/>\nhimself with Tokugawa Ieyasu thus assuring the survival of the Date family. An amazing <br/>\nstory from beginning to the end! <br/>\n<br/>\nDirected by: MASUDA Toshio / NISHIGAKI Yoshiharu <br/>\nCast: TAKAHASHI Hideki, NATSUYAGI Isao, TSUGAWA Masahiko, AKIYOSHI Kumiko, <br/>\nKITAOJI Kinya, ISHIBASHI Renji, TAMURA Ryo, WAKABAYASHI Go <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDid not realize that there was such a &quot;series&quot;.
