Some had no allegiance to<br/>\nthe Tokugawa at all (the Tozai daimyo) and paid the<br/>\nshogunate nominal due, but ruled their province like<br/>\nthey saw fit. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not like the daimyo was the appointed governor,<br/>\nreally, and was responsible for the province to the<br/>\nShogun, necessarily--more like he owned the province,<br/>\nand had to listen to the Shogunate and uphold it&#39;s<br/>\ndecrees, but more or less could do what he wanted<br/>\n(within limits) in his own domains. <br/>\n<br/>\nMake any sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Meiji restauration, the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; institution of the <br/>\n&gt; daimyo was abolished and the provinces were replaced<br/>\n&gt; by prefectures. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Essentially, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While The shogun was the highest Japanese military<br/>\n&gt; ruler during the <br/>\n&gt; Kamakura and Edo period.
