Owl&#39;s Castle<br/>\n(Fukuro no shiro) is nice. I&#39;m sure some of our movie<br/>\nbuffs will have more. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be amusing...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for a few minutes, if<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Desperate housewives&quot; isn&#39;t on at the moment.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most of the time I don&#39;t feel as if I&#39;m missing<br/>\nAmerican TV...then there are times...<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; See? Pull out not-very-useful fact and wave it<br/>\n&gt; around to distract people<br/>\n&gt; while you slip the other direction. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whatever works for you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the meantime, then, I shall be chastened to<br/>\n&gt; return to the pearl isle to<br/>\n&gt; learn more about how many soldiers you have to<br/>\n&gt; provide for every cho of<br/>\n&gt; riceland you own (and here I thought, all along,<br/>\n&gt; Koko was the name of the<br/>\n&gt; gorilla who did the sign language with a cat.  With<br/>\n&gt; a CAT! The cat can&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; sign language.  It was a doomed experiment).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I must say, your style, though bizarre, is refreshing.<br/>\nKind of like Tolkein on acid. <br/>\n<br/>\n What did the sandal-bearer and the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rain-hat carriers do?  Rain-hat<br/>\n&gt; carrier?  This, from a list on page 9 of Mr.<br/>\n&gt; Turnbull&#39;s Samurai (&quot;u&quot; not &quot;a&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; Armies: 1550-1615 Osprey book.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, the job titles are pretty self-descriptive, I<br/>\nshould think. Care to elaborate on your question?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You&#39;ve got all these ashigaro carrying all sorts of<br/>\n&gt; things, but to have a guy<br/>\n&gt; to carry rain hats?  Interesting.  And sandals?<br/>\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t people carry their<br/>\n&gt; own? Maybe they were artisans to make/create new<br/>\n&gt; ones when old ones wore out<br/>\n&gt; or damaged.  Still... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As in Europe, the more people at your beck and call<br/>\nfor utterly mundane things, the better off you must<br/>\nhave been. But sandal bearer, though it DOES relate to<br/>\nsetting the masters sandals out for him to step into<br/>\nwhen he steps down from the veranda, is also a bit of<br/>\na personal attendant position. Toyotomi Hideyoshi (aka<br/>\nHashiba Hideyoshi, aka Kinoshita Tokichiro, depending<br/>\non what stage of life you want) started out as a<br/>\nsandal bearer to Oda Nobunaga. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!
