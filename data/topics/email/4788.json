    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1141265590\">Well, there were daimyo as far back as the 11th Century, although they were very different from the daimyo of the Sengoku or Edo jidai. The wealthier member of the rural peasantry were called &#39;myoshu&#39; (literally &#39;head of a named rice paddy&#39;). When the myoshu moved on to acquire more fields they became &#39;daimyo&#39; (literally &#39;great name&#39;). Their duties included collecting dues for their lord, but by the late 11th Century, many were making the rural situation even more complicated by placing their land under the indirect supervision of a distant lord (eg; a Fujiwara noble or one of the larger Kenmon temples).  These myoshu/daimyo were the foundations of the latter jizamurai/ kokujin (basically the lower echelons of the military class). <br/>\nM.Lorimer<br/>\n<br/>\nrjuri &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rjuri@...\">rjuri@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nGreetings:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;zevlord&quot; &lt;LordZev@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Was just wondering if this is correct.
