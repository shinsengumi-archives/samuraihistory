    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1755562307\">Try a little more than Shogun. Akechi Mitsuhide wouldn&#39;t have been <br/>\nthought so poor had he actually succeeded in becoming Shogun (his <br/>\nalliances not fallen apart, the mori finding out about nobunaga&#39;s <br/>\ndeath before hideyoshi). Don&#39;t kid yourself into think he really did <br/>\nanything special. Just dumb.<br/>\nThe daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai <br/>\nreally believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to see <br/>\nthat. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the <br/>\npeacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.<br/>\nYou claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its true <br/>\nthat confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far <br/>\nfrom a system of honor, especially what you&#39;re thinking about. Think <br/>\nabout it; if you&#39;re a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what <br/>\nlittle time you have off, what room is there for the &quot;honor&quot; that <br/>\nyou think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do <br/>\nanything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure preaches <br/>\nabout may be true... but that wasn&#39;t really out of a sense of honor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the noble <br/>\nones. I doubt an ashigaru wielding a spear was shouting, &quot;I am so-<br/>\nand-so, from so-and-so village! Come get some!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sorry about the snappy remarks... I&#39;m just SICK of all these <br/>\nkids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for every <br/>\nage, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his actions. <br/>\nOnly famous for who he killed and how dumb he was in doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Jackson <br/>\n&lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To Kyle Segall:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see <br/>\n </span></blockquote>below) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. <br/>\nThe point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording <br/>\nit in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai <br/>\nclass placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and <br/>\ntheir familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act <br/>\nagainst Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name <br/>\nof his family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and <br/>\nyour father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from <br/>\na bad family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your <br/>\npedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has <br/>\ndozens of acounts. I ain&#39;t no kid, I have read about this subject <br/>\nfor many years and I will talk if I want to..
