    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1195390031\">To Kyle Segall:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see below) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai class placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and their familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your pedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has dozens of acounts. I ain&#39;t no kid, I have read about this subject for many years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with me fine but a little manners on your part would be nice.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kyle Segall <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 8:56 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Holy crap kid, do some freaking research.

I <br/>\n  believe this concept is a sort of fake conciencnesse created created <br/>\n  by the people at the top to make loyal soldiers to die for their <br/>\n  battles battle. And in fact this &quot;honor&quot; is the most dishounarble <br/>\n  thing to follow.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   I believe the only honor is the honor to all of mankind and our <br/>\n  fellow human beings. This honor includes not to kill another.<br/>\n  &gt;   What does everybody else think?<br/>\n  &gt;   Thanks for listening<br/>\n  &gt;   Jonny<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   Vladilen Blackthorne &lt;vladilen_blackthorne@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;   I&#39;m new to this site and I do not know much about samurai.

From what I know fromt <br/>\n  &gt;   hesite and others is it is the perfect life. at least for me  to <br/>\n  die <br/>\n  &gt;   for the word honor. I only wish I had been born about 250 years <br/>\n  &gt;   ago.. So maybe I could have fought int he battle of Shiroyama.. <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt;   died with the one thing I understand well I joined to learn  <br/>\n  more.. <br/>\n  &gt;   So I guess.. hi<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   ---<br/>\n  &gt;   Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;   Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n  &gt;   --- <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   Yahoo!
