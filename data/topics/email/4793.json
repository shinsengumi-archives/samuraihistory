With this huge pool of resources, and the decision during the tenure of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu to allow the hereditary holding of the post of Shugo. Pronounced &#39;taimai&#39; in the 14th Century, these figures with their local networks of warriors and landholders/workers (admittedly not necessarily exclusive groups), emerged as what are called by historians &#39;shugo-daimyo&#39;; a precursor/forbear to the Sengokudaimyo, and the later daimyo of the Edojidai.<br/>\nM.Lorimer<br/>\n<br/>\nrjuri &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rjuri@...\">rjuri@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nThanks a lot by this quick mending of my mistake.<br/>\nThis information raises a question of my own.
