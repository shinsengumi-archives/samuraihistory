First off - (and I need to make this<br/>\nclear) - &quot;Academic Journals&quot; essentially *will not* publish you, no<br/>\nmatter the level of your scholarship, unless you have some academic<br/>\ncredentials to back up your name. Which I think you know means that<br/>\nneither I, nor F.Seal, nor anyone else associated with the samurai<br/>\narchives could ever hope to get published.  I&#39;m subversively<br/>\nundercutting that bias by allowing anyone with the theories, ideas,<br/>\nand ability to make for a well written, academically sound, and<br/>\ninteresting research to be published. So above all else, I want it<br/>\nunderstood that I really don&#39;t care if someone lacks (or has) a PhD or<br/>\nMA after thier name if they can put together a good paper. The best I<br/>\ncan personally do is put &quot;MBA&quot; after my name, and that surely doesn&#39;t<br/>\nqualify *me* as a historian.  This would be a journal of independent<br/>\nscholarship, and that&#39;s my intention.  I do know a couple people<br/>\nactually qualified in the academic sense who have shown interest, but<br/>\nthat most definately *doesn&#39;t* exclude anyone who doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for &quot;how does this stand apart&quot;? - my aim is to focus more on the<br/>\nmilitary history, and the personalities of Japanese history, rather<br/>\nthan social issues, &quot;intellectual history&quot;, and how (for example)<br/>\nDaimyo administered thier lands, and all of the other stuff that is<br/>\nthe vogue of the academic journals. I want to publish the stuff that<br/>\npeople want to read, not the stuff that you are forced to write if you<br/>\nwant to get into an academic journal.  I have the business background,<br/>\nso I&#39;m already in the process of building the business foundation. <br/>\nAll that will be left are the articles themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am giving myself 4 months to organize the business side, as well as<br/>\norganize the potential editors and the &quot;checklist&quot;, if you will, of<br/>\nthe formats, expectations, and requirements, and my goal is to have<br/>\nthe articles ready to go in a minimum of 6 months from now.  I already<br/>\nknow how to go about publishing and distributing, so that monster is<br/>\nalready in it&#39;s cage. I&#39;ll probably create a seperate group or forum<br/>\nfor people interested in discussing the requirements of publication<br/>\n(how to format it correctly, what sources are and are not acceptable,<br/>\netc.), so if/when I do that, I&#39;ll let you know, but anyone interested<br/>\nin helping out in any capacity, let me know. I&#39;m going to need a basic<br/>\nsupport structure (editors, fact checkers, grammar nazis) on the one<br/>\nhand, and writers on the other.  I have no doubts this can work, and I<br/>\nalready know the costs involved, the main thing again will be &quot;you&quot;,<br/>\nthe writers and researchers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, don&#39;t let something so small as a few letters after your<br/>\nname dissuade you - Einstein didn&#39;t have a PhD when he came up with<br/>\nthe theory of relativity.</div>",

Yes, I would absolutely subscribe to such a journal.<br/>\nWhether or not I am qualified to write an article for such a journal, that<br/>\nis an entirely different question. Like Nina, and perhaps many others on the<br/>\nlist, I am just an enthusiast of Japanese history, not an expert. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne other question: have you considered how and S-A quarterly might be<br/>\nsimilar or different from Monumenta Nipponica or the Journal of Japanese<br/>\nStudies? Have you given any thought to what niche S-A quarterly might occupy<br/>\nto differentiate itself from those journals?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, kudos to you for the idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Kitsuno<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 19, 2007 6:31 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Prelim thought - S-A Japanese History Journal<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already posted this to the forum, but I want to get feedback here<br/>\nas well, since there are a lot more members.

The main issue to address, aside from wondering if anyone<br/>\nwould even want to buy it, is, I would need to gather enough articles<br/>\nto constitute a bi-yearly or quarterly journal. So these are the<br/>\ninitial questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. If the S-A published a history journal (actual paperback high<br/>\nquality books), with 4-6 articles, probably totalling 80-120 pages,<br/>\nwould you consider buying/subscribing?<br/>\n2.
