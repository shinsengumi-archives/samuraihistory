When the dust settled after the final Tokugawa triumph<br/>\nhe ended up with substantial holdings around Sendai.   He is a very colorful<br/>\nfigure partly because of he wore eye-patch and truly flamboyant helmets. <br/>\n  He<br/>\nsponsored a mission to Europe to visit the Pope and showed some partiality<br/>\ntowards Christianity and Christians until it was clear which way the <br/>\npolitical<br/>\nwinds were blowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNHK, the Japanese national broadcasting company, devoted a long mini-series<br/>\nto his life, called Masamune, the One-Eyed Dragon (Dokuganryu, I think), and<br/>\nreleased this mini-series on VHS and DVD some time ago.   I&#39;ve seen it <br/>\nlisted<br/>\nfor sale on various Asian media web-sites.  <br/>\n<br/>\nScott wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The specifing post reminded me of a question I had.
