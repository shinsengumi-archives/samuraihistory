If they did, we&#39;d either a. hear<br/>\nabout how the body was found by the Akechi, or b. how<br/>\nsome intrepid Oda samurai spirited away his head, to<br/>\nkeep it from falling into Mitsuhide&#39;s hands. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs regaring whether Nobunaga&#39;s suicide was honorable<br/>\nor not, I&#39;d say in this case, sure, since he didn&#39;t<br/>\nreally have a choice. He fought against the Akechi<br/>\nattack until he ran out of arrows and the situation<br/>\nwas hopeless, and retired to commit seppuku (as far as<br/>\nis known) only at the last minute. There was no avenue<br/>\nof escape, for him to &quot;fight another day&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, this attitude is perfectly accepted in<br/>\nthe military today--I&#39;ve had several discussions with<br/>\nfellow army officers where we all said we&#39;d save a<br/>\nbullet in our 9mm for us, should the prospect of being<br/>\ncaptured by the north Koreans (I was stationed twice<br/>\nalong the DMZ) in the event of a war. However, the key<br/>\nhere really isn&#39;t the prospect of dishonor--to any<br/>\ndecent enemy, I&#39;d fight until I couldn&#39;t fight<br/>\nanymore, and then surrender if there was nothing else<br/>\nI could do. However, Charles Jenkins notwithstanding,<br/>\nthe nK doesn&#39;t have a great reputation for treatment<br/>\nof enemy soldiers, as with most communist regimes. I<br/>\nadmire men like John McCain quite a lot, but I&#39;d be<br/>\nsorely tempted to let my wife collect on my insurance<br/>\nrather than face captivity under those conditions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question--where the heck does this &quot;Digest<br/>\nNumber XXX&quot; stuff come from?

I know that a short<br/>\nwhile before, Mishima made a movie where the pivotal<br/>\nscene was a seppuku (performed by him), a sort of<br/>\nforeshadowing, if you will. The scene was intensely<br/>\ngraphic, and if I believe correctly he actually did<br/>\ncut himself (on accident this time). Copious amounts<br/>\nof fake blood were used. This is third hand info, as<br/>\nI&#39;ve not seen the scene, and only had it described by<br/>\nmy Japanese lit teacher in college (a few years back).<br/>\nThe recreation of the recreation is recreated in the<br/>\nbiographical movie of his life. <br/>\n<br/>\n The poet<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; who wrote _The Narrow<br/>\n&gt; Road to the Far North_, even.

Being Japanese doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re required<br/>\nto commit seppuku.<br/>\nA legitimate point, to be sure.  But by way of background, my father used a<br/>\n.30-06 on himself as a way of redeeming his honour (an oversimplification,<br/>\nbut pretty accurate), and it&#39;s left me with a profound distaste for that<br/>\nmethod of departure.  I watched my mother deal with the emotional<br/>\nconsequences of the act for another ten years.  So I&#39;ve looked at the idea a<br/>\nlittle more intimately than most gaijin, I think, and my personal belief is<br/>\nthat there are better ways to go, no matter what the problem.  I feel - and<br/>\nit is strictly my feeling - that it&#39;s better to stand back up again and go<br/>\non, trying to heal one&#39;s honour in life, or (in warfare) to go down<br/>\nfighting.<br/>\nI compare Asano&#39;s seppuku in Inagaki&#39;s &quot;Chushingura&quot; with Mishima&#39;s - thank<br/>\nyou one and all for reminding me of his name - and in Mishima&#39;s I see a very<br/>\nhuman reaction to a degree of pain that I think excessive.  Within my own<br/>\npersonal structure of honour, and without slighting a number of very great<br/>\nmen who took this way out, seppuku is not a valid way of making a statement.<br/>\nWithout doubt it requires courage and immense fortitude (&#39;guts&#39; would be too<br/>\ncruel a pun), but by and large it still seems to me ultimately less<br/>\ncourageous than the ongoing effort to live and continue to grow, and to<br/>\nredeem honour in life.  Referring once again to &quot;Chushingura,&quot; I have more<br/>\nrespect for the bushi who elected not to die at once, but instead to make<br/>\ngood the pledges and debts of the han, than I do for Asano&#39;s inflexible<br/>\npride that took him to that end, at the cost not only of his life but of the<br/>\nlivelihoods of his samurai, his wife and children, and the commoners under<br/>\nhis care.  I regard power as properly an obligation, rather than a<br/>\nprivilege.  Giri - as I see it - requires a greater care for one&#39;s<br/>\ndependents.<br/>\nDon&#39;t mean to start a big philosophical argument, but you did ask why...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re thinking of Mishima Yukio, the author. It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t at a television station, it was at Ichigaya,<br/>\nthe then military academy, now the headquarters of the<br/>\nJapan Defense Agency (think the Japanese Pentagon).<br/>\nI&#39;ve stood in the spot where he did the deed. It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t simply a protest, it was a botched and horribly<br/>\nfailed attempt to get the students to rise up in a<br/>\ncoup--they laughed at him, and he withdrew to attempt<br/>\nhis fairly botched suicide.<br/>\n\tThank you for the corrections.

Englishmen were growing the sheep, but it was<br/>\ntheir Norman masters eating it:  so with &#39;cow&#39; and &#39;beef&#39;, &#39;sheep&#39; and<br/>\n&#39;mutton&#39;, &#39;pig&#39; and &#39;pork&#39;, we have the English term for the animal, but the<br/>\nFrench-derived term for the meat.<br/>\n\tThe comparison I&#39;ve made is between &quot;he ended his life&quot; and &quot;he blew his<br/>\nbrains out.&quot;  My understanding - notwithstanding my semi-flippant &#39;glad to<br/>\nbe gaijin&#39; comment - is that the peasantry didn&#39;t find the practise any more<br/>\nadmirable or comprehensible than many gaijin do, and hence used<br/>\n&#39;belly-slitting&#39; rather than a more polite term for the act.  Again, please<br/>\nfeel free to correct me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 11<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 1 Aug 2004 10:25:06 +0200 (MEST)<br/>\n   From: &quot;nattilla the nun&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nattilla@...\">nattilla@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: on suicide...<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;An inglorious and messy end for a<br/>\ndedicated man.&#39;&#39;<br/>\nNo way!<br/>\n\tWith no disrespect intended, I&#39;ll stick to my opinion on this - I refer you<br/>\nto Nate&#39;s summary of the &quot;fairly botched suicide&quot;.  If you attempt to follow<br/>\nthe traditions of your ancestors in your departure, and those traditions<br/>\ncall for a calm and composed reaction to horrible pain, while your emulation<br/>\nof the act results in being unable to hold still enough to do it with style<br/>\nand grace, then I think my description pretty accurate.  Note that I do not<br/>\ncriticise his honour:  but I cannot think that Mishima meant to make his<br/>\nexit so different from the calm and resolute endurance that seppuku is<br/>\nsupposed to entail.  I would have wished him a better ending, for it is<br/>\napparent that it meant a very great deal to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;This is one of those things that makes me intensely glad to be a gaijin,<br/>\n&#39;&#39;<br/>\nMishima is the person who makes me regret mostly that I am a gaijin.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOf all the people in Japanese history who have evoked that feeling in me, I<br/>\nconfess that Mishima is not on the list.  Musashi, yes.  Hidetsuna, yes.<br/>\n(He&#39;s the one who reportedly shaved his head to rescue a peasant child,<br/>\nscorning class privilege and social rank, in the episode Kurosawa borrowed<br/>\nfor &quot;Seven Samurai.&quot;)  Hiroshige and Hokusai, yes.  Mifune, yes again -<br/>\nbecause only in Japan, I think, can you have one of your great dramatic<br/>\nactors in the same person as one of your leading action stars:  Spencer<br/>\nTracy and John Wayne in one, so to speak.  The poet who wrote _The Narrow<br/>\nRoad to the Far North_, even.  (Yet another name I&#39;ve forgotten over the<br/>\nyears.)  Again, this is not meant to criticise you.  What is it about<br/>\nMishima that affects you so, if I may ask?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Nate Ledbetter wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Has nothing to do with the weapon being used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unless the blade is really dull, in which case it would be  &quot;jè.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; :P<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hara-yaburi --  &quot;jè - Which didnt seem to transfer well.  I tell<br/>\nya, yahoo can put a real damper on jokes sometimes.<br/>\nPerhaps, but even with my pitiful smattering of Japanese, I got a chuckle<br/>\nout of it.  Mostly a matter of context.  &quot;Belly-bashing&quot; or the like, I<br/>\npresume?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thanks to all of you who reminded me of Mishima Yukio&#39;s name, and<br/>\ncorrected my history.</div>",
