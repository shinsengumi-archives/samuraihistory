A character, reading from a book (probably a history book) stated that Japan did not have an army until 1868, the year that the Emperor Meji was restored.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to sound like a politician, but it probably depends on what you mean by an &quot;army&quot;.  You could argue that until the Meji restoration that Japan did not have a central army, on the grounds that before then it had clan based provincial armies.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the Shogun&#39;s army could be considered his own personal army as opposed to a national Japanese army. Certainly, the Emperor did not have an army.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, it&#39;s a great TV show and they usually get things right.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Burke<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 2/6/2004 5:16:09 PM Eastern Standard Time, &quot;Heishiro Mitsurugi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mitsurugi_guy@...\">mitsurugi_guy@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Last night, Feb. 5, CSI had a new episode where a colletion of 17th<br/>\n&gt;Japanese samurai antiques were stolen.
