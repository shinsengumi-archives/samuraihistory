The shogunate  at <br/>\nthe time of the opening had a model of a working steam engine (that they  <br/>\nbuilt), a working blast furnace and a model of wire communication. They also <br/>\nhad  access to modern (at the time) medical books. They knew what was coming, <br/>\nbut  they wanted to control the information as to keep  power.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then,  Japan  really were forced to be changed, to be revoluted to <br/>\nface with barbarians  through The pacific Ocean&#39;s war.<br/>\n<br/>\nForced? Not really,Once again it comes down to power and the control of  <br/>\nit. The shogunate held information so they could control it and prevent the  <br/>\ndaimyo&#39;s from getting it and using it to over throw them (which they did). <br/>\nThe  best example is firearms, which the at the end other Daimyo got a hold of <br/>\nand  used them to challenge the shogunate. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is much out there that is misunderstood about the Samurai.

They were never <br/>\nuniversal or absolute, often differing ideas took hold in different <br/>\nparts of the country. During the Edo period, it became much more <br/>\n&quot;codified&quot; and infused with Tokugawa-esque confusianism and was <br/>\npromulgated nationwide. The overall message was one of obedience to <br/>\nsocial mores and law and lord. It is seen today as a political tool <br/>\nused to suppress opposition but may have only been a sincere reflection <br/>\nof the ideals of the House of Tokugawa and not a calculated policy.<br/>\n\tI think you&#39;ll find the true ideals of the samurai in the chronicles, <br/>\nart and music from prior to the Pax Tokugawa...<br/>\n-t</div>",
