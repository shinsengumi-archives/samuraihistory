Jackson will produce and voice the hotly <br/>\nanticipated five episode anime series Afro Samurai with Japanese <br/>\nanime studio Gonzo and Fuji Television. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe tale spins around a black samurai, Afro, to be voiced by <br/>\nJackson, who is on a quest to avenge his father&#39;s death, <br/>\nmeeting &quot;enemies, friends and challenges along the way&quot;. Hopefully <br/>\nthe series will be more original than the storyline of &quot;antisocial <br/>\nwarrior avenging the wrongful death of his (insert relative of your <br/>\nchoice here)&quot;.  Jackson overflows with talent on the big screen, but <br/>\nAfro Samurai will need to pack a lot more punch than its initial <br/>\npress release to stand out in the anime crowd, even with his gravely <br/>\nvoice bringing life to the lead role.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe series blends samurai style with hip-hop, something the Spike TV <br/>\nfolks claim in their press release &quot;American audiences have never <br/>\nseen before&quot;. Guess the Spike TV guys haven&#39;t been keeping up with <br/>\nShinichiro Watanabe&#39;s latest effort, Samurai Champloo.</div>",
