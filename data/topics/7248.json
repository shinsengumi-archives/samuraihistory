This fictitious article <br/>\nwas designed to lift the moral of the Japanese army; however, the <br/>\nJapanese newspaper published this story as though it were totally <br/>\naccurate and true.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the 18th December 1947, the Nanking War Crimes Tribunal of China <br/>\nsentenced lieutenants Mukai and Noda to execution on the grounds of <br/>\nthis false story. The two were shot to death by a firing squad at <br/>\nYuhuatai, Nankingon the 28th January 1948. <br/>\n@The family of the bereaved; namely the younger sister of lieutenant <br/>\nNoda, Mrs. Masa Noda, the eldest daughter of lieutenant Mukai, Mrs. <br/>\nEmiko Cooper, and the second daughter Mrs. Chieko Tadokoro, in fear <br/>\nof the general media and press, have since led sad and bitter lives <br/>\nfor 50 or so years, labeled as the family of war criminals. However, <br/>\ntheir patience eventually wore out and on the 28th April 2003, they <br/>\nfinally went to the Tokyo District Court having decided to take their <br/>\nfirst and last piece of legal action, demanding the suspension of <br/>\npublication of certain texts, for official apologies to be published <br/>\nin newspapers and to claim compensation for damages.<br/>\n<br/>\n@The accused are:<br/>\n@(i)@@@Mainichi Shmnbun, who repeatedly reported untrue story and <br/>\nwho to this day have yet correct these fallacies or admitted they <br/>\nwere false,<br/>\n@(ii)@ @Katsuichi Honda, the author of the books gA trip around <br/>\nChinah, hThe Road to Nankingh andh Thirteen Lies by the Deniers <br/>\nof the Nanking Massacreh, who continues to write how the killing, <br/>\nwhich has been shown to be false, is true;<br/>\n@(iii)@@Asahi Shimbun and Kashiwashobo Publishing Company, who <br/>\ncontinue to publish the above mentioned in (ii) and other related <br/>\ntexts.<br/>\n<br/>\n@The Accuser, Mrs. Chieko Tadokoro and Mr. Yutaka Gohda <br/>\n(Representative of the Asian Friendship Association), friend of chief <br/>\nbarrister Mrs. Tomomi Inada, initiated the appeal, and with the <br/>\nsupport Of gThe Society of Answering the Spirits of the War <br/>\nHeroesh, gJapan Conferenceh, gJapan Policy Research Centreh, and <br/>\ngThe Society of Supporting Lieutenants Mukai and Noda of the Battle <br/>\nof Nankingh, The Society to support the 100- Chinese- soldiers- <br/>\nkilling-contest case was founded on the 28th June 2003. The Society <br/>\nis made up approximately 500 members.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless we win this court case, history textbooks will continue to <br/>\nstate incorrect facts, the press will go unpunished, Japanfs erratic <br/>\npolicy towards China will stay in the dark and the false items on <br/>\ndisplay in the Memorial Hall of the War Resistance against Japan in <br/>\nChina will remain on view forever.<br/>\n@In his article which appeared in the Seiron column of the Sankei <br/>\nShimbun published on the 15th July, 2003 Mr. Keiichiro Kobori, <br/>\nAdviser for the Society, writes Quote The story which appeared in the <br/>\nTokyo Nichinichi Shimbun regarding g100 solders killing contesth <br/>\nwas totally fictional and a total creation. The lack of apology and <br/>\nadmission of fallacy from Mr. Asami, writer of the false article, <br/>\nsince the war, is a serious issue. Many books, including gThe <br/>\nFallacy of the Nanking Massacreh written by Akira Suzuki, present <br/>\nthe arguments of many historians and researchers explaining how the <br/>\nkilling could never have taken place. gKatsuichi Hondah, writer for <br/>\nAsahi Shimbun, intentionally backed up the lies presented in gA trip <br/>\naround Chinah and does not admit to this.<br/>\nHowever, the fact that the Japanese army did not reject the article <br/>\nin the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun remains true. Thus it is the duty of <br/>\nthe former troop members to help rectify and make disappear the shame <br/>\nof the whole Japanese army by supporting this case.

What does someone <br/>\nthink about the popular martial arts films if he really knows what <br/>\ncan and cannot be done?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My wife gets upset when I start to complain during the movie,&quot; <br/>\nKnight admitted. &quot;It&#39;s not magic. Like Crouching Tiger, Hidden <br/>\nDragon, all the flying through the air. They&#39;d have to be <br/>\nsuperhuman.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did like the Kill Bill flicks, pointing out that most of the <br/>\nstunts were possible. &quot;The only thing is that if the girl in the <br/>\nlead did all those things, she would be really tired.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKnight, meanwhile, seems at peace with his life. His parents live in <br/>\nKissimmee, and he finds nothing strange about teaching his skills on <br/>\na quiet street in Central Florida to classes that include about one <br/>\nwoman for every two men.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We try to learn how to avoid altercation but be prepared if it <br/>\nhappens,&quot; Knight said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the impending Guinness record for apple slicing?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Before I had the record, it seemed like a big thing. Now, not so <br/>\nmuch. It&#39;s a steppingstone,&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nFootnote: When you enter the Tiger&#39;s Den, you must remove your <br/>\nshoes. I do the same thing at home, mainly because I hate to wear <br/>\nshoes.
