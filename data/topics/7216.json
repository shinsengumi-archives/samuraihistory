            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2001963190\">New weapon wielded in old tomb debate<br/>\nInformation disclosure law reveals uncertainty over emperor&#39;s graves<br/>\n<br/>\nBy REIJI YOSHIDA<br/>\nStaff writer<br/>\n<br/>\nA law enacted six years ago has given historians a new powerful <br/>\nweapon to challenge a long-held taboo preserved by the Imperial <br/>\nHousehold Agency: investigating the secrets of ancient emperors&#39; <br/>\ntombs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weapon is the public information disclosure law, which has <br/>\nallowed Noboru Toike, assistant professor at Den-en Chofu University <br/>\nand an expert on Imperial tombs, to access and obtain copies of <br/>\ninternal agency documents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe documents suggest that the agency, despite official denials, <br/>\nonce conducted academic studies to review the attributions for at <br/>\nleast 10 ancient tombs that it claims belong to emperors from the <br/>\nearly fifth century to the early 13th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nToike&#39;s discovery made headlines because it supported a widespread <br/>\nbelief by historians and archaeologists that the government&#39;s <br/>\ndesignations of ancient burial mounds as the tombs of emperors were <br/>\nmade on shaky grounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;These (documents) show the agency itself had questioned its own <br/>\nattributions of the tombs, and conducted academic research on them <br/>\nat least until around 1958,&quot; Toike told The Japan Times.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But today, the agency does not allow (scholars) to enter or <br/>\nexcavate (emperors&#39;) tombs for academic research. Their position has <br/>\nreceded&quot; from decades past, when the documents were compiled, Toike <br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, there are 112 burial <br/>\nmounds nationwide for all 124 past emperors, including Jinmu, the <br/>\nmythical first emperor, and Hirohito, the 124th, who fathered <br/>\ntoday&#39;s Emperor Akihito.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the tombs contain the remains of more than one emperor.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the consensus of Japanese archaeologists and historians is that <br/>\nthe government&#39;s claims on most of the ancient &quot;Imperial&quot; tombs are <br/>\nacademically unacceptable because they lack scientific grounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the tombs were designated as emperors&#39; tombs in the late <br/>\n19th century, just as Japan was trying to establish a modern state <br/>\ncentered on the emperor to compete with the Western powers. The <br/>\ndesignations on many of the tombs relied on references found in <br/>\nancient documents and folk legends.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Koichi Mori, a tomb expert and professor at Doshisha <br/>\nUniversity, archaeologists have found that only two of the <br/>\ngovernment&#39;s designations for the 42 tombs said to contain emperors <br/>\nwho reigned before and during the Kofun (burial mound) Period from <br/>\nthe third to seventh centuries are acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two are the tomb of Tenji, the 38th emperor, in Kyoto, and a <br/>\ntomb in Nara where the 40th emperor, Tenmu, and the 41st emperor, <br/>\nJito, are buried together.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Usually in Japan, no epitaphs were placed in ancient tombs to <br/>\nidentify their occupants,&quot; Toike said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So you can&#39;t determine the occupant of an ancient tomb with hard <br/>\nevidence. All you can do is to establish a hypothesis by examining <br/>\nthe form of the tombs, unearthed articles, historical documents and <br/>\nrelated geographical names,&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe route to Toike&#39;s discovery started two years ago, when he bought <br/>\nan old mimeographed booklet at a secondhand bookstore in Tokyo.<br/>\n<br/>\nToike, taking advantage of the information disclosure law, obtained <br/>\na copy of the same booklet from the Imperial Household Agency but <br/>\nfound it had additional pages and handwritten memos.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the pages in the agency&#39;s copy were dated 1958 -- an <br/>\nindication the relevant studies were conducted at least until that <br/>\nyear, according to the scholar.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe copy included a list of &quot;reference places&quot; managed by the <br/>\nImperial Household Agency. In the terminology of the agency, <br/>\nreference places refer to ancient tombs whose occupants have not <br/>\nbeen identified but could possibly contain a member of the Imperial <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list divided the reference places into four categories, <br/>\ndepending on the degree of likelihood that the occupant is from the <br/>\nImperial family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list included nine sites designated as possible emperor mounds <br/>\nthat were ranked &quot;2-A&quot; or &quot;2,&quot; meaning their chances of authenticity <br/>\nwere one below the top category.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I was surprised because the agency has consistently explained <br/>\nthat &#39;reference places&#39; are described as such because they have no <br/>\nidea who their occupants are,&quot; Toike said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he examined the booklet, Toike also learned about a special <br/>\nexpert committee established in 1935 by the predecessor to the <br/>\nImperial Household Agency to examine the ancient tombs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter obtaining more copies of agency documents concerning the <br/>\ncommittee, Toike found that it concluded that an ancient tomb in <br/>\nTakatsuki, Osaka Prefecture, should be designated as a reference <br/>\nplace because it could be the tomb of Emperor Keitai, who reigned <br/>\nduring the sixth century. The agency officially said Keitai is <br/>\nburied in the city of Ibaraki in the same prefecture.<br/>\n<br/>\nToike stressed the importance of conducting scientific probes on <br/>\nancient tombs, noting they could unlock a number of historical <br/>\nmysteries related to ancient Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost large tombs were built during the Kofun Period, when the <br/>\nImperial regime was in the process of creating the first unified <br/>\nstate that would control much of Japan for the first time, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nJapanese historians have long and repeatedly demanded that the <br/>\ngovernment allow them to conduct excavations of the &quot;emperor&quot; tombs.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaiming that the &quot;peace and calm&quot; of the late emperors must be <br/>\nmaintained, however, the Imperial Household Agency has refused to <br/>\nallow any excavation or scientific review of any of the tombs <br/>\ndesignated as being those of past emperors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe agency argues that excavations of the burial sites <br/>\nare &quot;tantamount to destruction&quot; of the tombs, where the Imperial <br/>\nfamily has performed traditional religious rites in honor of their <br/>\nancestors.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Toike said: &quot;The tombs should be first treated as historical <br/>\nsites to be studied and preserved under the Cultural Properties <br/>\nProtection Law.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japan Times: June 4, 2005<br/>\n(C) All rights reserved</div>",
