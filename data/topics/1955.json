Luckily <br/>\nI borrowed it from the library and did not buy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks, I&#39;ve taken a look, this one seems to be a 1.33:1 screen format, <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve also seen one being advertised 2.35:1 is that right...or has some got <br/>\n&gt;things a little awry?  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, one is a wide screen version and the other is normal, another way to <br/>\nexpress it is 4:3 (normal) 16:9 (wide). (I work with too much video!) <br/>\nWide screen was uncommon until the 50&#39;s, most older films were shot in <br/>\nthe 4:3 ratio. (former film major also)<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
