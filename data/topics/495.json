            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1863790555\">Question: I seem to recall reading from one source that the reason Mitsuhide <br/>\nslew Nobunaga is that while Nobunaga was besieging a castle he decided to <br/>\nburn it down. From what I remember, Mitsuhide&#39;s mother was inside and while <br/>\nNobunaga knew this he still set the castle on fire.<br/>\nProblem is I cannot find the source that I read this from. Does anyone know <br/>\nif this is indeed what happened?<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff M.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>",
