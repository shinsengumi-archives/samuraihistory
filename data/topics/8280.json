Both films, in many ways, deal with mythologies. But the<br/>\n mythologies come from different cultures, different sources. <br/>\n <br/>\n MAGNIFICENT SEVEN comes from Western American mythology, that of the noble<br/>\n gunfighter who helps Mexican peasants. When in fact most Western gunfighters<br/>\n were quite mercentary and many of them hated Mexicans. <br/>\n <br/>\n SEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the noble ronin who helps<br/>\n peasants. When in fact, most Japanese ronin were mostly interested in<br/>\n connecting with a clan. And they saw themselves as being apart from and<br/>\n superior to the farmers. <br/>\n <br/>\n However, the realities from which these mythologies spring from are quite<br/>\n different.

So maybe when comparing the two<br/>\n films they are a bit closer than one would think. Of course a better example<br/>\n would be to read Dashiel Hammet&#39;s &#39;Red Harvest&#39; and watch Yojimbo knowing<br/>\n that Kurosawa is a fan of detective novels.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;You notice that, in THE SEVEN SAMURAI, when the farmers come to recruit <br/>\n &gt;some ronin, most of the ronin turn up their noses -- that last thing on <br/>\n &gt;this earth that they would want to do is defend some farmers.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote> I think films in general are poor guides to history. Anerican westerns are<br/>\n for the most part phony as well having known people who actually lived in<br/>\n the period there. For really quick reads Anthony Bryant&#39;s books are pretty<br/>\n good and for a sloppy but readily available introduction one of the Turnbull<br/>\n books is OK.

Probably Holywood pride - they think<br/>\n&gt;they are the center of the world, why relegate someone to being a<br/>\n&gt;&#39;japanese&#39; director?

Mizoguchi and Ozu were <br/>\ngreat directors in their own right and if I had to use jidai-geki films <br/>\nto get a feel for historical Japan, I think these directors do a much <br/>\nbetter job than Kurosawa getting the social feel right. Along those <br/>\nlines, something like Twilight Samurai is probably a bit better as well. <br/>\nAs for the phrase Japanese director, I would give it two meanings, the <br/>\nobvious one and the one that means a director that copies Japanese film <br/>\nstyle and plot to the extent that their movies seem more like Japanese <br/>\nfilms that would normally only be made in Japan. I doubt they would play <br/>\nwell in America since the only great imported hits from Japan seem to be <br/>\nthe violent ones, anime excepted.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could make films as well as Ozu or others, I would take pride in it <br/>\neven if they were copies, but I&#39;m not Hollywood.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",

But he put a Japanese slant on all of these<br/>\nstories. I doubt that he was actually trying to emulate Shakespeare or<br/>\nDashiell Hammett. If he were, he would have set his films in England rather<br/>\nthan in Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\nSame with John Sturgis, the director of MAGNIFICENT SEVEN put an American<br/>\nslant on the SEVEN SAMURAI story. If he had really wanted to make a Japanese<br/>\nfilm, he would have set the film in Japan.Just because MAGNIFICENT SEVEN<br/>\ncame from a Japanese source, this doesn&#39;t make Sturgis a &quot;Japanese<br/>\ndirector.&quot; So therefore, I don&#39;t think that, in the same way, that you can<br/>\ncall Kurosawa a &quot;western director.&quot; Instead, one might say that these<br/>\ndirectors were influenced by the different cultures. <br/>\n<br/>\nNina<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of James Eckman<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 31, 2006 10:24 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: RE: Re: Re: Magnificent Seven<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nina.Boal@...\">Nina.Boal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just because many Japanese think of Kurosawa as a Western director <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t actually make him one.

I really liked THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. I saw it as a <br/>\nteenager (which was a long, long, LONG time ago  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the idea of a &quot;cowboy with a conscience&quot; who has a clear sense of &quot;right <br/>\nand wrong&quot; isn&#39;t at all like a 17th century Japanese ronin. The cowboys with a <br/>\nconscience and a clear sense of right and wrong weren&#39;t thrust into their <br/>\nroles as hired gunfighters. They were American, with the unique American culture <br/>\nof having freely chosen this path. Usually they were searching for adventures. <br/>\n<br/>\nA typical 17th century Japanese ronin usually started out life as a samurai <br/>\nwho lived in a castle and served a lord. Then something happened in his life; <br/>\nin the 17th century, it usually was that his clan was defeated and abolished. I <br/>\nremember one of the ronin in SEVEN SAMURAI telling his old pal Kanbei (the <br/>\nleader of the band of ronin) about how his castle fell and he barely escaped -- <br/>\nand thus became a ronin, a samurai with no lord to serve.  Unlike the American <br/>\ngunfighters, neither clan samurai nor ronin would choose their path; they <br/>\nwere born into it. And in the case of the ronin, fate came along and cast them <br/>\ninto the path of ronin. Mostly a ronin would want to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then we get to the &quot;code.&quot; One of the biggest misconceptions by <br/>\nwesterners is that Japanese samurai all lived by a written code of &quot;Bushido.&quot; In the <br/>\n17th century, no such code had ever been drawn up at all. Most clans had their <br/>\nown codes of conduct, mainly about how to behave as members of the particular <br/>\nclan. Some of these particular codes would discuss dealings with commoners, but <br/>\nsome did not. You can read some of these documents in the Samurai Archives <br/>\nMessage Board. But there were plenty of samurai who never bothered with these <br/>\ncodes. Same with the ronin of the 17th century. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou notice that, in THE SEVEN SAMURAI, when the farmers come to recruit some <br/>\nronin, most of the ronin turn up their noses -- that last thing on this earth <br/>\nthat they would want to do is defend some farmers. Especially when the farmers <br/>\noffer nothing more than room and board. These ronin are searching for fame <br/>\nand fortune and want to be recruited by a feudal clan, not some peasants. So the <br/>\nidea that most ronin would come eagerly to the aid of farmers is another <br/>\nmyth, another misconception. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s probably true that in the Old American West, most hired gunfighters <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to come to the aid of some Mexican peasants. But for different <br/>\nreasons. Western gunfighters didn&#39;t look for positions with a feudal clan -- <br/>\nmainly because feudal clans didn&#39;t exist in the U.S.A.  Most western American <br/>\ngunfighters chose their paths and were looking for adventures. Unlike the 17th <br/>\ncentury Japanese ronin, who were looking mainly to survive. Any American <br/>\ngunfighter could retire when he wished and take up farming or work in a bank or go <br/>\nto college if he chose. A Japanese ronin had none of these choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, 19th century American gunfighters and 17th century Japanese ronin <br/>\nlived in entirely different cultures. These factors must be remembered when <br/>\ncomparing THE SEVEN SAMURAI with THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.<br/>\n<br/>\nNina</div>",
