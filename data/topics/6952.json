            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1306678340\">The Wonder That Was (and is) Kyoto!, by John Erskine Banta<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site where the new capital was located was first settled in the <br/>\n6th century by the Hata family, immigrants from Korea, whose members <br/>\nwere skilled in silkworm culture and silk weaving. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeographically the area consisted of a fault basin, framed on the <br/>\nnorth, east and west by the Tamba Mountains. Two rivers, now known <br/>\nas the Kamogawa and the Katsuragawa, flowed down from the mountains, <br/>\nbisecting the basin before joining the Yodogawa (Yodo River), which <br/>\nemptied into Osaka Bay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the rivers providing easy access to the merchants and markets <br/>\nof Osaka, The Hatas gradually amassed great wealth through commerce <br/>\nin silk goods. Their success attracted the powerful Kamo, Izumo and <br/>\nOno families who built imposing residences in the northern districts <br/>\nof the basin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe population of the basin and the wealth of the families living <br/>\nthere continued to grow. In the late 700s the reigning emperor and <br/>\nhis ministers decided to move the Imperial capital from nearby Nara <br/>\nto the Kyoto basin. They chose to pattern the layout of the new <br/>\ncapital after the Tang dynasty Chinese capital of Chang&#39;an (modern <br/>\nXi&#39;an or Sian), which at that time was one of the largest and <br/>\ngrandest cities in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe new capital, christened Heiankyo (literally, Peace Capital), was <br/>\nlaid out in the shape of a rectangle, measuring 4.5 kilometers (2.8 <br/>\nmiles) from east to west, and 5.2 kilometers (3.2 miles) from north <br/>\nto south. The emperor and his entourage moved to the new city in <br/>\n794, beginning a golden age in Japan that later came to be known as <br/>\nthe Heian Jidai (Hay-ee-on Jee-die) or the Age of Peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaders of the powerful Fujiwara and Taira clans, which vied for <br/>\ncontrol of the Imperial Court by providing Imperial consorts and <br/>\nministers, built their residences in the Shirakawa and Rokuhara <br/>\ndistricts of central Kyoto. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther palatial residences and landscaped gardens proliferated. The <br/>\narts and crafts achieved new heights of sophistication. For the next <br/>\nfour centuries, Kyoto flourished as one of the brightest stars in <br/>\nthe civilized world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1185 clan leader Yoritomo Minamoto defeated his rivals in battle, <br/>\nhad himself named Shogun by the emperor, took complete control of <br/>\nthe country, and moved the administrative functions of the <br/>\ngovernment from Kyoto to Kamakura, a tiny seaside village 45 km (28 <br/>\nmi.) southwest of present-day Tokyo. Although no longer the seat of <br/>\nadministrative power, Kyoto continued to play a major role in the <br/>\ncultural life of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Kamakura government was replaced by the Muromachi Shogunate <br/>\nin 1333, the administration of the country was returned to Kyoto. <br/>\nOne of the first things the new government did was to break the hold <br/>\nthat Buddhist organizations in Nara had on the building of new <br/>\ntemples, and sponsor the building of dozens of temples, many of them <br/>\nhuge complexes, within the new city and on the surrounding <br/>\nmountains. <br/>\n     <br/>\nThe Muromachi period ended in 1568 after a long civil war that <br/>\ndevastated much of the splendid capital. In 1590, Hideyoshi <br/>\nToyotomi, the winner in this new clan struggle, began a major <br/>\nrebuilding program in Kyoto that included the beautiful Fushimi <br/>\nCastle and the lavishly decorated Jurakudai Mansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIeyasu Tokugawa, Toyotomi&#39;s successor, who founded the Tokugawa <br/>\nShogunate in Edo (now Tokyo) in 1603, continued to support Kyoto as <br/>\nthe Imperial as well as the cultural capital of Japan. To <br/>\naccommodate himself on his regular trips to the city, Ieyasu <br/>\ncommissioned the building of the famous Nijo Castle, which remains <br/>\ntoday as one of Kyoto&#39;s great treasures.<br/>\n     <br/>\nThe arts, crafts and commerce in general flourished in Kyoto during <br/>\nthe Tokugawa period, but after the Shogunate fell and the Emperor <br/>\nwas restored to power in 1868, the new central government moved the <br/>\nImperial Court to Tokyo, once again leaving Kyoto on the sidelines <br/>\nof history.<br/>\n     <br/>\nBut being shunted aside was to turn out to be a major advantage for <br/>\nKyoto as the new government in Tokyo led the rest of the country in <br/>\na rapid industrial revolution between 1870 and 1890. During these <br/>\ntwo frenetic and subsequent decades, Kyoto remained very much like <br/>\nit had been for generationsÂ—its castles, palaces, shrines, temples <br/>\nand traditional homes and shops intact.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning of the U.S.-Japan war in 1941, Kyoto&#39;s reputation <br/>\nfor its cultural and historical significance was such that American <br/>\nscholars and others who were intimately familiar with the city <br/>\npersuaded the U.S. government to put it off-limits to Allied bombers <br/>\nduring the conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill today, despite its postwar industrialization, Kyoto has 202 of <br/>\nthe country&#39;s National Treasures (20 percent of the total) and 1,596 <br/>\nof its Important Cultural Assets (15 percent of the total). <br/>\n<br/>\nAmong these treasures from the past: Kyoto Imperial Palace, Nijo <br/>\nCastle, Katsura Detached Palace, Shugakuin Detached Palace, Nishi <br/>\nHonganji Temple, Higashi Honganji Temple, Kiyomizu Temple, Yasaka <br/>\nShrine, Heian Shrine, and the beautiful Kinkakuji (Temple of the <br/>\nGolden Pavilion). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to these historical treasures, Kyoto has three of the <br/>\ncountry&#39;s largest annual festivals (Gion, Heian and Aoi), along with <br/>\na number of other major annual and monthly events that, combined, <br/>\nattract millions of visitors each year.<br/>\n<br/>\nKyoto is also the birthplace of No, Kyogen and Kabuki, and is the <br/>\nnational center for Chado (the Tea Ceremony) and Ikebana (Flower <br/>\nArranging), two of Japan&#39;s most important cultural practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile examples of Japan&#39;s traditional culture can be found in <br/>\nabundance throughout the islands, Kyoto has retained its role as the <br/>\nprimary repository of the glories of old Japan, and no one can say <br/>\nthey have &quot;done Japan&quot; without a visit to the ancient capital. <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Erskine Banta is General Manager and Director of Radisson <br/>\nMiyako Hotel Tokyo</div>",
