            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-322933649\">Hi Antenor<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Kukishin Ryu likes to use several Bo. Octogonal, I have one made out of<br/>\nPeach wood. Strange choice I know but it was a gift, the usual Rokushakubo,<br/>\nand a Bo wihich has nine rings on it. 4 at each end spaced apart evenly, and a<br/>\nninth one in the middle. Not too sure why they have the rings, maybe to<br/>\nreinforce it. They have also in the past used kyushakubo. I tried to twirl one<br/>\nonce. I found it hard being 6ft (180cm)m so how a smaller Japanese managed,<br/>\nwho knows. Not very practical. Mostly the Bo are made from Oak.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Richardson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Dr. Antenor Camili Penteado&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:acpenteado@...\">acpenteado@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nHello My name is Penteado, Antenor Penteado.
