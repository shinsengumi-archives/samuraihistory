Toshiro Mifune as Tokugawa (Toronaga? Somebody could explain me this changes in the names). I found that the TV version is pretty faithfull to the Clavell&#39;s story. By the same, both of them has the same merits and problems. <br/>\nI also recommend Yoshikawa&#39;s works, but be prepaired. I do not if it is the original or the transaltion, but the narrative style is pretty hard and rude. Not like Clavell&#39;s (I am not saying that Clavell was superb in that terms). On the other hand, is a real japanese who writes, so there is a pretty much trustfull characterization of the japanese ways.<br/>\nThere are two ways to be be shogun. One is to be appointed by the emperor on such position, understanding that no other Shogun is in office. Of course, a warlord supported by large posessions and being far over any other lord in terms of power, could get such appointment without problem, if he wanted it. But also, tradition tells that only the members of two ancient families, the Fujiwara and Minamoto, could become Shogun.Tokugawa claimed blood links to this families, although evidence is questionable.<br/>\nThe second is to be heir of a previous Shogun.<br/>\nThe Shogun is intended to be the military governor of Japan. So, in the practice, his power is absolute. The Emperor was only a symbolic figure, just like today more or less.<br/>\nSo far, here there are lots of people that knows a lot more about this than me, so forgive me if I made a mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nriskxd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:riskxd@...\">riskxd@...</a>&gt; wrote:                                  Hi, just signed up<br/>\n <br/>\n I&#39;m into Japanese History and have been reading a book called &#39;Shogun&#39; <br/>\n by James Clavel.<br/>\n <br/>\n It made me wonder how exactly a daiymo became a shogun, what power he <br/>\n had and how he was in relation to the Emperor.<br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks, Please give me some information.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1983960221\">Well, first, let&#39;s take a look at what turnbull says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Samurai, A Military History&quot; (Turnbull, 1977, P. 145):<br/>\n&quot;The task of subduing the last of the Saito was entrusted to Toyotomi <br/>\nHideyoshi, who reduced their castle of Inaba-yama (now called Gifu) <br/>\nwith little difficulty in 1564.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is all he writes.  He doesn&#39;t specifically say that 1564 was the <br/>\nend of it, so he leaves it sort of open, which I think is perfectly <br/>\nacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Samurai Sourcebook&quot; (Turnbull, 1998, P. 216-217):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;THE SIEGE OF INABAYAMA, 1564- In 1564, Toyotomi Hideyoshi captured <br/>\nInabayama castle from the Saito for Oda Nobunaga.  As Inabayama was <br/>\nbuilt on top of a mountain, two attacks were launched, one that <br/>\ninvolved climbing, the other across the river.  Horio Yoshiharu <br/>\ndistinguished himself by opening the watergate to his atacking <br/>\ncomrades.  In 1565 Oda Nobunaga made Inabayama his headquarters and <br/>\nrenamed it Gifu.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTurnbull plainly states it was renamed Gifu in 1565.  In 20 minutes of <br/>\nresearch in my collection of Japanese language history books, I found <br/>\nsix books that contradict this.  The rest either didn&#39;t mention the <br/>\nsiege at all, or didn&#39;t put any dates to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Nihon meijo Souran (1999, P. 441):<br/>\n&quot;1567 - Oda nobunaga attacks saito tatsuoki&#39;s Inabayama castle in <br/>\nMino.  [It] falls, and is renamed Gifu.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Sengokushi Shimbun (1996, P. 109):<br/>\nstates that in 9/1567 nobunaga takes Inabayama, renames it &#39;Gifu&#39;, and <br/>\nchanges his seal to &#39;Tenka Fubu&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Sengoku no Kassen (1998, P. 78):<br/>\nOn the top of the page it states &quot;Eiroku 10 [1567]&quot;, and the title of <br/>\nthe section is: &quot;Nobunaga takes Mino - The seige of Inabayama&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Nihon no Eiyu 100nin (1998, P. 73):<br/>\nstates that in Eiroku 10 [1567], Nobunaga defeats tatsuoki, and makes <br/>\nInabayama his main base, and renames it Gifu, and changes his seal to <br/>\nTenka Fubu.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Rekishi Gunzo #1 (1987, P. 99) [Turnbull cites this book]:<br/>\nIn the timeline, for Eiroku 10, 8th month, it states that saito <br/>\ntatsuoki is defeated, and Inabayama falls.  Inabayama is changed to <br/>\n&#39;Gifu&#39;.  Again, Turnbull cites this. I would assume if he had <br/>\ncontradictory information he would normally have stated something like <br/>\n&quot;scholars disagree as to whether the fall of Inabayama took place in <br/>\n1565 or 1567.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t mention it.  Maybe in his next book.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Sengoku Jinbutsu 700 (2001, P. 106):<br/>\nEiroku 10 [1567] Nobunaga renames castle Gifu, and changes his seal to <br/>\n&#39;Tenka Fubu&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on the above, I&#39;d have to go with Lamers -it appears that it is <br/>\ncommon knowledge that the final fall of Inabayama was 1567.  Granted, <br/>\nmost of the above are secondary sources, and could be considered <br/>\n&#39;popular history&#39;, I would tend to believe them over turnbull due to <br/>\nthe fact that not only do 6 sources state that the &#39;final&#39; fall of <br/>\nInabayama was 1567 and at that point was renamed Gifu, but also that <br/>\nthe Japanese authors probably have access to much more accurate <br/>\ninformation.  Another thing I notice is that Hideyoshi was not <br/>\nmentioned in a single source as having participated.  Not to say that <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t, just that no sources mention him at all.  Sure, there could <br/>\nhave been plenty of attacks on Inabayama in 1564/5, but if it didn&#39;t <br/>\nfall until 1567, that makes the 1564/65 battles almost <br/>\ninconsequential.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the above reason, I just find it odd that after 20 years of <br/>\n&#39;research&#39;, Turnbull still states that Inabayama fell in 1564/5.  It <br/>\nwould be nice to know where Turnbull got his info, but his being <br/>\n&#39;popular history&#39;, it doesn&#39;t precisely cite.  Sure, he could be <br/>\ncorrect, and the Japanese sources not, but.....<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other various things Turnbull puts in that don&#39;t match up, <br/>\nsome of which came from Papinot, which he conveniently doesn&#39;t cite, <br/>\nbut obviously took greatly from.  Could be fun picking it apart, <br/>\nalthough I don&#39;t see what purpose it would serve.  Maybe to make him a <br/>\nbetter historian?  Or at least to more clearly cite his sources to <br/>\nprove us wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in good fun, of course.</div>",

Basically I&#39;m not a historian just a guy<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loves reading history so the type of history books I would prefer to<br/>\nread<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are &#39;popular&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the trouble is, there&#39;s a *perception* of academic vs. popular.<br/>\nMost<br/>\n&gt; academic books are no more difficult to read, they just tend to have a<br/>\ntighter<br/>\n&gt; focus on a specific topic or issue. One is free to ignore the seriously<br/>\n&gt; academic trappings (usually found in the footnotes, which publishers,<br/>\nfearful<br/>\n&gt; of the book being deemed &quot;too academic,&quot; tend to hide in the back of the<br/>\nbook<br/>\n&gt; and make reading it by academics difficult due to the constant flipping<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; and forth) and just read the book. I don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s read<br/>\n&quot;Heavenly<br/>\n&gt; Warriors&quot; or &quot;Hired Swords&quot; -- two of the best texts on the development of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; early warrior culture -- who hasn&#39;t come away with a deeper understanding<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the material and where samurai came from and how they developed. Though<br/>\n&gt; universities use these in upper-level courses in J. history, they are<br/>\nextremely<br/>\n&gt; accessible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The same goes for &quot;Gates of Power&quot; and any number of other books. If one<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; interested in a specific area, one should be willing to at least take a<br/>\nlook at<br/>\n&gt; the books before dismissing them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess trained historians are interested in such academic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; books, but I&#39;m just looking for a good story.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you consider a good story? &quot;Hired Swords&quot; is full of interesting<br/>\n&gt; anecdotes about the evil taxman and how they behaved (I enjoy the quoted<br/>\nletter<br/>\n&gt; of complaint that talks about how they ride their horses right into<br/>\npeople&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; houses... &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So in reply to Mr. Byants<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comment that people don&#39;t delve farther into the feild my feeling is<br/>\nthose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; books arn&#39;t very interesting to an amatuer historian.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No book is interesting unless you crack the cover and take a look inside.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; have been pleasantly surprised on more than one occasion by a book which,<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; though in my field, I was sure would bore me to tears. There are cases<br/>\nwhen I<br/>\n&gt; was right and was bored, but I&#39;m happy to say the ratio is in favor of<br/>\ngood.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for Massie, James<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mcpherson who wrote the Civil War history &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; said<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there was proffesional envy that his book sold well. Maybe this is the<br/>\ncase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with Massie (maybe not).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This happens. In fact, I&#39;ve encountered a bit of... well, difficulty... in<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; areas because of my Osprey books. While they&#39;re nothing I&#39;m ashamed of<br/>\n&gt; (although I really want to redo some of them!), there is a certain<br/>\nperception<br/>\n&gt; in some areas that I&#39;m not willing to do &quot;academic&quot; work. I&#39;m currently<br/>\ntrying<br/>\n&gt; to disabuse people of these efforts with translations of 14th. century<br/>\nJapanese<br/>\n&gt; literature and records.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In any event I&#39;m not that interested in what the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AHA thinks about an author, I liked his books and will read him again.<br/>\nAs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for Ambrose well I live in Japan (for some 8 years) so I haven&#39;t seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything about his case. If true its sad because he is a good writer. So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what I want to say is that I wish there were more popoular histories<br/>\nwritten<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about Japan. Imagine if someone wrote a book on the Meiji Restoration<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way Simon Schama wrote about the French Revolution, or a biography of<br/>\nOda<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga on the scale of Massies Peter the Great.  Wishful thinking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The trouble is, there&#39;s not much of a market in English on such exotic<br/>\nfellows<br/>\n&gt; who most people have never heard of; we generally have to aim for the<br/>\nmarkets<br/>\n&gt; that exist (academia), small though they be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s read &quot;Heavenly<br/>\nWarriors&quot; or &quot;Hired Swords&quot; -- two of the best texts on the development of the<br/>\nearly warrior culture -- who hasn&#39;t come away with a deeper understanding of<br/>\nthe material and where samurai came from and how they developed. Though<br/>\nuniversities use these in upper-level courses in J. history, they are extremely<br/>\naccessible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for &quot;Gates of Power&quot; and any number of other books.

I<br/>\nhave been pleasantly surprised on more than one occasion by a book which, even<br/>\nthough in my field, I was sure would bore me to tears. There are cases when I<br/>\nwas right and was bored, but I&#39;m happy to say the ratio is in favor of good.<br/>\n&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As for Massie, James<br/>\n&gt; Mcpherson who wrote the Civil War history &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; said that<br/>\n&gt; there was proffesional envy that his book sold well.

In fact, I&#39;ve encountered a bit of... well, difficulty... in some<br/>\nareas because of my Osprey books. While they&#39;re nothing I&#39;m ashamed of<br/>\n(although I really want to redo some of them!), there is a certain perception<br/>\nin some areas that I&#39;m not willing to do &quot;academic&quot; work.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-68210396\">Yes you raise some good points. Basically I&#39;m not a historian just a guy who<br/>\nloves reading history so the type of history books I would prefer to read<br/>\nare &#39;popular&#39;. I guess trained historians are interested in such academic<br/>\nbooks, but I&#39;m just looking for a good story. So in reply to Mr. Byants<br/>\ncomment that people don&#39;t delve farther into the feild my feeling is those<br/>\nbooks arn&#39;t very interesting to an amatuer historian. As for Massie, James<br/>\nMcpherson who wrote the Civil War history &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; said that<br/>\nthere was proffesional envy that his book sold well. Maybe this is the case<br/>\nwith Massie (maybe not). In any event I&#39;m not that interested in what the<br/>\nAHA thinks about an author, I liked his books and will read him again. As<br/>\nfor Ambrose well I live in Japan (for some 8 years) so I haven&#39;t seen<br/>\nanything about his case. If true its sad because he is a good writer. So<br/>\nwhat I want to say is that I wish there were more popoular histories written<br/>\nabout Japan. Imagine if someone wrote a book on the Meiji Restoration the<br/>\nway Simon Schama wrote about the French Revolution, or a biography of Oda<br/>\nNobunaga on the scale of Massies Peter the Great.  Wishful thinking.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mark E.

I have read &quot;Gates of power&quot; and might read the book on<br/>\n&gt; Yoritomo. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saw it in the bookstore and the apprehension I have is that it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a flesh and blood biography of him. I would much rather prefer to read<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; book on him written say in the style Amy Kelly wrote on Eleonor of<br/>\n&gt; Aquitane.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If she could write that kind of book on a famous person in the 12th<br/>\n&gt; century<br/>\n&gt; &gt; somebody could write one on Yoritomo. The other apprehension is that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yoritomo book is 8000 yen. For me a least its not a question of not<br/>\n&gt; wanting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to delve deeper into more serious works. Its that the feild of<br/>\n&gt; Japanese<br/>\n&gt; &gt; historigraphy is lacking in truly talented writers that can be found<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other fields eg Robert Massie, Simon Schama, Stephan Ambrose. That is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something that disappoints me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You either want popular history or an academic history; you<br/>\n&gt; unfortunately can&#39;t get both.  Out of the list you give above, Schama is<br/>\n&gt; the only exception to the generalization.  While Ambrose was trained as<br/>\n&gt; a historian, you need to be checking the newspapers more, he is under<br/>\n&gt; heavy fire for plagiarism and getting his facts screwed up.  I have yet<br/>\n&gt; to meet any AHA members who liked Massie&#39;s books as an ACADEMIC book.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe they are out there, but I haven&#39;t seen them come forward.  The<br/>\n&gt; same criticisms are leveled at Tuchman and Cantor&#39;s recent works.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best, Mark Hall<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Also just remembered you gotta go <br/>\nto the royal armouries in Leeds it has fantastic bushi exhibits, some <br/>\narmour 15 suits, and it emphazises the buke as a horse back archer.  <br/>\nI have visited three times spoke to curartor Ian Bottomley who wrote <br/>\nbook arms and armour of the samurai, nice guy saw bit behind the <br/>\nscenes.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1697927883\">Not to attack the sacred cow, but Turnbull can definately not be accused of being an acedemic, or a &#39;true&#39; historian.  Many of his books are filled with small errors and innaccuracies that he very obviously took verbatim from Papinot - although he NEVER mentions Papinot in his sources...  Looking at his books, his information, and his sources together, one has to wonder if he can even read Japanese at all...  <br/>\n<br/>\n*ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of Inabayama took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in Japanese, including a few he lists in his bibliography state it happened in 1567.  So you may be thinking, &#39;what&#39;s two or three years?&#39;  Well, what if I told you the battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could write a treatise on just the errors and uncited Papinot sources alone.  Not to mention a picture listed as an &#39;authors representation&#39; of something that actually looks suspiciously like a tracing of a picture in a Rekishi gunzo book. (Dont have his book or the Gunzo book on hand right now to cite which one)<br/>\nGuess because he&#39;s the only game in town he thinks he doesn&#39;t have to work at it anymore...?  I&#39;ve seen him mentioned as Stephen &quot;buy my books&quot; Turnbull in some post before, and I can see why.  Just take a look at his website.  You can&#39;t help but get the impression scholarship takes a definate backseat to profit.  guess I can&#39;t really blame the guy, though.  Gotta put food on the table somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;d rather read &#39;dry&#39; histories if they are more accurate than &#39;popular&#39; histories, although I&#39;d prefer to read an accurate popular history! (like A.J. Bryant&#39;s stuff!  At least you get the impression that he has a real interest in the subject, and can actually read japanese, and actually puts in the research!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, just a rant on my part, and I could very well be totally wrong.</div>",

And Blackthorne was loosely <br/>\nbased on the story of the english sailor Will Adams, who was likewise <br/>\nstranded in Japan around the end of the Sengoku Jidai and was &#39;adopted&#39; into <br/>\nthe Samurai world in a very similar way to that of Blackthorne.<br/>\n Indeed, I heard that when finally Adams was fully &#39;released&#39; (He was not a <br/>\ncaptive but was held indefinately for the &#39;use&#39; of the Tokugawa house who saw <br/>\nhim as a possible way to forge a trade agreement that was not aligned with <br/>\nthe Religious ideals of the Portuguese and Spanish traders.) And a boat was <br/>\nsent to bring to home he actually refused to leave Japan and settled into a <br/>\npart of Tokyo (Edo then..) that I believe is still called Anjin-cho in his <br/>\nhonour!<br/>\n The book follows the same basic line of history as the actual events and the <br/>\nnames are changed to avoid any problems with the story..It plays out well <br/>\nthough and can offer the reader an excellent way &#39;in&#39; to the world of the <br/>\nSamurai.<br/>\nEnjoy the read!<br/>\n Abayo..<br/>\nBen Sharples.</div>",
