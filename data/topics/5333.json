I was bitten by the bug<br/>\nat such a young age I cannot remember.  Always been interested in<br/>\nJapan as far back as I can remember, but didnt start really reading<br/>\nabout it till my teen years.  Just to try to give you some help.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if you have found it, but www.japanshoten.com offers a<br/>\nnumber of books to help you with Japanese.  I plan to get several of<br/>\nthem when I get the money to help suplement my classes at college.  My<br/>\nteachers use a series call Yookoso.  The author escapes me at the<br/>\nmoment , and I dont have my copy in front of me.  However, it is<br/>\navailable through amazon.com.  It does have it&#39;s own flaws, and a<br/>\nnumber of people I know that have been to Japan do not like it very<br/>\nmuch because of it&#39;s style.  But, it is better then nothing and they<br/>\ncome with either tapes or cd&#39;s.  Another good recourse from what I<br/>\nhear are the Genki series.  These can be found on japanshoten.com as<br/>\nwell as other places.  A Japanese friend of mine tell me that this is<br/>\nwhat many Japnese universities use to teach Japanese to their<br/>\n&quot;exchange&quot; students from other countries.  Hope this helps you out<br/>\nsome, and keep up the study.... just be carefull of where you learn<br/>\nfrom.  I am not saying this is you, but, too many kids in my Japanese<br/>\nI class have tried to learn Japanese through anime....scary and the<br/>\nteachers don&#39;t appreciate hearing &quot;but in _____ anime they said<br/>\n&#39;______&#39; and the subtitles said &#39;____&#39; so they must be right&quot;. *Hides<br/>\nunder the covers* scary otaku, scary otaku *lol*.
