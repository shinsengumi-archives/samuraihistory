RUOFF, Contributing Writer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPunishment and Power in the Making of Modern Japan <br/>\n<br/>\nBy Daniel V. Botsman <br/>\n<br/>\nPrinceton: Princeton University Press <br/>\n<br/>\nISBN 0-691-11491-9, 319 pp, $35 <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel V. Botsman, associate professor of Japanese history at <br/>\nHarvard University, has written a crisp, nuanced account of Japan&#39;s <br/>\ntransition to modernity by focusing on the transformation of the <br/>\ncountry&#39;s penal system. Disputing accounts that stress there were <br/>\nalready roots of modernity before the Meiji Restoration of 1868, <br/>\nBotsman argues that many Meiji Era (1868-1912) reforms-specifically <br/>\nthe establishment of a modern penal system-represented a clear <br/>\nrupture with the past. Even as Botsman emphasizes the discontinuous <br/>\nnature of many Meiji Era reforms, however, he challenges simplistic <br/>\naccounts that interpret the modernization of Japan&#39;s penal system as <br/>\nmarking a shift from barbarism to civilization. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike their counterparts throughout the world at the time, Tokugawa <br/>\nShogunate (1603-1867) authorities developed horrifying ways of <br/>\npunishing and executing criminals. Botsman provides graphic details <br/>\nof those punishments, including extreme forms such as the <br/>\ndomestically developed type of crucifixion pictured on the book&#39;s <br/>\ncover (numerous graphics augment the book&#39;s strengths). In addition, <br/>\npublic display of criminals&#39; corpses was a means for the authorities <br/>\nto warn people to behave. <br/>\n<br/>\nBotsman concludes: &quot;Tokugawa punishments were never acts of <br/>\nunthinking violence. They formed part of a sophisticated system for <br/>\nmaintaining order that was not entirely lacking in restraint or <br/>\ncompassion. For example, the fact that a retainer would be punished <br/>\nfar more harshly for stealing from his lord than from a social equal <br/>\nrepresented the need to uphold a particular status system. Moreover, <br/>\nthere was considerable room for benevolence in the system, and the <br/>\nauthorities often overlooked various offenses.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBotsman details how in the mid-19th century, representatives of <br/>\nWestern countries, without understanding the complexity of the <br/>\nTokugawa system of punishment, labeled it uncivilized and invoked it <br/>\nto justify extraterritoriality. This was the provision in the <br/>\nunequal treaties requiring that foreigners accused of crimes be <br/>\ntried by consular officials from their own countries rather than by <br/>\nJapanese officials. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo win the confidence of the Western powers, Japan&#39;s new leaders <br/>\ncreated a system of punishment characterized by modern jails based <br/>\non European and American models. They outlawed dramatic forms of <br/>\npublic punishment and decreed that executions be carried out only <br/>\nfor particularly heinous crimes and only by hanging. They otherwise <br/>\neliminated corporal punishment. In its place, however, the state <br/>\njailed more people, including thousands for dissenting against the <br/>\nnew government. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt took decades for Japan to convince the West that its modernized <br/>\nlegal system, which included a system of jails advertised as <br/>\nreforming criminals by putting them to work, showed the nation had <br/>\nreached a level of civilization that merited elimination of the <br/>\nunequal treaties. <br/>\n<br/>\nWestern visitors to Japan such as Isabella Bird, after observing <br/>\nprisoner work gangs, wrote approvingly of the practice, which <br/>\nsupposedly served both to better the prisoners and develop the <br/>\ncountry. Botsman, however, questions whether the practice of <br/>\nliterally working thousands of prisoners to death to extract coal <br/>\nand build roads, especially in newly colonized Hokkaido, represented <br/>\na higher stage of civilization. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe author&#39;s interpretation of the intersection of penal systems and <br/>\nmodernity becomes most fascinating with his account of Japan&#39;s <br/>\nacquisition of an overseas empire, the quintessential marker of a <br/>\ncivilized country in the late 19th century, as a result of its <br/>\nvictory over China in 1895. With its appropriation of Taiwan, Japan <br/>\nearned the right to institute a colonial penal system. <br/>\n<br/>\nBotsman&#39;s account of the double standard used to justify such <br/>\npractices as flogging, first applied to colonial subjects in Taiwan <br/>\nand then used extensively in Korea, demonstrates the blatant <br/>\nprejudice that underlays the placement of some countries into the <br/>\ncategory of civilized and others into the category of uncivilized <br/>\nduring the heyday of imperialism. <br/>\n<br/>\nJapan initially built a showcase prison in Taiwan&#39;s capital and <br/>\napplied the same system of punishment used in the homeland. Before <br/>\nlong, however, the colonial authorities concluded that the local <br/>\nChinese and Taiwanese were at such a low level of civilization that <br/>\nincarceration in a modern prison, far from being a reforming <br/>\npunishment, was a luxury. <br/>\n<br/>\nJapanese colonial authorities thereby decided in 1904 to institute <br/>\nflogging, which was outlawed in Japan proper, in Taiwan. According <br/>\nto Botsman, most Western commentators, far from condemning this <br/>\nhypocrisy, as did some ideologically consistent Japanese members of <br/>\nthe penal-reform movement, applauded the Japanese for having come to <br/>\nunderstand that civilized forms of punishment were ineffective in <br/>\nkeeping the natives in place. Far from undermining Japan&#39;s place in <br/>\nthe self-appointed club of civilized nations, the use of harsh <br/>\npunishments against colonial subjects earned Japan additional <br/>\nrespect from other imperialist powers that employed similar brutal <br/>\nmethods. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a sophisticated and yet accessible work of history that I <br/>\nrecommend heartily. <br/>\n<br/>\n* * * <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reviewer is director of the Center for Japanese Studies at <br/>\nPortland State University.(IHT/Asahi: July 2,2005) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\nSamurai Japan Japan airline <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYAHOO!
