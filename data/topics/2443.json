One group dealt with barbarians like<br/>\n&gt; Mongols and Manchurians in the North, which favored<br/>\n&gt; combining calvary and archers(usually on horse) and<br/>\n&gt; the other group in the South was specialized in<br/>\n&gt; dealing with the Japanese pirates who were very<br/>\n&gt; skilled in using swords and spears.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 300,000 Ming soldiers were from the Southern group<br/>\n&gt; specialized in the Japanese warfare.<br/>\n&gt; After the war, Yi dynasty also adopted and started<br/>\n&gt; manufacturing arquebus and put more emphasis on<br/>\n&gt; training the use of swords and spears.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With regard to the topics of diplomatic issues among<br/>\n&gt; Ming, Japan, and Yi dynasty, the following book will<br/>\n&gt; be of use:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Book of Corrections: Reflections on the National<br/>\n&gt; Crisis During the Japanese Invasion of Korea,<br/>\n&gt; 1592-1598 (Korea Research Monograph, No 28)<br/>\n&gt; by Song-Nyong Yu, et al (Paperback - December 2002)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Song-Nyong Yu was a prime minister during the war and<br/>\n&gt; was also a very close friend to Admiral Yi, Sun-Shin<br/>\n&gt; from the childhood. Admiral Yi did not hold any higher<br/>\n&gt; commanding position until he was appointed to command<br/>\n&gt; the western fleet through Prime minister Song&#39;s strong<br/>\n&gt; recommendation only a few years before the war. He was<br/>\n&gt; not even trained for the Navy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, the Yi Royal court published the military<br/>\n&gt; training manual for the use of spears and swords after<br/>\n&gt; the war. Its English translation is also available:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Muye Dobo Tongji : Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of<br/>\n&gt; Martial Arts of Ancient Korea<br/>\n&gt; by Muye Dobo Tongji, et al (Paperback - October 2000)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, for the TV series on the war, MBC broadcasted<br/>\n&gt; the TV series on the war in the late 80&#39;s when I was<br/>\n&gt; in the middle school. It was so good that it got an<br/>\n&gt; air through NHK(Japan). You may check both of<br/>\n&gt; broadcasting companies for more information.<br/>\n&gt; Also, KBS aired the documentray series on the war in<br/>\n&gt; 1995(?). It was not superb, but you can see real<br/>\n&gt; weapons used and the battle scenes not great in<br/>\n&gt; picture but constructed by a group of contemporary<br/>\n&gt; military officers and war experts.  I hope that this<br/>\n&gt; will help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                          Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                          Changsub Lee<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Cesare Polenghi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cepo@...\">cepo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It actually happened, in Korea, 1592-98.
