            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-976309621\">Actually the term samurai refers to someone who serves someone else. It <br/>\nis a variant of the verb to serve which I believe is/was samuru. There <br/>\nreally isn&#39;t anyone that started the samurai. The earliest uses of the <br/>\nword samurai refered to mainly house servants in the Heian period. <br/>\nSometimes these duties may have included guard duties. In time the term <br/>\nwould come to eventually have a mainly military context. One of the <br/>\nmore proper terms for literally warrior would be bushim .Bushi is <br/>\nmade up up 2 Chinese caharacters. One being@@which means military, <br/>\nor martial... and the other being m@which means a gentleman, <br/>\nnobleman, aristocrat. But, this does not mean that samurai is <br/>\nincorrect. Some experts feel that the terms samurai and bushi have <br/>\ndifferent implications in their meanings. Some consider bushi to mean <br/>\nthose who come from military families and have a hereditary occupation <br/>\nas profesional warriors. The character m@implying somekind of a <br/>\nstatus and such to that occupation. To be fair, there are those who <br/>\nalso use the term bushi to describe anyone that gave military service, <br/>\npart time farmer/warrior or professional warriors. Where was some say <br/>\nthat samurai covers all those groups, but bushi were a subsection of <br/>\nthe overall group of those who gave military service. So often the use <br/>\nof exactly which term for who seems to largely be personal preferance. <br/>\nThis also gets a bit more complicated when one considers that in the <br/>\nmedieval period a large number of even fairly professional warriors <br/>\nwould often participate in some kind of farming themselves even if <br/>\ntheir main occupation was military service.</div>",

They wrote the thoughts , <br/>\nstory about the  succession of Emperor.<br/>\n<br/>\n   They said the origin of Japanese Emperor was AMATERAS OOMIKAMI , <br/>\nthe god of Sun , and the child between the Japanese first gods for <br/>\nwhole things , IZANAGI and  IZANAMI .  The number sixth descendant <br/>\nfrom AMATERAS  OOMIKAMI  was the first Emperor ,  JINMU TENNOU ( <br/>\nEmperor JINMU )  and was followed by descendants all the way.  <br/>\n   Which means Japanese Emperor was believed as God, and Human God <br/>\nby Japanese peoples of BUKE groups, Peerrages, Farmers, every body <br/>\nsince then untill very nowadays.<br/>\n   Of course, the present Japanese , except some people, dont belive <br/>\nEmperor as the God.  <br/>\n   Because of the thought that Emperor is god, other than the <br/>\ndescendants of Emperor family , inherited Emperor blood, cannot <br/>\nsucess the Japanese Emperor.   Even the most powerful Shogun or <br/>\nChief of BUKE  coudn&#39;t success the status of Emperor, because they <br/>\nwere not first position of Emperor family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In this book,  KOJIKI, also they said Japanese Emperor can leave <br/>\nthe power to govern the political affairs of Japanese peoples to <br/>\nanybody else, for example  , SHOGUN.  However, Japanese Emperor <br/>\ncannot leave the power of religious affairs of people, so , Emperor <br/>\nhas been continuing to involve in the power of religious things as <br/>\nthe representative of Japanese god.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Can you believe this thing ?  I think any foreigners cannot <br/>\nbelieve this thing, but it is understandable.  Emperor is the very <br/>\nunique , only Japanese thing in history.<br/>\n    If you believe the story , thoughts in KOJIKI , the book of old <br/>\nstories  compiled  in  the year of 712 AC ,  you can understand the <br/>\nabove.<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Gerard Gillespie <br/>\n&lt;gjgillespie@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Emperor is decended of the sun goddess  and  a priest of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the Shinto order. none if the others would have never been reconized <br/>\nby the other great power China, Korea, because they where of low <br/>\nbirth, also one does not cut one self off from the sun, and the <br/>\nEmperor was the sun so it was to greater prestege to have connection <br/>\nto the royal family then destroy it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  That is why the office of Shogun of the military class was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>created  so that who ever occupied the office . would appear to <br/>\nhave to royal blessing to rule the land in the emperiors name.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; yours respectfully,<br/>\n&gt; Gerard Gillespie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- On Sun, 10/5/08, yoshiyuki hiramoto &lt;eddiehiramoto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: yoshiyuki hiramoto &lt;eddiehiramoto@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai ( Buke in auchaeological <br/>\n </span></blockquote>term )<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Sunday, October 5, 2008, 12:51 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;JL Badgley&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;tatsushu@ .&gt; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That is *way* too much of a summary of events, but I&#39;ll leave it <br/>\n&gt; stand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so someone can nitpick it and further refine it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Josh<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Josh,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You did good job to explain about Samurai, Buke including <br/>\n&gt; Minamoto, Taira, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please let me summarize Buke things following to my previous <br/>\n&gt; explanation.

I want<br/>\nto mention a few things that may have been missed in reading his post.<br/>\n<br/>\n1400 years ago (age of the Kojiki and Nihonshiki), as he mentioned,<br/>\nthere do appear to be warriors who are hired on to protect various<br/>\nlandowners&#39; property.  There were some groups, such as the Mononobe,<br/>\nwho were specifically considered warriors or warrior families, but for<br/>\nthe most part any kind of soldiers appear to have been lower class<br/>\nfolks.  In fact, as you enter the Ritsuryo period, you have soldiers<br/>\ncalled up by conscription from the various communities, rather than a<br/>\nwarrior class, per se.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe word &#39;samurai&#39;, as Eddie mentions, comes from the word &#39;saburafu&#39;,<br/>\n&#39;to serve&#39;.  (Saburafu-&gt;Saburahi-&gt;Samurai; not sure if that is the<br/>\n*exact* path the word took).<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Karl Friday has a good book on this subject, whose title I&#39;m<br/>\nblanking on but if you search on his name you will no doubt find it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to summarize some of what comes next: On the edges of the<br/>\nYamato polity, it appears that administration often had to rely on<br/>\nforce against the local population, and as provincial governors turned<br/>\ntheir attention more towards the courts, local administrators were<br/>\nleft with a freer reign in the outer territories, and having a<br/>\nstanding group of warriors was much more effective than trying to<br/>\nconscript a bunch of peasants whenever you needed to exert military<br/>\nforce.  Much of the power in the East, at least, appears to have been<br/>\nconcentrated in the hands of people who had the horses and bows to<br/>\nexert real power in the region.  This power was legitimized through<br/>\nvarious means, including marriage and alliances with court nobles.<br/>\nEventually, these eastern warriors make their way to the capital,<br/>\nchiefly under the employ of descendants of disinherited Imperial<br/>\nprinces (the Taira and the Minamoto--though there are several groups<br/>\nof Minamoto, descending from different Imperial ancestors).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, the monks of the various temples had also been<br/>\ngathering warriors to &#39;defend&#39; their rights and lands.  Towards the<br/>\nend of the Heian period, the temples are descending into the capital<br/>\nwith warrior-monks and a mikoshi carrying the enshrined spirit of<br/>\ntheir main object of worship.  Most of the Heian capital forces would<br/>\nnot face them, apparently partly in fear of the bad karma (or other<br/>\nill-effects) they could accrue by attacking the mikoshi.  These<br/>\nprovincial warriors appear to have had far fewer scruples regarding<br/>\nsuch things, and were initially seen by the court as a counter to the<br/>\ntemples&#39; power.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say that the real use of military power in the capital was the<br/>\nHogen Disturbance, since it effectively put Taira Kiyomori in a<br/>\nposition of both political and military power.  After Kiyomori&#39;s death<br/>\nin the late 12th century, the descendants of his defeated Minamoto foe<br/>\nled a military revolt that caused a civil war.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Question for the room:  I believe this is the first time that the<br/>\nvarious military forces competed without being directly led by an<br/>\nEmperor or Imperial decree--they may have each claimed Imperial<br/>\nMandate, but every other similar power-struggle conflict I can think<br/>\nof seems to be much more directly influenced by the Emperor and his<br/>\nCourt rather than by the military power structures.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, although it is known as the Genpei (or Gempei) War (meaning<br/>\nMinamoto and Taira), it was much more complex.  For instance, Minamoto<br/>\nno Yoritomo was backed by his Hojo supporters--a branch of the Taira<br/>\nfamily that had been given wardship over Yoritomo specifically to<br/>\nprevent something of this nature.  Even in the Hogen Disturbance you<br/>\nsee fathers and sons on separate sides of the disturbance.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty much from this point on, the &#39;samurai&#39; houses, or buke<br/>\n(&#39;warrior families&#39;), are in a position of actual political power<br/>\nthroughout the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is *way* too much of a summary of events, but I&#39;ll leave it stand<br/>\nso someone can nitpick it and further refine it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Josh</div>",

In the rearly <br/>\norigin ,some poor  farmaers armed strongly  were hired as the gard <br/>\nmen , or small family of peerage as well.  So, no body knows who was <br/>\nthe first Samurai , the name of person of first Samurai.<br/>\n    In fact, Samurai were , originally ,  the lowest  rank of social <br/>\nstratum ( higher than slaves ) .  Isn&#39;t it interesting  for you ?<br/>\n   In Japan, before the birth of Samurai, Emperor , Peerage, Farmers, <br/>\nMerchant, Producers were the main stratum . <br/>\n<br/>\n    And then, gradually, Buke became more people  and stronger and <br/>\nstronger and had power to control Farmers, Merchant, Producers.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So,  Samurai means Buke , to protect or gard somebody others.<br/>\n<br/>\n      The historical story about Samurai is over for today.  TO BE <br/>\nCONTINUED.  (   After the above history, another interesting thing you <br/>\ncan know ).<br/>\n    Looking forward to hearing your comment on the above.<br/>\n<br/>\n  (  At present,  of cause, no more  Samurai exists.  Please see &quot; Last <br/>\nSamurai &quot;  ,  the famous movie.  How to terminate, I&#39;ll let you know <br/>\nlater.)<br/>\n<br/>\n   Eddie  Hiramoto</div>",

I joined this history group for my love of history, and I believe in the ways of the old. So I can personally answer your question: yes, the ways are still followed, and although there are those that say that the ways of the samurai are obsolete, or don&#39;t function in these times, they will not likely die out as long as people still believe in them. In fact, the spirit of old Japan seems to be coming back in popularity (even after the nightmares of world war 2 and the communist and socialist movement in Japan).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 9/24/08, james mathies &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unhappiclown04@...\">unhappiclown04@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: james mathies &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unhappiclown04@...\">unhappiclown04@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] (unknown)<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Wednesday, September 24, 2008, 3:11 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you letting me join the group.My question who started the samurai?What does the name samurai mean and do they practice it today<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",

The answers for this could just get very long. If you have more specific questions after that, Im sure more people would be willing to help. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn short though, the word &quot;samurai&quot; is derived from the verb meaning &quot;to serve.&quot; Serving is a critical concept to the idea of the samurai and tells one something about the role of the samurai/their function in society. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it practiced today? The question is a difficult one because as a way of life, I&#39;m sure some people in the modern world (ex. Yukio Mishima) would think it is, but the bushi as a class of people ended long ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck in your pursuits,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\njames mathies &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unhappiclown04@...\">unhappiclown04@...</a>&gt; wrote:                             Thank you letting me join the group.My question who started the samurai?What does the name samurai mean and do they practice it today<br/>\n <br/>\n [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n     <br/>\n                                       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan P.
