            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1064863100\">Hi Everyone!<br/>\nI am new to the group and very interested in Japanese Armor.  I live in<br/>\nDallas, Texas and work for The Crow Collection of Asian Art.  We are having<br/>\nan Armor exhibition opening on March 21st.<br/>\nI work in the Education Department for the museum.  As a result I am helping<br/>\nto develop a lesson plan for teachers and students and also putting together<br/>\nbackground information for the tour guides.  I do have some information, but<br/>\nam very interested in learning more.  One of the perks of my job is getting<br/>\nto see some of the exhibits before they go on display.  I am blown away by<br/>\nthe armor and masks. This stuff is sooo amazing and cool.  I can&#39;t wait to<br/>\nsee the public&#39;s reaction.  The reason I am writing this is to hopefully get<br/>\ninformation from those with more knowledge on this subject matter.  In<br/>\naddition to the Samurai Archives on the web, I was wondering if anyone might<br/>\nhave suggestions for more information (i.e. websites, books, movies, etc).<br/>\nI am also looking for pertinent information that might be especially<br/>\ninteresting to children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!  I look forward to being a part of this group!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm regards,<br/>\nZehra Ahmad<br/>\nOutreach Coordinator<br/>\nThe Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection Of Asian Art</div>",
