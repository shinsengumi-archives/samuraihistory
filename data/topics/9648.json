            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-135961656\">Shannon,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Here are some brief answers to your questions.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -There were indeed emperors (but held no political power) during the reign of the Kamakura, Muromachi and Edo period Shogunates.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -Daimyo were feudal lords who became the undisputed rulers of territory after central authority began to breakdown in the mid-1400s. The  rise of daimyo is associated with the &quot;Sengoku&quot; civil war period. Daimyo were samurai and did indeed fight, at least until there was a lasting peace that started in 1615.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -Weapons used were primarily the bow and arrow, the spear, and the naginata-- which was a curved sword blade mounted on a spear pole. Swords were used as a weapon of last resort on the battlefield. The use of guns spread very rapidly in Japan during the mid 1550s and rapidly changed the way battles were fought as they revolutionized warfare.Training began at a young age for samurai.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -Confucian influence on samurai culture was not particularly strong until the Edo period- which was from 1600 to 1868. During this time period, the Tokugawa shogunate encouraged the samurai class to study Confucianism.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  These are very shallow answers to your questions. I suggest that you see if your school or public libraries have any books by Stephen Turnbull on samurai history. His books will help you.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Good luck!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  shannon fenella &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shannon_fenella@...\">shannon_fenella@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          hello,<br/>\nfor a project on school I am making a survey about the samurai.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-942938338\">As Dave mentioned, it is a subject that can&#39;t simply be covered with a few brief answers. There are books and books of information on each of these topics. However, you at least have a starting point. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Confucius... I think the most significant element of interest to you would be the influence of Neo-Confucianism on the development of &quot;bushido-like&quot; codes of behavior during the Edo period. The combination of Shinto, Buddhism, and Neo-Confucianism led to a combination of beliefs and attitudes that were unique to the samurai class during that time period. Loyalty and gi are two concepts that are deeply rooted in Confucian thought, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps you somewhat. Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan P.
