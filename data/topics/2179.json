He integrated fires<br/>\n&gt;and obstacles as well as any modern commander would. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Read  &quot;The Dawn of  Modern Warfare&quot;, it&#39;s part of the West Point <br/>\nMilitary History series. Sorry he wasn&#39;t the first use a combination of <br/>\nterrain and guns. Read about Gonzola and his conduct of the battle of <br/>\nCerignola in 1503. These tactics were used by the Spanish and gave rise <br/>\nto their ascendency in Europe. I suspect if there was a real innovation, <br/>\nit was in his formations and their speed and possibly training. The <br/>\nSpanish Tercio was a slow clunky thing to manuveur and fight. Any of the <br/>\nthree, Oda et. al would have been a top general anywhere in period I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:the_sam_99@...\">the_sam_99@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the commentaries to the 7 Samurai DVD it is <br/>\n&gt;said that 2 minutes were needed, but I would like to confirm that, if <br/>\n&gt;possible.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That fits with the figures I&#39;ve read and my friends with period firearms <br/>\ncan&#39;t really load much faster than that and they have the concept of <br/>\ndrill down cold. Not something usual for the 1600&#39;s soldier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Masamori Masami&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oni_shogun@...\">oni_shogun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: The Last Samurai?
