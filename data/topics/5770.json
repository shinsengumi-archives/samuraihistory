            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-823904415\">To the Buke,<br/>\n  After a certain amount of discussion with Takeda<br/>\nKatsuchiyo, I&#39;ve finished the writting of the paper on<br/>\nJapanese warfare during Sengoku Jidai.  There was a<br/>\ngood deal learned on my part during the research of<br/>\nthe subject, enough to the point that I didn&#39;t include<br/>\nnearly all of it for fear of making the paper too long<br/>\nand droning.  However, this good deal learned are<br/>\nthings that Katsuchiyo-sama and myself are confident<br/>\nthat we can apply to our mok combat, and thereby<br/>\npresent a more accurate and realistic account of how<br/>\nthe Japanese actually fought in battle.  I hope that<br/>\nanyone who chooses to read finds it at least somewhat<br/>\neducating on a subject that I had a good deal of<br/>\ndifficulty researching myself: Very few documents I&#39;ve<br/>\never seen even begin to approach how battle formations<br/>\nwere structured and what their purpose was.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I expect there to be mistakes.  The paper<br/>\nwas thrown together in haste, and numerouse accounts<br/>\nof the same battles were referenced before deciding<br/>\nwhich ones seemed the most realiable.  Anyone who&#39;d<br/>\nlike to point anything out to me should feel free to<br/>\ndo so in the next couple of days before I leave for<br/>\nthe military.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on a final note, please forgive the lack of<br/>\nreferences.  I plan on adding them before I leave so<br/>\nthat the paper might be able to be displayed without<br/>\nany worries of plagarism charges, but for now I<br/>\nthought I&#39;d just represent it to the Society.  Enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n_______________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vote.yahoo.com\">http://vote.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

What, exactly, are you looking for? The history of <br/>\nhoujutsu? A place to learn and practice? Historical episodes where <br/>\nguns were used? Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Japanese is acceptable to you, there is plenty of <br/>\ninformation on the web. Have you looked at google or other <br/>\nsearch engines? It looks like there is some information to be found in <br/>\nEnglish if you search &#39;hojutsu&#39; (which is a technically incorrect and <br/>\npossibly misleading transliteration) - but a few of the sites that I <br/>\nglanced at appear to be a bit flakey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
