            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1509194772\">mattyboi,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Generally speaking a kodachi is shorter than a katana (daito/dachi) and <br/>\nlonger than a wakizashi (shoto).  The name kodachi literally means &quot;short <br/>\nlongsword.&quot;  Or at least something similar to that.  It is still classified <br/>\nas a long sword, and often weilded as such since it is possible to use both <br/>\nhands on the tsuka (handle) whereas the wakizashi can only be used with one <br/>\nhand due to the short tsuka.<br/>\n  The advantage to a kodachi over a daito is that it is slightly faster to <br/>\nmove with, however it is shorter which means you have to get that much <br/>\ncloser to be effective with it.  All depends on what you want focus on, <br/>\nspeed or range.<br/>\n  On a side note, the odachi that I mentioned before literally translates to <br/>\ngreat longsword.  Just something else to add to the &quot;prefix + dachi&quot; thing.<br/>\n  My appologies if my translations are off, I am still in the process of <br/>\nteaching myself.  I will be taking more formal nihonga classes this fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 9 Dial-up Internet Access helps fight spam and pop-ups ï¿½ now 2 months <br/>\nFREE! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/\">http://join.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/</a></div>",
