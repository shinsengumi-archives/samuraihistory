The Shogun himself is a daimyo, and he sits <br/>\nat the apex of power.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe layers beneath can be very complex. Tokugawa Ieyasu, for example, when he <br/>\nset up his shogunate, put those he wanted to keep on his side in positions of great <br/>\nwealth, whilst those he could tust, his allies from the beginning, had relatively frugal <br/>\nrewards, but were placed in positions of great strategic importance should trouble <br/>\nflare up. I would also suggest they received rewards &#39;in kind&#39; that made any sacrifice <br/>\nworthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for middlemen - the Tokugawa house had daimyate houses who were allies from <br/>\nthe very first - Ishikawa, Sakai, Sakakibara and notably the Honda. The latter family, <br/>\nuntil they fell from grace, possessed considerable authority as middlemen between <br/>\nIeyasu and the rest, and if you fell out of favour with a middleman you might count <br/>\nyour days as numbered.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way - the shogun is the daimyo at the top, the daimyo at the bottom <br/>\nprobably doesn&#39;t even get a mention in the history books, and EVERY other daimyo is <br/>\nsomewhere &#39;in the middle&#39; between these two and working hard to preserve if not <br/>\nadvance his position along an often very greasy pole, whilst his every neighbour <br/>\nseeks and hopes for his dislodgement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you Wanadoo:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/\">http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis email has been checked for most known viruses - find out more at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm\">http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm</a></div>",
