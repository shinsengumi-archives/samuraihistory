            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-367387186\">I&#39;ve just bought a copy of the latest Military Illustrated magazine (March<br/>\n2004), mainly because it contained an article by Turnbull on the use of<br/>\ncannon in 16th century Japan. Great I thought! However a few paragraphs into<br/>\nthe article it all seemed a bit familiar and I got the distinct impression<br/>\nthat I&#39;d read it all before. On checking, I found that it is taken,<br/>\nvirtually word for word or paragraph for paragraph from Turnbull&#39;s new book<br/>\n&#39;Samurai: The World of the Warrior&#39;. Even the photographs are virtually<br/>\nidentical (just different angles) to those reproduced in the book! Turnbull<br/>\nhas changed a few words here and there or added a few new sentences, but the<br/>\narticle really adds nothing at all to the chapter in the Osprey book. So<br/>\nunless you want the magazine for the other non-Japanese articles, save your<br/>\nmoney (3.40 or $5.95) and spend it wisely elsewhere!<br/>\nThis is not the first time that a whole chapter of Turnbull&#39;s work has been<br/>\nrepublished in a magazine and at least the second time that Military<br/>\nIllustrated has done this - so it&#39;s definitely a case of &#39;buyer beware&#39; when<br/>\npurchasing!<br/>\nMichael</div>",
