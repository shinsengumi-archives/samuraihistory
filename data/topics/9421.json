Some sources say guns came to Japan earlier and <br/>\nsome say later like 1700&#39;s at a great battle or siege. What is agreed <br/>\non however is the banning and discouragement of using firearms for a <br/>\ngood two centuries thereafter. Did they use guns in 1615 at the uniting <br/>\nof the clans battle, I wonder? I sometimes wonder if on InuYasha what <br/>\nwould have happened to her world of the 20th/21st Centuries if Kagome <br/>\nhad brought modern day weapons like state of the arts firearms to the <br/>\nWarring States Era when she visited IY and friends? Maybe the youkai <br/>\nand hanyou would be running the world today and judging from <br/>\nappearances, could they have done as badly as our modern leaders have? <br/>\nI think not. Why? They are not politically motivated and care not a <br/>\nwhit about ruling (Naraku excluded) the world. More soon. Have a nice <br/>\nweekend and Kami bless you all. Ja Mata and Toodles-K&K</div>",
