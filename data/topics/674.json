            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2038005638\">A remastered &#39;Rashomon&#39; is finally coming out on DVD - with a running <br/>\ncommentary track by the guy who did the comentary for the 7 Samurai (I <br/>\n assume) - the commentary for 7 samurai was the best I&#39;ve seen aside <br/>\nfrom &#39;Das Boot&#39;.  It is part of the &#39;criterion collection&#39;, and they <br/>\ndid such a good job with 7 samurai, I already have my order in for <br/>\nRashomon. (as opposed to the DVD &#39;Ran&#39;, which was an utter <br/>\nabomination)  Rashomon will be released on 3-26 - you can check it out <br/>\nat dvdplanet.com.  You&#39;ll have to do a search to find it - it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nput the location of the page in my browser&#39;s address bar to post here.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like it will have Japanese/subtitled or a dubb track. Never seen <br/>\nit dubbed.  I assume it will be horrible, but interesting to watch at <br/>\nleast once.</div>",
