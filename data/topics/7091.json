            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-530936244\">That is the joys of the internet, people will always insult people as long as they believe thay can get away with it. This group can be a very productive and above all interlectual experience. Unfortunatly if like me you make the odd grammatical error you can also be corrected, which can be a little insulting. In all this is a productive group to be a part of and although I havent posted in a while I always enjoy reading the regulars opinions. I myself moderate on a huge gamingg forum and it can be a little frustrating, but all in all this is a cool group as long as we all stay on subject.....<br/>\n<br/>\nNate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:umaryu@...\">umaryu@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the one thing I hate about mail list and forums is<br/>\n&gt; because people are sat at keypoards and not<br/>\n&gt; discussing<br/>\n&gt; face to face, then there is a tenancy to be very<br/>\n&gt; insulting and offensive.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even moderators can get rude at times, some time a I<br/>\n&gt; think taking their position as an excuse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And the one thing this moderator hates is people who<br/>\nhide in the herd. Especially when I&#39;ve asked, offline,<br/>\nfor you to list any insults I&#39;ve directed at you, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried, repeatedly, to clarify anything you were<br/>\nmisreading. And now, I get publicly threatened on the<br/>\nlist. See below: <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who once insult me on the web<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; then<br/>\n&gt; got a shock some time later when I introduced my<br/>\n&gt; self.<br/>\n&gt; The shock was because they thought they were very<br/>\n&gt; safe<br/>\n&gt; insulting me 3000 miles away from where I live from<br/>\n&gt; them. They were not keen at all to insult me then.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*snip* <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just think we should all be aware that we may one<br/>\n&gt; day meet and it may not be too friendly due to our<br/>\n&gt; behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is very junior high school. I&#39;d think a 36 year<br/>\nold would be above that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n            <br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo! Mail Mobile <br/>\nTake Yahoo!
