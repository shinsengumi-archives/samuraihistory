            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1236372699\">Daring to risk my rep as the Class Leprechaun here,  I have done some game <br/>\ntheory on the Scots Highlanders and their  claymores and  the Samurai with their <br/>\nkatanas.   I am very proud of my Scots heritage,  if for nothing than the <br/>\nDeclaration of Arbroath, the world&#39;s first declaration of Independence.  In part <br/>\nit reads: &quot;we  fight for freedom,  which no good man surrenders but with his <br/>\nlife.&quot;  (After 300 years of fighting for Freedom, you would think my family <br/>\nwould have had enough!)   Anyhow,  the main weakness of the katana is that,  with <br/>\na two-handed haft (hold),  the samurai was perilously exposed under his arm <br/>\npits for a thrust.  This was a defect in Japanese armor never fully remedied, <br/>\nwhile European knights had chain mail to cover that area by 1000 AD.  The <br/>\nclaymore broadsword,  however,  was used with one hand,  the other side protected <br/>\nby a  target (the original of the name, and hence the round  &#39;&#39;&#39;target&#39;&#39;&#39; for <br/>\nshooters later), or shield.   Shields,  at least to my knowledge,  never <br/>\nappeared in samurai warfighting.  In the early battles of the Rising of 1745, the <br/>\nHighlanders of Bonnie Prince Charlie terrified the British  &quot;&quot;sojers&#39;&#39;&#39; with <br/>\ntheir claymores, amputating heads and limbs at will--as did katanas.  Having <br/>\nboth,  the claymore is a much heavier weapon with a wide straight blade,  always <br/>\nat least 36 inches long.   The width is never less than one inch. The hand <br/>\nguard is solid brass--the origin of the  &#39;&#39;brass knuckle.&quot;   It was not until <br/>\nCulloden in April 1746,  the final battle, that British soldiers, trained by  &quot;The <br/>\nButcher,&quot;  the Duke of Cumberland,  learned to best the Highlanders.  The  <br/>\nredcoat would lunge with his bayonet--if memory serves--at the kiltie laddie to <br/>\nhis left, getting him in the exposed right side and arm pit as he raised his <br/>\nsword at the soldier on the soldier&#39;s left.  A chara dhil,  Jack M.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
