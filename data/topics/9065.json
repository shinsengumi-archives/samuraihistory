Also check your local Aikido dojo as these tend  <br/>\nto attract Budo Bums of all stripes and you may encounter someone  <br/>\ndoing Iai. Not really schools of &quot;Bushido&quot; but a good way to touch  <br/>\nbase with the culture while you learn more of your subject. Study  <br/>\nhard and if you are truly serious there are schools of Koryu Kenjutsu  <br/>\nhere and there for a more authentic experience, but no small  <br/>\ncommittment...<br/>\n-t<br/>\nwww.ncjsc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

I know enough Nihongo to help you speak it and if I can I know someone who can. And the sword issue we got you covered there too. I have seen the corrections that the scholars give in this site and I feel that if you need to know something just ask and some one will get the correct answer to you as soon as possible. However, for any of those things I mentioned earlier just contact me off of the group and I would be way more than happy to help you.
