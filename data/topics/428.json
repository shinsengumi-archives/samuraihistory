All his <br/>\ntechniques are made up and he cannot produce the evidence or even a name of <br/>\nwho taught him, very strange. Maybe a case for the X files. Please help me <br/>\nfind true Sanada Ryu...<br/>\n<br/>\nArigato,<br/>\n<br/>\nki-shin<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>",
