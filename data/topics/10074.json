I&#39;ve tried to maintain a certain historical  <br/>\nverisimilitude, but that said, I&#39;ve also taken liberties where it benefitted the  <br/>\nstory.  In essence I&#39;ve tried to do what has largely been done with the  <br/>\nArthurian legends, combining different myths and elements from various periods  <br/>\nin history to create my own world of high adventure.  If nothing  else, I <br/>\nhope some of you may enjoy the spirit of it.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd allow me to pretend than any substantial inaccuracies are really just  <br/>\nintentional literary liberties. (Some of them probably are.)<br/>\n <br/>\nShould you be interested, just visit HFQ&#39;s table-of-contents here:  <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heroicfantasyquarterly.com/_\">http://www.heroicfantasyquarterly.com/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heroicfantasyquarterly.com/)\">http://www.heroicfantasyquarterly.com/)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nHappy 2010, all!<br/>\n <br/>\n--R.
