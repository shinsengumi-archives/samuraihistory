An amazing film about<br/>\nMusashi&#39;s life after his contest with Kojiro. Yorozuya as Musashi is superb<br/>\nand later I heard that he was a master of kenjutsu (6th dan).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor long time now, I&#39;m trying hard to find more infos about Yorozuya.<br/>\nHowever, it is impossible so far. It is said that Japanese &#39;hide&#39; many<br/>\nevidence because they want to keep them only for... them. I dunno if this is<br/>\ntrue. But I know that there are for sure many files which have been left<br/>\nwithout english translation...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, if you know more about Yorozuya, feel free to let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your interest on Musashi&#39;s site.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon, I&#39;ll publish a book on Musashi based on this site.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nAmphipolis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 4 Sep 2001 00:54:44 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;ANDREI C.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cif_arh@...\">cif_arh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Thanks...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     There are no words for me to express my gratitude<br/>\n&gt; for whoever sent this mail whith the &#39;Musashi site&#39;<br/>\n&gt; link.If anyone has some more information on the man I<br/>\n&gt; sure hope won&#39;t keep it only for him/herself...Thanks again...A.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>.yahoo.com/info/terms/</div>",
