They basically had thier panel of <br/>\npretty boys and girls answer multiple choice questions about ninja.   <br/>\nApparently, the &quot;flying ninja&quot; trick with the square shaped cloak <br/>\ncould work in theory, but my question is, if so, why did it take 1000 <br/>\nyears and the wright brothers to prove it?  Also, they talked about <br/>\nhow ninja can jump 2.4 meters straight up, and can long jump two <br/>\nparked volvos.  So of course they said &quot;ooh, if we had ninja in the <br/>\nolympics this time, we would win every event!&quot; The only useful bit of <br/>\ninfo I got from it is that ninja dont wear thier swords over thier <br/>\nshoulder because it is too hard to draw - except when they are <br/>\ncrawling under a house.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Nate Ledbetter <br/>\n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- &quot;Anthony J.
