(Mine was once the <br/>\nproperty of the Imperial Naval Academy Library, but that was in another world).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book details all the armour bits excavated from kofun up to 1944, when the <br/>\nbook was published. Moreover, the book is full of photos of the full-sized <br/>\nreproductions of the armour made by Suenaga.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the print run, as I understand it, was bombed out of existence, so this <br/>\nis a goldmine to find one here. If you&#39;re interested in pre-800 armour, you MUST <br/>\nhave this book.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is E-bay auction item 3909701273. Check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",

His great grand-father, Hiroki Masazumi immigrated to Canada, to apparently, avoid a marriage to a woman whom he did not love.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe settled in north-western NorthWest Territories (very very large territory) and started a family there, in the town of Fort Good Hope.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was not aware of my Japanese ancestry, but it made a-lot of sense to me as I&#39;ve always carried a strong interest in the Japanese culture, more specifically, the Samurai.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was hoping I can be directed to a source that could possibly shed some light on the Masazumi family name. I&#39;ve tried web searching at a couple search engines, but didn&#39;t find anything I don&#39;t already know, which isn&#39;t much.<br/>\n <br/>\nAny and all help will be appreciated.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards.....Ramal<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nPost your free ad now!
