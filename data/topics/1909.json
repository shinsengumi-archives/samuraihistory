This<br/>\nfifty episode?miniseries followed the life of the Hojo Shikken Tokimune plus<br/>\ngave considerable time showing the Mongol side as well. The battle scenes<br/>\nnear the end were quite good. I could tape the entire series from TV. I know<br/>\nthat a condensed version (about four hours) is available on tape and DVD<br/>\nhere in Japan. What might be available in your area I don&#39;t know. Other<br/>\nposters to this forum have said some of these Taiga Drama&#39;s are available in<br/>\nsome areas of the states.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother film about this subject is called &#39;The Divine Wind Blows&#39; (Japanese<br/>\ntitle &#39;Kakute Shinpu wo Fuku&#39;) made in 1944. Its mostly propaganda, made<br/>\nnear the end of World war II. The copy I saw was pretty well worn. The sound<br/>\nand picture were of poor quality. I have not seen this on video or DVD. The<br/>\ncopy I have was shown on TV some time ago. Better to see the NHK version.</div>",
