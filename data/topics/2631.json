            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-670088816\">Hi Gustav<br/>\n<br/>\nI stand to be corrected of course... but although the design appears to be a &quot;MON&quot; (Family Crest), of three crescent shaped birds intertwined at 120degrees, I feel that it is a modern creation and not &quot;traditional&quot;.  It is a lot easier to say what it is not rather than what it is.... There are a few native birds represented in various mon - Crane, Sparrow, Wild Goose, Crow, Mandarin Duck, Dove, Hawk and the domestic Chicken (I suppose we should also add the Pheonix!) - non of these are similar to the ones represented in the &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; crest. The best description of which I would say Swan or Goose.  Having said all this I know I have in my collection a crest design of a bird in flight similar in nature to the birds in your crest... I believe it came from a modern japanese design book but cannot as yet remember!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes with the investigations...        <br/>\n<br/>\n                                            Rod Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: megatjockis <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2003 12:38 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Hagakure crest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was hoping someone might be able to help me.
