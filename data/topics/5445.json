He was solitary and obsessive, incapable <br/>\nof fitting in to society.  &quot;Normal&quot; assassins tend to be sociopaths <br/>\nwho can function in society - watch any Mafia movie. Ghost Dog was <br/>\ndelusional - he structured his reality around the notion <br/>\nof &quot;Bushido&quot;, not as a philosophy of life like any normal person, but <br/>\nas an obsession. He was not even close to &quot;normal&quot;.  I liked the <br/>\nmovie as far as movies go, it just seemed to me that he was playing <br/>\nthe part of an insane character.</div>",
