This means my own swords are useless.&quot; So <br/>\n&gt;  saying, he tied up his swords and dropped them out of the <br/>\n&gt;  gatehouse.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  After 10 or so days, he was convinced of their innocence. They <br/>\n&gt;  werew deemed unfit for service, however, and dismissed.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  When the time came for them to leave, they approached <br/>\n&gt;  Masanori:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &quot;How unspeakably worthless did out master find us, that he <br/>\n&gt;  should put us in the hands of one man? We must mnake him <br/>\n&gt;  realise our worth, we thought, but if we killed you when you <br/>\n&gt;  weren&#39;t even carrying your swords, he would conclude we were <br/>\n&gt;  worthless after all, and that pained us. So we decided, if we were <br/>\n&gt;  put to death, that weould be that.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &quot;As it turned out, because of your compassion we were not <br/>\n&gt;  deprived of our swords, and now we can mingle among samurai <br/>\n&gt;  once again.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I think the point here is that the self-view of the samurai was <br/>\n&gt;  perceived according to his social status, nothing to do with any <br/>\n&gt;  notion of the &#39;sword as his soul&#39;, rather more to do with the fact of <br/>\n&gt;  how the world will view a man who lets his property be taken <br/>\n&gt;  from him - it&#39;s a matter of pride, not virtue.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Somewhere else I read of a samurai who commented, quite <br/>\n&gt;  innocently, about the sharpness of his sword. Another rounded <br/>\n&gt;  on him angrily. &quot;How dare you! Are you suggesting that my sword <br/>\n&gt;  is not sharp?&quot; This kind of comment could easily lead to <br/>\n&gt;  bloodshed, for the most stupid reasons - too much testosterone <br/>\n&gt;  pumping all the time!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Saya-ate - scabbard clashing - was an insult  beyond all <br/>\n&gt;  apology. The only accceptable response was a drawn sword. <br/>\n&gt;  Why? Because it&#39;s akin to bumping into someone, which means <br/>\n&gt;  you didn&#39;t even notice them.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  The &#39;yahoo&#39; boys (especially in Edo and later) would wear their <br/>\n&gt;  swords in scarlet scabbards that stuck out almost horizontally to <br/>\n&gt;  the side, and then try and clash with someone. The wise heads, <br/>\n&gt;  who wore their swords facing as near as possible forward, so <br/>\n&gt;  the scabbard sticks out behind, could grasp the guard, and in a <br/>\n&gt;  twisting motion lift it to the shoulder, so the sword runs parallel <br/>\n&gt;  to, and very close to, the body, thus avoiding the contact.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds about right for the Edo period when there were more than a few samurai <br/>\nwho had nothing to do other than start fights over their status symbols i.e. <br/>\ntheir swords. Such as when one scabbard rubbed against another. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose who don&#39;t learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  In many places, <br/>\nespecially in gangster culture (at least here in the U.S. but I&#39;m sure that <br/>\nit&#39;s like this all over the world), when one of the home-boys &quot;gets in your <br/>\nface&quot; i.e. touches another home-boy, this is cause for a challenge. Only in the <br/>\ncurrent day, guns rather than swords are frequently drawn. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an old Zen sword story I read, about Tsukahara Bokkuden, the master <br/>\nswordsman of around the 16th century (I believe; please correct me if I have <br/>\nthis time wrong).  There are various versions, but this is the one I&#39;m familiar <br/>\nwith. It seems that some blustering swordsman challenged Bokkuden to a duel. <br/>\nThey happened to be on the bank of a wide river and a boat was tied up nearby. <br/>\nBokkuden announced that he had a technique, it&#39;s called &quot;the School of No <br/>\nSword&quot; The other swordsman was astounded and didn&#39;t believe that such a technique <br/>\nwould work. But Bokkuden put his swords down on the nearby boat that was tied <br/>\nup.  He faced his opponent without his swords. His opponent charged him, <br/>\nwhereupon Bokkuden jumped into the boat and rowed away, leaving his opponent <br/>\nstewing upon the shore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNina</div>",
