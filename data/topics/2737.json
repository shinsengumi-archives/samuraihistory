            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-322733558\">December 6, 2003<br/>\n By CHRISTOPHER BENFEY <br/>\n<br/>\nAMHERST, Mass. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis year marks the 150th anniversary of Commodore Matthew<br/>\nPerry&#39;s fabled &quot;opening&quot; of Japan. If you said, &quot;Commodore<br/>\nwho?&quot; you wouldn&#39;t be alone. Commodore Perry - Matthew<br/>\nCalbraith Perry, to be exact - has faded from American<br/>\nmemory, even though every Japanese school child knows his<br/>\nname. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1853, Perry brought a fleet of four heavily armed &quot;Black<br/>\nShips&quot; into Edo Bay, near present-day Tokyo, and demanded,<br/>\nin the name of President Millard Fillmore, that Japan open<br/>\nits ports to American ships. Japan, which had been closed<br/>\nto foreigners for more than two centuries, complied, and<br/>\nPerry steamed home expecting a hero&#39;s welcome. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was disappointed, for Washington had more pressing<br/>\nconcerns than a tiny archipelago across the Pacific:<br/>\nnamely, the extension of slavery into the West and the<br/>\nthreatening noises about secession from Southern senators.<br/>\nPerry decided he needed public relations help. He asked<br/>\nNathaniel Hawthorne, then United States consul in<br/>\nLiverpool, England, if he might consider writing a book<br/>\nabout the opening of Japan, with Perry as hero. <br/>\n<br/>\nHawthorne was tempted. As he wrote in his journal on Dec.<br/>\n28, 1854, &quot;It would be a very desirable labor for a young<br/>\nliterary man, or for that matter, an old one; for the world<br/>\ncan scarcely have in reserve a less hackneyed theme than<br/>\nJapan.&quot; But Hawthorne had other books on his mind, and<br/>\nsuggested that Perry approach Herman Melville, who knew<br/>\nsomething about the Pacific. Perry, stupidly, decided to<br/>\nwrite the book himself, a wooden performance that did<br/>\nnothing to enhance his reputation. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, Perry&#39;s image still needs burnishing in his own<br/>\ncountry. He has what you might call a Columbus problem: he<br/>\nis seen as more an invader than an explorer. This is<br/>\nunfair. Perry came in search of treaties, not territory.<br/>\nHowever imperious his manner, his aims - at least with<br/>\nregard to Japan - were not imperialist. Backed by his guns,<br/>\nhe opened Japanese ports to foreign goods and ideas; but he<br/>\nalso opened the way for Western understanding of Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s worth remembering that the United States did not<br/>\noccupy Japan. Instead, Japan took one look at Perry&#39;s<br/>\nsteamships and cannons and decided to modernize the country<br/>\n- and quick. In the span of 50 years, Japan turned itself<br/>\ninto an industrial power, learning watch-making from the<br/>\nSwiss and war-making from the Prussians, and won a place<br/>\namong the world powers in the ghastly battles of the<br/>\nRusso-Japanese War. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet some Japanese questioned whether this was progress. In<br/>\n&quot;The Book of Tea,&quot; published in 1906, Kakuzo Okakura<br/>\nobserved that the average Westerner was accustomed &quot;to<br/>\nregard Japan as barbarous while she indulged in the gentle<br/>\narts of peace: he calls her civilized since she began to<br/>\ncommit wholesale slaughter on Manchurian battlefields.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is, though, that Perry didn&#39;t really open Japan.<br/>\nHe did the easy part: showing off American firepower to the<br/>\ngaping samurai on shore, and forcing a trade agreement on<br/>\nthe emperor. But there was a second, slower, more<br/>\nsignificant opening, which required actual understanding -<br/>\nof Buddhism, for example, and the traditional arts of judo<br/>\nand the tea ceremony. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis cultural opening was the result of patient effort by<br/>\ndedicated men and women who saw more in Japan than good<br/>\nharbors and coal for whaling ships. They were people like<br/>\nEdward Sylvester Morse, who traveled to Japan in 1877 to<br/>\nteach Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution to the Japanese and<br/>\nended up as the world&#39;s authority on Japanese ceramics, or<br/>\nhis younger contemporary, Ernest Fenollosa, who taught<br/>\nEmerson and Hegel at Tokyo Imperial University before<br/>\nfalling in love with Buddhist painting and sculpture. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of opening is as much an internal process as an<br/>\nexternal one. People talk about the Japanese influence on<br/>\nAmerica; you might call this the &quot;particle theory&quot; of<br/>\ncultural exchange. But what we see in the 150 years of<br/>\nJapanese-American interaction is something more complicated<br/>\nand harder to name. Maybe we need a &quot;wave theory&quot; of<br/>\ncultural exchange, to explain the constant oscillation<br/>\nbetween East and West. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat oscillation continues today, in movies like &quot;Lost in<br/>\nTranslation&quot; and &quot;The Last Samurai.&quot; Both movies take as<br/>\ntheir heroes broken-down Americans, hired by the Japanese,<br/>\nwho find unexpected regeneration in opening themselves to<br/>\nJapan. In &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; Nathan Algren, the<br/>\nhollowed-out Civil War veteran played by Tom Cruise, comes<br/>\nto Japan to modernize its army. He is typical of those<br/>\noscillating 19th-century Americans who found that Old Japan<br/>\nhad more to teach them than they could offer in return.<br/>\nLike his samurai sword, inscribed &quot;I belong to the warrior<br/>\nin whom the old ways have joined the new,&quot; Algren forges<br/>\nhimself into an alloy of East and West. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot long ago we learned that Bob Dylan, in his album &quot;Love<br/>\nand Theft,&quot; had taken some lines from a Japanese book<br/>\ncalled &quot;Confessions of a Yakuza,&quot; by Junichi Saga. These<br/>\nsimilarities gave rise to some understandable hand-wringing<br/>\nabout plagiarism and cultural appropriation. But Bob Dylan<br/>\nis just another example of the great wave of<br/>\nJapanese-American cultural oscillation. This is Bob Dylan,<br/>\nfor crying out loud, the guy who was born Robert Zimmerman<br/>\nin Minnesota, adopted as his last name the first name of a<br/>\nWelsh poet, and modeled himself on Woody Guthrie. <br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be that his saga, not to mention the flurry of<br/>\nmovies about Japan and self-discovery, are signs that<br/>\nfinally, 150 years after Perry cracked open the door to<br/>\nJapan and sailed away, the real opening has taken place? <br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher Benfey, professor of English at Mount Holyoke<br/>\nCollege, is author of &quot;The Great Wave: Gilded Age Misfits,<br/>\nJapanese Eccentrics, and the Opening of Old Japan.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/06/opinion/06BENF.html?\">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/06/opinion/06BENF.html?</a><br/>\nex=1071900730&ei=1&en=a895a8360bcdda0e</div>",
