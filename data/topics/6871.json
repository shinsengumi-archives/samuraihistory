Hirate had been<br/>\nlike a surrogate father to Nobunaga while Nobunaga was<br/>\ngrowing up, being in charge of his education, and<br/>\nwhile you could interpret it as an admission of<br/>\nfailure and attempt to attone for the bad management<br/>\nof his ward, I think it was less that and more an<br/>\nattempt at a wake-up call for Nobunaga. The incident<br/>\nKitsuno mentions about the horse belonging to Hirate&#39;s<br/>\nson is mentioned in Yoshikawa Eiji&#39;s novel &quot;Taiko&quot;.<br/>\nEssentially, Masahide&#39;s son (can&#39;t remember the name<br/>\nat the moment) had procured a fine white horse, and<br/>\nNobunaga rather selfishly ordered Hirate to give him<br/>\nthe horse, as the master should have finer things than<br/>\nthe retainer. The novel recounts that Masahide&#39;s son<br/>\nchafed at having to give up his horse, but Masahide<br/>\ninstructed him to do so, because his lord had so<br/>\nordered. That night Masahide committed seppuku--the<br/>\nhorse incident being just the final straw. The seppuku<br/>\nwas a final remonstration from an obedient servant<br/>\nwho&#39;d simply seen his lord go too far. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that&#39;s the novel version--reality, I&#39;m not quite<br/>\nsure. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard about the horse<br/>\nincident anywhere else. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!
