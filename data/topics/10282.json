            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1483360835\">Thank you Delwayne for your assistance but I still got the same response from Google along with the same links when I looked up Saijin Omoto and *Saijin Omoto* too like I did when I typed in Omoto-no-Saijin and Otomo-no-Saijin as well but I again thank you for your response to my request. If its okay with you can you enlighten me more on Omoto-no-Saijin based on your opinion and if possible could you see if there is anyone in your group that can also help me out as well. I do know so far from the links I found on him that he was a strategist for Prince Shotoku Taishi but when looking for years he was active and further information on him I can&#39;t find anything on him. Other than the links I already have looked at in prior searches regarding Saijin Omoto. I can give you these same links that I found they primarily say the same thing about Omoto-no-Saijin but I would like an expert&#39;s opinion on the links that I have looked at and if someone from your group with their expertise can help me out as well on this truly rare person in Japanese history. It will be much appreciated because I think there were some samurais that weren&#39;t that famous as other ones were and only were local lords in their villages or retainers for their village. The links I found on Omoto-no Saijin are right here for everyone to look at just in case:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.igaryu.com.ar/leyendas.html&ei=a3ZXTbeRGcqatwf57NnPDA&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBgQ7gEwADgK&prev=/search%3Fq%3Domoto-no-saijin%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns\">http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.igaryu.com.ar/leyendas.html&ei=a3ZXTbeRGcqatwf57NnPDA&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBgQ7gEwADgK&prev=/search%3Fq%3Domoto-no-saijin%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.kogaryu.com.ar/delegacion.html&ei=OnRXTfKlLIGatge3yOGQDQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFkQ7gEwBw&prev=/search%3Fq%3Domoto-no-saijin%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns\">http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.kogaryu.com.ar/delegacion.html&ei=OnRXTfKlLIGatge3yOGQDQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFkQ7gEwBw&prev=/search%3Fq%3Domoto-no-saijin%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(this is the link that I was talking that has his name as Otomo-no-Saijin when other websites have it down as Omoto-no-Saijin but it also brings up that he was a strategist for Prince Shotoku Taishi)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=sv&u=http://paranormal.se/topic/otomo-no-saijin.html&ei=5MgmTak8kc2eB8-M-JcB&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDwQ7gEwBQ&prev=/search%3Fq%3DOtomo-%2Bno-Saijin%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DqQn%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns\">http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=sv&u=http://paranormal.se/topic/otomo-no-saijin.html&ei=5MgmTak8kc2eB8-M-JcB&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDwQ7gEwBQ&prev=/search%3Fq%3DOtomo-%2Bno-Saijin%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DqQn%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns</a><br/>\n<br/>\nagain I thank you for your response and hope the best to you and Samurai Archives its a great site and it goes into a lot of Japanese history no one really knows about hope to speak to you again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohnny Hunter</div>",
