It&#39;s said that 1573 <br/>\nrepresents the end of the Muromachi Bakufu, but I&#39;ve always noticed <br/>\nthat Yoshiaki is allowed to stay alive. I have not been able to find <br/>\nout for sure but as far as I can tell the Emperor did not rescind the <br/>\noffice of Shogun. If Yoshiaki still was Shogun even if in name only, <br/>\nNobunaga would have had to have waited until at least the 1590s (and <br/>\nof course it&#39;s a requirement that Honnoji didn&#39;t end up happening). Or <br/>\nhe would have had to out and out kill Yoshiaki - which I don&#39;t think <br/>\nwould have happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother factor is that Nobunaga had set him self up as being a <br/>\ndescendant of the Taira family. There is a common opinion that <br/>\nthere was no way that a Taira was going to be made Shogun instead of s<br/>\nomeone of the Minamoto (which is why Hideyoshi wanted to be adopted an<br/>\nd why Ieyasu changed his name). This same sentiment would have <br/>\napplied to Nobunaga as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a></div>",

He installed Ashikaga Yoshiaki, brother of the murdered Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiteru, in 1568, only to depose him in the early 1570s. Therefore between then and the victory of Tokugawa Ieyasu there were no Shogun. He was the leading commander in the country, and controller of the Kinai, who year after year was presented with titles from the court, finally reaching daijo daijin in 1578. Yes he never became Shogun, but equally should Ieyasu have become Shogun? (to follow your line of argument). Both were extremely ambitious, often treacherous, characters from equally obscure regional families, and both raised great opposition in and around the Court during their ascendancies. Why, therefore would Nobunaga &quot;probably never&quot; have been Shogun, when Ieyasu established a disciplined, effective Bakufu?<br/>\nM.Lorimer<br/>\n<br/>\nKyle Segall &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:klancesegall@...\">klancesegall@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nWhile its a minor quibble, you should know there&#39;s no &quot;agreeing&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;disagreeing&quot; about Nobunaga being a Shogun.

He set himself (through ambition or just sheer consequence), and eventually Japan upon the route to unification. His control was far more effectual than that imposed four centuries earlier by either Taira no Kiyomori or Minamoto no Yoritomo, but like these earlier examples, his control was only over the central island of Honshu, not Kyushu, Shikoku, Chugoku (although that was under way at the time of his death), Tohoku or Hokkaido. Although more significant than Toyotomi Hideyoshi in what he established, it is Hideyoshi who brought the bulk of the archipelago under a central administration and was e facto unifier, although it was Nobunaga or set the work in motion and undertook much of the hard labour (smashing the Ikko ikki, the Enryakuji, the Imagawa, the Takeda, &c) that made the work of Toyotomi and the Tokugawa considerably easier. <br/>\nM.Lorimer<br/>\n<br/>\nOyakata &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nKitsuno¤µ¤ó¤Î&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:c4prc9+39l6@...\">c4prc9+39l6@...</a>&gt;¤«¤é<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well, since a concequence of his actions led to more and more <br/>\n&gt;territory falling under his control, I think by default Nobunaga is <br/>\n&gt;a &#39;unifier&#39;...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably right to say that he was &quot;a&quot; unifyer, since he took seve<br/>\nral regions that had been under the control of various people and <br/>\nunified them under his control.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes Nobunaga is referred to as &quot;the&quot; unifier implying that <br/>\nhe succeeded in pulling all of Japan under his rule.
