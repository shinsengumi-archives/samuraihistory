Hollywood <br/>\n&gt; makes entertainment and history has a tendency to be boringly <br/>\n&gt; complex, so accuracy and authenticity often gets lost on the way to <br/>\n&gt; the multiplex. <br/>\n&gt; Some Hollywood filmmakers, however, are trying harder to get it <br/>\n&gt; right. One is Edward Zwick -- the director of &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Legends of <br/>\n&gt; the Fall&quot; and, as I learned by e-mail from Zwick himself in June <br/>\n&gt; 2002, &quot;The Last Samurai.&quot; Zwick said he needed people in Japan -- <br/>\n&gt; including me -- to help him with the Japanese dialogue and the <br/>\n&gt; historical details. In short, to get as much as right as possible <br/>\n&gt; without sacrificing the drama. <br/>\n&gt; He admitted to heavily fictionalizing the real-life rebellion, led <br/>\n </span></blockquote>by <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Saigo Takamori, that inspired the film. &quot;I know full well that [the <br/>\n&gt; rebels] took up modern arms to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that I&#39;ve fudged the dates of conscription and the edicts,&quot; he <br/>\n&gt; wrote. &quot;What I need is for you to highlight those descriptions, <br/>\n&gt; interactions, issues that will evoke giggles, if not outrage, from <br/>\n&gt; the Japanese audience.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; This, he added was not just a commercial consideration, but &quot;a <br/>\n&gt; personal and artistic one.&quot; &quot;I honestly believe,&quot; he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>continued, &quot;(and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this is, perhaps, the greatest hubris of all) that I can present <br/>\n&gt; rounded, complex, heroic Japanese characters to an international <br/>\n&gt; audience; that 16-year-olds everywhere might just come away with an <br/>\n&gt; awakened sense that our history and that of Japan were intertwined <br/>\n&gt; long before Pearl Harbor; that words like honor and duty have <br/>\n&gt; resonance throughout history; and that the birth of the modern and <br/>\n&gt; such wrenching transitional moments have resonance and application <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our present circumstance.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; How could I not sign on? My first job was to send Zwick notes on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; script. I picked a few nits, found a few howlers. One of the <br/>\n&gt; characters, a young samurai, was called Yoritomo, the name of a <br/>\n&gt; famous 12th-century warrior and statesman. It was, I wrote Zwick, <br/>\n&gt; like calling a character in a 19th-century British period <br/>\n </span></blockquote>drama &quot;the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sheriff of Nottingham.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Zwick ditched the name. He also accepted several other of my <br/>\n&gt; suggestions, such as changing the martial art the samurai practice <br/>\n&gt; from karate -- which was then known only in Okinawa -- to jujitsu. <br/>\n&gt; Several others, however, he passed over in silence. In one scene, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rebel leader flings his sword end-over-end at an enemy. Couldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; happen, I said -- samurai weren&#39;t knife throwers. But Zwick liked <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; image -- and it stayed in. <br/>\n&gt; More importantly, I found him a Japanese scriptwriter who could <br/>\n&gt; rewrite the Japanese-language script -- a direct translation from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; English that Zwick admitted was &quot;horrible.&quot; Yo Takeyama is a period-<br/>\n&gt; drama veteran whose credits included the hit NHK drama &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; <br/>\n&gt; and the Kon Ichikawa film &quot;Ka-chan.&quot; Meeting several times during <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; summer at a Tokyo ryokan, we went over the script line by line. I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>had <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to make sure Takeyama&#39;s rewrites were reflected accurately in the <br/>\n&gt; English script. In several scenes, he not only corrected the <br/>\n&gt; Japanese, but added new dialogue, all of which had to be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>translated. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We also met with Zwick once in Tokyo. Late for our appointment in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lobby of the Imperial Hotel, I spotted a short, bearded, dark-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>haired <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; man eyeing me through the crowd, rushed over to him and starting <br/>\n&gt; apologizing in Japanese. <br/>\n&gt; It was Zwick. In my panic I had taken him for a vaguely Japanese-<br/>\n&gt; looking assistant -- but he loved being mistaken for one of the <br/>\n&gt; natives. He also hit it off with Takeyama, a tall, lanky former <br/>\n </span></blockquote>actor <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; who is an engaging raconteur and had the answers to his questions <br/>\n&gt; about Meiji court etiquette. <br/>\n&gt; Early in September, Takeyama and I sent off our final batch of <br/>\n&gt; corrections. That October, we went to see the final day of shooting <br/>\n&gt; in Japan, which took place at a temple in Kyoto. When I got to the <br/>\n&gt; set, at around 7 in the morning, Zwick was preparing a simple <br/>\n </span></blockquote>scene --<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Tom Cruise walking up the temple steps with two foreign <br/>\n </span></blockquote>companions. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Beaming, he introduced me to his star, who was being frantically <br/>\n&gt; fussed over by three women -- one in charge of his Army officer <br/>\n&gt; costume, the other his makeup, the other his hair. <br/>\n&gt; I had the odd feeling of stepping out of sleepy, early morning <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Japan <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and into a hyper-charged Hollywood moment. I noticed that Cruise <br/>\n </span></blockquote>had <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tiny crow&#39;s feet around his eyes, wore a retainer on his teeth and <br/>\n&gt; was looking straight at me with that trademark burning gaze. No <br/>\n&gt; surprise there; I had never expected Cruise to be laid back. I was <br/>\n&gt; even ready for the retainer, having read about it on an Internet <br/>\n&gt; gossip column. <br/>\n&gt; What shocked me, first, however, was his height -- I had thought it <br/>\n&gt; was about the same as mine. I later realized that his boots had <br/>\n </span></blockquote>made <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; him stood several centimeters taller. <br/>\n&gt; Second, he really wanted to talk, asking me where I was from, how <br/>\n&gt; long I had been in Japan, and how I liked Tokyo.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-327345657\">From Japan Times:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeeting Hollywood halfway<br/>\n<br/>\nBy MARK SCHILLING<br/>\n<br/>\nHollywood and history have never gotten along very well. Hollywood <br/>\nmakes entertainment and history has a tendency to be boringly <br/>\ncomplex, so accuracy and authenticity often gets lost on the way to <br/>\nthe multiplex. <br/>\nSome Hollywood filmmakers, however, are trying harder to get it <br/>\nright. One is Edward Zwick -- the director of &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Legends of <br/>\nthe Fall&quot; and, as I learned by e-mail from Zwick himself in June <br/>\n2002, &quot;The Last Samurai.&quot; Zwick said he needed people in Japan -- <br/>\nincluding me -- to help him with the Japanese dialogue and the <br/>\nhistorical details. In short, to get as much as right as possible <br/>\nwithout sacrificing the drama. <br/>\nHe admitted to heavily fictionalizing the real-life rebellion, led by <br/>\nSaigo Takamori, that inspired the film. &quot;I know full well that [the <br/>\nrebels] took up modern arms to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate, and <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve fudged the dates of conscription and the edicts,&quot; he <br/>\nwrote. &quot;What I need is for you to highlight those descriptions, <br/>\ninteractions, issues that will evoke giggles, if not outrage, from <br/>\nthe Japanese audience.&quot; <br/>\nThis, he added was not just a commercial consideration, but &quot;a <br/>\npersonal and artistic one.&quot; &quot;I honestly believe,&quot; he continued, &quot;(and <br/>\nthis is, perhaps, the greatest hubris of all) that I can present <br/>\nrounded, complex, heroic Japanese characters to an international <br/>\naudience; that 16-year-olds everywhere might just come away with an <br/>\nawakened sense that our history and that of Japan were intertwined <br/>\nlong before Pearl Harbor; that words like honor and duty have <br/>\nresonance throughout history; and that the birth of the modern and <br/>\nsuch wrenching transitional moments have resonance and application to <br/>\nour present circumstance.&quot; <br/>\nHow could I not sign on? My first job was to send Zwick notes on the <br/>\nscript. I picked a few nits, found a few howlers. One of the <br/>\ncharacters, a young samurai, was called Yoritomo, the name of a <br/>\nfamous 12th-century warrior and statesman. It was, I wrote Zwick, <br/>\nlike calling a character in a 19th-century British period drama &quot;the <br/>\nSheriff of Nottingham.&quot; <br/>\nZwick ditched the name. He also accepted several other of my <br/>\nsuggestions, such as changing the martial art the samurai practice <br/>\nfrom karate -- which was then known only in Okinawa -- to jujitsu. <br/>\nSeveral others, however, he passed over in silence. In one scene, the <br/>\nrebel leader flings his sword end-over-end at an enemy. Couldn&#39;t <br/>\nhappen, I said -- samurai weren&#39;t knife throwers. But Zwick liked the <br/>\nimage -- and it stayed in. <br/>\nMore importantly, I found him a Japanese scriptwriter who could <br/>\nrewrite the Japanese-language script -- a direct translation from the <br/>\nEnglish that Zwick admitted was &quot;horrible.&quot; Yo Takeyama is a period-<br/>\ndrama veteran whose credits included the hit NHK drama &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; <br/>\nand the Kon Ichikawa film &quot;Ka-chan.&quot; Meeting several times during the <br/>\nsummer at a Tokyo ryokan, we went over the script line by line. I had <br/>\nto make sure Takeyama&#39;s rewrites were reflected accurately in the <br/>\nEnglish script. In several scenes, he not only corrected the <br/>\nJapanese, but added new dialogue, all of which had to be translated. <br/>\nWe also met with Zwick once in Tokyo. Late for our appointment in the <br/>\nlobby of the Imperial Hotel, I spotted a short, bearded, dark-haired <br/>\nman eyeing me through the crowd, rushed over to him and starting <br/>\napologizing in Japanese. <br/>\nIt was Zwick. In my panic I had taken him for a vaguely Japanese-<br/>\nlooking assistant -- but he loved being mistaken for one of the <br/>\nnatives. He also hit it off with Takeyama, a tall, lanky former actor <br/>\nwho is an engaging raconteur and had the answers to his questions <br/>\nabout Meiji court etiquette. <br/>\nEarly in September, Takeyama and I sent off our final batch of <br/>\ncorrections. That October, we went to see the final day of shooting <br/>\nin Japan, which took place at a temple in Kyoto. When I got to the <br/>\nset, at around 7 in the morning, Zwick was preparing a simple scene --<br/>\n Tom Cruise walking up the temple steps with two foreign companions. <br/>\nBeaming, he introduced me to his star, who was being frantically <br/>\nfussed over by three women -- one in charge of his Army officer <br/>\ncostume, the other his makeup, the other his hair. <br/>\nI had the odd feeling of stepping out of sleepy, early morning Japan <br/>\nand into a hyper-charged Hollywood moment. I noticed that Cruise had <br/>\ntiny crow&#39;s feet around his eyes, wore a retainer on his teeth and <br/>\nwas looking straight at me with that trademark burning gaze. No <br/>\nsurprise there; I had never expected Cruise to be laid back. I was <br/>\neven ready for the retainer, having read about it on an Internet <br/>\ngossip column. <br/>\nWhat shocked me, first, however, was his height -- I had thought it <br/>\nwas about the same as mine. I later realized that his boots had made <br/>\nhim stood several centimeters taller. <br/>\nSecond, he really wanted to talk, asking me where I was from, how <br/>\nlong I had been in Japan, and how I liked Tokyo. He was trying to put <br/>\nme at ease, but a normal conversation with Tom Cruise was my idea of <br/>\nthe bizarre. Also, I had my own questions -- but it wasn&#39;t the time <br/>\nor place to ask about Nicole. <br/>\nThat brief encounter, and a check, were two of my big rewards for <br/>\nbeing what Warner Brothers called a &quot;Japanese script liaison.&quot; I also <br/>\ngot several later revisions of our own revisions, considerately <br/>\nforwarded to me by Zwick&#39;s company, Samurai Pictures. <br/>\nAt least one of my ideas made it into the final version, as I <br/>\nrecently saw at screening for the press: Samurai practicing jujitsu <br/>\nin the tall grass. In Hollywood, scriptwriters commonly get rewritten <br/>\nout of existence -- I felt lucky to have, in some small way, <br/>\nsurvived. <br/>\nBut will they spell my name right in the credits?</div>",
