H. <br/>\nJackson. There may be others as well. A good read, influenced several <br/>\nJapanese Ukiyo-e artists along with probably others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;its hard to find and harder to read.  very dry.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s more repetitive than anything else, the heros start blending <br/>\ntogether after a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: Re: Dead Subjects-II The Zombies return<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve had no problem with genealogical records in the USA.  There are plenty of <br/>\n&gt;birth/death/marriage certificates back to about the 1840&#39;s or so, as well as <br/>\n&gt;genealogical books that still hold records from even further back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For your family, it&#39;s probably better behaved ;) I have Mormons in my <br/>\nfamily and I know what&#39;s out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Pamela Grayer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:m.grayer@...\">m.grayer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Samura battle tactics<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nate<br/>\n&gt;Can you expand on your statement that Sengoku period armies were using<br/>\n&gt;firearms &#39;to greater effect than Europeans, and on a much more massive<br/>\n&gt;scale&#39;?<br/>\n&gt;What are your sources?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The battle of Lepanto involved over 200,000 people in a naval action! <br/>\nThis is the equivalent of any major Japanese battle in period. The ratio <br/>\nof guns in most of the European armies were probably fairly close to <br/>\nJapan, in recent discussions on another list, figures were around 20-30% <br/>\nfor Europe with Japan peaking around 30%. The much more massive scale I <br/>\nthink is not a justified claim. The period I&#39;m thinking of is post-1550s <br/>\nto the final Sengoku battles.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I agree that Japanese armies of this period were generally more tactically<br/>\n&gt;sophisticated than their European counterparts throughout this period<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s something that&#39;s hard to measure though. I think Japan has a kick <br/>\nass army in this period, but by how much is impossible to determine <br/>\nbecause we can&#39;t steal thier armies and make them fight it out as a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
