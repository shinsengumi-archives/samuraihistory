Thank you for your kindness.<br/>\nYes, of course there is a lot of stuff in Tokyo, but mainly in japanese. I got a history class in Jochii, but most of the students are people only interested in fulfill their quota of classes.<br/>\nAnd my major interst in not only study history or see castles... that is very intersting so far, but I would like to talk and do something about it, although if only to share a cup of ocha and having a passionate discussion about swords and chrysanthemums. With english speakers! (well, spanish is to dream too much) I am so tired and dissapointed myself with my nihongo!<br/>\nThank you again.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom Helm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toryu@...\">toryu@...</a>&gt; wrote:                                  Rod -<br/>\n  Not sure anybody answered you but here is my input.
