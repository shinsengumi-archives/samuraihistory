I find it curious that, assuming you are a<br/>\nChinese emperor, you are so insistent upon using an article.  If<br/>\nanything, most Chinese who are not native speakers of English tend<br/>\nto omit articles, flinging them on the ash heap of lingual<br/>\nmisunderstanding (as I am sure that English speakers similarly<br/>\nbutcher Chinese, or Japanese).  But, because of your exalted<br/>\nposition, I will endeavor to not become too familiar and slip and<br/>\nuse your first name, &quot;The.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I was misunderstood: I meant, a movie treating the subject<br/>\nthat was less than two hours, in English, not subtitled.  You know,<br/>\nthe way a serious researcher would go about things.  (I seriously<br/>\ndoubt there&#39;s anything out there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich would drag me to the OT subject of THE Ming Dynasty, and the<br/>\nthing that has me curious as to its meaning and why in the world the<br/>\nMings were so short-sighted that they completely failed to<br/>\nunderstand and utilize trade:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Although merchants and trade in general were looked down upon,<br/>\nChina had established sea routes that were used for trade with Japan<br/>\nand south Asia. Starting in 1405 A.D., Zheng He began a series of<br/>\nseven naval expeditions that went as far as the east coast of<br/>\nAfrica. These trips followed established routes and were mainly<br/>\ndiplomatic. The last of these voyages was completed in 1433 A.D. At<br/>\nthis point, China was far ahead of the rest of the world in naval<br/>\ncapabilities. Their ships could carry as many as 500 men. However,<br/>\nafter the last voyage was completed none were ever again attempted.<br/>\nIn fact, records of the trips were destroyed and shipbuilding was<br/>\nrestricted to small-size vessels. As a result, China&#39;s coast was<br/>\nfrequently attacked by pirates.&quot;  --<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/china/later_imperial_china/min\">http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/china/later_imperial_china/min</a><br/>\ng.html<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, paint me with purple dog excrement sideways, but doesn&#39;t that<br/>\nseem to be a bit, well, insular?

At <br/>\nthis point, China was far ahead of the rest of the world in naval <br/>\ncapabilities. Their ships could carry as many as 500 men. However, <br/>\nafter the last voyage was completed none were ever again attempted. <br/>\nIn fact, records of the trips were destroyed and shipbuilding was <br/>\nrestricted to small-size vessels.

It was a different movie,<br/>\n&gt; where he was on an <br/>\n&gt; island... ah, &quot;Far and Away.&quot;  No.  Wait.  I&#39;ll get<br/>\n&gt; it.  Was it <br/>\n&gt; called &quot;The Last Scientologist&quot;? (Yes, I know,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re all grinding <br/>\n&gt; your teeth... in unison... It&#39;s like when people<br/>\n&gt; think that Kate <br/>\n&gt; Blanchet in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; was a good representation of<br/>\n&gt; history for <br/>\n&gt; Tudor England.  And Ninjaburger.com is the end-all<br/>\n&gt; for learning the <br/>\n&gt; history of the Ninja, you know.

Makes<br/>\na donkey out of you and Ming. And the Ming don&#39;t like<br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome things are quite specific. Some things are very<br/>\ngeneral. And more things than should probably get let<br/>\nin, including inside jokes.

No, I&#39;m not doing a report on Samurai for school<br/>\n&gt; and need you <br/>\n&gt; all to do my research for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like the guy who posted right after you? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 7.  No, I&#39;m not in the military, either, but kudos<br/>\n&gt; and thank you to <br/>\n&gt; those of you who are now serving.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 9.

However, minor<br/>\nmistakes are acceptable--nobody is perfect. The issue<br/>\nis wilfull abuse of spelling, punctuation, and<br/>\ngrammar.

I don&#39;t know much about the period.  &quot;Why,&quot; then, you ask, &quot;are<br/>\nyou on here?&quot;  I suppose I&#39;ll learn a lot by reading the posts, eh?<br/>\nThat&#39;s also why I won&#39;t be saying much, since at this time, I have<br/>\nnothing to draw from to speak.  Wait, I saw a movie with Tom Cruise<br/>\nin it... it was called, I think, &quot;Top Gun.&quot;  Samurai use F14s...<br/>\nno, &#39;fraid I&#39;m wrong.  It was a different movie, where he was on an<br/>\nisland... ah, &quot;Far and Away.&quot;  No.  Wait.  I&#39;ll get it.  Was it<br/>\ncalled &quot;The Last Scientologist&quot;? (Yes, I know, you&#39;re all grinding<br/>\nyour teeth... in unison... It&#39;s like when people think that Kate<br/>\nBlanchet in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; was a good representation of history for<br/>\nTudor England.  And Ninjaburger.com is the end-all for learning the<br/>\nhistory of the Ninja, you know.  [See #3 below.])<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  You lot are prolific (that is, for you aspiring elementary<br/>\nteachers: &quot;pro·lif·ic (pr-lfk) adj.  Producing abundant works or<br/>\nresults: a prolific artist. See Synonyms at fertile.&quot;--<br/>\nDictionary.com).  Notwithstanding the literary achievements of<br/>\nvarious aspiring elementary teachers and their ilk (look at all them<br/>\nthere nickel words!), it appears it&#39;s going to take me a month or<br/>\ntwo to wade through the sheer mass of posts.  I am assuming that<br/>\nbecause the forum is moderated, the ratio of dross to content will<br/>\nbe very low, and that much of the content is going to be quite<br/>\nspecific, rather than broad generalizations that we should all know<br/>\nbecause we read a book once in school.  (This, of course, does not<br/>\neven come close to applying to those of you who have WRITTEN the<br/>\nbooks, rather than just read them.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Ninjaburger.com?  Even my pet, who has no opposable thumbs, and<br/>\ncan barely remember or perceive beyond eat/excrete/sleep, knows this<br/>\nis a joke site.  Then again, people believe that there are infected<br/>\nAIDS needles hidden in gas pump handles and that there&#39;s a Nigerian<br/>\nwho is going to give them a couple million dollars for one bank<br/>\ntransaction...<br/>\n<br/>\nQ.  No, I don&#39;t study any martial arts (though I&#39;m familiar with,<br/>\nbut not a practitioner, of the fruits of that old bigamist, Mr.<br/>\nOkazaki, known as Jujitsu).<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  No, I&#39;m not doing a report on Samurai for school and need you<br/>\nall to do my research for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  No, I&#39;m not doing a website on Samurai and need you all to do my<br/>\nresearch for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  No, I&#39;m not in the military, either, but kudos and thank you to<br/>\nthose of you who are now serving.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.  No, I&#39;m not in the S.C.A.<br/>\n<br/>\n9.  Samurai is spelled with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;  Samurai is spelled<br/>\nwith a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;  Samurai is spelled with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;<br/>\n(Thank you MS Word spellchecker.)  This should be good enough to<br/>\nkeep Mr. Ledbetter mollified... but if I slip and spell it with<br/>\nan &quot;a,&quot; may I get a &quot;Get Out of Spelling Jail Free&quot; card, please?<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to learning about the period.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll run into<br/>\na good reading list somewhere on a recommended website and will be<br/>\nable to locate the most common texts at my local library (the Los<br/>\nAngeles County Central Library... which has an impressive amount of<br/>\nbooks, to be sure.  Most of them are not relevant).  In fact, my<br/>\nsearch method will probably be to start in the Japanese history<br/>\nsection and see what&#39;s there, start broad, and then narrow it down<br/>\nas I familiarize myself with who the players are in the history.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com<br/>\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives<br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!

It&#39;s like when people<br/>\n&gt; think that Kate <br/>\n&gt; Blanchet in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; was a good representation of<br/>\n&gt; history for <br/>\n&gt; Tudor England.  And Ninjaburger.com is the end-all<br/>\n&gt; for learning the <br/>\n&gt; history of the Ninja, you know.

Makes<br/>\na donkey out of you and Ming. And the Ming don&#39;t like<br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome things are quite specific. Some things are very<br/>\ngeneral. And more things than should probably get let<br/>\nin, including inside jokes. I&#39;m trying to cut down on<br/>\nthose, but sometimes I just can&#39;t help it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.  Ninjaburger.com?

However, minor<br/>\nmistakes are acceptable--nobody is perfect. The issue<br/>\nis wilfull abuse of spelling, punctuation, and<br/>\ngrammar. If you slip and type &quot;samarai&quot; once, that&#39;s<br/>\nfine. If over the course of 5 emails you spell it that<br/>\nway 25 times, we have a problem. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sure I&#39;ll run into <br/>\n&gt; a good reading list somewhere on a recommended<br/>\n&gt; website <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>www.samuraiarchives.com has a great list.

Notwithstanding the literary achievements of <br/>\nvarious aspiring elementary teachers and their ilk (look at all them <br/>\nthere nickel words!), it appears it&#39;s going to take me a month or <br/>\ntwo to wade through the sheer mass of posts.  I am assuming that <br/>\nbecause the forum is moderated, the ratio of dross to content will <br/>\nbe very low, and that much of the content is going to be quite <br/>\nspecific, rather than broad generalizations that we should all know <br/>\nbecause we read a book once in school.

Even my pet, who has no opposable thumbs, and <br/>\ncan barely remember or perceive beyond eat/excrete/sleep, knows this <br/>\nis a joke site.

No, I don&#39;t study any martial arts (though I&#39;m familiar with, <br/>\nbut not a practitioner, of the fruits of that old bigamist, Mr. <br/>\nOkazaki, known as Jujitsu).  <br/>\n<br/>\n5.  No, I&#39;m not doing a report on Samurai for school and need you <br/>\nall to do my research for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  No, I&#39;m not doing a website on Samurai and need you all to do my <br/>\nresearch for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll run into <br/>\na good reading list somewhere on a recommended website and will be <br/>\nable to locate the most common texts at my local library (the Los <br/>\nAngeles County Central Library... which has an impressive amount of <br/>\nbooks, to be sure.  Most of them are not relevant).  In fact, my <br/>\nsearch method will probably be to start in the Japanese history <br/>\nsection and see what&#39;s there, start broad, and then narrow it down <br/>\nas I familiarize myself with who the players are in the history.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt</div>",
