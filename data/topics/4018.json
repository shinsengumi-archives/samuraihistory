To many people think samurai are super human honourable <br/>\ndashing chracters and that just doesnt exist. akira kurosawas films <br/>\naimed at showing this. True honour comes from within the fight for <br/>\nwhat you feel is right not some rich war lord that sends you to war <br/>\nto inrich his estates.
