What does the Australian Sword ban accomplish exactly?<br/>\nI know they have had a problem with hoards of roaming outlaw Samurai <br/>\nand Ninja but I thought the f arms ban took care of that <br/>\nproblem.Seriously- will Australia repeat something like Bill Clintons <br/>\nrape of the National Armoury here in the States? Many priceless <br/>\nhistorical pieces were lost forever-perhaps Aus. sword collectors, <br/>\nmuseums or who ever might be affected should get your collections to <br/>\nsafety.(Will museums be affected?) As for crossbows- don&#39;t go there- <br/>\nI&#39;m disabled and hunt with one.</div>",
