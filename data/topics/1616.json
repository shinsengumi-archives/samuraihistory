            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1537574244\">Konnichi wa Kazuari san<br/>\nI completely understand what you mean, being a Kenjutsu & Kendo teacher, I have done some integrate study into this matter.<br/>\nIn Japanese fencing (Kendo), the left hand is the stronger of the two..and are often forgotten by practitioners...The left maintain center, co-ordination, motion and balance. The teachings of some martial forms actually cultivate the usage of both left and right, there should be no strong and weak side, that&#39;s why a technique have Hidari & Migi. If ones&#39; lefthanded it is of great advantage in Kendo, especialy in the Jodan Kamae forms...there the left need to execute a Men with accuracy and speed..whereas the rightys will try and throw it...where the left cut.<br/>\nIn Kenjutsu, balance is of utmost importance as you know.....Balance of the spheres in respect to Left and Right movements. I was asked by a denshi which hand are much stronger, and best to use in Kenjutsu and I said &quot;Yes&quot;.<br/>\nThe body parts works together as a unit of efficiency and organized motion. The Left...is of vital importance, so if someone&#39;s left-handed..less cultivation in co-ordination is needed But!!!..this must be remembered..once the practitioner utilize strength..left or not..such technique and motion become no good..the essence aspect of Kenjutsu is application for the blade is sharp enough..so no strength is needed....only technique in application of form.<br/>\nThere is one technique that can outmove any righty....due to the consistant use of the left throughout the leftys life....that hand with the eye and motion of efficiency are oiled for a faster response.<br/>\nThat technique is common in Kenjutsu teaching, and can be seen at the very end of Kurusawas movie Yojimbo....Before the uchidashi could draw with his right..Yojimbo drew his blade with the left and guided it with the right through the opponents chest under the arm cavity.<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nDeon<br/>\n Atisi Kazuari &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:broccolihead30@...\">broccolihead30@...</a>&gt; wrote:The sword and more importantly the Daisho( long and short) where the <br/>\nbadge of the bushi class.
