Sorry my computer doesn&#39;t have kanji but the first syllable is ko as in small, samurai as in samurai and tokoro as in place, shoshi is two characters sho the same as place and shi as in official. This is from the recent taiga drama Hojo Tokimune. Its some kind of rank or post that the young Tokimune is placed in. I have a vague idea that it is some kind of samurai training regimen.  Also does anyone know what family Sanuki, the mother of Tokisuke, Tokimunes half brother, came from? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
