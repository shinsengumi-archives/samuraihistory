I am perfectly willing to believe you, but it would be nice to <br/>\ncite a war tale or some other source so that folks such as myself can <br/>\ngo look at for themselves. However, from your examples, they sound like <br/>\nsmall unit commanders. Incidentally, unit sizes are not universal even <br/>\nin modern and Roman armies. The size of a Roman century was frequently <br/>\nsomething other than 100. Regardless, &quot;taichô&quot; is not in Kodansha <br/>\nKogojiten. Incidentally, the definition for tai in daijirin 1st edition <br/>\nsuggests that a tai is a fairly small unit capable of unitary movement <br/>\non the battlefield. Interestingly, taichô appears to be a vague term. <br/>\nSince people appear to be generally interested in ranks, possibly one <br/>\nof the oldest ranks is gochô. The reason I am suggesting this isthat I <br/>\nrecollect seeing the go in gochô on flags in battle paintings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and  duties are <br/>\n&gt; held<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; at the pleasure of the overlord in question.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Not quite so simple. A medieval unit commander can &quot;own&quot; his unit <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; owe service to his overlord. Medieval commanders did not have quite <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; personnel reassignment capability as that of a modern army. <br/>\n&gt; Regardless,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; what was going on in Japan can be quite complex having to do with <br/>\n&gt; shiki<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; rights, parallel rank and appointment systems, and all sorts of <br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  And how does ANY of that change the facts as I&#39;ve stated them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tony there are plenty of perfectly good books out there about <br/>\ndistinctions in land tenure. You appear to be suggesting that all of <br/>\nthese were appointive and held from above. I am pointing out that at <br/>\nleast in some feudal societies there is a distinction between various <br/>\nsorts of land tenure. You see these with new fields, permanent <br/>\ncommendations, &c. If my books weren&#39;t off in a storage building, I <br/>\nwould cite you a specific source on this one, but can not at the <br/>\nmoment. Finally, taking your unit and switching sides and similar <br/>\nindependence was a fairly common feature of pre-modern and specifically <br/>\nmedieval warfare.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, one of the problems of feudally structured armies is that <br/>\nyou can not so easily separate Patton from his division or MacArthur <br/>\nfrom his army. Even fairly recently, military units might be raised and <br/>\nequipped by their commanders.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-493368984\">Hi.<br/>\n<br/>\nA general characteristic of feudalism is that armies are organized <br/>\naround individuals. Thus, you will see a lot of units being known by <br/>\ntheir commander. In such a system, you will see comparatively little <br/>\nsystematic organization by military ranks. That is usually a feature of <br/>\nnon-feudal armies such as the Roman army or modern armies where the <br/>\nmilitary is divorced from the land. There is a Japanese drive to form <br/>\n&quot;ranks and levels&quot;, but this is expressed through a system of <br/>\nappointments to office both in several different kinds of institution <br/>\nwhich could and did exist at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The ancient uji offices which by the time you are interested in were <br/>\npretty much ceremonial. These titles are called kabane and there is a <br/>\nmonograph on them which you can find by a Worldcat search. In the time <br/>\nyou are probably interested in, these were the cap-ranks of the kuge <br/>\n(courtier) class. The number of kabane was changed a couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The the ancient court ranks and offices. These are of interest to <br/>\nthe samurai and includes the title Sei-i-tai-shougun. All high-ranking <br/>\nsamurai aspired to court rank and office.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The kuge household offices.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The offices of the Kamakura bakufu, the Muromachi bakufu, and the <br/>\nTokugawa bakufu. Ones which are of particular interest are jitou and <br/>\nthe shugo. The jitou were basically local tax collectors and estate <br/>\nmanagers. Their appointment was absorbed by the Kamakura bakufu. The <br/>\nshugo were provincial constables whose office roughly paralleled the <br/>\nimperial provincial governors. The shuo, and most especially after the <br/>\nOnin-Ran evolved into the daimyou which you are probably familiar with <br/>\nfrom the Sengoku period.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Buke (samurai) household officials. You frequently see these people <br/>\nin movies set in the Edo period.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Buddhist temples could and did function as the equivalent of either <br/>\nkuge estates or buke fiefdoms. They of course had their own <br/>\nadministrative structures.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless these different systems co-existed and each of them provided <br/>\nrevenue streams or &quot;pay grades&quot; for the various people entitled to <br/>\nthem. According to the war stories, when meeting on the battlefield, <br/>\nwarriors of high rank would declare their names and various <br/>\nentitlements to each other when they believed that their opponent was <br/>\nof adequately comparable rank. These declarations are called &quot;nanori&quot;. <br/>\nThis term also refers to one component of the names born by Japanese of <br/>\nsufficient rank.</div>",

There are also the titles held by leaders of the <br/>\nancient clans. Alas, these are not included in the tables that I just <br/>\nmentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo complicate things, the Japanese very seldom abandoned any titles or <br/>\noffices once they came into use until a general reform of titles during <br/>\nthe Meiji Restoration in the nineteenth century.

There&#39;s<br/>\nrank, yes, but that&#39;s SOCIAL rank, not military rank.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the critical division between HAVING rank (e.g.,<br/>\na duke, a baron, a flunky) and HOLDING rank (e.g., a<br/>\ngeneral, a captain, a PFC).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe historical samurai army was a FEUDAL army, not a<br/>\nmodern one with rank structures in place. As a friend<br/>\nof mine [that would be me--lt] once pointed out, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;join&quot; a samurai army as an &quot;ashigaru 2nd class&quot;<br/>\nand work your way up to &quot;1st samurai.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a feudal structure, the army was vertical;<br/>\nauthority went up and down within the specific clan or<br/>\nalliance affiliation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic &quot;rank&quot; was taisho(which can be translated<br/>\nvariously as general, lieutenant, captain, commander,<br/>\netc.). Essentially, a taisho commands a body of men.<br/>\nPeriod. It depends on his relationship with others as<br/>\nhow you define it. For example, on his own, you can<br/>\ncall Honda Tadakatsu a great general. But in terms of<br/>\nhis relationship to Tokugawa Ieyasu, he would be<br/>\ntypically called &quot;one of Ieyasu&#39;s best generals,&quot; &quot;one<br/>\nof Ieyasu&#39;s best lieutenants,&quot; or &quot;one of Ieyasu&#39;s<br/>\nbest captains.&quot; All of those refer to the JOBS<br/>\n(generals command, and captains and lieutenants lead<br/>\nbut serve UNDER someone else), not to ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people would generally be surprised at how<br/>\nmodern the concept of rank-structure in armies is.<br/>\nActually, the Romans were very rank/office set with<br/>\nthe way they did their legions (the first modern<br/>\narmies, afterall), and after them it was centuries<br/>\nbefore anything like it was recreated. I think that it<br/>\nmight be a factor of the &quot;equality&quot; of a republican<br/>\nform of government that created that modern army, as<br/>\nit was certainly not a typical feudal structurelike<br/>\nthat which pervaded Europe from the Normans on, until<br/>\nGustav Adolphus&#39; &quot;new model army&quot; -- and even then it<br/>\nwas looser than we think of ranks today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no denying that the chef outranks a busboy.<br/>\nBut neither chef nor busboy are ranks. They are jobs<br/>\nand positions. The chef is, however, very important<br/>\nand gets to tell people what to do. And busboys are<br/>\nlow-boy on the totem pole. It&#39;s like saying &quot;would you<br/>\nagree that the king outranks a knight.&quot; Well, duh.<br/>\nKing and knight aren&#39;t &quot;ranks&quot; either, precisely<br/>\nspeaking, but the relationship of their roles is clear<br/>\nenough.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut those aren&#39;t ranks. They&#39;re JOBS. There&#39;s a<br/>\ndifference, and it&#39;s a fairly critical one. Ranks tend<br/>\nto have a consistency. A lieutenant always has<br/>\nX-number of people under him, a major X-number of<br/>\npeople, a general X-number and so on. A taisho can<br/>\nhave 50, 500, or 5,000.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most basic level of &quot;rank&quot; -- that of kashira or<br/>\ntaicho -- doesn&#39;t even have a specific number of<br/>\ntroops to be led. It depends on the army makeup. A<br/>\ntaicho (lit. &quot;group-chief&quot;) can have five people or 50<br/>\nunder him, depending on the job and the specific<br/>\nassignment. In modern army terms, that could be<br/>\nanything from a squad to a company to a platoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, unlike the modern army, once appointed &quot;ashigaru<br/>\ntaicho&quot; one could just as quickly be removed from that<br/>\nposition. While such assignments are social<br/>\npromotions, they are not MILITARY promotions like to<br/>\nCorporal or Sgt. or Master Sgt, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any feudally structured army, ALL positions and<br/>\nduties are held at the pleasure of the overlord in<br/>\nquestion. There is no way to say &quot;I&#39;m a first<br/>\nsergeant, you can&#39;t make me a private without due<br/>\ncause and a court-martial.&quot; Even &quot;permanent&quot;<br/>\nappointments (such as that of a taicho) in a Japanese<br/>\narmy were understood to be continued appointments that<br/>\ncould be withdrawn at any time (or magnified with<br/>\nfurther postings) and not one&#39;s &quot;right&quot; to the<br/>\nposition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one reason I fight so hard to eliminate the use<br/>\nof &quot;ranks&quot; when talking about a feudal Japanese army.<br/>\nOr, rather, when the term is used, I try to keep it<br/>\nclearly a socio-political reference, or something<br/>\nimplying that someone HAS (as in &quot;a taisho outranks<br/>\nthe common footsoldier&quot;) but avoid using terms that<br/>\nimply a person HOLDS rank.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
