            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-257463327\">Hi.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that that you may be trying to invent a class here. There were <br/>\nvery low ranking samurai who doubled as peasants in that they actually <br/>\nengaged in agriculture. But, they were members of the buke class. <br/>\nAnother issue is that this was a time when there was a fair demand for <br/>\nsoldiers, so a peasant might run away and try to join somebody&#39;s army. <br/>\nRegardless, I believe that there is a fairly recent scholarly text on <br/>\n&quot;Samurai Warfare&quot; available. There may have also been camp followers, <br/>\nbut these would have been scavengers. Regardless, I do not recall <br/>\nbattle paintings showing secondary groups of support units. Finally, <br/>\ngiven the relative scarcity of iron in Japan, I rather doubt that <br/>\nanyone was being frivolously armed. The same goes for horses.</div>",

We want to know the actual involvment of peseants/baggage <br/>\nhandlers porters etc that accompanied the samurai in battles of this <br/>\nperiod. We have two trains of thought that these were enrolled in the <br/>\narmies and fought along with the ashigaru units.  The other that they <br/>\nwere a non combative role and remained in the rear even though <br/>\ntechnically they may have been armed with some weapons etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas or responses would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew Collyer</div>",
