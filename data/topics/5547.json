            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-898702357\">Weekend Beat/PICTURE SHOW: News sheet exhibition depicts early <br/>\nJapanese encounters with the West <br/>\nBy MANABU HARA, Senior Staff Writer <br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat is kawaraban? Literally a roof-tile print, it was, says the <br/>\nKodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, ``a commercial news sheet of the Edo <br/>\nPeriod (1603-1867). It is thought that the name kawaraban derives <br/>\nfrom the fact that engraved roofing tiles were once used as printing <br/>\nplates; early on, however, the tiles were replaced by woodblocks.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, kawaraban was a prototype of today&#39;s newspaper that <br/>\nflourished in Edo (Tokyo). No wonder then that many kawaraban <br/>\ndepicted with surprise and fear Commodore Matthew Perry&#39;s kurofune <br/>\n(black ships), which appeared off Uraga, near Yokohama, in 1853. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecords of Japanese being startled by modern Western civilization <br/>\nare now on display at the Japan Newspaper Museum in Yokohama. The <br/>\nexhibition, which lasts until Sept. 26, includes ukiyo-e pictures of <br/>\nthe modern Western ships that approached Japan at the end of the Edo <br/>\nPeriod and American and British picture papers reporting on <br/>\nexpeditions to Japan. The articles are owned by private collectors <br/>\nbelonging to a group called the Yokohama Kurofune Kenkyukai <br/>\n(Yokohama black-ship study group). <br/>\n<br/>\nPerry entered Edo Bay (now Tokyo Bay) to break open the door that <br/>\nJapan had long closed to the outside world. Strongly pressured by <br/>\nthe U.S. naval commander, the Tokugawa government reluctantly <br/>\nconcluded in 1854 what it called the ``Kanagawa treaty,&#39;&#39; opening <br/>\nthe door for the United States. The exhibition commemorates the <br/>\n150th anniversary of the Kanagawa treaty. <br/>\n<br/>\nKawaraban was one of the few means for average Japanese to learn <br/>\nwhat was going on in their society. The illustrations in the news <br/>\nsheets, depicted by anonymous but imaginative artists, show how <br/>\naverage Japanese perceived Western civilization. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe exhibition is divided into six parts reflecting different <br/>\nhistorical stages, including the first appearance of the U.S. fleet, <br/>\nthe subsequent opening of the port of Yokohama and the development <br/>\nof the city under the influence of Western culture. The exhibition <br/>\nis basically intended to convey how kawaraban and ukiyo-e recounted <br/>\nthe arrival of Western civilization. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany kawaraban illustrations depict Westerners as tengu (a long-<br/>\nnosed goblin), a fantasy creature that Japanese thought had <br/>\nsupernatural power. The pictures of tengu show that what most struck <br/>\nJapanese were Westerners&#39; big noses. They give the impression that <br/>\nJapanese found Westerners frightening or mysterious. One Western <br/>\nnaval officer is shown with a traditional Chinese sword, which seems <br/>\nto indicate that information about foreigners was jumbled. <br/>\n<br/>\nA kawaraban that evokes laughs shows a group of kneeling Westerners, <br/>\nincluding Perry, bowing before a large Japanese, who is depicted as <br/>\nthe hero of a renowned drama called ``Kokusen ya Kassen&#39;&#39; (The <br/>\nBattles of Coxing). The picture seems to be saying that when <br/>\nconfronting unwelcome matters, people are apt to believe things of <br/>\nadvantage to themselves, a tendency that continues to this day. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo English-language newspapers on exhibit are Gleason&#39;s Pictorial, <br/>\npublished in the United States, and the Illustrated London News. The <br/>\nAmerican newspaper predicts a coming war between a daimyo and a <br/>\ncombined Western fleet, saying: ``recent intelligence from Japan <br/>\nlooks like an approaching renewal of hostilities with one of the <br/>\nDaimyos or half-independent Princes of that country who are <br/>\nnominally vassals of the Tycoon.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nJapanese today do not depict Westerners as tengu. But could it be <br/>\nthey have the same kind of feeling toward the West that their <br/>\nancestors did? After seeing these prized artifacts from the end of <br/>\nthe Edo Period, viewers may leave the exhibition pondering that <br/>\nthought.(IHT/Asahi: September 11,2004) (09/11)</div>",
