I will dig <br/>\nit up and<br/>\n&gt; send it to you if you are interested.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All the info was from &quot;Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-<br/>\n1945&quot; by<br/>\n&gt; Hansgeorg Jentschura, Dieter Jung, and Peter Mickel. USNI Press <br/>\n1992.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More info: Ordered for the Confederate States&#39; Navy as the Sphinx; <br/>\nlaunched<br/>\n&gt; 21 June 1864, completed 25 October 1864; bought by Denmark and <br/>\nrenamed<br/>\n&gt; Staerkodder, after being blockaded in Corunna by Federal warships <br/>\nSacramento<br/>\n&gt; and Niagara the sale was not completed, and she was renamed CSS <br/>\nStonewall;<br/>\n&gt; 1865 surrendered to Federal forces after which she was bought for <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; Shoguns fleet. You have the rest of the info from this point. A <br/>\nnote of<br/>\n&gt; interest is that in Conway&#39;s All the World&#39;s Fighting Ships they <br/>\nstate that<br/>\n&gt; the reason for the US retaking ownership from the Japanese after <br/>\nthe initial<br/>\n&gt; purchase was because the Japanese simply did not yet have the <br/>\nfacilities to<br/>\n&gt; take care of her nor enough experience to crew her. Once the <br/>\nJapanese were<br/>\n&gt; ready they once again took possession and that is when she was <br/>\nrenamed<br/>\n&gt; Kotetsu.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other source for the above is Conway&#39;s All the World&#39;s Fighting <br/>\nShips<br/>\n&gt; 1860-1905.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want more details as to armament and type of armor <br/>\nmanufacture just<br/>\n&gt; let me know. Most you have already but there are some differences <br/>\nbetween<br/>\n&gt; Conway&#39;s, Jane&#39;s and Warship&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Her sister the Prussian/German Prinz Adalbert: (Source-Conway&#39;s <br/>\n1860-1905<br/>\n&gt; German section)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dis: 1535 tons<br/>\n&gt; Dim: 186&#39; 8&quot; overall, 165&#39; 7&quot; at the waterline, 32&#39;6&quot; beam, 16&#39;6&quot; <br/>\ndraft.<br/>\n&gt; Mach: 2-shaft HSE, 1200ihp=10kts.<br/>\n&gt; Armor: Wrought iron, Belt 5&quot;, tower 4 ?&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Armament: 1-120mm, 2-170mm.<br/>\n&gt; Crew: 130<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This ironclad ram originally known as Cheops, was under <br/>\nconstruction at<br/>\n&gt; Bordeaux for the Confederacy, to her builders design, together with <br/>\na sister<br/>\n&gt; ship Stonewall Jackson, later the Japanese Azuma. She was purchased <br/>\nfor the<br/>\n&gt; Prussian Navy in June 1865, but not put into service until a year <br/>\nlater. She<br/>\n&gt; was not a particularly good bargain, being a bad seaboat, and the <br/>\ntimbers of<br/>\n&gt; her composite hull rapidly fell prey to rot. Though the Prussians <br/>\nreplaced<br/>\n&gt; her original intended armament of three 32pdrs with bigger guns in <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; five-ported bow position and in the two-gun octagonal citadel abaft <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; funnel, she could not be considered a particularly powerful ship. <br/>\nShe was<br/>\n&gt; schooner rigged. She was placed in reserve because of wood rot as <br/>\nearly as<br/>\n&gt; October 1871, and disarmed in 1875/6.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gee, it feels good to be able to actually answer something here on <br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; list! ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The first mentioned book is easily available while the older <br/>\nConway&#39;s are a<br/>\n&gt; little harder to find.

I will dig it up and<br/>\nsend it to you if you are interested.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the info was from &quot;Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945&quot; by<br/>\nHansgeorg Jentschura, Dieter Jung, and Peter Mickel. USNI Press 1992.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore info: Ordered for the Confederate States&#39; Navy as the Sphinx; launched<br/>\n21 June 1864, completed 25 October 1864; bought by Denmark and renamed<br/>\nStaerkodder, after being blockaded in Corunna by Federal warships Sacramento<br/>\nand Niagara the sale was not completed, and she was renamed CSS Stonewall;<br/>\n1865 surrendered to Federal forces after which she was bought for the<br/>\nShoguns fleet. You have the rest of the info from this point. A note of<br/>\ninterest is that in Conway&#39;s All the World&#39;s Fighting Ships they state that<br/>\nthe reason for the US retaking ownership from the Japanese after the initial<br/>\npurchase was because the Japanese simply did not yet have the facilities to<br/>\ntake care of her nor enough experience to crew her. Once the Japanese were<br/>\nready they once again took possession and that is when she was renamed<br/>\nKotetsu.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other source for the above is Conway&#39;s All the World&#39;s Fighting Ships<br/>\n1860-1905.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want more details as to armament and type of armor manufacture just<br/>\nlet me know. Most you have already but there are some differences between<br/>\nConway&#39;s, Jane&#39;s and Warship&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer sister the Prussian/German Prinz Adalbert: (Source-Conway&#39;s 1860-1905<br/>\nGerman section)<br/>\n<br/>\nDis: 1535 tons<br/>\nDim: 186&#39; 8&quot; overall, 165&#39; 7&quot; at the waterline, 32&#39;6&quot; beam, 16&#39;6&quot; draft.<br/>\nMach: 2-shaft HSE, 1200ihp=10kts.<br/>\nArmor: Wrought iron, Belt 5&quot;, tower 4 ?&quot;.<br/>\nArmament: 1-120mm, 2-170mm.<br/>\nCrew: 130<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ironclad ram originally known as Cheops, was under construction at<br/>\nBordeaux for the Confederacy, to her builders design, together with a sister<br/>\nship Stonewall Jackson, later the Japanese Azuma. She was purchased for the<br/>\nPrussian Navy in June 1865, but not put into service until a year later. She<br/>\nwas not a particularly good bargain, being a bad seaboat, and the timbers of<br/>\nher composite hull rapidly fell prey to rot. Though the Prussians replaced<br/>\nher original intended armament of three 32pdrs with bigger guns in the<br/>\nfive-ported bow position and in the two-gun octagonal citadel abaft the<br/>\nfunnel, she could not be considered a particularly powerful ship. She was<br/>\nschooner rigged. She was placed in reserve because of wood rot as early as<br/>\nOctober 1871, and disarmed in 1875/6.<br/>\n<br/>\nGee, it feels good to be able to actually answer something here on this<br/>\nlist! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first mentioned book is easily available while the older Conway&#39;s are a<br/>\nlittle harder to find. If you are looking to get them let me know and I will<br/>\npoint you in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nBill M.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: M. R.
