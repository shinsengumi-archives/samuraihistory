I picked up <br/>\nhis books when I was a medeival recreationist (For a decade I made <br/>\nJapanese armor for sale to other recreationists). I think it depends <br/>\non who you&#39;re teaching-- when I was working on my Bachelor&#39;s degree <br/>\nin Asian Studies, the professor cited some of Turnbull&#39;s writings, to <br/>\ngive us a feel for particular aspects of Japanese culture. When I did <br/>\nmy Masters in Japanese history, my advisor, Dr Paul Varley, knew of <br/>\nTurnbull but never had reason to cite him (nor did the other Japanese <br/>\nhistory faculty at my school). <br/>\n   By all means read Turnbull for background, then move on to deeper <br/>\nscholarship in particular topics. I respect him as a very influential <br/>\npopularizer of Japanese history, but don&#39;t normally think of him as a <br/>\nhistorian, since the books I have from him aren&#39;t written in <br/>\nhistorian style (lacking footnotes...). Of course, I haven&#39;t written <br/>\nanything that got published either, and he has done plenty. Like I <br/>\nsaid, he&#39;s well worth reading to get started, or to fill in on topics <br/>\nyou don&#39;t know well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Hazlett<br/>\nJapanese History MA from Univ. of Hawaii, 1999 <br/>\nthesis title &quot;Japanese Overseas Trade During the Ming Dynasty&quot;<br/>\nnow a Texas A&M PhD student in the Nautical Archaeology Program</div>",
