Many of the Japanese left stirring accounts of their <br/>\nexperiences there. They also just happened to confront the Taiping <br/>\nRebellion, probably the largest peasant rebellion in history till <br/>\nthen, when Taiping forces attacked the Chinese city while the <br/>\nJapanese were there.<br/>\n<br/>\nEighty-two years later, in 1944, the Japanese made a movie on <br/>\nlocation in occupied Shanghai about that voyage of 1862. The film <br/>\nwas lost at war&#39;s end and only rediscovered in late 2001.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy presentation will look first at the initial voyage, then at the <br/>\nmovie and the message it sought to convey, and finally at why sixty <br/>\nyears since it was shot and 140 years since the mission took place, <br/>\nthe story retains such extraordinary poignancy today.&quot;</div>",
