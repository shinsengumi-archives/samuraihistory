Everything after that smacks of a<br/>\n&quot;okay....what do I do now?&quot; feel. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That he miscalculated in who might be willing to<br/>\n&gt; ally with him <br/>\n&gt; subsequent to killing Nobunaga only became fully<br/>\n&gt; clear in the days <br/>\n&gt; after the Akechi rose up against the Oda. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, but rather than make any attempt to garner their<br/>\nsupport BEFORE he acted, he acted and then assumed<br/>\nhe&#39;d get their support. You can argue that if he had<br/>\ntried to get support first, he may have missed his<br/>\nchance, or even risked being found out, but the fact<br/>\nremains that he acted first, thought later. <br/>\n<br/>\n Mitsuhide was counting on both of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; these generals <br/>\n&gt; being tied down in campaigns, and in the case of<br/>\n&gt; Katsuie (who was <br/>\n&gt; delayed due to his campaign in Etchu) he was at<br/>\n&gt; least partially <br/>\n&gt; right.  However, upon learning of Nobunaga&#39;s death,<br/>\n&gt; Hideyoshi quickly <br/>\n&gt; concluded a peace treaty with the Mori and force<br/>\n&gt; marched on Kyoto. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not arguing that he could have anticipated<br/>\nHideyoshi&#39;s moves--Hideyoshi&#39;s peace with the Mori and<br/>\nsubsequent march was nothing short of amazing.<br/>\nHowever, even if Hideyoshi had been held up longer by<br/>\nthe Mori, Mitsuhide needed to get the daimyo of<br/>\ncentral Japan under his leadership, and quickly. He<br/>\ndidn&#39;t. Once Nobunaga and Nobutada were dead, it was<br/>\nas if he didn&#39;t know what to do next. Sacking Azuchi<br/>\nappears to me like he had nothing else in mind. Azuchi<br/>\nwasn&#39;t important, except possibly as a symbol. Symbols<br/>\ncould be dealt with later--what was important was<br/>\nfinding and killing Ieyasu, solidifying Hosokawa,<br/>\nTsuitsui, Takayama, and Niwa&#39;s support, and preparing<br/>\nfor the eventual attack of either Shibata or<br/>\nHideyoshi, whichever came first. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But Mitsuhide&#39;s lack of success was not for lack of<br/>\n&gt; planning or <br/>\n&gt; effort.  He did, in fact, court both the Mori as<br/>\n&gt; well as the Tokugawa <br/>\n&gt; clans.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It was a masterful plan to eliminate his tormentor. It<br/>\nwas nowhere near sufficient to take his place. Had<br/>\nthat been his motive, he would have made moves long<br/>\nbefore to secure support. He didn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, to tell the truth, I do find it a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; little odd that the <br/>\n&gt; Mori were content to abide by the treaty they signed<br/>\n&gt; with Hideyoshi <br/>\n&gt; when it was clear that they would very likely have<br/>\n&gt; been able to at <br/>\n&gt; the least reverse their losses over the previous<br/>\n&gt; four or five years.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps. But I think the Mori were content to keep<br/>\nwhat they had because they were exhausted by<br/>\nHideyoshi. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The Tokugawa would become embroiled in conflict with<br/>\n&gt; Hideyoshi <br/>\n&gt; subsequent to Mitsuhide and Katsuie&#39;s fall.  Which<br/>\n&gt; again does not <br/>\n&gt; entirely make sense from a strategic point of view. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why not? Hideyoshi&#39;s position at Nagakute wasn&#39;t<br/>\noverwhelmingly commanding. With a little luck and some<br/>\nexceptional diplomacy, Ieyasu could have possibly<br/>\novercome Hideyoshi. His appeals to the Chosokabe and<br/>\nMori simply didn&#39;t work out. Ieyasu was as important<br/>\nto Hideyoshi&#39;s success as he was to Nobunaga&#39;s--born<br/>\nout by the fact that Hideyoshi had to offer up the<br/>\nKanto to him. <br/>\n<br/>\n Nevertheless,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; though he was never <br/>\n&gt; actually defeated by Hideyoshi, Ieyasu was, in the<br/>\n&gt; end, forced to <br/>\n&gt; make peace on the latter&#39;s terms due both to the<br/>\n&gt; ineptitude of Nobuo <br/>\n&gt; as well as Hideyoshi&#39;s sizeable advantage in<br/>\n&gt; resources and men. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I won&#39;t argue Nobuo&#39;s ineptitude. <br/>\n<br/>\n Had <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ieyasu allied with Katsuie or for that matter even<br/>\n&gt; with Mitsuhide he <br/>\n&gt; would likely have been able to forestall the rise of<br/>\n&gt; Hideyoshi to <br/>\n&gt; supremacy in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now THIS is an interesting what if. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, back to the main point: it boils down to 2<br/>\noptions. Either Mitsuhide revolted and attacked<br/>\nNobunaga for the express purpose of killing Nobunaga<br/>\nout of accumulated torment, or he attacked the most<br/>\npowerful man in Japan in order to supplant him. If<br/>\nit&#39;s option 1, he was wildly successful. If it&#39;s<br/>\noption 2, he&#39;s a pathetic failure. Mitsuhide wasn&#39;t<br/>\nincompetent (if anything at times he was TOO competent<br/>\nfor Nobunaga&#39;s tastes), so my opinion is that his sole<br/>\nfocus was revenge on Nobunaga for the hell he had been<br/>\nput through. Only afterward was there thought of what<br/>\nto do afterwards, and the possibility of supplanting<br/>\nhim. <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!

In the end <br/>\nneither clan committed to the cause of an isolated lord who was now <br/>\ninfamous for murdering his master.  Naturally, the fact that both <br/>\nHideyoshi as well as Shibata Katsuie (both commanding greater <br/>\nresources and larger armies than the Akechi) were bound to attempt to <br/>\ndestroy Nobunaga&#39;s murderer as a first step to gaining a preeminent <br/>\nposition in the Oda domains would make lesser daimyo hesitant to ally <br/>\nwith Mitsuhide.  Mitsuhide was counting on both of these generals <br/>\nbeing tied down in campaigns, and in the case of Katsuie (who was <br/>\ndelayed due to his campaign in Etchu) he was at least partially <br/>\nright.  However, upon learning of Nobunaga&#39;s death, Hideyoshi quickly <br/>\nconcluded a peace treaty with the Mori and force marched on Kyoto.  <br/>\nIn essence, Mitsuhide was frustrated on two fronts, he was unable to <br/>\nfind allies and his time horizon narrowed much more rapidly than he <br/>\nhad expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Mitsuhide&#39;s lack of success was not for lack of planning or <br/>\neffort.

Which again does not <br/>\nentirely make sense from a strategic point of view.

However, understand my frustration when every<br/>\nElectronic Samurai who playes Onimusha 47 and thinks<br/>\nAkechi Samanosuke is some major, important person,<br/>\ncomes here wants information on him when very little<br/>\nexists. He&#39;s irrelevant. Not important. A Nobody.<br/>\n&quot;Third guy from left&quot; in the credits of the Sengoku<br/>\nera. <br/>\n<br/>\n   I mean, is not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nobunaga looked upon as a great <br/>\n&gt; figure in Japanese history?  Seriously, I&#39;m asking. <br/>\n&gt; How is Akechi Mitsuhide viewed <br/>\n&gt; in relation to the man he brought down from the<br/>\n&gt; Japanese point of view?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on who you ask, of course. Most sane people<br/>\nview Nobunaga as a man with tons of ambition, who<br/>\nwanted to solidify control of Japan and didn&#39;t let<br/>\nanything, including accepted moral standards or<br/>\nexpected behaviours, stand in his way. He&#39;s a classic<br/>\ncase of &quot;Ends justifies the means&quot;, and MOST people<br/>\naccept that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMitsuhide is equally complex. Some view him as the<br/>\narchetypal traitor, others view him as the only person<br/>\nwith the courage to stand up to a bullying tyrant. I<br/>\nthink he&#39;s a poor, pathetic man, a tactical genius,<br/>\nbut one who simply got pushed too far by his lord&#39;s<br/>\ntreatment of him, and who went over the edge,<br/>\nmentally. He reacted emotionally, without thorough<br/>\nplanning and solidifying a base, and so was swallowed<br/>\nup by history when Hideyoshi came and defeated him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The other guys?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ankokuji Ekei, Saiga (Saigo) Magoichi and Fuma<br/>\n&gt; Kotaro?  There isn&#39;t much more <br/>\n&gt; on them.  If ANY.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, there is plenty on Ankokuji Ekei, at least. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd besides, every one of the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; real-life characters in the <br/>\n&gt; Onimusha game -- including Samanosuke and Mori<br/>\n&gt; Ranmaru -- were dead before Yagyu <br/>\n&gt; Jubei was BORN!  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is why I hate it when people play these games,<br/>\nand then try to equate it to historical knowledge.<br/>\nThis is the same problem I have with Rurouni<br/>\nKenshin--IT&#39;S NOT REAL. No matter how &quot;realistic&quot; any<br/>\nof this may be, it&#39;s simply NOT. Put down your XBOX<br/>\ncontroller and pick up a history book, PLEASE. Don&#39;t<br/>\nget me wrong--nothing is inherently wrong with these<br/>\ngames, or anime. But dammit, they ain&#39;t history. If<br/>\nyou do a Google search on &quot;Akechi Samanosuke&quot; and<br/>\n99.9% of the hits come up as references to a video<br/>\ngame, that ought to give you a clue that a. he&#39;s not<br/>\nreal, or b. if he is real, he wasn&#39;t that darn<br/>\nimportant. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nTake Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1910118820\">In a message dated 10/6/2004 7:10:51 PM Eastern Daylight Time, referring to <br/>\nHidemitsu Samanosuke Akechi, Thus Sprach Nate:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What in the hell possessed them to use some nobody like this guy? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>       That&#39;s PRECISELY why they used him!  Because there IS nothing on him.  <br/>\nLet me ask for the sake of asking: Which is easier to make a hero: A nobody <br/>\non whom there is little to no information where there is freedom to draw a <br/>\ncharacter or a well-known personage whose history is well-known and whose every <br/>\nlittle iota would be scrutinized indefinitely?  I think it was easier for them <br/>\nto turn Nobunaga to a villain than it would have been to portray Mitsuhide as <br/>\nthe hero, despite his bit part toward the end of the third game.<br/>\n       Making Nobunaga or Kinoshita Tokichiro (the then-future Toyotomi plays <br/>\na monkey-like henchman in the first two games and makes only a brief <br/>\nappearance at the very, very end of the post-credit movies of the third as Toyotomi) <br/>\nthe hero would have defeated the game out of the blocks.  Producer Inafune <br/>\nKeiji&#39;s stated goal in an interview with BradyGames after the second game was to <br/>\nportray the lesser-known (or accepted) and -- shall we say -- not quite so <br/>\nhonourable side of Nobunaga.  I mean, is not Nobunaga looked upon as a great <br/>\nfigure in Japanese history?  Seriously, I&#39;m asking.  How is Akechi Mitsuhide viewed <br/>\nin relation to the man he brought down from the Japanese point of view?<br/>\n       Another name -- Mori Ranmaru -- was brought in as Nobunaga&#39;s top <br/>\nhenchman for the third game.  But he is really the only other recognizable name in <br/>\neither game.<br/>\n       The middle game (Onimusha: Samurai&#39;s Destiny) had not one but FOUR <br/>\nnobodies or lesser-lights in possible big roles including Yagyu Jubei -- pulled <br/>\nfrom his time period (1605?-16??) -- as the hero.  I&#39;ve found a TOTAL of ONE <br/>\ndecent article on him, though respected swordsman he may have been.  The heroine <br/>\nin that game -- Oyu -- turned out to be O-ichi, Nobunaga&#39;s sister, the only <br/>\nreally recognizable name apart from Tokichiro and Nobunaga.  The other guys?  <br/>\nAnkokuji Ekei, Saiga (Saigo) Magoichi and Fuma Kotaro?  There isn&#39;t much more <br/>\non them.  If ANY.  And besides, every one of the real-life characters in the <br/>\nOnimusha game -- including Samanosuke and Mori Ranmaru -- were dead before Yagyu <br/>\nJubei was BORN!  Some for more than 30 years!  (Asai Nagamasa is referenced <br/>\nonly a couple of times in the game, and Shibata Katsuie not at all.)  A derth <br/>\nof nobodies probably accounts for his use.  I think the second game is the best <br/>\nin the series, and I do NOT think, despite Inafune Keiji&#39;s comments, that <br/>\nOnimusha 3: Demon Seige will be the last chapter we&#39;ll see in the Onimusha <br/>\nseries.<br/>\n       Some may remember my question to Tony sometime ago about a possible <br/>\nalt-history romance starring O-ichi.  Onimusha 2: Samurai&#39;s Destiny was the <br/>\ninspiration for that question.<br/>\n       Anyway, enough mindless prating for now.  :-)  Take care, y&#39;all.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nL8r<br/>\nTim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
