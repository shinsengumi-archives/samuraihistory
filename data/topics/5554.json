            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2103893657\">Swords as Status in Old Japan<br/>\nNYTimes.com<br/>\n<br/>\nBy WENDY MOONAN<br/>\n<br/>\nPublished: September 17, 2004<br/>\n<br/>\nTe sales of Asian art are about to begin in New York, with previews <br/>\nthis weekend of Chinese, Japanese and Korean works at Sotheby&#39;s and <br/>\nChristie&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristie&#39;s auction of Japanese art on Wednesday has two highlights <br/>\nworth seeing during the viewings. One is a pair of 17th-century <br/>\nJapanese six-panel screens that depict the Portuguese on their ships <br/>\nas they are approaching Japan. The Japanese found the foreigners <br/>\nstrange; they are depicted with red hair, bulging eyes and huge <br/>\nnoses. This cross-cultural art, known as Namban in Japan, is always <br/>\nworth a look, if only to see how Westerners were viewed when first <br/>\nencountered.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristie&#39;s is also selling an entire set of Noh theater masks and <br/>\nrobes from an Edo-period (1615-1868) collection. They belonged to a <br/>\nlord from Yamanouchi Province. Any would-be producers could pick up <br/>\nenough masks and costumes at this sale to supply an entire Noh <br/>\ntroupe. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany galleries plan exhibitions to coincide with the auctions, and <br/>\nthe most astonishing show of Japanese work may be the elaborate <br/>\nJapanese sword fittings at Sebastian Izzard Asian Fine Art, at 17 <br/>\nEast 76th Street in Manhattan, from Tuesday through Sept. 30. The <br/>\nprotectors are beaten, patinated, lacquered and adorned with golden <br/>\nfigures from famous Japanese war stories. The workmanship makes <br/>\nFabergé look almost amateur.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sword fittings are from the collection of Alexander G. Moslé, a <br/>\nGerman businessman who worked in Japan from 1884 to 1907. As the <br/>\nrepresentative of the Gruson Company, a subsidiary of Krupp Steel, <br/>\nMoslé was able to persuade the Japanese government to switch from <br/>\nFrench to German arms just as Japan was asserting itself as a <br/>\nmilitary power. (The first Sino-Japanese War was in 1894-95 and the <br/>\nRusso-Japanese War in 1904-05.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe arms trade made Moslé wealthy; at one point he had 2,249 <br/>\nJapanese swords, armor, more than 1,600 sword fittings, Japanese <br/>\npaintings, prints, sculptures, ceramics, lacquer and textiles. Moslé <br/>\nretired in 1907 and returned to Germany, working with scholars and <br/>\ndealers to learn more about his collection. In 1909 he exhibited it <br/>\nat the Königliches Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin. It was published <br/>\nin two catalogs in 1914, which are still considered important <br/>\nreference works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the late 1920&#39;s, Moslé traveled to the United States to try to <br/>\nsell his collection to public institutions. He did sell some prints <br/>\nto the Art Institute of Chicago and some lacquers to the Freer <br/>\nGallery of Art in Washington, but, apparently, little more. He was <br/>\nin the United States in 1941, when America went to war, and was <br/>\nstranded here. Sometime before his death in 1949, he entered a <br/>\nmental institution.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis bank organized a sale of his Japanese works at Parke-Bernet in <br/>\nNew York in 1948, including the fittings in this sale. These 170 <br/>\nworks have been in private hands since that earlier sale. They <br/>\ninclude simple designs made of iron and ceremonial sets embellished <br/>\nwith gold, silver and copper. They range in price from a few <br/>\nthousand to a few hundred thousand dollars apiece.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not easy for Americans to appreciate the importance of swords <br/>\nin pre-20th-century Japan. Beginning in feudal times, Japanese <br/>\nwarlords equipped their armies with razor-sharp swords and fancy <br/>\nsword fittings.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;During the Edo period, a time of peace, swords were worn as status <br/>\nsymbols,&quot; said Mr. Izzard, who was the head of the Japanese and <br/>\nKorean art department at Christie&#39;s from 1980 to 1997. &quot;Craft <br/>\nschools specializing in sword fittings emerged, each with its own <br/>\ntraditions and styles.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai wore their swords in public, a symbol of class and honor. A <br/>\nsamurai might choose quiet, subdued fittings to wear at a high <br/>\ngovernmental occasion or something more flamboyant for a more casual <br/>\nevent, much as women wear their jewels today. In 1876 the emperor <br/>\nMeiji banned the wearing of swords in public as part of his <br/>\nmodernization campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What were once wearable symbols of wealth, prestige or entitlement <br/>\nbecame relics that illustrated 600 years of designs by some of the <br/>\nworld&#39;s finest metalworkers,&quot; Mr. Izzard said. &quot;Collecting swords <br/>\nand their fittings quickly became popular in Japan and the West. Mosl<br/>\né&#39;s tenure in Japan coincided with the wave of interest in Japanese <br/>\nart among Westerners, who were intrigued by the recently opened <br/>\ncountry and its culture.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nJaponisme swept over Europe and America, influencing artists, <br/>\nfurniture and textile designers and metalworkers. Mr. Moslé was in <br/>\nthe right place at the right time. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, <br/>\nthe Brooklyn Museum and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum all <br/>\nhave Japanese metalwork in their collections, some from the same <br/>\nperiod. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany of Mr. Izzard&#39;s sword fittings come in beautifully lacquered <br/>\nboxes that may have been commissioned by Mr. Moslé; they are works <br/>\nof art in themselves. Sword fittings are ardently collected by <br/>\nconnoisseurs of Japanese art, so it is worth seeing Mr. Moslé&#39;s <br/>\ncollection before it is dispersed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoyle New York will not have its Chinese porcelain auction until <br/>\nOct. 27, but from Monday through next Friday the auction house is <br/>\nscheduling previews by appointment for 60 lots of Chinese blue and <br/>\nwhite porcelain from the Kangxi period (1662-1722) from the Ralph <br/>\nSpencer Collection. (Information: Andrea Blunck Frost, Doyle&#39;s Asian <br/>\nart expert, 212-427-4141.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Spencer assembled his collection in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s on trips <br/>\nto London and at prominent Manhattan galleries like Chait. He was a <br/>\ncontemporary, and collecting rival, of <br/>\n<br/>\nF. Gordon Morrill, whose Chinese porcelain collection Doyle sold <br/>\nlast September for $12 million. (Morrill&#39;s rare Yuan dynasty pilgrim <br/>\nflask, circa 1345, sold for $5.8 million, a world auction record for <br/>\na piece of Chinese porcelain.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Spencer Collection, which is later in date, is expected to earn <br/>\nabout $300,000. <br/>\n<br/>\nPhiladelphia Curator<br/>\n<br/>\nAnne d&#39;Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, <br/>\nhas announced the appointment of David L. Barquist as curator of <br/>\nAmerican decorative arts, beginning in January. Mr. Barquist has <br/>\nbeen acting curator of American decorative arts at the Yale <br/>\nUniversity Art Gallery, where he began his career as an intern in <br/>\n1981.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn authority on American silver, Mr. Barquist is the author of &quot;Myer <br/>\nMyers: Jewish Silversmith in Colonial New York&quot; and &quot;American and <br/>\nEnglish Pewter at the Yale University Art Gallery.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Philadelphia collections are extraordinary, but the museum is <br/>\nregionally focused,&quot; Mr. Barquist said in an interview. &quot;In trying <br/>\nto present the story of American decorative arts, there are a few <br/>\nholes one would try to fill judiciously. We need a few carefully <br/>\nchosen examples of works from places like Boston to play off of the <br/>\nmuseum&#39;s collections.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/17/arts/design/17ANTI.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/17/arts/design/17ANTI.html</a></div>",
