Its a short work on Uesugi Kenshin. The writer also penned a book<br/>\non Takeda Shingen (Samurai Heroes 1?) and was going to write one on II<br/>\nNaomasa. Does anyone have any info on these books and the writer,<br/>\nespecially where I can find these books. Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\nWilliam,<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three are available and I have them.<br/>\nEach one is progressively better in terms of content and include colour<br/>\nsections with Mon.<br/>\nThat said, all three are excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo Dragons (who also produce a fine range of 15mm miniatures) are<br/>\ninvolved in the process and will be producing more at a later stage.<br/>\nThe author also wrote some articles for Wargames Illustrated a number of<br/>\nyears ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several sources in the UK who stock these booklets but I am<br/>\nnot sure if they had web sites (I cannot find a reference anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnsure about the rest of the world from stocking point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever if you want to drop me a mail off line<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rob@...\">rob@...</a>) I am sure we can come to some arrangement<br/>\nand I can send you the books in exchange for some thing I cannot easily<br/>\nget in the UK.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a point of reference the authors of Killer Katanas wargame rule set<br/>\nalso produce some similar style booklets and these cover the Mori,<br/>\nShimazu, Date, Tokugawa, Hideyoshi with Hojo to come.<br/>\nThese have a brief detail of the clan, and features on two battles, with<br/>\n(obviously) a focus on replaying the battle using KK rules.<br/>\nThey are also good value for money even though I do not play the game<br/>\nitself. (I do have the rules and more wargames figures than most sane<br/>\npeople can imagine!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n-- <br/>\nrob broom</div>",
