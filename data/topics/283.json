            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1436106088\">|The problem I have with the field of<br/>\n| Japanese historiograpy is that there are few (very few) well written<br/>\n| narrative histories like the type done by say Robert Massie, Simon Schama,<br/>\n| David McCollough, or Stephan Ambrose. While I*am*not a historian I do love<br/>\na<br/>\n| good book on history.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I see a couple of reasons for this.  One, you don&#39;t have as many people<br/>\ntrained in Japanese history in the West as say European or American history.<br/>\nYour pool of potential writers is much smaller.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, for the authors you list above, while writing good introductory<br/>\nbooks, these would not necessarily make tenure committees or promotion<br/>\ncommittees happy.  In fact, one could advance the thesis that the more<br/>\npopular and well received a non-fiction book is by<br/>\nthe general public, the less academics will like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, is there a market for books as you want on medieval Japanese history?<br/>\nPublishing is a money making enterprise and most publishers seem to shy away<br/>\nfrom books that don&#39;t sell well over 10,000 copies.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, Mark Hall</div>",
