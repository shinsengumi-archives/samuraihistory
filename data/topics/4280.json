I&#39;d like to try to do something else for <br/>\na change of pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1877 Saigö Takamori led his remaining 40 samurai (which once <br/>\nnumbered over 12,000) against the new Japanese Imperial army and <br/>\ninto the movies in 2003.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japanese Imperial army of that period was dressed in French <br/>\nGarde Mobile style uniforms. Japanese infantrymen wore a dark blue <br/>\nkepi, a short jacket with French style field pack, and dark blue <br/>\npants. The cavalry wore red kepis with a small white plume in the <br/>\nfront, dark blue jackets, red pants with a yellow stripe, and black <br/>\nboots. Their lance pennants were red over white.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you recommend for 28mm figures to represent the Japanese <br/>\nImperial army? I&#39;d like to build this army to fight against my <br/>\nexisting samurai army. It would be an interesting game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; My first thought would be to suggest some of the foundry ranges, to see<br/>\nif anything can be converted but Old Glory would also be well worth checking<br/>\nout. I am sure its possible to convert the miniatures if no range is aleady<br/>\navailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has been &quot;talk&quot; from several companies of them doing a range and there<br/>\nmay be other companies who have something more suitable availalbe already,<br/>\ncheck the internet or wargames press.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a book on the period at home which is excellant and contains a lot of<br/>\ndetail so the reference material is available if a company decided to do a<br/>\nrange, and I am sure someone will, movies tend to have that knock on effect!<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies that the information is not that helpful but I will do some more<br/>\ninvestigation as I get time during the week, and see if I can find out if a<br/>\nspecific range is out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat manufacturers do you use for your existing Samurai army?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\nRob Broom<br/>\nWarhammer Historical General Manager<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robb@...\">robb@...</a><br/>\nwww.warhammer-historical.com</div>",

He was <br/>\nunavailable and a friend of his was asked to confirm the name that <br/>\nshould be used on the certificate. The friend misremembered the name <br/>\nand gave the father&#39;s name instead: &quot;Saigo Takamori&quot;. This was <br/>\nprobably due to the fact that given names were hardly used. If a <br/>\n&quot;name&quot; was used at all (instead of a title) it was probably a <br/>\nnickname. Saigo&#39;s nickname was &quot;Kichi-no-suke&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Saigo got the (incorrect) certificate, he apparently just went <br/>\nwith the flow and from then on used &quot;Takamori&quot; instead of his given <br/>\nname, Takanaga.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a></div>",
