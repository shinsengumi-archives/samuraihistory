I have even read somewhere <br/>\n&gt;(but not sure, perhaps the experts of this list can confirm) that <br/>\n&gt;Nobunaga wore a Portuguese armor, at times. <br/>\n&gt;2 - Nobunaga hated organized Buddhism, not the religion or the <br/>\n&gt;philosophy, but the &quot;Buddhist posse&quot; (the ikki). Christianity was thus <br/>\n&gt;a convenient &#39;alternative.&#39; <br/>\n&gt;I really doubt Nobunaga was interested in the Christian ideals, <br/>\n&gt;nonetheless he seemed to have an interest for things from the West, <br/>\n&gt;especially if they could give him a political-ideological or martial <br/>\n&gt;advantage. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;cepo <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nVoce quer um iGMail protegido contra v�rus e spams? <br/>\nClique aqui: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\">http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br</a><br/>\nOfertas imperd�veis!

Anyone who betrayed him, plotted against him, or threatened his<br/>\n&gt;position was no longer to be trusted, and needed to be dealt with.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately I think you&#39;ve missed my point. Maybe I didn&#39;t do a <br/>\nvery good job of explaining it. I hope that I did not say that <br/>\n&quot;Nobunaga did not demand loyalty or duty&quot;. What I meant to say is that <br/>\nhe did not practice it himself, either to his betters or to his own <br/>\nvassals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Rather pragmatic, really.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. However it is often pointed out that Nobunaga was this <br/>\nway to a much higher degree than most of his contemporaries. So <br/>\nwhile it may be pragmatic it wasn&#39;t that common.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; This is not the sense of &quot;duty&quot; that is meant in Japan. Duty (in the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; honorable, admirable sense) is not to a cause, but to a person of <br/>\n&gt;&gt; autority, or one could say to a structure. Duty to one&#39;s own goal of <br/>\n&gt;&gt; unifying Japan is not in and of itself an admirable trait that would <br/>\n&gt;&gt; go down well in the annals of history.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not if one sees the unification as something that needs to be done, and one <br/>\n&gt;sees<br/>\n&gt;oneself as the only one who can do it. It&#39;s the whole &quot;duty to a higher cause&quot;<br/>\n&gt;thing. Ambition can figure into it, but there&#39;s a duty to one&#39;s vision.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is incorrect in the context of the discussion. It implies that <br/>\nduty can somehow be judged based on one&#39;s own personal opinions of <br/>\nwhat ought to be done. This is not how duty works, at least not in the <br/>\nJapanese aethetic. You don&#39;t get to pick your duty. That is the very <br/>\nessense of the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear I understand what you&#39;re saying and I agree that this <br/>\nsense of purpose was what propelled Nobunaga (and I said as much in a <br/>\npart of my message that you&#39;ve chosen not to quote) . But again, <br/>\nrecall the context of this discussion. The messase I was replying to <br/>\nsomehow said that Nobunaga&#39;s sense of duty is what makes him such a <br/>\npopular figure in Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I simply disagree with that assessment. This sense of &quot;duty to <br/>\none&#39;s own vision&quot; is not -- in Japan -- the kind of trait that would <br/>\nbe admired and would explain why Nobunaga has become such a grand <br/>\nfigure in Japan. Duty in the sense of 義理 or 義務 would have <br/>\nexplained it, but not &quot;duty&quot; to one&#39;s vision. This &quot;being true to <br/>\none&#39;s own self&quot; is called wagamama 吾がまま in Japan and it is almost <br/>\nthe oposite of admirable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I agree about the unfortunate temptation to compare with Hitler. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s quite banal. But I would also caution that Nobunaga did kill more <br/>\n&gt;&gt; than &quot;those who were in his way&quot;. He was ruthless and certainly <br/>\n&gt;&gt; over the top on more than one occasion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;True. But it discouraged a lot more outbreaks. It&#39;s a rather bloody version of<br/>\n&gt;the &quot;breaking eggs to make omelettes&quot; thing, with a little bit of &quot;pour<br/>\n&gt;encourager les autres&quot; as well. You wipe out a village or two now and five <br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt;villages down the line will think twice about rising.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>100% agree. My overall point is that people tend to exaggerate <br/>\ntheir 信長像 one way or the other. Either they have this &quot;Nobunaga as <br/>\nblood-sucking vampire&quot; image or the have this &quot;everything he did was <br/>\nperfectly normal for his day and age&quot; image. Both are incorrect. He <br/>\nwas not a blood-sucking vampire, but then again some of his actions <br/>\nwere seen as atrocious even at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; There are volumes and volumes written about this one incident.

It&#39;s a rather bloody version of<br/>\nthe &quot;breaking eggs to make omelettes&quot; thing, with a little bit of &quot;pour<br/>\nencourager les autres&quot; as well. You wipe out a village or two now and five other<br/>\nvillages down the line will think twice about rising.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s telling that the thing that did Nobunaga in was betrayal and treason rather<br/>\nthan an outside enemy.

Nobunaga&#39;s efforts were neither for <br/>\ngood nor for evil. He did what he did out of sheer personal ambition <br/>\nand his sense of his place in the order of things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a bloodshed, but what emerged at its end (the Tokugawa Shogunate) <br/>\n&gt;formed the basis for modern Japan and guaranteed 250+ years of relative <br/>\n&gt;peace.

So, the unification was a good thing for Japan, I would <br/>\n&gt;say.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with this. Nobunaga&#39;s place in Japanese history comes, at <br/>\nleast in part, because he is seen as having kicked off the process <br/>\nof ending the old order and bringing together the new order. His <br/>\nrole in the thing - whatever his motive - has been to put the nail in <br/>\nthe coffin of the old way, and to set the wheels in motion for <br/>\nTokugawa to finally pacify the country. He is seen as the terrible <br/>\ndestroyer and the mighty creator - a powerful, aweful, awesome man who <br/>\nit is almost impossible to believe actually existed. It seems like <br/>\na fictional story. His impact on the direction of Japan is impossible <br/>\nto measure.

This is not the case, <br/>\neither in the past or now. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It is not in videogames or in manga, and anime... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, it is. Obviously. That&#39;s where the whole conversation got <br/>\nstarted. Plus it is seen in at least one &quot;cult movie&quot; as you have <br/>\ntaught me (see below).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Some parents still tell nobunaga tales to scare ill behaved children at <br/>\n&gt;Japan, and he is an very used character in some occult movies such as <br/>\n&gt;Kujaku-Ou! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. Of course I can&#39;t deny that some parents somewhere <br/>\nmight &quot;tell nobunaga stories&quot;. But if they do I&#39;ve never heard <br/>\nof it. It is certainly not a common practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never heard of Kujaku-Ou. Anyway if the &quot;Nobuanga as villain&quot; <br/>\ntheme is used in this movies and others like it, it exactly fits my <br/>\npoint -- these are examples of this theme being used in very light <br/>\nentertainment or pop culture.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And HEROIC is the tales about those brave ninjas who exterminated the <br/>\n&gt;bastard! <br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a different use of the word heroic that is outside of the <br/>\nscope of the current conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Nobunaga had the vicious addiction to do genocide against buddhist temples <br/>\n&gt;and against vilages near those temples, and killed and maimed many just <br/>\n&gt;because they dwelt near those temples, until he decided to mess with the <br/>\n&gt;vilages inside the Iiga mountain... *a very big grim*... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This paragraph again exactly illustrates my point. This is a western, <br/>\nmodern way of viewing what Nobunaga did.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The rest of the history<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a></div>",

His <br/>\nmore over-the-top things that in our day and age are quite shocking, <br/>\nwere even shocking when they happened.
