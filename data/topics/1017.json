            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-971671647\">A friend of mine has put together an extensive online Japanese Language database ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jdictionary.com\">http://www.jdictionary.com</a> )that includes a japanese text translator, a japanese english - english japanese dictionary as well as a complete list of &#39;level 2&#39; kanji for the level 2 japanese language proficiency exam - you can also mark kanji to add to a &#39;study list&#39;.  In the future he is considering allowing people to have &#39;login names&#39; to save your personal study lists. As it is right now, I think you lose your list if you close your browser.  This is what is &#39;in the works&#39; in addition to what is already there:<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a quiz mode for each list that drills you on the common jukugo and kunyomi. <br/>\nAllow user to save their study lists to retrieve at a later date. <br/>\nAllow user to create multiple study lists and sort them by name. <br/>\nCreate a version of this tool that is an all purpose kanji lookup tool that queries all Joyou kanji.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would be a very valuable resource for anyone studying Japanese.<br/>\n(you need japanese fonts installed in your browser to fully utilize the site)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jdictionary.com\">http://www.jdictionary.com</a></div>",
