            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-587976902\">The Charlotte Observer<br/>\nIn &#39;Samurai,&#39; a master of swords loses his grip<br/>\nPosted on Fri, Sep. 24, 2004<br/>\nStory of dogged family man at end of humble career will touch you<br/>\n<br/>\nLAWRENCE TOPPMAN<br/>\n<br/>\nMovie Critic<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Twilight Samurai&quot; must be the first film about a martial artist <br/>\nwhere nobody raises a sword for 45 minutes. It offers only one <br/>\nextended duel: bloody and stumbling, full of accidental mishaps, <br/>\nprobably very much like a swordfight would really be. This quiet, <br/>\nexpressive Oscar nominee for best foreign film is a character study, <br/>\nand the Japanese title -- &quot;Tasogare Seibei,&quot; or &quot;Twilight Seibei&quot; -- <br/>\ndescribes it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the nickname given to widower Seibei Iguchi (Hiroyuki Sanada) <br/>\nby his co-workers in the storehouse of a Japanese warlord: When they <br/>\ngo out for drinks at dusk, he rushes home to two young daughters and <br/>\na mother with Alzheimer&#39;s disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nickname applies to him for two other reasons. He&#39;s in the <br/>\ntwilight of his career as a fighter, having lost the fire that made <br/>\nhim instructor in a famous dojo, and the twilight of the samurai era <br/>\nhas settled upon Japan in the 1860s. A scene where the warlord&#39;s <br/>\nminions comically deal with new rifles gives Iguchi a grim clue to <br/>\nthe future of swordsmen like himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this smells like &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; fear not: No iron-jawed <br/>\nAmerican sails in to save the day, and director Yoji Yamada doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmake grand Hollywood gestures. (Coincidentally, Sanada appeared <br/>\nin &quot;Last Samurai&quot; as Ujio, a short-lived battler.) Yamada wrote <br/>\nthe &quot;Twilight Samurai&quot; script with Yoshitaka Asama, adapting stories <br/>\nby Shuhei Fujisawa, and they entwine a love story with a crisis of <br/>\nhonor and responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nIguchi, a self-described &quot;petty samurai&quot; at the bottom of the <br/>\nretainers&#39; pecking order, does his own housework, tends his small <br/>\nplot of land and builds insect cages to collect extra money. He <br/>\nbelieves no woman could joyfully share this life, including <br/>\nchildhood friend Tomoe Iinuma (Rie Miyazawa). Even after he protects <br/>\nher from a beating by a drunken ex-husband, Iguchi can&#39;t accept her <br/>\ngratitude or her brother&#39;s suggestion that they marry.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, his bosses find a use for his rusty skills. A great old <br/>\nswordfighter, unfairly blamed for a trumped-up &quot;failure&quot; and told to <br/>\ncommit ritual suicide, holes up in his house. Iguchi, once a master <br/>\nof the short sword, is ordered to storm that house and slay the <br/>\noffender. This troubles the ethical Iguchi, who can&#39;t decide <br/>\nbetween &quot;duty&quot; and the feeling that attacking this older man is <br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly Iguchi&#39;s character gets fully fleshed out, but we feel we know <br/>\nhim as well as any old friend: He&#39;s loyal yet slightly stubborn, <br/>\ngentle yet accomplished in destruction, humble about his deeds yet <br/>\nproud with the misguided pride of a poor man who has nothing else to <br/>\ncling to. Sanada gives an exceptionally detailed performance, <br/>\nshowing us new things even in his last scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYamada directs with stately confidence, going no faster than he has <br/>\nto but never letting us get bored. Even modest moments have payoffs: <br/>\nIguchi sharpens a sword at night, awakening his curious 5-year-old, <br/>\nor fishes with Tomoe&#39;s brother (Mitsuru Fukikoshi), until the <br/>\ncorpses of two starved peasants float past.<br/>\n<br/>\nYamada has spent most of his 40-year career directing the tales of <br/>\nTora-san, a vain but comically lovable drifter, through nearly four <br/>\ndozen films. With &quot;Samurai,&quot; faced at 71 with what may have been the <br/>\nmost challenging project of his career, he blossomed like a gnarled <br/>\ncherry tree exploding in flowers on the last day of spring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nREVIEW<br/>\n<br/>\nTwilight Samurai<br/>\n<br/>\nReflective, touching, intimate portrait of a samurai facing action <br/>\nin his waning years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTARS: Hiroyuki Sanada, Rie Miyazawa, Mitsuru Fukikoshi.<br/>\n<br/>\nDIRECTOR: Yoji Yamada.<br/>\n<br/>\nLENGTH: 129 minutes. Subtitled.<br/>\n<br/>\nRATING: NR (subdued violence).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.charlotte.com/mld/observer/entertainment/9746556.htm?1c\">http://www.charlotte.com/mld/observer/entertainment/9746556.htm?1c</a></div>",
