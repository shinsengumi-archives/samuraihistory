Rather than &quot;losing<br/>\nhonor&quot;, they were quickly used to &quot;win battles&quot; by<br/>\nmost daimyo. Granted, the use was mainly relegated to<br/>\nashigaru troops, but many important daimyo also<br/>\npractised with arquebuses, including Oda Nobunaga and<br/>\nTokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu was considered a better shot<br/>\nthan most of his retainers. <br/>\n<br/>\n As Perrin&#39;s book will tell you, the gun was phased<br/>\nout and the samurai sword mystique was<br/>\ncreated...whether it was part of a Tokugawa bakufu<br/>\nplot or not, I&#39;ll leave up to you. Keep in mind that<br/>\nthere was no open warfare for over 200 years, so what<br/>\nwas the use of guns? Samurai did not hesitate to use<br/>\nthem during the civil war. <br/>\n<br/>\nNate Ledbetter<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!

Tokugawa Ieyasu himself was <br/>\napparently a good shot (as much as it was possible to be) - but even if not=\r<br/>\n, he took time to learn how to use <br/>\nthe weapon and if it was OK by him it would have been okay by everyone. Com=\r<br/>\nbat samurai (pre 1600) were <br/>\nfar more pragmatic than the image we have today, and samurai honour, as a c=\r<br/>\node that was lived rather than <br/>\npaid lip-service, reached its lowest ebb just prior to the emergence of the=\r<br/>\n Oda/Hideyoshi/Tokugawa <br/>\ntriumvirate. In those days anything went, as long as you won. The emergence=\r<br/>\n of strong leaders and a unified <br/>\ncountry probably did most to bring about a restructuring of the warrior eth=\r<br/>\nic. The later Edo Jidai under <br/>\nTokugawa rule completely remodelled the ideals of the samurai, and that is =\r<br/>\nthe image commonly held today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are pictures of samurai using firearms (although not many tales), but=\r<br/>\n I think the honour ethic (which <br/>\nexisted as the exception, rather than the rule) was primarily based on the =\r<br/>\nsamurai&#39;s traditional weapons. The <br/>\nproblem with firearms is that the early models only really worked when used=\r<br/>\n en masse which made up for their <br/>\ninaccuracy, and a skilled individual warrior would have felt safer with a w=\r<br/>\neapon he could rely on, and you could <br/>\nnot really rely on an arquebus. Especially when battlefields often develope=\r<br/>\nd into chaotic close combat melées.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a samurai wanted to make a name for himself on the battlefield, the spea=\r<br/>\nr was the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
