I know a castle was built there after Mori <br/>\ntook control and that it was a center for fine pottery much later. I&#39;ve <br/>\nparsed all the official websites concerning Hagi, I think, but what I&#39;m <br/>\nreally looking for is a detailed map, preferably topographical, and <br/>\ninformation on the minor daimyo that controlled that area and any of the <br/>\noutlying areas of Nagato. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny information on Yamaguchi while Yoshitaka kept court there. Maps <br/>\npreferably. I found a great resource detailing Francis Xavier&#39;s time in <br/>\nYamaguchi (he actually left only a few weeks before Yoshitaka was <br/>\noverthrown). It had some specific info on Yamaguchi, but really need more <br/>\ndetail on the city in that era. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am aware of the work by Arnesen concerning the Ouchi rule of Nagato and <br/>\nSuo, but I haven&#39;t trucked down to the library to peruse that. I&#39;ve gotten <br/>\nsome information from that work through a third party, however. I have a <br/>\nfew of the Turnbull samurai books that shed a little light on that <br/>\nsituation as well. I also have parsed websites detailing the Mori clans <br/>\nactivities before and after Yoshitaka&#39;s fall, the few sites concerning <br/>\nHarukata and some other general information. I guess I&#39;m really looking <br/>\nmostly for obscure political information on that area and physical <br/>\ninformation on the land and towns. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. Anything you have, online preferably. Much appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRgB<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To become the enemy&quot; is to think yourself into into the enemy&#39;s position. <br/>\n-- Miyamoto Musashi</div>",
