We are<br/>\n&gt; familiar that banners or flags are used as a<br/>\n&gt; rallying point in a military charge or as a symbol<br/>\n&gt; of unity and solidarity.

Quite<br/>\n&gt; strange, isn�ft it?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, if it was the person&#39;s personal standard<br/>\n(uma-jirushi), then there is nothing odd about it at<br/>\nall. Personal standards were used by most well-known<br/>\ngenerals as a big &quot;I AM HERE&quot; marker, for both friend<br/>\nand foe to see. Hideyoshi used the golden gourd (be it<br/>\n1 or 1,000 is up to which version you read), Ieyasu<br/>\nused a golden fan, Nobunaga used an umbrella...but we<br/>\nalso have examples where generals used flags. Takeda<br/>\nKatsuyori used a big square flag with the character ��<br/>\n&quot;Dai&quot; on it. It&#39;s quite possible that this Toshitsugu<br/>\nhad a similiar uma-jirushi to identify his location to<br/>\nhis troops in battle. Of course, the flag description<br/>\n(Can the original person who asked the question post<br/>\nthe description of the flag, as it may help ID him)<br/>\nmay be a description of the sashimono his retainers<br/>\nwore, or of a personal sashimono he wore. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now I wonder if this Toshiaki is the same as<br/>\n&gt; Toshitugu, (I just hope so. Still I�fm aware that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I�fm<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; standing on a shaky ground.) But the Japanese<br/>\n&gt; already had a custom of changing their names so it<br/>\n&gt; might be probable that with some sleight of<br/>\n&gt; circumstance Toshiaki had been changed to Toshitogu.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s possible, but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s probable.<br/>\nYou could conjecture, with some certainty (51%<br/>\nanyways), that being as they both had the surname<br/>\nHonda, and the character &quot;Toshi&quot; in their given names,<br/>\nthat they were related. Beyond that, it&#39;s simply<br/>\nconjecture to say he was the same person, or the son,<br/>\nor father, or brother, or whomever. You can&#39;t get that<br/>\nout of the names. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (Still I�fm not very sure). I�fm not an expert of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Japanese language but I came to observe that<br/>\n&gt; Japanese words especially verbs changes their<br/>\n&gt; suffixes to change the form of tenses, sometimes to<br/>\n&gt; negate the affirmative word that are used in<br/>\n&gt; negative sentences. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Japanese naming<br/>\nconventions. You don&#39;t &quot;conjugate&quot; names. While it was<br/>\ncommon for Japanese of the period to change their<br/>\nnames (Kinoshita Tokichiro -- Kinoshita Hideyoshi --<br/>\nHashiba Hideyoshi --Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Matsudaira<br/>\nMotonobu -- Motoyasu -- Tokugawa Motoyasu -- Tokugawa<br/>\nIeyasu being the two most commonly known cases), it<br/>\nhad nothing to do with conjugating or negating prior<br/>\nmeanings. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a good introduction to naming, try here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany/miscellany.html\">http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany/miscellany.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow I went to the Japanese google, and tried a few<br/>\ndifferent combinations of Honda Toshitsugu.

The other was headed by Honda Masanobu, <br/>\nwho wasn&#39;t known as a great warrior (due to an illness he suffered <br/>\nduring his youth, I vaguely recall reading that this might have been <br/>\npolio, but I might be confusing that with Date Masamune), but <br/>\nMasanobu acted in a diplomatic and administrative role for the <br/>\nTokugawa. He was also known as a political schemer, but was very <br/>\nclose to Ieyasu, and later Hidetada. Another fairly vague <br/>\nrecollection I have is that the founder of Honda Motor Corp. was <br/>\ndescended from this branch of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI made my own search and net browsing about this Honda Toshitugu and found nothing about this name. Yeah, you are quite right; theres nothing about this person but only the flag. Is it not quite strange that the date and place of his birth is unknown but a flag or a banner that usually represent a group or a tribe, a clan and even a national identity is attached to this single person(perhaps a head of the family Im not really sure), yet nothing is recorded of him? We are familiar that banners or flags are used as a rallying point in a military charge or as a symbol of unity and solidarity. But the identity of the man linked with a flag had been neglected. Quite strange, isnt it?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSome in our group have already given their share with regard to this persona yet they still admit that the answers theyve provided are only tentative at best & dont really hit the target. Mine is also one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNaomasa mentioned already the two Hondas that served under the Tokugawa Ieasu. So this family may have been well known during the Edo period. Theres another Honda that also lived during this period; his name is Honda Toshiaki (born 1744 in Echiga province,died in Edo 1822). He is a mathematician & a scholar who advocated Western ideas and techniques to be adopted by the Japanese government. He studied the Dutch language that influenced him to become open-minded Japanese pertaining to other cultures especially Western cultures. (During that period Japan was in isolation and the only Western country they have in contact with is Holland or the Dutch). This Toshiaki is also interested in economics and his study of the relationships between food supply and the growth of population led him to the same conclusion as the English economist Thomas Malthus. He advocated many ideas prompting the Japanese government to end the isolation policy of the Tokugawa; improve their coastal defenses and<br/>\n the imperial expansion of Japan. He proposed many ideas to improve the economic status of Japan by utilizing many Western ideas and techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I wonder if this Toshiaki is the same as Toshitugu, (I just hope so. Still Im aware that Im standing on a shaky ground.) But the Japanese already had a custom of changing their names so it might be probable that with some sleight of circumstance Toshiaki had been changed to Toshitogu. (Still Im not very sure). Im not an expert of the Japanese language but I came to observe that Japanese words especially verbs changes their suffixes to change the form of tenses, sometimes to negate the affirmative word that are used in negative sentences. And Japanese names are not given haphazardly to individuals but that the character of the person or the character he is supposed to posses is closely linked with the appellations that are given to the person. We see this prevalent in many traditional cultures. Im only speaking in a general sense & claim no any expertise in this subject. Anyone who might have some linguistic background in analyzing this can please confirm or reject this<br/>\n proposition.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, at least; we are headed in the right direction. Honda may have been an illustrious family name. We can trace it back to the Edo period and perhaps even beyond, and that there are families of Hondas who served in the administration of the Shogun. The Honda mentioned by Naomasa whom he barely remembered as the founder of The Honda Motors Corporation is Honda Soichiro who may also have been connected to this family. By checking to the lineage of this family we may arrive to the identification of this Honda Toshitugu.       <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
