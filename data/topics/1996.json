I guess I do fall into<br/>\nthat camp that does not consider Kazu-uchi-mono true samurai swords from<br/>\nthe artistic sense. In my reply I took a rather narrow view for the sake<br/>\nof brevity. Actually Yasukuni-to was very much a factory operation also.<br/>\nI really considered these to be kind of historical anomalies. I loved the<br/>\nsuggestion of the Masamune decendant visit.

Many of these shops are open to the public, <br/>\nsince they are still playing on the reputation of being a center of <br/>\nsword production.

There are quite a few in the Tokyo<br/>\n&gt;area.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you travel to Kamakura on the &quot;Backside&quot; of Kamakura station is <br/>\nthe shop of the 24th generation Masamune swordsmith, Yamamura <br/>\nTsunahiro.

Also check out the <br/>\nEisei Bunka (Hosokawa family collection), Nezu Bijutsukan, Seikado <br/>\nbijutsukan and Sano Bijutsukan (in Mishima) for rotating exhibits of <br/>\nswords.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Also a place called Aoi<br/>\n&gt;art is right around the corner from the Sword museum it is a sword shop.<br/>\n&gt;They have a web site www.aoi-art.ab.psiweb.com/index.html they are<br/>\n&gt;retailers but may be able to arrange a tour for you.<br/>\n&gt;      Hope you enjoy your trip.

Its also a rather large company and they offer tours of the forging premises by appointment and I&#39;d like to find out more about that cuz it&#39;d be very sad to miss a blade forge in Japan...
