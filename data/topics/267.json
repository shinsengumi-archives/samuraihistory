            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1757526199\">Dear Fred,<br/>\n<br/>\nVery interesting discussion that you have started.  Don&#39;t have the resources <br/>\nat hand as I am new to Japan and have not overcome the many (mostly <br/>\nmonetary) obstacles to internet access as yet.  Therefore I am consigned to <br/>\na crowded (albeit free) internet cafe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any event, I believe that your instincts based on the information that <br/>\nyou have found -- or more rightly not found -- regarding samurai unarmed <br/>\ncombat training is on mark.  You make an excellent judgement in using the <br/>\nashigaru as an example.  Whenever we talk about warriors in Japan it <br/>\nbehooves us to make a distinction between the different social levels.  The <br/>\neveryday experience of the elite warriors (those holding court rank) and <br/>\nthose in the lower echelons could not have been more different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would assume that any martial training with weapons was done on one&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;own, and not through a &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or closest <br/>\n&gt;to the lord, who would receive sword training. Anyway, my point is that <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve never seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts training in the <br/>\n&gt;&#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This seems to have been true on the mass scale at least insofar as the <br/>\nSengoku period is concerned.  Things during the Tokugawa era are a bit <br/>\ndifferent, however.  In _Armed Martial Arts of Japan_, G. Cameron Hurst <br/>\nnotes that in the Tokugawa era we see the incorporation of separate schools <br/>\nof combat.  That is, we see &quot;masters&quot; hanging  out a shingle advertising <br/>\nthat they were teaching, for example, naginata skills.  This became <br/>\nincreasingly important as the warriors, separated from their historical <br/>\nprofessions by the peace engendered under the Tokugawa regime, needed to <br/>\nfind a way to make a living.  There were only so many opportunities to act <br/>\nas police or other government sanctioned positions.  A warrior who received <br/>\na certificate of transmission from a well-known sword (or other) master <br/>\ncould then hang out his own shingle and ply his trade as a teacher of that <br/>\nschool (or its offshoot).  In Hurst&#39;s book is also a detailed treatment of <br/>\nthe development of the ryuha system, primarily in the early 17th century.  <br/>\nAs in most eras of Japanese history, name and lineage were of vital <br/>\nimportance to martial arts practitioners, be they armed or unarmed, and as <br/>\nsuch well-known masters were sought after.  By way of example, in John <br/>\nRogers&#39; partial translation of the _Honcho Bugei Shoden_ which appeared in <br/>\nMonumenta Nipponica mention is made of one Ishido Chikurin who became the <br/>\nfounder of the Chikurin &quot;ha&quot; of the Heki-ryu lineage of Kyudo.  He became <br/>\nfamous for having won a tooshiya &quot;long-range shooting contest&quot; at <br/>\nSanjusangendo and subsequently was employed as archery teacher to (if memory <br/>\nserves) either Hideyoshi or Ieyasu.  &lt;-- I&#39;ll check on this when I get <br/>\nhome...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I digress...  As regards unarmed combat, I also am fairly curious as to <br/>\nthe percentages of samurai (of whichever social stratum) that practiced such <br/>\nthings (either doing the Sengoku or later through to 1800 or so).  One place <br/>\nto start a search may be to look into the concept of bugei juhappan.  These <br/>\nwere said to be the 18 important skills of a warrior.  I am not sure when <br/>\nthe term became current, but one place to look may be Karl Friday&#39;s _Legacy <br/>\nof the Sword_ which is an outstanding look at a &quot;complete&quot; warrior system.  <br/>\nRather than teaching, say, just iaido, their training encompasses many <br/>\ndifferent skills and, again if memory serves, unarmed skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fredjnsn@...\">fredjnsn@...</a><br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIndirectly on topic, but a question/comment nonetheless. . . In all<br/>\nmy years of reading and studying Japanese Samurai history, I have<br/>\nNEVER come accross anything even remotely resembling &#39;a group of<br/>\nsamurai practicing karate together in a dojo&#39; (quote is my own). I<br/>\nhave never seen any references to unarmed combat training, and don&#39;t<br/>\nsee much use for it anyway. The samurai studied weapons, which is<br/>\ncommon sense, of course. I don&#39;t believe (and this is opinion) that<br/>\neven &#39;powerful samurai families&#39; employed &#39;martial artists&#39; to teach<br/>\nthem unarmed combat. from my limited (6 years of martial arts<br/>\ntraining about 10 years ago or so - and my studying of martial arts<br/>\nhistory) is that unarmed combat originated in Okinawa, and at best<br/>\n200 - 300 years ago. I&#39;m sure that judo or jujitsu-like &#39;wrestling&#39;<br/>\nprobably existed, but I doubt that Takeda Shingen or Oda Nobunaga<br/>\nhired martial arts experts to train there armies in the way of<br/>\nunarmed combat. I would hazzard to guess based on what I&#39;ve read<br/>\n(and thus on what I &#39;haven&#39;t&#39; come accross) that mass training for<br/>\nthe armies wasn&#39;t too common - even weapons training. most ashigaru<br/>\nprobably went out and cut themselves a bamboo spear and just charged<br/>\ninto battle hoping for the best. I would assume that any martial<br/>\ntraining with weapons was done on one&#39;s own, and not through<br/>\na &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or closest to the lord,<br/>\nwho would receive sword training. Anyway, my point is that I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts training in<br/>\nthe &#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books. At best the subject comes up<br/>\nin the VERY questionable &#39;martial arts history books&#39;. If someone<br/>\nhas info on martial arts training from a &#39;reputable source&#39; PLEASE<br/>\nrespond to this post. I am curious about this simply because it is<br/>\nnot something covered by Hall, Varley, Sansom, Berry, or the others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>",
