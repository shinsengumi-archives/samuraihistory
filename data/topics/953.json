This mon and it&#39;s variations are<br/>\nusually seen as a block of four, or sixteen. My reference gives like 70<br/>\nfamilies that used it or a variation.<br/>\n    These mon questions come up on the sword forums often; I believe it was<br/>\nJohn Yumoto who said that to identify a family from mon you needed three<br/>\nmon. The mon of the lord and or the main house of the family, the family mon<br/>\nor variation which represented the particular branch and the mon of the<br/>\nwifes family. Thus we can see Satsuma Koshirae with the cross in circle mon,<br/>\nkiri mon and Aoi mon all in one. As a daughter of the Daimyo was adopted to<br/>\na noble family in Kyoto picked up the Kiri and then was wed to the Tokugawa<br/>\npicking up the Aoi mon and thus her sons and his cousins back in Satsuma<br/>\ncould sport all three.<br/>\n    And I would point out once we get into the Meiji period no rules were<br/>\nfollowed and any mon might be used by any family.
