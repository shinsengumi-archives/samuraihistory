For example,<br/>\n&gt;the population of Tokyo at that time was one million, whereas other<br/>\n&gt;important cities such as Osaka and Kyoto had a population of over<br/>\n&gt;400,000 people only.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That part is true. The rise of the great cities and the merchant class <br/>\nare the major event in this era.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and after 20 years all foreign experts were sent back. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not even.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;During that period a huge transition took place and education at a higher level was also initiated in Japanese.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I forget which private university in the 1900s had an Anglo dean with <br/>\nthe saying like &quot;Be bold or conquer&quot; or something along those lines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;From 1868 to 1945, Japan witnessed 77 years of imperial rule during<br/>\n&gt;which it fought many wars, the last being World War II, which it<br/>\n&gt;eventually lost. Still, Tokugawa said the Japanese managed to maintain<br/>\n&gt;their values.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wonder which ones he&#39;s talking about? Post-war Japan is an actual <br/>\ndemocratic nation with a very modern outlook. Nobody has to sell their <br/>\ndaughters anymore to make ends meet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Tokugawa, nevertheless, admitted that Japan is facing some social<br/>\n&gt;problems. For example, young people do not marry, which is causing a<br/>\n&gt;huge problem for Japanese families. He also said that more than 25<br/>\n&gt;percent of the overall Japanese population is older than 65 years.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Raising a family in a 400 square foot apartment would tend to put a <br/>\ndamper on things. A friend of mine thought Stanford had made a mistake <br/>\nand put her in married housing and we told her no, a 550 square foot <br/>\nstudio is a fairly normal size for one person in the US.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Tokugawa also said that the old buildings were being demolished for<br/>\n&gt;new and modern plazas, which was a matter of serious concern.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some of them should be demolished, they are firetraps! While I like old <br/>\nbuildings, I can sympathize with my Japanese friends who can only <br/>\nremember smelly toilets, poor lighting and heating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing, it was good for a few laughs. Of course press <br/>\nreleases have a tendency to be overly upbeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",

The answer to this is Tokugawa Japan whose people developed<br/>\ntheir own civilization in a self-contained environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus it comes as no surprise that Japanese expert, Tsunenari Tokugawa,<br/>\nthe 18th descendant of the man who started the Tokugawa period,<br/>\nbelieves that Pakistan can only progress if it has values and<br/>\neducation two things that are essential for the growth of a nation as<br/>\nJapan has seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nTsunenari Tokugawa was invited to speak at an event held by the 21st<br/>\nCentury Business & Economics Clubs (21st CBEC) and Institute of<br/>\nBusiness Administration (IBA) on Friday evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nTokugawa is the director of the Tokugawa Memorial Foundation and lives<br/>\nin New York. He is also president of NYK America. The topic of his<br/>\ntalk was: &#39;Transition from Tokugawa Shogunate to Modern Japan.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nGiving a historical account of Japan&#39;s progress, Tokugawa said that<br/>\nthe Tokugawa period in Japan lasted from 1603 to 1868 during which<br/>\ntime it progressed to the heights of which England had not seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the literacy rate during this period was high-70 to 80<br/>\npercent among males and 40 to 50 percent among females. He said the<br/>\nliteracy rate in most European countries and America was much lower.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore than 15,000 elementary schools, besides 260 Samurai schools and<br/>\n2,000 private academies, were established all over Japan. The teaching<br/>\nsystem of both regular primary schools and Samurai schools was<br/>\nseparate. The standard of education was very high at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe top priority of Tukugawa Japan was its strong consensus on<br/>\nnational security. There was strong sense of human equality under the<br/>\nclass system also, Tokugawa explained.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moral standards among the elite were high as well. He said the<br/>\nelite followed the teachings of noted Chinese philosopher, Confucius.<br/>\nIts people were environmentally conscious and no one cut down trees.<br/>\nAt the most people cut branches and bark for fuel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that time, a very sophisticated market economy was flourishing in<br/>\nJapan and a large number of people were living in cities. For example,<br/>\nthe population of Tokyo at that time was one million, whereas other<br/>\nimportant cities such as Osaka and Kyoto had a population of over<br/>\n400,000 people only.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1850, Japan opened up its economy to the world and its first<br/>\nagreement was signed with the United States. The government invited<br/>\ntechnicians, professors and technological experts from the US and<br/>\nEuropean countries to teach the Japanese nation the latest technology<br/>\nand literature. He said that people were taught in French and English<br/>\nduring the first decade, but later on all literature and technical<br/>\nmanuals were translated into Japanese, and after 20 years all foreign<br/>\nexperts were sent back. During that period a huge transition took<br/>\nplace and education at a higher level was also initiated in Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 1868 to 1945, Japan witnessed 77 years of imperial rule during<br/>\nwhich it fought many wars, the last being World War II, which it<br/>\neventually lost. Still, Tokugawa said the Japanese managed to maintain<br/>\ntheir values.<br/>\n<br/>\nTokugawa, nevertheless, admitted that Japan is facing some social<br/>\nproblems. For example, young people do not marry, which is causing a<br/>\nhuge problem for Japanese families. He also said that more than 25<br/>\npercent of the overall Japanese population is older than 65 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nTokugawa also said that the old buildings were being demolished for<br/>\nnew and modern plazas, which was a matter of serious concern.</div>",
