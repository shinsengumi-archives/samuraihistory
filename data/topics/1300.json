            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1983962517\">Hi Brandon,<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently I&#39;m looking at what &#39;contribution&#39; the ninja played to the<br/>\nevents of the Sengoku era - if any. (Difficult without records.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout getting into a discussion on the mythical status of the<br/>\nninja, I am trying to determine (purely for myself) how the daimyo <br/>\nutilised ninja, and how effective they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, I reckon their best contribution was in gathering<br/>\nintelligence on the enemy, mostly by watching, which would involve <br/>\nlong periods spent in enemy domains. Spying, in fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more theatrical activities - assassination being the most obvious<br/>\n- I think had little or no influence on the general outcome - and was <br/>\nprobably not employed as much as everyone likes to think. <br/>\nThey might have had a more tactical short-term effect, but cannot be <br/>\nguaranteed. (Koyama Castle, in my former post, remained in Takeda <br/>\nhands even after the murder of its commander - but perhaps Amari&#39;s <br/>\ndeath stopped his incursions into Mikawa.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure most daimyo could find samurai in their own ranks willing to<br/>\nundertake hazardous missions without resorting to employing<br/>\noutsiders.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another tale, a samurai noted for his shinobi skills slipped out<br/>\nof his beseiged castle, stole the besieger&#39;s standard, and put it<br/>\nover the main gate for all too see, as a taunt and insult to the <br/>\nbesieger and a blow to their morale while boosting their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",

His brother requests an interview <br/>\n&gt; with Ieyasu and explains the details, asking forgiveness and <br/>\n&gt; that Jingoro might return.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ieyasu observes that whilst it is understandable, it cannot be <br/>\n&gt; allowed to pass. However, if Jingoro would perform a service <br/>\n&gt; for Ieyasu, then he might consider it. The service is the <br/>\n&gt; assassination of a Amari Shirasaburo, a Takeda vassal holding <br/>\n&gt; Koyama castle in Totomi Province and a thorn in Ieyasu&#39;s side. <br/>\n&gt; Ieyasu wanted possession of Koyama.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A tall order, but examining the clues I have shortlisted this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jingoro, we are told, was famous for his martial skills;<br/>\n&gt; He was an accomplished flautist;<br/>\n&gt; He was an excellent shot with the arquebus;<br/>\n&gt; His opponent in an argument drew his sword, but Jingoro struck <br/>\n&gt; and killed him with a single blow that left no visible mark <br/>\n&gt; upon the body.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All in all - quite a talent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jingoro enters the service of Amari, woos him with his flute <br/>\n&gt; playing, and when they are alone together, kills him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ninja? Or simply a samurai with useful shinobi skills?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Whatever, the garrison of Koyama did not surrender so the death of<br/>\n&gt; Amari achieved nothing of significance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Interestingly, Jingoro returned to Hamamatsu, but did not stay <br/>\n&gt; long. When it was suggested he accompany an envoy to Kyoto, <br/>\n&gt; Ieyasu declined. &quot;I don&#39;t want him out of my sight. I have <br/>\n&gt; heard that Amari loved him like a son,&quot; Ieyasu said, &quot;yet the <br/>\n&gt; cruel fellow killed him in his sleep.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is a clue to the role and relationship of the samurai to <br/>\n&gt; the ninja. I do believe that most samurai, if they possessed <br/>\n&gt; the aptitude, developed shinobi-nin training and were entirely <br/>\n&gt; capable of the exploits usually accredited to the ninja.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When Ieyasu odered his son to commit seppuku, Hattori Hanzo, <br/>\n&gt; his celebrated ninja master, was sent to make sure the act was <br/>\n&gt; carried out. At the last, even Hanzo could not bring himself to <br/>\n&gt; act as kaishaku (second) knowing the man was innocent. Another <br/>\n&gt; samurai took his place and struck off Nobuyasu&#39;s head.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later, Ieyasu was heard to say, &quot;even that devil Hanzo could <br/>\n&gt; not bring himself to kill my son,&quot; at which point this samurai <br/>\n&gt; decided life would be safer elsewhere.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem being, once they have proved themselves skilled in <br/>\n&gt; the arts of deception, they themselves are never quite trusted <br/>\n&gt; again, even by their masters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Basically, I reckon most daimyo could find willing volunteers <br/>\n&gt; from among their own ranks for suicide missions, without having <br/>\n&gt; to resort to employing untrustworthy outsiders.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ieyasu and others did employ ninja, but I reckon it was for the <br/>\n&gt; more mundane and time-consuming operations of surveillance and <br/>\n&gt; information gathering, the day-to-day donkeywork of military <br/>\n&gt; intelligence, rather than the fantastic feats of fiction we <br/>\n&gt; read about.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thomas </span></blockquote></div>",

The service is the <br/>\nassassination of a Amari Shirasaburo, a Takeda vassal holding <br/>\nKoyama castle in Totomi Province and a thorn in Ieyasu&#39;s side. <br/>\nIeyasu wanted possession of Koyama.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tall order, but examining the clues I have shortlisted this:<br/>\n<br/>\nJingoro, we are told, was famous for his martial skills;<br/>\nHe was an accomplished flautist;<br/>\nHe was an excellent shot with the arquebus;<br/>\nHis opponent in an argument drew his sword, but Jingoro struck <br/>\nand killed him with a single blow that left no visible mark <br/>\nupon the body.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all - quite a talent.<br/>\n<br/>\nJingoro enters the service of Amari, woos him with his flute <br/>\nplaying, and when they are alone together, kills him.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinja? Or simply a samurai with useful shinobi skills?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever, the garrison of Koyama did not surrender so the death of<br/>\nAmari achieved nothing of significance.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, Jingoro returned to Hamamatsu, but did not stay <br/>\nlong. When it was suggested he accompany an envoy to Kyoto, <br/>\nIeyasu declined. &quot;I don&#39;t want him out of my sight. I have <br/>\nheard that Amari loved him like a son,&quot; Ieyasu said, &quot;yet the <br/>\ncruel fellow killed him in his sleep.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a clue to the role and relationship of the samurai to <br/>\nthe ninja. I do believe that most samurai, if they possessed <br/>\nthe aptitude, developed shinobi-nin training and were entirely <br/>\ncapable of the exploits usually accredited to the ninja.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Ieyasu odered his son to commit seppuku, Hattori Hanzo, <br/>\nhis celebrated ninja master, was sent to make sure the act was <br/>\ncarried out. At the last, even Hanzo could not bring himself to <br/>\nact as kaishaku (second) knowing the man was innocent. Another <br/>\nsamurai took his place and struck off Nobuyasu&#39;s head.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, Ieyasu was heard to say, &quot;even that devil Hanzo could <br/>\nnot bring himself to kill my son,&quot; at which point this samurai <br/>\ndecided life would be safer elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem being, once they have proved themselves skilled in <br/>\nthe arts of deception, they themselves are never quite trusted <br/>\nagain, even by their masters.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I reckon most daimyo could find willing volunteers <br/>\nfrom among their own ranks for suicide missions, without having <br/>\nto resort to employing untrustworthy outsiders.<br/>\n<br/>\nIeyasu and others did employ ninja, but I reckon it was for the <br/>\nmore mundane and time-consuming operations of surveillance and <br/>\ninformation gathering, the day-to-day donkeywork of military <br/>\nintelligence, rather than the fantastic feats of fiction we <br/>\nread about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
