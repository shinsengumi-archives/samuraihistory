            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1691710444\">The symbol might mean nothing at all.  Plus that is the second cover <br/>\nthat I know of.  The other has a sword on it.  There could easily be <br/>\nmore covers considering how long it has been published, but those are <br/>\nthe 2 that I know of.  My history professor recently wrote a book on <br/>\nChinese histiry (cannot remember the exact topic), and the publishers <br/>\nwanted to put a kanji on the cover that had nothing to do with the <br/>\nsubject of the book.  So they are not always related.  It might, but <br/>\nit might not.. I dont know the symbol.  As far as books on wafare and <br/>\ntactics THE ART OF WAR(or WARFARE) by Sun Tzu, and THE BOOK OF FIVE <br/>\nRINGS by Miayamoto Musashi are given obvious choices.  If you have <br/>\nnot read these texts I would suggest you do.  I have yet to read it, <br/>\nbut I did order a new copy of THE ART OF WARFARE that includes <br/>\nrecently discovered chapters, a commentary, and the original <br/>\nclassical Chinese text so that if you can read it you can varify <br/>\nthings for yourself.  It is available on amazon.com for about $18 <br/>\nUS.  Hoping it gets delivered soon, can&#39;t wait to give it a read.</div>",
