            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1876160551\">For the samurai keiko, or practice, would be first from his father,<br/>\nthen from others in the han, and perhaps then, if he had the time <br/>\nand the inclination he would seek out a sensei, either individually, <br/>\nor enrol in a dojo.<br/>\n<br/>\nCentral to the life of the dojo is the kamiza - the spirit corner -<br/>\none bows on entry, one bows on departure. it&#39;s the first and last <br/>\nthing you do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kamiza of a dojo will reference the founder of the Ryu  a<br/>\nportrait, some caligraphy, anything that recollects the founder, <br/>\nor founding spirit, will suffice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever, the kamiza signifies the essence of what the ryu is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sensei, that is the principal teacher, is the embodiment of that<br/>\nwhich is presented by the kamiza. This does not mean the sensei <br/>\nis a kami, a figure of divine reverence, but the meaning of sensei is <br/>\n&#39;one who is born before&#39;, the sensei is further along the road than<br/>\nhis disciple.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stories of a disciple&#39;s devotion to his sensei are many and<br/>\nlegendary. Almost every ryu has some tale of such, and alongside <br/>\nthem are the tales of the rigours endured by the disciple along the <br/>\npath at the hands of his master. Kil Bill II shows how this has<br/>\nentered popular consciousness.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Mention should also be made of the soke - the direct descendant of<br/>\nthe founder. The soke is not necessarily the senior instructor, but<br/>\nthe superior swordsman will show all due reverence towards his soke <br/>\nout of respect.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis relationship is founded on Shinto principle, of reverence<br/>\ntowards one&#39;s ancestor, be it by birth or by calling. It was later <br/>\ndeveloped by Shingon and Zen, then later again by Confucian and <br/>\nTaoist principles, this last by which the Tokugawa bakafu managed to <br/>\nbuild the cult of obligation and obedience with which to control the<br/>\nfiercely independent samurai - a class marked by its vanity and its<br/>\npride.<br/>\n<br/>\nTowards the end of the Sengoku Zen become the language of the<br/>\nswordsman&#39;s development, even if the practice was founded in Shinto, <br/>\nShingon, etc. Dave Lowry, in Autumn Lightning, expresses it thus:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Katsujinken, satsujinken (the sword that gives life, the sword that<br/>\ndestroys life) is an adage that has been brushed on inspirational<br/>\nscrolls hung in Yagyu ryu dojo and on certificates and teaching <br/>\nlicenses awarded to its bugeisha.  It is found in the treatises<br/>\nwritten by Munenori and others. More importantly than anywhere <br/>\nelse, katsujinken, satsujinken must be inscribed on the hearts of the <br/>\npractitioners of the ryu. In a way, it is at the very core of what<br/>\nthe Yagyu tradition is all about.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is these structures, I think, that largely precluded the mystique<br/>\nof the sword as we westerners view it. The devotion to an object<br/>\nsimply does not fit the mindset. The object of mystery, and the<br/>\nobject of the swordsman&#39;s devotion, in any literature I have read, <br/>\nis always the master, be he a distant founder or one&#39;s immediate<br/>\nsensei.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts on recent discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
