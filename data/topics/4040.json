It wasn&#39;t for keeping the samurai down, but for keeping them &quot;up.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The bosses wanted them to remain samurai, that&#39;s down from that <br/>\nperspective. No more Hideyoshi&#39;s or the like!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;midorinotoradesu&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bkirkham@...\">bkirkham@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Relating back to the samurai, there is always a need for military <br/>\n&gt;power.  In the samurai days it may have been for civil obedience <br/>\n&gt;outside the existance of a war.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Without the threat of a Bafuku army Japan fell apart from internal <br/>\ntensions, thus beginning the Meiji period and a move to be a real nation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The U.S. military is very different from the samurai.  Japan was <br/>\n&gt;isolated from most of the world.  By their own choice and because of <br/>\n&gt;geography.  The U.S. military deals with global issues.  A military <br/>\n&gt;dealing only with its own country&#39;s problems has different demands. <br/>\n&gt;In which case your second assertion may bear some truth.  Only some <br/>\n&gt;truth becuase I believe the samurai were in a postion like many <br/>\n&gt;dictatorships in the world.  They possessed the frightening might or <br/>\n&gt;the military and didn&#39;t require justifying themselves to the <br/>\n&gt;population they ruled.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, the US military serves us and not the other way around, we have our <br/>\nfounding fathers to thank, as well as the fine men and women who have <br/>\nserved since then for this almost unique distinction, we are one of the <br/>\nfew democracies that hasn&#39;t had a military coup.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If the peasants didn&#39;t like it; what would they do about it?  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Die messily along with their families.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;They odd situation with Japan is that they had 2 <br/>\n&gt;positions of power.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only one of the two at any given time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Shogun and Emperor.  Periods existed when the <br/>\n&gt;Emperor possessed all the power and there were times when the Emperor <br/>\n&gt;was only a puppet.  The peasants were&#39;nt the only ones who didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;like the system.  The Emperor didn&#39;t and he did something about it.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm... I&#39;m not sure if they were ever able to do anything about it or if <br/>\nthey were just shoved up by their would-be followers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;No matter how the samurai class may have been &quot;justified&quot; the Emperor <br/>\n&gt;decided that the weren&#39;t needed and that a new military needed to be <br/>\n&gt;formed to progress the nation into modern times.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not up enough on the Meiji restoration to be sure of this. I know he <br/>\nwas really enamoured with the west for a while, even the Empress wore <br/>\nwestern fahsions for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Important to note that he still thought a military was important just <br/>\n&gt;not the one they had.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For sure, they wanted to be a nation like America or England, which <br/>\nmeans splendid little colonial wars and looting your neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
