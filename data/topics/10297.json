            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-351903649\">It has taken about a year to finally get everything together (mainly the participants), but the Samurai Archives podcast is now on the air.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first two episodes are available, and were recorded at the Association of Asian Studies conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, and detailed some of the seminars. The 3rd episode will be coming up next week, and will be a convention wrap up.  After the conference series is done, the actual official podcast format will start, with each episode being between 45 minutes and an hour, and will examine different aspects of Japanese history. This will probably start next month, and new episodes should be released every 3-4 weeks, if not more frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai Archives podcast website:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://samuraiarchives.podbean.com/\">http://samuraiarchives.podbean.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSubscribe on Itunes: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/i1FIzT\">http://bit.ly/i1FIzT</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe first two episodes were recorded on location, and edited with free audio software, so the sound quality is to be expected - not great, but hardware and software is being updated, so within the next month or two the sound quality should dramatically increase.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe look forward to feedback, and once the actual podcast kicks off next month, we look forward to participation, questions, feedback, requests for future episodes, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!</div>",
