All I know about them is that they were of great help in <br/>\nputting the Minamoto family into power and that they were from the Kinugasa <br/>\nregion(somewhere near Kamakura?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Miura claimed descent from Taira Takamochi, a son of Katsurabara-shinno <br/>\n(himself a son of the Emperor Kammu).  Miura (Taira) Tamemichi established <br/>\nhimself at Kinugasa in the mid-11th Century. By the late-12th Century, they <br/>\nwere acting as vice-governors (suke) of Sagami Province.  Miura Yoshiaki <br/>\n(d.1181) and his son Yoshizumi (d.1200) supported Minamoto Yoritomo from the <br/>\noutset of the Gempei War, though the former was killed early in the <br/>\nfighting.  After the Minamoto victory, Yoshizumi was named as one of the 13 <br/>\nmembers of the Shukurou (or council of elders, established in 1199 to check <br/>\nthe power of Minamoto Yoriie).  Yoshizumi was also to evidently act as shugo <br/>\nof Sagami, and the Miura would later recieve Kawachi and Kii.  Miura <br/>\nYoshimura (d.1239) thus became quite influential under the Hojo bakufu and <br/>\nhis family might have been the only Minamoto Gokenin capable of threatening <br/>\nthe Hojo&#39;s grip on Kamakura.  This, it would seem, was their undoing, for on <br/>\n1247 the Hojo and Adachi family made a sudden attack on the Miura residences <br/>\nand killed (or forced into suicide) some 500 members of the latter family.<br/>\nMinor branches of the Miura endured, however.  The most notable of these <br/>\nbecame powerful once again in the Muira area under the leadership of Miura <br/>\nTokitaka. He adopted his heir Yoshiatsu from the Uesugi, but when a natural <br/>\nson was born to Tokitaka, he forced Yoshiatsu into the priesthood.  <br/>\nYoshiatsu suddenly rebelled and Tokitaka was attacked at Arai and killed <br/>\nalong with his son in 1496.  Yoshiatsu (the son of Uesugi Takamasa and also <br/>\nknown as Miura Dousun) established his own son Yoshimoto at Arai while he <br/>\nresided in Okazaki (not to be confused with the Okazaki of Mikawa).  He <br/>\nbecame involved in a war with Hojo Soun when the latter attacked Odawara <br/>\nCastle.  Yoshiatsu allied with the uesugi but was subsequently attacked at <br/>\nOkazaki and fled to Arai, which fell to the Hojo after a long siege in 1516. <br/>\n  He commited suicide along with Yoshimoto (I&#39;m not sure what became of <br/>\nYoshiatsu&#39;s 2nd son Yoshimasa - perhaps he also died at Arai).<br/>\nAnother branch of the Miura, descended from a grandson of Muira Yoshizumi), <br/>\nwas established as daimyo by the Tokugawa in 1639 in Shimotsuke Province.<br/>\nFWS<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>",
