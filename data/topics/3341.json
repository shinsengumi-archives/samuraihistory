He fought in many battles for Takeda <br/>\nShingen under the leadership of Baba Nobufusa and was said to have <br/>\nbeen wounded no fewer then forty times over the course of career, <br/>\nwhich came to an end when he died of illness in June 1561 at Kaizu <br/>\nCastle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOBATA Masamori 1534-1582 <br/>\nMasamori was the son of Obata Toranori and a noted general of Takeda <br/>\nShingen. For some time he acted as Kosaka Masanobu&#39;s second in <br/>\ncommand at Kaizu Castle in northern Shinano Province. He was wounded <br/>\nat the Battle of Nagashino and eventually died of illness. He was <br/>\nmarried to a daughter of Hara Toratane.<br/>\n<br/>\nOBATA Nobusada 1540-1592 <br/>\nNobusada joined the Takeda around 1560 after fleeing his lands in <br/>\nKôzuke Province. He had his old fief restored to him by Shingen the <br/>\nfollowing year and proved to be one of Shingen&#39;s most dependable <br/>\ngenerals. He led large forces at the Battles of Mimasetoge and <br/>\nMikatagahara and was very useful in the Takeda&#39;s Kôzuke campaigns.

In sum, I have the <br/>\n&gt; following questions:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1). Are they all from the same (general) lineage? Any details <br/>\n&gt; available?<br/>\n&gt; 2). More specifically, how are Toramori, Masamori, and Kagenori <br/>\n&gt; related? I have found conflicting info. on this.<br/>\n&gt; 3). Does anyone happen to know anything about them and their <br/>\n&gt; activities beyond dates of birth/death and other surface info.? Or, <br/>\n&gt; are there any decent sources in English (beyond Samurai Archives--<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve farmed as much as I can from there!) where I might find <br/>\n&gt; something a bit more in-depth?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks much in advance for any assistance and/or clues! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marlene Harris </span></blockquote></div>",
