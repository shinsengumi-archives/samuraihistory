The first was the introductory ceremony in which he <br/>\nwas given his first sword, the mamori-gatana, &quot;a charm sword <br/>\nwith a hilt and scabbard covered with brocade, to which was <br/>\nattached to a kinchaku (purse or wallet)... worn by boys under 5 <br/>\nyears of age&quot; (Stone, 433).  The second ceremony was the <br/>\ngembuku, which signified his acceptance as a man amoung <br/>\nmen.  At this time the child recieved his first real swords and <br/>\narmor and had his hair dressed in an adult coiffure.  From this <br/>\npoint of his life onward, he would be expected to specialize in the <br/>\nfunctions typical of his rank within the heirarchy of the clan, but <br/>\nwithout ever neglecting his training in the art of using the <br/>\nweapon that had been defined in the military code as the &quot;living <br/>\nsoul of the samurai.&quot;&quot;<br/>\nJust read that the other day.  Found it interesting that the &quot;charm <br/>\nswords&quot; were called mamori-gatana.  Could almost mistake that <br/>\npheonetically for english of similar meaning.
