Never really botherd with dates. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just so happen to live in Sweden, the southern part of Sweden. History<br/>\nis my favourite hobby, and I really cant recall any autrocities done by<br/>\nthe catholic curch to us. In teh begining when some monks came to our<br/>\ncountry (were talking 600-800AD) we killed the anoying ones direktly,<br/>\nand left the harmless ones to to what ever they wanted, as long as they<br/>\ndidnt piss us off. Not untill the 1300AD I think (Not sure on exact<br/>\ndates, may be later may be sooner) A swedish king said I&#39;m gonna be<br/>\nbaptised, and everybody who has a porblem with it, chop! chop! One head<br/>\nshorter. I.E. your king is catholic, now the rest of sweden is catholic.<br/>\nThis held up for a time, and we had the usual witchhunts and stuff, but<br/>\nnoting to out of place in Europe during 1400-1600. Then a jolly good&#39;ol<br/>\nchap named Gustav Wasa, decided to change from catholic to protestant,<br/>\nand the chatolic got thrown out. tyhis was maily done outof economic<br/>\nreasons. The catholic curch is sinfully rich, but the protestants favour<br/>\npoverty, ie more taxes to the King. yay! If i remember correctly this is<br/>\nsome where during the begining of 1500. And since then we have had wars<br/>\nwith polen, Turkey, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Finland, And a few others<br/>\nthat just so happend to be on the way to Polen and Turkey. I have no<br/>\nrecoolection what so ever of autrocities of the scale of the spanish and<br/>\nportugal in South america, or the english men in China, or the french<br/>\nand Dutch in Africa. Who, in the name of the pop enslaved ppl for the<br/>\nsake of christianity.<br/>\n<br/>\nNope, we are friendly, peacefull people in Sweden, and as such we have<br/>\nbeen treated nicely by the Father.<br/>\n<br/>\n Well thats what I remember from my history lessons in my 12 year carer<br/>\nof grammar school, junior high and highschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow what was the autricities you were talking about?<br/>\nApart from the usual witchhunts and heretic slaying, of the dark ages?<br/>\n<br/>\n/// Chris D.

Most of it was still filled with <br/>\nNative Americans! Yoshinobu inherited a corrupt and doddering system <br/>\nthat sooner or later would have had another civil war, which it did. I <br/>\nwould argue in many ways that Japan wasn&#39;t really a nation until the <br/>\nMeiji restoration. Also one of the reasons we forced Japan to negotiate <br/>\nwith us was to insure fair treatment of our castaways. Japan enslaved or <br/>\nkilled them. Will Adams was one such in an earlier period and the people <br/>\nhe was with were badly mistreated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Ieyassu Tokugawa is a name to be listed between the great historic statesmen<br/>\n&gt;leaders just like Julius Caesar Augustus, Alexander The Great and others.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but I&#39;m sure there are dead clans and monasterys that would curse <br/>\nhis name. He killed a lot of people, as did his two predecessors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And the Tokugawa procedures against christianism&#39;s infiltration and<br/>\n&gt;political conspiracy avoided the several atrocities that happened against<br/>\n&gt;the other religions that christianism promoted in other countries just like<br/>\n&gt;Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Spain and others, just to name a few cases.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no disagreement with that. Christianity is a plague of some kind <br/>\nin that period, the Spanish had used that conversion trick many times <br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;To be anti-tokugawa is to be against the samurai spirit and culture.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ieyasu was an incredibly pragmatic warlord of the Sengoku jidai who rose <br/>\nto the top by commiting treachery against his master. The things you <br/>\nthink of  &#39;samurai spirit&#39; and all of that are an Edo jidai construct of <br/>\na government that wished to stop the endless revolts against the current <br/>\nshoguns. Unless betrayal and murder are the spirit your talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
