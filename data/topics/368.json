You asked the question whether the<br/>\nperson you are responding to is ten years old.  You<br/>\nare the one obviously offended and not able to control<br/>\nyourself.  Are You ten years old????

A good book on the<br/>\n&gt; subject<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the origin and truths behind the &quot;Ninja&quot; is<br/>\n&gt; Stephen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turnbulls, Ninja.

The Samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when going in to combat without armor preffered to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.

If you look at the clothing from the yayoi<br/>\n&gt; &gt; period forward you will see similarity&#39;s leading to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the advent of the Hakama.  The Japanese as with every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; othr nation were very practical in the development of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their clothing.  A good example of this is the Long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hakama worn in the Shoguns palace during the Tokugawa<br/>\n&gt; &gt; period which restricted movement making attacks on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others impossible.
