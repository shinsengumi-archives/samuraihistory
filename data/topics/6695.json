A graceful pace allows Yamada to explore fully the life of a <br/>\nlower-caste samurai in a rural fiefdom, where money is always in <br/>\nshort supply and clan pressures lurk just outside his compound. <br/>\nYamada again turns to the short stories of Shuhei Fujisawa to draw <br/>\nan indelible portrait of a solitary samurai with an unyielding code <br/>\nof honor and dignity that never will allow him to stray even for a <br/>\nmoment into disgrace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with &quot;Twilight Samurai,&quot; which earned international appreciation <br/>\nand an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film, &quot;The Hidden <br/>\nBlade&quot; will do well in urban specialty venues in many markets.<br/>\n<br/>\nStructurally, the two films are remarkably similar. (Yamada wrote <br/>\nthis screenplay with Yoshitaka Asama.) In the first act, a samurai <br/>\n(Masatoshi Nagase) must rescue a woman (Takako Matsu) being abused <br/>\nin her married life. The second act witnesses an unspoken love bloom <br/>\nbetween these two even as the samurai&#39;s loyalty is called into <br/>\nquestion by corrupt superiors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third act contains a dual to the death between the samurai, who <br/>\nnever has killed, and a man the clan has ordered him to kill. This <br/>\ntime, the opponent is a friend and brother samurai (Yukiyoshi <br/>\nOzawa), whose life he does not wish to take.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis new story takes place at the moment in the mid-19th century <br/>\nwhen European weaponry and military strategies are imported into <br/>\nJapan&#39;s conservative, feudal society. Much of this is played for <br/>\ncomedy as soldiers awkwardly struggle to understand rifles, cannons <br/>\nand alien military training so at odds with the old-school methods <br/>\nof sword and knife. Yet you sense a kind of moral corruption has <br/>\nentered Japanese society, too, ushered in by these new and <br/>\nimpersonal weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hero in both stories is virtually the same man, who very much <br/>\nrepresents the old school. His unswerving righteous might be boring <br/>\nwere it not so fascinating to watch the samurai maneuver in a <br/>\ndifficult society where divided loyalties and easy corruption litter <br/>\nhis daily path. Similarly, the beauty and purity of the heroine <br/>\nmight come off as bland were it not so touching to watch the <br/>\nmistreated woman blossom in the samurai&#39;s warm and caring household.<br/>\n<br/>\nYamada has performed a minor miracle with these two samurai films: <br/>\nHe has managed a portrait of goodness and virtue that is neither <br/>\ncynical nor contrived. The director clearly believes in the samurai <br/>\nspirit and code. By reviving it on the screen with such empathy, <br/>\nYamada demonstrates the true complexity of a simple life lived well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a marvelously produced film from its quiet appreciation for <br/>\nthe countryside to the minute details in its interior design. A <br/>\nmostly Western-style music score by Isao Tomita skillfully <br/>\nintertwines the classic with the intimate. <br/>\n<br/>\nCast: Munezo Katagiri: Masatoshi Nagase; Kie: Takako Matsu; Samon <br/>\nShimada: Hidetaka Yoshioka; Yaichiro Hazama: Yukiyoshi Ozawa, Shino: <br/>\nTomoko Tabata.<br/>\n<br/>\nDirector: Yoji Yamada; Screenwriters: Yoji Yamada, Yoshitaka Asama; <br/>\nBased on stories by: Shuhei Fujisawa; Producer: Junichi Sakomoto, <br/>\nTakeo Hisamatsu, Hiroshi Fukasawa, Ichiro Yamamoto; Director of <br/>\nphotography: Mutsuo Naganuma; Music: Isao Tomita; Costumes: Kazuko <br/>\nKurosawa; Editor: Iwao Ishii.<br/>\n<br/>\nReuters/Hollywood Reporter</div>",
