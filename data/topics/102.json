It seems to<br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; remained a frighteningly effective weapon in Europe<br/>\n&gt; right up to the mechanised era.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tom<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey, that&#39;s what the Cav is for...taking the glory<br/>\nwhile those poor grunts get the heck pounded out of<br/>\nthem! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as why the U.S. Cavalry never took up the<br/>\nlance, I&#39;m not entirely sure. I would never claim to<br/>\nbe an expert on cavalry history, though I am trying to<br/>\nlearn as much as possible (I&#39;m reading a great book<br/>\nright now, The Horse in Warfare...pretty good). I do<br/>\nknow that U.S. Cav historically has fought more as<br/>\ndragoons than as anything else...probably because in<br/>\nthe Revolutionary War that was the easiest<br/>\norganization for a militia to maintain, and warfare on<br/>\nthe North American continent has never really been<br/>\nconducive to the grand cavalry battles as in Europe.<br/>\nBy the time the U.S. embroiled itself in conflicts<br/>\n(The Mexican War, U.S. Civil War) firepower had caught<br/>\nup with mobility and charges into the guns were not<br/>\nadvisable for cavalry or infantry. Mostof the U.S.<br/>\nArmy&#39;s 19th century combat (except for 1812-14,<br/>\n1846-48, 1861-65, and 1898) consisted of Indian<br/>\n(Native American) fighting. The Native American didn&#39;t<br/>\nform orderly battle lines and march onto the field<br/>\nlike Napoleon&#39;s Grande Armee. Indians were hit-and-run<br/>\nmounted archers, and to combat them the U.S. Cavalry<br/>\nevolved into mounted riflemen and scouts. In the U.S.<br/>\nArmy today, cavalry is synonomous with scouts and<br/>\nreconnaisance. Cavalry has always been more important<br/>\nin the U.S. as a reconaissance force than as a<br/>\nstriking force (witness JEB Stuart&#39;s failure at<br/>\nGettysburg), Americans preferring to hit the enemy<br/>\nwith artillery than to charge in among them. Maybe<br/>\nthat&#39;s why we never developed &quot;Lancer&quot; units, but I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s because the U.S. Cavalry developed<br/>\nprimarily as an Indian fighting force. If we had a<br/>\nunit of &quot;Lancers&quot; charge and Indian position, they&#39;d<br/>\njust run...with as much land as we had in the 19th<br/>\ncentury, the Indians could just keep running and<br/>\nrunning...<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this might help, though again I do not claim to<br/>\nbe an expert. Ask me about the M1A1 Tank or what a<br/>\nmodern Division Cavalry Squadron does, and I&#39;ll tell<br/>\nyou!<br/>\n<br/>\nScouts Out!<br/>\n<br/>\nNate <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-812416796\">Hi Nathan - <br/>\n<br/>\nThought I&#39;d reply, not from any great scholastic viewpoint, but as an eclectically-read Sengoku buff like <br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the first thing I&#39;d say is that the samurai never employed cavalry &#39;units&#39; such as you and I understand <br/>\nthem. This stems from the early samurai days, when the way of the warrior was &#39;the way of the horse and the <br/>\nbow&#39;, and the mounted warrior would go to battle with one or more &#39;footmen&#39; as we might call it, as much as <br/>\nhe could afford. The unchanging nature of samurai culture over almost the entire warrior period meant that <br/>\nthis practice was carried through from the upper strata of samurai to the low - armies were raised be levies, <br/>\nholders of land having to supply themselves and a number of men, some mounted, some on foot, fully armed <br/>\nand ready for battle, according to their wealth, which was determined by their income from landholdings. This <br/>\nmeant that even through to the late Sengoku days, daimyo armies bore a greater resemblance to early <br/>\nmedieval warbands than to organised military units.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe emergence of ashigaru - the lightfoot - in the Onin Jidai increased the proportion of footsoldiers to <br/>\nmounted, and samurai armies swelled in size, but two armies, be they or 10,000 or 100,000 men each, would <br/>\nnot necessarily conform to the same proportion of horse and foot, nor to the disribution of arms within the <br/>\narmies. Oda Nobunaga&#39;s armies, apparently, were known for their significant percentage of ill-trained <br/>\nfootsoldiers armed with long spears. Tokugawa armies evolved, I believe, with a significantly larger percentage <br/>\nof &#39;reliable&#39; troops at all levels (this might reflect the fact that Oda was a cruel commander who often turned <br/>\non his own retainers. Tokugawa never struck against one of his own without a valid reason, which would have <br/>\nincreased his attraction in the alliance stakes - you could trust him more than the others). What the ashigaru <br/>\ndid bring was a need to manage larger numbers of foot soldiers, which required their commanders to organise <br/>\nthem by weapon types, so we have the emergence of companies of spears, of archers, of gunners, etc. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think any daimyo ever raised &#39;ashigaru cavalry&#39; as a separate arm. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis meant that even among Takeda units, who were usually better organised and managed than their <br/>\nenemies, and who seemingly favoured mounted troops, there would have been a large percentage of foot <br/>\namong the horse, so that even the charges against the Nagashino barricades, as shown in Kagemusha, would <br/>\nhave in reality comprised of a mixed force of horse and foot, the footmen &#39;chasing&#39; their mounted masters <br/>\ninto battle, rather than pure cavalry in a samurai &#39;Charge of the Light Brigade&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother factor is weaponry. Initially a horseback archer, the later, Sengoku mounted warrior was a spearmen <br/>\n(I still don&#39;t understand why, in many translations, spearmen on foot are armed with &#39;lances&#39; and spearmen <br/>\non horseback with &#39;spears&#39;!), but significantly handled his weapon unlike his European counterpart. The spear <br/>\nwas wielded to left and right, not forward, and was never used in the couch position like a lancer. Therefore <br/>\nthe samurai never evolved cavalry in ordered, shoulder-to-shoulder charges, nor did they develop, as far as I <br/>\nknow, separate all-mounted units for use in pursuit, as heavy and light cavalry evolved in Europe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy feeling is the pre-eminence of the Takeda cavalry, so often quoted, has more to do with Takeda morale as <br/>\na whole than any significant tactical advantage. The defeat at Nagashino of a well-led, well-armed and highly <br/>\nmotivated &#39;samurai&#39; army by a rabble of &#39;peasants&#39; armed with guns must have struck a blow against the <br/>\nsamurai psyche from which it never fully recovered.    <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I think a key is in the word &#39;evolution&#39;. European history has evolved many types of mounted warrior - <br/>\nhussar, dragoon, lancer, etc., and tactics for their useage accordingly, which came about as different <br/>\ncountries developed their own systems, and then fought each other, so influencing their neighbours. The first <br/>\nHussars, I think, were Hungarian light cavalry, which their enemies copied as &#39;a good idea&#39;. Napoleon raised <br/>\nregiments of lancers after some unpleasant experiences fighting the Poles on his way to Russia, and the Brits <br/>\ncopied them off him. I don&#39;t think the US cavalry ever used lancers? We (the Brits) did right up until WW1. <br/>\nThe Poles still used them in WW2. The samurai &#39;suffered&#39; in that they never had this process of cross-<br/>\nfertilisation to introduce new concepts and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom</div>",

I <br/>\ndon&#39;t remember the name of the castle, but I believe it predates the <br/>\nSengoku period.  I have to assume that the remains are mostly <br/>\nfoundation, because I am under the impression that Japanese castles <br/>\nused more wood than European ones.  The &#39;viewfromcastle&#39; picture is <br/>\njust that - a view from the castle, just to give an idea of location. <br/>\nit had a 360 degree view of the surrounding area, and the hike to the <br/>\ntop is a steep, winding and wooded road, ideal for defense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I returned to the USA and took a Japanese Art History <br/>\nclass did I learn to take multiple pictures of the same <br/>\nbuilding/object from different angles for later study - that helped <br/>\nme out later when I returned to Kyoto, but I have yet to return to <br/>\nKyushu to get more pics of the castles...<br/>\n<br/>\nCEWest</div>",
