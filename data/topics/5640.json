            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1145317286\">Hello Brothers; <br/>\n   Firstly i am new to the forum and as i have been reading along the past few days i have seen truly, in my humble opinion...the best gathering of shared knowledge, truth, and comraderie since my days as a U.S. Marine. Stating that everyone here has a passion for the subject and era(s) would be a gross understatement. I have been reading & researching Japanese history for the better part of my life and i am finally within a group where i feel i can converse openly, freely & most of all...continue to learn. Please pardon me for being overly ecstatic, but this forum is just truly what i have been looking for in a nutshell. I have recently returned from Okinawa, Japan...but luckily for me i am sure none of you will hold that against me (i hope that was funny to some, give me a little face...please) but have been over mainland Japan as well and there are not many places in Japan or Asia period that i have not traveled. On my own or through the U.S. Military. So i offer my modest thanks and praise for being able to exist within the forum...<br/>\n     Secondly; i agree with the statements of Mr. Wayland...to request for information one must truly want to seek the truth. As i am sure we all know, one of the staples of Bushido was that it was commonplace to seek constructive criticism from your peers...for as Tsunetomo said: &quot;If you judge and manage every affair while depending only on your small learning and wisdom...etc.&quot; The point is that you cannot ask a question with the intention of getting only the answer you desire.<br/>\n     Thirdly; i wanted to acquire some books or writings if possible explaining the history of the Yakuza as a sort of &quot;police force&quot; in their origination, i am not sure if this is correct, but i am really looking for a sort of timeline from their beginning and how they progressed and changed. Any assistance in this manner would be extremely grateful. Continued Blessings!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  --- On Wed 10/13, Nate Ledbetter &lt; ltdomer98@... &gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter [mailto: ltdomer98@...]<br/>\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nDate: Wed, 13 Oct 2004 19:44:42 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai Inquiry<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;tt&gt;<br/>\nMy use of the phrase &quot;bad romance novel&quot; in no way,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nshape, or form, justified an attack on my person using&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nfoul language.

I didn&#39;t call anyone any names. As a&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nsubordinate list moderator, I was well within my&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nrights granted by Kitsuno to simply delete the email&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nand ban the person from posting.

Those with long memories will know exactly<br/>\nto what I&#39;m referring!!  I like a list with a bit of spice and armour plated<br/>\negos coupled with hard-won expert knowledge and I have a VERY thick skin -<br/>\nBUT - I have on more than one occasion received list replies to my pitiful<br/>\nofferings from at least two individuals that could have been interpreted as<br/>\nsarcasm or put-downs.  I have chosen to interpret these as blunt humour or<br/>\nsardonic humour or... (email not being an easy medium in which to express<br/>\nsuch concepts).  I have also perceived it dealt out to others with<br/>\nconsequent apologies for being misunderstood when the recipients squawked<br/>\n&quot;ABUSE...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI smiled at the armour-piercing humour of &quot;Tenshi, Rose, and Toni<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madmadotakuchick@...\">madmadotakuchick@...</a>&gt;&quot; coupled with a velvet glove challenge whacked<br/>\nacross the cheek because I&#39;m quite used to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK (1) - now rip the stuffing out of this reply if you are so inclined...<br/>\n<br/>\nOK (2) - now to be useful.  There was a Daimyo in the Edo period who, having<br/>\njust inherited his fief, did indeed shortly thereafter fall in love with a<br/>\ngeisha.  It must be true because I read it somewhere in the last 40 years of<br/>\nmy lust in reading about swords and the samurai.  This man was besotted with<br/>\nthe lass and squandered his family&#39;s fortune to the extent that he was<br/>\ndis-inherited by the Shogunate.  This story may have been in Mitford&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;Tales of the Samurai&quot;, Lafcadio Hearn&#39;s 2-volume set that I have, in a<br/>\nsimilar such book of tales, or in one of the many Sword Society journals I<br/>\nhave gathered over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I can verify &quot;Tenshi, Rose, and Toni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madmadotakuchick@...\">madmadotakuchick@...</a>&gt;&#39;s&quot;<br/>\nobservation that the story has credibility in my reading.  As for a name of<br/>\nthe samurai, it was in the story but I cannot remember it.  If anyone is<br/>\nserious about the name I&#39;ll have an archeaological dig into my voluminous<br/>\nlibrary...<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I close by thanking those who devote so much time to the great success<br/>\nof the list and to enlighten many of us lesser mortals with their<br/>\nencyclopaedic knowledge of the Samurai.  I dips my lid to &#39;ee.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith best regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas<br/>\n(Melbourne, Australia)</div>",

Since you directed<br/>\nit at me, you get a second chance. <br/>\n<br/>\n2.
