In <br/>\nTurnbull&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;samurai sourcebook&quot;, there is no entry for magoichi but shigehide is<br/>\nrefered as gunnery expert for hideyoshi whose birth and death dates <br/>\nare<br/>\nunknow and who fought in Komaki and Nagakute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find any more info (like the origin of suzuki clan), I am <br/>\ninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\nJérôme.</div>",
