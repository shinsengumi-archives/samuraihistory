It deals with the Yoshiwara or pleasure <br/>\nquarter of Tokyo. According to historical events the Yoshiwara burnt <br/>\ndown several times since its creation in the 1600&#39;s by the Tokugawa <br/>\nregime. I was wondering if anyone knew of a site or had the information <br/>\nabout the specific timeline of the fires such as months and years. I <br/>\nwould appreciate it. Thanks to all.<br/>\nRod</div>",
