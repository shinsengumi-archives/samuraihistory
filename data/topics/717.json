            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-922368068\">Who else here would like to challenge Nobunaga or Sun tzu to a game <br/>\nof chess? or a multiplayer on Total War? <br/>\n<br/>\nWho thinks they would win?<br/>\n<br/>\nLee<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHi <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah I too would love to challenge Sun-Tzu or Nobunaga to a game of <br/>\nchess or Total war, I think Sun-Tzu would feel more at home with <br/>\nRomance of the Kingdoms series, and Nobunaga with Nobunaga&#39;s ambition <br/>\nby Koei though (more realistic sorry EA). <br/>\n<br/>\n     I love Shogun Total war but Now after I think 3 years ofplaying  <br/>\nI am wanting more from the ronin clans (not in history but anyway), I <br/>\nnotice in the latest version they have the Mogami, Date, Ouchi, <br/>\nMiyoshi etc the list goes on, I think they should use the maps from <br/>\nwww.Samurai-archives as these are by far the best maps I have seen in <br/>\na long time, except maybe from the Cambridge classical history of <br/>\nJapan, but these cost £80 a shot and I&#39;m only a Daimyo of about 3 <br/>\nkoku. But I have an armoury yeyyy and one spear Dojo, arrgghh the <br/>\nikko-iki already. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyway now for something completly different, back to the <br/>\nquestion I would like to play chess with these guys but not Shogi <br/>\n(Japanese Chess) or Chinese chess xiangQi.  Has anyone out there <br/>\nplayed it, very complicated, you sometimes can&#39;t move your pieces <br/>\nbackwards (Very Bushido me thinks) allthough the names of the pieces <br/>\nin Kanji are fantastic Drunk Elephant, Treacherous fox, strutting <br/>\ncrow, (This is shogi historical variants quoted from many games  ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\n    When I saw Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon I really found the names <br/>\nfascinating this goes one step beyond, surely madness you might <br/>\nthink, but it really works.  I urge everyone to check out <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?name=Shogi+Variants\">http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?name=Shogi+Variants</a> it has a <br/>\ncopy of Shogi variants with shogi from each period, historically <br/>\nrelevant, to Japan from the <br/>\nHeian period through Sengoku, Monoyama, Meiji, Modern.  Awesome, also <br/>\nif not get international Karate and sumo Hoppers, both Classics, very <br/>\nold school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    But seriously Shogi is fantastic, and it can help you get into <br/>\nthe mind set of a warrior of these days, as they would have played <br/>\nthis or Go as a strategic exercise.  Check out Mr A.J Bryant&#39;s cool <br/>\nsite at www.geocities.com/sengokudaimyo/miscellany/miscellany.html to <br/>\nfind out more.  On a last note, I personally see Nobunaga as a <br/>\nbrutish, boring, unispiring leader, Akechi Mitsuhide on the other <br/>\nhand he sounds cool, why did he kill Nobunaga, (I think I would have <br/>\ndone the same maybe I have a ruthless streak??!!(^_^)*** Nobunaga <br/>\nwanted to become King so to speak Akechi he was just a pawn, <br/>\nsometimes, pawns take kings, (Shogi again) Just look at Hideyoshi now <br/>\ntheres a Maneki Neko (Lucky cat) I would have liked to have known and <br/>\nfought beside.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain check out Shogi I&#39;m sure you will find it useful, if only for <br/>\nthe history, I really enjoy it, except you sometimes can&#39;t move <br/>\nbackwards, this would never work in Total war as how the ##### do I <br/>\ntake a bridge province using 1 unit of Spearmen without fake <br/>\nretreating.  XiangQi Chinese chess has a river through the middle of <br/>\nthe board maybe I should study this a bit more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best Mark</div>",

The US Army has had<br/>\nits share for its short history (Grant, Washington,<br/>\nLee most of his life, Patton, Eisenhower, etc.) If you<br/>\nmean currently, that&#39;s rather hard to say. Most of the<br/>\nabove mentioned wouldn&#39;t be considered great if there<br/>\nhad not have been wars for them to fight. I believe<br/>\nmany great leaders don&#39;t stand out until the bullets<br/>\nstart to fly. But if I had to say anybody that I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad contact with, a COL Michael Formica comes to mind.<br/>\nHe was my squadron commander in a cavalry unit in<br/>\nKorea. Tactical genius, and we would have followed him<br/>\nanywhere. If he had decided to go to Pyongyang, we&#39;d<br/>\nhave followed him all the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother might be LTC H.R. McMaster. If you&#39;ve<br/>\nresearched the Gulf War at all, he was the cavalry<br/>\ncompany commander that destroyed an Iraqi Republican<br/>\nGuard battalion at the Battle of 73 Easting. He&#39;s been<br/>\npublished many times, and is regarded as quite the<br/>\nrising star. And I&#39;ve talked with people who work for<br/>\nhim (he commands a cavalry squadron in Germany now)<br/>\nand they say he really is the tactical genius everyone<br/>\nsays he is. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just personal observations, and I can only<br/>\nspeak for what I have seen. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I have an interest in the<br/>\nhistory and origins of the samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn answer to the question at hand, there are several leaders of the past<br/>\nwhich I think were great military leaders, although I debate their ideals<br/>\nand philosophies, ie Adolf Hitler. I think Hitler made a crucial error in<br/>\njudgment in invading Russia. He should have learned his lesson from Napolean<br/>\nwho tried and failed. Had&#39;ve he focused more on other areas and not broken<br/>\nthe pact with Stalin, then the war would have turned in another direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, Stalin himself was equally brutal. Yet the allies made their<br/>\nchoice in siding with the lesser of two evils when chosing Stalin as an ally<br/>\nover Hitler.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, Winston Churchill made a good strategic move by involving the<br/>\nUnited States into the conflict when Britain were obviously facing<br/>\nobliteration by the Germans who would no doubt have invaded Britain had&#39;ve<br/>\nthe United States become involved. Had&#39;ve they waited until after the<br/>\nGermans occupied Britain, they would not have had a strategic place to<br/>\nlaunch an attack on Europe for D-Day.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, Attila the Hun. He hasn&#39;t gotten a mention at all so I thought that<br/>\nhe should. He had undoubtedly made an impact on the European continent<br/>\nbetween 950-953 AD, when the Roman Empire was falling. He would have beaten<br/>\nthe Turks to pillaging Constantinople if he didn&#39;t have the appropriate<br/>\nsiege weapons to break down the heavily fortified walls. The Turks took care<br/>\nof that a few hundred years later. However, the effort on Attila&#39;s part was<br/>\nnot wasted. It did allow him to establish his empire and therefore allow his<br/>\nefforts to be focused on the west - ie Gaul etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFifth, Genghis Khan, who undoubtedly had invaded more land than any other<br/>\ninvader to date. No other military leader had achieved such a feat even to<br/>\nthis day. Had&#39;ve Genghis not died then it is possible that Europe would have<br/>\nhad a different destiny.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn conclusion I would like to add that there are a great many other leaders<br/>\nwho deserve a mention.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrendan<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tshadowhawke666 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowhawke666@...\">shadowhawke666@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, April 11, 2002 11:29 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[samuraihistory] If you could be a great Military leader how would<br/>\nyou be?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi fellow warriors,<br/>\n     As I was going through my mail this evening I saw a few famous military<br/>\nleaders either mentioned or referred to. A question occured to me- If you<br/>\ncould be a famous Military leader from the past who would you be?<br/>\n     I think my answer at this point would be possibly split between Ieyasu<br/>\nTokugawa and Erwin Rommel.<br/>\n     My first choice, Ieyasu Tokugawa was the first Shogun of Japan;<br/>\naccording to my research, he united Japan; I could elaborate but in fairness<br/>\nthis could be a seperate e-mail.<br/>\n     My second choice, Erwin Rommel, known as the Desert Fox, again<br/>\naccording to my research, was one of Hitler&#39;s smartest generals.<br/>\n       There you have my answer to the question, what&#39;s your answer?<br/>\n        I&#39;d be glad to answer any questions or hear any comments.<br/>\n         I closing, I just though it might be interesting or fun to see what<br/>\nanswers turned up.<br/>\n        Hope to hear from you soon,<br/>\n            Shadow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n---<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!

Good compromise?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Being an ex-tanker, Patton is always a choice...love<br/>\n&gt; that guy.

What<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; fascinating man! I&#39;d love to walk in his shoes for a<br/>\n&gt; little while, see what went on in his mind. He, in<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; mind, was the absolute master at integrating<br/>\n&gt; tactical,<br/>\n&gt; operational, and strategic levels of warfare. Just<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; glimpse into his decision making process, his<br/>\n&gt; analysis, his IPB...wow. I&#39;d say Hashiba Hideyoshi<br/>\n&gt; would be another good choice--not Toyotomi, but<br/>\n&gt; Hashiba Hideyoshi, so I could examine his<br/>\n&gt; commander/subordinate relationship with Nobunaga,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; figure out why these two opposites worked so well<br/>\n&gt; together. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my two yen...it is a rather silly, yet<br/>\n&gt; interesting question.

It&#39;s all in good fun, don&#39;t try to read<br/>\ntoo much into it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, here goes. I&#39;ve got many choices (and by the<br/>\nway, I&#39;m reading this as who would I wish to have the<br/>\nsame circumstances befall me historically and try to<br/>\nlive up to what they did. Good compromise?)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing an ex-tanker, Patton is always a choice...love<br/>\nthat guy. Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse, just to see<br/>\nCuster&#39;s face as an arrow went through his<br/>\nhead...(despite my being a member of 7th Cavalry<br/>\nRegiment...Garryowen in Glory) Maybe MacArthur or<br/>\nRidgeway, to see the Korean War ended right, unlike<br/>\nthe situation now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have to say my top choice would be Oda Nobunaga,<br/>\nand not just because we&#39;re on the Samurai list. What a<br/>\nfascinating man! I&#39;d love to walk in his shoes for a<br/>\nlittle while, see what went on in his mind. He, in my<br/>\nmind, was the absolute master at integrating tactical,<br/>\noperational, and strategic levels of warfare. Just to<br/>\nglimpse into his decision making process, his<br/>\nanalysis, his IPB...wow. I&#39;d say Hashiba Hideyoshi<br/>\nwould be another good choice--not Toyotomi, but<br/>\nHashiba Hideyoshi, so I could examine his<br/>\ncommander/subordinate relationship with Nobunaga, and<br/>\nfigure out why these two opposites worked so well<br/>\ntogether. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two yen...it is a rather silly, yet<br/>\ninteresting question. C&#39;mon, Tony...don&#39;t be so<br/>\nanalytical!!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
