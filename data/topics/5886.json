The word &quot;Mail&quot; comes from Latin via medieval<br/>\nFrench, and it can<br/>\nbe translated as &quot;net&quot; or &quot;mesh&quot;, its full of holes<br/>\nand you simply take<br/>\nyour thread and loop it round a bit of the mail<br/>\n&quot;tying&quot; it to the cloth.<br/>\nIt&#39;ll become obvious when you see a real kote up<br/>\nclose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    4.

My Lames are about 1.5&quot; wide x <br/>\n&gt;    2.5&quot; high 10gauge stainless steal.(free from work) I need to learn <br/>\n&gt;    some better methods on lacing them together. I don&#39;t think i have <br/>\n&gt;    enough hole punch in each lame? Website&#39;s don&#39;t really go into <br/>\n&gt;    detail on putting more than 2 lames together.(that sucks) Anyway, <br/>\n&gt;    if you have a good technique on lacing Lame armor, please let me <br/>\n&gt;    know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I feel a major work coming on, sorry, go look at the real thing.<br/>\nAlso try getting hold of a book entitled:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Manufacture of Helmets and Armour in 16th Century Japan&quot; by<br/>\nSekikabara Kozan translated by H.R.Robinson, and look at the diagrams in<br/>\nthe back...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, re your other email, as to tools, again I suggest find<br/>\nyourself a friendly local armourer and get their advice. Tony&#39;s website,<br/>\nwhich Paul has given you will help you if you can&#39;t find someone to talk<br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m off to do all the other things that I&#39;m supposed to be<br/>\ndoing, good luck with your project.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nDean Wayland<br/>\nHead Of The Fight School<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk</a></div>",

We were lucky enough to<br/>\nhave access to the Wade collection (Snowshill Manor) several years ago<br/>\n(&#39;95-&#39;96), and we&#39;d stay over in the Manor for week-ends on the trot,<br/>\nstudying, sketching and pulling our hair out, but it was worth it. Plus<br/>\nIan spent a day with us there explaining everything, in collaboration<br/>\nwith Mike Jessop the then curator. Sadly the collection is currently not<br/>\non display as they are doing a lot of refurbishment to the building and<br/>\nno one has any idea what&#39;s going to happen to the arms and armour. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW for those of you who have a copy of Ian and Jock&#39;s book &quot;Arms and<br/>\nArmour of the Samurai&quot;, the two-page picture just before the title page<br/>\nwas taken in the then &quot;Green&quot; room at Snowshill, an amazing collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark, to re-enforce what Paul says, there is NO substitute for getting<br/>\nyour hands on real armour, so get yourself off to a museum with a<br/>\ncollection, contact the curator and tell him/her what you&#39;re doing and<br/>\nask to have a hands on introduction. Don&#39;t be too disappointed if you<br/>\nhave to try several, or if they restrict what you can see or handle.<br/>\nThis is only to be expected with stuff that is quite often delicate. The<br/>\nother places to visit include arms fairs, where this stuff is up for<br/>\nsale, I spent many a happy hour or six wandering around learning as I<br/>\nwent. Finally if you can afford it, one technique is to buy bits of the<br/>\nreal thing, study it, then sell it on and buy something else, repeat<br/>\nuntil happy, broke or both.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nIn message &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:20041110082850.9019.qmail@...\">20041110082850.9019.qmail@...</a>&gt;,<br/>\nRichardson Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:umaryu@...\">umaryu@...</a>&gt; writes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    HI<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    some of the info you need is on www.sengokudaimyo.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    this site is one for making toy version a (full size)<br/>\n&gt;    out of cardboard.<br/>\n&gt;    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fsinet.or.jp/~usa/indexus.html\">http://www.fsinet.or.jp/~usa/indexus.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    The template for the koe is quite good but you may<br/>\n&gt;    need to alter it.

Sucks you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;    have time. I have my first child coming in 1-2 weeks<br/>\n&gt;    so i&#39;ll probably understand what you mean. Oh well, i<br/>\n&gt;    thought i&#39;d ask anyways. (you sure,...???? $$$$$$)<br/>\n&gt;    Let&#39;s keep it at that for now, but if you change your<br/>\n&gt;    mind u have my e-mail. Back to that first e-mail u<br/>\n&gt;    sent me about stitching the armor to the<br/>\n&gt;    fabrics...,...a couple more ?&#39;s then i&#39;ll stop<br/>\n&gt;    bothering u for advice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe?<br/>\n&gt;    Outer Layer(that&#39;s what you see on the outsite), a<br/>\n&gt;    layer of Cloth Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can<br/>\n&gt;    a get that?what size?, a layer of Very Very Very Thin<br/>\n&gt;    Leather(goes under hemp layer), and then the Inner<br/>\n&gt;    Shell(goes under v v v thin leather)?is this layer<br/>\n&gt;    leather? do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it<br/>\n&gt;    and then mold it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the<br/>\n&gt;    whole way down the entire KOTE and stay flexable?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    2. I understand stitching the mail down but about the<br/>\n&gt;    plates.. How do sew them down. You talked about a<br/>\n&gt;    &quot;running stitch&quot;???what&#39;s that? i&#39;m not a sewer. Do a<br/>\n&gt;    sew through the metal? Do i predrill little holes?? I<br/>\n&gt;    don&#39;t understand that part. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle<br/>\n&gt;    of a solid panal of mail? <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions on<br/>\n&gt;    how to lace lames together????? I just can&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt;    get it right. My armor is all flimsy and isn&#39;t very<br/>\n&gt;    rigid. My Lames are about 1.5&quot; wide x 2.5&quot; high<br/>\n&gt;    10gauge stainless steal.(free from work) I need to<br/>\n&gt;    learn some better methods on lacing them together.

I haven&#39;t done much building myself,<br/>\n&gt;    my eyesight is<br/>\n&gt;    really bad but I did lead a project to make an armour,<br/>\n&gt;    for one of my<br/>\n&gt;    friends. As I said in my reply, I was taking the<br/>\n&gt;    opportunity to get some<br/>\n&gt;    of the data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a<br/>\n&gt;    few of the<br/>\n&gt;    pictures of our &quot;work in progress&quot; posted to my web<br/>\n&gt;    site, with a short<br/>\n&gt;    explanation. When I do I&#39;ll post the news here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Meanwhile, to give you an idea of what you could be<br/>\n&gt;    letting yourself in<br/>\n&gt;    for: I started researching back in 1986, started<br/>\n&gt;    seriously sorting out<br/>\n&gt;    the building in 1994 and we still haven&#39;t finished the<br/>\n&gt;    dam thing yet! In<br/>\n&gt;    the end we more or less gave up, until last year, when<br/>\n&gt;    we got our butts<br/>\n&gt;    off the deck and knuckled down to doing some more<br/>\n&gt;    research and work<br/>\n&gt;    (that awful little four letter word). All the parts we<br/>\n&gt;    had half done<br/>\n&gt;    were finished, and we started to look around for a<br/>\n&gt;    decent smith who<br/>\n&gt;    could make the other parts for us instead, otherwise<br/>\n&gt;    Andrew, the friend<br/>\n&gt;    in question will be long in his grave by the time we<br/>\n&gt;    actually finish it! <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    For myself, earlier this year I gave in and bought a<br/>\n&gt;    Japanese festival<br/>\n&gt;    armour as a sort of stop-gap, I was sick of the great<br/>\n&gt;    theoretical<br/>\n&gt;    armour, I wanted the real thing, well I got it, er..<br/>\n&gt;    sort of. The<br/>\n&gt;    replica in question is way under weight and needs a<br/>\n&gt;    lot of work, just to<br/>\n&gt;    make it serviceable, but a whole lot less than<br/>\n&gt;    starting from scratch.<br/>\n&gt;    But I do intend to replace it with something much<br/>\n&gt;    better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    The problem was we started with the idea of doing it<br/>\n&gt;    as right as<br/>\n&gt;    possible, but of necessity we had to make compromises<br/>\n&gt;    as we went along,<br/>\n&gt;    which no doubt you will probably have to do as well.<br/>\n&gt;    For example we<br/>\n&gt;    didn&#39;t use urushi (Japanese lacquer), due to its cost<br/>\n&gt;    and toxicity. And<br/>\n&gt;    when we did the kote (armoured sleeve), kohire<br/>\n&gt;    (&quot;little-fin&quot; brigendine<br/>\n&gt;    shoulder guards) and the tate-eri (&quot;shield-collar&quot;) we<br/>\n&gt;    had to use<br/>\n&gt;    American doe skin as we couldn&#39;t get the right thing<br/>\n&gt;    from Japan. Now, we<br/>\n&gt;    can and the guys who did the sewing are cursing a lot<br/>\n&gt;    as they know that<br/>\n&gt;    I&#39;m going to &quot;persuade&quot; them to replace it. The dou<br/>\n&gt;    (body armour) we had<br/>\n&gt;    made is in russet 2mm steel and does look amazing, but<br/>\n&gt;    it doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;    any gessan yet, but I hope to have that sorted out<br/>\n&gt;    sometime soon, as<br/>\n&gt;    Michael who answered your first email does make armour<br/>\n&gt;    in his spare time<br/>\n&gt;    (spare time? a misnomer I think, would you not agree<br/>\n&gt;    Michael?).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Anyway I wish you the best of luck, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;    currently be of<br/>\n&gt;    more help, but as soon as I&#39;ve got the stuff up on the<br/>\n&gt;    net I&#39;ll let you<br/>\n&gt;    know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    All the best<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Yours<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Dean<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    ***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    In message<br/>\n&gt;    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:20041109030428.71697.qmail@...\">20041109030428.71697.qmail@...</a>&gt;,<br/>\n&gt;    mark kd<br/>\n&gt;    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:depos42300@...\">depos42300@...</a>&gt; writes<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    hi,<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;      Thank you very much for this info.

Well, i was thinking<br/>\n&gt;    that the next time <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    you made samurai armor, you could catalog the<br/>\n&gt;    process for <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    me.(detailed pics and notes). I&#39;m not asking you<br/>\n&gt;    to do it for me <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    for free if that&#39;s what your thinking. I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;    gladly $pay$ you for <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    your time.(for the pics & notes). I know it might<br/>\n&gt;    be asking a bit <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    much but if your interested please let me know. I<br/>\n&gt;    really want to <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    make samurai armor but i&#39;m affraid of screwing it<br/>\n&gt;    all up cause i <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    don&#39;t have a lot of info on how to make it. All i<br/>\n&gt;    got is a lot of <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    pics of full-scale size armor and not a lot of<br/>\n&gt;    detailed pics on how <br/>\n&gt;    &gt;    it all goes together.

I haven&#39;t done much building myself,<br/>\nmy eyesight is<br/>\nreally bad but I did lead a project to make an armour,<br/>\nfor one of my<br/>\nfriends. As I said in my reply, I was taking the<br/>\nopportunity to get some<br/>\nof the data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a<br/>\nfew of the<br/>\npictures of our &quot;work in progress&quot; posted to my web<br/>\nsite, with a short<br/>\nexplanation. When I do I&#39;ll post the news here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, to give you an idea of what you could be<br/>\nletting yourself in<br/>\nfor: I started researching back in 1986, started<br/>\nseriously sorting out<br/>\nthe building in 1994 and we still haven&#39;t finished the<br/>\ndam thing yet! In<br/>\nthe end we more or less gave up, until last year, when<br/>\nwe got our butts<br/>\noff the deck and knuckled down to doing some more<br/>\nresearch and work<br/>\n(that awful little four letter word). All the parts we<br/>\nhad half done<br/>\nwere finished, and we started to look around for a<br/>\ndecent smith who<br/>\ncould make the other parts for us instead, otherwise<br/>\nAndrew, the friend<br/>\nin question will be long in his grave by the time we<br/>\nactually finish it! <br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, earlier this year I gave in and bought a<br/>\nJapanese festival<br/>\narmour as a sort of stop-gap, I was sick of the great<br/>\ntheoretical<br/>\narmour, I wanted the real thing, well I got it, er..<br/>\nsort of. The<br/>\nreplica in question is way under weight and needs a<br/>\nlot of work, just to<br/>\nmake it serviceable, but a whole lot less than<br/>\nstarting from scratch.<br/>\nBut I do intend to replace it with something much<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem was we started with the idea of doing it<br/>\nas right as<br/>\npossible, but of necessity we had to make compromises<br/>\nas we went along,<br/>\nwhich no doubt you will probably have to do as well.<br/>\nFor example we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t use urushi (Japanese lacquer), due to its cost<br/>\nand toxicity. And<br/>\nwhen we did the kote (armoured sleeve), kohire<br/>\n(&quot;little-fin&quot; brigendine<br/>\nshoulder guards) and the tate-eri (&quot;shield-collar&quot;) we<br/>\nhad to use<br/>\nAmerican doe skin as we couldn&#39;t get the right thing<br/>\nfrom Japan. Now, we<br/>\ncan and the guys who did the sewing are cursing a lot<br/>\nas they know that<br/>\nI&#39;m going to &quot;persuade&quot; them to replace it. The dou<br/>\n(body armour) we had<br/>\nmade is in russet 2mm steel and does look amazing, but<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nany gessan yet, but I hope to have that sorted out<br/>\nsometime soon, as<br/>\nMichael who answered your first email does make armour<br/>\nin his spare time<br/>\n(spare time? a misnomer I think, would you not agree<br/>\nMichael?).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I wish you the best of luck, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t<br/>\ncurrently be of<br/>\nmore help, but as soon as I&#39;ve got the stuff up on the<br/>\nnet I&#39;ll let you<br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn message<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:20041109030428.71697.qmail@...\">20041109030428.71697.qmail@...</a>&gt;,<br/>\nmark kd<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:depos42300@...\">depos42300@...</a>&gt; writes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    hi,<br/>\n&gt;      Thank you very much for this info.

I have my first child coming in 1-2 weeks so i&#39;ll probably understand what you mean. Oh well, i thought i&#39;d ask anyways. (you sure,...???? $$$$$$) Let&#39;s keep it at that for now, but if you change your mind u have my e-mail. Back to that first e-mail u sent me about stitching the armor to the fabrics...,...a couple more ?&#39;s then i&#39;ll stop bothering u for advice.<br/>\n <br/>\n 1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe? Outer Layer(that&#39;s what you see on the outsite), a layer of Cloth Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can a get that?what size?, a layer of Very Very Very Thin Leather(goes under hemp layer), and then the Inner Shell(goes under v v v thin leather)?is this layer leather? do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it and then mold it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the whole way down the entire KOTE and stay flexable?<br/>\n <br/>\n2. I understand stitching the mail down but about the plates.. How do sew them down. You talked about a &quot;running stitch&quot;???what&#39;s that? i&#39;m not a sewer. Do a sew through the metal? Do i predrill little holes?? I don&#39;t understand that part. <br/>\n <br/>\n3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle of a solid panal of mail? <br/>\n <br/>\n4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions on how to lace lames together????? I just can&#39;t seem to get it right. My armor is all flimsy and isn&#39;t very rigid. My Lames are about 1.5&quot; wide x 2.5&quot; high 10gauge stainless steal.(free from work) I need to learn some better methods on lacing them together.

And<br/>\nwhen we did the kote (armoured sleeve), kohire (&quot;little-fin&quot; brigendine<br/>\nshoulder guards) and the tate-eri (&quot;shield-collar&quot;) we had to use<br/>\nAmerican doe skin as we couldn&#39;t get the right thing from Japan. Now, we<br/>\ncan and the guys who did the sewing are cursing a lot as they know that<br/>\nI&#39;m going to &quot;persuade&quot; them to replace it. The dou (body armour) we had<br/>\nmade is in russet 2mm steel and does look amazing, but it doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nany gessan yet, but I hope to have that sorted out sometime soon, as<br/>\nMichael who answered your first email does make armour in his spare time<br/>\n(spare time? a misnomer I think, would you not agree Michael?).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I wish you the best of luck, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t currently be of<br/>\nmore help, but as soon as I&#39;ve got the stuff up on the net I&#39;ll let you<br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn message &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:20041109030428.71697.qmail@...\">20041109030428.71697.qmail@...</a>&gt;, mark kd<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:depos42300@...\">depos42300@...</a>&gt; writes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    hi,<br/>\n&gt;      Thank you very much for this info.

Firstly make up all the platework and use the mail (kusari) to join<br/>\nup all the parts, paint it (don&#39;t forget to under-coat it). <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW As a guide the mail is very fine, meaning the holes in the plates<br/>\nare about 1/4&quot; or 7mm centre to centre and about 1.2 in diameter. The<br/>\nround &quot;rings&quot; that lay flat should be made of about 0.8-1.0 mm wire,<br/>\nwhile the oval &quot;links&quot; that stand on their long edges should be thinner<br/>\nat around 0.6-0.9mm. The diameter for the mandrel around which you wrap<br/>\nyour wire, should be about 3-4mm. You can make the oval rings by taking<br/>\nthe uncut coil of round rings and squeezing them to shape in a vice,<br/>\nthen cut them off as per normal. This kusari is comparatively weak along<br/>\nside European mail, but it isn&#39;t required to be structurally sound, as<br/>\nits job is to stop sharp things slicing bits of you off, which as it is<br/>\nsupported by the textiles beneath, it does very well indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Ideally make up a simple wooden &quot;picture&quot; style frame, to which you<br/>\ncan pin the fabric, to hold it firmly in place, while letting you work<br/>\non it from either side. This frame is invaluable.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Now lay your middle layer of hemp over the frame, and then cover that<br/>\nwith your chosen outer shell, now pin them to the frame. If you can&#39;t<br/>\nget hemp or indeed afford it, use corse linen. Do NOT put the inner<br/>\nshell in position yet, nor should you cut it to shape. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Lay your metal work on the section in the middle, and use a few pins<br/>\nto initially hold it in place.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Okay, now we start sewing. Don&#39;t panic, you do not need to sew every<br/>\npiece down with a separate set of stitching, the old armourers were very<br/>\ncunning, particularly when it came to mass production. Use a simple<br/>\nrunning stitch around the outside edges, so that on the plates you end<br/>\nup with alternate little 7mm sections of thread with blank space in<br/>\nbetween. And to secure the mail, just take your needle from the back to<br/>\nthe front, and go around that edge of the oval &quot;link&quot; that&#39;s lying<br/>\nagainst the fabric and back through your cloth. In effect you are<br/>\ncreating little loops to hold the mail in place. Do NOT sew the round<br/>\n&quot;rings&quot; down, this will pull the armour in too tight making it sort of<br/>\nshrink and become stiffer, not a good idea, as we found out, we had to<br/>\nsew one kote twice:-(<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW we had to do another twice because the chap used white linen thread<br/>\non black armour, laid upon a dark blue foundation. We swapped it for<br/>\nblack linen, as it looked much better, so choose your thread wisely.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Around the elbow section, where there is often lots of mail, but few<br/>\nplates (an elbow cap and maybe up to five tiny semi-circular plates in<br/>\norbit around it), and assuming you&#39;ve sewn the edges as stated in &quot;5&quot;<br/>\nabove, just sew the links around the plates themselves, put in a running<br/>\nstitch across the middle of the solid panel of mail, let the rest float<br/>\nfree for ease of movement. If you go for the style of open work mail on<br/>\nthe inside of the elbow, you&#39;ll need to go around the &quot;links&quot; of each<br/>\nopen section to stop it from flapping about.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Now comes the trick. With all these running stitches you would think<br/>\none breakage and your armour will fall off! Not so, turn the armour over<br/>\nso you are looking at the inside and all those vunrible threads. You<br/>\nthen give it a wipe over with thin glue. I believe the Japanese used a<br/>\nglue made from rice paste or possibly a fish based one (Tony, Michael?).<br/>\nWhen it dries, the armour will be very stiff, but after a very, very<br/>\nshort while, it&#39;ll loosen up. The idea is that if a thread breaks then<br/>\nits prevented from unravelling by the glue, thus saving you hours and<br/>\nhours of unnecessary sewing:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n8. At this point you&#39;ll probably want to touch up the paint work before<br/>\ntaking it off the frame for shaping.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Pin your inner shell to the armour and cut it to shape (sorry I would<br/>\nneed lots of pictures here to show you how, refer to Tony&#39;s pages for<br/>\nguidance). Having got it to the right shape take the inner shell off<br/>\nagain and put it aside for the time being.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Get some very very thin leather. Ideally you should use the kind of<br/>\nJapanese leather made for the task, as it is not only thin, but has<br/>\nlittle or no stretchiness. Cut it in to a long narrow strip about 20mm<br/>\nacross. If it has a stencilled pattern on it you will need to start<br/>\nsewing it to the edge with its outside face flat against the outside of<br/>\nthe kote fabric, so you are seeing its reverse side. Put its edge in<br/>\nline with the edge of the kote, so it lays inboard of the edge. Now sew<br/>\nalong the outside edge. <br/>\n<br/>\n11. Put in any ties or toggles (kohaze) etc that you need at this point.<br/>\nBut not the cord that closes the kote into a tube shape.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Take your inner shell place it against the inside of your kote, and<br/>\nfold the leather trim over itself and around the back of the inside of<br/>\nthe kote. By doing this you hide the stitching that holds the leather in<br/>\nplace and reveals the stencilled pattern of the leather (if it has one).<br/>\nNow, sew through the front of the kote and the leather (on the back) as<br/>\nclose to the leather as you can get. Don&#39;t use tiny stitches, use big<br/>\nones 1/4&quot;-3/8&quot;(7-10mm). The idea being that when you&#39;ve finished there<br/>\nshould be little exposed stitching that can be caught as you put your<br/>\narm in and out, while at the same time leaving it easy to open the kote<br/>\nup to do repairs. If you want to be a bit classy you can apply a 1/8th<br/>\n(3mm) herring bone patterned braid up against the edge of the leather,<br/>\nmaking the stitching practically invisible.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. Finally put in the cords that hold the kote shut, again refer to<br/>\nTony&#39;s pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough not cheap, for Japanese leather, silk braid etc. see Trevor&#39;s<br/>\nrestoration pages at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.toraba.com\">http://www.toraba.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBTW Tony, I&#39;ve no idea if you cover all of this stuff on your pages, but<br/>\nas I needed to write this up for myself, I thought I&#39;d use the<br/>\nopportunity, and then share it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hope this is useful<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn message &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:20041107174053.94013.qmail@...\">20041107174053.94013.qmail@...</a>&gt;, mark kd<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:depos42300@...\">depos42300@...</a>&gt; writes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;    hello everyone,<br/>\n&gt;      i was wondering if anyone could tell me what clothe material was <br/>\n&gt;    used on the KOTE of samurai armour.

Put its edge in<br/>\nline with the edge of the kote, so it lays inboard of the edge. Now sew<br/>\nalong the outside edge. <br/>\n<br/>\n11. Put in any ties or toggles (kohaze) etc that you need at this point.<br/>\nBut not the cord that closes the kote into a tube shape.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Take your inner shell place it against the inside of your kote, and<br/>\nfold the leather trim over itself and around the back of the inside of<br/>\nthe kote. By doing this you hide the stitching that holds the leather in<br/>\nplace and reveals the stencilled pattern of the leather (if it has one).<br/>\nNow, sew through the front of the kote and the leather (on the back) as<br/>\nclose to the leather as you can get. Don&#39;t use tiny stitches, use big<br/>\nones 1/4&quot;-3/8&quot;(7-10mm). The idea being that when you&#39;ve finished there<br/>\nshould be little exposed stitching that can be caught as you put your<br/>\narm in and out, while at the same time leaving it easy to open the kote<br/>\nup to do repairs. If you want to be a bit classy you can apply a 1/8th<br/>\n(3mm) herring bone patterned braid up against the edge of the leather,<br/>\nmaking the stitching practically invisible.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. Finally put in the cords that hold the kote shut, again refer to<br/>\nTony&#39;s pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough not cheap, for Japanese leather, silk braid etc. see Trevor&#39;s<br/>\nrestoration pages at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.toraba.com\">http://www.toraba.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBTW Tony, I&#39;ve no idea if you cover all of this stuff on your pages, but<br/>\nas I needed to write this up for myself, I thought I&#39;d use the<br/>\nopportunity, and then share it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hope this is useful<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn message &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:20041107174053.94013.qmail@...\">20041107174053.94013.qmail@...</a>&gt;, mark kd<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:depos42300@...\">depos42300@...</a>&gt; writes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;    hello everyone,<br/>\n&gt;      i was wondering if anyone could tell me what clothe material was <br/>\n&gt;    used on the KOTE of samurai armour.
