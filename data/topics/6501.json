Did the<br/>\nMatsudaira (they weren&#39;t the Tokugawa yet) do what<br/>\nImagawa Yoshimoto told them to do? Yes. Ieyasu was a<br/>\nhostage at Sumpu, and unless they wanted him back in<br/>\npieces they didn&#39;t have a choice. Did they do it out<br/>\nof loyalty to the Imagawa? Most decidely not. They<br/>\ncaptivity of their young lord was a sore point for<br/>\nmany Mikawa bushi, from what I&#39;ve read. Loyalty, to<br/>\nme, implies a desire to serve. I doubt many Matsudaira<br/>\nfelt any desire to serve the Imagawa.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!

The Ii took the<br/>\nidea, I believe, from the troops of Yamagata<br/>\nMasakage--I could be wrong on the name.

Prior to that, it was mainly only a concern to<br/>\nequip your men with whatever you could--buying<br/>\nmatching sets of armor gets expensive.

I suppose. Not likely--at that point,<br/>\nit&#39;d be enough just to make sure they all had armor of<br/>\nsome sort.
