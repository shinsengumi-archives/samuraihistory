They would have needed to transport  supplies by sea, no<br/>\nmean feat in those days with storms etc. Although Nate made the valid point<br/>\nthat the sailors would have been Chinese and Koreans, who were excellent<br/>\nseafarers. I still think it would have been a mammoth task. They would have<br/>\nbeen dependent on good weather and as the &quot;Divine wind&quot; proved, you cant<br/>\nrely on that.

But individual<br/>\nmounted archers didn&#39;t fare so well against clouds of<br/>\narrows launched by mass formations of Mongols, as the<br/>\nsamurai found out to their chagrin. Nor did the<br/>\nMongols respond to well to a samurai riding out,<br/>\nshouting his lineage, and challenging them to<br/>\nindividual combat. They had to adapt, and did so. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
