Too<br/>\n&gt; strong of a &quot;national&quot; movement (in the sense of it<br/>\n&gt; being spread throughout the populace almost<br/>\n&gt; nationwide, rather than being a political force in the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;national&quot; capital), I think. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   That being the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; case, they {the Enryakuji, et al} are as <br/>\n&gt; &gt; much an impediment to one uniting the country as an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enemy daimyo.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hence their destruction at the hands of Nobunaga.<br/>\n&gt; While most still held some respect for their religious<br/>\n&gt; position, Nobunaga simply saw them as an impediment to<br/>\n&gt; political consolidation (under himself, of course!). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   In <br/>\n&gt; &gt; which case you either work with them or against<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them.

Um...most likely, confirming their land<br/>\n&gt; holdings, possibly/probably giving them more, and<br/>\n&gt; trying to convince them to at least not attack you<br/>\n&gt; from behind, if not help against your enemies. Same<br/>\n&gt; things you do to get another daimyo on your<br/>\n&gt; side--convince him helping you is to his advantage<br/>\n&gt; with land and stuff. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But all that is just a side question/comment to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; original - which <br/>\n&gt; &gt; was what would the most likely event be if someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else not as <br/>\n&gt; &gt; completely and utterly iron fisted against the Ikko<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ikki et all as <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga had tried to unify the country.

They are almost like a hydra, every time you cut off a head, <br/>\ntwo more grow back - just like any good fanatical religious <br/>\nmovement.  I think Nobunaga did the only thing that would have really <br/>\nworked - wipe them off the map - because they had been independent <br/>\nand growing for so long, I doubt they would have bowed to anyone, <br/>\nhence the idle thought of a semi-theocracy - but not so much to teach <br/>\nand force religion, but just so that they could consolodate political <br/>\npower and thier own lands, profits, and holdings, etc.</div>",

This said, other than the Hokke-ikko of the 1530s, none of the sects marched on the capital with an eye to its capture and the installation of a national regime based upon any particular sect&#39;s beliefs. Even Nichiren in the 13th century did not oppose the Shogun because of his authority, but objected to the bakufu&#39;s<br/>\n alleged slander of the Dharma. Opposition was one thing; outright theocracy (in terms of Iran, or at a push the Vatican City State) was a step the sects didn&#39;t (at least openly) contemplate.<br/>\nM.Lorimer<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kitsuno &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samurai-listowner@...\">samurai-listowner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; C&#39;mon, there are plenty of theoretical cases where<br/>\n&gt; this could happen. <br/>\n&gt; Someone gets to Kyoto with the assistance of the<br/>\n&gt; Honganji, for <br/>\n&gt; example and in return for the title of Shogun, the<br/>\n&gt; Shogun is &quot;given&quot; <br/>\n&gt; monastic advisors and keeps funds flowing to the<br/>\n&gt; monasteries around <br/>\n&gt; the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having monks as &quot;advisers&quot; is different from a<br/>\ntheocracy--though if a national government based on<br/>\nreligious beliefs is a theocracy, then wasn&#39;t Japan a<br/>\ntheocracy anyways?
