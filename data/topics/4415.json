            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-262064240\">HI<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to Kublacon in Burlingame, CA this weekend to find someone to play<br/>\nClan War with me. I brought over 28mm 1500 Clan War figures to Kublacon this<br/>\nweekend, each and everyone was at the pro-painted level. Lots of interest<br/>\nbut no one brought their Clans with them to play or were ready to play with<br/>\nmy figures. It seems that Clan War is dead on the West Coast. And that&#39;s a<br/>\nreal shame because I enjoyed playing it very much.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, as a historical miniatures player, I was always disappointed that<br/>\nmost Clan War players never took the time to paint their armies. Maybe<br/>\nthat&#39;s why a lot of the historical players by-passed the game system and<br/>\njust purchased the figures to create their samurai armies and used other<br/>\nrules systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played WAB and Katana. A lot of the former Clan War players in my area<br/>\nare getting their armies converted over to Warhammer Ancient Battles. Our<br/>\nsamurai are awesome in WAB. So if you can&#39;t find any Clan War players at the<br/>\nnext CON you attend, maybe you should look at putting together a WAB Samurai<br/>\nlist. At least you&#39;ll be able to field your army on the tabletop and you&#39;ll<br/>\nget some use out of them. Also, be sure you take the time to paint your<br/>\nfigures.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son offered to display a pro-painted level ion / Crane / Crab /<br/>\nUnicorn / Dragon / Yoritomo armies he was ignored by the guys who put on the<br/>\nLegends of the 5 Rings card game. I guess the lead figures are  no longer of<br/>\ninterest to the WofC folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a chance to chat with Jervis Johnson this weekend at Kublacon in<br/>\nBurlingame, CA (SF Bay Area) and discuss Samurais in WAB. He pointed out<br/>\nthat it&#39;s not too often that a games author gets to do something special in<br/>\na rules set. He loves the Japanese armies and of course the movie Seven<br/>\nSamurai and the 47 Ronin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai are an unbalanced army in WAB but there will be a new Samurai list<br/>\nas soon as Robert figures out what he wants to put it, maybe next summer at<br/>\nthe earliest/latest. Jervis states that he will make changes as needed, but<br/>\nsees no need to make any further changes at this time to the Samurai Army<br/>\nList.<br/>\n<br/>\nJervis points out that war is never balanced. Real world or historical<br/>\narmies are/were never tweaked until they are equal on the battlefield. The<br/>\nbest general is the one who takes what he has to fight with and uses his<br/>\nskills to achieve victory. If an Egyptian goes up against a Samurai Army and<br/>\npulls a draw or a victory, then it&#39;s a well earned victory. However, if you<br/>\nthe Samurai Army commander fails to achieve victory, then it says something<br/>\nabout your understanding of how to use Samurai properly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo use what you have to your best advantage in your next WAB tournament.<br/>\nExploit all the strengths that your WAB Samurai army has to offer. And if<br/>\nyour opponent loses, it&#39;s not because he has the best army, it&#39;s because he<br/>\nlet his fear of your army list defeat him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yes, I did get both of my WAB books autographed by Jervis.<br/>\n<br/>\nBANZAI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
