Who knew?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other range from, well, SAMURAI-ARCHIVES.COM (I<br/>\nwas really tempted to post THAT for you, he he) to<br/>\nsome pages claiming Hojo Soun was a model samurai and<br/>\na textbook practitioner of Bushido (this from the same<br/>\nsite that COMPLETELY butchers the Chushingura<br/>\nstory--did you know the 47 ronin killed the Shogun?<br/>\nIt&#39;s true--I saw it on the web). One excerpt I found<br/>\nfollows:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; 1507-51 <br/>\n <br/>\nA typical Sengoku daimyo, who rose by his wits <br/>\n<br/>\nSoun founded the &#39;later&#39; Hojo. This clan is to be<br/>\ndistinguished from the Hojo of the Kamukura Period.<br/>\nHis original name was Ise Shinkur�, but he took the<br/>\ntonsure and assumed a monk&#39;s name, Soun. He was<br/>\nprobably born into the Ise family of Kyoto, although<br/>\nthis is not certain and details are unclear. In the<br/>\nSengoku Period there were many who rose to prominence<br/>\nfrom humble beginnings, and so whose early life is not<br/>\nrecorded. Skill in war assured such men a place among<br/>\nthe &#39;upstart&#39; daimyo class. <br/>\nSoun won the trust of the Imagawa when he interceded<br/>\nin their internal familial disputes. He was given<br/>\ncharge of Kokokuji Castle, which had a strategic<br/>\nlocation guarding the Kanto. In 1491, he built<br/>\nNirayama Castle to reside in. Soun gained control of<br/>\nIzu, and took Odawara Castle in Sagami, thus mounting<br/>\nthe first step in the unification of the Kanto. He<br/>\norganised the development of towns around his castles,<br/>\nconducted land surveys, and laying the foundations of<br/>\nlong-lasting rule. <br/>\nIn 1518, control of his house was usurped by Hojo<br/>\nUjitsuna. Soun died the following year at Nirayama<br/>\naged 88. He was regarded as a calm and honest man who<br/>\nwould rather govern in peace than attack, and he is<br/>\nsaid to have been love by his people. He rose from<br/>\nbeing a nameless wanderer to being the master of the<br/>\nentire states of Izu and Sagami through his wits, and<br/>\nhis efforts ensured Hojo rule for five generations and<br/>\nover a century. He was also a man of great physical<br/>\nbeauty, without which none of this might have been<br/>\npossible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sengoku-expo.net/text/person/E/172.html\">http://www.sengoku-expo.net/text/person/E/172.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t aware that Soun&#39;s son, Ujitsuna, &quot;usurped&quot;<br/>\npower. Takeda Shingen, yeah, he usurped power from his<br/>\nfather. My recollection is that Soun retired while he<br/>\ncould &quot;mentor&quot; his son, and that became a practice in<br/>\nthe Go-Hojo family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m next going to hit Japanese Google, but I think you<br/>\nmay be out of luck when YOUR website is the best<br/>\nsource on the web in English--fabulous accomplishment,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s not going to help YOUR knowledge that much!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
