The study focuses<br/>\nparticularly on the policies and actions of Nobunaga during the<br/>\nyears of his national ascendancy, 1568-82.  Mr. Lamers has<br/>\nconsulted a wide range of contemporary sources: in addition to<br/>\nnumerous official documents, these include the Shincho Kyou-ki<br/>\nby Oota Gyuuichi, Nobunaga&#39;s first chronicler, the Jesuit<br/>\nrecords, and diaries like the Kanemi Kyou-ki and Tokitsugu<br/>\nKyou-ki.  Mr.  Lamers has also taken full measure of the works<br/>\nof Japanese and western historians in his treatment of thisimportant <br/>\nfigure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis monograph contributes in several important ways to the<br/>\nliterature on Nobunaga and sixteenth century Japan.  First, it<br/>\nis the only thorough treatment of Nobunaga&#39;s career and<br/>\nachievements in a western language.  Although we have read about<br/>\nNobunaga, or at least Nobunaga&#39;s policies, in the context of the<br/>\nSengoku period and are aware of his main achievements, it tends<br/>\nto be mainly as a forerunner to Hideyoshi and Ieyasu that he is<br/>\nremembered.  In a full treatment of his life his achievements<br/>\nare better appreciated not only for what came after him but for<br/>\nwhat he achieved in his own times.  Second, we can better<br/>\nappreciate Nobunaga&#39;s genius as a military and especially<br/>\npolitical tactician when we see the tremendous odds against<br/>\nwhich he struggled all his adult life, besieged by enemies on<br/>\nall sides.  Although the Japanese political scene fell into<br/>\ndisarray once Nobunaga was assassinated, his policies and<br/>\ncampaigns had indeed unified great portions of the country by<br/>\nthe time Hideyoshi took control.  In his drive to take Kyoto and<br/>\nin his decision to settle in Azuchi, near but not in the ancient<br/>\ncapital, Nobunaga defined himself as a national leader and not<br/>\nsimply as the head of a coalition of warriors.  Finally, by<br/>\ngiving close attention to the years 1568 through 1573, Mr.<br/>\nLamers shows the Muromachi shogunate under the active leadership<br/>\nof the last shogun, Yoshiaki, to have been much more vital and<br/>\npolitically significant even immediately prior to its demise<br/>\nthan is usually thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Lamers approaches the story of Nobunaga&#39;s life primarily as<br/>\na series of scholarly debates which he presents, analyzes and,<br/>\noften, dismisses in whole or in part.  He then puts forth his<br/>\nown revisionist conclusions, some of which are persuasive and<br/>\ncarefully considered, and certainly demonstrate familiarity with<br/>\nboth Japanese and western scholarship.  Nevertheless, this<br/>\napproach, however valid it may be in a dissertation, imparts a<br/>\npedantic quality to a biography and detracts from what should be<br/>\nthe narrative thrust of Nobunaga&#39;s life.  Some of the scholarly<br/>\njudgments, moreover, come across as excessively dismissive. Asao<br/>\nNaohiro&#39;s thinking on the concept of tenka, for instance, should<br/>\nnot be dismissed out of hand (p. 128) simply because the author<br/>\nis determined to refute the theory of Nobunaga&#39;s<br/>\nself-deification.  It is quite possible, it seems to me, that<br/>\nNobunaga had the intellectual capacity, not to mention political<br/>\nshrewdness, to apply concepts of statehood to his rule.  Mr.<br/>\nLamers, however, seems determined to portray him at all costs asa <br/>\npragmatist.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Lamers has extensively mined contemporary Jesuit writings in<br/>\nhis study.  These are valuable if biased sources, as he reminds<br/>\nthe reader frequently: they record events that corroborate<br/>\nJapanese sources and they contain some descriptions of Japanese<br/>\nlife not found elsewhere, but their interpretation of events is<br/>\noften self-interested.  Unfortunately, Mr. Lamers too frequently<br/>\ngets sidetracked into a determination to undermine these<br/>\nsources, and in the process the narrative of Nobunaga&#39;s life is<br/>\nrelegated to the wings: for instance, the author attacks at<br/>\nlength the Jesuits&#39; portrayal of Nobunaga as a supporter of<br/>\nChristianity, and later refutes Luis Frois&#39; assertion of<br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s self-deification.  Nobunaga&#39;s relationship with the<br/>\nJesuits was indeed one part of his consolidation of power and<br/>\nisolation of certain enemies.  The author might have analyzed it<br/>\nto explicate aspects of Nobunaga&#39;s character germane to his hold<br/>\non power: his shrewdness, his fascination with the unknown and<br/>\nthe exotic, and at the same time his prudence.  Instead, Mr.<br/>\nLamers gets caught up in showing the Jesuits to be vain and<br/>\nmisguided in their belief that Nobunaga supported them.  (This<br/>\nargument, incidentally, turns out to be a non-starter: some of<br/>\nthe sources cited show in fact a very accurate and sober Jesuit<br/>\nunderstanding of Nobunaga&#39;s motives in granting them favorable<br/>\ntreatment.)  Ultimately, the space devoted to critiquing the<br/>\nJesuit sources is disproportionate to this relatively minor<br/>\naspect of Nobunaga&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the subtitle suggests, Mr. Lamers is at pains to challenge<br/>\nthe standard view of Nobunaga as a cruel and brutal tyrant.<br/>\nAgain, he implicates the Jesuits as the original culprits, with<br/>\nthe label sticking even in the most recent scholarship on<br/>\nNobunaga.  To refute this, Mr.  Lamers presents events as they<br/>\nmay have appeared to Nobunaga and argues, often persuasively,<br/>\nthat the actions he took were (simply) those of a pragmatic,<br/>\ndecisive, non-ideological, and extremely ambitious warrior.<br/>\nPerhaps so, but in the end there are enough cases of massive<br/>\nslaughter, deliberate disgrace and humiliation of less worthy<br/>\nvassals, ruthless treatment of enemies, and, to put it mildly,<br/>\niconoclastic treatment of Buddhist groups that the original<br/>\nlabel remains quite apt.  But after all, brutality was<br/>\nwidespread in the sixteenth century, and not only in Japan.  Yet<br/>\nis this the best yardstick by which to assess Nobunaga?  By<br/>\nfocusing so heavily on brutality Mr. Lamers places central<br/>\nemphasis on a moral evaluation of Nobunaga&#39;s character, in the<br/>\nprocess missing other standards by which to consider his place<br/>\nin history.  In his conclusion, which is too mild considering<br/>\nthe weight of the story he has just told, Lamers ends by merely<br/>\nsaying that &quot;the best adjectives to characterise Nobunaga&#39;s rule<br/>\nand personality are not &quot;callous and brutal&quot; but &quot;pragmatic and<br/>\nruthless&quot; (p. 232).  Surely there is more that could be said of<br/>\nthe career and contributions of this brilliant military and<br/>\npolitical tactician.  Mr. Lamers points out that the treatment<br/>\nof Nobunaga by early modern Japanese chroniclers and historians<br/>\nin the early modern period is a huge topic requiring a separate<br/>\nstudy.  Nonetheless, a summary, at least, of the early modern<br/>\nJapanese writings on Nobunaga would have balanced the attention<br/>\ngiven to Jesuit writings, and perhaps helped better define a<br/>\nhistorical niche for Nobunaga.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s reputation as a cruel and ruthless warrior rests in<br/>\npart on his treatment, audacious for its times, of institutional<br/>\nBuddhism.  In 1571 his forces attacked and burned Enryakuji, the<br/>\ngreat Tendai monastery on Mt. Hiei, and slaughtered its<br/>\nthousands of monks.  This study portrays the event as payback<br/>\nfor Enryakuji&#39;s monks joining forces opposed to Nobunaga in<br/>\nearlier conflicts--&quot;a matter of restoring his military<br/>\ncredibility and saving his personal honor&quot; (p. 76).  While<br/>\nallowing that this was an unprecedented act of sacrilege,<br/>\nhowever, Mr.  Lamers does not convey Enryakuji&#39;s powerful<br/>\nposition in the medieval economy and religion, and thus somewhat<br/>\nunderrates the importance of the event.  Quite simply, no<br/>\nearlier ruler could have even contemplated such a move.  By<br/>\nsacking Enryakuji, Nobunaga obliterated one of the foundations<br/>\nof the medieval order.  His other &quot;encounter&quot; with Buddhism was<br/>\nhis long struggle against the well-organized and persistent<br/>\nforces of the Honganji.  It is true that these forces lacked the<br/>\nmonastic character of the monks at Hiei, but ascribing<br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s motives in this campaign partly to a loathing for<br/>\n&quot;farmers&quot; is less than satisfying, especially given the carnage<br/>\nat Nagashima.  Nobunaga had a clear vision of the religious<br/>\nobstacles that stood in his way, and he pursued themrelentlessly.<br/>\nFinally, one comes away from this study with a much greater<br/>\nappreciation for Nobunaga&#39;s achievements, but without much of a<br/>\nsense of Nobunaga as a person.  Premodern sources are, of<br/>\ncourse, notoriously intractable about shedding light on<br/>\nindividuals, and Mr. Lamers eschews at the outset a<br/>\npsychohistorical approach.  Nevertheless, more discussion of<br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s character and times would have yielded a fuller<br/>\nportrait of him without requiring a foray into psychoanalysis.<br/>\nFor instance, one wonders about the sixteenth century warrior<br/>\nfamily and its ethos: was it unusual for a younger brother to<br/>\novershadow the eldest son, as Nobunaga did?  And was Nobunaga<br/>\nunusual in sometimes favoring collateral relatives over his own<br/>\nsons?  The case of Nobunaga&#39;s first marriage, dissolved over<br/>\ninter-familial politics, cries out for some discussion of<br/>\nmarriage practices.  The role in the Araki Crisis of the<br/>\nChristian daimyo with their high regard for loyalty offers an<br/>\nopportunity to discuss this virtue in the context of late<br/>\nsixteenth century Japanese warrior society.  Despite some missed<br/>\nopportunities, however, Mr. Lamers has produced a comprehensive<br/>\nand illuminating account of Nobunaga&#39;s career and policies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCopyright 2001 by H-Net, all rights reserved.
