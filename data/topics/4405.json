Higher level samurai (who were by <br/>\ndefinition rich) might have horses that they fought on from time to <br/>\ntime, or used for transportation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy foot soldiers I&#39;m sure you mean ashigaru. This we can agree was <br/>\nusually the lowest rank of samurai or quasi-samurai, across alot of <br/>\nJapanese history.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of other ways to group samurai, and many different <br/>\nranks or titles. For instance there is the ritsuryo system where each <br/>\ntitle was given a very specific, and numbered, rank. These titles <br/>\nexisted for a thousand years after the ritsuryo system disintigrated. <br/>\nObviously the titles were in name only since the risturyo system <br/>\nitself was gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a></div>",

I have been part of the members for a year but this is the first time i post an email. I have a question about the samurai. In pc games like Age of Empires and Empires: Dawn of the modern world they show samurai as infantry troops. But in the Code of Bushido (which I own) they say that the samurai must put importance in horsemaship. Here is my question:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Are the samurai horsemen that can shoot arrows and use swords from horses or infantry, or both?????<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                          Quauhtli (eagle in Nahuatl language)<br/>\n<br/>\n              <br/>\n  ---------------------------------<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Friends.
