There are more very accurate wargames produced in Japanese-more than I can write about here, but you can read about some of them on the Samurai Archives forum.<br/>\nFor computer games, the Takeda series by Magitech (with Takeda 3 having just been released) is far better than Shogun: Total War as far as accuracy of gameplay and simulating historical situations. Shogun: Total War (in my opinion) has far too many abstractions, ahistorical units, and unrealistic gameplay. Shogun, however, does tend to have a higher fun factor. The Takeda series is brutal and unforgiving in its depiction of warfare.</div>",

(that may have changed, been a long time since then)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for computer games, Shogun, Total war is one of the best games for the<br/>\nJapanese genre that I&#39;ve ever seen.    All of the others tend to be fantasy<br/>\nbased.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a fantasy version of samurai,  Clan War isn&#39;t bad, but it suffers again<br/>\nfrom the Old Game syndrome, meaning most of the miniatures are no-longer in<br/>\nproduction and fewer people are playing it.   The mini&#39;s are gorgeous<br/>\nhowever, and are in 28mm.   It&#39;s tied very strongly to the Legend of the<br/>\nFive Rings RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a historical RPG,  I&#39;d go for Sengoku.  Though it&#39;s got a fantasy<br/>\nelement to it, it&#39;s easily stripped out and it allows you to play the<br/>\nchambara(sp) style genre fairly accurately.   Alot of actual historical<br/>\nresearch went into that game, and I&#39;ve found it to be a good down to earth<br/>\nsystem to play in. If I remember correctly, Anthony Bryant? (I apologize if<br/>\nI got his name wrong) one of the leading scholars on the time frame<br/>\ncontributed to it.  I believe his website to be sengokudaimyo.com<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that being said, if I&#39;d have to recommend a wargame, and only one,<br/>\nI&#39;d go for Shogun: Total War.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Mar 5, 2009 at 12:10 PM, Evan Hodge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evan_hodge@...\">evan_hodge@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   To those who play wargames, by computer, tabletop or boardgame..which<br/>\n&gt; single game is to your mind the best recreation of the historical accuracy<br/>\n&gt; of Japanese warfare in the period between 600AD and 1600AD?<br/>\n&gt; Thank you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n----------------------------------<br/>\nTom<br/>\nInterdum feror cupidine partium magnarum europe vincendarum<br/>\nThou shalt not refer to the Machine Spirit as &quot;Cruise Control&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
