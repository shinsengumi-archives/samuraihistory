            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1992662572\">Puppeteer turns his hand to Genji&#39;s world<br/>\n<br/>\nBy HIROKO OIKAWA Contributing Writer<br/>\n<br/>\nChances are you&#39;ve heard of ``The Tale of Genji,&#39;&#39; the 1,000-year-<br/>\nold tale of romance that&#39;s considered the world&#39;s first great novel. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut chances are you&#39;ve never experienced the book, penned by court <br/>\nlady Murasaki Shikibu, in quite the way it&#39;s being presented by <br/>\nYukiza, a centuries-old marionette theater. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of turning the epic story into a play for puppets was <br/>\nunimaginable-until last year. <br/>\n<br/>\nProduced by the Shizuoka Convention and Arts Center Granship, ``Yume <br/>\nno Ukihashi&#39;&#39; (Floating bridge in a dream), a play based on the <br/>\ntimeless love story, was performed last spring by Yukiza, which <br/>\nboasts 370 years of tradition. The production, which has been <br/>\nperformed only in Shizuoka and a few other prefectures, will finally <br/>\nmake it to Tokyo in late July. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe project was the brainchild of Hajime Yamamoto, Granship&#39;s <br/>\nexecutive director. It was his dream to have the world of Genji <br/>\nstaged by the marionette troupe. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut at first, Yamamoto&#39;s proposal didn&#39;t seem feasible to Magosaburo <br/>\nYuki XII, who heads the company. <br/>\n<br/>\n``I wasn&#39;t sure if we&#39;d be able to do it, because a pure love story <br/>\nwithout action scenes was not in our repertoire,&#39;&#39; Yuki said in an <br/>\ninterview at the company&#39;s studio in Tokyo. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso initially unsure was Makoto Sato, who wrote the script and <br/>\ndirected the production. Preparing the script took three years and <br/>\nrequired him to pore over the lengthy novel in classical Japanese <br/>\nand two modern translations. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe result was ``Yume no Ukihashi,&#39;&#39; an adaptation of the 54-chapter <br/>\nstory of Genji, an aristocratic playboy, and Kaoru, his wife&#39;s <br/>\nillegitimate son. Sato&#39;s adaptation is narrated by Ukifune, a <br/>\nheroine in the novel&#39;s final chapter who attempts suicide following <br/>\nher involvement with Kaoru in a love triangle. She leads the <br/>\naudience to the world of Genji, where key epsodes from the epic <br/>\nnovel unfold. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf particular note about this production is the interaction between <br/>\nthe Yukiza&#39;s marionettes and a human actor, which calls for a bit of <br/>\nimagination on the part of the audience. <br/>\n<br/>\nUkifune, the storyteller, is played by actress Tomoko Mariya. Other <br/>\ncharacters, including Genji, his wife, Aoi, and his lovers, Yugao <br/>\nand Rokujo no miyasudokoro-whose malignant spirit leads Aoi to her <br/>\ndeath-are portrayed by marionettes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMariya also plays Genji in one scene and Rokujo in another, <br/>\ninteracting and conversing with marionettes. <br/>\n<br/>\nFounded in 1635, Yukiza was one of five shogunate-supported theater <br/>\ncompanies in Edo, as Tokyo was known under Tokugawa rule. Of the <br/>\nfive, only Yukiza still operates as a troupe. <br/>\n<br/>\nYuki feels the group&#39;s innovative spirit was the key to its <br/>\nsurvival. <br/>\n<br/>\n``Performers in traditional arts tend to stick with classics, which <br/>\nwere unproven new works when they were first performed. With that in <br/>\nmind, we want to create new works that can become classics later. <br/>\nThat was the thinking of my father and grandfather,&#39;&#39; he says. <br/>\n<br/>\nBorn in 1943 to Magosaburo Yuki X and Sokyo Takemoto, a samisen-<br/>\nplaying storyteller in gidayu tradition, Yuki said he was playing <br/>\nwith marionettes as far back as he can remember. <br/>\n<br/>\n``Marionettes were just about the only toys I could find around me. <br/>\nI taught myself how to manipulate them,&#39;&#39; he recalls. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter his debut at age 4, he continued teaching himself the art <br/>\nrather than training under his father. As a teenager, he studied <br/>\nother traditional arts, including Kabuki, Noh and kyogen, under <br/>\nacknowledged masters. <br/>\n<br/>\n``Like many other people born into the world of traditional arts, I <br/>\nwas at the point of no return before I knew it,&#39;&#39; he says. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, Yuki was involved in the underground theater movement of <br/>\nthe 1960s, which explored new styles of expression. Among the people <br/>\nhe met in those days was Sato, one of the scene&#39;s leading lights. <br/>\n<br/>\nYuki and Sato have worked together since their 1975 production of <br/>\n``Shojo Kamen,&#39;&#39; written by actor and scriptwriter Juro Kara. Their <br/>\nuse of marionettes instead of human actors drew large audiences. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat innovative spirit prompted the company to stage a Japanese-<br/>\nlanguage production of Shakespeare&#39;s ``Macbeth,&#39;&#39; which won a <br/>\nspecial award at the 1986 Belgrade International Theater Festival. <br/>\nTheir artistic path eventually led them to ``Yume no Ukihashi.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in bringing the world of Genji to the stage, the marionette <br/>\nartists had hurdles to clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nAmong them was the use of delicate puppets designed by Sayoko <br/>\nYamaguchi, a top model in the 1970s. For the first time in the <br/>\ncompany&#39;s history, the marionettes&#39; faces and costumes were made <br/>\nwith traditional washi paper. <br/>\n<br/>\n``Made of paper rather than cloth, the marionettes are light and <br/>\nhard to handle,&#39;&#39; Yuki says. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the audience, the extra effort makes a difference. The <br/>\nmarionettes, dressed in black or white costumes representing light <br/>\nand shadow, make a deep impact. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother highlight of the production is 91-year-old Takemoto, Yuki&#39;s <br/>\nsamisen-playing mother. <br/>\n<br/>\n``When she forgets the song and starts improvising, we won&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat to do with the marionettes,&#39;&#39; Yuki says with a laugh. <br/>\n<br/>\nUp next for Yukiza is a planned collaboration with a marionette <br/>\ntheater in China&#39;s Fujian province. <br/>\n<br/>\n``Maybe we&#39;ll do Shakespeare,&#39;&#39; Yuki said. ``The fusion of similar <br/>\nyet different cultures will be a challenge.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\n* * * <br/>\n<br/>\n``Yume no Ukihashi&#39;&#39; will be performed July 22 (7 p.m.), July 23 (2 <br/>\np.m.) and July 24 (2 p.m.) at Tokyo&#39;s Setagaya Public Theater.
