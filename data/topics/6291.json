            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-727884731\">--- Elizabeth Chase &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lizzirrd@...\">lizzirrd@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth--<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease understand that some people (this means YOU,<br/>\nTony) would find fault with just about any movie. I<br/>\nknow he finds fault with Taiga Drama at times. But<br/>\nexcellent point about not &quot;educating&quot;. We&#39;ll try to<br/>\nget some comments on that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example:  the seppuku of General Hasagawa was<br/>\n&gt; not accurate from a &#39;formal seppuku&#39; reference<br/>\n&gt; point, but what was the historical <br/>\n&gt; ritual during/after battle?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If this were a Sengoku battle, I could simply say<br/>\n&quot;there were no *set* rituals yet&quot;, but being as it&#39;s<br/>\npost Tokugawa and all those fun Bushido rules had been<br/>\ncodified, there in fact *were* rules about how to do<br/>\nthese sorts of things. I&#39;m not the slightest bit of an<br/>\nEdo period expert, so I couldn&#39;t help you with the<br/>\ndetails, alas. But I would think that most of the<br/>\n*rules* didn&#39;t apply in battlefield situations--there<br/>\nhad been perilously few battles in the previous 250<br/>\nyears for the situation to come up. <br/>\nYour description of flaws you observed sounds fine to<br/>\nme, given that even though this was on a battlefield,<br/>\nthe customs of the time would dictate certain<br/>\netiquette, possibly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Armor: I don&#39;t know from squat, and would love to<br/>\n&gt; learn.  Yes, I&#39;ve read Tony&#39;s pages. My questions<br/>\n&gt; are these, so far:  how <br/>\n&gt; impoverished was the samurai class by the Meiji<br/>\n&gt; period; hadn&#39;t the shogunate been defunct by around<br/>\n&gt; twenty years by the time frame <br/>\n&gt; of the movie; and how many generations might a suit<br/>\n&gt; of armor last?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Taken care of, it could last quite a long time. As for<br/>\nhow impoverished were they? Well, there were rich<br/>\nsamurai, and poor ones. The Shogunate doesn&#39;t enter<br/>\ninto this, since as you point out it was defunct for 2<br/>\ndecades, so I&#39;m not sure where you are going with that<br/>\nquestion. But while there are many tales of samurai<br/>\nselling their swords to eat, or daimyo letting their<br/>\nretainers go at the end of the Edo period, there were<br/>\nalso Daimyo who remained wealthy. The Daimyo of the<br/>\nChoshu han let many of his retainers go under the<br/>\npretext of poverty, but with the added intention of<br/>\nproviding a marauding disturbance for the Shogunate to<br/>\ndeal with. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I want to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; know the specific differences between history,<br/>\n&gt; tradition, and &#39;dramatic <br/>\n&gt; license.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lastly, a challenge:   I know it is easy to be an<br/>\n&gt; armchair jockey or quarterback.....    and it is<br/>\n&gt; possible to gain a position on a <br/>\n&gt; film production crew as a technical advisor.....   <br/>\n&gt; instead of complaining,  how about being pro-active<br/>\n&gt; and get involved in the <br/>\n&gt; process?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think Tony&#39;s done that. <br/>\n<br/>\nBear with me, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen it. As<br/>\nKitsuno has said, it&#39;s watchable to me, if I suspend<br/>\nhistorical knowledge and watch it as a story taking<br/>\nplace somewhere that sort of looks like Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\nMain issues I had:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Samurai didn&#39;t despise guns. They used them very<br/>\neffectively 300 years before the events in the movie<br/>\nsupposedly take place. Suggesting otherwise makes the<br/>\nmovie romantic, but kills any semblence of reality. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Katsumoto, being a Daimyo, should have lived a<br/>\nlittle better than in some remote mountain village. It<br/>\nplayed more into the &quot;Dances with Samurai&quot; theme for<br/>\nhim to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. The ninja attack was pure Hollywood. It was only<br/>\nthere because any Hollywood samurai movie has got to<br/>\nhave a ninja attack, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Gaijin = no meet Emperor. That was pure silliness. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Katsumoto is LOOSELY based on Saigo Takamori. As<br/>\nin, he was the leader of a group of disgruntled, armed<br/>\nSamurai who took umbrage with being deprived of their<br/>\nstatus. That&#39;s about the extent.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. MOST IMPORTANT POINT: Ahlgren&#39;s<br/>\ndrunkenness--deplorable. No self-respecting member of<br/>\nthe 7th Cavalry would fail to hold their liquor like<br/>\nthat. I should know--I&#39;ve been in the 7th twice! We<br/>\nwere a hard-drinking group, for sure--Ahlgren would<br/>\nhave wilted like a pansy. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll probably end up watching it again, and I&#39;ll be<br/>\nable to talk about some more. I actually liked the<br/>\nmovie, but then again, I had convinced myself it took<br/>\nplace on another planet. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nMeet the all-new My Yahoo! - Try it today! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.yahoo.com\">http://my.yahoo.com</a></div>",

I saw &#39;Legend&#39; about a <br/>\nhundred years ago, but I digress...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d very much like to read a post that enumerates the inaccuracies of the movie as is, not as you wish it to be, and reveals what is <br/>\nthe true history instead.  I have read a great deal of slamming (and elsewhere in other forums), but have yet to come across any <br/>\npost that educates....<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:  the seppuku of General Hasagawa was not accurate from a &#39;formal seppuku&#39; reference point, but what was the historical <br/>\nritual during/after battle?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere would be no poems, white robes,  the cut did not go all the way through, and I forget the name of that piece of furniture <br/>\ndirectly in front of the individual so that his shoulders & head landed on that, and thus avoided having the head bounce around on <br/>\nthe ground and his corpse avoided the indignity of having his butt in the air.  I assume the final expulsion of body fluids was <br/>\nprovided for by careful fundoshi wrapping.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the cut made by Katsumoto seemed inaccurate because it not went all the way through and allowed the head to roll away,  with <br/>\nthe indignities to the corpse and all, and the kiai.  I think that traditionally  the ritual was performed in silence.<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor: I don&#39;t know from squat, and would love to learn.  Yes, I&#39;ve read Tony&#39;s pages. My questions are these, so far:  how <br/>\nimpoverished was the samurai class by the Meiji period; hadn&#39;t the shogunate been defunct by around twenty years by the time frame <br/>\nof the movie; and how many generations might a suit of armor last?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not the widow or kids wanted to off TC, they would do as they were told by K,  the widow&#39;s brother.   Same thing with <br/>\nUjio.  Same thing in the capture scene in the fog.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe battle sequences, one must remember, were western tactics, not Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not trying to rationalize the movie,  I want to know the specific differences between history, tradition, and &#39;dramatic <br/>\nlicense.  That being said, I find it difficult to &#39;suspend disbelief&#39; in medical shows, because of my profession.  I also know that <br/>\nsome portrayals of medical procedures/information are deliberately inaccurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the producers had wanted to make a more accurate film,  would it not have been more appropriate for &#39;the History Channel&#39;, itself <br/>\na bit inaccurate in it&#39;s re-enactments?<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, a challenge:   I know it is easy to be an armchair jockey or quarterback.....    and it is possible to gain a position on a <br/>\nfilm production crew as a technical advisor.....    instead of complaining,  how about being pro-active and get involved in the <br/>\nprocess?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways willing to learn,<br/>\n<br/>\nLizzie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter<br/>\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 14, 2004 2:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai, the movie.
