Being outnumbered by a few, and<br/>\nknowing you have better quality troops, and maybe<br/>\ndetermining how to use surprise, mass, and economy of<br/>\nforce can mitigate these factors. Nobunaga did the<br/>\nlast three at Okehazama, in what I consider one of the<br/>\nmost brilliant battles fought by any commander<br/>\nanywhere. However, Katsuyori didn&#39;t think it all<br/>\nthrough. He was outnumbered by more than 2 to 1, not<br/>\nby a few; granted his troops were probably more<br/>\ndisciplined and better trained, especially the<br/>\ncavalry; however, and most crucially, he failed to do<br/>\nANYTHING other than what Nobunaga expected him to do.<br/>\nDid he try to maneuver to get in Nobunaga&#39;s rear and<br/>\nreduce him piecemeal, negating Nobunaga&#39;s force size?<br/>\nNo. He let Nobunaga make his preparations, and then<br/>\ncharged first thing in the morning right into the<br/>\ndefense Nobunaga had laid out. I will grant that<br/>\nwithout the defensive preparations (and the river, and<br/>\nthe muddy ground...) it would have been much more<br/>\neven, and as it was the idea that the gunfire<br/>\n&quot;slaughtered&quot; the Takeda is a fallacy. But the point<br/>\nis he did NONE of this. Those good commanders you<br/>\nmention would not have done the expected, charge<br/>\nstraight up the middle at waiting arqubusiers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; The troop size is only one of factors that the field<br/>\n&gt; marshall has to consider for her or his tactical<br/>\n&gt; decision. But, it is not the only factor that will<br/>\n&gt; determine the success or the failure of any type of<br/>\n&gt; tactical decisions that would be made by the field<br/>\n&gt; marshall.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never said it was. The North Koreans have many more<br/>\nmen under arms than the South Koreans, yet I fully<br/>\nbelieve the South Koreans would run over them<br/>\n(provided NK artillery was negated first).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote> But,also in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; many of famous battles directed by those &#39;famous&#39;<br/>\n&gt; generals, you would find that they often had to<br/>\n&gt; fight<br/>\n&gt; against the more powerful or larger sized enemy<br/>\n&gt; troops. I think that this is where we can<br/>\n&gt; distinguish<br/>\n&gt; between competent and incompetent field marshalls.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, and many times those generals weren&#39;t exactly<br/>\ngiven the choice, and maneuvered themselves into<br/>\nsuccess. As I said, Katsuyori did not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In general, I would say that the field marshall must<br/>\n&gt; try to avoid facing and fighting the larger sized<br/>\n&gt; enemy if possible because of there is more odds for<br/>\n&gt; defeat. But, if his or her tactical decision<br/>\n&gt; forces(you will need more interpretation for this<br/>\n&gt; word) him or her to take offensive or defensive,<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; he or she would need to excercise his or her<br/>\n&gt; ingenuity<br/>\n&gt; with all efforts. That is why we train generals and<br/>\n&gt; officers at the academy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is exactly what I am saying. Is it possible that<br/>\nthis could have turned out different? Yes, of course.<br/>\nThe prudent course would have been to retreat and<br/>\nfight when the odds were better. Katsuyori had this<br/>\noption. If forced to fight, could he have done better?<br/>\nWithout a doubt, yes. But then again, all of this is<br/>\nin hindsight. My original point in my original post<br/>\nwas that given the information he should have had (and<br/>\nif he didn&#39;t, he sure did not follow Sun Tzu&#39;s<br/>\nprecepts of using scouts and spies) he should not have<br/>\nmade the decision to fight. If he did decide to fight,<br/>\nhe should have done something, anything else. Rush the<br/>\ncastle and take it, then defend from inside. Determine<br/>\nwhere Nobunaga was and attack before he could prepare,<br/>\nor maneuver around and hit him from another side.<br/>\nAnything. I wouldn&#39;t take my tanks on a frontal<br/>\nassault of fortified positions with AT missiles and<br/>\nartillery. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

With no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; radios, no airplanes, or any other ways to take in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the big picture, how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would they know they are outnumbered?  Would they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a general idea of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; available troops based on who the opposing general<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was, or maybe count the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; standards and estimate?  I personally couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; count<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 38,000 troops on my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fingers ;) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not an expert in samurai scouts. I&#39;ve only<br/>\n&gt; studied<br/>\n&gt; what has been written by others on how they employed<br/>\n&gt; them. But I DO know scouting. I served as a tank<br/>\n&gt; platoon leader in a division cavalry squadron, and<br/>\n&gt; worked extensively with cavalry scouts. I&#39;m now an<br/>\n&gt; intelligence officer and my job is to gather<br/>\n&gt; information about the enemy, using scouts to do so.<br/>\n&gt; Yeah, radios, UAV&#39;s, etc are great, but the<br/>\n&gt; principles<br/>\n&gt; of recon don&#39;t change. You&#39;d have strategic and<br/>\n&gt; operational recon (otherwise known as spies) and<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; an idea of what the opposing force had. Katsuyori<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; to know the available forces that Nobunaga and<br/>\n&gt; ieyasu<br/>\n&gt; had, and would make a guess as to how many of them<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;d have to face. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Next you&#39;d have tactical scouts, what we think of as<br/>\n&gt; scouts. If I was surrounding an enemy emplacement,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d be darn skippy that I would not only focus on<br/>\n&gt; that. I&#39;d have scouts out in all directions, waiting<br/>\n&gt; to report on that reliving force I KNOW would<br/>\n&gt; probably<br/>\n&gt; be coming. You wouldn&#39;t have to count to 38,000,<br/>\n&gt; especially not with a Sengoku army. Look at the<br/>\n&gt; banners....yeah, that&#39;s hashiba&#39;s banner, and he has<br/>\n&gt; 8,000 men under him...I know that from my strategic<br/>\n&gt; recon. Okay, that&#39;s Sakakibara, and he has 1000. The<br/>\n&gt; banners made it easy, because not only could you get<br/>\n&gt; an idea of unit size, you knew who was in command.<br/>\n&gt; Nowadays I have to count vehicles, and maybe I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; lucky and identify a certain type  of vehicle that<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; only in at a certain echelon, and I can determine<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; size. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so in a battle such as Nagashino, at what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point does one realize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are outnumbered?

I&#39;ve only studied<br/>\nwhat has been written by others on how they employed<br/>\nthem. But I DO know scouting. I served as a tank<br/>\nplatoon leader in a division cavalry squadron, and<br/>\nworked extensively with cavalry scouts.

You&#39;d have strategic and<br/>\noperational recon (otherwise known as spies) and have<br/>\nan idea of what the opposing force had. Katsuyori had<br/>\nto know the available forces that Nobunaga and ieyasu<br/>\nhad, and would make a guess as to how many of them<br/>\nhe&#39;d have to face. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext you&#39;d have tactical scouts, what we think of as<br/>\nscouts. If I was surrounding an enemy emplacement,<br/>\nyou&#39;d be darn skippy that I would not only focus on<br/>\nthat. I&#39;d have scouts out in all directions, waiting<br/>\nto report on that reliving force I KNOW would probably<br/>\nbe coming. You wouldn&#39;t have to count to 38,000,<br/>\nespecially not with a Sengoku army. Look at the<br/>\nbanners....yeah, that&#39;s hashiba&#39;s banner, and he has<br/>\n8,000 men under him...I know that from my strategic<br/>\nrecon. Okay, that&#39;s Sakakibara, and he has 1000. The<br/>\nbanners made it easy, because not only could you get<br/>\nan idea of unit size, you knew who was in command.<br/>\nNowadays I have to count vehicles, and maybe I&#39;ll get<br/>\nlucky and identify a certain type  of vehicle that is<br/>\nonly in at a certain echelon, and I can determine the<br/>\nsize. <br/>\n<br/>\nso in a battle such as Nagashino, at what<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; point does one realize<br/>\n&gt; they are outnumbered?

Perhaps if Takeda Shingen was still around and <br/>\nhadn&#39;t carelessly been shot by a lowly arquebussier (I think)Maybe <br/>\nthe battle could have been won, One of his famous quotes is &quot;A man <br/>\nwith deep far-sightedness will survey both the beginning and the end <br/>\nof a situation and continually consider its every facet as important.&quot;<br/>\nIf Katsuyori had taken his fathers advice he would not have charged <br/>\ninto the valley of death so to speak. Although he showed great <br/>\nsamurai spirit and followed the code of (Bushido) I.e to advance and <br/>\ndie in battle.  He really was fated I am afraid to lose.  Perhaps if <br/>\nhe had taken the castle at Nagashino earlier defeated Okudaira <br/>\nSadamasa and then spent time fortifying it and courting alliances <br/>\nwith other Daimyo then he may have held ground, but in the end the <br/>\nsuperior Oda-Tokugawa army would have won out.  Also the battle could <br/>\nhave been won if alot of what-if&#39;s happened, for example if the <br/>\nmessenger Torii Suneemon hadn&#39;t warned Ieyasu and Nobunaga the battle <br/>\nwould have been over and the Takeda could have perhaps swept onto the <br/>\nkanto plain (I doubt but maybe) If accounts of the battle are true <br/>\nthen Katsuyori was in a difficult position he had a classic problem <br/>\nfacing any general How to use cavalry as defensive troops? in my <br/>\nopinion he had no option but to become the attacker as he was <br/>\noutnumbered out gunned, perhaps out planned? (Sorry all you Takeda <br/>\nLoyalists) The use of arquebussiers behind screens with pike men and <br/>\nspear men was I think innovative on a scale never seen before, (I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t found out who masterminded this scheme it seems like a <br/>\nNobunaga scheme, opinions?) Therefore in conclusion Katsuyori could <br/>\nnot have won the battle unless a number of what if&#39;s had occured and <br/>\nhe had taken the castle.  He was undoubtebly a brave soul but all to <br/>\noften in the history of the Bushi it seems that tragic heroes have a <br/>\nplace to play, they are there to be swept aside by the great warriors <br/>\nwho become myths then legends and eventually get to take the prize of <br/>\nbeing remembered as they say history is not written by the losers, (I <br/>\nwonder what Katsuyori would say if he was around, do we really have <br/>\nany right to judge him, Poor Katsuyori)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards Mark</div>",

From what I have read, Ninja began as militant <br/>\nmonks or warrior monks, who were pretty much hated by most of <br/>\nthe Samurai.  In fact, it is said that Nobunaga had many battles <br/>\nwith these types of monks.  Because of their zeal, militant <br/>\nprowess, and great numbers; many of those in power regaurded <br/>\nthem as a serious threat.  Out of persecution and thus the need <br/>\nto be  less obvious, the Ninja developed techniques which were <br/>\nakin to today&#39;s stealth technology.  They were later hired into <br/>\nservice to use these skills for the purposes of the Samurai.  <br/>\nThey seemed to be a necessary evil.  I say evil because the way <br/>\nof the Ninja fully contradicts Bushido.  It is a system without <br/>\nhonor.  And many Samurai were defenseless, afraid, and <br/>\ndisgusted by Ninja tactics.  The Samurai seek glory through one <br/>\non one victories over great opponents in open combat.  While a <br/>\nNinja would sneak into one&#39;s home under the blanket of night to <br/>\nnamelessly slaughter whoever he was hired to kill.  They were <br/>\nalso spies as before mentioned by sineism.  <br/>\nThe only simalarity between Ninja and Samurai are that they <br/>\nwere sometimes both under conscription of a lord.  Samurai are <br/>\nmore often regaurded as retainers but Ninja would sometimes <br/>\nalso be retainers instead of the more common mercenary Ninja.  <br/>\nGreat Diamyos and Shoguns are usually rumored to have used <br/>\nNinja.  This was not normally  public knowledge until the <br/>\nTokugawa government was well in place.  This is because it <br/>\nwas shameful for a great lord to stoop to such tactics in a world <br/>\ndominated by Samurai with thier unique code of ethics.  Most <br/>\nwould openly deny use of Ninja, but it seemed to be a common <br/>\npractice.  Ninja if caught by the enemy were certain to recieve the <br/>\nmost heinous death that his captors could imagine.  They were <br/>\nmost often regaurded by the Samurai as despiccable and <br/>\ndisgusting.<br/>\nFrom my experience with Japanese jidai (period) films, one <br/>\ntheory is that some Samurai were also Ninja(being of a Samurai <br/>\nfamily but having the special mission of  being Ninja) .  <br/>\nOne thing I am absolutely certain of is that Ninja did exist.  It <br/>\nwould preposterous to suggest that such a well documented <br/>\nclass of warrior did not exist.  Ninja films have  been in <br/>\nJapanese cinema since the 1920&#39;s.  If you go to any of the <br/>\nweapon&#39;s or antique dealers in Japan you are likely to find an <br/>\nauthentic Ninja jacket.  There are countless other examples as <br/>\nproof of thier existence.  The origin however is suspect ; clouded <br/>\nby mystery and superstition.  Hard facts are sometimes difficult <br/>\nto find.<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nmidorinotoradesu<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;sinseism&quot; &lt;sinseism@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Konnichiwa<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Ninja had really existed ,but some descriptions in mangas <br/>\nand movies <br/>\n&gt; are a little exaggerated.<br/>\n&gt; Ninja was often called Shinobi (same kanji character is used <br/>\nin &quot;nin&quot; <br/>\n&gt; of &quot;ninja&quot; and &quot;shinobi&quot;,meaning &quot;hide&quot; or so.
