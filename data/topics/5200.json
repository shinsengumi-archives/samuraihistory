But 1493 makes sense too because it was the <br/>\nyear that Jundouji&#39;s (the younger brother killed by Chachamaru) older <br/>\nbrother Ashikaga Yoshizumi took control as Shogun, and that would <br/>\nhave given Soun the &#39;justification&#39; for invasion - to avenge the <br/>\nmother and brother of the Shogun.  Not to mention 2 years of civil <br/>\nwar in Izu would take a toll on everyone involved, given Soun an <br/>\neasier time of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which is it, 1491 or 1493?</div>",
