Such maps hopefully show <br/>\nmajor (and minor) settlements, fortresses and castles, rivers and <br/>\nother prominent topography. The map(s) provided with the game system <br/>\nare in my view, while helpful as a start, rather lacking in detail. <br/>\nI&#39;ve found some maps along the lines of what I&#39;m looking for in some <br/>\nof the Osprey books (i.e. Sekigahara, Kawanakajima, Nagashino, etc.), <br/>\nbut I was really hoping to find yet more detail over a larger area if <br/>\npossible. I&#39;m even open to primary sources in the original Japanese <br/>\nif anyone knows of such books by name. Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
