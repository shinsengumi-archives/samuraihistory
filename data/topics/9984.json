I also think Nobunaga was successful. Since I believe the Maeno scrolls are legit (as does Konan city itself), I believe a large part of Nobunaga&#39;s success was due to his ability to utilize spies and sabotage with both brutal and surgical results. <br/>\n   I do think that Nobunaga made a key error (it does not take away from his success, but speaks to his story being cut short) :<br/>\n                                               - He pushed Sakuma away and let Akechi too close<br/>\n                       I really believe that if he had not banished Sakuma --and with him the dismantling of Sakuma&#39;s intelligence network ( I know this factoid is controversial, but I have enough evidence that I believe it) --- he would have been able to anticipate Akechi&#39;s move. I think that Oda&#39;s banishment of Sakuma and his son was a BAD idea..just bad. He pushed away those who were truly loyal and concerned for him and kept people who &quot;performed better&quot;, but really didn&#39;t care for him.<br/>\n    This is a classic mistake...

Thus, why we have to measure him up to his life and not to the times and lives of those that came after him,etc.etc.  You can always find someone to compare him to that makes him looks god-like.. and someone to compare him with to make him look worthless... .  thus, for a true evaluation, you have to evaluate him based on his life and the -WORLD AS HE KNEW IT AT THAT SPECIFC TIME- <br/>\n <br/>\n       Once he have that, then you can evaluate him against himself.<br/>\n <br/>\n                    O.k. : Now... devil&#39;s advocate here :<br/>\n <br/>\n                      Human beings throughout most of known time have portrayed the relatively same mind-sets and habits... this being said, you have no choice but to compare those qualities cross-cultural and cross-time with other &quot;successful&quot; military commanders. Taking cultural, religion, and time into account.. there are some cross-cultural comparisions that are applicable. <br/>\n <br/>\n               End Point :<br/>\n <br/>\n                What were Oda&#39;s goals ? Did he achieve them ? Look at it from an Emic perspective.  Do you believe HE would feel successful with his actions ? Did he meet HIS goals ? <br/>\n <br/>\n         Success is truly an opinion... everything done is undone by time and conditions.. . nothing ever lasts.... there are numerous flaws in everything.. . every victory has the seeds of decay within it...  Success is just the beginning of downfall... <br/>\n <br/>\n         Thus, the measure of success if truly &quot;in the eye of the beholder&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\n                            Do you think Oda was successful ?<br/>\n <br/>\n                             I think so... it is 2009 and I&#39;m spending my Thursday morning writing an email about him.... four hundred twenty something years later..... (427, right ?)  <br/>\n      He may have died before his grand scheme was complete... but it was completed regardless. Japan became a single nation under one ruler.... it did happen. And it happen in accord with HIS intention and HIS &quot;chain of actions&quot;... <br/>\n                  You may not want to credit him with the actual completion of the task... fair enough..<br/>\n <br/>\n   However, you cannot deny that HE lit the fire .... everything that came after was a direct result of his intial work.<br/>\n <br/>\n                      Anyway... I&#39;m stumbling into my own opinions now, so I will stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 10/14/09, Leroy Eaton &lt;zora514@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Leroy Eaton &lt;zora514@yahoo. com&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Nobunaga-how successful was he?<br/>\nTo: samuraihistory@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, October 14, 2009, 12:09 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, if he hadn&#39;t dies, then Hashiba wouldn&#39;t have come to power, and your probably right, he would have most likley expanded towards the west, perhaps would have tried to conquor China and, and the rest of Asia... id is all hypothetical though...<br/>\n<br/>\n____________ _________ _________ __<br/>\nFrom: Joseph &lt;josephtorres93@ yahoo.com&gt;<br/>\nTo: samuraihistory@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\nSent: Tue, October 13, 2009 4:20:13 PM<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Nobunaga-how successful was he?<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In samuraihistory@ yahoogroups. com, Steven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bornholt,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;         You&#39;ve probably alread heard this, but are you 100% sure than Akechi&#39;s move was a cheap shot for power?

My current question is basically &quot;How successful was Oda Nobunaga at reunifying Japan&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Now the obvious answer and prossibly the right one is &quot;very successful only &quot;failed&quot; because Nobunaga was overenthusiastic and Akechi made his famous cheap shot at power. However, this essay needs to be coached in terms historiographical arguement and complaining. That just leaves me with just Berry in english with her whole Hideyoshi-coaltion/ Federalism arguement.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I would like to know if anyone can link me to other arguments that Nobunaga was not so sucessful or that his success lacked the depth or structures needed to forge a long-lasting reunification settlement of the kind the Tokugawa achieved; even if he had lived longer. I&#39;ve been looking at the usual suspects Berry, Lamers, Cambridge History, etc. Recommendations or opinions of historians outside the English corpus of literature would be most appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; PS: are any of the samurai archives forum admins out there, erm...your site is not sending me the confirmation email so I can post there.
