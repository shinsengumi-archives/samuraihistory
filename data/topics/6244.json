Truth <br/>\nbe told, the tale explores more on the life of the lowly samurai hero <br/>\nand how reality has forced him to make great changes in his life. I <br/>\ncried at the end of this film. I can&#39;t help it, it was too sad, yet as <br/>\nan educated viewer, I knew that it was the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than the review, for those who are interested  to me, this is one <br/>\nof the better Samurai movies out there since Akira Kurosawa.

There is an elegiac, end-of-era quality <br/>\nthat carries echoes of such influential American westerns as The <br/>\nWild Bunch and The Shootist. <br/>\n<br/>\nDirector Yojiro Takita takes an understated approach: the film wears <br/>\nits beauty without ostentation. Confrontations are swift, brutal and <br/>\nbloody without becoming stylised. The flashbacks occasionally <br/>\nthreaten to break the spell of the narrative, but what ultimately <br/>\nshines through is the humanity of the story as memories and <br/>\nincidents transform our understanding of an individual, revealing <br/>\nthat heroism can take many forms and that even the bitterest rivals <br/>\ncan eventually achieve mutual respect. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn selected release from Friday<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis article: <br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/thereview.cfm?id=1418732004\">http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/thereview.cfm?id=1418732004</a></div>",
