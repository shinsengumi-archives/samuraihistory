One (or more) layers of really heavy paper were laid <br/>\ndown over a form and lacquered to within an inch of their lives. I&#39;ve seen some <br/>\nreally impressive modern jingasa made in that way where the &quot;core&quot; is just a <br/>\nsingle layer of what amounts to posterboard glued into shape (e.g., either a <br/>\nsingle piece that&#39;s rolled into a cone and secured with glue or staples [!], or <br/>\nseveral pie-wedge shapes likewise attached, and then lacquered with eight or ten <br/>\nlayers of lacquer. These things end up about 1/4&quot; thick or more, and are hard as <br/>\na rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony J.
