            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-557792710\">You&#39;re getting confused with a (very) far fetched theory of how Uesugi Kenshin died...  Toyotomi most likely died of syphilis (also not a proven theory, but likely, considering how much of a &#39;playboy&#39; he was) - that would account for his erratic and psychotic behavior at the end of his life.  Here is info from the syphilis info site (Not one I tend to hang out at all that often):<br/>\n&quot;If untreated, syphilis may lapse into a latent stage during which the disease is no  longer contagious and no symptoms are present. Many people who are not treated will suffer no further consequences of  the disease. Approximately one-third of those who have secondary syphilis, however, go on to develop the complications of late, or tertiary, syphilis, in which the bacteria damage the heart, eyes, brain, nervous system, bones, joints, or almost any other part of the body. This stage can last for years, or even for decades. Late syphilis, the final stage, can result in mental illness, blindness, other neurologic problems, heart disease, and death.&quot;  It says up to 20 years can pass before this &#39;latent&#39; syphilis shows itself. <br/>\n<br/>\njust a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;O&#39;Keefe&quot; &lt;Viva77@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I heard that he was going to the rest room and was stabbed in his &lt; rear end<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by some asassin.
