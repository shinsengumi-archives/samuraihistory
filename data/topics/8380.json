Probably the longest-surviving<br/>\n&gt;authoritarian regime that I can think of off-hand. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Ottoman&#39;s come to mind, England, maybe France (the ruling house <br/>\nchanged around a lot) etc. Dictatorship was the common government until <br/>\nrecently and is still popular in some parts of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s interesting to study<br/>\n&gt;to find out about the nature of authoritarian regimes, especially ones as<br/>\n&gt;successful in its longetivity as this one.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes it&#39;s interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hopefully there will be more discussion on this.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: Jan Versoza &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janversoza@...\">janversoza@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think one of the main reasons why the Tokugawa<br/>\n&gt;regime lasted so long was because of the style of<br/>\n&gt;swordsmanship they studied. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ROTFL. Guns don&#39;t care about fancy sword moves. The Tokugawa&#39;s were <br/>\nmilitarily very progressive when they first took power. They could have <br/>\nfought any other power straight up in 1600 and probably come out the <br/>\nvictor because of the size of their army and reasonable tactics and <br/>\nstrategy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Anthony Bryant &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anthony_bryant@...\">anthony_bryant@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I rather think it had more to do with their politics and <br/>\n&gt;their alliances than their school of swordsmanship.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Martial arts were never the be-all and end-all of Japanese <br/>\n&gt;history, despite the illusions of some modern dojo masters.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think strategy and tactics are martial arts as well, they studied <br/>\nthese pretty carefully when they first started!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Haynes, A &#92;(Angus&#92;)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:angus.haynes@...\">angus.haynes@...</a>&gt; The Tokugawa <br/>\n&gt; bakufu lasted as long as it did because of the methods introduced <br/>\n&gt; early on in regards to controlling the clans and the strategic <br/>\n&gt; position of lands that were under direct bakufu control. These were <br/>\n&gt; the reasons that it lasted as long as it did despite it&#39;s many problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The rotating hostage attendance system was a great example. Kept the <br/>\nother clans broke and under their thumb.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Angus: &quot;Oh, what a giveaway! Did you hear that? Did<br/>\n&gt;you hear that, eh? That&#39;s what I&#39;m on about! Did you<br/>\n&gt;see him repressing me? You saw him, Didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is &#39;Life of Brian or the &#39;Holy Grail&#39; the greatest Python movie ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: Peter Bailey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:foxfoil@...\">foxfoil@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am not a huge expert on the Tokugawa era, but from what I have read  <br/>\n&gt;on the subject, it seems that the regime survived more thanks to some  <br/>\n&gt;of its suppressing laws.<br/>\n&gt;for example peasants not being allowed to leave their land,<br/>\n&gt;daimyos having to spend long periods of time in Edo and having to  <br/>\n&gt;leave their families as &quot;hostages&quot; while they were away.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Peasants are like rape seed, the more you squeeze them, the more oil you <br/>\nget. I think that&#39;s an Ieyasu quote. What a nice guy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: Mateusz Ostrowski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ostrowski75@...\">ostrowski75@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But the politics were shaped by the martial arts. The way they were thinking and planning was a &quot;fruit&quot; of their&#39;s commitment to martial arts. By the way, it wasn&#39;t only a martial art but the way of thinking. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kenjutsu never comes across as anything special in any of the lives of <br/>\nthe early unifiers of Japan that I&#39;ve ever read, fun TV series aside. It <br/>\nwas like taking math, they studied the required bits because everyone of <br/>\ntheir class did but nut much else. Otherwise it would have been the <br/>\n&#39;Musashi&#39; bakufu ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Matt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; --- Mateusz Ostrowski <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ostrowski75@...\">ostrowski75@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But the politics were shaped by the martial arts.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No, they weren&#39;t--at least not nearly as much as by<br/>\n&gt;expediency, a desire to secure and remain in power,<br/>\n&gt;socioeconomic factors, etc. Tokugawa Ieyasu was not<br/>\n&gt;some mystical warrior-monk who ran out and did a sword<br/>\n&gt;kata every time he had to make some critical political<br/>\n&gt;decision. If anything, he was the ultimate pragmatist.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think he even had a nasty comment about fancy heirloom swords, but I <br/>\ncould easily have mixed him up with Oda or someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally study &#39;sit on my butt-fu&#39; myself ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
