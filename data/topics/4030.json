Battles like Nagashino are no longer standard warfare.  War <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to be a slaughter.  It can be executed and finished in a <br/>\nproportional manner.  <br/>\nIn fact, I&#39;m not even sure that I&#39;ll vote for Bush in the election.  <br/>\nI am sure I have the right to share my thoughts.  Just as much as you <br/>\nhave the right to tell me that you don&#39;t like what I&#39;ve said.  And <br/>\nalthough there may not be an absolutely clear link to medieval Japan <br/>\nlet me make the indirect link evident.  This group discusses the <br/>\nhistory of a military class and the wars they fought.  I think it is <br/>\nimportant to be able to relate history into terms that I can <br/>\nunderstand.  In my case I don&#39;t have any SCA experience or anything <br/>\nof that nature.  The way that I relate to the samurai is through our <br/>\nmodern military and wars in recent history.  Being able to comprehend <br/>\nthe links that history may have to our present makes history even <br/>\nmore powerful in terms of revelance.  Some people don&#39;t like history <br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t think it has any bearing on who they are.  I&#39;m not <br/>\none of them and neither are you.<br/>\nI&#39;m just trying to tie things in so they make sense to me, and maybe <br/>\nhelp others make the same link.  The topic of conversation was War.  <br/>\nIs it bad, evil, ugly?  I guess I could have kept the conversation <br/>\nabstract, like many others have.  I didn&#39;t want to be accused of <br/>\nmaking statements &quot;that sound good but have no substance&quot;.  <br/>\nI really didn&#39;t mean to offend you but I won&#39;t apologize.  It is what <br/>\nI believe.  I hope you don&#39;t hate me now.  I know that some of what I <br/>\nbrought up is probably closer to you than anyone else on the group.  <br/>\nI do respect your opinions Cepo and I am actually flattered that you <br/>\nread all the way through my message.

I&#39;d like to comment on the <br/>\n&quot;just&quot;ness of a war based on the loss of innocent lives.  If it is <br/>\nmore &quot;just&quot; to inflict as little loss of innocents as possible then <br/>\nAmerica&#39;s military is moving very close to the over all goal of zero  <br/>\ncollateral damage.

Wars are no longer gauged in terms of <br/>\nbridges bombed, buildings destroyed, or people killed.  We used to <br/>\ncount how many buildings were destroyed to judge our progress in war.  <br/>\nBut we have evolved to a point which we can destroy a single room in <br/>\na building.  Vastly reducing collateral damage while precisely <br/>\nhitting our target.  I think that war in traditional, trench war <br/>\nsense is very ugly due to the high number of casualties in such a <br/>\nwar.  Being able to stop specific people without hurting anyone else <br/>\nis a thing of beauty but only  if the cause is morally right <br/>\n(subjective, I know).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis election year President Bush will be critisized for the War on <br/>\nTerror.  I&#39;d hope that people look at the way we fight against <br/>\nterrorists.  They cause mass casualties of innocent people, while we <br/>\ntarget and kill only known terrorists and the rogue nation leaders <br/>\nthat support terror.  In fact, we aren&#39;t out there killing all of <br/>\nthem.  We are capturing them.  Surely a war against an enemy whose <br/>\nprimary goal is to kill innocent people, is a just war.  Reguardless <br/>\nof weather we find Weapons of Mass Destruction or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fundamental question is killing ever justified?  I think it is if <br/>\nthe death of one can prevent the suffering of many.  Sometimes you <br/>\nhave to cut the cancer out to save the patient.  If you don&#39;t, it <br/>\nwill spread until its evil pollutes all of mankind.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay the 2nd thing.  My understanding is that America wanted Japan to <br/>\nstrike first because America needed the support for the war.  We <br/>\nthought it was someone else&#39;s war until we were attacked.  So I <br/>\nreally doubt that Japan&#39;s attack was a pre-emtive strike.  I think <br/>\nthe leaders of that time wanted justice for the Russo-Japanese war <br/>\ntreaties that America had mediated.  The promises of monetary <br/>\nreimbursement to the Japanese were threatening to our politicians.  <br/>\nWe were scared that if Japan had that money, they would build a great <br/>\nmilitary and eventually come after us.  We were afraid of a situation <br/>\nthat we ended up creating.  I don&#39;t think their attack was just in <br/>\nthe sense you mentioned but it was in the sense of retribution.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, golfmandan@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; There are various &quot;just war theories&quot; that have been propounded <br/>\nthroughout history.

If you consider WWII, which we would say was &quot;just&quot; on the <br/>\npart of the Allied forces, as they were defending rather than <br/>\nattacking... millions of innocent, unoffending people (meaning people <br/>\nwho did not believe in the aggression and genocide) were killed, both <br/>\non the Allied side and the Axis side. It certainly wasn&#39;t ALL the <br/>\ngermans and italians and japanese that were the willing aggressors. <br/>\nMillions were conscripted against their wills who didn&#39;t really <br/>\nbelieve in the legitimacy of the Axis side. And on the Allied side, <br/>\nmillions died defending against that aggression. And the Allied <br/>\nforces even sided with Stalin, who was a brutal murderer who killed <br/>\nsome 40 million of his own people. Allying with such a man is <br/>\ncertainly evil. But the enemy of my enemy is my friend... or so they <br/>\nsay... If innocent people are unavoidably killed, then war cannot be <br/>\n&quot;just&quot; in a complete and unqualified sense.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We would generally say war is just only for the defending side, and <br/>\nnot for the aggressor. But what if one knows that war is coming, is <br/>\ninevitable, unavoidable, and you&#39;re left with the choice of being the <br/>\naggressor or the one who is first struck? Then it seems that maybe <br/>\nit&#39;s okay to be the initial attacker, if war is inevitable. Such was <br/>\nthe case for Japan and it&#39;s attack on Pearl Harbor... they felt or <br/>\nknew that war was inevitable, so chose to strike first rather than be <br/>\nstruck first. We americans always call Japan the bad guys, but from a <br/>\ndifferent perspective, their attack seems a little more acceptable <br/>\n(not that I&#39;m saying they were right!!!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The question of whether or not there is a just war is a very <br/>\ndifficult one. It&#39;s not easy to answer. I guess I would end up saying <br/>\nthat war is an inevitable evil, an apparently necessary evil to <br/>\ncombat other evils. Just?
