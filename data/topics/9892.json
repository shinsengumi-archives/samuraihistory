            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-624146166\">Gentleman, <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading the discussions with a keen interest. I believe I have mentioned before of my PHd thesis which is a comparison of the warriors of the Illiad and the Samurai of the 16th century (with interjections with the Viking&#39;s as I am currently living in Norway).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I wish to make is this. One can establish links fairly easily from most cultures, wars, leader, religions, e.g the above, if one wishes to find them, but I think it&#39;s a little redundant merely to say and think that. For example, I began my thesis with a crique of Karl Marx. In his Grundrisse, he askes would Achilles be possible with powder and lead? Part of my thesis lies in me comparing the warriors of the Illiad and those of the Samurai to argue yes, an &#39;Achilles&#39; type of hero was indeed possible in the age of guns: e.g the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, or the Satuma rebellion which is the event, and its leader of the discussion, also, I think its interesting to note, that Marx died five years after the Satsume rebellion, an interesting illustration to demonstrate that Western thinking rarely glanced Easrwards to the Japans (though Nietzsche does say he would move there if he had the capital). But merely to say that the Greek warriors and Samurai warriors are similar is not very groundbreaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am suggesting is that while it is interesting merely to look and compare cultures, Japan of this period and the American Civil War are too areas of deep historical interest too me, we should be looking at what we can learn from such comparisons. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does it tell us? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow does a comparison help our understanding?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes a man challenge the governement?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes a man lead a rebellion killing his own people?<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the power of the ideologies, are there common ideas, what does this tell us about these men?<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the literature is closer detail, history is written by the victor, and both Lee and Saigo were heroic losers.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA book by Cliford Geertz, &#39;The Interpretation of Cultures&#39; from the 70&#39;s may prove interesting to the some members.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few ideas...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTom Dowling, BA; MA (Hons)<br/>\n<br/>\ntle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nView your Twitter and Flickr updates from one place � Learn more!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/go/137984870/direct/01/\">http://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/go/137984870/direct/01/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
