(was RE: R<br/>\ne: h itokiri kawaka<br/>\n<br/>\n[snips]<br/>\n<br/>\nMy statements were originally to the effect that fiction is fiction, history<br/>\nis history, and that if you want the facts of history, go study history. The<br/>\nonly argument to that that I can see would be the opposite: historical facts<br/>\nare better found in fiction than in history books. Is this what you, Nina,<br/>\nand you, Onnagozen, are indeed saying? Can you please explain how in the<br/>\nworld you would reach this conclusion? I think it&#39;s fairly cynical (and<br/>\ntrust me, I&#39;m as cynical as they come, so you can imagine my shock) to say<br/>\nthat watching a move would teach you more about actual, factual history than<br/>\nopening a history book would. While today&#39;s kids may embrace that method of<br/>\nteaching, personally, I&#39;d be horrified if for history class everyday my kids<br/>\nchucked the textbooks and popped in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; to learn about the<br/>\nUS Civil War. As much as I love Taiga Drama, I don&#39;t see Japanese students<br/>\nwatching &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; as definitive fact of the rise of Toyotomi. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nYahoo!

That kind of detail either doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; make it into <br/>\n&gt; documents (official documents and contracts), or is,<br/>\n&gt; as you have <br/>\n&gt; pointed out, unreliable (diaries, parodies).  So,<br/>\n&gt; while I am interested <br/>\n&gt; in the incident of the 47 ronin and the fascination<br/>\n&gt; that it holds as a <br/>\n&gt; bit of cultural legacy, I wouldn&#39;t expect an<br/>\n&gt; historical account to be <br/>\n&gt; able to provide me with he-said/she-said kind of<br/>\n&gt; details.  Who said <br/>\n&gt; what to whom and how 47 guys planned a &#39;secret&#39;<br/>\n&gt; attack, nearly 4 <br/>\n&gt; centuries ago is (and should be) beyond the powers<br/>\n&gt; of historiography.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Put down the Turnbull, and slowly back away. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has turned into a criticism of history work,<br/>\nwhich is fine. Unfortunately, I&#39;m at a loss as to why<br/>\nit became this. My statements were originally to the<br/>\neffect that fiction is fiction, history is history,<br/>\nand that if you want the facts of history, go study<br/>\nhistory. The only argument to that that I can see<br/>\nwould be the opposite: historical facts are better<br/>\nfound in fiction than in history books. Is this what<br/>\nyou, Nina, and you, Onnagozen, are indeed saying? Can<br/>\nyou please explain how in the world you would reach<br/>\nthis conclusion? I think it&#39;s fairly cynical (and<br/>\ntrust me, I&#39;m as cynical as they come, so you can<br/>\nimagine my shock) to say that watching a move would<br/>\nteach you more about actual, factual history than<br/>\nopening a history book would. While today&#39;s kids may<br/>\nembrace that method of teaching, personally, I&#39;d be<br/>\nhorrified if for history class everyday my kids<br/>\nchucked the textbooks and popped in &quot;Gone with the<br/>\nWind&quot; to learn about the US Civil War. As much as I<br/>\nlove Taiga Drama, I don&#39;t see Japanese students<br/>\nwatching &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; as definitive fact of the rise of<br/>\nToyotomi. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

I suppose <br/>\nthat<br/>\none can say that the writer of a book that is labeled &quot;history&quot; usually<br/>\nbelieves that their main point and their main agenda are both correct.<br/>\n---<br/>\nThat is a point that I am willing to concede even though I disagree <br/>\nwith it somewhat.  But even granting it&#39;s validity, regardless of the <br/>\nbaggage with which a historian comes to a particular subject, they <br/>\nstill must support any conclusions that they make.  That is, for <br/>\nanything that is not undisputed and requires that the historian &#39;fill <br/>\nin the gaps&#39;, they must present the evidence that brought them to <br/>\nwhatever conclusion they have reached.  It is then up to the reader to <br/>\njudge whether the writer has been successful at their task of <br/>\nconvincing the audience based upon the available evidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nNina wrote:<br/>\nHow many times have you read history books that, for instance, state <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&quot;the following IS the story of the 47 Ako ronin&#39;s revenge&quot; and then <br/>\nread a<br/>\ndescription that is full of suppositions, assumptions, unfounded facts.<br/>\n---<br/>\nNot in many many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nNina wrote:<br/>\nMainly because all of the details simply are not available. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how<br/>\nmany contrasting and conflicting &quot;historical&quot; accounts of the revenge <br/>\nof the<br/>\n47 ronin that I&#39;ve read in who knows how many history books. Like <br/>\nfiction<br/>\nwriters, historical writers will &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; with suppositions <br/>\nwhen<br/>\nthe actual empirical evidence doesn&#39;t exist. So to say outright that <br/>\neach<br/>\nand every history book is &quot;to try and be correct&quot; misses the point <br/>\nbecause<br/>\nthat is not the case with all of them.<br/>\n---<br/>\nIt has, in fact, been the case with every book on Japanese history that <br/>\nI have read in the last 8 years or so.  Mainly because I stick to <br/>\nwritings by professional historians whose careers are built/destroyed <br/>\non the rigor that they apply to their subjects.  One book (or article <br/>\nfor that matter) full of speculation and unfounded claims would in <br/>\nshort order end their careers as historians.<br/>\n<br/>\nNina wrote:<br/>\nThere really isn&#39;t any problem with historical writers doing some <br/>\n&quot;filling<br/>\nin&quot; with suppositions and assumptions when actual sources aren&#39;t <br/>\navailable.<br/>\nIf a writer is actually trying to write a correct account, then he/she <br/>\nwill<br/>\ntell us that the account that has been written is speculative. What is<br/>\nprobably the best way to tell us about a certain event is to present <br/>\nseveral<br/>\nversions that could be deducted from what empirical facts are available <br/>\nand<br/>\nthen discuss which version makes the most sense to the writer.<br/>\n---<br/>\nIndeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNina wrote:<br/>\nBut in my experience, most history writers don&#39;t do this.

So, while I am interested <br/>\nin the incident of the 47 ronin and the fascination that it holds as a <br/>\nbit of cultural legacy, I wouldn&#39;t expect an historical account to be <br/>\nable to provide me with he-said/she-said kind of details.  Who said <br/>\nwhat to whom and how 47 guys planned a &#39;secret&#39; attack, nearly 4 <br/>\ncenturies ago is (and should be) beyond the powers of historiography.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNina wrote:<br/>\nOne of the other posters mentioned &quot;peer review&quot; as if somehow that <br/>\nmakes<br/>\nthe historical work certified in some way as &quot;accurate&quot; and therefore <br/>\nnot to<br/>\nbe questioned. Peers can be just as human, have just as many agendas of<br/>\ntheir own to push as the author does. Even those peers with tons of <br/>\nletters<br/>\nand degrees behind their name can have agendas.<br/>\n---<br/>\nI mentioned it.  And while peer review does not guarantee that the <br/>\nwriter&#39;s conclusions are accurate, it does guarantee a couple of <br/>\nthings.  First, it makes sure that other experts in the field have <br/>\nexamined and criticized the work.  It is precisely because these <br/>\nreviewers &#39;can be just as human, have just as many agendas of their own <br/>\nto push as the author does&#39; that their review is valuable.  While they <br/>\nall have presumably read the relevant sources (both primary and <br/>\nsecondary), they all have made their own conclusions and therefore can <br/>\nhave the opportunity to engage the writing and point out areas that <br/>\nlack adequate support, are unfounded, etc.  Second, peer review allows <br/>\nthe reader to assume a certain amount of fact-checking has occurred.  <br/>\nSo, when an author states that on a certain page of a certain source a <br/>\ncertain claim is made, the reader can be confident that if they too go <br/>\nto the source, they will find what they are looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot quite sure why the &#39;letters and degrees behind their name&#39; idea <br/>\nseems to pop up so much.  While I doctorate in history (or related <br/>\nfield) does not make one perfect, I think we can agree that there is <br/>\nworthwhile training that occurs in postgraduate programs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNina wrote:<br/>\nI hate to say it, but history isn&#39;t like computer programming or <br/>\nmathematics<br/>\n(my fields of expertise) with clear-cut divisions between &quot;true&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;false.&quot; So we&#39;re going to have several different versions of &quot;the <br/>\nfacts&quot;<br/>\nand we&#39;re going to have to learn to use our own heads to read several<br/>\nsources and decide for ourselves. We will each come up with different<br/>\nconclusions and therefore, we can have lists like this one to exchange<br/>\nideas.<br/>\n---<br/>\nNot so.  We can say with accuracy on which day of which month of which <br/>\nyear, some became shogun.  We can say with certainty that a certain <br/>\nHosokawa What&#39;shisname commanded troops during the Onin War, and it <br/>\nwould be false to say that someone else did.  But there are some things <br/>\nthat the historical endeavor can not say definitively.  But I contend <br/>\nthat that is true in subjects like computer science as well.  Can you <br/>\nsay that a hash sort is better than a recursive quick sort?  I believe <br/>\nthe answer is that it depends on the amount of data to be stored, how <br/>\none determines the hash key, etc.  So in history as well as the <br/>\nsciences there are things that can be said with certainty and those <br/>\nthings that must be qualified, or just plain remain speculative.<br/>\n<br/>\nNina wrote:<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nNow to get on a level of my own experience. When I decided to write <br/>\n&quot;Stray<br/>\nDogs,&quot; a fictional account of the life of one of the 47 Ako ronin, Fuwa<br/>\nKazuemon (anyone can read the story on the Samurai Archives web site), I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t write the story to &quot;entertain.&quot; I also did NOT write the story to<br/>\nstate that this is THE FACTS about his life. I couldn&#39;t do that and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\nknow any historian, even those with multiple degrees in history who <br/>\ncould.<br/>\nSimply because so many gaps exist in his life. I wrote the story <br/>\nbecause I<br/>\nam interested in this man&#39;s life and thus wanted to delve into it a bit<br/>\nmore.<br/>\n---<br/>\n&#39;I also did NOT write the story to state that this is THE FACTS about <br/>\nhis life.&#39;  &lt;-- Makes sense to me, since it is, as you say, a fictional <br/>\naccount.  It seems perfectly reasonable to me take a historical <br/>\npersonage and write fiction based upon them, using the available <br/>\ninformation as a &#39;jumping off point&#39;.  I would say that this is what <br/>\nClavell does to great effect in _Shogun_, but knowing that your writing <br/>\nis fictional (like the film Seppuku), I am going to doubt the <br/>\nveracity/accuracy of anything I read in there that isn&#39;t foot-/end- <br/>\nnoted.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;I don&#39;t know any historian, even those with multiple degrees in <br/>\nhistory...&#39;  &lt;-- Still not sure what this is all about.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSo in history there are things that are knowable and my position is <br/>\nthat all sources are not created equal.  No sources can be accepted <br/>\nwith an uncritical eye, but primary sources are best, properly cited <br/>\nand peer-reviewed secondary sources (based on primary sources) come <br/>\nnext.  My personal opinion is that narrative histories -- histories <br/>\nthat try to tell a story in a story format -- too often fall into the <br/>\nRashomon trap.  That is, the &#39;story&#39; lies in the eye of the beholder.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shannon</div>",
