            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2087993231\">The Shinsengumi <br/>\n So who were they? In the 1860s, Japan was in tumult as the Tokugawa regime looked to be coming to an end. Anti-shogun feelings were running high following the capitulation to the Black Ships. Revere the Emperor, Expel the Foreigners (Sonno joi) was the slogan of the day. <br/>\nTo counteract supporters of the emperor, who had gathered in Kyoto, the shogunate set up a special police force who were recruited from amongst the leading swordsmen of Edo. But after being sent to Kyoto, many turned out to sympathise with the opposition. The group was disbanded, though a nucleus remained behind to continue. <br/>\nThe most prominent member was an arrogant samurai called Serizawa Kamo who took advantage of his position by running up debts, abusing women and picking fights. The gang had such a bad reputation that it was named Mibu-ro, a wordplay referring to their base at Mibu which could mean either Mibu ronin or Mibu wolves. <br/>\nSerizawa was assassinated in an internal plot, thought to have been carried out by Kondo Isami and his right-hand man Hijikata Toshizo, who became the new leaders. Though not samurai themselves, they were dedicated men who believed in warrior ethics (bushido) and embodied the groups slogan: Sincerity (Makoto). <br/>\nThe group lived by a strict code, known as gohatto. Amongst its stipulations was that once you became a member, you could never leave. Brotherhood was cherished, and private life came a distant second. <br/>\nThe most famous incident involving the Shinsengumi was that at Ikedeya (1864). Realising that an anti-shogun group was plotting assassinations, the Shinsengumi attacked the inn where the group was staying and routed them. Outstanding in this was master swordsman, Okita Soji. Five years younger than Kondo and Hijikata, he was a handsome and dashing figure who had tuberculosis. Following this, the fame of the Shinsengumi spread, and recruits flocked to join them. Though they fought valiantly, the shogunate collapsed around them and they were driven out of Kyoto. Yet they continued to fight, even after the shogun himself had given up. In the end, almost all were killed or took their own lives<br/>\n<br/>\nijinmibu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ijinmibu@...\">ijinmibu@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nDoes anyone know alot about them couse i want so if you could tell me <br/>\nwhat u know that would help thank.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\nSamurai Japan Japan airline <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYAHOO!
