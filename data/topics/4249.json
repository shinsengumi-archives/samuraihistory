If  <br/>\nwe are talking about the Edo period hairstyles were strictly coded for  <br/>\nclass, rank and privaledge. Young men usually did not shave their heads  <br/>\nuntil they took the Gempuku, coming of age, even then some might have  <br/>\nworn a long forelock. Thus in film we see older &quot;boys&quot; chided for  <br/>\nwearing this childish haiirstyle even though they are men or nearly  <br/>\nmen. Also not uncommon for &quot;gay&quot; characters to wear the same style even  <br/>\nthough they are older.<br/>\n      An adult male attached to a lord would shave his forelock, a ronin or  <br/>\nnon-conformist, might not. The many different styles mentioned above  <br/>\nmeant that a persons class and status were instantly recognizable.  <br/>\nSamurai top-knots were set straight while farmers and merchants were  <br/>\nset to one side or the other, how the end was cut, the material used to  <br/>\ntie it and a dozen other things were proscribed by law.<br/>\n      Sasama tells us that the hair could either be worn loose or up, in a  <br/>\nknot when wearing Oyoroi. At the time Heian gentlemen worn eboshi, a  <br/>\nsoft hat. Because it was soft it would fold over and these were known  <br/>\nas hire-eboshi, a stiff lacquered version was worn with kabuto,  <br/>\nwrapping the hair it was pulled thru the tehen at the top of the helmet  <br/>\nbowl. Being associated with the Bushi class they became known as  <br/>\n&quot;Samurai Eboshi.&quot; Heian fashion, not unlike today was a very particular  <br/>\nworld with strict rules; a few loose hairs was tantamount to farting in  <br/>\nsomeones face, so any loose hairs were plucked.<br/>\n      There are several theories as to the rise of Chon-mage. One has it  <br/>\nthat shaving was more convenient than plucking for when wearing boshi  <br/>\nbut  the hairstyle remained even when the hat fell out of use. Another  <br/>\nsays the hat fell out of use because shaving the head became popular.  <br/>\nThere is the Nobunaga theory; he got fed up with plucking and said &quot;Oh  <br/>\njust shave it!&quot;, and the Jesuit theory; the style adopted by European  <br/>\nmonks became a nationwide fad (my favorite).The Mohawk theory; it was  <br/>\nconsidered so manly and fiercesome no warrior could do without it.   <br/>\nSome say that taking the time to dress the hair before battle in an age  <br/>\nof constant warfare was useless and wasteful, so shaved heads were the  <br/>\nnorm for warriors ( I think this one is the strongest argument).<br/>\n      It all seems to have come about in the Sengoku Jidai, though it  <br/>\nstarted earlier, thats why I like the last theory, no one seems to be  <br/>\nsaying it was specifically because of or for the wearing of helmets.<br/>\n<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\nPS many Sumo-tori were of Samurai class or recieved promotion to such  <br/>\nwhen very successful by the late Edo it was de rigeur...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

The many different styles mentioned above  <br/>\nmeant that a persons class and status were instantly recognizable.  <br/>\nSamurai top-knots were set straight while farmers and merchants were  <br/>\nset to one side or the other, how the end was cut, the material used to  <br/>\ntie it and a dozen other things were proscribed by law.<br/>\n\tSasama tells us that the hair could either be worn loose or up, in a  <br/>\nknot when wearing Oyoroi. At the time Heian gentlemen worn eboshi, a  <br/>\nsoft hat. Because it was soft it would fold over and these were known  <br/>\nas hire-eboshi, a stiff lacquered version was worn with kabuto,  <br/>\nwrapping the hair it was pulled thru the tehen at the top of the helmet  <br/>\nbowl. Being associated with the Bushi class they became known as  <br/>\n&quot;Samurai Eboshi.&quot; Heian fashion, not unlike today was a very particular  <br/>\nworld with strict rules; a few loose hairs was tantamount to farting in  <br/>\nsomeones face, so any loose hairs were plucked.<br/>\n\tThere are several theories as to the rise of Chon-mage. One has it  <br/>\nthat shaving was more convenient than plucking for when wearing boshi  <br/>\nbut  the hairstyle remained even when the hat fell out of use. Another  <br/>\nsays the hat fell out of use because shaving the head became popular.  <br/>\nThere is the Nobunaga theory; he got fed up with plucking and said &quot;Oh  <br/>\njust shave it!&quot;, and the Jesuit theory; the style adopted by European  <br/>\nmonks became a nationwide fad (my favorite).The Mohawk theory; it was  <br/>\nconsidered so manly and fiercesome no warrior could do without it.   <br/>\nSome say that taking the time to dress the hair before battle in an age  <br/>\nof constant warfare was useless and wasteful, so shaved heads were the  <br/>\nnorm for warriors ( I think this one is the strongest argument).<br/>\n\tIt all seems to have come about in the Sengoku Jidai, though it  <br/>\nstarted earlier, thats why I like the last theory, no one seems to be  <br/>\nsaying it was specifically because of or for the wearing of helmets.<br/>\n<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\nPS many Sumo-tori were of Samurai class or recieved promotion to such  <br/>\nwhen very successful by the late Edo it was de rigeur...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1548572299\">The first recorded sumo tournament was held by Empress Kogyoku in 642 for a visiting group of Baekche officials. From that point the sport became an intrinsic part of the martial tournaments, along with equestrianism and archery, with the sumaibito/sumotori drawn from across the country appointed to represent either the Right or Left garrisons of the Imperial Guard. Later Minamoto no Yoritomo was a great fan, holding bouts at the Tsuruoka Hachimangu Shrine, then later Oda Nobunaga who organized a 1,500 strong bout at Azuchi-jou in 1578. During the Edojidai, numerous ronin turned to sumo in the entertainment quarters of Edo or Kyoto, while others served daimyo, receiving a stipend and receiving samurai status. The rikishi are surely continuing their fondness for &#39;traditional Japan&#39;,  but so are those who hold traditional style weddings, wear yukata in the summer, learn ikebana or sado, et alia. Sumo was not a separate institution but part of the fabric of court, and later samurai,<br/>\n life, and therefore it is only natural that the fashions and traditions should pass over. <br/>\nM.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1233634789\">The &#39;chonmage&#39; style of topknot worn by sumo wrestlers (or &#39;oichomage&#39; for the top rikishi) copies the fashions of the 18th century. These find their precedents in Japan among the court styles of the Heian-jidai, with earlier examples unsurprisingly seen in T&#39;ang China. Many sources perpetuate the theory that the style was adopted, by both samurai and ashigaru to facilitate the wearing of a helmet, and give a greater cushion to the skull (a principle still seen sumo, in which the topknot is also to protect the heads during falls). In the Edojidai, the topknot was common throughout society, with the shaved front more than likely a fashion decision for the traditionally flambuoyant samurai.<br/>\nM.Lorimer  <br/>\n<br/>\nOyakata &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nOn Fri, 16 Apr 2004 12:47:41 +0530, miles gilbert¤µ¤ó wrote in message &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MKNAKNIBIAPECBAA@...\">MKNAKNIBIAPECBAA@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve read a fair amount about this topic, however most of the infomation <br/>\n&gt;seems to be inconsistent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am by no means an expert on this topic so hopefully you&#39;ll get <br/>\nmore knowelgeable replies.
