            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1373759497\">Hey all<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to say I enjoyed the conversation Carmen&#39;s message prompted (Well, most of it. <br/>\nSome of it was kind of antagonistic, but whatever). I&#39;m researching the Shimabara Rebellion, <br/>\nparticularly in regard to the interaction between the samurai&#39;s lifestyle/beliefs and his newfound <br/>\nChristian faith. Sort of comparable, I suppose, to the Roman Legionnaires that converted in the <br/>\n3rd century (before Xianity was legal in Rome). I&#39;m trying to find out to what extent the rebellion <br/>\nwas religiously motivated, and how they justified their rebellion (what was the 17th century <br/>\nJapanese Christian&#39;s &quot;Just War Theory&quot; - or something along those lines). And just all kinds of <br/>\ngeneral stuff... like what were the common misconceptions of Christianity that the anti-<br/>\nChristian Japanese had. (The Romans thought they were atheists and cannibals). And to what <br/>\nextent was the oppression that prompted the rebellion religiously motivated versus nationally <br/>\nmotivated (anti the religion versus anti the foreigners... in defense of Japanese religion versus <br/>\nin defense of governmental Japan... though there&#39;s probably a mix of all these motivations...) <br/>\nWhat role did the Jesuits play in the rebellion? Etc, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich, anybody that has suggestions for books to read that deal with these ideas or <br/>\nparticularly the Shimabara Rebellion, I&#39;d love your suggestions. Just started researching the <br/>\ntopic, so I&#39;m pretty ignorant of the details. Found some websites, but don&#39;t know the good <br/>\nbooks to read. Anything I get I&#39;ll have to order, since my bookstore carries NADA dealing with <br/>\nJapanese history.<br/>\n<br/>\nDan.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Dear Dave, Tom, Karsten, Tim, Jake, Luis, Edy, Thom, Nate et al ---<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many many thanks for all of your posts. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Firstly, to the others who are offended because I brought up this<br/>\n&gt; subject, I am very sorry I did not mean to preach to you, convert you <br/>\n&gt; or convince you into my beliefs. No person can do that. Again, I am <br/>\n&gt; very sorry. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Secondly, to those who were eager to help me with such beautiful<br/>\n&gt; material (eg top 10 misconceptions, Christian samurais) I am extremely<br/>\n&gt; grateful.  Thank you so much! I&#39;m learning a lot from you guys. I will<br/>\n&gt; check out the sites and the info you&#39;ve given me and will hope to share<br/>\n&gt; what I think of them in the  near future.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thirdly, I was able to get hold of a copy of the book &quot;A Higher Honor&quot; by<br/>\n&gt; Robert Boardman. I&#39;ve just read through the preface and it looks like a highly<br/>\n&gt; enjoyable read! The author used to fight against the Japanese army until<br/>\n&gt; he was sent back to the land of the rising sun in a different capacity and he<br/>\n&gt; wrote about the honor and commtiment of the people who used to be his enemy <br/>\n&gt; but whom he has now come to love.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Domo arigato!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Carmen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ===========================================<br/>\n&gt; Yeah,christians could learn a lot from Bushido.They could be braver.....Edy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ====================================<br/>\n&gt; Hi Carmen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  If you&#39;re new to this subject (as I also am) I would sugest &quot;The top 10<br/>\n&gt;  misconceptions of the samurai&quot; -<br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  That certainly cleared some things up, like the bushido code for<br/>\n&gt;  example.   ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Luis<br/>\n&gt; ======================================<br/>\n&gt; Brave men and cowards alike, exist in all religions. Many samurai and followers <br/>\n&gt; of bushido <br/>\n&gt; were christians, some of which died very bravely for their religion........<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dave Jackson<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ======================================<br/>\n&gt; Carmen et al-<br/>\n&gt; \tIf christians have lots to learn from Samurai, then I would suggest <br/>\n&gt; they could learn it ALL from Christian Samurai. I would examine the <br/>\n&gt; history of christianity in Kyushu and the lives of the Christian <br/>\n&gt; Daimyo, sounds like a natural subject for your interests...<br/>\n&gt; -t<br/>\n&gt; =====================================<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Carmen,<br/>\n&gt; please keep in mind that bushido was only what people made out of it. First<br/>\n&gt; of all its a rather hollow shell and it depends on what you do with it.<br/>\n&gt; Otherwise it�s just an ideal that some reached and some didn�t.<br/>\n&gt; Remember also all the bad things that happened when certain people called on<br/>\n&gt; the bushido &gt; WWII is only one example...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Karsten Helmholz<br/>\n&gt; Germany<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =======================================<br/>\n&gt; Hey.<br/>\n&gt;        I was thinking about this as I read some of the posts on this topic.  <br/>\n&gt; It seems that there are at least one or two very large similarities between <br/>\n&gt; Christianity (which I am by no means an expert on) and Bushido (99.9999% of my <br/>\n&gt; knowledge of which came from this list).  Both call for unquestioned service to <br/>\n&gt; a (L)ord and both have followers very willingly giving their lives for that <br/>\n&gt; (L)ord if and when the need arises.  It&#39;s just a matter of the direction.  <br/>\n&gt; Bushido, the lord is a human one.  Christianity, a spiritual One.  I do agree <br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; many (most?!) Christians could learn to be braver through studying Bushido, <br/>\n&gt; though, myself included.  That Christian samurai were willing to give their <br/>\n&gt; lives for either (or both) of their (L)ords is testament to how devoted they <br/>\n&gt; were <br/>\n&gt; to their religion and to their code, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.<br/>\n&gt;        Take care.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; L8r.<br/>\n&gt; Tim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =======================================<br/>\n&gt; Hey Carmen,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here are some prominant Christian Samurai that I know<br/>\n&gt; of:<br/>\n&gt; Otomo Sorin<br/>\n&gt; Kuroda Yoshitaka<br/>\n&gt; Arima Harunobu<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also check out the Shimabara Rebelion 1637-1638<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also though there may have been Christain Samurai,<br/>\n&gt; Christianity was viewed as a potential threat(foreign<br/>\n&gt; powers namely the Portuguese) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi<br/>\n&gt; and the Tokugawa Shogunate. Their crack down on<br/>\n&gt; christianity wasn&#39;t so much hatred toward christains<br/>\n&gt; as much as eliminating a disruptive force. The<br/>\n&gt; samurai(Oda Nobunaga) also cracked down on the Buddist<br/>\n&gt; Ikko Sect for the same reasons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jake<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
