            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-543666905\">Hi Ben,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe oyumi (crossbow) you refer to was used extensively in the wars against<br/>\nthe Emishi but fell out of use because it required skilled technicians to<br/>\nbuild, maintain & train the troops. Its decline was accelerated when the<br/>\ngovernment drop the Taiho military system (conscription) and privatised<br/>\nmilitary responsibilties to the various clans.<br/>\n<br/>\nPacification of the Ainu (or Emishi) peoples occurred around 800&#39;s and was<br/>\ncomplete by 811. The Emishi of Dewa & Mutsu revolted numerous times over<br/>\nthe next 100 years mainly due to famine or economic hardship. All this<br/>\noccured in the middle Hein period  before samurai came of age. The use of<br/>\nthe oyumi is not recorded after 900 as far as I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Nicholas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fifthchamber@...\">fifthchamber@...</a> on 21 April, 2001 07:47:42 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\ncc:<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject:  [samuraihistory] Introductions...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all..<br/>\n My name is Ben Sharples and I am a student in London, England.
