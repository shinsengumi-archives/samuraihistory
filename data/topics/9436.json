Ive been involved in loving history education for almost 13<br/>\nyears doing American Civil War and until the last couple of years,<br/>\nWWII.  Ive set my sights on something that isnt done a lot, especially<br/>\non the Eastern part of the U.S.  I dig &quot;dresing up&quot; and doing<br/>\nconferences at high schools and elementary schools (the little ones<br/>\n*love* it) and the like and I think World history teachers would<br/>\nreally get a kick out of me bringing in a samurai kit!  Ive done my<br/>\nCivil War schpeel at quite a few schools and I need something fresh<br/>\nthats more my thing.  I like Civil War, but Im a real nut for this!<br/>\n<br/>\nIve been studying sengoku jidai for a few yeas now.  Ive poured<br/>\nthrough turnbull and bottomly and a few translated works.

Any little bit helps!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if anyone has books that deal with &quot;daily life&quot; articles, I<br/>\nwould love to learn of those too.
