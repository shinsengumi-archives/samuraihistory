            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2092948324\">From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:murphymurphyjohn@...\">murphymurphyjohn@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: Armor: armpit Re:From Leprechaun Jack Murphy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While I hold no brief as an expert in armour,  offhand it seems that the <br/>\n&gt;armourers of Western Europe were much more concerned with the articulation of <br/>\n&gt;their armor than those in Japan.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>??? I agree with one of these points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Whether Gothic or Maximilian,  German or Italian <br/>\n&gt;or French, the armourers seemed to take more care in what we would call the <br/>\n&gt;ergonomics of armor than did their contemporaries in Japan.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since Japanese armor seems highly flexible, with a large amount of <br/>\nadjustment, they obviously thought that fit was important. I think that <br/>\nany of the reenacting types that have used reproductions of both <br/>\nprobably don&#39;t feel much difference in that. Also I don&#39;t think it would <br/>\nbe possible in summer to fight in Japan using European armor. You would <br/>\ndie from the heat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If one studies <br/>\n&gt;merely the arm defenses of both knight and samurai...not getting into the <br/>\n&gt;technical terms French or Japanese..it seems apparent (at least to me)  that there <br/>\n&gt;was more technical sophistication, including armpit armor,  in the armor shops <br/>\n&gt;of Augsburg than in Sakai.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really doubt that, I suspect the craftsmen built the best of what was <br/>\nwanted. The Japanese were fine workers of metal in period.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Of course, the question arises also did Japan have <br/>\n&gt;the mineral resources to produce all the steel armor  that Europe had?  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but I don&#39;t think they would have ever used full plate because of <br/>\nthier climate. Trained knights swooned and died in armor in 60-70 degree <br/>\nweather, what would happen at 95+?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Josh Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordwilson@...\">lordwilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Of course, the question arises also did Japan have <br/>\n&gt;the mineral resources to produce all the steel armor  that Europe had?  Jack&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nope.. thats why they used iron sparingly in their armour and for the most part it was made out of leather.. the iron they had went towards swords...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While leather was used in armor, one hell of a lot of iron was used as <br/>\nwell. Why not look at Anthony Bryant&#39;s site on the subject? It will <br/>\nserve as a great intro to the subject, actually more than intro! and you <br/>\ncan find out how it&#39;s really made.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/katchu/0.Katchu.html\">http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/katchu/0.Katchu.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J.

The vast majority of armours -- especially post 1500 <br/>\n&gt;-- were made entirely of metal. Armour-grade leather was more problematic than <br/>\n&gt;armour-grade iron.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The guru speaks but does not pass on the site of all wisdom ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
