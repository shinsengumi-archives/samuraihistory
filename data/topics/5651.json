I understand samurai would were the crest of<br/>\n&gt; the clan he was joined with.  I was also wondering<br/>\n&gt; about facial hair.  I have seen some traditional<br/>\n&gt; pictures of older or senior men with facial hair and<br/>\n&gt; younger men having the clean shave.  This may seem<br/>\n&gt; very stupid but was having facial hair a symbol of<br/>\n&gt; seniority or age?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Robert:<br/>\n<br/>\nI take it from your email address that you might be in<br/>\nthe military? I am too--US Army. Anyways, they didn&#39;t<br/>\nreally have anything quite like we did--no rank<br/>\ninsignia or anything like sergeant&#39;s stripes or<br/>\ngeneral&#39;s stars. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeniority within a clan would be shown in various<br/>\nways--seating arrangements at a conference, for<br/>\nexample. The higher ups up front, lesser samurai at<br/>\nthe back, of course. A higher ranking samurai would<br/>\nprobably have slightly better clothing, etc, because<br/>\nof better economic status (larger fief). On the<br/>\nbattlefield, he&#39;d command more soldiers, and<br/>\ncommanders of sufficient rank would be allowed to have<br/>\ntheir own standard--kind of like a flag rank officer<br/>\nhaving his own flag in the modern military. Mostly,<br/>\nthough, it was just &quot;known&quot; who outranked whom. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as facial hair goes, I&#39;m not sure if there was<br/>\nany set &quot;you must be XX old to have a beard&quot;. I think<br/>\nit was just a fashion thing--some men wore beards,<br/>\nsome didn&#39;t. I know that it was thought to &quot;look<br/>\ndistinguished&quot;, which is why many of the higher ups<br/>\nwore fake facial hair (Hideyoshi supposedly wore a<br/>\nfake mustache at times). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n            <br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
