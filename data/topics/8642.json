In it&#39;s  <br/>\ncurrent state the broken blade is just 3shaku 2sun 2bu(99.4cm) and  <br/>\nhalf of the original pole is burnt away. There are three mekugi-ana  <br/>\nin the heavily rusted nakago and no signature is visible. Temple  <br/>\nrecords suggest that it was damaged in an earthquake sometime in the  <br/>\nAnsei period.<br/>\n\tIt is said he was the head of the Iga ninja clan and a splendid  <br/>\nwarrior. There was a popular saying;<br/>\n\tTokugawa-dono wa hito mochi yo<br/>\n\tHattori Hanzo Oni Hanzo<br/>\n\tWatanabe Hanzo Yari Hanzo<br/>\n\tAtsumi Gengo wa Kubitori Gengo<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLord Tokugawa is a man rich with able men<br/>\n\tHattori Hanzo &quot;The Demon Hanzo&quot;<br/>\n\tWatanabe Hanzo &quot;Hanzo the spear&quot;<br/>\n\tAtsumi Gengo &quot;The Headhunter Gengo&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Kansei Kafu records that Hattori Hanzo was crucial in the attack  <br/>\nof Kakegawa-jo. His contribution was noted in the battles of Anegawa,  <br/>\nUshikubo, Kozakai and Takatenjin and he earned special merit at  <br/>\nMikatagahara.<br/>\n\tAt Hamamatsu-jo he was presented with a Yari, and given command of  <br/>\n150 Iga no mono. It is not clear if this THE spear he was presented  <br/>\nwith. Afterward he defeated Chikuwan, a Takeda spy and took as prize  <br/>\nhis Soshu Hiromasa Kaiken (tanto), a deed for which he was given an  <br/>\nOboshi kabuto, a yoroi and a saihai.<br/>\n\tAt the time of the attack on the Honno-ji, Iyeyasu needed to return  <br/>\nquickly to Mikawa. It was Hattori and his Iga men that provided the  <br/>\nbody guard on that trip. Iyeyasu rewarded him with Ishimi no mura,  <br/>\nwith an estimated annual rice production of 8000 koku. He took up  <br/>\nresidence within Edo castle where to this day the Hanzo gate honors  <br/>\nhis name. Hanzo died in Keicho gannen aged 55. The original Sainen-ji  <br/>\nwas located just outside the Hanzo-mon until it was moved to it&#39;s  <br/>\npresent location for the expansion of Edo Castle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere is a picture of this yari in the catalog of the Nihon no Meiso  <br/>\nexhibition. If I get the chance I will try to scan it in and post it  <br/>\nin the photo albums, though I have to say it isn&#39;t much to look at...<br/>\n-t</div>",
