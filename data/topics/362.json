The image you&#39;ve got in your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  head is from the Edo period. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is something I&#39;ve got from the &quot;Online dictionary of history and<br/>\n&gt; traditions&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/search?dbname=histg&sword=hakama)\">http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/search?dbname=histg&sword=hakama)</a> :<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;As  attested  by  Haniwa  doll  of  Kofun  period,  origin  of hakama<br/>\n&gt; (Japanese  trousers)  was  very old. Under an influence of the Chinese<br/>\n&gt; civilization, the usage of hakama had declined during Heian period and<br/>\n&gt; replaced  by  kimono  with  a long skirt, especially among women. When<br/>\n&gt; samurai  clans  took the power in the middle ages, the usage of hakama<br/>\n&gt; became  again  popular  among  men. Hakama for women resurfaced during<br/>\n&gt; Meiji period as a girl&#39;s school uniform.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another source (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shindai.com/articles/hakama.htm)\">http://www.shindai.com/articles/hakama.htm)</a> states the<br/>\n&gt; following (+ some more info):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;A  hakama  is  the  skirt-like pants that some aikidoka wear. It is a<br/>\n&gt; traditional  piece of samurai clothing. The standard gi worn in aikido<br/>\n&gt; as well as in other martial arts such as Judo or Karate was originally<br/>\n&gt; underclothes. Wearing it is part of the tradition of (most schools of)<br/>\n&gt; aikido.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The  hakama  were  originally  meant to protect a horseman&#39;s legs from<br/>\n&gt; brush, etc., - not unlike a cowboy&#39;s leather &#39;chaps&#39;. Leather was hard<br/>\n&gt; to  come  by  in  Japan,  so  heavy  cloth was used instead. After the<br/>\n&gt; samurai as a class dismounted and became more like foot-soldiers, they<br/>\n&gt; persisted  in  wearing  horseman&#39;s  garb because it set them apart and<br/>\n&gt; made them easily identifiable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There were different styles of hakama though. The type worn by today&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; martial  artists  -  with  &quot;legs&quot; - is called a joba hakama, (roughly,<br/>\n&gt; horseriding  thing  into  which  one steps). A hakama that was kind of<br/>\n&gt; like  a  tube  skirt - no legs - another and the third was a very long<br/>\n&gt; version of the second. It was worn on visits to the Shogun or Emperor.<br/>\n&gt; The  thing  was  about  12-15  feet long and was folded repeatedly and<br/>\n&gt; placed   between   the   feet  and  posterior  of  the  visitor.  This<br/>\n&gt; necessitated their shikko (&quot;knee walking&quot;) for their audience and made<br/>\n&gt; it  extremely unlikely that they could hide a weapon (retainers suited<br/>\n&gt; them up) or rise quickly to make an attack.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope  some pieces of this info might be useful to you, guys. And it is<br/>\n&gt; interesting that I also heard soe time ago from one of my friends that<br/>\n&gt; hakama  was  used to camouflage your legs&#39; moves, but I never actually<br/>\n&gt; read about that...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.s.

Under an influence of the Chinese<br/>\ncivilization, the usage of hakama had declined during Heian period and<br/>\nreplaced  by  kimono  with  a long skirt, especially among women. When<br/>\nsamurai  clans  took the power in the middle ages, the usage of hakama<br/>\nbecame  again  popular  among  men. Hakama for women resurfaced during<br/>\nMeiji period as a girl&#39;s school uniform.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother source (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shindai.com/articles/hakama.htm)\">http://www.shindai.com/articles/hakama.htm)</a> states the<br/>\nfollowing (+ some more info):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A  hakama  is  the  skirt-like pants that some aikidoka wear. It is a<br/>\ntraditional  piece of samurai clothing. The standard gi worn in aikido<br/>\nas well as in other martial arts such as Judo or Karate was originally<br/>\nunderclothes. Wearing it is part of the tradition of (most schools of)<br/>\naikido.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe  hakama  were  originally  meant to protect a horseman&#39;s legs from<br/>\nbrush, etc., - not unlike a cowboy&#39;s leather &#39;chaps&#39;. Leather was hard<br/>\nto  come  by  in  Japan,  so  heavy  cloth was used instead. After the<br/>\nsamurai as a class dismounted and became more like foot-soldiers, they<br/>\npersisted  in  wearing  horseman&#39;s  garb because it set them apart and<br/>\nmade them easily identifiable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were different styles of hakama though. The type worn by today&#39;s<br/>\nmartial  artists  -  with  &quot;legs&quot; - is called a joba hakama, (roughly,<br/>\nhorseriding  thing  into  which  one steps). A hakama that was kind of<br/>\nlike  a  tube  skirt - no legs - another and the third was a very long<br/>\nversion of the second. It was worn on visits to the Shogun or Emperor.<br/>\nThe  thing  was  about  12-15  feet long and was folded repeatedly and<br/>\nplaced   between   the   feet  and  posterior  of  the  visitor.  This<br/>\nnecessitated their shikko (&quot;knee walking&quot;) for their audience and made<br/>\nit  extremely unlikely that they could hide a weapon (retainers suited<br/>\nthem up) or rise quickly to make an attack.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope  some pieces of this info might be useful to you, guys. And it is<br/>\ninteresting that I also heard soe time ago from one of my friends that<br/>\nhakama  was  used to camouflage your legs&#39; moves, but I never actually<br/>\nread about that...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.s.  My first post to the group. Please, do not take too skeptical...<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n Yauheni Zamastsyanin                       mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yauheni.z@...\">yauheni.z@...</a></div>",

I&#39;m a little<br/>\n&gt; skeptical--it sounds like something out of Martial<br/>\n&gt; Arts Illustrated or something. Most images of samurai<br/>\n&gt; you see preparing for a battle or a duel have their<br/>\n&gt; hakama tied back with leggings to keep them out of the<br/>\n&gt; way (assuming they aren&#39;t in armor, which would keep<br/>\n&gt; the clothing out of the way by definition.) Kobakama,<br/>\n&gt; or shorter, tighter hakama, were frequently worn when<br/>\n&gt; &quot;expecting action&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Were hakama worn exclusively by the samurai class,<br/>\n&gt; then maybe I could see your answer making sense. But<br/>\n&gt; how would that explain nagabakama, worn by courtiers<br/>\n&gt; and samurai during court functions? I&#39;m no clothing<br/>\n&gt; historian, but I know we&#39;ve got some here. Tony? Lady<br/>\n&gt; Solveig? Care to enlighten us further? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course, I could just look at Tony&#39;s website: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html\">http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hakama worn by commoners and laborers in Heian were<br/>\n&gt; two panel, and typically only reached to the mid-calf<br/>\n&gt; or a bit lower. During the sixteenth century,<br/>\n&gt; low-class warriors often wore a knee-length two- or<br/>\n&gt; three-panel hakama which were sometimes called<br/>\n&gt; kobakama, a terminology problem as regular hakama were<br/>\n&gt; also called kobakama in the Edo period owing to the<br/>\n&gt; formal nagabakama being the &quot;formalEnorm.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If hakama were being worn by commoners and laborers,<br/>\n&gt; then I hardly think a critical part of their design<br/>\n&gt; would be to hide the movement of the legs from an<br/>\n&gt; opponent. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Continuing: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Earlier hakama, unlike modern martial arts hakama,<br/>\n&gt; had two clearly defined legs, rather than having the<br/>\n&gt; pleats overlapping left and right so that one can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; tell where one leg ends and the other begins. Another<br/>\n&gt; modern feature is the koshita, the solid panel at the<br/>\n&gt; small of the back. This seems to have appeared<br/>\n&gt; sometime in the early Edo period or at the earliest in<br/>\n&gt; the very late days of the sixteenth century, as<br/>\n&gt; earlier hakama were merely cut straight across the<br/>\n&gt; back as at the front.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If these things were developed in the Edo period, and<br/>\n&gt; hakama were being worn in the Heian period, then they<br/>\n&gt; could hardly be part of the development of hakama. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d still like to see what Tony and others have to<br/>\n&gt; say. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?

I&#39;m a little<br/>\nskeptical--it sounds like something out of Martial<br/>\nArts Illustrated or something. Most images of samurai<br/>\nyou see preparing for a battle or a duel have their<br/>\nhakama tied back with leggings to keep them out of the<br/>\nway (assuming they aren&#39;t in armor, which would keep<br/>\nthe clothing out of the way by definition.) Kobakama,<br/>\nor shorter, tighter hakama, were frequently worn when<br/>\n&quot;expecting action&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWere hakama worn exclusively by the samurai class,<br/>\nthen maybe I could see your answer making sense. But<br/>\nhow would that explain nagabakama, worn by courtiers<br/>\nand samurai during court functions? I&#39;m no clothing<br/>\nhistorian, but I know we&#39;ve got some here. Tony? Lady<br/>\nSolveig? Care to enlighten us further? <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I could just look at Tony&#39;s website: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html\">http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hakama worn by commoners and laborers in Heian were<br/>\ntwo panel, and typically only reached to the mid-calf<br/>\nor a bit lower. During the sixteenth century,<br/>\nlow-class warriors often wore a knee-length two- or<br/>\nthree-panel hakama which were sometimes called<br/>\nkobakama, a terminology problem as regular hakama were<br/>\nalso called kobakama in the Edo period owing to the<br/>\nformal nagabakama being the formal norm.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf hakama were being worn by commoners and laborers,<br/>\nthen I hardly think a critical part of their design<br/>\nwould be to hide the movement of the legs from an<br/>\nopponent. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinuing: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Earlier hakama, unlike modern martial arts hakama,<br/>\nhad two clearly defined legs, rather than having the<br/>\npleats overlapping left and right so that one cant<br/>\ntell where one leg ends and the other begins. Another<br/>\nmodern feature is the koshita, the solid panel at the<br/>\nsmall of the back. This seems to have appeared<br/>\nsometime in the early Edo period or at the earliest in<br/>\nthe very late days of the sixteenth century, as<br/>\nearlier hakama were merely cut straight across the<br/>\nback as at the front.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these things were developed in the Edo period, and<br/>\nhakama were being worn in the Heian period, then they<br/>\ncould hardly be part of the development of hakama. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d still like to see what Tony and others have to<br/>\nsay. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Being a <br/>\nmartial artist alone doesn&#39;t qualify one to answer on matters of <br/>\nJapan. (although I will concede it will give you the ability to infer <br/>\nwhat types of clothing will be fitting for defending yourself while <br/>\nsitting, etc.)  I spent 6 years as a dedicated martial artist before <br/>\nspending two years living in Japan as a student and was utterly <br/>\nshocked about how warped martial artists in the USA view japan and <br/>\nthe beliefs they hold of it (for the record, I was one of them). I am <br/>\nqualified to say this because I was, as I mentioned, a dedicated <br/>\nmartial artist, who before moving to japan listened to and believed <br/>\nall that I heard about Japan from fellow martial artists - who also <br/>\nhad never been there.  If you have lived in Japan, then forgive me.. <br/>\nif not, don&#39;t believe everything that you hear from the martial arts <br/>\ncommunity. There is no other way to say it but to say that it is for <br/>\nthe most part wrong (inane arguments about how to pronounce &#39;ryu&#39;, or <br/>\nthe etiquette of bowing &#39;like they do in Japan&#39;, or most importantly <br/>\nwestern views on how the martial arts are percieved in Japan -- most <br/>\nJapanese either don&#39;t care at all, or view it as a &#39;sport&#39; - <br/>\nsomething like wrestling or hockey).  From what I &#39;knew&#39; before <br/>\nliving in Japan, all Japanese take martial arts, and the samurai <br/>\npracticed in karate dojos all day... Japan is a country like any <br/>\nother, life does not revolve around nature and buddhism and the <br/>\nmartial arts, etc.  I&#39;m not saying that your argument is invalid, <br/>\nhowever the way you phrased your response struck a chord with me.</div>",

I have to disagree.  There are all kinds<br/>\n&gt; of ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise movement<br/>\n&gt; or position.  This is simply not true.  The Samurai<br/>\n&gt; when going in to combat without armor preffered to<br/>\n&gt; were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.

A good example of this is the Long<br/>\n&gt; Hakama worn in the Shoguns palace during the Tokugawa<br/>\n&gt; period which restricted movement making attacks on<br/>\n&gt; others impossible.
