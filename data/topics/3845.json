Could the Shogun be directed <br/>\nmore or less against the samurai as they are the formal head of <br/>\ngoverment?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we could relate this situation to modern day politics.  The <br/>\nShogun held all of Japan&#39;s power (the Emperor had some minor powers <br/>\nthat were dictated by the Shogun), somewhat similar to the U.S. <br/>\nPresident.  We could compare Samurai to politicians (unfair <br/>\ncomparison, I know) vying for the position of power.  Some <br/>\npolitician, let&#39;s say he/she&#39;s a Senator, could have an interesting <br/>\nposition.  In most situations, it is best for the Senator to be <br/>\naligned with and endorsed by the current president.  To be recognized <br/>\nby a person of such power and authority is good for the political <br/>\nfuture of the Senator.  If that same Senator were to run for office <br/>\nagainst the current president, they would be rivals.  The Senator <br/>\nwould then attempt to seperate him/herself from the current <br/>\npresident.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be in a samurai&#39;s benefit to be aligned with the Shogun.  <br/>\nBut if that samurai wanted to be Shogun (and I&#39;m sure almost all of <br/>\nthem had that aspiration) then they would be rivals.  I think this <br/>\nwould be on an individual or perhaps sect basis but not the entire <br/>\nclass of Samurai againt the Shogun.  The Shogun was the top dog in <br/>\nthe Samurai class.  For this reason I&#39;m sure there was jealousy and <br/>\nhatred but he still belonged to that class.  At some point, a Shogun <br/>\nrealized how dangerous it was to be Shogun.  To reduce rivalry, the <br/>\npractice of housing &quot;family guests&quot; (i.e. hostages) in the immediate <br/>\nhouse of the Shogun was common.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I&#39;m not an expert on the Meiji period but wasn&#39;t that when the <br/>\nSamurai class was abolished.  The Shogun was overthrown first so <br/>\nthere would be no Shogun to disagree with.  The Emperor had the <br/>\ndisagreement with the Samurai and the Shogun, probably because his <br/>\noffice, although diefied, held no power for almost 1000 years.  Here, <br/>\nthe direct descendant of the Sun God saw an opportunity, with <br/>\ntechnology and the weakness of the current Shogun; to take power back <br/>\nand once again rule Japan.  According to &quot;Japanese History, 11 <br/>\nexperts reflect on the past&quot; a kodansha book, &quot;The period commenced <br/>\nwith the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate... &quot;</div>",
