Usually this <br/>\nwas after the cut was made, but in later years it was acceptable <br/>\nfor the kaishaku to strike at the moment the condemned man <br/>\nreaches for his own blade - this act demonstating the <br/>\ncondemned man&#39;s determination to take his own life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
