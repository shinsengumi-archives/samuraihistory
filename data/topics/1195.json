            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-930484515\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>\ndeleted at the moderator(s) discretion without explanation. <br/>\nPlease do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a refresher of the rules of the list.  PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:<br/>\n<br/>\nRULES: <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>\ninclude punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>\ncapitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>\nonly for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>\nyou are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>\nspeaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>\n4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>\nthe internet without supervision. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Limit your &quot;internetspeak&quot;. Using abbreviations<br/>\nsuch as &quot;lol&quot; (Laugh out loud), &quot;ROTFLMAO&quot;, etc., are<br/>\nacceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>\nis not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>\ntake spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>\nlazy--see Rule 1. &quot;Smileys&quot; are similarly acceptable<br/>\nin limited usage. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>\nmoderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>\nensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>\ntolerate &quot;flaming&quot; or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>\nanyone. Don&#39;t do it. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>\npersonally. While we won&#39;t allow personal insults, you<br/>\nmust be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>\nespecially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>\nis infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>\nsarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>\nwhine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>\npersonally.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Remember this is a history list. While digressions<br/>\nare allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>\ntopic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>\nas long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>\nhistory; however, these are not &quot;historical&quot; sources.<br/>\nDo not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>\n&quot;Ninja Hattori-kun&quot; was inaccurate, because it<br/>\nprobably was. <br/>\n<br/>\n6. Argue logically. &quot;I saw it on an anime&quot;, &quot;My sensei<br/>\ntold me so&quot;, or &quot;that&#39;s what it says on my Playstation<br/>\ngame&quot; are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>\nrecieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>\ndeserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>\ngood reasons to bring up a question. &quot;In my PS2 game<br/>\nthe main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>\nis that called?&quot; is a good question. &quot;In my PS2 game<br/>\nyou have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>\nfollowed Bushido&quot; is a statement which will get you<br/>\nlaughed at for a month.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.

The most <br/>\nnotable one of recent memory is Raisa Gorbacheva, who, when appearing in <br/>\npublic with Mikhail Gorbachev, ALWAYS walked a step back of him, and very <br/>\nrarely was seen even standing level with him.  I&#39;m guessing it was (and may <br/>\nstill be) a show of deference for whatever his position is -- even if the <br/>\nsociety (in whatever way) dictates (or the man himself dictates, whichever <br/>\nthe case may be) that simply his being a MAN makes him worthy of walking the <br/>\nstep ahead.  (Although I would hope that of the two, it is the first rather <br/>\nthan the second.  The first is undesirable and avoided not without a great <br/>\ndeal of difficulty.  The second, though, is insufferable and avoidable.)  <br/>\nAlthough, I must say, tsukiyo&#39;s notion is at the VERY least, romantic and <br/>\nVERY laudable that a man would want to protect his lady like that.  Although, <br/>\nI would hope that he would only step the step ahead in the case that it were <br/>\nnecessary, and the rest of the time he was with her, that they&#39;d walk <br/>\neven-up.
