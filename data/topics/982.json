There are others, I may get you names later if you have problems <br/>\nwith this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, there was one more Uesugi, who was a sort of &quot;friends&quot; or rather <br/>\nan ally of Western forces prior to Sekigahara.  I believe it was Uesugi <br/>\nKagekatsu who could not strike at Tokugawa&#39;s because he was tied up by Date <br/>\nMasamune from the North and, I think, Maeda Toshie from the West while <br/>\nTokugawa&#39;s army made it South to meet the main Western (Mitsunari&#39;s) army.  <br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim K<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;kallikrates777&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kallikrates777@...\">kallikrates777@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Re:  Uesugi Kenshin<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 25 Jul 2002 16:14:58 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you, Tim!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      I&#39;m really interested.
