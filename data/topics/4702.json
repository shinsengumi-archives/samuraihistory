But are these modern<br/>\nkohaze derived from a period version?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen did the rear split style of tabi and their related kohaze first<br/>\nappear?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sorts of materials where used to make the early kohaze?<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally haven&#39;t found any information earlier than 1906, when they<br/>\nwere being mass produced, probably in copper, by a Japanese company, who<br/>\nsay that their design was based upon a style formally made by hand by<br/>\nskilled craftsman, which at least pushes them back in to the 19th<br/>\ncentury. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the modern ones I&#39;ve seen are of aluminium, often plated in nickel,<br/>\nand on occasion in brass. I&#39;ve seen very large bone ones for book<br/>\nbindings on the net, but so far, nothing else apart from these modern<br/>\nvarieties.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I&#39;ve been informed that such a device was used on a kind of Edo<br/>\nperiod &quot;spat&quot; called a kougake, probably some form of kiahan like<br/>\ngarment (leggings), apparently illustrated on &quot;page 281 of Edo Fukushoku<br/>\nShi. (History of Edo Costume)&quot;, a work that I do not as yet have access<br/>\nto. Many modern kiahan made for martial arts practitioners have kohaze<br/>\nmounted on elastic to achieve a good fit, possibly a hang over of this<br/>\nearlier garment.<br/>\n<br/>\nConfession: I am trying to arrange the reproduction of these items for a<br/>\nmomoyama-jidai living history/role playing project, and if it were<br/>\npossible to simply replace the aluminium kohaze of modern tabi with a<br/>\ncorrect fitting, this would be much easier than having to make tabi from<br/>\nabsolute scratch. Especially as I can now get hold of tabi in<br/>\ntraditionally patterned cloth, rather than just plain dark blue and<br/>\nwhite.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s it, any input would be most appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean</div>",

One koku was the amount of rice required to<br/>\nfeed one person for one year, and served as a measure of wealth for what<br/>\nwas fundamentally an agricultural society. A koku is a fraction over 180<br/>\nlitres of rice or about 300 pounds in weight. Will Adams, the first<br/>\nEnglishman in Japan, in a letter dated 1611 recounted that he and his<br/>\ncrew were each given an income of &quot;2 pounds of rice a day&quot;, which is 2.4<br/>\nkoku a year. IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income exceeding<br/>\n1,000 koku, while the richest daimyo in the land Tokugawa Ieyasu, the<br/>\nfirst of the Edo era shogun&#39;s had an income of over 4 million koku a<br/>\nyear!.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope the chap who posted has hung around to read this, if so I hope<br/>\nyou find this stuff useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Ladies and Gentlemen, as temporary list moderator,<br/>\n&gt;    I&#39;ve had to reject two messages from a certain<br/>\n&gt;    individual in the past day. Granted, these were<br/>\n&gt;    emotional childish outbursts laced with the &quot;f&quot; word,<br/>\n&gt;    but the underlying issue is that we weren&#39;t kind<br/>\n&gt;    enough to answer what a &quot;daimyo&quot; is for the young man.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Yes, I understand that if you do a google search you<br/>\n&gt;    should find an answer in about .03 nanoseconds. Yes, I<br/>\n&gt;    also understand that we are not a crutch for people<br/>\n&gt;    who don&#39;t want to do research. That being said, here&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;    a short answer that hopefully will suffice:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Daimo: &quot;Great Name&quot; a feudal lord of the samurai class<br/>\n&gt;    in pre-Meiji Japan. Daimyo were generally considered<br/>\n&gt;    the pre-eminent ruler in their fief, and controlled<br/>\n&gt;    everything that happened therein. Prior to the<br/>\n&gt;    Tokugawa Shogunate, the Daimyo were essentially<br/>\n&gt;    &quot;warlords&quot; controlling territory by force of arms,<br/>\n&gt;    enlarging it as they could. Subsequently, they held<br/>\n&gt;    their fiefs either by being granted them by the<br/>\n&gt;    Shogunate, or with the Shogunate&#39;s permission,<br/>\n&gt;    anyways. Daimyo had an army of samurai retainers,<br/>\n&gt;    generally speaking, to maintain order in their domains<br/>\n&gt;    and to fight wars when necessary. Once the Tokugawa<br/>\n&gt;    period began, there was a minimum income to be<br/>\n&gt;    considered a &quot;daimyo&quot;--I don&#39;t know off hand what it<br/>\n&gt;    was, but I&#39;m sure you can look it up somewhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    There&#39;s a basic answer. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dean Wayland<br/>\nHead Of The Fight School<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

A koku is a fraction <br/>\n&gt;    over 180<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;litres of rice or about 300 pounds in weight. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    In much of Japan (except the region immediately around Kyoto) the <br/>\n&gt;    assessment in the Sengoku was in kandaka, which is to say in money <br/>\n&gt;    terms rather than rice. I&#39;m still digging into the story of the <br/>\n&gt;    transition to the kokudaka system, which took place under <br/>\n&gt;    Hideyoshi.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;Will Adams, the first<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;Englishman in Japan, in a letter dated 1611 recounted that he and <br/>\n&gt;    his<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;crew were each given an income of &quot;2 pounds of rice a day&quot;, which <br/>\n&gt;    is 2.4<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;koku a year. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    There was a difference between one&#39;s kokudaka and income. The <br/>\n&gt;    kokudaka was the nominal productive capacity of the fief, while the <br/>\n&gt;    tax revenues varied but were usually around 30% to 40% of the <br/>\n&gt;    kokudaka. If you were a low-ranked stipendiary rather than a <br/>\n&gt;    fief-holder your stipend might be reckoned in hyo of 0.35 koku, so <br/>\n&gt;    that a man with a stipend of 100 hyo actually received 35 koku <br/>\n&gt;    (when not required to make a &quot;loan&quot; to his daimyo or shogun). <br/>\n&gt;    Generally, one whose stipend was stated in koku rather than hyo had <br/>\n&gt;    higher status, but got no more. That is, a stipend of 100 koku <br/>\n&gt;    would bring in about the same net income as one of 100 hyo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    According to _Learning from Shogun_, William Adams (he never called <br/>\n&gt;    himself &quot;Will&quot;, noble a name though it be) held a fief with a <br/>\n&gt;    kokudaka of 250 koku, comprising the villiage of Hemimura in what <br/>\n&gt;    is today Yokusuka. This was quite a substantial property and <br/>\n&gt;    implies a certain dignity to his station. Indeed, there is reason <br/>\n&gt;    to believe that he wore the two swords of the samurai, although he <br/>\n&gt;    almost certainly was not regarded as a samurai per se.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income exceeding<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;1,000 koku, <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    No. It is reckoned that the greatest number of shogunal housemen <br/>\n&gt;    had stipends of only 30 to 70 hyo. Needless to say, this meant <br/>\n&gt;    miserable poverty unless one found other ways to augment it. In <br/>\n&gt;    1700 in Okayama han, 93 samurai were recorded as having less than <br/>\n&gt;    10 hyo, and in 1840-44 there were more than 1,000 with less than 20 <br/>\n&gt;    hyo. It was quite impossible to live on less than 10 hyo (3.5 koku <br/>\n&gt;    of rice income) and impossible to do more than merely subsist on <br/>\n&gt;    less than 20 -- all these men had to find some way of supplementing <br/>\n&gt;    their incomes quite substantially. In some rural han, stipends as <br/>\n&gt;    low as 4 hyo equivalent were recorded, although it is thought that <br/>\n&gt;    these were men with only nominal samurai duties who really were <br/>\n&gt;    farmers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    A swordsmith (who was not a samurai, of course) might have 100 hyo, <br/>\n&gt;    and other valued specialist craftsmen often got 50 or more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;while the richest daimyo in the land Tokugawa Ieyasu, the<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;first of the Edo era shogun&#39;s had an income of over 4 million koku <br/>\n&gt;    a<br/>\n&gt;    &gt;year!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    This was Iyasu&#39;s kokudaka, not his income.

One koku was the amount of rice required to<br/>\nfeed one person for one year, and served as a measure of wealth for what<br/>\nwas fundamentally an agricultural society. A koku is a fraction over 180<br/>\nlitres of rice or about 300 pounds in weight. Will Adams, the first<br/>\nEnglishman in Japan, in a letter dated 1611 recounted that he and his<br/>\ncrew were each given an income of &quot;2 pounds of rice a day&quot;, which is 2.4<br/>\nkoku a year. IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income exceeding<br/>\n1,000 koku, while the richest daimyo in the land Tokugawa Ieyasu, the<br/>\nfirst of the Edo era shogun&#39;s had an income of over 4 million koku a<br/>\nyear!.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope the chap who posted has hung around to read this, if so I hope<br/>\nyou find this stuff useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Ladies and Gentlemen, as temporary list moderator,<br/>\n&gt;    I&#39;ve had to reject two messages from a certain<br/>\n&gt;    individual in the past day.

That being said, here&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;    a short answer that hopefully will suffice:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Daimo: &quot;Great Name&quot; a feudal lord of the samurai class<br/>\n&gt;    in pre-Meiji Japan. Daimyo were generally considered<br/>\n&gt;    the pre-eminent ruler in their fief, and controlled<br/>\n&gt;    everything that happened therein. Prior to the<br/>\n&gt;    Tokugawa Shogunate, the Daimyo were essentially<br/>\n&gt;    &quot;warlords&quot; controlling territory by force of arms,<br/>\n&gt;    enlarging it as they could. Subsequently, they held<br/>\n&gt;    their fiefs either by being granted them by the<br/>\n&gt;    Shogunate, or with the Shogunate&#39;s permission,<br/>\n&gt;    anyways. Daimyo had an army of samurai retainers,<br/>\n&gt;    generally speaking, to maintain order in their domains<br/>\n&gt;    and to fight wars when necessary. Once the Tokugawa<br/>\n&gt;    period began, there was a minimum income to be<br/>\n&gt;    considered a &quot;daimyo&quot;--I don&#39;t know off hand what it<br/>\n&gt;    was, but I&#39;m sure you can look it up somewhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    There&#39;s a basic answer. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dean Wayland<br/>\nHead Of The Fight School<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk</a></div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1615410840\">Another possible theory is that Kodachi is only an older (or another)<br/>\nname for the companion sword that changed during the times. Once, the<br/>\ncompanion sword wasn&#39;t regulated by length-rules and it went from<br/>\nsomething like a long Tanto for collecting heads or close combat in full<br/>\narmor (IoroiDoshi) till to short swords, often in hirazukuri style. The<br/>\nworldwide known ShinogiZukuri style Wakizashi as a smaller replica of<br/>\nthe main blade went in fashion later, even if ShinogiZukuri wasn&#39;t an<br/>\nobligation for such blades.<br/>\nSo, a matter of time and names, or how we use the words rather than<br/>\nstyles and length, in my opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Messaggio originale-----<br/>\nandrea Smith wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: Another sword question<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the difference is that the kodachi is a bit longer than a<br/>\nwakizashi, correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mmupton1@...\">Mmupton1@...</a> wrote:What&#39;s the difference between a Kodachi and a<br/>\nWakasashi?<br/>\n-mattyboi</div>",

Historically there were many different <br/>\nkinds of shaku depending on the time period, the thing being <br/>\nmeasured, and the location. There were not large differences (shaku <br/>\nnever means &#39;60 cm&#39; for example).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words - today when a person says &#39;shaku&#39; you can think <br/>\n&#39;about 30 cm&#39;, and probably be safe.
