I can&#39;t say im overly <br/>\nknowledgable in the history of the samurai but i did learn a little <br/>\nbit in a history class i took last year, assuming the information was <br/>\ncorrect.  Does anyone have any good reccomendations for reading <br/>\nmaterial, not only about the cutlure and history, but about the <br/>\naspects and philosphy&#39;s of weilding the sword?  Any information would <br/>\nbe great.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for yoru time.<br/>\n<br/>\nD.K.</div>",
