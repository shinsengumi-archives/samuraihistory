So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how do we really know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which ones are red and which ones aren&#39;t? Does<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; matter?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does it matter if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your apple is red and my tangerine is blue, as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; long as it inspires me? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And certain tangerines may be of such hues of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; orange that they may be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very very close to red.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Simple facts: not everyone can tell that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tangerines are not red. Many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tangerines may be so orange they are close to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being red, but being red<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not the point of a tangerine. For purposes of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this analogy, all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apples SHOULD be red--the fact that many are<br/>\n&gt; green<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or brown is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warning to the partaker that they need to check<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their apples before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they eat them, but not grounds for saying that<br/>\n&gt; a.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all apples are bad,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or b.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all tangerines are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; equally red with apples. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; \t\t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how do we really know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which ones are red and which ones aren&#39;t? Does<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; matter?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does it matter if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your apple is red and my tangerine is blue, as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; long as it inspires me? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And certain tangerines may be of such hues of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; orange that they may be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very very close to red.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Simple facts: not everyone can tell that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tangerines are not red. Many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tangerines may be so orange they are close to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being red, but being red<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not the point of a tangerine. For purposes of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this analogy, all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apples SHOULD be red--the fact that many are<br/>\n&gt; green<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or brown is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warning to the partaker that they need to check<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their apples before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they eat them, but not grounds for saying that<br/>\n&gt; a.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all apples are bad,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or b.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all tangerines are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; equally red with apples. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; \t\t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

It&#39;s what got me started 35 years ago and I&#39;ve never stopped<br/>\nreading and learning since.  I don&#39;t understand the references to<br/>\nHollywood blockbuster type films though - even I, in my condescending<br/>\nand snotty manner, would never deign to imply that they were worthy of<br/>\ninclusion in this discussion......I&#39;m sorry if anyone finds me<br/>\ncondescending, and a little surprised, because to be honest, I&#39;ve been<br/>\nembarrassed at the bad tempered way some posters have been treated<br/>\nwhen they ask a simple (and simplistic) question, or merely try to<br/>\ndrum up a bit of controversy just to get a discussion going.  To those<br/>\npeople I would show infinite patience, because I really, really want<br/>\nmore people to get into the subject that I&#39;ve loved almost all of my<br/>\nlife.  It won&#39;t help them to continue learning about the subject if<br/>\ntheir every mistake is howled at, and it certainly doesn&#39;t encourage<br/>\nme to keep posting if, by not agreeing, I&#39;m seen to be condescending.<br/>\n I think &quot;cut out quotes&quot; as favoured here are part of the problem,<br/>\nthey ignore a long and reasoned argument and make the one snippet<br/>\nquoted sound like an unreasonable shriek.  Speaking of shrieking, I&#39;ve<br/>\nread several people on different forums howling with rage because<br/>\ntheir preferred historical source was not the same as someone else&#39;s.<br/>\n How can they know which is right, and ultimately, does it matter?  In<br/>\nmy clumsy way, that was what I was trying to get at, being dogmatic<br/>\nover a particular version of history to the extent of insulting others<br/>\nwho don&#39;t agree, or prefer an alternative source.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@s...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ned,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that the main point of contention that I would have is that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>history<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; books all have the intended purpose of being correct whereas fiction&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; purpose isn&#39;t to be correct, it is to entertain.

If I were to watch a Zatoichi film and then decide on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the spot<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that there truly existed a blind masseur named Zatoichi who became a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>master<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; swordsman, then I would truly be jumping the gun in this conclusion.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, too many people do this, watch a film, or read a book and<br/>\n&gt; unquestioningly decide that it contains &quot;the truth.&quot; So we occasionally<br/>\n&gt; encounter someone on this list (or elsewhere) who want to know the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;true&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; history of Zatoichi. And we have to gently advise them on looking at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>other<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sources that explain that Zatoichi was purely a fictional character. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But some historical fiction, including some historical films, do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>attempt to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; discuss history and cast a light on it. A lot of it is written purely to<br/>\n&gt; entertain. But not always. Back to a film like SEPPUKU, I doubt that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>anyone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; who has seen this film would say that they were &quot;entertained&quot; by it;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>being<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; entertained was not my own reaction. This film wasn&#39;t designed to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>entertain,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it was designed to present ideas, reflecting upon speculative<br/>\n </span></blockquote>history and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; then attempting to apply it to contemporary times. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now to say after watching SEPPUKU that there definitively existed a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>samurai<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; named Tsugumo Hanshiro and that he avenged the death of his son-in-law<br/>\n&gt; against the Ii clan -- that would be jumping the gun. But to use the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>events<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; presented in a film like this and question as to whether or not similar<br/>\n&gt; events may or may not have happened. And then look for historical<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sources in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this questioning and draw conclusions. That isn&#39;t jumping the gun,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; using a film as a jumping-off point to explore history.      <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now to get on a level of my own experience. When I decided to write<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Stray<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dogs,&quot; a fictional account of the life of one of the 47 Ako ronin, Fuwa<br/>\n&gt; Kazuemon (anyone can read the story on the Samurai Archives web site), I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t write the story to &quot;entertain.&quot; I also did NOT write the story to<br/>\n&gt; state that this is THE FACTS about his life. I couldn&#39;t do that and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; know any historian, even those with multiple degrees in history who<br/>\n </span></blockquote>could.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Simply because so many gaps exist in his life.

I suppose that<br/>\none can say that the writer of a book that is labeled &quot;history&quot; usually<br/>\nbelieves that their main point and their main agenda are both correct. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow many times have you read history books that, for instance, state that<br/>\n&quot;the following IS the story of the 47 Ako ronin&#39;s revenge&quot; and then read a<br/>\ndescription that is full of suppositions, assumptions, unfounded facts.<br/>\nMainly because all of the details simply are not available. I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nmany contrasting and conflicting &quot;historical&quot; accounts of the revenge of the<br/>\n47 ronin that I&#39;ve read in who knows how many history books. Like fiction<br/>\nwriters, historical writers will &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; with suppositions when<br/>\nthe actual empirical evidence doesn&#39;t exist. So to say outright that each<br/>\nand every history book is &quot;to try and be correct&quot; misses the point because<br/>\nthat is not the case with all of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere really isn&#39;t any problem with historical writers doing some &quot;filling<br/>\nin&quot; with suppositions and assumptions when actual sources aren&#39;t available.<br/>\nIf a writer is actually trying to write a correct account, then he/she will<br/>\ntell us that the account that has been written is speculative. What is<br/>\nprobably the best way to tell us about a certain event is to present several<br/>\nversions that could be deducted from what empirical facts are available and<br/>\nthen discuss which version makes the most sense to the writer. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in my experience, most history writers don&#39;t do this. Instead, they<br/>\npresent a single version of an event as THE FACTS. And thus there are about<br/>\n50 or so &quot;factual&quot; versions (at least) in several &quot;history&quot; books of how the<br/>\ndispute between Lord Asano and Lord Kira took place, what caused Lord Asano<br/>\nto draw his sword, what happened afterward, how the 47 Ako retainers who<br/>\nplanned an attack on Kira actually accomplished this, what happened after<br/>\nthe attack, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the other posters mentioned &quot;peer review&quot; as if somehow that makes<br/>\nthe historical work certified in some way as &quot;accurate&quot; and therefore not to<br/>\nbe questioned. Peers can be just as human, have just as many agendas of<br/>\ntheir own to push as the author does. Even those peers with tons of letters<br/>\nand degrees behind their name can have agendas. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to say it, but history isn&#39;t like computer programming or mathematics<br/>\n(my fields of expertise) with clear-cut divisions between &quot;true&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;false.&quot; So we&#39;re going to have several different versions of &quot;the facts&quot;<br/>\nand we&#39;re going to have to learn to use our own heads to read several<br/>\nsources and decide for ourselves. We will each come up with different<br/>\nconclusions and therefore, we can have lists like this one to exchange<br/>\nideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we get to film and other works clearly labeled as &quot;fiction&quot; and &quot;novels.&quot;<br/>\nTo say that the purpose of ALL fiction writers is only to &quot;entertain&quot;, that<br/>\nalso misses the point. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome films, mainly most anime or ZATOICHI or similar films were made mainly<br/>\nto entertain. If I were to watch a Zatoichi film and then decide on the spot<br/>\nthat there truly existed a blind masseur named Zatoichi who became a master<br/>\nswordsman, then I would truly be jumping the gun in this conclusion.<br/>\nUnfortunately, too many people do this, watch a film, or read a book and<br/>\nunquestioningly decide that it contains &quot;the truth.&quot; So we occasionally<br/>\nencounter someone on this list (or elsewhere) who want to know the &quot;true&quot;<br/>\nhistory of Zatoichi. And we have to gently advise them on looking at other<br/>\nsources that explain that Zatoichi was purely a fictional character. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut some historical fiction, including some historical films, do attempt to<br/>\ndiscuss history and cast a light on it. A lot of it is written purely to<br/>\nentertain. But not always. Back to a film like SEPPUKU, I doubt that anyone<br/>\nwho has seen this film would say that they were &quot;entertained&quot; by it; being<br/>\nentertained was not my own reaction. This film wasn&#39;t designed to entertain,<br/>\nit was designed to present ideas, reflecting upon speculative history and<br/>\nthen attempting to apply it to contemporary times. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow to say after watching SEPPUKU that there definitively existed a samurai<br/>\nnamed Tsugumo Hanshiro and that he avenged the death of his son-in-law<br/>\nagainst the Ii clan -- that would be jumping the gun. But to use the events<br/>\npresented in a film like this and question as to whether or not similar<br/>\nevents may or may not have happened. And then look for historical sources in<br/>\nthis questioning and draw conclusions. That isn&#39;t jumping the gun, that is<br/>\nusing a film as a jumping-off point to explore history.      <br/>\n<br/>\nNow to get on a level of my own experience. When I decided to write &quot;Stray<br/>\nDogs,&quot; a fictional account of the life of one of the 47 Ako ronin, Fuwa<br/>\nKazuemon (anyone can read the story on the Samurai Archives web site), I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t write the story to &quot;entertain.&quot; I also did NOT write the story to<br/>\nstate that this is THE FACTS about his life. I couldn&#39;t do that and I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow any historian, even those with multiple degrees in history who could.<br/>\nSimply because so many gaps exist in his life. I wrote the story because I<br/>\nam interested in this man&#39;s life and thus wanted to delve into it a bit<br/>\nmore. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a bit long-winded here and I apologize if I bored anyone. But it&#39;s<br/>\ndifficult to do that &quot;surgeon&#39;s scalpal&quot; thing and I don&#39;t always accomplish<br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Nina<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 19, 2005 7:34 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1286872080\">I&#39;m not quite sure what point you are making, so please excuse me if my<br/>\nreply is rather scatter-shot. From what I can see, you were questioning the<br/>\nusefulness of citing two films, AFTER THE RAIN and SEPPUKU as possible<br/>\nhistorical sources for dealing with the lives and conditions of Edo-period<br/>\nronin and also the Edo period ethic of &quot;the sword is the soul of the<br/>\nsamurai.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your information: I cannot read in Japanese so my written sources are in<br/>\nEnglish or in English translation. <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing fiction and film as historical sources: You are correct in that they<br/>\nare films and not the same as historical documents. But many times<br/>\nhistorical documents from the time period do not exist. As for the two films<br/>\nI cited, they concern the life of Edo-period ronin. There are hardly any<br/>\nhistorical sources that outline the lives of Edo period ronin. So therefore,<br/>\nhistorians have usually had to read what little is available and draw<br/>\nconclusions from little bits of information that they have found, here and<br/>\nthere. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne historical source I did find was in SOURCES OF JAPANESE TRADITION, which<br/>\nis a compilation of historical sources in English translation. Included in<br/>\nthis book are some writings of Fumazawa Banzin, a ronin and scholar who<br/>\nlived in the 17th century. He wrote about the conditions of people during<br/>\nthe Edo period and particularly discussed the conditions for the ronin, many<br/>\nwhom he said were starving to death. There are loads of other historical<br/>\ndocuments in this book on various topics. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother source of historical writings is LEGENDS OF THE SAMURAI compiled by<br/>\nHiroaki Sato. He compiled English translations of many original documents,<br/>\nincluding the 18th century scholarly debates that occurred concerning the 47<br/>\nAko ronin and their revenge.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for using films and other historical fiction: You cannot draw definitive<br/>\nconclusions from anything seen in a film or a piece of fiction. For the most<br/>\npart, films and other fiction aren&#39;t designed to give out definitive<br/>\nconclusions about history. What they do is &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; in many cases,<br/>\nand they raise issues and possibilities. The films SEPPUKU and AFTER THE<br/>\nRAIN are made by Japanese, in Japanese. I have to use sub-titled versions as<br/>\nmy understanding of Japanese is quite limited. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo therefore as an example: in SEPPUKU, the author of the orignal novel, and<br/>\nthe director of the film, challenge the concept of &quot;the sword is the soul of<br/>\nthe samurai&quot; as a precept that has been frequently empty of any true<br/>\nmorality, as a hypocritical &quot;hammer&quot; used by those in positions of privilege<br/>\nduring the Edo period, over those who are powerless. In the novel and the<br/>\nfilm, there is a depiction of an impoverished 17th century ronin forced by<br/>\nthe Ii clan to commit seppuku with his bamboo-blade wakizashi (because he<br/>\nhad pawned his real blade, replacing it with bamboo) after he came to their<br/>\nmansion begging for money. So this does raise a question: did this sort of<br/>\nevent ever actually happen in historical times, or is this event purely from<br/>\nthe imagination of the author, echoed by the movie director? On an ethical<br/>\nlevel, would this response by the Ii clan, be considered by those living in<br/>\nthe time, as an apropriate response? In modern times, would this be<br/>\nconsidered an appropriate response? There are no proven answers, just<br/>\nspeculations. But they can be valuable to ponder, at least to some.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr we could dismiss this whole thing, stating that it&#39;s from a novel and a<br/>\nfilm, and say that it&#39;s just fiction, unproven. And move on, using only<br/>\ndefinitive historical documents in their original language for the study of<br/>\nhistory. Which is fine as well.

Written when?  In Japanese<br/>\nor English?  For a popular or academic audience?  Peer reviewed (as in<br/>\nuniversity and other scholarly presses)?<br/>\nAll of these (and many more) are the first questions one normally would ask<br/>\nabout sources quoted in support of any statement or hypothesis.  Without<br/>\nsome idea of the sources that you are using, a statement such as &#39;some<br/>\nhistorical accounts I&#39;ve read&#39; has an indeterminate authority and leaves me<br/>\n(and I suspect others) curious as to the accuracy that we can expect from<br/>\nthe sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next thing that I would point out is that these are just movies. <br/>\nWhile I like Kurosawa and Tokugawa-set period pieces, I don&#39;t beleive anyone<br/>\nwould put much faith in their historical accuracy.  That is not to say that<br/>\nthe things that movies depict are necessarily untrue, but simply that they<br/>\ncan&#39;t be relied upon as historical documents in the same way that<br/>\ncontemporaneous materials can.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; [snips] <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
