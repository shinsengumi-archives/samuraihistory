            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1931614925\">A late note on this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs i understand it, a samurai&#39;s status is determined by his place in<br/>\nthe social hierarchy, so that in the case of two samurai of equal<br/>\nstatus, a priority would be determined if the master of one was of a<br/>\nsuperior status than the master of the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nA samurai without employ is then &#39;cast adrift&#39; in society, hence the<br/>\nterm ronin, he has no place at all, the only way is down. He becomes a<br/>\nsocial pariah, is mistrusted and disliked, and someone turning up,<br/>\noffering to fight for money, can only mean one thing ... trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet alone the insult of assuming that a samurai would fight for<br/>\nsomething like ... money?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the added social stigma of losing to such a man. How can a<br/>\nsamurai hold his head high when he&#39;s been beaten by a beggar?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, swordsmen of renown (or independent means) might<br/>\nengage in a musa shugyo (musha shugyo?) which I have seen translated<br/>\nas &#39;warrior pilgrimage&#39;; &#39;dojo tour&#39; and &#39;warrior way&#39; (&#39;michi&#39;, as<br/>\nopposed to &#39;do&#39;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is recorded of Bokuden, for example, that he travelled in style, a<br/>\ncaravan of some 60-odd in attendance, the equivalent of a daimyo<br/>\nprocession. Nobutsuna Kamiizumi did the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn either case, the chance to engage in a friendly match with a master<br/>\ncan do one&#39;s reputation no harm, and there is always something to<br/>\nlearn. Both men would have been welcomed, even if technically &#39;ronin&#39;,<br/>\ntheir reputations had won them social status.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",

I also never<br/>\nheard that he has trained samurai swordsmanship exclusively other than those<br/>\nincluded in his aikido mokuroku (or i may be wrong?).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this one is also good if you really like watching samurai movies:<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai Resurrection:<br/>\nThis is the story of a Christian martyr who is killed when the uprising he<br/>\nis leading is put down. Vowing vengeance he returns from the dead and with<br/>\nthe help of other unhappy souls he tries to destroy the shogun responsible<br/>\nfor his death. Opposing him is swordsman Jubei, who has to fight his way<br/>\nthrough the undead minions in order to stop the plot to bring chaos to the<br/>\nworld. (The Jubei character was a real person and shows up in other Japanese<br/>\ntales) This is the second version of a historically based supernatural<br/>\nnovel. The earlier film starred Sonny Chiba and was an action packed film<br/>\nthat made very little sense but was fun to watch. Here we have a nice blend<br/>\nof action and plot, then again maybe its too much plot. While this is an<br/>\nexcellent action film, though the larger implications of who some of the<br/>\ncharacters really are was lost on me since I&#39;m not as well versed in<br/>\nJapanese history. This is a film that assumes you know the period that the<br/>\nfilm takes place since it brings many real people and places into play. Who<br/>\never put the DVD I saw together must have been aware of the need to be<br/>\ninformed on Japanese history and customs so they included, as part of the<br/>\nsubtitled track, helpful tidbits about terms and people and places. It helps<br/>\nin the short term but by half way into the film I was feeling a bit lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill this is a very good movie. The action is spectacular, the opening<br/>\ncastle assault is amazing, and the horror is scary, how the dead come back<br/>\nwill probably creep you out. This is a well thought out and well made<br/>\nsupernatural action film. I recommend it, with the understanding that you<br/>\nmay feel a bit lost (Though that&#39;s not a reason to pass this by since it is<br/>\na good film)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTotok Sudarijanto<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai.or.id\">http://www.samurai.or.id</a><br/>\nemail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:totok.sudarijanto@...\">totok.sudarijanto@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The ultimate aim of the martial arts is not having to use them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYAHOO!

I also never<br/>\nheard that he has trained samurai swordsmanship exclusively other than those<br/>\nincluded in his aikido mokuroku (or i may be wrong?).<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, this one is also good if you really like watching samurai movies:<br/>\n <br/>\nSamurai Resurrection:<br/>\nThis is the story of a Christian martyr who is killed when the uprising he<br/>\nis leading is put down. Vowing vengeance he returns from the dead and with<br/>\nthe help of other unhappy souls he tries to destroy the shogun responsible<br/>\nfor his death. Opposing him is swordsman Jubei, who has to fight his way<br/>\nthrough the undead minions in order to stop the plot to bring chaos to the<br/>\nworld. (The Jubei character was a real person and shows up in other Japanese<br/>\ntales) This is the second version of a historically based supernatural<br/>\nnovel. The earlier film starred Sonny Chiba and was an action packed film<br/>\nthat made very little sense but was fun to watch. Here we have a nice blend<br/>\nof action and plot, then again maybe its too much plot. While this is an<br/>\nexcellent action film, though the larger implications of who some of the<br/>\ncharacters really are was lost on me since I&#39;m not as well versed in<br/>\nJapanese history. This is a film that assumes you know the period that the<br/>\nfilm takes place since it brings many real people and places into play. Who<br/>\never put the DVD I saw together must have been aware of the need to be<br/>\ninformed on Japanese history and customs so they included, as part of the<br/>\nsubtitled track, helpful tidbits about terms and people and places. It helps<br/>\nin the short term but by half way into the film I was feeling a bit lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill this is a very good movie. The action is spectacular, the opening<br/>\ncastle assault is amazing, and the horror is scary, how the dead come back<br/>\nwill probably creep you out. This is a well thought out and well made<br/>\nsupernatural action film. I recommend it, with the understanding that you<br/>\nmay feel a bit lost (Though that&#39;s not a reason to pass this by since it is<br/>\na good film)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nTotok Sudarijanto<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai.or.id\">http://www.samurai.or.id</a><br/>\nemail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:totok.sudarijanto@...\">totok.sudarijanto@...</a><br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The ultimate aim of the martial arts is not having to use them.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

How true is this?<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  Thanks again.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is a film, quite good. It&#39;s called AFTER THE<br/>\nRAIN, which deals with <br/>\nthis subject. I forget the director but it&#39;s not<br/>\nreally a sword-slashing <br/>\n&quot;chambara film,&quot; it&#39;s a thoughtful film about what<br/>\nkenjutsu/kendo actually is. It&#39;s <br/>\navailable fairly widely with English subtitles. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe plot of AFTER THE RAIN basically involves a ronin<br/>\nand his wife who are <br/>\ntraveling as he is looking for work. It turns out that<br/>\nhe had made some income <br/>\nin the past by engaging in &quot;prize fighting&quot; also known<br/>\nas &quot;dojo crashing.&quot; <br/>\nThough you will see in watching the film that this<br/>\nronin had a different approach <br/>\nrather than the usual brash, outrageous sort of<br/>\napproach because this man is <br/>\nquite self-effacing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, the local daimyo finds out about this man<br/>\nand offers him an <br/>\ninterview for an open position he has in his clan of<br/>\nbeing a kendo instructor for <br/>\nthe clan. The ronin comes for the interview and in the<br/>\nprocess, the daimyo <br/>\nfinds out that he had engaged in &quot;prize fighting&quot; in<br/>\nthe past and decides not to <br/>\ntake him into the clan. So yes, &quot;prize fighting&quot; was<br/>\nconsidered a dishonor. <br/>\nThe film goes on, and I&#39;ll let people watch it to find<br/>\nout what eventually <br/>\nhappens. <br/>\n<br/>\nI gather from this that &quot;prize fighting&quot; was<br/>\nconsidered a dishonor in the <br/>\nsame way that offering your sword services for hire<br/>\nwas considered a dishonor. <br/>\nThe samurai was supposed to offer his sword skills<br/>\nfreely, without consideration <br/>\nfor monetary gain, in service to his lord. That was<br/>\nthe ethic of the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this ethic didn&#39;t provide for any ronin who<br/>\nhad lost his lord or <br/>\nelse had been dismissed by his lord from his position<br/>\n-- how are they supposed <br/>\nto survive?  But then it was usually considered a<br/>\ndishonor to have become a <br/>\nronin, without a lord.  So there really weren&#39;t<br/>\nprovisions made for them in <br/>\nfeudal society,  particularly Tokugawa-era society.<br/>\nThe ronin just had to somehow <br/>\ncarry on the best as they could. So frequently,<br/>\ndespite the stigma, they were <br/>\nforced to offer up their sword skills for money or<br/>\nelse engage in &quot;prize <br/>\nfighting.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Sengoku era, many samurai lost their lords.<br/>\nSome of them were able <br/>\nto get positions within other clans because there were<br/>\nmany battles and a <br/>\ngood swordsman, even one without a lord, would be<br/>\nwelcomed into a clan, where he <br/>\ncould acquire a new lord to serve as a samurai. With<br/>\nthe advent of the <br/>\nTokugawa period, there were far fewer opportunities,<br/>\nalmost none, to acquire a new <br/>\nposition with a new clan once a samurai had lost his<br/>\nlord.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps a bit.  Nina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHI<br/>\n<br/>\nthe sworsmanship in the this movie was choreographed<br/>\nby Otake sensei the shihanke of the Katori Shinto Ryu<br/>\nwhich is famous for its swordsmanship<br/>\n<br/>\npaul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

How true is this?<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  Thanks again.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is a film, quite good. It&#39;s called AFTER THE RAIN, which deals with <br/>\nthis subject. I forget the director but it&#39;s not really a sword-slashing <br/>\n&quot;chambara film,&quot; it&#39;s a thoughtful film about what kenjutsu/kendo actually is. It&#39;s <br/>\navailable fairly widely with English subtitles. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe plot of AFTER THE RAIN basically involves a ronin and his wife who are <br/>\ntraveling as he is looking for work. It turns out that he had made some income <br/>\nin the past by engaging in &quot;prize fighting&quot; also known as &quot;dojo crashing.&quot; <br/>\nThough you will see in watching the film that this ronin had a different approach <br/>\nrather than the usual brash, outrageous sort of approach because this man is <br/>\nquite self-effacing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, the local daimyo finds out about this man and offers him an <br/>\ninterview for an open position he has in his clan of being a kendo instructor for <br/>\nthe clan. The ronin comes for the interview and in the process, the daimyo <br/>\nfinds out that he had engaged in &quot;prize fighting&quot; in the past and decides not to <br/>\ntake him into the clan. So yes, &quot;prize fighting&quot; was considered a dishonor. <br/>\nThe film goes on, and I&#39;ll let people watch it to find out what eventually <br/>\nhappens. <br/>\n<br/>\nI gather from this that &quot;prize fighting&quot; was considered a dishonor in the <br/>\nsame way that offering your sword services for hire was considered a dishonor. <br/>\nThe samurai was supposed to offer his sword skills freely, without consideration <br/>\nfor monetary gain, in service to his lord. That was the ethic of the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this ethic didn&#39;t provide for any ronin who had lost his lord or <br/>\nelse had been dismissed by his lord from his position -- how are they supposed <br/>\nto survive?  But then it was usually considered a dishonor to have become a <br/>\nronin, without a lord.  So there really weren&#39;t provisions made for them in <br/>\nfeudal society,  particularly Tokugawa-era society. The ronin just had to somehow <br/>\ncarry on the best as they could. So frequently, despite the stigma, they were <br/>\nforced to offer up their sword skills for money or else engage in &quot;prize <br/>\nfighting.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Sengoku era, many samurai lost their lords. Some of them were able <br/>\nto get positions within other clans because there were many battles and a <br/>\ngood swordsman, even one without a lord, would be welcomed into a clan, where he <br/>\ncould acquire a new lord to serve as a samurai. With the advent of the <br/>\nTokugawa period, there were far fewer opportunities, almost none, to acquire a new <br/>\nposition with a new clan once a samurai had lost his lord.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps a bit.

Katsumoto is a stand-in for Saigo Takamori,<br/>\nthe real historical person, who has been described as &quot;the last true<br/>\nsamurai&quot;. The film is nothing like the history. Likewise, no American<br/>\nsamurai either. This was just a viewpoint character to enable westerners<br/>\nto glimpse Japanese culture, or at least Hollywood&#39;s version of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, see this short piece on Saigo Takamori:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jref.com/glossary/saigo_takamori.shtml\">http://www.jref.com/glossary/saigo_takamori.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for more info on the samurai in general go to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/index.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n***<br/>\nDean Wayland<br/>\nHead Of The Fight School<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk</a></div>",
