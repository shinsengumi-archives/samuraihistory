If you are<br/>\nhaving him interact with non-Japanese characters for<br/>\nthe most part, then I can see them giving him an<br/>\n&quot;English&quot; nickname, like the example you use above.<br/>\n(Being as &quot;Tad&quot; is unpronounceable by a Japanese, it&#39;s<br/>\nnot likely to stick--it would come out &quot;Tada&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;Taddo&quot;. I&#39;m not familiar with &#39;Tadaka&#39; as a given<br/>\nname either, but I suppose it could be one...maybe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more Japanese given names ARE short<br/>\nenough--hard to shorten &quot;Shinya&quot; or &quot;Jun&quot;, though<br/>\n&quot;Jun&quot; could itself be short for &quot;Junpei&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;Junichirou&quot;, or 1000 other names. You could take<br/>\n&quot;Daisuke&quot; and make it &quot;Dice&quot; (kinda cool), or<br/>\nRyuutarou and make it &quot;Ryu&quot;, or something like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nand I would like the surname to be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; connected to any<br/>\n&gt; well-known samurai family or clan in Japanese<br/>\n&gt; history, preferably<br/>\n&gt; someone heroic. Ideally in the Shimazu family, but<br/>\n&gt; not necessarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the Shimazu family? Then you&#39;ve got your<br/>\nname--Shimazu. If you mean connect ed to the Shimazu<br/>\nfamily, I&#39;m sure someone here can dig up the names of<br/>\na few of their retainer families. Something that<br/>\nrecognizable would be a little odd, but not unheard<br/>\nof, and that may be the effect you are going for. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do not read or speak Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Happy to help--but I&#39;m not going to just throw random<br/>\nnames out there without getting a better idea of what<br/>\nyou are looking for. I don&#39;t know whether the others<br/>\nwho&#39;ve chimed in (sans Kitsuno, who I know speaks<br/>\nJapanese) have any knowledge or background, but for<br/>\nmyself, I live in Japan, speak Japanese, watch way too<br/>\nmuch TV, and generally am surrounded by Japanese names<br/>\nall the time. Let me know if your time period is<br/>\nmodern or historical, what meanings you&#39;re hoping to<br/>\ninclude (you did in the email, so I can go with those<br/>\nif nothing else) and clarify the &quot;nickname&quot; thing, and<br/>\nwe should be able to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
