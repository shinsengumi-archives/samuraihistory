            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1944607507\">I do not mean to intrude on this topic but am new to the <br/>\ngroup.  First, I understand that the Japanese matchlock is refered <br/>\nto as a Teppo.  However, matchlocks don&#39;t have brand names or <br/>\nmakers.  There manufacturing predates mass production.  It should <br/>\nalso be noted that they are of Tanegashima pattern.  Matchlocks are <br/>\nknown by pattern names.  English pattern or French pattern, this is <br/>\njust how they are named and identified.  <br/>\n<br/>\n     The main reason I wanted to post, however, is the reason that <br/>\nmakes a Tanegashima pattern so interesting.  There was a very small <br/>\nbut at the same time big change that people seem to miss.  These <br/>\nmatchlocks were the first in which the serpentine fell forward.  <br/>\nThis was a big improvement.  Older matchlocks the serpentine fell <br/>\ntowards the shooter, this could result in some serious problems.  <br/>\nBurns, blindness, etc. were not uncommon results from this setup.  <br/>\nAs of now, since all firearms have a hammer that falls forward in <br/>\nthe direction of the muzzle, these should be noted as the genesis of <br/>\nvirtually all modern firearms design.  Also, they have very fine <br/>\nlines and are nice to shoot.  Reproductions, to be exact, are what I <br/>\nhave fired.  I&#39;m not a matchlock fan but if I was going to have one <br/>\nit would be of Tanegashima pattern.  <br/>\n<br/>\n     Furthermore, I think there was someone who posted about Chinese <br/>\nweapons.  It was not until Europeans came that they showed Asian <br/>\ncultures, that if you harnessed the power of gunpowder you could <br/>\nmake nasty weapons.  Also, it should be noted that Japanese guns are <br/>\nof comparable quality to European guns of this period.  Most others <br/>\nfrom Asia were considered of poor quality or overly ornate, not <br/>\nconsidered worth general use.  <br/>\n<br/>\n     Anyway, I&#39;m a firearms guy.  The gun is such a curious and <br/>\nelusive thing especially in these early days.  I thought I should <br/>\nadd, I believe someone earlier in this thread mentioned cannons, <br/>\nthat they were first produced by bell makers.  Fun little trivial <br/>\nfact, I always found that one a good surprise for those who don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand the reason why.</div>",

The Japanese may have had  <br/>\nsome basic knowledge of explosive weapons before the Portuguese  <br/>\narrived, but the introduction of European firearms marked the  <br/>\nbeginning of widespread use of such weapons.<br/>\nPortuguese harquebuses greatly impressed the daimyo Tanegashima  <br/>\nTokitaka, who ordered his craftsmen to duplicate them. Many Japanese  <br/>\nwarlords hastened to master the techniques for producing them. As  <br/>\nearly as 1549 Oda Nobunaga bought 500 matchlocks from gunsmiths in  <br/>\nKunitomo in Omi (now Shiga Prefecture) and established a firearms  <br/>\nbrigade in his army. In the 1550s Takeda Shingen, lord of the  <br/>\nprovince of Kai (now Yamanashi Prefecture), also organized a firearms  <br/>\nunit.<br/>\nBy the late 16th century firearms (teppo) had become the most  <br/>\nimportant offensive weapon; perhaps a third of the daimyo armies of  <br/>\nthe 1570s carried guns. Oda Nobunaga used his firearms units to  <br/>\nadvantage in the Battle of Anegawa in 1570 and in the Battle of  <br/>\nNagashino in 1575. Toyotomi Hideyoshi also supplied his troops with  <br/>\nfirearms, which he used during his campaigns against the Shimazu  <br/>\nfamily of Kyushu in 1586 and against the Later Hojo family in the  <br/>\nOdawara Campaign in 1590.<br/>\nThe spread of firearms helped to stimulate industrial and commercial  <br/>\nactivities by creating an increased demand for muskets, ammunition,  <br/>\nand other matériel. Also, the popularization of firearms, together  <br/>\nwith the establishment of an armed infantry, largely recruited from  <br/>\nthe peasantry, promoted social mobility.
