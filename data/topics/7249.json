            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-186206384\">Soulfully engaging  <br/>\nKyoto is a city of contrasts. People in bullet trains busy with <br/>\ngizmos, arriving at centuries-old temples and queueing up for <br/>\nwisdom. And, there is no off season <br/>\n  <br/>\nNEELAM MATHEWS <br/>\nPosted online: Sunday, June 19, 2005 at 0000 hours IST <br/>\n<br/>\nNobody visiting Japan for the first time can deny it is different <br/>\nfrom any other travel experience. To start with, it is difficult to <br/>\nreconcile with the extremes - here are the world&#39;s most progressive <br/>\npeople with every gadget possible from different temperatures for <br/>\ntoilet seats to radical designers, juxtaposed into family life and <br/>\ncustoms four centuries old. <br/>\n<br/>\nNature to the Japanese is a close companion; affable and calming <br/>\nrather than grandiose and detached. And nowhere is this more <br/>\napparent than in Kyoto, that Edmund Blunden called the &quot;temple of <br/>\nall the earth&#39;s towns,&quot; a part of the global lexicon, thanks to the <br/>\nKyoto Protocol signed in 1997. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s so little known about the other Kyoto that Jan Morris <br/>\ndescribes, &quot;remains to the Japanese something special... the supreme <br/>\nrepository of their ancient traditions, their religion, and their <br/>\nhigh-flown patriotism, their golden heritage and their resilient <br/>\npride.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nTake Kyo-kaori (meaning Kyoto fragrance or flavor), a bottled iced <br/>\ntea with powdered matcha tea from Kyoto, concealed in a clever <br/>\ndouble cap. The bottle contains only water, but when you unscrew the <br/>\ntop cap, it releases the powdered tea from the green tube into the <br/>\nwater as you taste the flavours of Kyoto from an odd-coloured green <br/>\nbottle! <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a more conventional experience, Kyoto&#39;s sights and sounds can <br/>\nbest be explored by foot. Its mass of cool green garden moss, an oft <br/>\nresounding echo of a temple bell, the inimitable aroma of soy, sugar <br/>\nand sake, and the sensual caress of silk, can all be taken in on a <br/>\nday&#39;s walk. An over 1200-year-old city, this is a city of 1,600 <br/>\ntemples and 400 shrines and palaces and gardens. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing Kyoto does not have is an off season. In spring and <br/>\nautumn, the Japanese flock to see the famed cherry blossoms in <br/>\nMaruyama Park and the maple leaves in the western hills of <br/>\nArashiyama. In summer, the city is ablaze with colour, with the <br/>\ngilded, ornate floats of the July 17 Gion Matsuri, then with the <br/>\nDaimonji, when a gargantuan bonfire paints the character &quot;dai,&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;big,&quot; against the eastern mountain slope. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s so much of India in Kyoto&#39;s temples with numerous <br/>\nmanifestations of Buddha. The ten or tembu, originally Indian deva, <br/>\nHindu deities, were incorporated into the Buddhist faith and became <br/>\nits protectors, have their imposing images often flanking temple <br/>\nentrances. The smell of delicate incense in everywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nA popular attraction is the 14th century, Kinkakuii, completely <br/>\ncovered in gold leaf, earning it the name Golden Pavilion. Here in <br/>\n1984, explains the guide, water from the holy Ganges was brought and <br/>\nstored. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile at the world heritage site, Nijo Castle, the finely <br/>\nwrought parquet floors of the outer rooms squeak loudly when trod <br/>\nupon, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the song of the nightingale. <br/>\nNo mere structural quirk, the squeaks were designed into the floor <br/>\nas a warning system for the shogun, Tokugawa Iyeyasu, who built the <br/>\ncastle in 1603 and lived there in continual fear of would-be <br/>\nassassins, despite the stone walls and moats that surrounded it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the &#39;Pure water temple&#39;, Kiyomizudera, associated with Nara <br/>\nBuddhism, the oldest sect in Japan, visitors can choose from three <br/>\nstreams that guarantee you one of the three - health, wealth or <br/>\nwisdom. Interestingly, one sees long queues of Japanese students <br/>\nopting for the wisdom spring - a direct connotation of their <br/>\ncultural upbringing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe approach to the temple along Kiyomizu-michi or Gojo-zaka is <br/>\nsteep and narrow, the streets lined with stores specialising in <br/>\nlocal sweets and souvenirs including fans, teapots and ceramic frogs <br/>\nthat promise to bring prosperity. From the terrace of the temple, is <br/>\nbeautiful view of the wooded hills of eastern Kyoto. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere, walking among the Zen gardens that try to convince belief in <br/>\nemptiness, actually allows the mind to stop. Be it a solitary stone <br/>\nin a rock garden or a stray red maple leaf just fallen on carefully <br/>\nraked sand, everything seems to have it&#39;s carefully designated <br/>\nplace. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t long before one finds oneself back into the humdrum of <br/>\ndaily life in Kyoto station, catching the bullet train to Nagoya. In <br/>\nall this madness, strange how one has caught up perhaps for the <br/>\nfirst time, with the fullness of life in all its forms.</div>",
