The reason for<br/>\nthis was the disbanding of many defeated clans after<br/>\nthe Battle of Sekigahara (1600) by the victorious<br/>\nTokugawa Shogunate. These Ronin would figure<br/>\nprominantly in the Osaka Campaigns of 1614-1615 on the<br/>\nToyotomi side and during the Shimabara Rebelion of<br/>\n1637-1638 on the rebel side. These Ronin took any<br/>\nchance to strike back at the those who made them Ronin<br/>\nnamely the Shogunate and their Hatamoto. The Ronin are<br/>\noften depicted as the champion of the peasant and as a<br/>\ndangerious man during the Tokugawa Period. Many of<br/>\nthese Ronin also found service in the Tozama<br/>\nClans(outside clans) such as the Shimazu and Nabeshima<br/>\nClans.<br/>\n<br/>\nRonin Samurai also figured prominantly during the<br/>\nMeiji Restoration and the downfall of the Shogunate in<br/>\n1867-1868.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I helped ya.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake<br/>\n--- Erik Larson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skippyefa@...\">skippyefa@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What exactly are the Ronin?
