The music and cinematography are<br/>\ngreat, and you&#39;ll enjoy <br/>\nthe performances by Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka)... and<br/>\nCruise (as Nathan <br/>\nAlgren) ain&#39;t half bad, either. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou actually won&#39;t know most of the cast unless you&#39;re really into Asian<br/>\ntheatre. Good actors, <br/>\nbut, of course, since it&#39;s set in Japan, not a lot of American actors in<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it based on a true story? Well...sort of. The movie IS historical<br/>\nfiction, so a little history, a <br/>\nlittle (a lot) of fiction. Don&#39;t expect it to be completely true to the<br/>\nactual Satsuma Rebellion <br/>\ntimeline and history. Plus you&#39;ve got a few oddities in there, like the<br/>\nNinja attack, shuriken <br/>\na-flying and all...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut basically it gives a nice romantic portrayal of Saigo Takamori<br/>\n(Katsumoto), through the <br/>\neyes of the western observer, Nathan Algren. Action abounds, romance is<br/>\nsubtle, and <br/>\nemotional contact is good. It&#39;s a bit melodramatic at points (like<br/>\nBraveheart and The Patriot) <br/>\nbut not intolerably so. What to expect? Think &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; reset<br/>\nin 19th century <br/>\nJapan. If you liked &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot;, you&#39;ll love<br/>\n&quot;The Last Samurai&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBest scene: Partway through the movie, Katsumoto is with Algren in a<br/>\ntemple courtyard, <br/>\nsurrounded by blossoming cherry trees. And he tells Algren, &quot;One may<br/>\nsearch his entire life <br/>\nfor the perfect blossom, and he will not find it. But if he did find it,<br/>\nit would not be time wasted.&quot; <br/>\nSo then, towards the end of the movie, when Katsumoto lies dying, and<br/>\nhis army has fallen, he <br/>\nsees the wind blow through a blossoming cherry tree, and sweep all the<br/>\nblossoms away... he <br/>\nsees it and says, in his dying breath... &quot;Perfect&quot; - speaking not so<br/>\nmuch of the cherry <br/>\nblossoms as his samurai warriors. His army of samurai, like the bough of<br/>\ncherry blossoms, fell <br/>\nin their beautiful prime... a samurai&#39;s glory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll give it **** <br/>\nDo I want to see it again? &quot;Hai.&quot;<br/>\nSo grab a popcorn, a coke, a date, and a ticket (and don&#39;t forget your<br/>\nwakizashes) and have a <br/>\ngood time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n---<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
