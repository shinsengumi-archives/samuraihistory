Of those I think I liked<br/>\nTokugawa<br/>\n&gt; Yoshinobu the best. I found something a bit tragic in this last Shogun who<br/>\n&gt; had all the capabilities to lead but got trapped by  events that no one<br/>\n&gt; could control. I thought the openings credits with its moody music and<br/>\n&gt; photos really set the tone. It was truly and age of  great opportunity.<br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; story itself was a bit soapy at times and some characters notably the<br/>\n&gt; fireman&#39;s family seemed unneeded but I guess that&#39;s the demands of<br/>\nprimetime<br/>\n&gt; TV. Yes I liked Hideyoshi  too because of Takenaka Naito and Sawaguchi<br/>\n&gt; Yasuko. Aoi was good up until Sekigahara than really fell flat. The worst<br/>\n&gt; one I saw was the condensed version of 1973&#39;s Kunitori Monogatari. I guess<br/>\n&gt; it hurts to squeeze a 50 episode story into 3 hours. One look at 1966&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Minamoto Yoshitsune shows how far TV technology has come<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the way Nobunaga was 1992 and Yoshinobu was 1998, Genroku Ryoran was<br/>\n&gt; 1999. If you&#39;d like a complete list of the taiga dramas I&#39;ll send you<br/>\none..<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Christopher West &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kitsuno@...\">kitsuno@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 07, 2001 5:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] NHK Taiga Drama<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since quite a few people on the list have apparently seen a few Taiga<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drama, let&#39;s throw out a poll:  What is your favorite Taiga drama,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and more importantly, why?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll start of by saying that i&#39;ve seen (and i&#39;m estimating the years)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1996&#39;s Hideyoshi, the Nobunaga drama sometime prior to that, 1997&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mori Motonari, 1999&#39;s Tokugawa Yoshinobu, and the first 5 episodes of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aoi ~ Tokugawa Sandai.  I&#39;d have to say that out of those, Mori<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Motonari was my favorite - most of it was pretty new to me, and for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the most part it had some excellent acting, but above all else, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makeup surpasses all the previous drama.  I think they must have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; added a little grey or a few wrinkles each episode, making the aging<br/>\n&gt; &gt; look so natural.  After it was over, and i went back and watched the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first few episodes again, i was surprised at how young everyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looked.  Apparently it was more or less a bomb in Japan, but one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my favorites.  Hideyoshi would come up #2 for the entertainment value<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alone - Takenaka Naoto is one of my favorite Japanese actors.  I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also impressed by Sekigahara at the begining of Tokugawa Sandai,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; although apparently others weren&#39;t as impressed as I was...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; CEWest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
