Many samurais, especially those of lower ranks, began to <br/>\ndoubt the power of the Shogunate in defending the country against <br/>\nforeign powers, especially when they had seen the armed blackships. <br/>\nThe slogan &quot;Sonno-Joi&quot; (Rever the emperor, dispel the barbarians) <br/>\nwas winning more and more support, such that samurais desert their <br/>\nhans to come to Kyoto to join the revolutionary movements. (In those <br/>\ndays deserting your han can be one of the most condemned sins - once <br/>\nyou desert, you can never return to it, on pain of death.) <br/>\n<br/>\nSuch roshis (masterless samurais, but not ronins and definitely not <br/>\nrurounis) increased in Kyoto, causing more and more disturbances at <br/>\nthe capital. In those early days of unsatisfied feelings, most of <br/>\nthe roshis still did not have a clear idea of what movement or who <br/>\nthey should follow. All they knew was that they were impatient and <br/>\neager to do something to defend Japan. There were myriads of schools <br/>\nof thought - Sonno-joi, open up the country to learn from the gaijin <br/>\nand in turn attact them using the same technologies, support the <br/>\nBakufu - as Watsuki once remarked, it was an era where 100 people <br/>\nmay hold 100 different arguments and you can&#39;t say who&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s <br/>\none factor which makes this era as tumultuous and interesting as it <br/>\nis. The Bakufu decided that it would be to their advantage if they <br/>\ntook such roshis without any stand yet into their service, rather <br/>\nthan letting them roam about the capital.
