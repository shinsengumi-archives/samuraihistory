He took <br/>\nKannabe Castle (which he had been running when the Amako were <br/>\naround) from the Mori ..but they eventually took it back and he died <br/>\nlater during the following combat. This was in the Summer of 1569.<br/>\n<br/>\n      his brother, Fujii Taroemon... actually served the Mori from <br/>\nthe get go... he was a Naval Captain, I think.... I am pretty sure <br/>\nhe use to fight Oda&#39;s fleets in the waters between West Honshu and <br/>\nShikoku (from Hiroshima to Osaka).  I believe he eventually retired <br/>\nand he and one of his sons shaved their heads and became <br/>\nmonks/priest.. one Shingon and the other to Pure Land... I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n      The third brother, Fujii Saburoemon... I know nothing about. I <br/>\nthink he ended up traveling from Bitchu to Hazu-gun in Nagoya.<br/>\n<br/>\n      The fourth brother.. I have no idea... although I think he <br/>\nmight be related somehow to Kurozaemon perhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Anyway..this all took place in West Honshu out in the Mori <br/>\nterritories (like around Hiroshima and Okayama and Osaka)<br/>\n<br/>\n   Any info you could find/help me with.. I would appreciate it.<br/>\n  <br/>\n Thank you !</div>",
