There are at least three of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;7)Hanzo The Razor:The Snare-a great break from the tired genre of <br/>\n&gt;noble ronin films. The Hanzo films work as drama, parody, comedy and <br/>\n&gt;chambara. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a truly bizarre film, I do think list members will enjoy it, <br/>\njust don&#39;t let your &#39;gaki&#39; watch it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And for best Taiga drama-Toshiie & Matsu. OK, it&#39;s a `chick&#39; Taiga <br/>\n&gt;drama, but Toshiie is such an engaging goof and Matsu is just plain <br/>\n&gt;adorable.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What about Musashi? Still T&M was much better than Shinsengumi.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther films about historical characters that I think are fun are Onmyoji <br/>\nand one of the cheesiest ninja flicks, Sudden Death!<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
