            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1925586940\">Well &quot;Boyz&quot;,<br/>\n\tI am sure you mean Sengo MuraMASA of Ise, who was no madman  but <br/>\nrather a very gifted smith. Unfortunately for him and his fine works, <br/>\nhis swords figured in several accidents and a death or two involving <br/>\nthe Tokugawa family. Ieyasu was convinced they were bad luck for him <br/>\nand his kin, so forbid anyone to wear them in his presence, this became <br/>\nthe law after awhile applied to all who served the bakufu. Playwrights <br/>\nand novelists turned this into legend, spreading the infamy of the <br/>\nswords and the idea of the mad swordsmith. A shame really because fine <br/>\nworks were surely lost or destroyed because of people who took the <br/>\ntales too literally or who feared Tokugawa retribution.<br/>\n\tFor the real story on the Sengo school and Muramasa I recommend <br/>\nvisiting www.jssus.org(www.afuresearch.com) and picking up The Art and <br/>\nthe Sword (their annual) with the excellent articles by Dr. Gordon <br/>\nRobson DRE.<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
