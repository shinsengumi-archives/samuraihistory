It examined the relationship between Oda Nobunaga and Saito <br/>\nDosan, as well as the 4 years leading up to Nobunaga&#39;s invasion of <br/>\nMino.  It said recent scholarship points to Nobunaga being heavily <br/>\ninfluenced by Dosan (as opposed to his father, Oda Nobutora), who was <br/>\nvery brutal in his own right.  Definately an interesting show, anyone <br/>\nwith NHK should take a look, although next week is Lawrence of <br/>\nArabia...</div>",
