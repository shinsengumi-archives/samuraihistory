Problem is,<br/>\nsome people don&#39;t know the difference between history<br/>\nand pop-culture. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think most of us don&#39;t particularly care if someone<br/>\nhas a legitimate question. It&#39;s that too many times<br/>\nwe&#39;ve seen a legitimate answer get the response &quot;but<br/>\nthat&#39;s not true--my sensei told me so&quot; or &quot;but I saw<br/>\nit on Rurouni Kenshin&quot; or something. Nothing against<br/>\nthose who practice martial arts or watch anime, but<br/>\ncome on, people, if you don&#39;t like the answers you<br/>\nget, do a little research yourself. Books aren&#39;t that<br/>\nscary, trust me. (Well, okay, maybe Totman&#39;s &quot;The<br/>\nCollapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu&quot;...I&#39;ll admit I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t take it anymore after renewing it 3 times at<br/>\nthe library...I had to stop...I&#39;ll go slit my stomach<br/>\nnow). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; After all, it seems they&#39;ve pretty much given up on<br/>\n&gt; trying to educate people<br/>\n&gt; by correcting their mistakes... so why not just<br/>\n&gt; seperate the historians from<br/>\n&gt; the casual fans?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The give-up is because too many of those people either<br/>\na. don&#39;t want correction, only validation or b. don&#39;t<br/>\nrealize that the people they are talking to really<br/>\nKNOW what they are talking about. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m<br/>\nan expert, by any means--I&#39;m always open to<br/>\ncorrection. But when you&#39;ve got Tony, Evalerio, Will<br/>\nLetham, Kitsuno, Carlo/Tsubame, who are all experts in<br/>\nsome area, and someone still persists in telling them<br/>\nthey don&#39;t know what they are talking about, because<br/>\nthey read it online somewhere else, it&#39;s very<br/>\nfrustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI applaud your optimism and your response...I really<br/>\ndo agree with it. But it&#39;d be easier if we weren&#39;t<br/>\nbesieged almost daily with someone who either still<br/>\nthinks the Japanese walk around with swords and that<br/>\nninjas exist, or someone who wants to be one, or<br/>\nthinks that anime is a legitimate historical source,<br/>\nor...one of a hundred different things. <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

It&#39;s just the few elitists<br/>\ngetting their say. On one hand, I can&#39;t blame them, because they&#39;re<br/>\nconstantly having to deal with misconceptions about samurai and feudal Japan<br/>\nthat pop culture has taught people, especially *outside* of Japan. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow all that much about Musashi, but I do know that my boyfriend is greatly<br/>\ninspired by The Book of Five Rings, and I find there&#39;s nothing wrong with<br/>\nthat. That book has inspired many people and I think it&#39;s healthy, to be<br/>\nhonest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do, however, get annoyed when people make assumptions about history or<br/>\nhistorical figures without doing their own research by looking at more<br/>\nreliable sources. I can&#39;t believe how many people have come by here asking<br/>\nwhether Himura Kenshin really existed and whether the events of the anime<br/>\nare real. Geez. &gt;_&gt; A lot of the &quot;common&quot; information about Musashi  is most<br/>\nlikely legends embellished by time (and perhaps by himself and/or his own<br/>\nadmirers), too. I&#39;m no expert on Japanese history, but I&#39;m assuming the<br/>\nannoyance is coming from people interpreting legends as fact. Nonetheless,<br/>\nMiyamoto Musashi&#39;s Book of Five Rings has inspired a wide range of people,<br/>\nand I think that&#39;s a wonderful thing. The words themselves, I think, are<br/>\ntimeless and don&#39;t necessarily have to relate to a particular period of<br/>\nhistory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say, though, that the reaction of certain individuals on this list to<br/>\nnewbies asking uninformed questions is quite childish and unbecoming to my<br/>\neyes. Perhaps the admin(s) of this list should consider splitting Samurai<br/>\nHistory up into two lists, one more pop culture oriented and another more<br/>\nhistory oriented. That way, the elitist historian types are less likely to<br/>\nbe faced with questions that make them roll their eyes and act so rudely.<br/>\nAfter all, it seems they&#39;ve pretty much given up on trying to educate people<br/>\nby correcting their mistakes... so why not just seperate the historians from<br/>\nthe casual fans?<br/>\n<br/>\nSally </span></blockquote></div>",
