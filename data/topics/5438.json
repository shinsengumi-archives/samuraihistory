            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-354644174\">Gritty &#39;Samurai&#39; voice at 50<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Gary Arnold<br/>\nTHE WASHINGTON TIMES<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most persuasive argument for film preservation in my lifetime has <br/>\nbeen the continuing enhancement of Akira Kurosawa&#39;s &quot;Seven Samurai,&quot; <br/>\nwhich has returned through next weekend in a 50th-anniversary <br/>\nengagement at the American Film Institute&#39;s National Theater at the <br/>\nKennedy Center. <br/>\n    The last booking of this majestic historical-martial-social epic, <br/>\nthe most intimate and stirring of all cinematic adventure spectacles, <br/>\nrevealed an unexpected bonus: freshly colloquial and eye-opening <br/>\ntranslation of the Japanese dialogue, sometimes commensurate with an <br/>\nR rating. <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the context of the story  a vividly gritty celebration of <br/>\nself-defense set in the 16th century, when impoverished farmers <br/>\nsucceed in recruiting a band of samurai mercenaries to protect their <br/>\nnext harvest from marauding bandits  the previously obscured verbal <br/>\nbluntness and pungency were not out of line. <br/>\n<br/>\n    However, parents may want to take it into consideration when <br/>\nintroducing older children to this superlative movie. They&#39;ll be <br/>\nreading a more outspoken movie while seeing an eyeful of heroic <br/>\nconflict and sacrifice. <br/>\n<br/>\n    I first saw &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; in its original 160-minute import <br/>\nversion when I was in high school. By this time, more than four years <br/>\nafter its Japanese premiere, the movie already was a revival <br/>\nattraction, one of several foreign-language landmarks that came to my <br/>\nattention while frequenting the long-gone Berkeley, Calif., <br/>\nstorefront theaters the Cinema Guild & Studio, managed at that time <br/>\nby Pauline Kael. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Both the auditoriums and the screen sizes were cramped, to put it <br/>\nkindly, so quite a few years went by before I saw a suitably <br/>\nmagnified &quot;Samurai.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n    Columbia, the U.S. importer, also had renamed it &quot;The Magnificent <br/>\nSeven,&quot; the title of 1960&#39;s durably appealing John Sturges-directed <br/>\nWestern homage to Mr. Kurosawa&#39;s prototype, which co-starred Yul <br/>\nBrynner and Steve McQueen. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Film historian Donald Richie prepared the groundwork for an <br/>\neventual restoration of the complete &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; in his 1965 <br/>\ncritical study, &quot;The Films of Akira Kurosawa.&quot; His appreciation was <br/>\nshadowed by a provocative caveat: &quot;Nevertheless, &#39;Seven Samurai&#39; has, <br/>\noutside Japan in 1954, never really been seen. This is one of the <br/>\nmajor cinematic tragedies.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n    Americans weren&#39;t the only ones who had been shortchanged. A <br/>\nlater historian, Stuart Galbraith IV, chronicled the careers of Mr. <br/>\nKurosawa and his pre-eminent leading man, Toshiro Mifune, in a volume <br/>\ntitled &quot;The Emperor and the Wolf.&quot; Mr. Galbraith wrote: &quot;Because of <br/>\nits extreme length, the complete &#39;Seven Samurai&#39; ... was limited to <br/>\nits first few weeks [of release], and only in Japan&#39;s biggest cities. <br/>\nIn rural areas and in subsequent runs it was cut to a more <br/>\nmanageable, if compromised length.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n    Evidently, the shortened Japanese versions corresponded to the <br/>\n160-minute export edition, which betrayed little slack and dazzled <br/>\nits first generation of U.S. admirers. A complete reissue began <br/>\ncreeping up on the public eager to discover it. There were <br/>\nscattered &quot;special event&quot; bookings toward the end of the 1960s and a <br/>\nPBS telecast in 1972. However, another decade passed before the <br/>\nJapanese distributor, Toho, mounted a full-blown theatrical revival <br/>\nof the whole show, which reached Washington in spring 1983 and <br/>\nclinched the case for greatness. <br/>\n<br/>\n    The cuts had shaved certain episodes to the bone. The <br/>\nrestorations disclosed how methodical, straightforward and detailed <br/>\nthe complete scenario had been. All the subplots, the private little <br/>\ndramas played out against the larger crisis of defending and saving <br/>\nthe village, were systematic and absorbing rather than fleeting. <br/>\n<br/>\n    The cumulative effect added thematic weight and dignity to what <br/>\nalways had seemed a nobly envisioned and realized movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nIncredibly, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is still demonstrating room for <br/>\nimprovement in the first decade of a new century. The video editions <br/>\nof the movie have yet to reflect the recent changes to the subtitles, <br/>\nso for the time being, the most complete &quot;Samurai&quot; is an exclusive at <br/>\nrepertory theaters. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Who says things are always going from bad to worse? In this case, <br/>\na great movie keeps getting better than you realized. <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    TITLE: &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (&quot;Shichinin no Samurai&quot;) <br/>\n<br/>\n    RATING: No MPAA rating (Made in 1954, decades before the advent <br/>\nof a rating system; adult subject matter, with occasional violent <br/>\nepisodes, including extended battle scenes; occasional profanity, <br/>\ncomic vulgarity and fleeting sexual allusions) <br/>\n<br/>\n    CREDITS: Directed by Akira Kurosawa.
