I call it the &#39;Sir Walter Scott&#39; effect though it <br/>\ngoes back even further in history than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2)       Can we &quot;market&quot; the samurai list in such a way that the purpose of<br/>\n&gt;the list is better communicated to list members and potential members? How<br/>\n&gt;can we better communicate our purpose as discussion of serious (but fun)<br/>\n&gt;Japan history, as opposed to discussion of the ninja crowd, or video game<br/>\n&gt;aficionados, or martial artists, or manga?  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Give them to Tony along with a flensing knive? Change the group name to <br/>\nsomething so obscure that nobody can find it? Force people to take a <br/>\nlangauge test showing that they can write in their native tongue? Have <br/>\nthem prove that they have read the FAQ? We have moderators when it comes <br/>\ndown to extremes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4)       Can we create a discussion environment where we encourage more open<br/>\n&gt;free discussion without intimidation, and yet still raise the level of<br/>\n&gt;discourse?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That requires communication both ways. Some people require an <br/>\napplication of brute force for this to occur. I haven&#39;t found the &#39;beat&#39; <br/>\nkey on my computer yet, but if I ever do, I&#39;m going back to books!<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
