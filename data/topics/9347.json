The stone marker is bigger than I had recollected. Funny how <br/>\n&gt;memory<br/>\n&gt;  can play tricks. But the brick columns of the building behind it looks <br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt;  like the commercial office building I remember.

First, I made the mistake of going directly to the current <br/>\n&gt;Honnoji,<br/>\n&gt;  but was told that Honnoji had been relocated since Nobunaga&#39;s death. The <br/>\n&gt;guy<br/>\n&gt;  at the temple pointed me in the general direction to go, but I really <br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  know the exactly location. So with some difficulty, I eventually figured <br/>\n&gt;out<br/>\n&gt;  where the marker was located so I could hike out to find it. I found the<br/>\n&gt;  location by visiting a nearby museum of history that was very close to<br/>\n&gt;  Honnoji. The museum had historical maps and tourist maps for sale, and I<br/>\n&gt;  asked a woman at the museum information booth where the old Honnoji was.<br/>\n&gt;  Between the two of us, we searched one of the maps and we figured out <br/>\n&gt;where<br/>\n&gt;  the old Honnoji was. If I recall correctly, it was about a twenty minute<br/>\n&gt;  twenty-five minute walk from Honnoji. When I found it, the marker was <br/>\n&gt;pretty<br/>\n&gt;  non-descript. The marker was relatively modest grey stone, to my<br/>\n&gt;  recollection perhaps 70-80 centimeters tall, located in a very <br/>\n&gt;non-descript<br/>\n&gt;  residential neighborhood. The marker itself was located immediately in <br/>\n&gt;front<br/>\n&gt;  of the commercial office of a model house showroom and an elementary <br/>\n&gt;school.<br/>\n&gt;  The kids were laughing, playing, shouting in the background. I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt;  that I have a photo of it. I&#39;m not much of a photography kind of guy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Mike<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  _____<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  From: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com]<br/>\n&gt;  On Behalf Of Anthony Bryant<br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Friday, February 09, 2007 4:54 AM<br/>\n&gt;  To: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: death of nobunaga and jube yagyu<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  On Feb 7, 2007, at 4:07 PM, Nate Ledbetter wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Actually, theres&#39; a small marker in front of some<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; building--I thing it&#39;s a hotel--that marks the former<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; spot of the Honnoji.

First, I made the mistake of going directly to the current Honnoji,<br/>\n but was told that Honnoji had been relocated since Nobunaga&#39;s death. The guy<br/>\n at the temple pointed me in the general direction to go, but I really didn&#39;t<br/>\n know the exactly location. So with some difficulty, I eventually figured out<br/>\n where the marker was located so I could hike out to find it. I found the<br/>\n location by visiting a nearby museum of history that was very close to<br/>\n Honnoji. The museum had historical maps and tourist maps for sale, and I<br/>\n asked a woman at the museum information booth where the old Honnoji was.<br/>\n Between the two of us, we searched one of the maps and we figured out where<br/>\n the old Honnoji was. If I recall correctly, it was about a twenty minute<br/>\n twenty-five minute walk from Honnoji. When I found it, the marker was pretty<br/>\n non-descript. The marker was relatively modest grey stone, to my<br/>\n recollection perhaps 70-80 centimeters tall, located in a very non-descript<br/>\n residential neighborhood. The marker itself was located immediately in front<br/>\n of the commercial office of a model house showroom and an elementary school.<br/>\n The kids were laughing, playing, shouting in the background.
