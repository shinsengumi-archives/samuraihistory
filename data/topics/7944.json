Several years after the death of Musashi was wrote a compilation with the testimonies of the witnesses of this event. The book was called &quot;Niten-Ki&quot;, the first biography of Musashi. In the book one of the chapters had a info about Musashi, accord this text he had both swords in the duel. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe left the Daito in the boat and took the Shoto and the Suburito with him.  In the fight he just used the Suburito.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have a resume of  this book but in spanish and my english is bad.<br/>\n <br/>\nBest regards, <br/>\n<br/>\nHelly<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThomas Davidson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tom.davidson@...\">tom.davidson@...</a>&gt; escribió:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Guys,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know the true story of Musashi when he was about to duel <br/>\n&gt; with Sasaki Kojiro?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Short answer - no - no-one knows, as there are no records of the duel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat a duelist should forget his weapon is patent nonsense, and shows<br/>\nhow a myth collects in time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne aspect of the duel often ignored is the psychological ploys<br/>\nemployed to unsettle one&#39;s opponent.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-380511008\">Guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know the true story of Musashi when he was about to duel <br/>\nwith Sasaki Kojiro. He was on the small boat and made a bokken (later <br/>\ncalled suburito) from an oar?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the movie starring Mifune, he was actually bringing his sword but he <br/>\npicked an oar to use for the duel as he was asked by the boat-man, why <br/>\ndo you make a bokken and not use your sword? Musashi said: &quot;I like the <br/>\nsize&quot;. While other source on website saying the Musashi actually forgot <br/>\nhis sword and he had to make a bokken from an oar.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the excerpt from the site: &quot;Musashi Miyamoto, arguably Japan&#39;s <br/>\ngreatest swordsman, overslept one morning. He was due to meet one of his <br/>\nmany challengers and was already running late. As he bolted from his bed <br/>\nto the door, he, incredibly, forgot his sword!! Hastily, he boarded the <br/>\nsmall boat that was to take him to a small island (sandbar) where his <br/>\narmed opponent awaited him anxiously. Realizing his predicament along <br/>\nthe way, he grabbed one of the boat&#39;s oars and, with a small knife, <br/>\nbegan whittling a crudely-shaped katana from it. Arriving at his <br/>\ndestination, Musashi greeted his adversary. The man laughed and <br/>\nconfidently drew his weapon and attacked the awaiting Musashi. With a <br/>\nswift series of graceful movements, Musashi expertly defended himself <br/>\nand quickly dispatched the over-zealous opponent by crushing his <br/>\nskull!!! ... and so was born the Suburito.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is, did Musashi actually forget his sword and have to make <br/>\na bokken from an oar or did he actually like the size of the oar and <br/>\nprefer using it to using his sword?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nTotok Sudarijanto<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mjer.org\">http://www.mjer.org</a><br/>\nemail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:totok.sudarijanto@...\">totok.sudarijanto@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The ultimate aim of martial arts is not having to use them.&quot;</div>",
