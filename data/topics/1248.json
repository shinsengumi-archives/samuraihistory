I&#39;m talking about so-called knightly swords, not the tradition of smallswords, rapiers, officers&#39; sabres and so on. Actual, knightly-class, swords.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The samurai class in Japan constituted a much greater percentage of the<br/>\n&gt; population<br/>\n&gt; than the knightly class did in Europe.  Consequently there were a lot<br/>\n&gt; more swords<br/>\n&gt; made and a lot more survived.   The notion that the Europeans had no<br/>\n&gt; notion of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;protecting things&quot; is simply not true.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I&#39;m talking about specifically taking care of swords. How many European swords from the 1300s have a mirror polish on them? There are hundreds of Japanese swords of this age that do. There&#39;s a<br/>\ndifference between stashing them somewhere for safekeeping, and keeping them in a treasure house and cleaning them periodically.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are still fabulous collections<br/>\n&gt; of medieval weapons all over Europe in museums and private hands.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;ve seen quite a few. But in terms of numbers, they&#39;re still lower (percentage, by date) than those in Japan, and in less good condition. How often do swords in Japan get classified from a battlefield<br/>\nfind? Not too often, but many of the examples that Oakenshott and others use to classify types are dug up out of the ground and need to be conserved, rather than preserved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The habit of carrying swords in the west, medieval or not, only ended<br/>\n&gt; about 150<br/>\n&gt; years ago.   Officers in the Civil War carried swords and used them.   When<br/>\n&gt; the Queen of Holland gave General Eisenhower a token of her country&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; esteem,<br/>\n&gt; it was a highly decorated sword, not a machine gun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I&#39;m talking &quot;knightly swords&quot; not modern swords. The way we regard them and still use them (e.g., still in today&#39;s army and so forth we have officers&#39; dress swords) is irrelevant to a discussion of<br/>\nhistorical knightly swords. Comparing these to Japanese swords is apples and oranges; better to compare those to gunto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are now numerous books available in English for westerners interested<br/>\n&gt; in the Japanese sword.   I would be glad to post a bibliography of such<br/>\n&gt; items<br/>\n&gt; if there are sufficient requests.   A good book for beginners is John<br/>\n&gt; Yumoto&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; classic work, &quot;The Samurai Sword, A Handbook&quot; published by Tuttle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A good book, but rather basic. Personally, I prefer my Japanese books... I think I only have two or three in English.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",

However note that even stainless steel rusts if <br/>\nit&#39;s not cared for, it&#39;s just a slower process than pure high carbon <br/>\nsteels. I wouldn&#39;t call this a secret of this period, it wasn&#39;t really <br/>\nuntil the late 19th and early 20th century that people understood why <br/>\ncertain iron ores had superior characteristics for certain applications. <br/>\nBeing high in nickel is not necessarily a good characteristic, most <br/>\nstainless steels are inferior in edge holding characteristics compared <br/>\nto pure high carbon steels which is why most good carpenter tools are <br/>\nstill made from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",

In the Civil War era<br/>\n&gt; you were <br/>\n&gt; never sure who you could trust, and in the Edo<br/>\n&gt; period you were <br/>\n&gt; never sure how someone might react from what you<br/>\n&gt; say.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To offer a quick paraphrase, one man offered a<br/>\n&gt; compliment <br/>\n&gt; regarding the other&#39;s blade, but the other guy took<br/>\n&gt; it as a <br/>\n&gt; veiled jibe, &quot;are you implying that I am not man<br/>\n&gt; enough for<br/>\n&gt; this blade!&quot; The next moment they&#39;re killing each<br/>\n&gt; other.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are strict rules of ettiquette with regard to<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; handling of swords taught in the martial ryu, not<br/>\n&gt; the least <br/>\n&gt; because there&#39;s always the chance that when you show<br/>\n&gt; someone <br/>\n&gt; your sword he then kills you with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An example:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The two men are kneeling opposite each other. The<br/>\n&gt; man passing <br/>\n&gt; the sword holds it horizontally, blade towards<br/>\n&gt; himself, one <br/>\n&gt; hand on the scabbard and one on the hilt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As he passes it, the receiver also takes a grip of<br/>\n&gt; both <br/>\n&gt; scabbard and hilt, and rolls the blade edge inward<br/>\n&gt; towards <br/>\n&gt; himself as he takes it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * * *<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is founded on the principle that:<br/>\n&gt; a - if you hand a sword over holding just the<br/>\n&gt; scabbard, the <br/>\n&gt; receiver can grab the hilt, draw the blade and cut<br/>\n&gt; you. You can <br/>\n&gt; do likewise to him as he receives it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; b - if you hold just the hilt, the scabbard might<br/>\n&gt; slip off <br/>\n&gt; (although the fit should be sufficient to prevent<br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; happening - they do wear in time, and worse things<br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; happened).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Likewise turning the blade edge towards oneself<br/>\n&gt; means it is <br/>\n&gt; harder to draw (because of the curve), and the blade<br/>\n&gt; edge is <br/>\n&gt; not pointing at the other guy (plain good manners).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Apart from that, it&#39;s purely a matter of politeness.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; impolite to point a drawn blade at someone, or its<br/>\n&gt; edge, in any <br/>\n&gt; country. Swords are sharp and can cut, and for this<br/>\n&gt; reason <br/>\n&gt; alone should be treated with respect.

The famous grass cutter and <br/>\nother blades are the holy grails of Samurai Myth & Legend.  I also <br/>\nknow that if a blade is inspected they have a very special method <br/>\n(almost cermonial) to preserve the blade after inspection.  <br/>\nCan you tell us exaclty why Samurai blades have survived so long with <br/>\nso little oxidation?  Or you can tell me that I&#39;m on crack and <br/>\neverything I just said was also misinformed.  You are the expert.  I <br/>\ntrust anything you would tell us more than any other western souce.  <br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon<br/>\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;Anthony J.

As <br/>\nsomeone else as said, I doubt if samurai were in the habit of <br/>\nshowing swords to each other. In the Civil War era you were <br/>\nnever sure who you could trust, and in the Edo period you were <br/>\nnever sure how someone might react from what you say.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo offer a quick paraphrase, one man offered a compliment <br/>\nregarding the other&#39;s blade, but the other guy took it as a <br/>\nveiled jibe, &quot;are you implying that I am not man enough for<br/>\nthis blade!&quot; The next moment they&#39;re killing each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are strict rules of ettiquette with regard to the <br/>\nhandling of swords taught in the martial ryu, not the least <br/>\nbecause there&#39;s always the chance that when you show someone <br/>\nyour sword he then kills you with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two men are kneeling opposite each other. The man passing <br/>\nthe sword holds it horizontally, blade towards himself, one <br/>\nhand on the scabbard and one on the hilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he passes it, the receiver also takes a grip of both <br/>\nscabbard and hilt, and rolls the blade edge inward towards <br/>\nhimself as he takes it.<br/>\n<br/>\n* * *<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is founded on the principle that:<br/>\na - if you hand a sword over holding just the scabbard, the <br/>\nreceiver can grab the hilt, draw the blade and cut you. You can <br/>\ndo likewise to him as he receives it.<br/>\n<br/>\nb - if you hold just the hilt, the scabbard might slip off <br/>\n(although the fit should be sufficient to prevent this <br/>\nhappening - they do wear in time, and worse things have <br/>\nhappened).<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise turning the blade edge towards oneself means it is <br/>\nharder to draw (because of the curve), and the blade edge is <br/>\nnot pointing at the other guy (plain good manners).<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from that, it&#39;s purely a matter of politeness. It&#39;s <br/>\nimpolite to point a drawn blade at someone, or its edge, in any <br/>\ncountry. Swords are sharp and can cut, and for this reason <br/>\nalone should be treated with respect. Imagine someone <br/>\nshowing you his gun by pointing it at your face!<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
