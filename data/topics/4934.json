The samurai rose to <br/>\npredominance during the late Heian and the Kamakura periods. It was the <br/>\nGempei war between two great provincial clans (the Taira and the Minamoto) <br/>\nwhich resulted in the establishment of an hereditary Shogunate, and defined <br/>\nthe medieval era. In the war, women participated in political, economic and <br/>\nnot least, military roles. Standing beside many of the great men was an <br/>\nequally great woman, but their stories are often documented unreliably (if <br/>\nat all), and rarely filter through to English language sources. What was <br/>\nwomen�s role in establishing the supremacy of the Samurai and how did their <br/>\nposition change? Discussed with particular emphasis on the martial sphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nJapan is often thought of as a strong patriarchy with a tradition of <br/>\noppression of women. Even today there are many areas of unresolved <br/>\ndiscrimination against women. Japanese history centers on the deeds of <br/>\nheroic warriors, and the Samurai is perhaps the most widely recognized <br/>\nsymbol of Japan internationally. Women, however, were not necessarily always <br/>\nkept indoors practicing flower arranging. Alongside some of the most <br/>\nlegendary warriors fought women. Before the entrenching of the Shogunate and <br/>\nSamurai dominated feudalism, women were soldiers, generals, strategists, <br/>\njudges, Empresses and even Regent Shogun. Women contributed significantly to <br/>\nestablishing the social structure which would come to repress them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a significant change in the role of Japanese women over the Heian, <br/>\nKamakura and Muromachi eras as society moved from a matriarchal influence to <br/>\na patriarchal structure. Representative of this change was the social <br/>\nupheaval around the Gempei war of the late twelfth century, and that period <br/>\nis the focus of this paper. Were the women warriors of the period acting <br/>\naccording to ancient matriarchal principles in an attempt to maintain old <br/>\ntraditions in a period of chaotic change? Were they trying to enter a male <br/>\nworld upon the collapse of the old order with its certainties and clearly <br/>\ndefined roles? Or were they fighting because in an all out war every hand is <br/>\nneeded? What reasons may there be for these women either to be largely <br/>\nignored in standard historical accounts or for their histories to be turned <br/>\ninto myth? In seeking answers to these questions there will be an overview <br/>\nof conditions extant in the period under consideration and the lives and <br/>\nactivities of a range of female protagonists who were active players during <br/>\nthe period will be examined.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore discussing these women&#39;s lives, the deeds for which they are <br/>\nremembered and the background of the wars in which they fought, there is a <br/>\nwider historical context which must be addressed: the status of women. The <br/>\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries were turbulent times of great changes in <br/>\nJapan, seeing the rise of the Samurai, Shogunate and warrior ethics and the <br/>\ndiminishment of the leisurely court life devoted to the arts for which the <br/>\nHeian period is best known.  Not surprisingly, this was also an era of <br/>\nsignificant change for women.  The status of women decreased rapidly through <br/>\nthis era into the oppression of the Sengoku and Edo (or Tokugawa) periods.  <br/>\nIt is the laws of those later years which people generally seem to associate <br/>\nwith Japan, projecting women�s status from those eras back to earlier times. <br/>\nIn fact, in the opening centuries of the CE the regions which then composed <br/>\nJapan were under matriarchal rule (although possibly much earlier also, this <br/>\nis the date from which Chinese written records provide primary evidence) . <br/>\nThis tradition was so strong that when a man inherited rule a bloody civil <br/>\nwar broke out, appeased only when a woman assumed the throne .  Skipping <br/>\n1400 years, by the age of Sengoku Turnbull writes that there was no <br/>\nequivalent to Tomoe, nor �any woman remotely approaching the status of <br/>\nMasako� .  In contrast, Sengoku women were treated as objects, useful only <br/>\nfor seiryaku kekkon, political alliance marriages .  He goes on to give <br/>\noften graphic examples of the negative treatment of Sengoku women.  The <br/>\nperiod with which we are concerned is set between these extremes. Although <br/>\nactive in many areas, women were moving increasingly to the periphery of <br/>\nsociety.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the rise of the Samurai and Bushido warrior ideology, women�s status <br/>\ndeclined, and the intellectual women�s networks disappeared . However useful <br/>\nwomen may have been on the battlefield they were still inferior. Although <br/>\nTomoe was among his last seven defenders, when the time came for him to die, <br/>\na man asks her �how would Yoshinaka be shamed if in his last fight he died <br/>\nwith a woman?� and sends her away . However, as Bingham and Gross point out, <br/>\n�In a curious way�bushido created a parallel ideal for Japanese women of the <br/>\nSamurai class� .  It is no coincidence that the legendary women of this <br/>\nperiod were themselves warriors or military strategists. War was <br/>\nall-important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the lower classes gender was a less significant issue. Women worked <br/>\nalongside men, inherited property and had property rights in divorces, which <br/>\nwere easily obtained .  After the mid-seventh century Confucian style Taika <br/>\nreforms, �women were barred from becoming government officials, and a <br/>\nwomen�s share of government-distributed land (kubunden) was set at <br/>\ntwo-thirds of that for a man� . Despite this women in rural areas were <br/>\nsomewhat better off; if necessary they could hold the office of steward, <br/>\nwhich in some areas was the highest local authority, and entailed tax <br/>\ncollecting, providing military services, and carrying out all law and also <br/>\ninfrastructure .<br/>\n<br/>\nMarriage had traditionally centered on women, with the husband joining her <br/>\nfamily and daughters inheriting and having income rights . Although this <br/>\nsystem continued in the lower classes until the nineteenth century, the <br/>\nSamurai (increasingly and eventually exclusively) adopted the ie, an <br/>\nexclusively patrilineal, primogenitural and hierarchical family structure .<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough �Japanese women have traditionally had an unusually prominent role <br/>\nin dealing with the supernatural� , Japan: An illustrated Encyclopedia <br/>\nattributes the decline in women�s status to Confucianism, Buddhism and the <br/>\neconomic changes brought about by protracted warfare, which cause <br/>\nprimogeniture to be safer . How did the different religions affect women�s <br/>\nstatus?<br/>\nReligious beliefs may be assumed to have a significant influence over social <br/>\nmorality and values, including gender relations.  In the �native� religion <br/>\nof Shintoism the first-born god is in fact a goddess, Amateratsu.  As the <br/>\neldest she inherited the earth and sent her grandson to rule Japan, giving <br/>\nhim the three items of the Imperial Regalia .  Thus members of the Japanese <br/>\nImperial Family are her descendants, and she is Japan�s principal deity.  <br/>\nThe best evidence for a positive Shinto attitude towards gender equality was <br/>\nthe existence of �female shamans who acted as powerful religious and <br/>\npolitical leaders� .  The negative side however is the strong focus on <br/>\npollution, which excludes women from certain places and ceremonies because <br/>\nof their �unclean� reproductive processes .<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the early sixth century CE Buddhism was brought to Japan from Korea , and <br/>\nbecame a major religion.  Because of the many different sects and <br/>\ninterpretations, Buddhism presented a more mixed view of women.  On the one <br/>\nhand, Buddhist convents provided a refuge for women whose status had been <br/>\nremoved or who were seeking divorce; an outlet for charitable works, <br/>\nlearning, and leadership roles, and women even founded temples . On the <br/>\nother hand, although some sects preached equality others focused again on <br/>\npollution or on female specific sins, elements which prevented female <br/>\nenlightenment until they were reborn as men .<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Confucianism arrived in Japan from China at around the same time as <br/>\nBuddhism, it did not become a dominant philosophy until much later , its <br/>\nrise accompanying that of the Samurai.  According to Bingham and Gross, in <br/>\nJapan �Confucianism seems to have been entirely negative for women� , <br/>\nalthough they contradictorily discuss some benefits.  For example, in return <br/>\nfor her obedience, a woman could expect her male relatives to safeguard her <br/>\nwelfare; in old age she would be looked after; and as the mother of sons her <br/>\npower within the family could increase . The price was severely reduced <br/>\nindependence, expressed through the Triple Obedience Doctrine.  This <br/>\nprescribes that a woman should always be under the control of a male <br/>\nrelative (father, brother/husband, son) .  In addition, a new bride was <br/>\ntotally subservient to her mother-in-law, a system which caused centuries of <br/>\nmisery .  It is from Confusion philosophy that a plethora of very sexist <br/>\nproverbs stem, and which promoted the idea that husband and wife not display <br/>\npublic affection for each other .  The impact of these attitudes is clear in <br/>\nlaw and in the Tokugawa �house rules.�<br/>\n<br/>\nTo take a closer look at some specific Samurai traditions, a philosophy now <br/>\nassociated deeply with Japan in general and Samurai in particular is Zen. <br/>\nIts focus on austerity and, simplistically put, voidness, appealed to the <br/>\nSamurai and became an important philosophical source in notions of <br/>\nself-destruction.  In a philosophy that came to have such strong association <br/>\nwith warriors, it is interesting that a woman played an important role in <br/>\nits early years in Japan.  Mugai Nyodai lived for most of the thirteenth <br/>\ncentury , and rarely for a non-literary Japanese woman, is know in her own <br/>\nright, rather than by her association with a man (in fact, her father and <br/>\nhusband are unknown) .  Although married to a Hojo, for some reason she <br/>\nbegan to study Zen under Mugaku Sogen, a Chinese priest who had been invited <br/>\nto Japan in 1279 to head a temple .  She became his star pupil, and he <br/>\nacknowledged her as the heir to his teachings, giving her the character Mu <br/>\nfrom his own name . Mugai was the first women in Japan �fully qualified not <br/>\nas a nun but as a Zen priest (Zen so)� . She founded a network of temples <br/>\nand convents, and served as Abbess of them .<br/>\nThe overarching philosophy of the Samurai was Bushido, and it is symbiotic <br/>\nwith martial training. How then did it apply to women? Nitobe Inazo�s text <br/>\n�Bushido� on Samurai ethics first appeared in bookshops in 1900 .  It reads <br/>\nvery strongly as an attempt to justify Bushido and Japanese culture to <br/>\nChristians and Europeans. �Bushido� contains an entire chapter on women,  <br/>\nand it is largely concerned with arguing that Japanese women are just as <br/>\nchaste and feminine/domestic as their Western counterparts.  Before this <br/>\nhowever Inazo makes a revealing comment: �While the Samurai went on <br/>\npractising and extolling martial traits�they went so far as to tinge the <br/>\nideals of womanhood with Amazonian character� .  His description of the <br/>\neducation of young girls� demonstrates many similarities to that of young <br/>\nboys.  They �were trained to repress their feelings, to indurate their <br/>\nnerves, to manipulate weapons�  and how to commit suicide .  Bushido most <br/>\nvalued women who �displayed a heroic fortitude worthy of the strongest and <br/>\nthe bravest of men� .  Inazo refers to the triple-obedience doctrine, <br/>\nlinking it to self-sacrifice and suicide with numerous examples .  Woman <br/>\nannihilates herself for man, and he for his master .  Thus women have the <br/>\nsame moral duty as men, but directed by gender, not status.  Also woman were <br/>\nthought to provide naijo, inner help, as their primary duty .  The examples <br/>\nof many warrior women clearly indicate that a woman�s help was not <br/>\nrestricted to naijo � if it seemed necessary her martial training could be <br/>\nput to immediate use.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Tyler most Samurai class women received instruction in the <br/>\nmartial arts . Amdur points out that in the early days of the Samurai, women <br/>\nwere pioneers in dangerous new lands, where martial skills were extremely <br/>\nnecessary . Salmondson claims that every Samurai woman was expected to <br/>\nmaster the naginata (see below) by the time she was eighteen . In fact, she <br/>\nargues that Samurai women were vital to defense and offence throughout the <br/>\nmedieval era . To quote Ribner and Chin:<br/>\n�As part of their position, the Samurai women were expected to be as <br/>\nexcellent with weapons as the Samurai men of their families. Starting when <br/>\nthey were young girls, they were taught how to use several traditional <br/>\nweapons- the straight spear, the dagger, and, of course, the naginata. This <br/>\nlong weapon was usually hung over the doors of every Samurai household, and <br/>\nwomen were expected to protect their homes with it if necessary. More than <br/>\nthis, women were sometimes important warriors in their own right, commanding <br/>\nlarge numbers of men in huge battles� .<br/>\nA naginata is a curved sword blade attached to a spear, is between five and <br/>\nnine feet long  and was especially used by women and priests . There were <br/>\nother weapons which were particularly favored for women also. The bow was <br/>\nuseful for defending the home at long distances, such as from the roof ; a <br/>\nsmall dagger was always carried in case suicide became necessary ; and <br/>\nfinally the kusari-gama, which resembles a cycle with a weighted chain  and <br/>\nis useful against a sword and in close quarters. This shows that although <br/>\ntheir presence on a battlefield was unusual (as is shown by Hatakeyama�s <br/>\nsurprise at seeing Tomoe) women were actually expected to possess martial <br/>\nskills. Samurai women maintained these skills until modernization (see <br/>\nbelow).<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout a doubt, Tome Gozen is the most famous of Japan�s women warriors. <br/>\nThere are two primary sources relating to Tomoe: The Heike Monogatari and <br/>\nthe Gempei Josui Ki. Sadly the only English translation I could obtain of <br/>\nthe Heike Monogatari is abridged and much (although not all) of Tomoe&#39;s <br/>\nstory has been left out, and no translation of the other is available, so <br/>\nthese works are only accessed through secondary authors. Tyler is a <br/>\nparticularly valuable source since his translations are his own. Tyler <br/>\ncautions that the story of Tomoe has been much embroidered, and therefore <br/>\nnot all of the story which is to follow can be considered historical truth. <br/>\nIn the majority it comes, however, from primary sources. Tomoe fought with <br/>\nYoshinaka Minamoto. Tomoe is described as a horse-breaker who rode <br/>\nfearlessly on the roughest ground; her handling of bow and sword a match for <br/>\na thousand warriors; she had won matchless renown in many battles against <br/>\nthe bravest captains; in short, she was &quot;fit to meet either god or devil&quot; . <br/>\nOther descriptions add that she had commanded large forces ; including that <br/>\nshe was �commander of Minamoto forces in the earlier phases of the <br/>\nTaira-Minamoto war�  and that her fierce horse kicked up so much snow that <br/>\nthe Taira thought they were facing a dozen men . As Yoshinaka retreated from <br/>\nKyoto with Yoshitsune in pursuit, Tomoe escaped injury through several <br/>\nfierce battles , and in the &quot;last fight, when all the others had been slain <br/>\nor had fled, among the last seven there rode Tomoe&quot; . It is for these last <br/>\nskirmishes that she is famous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a disastrous engagement with Yoshitsune, Yoshinaka and his forces rode <br/>\nto meet Imai Kanehira who was commanding forces in Seta . They were pursued <br/>\nalong the way until, as the quote says, only seven accompanied the <br/>\ndishonorably fleeing Yoshinaka . According to The Gempei Josui Ki, the head <br/>\nof the force pursuing them was Hatakeyama, who was puzzled to see a <br/>\nformidable warrior he did not recognize . Upon being informed that she was <br/>\nTomoe, a women, he appears to have been somewhat at a loss how to handle the <br/>\nsituation . He eventually decided to engage her in single combat, in the <br/>\nprocess concluded that she must be a demon, and as a result retreated . A <br/>\nlittle later the band of seven encountered around thirty-five riders, led by <br/>\nUchida, who despite being afraid of Tomoe had orders from Yoritomo to <br/>\ncapture her alive . This did not prevent him from trying to behead her, but <br/>\nshe returned the favor and presented the head to Yoshinaka, who was <br/>\nprofoundly unenthusiastic . He commanded her to leave so that dying with a <br/>\nwoman would not disgrace him, and sent her to inform his wife of what had <br/>\nhappened . The Heike Monogatari differs slightly, placing Tomoe&#39;s duel after <br/>\nshe has been ordered to leave, and she searches out a commander to fight to <br/>\nprove her worth to Yoshinaka . Any number of naginata schools have claimed <br/>\nher as their founder , despite the fact that she is described as using a <br/>\nsword, bow and dagger, but not a naginata.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere in a Noh play titled Tomoe which &quot;is the only nibamme-mono <br/>\n[warrior-genre] in which the shite (main character) is a woman&quot; . In the <br/>\nplay the cowardliness the chronicles describe in Yoshinaka is ignored; in <br/>\nfact he has been deified . Tomoe on the other hand is a ghost tainted by her <br/>\nbitterness at his refusal to allow her to die with him . Thus although it <br/>\npays tribute to Tomoe&#39;s valor, &quot;she is stained and, in an important sense, <br/>\nhumbled. In this manner the play restores proper harmony&quot; . So although <br/>\nTomoe captured the popular imagination, it was inconceivable that a woman <br/>\ncould display more honor than a man, particularly a great General such as <br/>\nYoshinaka. Heroic warrior though she was, she was not worthy spiritually to <br/>\ndie with her lord as any male retainer could have done. Yoshinaka needed her <br/>\nhelp but seems to have been uncomfortable about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomoe was not, by any means, the only woman to fight in the Gempei war and <br/>\nthe surrounding years; it is the great number who did, in fact, which led to <br/>\nmy choice of this period. She is the best documented however, and warnings <br/>\nabout unreliability must be emphasized even further for the other women <br/>\ndiscussed below. Tomoe was not the only woman to ride with Yoshinaka. <br/>\nAnother female commander was Aoi, who had however been killed before the <br/>\nescape from Kyoto . It is interesting that most women warriors fought on the <br/>\nside which lost. Perhaps the desperation of their side�s situation allowed <br/>\nthem to put their skills to the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other side was Yoshitsune&#39;s mistress Shizuka Gozen, who did use a <br/>\nnaginata and to good effect, notably in the defense of Horikawa palace in <br/>\n1185 . Shizuka was a very famous Shirabyoshi dancer, a style in which the <br/>\ndancer dresses as a man . Her defiance after her capture by Yoritomo, <br/>\ndespite her pregnancy, is one of the most romantic episodes in the <br/>\nthoroughly romanticized story of Yoshitsune, and two Noh plays Yoshino <br/>\nShizuka and Futari Shizuka retell the tale . After her interrogation she was <br/>\nordered to dance for Yoritomo and some of his favored vassals . She <br/>\naccompanied the dance with a song in praise of Yoshitsune and longing for <br/>\ntheir happy days to return, a deliberate insult to Yoritomo and a <br/>\npotentially fatal act of defiance . Her life was spared allegedly because of <br/>\nthe intercession of Yoritomo�s wife and daughter , but her son was killed at <br/>\nbirth and she died a year later . Her decision to face death and remain <br/>\nloyal to her lord exemplifies Samurai ethos.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen faced with a rebellion in 1221, Masako Hojo over-rode her brother&#39;s <br/>\ndefensive plan to enforce her own aggressive tactical decisions, which <br/>\nresulted in total victory . The fact that the army supported a female <br/>\nGeneral over a male one again indicates that in times of crisis martial <br/>\nability was more important than gender. Early in his career Masako�s husband <br/>\nYoritomo had his life saved by Ike Gozen, a Zen nun, warrior, and Fujiwara . <br/>\nThe famed first Shogun (in the modern sense) seems to have been surrounded <br/>\nby strong women.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen attempted feats their male counterparts would not, caused desperation <br/>\namong their enemies and did their duty as warriors even when death was <br/>\ncertain. At the battle of lake Biwa a woman named Koman saved the Minamoto <br/>\nbanner from the Taira, swimming to shore with it in her teeth as arrows <br/>\nrained about her . In a battle between Yoshinaka and the Taira, a woman <br/>\nnamed Hangaku, daughter of Moritsuna, earned renown, and even more so in <br/>\n1201 when she defended her father&#39;s stockade with bow and naginata . <br/>\nAccording to Jones, the enemy so despaired of felling her that they resorted <br/>\nto shooting her in the back, &quot;a very un-Samurai act&quot; . The wife of Kajiwara <br/>\nGenda Kagesuya, Fujinoye, defended Takadachi Castle in 1189 and killed two <br/>\nfamous warriors, Yemeto Juro and Nagasawa Uyemen-taro in a duel . A naginata <br/>\nmaster named Itagaki was a female Taira general who commanded three thousand <br/>\nsoldiers in a suicide charge against ten thousand Hojo in 1199, an act which <br/>\nhas remained inspirational and maintained respect for her . Han Gaku fought <br/>\nin around 1200 (unsuccessfully) against the Kamakura Shogunate . She was <br/>\nsentenced to execution but saved when an enemy Samurai asked to marry her , <br/>\nshowing that martial valor did not lead the women to be perceived as <br/>\nmasculine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany Taira women also fought in the sea battle that decimated their clan. <br/>\nThe number adds credence to the suggestion that women fought most in <br/>\nsituations where there was the least hope of victory and survival. An <br/>\ninteresting detail of the history of that battle is that in possibly its <br/>\nmost famous incident, where a Minamoto archer shoot down a fan bearing a <br/>\ndesign of a red sun on white field (the origin of the national flag) , is <br/>\nthat the fan was hung by a teenaged girl in hakama , the split skirt still <br/>\nworn by martial artists. More actively involved was Tamaori Hime, Atsumori&#39;s <br/>\nwife, who fought on the beach with a naginata . Tenji-no-tsubone fought with <br/>\nSagami Goro  and Mochimitsu&#39;s mistress Sasaraye also fought; she is depicted <br/>\nsomewhat tragically in prints, wielding a naginata on a sinking ship . <br/>\nSalmondson claims that others fought but with somewhat less convincing <br/>\nevidence than she presents for the above cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be observed that many of the warrior women discussed bare the title <br/>\nor surname &quot;Gozen&quot;. According to Salmonson, &quot;Gozen&quot; was &quot;a title of high <br/>\nrespect given to many martial women&quot; . However the possession of the title <br/>\nby non-warriors shows that it was not isolated to them. The Heike Monogatari <br/>\nprovides a clue as to the title&#39;s origins. One of the first stories is that <br/>\nof Kiyomori (the great leader of the Taira) and two Shirabyoshi. Shirabyoshi <br/>\nwere dancers, the pre-runners of Geisha , and bore the title &quot;Gozen&quot;. These <br/>\ndancers had originally danced with a white dagger in their belt, although by <br/>\nmedieval times this had been discarded . Given that Samurai class women all <br/>\nhad a dagger, often presented as a wedding gift, with which to kill <br/>\nthemselves if necessary , perhaps &quot;Gozen&quot; is connected to the possession or <br/>\nuse of such a weapon. Tyler either equates it with the English title <br/>\n&quot;mistress&quot; or links it (by reverse association) to professional women <br/>\nstorytellers who related the tales of the warrior women , while towards the <br/>\nend of The Heike Monogatari appears a young boy very confusingly given the <br/>\ntitle Gozen .<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably much used in Japanese warfare (especially from the Sengoku era <br/>\nonward), although their use was dishonorable and consequently only <br/>\nsporadically recorded, were shinobi or ninja. The thirty-fourth Grand master <br/>\nof the Togakure Ryu, Dr. Hatsumi, writes that &quot;kunoichi or female ninja made <br/>\nup an important part of the historical ninja families and clans of Japan&quot; . <br/>\nKunoichi, while trained fully in fighting techniques, were also trained to <br/>\nmake the best use of &quot;their own unique features and strengths&quot; . He gives <br/>\nillustrations of bunches of flowers used to conceal daggers and tea kit bags <br/>\ncontaining explosives , and one can imagine any number of other advantages <br/>\nwomen may have had in concealment, not least in their otherwise restrictive <br/>\nlayers of bulky kimono. Because of her sex, enemies often overlooked &quot;her <br/>\npotential as a destructive adversary. Women in feudal Japan were often <br/>\nunderestimated in terms of their capabilities for power, and this permitted <br/>\nthe kunoichi...to gain easy access to the very center of the enemy <br/>\nstronghold&quot; .<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most famous kunoichi lived in the later half of the sixteenth century, <br/>\noutside the main scope of this paper, however she has been included because <br/>\nshe was not just a female ninja but also a kunoichi jonin, or the commander <br/>\nof a group of female ninja . Working for the Takeda family, she was the head <br/>\nof a miko (female Shinto shrine attendant) spy-ring: &quot;Chiyome gathered <br/>\norphaned and runaway girls...and trained them as miko vestal virgins while <br/>\nalso training them as kunoichi female ninja agents&quot; . She is so famous that <br/>\nshe even turns up in a children�s book by Mayer titled &quot;Women Warriors&quot; . <br/>\nNinja were outcastes, so the participation of women in shinobi activities <br/>\nshows that female martial prowess was not restricted to, or necessarily a <br/>\nproduct of, the Samurai class alone. In fact, Omi province was especially <br/>\nfamous from its strong peasant women such as Okane and Oiko , and there are <br/>\nstories of women brawlers and bandits also, such as Oroku and Omatsu <br/>\nrespectively .<br/>\n<br/>\nAn area of martial life where abilities were put to the test was revenge. <br/>\nRevenge was in medieval Japan �a solemn duty, both sanctioned and practiced <br/>\nat the highest levels of the Samurai class� . Not only was it a duty, but <br/>\n�its requirements were by no means confined to the male line of the family� <br/>\n. Women avengers include Hatsu-jo, who�s story is the basis of the kabuki <br/>\nplay Onoye Iwafuji (her victim was Tsubone Iwafuji) and Tora Gozen who aided <br/>\nthe Soga brothers  (The Soga brothers� revenge occurred during an incident <br/>\nwhich was initially thought to have killed Yoritomo  ). Revenge was also <br/>\npossible between women. Haru-jo, also the basis of a play, avenged an insult <br/>\nagainst her mistress that had caused her to commit suicide . The maid took <br/>\nher revenge with a sword against the noblewomen who had perpetrated the <br/>\ninsult .<br/>\n<br/>\nThe revenge story that is best documented is that of Miyagino and Shinobu, <br/>\nwhich occurred in the Edo period and is told in the kabuki play Gotai Eiki <br/>\nShiro Ishi Banashi  . They were daughters of a farmer who was murdered by a <br/>\nSamurai; further more Miyagino was a tayu, or courtesan of the highest <br/>\nstatus . The sisters ran away from their respective occupations and studied <br/>\nthe martial arts . In 1649 they formally asked their Daimyo to authorize the <br/>\nrevenge . The Samurai was still in service; he was summoned and the duel was <br/>\n�carried out in front of the approving daimyo and his senior retainers� <br/>\nMiyagino was armed with a naginata� which by the Edo Period had become the <br/>\ntraditional weapon for women. Shinobu wielded a kusari-gama� . Shinobu <br/>\nentangled their opponent�s sword in her chain while Miyagino finished him <br/>\noff . The combination of these weapons was very popular. Sono-jo and Kiku-jo <br/>\nalso avenged their father in an arraigned duel using these weapons . Revenge <br/>\nwas made illegal in 1873 .<br/>\n<br/>\nA female specific form of revenge was uwanari-uchi. This was the socially <br/>\nsanctioned custom (common in the Heian period) of a wife attacking a second <br/>\nwife, concubine or lover, usually by attacking her house . The rival had the <br/>\nright to defend herself and her property . Such attacks were not just <br/>\nmotivated by jealousy. Other reasons were to defend the succession of <br/>\nchildren  or the family of the first wife�s economic interests . At that <br/>\ntime the man joined the women�s family, not vice versa, and they supported <br/>\nhim economically . Although the custom continued until the sixteenth century <br/>\n, Masako�s command of a small army to destroy Lady Kame�s house  is the <br/>\nbest-known example.<br/>\n<br/>\nMasako�s husband was Yoritomo, who is considered a great example of a <br/>\nSamurai, and is acclaimed as the first Shogun and the man who unified Japan <br/>\nunder a central government. He was a hard man who executed many, including <br/>\nwomen, children and his own brothers. That is what makes it particularly <br/>\ninteresting that his wife repeatedly defied him, took armies to his <br/>\nmistresses and after his death took over government. Although not a warrior <br/>\nby conventional definition, Masako was an able general, and maintained the <br/>\nloyalty of the Samurai in preference to male leaders. Because of her <br/>\nsignificance, a brief biography in included.<br/>\n<br/>\nMasako Hojo was Yoritomo&#39;s wife, the daughter of his guardian as mentioned. <br/>\nHistorical and popular opinion has been divided on Masako, who is seen as <br/>\n&quot;either one of the most tragic or one of the most Machiavellian figures in <br/>\nJapanese history&quot; . Her family was quite insignificant, ruling only a small <br/>\narea, and although descended from the Taira the Hojo were not of <br/>\ndistinguished lineage . Masako was only three when the thirteen year-old <br/>\nYoritomo was exiled into the care of her father . Her mother had died when <br/>\nshe was young , and when she was twenty her father met and married a woman <br/>\nthe same age as her while on guard duty in Kyoto . On his return Masako and <br/>\nher stepmother Maki began an enmity which would eventually result in her <br/>\nfather�s disgrace and exile . At the same time her father, Tokimasa, also <br/>\ndiscovered that Masako and Yoritomo had begun a relationship .<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough some authors have maintained that Masako married Yoritomo because <br/>\nof political ambition, her father&#39;s reaction shows the foolishness of the <br/>\nidea. He was angry at the affair for good reason; Yoritomo was an exile with <br/>\nno prospects, an alliance with the Minamoto would seriously jeopardize the <br/>\nposition of the Hojo and not least Yoritomo had already fathered a child <br/>\nwith the daughter of another local lord of superior power to Tokimasa, and <br/>\nthis lord had killed the child to maintain good relations with the Taira . <br/>\nMasako and Yoritomo eloped .<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir first son, Yoriie, was born in 1181 . Yoritomo appointed the daughter <br/>\nof his own Menoto as Yoriie&#39;s . This was a great honor, as &quot;the family of <br/>\nhis nurse would stand to gain tremendous power and influence...the choice <br/>\nwould later prove to have been a poor one&quot; . The family spoilt the child and <br/>\ngrew &quot;arrogant in their assumption of power&quot; . Menoto relationships were <br/>\ncrucial, providing &quot;an undeniably influential force in Kamakura politics&quot; . <br/>\nMasako, coming from a provincial and unimportant family, had not experienced <br/>\nthis system . She was already raising her daughter , and as the eldest child <br/>\nhad probably raised her brothers after her mother&#39;s death. Her life and that <br/>\nof her family was radically changed, as she went from being the wife of an <br/>\nexile to the wife of the most powerful man in eastern Japan was . While she <br/>\nhad been pregnant Yoritomo had established a house for a mistress, Lady Kame <br/>\n. Under Masako&#39;s orders, a small army belonging to Masako&#39;s stepmother&#39;s <br/>\nbrother destroyed the house, although the mistress escaped . Yoritomo was <br/>\nfurious and snubbed his wife, resulting in the Hojo faction marching back to <br/>\nIzu . Unable to lose their support, Yoritomo was reconciled with Masako . <br/>\nThe importance of their marital harmony to politics and to the course of <br/>\nJapanese history seems bizarre in retrospect. This was the first incident of <br/>\nthe conflict which would continue throughout their marriage over the issue <br/>\nof Yoritomo&#39;s mistresses. It is also the most famous recorded incident of <br/>\nuwanari-uchi, the right of a first wife to defend her interests against <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoshinaka sent his eldest son Yoshitaka to Yoritomo, hoping to marry him to <br/>\nMasako&#39;s eldest child, Ohime . Masako and Ohime were pleased with the idea <br/>\nand continued to grow fonder of the boy over time, but Yoritomo considered <br/>\nhim a hostage . Keeping the example of his own life in mind, Yoritomo <br/>\ndecided to kill him . Masako and Ohime tried to help Yoshitaka escape, but <br/>\nthe plan failed and he was killed . Ohime became seriously ill in grief and <br/>\nthis caused another rift between Masako and Yoritomo . Another event which <br/>\npitted mother/daughter against Yoritomo was the sentencing of Shizuka. Both <br/>\nMasako and Ohime visited Shizuka while she was captive, and according to the <br/>\nAzuma Kagami Masako is supposed to have justified the woman&#39;s defiance to <br/>\nher husband after the dance, pointing out that she would have done the same <br/>\n. Ohime went further, offering to help Shizuka escape, an offer the dancer <br/>\nturned down as she was resolved to die . In 1194 Ohime&#39;s parents tried to <br/>\nmarry her to her cousin, but she refused and threatened suicide .<br/>\n<br/>\nOhime died in 1197 aged nineteen . In 1199 Yoritomo died . In the same year <br/>\nMasako&#39;s second daughter Sanman, aged fourteen, also died . Yoriie succeeded <br/>\nas Shogun, only to be assassinated in 1204 at the instigation of Masako&#39;s <br/>\nfather . His brother Sanetomo, who was a minor, replaced Yoriie . This gave <br/>\nrise to the position of regent for the Shogun, filled first by his <br/>\ngrandfather Tokimasa . The son of Yoriie, who was in turn killed by Masako�s <br/>\nyounger brother, the second Regent Hojo Yoshitoki, had purportedly <br/>\nassassinated Sanetomo in 1219 . This was the end of Yoritomo&#39;s line, and <br/>\nSanetomo was the last Minamoto Shogun . In the debate over who should <br/>\nsucceed Sanetomo, Masako and her father, apparently under the influence of <br/>\nhis wife, were pitted against each other, and Tokimasa was forced to retire <br/>\nby Masako and her brother Yoshitoki . Masako began<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;immediately putting the finishing touches to the organizational machinery <br/>\nof the Kamakura government which would assure the continued dominance of her <br/>\nown family, the Hojo, for more than a century to come&quot; .<br/>\n<br/>\nThe governmental system seems bizarre, even by medieval standards! <br/>\nFitzgerald describes it thus:<br/>\n&quot;There was now an Emperor, almost always a child: an ex-Emperor, his father, <br/>\nand often a senior ex-Emperor, who had more influence than the junior one. <br/>\nThen there was the Minamoto Shogun, now also often a child, and behind him, <br/>\nthe real power in the land, the Regent for the Shogun, always...[a] Hojo&quot; .<br/>\n<br/>\nIf possible, during Masako&#39;s lifetime it was even more complex, because she <br/>\nstood behind the Regent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn her political maneuvering, she worked with Kaneko no Fujiwara, also <br/>\ncalled Kyo no Tsubone, the menoto of Emperor Go-Toba, and who controlled all <br/>\ncourt appointments . According to Butler, contemporary sources refer to the <br/>\nwomen as &quot;the two women politicians of east and west&quot; and he claims that <br/>\nthey were &quot;two of the most powerful figures in Japan&quot; . Kaneko had received <br/>\nthe Junior Second Rank (equivalent to the rank of the Three Ministers) in <br/>\n1207, a tangible symbol of the influence she wielded at court . One could <br/>\nparallel the women with the Emperor and the Shogun, the men they <br/>\nmanipulated. Mulhern describes them in these terms: &quot;While Kaneko displayed <br/>\nthe quick wit and mastery of social stratagem highly valued in court <br/>\ncircles, Masako demonstrated the rugged pride of Bando warriors ...as well <br/>\nas their pragmatic attitude&quot; . The women had met in 1218 to find a successor <br/>\nfrom the Imperial family, a &quot;joint effort of these formidable women, both in <br/>\ntheir sixties&quot; . Keneko also arranged an award of the Junior Third Rank for <br/>\nMasako, who, having become a nun on her second son�s death , was the first <br/>\ntonsured person to receive court rank since the only other example in the <br/>\neighth century .<br/>\n<br/>\nHer successful tactical decisions in 1221 enhanced her reputation and her <br/>\npre-battle speech, maybe created by the authors of Azuma Kagami, shows her <br/>\nunderstanding of the warriors� mentality . It is not surprising that she was <br/>\nknown as Ama-Shogun, the Nun-General . According to Sansom, �hers was a <br/>\nsupreme example of a women�s rise to eminence, but it was by no means <br/>\nwithout parallel in early feudal Japan� . She died in 1225 . Dilts describes <br/>\nher rule glowingly as an era of justice and lower taxation . Her biography <br/>\nwould be almost unthinkable in the Japan of later years, certainly for a <br/>\nhero. She disobeyed her father, argued violently with her husband and went <br/>\nagainst his direct orders to try and save people he had condemned. After his <br/>\ndeath she took government and along with other politically capable women <br/>\nsuccessfully ran the country for the rest of her life. The Samurai preferred <br/>\nto be commanded by a woman rather than by her brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen were therefore significant actors in medieval Japanese history, not <br/>\nleast in the martial sphere. As Mulhern writes:<br/>\n�By no means isolated, unusual cases born of freakish twists of fate or <br/>\npreternatural strength, these are�women who exerted their influence on <br/>\nsociety, people, and nation far beyond the familial sphere. They are not <br/>\nheroes who happened to be female nor who renounced their female identity in <br/>\ndefiance to bravely enter the male domain in pursuit of success and power. <br/>\nRather, their feminine identity was an essential factor in most of their <br/>\ncontributions significant enough to alter or shape the course of Japan�s <br/>\nHistory� .<br/>\nWomen were pioneers in new lands alongside their husbands in the regions <br/>\nwhere the Samurai class developed. They fought in the wars which brought the <br/>\nascendancy of the Samurai class, and were political forces to be reckoned <br/>\nwith. The course of Samurai, and of Japanese, history would have been <br/>\nradically different had later standards regarding gender relations been <br/>\nrigorously applied in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Gempei War and aftermath could be seen as the last fling of active, <br/>\nparticipatory women in pre-modern Japan. The Heike Monogatari, the primary <br/>\nsource for the war, although �labeled as a war tale, described as a story of <br/>\nthe rise and fall of men, it is fundamentally a tale about women .  Although <br/>\nthere followed many other significant and powerful women, they became <br/>\nincreasingly the exception and isolated from one-another. Japanese Samurai <br/>\nclass women maintained their martial abilities and preparedness, but tended <br/>\nnot to take to the battlefield in such large numbers again. A notable <br/>\nexception is the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, which saw a regiment of naginata <br/>\nwielding women pitted against the Imperial Army�s artillery . Writing in <br/>\n1899, Bacon relates discovering a military uniform, complete with spear <br/>\ncover, among the clothes of a Japanese Lady . It was explained to her that <br/>\nthey were a vital part of the wardrobe of any Lady, to be used in defense of <br/>\nthe premises if necessary in the absence of the men . Another nineteenth <br/>\ncentury traveler records a Samurai women showing off her sword. The Lady <br/>\nexplained that all high-ranking women wore them for self-defense, calling an <br/>\nattendant to attack her daughter in example . Her defense was so energetic <br/>\nthat the retainer was �very glad when she cried out �Enough�� . These <br/>\nexamples, and the two million women who continue to study the naginata , <br/>\nshow that the martial legacy of women such a Tomoe lives on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppendix A<br/>\nSources<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the mono-linguistic restrictions of the author, it is impossible <br/>\nto verify the accuracy of information all of which is based on primary <br/>\nsources in Japanese, and most unavailable in translation.  In compensation, <br/>\ncare has been taken that the sources listed in the bibliography are of <br/>\nscholarly standard. Nearly all of the authors are/were professors at <br/>\ninternationally acclaimed Universities, and the validity of those without <br/>\nacademic credentials is assured by virtue of their citation in other of the <br/>\nsources whose authors do posses them. An example of this is Salmondson, a <br/>\ncentral source but not an academic one. She is cited in many of the other <br/>\nworks, and her reliance on Mary Beard, an acclaimed author, from whose work <br/>\n&quot;Women Who Shaped Japan&quot; most of the stories come (I was sadly unable to <br/>\nobtain a copy of this work as it has been out of print for some time), lends <br/>\nher legitimacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the authors are male, and while this does not necessarily mean that <br/>\nthey neglect the agency of women when discussing Japanese history, in this <br/>\ninstance it seems to be the case. The few female authors, such as Dilts, <br/>\nshow women to have been far more significant when narrating the same events. <br/>\nThe approach of many authors may be guessed at when Turnbull, the <br/>\npre-eminent authority on Samurai history in English language sources and <br/>\nwidely acclaimed for his Japanese works, can write a statement such as &quot;the <br/>\nonly &#39;female warrior&#39; in the whole of Samurai history - Tomoe Gozen&quot; . There <br/>\nare, of course, many explanations for this. Military history is not a field <br/>\nwhich attracts many women and since &#39;women&#39;s history&#39; became a separate <br/>\ncategory those not concerned with it have more justification in neglecting <br/>\nto mention women. The Japanese sources themselves provide little information <br/>\non those women who are mentioned, making it difficult to discuss them <br/>\nconfidently in an historical work without specifically researching them. <br/>\nTherefore the focus must be somewhat sociological rather than strictly <br/>\nhistorical. All Japanese names are given in the western format to save <br/>\nconfusion, that is, surname last.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppendix B<br/>\nHistorical Background<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the medieval age was �a time of considerable disintegration and <br/>\nwarfare, it also saw great economic, social, and cultural changes� . The <br/>\nperiod between the Heian and Kamakura eras is significant because the Gempei <br/>\nWar was the crucible in which the Samurai, as they are known today, were <br/>\nformed. It replaced the aesthetic court of The Tale of Genji with Shogunal, <br/>\nmilitary government which continued in various forms until 1868 . War often <br/>\ndefines or alters societal boundaries. Likewise �Japanese history provides <br/>\nstriking examples of how changes in the status of women can be linked with <br/>\nother broad socioeconomic trends� . The following summery of the period <br/>\nillustrates some of these changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rise of the great houses, the Taira and the Minamoto, occurred against <br/>\nthe background of the Fujiwara court dominance. The Fujiwara had modelled <br/>\ntheir government on the Chinese (T�ang) model . Life at court was also <br/>\nmodelled on the Chinese example, even, as Dilts point out, when it was far <br/>\nfrom practical . Maintaining the court�s life-style was very expensive and <br/>\nplaced an almost impossible burden of taxation on the peasants . From the <br/>\nlate eighth century onwards �aristocrats and princes with no prospects in <br/>\nthe Fujiwara dominated capital left to seek their fortunes in the outlying <br/>\nregions� . As part of the Fujiwara policy of allotting large portions of <br/>\nland to simplify tax collection, provincial territories were allotted to <br/>\nthese nobles, who were often younger or less favoured sons of Emperors . <br/>\nBecause of their more immediate presence and lower taxation demands (because <br/>\nthey no longer had to maintain an expensive court life-style), many peasants <br/>\nchose to place themselves under the protection of the provincial lords <br/>\nrather than the Fujiwara . These lords became powerful, rich and the centre <br/>\nof significant military forces . The Fujiwara used these forces rather than <br/>\nchallenging them .<br/>\n<br/>\nThe courtiers, having turned to more aesthetic pursuits, were unwilling to <br/>\naccept a Shogunal commission, so the rural lords were �the men upon whom <br/>\nfell the task of maintaining law and order� . In land wars against the Ainu <br/>\nand sea battles with pirates, professional, hereditary soldiers (the <br/>\nforbearers of the Samurai) emerged, in the service of local lords and not <br/>\nthe court . The most powerful of the military clans who emerged from this <br/>\nbackground were the Minamoto (who gained territory from the Ainu) and the <br/>\nTaira (who fought pirates on the inland sea and coast) . Eventually the <br/>\nclans gained a sense of their own power and importance  and inevitably the <br/>\nday came when they were called in to settle a court dispute . This battle is <br/>\nknown as the Hogen Incident , and occurred in July of 1156 . The conflict <br/>\nwas not strictly divided along clan lines, with a significant Minamoto named <br/>\nYoshitomo and others supporting the Taira, and vice versa , but the Taira <br/>\nfamily was the clear victor .<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Minamoto retaliated in 1160 led by Yoshitomo and his sons ; he had not <br/>\nbeen successful in court politics and moreover had been obliged to execute <br/>\nis own father, which was particularly difficult given the cultural emphasis <br/>\non filial piety . This was termed the Heiji incident , and again resulted in <br/>\ndefeat of the Minamoto, who were subject to �a savage series of executions� <br/>\n. Of Yoshitomo�s nine sons , all who were considered adults were executed , <br/>\nleaving thirteen year-old Yoritomo (who had fought beside his father) and <br/>\nthree younger half-brothers who escaped with their mother before being <br/>\ndramatically captured . The younger boys were sent to different monasteries  <br/>\nwhile Yoritomo was exiled into the custody of a Taira ally . By 1164 �there <br/>\nwas but one adult Minamoto left alive� .<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1180 this survivor, then seventy-four, led an insurrection which was the <br/>\nopening conflict of the Gempei war . It was not a widespread rebellion and <br/>\nwas crushed by the Taira . However, because of the support that the warrior <br/>\nmonks of Buddhist temples had lent the Minamoto, the Taira forces indulged <br/>\nin a vengeful rampage against the monasteries . In one burning, 3, 500 <br/>\npeople of all ages and both genders were killed .  The Taira leader <br/>\nKiyomori, Yoshitomo�s old enemy, also ordered that Yoritomo be executed . <br/>\nWith the support of his custodian, whose daughter he had married, Yoritomo <br/>\nkilled the local Deputy Governor and raised the Minamoto banner, to which <br/>\nsupporters flocked . On the ninth of November 1180, the massed armies of the <br/>\ngreat houses faced each other for the first time since the war began, and <br/>\nthe Taira fled in the night .<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the following years two other Minamoto played pivotal roles. The first <br/>\nwas Yoritomo�s cousin, Yoshinaka. A great general, Yoshinaka and his <br/>\nsupporters formed the third power-bloc (between the Taira and Yoritomo�s <br/>\nsupporters) in Japan by 1181 . A series of natural disasters interrupted the <br/>\nwar until mid 1182, and popular resentment was directed at the monk-slaying <br/>\nTaira . As soon as action resumed, Yoshinaka rapidly expanded his territory <br/>\nuntil he was only forty miles from Kyoto, the capital . To face him, the <br/>\nTaira press-ganged a huge army, which, however, �was probably deserting <br/>\nfaster than it was marching� . Yoshinaka defeated this army in a victory <br/>\nwhich marked the turning point of the war . He took the capital and the <br/>\nTaira escaped with most of the Royal Family and the Imperial Regalia .<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second man mentioned was Yoshitsune, Yoritomo�s brother. He was the <br/>\nyoungest child of Yoshitomo, having been born the year his father died . <br/>\nYoshitsune was an exceptionally gifted general; in fact, he won most of <br/>\nYoritomo�s battles for him. His first mission from his brother was to <br/>\neliminate the rival Minamoto, Yoshinaka . When that was done, Yoshitsune was <br/>\nsent after the Taira . On April twenty-fifth 1185 the last battle took place <br/>\nat sea, resulting in �the most tragic mass suicide in the history of the <br/>\nSamurai� by the Taira and the Royal Family . After their defeat, �the name <br/>\nof the Taira disappeared from Japanese history. No other victory in the <br/>\nstory of the Samurai was so complete and so decisive� .<br/>\n<br/>\nYoritomo established a hereditary military dictatorship with the title <br/>\nShogun, and removed government to Kamakura . There he established the first <br/>\ncentral government of unified Japan, called the Bakufu (tent government), <br/>\nand �the institutions of Japanese feudalism derive in a great part from his <br/>\nwork� . As reward for his contribution, Yoshitsune was hunted down and <br/>\nbeheaded . In 1193 Yoritomo also had killed his last remaining brother . <br/>\nHaving eliminated all competition, in 1199 he fell off his horse and died . <br/>\nAfter such promising beginnings, �within thirty years of the founding of the <br/>\nKamakura Shogunate the third and last Minamoto Shogun had been assassinated, <br/>\nand his place taken by the Hojo� .  Thus the outcasts of the Heian court and <br/>\nthe warriors who gathered around them became the rulers of Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nBibliography<br/>\n<br/>\nBacon, A., Japanese Girls and Women, Boston: The Riverside Press, 1899.<br/>\n<br/>\nBenneville, J.
