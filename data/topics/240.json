In some respects the Ryoma book was<br/>\neasier to read than Jansens book. Instead of writing a &#39;novel&#39; he should<br/>\nhave just wrote a straight history. I would have been more pleased with<br/>\nthat. Same for the Samurai Sketches. All in all anybody who likes samurai<br/>\nwould like these books. Yes he did overuse the word snicker. Guess he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t afford a decent thesaurus.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong the lines of samurai historical fiction have you read the new<br/>\ntranslation of Shiba Ryotaros Drunk as a Lord. Now there is a true author. I<br/>\nhighly recommend that one.
