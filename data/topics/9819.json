In this case, the change of BUKE had been attributed mainly to the change of economy .    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In the interim of Edo Bakufu days, the economy had been changed gradually to Money oriented economy , Commodity oriented economy from longcontinued Feudal economy .   And so , Buke were forced to be poorer and poorer as a result of the fact that BUKE got only registered income from BAKUFU , but<br/>\n Merchants had began to be richer and richer.<br/>\n  In order to get more income , BUKE got impose heavier tax on Farmers, facing to the poverty of BUKE.   so sever, resulting in Farmers riots against such heavier tax imposed by BUKE.<br/>\n  On the top of that , BUKE borrowed more loan from Merchants and BUKE soon  became in a position not be able to return loan to them.   And at the end of Edo Bakufu days, Bakufu lost power to get back the social order to be ruined to be transformed to new Meiji Government.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Facing to the change, Meiji Government issued public bonds and gave to BUKE to sell and become capitalist newly , or BUKE newly were assigned to be Governors under the new constitutes.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As I pointed out earlier,  the main reason why BUKE were forced to be changed to other ranks was the change of economy. <br/>\n   <br/>\n    By the way,  what part of England are living ?

Roman Legions did not vanish: the quality of the army was diluted until the Western Empire fell to the barbarian tribes; the Vikings enjoyed much power until the black death arrived in Norway in 13th century, only for the few to survive to be conquered by Danes and Swedes. The class of &quot;Knights&quot; continued, but ceased to be a major force on the battlefield (perhaps think of the samurai after the Tokogawa shogunite). Longbows are weaponary, and would have become obsolete when there was something better, cheaper and easier to train mass infantry, i.e powder and lead to use Marx&#39;s terms. Same with cavalry. when armoured vehicles could be produced more reliably, quicker and cheaply, horses, cavalry ceased to be an important force on the battlefield. Just look at the first great war, most nations use cavalry (think of Lawerence of Arabia), but the second great war, scarcly a horse is photographed in the entire campaign. Soldiers and ruins? I think poor leadership leads to ruins - not soldiers per se.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards T.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1467106521\">! ruin !  is mis-spelling.   Reign, or  Rule  is collect.  Sorry about this.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  You pointed out very reasoble things and comprehensive .  I  agree to that without no argument.<br/>\n  However,  before Meiji new Government which you pointed out came out  in Japan which ,  something had already been happened in Edo era society.  Let me explain as follows;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Considering Buke days for about 1,200 years,  the final stage for them was end of Edo era.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n   At the first stage when Yeyas Tokugawa, shogun,  opened Government ( Bakufu ) through  200 years after that , which was 1860 AC  , feudalism had been followed  and Buke had been safety.  After 200 years warriors days ,  all Japanese enjoyed peasful life for long times.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   However,  from the interim of Edo era onward already,  the seed of problem to maintain Buke rank had been born,  which was  the reason , the cause of the change from  feudalism  to money oriented society,  or commodity oriented society and which triggered the situation Buke rank was unable to<br/>\n live without having put more heavier land tax to peasants .   Furthermore, the export of textiles, or foods , etc from Japan to overseas had been increasing, which brought more demand for those things and the prices had hiked so much , triggering more poverty to Buke.    And the peasants formed<br/>\n their own army and raised riots in everywhere.   Edo government tried to settle those riots, but they could not solved completely.    On the contrary,  the merchants had become  richier and richier  , getting more power.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Buke had been finally facing to the poverty  and formed  hostility groups against Edo  Gernment because Edo Gernment could not help Buke.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  At that time,  some new thinkers came out who stressed liberalism and said Japan shoud be reigned by the capable man not only by Buke, no matter what ranks were, which tried to change from feudalism to new world implying  new government under new power..  Under these circumstrances, new power<br/>\n organised by  Chosu  and  Satsuma,  lower Buke rank ,  formed new government called Meiji .<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Due to the influence by the change of economic matters such as feudalism economic to capitalism finally,  Buke was forced to give up their rank  and many buke families were forced to sell their lands or assets to rich merchants or, new Meiji Government  and  finally had becom  peasants,  or, <br/>\n business man  by  investing money to company newly established under  Meiji  Government.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So ,  please remember the seed of problem to bring the change to new world was born already inside the current , old structure,  long time before  next new structure.   Like cancer, the seed of cancer is born before come out to surface, visibility .    Economic matters  are the key factors to<br/>\n change the structure.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Eddie<br/>\n<br/>\nJL Badgley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tatsushu@...\">tatsushu@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          On Sat, Nov 8, 2008 at 9:05 PM, yoshiyuki hiramoto<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eddiehiramoto@...\">eddiehiramoto@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, at the end of Tokugawa , Edo era, Buke had been vanished<br/>\n&gt; completely and disappeared .
