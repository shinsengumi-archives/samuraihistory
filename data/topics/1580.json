            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1478253626\">I find it very doubtful.  I finally got myself a copy of the &#39;Koyo <br/>\nGunkan&#39; - I have the book &#39;legends of the Samurai&#39;, and I found it in <br/>\nthe bibliography and ordered it off Amazon.co.jp (Koyo Gunkan, Edited <br/>\nand translated into modern Japanese by Yukata Yoshida).  It has both <br/>\nthe original text and the modern japanese &#39;translation&#39;.  I can&#39;t <br/>\nhope to read the original text, but the &#39;modern&#39; japanese version <br/>\nsays: &quot;Ato de kikeba, kono Musha koso Terutora de atta to iu.&quot;  That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sound too convincing to me.  Here is a translation I did from <br/>\nanother book, &quot;Sengoku Bushou Omoshiro Jiten&quot;, Naramoto Tatsuya, 1998:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is the same famous scene from books and movies; The warrior in <br/>\nthe white cowl is Kenshin, and Shingen&#39;s warfan bore eight sword <br/>\ncuts.  However, there are historical records that have been <br/>\ndiscovered that dispute this personal combat.  It is the &#39;Kenshin <br/>\nNenpu&#39; (Kenshin Chronological Record), which states Arakawa Izu no <br/>\nKami rides at Shingen, shingen cant draw his sword and instead blocks <br/>\nwith his fan, and Hara Oosumi no Kami steps forward with a spear and <br/>\nstrikes at the rider, missing him but hitting the horse, startling <br/>\nit.  The rider fled&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt goes on to say:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In short, it is thought that the man that Shingen fought at <br/>\nKawanakajima was Kenshin&#39;s kagemusha, Arakawa Izu no Kami.  Also, <br/>\naccording to the &quot;Hokuetsu Gunki&quot;, Shingen recieved a visit from a <br/>\nmonk by the name of Tenkai who would later become and advisor to <br/>\nIeyasu, and he told him that &quot;the man who crossed swords with Kenshin <br/>\nwas not me, but someone who looks like/resembles me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Shingen said that it was his Kagemusha that fought with Kenshin, <br/>\nnot himself.  Therefore, there is also the possiblity that they were <br/>\nBOTH kagemusha.  Kenshin and Shingen were both worthy opponents who <br/>\nhad never seen eachother&#39;s face.  That may have also added to the <br/>\nconfusion as well.  Although the personal combat between Kenshin and <br/>\nShingen is recorded in the Koyo Gunkan, however in truth, there isn&#39;t <br/>\nany evidence to support this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on the above, you have to wonder if Kenshin and Shingen ever <br/>\nreally DID fight...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Atisi Kazuari&quot; <br/>\n&lt;broccolihead30@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I bid you all greetings, I have just arrived but I will just into <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; present question without delay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of the research I have done in the fields of War, politcial, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>milatary <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and cultural history of Japan there is very little dispute that it <br/>\n&gt; was in fact Kenshin, some sources even have him named Kagetoura, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; indeed they did meet though, face to face only that once. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope that was of some help, though it may not have been as <br/>\n&gt; discriptive as it could have been<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Atsi </span></blockquote></div>",
