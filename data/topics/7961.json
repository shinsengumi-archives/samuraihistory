It is derived from the Hindu religious swastika, but it is not identical in meaning. <br/>\nThe Manji is made up of several elements- a vertical axis representing the joining of heaven and earth, a horizontal axis representing the connection of yin and yang, and the four arms, representing movement- the whirling force created by the interaction of these elements.<br/>\nWhen facing left, it is the Omote (front facing) Manji, representing love and mercy. Facing right, it represents strength and intelligence, and is called the Ura (rear facing) Manji. <br/>\nIn Zen Buddhism, the Manji represents the ideal harmony between love and intellect.&quot;<br/>\n     I found it interesting that even though the manji is not the wheel of Dharma, it still represents part of the concept. The manji also seemingly has different meanings for different Japanese sects (which really shouldn&#39;t surprise me, but does).</div>",

This looks like it may in fact be older (40 or 50 years) but<br/>\nsomeone has clearly gussied up the scabbard and etched the blade (hence the<br/>\nvery visible striations). The tsuba looks like a charcoal brick because it<br/>\nhas been burnt, likely in an attempt to age it artificially.
