            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-768421584\">Am trying to assess sources available in English on the Japanese sword, and <br/>\nwe are not sitting high in the cotton here.  The only really available book is  <br/>\nJohn M.  Yumoto,  The Japanese Sword:  A Handbook, Tuttle,  1958,  which has <br/>\nundergone many reprintings.  Unfortunately,  Yumoto&#39;s  book is very <br/>\nshort---191 pages.  His terminology is obscure.  The only explicit mention of  tachi is <br/>\nin the Glossary on page 184:  well at least he got it in somewhere,  right?   <br/>\nQuote is &quot;a tachi  [is]  an ancient slung sword housed in a jindachi <br/>\nmounting.&quot;  Now that is like saying Julius Caesar lived in Rome, nothing else!  If you <br/>\ndelve into the text [!],  you find mention of the Koto [Old Sword]  period on <br/>\npage 27;  Yumoto says the period lasted from 900 to 1530 [AD].  On page 28,  <br/>\n&quot;swords which had a cutting edge of four feet or more were often employed.&quot;  I <br/>\nassume that,  based on what Tom Helm has written, this is our friend Mr. <br/>\nTachi-san.  On page 47-8,  Yumoto writes: &quot;in this period the sword was worn <br/>\nsuspended from the hip by cords which passed through two rings on the scabbard <br/>\n(Plates 7 and 8).  The best part of The Japanese Sword is the extensive number of <br/>\nplates.  The prettiest of the illustrations are those of the tsuba, the <br/>\nelegantly wrought hand guards that adorned the swords.  That reminds me of the pal <br/>\nwho used to play the tsuba in my high school band--he didn&#39;t get much music out <br/>\nof it, but it was pretty to look at.   As My Ichiban, My Significant Other <br/>\n[SO],  would proclaim now,  &quot;self slap!&quot;  And I would deserve it,  too,  Ollie.  <br/>\nLater and greater,  Prof.  Murphy,  The Japan Foundation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
