I mean look at Hideyori...<br/>\nhe was spoiled his whole life! Hideyoshi, on the other hand, had nothing<br/>\nwhen he started out and had no choice but to use his cunning and charisma to<br/>\ngain his fame and fortune. Hideyori had it all to begin with, and doting<br/>\nparents to boot. Maybe if he had started out in more abject circumstances he<br/>\nmay have developed some true leadership abilities. He lived too much of a<br/>\nprotected life, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also the fact One, Hideyoshi&#39;s wife, was unable to bear children.<br/>\nOkay fine, the Taiko ended up sleeping around a lot, but if One was even<br/>\nhalf as fertile as Maeda Toshiie&#39;s wife... *chuckles* In any case, one of<br/>\nthe biggest failings of inheriting power by blood is that talent doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily pass on through genes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Korean invasion was a horrible idea, I agree. The Japanese history<br/>\nvolumes by (forgot first name) Samson -- they&#39;re a three volume set that<br/>\npeople here have recommended before as a good summary and starting point for<br/>\nresearch -- speculate that Hideyoshi may have gone mad as he aged, maybe due<br/>\nto a degenerative disorder of the brain. Of course, I&#39;m not ruling out that<br/>\nhe was just plain drunk on his successes and figured, &quot;Hey, if it worked<br/>\nwith Japan, it&#39;s got to work with mainland China!&quot; *snorts*<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just a bit biased towards Hideyoshi myself because, out of all<br/>\nthe figures of Japanese history, his story has always been the most<br/>\nawe-inspiring to me personally. In my opinion, only an exceptional<br/>\nindividual could have transcended his class and rise up to become the<br/>\nde-facto ruler of all Japan, even if that rule never continued past his<br/>\ngeneration.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Siren Sally<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://darksiren.net\">http://darksiren.net</a> </span></blockquote></div>",

If <br/>\nNobunaga hadn&#39;t happened, he may well have sided with the Takeda, <br/>\nand what odds on a Shingen/Ieyasu alliance unifying Japan? Of <br/>\ncourse, the same scenario may have played out after Shingen&#39;s death <br/>\nwith Katsuyori in place of Hideyori.<br/>\n<br/>\nHideyoshi&#39;s failing seems to have been that of a cult of <br/>\npersonality - a great deal of the loyalty that he acquired was to <br/>\nhimself personally rather than to his family, which unravelled with <br/>\nsurprising quickness after his death (helped in no small way by <br/>\nMitsunari&#39;s incompetance).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s one outsider I sometimes speculate on - the Shimazu. They <br/>\nachieved the conquest of Kyushu, but didn&#39;t have enough time to <br/>\nconsolidate their victories. They were well served by loyal <br/>\nretainers, and in Yoshihisa, Yoshihiro and Iehisa had some of the <br/>\nfinest generals of the time. The previous shogunate had been built <br/>\non a Kyushu power base, so if the Shimazu had been able to <br/>\nconsolidate their gains, could they have been the ones to unify <br/>\nJapan?</div>",

This may include<br/>\ngenius in warefare, administration or simply how successful they were. <br/>\nI know Ieyasu was the eventual unifier of Japan but is that simply<br/>\nbecause of his superiority over the other two leaders or because of<br/>\ntheir unfortunate circumstances, i.e. Nobunaga dying untimely at the<br/>\nhands of his vassal and Hideyoshi having no family name or title able to<br/>\nbe passed on etc? Likewise how much was Ieyasu&#39;s success in creating the<br/>\nTokugawa Shogunate owed to the previous two sengoku jidai leaders?<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie Carroll</div>",
