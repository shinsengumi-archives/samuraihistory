She goes on to speculate about how some real-life ronin &quot;avenged&quot;<br/>\nTsugumo Hanshiro (the main character, played by Nakadai)&#39;s death a few<br/>\ncenturies later when Ii Naosuke was assasinated.<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever... as a historian, Joan Mellen really needs to stick to<br/>\nmovie-critiquing. I&#39;ve also read about the assasination of Ii Naosuke and it<br/>\nhas absolutely nothing about poor, impoverished ronin rising up against the<br/>\nrich ruling class. Not at all. The assasination was done by some<br/>\nanti-Tokugawa pro-Emperor forces who wished to enforce their motto of<br/>\n&quot;Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians&quot; (&quot;Sonno-Joi&quot;). These<br/>\nanti-Tokugawa forces were exponents of keeping a strict feudalism, they just<br/>\nthought that the Tokugawas, in wanting to open up the country for trade,<br/>\nweren&#39;t being strict enough in being feudal. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe only forces in the bakumatsu wars who wanted to bring any sort of<br/>\ndemocracy to the common people (which would include poor, starving ronin)<br/>\nwas Sakamoto Ryoma. Who I find to be one of the most fascinating people of<br/>\nthe bakumatsu era. He and his forces were not at all involved in the<br/>\nassassination of Ii Naosuke as far as I know. <br/>\n <br/>\nAn aside on cinema: in the new Criterion release of SEPPUKU (&quot;HaraKiri&quot;)<br/>\nJoan Mellen has an essay included. I think she learned her lesson and her<br/>\nnew essay has no references to the assassination of Ii Naosuke.<br/>\n <br/>\nNina <br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Randy Schadel<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 11:11 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Ii Clan (was RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3)The Ii were accused (in the person of Ii Naosuke) of being too <br/>\nstrict and cruel in dealing with anti-government factions during the <br/>\nBakumatsu era (about 230 years after the time period Hara-kiri was <br/>\nset in). This formed the basis for the events in the film Samurai <br/>\nAssassination. Personally, I&#39;ve always felt it was a bum rap. Naosuke <br/>\nwas trying his best to bring Japan into the modern era while still <br/>\nkeeping its national identity, but the many factions pulling in <br/>\ndifferent directions made it a near impossible job. This helped to <br/>\ngive the Ii clan a `bad guy&#39; image.<br/>\nI&#39;ve always found the story of Ii Naomasa fascinating. It reads like <br/>\na movie. His father was murdered when Naomasa was a child, leaving <br/>\nhim the last of his clan. He was sheltered, protected, and brought to <br/>\nadulthood by his aunt, a Buddhist nun who assumed the leadership of <br/>\nthe clan and brooked no nonsense during his childhood (sometimes even <br/>\ndressing as a man to command the respect of those she had to deal <br/>\nwith). He became one of the `4 Pillars Of Tokugawa&#39; (in most <br/>\nreckonings) and received the wound that eventually killed him while <br/>\nengaged in battle with one of the few clans that were the martial <br/>\nequals of the Ii (the Shimazu). Interestingly enough, Tokugawa Ieyasu <br/>\nblamed that famous suit of armor for being the cause of the wound.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a>&gt; <br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a>&gt; <br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\nSamurai<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+swords&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Sam\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+swords&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Sam</a><br/>\nurai+part&c=2&s=38&.sig=i-aS2VqspDvuosjyLvkOEQ&gt; swords \tSamurai<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+part&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Samur\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+part&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Samur</a><br/>\nai+part&c=2&s=38&.sig=p5v93HNycsLUTd-IlYGqOA&gt; part \t<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-747589511\">I&#39;m not aware of any specific instances in which the Ii treated a <br/>\nronin (or anyone else) in an unnecessarily harsh manner. The reason <br/>\nthe screenwriter chose the Ii clan could have been a combination of <br/>\nseveral factors:<br/>\n1)The empty suit of armor in Hara-kiri is one of the most important <br/>\nsymbols in the film. The Ii clan red suits of armor were among the <br/>\nmost distinctive and famous in Japan, particularly Naomasa&#39;s horned <br/>\nsuit (presumably the one featured in the film) and made a perfect <br/>\ncinematic fit. It was also interesting that they chose to use the <br/>\nincorrect Ii hatch mark standard (only used in wartime, it was the <br/>\nfirst character of their name) rather than the peacetime Tachibana <br/>\n(flower) standard on the large screen in the courtyard. Thus, when <br/>\nthe screen is covered in blood from a fallen Ii retainer, the good <br/>\nname of the Ii has also been symbolically stained with blood.<br/>\n2)The Ii were renowned for their zeal and steadfastness both in <br/>\nbattle (seen when disobeying orders to be the first into battle at <br/>\nSekigahara, and using their orders to keep the besieged Osaka castle <br/>\nunder control as an excuse to bombard the castle) and in supporting <br/>\nthe Tokugawa (`the establishment&#39;). This made them perfect for being <br/>\nthe symbol of the `unfair powers that be&#39;.<br/>\n3)The Ii were accused (in the person of Ii Naosuke) of being too <br/>\nstrict and cruel in dealing with anti-government factions during the <br/>\nBakumatsu era (about 230 years after the time period Hara-kiri was <br/>\nset in). This formed the basis for the events in the film Samurai <br/>\nAssassination. Personally, I&#39;ve always felt it was a bum rap. Naosuke <br/>\nwas trying his best to bring Japan into the modern era while still <br/>\nkeeping its national identity, but the many factions pulling in <br/>\ndifferent directions made it a near impossible job. This helped to <br/>\ngive the Ii clan a `bad guy&#39; image.<br/>\nI&#39;ve always found the story of Ii Naomasa fascinating. It reads like <br/>\na movie. His father was murdered when Naomasa was a child, leaving <br/>\nhim the last of his clan. He was sheltered, protected, and brought to <br/>\nadulthood by his aunt, a Buddhist nun who assumed the leadership of <br/>\nthe clan and brooked no nonsense during his childhood (sometimes even <br/>\ndressing as a man to command the respect of those she had to deal <br/>\nwith). He became one of the `4 Pillars Of Tokugawa&#39; (in most <br/>\nreckonings) and received the wound that eventually killed him while <br/>\nengaged in battle with one of the few clans that were the martial <br/>\nequals of the Ii (the Shimazu). Interestingly enough, Tokugawa Ieyasu <br/>\nblamed that famous suit of armor for being the cause of the wound.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1843063236\">Great points. What is &quot;sadism&quot; according to our modern sensabilties (which<br/>\ninclude all sorts of acceptable sadisms of our own)? And what is a proper,<br/>\nappropriate response to an action seen as being an outrage within the<br/>\ncontext of 17th century samurai ethics?<br/>\n <br/>\nThe following is all speculative, as this is a list discussing samurai<br/>\nhistory and not a list where we discuss Japanese cinema. However, reading<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve read, and drawing a few speculative conclusions (which might be<br/>\nwrong): I would not be at all surprised to see that an account existed at<br/>\none time in a clan&#39;s logbook about a begging ronin who had bamboo swords<br/>\nbeing forced to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. So I will<br/>\ncontinue my discussion as one of possible history and not as a discussion<br/>\nabout a film. <br/>\n <br/>\nPut yourself in the viewpoint of a 17th century clansmen (hanshi). You serve<br/>\nyour clan and lord faithfully. The wars are over, still you wish to uphold<br/>\nthe code of bushido (which by the way had NOT been recorded as a &quot;how to&quot;<br/>\nofficial manual). Some ragged fellow wearing two swords and who speaks the<br/>\nlanguage of a man of the samurai class appears at your clan gate. He tells<br/>\nthe oft-repeated story about how he&#39;s a ronin who is so poor he wants to<br/>\ncommit seppuku in a corner of your clan&#39;s back yard. How many times have you<br/>\nheard this sad tale before? <br/>\n <br/>\nFast foward a bit to modern times. Many of us, at least in the U.S. (and<br/>\nprobably in other countries) have seen the ragged folk on the corners with<br/>\nsigns &quot;will work for food.&quot; But when some of these folks are approached to<br/>\nactually do some work, they give excuses. And it turns out that they don&#39;t<br/>\nwant a job, they want a handout. <br/>\n <br/>\nBack to 17th century Edo in Japan. You, the loyal hanshi, invite the poor<br/>\nguy in and relate to your superiors this sad tale that he bears. Does he<br/>\nreally want to commit seppuku or is he just looking for a handout? You<br/>\ndecide that it doesn&#39;t matter, that your clan stands for upholding samurai<br/>\nhonor and a samurai must be taken at his word. So he will commit seppuku, as<br/>\nhe has stated that he wishes to do. <br/>\n <br/>\nThen somewhere along the line, you and your fellow clansmen discover that<br/>\nthe ragged ronin was carrying bamboo sword blades. This brings a whole<br/>\ndifferent issue to the fore. Because as a loyal samurai and hanshi, you have<br/>\nlearned all of your life that &quot;The Sword Is The Soul of the Samurai.&quot; And<br/>\nyes, this idea of the sword, as opposed to other weapons, being so important<br/>\nto fighting samurai was largely not true in earlier times of Japanese<br/>\nhistory. But by the time of the peaceful Edo period, this idea had become<br/>\nalmost &quot;gospel.&quot; So in this particular time, the sword is supposed to be the<br/>\n&quot;living soul&quot; of the samurai.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo this ronin has commited an outrage by having sold his sword blades and<br/>\nhiding his shame by carrying replacement blades of bamboo -- which would be<br/>\ntotally useless in a real fight. Why did he do it? To feed his starving<br/>\nfamily? Because he needed the money for more sake or opium? Who knows? And<br/>\naccording to our 17th century hanshi and his colleagues -- who cares? In<br/>\neffect, the man has sold his soul. And must be punished simply for that. But<br/>\non top of it, he claims to want to participate in the sacred ritual of<br/>\nseppuku. And doesn&#39;t possess the means for doing so.  It&#39;s clear that the<br/>\nlying wretch is trying to extort the clan for a handout and has no intention<br/>\nto commit seppuku. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo you and your colleagues decide to take a stand for Bushido. Not only<br/>\nforce this guy to commit seppuku, but force him to use his own sword to do<br/>\nit. What a way to send a message that the code of Bushido isn&#39;t dead, even<br/>\nthough it has taken a battering in recent, peaceful times. <br/>\n <br/>\nBack a bit to the fictional account written by Takiguchi Yasuhiko (which<br/>\nlater became the film, SEPPUKU). In these works, the account of the bamboo<br/>\nsword seppuku becomes public record, and there is no protest against this.<br/>\nSo unless the accounts of these events were vivid figments of Takiguchi&#39;s<br/>\nover-active imagination, it can be logically speculated that this act by a<br/>\nclan, which some of us here and now consider an act of sadism, was<br/>\nconsidered acceptable within the context of the society where it happened.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHistory is full of atrocities that occured that were considered acceptable<br/>\nwithin the context of the times where they took place. It&#39;s chilling. Not a<br/>\npleasant subject; it seems easier for a lot of us to wander off in<br/>\nspeculations about how noble the samurai were and always have been. Not so. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo why am I drawn to this whole speculation? I&#39;m working on a piece of<br/>\nhistorical fiction where one of the characters, an impoverished 18th century<br/>\nronin, has pawned his swords and has replaced them with bamboo blades. And<br/>\nmust deal with the consequences of that action. He doesn&#39;t try and gain<br/>\nmoney by claiming to want to commit seppuku. Still, he runs into harrowing<br/>\nchoices and events. And I get to ruminate in the issue of what really<br/>\nconstitutes a &quot;soul&quot; and whether or not it might be encased in a sword. And<br/>\nalso run head-on into other issues that go beyond 18th century Japan. <br/>\n <br/>\nAgain, my two mon. Which has turned into a few ryo. Perhaps useless<br/>\nramblings.<br/>\n <br/>\nNina <br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Thomas Davidson<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 8:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Ii Clan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Nina,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Concerning the Ii clan ...

These men were largely warriors without a<br/>\nwar, so they looked at other means to demonstrate their prowess, and<br/>\none means was to ensure that others stuck to the code. If I insist you<br/>\ncommit seppuku, it&#39;s because I would in your situation. Whether this<br/>\nis actually true or not is another matter, but as long as you&#39;re not<br/>\nput to the test, then no-one will ever know...<br/>\n<br/>\nSeppuku, and a close relation junshi (the practice of retainers<br/>\nkilling themselves upon the death of their lord) assumed an importance<br/>\nout of all reasonable proportion in peacetime. With no-one out to kill<br/>\nme, the next best way to show my worth is to kill myself. Junshi was<br/>\nrarely practiced in earlier eras, and was frowned upon if not<br/>\nexpressly forbidden by the authorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier and more violent eras were a lot more pragmatic. &quot;He who<br/>\nfights and runs away,&quot; as the saying goes, and if every samurai lived<br/>\nby the post-Edo ideal then none of them would have survived their<br/>\ninevitable reverses in fortune. Life might be ephemeral, but it was<br/>\nprecious, and the martial ryu taught that to throw one&#39;s life away was<br/>\na waste, and stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me illustrate with a true tale of the peacetime samurai: two men<br/>\npass on the stairs of Edo Castle. As they do, the sheaths of their<br/>\nswords accidentally clash. This was considered an insult beyond repair<br/>\n(it was a technique used to start a fight, a show of disrespect of the<br/>\nother person). Fighting in the castle was prohibited, but &#39;samurai<br/>\nhonour&#39; demands instant redress of insult (notably the author of The<br/>\nHagakure considered the loyal 47 ronin to be despicable for waiting so<br/>\nlong. They sould have acted that very day, and been killed to a man),<br/>\nso what happens, &quot;I&#39;ll show you the kind of man I am!&quot; shouts one,<br/>\ndraws his sword and kills himself, there on the stairs. The other is<br/>\nhorrified, he races on, delivers the message, returns, &quot;how dare you<br/>\nact in such a way as to imply my dishonour!&quot; and, you guessed it, he<br/>\ndraws his sword and kills himself, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn extreme case, I grant you, but a telling one. Two lives lost for<br/>\nwhat? Injured pride.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that the Ii officials knew this fellow was looking for<br/>\n&#39;go away&#39; money, but also saw there was some fun to be had ...<br/>\nundoubtedly there were sadistic b*st*rds around, our unfortunate<br/>\nfellow just happened to run into one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a tale of a thousand match contest in the Muto Ryu (founded<br/>\nby Tesshu, a swordsman of great renown) where the fencer has to fight<br/>\na thousand matches over a 3-day period. Few have done it, but one man<br/>\ndid, and on the third day, still a long way short of his mark, he was<br/>\nchallenged by a man whom he knew delighted in nothing more than<br/>\ninjuring his opponents in a fencing match. Our hero (who by this stage<br/>\nwas in such a pass that he later recorded he was passing blood in his<br/>\nurine) squared his shoulders, and stepped forward. Master Tesshu, who<br/>\nknew both men, saw this and stopped the bout, declaring our hero the<br/>\nvictor not only of the match, but of the total challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short I would declare the attitude you highlight a psychological<br/>\nsickness not unknown in the military, where some feel the need to<br/>\nprove their prowess at every turn, but have no valid means of so doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the UK I remember there was some furore over the activities of the<br/>\nParachute Regiment (an elite unit) that might be considered along the<br/>\nsame lines, who went through a period of picking fights with regular<br/>\narmy units stationed nearby. I know of one guy in a very elite unit<br/>\nwho would never drink in a pub if there were other members of his own<br/>\nunit present, as there was sure to be a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a man thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n(If I appear to be hard on the samurai, I am harder on the Tokugawa<br/>\nShogunate, who continually demonstrated an inability to get to grips<br/>\nwith these issues, and fudged things miserably at times. To my very<br/>\nlimited knowledge, it seems the authorities invariably fudged things<br/>\nterribly when it came to matters of seppuku and samurai discipline in<br/>\ngeneral.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",

I just got the new<br/>\nCriterion release and it&#39;s great, with all the interviews in it.<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, now I do want to get into some actual history. Concerning the Ii<br/>\nclan. I know that they wore red armor and that there is a story about them<br/>\nfrom their earlier days of glory. Apparently, during one of the battles<br/>\n(forget which one), one of their generals stationed some strong men at the<br/>\nrear, to prevent anyone from deserting even in the midst of a hard-fought<br/>\nbattle. Some stern stuff here.<br/>\n <br/>\n***SPOILER ALERT for those who haven&#39;t yet seen the film and don&#39;t wish to<br/>\nknow what happens.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs I was watching SEPPUKU (the western title is &quot;Hara Kiri&quot;). In the course<br/>\nof the film, a ragged, destitute ronin shows up at the gate of the Ii clan&#39;s<br/>\nEdo headquarters, presumably to request a place to commit seppuku so that he<br/>\nno longer would have to live in dire poverty. But in reality, he is in<br/>\ndesperate need for money to get a doctor for his sick child, so he is making<br/>\nthis request in the hope that the Ii clan members will feel sorry for him.<br/>\nThat they will give him money to go away -- and with the money, he can get<br/>\naid for his sick son. <br/>\n <br/>\nInstead, the Ii clan members insist that he actually commit seppuku. The<br/>\nronin is so destitute that he has pawned his swords and is wearing blades of<br/>\nbamboo. When the clan members find this out, they are outraged and decide to<br/>\nforce him to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Which he does in<br/>\ngreat agony. Later on, his father-in-law (Nakadai) seeks to avenge this<br/>\ndeath and people can watch the film to see what happens.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut in actual history: I was wondering: during the 17th century, did the<br/>\nhistorical Ii clan actually have any tendencies toward the type of sadism<br/>\nthat the film shows them to have? According to the film, the bamboo seppuku<br/>\nwas a matter of public record (the revenge for this is what is covered up by<br/>\nthe clan officials).  It was considered to be an appropriate punishment for<br/>\na begging ronin who came to request seppuku but had sold his blades (&quot;the<br/>\nsoul of the samurai&quot;), so he only had blades of bamboo.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve heard vaguely from a few others that there was a real history of<br/>\ndestitute ronin appearing at clan gates to presumably request a spot for<br/>\nseppuku -- but who actually wanted &quot;go away&quot; money. Is there any history of<br/>\nanyone ever being forced to commit seppuku with a bamboo blade? Was the Ii<br/>\nclan ever involved in any of this sort of thing? <br/>\n <br/>\nOr did the novelist Takiguchi Yasuhiko, who wrote the original story<br/>\nSEPPUKU, make up all of this out of thin air and his fertile imagination? If<br/>\nTakiguchi made up all of this, why would he use a real clan, the Ii clan,<br/>\nfor his scenario? Why not use a fictional clan? <br/>\n <br/>\nJust curious.
