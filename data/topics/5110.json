            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-289763906\">Kyle et al-<br/>\n\tI have to say I liked this considerably better than the earlier <br/>\nexcerpt (apologies to Lillith). This is my favorite area of Japanese <br/>\nhistory so I may be too harsh a critic.  &quot;Restaurant&quot;, &quot;waitress&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;bathroom&quot; are all too modern and invoke the &quot;groan&quot; and  catapult the <br/>\nreader back into his world rather than keep him in yours. &quot;Public <br/>\nHouse&quot;, &quot;Tea room&quot; or even &quot;eatery&quot; might work better, as would <br/>\n&quot;servant-girl&quot; and &quot;outhouse&quot; (privy). If it is 1854 then the language <br/>\nyou use should invoke the 1850&#39;s, since we are close enough in time <br/>\nthat most readers know what it should sound like (as opposed to the <br/>\n1550&quot;s).<br/>\n\t A single sailor strolls into a bar? All joking aside, in 1854 it is <br/>\nunlikely that Commodore Perry would have allowed any of the men of his <br/>\ncommand this kind of casual contact. Servant girls didn&#39;t hang around <br/>\nthe table and &quot;unn&quot; was likely all the thanks she expected to receive. <br/>\nDomo Arigato-doitashimashite are again too modern, and jolt the reader <br/>\nout of the story. I think a samurai of these times would not call <br/>\nhimself a &quot;samurai&quot; but rather &quot;Bushi&quot;, if he has a good command of <br/>\nEnglish then &quot;warrior.&quot; However if he is giving Japanese lessons he <br/>\nshould say &quot;Bakufu&quot;,  I do not think he would have command of words <br/>\nlike &quot;Shogunate&quot; which is afterall an English word.<br/>\n\tMono Kenshu? Okinawans have funky names true, but farming samurai from <br/>\nOkinawa? Satsuma. Yes, I don&#39;t buy Okinawa. Josiah Louis, Joseph Louis, <br/>\nJebediah Louis I could accept, &quot;Joe&quot; again sounds too modern. I also <br/>\nwonder how open-minded a working class white male from the American <br/>\nSouth of the 1850&#39;s might be toward Asians and their culture. If he <br/>\nwere black he wouldn&#39;t be walking around with an interpreter and if he <br/>\nwere important enough to be granted an interpreter he would likely not <br/>\nbe strolling into a pub. And what about the interpreter!?! What does he <br/>\ninterpret? When the Samurai speaks, is it his English we hear or is <br/>\nthat the interpreter?<br/>\n\tI know I am picking nits here, so don&#39;t take me too seriously. Alot of <br/>\nmy questions/concerns could easily be answered by the tale that is <br/>\nabout to unfold. Tom Cruise movies aside this is certainly a period and <br/>\nplace in history that is ripe for literary and theatrical dramatization <br/>\nand I for one am all for it.<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\nPS- I feel that the US was looking to beat the Europeans to Pacific <br/>\nWhaling to replace that lost in the Atlantic which was &quot;overfished&quot;, <br/>\ncoaling stations in Japan were vital to that effort, &quot;trade and amity&quot; <br/>\nwere the sugar-coating used to sell the idea of open ports to Japan...</div>",

Now you&#39;ve got me drinking it, too! <br/>\nYeah, sure, order me some of that. It&#39;s good, right?&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Very good,&quot; the translator nodded. He turned to the waiting <br/>\nwaitress, ordering some of the wine. Turning back to the sailor, he <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Bathroom,&quot; and then walked off.<br/>\n\tThe waitress came over, putting the wine and two cups down. <br/>\nThe sailor glanced up, saying, &quot;Thank you.&quot; When the waitress gave <br/>\nhim a blank, confused look, he quickly realized his error. &quot;Ah sheh <br/>\nsheh?&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;That is Chinese,&quot; a gruff voice came from behind the <br/>\nsailor. An important looking man with a long and short sword tied to <br/>\nhis waist came up and sat down across from him. He wore odd pants, <br/>\nalmost a cross between trousers and a skirt, along with a flowing <br/>\nrobe covered by a simple, stiff-sleeved jacket. His hair was shaved <br/>\nfrom his forehead to the top, and the back was tied into an odd-<br/>\nlooking ponytail that sat atop his head. &quot;Say, `Arigato&#39;,&quot; he <br/>\ninstructed the sailor.<br/>\n\t&quot;Oh.&quot; The sailor turned to the waitress. &quot;Arigato,&quot; he said <br/>\nto her.<br/>\n\tSmiling at the sailor with the realization of what he&#39;d been <br/>\ntrying to say, she bowed, saying &quot;Do itashimashite,&quot; and walked off.<br/>\n\t&quot;You are American,&quot; the Japanese man said.<br/>\n\t&quot;And you&#39;re Nipponese,&quot; the sailor commented dryly.<br/>\n\t&quot;I am samurai,&quot; the Japanese replied, a slight indignation <br/>\nin his voice. &quot;You are with the black ships.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Black ships?&quot; the sailor asked. &quot;Oh, yeah. I&#39;m with the <br/>\nblack ships.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;May I ask you a question?&quot; The samurai asked.<br/>\n\t&quot;Sure, shoot,&quot; the sailor said, pouring some sake into a cup.<br/>\n\t&quot;Why is it so important to America that Japan open up?&quot; the <br/>\nsamurai asked. &quot;I spoke to a Chinese man. He claimed that America is <br/>\nthe land of gold.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Yeah, we got gold,&quot; the sailor said. He swallowed the sake <br/>\nhard. A split second passed, and his eyes went wide and he gagged.<br/>\n\t&quot;You drink sake too fast,&quot; the samurai said, slight <br/>\namusement showing in his eyes. &quot;Sip sake.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Sip it, right&quot; the sailor said, nodding his head, his face <br/>\nstill red with discomfort.<br/>\n\t&quot;So, if America is a land of gold, why does America care <br/>\nabout Japan? What do we have that you could want?&quot; the samurai asked.<br/>\n\t&quot;Well, this sake isn&#39;t all that bad,&quot; the sailor said, <br/>\nsipping a little.<br/>\n\t&quot;You want sake?&quot; the samurai said, bewildered.<br/>\n\t&quot;Sorry, that was a joke,&quot; the sailor said. &quot;You Nipponese <br/>\nneed to get out more.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;We like how we are,&quot; the samurai said. &quot;We do not want to <br/>\nget out more.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;But don&#39;t you want to trade? China opened its borders and <br/>\nnow it trades a lot,&quot; the sailor said.<br/>\n\t&quot;What good is trade?&quot; the samurai asked. &quot;China belongs to <br/>\nBarbarians now. They are ruined by Opium; they have lost everything <br/>\nfor trade.&quot;<br/>\n\tThe sailor stopped and thought. &quot;To be honest, I can&#39;t give <br/>\nyou a straight answer. I&#39;m just a sailor.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;I see.&quot; Samurai nodded. &quot;Here in Japan, men like you are in <br/>\ncharge.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Men like me?&quot; the sailor asked, daring to take another sip <br/>\nof his sake.<br/>\n\t&quot;Warriors,&quot; the samurai said. &quot;Bushi.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;We chose who&#39;s in charge,&quot; the sailor said, pausing to take <br/>\nanother sip, &quot;in America. All the people, that is,&quot; he added.<br/>\n\t&quot;All the people?&quot; the samurai asked, confused.<br/>\n\t&quot;Every four years, we all vote on some people who want to <br/>\nrun our country, and whoever gets the most votes, they run it for <br/>\nfour years until we vote again,&quot; the sailor said. &quot;At least, I think <br/>\nthat&#39;s how it works.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Here, in Japan, a member of the Tokugawa house runs the <br/>\ncountry,&quot; the samurai explained.<br/>\n\t&quot;Like a king,&quot; the sailor nodded. &quot;We used to be like that. <br/>\nBut then we had a revolution.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;A revolution?&quot; the samurai asked, confused.<br/>\n\t&quot;Yeah,&quot; the sailor said. He paused, sighed, and took another <br/>\nsip of the sake. It was quickly becoming apparent that this would <br/>\nnever be his drink of choice. &quot;A bunch of farmers got together and <br/>\nbeat back the British.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;That happened here,&quot; the samurai said. &quot;But the farmers <br/>\nlost.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Well,&quot; the sailor shrugged, not sure what to say. He took <br/>\nanother sip of his sake, and refilled his cup.<br/>\n\t&quot;Do you think we will have a revolution here?&quot; the samurai <br/>\nasked the sailor. &quot;It has been peaceful for so long.&quot;<br/>\n\tThe sailor shrugged. &quot;Up to you Nipponese, I guess.&quot;<br/>\n\tThe samurai nodded. &quot;My son, he has two children. They were <br/>\nborn three years ago. I hope that there will be no revolution, or <br/>\nelse they will have to fight it.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;So you&#39;re a grandfather, huh?&quot; the sailor asked, glancing <br/>\nat him, a little surprised. &quot;You sure look young.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Samurai are warriors meant for war, but my family has been <br/>\nhappy farming in Okinawa for the last one hundred and seventy five <br/>\nyears. I do not think that should change for my grandchildren,&quot; the <br/>\nsamurai continued.<br/>\n\t&quot;So you guys have done nothing but fight for the last couple <br/>\nhundred years?&quot; the sailor asked, confused. &quot;Who do you fight?&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Rival daimyo used to fight,&quot; the samurai explained. &quot;Long <br/>\nago. But since the Tokugawa clan came out on top, there has been <br/>\npeace for over two hundred and fifty years.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Daimyo?&quot; the sailor asked. &quot;I don&#39;t know what that means.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;They are the generals, the lords of the land,&quot; the samurai <br/>\nexplained. &quot;We samurai would swear allegiance to them in battle.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Well, if you haven&#39;t been fighting for so long, what have <br/>\nyou been doing?&quot; the sailor wondered.<br/>\n\t&quot;We have been many things,&quot; the samurai said. &quot;Mostly we <br/>\nhave been keeping the peace. The Shogunate rewards us for that.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Shogunate? You mean your king?&quot; the sailor questioned.<br/>\n\t&quot;The person who runs our country is called Seii tai shogun, <br/>\nor just Shogun,&quot; the samurai replied. &quot;His government is called the <br/>\nShogunate, or the Bakufu.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Too many names,&quot; the sailor said, shaking his head. He <br/>\nglanced at the swords tied to the samurai&#39;s waist. &quot;What about <br/>\nthose? Why do you still have swords? And why two?&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;This is called a daisho,&quot; the samurai said, reaching down <br/>\nand gripping the longer of the two swords. &quot;It is our right, our <br/>\nduty to wear these swords. No one else may wear them.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;But don&#39;t you have guns?&quot; the sailor continued. &quot;We stopped <br/>\nusing swords I think before we even made my country.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;We have guns,&quot; the samurai said. &quot;My sons and I are good <br/>\nmarksmen. But our swords and spears are still useful.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Spears, too?&quot; the sailor gave him an inquisitive look. &quot;You <br/>\nguys are behind on the times a little.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;We use swords as a symbol more than as a weapon,&quot; the <br/>\nsamurai explained. &quot;They are our soul. Our guns are saved for the <br/>\nfields, and the spears are good for cavalry.&quot;<br/>\n\t&quot;Ever seen a gun like this?&quot; the sailor asked, reaching <br/>\nbehind him. However, he was interrupted as his interpreter returned. <br/>\nThe man paid his respects to the samurai, then turned to the sailor.<br/>\n\t&quot;We must go,&quot; he said.<br/>\n\tThe sailor sighed, getting up and paying for the sake.<br/>\n\t&quot;Have the rest, if you like,&quot; he offered the samurai, <br/>\npushing the unused cup towards him.<br/>\n\t&quot;Wait,&quot; the samurai said, getting up. &quot;Times are about to <br/>\nchange, I know it.&quot; He took the short sword from his side, handing <br/>\nit to the sailor. &quot;When you go back to America, to trade with us, <br/>\nkeep this. It will be our first trade.&quot;<br/>\n\tThe sailor blinked in surprise at the short sword. &quot;This for <br/>\nsome bad wine? Well, I don&#39;t know anything about this thing, but I <br/>\ncan guess it&#39;s not a fair trade.&quot; He reached behind him, pulling out <br/>\na brand new level action pistol Smith and Wesson. &quot;Here,&quot; he said, <br/>\nhanding it to the samurai. &quot;No offense to your swords and all that, <br/>\nbut I bet you&#39;ll find this more useful.&quot;<br/>\n\tThe samurai took it and looked it over. He bowed deeply. &quot;My <br/>\nname is Mono Kenshu, from Okinawa, in Satsuma.&quot;<br/>\n\tThe sailor gave an awkward return bow. &quot;I&#39;m Joe Lewis, from <br/>\nLouisiana,&quot; he said, turning and walking out with his interpreter.<br/>\n--</div>",
