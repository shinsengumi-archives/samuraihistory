            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1979271262\">Hello ANTHONY J. BRYANT (TONY),<br/>\n  My question was about the lasing of the lames for all parts of the samurai armour. I would like to know if you have any more diagrams, tips, or info. on how to lase the armour together so I better understasnd it. I looked at hundreds of different suits of armour and now that i&#39;ve picked out what kind I want to make, i just need to understand the construction process better. I&#39;m trying to make a battle ready suit of samurai armour. I&#39;m not going to have it on display or anything like that. I&#39;m trying to get into the re- enactment stuff so i need it strong and very durable. Also, is titanium a good metal to use for the lames or should i stick with stainless steel? And, what thickness of steel and leather backing should i use for the backing? Do i harden the leather? Whats the best way to attach leather, cloth, and lames together. I would gladly send you money for any shipping charges if you could put together some info. and send it to me. Hope to here from you soon.<br/>\n                                                       Thanks for your time,<br/>\n                                                           Mark <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Anthony J.

Also, if you go to<br/>\nwww.samurai-archives.com and go to the messageboard<br/>\nthere (it&#39;s a delphi forum), I know there are several<br/>\npeople on the board who have used Tony&#39;s site as a<br/>\nbasis for their armor making, and they could probably<br/>\nhelp you. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
