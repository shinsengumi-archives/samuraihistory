I know when 2 samurai battled, they<br/>\n  did this by riding out to mid field, stating their<br/>\n  &gt;name and lineage, then attaching. How would this be stated?<br/>\n  &gt;&quot;I am Sanematsu Yoshihide of the clan Minamoto from the Satsuma<br/>\n  Provinces---(now I&#39;m lost. Does he say en guard<br/>\n  &gt;or what?? Or is this anywhere near what he&#39;d say?&quot;)<br/>\n  &gt;Thanks in advance<br/>\n  &gt;Kay Swanson w/a Kei Swanson<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the war tales like the Heike Monogatari and the Taiheiki are to be<br/>\n  believed, then a samurai might ride ahead of the army, announce his name<br/>\n  and pedigree, and challenge someone from the opposing army to attack<br/>\n  him. One example from Helen Craig McCullough&#39;s translation of the<br/>\n  Taiheiki, where two warriors race ahead of their own army to be first in<br/>\n  to battle:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We are the lay monk Hitomi Shiro On&#39;a, aged seventy-two, a resident of<br/>\n  the province of Musashi, and Homma Kuro Sukesada, aged thirty-six, a<br/>\n  resident of the province of Sagami, who since leaving Kamakura have been<br/>\n  resolved to perish in battle ahead of our comrades! Let those who are<br/>\n  self-confident come forth to observe the degree of our skill!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Challenges like this were an attempt to earn recognition on the<br/>\n  battlefield, which was the best way for a samurai to be rewarded for his<br/>\n  service. If the samurai died the rewards earned by his valour would be<br/>\n  passed on to his family, which was the intent of the two warriors above.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Acts like this would likely have been far more usual in Kamakura &<br/>\n  Muromachi (12th through 15th C.) times when armies were smaller and<br/>\n  battles more intimate than in Sengoku times when armies consisted mainly<br/>\n  of ashigaru foot soldiers acting in mass formations.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -AngusH </span></blockquote></div>",

One example from Helen Craig McCullough&#39;s translation of the<br/>\nTaiheiki, where two warriors race ahead of their own army to be first in<br/>\nto battle:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;We are the lay monk Hitomi Shiro On&#39;a, aged seventy-two, a resident of<br/>\nthe province of Musashi, and Homma Kuro Sukesada, aged thirty-six, a<br/>\nresident of the province of Sagami, who since leaving Kamakura have been<br/>\nresolved to perish in battle ahead of our comrades! Let those who are<br/>\nself-confident come forth to observe the degree of our skill!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nChallenges like this were an attempt to earn recognition on the<br/>\nbattlefield, which was the best way for a samurai to be rewarded for his<br/>\nservice. If the samurai died the rewards earned by his valour would be<br/>\npassed on to his family, which was the intent of the two warriors above.<br/>\n <br/>\nActs like this would likely have been far more usual in Kamakura &<br/>\nMuromachi (12th through 15th C.) times when armies were smaller and<br/>\nbattles more intimate than in Sengoku times when armies consisted mainly<br/>\nof ashigaru foot soldiers acting in mass formations.<br/>\n <br/>\n-AngusH<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
