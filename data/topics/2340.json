A samurai is depicted shooting a <br/>\nmatchlock pistol  in a painting by the famed artist Kuniyoshi  Utagawa  <br/>\n(1797-1861).  One is clearly shown firing such a pistol  in an illustration from the  <br/>\nBudo Geijutsu hiden sue in the library of the National Diet (Parliament) in <br/>\nTokyo.  Furthermore, an actual specimen is displayed in the Victoria and Albert <br/>\nMuseum in London.  Cheers,  Prof John F.
