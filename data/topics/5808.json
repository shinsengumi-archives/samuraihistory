This information is also on the &#39;newcomers must read&#39; <br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis honor was ultimately, oh, what&#39;s the word.... starts with a &#39;p&#39;, I think.....    distorted  anyway,  the concept of &#39;shame&#39; <br/>\ngradually became the over-riding concept.  Japan was also badly humiliated in WW2. Since that time, he said, the drive to achieve, <br/>\nto excel, to be the best has become almost psychotic.. There is so much competition for places in schools, then in jobs, that a <br/>\nsingle failing mark can spell a lifetime at a lower economic level.  There is so much stress, and emphasis on the shame of defeat, <br/>\nthat these children are taught that it is weak to admit any sort of frailty, of fear, of differing opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne can see traces of this pressure in our own society, and indeed, the world.  We are ever pushed, and push each other, to <br/>\naccomplish more, earn more, drive faster, kill each other more efficiently...... the list just goes on and on and on.....<br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized &#39;The Last Samurai&#39; was not about Algren, that he was merely a story vehicle.  Many historians, aficionados, re-enactors <br/>\nand others were outraged at the lack of authenticity.  But, the director and producer made no such claim to authenticity.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;To know life in every breath&#39; is not the mindset of a person who seeks death.  It is the mindset of a person who knows that death <br/>\nmay take him at any time, and sees the world with a clarity of mind heightened and appreciative of the Present.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis phenomenal state of mind is experienced to some degree by every person who has had a life-threatening experience.  It is <br/>\nexperienced more acutely by those who experience combat,  police, fire, and rescue personnel,  indeed anyone who consciously chooses <br/>\nthis way of life has contemplated the potential consequences.  It is also why some people become adrenaline junkies, because it is a <br/>\nvery real high.....  an organic high, produced by ones own hormones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might start a flame here, but it is my niggling thought once in awhile, that even our revered Miyamoto Musashi was perhaps not a <br/>\nvery stable person, formidable though he was, even without a weapon in hand. Even if he was rock solid psychologically, perhaps his <br/>\ncommunication skills were wanting. Perhaps, as in many languages, errors in translations of his works and intent have occurred.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, or at least I choose to think, he was trying to say that if we live in the Present, and choose our actions according to our <br/>\nhonor, that path may lead to death: so be it, if that is our destiny.  But, in pursuit of our path, we must also notice, appreciate, <br/>\nand revere that which around us is Life.  It is so tentative, that to lose a moment of it is wasteful.   One cannot Live if one is <br/>\nalready Dead; one cannot know Death without having Lived.  I definitely don&#39;t think his was a shame-based way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fictional Katsumoto died with his honor intact for he would not compromise his principles, nor allow the possibility of the <br/>\nsmarmy Omura to take him prisoner for further humiliation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is, to me, a distinct difference from the seppuku of shame, of despair, or correct me if I use the wrong work, the sempuku of <br/>\nrevenge. Way different mindset.  The contrast is stark.<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nOkey-dokey, fire at will ----- launch arrows---- sharpen your swords ---- but I want to say that I mean no disrespect, that I choose <br/>\nto view the &#39;code&#39; as a positive path of honor and it has served me well.  I wanted to present perhaps another point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nRizii<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Kitsuno<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Article: Samurai cult or social evil in suicides<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2003 movie &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; has left a deep impression of Japan<br/>\nin the Western world. The namesake last samurai is not Nathan Algren,<br/>\nplayed by Tom Cruise, but Katsumoto, played by the Japanese actor Ken<br/>\nWatanabe. The last samurai is a perfect figure who makes the American<br/>\nborn again as a samurai. The climax of the movie is the samurai&#39;s<br/>\nsuicide. Killing himself with his own sword in the fluttering cherry<br/>\nblossoms, Katsumoto&#39;s last word is &quot;perfect.&quot; He was talking about<br/>\nthe beauty of the cherry blossom rain and the equally splendid ending<br/>\nof a samurai&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n We cannot<br/>\nrule out the suspicion that the suicides were &quot;social homicides,&quot; a<br/>\nlast, belated call for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe writer is the JoongAng Ilbo&#39;s London correspondent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nby Oh Byung-sang &lt;obsang@...&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://joongangdaily.joins.com/200410/15/20041015220713733990009080908<br/>\n1.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com<br/>\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives<br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1370707081\">Samurai cult or social evil in suicides<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2003 movie &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; has left a deep impression of Japan <br/>\nin the Western world. The namesake last samurai is not Nathan Algren, <br/>\nplayed by Tom Cruise, but Katsumoto, played by the Japanese actor Ken <br/>\nWatanabe. The last samurai is a perfect figure who makes the American <br/>\nborn again as a samurai. The climax of the movie is the samurai&#39;s <br/>\nsuicide. Killing himself with his own sword in the fluttering cherry <br/>\nblossoms, Katsumoto&#39;s last word is &quot;perfect.&quot; He was talking about <br/>\nthe beauty of the cherry blossom rain and the equally splendid ending <br/>\nof a samurai&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe theme of &quot;Chushingura,&quot; a classic Japanese revenge story, is &quot;the <br/>\nbest of flowers is the cherry blossom and the best of men is a <br/>\nsamurai.&quot; Chushingura is based on a historical event about the <br/>\nrevenge of 47 samurai 300 years ago. A lord was wrongfully accused <br/>\nand forced to commit seppuku, a form of suicide in which the victim <br/>\ndisembowels himself. As revenge for their master, 47 retainers bided <br/>\ntheir time and attacked the foe on a snowy winter night. They offered <br/>\nthe head of the foe at the grave of their master and committed <br/>\nseppuku together. The story of Chushingura is an eternal bestseller <br/>\nin Japan, having been revisited by numerous novels, plays, movies and <br/>\ntelevision series.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe recent group suicide of nine Japanese shocked Westerners. Youths <br/>\nmet on the Internet and planned their deaths. Westerners argued that <br/>\nthe samurai tradition, death as honor, lived on because there was no <br/>\nreligion in Japan that respected the value of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to World Health Organization statistics, the suicide rate <br/>\nper 100,000 is 24.1 in Japan, compared to 10.4 in the United States <br/>\nand 7.5 in Great Britain. Last year, 24 Koreans per 100,000 killed <br/>\nthemselves. When five youngsters met on the Internet and committed a <br/>\ngroup suicide in March, suicide Web site became a social concern. <br/>\nLast year, the suicide rate in the age group 61 and above grew <br/>\nrapidly, largely because of financial difficulties, and made up 28 <br/>\npercent of the total suicides. In the last five years, there have <br/>\nbeen 340 suicides in the military.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe high suicide rate is exceptional; Korea has no tradition of <br/>\nidealizing death and religions that value life prevail. We cannot <br/>\nrule out the suspicion that the suicides were &quot;social homicides,&quot; a <br/>\nlast, belated call for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe writer is the JoongAng Ilbo&#39;s London correspondent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nby Oh Byung-sang &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:obsang@...\">obsang@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joongangdaily.joins.com/200410/15/20041015220713733990009080908\">http://joongangdaily.joins.com/200410/15/20041015220713733990009080908</a><br/>\n1.html</div>",
