I&#39;m new here, just for the purpose of some light research. <br/>\n<br/>\nCould anyone help me find a Samurai by the following description: <br/>\n<br/>\n  - Lived before 1750<br/>\n  - Was the major hero / contributor to the DEFENSE of a particular <br/>\n    village / household etc. <br/>\n  - Basically, if he disappeared just before a certain time, a lot of <br/>\n    people would be in trouble without him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are aware of this certain Samurai who saved the village / <br/>\nhousehold, and feel like educating me, any information you wish to <br/>\nprovide would be very helpful. Terminology, names, place, times, etc. <br/>\nwould all be helpful as well. However, I realize that I am asking for <br/>\none of probably a thousand needles in a haystack, so if you just <br/>\nprovide a Samurai&#39;s name, that would be a huge help all by itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much. <br/>\n<br/>\nMickey</div>",
