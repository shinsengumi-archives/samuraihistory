            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-967331671\">This is an excerpt from a letter written by Will Adams in 1611 that I <br/>\njust came across, pretty interesting:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It was agreed that we should leave the coast of Peru and direct our <br/>\ncourse for Japan, having understood that cloth was good merchandise <br/>\nthere and also how upon that coast of Peru the king&#39;s ships were out <br/>\nseeking us, having knowledge of our being there, understanding that <br/>\nwe were weak of men, which was certain, for one of our fleet for <br/>\nhunger was forced to seek relief at the enemies&#39; hands in Saint Ago. <br/>\nSo we stood away directly for Japan, and passed the equinoctial line <br/>\ntogether, until we came in twenty-eight degrees to the northward of <br/>\nthe line, in which latitude we were about the twenty-third of <br/>\nFebruary, 1600. We had a wondrous storm of wind as ever I was in, <br/>\nwith much rain, in which storm we lost our consort, whereof we were <br/>\nvery sorry. Nevertheless with hope that in Japan we should meet the <br/>\none the other, we proceeded on our former intention for Japan, and in <br/>\nthe height of thirty degrees sought the northernmost cape of the fore-<br/>\nnamed island, but found it not by reason that it lay false in all <br/>\ncards and maps and globes; for the cape lies in thirty-five degrees <br/>\nand one half, which is a great difference. In the end, in thirty-two <br/>\ndegrees and one half we came in sight of the land, being the <br/>\nnineteenth day of April. So that between the Cape of St. Maria and <br/>\nJapan we were four months and twenty-two days; at which time there <br/>\nwere no more than six besides myself that could stand upon his feet. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we in safety let fall our anchor about a league from a place <br/>\ncalled Bungo. At which time came to us many boats and we suffered <br/>\nthem to come aboard, being not able to resist them, which people did <br/>\nus no harm, neither of us understanding the one the other. The king <br/>\nof Bungo showed us great friendship, for he gave us a house and land, <br/>\nwhere we landed our sick men, and had all refreshing that was <br/>\nneedful. We had when we came to anchor in Bungo, sick and whole, four <br/>\nand twenty men, of which number the next day three died. The rest for <br/>\nthe most part recovered, saving three, which lay a long time sick, <br/>\nand in the end also died. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the which time of our being here, the emperor hearing of us sent <br/>\npresently five galleys, or frigates, to us to bring me to the court <br/>\nwhere His Highness was, which was distant from Bungo about eighty <br/>\nEnglish leagues. So that as soon as I came before him, he demanded of <br/>\nme of what country we were. So I answered him in all points, for <br/>\nthere was nothing that he demanded not, both concerning war and peace <br/>\nbetween country and country; so that the particulars here to write <br/>\nwould be too tedious. And for that time I was commanded to prison, <br/>\nbeing well used, with one of our mariners that came with me to serve <br/>\nme. <br/>\n<br/>\nA two days after, the emperor called me again, demanding the reason <br/>\nof our coming so far. I answered: We are a people that sought all <br/>\nfriendship with all nations, and to have trade in all countries, <br/>\nbringing such merchandise as our country did afford into strange <br/>\nlands in the way of traffic. He demanded also as concerning the wars <br/>\nbetween the Spaniards or Portugal and our country and the reasons; <br/>\nthe which I gave him to understand of all things, which he was glad <br/>\nto hear, as it seemed to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I was commanded to prison again, but my lodging was <br/>\nbettered in another place. So that thirty-nine days I was in prison, <br/>\nhearing no more news, neither of our ship nor captain, whether he <br/>\nwere recovered of his sickness or not, nor of the rest of the <br/>\ncompany; in which time I looked every day to die, to be crossed <br/>\n[crucified] as the custom of justice is in Japan, as hanging in our <br/>\nland. In which long time of imprisonment, the Jesuits and the <br/>\nPortuguese gave many evidences against me and the rest to the emperor <br/>\nthat we were thieves and robbers of all nations, and, were we <br/>\nsuffered to live, it should be against the profit of His Highness and <br/>\nthe land; for no nation should come there without robbing; His <br/>\nHighness&#39;s justice being executed, the rest of our nation without <br/>\ndoubt should fear and not come here any more: thus daily making <br/>\naccess to the emperor and procuring friends to hasten my death. But <br/>\nGod, that is always merciful at need, showed mercy unto us and would <br/>\nnot suffer them to have their wills of us. In the end, the emperor <br/>\ngave them answer that we as yet had not done to him nor to none of <br/>\nhis land any harm or damage; therefore against reason and justice to <br/>\nput us to death. If our countries had war the one with the other, <br/>\nthat was no cause that he should put us to death; with which they <br/>\nwere out of heart that their cruel pretense failed them. For which <br/>\nGod be forever-more praised. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow in this time that I was in prison the ship was commanded to be <br/>\nbrought so near to the city where the emperor was as she might be <br/>\n(for grounding her); the which was done. Forty-one days being <br/>\nexpired, the emperor caused me to be brought before him again, <br/>\ndemanding of me many questions more, which were too long to write. In <br/>\nconclusion he asked me whether I were desirous to go to the ship to <br/>\nsee my countrymen. I answered very gladly, the which he bade me do. <br/>\nSo I departed and was free from imprisonment. And this was the first <br/>\nnews that I had that the ship and company were come to the city. So <br/>\nthat with a rejoicing heart I took a boat and went to our ship, where <br/>\nI found the captain and the rest recovered of their sickness; and <br/>\nwhen I came aboard with weeping eyes was received, for it was given <br/>\nthem to understand that I was executed long since. Thus, God be <br/>\npraised, all we that were left alive came together again. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the ship all things were taken out, so that the clothes which I <br/>\ntook with me on my back I only had. All my instruments and books were <br/>\ntaken. Not only I lost what I had in the ship, but from the captain <br/>\nand the company generally what was good or worth the taking was <br/>\ncarried away; all which was done unknown to the emperor. So in <br/>\nprocess of time having knowledge of it, he commanded that they which <br/>\nhad taken our goods should restore it to us back again; but it was <br/>\nhere and there so taken that we could not get it again, saving 50,000 <br/>\nR in ready money was commanded to be given us and in his presence <br/>\nbrought and delivered in the hands of one that was made our governor, <br/>\nwho kept them in his hands to distribute them unto us as we had need <br/>\nfor the buying of victuals for our men with other particular charges. <br/>\nIn the end the money was divided according to every man&#39;s place; but <br/>\nthis was about two years that we had been in Japan, and when we had a <br/>\ndenial that we should not have our ship, but to abide in Japan. So <br/>\nthat the part of every one being divided, every one took his way <br/>\nwhere he thought best. In the end, the emperor gave every man, much <br/>\nas was worth eleven or twelve ducats a year, namely, myself, the <br/>\ncaptain, and mariners all alike. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in process of four or five years the emperor called me, as divers <br/>\ntimes he had done before. So one time above the rest he would have me <br/>\nto make him a small ship. I answered that I was no carpenter and had <br/>\nno knowledge thereof. &quot;Well, do your endeavor,&quot; said he; &quot;if it be <br/>\nnot good, it is no matter.&quot; Wherefore at his command I built him a <br/>\nship of the burden of eighty tons or thereabout; which ship being <br/>\nmade in all respects as our manner is, he coming aboard to see it, <br/>\nliked it very well; by which means I came in favor with him, so that <br/>\nI came often in his presence, who from time to time gave me presents, <br/>\nand at length a yearly stipend to live upon, much about seventy <br/>\nducats by the year with two pounds of rice a day daily. Now being in <br/>\nsuch grace and favor by reason I learned him some points of geometry <br/>\nand understanding of the art of mathematics with other things, I <br/>\npleased him so that what I said he would not contrary. At which my <br/>\nformer enemies did wonder, and at this time must entreat me to do <br/>\nthem a friendship, which to both Spaniards and Portuguese have I <br/>\ndone, recompensing them good for evil. So to pass my time to get my <br/>\nliving, it hath cost me great labor and trouble at the first; but God <br/>\nhath blessed my labor. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end of five years I made supplication to the king to go out of <br/>\nthis land, desiring to see my poor wife and children according to <br/>\nconscience and nature. With the which request the emperor was not <br/>\nwell pleased, and would not let me go any more for my country, but to <br/>\nbide in his land. Yet in process of time, being in great favor with <br/>\nthe emperor, I made supplication again, by reason we had news that <br/>\nthe Hollanders were in Shian and Patania; which rejoiced us much with <br/>\nhope that God should bring us to our country again by one means or <br/>\nother. So I made supplication again, and boldly spoke myself with <br/>\nhim, at which he gave me no answer. I told him if he would permit me <br/>\nto depart, I would be a means that both the English and Hollanders <br/>\nshould come and traffic there. But by no means he would let me go. I <br/>\nasked him leave for the captain, the which he presently granted me. <br/>\nSo by that means my captain got leave, and in a Japan junk sailed to <br/>\nPattan; and in a year&#39;s space came to Hollanders. In the end, he went <br/>\nfrom Patane to Ior, where he found a fleet of nine sail, of which <br/>\nfleet Matleef was general, and in this fleet he was made master <br/>\nagain, which fleet sailed to Malacca and fought with an armado of <br/>\nPortugal; in which battle he was shot and presently died; so that, as <br/>\nI think, no certain news is known whether I be living or dead. <br/>\nTherefore I do pray and entreat you in the name of Jesus Christ to do <br/>\nso much as to make my being here in Japan known to my poor wife, in a <br/>\nmanner a widow and my two children fatherless; which thing only is my <br/>\ngreatest grief of heart and conscience. I am a man not unknown in <br/>\nRatcliffe and Limehouse, by name to my good Master Nicholas Diggines <br/>\nand M. Thomas Best and M. Nicholas Isaac and William Isaac, brothers, <br/>\nwith many others; also to M. William Jones and M. Becket. Therefore <br/>\nmay this letter come to any of their hands or the copy, I do know <br/>\nthat compassion and mercy is so that my friends and kindred shall <br/>\nhave news that I do as yet live in this vale of my sorrowful <br/>\npilgrimage; the which thing again and again I do desire for Jesus <br/>\nChrist his sake.&quot;</div>",
