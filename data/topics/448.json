            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-456343437\">Hello,<br/>\n The &#39;basic&#39; answer to the question here is that the Samurai WERE the only <br/>\nones allowed to hold the &#39;Daisho&#39; (two swords)..with the exception of members <br/>\nof the Doshin police, and other people associated with the court allowed to <br/>\nwear one sword.<br/>\n However I think that the reason you seem confused on this point is that <br/>\nthese edicts really only were enforced throughout the Tokugawa <br/>\nperiod..starting roughly at the time of Hideyoshi&#39;s great &#39;Sword Hunt&#39; at the <br/>\nend of the 16th century.<br/>\n Before the Edo period many &#39;Kenshi&#39; were trained in Kenjutsu and many became <br/>\nfamous..despite their &#39;non-Samurai&#39; status. During the Edo period it was <br/>\nstill possible to be trained in these systems as the authorities clamp down <br/>\nwas not 100% successfull and could not be enforced. <br/>\n I am not too sure about this but I believe that it was only the Daisho set <br/>\nup that was the sole right of Samurai..Peasants may have been &#39;allowed&#39; one <br/>\nsword (usually the Wakizashi) if their public duties required it of them.<br/>\n Yagyu Shingan Ryu Heijutsu was a system that taught to many various classes <br/>\nof people and the ryu has slightly different techniques depending on the <br/>\n&#39;needs&#39; of the trainee...i.e Higher class members such as Daimyo or high <br/>\nretainers were taught techniques both with the Katana and also the Muto-dori <br/>\nthat would have to be used in the presence of ones senior if attacked..Lower <br/>\nclassed trainees were taught techniques that could be used by them in <br/>\ncircumstances they could be caught up in.<br/>\n The term used by the school for this is &#39;Bushi yawara&#39; or Warriors Jujutsu <br/>\nto seperate it out from, say, Suhada Jujutsu (or Jujutsu in &#39;everyday&#39; clothi<br/>\nng)<br/>\n Since the sword was also taught in the Yagyu Shingan ryu it can be assumed <br/>\nthat there were similarities there with the Jujutsu...<br/>\n So basically wether the person was allowed to wear the swords depended more <br/>\non the time he is shown in and the position he occupies..Tokugawa society was <br/>\nfar more stratified than the organization had ever been before and the <br/>\nclasses were kept quite distinct during the period..It would have been &#39;bad <br/>\nform&#39; to train students in weapons they could not be expected to carry <br/>\nopenly..so the training was probably hidden or hushed up by the trainees.<br/>\n Hope this helps ya!<br/>\n Abayo.<br/>\n Ben Sharples</div>",
