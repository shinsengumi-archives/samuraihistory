From what I understand, it&#39;s the first American edition to include the <br/>\nentire book.  For some reason known only to God Himself, the FIRST American <br/>\nedition (the one Kubrick&#39;s adaptation is based on) left off the last chapter.<br/>\n       I did rent Kubrick&#39;s ACO for my dad when I worked there, but he didn&#39;t <br/>\ncare for it.  As I said, not being a movie fan (aside from the occasional), <br/>\nI&#39;ve not seen it, but I may buy the DVD someday just to have it.  And who <br/>\nknows, I may watch it someday.  :-)  And even like it as much as the book.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nL8r<br/>\nTim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
