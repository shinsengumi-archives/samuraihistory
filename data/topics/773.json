You have probably missed you<br/>\nassignment date, hope you have an understanding tutor. Not sure where you<br/>\nare (time wise!!), but here is a suggestion fo an unusua approach:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have recently been writing a chapter on &quot;Women of the Samurai&quot; and, of<br/>\ncourse, Gacia Hosokawa features quite strongly. You should assume that the<br/>\nsuicide was for the &quot;Good of Others&quot;, but still not a christian act!!<br/>\nSeppuku is rather different for women on the samurai class - but the end<br/>\nresult is the same.  You can search the WEB and find several sites giving<br/>\ninformation [probably the best approach at this late stage]. This site is<br/>\npretty good for an overall veiwpoint.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.furyu.com/archives/issue2/gracia.html\">http://www.furyu.com/archives/issue2/gracia.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with the paper....<br/>\n<br/>\n                                        Rod Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KawaiiLizard@...\">KawaiiLizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 22, 2002 2:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Intro/Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;          First of all, I&#39;m Liz and I just joined this group.  I&#39;m doing a<br/>\n&gt; research paper on samurai and seppuku, and I have a question for you all<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping someone can answer as soon as possible.  The paper is due<br/>\ntomorrow<br/>\n&gt; and I just realized that I don&#39;t have an example for how samurais<br/>\nsometimes<br/>\n&gt; used seppuku to save others.  If I&#39;m completely off and they never did<br/>\nthen I<br/>\n&gt; can just take it out, but it would help if I had some kind of example so I<br/>\n&gt; could leave it in.  Please, if anyone has any examples that they could<br/>\ngive<br/>\n&gt; me could you e-mail/IM me?  My e-mail is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kawaiilizard@...\">kawaiilizard@...</a> and my<br/>\nAOL/AIM<br/>\n&gt; name is KawaiiLizard.  Thank you so much for your help in advance!
