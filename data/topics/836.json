Few days ago I stated a question and there<br/>\n&gt; was now feedback so I&#39;ll try to ask again and in different way. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; doing some research on Toyotomi Hideyoshi and I&#39;d like to write<br/>\n&gt; something about those men who helped him on his way. Undoubtedly he was<br/>\n&gt; the warrior with great talent and he is the one who managed to rule the<br/>\n&gt; whole country. But there were also some man who figured as advisors or<br/>\n&gt; helped him or just acted in way, which gave Hideyoshi great chance to<br/>\n&gt; accomplish his mission (for example Sakuma Morimasa). I don&#39;t think that<br/>\n&gt; without those men, Hideyoshi won&#39;t be the ruler of Japan, but I just to<br/>\n&gt; know something about them and for my work I&#39;d like to know opinions of<br/>\n&gt; you on this subject. So if you could write me some names and the reason<br/>\n&gt; why do you think they helped him, I&#39;ll be grateful to you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1879438100\">Hi there..<br/>\n On this issue you would certainly have to consider Oda Nobunaga. There can <br/>\nbe little doubt that without the help of Oda, Hideyoshi would NEVER have <br/>\nrisen to the postion that he finally did..From bringing him onto the stage as <br/>\na Samurai through to Hideyoshi&#39;s vengeance that lead to his achieving the <br/>\nunification of Japan, Oda Nobunaga was THE pivotal figure in Hideyoshi&#39;s rise <br/>\nupwards.<br/>\n A few good books on both men are available; I would suggest that you start <br/>\nwith &#39;Hideyoshi&#39; by Elizabeth Berry...A thorough look at the man and his <br/>\npolicies and those who helped him in his rise. Also I would read &#39;Japonius <br/>\nTyrannus-Nobunaga reconsidered&#39; By Jerome Lamarrs (?) another very good book <br/>\non Oda and his ties to the Toyotomi house.<br/>\n Another possible candidate in your question would be Tokugawa Ieyasu as the <br/>\neventual Shogun aided Hideyoshi throughout as an equal commander under <br/>\nNobunaga before finally outgrowing and out living Hideyoshi...I am sure that <br/>\nthe influence of both of these men helped Hideyoshi and his understanding of <br/>\nJapanese politics at that stage in Japanese history.<br/>\n Others? Kato Kiyomasa perhaps, Inaba Ittetsu, or any of the Samurai that <br/>\nhelped in the Osaka battles of 1615...Many of the generals there had strong <br/>\nties to the Toyotomi and gave aid there due to the debt they felt they owed <br/>\nto Hideyoshi and his family....Rather than Tokugawa.<br/>\n Long issue but the books I recommended will help you out. Also try to read <br/>\nup on the Korean invasions of the late 16th century as many of the Samurai <br/>\ninvolved there were staunch supporters of the Toyotomi.<br/>\n HTH.<br/>\n Abayo.<br/>\n Ben Sharples</div>",
