The US doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nthe records that Europe or Japan has. Possibly because in the US <br/>\ncitizenship is determined by where you are born and your parents <br/>\ncitizenship if you are born outside of the US. Unlike for example <br/>\nGermany where 4th generation Turks are not citizens and people of German <br/>\nancestory can become German citizens quite rapidly. Same issues with <br/>\nKoreans born in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: Re: New Member Arrival<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for the information.  I do have a follow up question.  What is a Taiga <br/>\n&gt;drama and where could I rent the one about Saigo Takamori?  Is there any <br/>\n&gt;chance it has English subtitles?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>NHK has a one year long series that usually historical in nature on <br/>\nSundays. They are high budget with famous actors. The current one that <br/>\njust ended this week on NHK and TV Japan was Musashi. if you can rent <br/>\nit, I recommend it. Hopefully they will come out with a six hour version <br/>\nlike some of the other dramas so people who missed it can see the <br/>\nhighlights.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn San Francisco JTOWN there are a couple of rental stores that have TV <br/>\nseries same with San Jose, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Santa Clara county library system has about 500 Japanese language <br/>\nvideos, a few that I&#39;ve seen deal with Meiji, I haven&#39;t seen one that <br/>\ndeals directly with Saigo yet. If you live in California, you might be <br/>\nable to get the videos via interlibrary loan. Otherwise you might have <br/>\nto mail order from Japan which means no subtitles. A bit of a problem <br/>\nfor me if they have too much of an accent.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
