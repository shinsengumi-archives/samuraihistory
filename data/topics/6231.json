No argument that some swords<br/>\nare better than others, now or then.

Only when there is a<br/>\ntremendous disparity between the two blades does that become a significant<br/>\nfactor.

Swords were in fact tested on corpses and ranked by how<br/>\nwell they cut, the results of the test was sometimes inscribed on the tang<br/>\nof the blade. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/sharp.htm\">http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/sharp.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Thomas Davidson<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, December 11, 2004 3:56 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] On naming swords<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is an excerpt from &#39;My Father&#39; by Arai Hasuseki, in Legends of<br/>\n  the Samurai&#39; and it relates a story:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hasuseki&#39;s father Masanori, lived from 1601-82,  &#39;not far removed<br/>\n  from the Sengoku Jidai&#39;, as his son describes it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &#39;You should never say ... that you carry a sharp blade ... someone<br/>\n  heard someone else say his sword cuts exceptionally well, so said<br/>\n  &quot;By Heaven, you act rudely as if no-one else was around you.<br/>\n  Do you suppose anyone would carry a sword that does not cut?<br/>\n  Come on, man, see for yourself whether my sword cuts or not!&quot;<br/>\n  and drew his sword.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Apparently, bystanders intervened before blood was spilt.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It would appear from other details related to named swords, here and<br/>\n  elsewhere, that names usually derived from an incident to do with<br/>\n  the sword, rather than from any inherent quality of the blade.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The risk in attributing qualities to the sword itself implies that<br/>\n  other swords lack that quality, or rather this sword is superior<br/>\n  in that quality to all others, and thus an insult to the owner,<br/>\n  and an invitation to a duel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They were touchy chaps, in those days.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thomas </span></blockquote></div>",
