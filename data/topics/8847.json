It takes 500+ pre-orders before<br/>\nthey start shipping (similar to GMT games).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games are &quot;Samurai Lords, the Wars of Feudal Japan,&quot; and &quot;A Most<br/>\nDangerous Time, Japan 1570-1584.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.multimanpublishing.com/preorder/viewGame.php?id=32<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.multimanpublishing.com/preorder/viewGame.php?id=34<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.multimanpublishing.com/preorder/preorder.php<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read reviews of both japanese versions and they sound great.<br/>\nI hope that this post will encourage others to order one or both of<br/>\nthe games (so I can get mine sooner!).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\nDan<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. If anyone here has played these games before, please give us<br/>\nyour thoughts.</div>",
