Most wounds were deep cuts. Some were bullet wounds by the rifles<br/>\n&gt; provided by the Portuguese. Not much was written about that as far as I<br/>\n&gt; know. As for the dead bodies, they were burned to stop the spread of disease<br/>\n&gt; and as an act of respect for the fallen warriors. For those who were highly<br/>\n&gt; sought after, a reward for that certain Samurai&#39;s head was offered by the<br/>\n&gt; Diamyo of his enemy. It had to be a fresh kill. Decomposition made<br/>\n&gt; identifying the face difficult.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have studied the history of the Samurai not only because it is<br/>\n&gt; fascinating but because I am from Samurai bloodlines. Specifically the<br/>\n&gt; Harubiyuna. Thier kamon is two arrow feathers inside a circle. One pointing<br/>\n&gt; upwards, and one downwards. I find myself both lucky and honored to be the<br/>\n&gt; descendant of Samurai. It&#39;s truly something to be proud of. Not for anything<br/>\n&gt; I have done but to be linked to such a rich history as the Samurai. I am<br/>\n&gt; half American, half Japanese.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck in your writing!

But as a practical matter, men wounded in battle had to be<br/>\n&gt; treated. Willingness to die notwithstanding, a dead samurai (or ashigaru) is<br/>\n&gt; worth less to his master than a living one. As I understand it, seppuku was<br/>\n&gt; reserved for hopeless situations, where the only other option was capture or<br/>\n&gt; abject failure (the death of one&#39;s daimyo, say).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I imagine that battlefield medicine was very catch-as-catch-can and based<br/>\n&gt; as much on Chinese medicine as was practical, but still, the more specifics<br/>\n&gt; I can get, the better off I&#39;ll be.

To save his and his family&#39;s honor! If he is<br/>\n&gt; lucky, he will have a &quot;Kaishaku&quot;. A close friend or family member to cut off<br/>\n&gt; his head with a Katana to end the painful death by disembowelment. It was<br/>\n&gt; considered &quot;humane&quot; ironically!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the Samurai, death is expected of him. Not failure, but death was thier<br/>\n&gt; way of life. They dont glorify death, but accept it as a part of thier duty<br/>\n&gt; and honor. Of course they expect to be victorious in battle always! But they<br/>\n&gt; also accept death as a part of that victory!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for medicine, if a Samurai was not mortally wounded, I heard they used<br/>\n&gt; salt to stop the bleeding.

But as a practical matter, men wounded in battle had to be<br/>\n&gt; treated. Willingness to die notwithstanding, a dead samurai (or ashigaru) is<br/>\n&gt; worth less to his master than a living one. As I understand it, seppuku was<br/>\n&gt; reserved for hopeless situations, where the only other option was capture or<br/>\n&gt; abject failure (the death of one&#39;s daimyo, say).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I imagine that battlefield medicine was very catch-as-catch-can and based<br/>\n&gt; as much on Chinese medicine as was practical, but still, the more specifics<br/>\n&gt; I can get, the better off I&#39;ll be.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-567171190\">I am new here too. I am looking for information about searching about ones Samurai ancestral history. My mother has always told me I am from Samurai bloodlines. She passed away in 1999. My Aunt in Japan says my Samurai bloodlines go back to a clan called the Harubiyuna. Our Kamon is two arrow feathers inside a circle one pointing upward, one pointing downward. Can anyone helpe me with learning more about my Samurai bloodlines?? My mother&#39;s maiden name is Fukase. I am half Japanese, half American.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, my favorite samurai is Miyamoto Musashi. But that is a topic for another post.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nDomo Arigato gozaimashita!<br/>\nJohn</div>",
