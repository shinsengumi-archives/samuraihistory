Even the greatest physical strength and skill are no match for the power of wholeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of true karate is natural, effortless action, and the confidence, humility, openness and peace only possible through perfect unity of mind and body.

Perhaps this link might refresh your <br/>\nmemory: http://www.ska.org/funakoshi.shtml<br/>\n<br/>\nThat the teachings of Master Funakoshi and a selection of those of bushido seem to have melded is both a somewhat serendipitous and <br/>\nalso a consciously adopted modern practice.  But it was not planned so by Master Funakoshi, and the samurai class was long disbanded <br/>\nbefore his time.  I would go so far as to propose the thought that karate and the samurai had a common ancestor in the precepts of <br/>\nother oriental teachings:  Shinto, Tao, Buddhism, and probably others I&#39;m too tired to bring into mind after a long hard shift at <br/>\nthe hospital, so I must ask forgiveness...........<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sensei studied with both Masters Funakoshi & Nakayama in Japan.

In fact,  I remember Master Nakayama advocating to <br/>\nkeep &#39;beginner&#39;s mind&#39; with whatever one pursued, at whatever level of mastery, in whatever area of your life..... because then your <br/>\nmind would be prepared to learn, to see things anew, and not blocking off learning.

Until the 17th century<br/>\nthey were more closely tied to China than Japan.<br/>\nJapanese influence came mainly through the Shimazu in<br/>\nSatsuma, and I hardly think they &quot;promoted&quot; the<br/>\nOkinawans to samurai status when they made it a<br/>\ntributary state of theirs. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the rest of this, I&#39;m thouroughly confused as<br/>\nto who is saying what at this point. When you (not you<br/>\nGereg, but some of the other posters in this thread)<br/>\nreply to someone, make sure it&#39;s clear where the email<br/>\nyou are replying to ends and your comments begin. I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t commented for several reasons: a. I can&#39;t tell<br/>\nwho&#39;s writing what, even though I approved the<br/>\nmessages; b. it&#39;s yet ANOTHER bushido/zen/martial arts<br/>\ndiscussion, and I&#39;ve got no interest in it; c. even if<br/>\nI did, I&#39;m sure the words of some martial arts sensei<br/>\nclaiming karate was founded by Miyamoto Musashi and<br/>\nMinamoto Yoshitsune working together would weigh more<br/>\nheavily with some of our young practioners than my<br/>\npointing out that the two didn&#39;t live in the same<br/>\ncentury. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when I was 14, taking Shotokan karate-do as<br/>\nhas been brought up in previous posts. I respected my<br/>\nsensei as an instructor of karate technique, but even<br/>\nat age 14 I had more complete knowledge of Japanese<br/>\nhistory and culture. This isn&#39;t a dig on teenagers,<br/>\nand I don&#39;t know if the posters in this thread are or<br/>\nare not. It doesn&#39;t matter. Whether you are 14 or 40,<br/>\nyou have to invesitgate and question, even if the info<br/>\ncomes from your sensei. Shotokan Karate is JAPANESE,<br/>\nyes, as opposed to Okinawan. It was developed in Tokyo<br/>\nby Gichin Funakoshi. However, it does draw from<br/>\nOkinawan karate, and technique wise is closely<br/>\nrelated. Master Funakoshi was alive in the late 19th<br/>\nand early 20th centuries. While he may or may not have<br/>\nwished to include &quot;Zen&quot; or &quot;Bushido&quot;, it was hardly a<br/>\n&quot;samurai art&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nCheck out the new Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1639630791\">Zev, I&#39;d turn that suggestion back on you and &quot;strongly suggest&quot; that you<br/>\nyourself do quite a bit more research into the samurai and martial arts,<br/>\nbefore you take so condescending a tone - especially with someone like that<br/>\npolite Australian, who&#39;s gone to such trouble to avoid insulting another<br/>\nparty on the list.  The available histories of the samurai class - and there<br/>\nare a number of them available, if you&#39;re willing to take the trouble to<br/>\nread them - do not readily support your view.  In fact, as Paul pointed out,<br/>\nthe best indications are that the only link between the Okinawans (who<br/>\noriginated karate) and the Japanese bushi (or samurai)... were that they<br/>\nfought against each other.<br/>\nDojo traditions are frequently not very good history, and this one you&#39;ve<br/>\ncited sounds like a classic of the type.  To be sure, modern karate stylists<br/>\nmay have chosen to be influenced by classical samurai traditions of bushido,<br/>\nbut that does not mean that these traditions had anything to do with the<br/>\nearly development of the art of karate itself.  I don&#39;t doubt that your<br/>\nsenseis are telling you the truth as they believe it:  but as I say, dojo<br/>\ntraditions are not very reliable as history.  Where did your teachers get<br/>\nthis information?  How far back does it really go?  And can they prove it?<br/>\nIf their evidence stands out in contradiction to all the documented sources<br/>\nfrom history, then I&#39;d have to say they&#39;re only carrying on what they were<br/>\ntold themselves.  That doesn&#39;t make it history.<br/>\nCertainly there is evidence that many bushi practised empty-hand grappling<br/>\nas an adjunct art to the weapon styles that were their mainstay - but karate<br/>\n(which in its earliest form, as I recall, simply means &#39;Okinawan hand&#39;) is<br/>\nvery distinct from the aiki-jutsu which we have evidence of bushi<br/>\npractising.  Aikido could lay a more direct and more convincing claim to the<br/>\nancestral influence you describe.  Really - study some more; learn some more<br/>\nabout what you&#39;re talking about:  you won&#39;t find support for your argument<br/>\nin reputable history.  And you will be less likely to insult someone the way<br/>\nyou&#39;ve done here - someone whose manners are rather better than yours, based<br/>\non the evidence at hand.  Is rudeness part of your dojo tradition too?  Does<br/>\nit show respect for your art to insult a fellow practitioner when he<br/>\ndisagrees politely with you?  Because that is clearly what you have done.<br/>\nAnd that is not the Way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to the fellow who said that &quot;The Okinawans... were samurai,&quot; I&#39;m pretty<br/>\nsure that claim can&#39;t be backed up with reliable history either.  (Tony?<br/>\nNate?  Any comments on this?)  As you noted, the Okinawans did regard<br/>\nthemselves as a separate nation:  so to claim that they were samurai is a<br/>\ndirect contradiction of that idea, since the samurai were a distinctly<br/>\nJapanese phenomenon.  This is like saying that the Shaolin monks were<br/>\nsamurai.  I agree that you should never take the martial arts at face value<br/>\n(I&#39;ve got thirty-odd years of practise and study behind me at this stage).<br/>\nBut that includes the oral traditions that are passed down:  you can&#39;t take<br/>\nthose at face value either.

It suited the samurai character which was <br/>\nmarked by self-justification, self-reliance, pride and vanity, <br/>\nand did not bother him with quibbles about morality, or right <br/>\nand wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy far the most significant influences upon the samurai and <br/>\nswordsmanship in particular was Shinto, Tendai Buddhism and the <br/>\nsyncretic forms of &#39;mikkyo&#39; - Shingon or esoteric Buddhism.<br/>\n<br/>\nA study of &#39;horimono&#39; - the engravings made on sword blades - <br/>\nshowed over 95% bore images from Shingon Buddhism - none <br/>\nconcerned Zen or its concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe direct and founding influences on the development of <br/>\nswordsmanship came from:<br/>\n<br/>\nTaoism - an understanding of natural principle<br/>\n<br/>\nConfucianism - ethics and morality<br/>\n<br/>\nShinto - aesthetic values<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Shingon, which bears elements of the above.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore the names of the techniques of swordsmanship <br/>\nthemselves show Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist and Shinto <br/>\ninfluence, and the great schools themselves are founded on <br/>\nShinto Shrines.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, one might say there were Zen swordsmen, but <br/>\nswordsmmanship itself is the product of Shinto and Taoist <br/>\nprinciples and practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you Wanadoo:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/\">http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis email has been checked for most known viruses - find out more at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm\">http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm</a></div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2107138939\">Yes Iaido is more Samurai orientated, however I practice Karate with the JKA, this was the first ever Karate organisation. It has been dubed the Keeper of Karate&#39;s Highest tradition, that tradition is Bushido. Master Ohta the head of our association JKA England says that the way of the samurai has a direct influence on Karate. The Okinawan&#39;s despite seeing themselves as a seperate nation to the Japanese for a long time, were Samurai. Master Funakoshi developer of the Shotokan style was a son of a Samurai. It is a common misconception that Karate is nothing to do with the Samurai, due to the more common sport Karate. However if you study Bushido, Zen and traditional Karate as I do then you will see the Samurai influence. As an Anglo-Japanese myself this is very important to me, I hope you can find more information on the Samurai and Zen. But never take the martial arts at face value.<br/>\n<br/>\nRichardson Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:umaryu@...\">umaryu@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nHi<br/>\n<br/>\nNo disrespect in tended towards Karate, but I am under<br/>\nthe assumption that Karate has nothing to do with the<br/>\nsamurai except to fight samurai by the Okinawan<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe karate Dojo is related to samurai principles but<br/>\ni would say Karate is not a samurai art etc per se.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say Iaido was more samurai related than<br/>\nkarate.
