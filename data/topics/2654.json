Why were <br/>\nthey trying to <br/>\nbecome so modern???&quot; Here&#39;s an answer:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe samurai were feudal warriors... basically Japanese fighting other <br/>\nJapanese, hidden behind <br/>\na curtain of isolationism. Well, the long-practiced isolationism ended with <br/>\nthe intrusion of  <br/>\nPerry&#39;s ships. When that curtain fell, Japan saw a bigger world with a lot of <br/>\npotential enemies. <br/>\nJapan realized it could not defend itself. Japan had to unify and modernize <br/>\nin order to defend <br/>\nitself from invasion. The samurai tactics of war were well-suited for <br/>\nfighting other sword-bearing <br/>\nfoes on the island of Japan. But if could do very little against a navy <br/>\nfleet.  <br/>\nThe Japanese were no longer concerned with how to defend themselves from <br/>\nother Japanese. <br/>\nThey had to know how to defend themselves from everybody else.
