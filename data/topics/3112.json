I did not <br/>\n&gt;like the chrome/stainless steel look of the guns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nickel was a common finish for guns, even some fairly large ones then so <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t too wierd...<br/>\nOf course we are talking Hollywood so...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: Re: The Last Samurai-----rifles<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I read an article about an American knife and sword maker, who had been <br/>\n&gt;trained by some of the best sword makers in Japan and he was able to make a Katana <br/>\n&gt;that was able to cut a one inch steel cable.  The cable was suspended and <br/>\n&gt;allowed to hang freely.  This was one of the tests he used to test some of his <br/>\n&gt;blades.  So maybe it is possible to cut the barrel of a gun with a good downward <br/>\n&gt;force swing of a Katana.  This is just something that I read and as of right <br/>\n&gt;now I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on Samurai, but I am reading as much as I can <br/>\n&gt;afford to buy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which magazine? Once again my friends and I have read heavily on WW2 <br/>\nhistory and never found any examples of this. It might be possible, but <br/>\nI kind of doubt it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
