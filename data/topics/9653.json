            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1182447572\">Although all of us are here because of varying degrees of interest <br/>\nin samurai I think that your question is a little subjective. It <br/>\ndepends on in what way you consider them superior, and when compared <br/>\nto who? Many of us are familiar with the whole samurai v. knight <br/>\ndebate. I would like to make a suggestion though. I suggest that you <br/>\nlook at samurai from within the proper historical and cultural <br/>\ncontext rather than trying to compare them to others. There is <br/>\nalways someone that will top who ever you think is the best in some <br/>\nform. Plus, a lot of what lead to the idea of the samurai being so <br/>\nmuch greater than say their western couterparts was very very <br/>\nheavily influenced by 19th century romaticism. Just for an example. <br/>\nA lot of people talk about how dedicated and loyal samurai were. <br/>\nThat they would rather die then give off even the slightest <br/>\nimpression of slacking in their duties or rebellion. Once again this <br/>\nwas influence by 19th romanticizing of the samurai. For much of <br/>\ntheir history most samurai were oppurtunists. They fought for their <br/>\nlord as long as it was in their best interests to do so, or out of <br/>\nfear of what would happen if they did not. During the Sengoku period <br/>\nthere was not the horrible stigma if a samurai changed sides that <br/>\nwould later be applied during peace time. It was not uncommon for <br/>\nwarriors who were defeated in battle to be offered employment by the <br/>\nvictor. This is not something horrible for the time. It is simply <br/>\nthe way most,if not all, known feudal societies.which were <br/>\ninherantly fractured, functioned.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-381155603\">Chris,<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is a difficult question because Japan was isolated from the outside world for such a long period of time. There is really not much to compare outside of a few brief conflicts including the Mongol invasions (which aren&#39;t an accurate comparison really) and Hideyoshi&#39;s foray in Korea. I guess you could also mention a few conflicts with pirates if you wanted to be picky. Any comparison to the warriors of Japan and other groups would make for an excellent thesis though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I may throw out some ideas though... Their unique blend of religious/social beliefs, sword making/use, years of armed conflict and civil wars (practice, you might say), a &quot;Spartan-like&quot; mentality regarding death (in some cases). Of course, we all know what happened when these great warriors met up with a more technologically advanced force in the mid-late 1800&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternative question might be... What made Japan a successful warrior nation? It did survive for a long period of time, and the Tokugawa regime lasted &quot;peacefully&quot; for more than 250 years. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few thoughts... An interesting question.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan P.
