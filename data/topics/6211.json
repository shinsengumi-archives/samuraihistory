Arguing about spiritual<br/>\notherworldly forces and divine powers in this situation is<br/>\napparently tantamount to arguing about religion.<br/>\nThat would appear to be the case, all right.  In some ways I wish it had<br/>\nnever come up, as I had no intention of parading my religious views here -<br/>\nlet alone any desire to feel I needed to defend them.  However:  please note<br/>\nthat from my point of view, and likewise from the Shinto perspective as I<br/>\nunderstand it, there&#39;s nothing &quot;otherworldly&quot; about it.  It&#39;s a perfectly<br/>\nnatural part of this world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome believe, some<br/>\ndon&#39;t, and there is no way to prove it one way or the other.  I<br/>\nthink it is reasonable to say that a crafted sword is a work of art,<br/>\nand many people attribute power and emotion to works of art - i.e.<br/>\nVan Gogh&#39;s angst.  It is actually quite subjective.  One can &quot;sense&quot;<br/>\npower in a sword - but that is very likely because of the symbolism<br/>\nof the sword in both Japanese history and world history as well.  We<br/>\nLOOK for it. Carl Jung talked about symbolism and the subconcious,<br/>\nhumans look for symbolism - objectively speaking a piece of sharp<br/>\nmetal should invoke nothing, but subjectively the sword is a symbol<br/>\nof power, that can invoke various emotions and feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone once described Jung as a Taoist mystic masquerading as a<br/>\npsychoanalyst.  And I can&#39;t argue that I, reared on King Arthur, Beowulf and<br/>\nthe Greek myths from childhood as I was, do tend to look for the magical in<br/>\nthe everyday world.  But one can look at that two ways:  it could be said<br/>\nthat we see things like symbols of power because we look for them (with the<br/>\nimplication that they might not be there if we didn&#39;t project them there),<br/>\nor on the other hand, it could be said that if we&#39;re trained to the correct<br/>\nsensitivity, any of us can be capable of perceiving things that others, who<br/>\nlack that training, may overlook.<br/>\nNo, it cannot be proven one way or the other.  And I profoundly doubt that<br/>\nmy experience is going to persuade anyone who has not shared some similar<br/>\nexperience.  (In fact, I think I&#39;d be a little nervous about anyone whose<br/>\nworldview was so easily shaped by others:  that sounds like raw material for<br/>\nthe nearest odd cult.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that swords are awe inspiring and have an aura about them<br/>\nbecause of the history and symbolism, but I think it is reasonable<br/>\nto say that a sword doesn&#39;t contain otherworldly spiritual energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is no more reasonable to deny that a sword might have a spirit than to<br/>\nassert that it must.  Neither is ultimately a statement of reason at all.<br/>\nBoth are statements of faith in a particular paradigm, or worldview.  That<br/>\none of these views is more prevalent today does not make it right, any more<br/>\nthan the Church was right when it forced Galileo to recant his heretical<br/>\nviews about the earth revolving around the sun.  &quot;Reasonable&quot; ideas change<br/>\nwith every generation.  I dare say there isn&#39;t a one of us who embraces<br/>\nevery &quot;reasonable&quot; idea that our parents held:  let alone our grandparents.<br/>\nNor is it clear that every such change in cultural paradigms is for the<br/>\nbetter:  that concept is part and parcel with the paradigm that holds that<br/>\nprogress moves us always onward to better and better things.  And if that<br/>\nwere so, then I imagine the quality of the air and water today would be<br/>\ngreatly improved since our great-grandparents&#39; time...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again, arguing something like this is tantamount to arguing<br/>\nreligion, and will go nowhere.<br/>\nSo everyone can feel free to go back and forth on this, but I find<br/>\nit doubtful that this will go anywhere too useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may at least serve the useful purpose (as I see it) of keeping us all<br/>\nfrom getting too confident that our worldviews are complete and absolute.<br/>\nI&#39;ve had to reconsider some of my views, and that&#39;s always a good thing, as<br/>\nit keeps me from getting complacent; and it&#39;s possible I&#39;m not the only one.<br/>\nOne can hope not, at any rate.<br/>\nIf I&#39;ve waxed a little sharp on this subject - and under provocation, I<br/>\nhave - I hope you will all pardon me.  But please bear in mind that much of<br/>\nthe commentary I&#39;ve seen on this subject has taken for granted that a number<br/>\nof ideas related to my own religion are unquestionably and obviously false:<br/>\nand I think most of us are liable to get a little touchy when we hear that<br/>\nsort of thing.  After all, any religion (and any paradigm) can be made to<br/>\nlook ridiculous if one addresses the matter with certain assumptions firmly<br/>\nin place.<br/>\n        Blessings and good faring, all.<br/>\n                Gereg</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2132393799\">Ladies and Gentlemen<br/>\nI have thought long and hard about commenting on this threat as it appears<br/>\nthat misunderstanding and ridicule may be the only rewards. However, I trust<br/>\nthat the following might be relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a student of Japanese swords for many years and having handled and<br/>\nclosely studied thousands in this time, this is what I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Shinto religion, many things are credited with having a spirit and<br/>\nthe sword is not an exception. However, this was then and now is now. When<br/>\none picks up a sword of great antiquity and of historical importance, a<br/>\nsensitive and sympathetic person cannot help but be greatly impressed. The<br/>\nsugata, texture of the steel and the activities in the hamon will convey the<br/>\nbeauty and grace of the sword if the viewer has the necessary expertise to<br/>\nunderstand and appreciate it. It is possible in some cases to see and begin<br/>\nto understand the spirit the maker has imbued in the sword and maybe his<br/>\ncharacter also. For instance, a sword from the often flamboyant Osaka Shinto<br/>\nschool quite obviously reflects the somewhat brash nature of that city at<br/>\nthe time. However, I think in many ways this is similar to seeing the<br/>\ntortured emotions of Van Gogh in one of his paintings. But to attribute this<br/>\nto a mystical force is probably ill-advised in this day and age. It<br/>\nsurprises me that martial arts people feel that a &quot;sword is talking to them&quot;<br/>\nwhen this does not seem to be the case with those more familiar with swords<br/>\nunless being able to learn when, and where it was made and maybe its<br/>\nhistorical context by close scrutiny, may be considered as communication<br/>\nwith the sword. I have always considered that in Japanese sword study, kendo<br/>\n(or Iai-do) is the practical side of the academic study of Japanese swords,<br/>\nbut that it is all kendo in the final analysis and both are equally<br/>\nimportant and need to be undertaken together. In other words, kendo people<br/>\nare missing a great deal by having no understanding of the Japanese sword<br/>\nand the reverse also applies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are taught to view swords calmly and in a relaxed and unexcited manner<br/>\nwhether we are looking at a National Treasure or a kazu-uichi-mono. In this<br/>\nway we will see everything that the sword has to offer. It may not talk to<br/>\nus, but the educated and informed viewer will know the sword intimately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I&#39;ve not bored you to death with the above and that it at least makes<br/>\na modicum of sense.<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nClive Sinclaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tom.davidson@...\">tom.davidson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 14, 2004 12:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: swords (was ...Eras)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a significant difference between appreciation and mystique.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One can appreciate the craftsmanship of a sword, a piece of<br/>\n&gt; calligraphy, a poem, a blossom, a tank, and F1 racing car ...<br/>\n&gt; in fact just about anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of my favourite sights, when working in an office overlooking<br/>\n&gt; S London (low skyline) was Conorde on the Heathrow approach.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But that does not mean I am subject to the mystique of the thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have often wondered whether the mystique - the mystery - of the<br/>\n&gt; sword stands in some way as a marker of man&#39;s removal, or distance,<br/>\n&gt; from that which the sword represents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think the sword carried quite as much &#39;spiritual<br/>\n&gt; significance&#39; to the Sengoku and earlier samurai.

It was during this period that <br/>\nwe see the greatest number of carvings on sword blades and the majority of <br/>\nthese were religeous in nature. The sword in addition to being a weapon was <br/>\na talisman. At the time the signature, carvings, fittings and even temper-<br/>\nline were seen to carry good or bad fortune. Not just the sword but his <br/>\narmour as well often carried symbols of his belief in certain deities or <br/>\nsects. Yes they stood in the line and saw for themselves the awesome power <br/>\nof the sword and for that reason they fervently said their prayers and were <br/>\nconvinced a good sword was more than just good steel. The swords passed<br/>\ndown <br/>\nto us today were preserved because they were of better make but also<br/>\nbecause <br/>\nthey saved Great-Granpas rear on some long ago battlefield.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;The names of sword, as discussed,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nowe nothing to mystique, more to about how someone came into&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\npossession of the blade.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great swords of old were appreciated from the time of the first Shogun <br/>\nand before.

That&#39;s the impression that&#39;s grown on me over<br/>\nthe past thirty-some years of practise.  I will admit that it&#39;s an<br/>\ninterpretation of available phenomena that is open to argument, but that&#39;s<br/>\nmy view.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ...Sure, my swords let me know if they haven&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; used in too long, but<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not as if they have to be used _on_ somebody.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*cocked eyebrow* Um, and HOW exactly do they do this?<br/>\n\tUntil you&#39;ve been guilt-tripped by a sword that feels neglected, you&#39;ve<br/>\nnever been guilt-tripped.  &quot;How&quot; is a very reasonable, but somewhat<br/>\ndifficult, question to answer, as the most natural response falls into the<br/>\n&quot;If you have to ask, I can&#39;t explain it&quot; category - a category that holds so<br/>\nmuch specious crap in this world that I really hate to place another datum<br/>\ninto it.  Particularly one that I care about.  Let&#39;s just say - until I get<br/>\nmy brains back again as I kick this flu - that the spirit of the sword makes<br/>\nit very clear to my own spirit that it hasn&#39;t been out dancing in too long.<br/>\nNot, to be honest, that I believe that description will convince you:  but<br/>\nthere it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;       And your point would be...?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You asked me what my criteria was. Or rather, you were<br/>\noffended without knowing the criteria. So I gave it to<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n\tWell, truth to tell, I didn&#39;t get offended.  (Maybe I should use some of<br/>\nthose silly &#39;emoticons&#39; after all... NAAAAH.)  That was my sense of humour,<br/>\nsuch as it is, at work.  I regret that you took this aspect of what I had to<br/>\nsay even remotely seriously.  Swords have spirits?  Serious.  Offended?<br/>\nChallenge you to a duel?  Joke.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I choose Main Battle Tank. Mine&#39;s an M1A2--yours?<br/>\n&gt;       Y&#39;know, I had a strong suspicion you were going to<br/>\n&gt; take this kind of<br/>\n&gt; unsporting attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unsporting? Not at all. It&#39;s only fair for each of us<br/>\nto use something we are trained with, correct? My<br/>\nbackground is with tanks. Hence, my choice of weapon.<br/>\nUse a sword if you wish. It&#39;s magical soul will<br/>\nprotect you from 120mm APFSDS-T, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n\tNate - apostrophising the possessive &quot;its&quot;?  Tsk, tsk.  Now:  having struck<br/>\nat you on the battleground of words, allow me to answer you more directly:<br/>\nmy swords&#39; spirits I regard as no more &quot;magical&quot; than my own.  (As I recall,<br/>\nthe term &#39;kami&#39; can technically be applied to anything possessing a spirit,<br/>\nincluding humans and trees:  the idea here is not dissimilar.)  Please bear<br/>\nin mind that while I have seen considerable magic in my life, I do not<br/>\nbelieve in the supernatural.  I do, however, regard nature as a much bigger<br/>\nbox than human science has succeeded in enclosing... or ever will.<br/>\n\tAs to protecting me from whatever ammo that is (isn&#39;t it?), I repeat my<br/>\ncomplaint about the Boxer Rebellion. Likewise the Amerindians&#39; Ghost Dance.<br/>\nI tend to believe that the sheer fact of belief itself has a fair amount of<br/>\npower, so that (and I&#39;m oversimplifying grossly here) if a man with a sword<br/>\nfaces off with a man with a rifle, and they both believe in the power of<br/>\ntheir weapons, the power of each belief tends to cancel out the belief of<br/>\nthe other, leaving the functional power of certain forces that do not rely<br/>\non belief... or have been believed in for long enough to have established<br/>\nmore of a foothold in reality...  I refer here to mundane matters like the<br/>\nlaws of physics, muzzle velocity and the kinetic energy inherent in a sharp<br/>\npiece of steel swinging.<br/>\n\tThere&#39;s an equation in there that I do not fancy.<br/>\n\t&quot;Unsporting...&quot;  Well, let&#39;s put that in perspective:  that is the<br/>\nfavourite cry of the losing sides in the technology wars throughout history,<br/>\nis it not?  The French knights said it about the English longbowmen, the<br/>\nlongbowmen said it about harquebusiers (and so did the samurai, for that<br/>\nmatter)...  It&#39;s an ancient and well-worn excuse, and I think it&#39;s good for<br/>\nanother round or so yet.<br/>\n  There&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; only one weapon suited for a civilised disagreement<br/>\n&gt; between gentlemen:  the<br/>\n&gt; sword.  It&#39;s the Mythically Correct solution.<br/>\n&gt;       ...Of course, if you&#39;re going to remind me that<br/>\n&gt; neither of us could in fact<br/>\n&gt; be considered a gentleman under the very definitions<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m calling for (and it<br/>\n&gt; would be just like you to do that), then I&#39;ll have<br/>\n&gt; no more telling response<br/>\n&gt; than to run like hell (unless I can arrange to be<br/>\n&gt; closer to you than you are<br/>\n&gt; to your M1A2 when our negotiations reach this<br/>\n&gt; unhappy stage).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Closer won&#39;t help you--you&#39;d have to know how to start<br/>\nthe thing. :)<br/>\n\tUm... truth to tell, within the utterly facetious scenario I was<br/>\nenvisioning, by positioning myself closer to your chosen weapon than you, I<br/>\nhad some hopes of preventing _you_ from starting the damned thing!  Knowing<br/>\nnothing whatsoever about your hand-to-hand skills, I&#39;d still rather take you<br/>\non with no weapons aside from our bodies... than let you get inside a tank.<br/>\nCall it shallow and narrow-minded of me.<br/>\n\tUnsporting, even.<br/>\n\tGereg</div>",

Swords are very cool indeed, and<br/>\n&gt; since they&#39;ve kept me<br/>\n&gt; fascinated and actively growing for the past<br/>\n&gt; forty-odd years, I&#39;m not sure<br/>\n&gt; whether I resemble that &quot;all freaky&quot; remark or not.<br/>\n&gt; ...I feel so insulted.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you imbue your sword with some kind of mystic<br/>\ndogma?<br/>\n\tHmm.  Well, that&#39;s not at all the way I&#39;d describe it, Nate, but I have a<br/>\nsneaking suspicion that you would regard my answer to that question as a<br/>\n&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>\nDo you believe that once drawn a sword has to<br/>\nbe used, or it will implode?<br/>\n\tHeh.  I&#39;ve met a couple of guys like that.  &quot;Sure you can see my sword:&quot;<br/>\n(here you get the benefit of the best Dark Smouldering Glance he can<br/>\nmanage:)  &quot;but it must taste blood before it is sheathed again...&quot;   Good<br/>\nmanners only require you to get out of earshot before you start laughing.<br/>\nNo, unless the person is known to come out of an unbroken cultural tradition<br/>\n(and I think the Ghurkas are the about only ones this still applies to<br/>\ntoday... and at that, I&#39;m not sure the oral tradition is true regarding them<br/>\neither), then I&#39;ve found this view to be one of the surest signs of an ego<br/>\non legs rather than a martial artist.  Almost without exception, there&#39;s a<br/>\nlot less skill than mouth wearing that blade.<br/>\n...Sure, my swords let me know if they haven&#39;t been used in too long, but<br/>\nit&#39;s not as if they have to be used _on_ somebody.  What _is_ the proper use<br/>\nof a sword, indeed?  The Heiho Kaden Sho of the Yagyu discusses the idea of<br/>\nthe &quot;Life-Giving Sword&quot; - and I think Munenori (wasn&#39;t it he?) was working<br/>\ntoward an idea that is still worth developing today.  If the sword is<br/>\nimportant still - and I am not alone in a profound conviction that it is -<br/>\nthen it&#39;s important that the idea of using a sword should continue to<br/>\nevolve.  This is the line of thinking that has led to every &quot;michi&quot; (or<br/>\n&quot;do&quot;) approach growing out of the old &quot;jutsu&quot; forms of the Japanese weapon<br/>\narts.  Yes, a good sword should be used.  It&#39;s an insult to the sword not to<br/>\ndo so.  But the best use of the sword is not - with blessed few exceptions -<br/>\nto cut down a life.  That, as the Yagyu book suggests, ought properly to be<br/>\nreserved for those times when one person&#39;s evil has come to a peak.  And<br/>\nmodern law generally puts it in rather similar, if less poetic, terms.<br/>\nDo you really think that<br/>\npiece of steel is your soul?<br/>\n\tMine?  No, my soul is complicated enough without having to incorporate a<br/>\ndozen or so good pieces of steel.  A decent sword tends to develop its own<br/>\nsoul, or something suspiciously like one, if used with respect.  It could be<br/>\nsomething of an awakening process rather than development, I&#39;m not honestly<br/>\nsure.  I only know that I get a sense when someone&#39;s &quot;home&quot; in a blade, and<br/>\nit leaves me with a very clear understanding of why the tradition might<br/>\narise of the sword being the soul of the bushi.<br/>\nAs long as you answered &quot;no&quot; to these, you&#39;re not a<br/>\nfreak.<br/>\n\tAnd your point would be...?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How to handle this sense of wounded dignity in a<br/>\n&gt; mature and rational<br/>\n&gt; manner - ha!  Got it!<br/>\n&gt; Nate, we&#39;re going to have to have a duel.<br/>\n&gt;       Gereg<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only if I get to choose weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI choose Main Battle Tank. Mine&#39;s an M1A2--yours?<br/>\n\tY&#39;know, I had a strong suspicion you were going to take this kind of<br/>\nunsporting attitude.  Nah, I figure, we&#39;re on a Japanese history list, so<br/>\nthose Euro-centric, &quot;I-challenge-so-you-choose&quot; rules don&#39;t apply.  There&#39;s<br/>\nonly one weapon suited for a civilised disagreement between gentlemen:  the<br/>\nsword.  It&#39;s the Mythically Correct solution.<br/>\n\t...Of course, if you&#39;re going to remind me that neither of us could in fact<br/>\nbe considered a gentleman under the very definitions I&#39;m calling for (and it<br/>\nwould be just like you to do that), then I&#39;ll have no more telling response<br/>\nthan to run like hell (unless I can arrange to be closer to you than you are<br/>\nto your M1A2 when our negotiations reach this unhappy stage).<br/>\n\tThis is what I hated about the Boxer Rebellion, too.<br/>\n\t\tGereg</div>",
