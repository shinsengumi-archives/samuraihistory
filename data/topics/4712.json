Such was his shame that he, too, sought <br/>\nout the Yagyu school and began a period of intensive training. <br/>\nEventually, having mastered the sword, and thus himself (and <br/>\nthus his habits) he asked his wife for a re-match.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two faced each other, and immediately the wife could see <br/>\nthe man she married, put down her sword and offered it to him <br/>\nto dispose of at his pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, it remained within the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nA story, but a good story always has the ring of truth.
