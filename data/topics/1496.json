Yamaga <br/>\nSoko wrote different things about bushido than Daidoji Yuzan or <br/>\nYamamoto Tsunetomo. And Nitobe Inazo&#39;s discussion of bushido is again <br/>\ndifferent. As a matter of fact, the term &quot;bushido&quot; was not even used <br/>\nvery much before the end of the 19th century, when there was no <br/>\nwarrior class any more. All authors who write on bushido are saying a <br/>\nlot of similar things, but when you read the details, where they <br/>\ndiffer, you notice that they had rather different thoughts on this <br/>\nmatter. <br/>\nI would really like to read your impressions on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nMax<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, TIMOTHY HEATON <br/>\n&lt;jahladracul@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- &quot;shogun.uk&quot; &lt;shogun.uk@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I really do consider that there should be some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; degree of exclusion in operation to prevent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stupidity and ignorance, such as that exhibited by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this person, poluting the &quot;group&quot;.
