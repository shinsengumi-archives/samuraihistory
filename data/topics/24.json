The material is divided into various subjects, rather than various<br/>\ncomplete letters. There are vivid descriptions of body mutilations, and the<br/>\nopinion of some of the correspondents was that to know a Japanese was to<br/>\nknow an executioner. Remember, part of this period was during the Sengoku<br/>\nJidai, and at one, Kyoto was in ruins, and the Emperor was reduced to<br/>\nbegging with a bowl.

[1863_edo.doc]<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThe following excerpt is from the November, 1863 issue of Harper&#39;s New Monthly Magazine. It is part of a lengthy article entitled &quot;Pictures of the Japanese&quot;. While the article as a whole is extremely complimentary of all aspects of Japan&#39;s lifestyle, I found the following paragraph to be refreshing in a naive sort of way. I would love to see this article republished in its entirety.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One of the first things which strikes us in our studies of street life in Yeddo is that there are two classes wholly distinct in manners, habits, and character. The official class, consisting of the nobles, with their throngs of idle retainers, and the common people. The retainers of the nobles, known as Samourai or Yaconin, are entitled to wear two swords. They are the perfect types of the Swashbucklers once so common in the European cities; swaggering, blustering bullies, usually drunk, and always insolent, loitering about the drinking houses, ready to give a thrust or a blow to any one who comes in their way, and especially prone to insult foreigners. They constitute the only dangerous class in Yeddo; to them is to be charged the long series of outrages and murders which have marked the history of foreign missions to Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The common people, on the other hand, are a remarkably good-tempered, quiet race; ingenious, industrious, and courteous always...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting? I can&#39;t help but wonder if the Samurai of a previous era would look upon these later &quot;Samurai&quot; as something of an anomaly. Is this the same group of guys who ushered in such concepts as being &quot;insulted&quot; if someone&#39;s scabbard touched theirs, and some of the other mannerisms emulated today as proper Samurai etiquette?<br/>\n==================================================<br/>\n(9).

Lady Mariko was based on Gracia Hosokawa and her father<br/>\n&gt; was Akechi Mitsuhide.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who are interested there was a nice little book published after <br/>\nthe TV mini-series by Univ. California Berkeley Press called I believe <br/>\n&quot;Learning from Shogun&quot;. It is a series of essays by Japanese history <br/>\nscholars and one Elizabethan scholar comparing the &quot;history&quot; in Shogun <br/>\nwith real Japanese history. Very interesting, as I remember they thought <br/>\nCavell (sp) had done his homework, but had changed things for dramatic <br/>\npurposes, though heaven only knows the real history was dramatic enough. <br/>\nThe Toranaga character was based upon Iyeyasu and the time frame of the <br/>\nnovel/series was the 6-8 months before Sekigahara. A big example of how <br/>\nhistory was changed is the character of Mariko. This character certainly <br/>\nis based upon Gracia Hosokawa, but her story is considered one of the 3 <br/>\ngreatest love stories in Japanese history. Her husband Hosokawa so loved <br/>\nhis wife that he did not have her killed when Akechi killed Oda. Instead <br/>\nhe had her sent to a remote castle for 5 years. Out of sight is out of <br/>\nmind, and when the political heat came down after Hideyoshi was totally <br/>\nin power, the Gracia re-appeared in her husband&#39;s family. The prudent <br/>\nthing for the Hosokawa to do would have been to kill her immediately. <br/>\nAfter all the Hosokawa themselves could have been destroyed with such a <br/>\nready made excuse. This husband and wife love story is at complete odds <br/>\nwith the Shogun story. Then there was the problem that Gracia Hosokawa <br/>\nis supposed to have become a Christian, but there is no record of her <br/>\never even seeing a Jesuit from a distance. Her baptism was via one of <br/>\nher ladies in waiting who was a Christian. There is no record of her <br/>\nknowing any language but Japanese. But, Shogun is a rip roaring yarn <br/>\nthat certainly catches the flavor of Japan in 1600.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW the Blackthorne character is real also and based very nicely on Will <br/>\nAdams. An example of Chavell (sp) homework: the name of the Dutch ship <br/>\nwas &quot;Erasmus&quot; in the novel. Adam&#39;s Dutch ship was called &quot;Das Liefe&quot;, <br/>\nbut it had a different name earlier in its career as a ship--&quot;Erasmus&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Prough<br/>\n==================================================<br/>\n(10).

Not too much specifically about the sword, but a<br/>\nwonderful book. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else read it?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nMichael A.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:59 PM 9/7/97 +1000, Barry T. wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I thought a better read of Will Adams was in a book by an English(?) author<br/>\n&gt;in the early 1930s called &quot;The Needle Watcher&quot;.
