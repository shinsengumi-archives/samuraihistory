He was born under the name Takigawa in 1540 <br/>\nand died in 1612. He was the adopted son of Maeda Toshihisa (brother <br/>\nof Maeda Toshiie) and became a ronin after Toshiie took over control <br/>\nof the clan (seems as if he was a great fighter but lousy at <br/>\nfollowing orders). Around the time of Sekigahara he served the Uesugi <br/>\nunder yet another name, Hyottosai Kokuzoin. After Sekigahara he <br/>\nbecame a ronin again. Like Yagyu Jubei (and to an extant Musashi), <br/>\nhis wanderings as a ronin and disappearances from mainstream history <br/>\nled to a lot of idle speculation and exaggerated stories.<br/>\nGame designers sure like him-he&#39;s been in Kessen along with Samurai <br/>\nWarriors and the Onimusha series.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1403273976\">While doing some research on Akechi Mitsuhide, I came<br/>\nacross a website that lists his daughter Hosokawa<br/>\nGracia&#39;s original name as &quot;Tamako&quot;. I&#39;d always thought<br/>\nher Japanese name was &quot;Tama&quot;, no ~ko. I noticed also<br/>\nthat many of the women&#39;s names mentioned in Sansom<br/>\n(just finished volumes 1 and 2 recently) have the ~ko<br/>\nsuffix, which I always thought was a rather modern<br/>\nphenomenon, dating largely from the beginning of this<br/>\ncentury. While I know ~ko names existed back<br/>\nthroughout history, I didn&#39;t think it was all that<br/>\ncommon. And then I see &quot;Tamako&quot; instead of Tama, so<br/>\nknow I&#39;m wondering if this is a &quot;modernization&quot; after<br/>\nthe fact by some historians/authors/whomever, who<br/>\nassume that all Japanese female names have a ~ko (and<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been following pop Japanese naming trends,<br/>\nwith the proliferation of Amis, Ayumis, Ais, Hatsumis,<br/>\nJuris, Nanas, Sayuris, etc.) so they just added it on<br/>\ntheir own. I&#39;m fairly sure Mitsuhide&#39;s daughter was<br/>\n&quot;Tama&quot; with no ~ko. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nY!

Apparently Maeda Keijiro made an<br/>\nappearance in one episode, though it doesn&#39;t explain<br/>\nmuch. While it is a TV show, generally the NHK dramas<br/>\ncan be viewed as &quot;mostly&quot; historical, and so I&#39;d<br/>\nassume that he was a real person. <br/>\n<br/>\nA little while later I found this site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shungansho.fc2web.com/meguruhito/maeda.htm\">http://shungansho.fc2web.com/meguruhito/maeda.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not got the time to get out the denki jisho and<br/>\ntranslate it, but a brief glance shows he was an<br/>\nadopted son of Maeda Toshiie, and at the time of<br/>\nSekigahara served Uesugi Kagekatsu. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
