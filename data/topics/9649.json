The Japanese Imperial family is the longest unbroken line of rulers in history.<br/>\n-Training and weapons......complex subject depends on the region, time period individual preference etc you could write a book on the one subject alone.<br/>\n-Diamyo........ Yes they were the lords of the samurai, but they WERE samurai, like a modern day general, who leads soldiers but is also a soldier himself and commands and fights along side of them. Also he was the head of the clan and ruler of a region, a province or several provinces, that may or may not be fully autonomous and therefore had authority over EVERYTHING that went on in his lands.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps it is a very complex subject and this is only the short answer.<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: shannon fenella <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2007 7:45 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  hello,<br/>\n  for a project on school I am making a survey about the samurai. I have some questions:<br/>\n  - whenn the shoguns ruled japan there was no emperor, was there?<br/>\n  - can someone tell me something about the training of the samurai? or information about the wapens they used and how?<br/>\n  - who exactly were the daimyo? As far I understand they were the lords of the samurai, but did the daymio fight also?<br/>\n  - I would like to know something about the influence of confucius on the life of the samurai.<br/>\n  thanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  shannon<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Live.nl: je eigen persoonlijk startpagina met nieuws en feeds die JIJ belangrijk vindt!<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.live.com/getstarted.aspx\">http://www.live.com/getstarted.aspx</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
