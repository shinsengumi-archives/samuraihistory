That said, they serve the same sort of function as say The<br/>\n&gt;Patriot does for understanding the U.S. Revolutionary War. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have a great point here. I also saw (and really enjoyed) THE PATRIOT. On <br/>\none hand, it used a historical background. But it was a fictional account set <br/>\nagainst this historical background. I think that SEPPUKU had a similar format <br/>\nand intent. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Is it a historical source? By in large, no. Is it purely &quot;entertainment&quot;, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;this is too harsh. Chanbara films are much more of the entertainment <br/>\n </span></blockquote>variety, but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;even here the well made chanbara film, such as Yojimbo, can expose the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>novice to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the atmosphere of the periond in which it is set.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that films like SEPPUKU, SEVEN SAMURAI, and YOJIMBO raise issues <br/>\nrather than intending to be depictions of actual history. SEVEN SAMURAI raises the <br/>\nissue of class differences and YOJIMBO raises the issue of the ending of an <br/>\nera. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, SEPPUKU raises more issues than the other two do. It&#39;s such a <br/>\nmulti-level film, which is why it is a masterpiece. Just in my opinion, and <br/>\nI&#39;m neither a crendentialed historian nor a film expert, but I believe that <br/>\nSEPPUKU outdoes either YOJIMBO and SEVEN SAMURAI. But all these films are <br/>\nmasterpieces.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFilms like these were not intended to be accounts of actual history. Instead, <br/>\nthey pose a &quot;jumping-off&quot; point for researching actual history.<br/>\n<br/>\nNina</div>",

Though I <br/>\npersonally don&#39;t see it as &quot;entertainment&quot; but we&#39;re probably just talking <br/>\nsemantics here.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I agree with one of the other posters that in this regard, films are best <br/>\n&gt; used as &#39;jumping off points&#39; to inspire someone to conduct further research.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly the point I was trying to make. And probably was not very <br/>\nclear about it. Which actually is the reason why I see SEPPUKU as more than just <br/>\n&quot;entertainment.&quot; It certainly isn&#39;t claiming to be a depiction of exact <br/>\nhistory. It&#39;s not saying that, in real life, there truly existed a ronin named <br/>\nTsugumo Hanshiro who avenged the death of his son-in-law Chijiiwa Motome by taking <br/>\nseveral top-knots and slaying several other members of the Ii clan. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some points of entertainment. I also loved the part where Tsugumo <br/>\ntosses the topknots at the Ii clan, and loved their shocked reaction. But <br/>\nunlike most &quot;noble ronin&quot; chambara films (which I LOVE, by the way), SEPPUKU goes a <br/>\nlot further. I don&#39;t get that &quot;jumping off&quot; inspiration to study real history <br/>\nwhen watching most of the chambara/jidai-geki films that I watch.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSEPPUKU goes way beyond just &quot;noble ronin&quot; entertainment. It has raised <br/>\nissues. It has made me want to do actual historical research. It was a &quot;jumping <br/>\noff&quot; point. And in that way, it has value to me as a tool for studying history. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I&#39;m making myself a bit more clearer than mud.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNina</div>",
