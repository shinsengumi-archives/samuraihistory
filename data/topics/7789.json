            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1348305665\">Hello, Mr. Wood. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I got caught up in a different discussion on some other threads<br/>\nconcerning &quot;modern samurai&quot; and inserted the grammatical correction. Sorry<br/>\nyou were offended, I meant no offense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to address the two points in your post in different responses<br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t want to bend anyone&#39;s ears too much in some of my rather<br/>\nlong-winded commentary. &lt;g&gt; In this post, I&#39;ll address the issue of ronin<br/>\nand seppuku and the 47 Ronin. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I read THE 47 RONIN STORY by John Allyn and I remember the part where<br/>\nhe explains that, as ronin (as opposed to samurai affiliated with a clan),<br/>\nthat the 47 Ronin would not normally have the right of seppuku. My own<br/>\nresearch and other readings show that this statement is not true. Ronin<br/>\ncommmited seppuku throughout Japanese history and as far as I know, no one<br/>\never questioned their right to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust an aside: when studying historical events, it&#39;s best to consult more<br/>\nthan one source. I remember questioning this statement by Allyn (that ronin<br/>\nwere not entitled to commit seppuku) when I read his book and went to<br/>\nconsult other sources and accounts. What I found in most of these other<br/>\nsources contradicts what Allyn had posited about ronin and seppuku. Mainly,<br/>\nI found some original sources from the period when this event happened<br/>\n(early 18th century); they are contained in English translation in Hiroaki&#39;s<br/>\nbook LEGENDS OF THE SAMURAI. These sources contradicted what Allyn stated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Allyn was, however, quite correct in that there was a discussion and<br/>\ndispute over whether the 47 former Ako retainers should be allowed to commit<br/>\nseppuku. In LEGENDS OF THE SAMURAI, Sato presented some writings by Japanese<br/>\nscholars and officials of the early 18th century. These writings had varying<br/>\nviewpoints on what penalty, if any, that the 47 Ako ronin should be subject<br/>\nto. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe debate that raged was over the fact that the 47 former Ako retainers had<br/>\ncommited a vendetta against the laws that were in effect at the time. In<br/>\nthose days, commiting a vendetta without having received official permission<br/>\nwas a crime that normally would merit execution as common criminals. So<br/>\nnormally, the former Ako retainers would merit that punishment -- whether<br/>\nthey were ronin, samurai, commoners, whoever.  It wasn&#39;t their position as<br/>\nronin in society that entered into this debate, it was the nature of the<br/>\nlaws that had been broken. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the bakufu officials believed that the 47 former Ako retainers<br/>\nshould be exonerated completely and allowed to return to their homes. They<br/>\nreasoned that the 47 had corrected a bakufu mistake in that Lord Asano had<br/>\nbeen punished but that Lord Kira had not been punished. By rights, they<br/>\nargued, both parties should have been given the punishment of seppuku for<br/>\nwhat had happened in the castle two years previously. Other bakufu officials<br/>\nbelieved that, as the 47 Ako ronin had committed a vendetta without<br/>\ngovernment sanction, that they were therefore common criminals and should be<br/>\ntreated as such i.e. executed. A compromise was reached in that the Ako<br/>\nronin would have to die for their actions, but that they would be allowed to<br/>\ndie by seppuku rather than be executed as criminals. And that is what<br/>\nhappened. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is helpful.
