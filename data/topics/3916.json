The fastest way to do this is to subjugate the neighboring <br/>\nwarlords. This is an action that results in the death of his father and younger brother and <br/>\nnot the least brings him to the attention of Hideyoshi and not in a good way either but <br/>\nintervention by the regents nephew Hidetsugu and Maeda Toshiie save his neck <br/>\nalthough he is forced to move to a smaller fief and send his wife to Kyoto as hostage. <br/>\nAlthough curbed of his lofty ambitions his friendship with Hidetsugu again lands him in <br/>\nhot water when Ishida Mitsunari arranges the downfall of the &#39;Unfortunate Hidetsugu&#39;, <br/>\nToshiie and Ieyasu save his neck and the flamboyant young warlord is sent to Korea <br/>\nwhere he wins great honors. Upon his return Hideyoshi is dead and Masamune allies <br/>\nhimself with Tokugawa Ieyasu thus assuring the survival of the Date family.

Recently the owner of a large Chicken company in Kyoto Prefecture and his wife committed suicide after the company had been found to have continued selling their produce despite a huge number of chicken deaths due to Chicken Influenza. He did not kill himself because of a dishonourable, dangerous business decision, but because he was found out by the authorities. This was no &#39;honourable&#39; act of seppuku of death over surrender.<br/>\nThis tragic case is not alone. Reactionary bureaucratic corruption, a political and construction industry gravy train, marital infidelity, and widespread school bullying, to name a few other examples are rife (although obviously not just in Japan). A previous mailer correctly wrote that what is honourable is what is right (admittedly a subjective point of view, but there is always a certain lex naturae inherent in all societies), not just doing what is demanded of you (ie, obedience). Education in Japan, from Kindergarten to Uinversity is designed to cultivate a rigid hierarchical structure, where the uniformity of the &#39;ganbare&#39; attitude creates soild, unsurprising employees, rather than aspiring individuals. Before anyone accuses me of Japan-bashing, I am not. I live in this society, am married into it, and now work within its education system. <br/>\nThe Chushingura epics, or other historical figures like Sugawara Michizane or Minamoto no Yoshitsune are exemplars to be looked upto in Japanese society, not models for life. <br/>\nM.

What you had said seemed <br/>\nnot only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  <br/>\nYou had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense <br/>\nof honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos <br/>\nwere well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their <br/>\nsystem of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  <br/>\nIn fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a <br/>\nconformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must <br/>\nfit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is <br/>\nlost.<br/>\n  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s not because teenage boys couldn&#39;t find a girlfriend.  <br/>\nStudents, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot <br/>\nbear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.<br/>\nFor someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such <br/>\nblindness will prevent learning.  That&#39;s what this group is all <br/>\nabout.  Not making a snappy remark to make someone else look stupid.  <br/>\nIn this case, it was the snappy remark thet made Kyle look stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon  <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To Kyle Segall:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see <br/>\n </span></blockquote>below) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. <br/>\nThe point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it <br/>\nin the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai <br/>\nclass placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and <br/>\ntheir familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against <br/>\nNobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his <br/>\nfamily.

My response to this that there is lots of room left for &quot;honor&quot;. Honor is more than just acts of loyalty or bravery, it is also the manner in which you conduct yourself. Where I come from deals are made with a handshake, and if I give my word, I keep my word. And when I am long gone nobody can say they got screwed by me. Is there not honor in this? Certainly all samurai didn&#39;t call out challenges, this practice was dependent upon the status of the man as well as the time period you are talking about.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-998713802\">Now Kyle, I like that.  You have been fair with all of us by <br/>\nexplaining what you meant. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have some thoughts about the whole lineage thing.  I&#39;m not an <br/>\nexpert, so I hope Tony will correct me if I&#39;m way off.  I do believe <br/>\nthe practice of one on one combat existed in the early samurai <br/>\nperiod.  Even in the Gempei war many challanges were shouted to foes <br/>\nbased on the existing honor system.  Many Samurai did call out their <br/>\nlineage before a battle.  Although it seems silly to us now, we have <br/>\nto remember how isolated Japan was from the rest of the world.  They <br/>\nhad a system of fighting wars that was very different than any <br/>\nother...Until the Mongols invaded.  Then the Samurai began to wise <br/>\nup.  &quot;Hey, these Mongols don&#39;t really care about our family do they?&quot;  <br/>\nMy understanding is that the Japanese were totally unprepared to <br/>\nfight a war with an organized mongolian military machine.  The <br/>\nKamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But the samurai were <br/>\nprepared the second time, and the preparations/strategic philosophies <br/>\nthat followed changed the face of Samurai warfare.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInto the Sengoku is when Ashigaru are much more apparent in the <br/>\narmies.  Long after the lineage practice had been proven unwise by <br/>\nthe Mongols (I know, they were actually Korean and Chinese <br/>\nconscripts).  So at this point I can&#39;t see them doing it either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany years later, after a couple hundred years of peace, under the <br/>\nTokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is about the point that <br/>\nBushido is crystalized into what we know today.  Prior to the <br/>\npeaceful Edo Jidai, much of the &quot;honor sytem&quot; wasn&#39;t based on those <br/>\nhigh and holy precepts that everyone thinks the samurai lived by.  It <br/>\nwas only in the last years of the samurai that the bushido code would <br/>\ninfluence the population.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, I too get a little sick of generalizations.  I recently went <br/>\nto a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai and Kensei.  We were <br/>\ninformed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido code.  They were <br/>\nwarriors and role models that were bound by honor to better society.  <br/>\nThey helped everyone gain greater understanding by standing for <br/>\npeace, justice, and the American way (well, they didn&#39;t really say <br/>\nthat, but they might as well have).  Upon hearing this, I could hear <br/>\nTony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There were good and bad <br/>\nSamurai.  They didn&#39;t all live honorable and they Bushido code didn&#39;t <br/>\naffect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you must agree that they <br/>\nhad some system of honor.  How else could we quantify a good or bad <br/>\nsamurai?  But it wasn&#39;t &quot;Bushido&quot; persay.  Since &quot;Bushido&quot; did not <br/>\nexist in the Sengoku, it probably wasn&#39;t used to keep the troops in <br/>\nline.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate their troops but it may <br/>\nhave been much more simple and less dubious than you presume.  <br/>\nPromises of fame and fortune, political status, social status, pride, <br/>\nand land are other methods that could be used to obtain loyalty.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, I don&#39;t think that there was a universal conspiracy by <br/>\nleaders of the time, to devise a system to keep a brotha down.  That <br/>\nwas not the &quot;purpose&quot; of honor or bushido, although it (like anything <br/>\nelse) could be perverted and warped to serve sinister means.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kyle Segall&quot; &lt;<br/>\nklancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Try a little more than Shogun.

I <br/>\n  &gt;   believe this concept is a sort of fake conciencnesse created <br/>\n  created <br/>\n  &gt;   by the people at the top to make loyal soldiers to die for their <br/>\n  &gt;   battles battle.

This honor includes not to kill another.<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   What does everybody else think?<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   Thanks for listening<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   Jonny<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   Vladilen Blackthorne &lt;vladilen_blackthorne@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   I&#39;m new to this site and I do not know much about samurai. <br/>\n  But I <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   hope I have found a group that does know.

It could , like many things, bring peace of mind, positive loyalty, and a good world however it does not.   <br/>\n <br/>\n Thanka for listening<br/>\n <br/>\nJonny<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Anthony J.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2026282108\">Please don&#39;t get me wrong, I am sure that there are a great deal of honourable people in modern Japan (perhaps more, perhaps less than elsewhere, who counts?) but I think what we see by and large is not &#39;honour&#39; but &#39;face&#39;. Recently the owner of a large Chicken company in Kyoto Prefecture and his wife committed suicide after the company had been found to have continued selling their produce despite a huge number of chicken deaths due to Chicken Influenza. He did not kill himself because of a dishonourable, dangerous business decision, but because he was found out by the authorities. This was no &#39;honourable&#39; act of seppuku of death over surrender.<br/>\nThis tragic case is not alone. Reactionary bureaucratic corruption, a political and construction industry gravy train, marital infidelity, and widespread school bullying, to name a few other examples are rife (although obviously not just in Japan). A previous mailer correctly wrote that what is honourable is what is right (admittedly a subjective point of view, but there is always a certain lex naturae inherent in all societies), not just doing what is demanded of you (ie, obedience). Education in Japan, from Kindergarten to Uinversity is designed to cultivate a rigid hierarchical structure, where the uniformity of the &#39;ganbare&#39; attitude creates soild, unsurprising employees, rather than aspiring individuals. Before anyone accuses me of Japan-bashing, I am not. I live in this society, am married into it, and now work within its education system. <br/>\nThe Chushingura epics, or other historical figures like Sugawara Michizane or Minamoto no Yoshitsune are exemplars to be looked upto in Japanese society, not models for life. <br/>\nM.

What you had said seemed <br/>\nnot only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  <br/>\nYou had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense <br/>\nof honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos <br/>\nwere well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their <br/>\nsystem of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  <br/>\nIn fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a <br/>\nconformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must <br/>\nfit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is <br/>\nlost.<br/>\n  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s not because teenage boys couldn&#39;t find a girlfriend.  <br/>\nStudents, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot <br/>\nbear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.<br/>\nFor someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such <br/>\nblindness will prevent learning.

What you had said seemed <br/>\nnot only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  <br/>\nYou had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense <br/>\nof honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos <br/>\nwere well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their <br/>\nsystem of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  <br/>\nIn fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a <br/>\nconformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must <br/>\nfit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is <br/>\nlost.<br/>\n  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s not because teenage boys couldn&#39;t find a girlfriend.  <br/>\nStudents, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot <br/>\nbear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.<br/>\nFor someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such <br/>\nblindness will prevent learning.  That&#39;s what this group is all <br/>\nabout.

The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your <br/>\nfather were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad <br/>\nfamily.

There are men <br/>\nand women today that fight and die with honor.I think that perhaps <br/>\nyour definition of honor is different than mine.  I see that honor <br/>\nand loyalty can be independent of eachother.  Honor is synonymous <br/>\nwith integrity.  The unfying moral character of a person that binds <br/>\nthem to do what is right at all time.  At times, having honor means <br/>\nthat you must overlook your loyalty to do what is right.  If I am <br/>\nloyal to an evil Daimyo (shameless attempt to relate message to group <br/>\nsubject) does that make me a person with honor?  If I am carrying out <br/>\nthe orders of a ruthless bloodthirsty man, do I have honor?  The evil <br/>\nin this world is as much the child of evil men as the good men who do <br/>\nnothing about it. <br/>\nIn the military, having honor may mean disagreeing with your <br/>\nsuperior.  In the case of war, it may mean disobeying an unlawful <br/>\norder.  Under the Law of Armed Conflict, all military people are <br/>\ntaught to abide by certain rules of engagement.  It doesn&#39;t matter <br/>\nhow loyal you may be to your Commander.  If he orders an attack on an <br/>\nillegal target; you disobey or you do not have honor...you have a <br/>\njail sentence with hard labor.<br/>\nI think that most people have some sense of honor (maybe I&#39;m wearing <br/>\nrose colored glasses).  Most people care about how others see them.  <br/>\nHonor in a small sense is what drives people to conform to social <br/>\nnorms.  Most people want to be good.  They want to do the right <br/>\nthing.  <br/>\nI do think loyalty is important.  It is paramount to use reason and <br/>\nobjectivity with loyalty or you could find yourself in deep poop.  <br/>\nDoing the right thing is more important than pleasing the right <br/>\npeople.<br/>\n(stepping off soapbox)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon<br/>\n<br/>\n --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Emine SELBES&quot; &lt;<br/>\nemineselbes@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; yes, yes, yes,<br/>\n&gt; honour is just about forgotten in the world, following the collapse <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; feudal families;<br/>\n&gt; being a member of such a family myself, honour and loyalty are two <br/>\n </span></blockquote>musts of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my life;<br/>\n&gt; strange how few people agree,<br/>\n&gt; i work for a multinational company and we had a work-shop last <br/>\n </span></blockquote>weeek<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; todetermine the core values for our company<br/>\n&gt; so few people voted for loyalty!!!<br/>\n&gt; regards<br/>\n&gt; emine </span></blockquote></div>",

The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai class placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and their familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your pedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has dozens of acounts.
