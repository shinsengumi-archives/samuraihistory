With two warriors <br/>\n  destined to aid her, she begins a search for six more so that <br/>\n  together they may destroy the curse and free the land of evil. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Review: Legend of the Eight Samurai had previously been reviewed <br/>\n  based on the original American version that had been heavily edited <br/>\n  and stuck with dreadful English dubbing, both of which turned the <br/>\n  film into a muddled, live-action cartoon. Left unedited and with the <br/>\n  original Japanese soundtrack, this fantasy jidai geki from yakuza <br/>\n  film master Kinji Fukasaku becomes an epic fantasy adventure with <br/>\n  Sonny Chiba and his action team delivering dazzling battles <br/>\n  sequences, both conventional and otherworldly. Making it even better <br/>\n  are vampy villains, an early &#39;80s soft rock soundtrack, outrageous <br/>\n  costumes, and elaborate special effects, culminating in a rollicking <br/>\n  mix of period samurai action by way of Flash Gordon and Zu: Warriors <br/>\n  from the Magic Mountain. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Eight Samurai came out at a time when period, costumed dramas in <br/>\n  Japan were in decline. Director and co-writer Kinji Fukasaku, best <br/>\n  known for revitalizing the yakuza film in the early &#39;70s with <br/>\n  stylized depictions of self-destructive anti-heroes, dove into the <br/>\n  jidai geki arena while envisioning a new breed of samurai film that <br/>\n  wasn&#39;t locked into the well-established conventions of the genre. <br/>\n  Samurai Reincarnation was his first attempt, yet by his own <br/>\n  admission, Legend of the Eight Samurai came far closer to matching <br/>\n  his ambitions. According to author Patrick Macias, it was to have <br/>\n  been the starting point for a series of films that never emerged, <br/>\n  despite the relative success of Fukasaku&#39;s previous swordplay films. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Eight Samurai is based in part on a series of mythic, 19th century <br/>\n  tales that were originally adapted into plays, radio programs and <br/>\n  early films. Co-screenwriter Toshio Kamata stripped down the series&#39; <br/>\n  innumerable cast of characters and authored a novel that became the <br/>\n  basis for this film. <br/>\n<br/>\n  One-time pop idols Hiroko Yakushimaru and Hiroyuki Sanada (The <br/>\n  Twilight Samurai) are paired up respectively as the brave Princess <br/>\n  Shizu and the brash footman and samurai-wannabe Shinbei, both of <br/>\n  whom become unlikely lovers caught up in a nightmarish world where <br/>\n  an eyeball-devouring old witch transforms into a giant centipede and <br/>\n  demons in human form command armies of murderous samurai and vixens <br/>\n  who breath and bleed deadly poison. With her clan cursed and wiped <br/>\n  out by a pair of vengeful souls reincarnated as immortal demons, <br/>\n  Shizu&#39;s only hope is to find eight warriors destined from birth to <br/>\n  aid her in destroying this evil. This includes the fighting monk <br/>\n  Dosetsu Inumura (Sonny Chiba) and his gun-totting companion, a <br/>\n  female assassin for hire (Etsuko Shihomi), a musician, a cave-<br/>\n  dwelling warrior, a young boy, a remorseful samurai in the demons&#39; <br/>\n  employ, and Shinbei himself. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Kinji Fukasaku creates a dark, yet vibrant fantasy world with <br/>\n  colorfully theatric costuming and sets and lots of magical special <br/>\n  effects from giant, flying serpents that carry their victims away to <br/>\n  dazzling light effects and pyrotechnics. The lead villains are made <br/>\n  memorable by scenes (mild by today&#39;s standards) of skinning the <br/>\n  flesh off young women or bathing nude in a bubbling pool of blood. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Implanted among this imagery is the top-notch action choreography of <br/>\n  Sonny Chiba and his Japan Action Club. After owning the screen in <br/>\n  the &#39;70s when it came to urban karate action, Chiba had turned his <br/>\n  sights to the period drama and increasingly, sci-fi or fantasy-<br/>\n  oriented films like the time-traveling G.I. Samurai (1979). Legend <br/>\n  of the Eight Samurai is an ambitious work with Chiba&#39;s proteges <br/>\n  Hiroyuki Sanada and Etsuko Shihomi both delivering excellent action <br/>\n  performances. As an assassin with a love-hate relationship with one <br/>\n  of the demons and an initial rivalry with one of her peers, Shihomi <br/>\n  shows off her swordplay skills on numerous occasions. With Chiba in <br/>\n  a supporting role, Sanada gets the lion&#39;s share of the heroic action <br/>\n  and it&#39;s well deserved. Throughout the film, he&#39;s seen carrying on <br/>\n  casual conversations while on a very spirited horse, swinging from <br/>\n  tree to tree like Tarzan, and deftly wallowing into a mob of <br/>\n  attackers with twin kama that look like straightened sickles. <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are a number of enjoyable fights, but the heroes&#39; storming of <br/>\n  the demon castle to save the captured princess is by far the film&#39;s <br/>\n  high point. There is a strong Conan the Barbarian feel to much of <br/>\n  the film, but particularly here where those giant snakes come into <br/>\n  play again and our explosives and sword-slinging heroes battle armed <br/>\n  grunts, traps and sorcery. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The only thing missing from Legend of the Eight Samurai is a <br/>\n  suitable soundtrack. Rather than go strictly with traditional <br/>\n  Japanese music, the filmmakers opted for pop music, specifically <br/>\n  soft rock and a theme song by John O&#39;Banion that could easily fit in <br/>\n  on a Time-Life compilation with the likes of Foreigner and Jefferson <br/>\n  Starship. Honestly, I despised it the first time through with the <br/>\n  American editing and English dubbing. But it works better with the <br/>\n  original Japanese version and should evoke a sort of nostalgic feel <br/>\n  for anyone who has fond memories of watching other fantasy movies of <br/>\n  the era like The Neverending Story and Ladyhawke. <br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/47ved\">http://tinyurl.com/47ved</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n  Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n  --- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Yahoo!
