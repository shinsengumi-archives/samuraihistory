I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthere will be many problems.&quot; With his comments, the Prime Minister <br/>\nwas buying into Japan&#39;s hottest topic: the problem that there are no <br/>\nmales to succeed the current heir, 43-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmperor Akihito is 71 and in 2002 had surgery for prostate cancer, <br/>\nalthough he appears to have made a full recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut concerns about succession in the world&#39;s oldest hereditary <br/>\ndynasty have lead to reports this week in the Asahi Shimbun <br/>\nnewspaper of a government &quot;feasibility study&quot; on the idea of a <br/>\nfemale heir.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly if there is a change can the throne one day be occupied by <br/>\nPrincess Aiko, the only child of the Crown Prince and his 41-year-<br/>\nold wife, Princess Masako.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrown Prince Naruhito&#39;s younger brother, Akishino, also has no sons, <br/>\nand a male from another branch of the ruling family would inherit <br/>\nthe throne.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Japans-PM-backs-option-of-\">http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Japans-PM-backs-option-of-</a><br/>\nempress/2004/12/03/1101923338147.html?oneclick=true</div>",
