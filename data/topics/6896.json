            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1619106992\">Dear Group:<br/>\nHi, I am not an expert on sword except for the fact<br/>\nthat I was trained in one of 24 style techniques(sword<br/>\ntechnique) from Chosun dynasty when I was in the<br/>\nmiddle school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only had a chance to read messages on an informal<br/>\nKorean Martial Arts website with regard to this issue<br/>\na few years ago.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cafe.chosun.com/clubmain.do?p_club_id=muye)\">http://cafe.chosun.com/clubmain.do?p_club_id=muye)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere, I found the following:<br/>\n1) Curved blades were originally adopted by a<br/>\nMongolian Army of Chengiskan because of its<br/>\nsuperiority over the straight blade in the the<br/>\nmultiple melee in the battlefields.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) After the Mongol conquest of China and Korea, the<br/>\ncurved blade was naturally introduced to the North<br/>\nEast Asia.<br/>\nIts benefits were soon recognized in this region.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The technique of producing the curved blade is<br/>\ngenerally more complex than that of the straight<br/>\nblade. So, it was not produced until that time.(I do<br/>\nnot know the sepecific period)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) It may be conceivable that the use of curved blades<br/>\nwere imported to Japan either through Korea or China<br/>\nafterwards.(again, I do not know the exact period)<br/>\nBut, in about a century later, the superior quality of<br/>\nthe Japanese sword was well known in the North East<br/>\nAsia.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) The Chinese traditionally had martial arts teaching<br/>\nthe use of two edged straight sword. After the Mongol<br/>\nconquest and their numerous skirmishes with the<br/>\nJapanese pirates on their coast during Mying dynasty<br/>\nmade it popular to teach the use of the one edged<br/>\ncurved sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) People who provided the above information were<br/>\nprofessional historians and martial artists in South<br/>\nKorea. So, I believe that it is a very credible<br/>\nsource.

I <br/>\nmight have said &quot;not completely&quot; and left it at that. As we know from <br/>\nOgasawara Sensei and the fine exhibition at the Sanno Museum; the <br/>\nshape and construction of the early Japanese warabite-to combined <br/>\nwith continental swordmaking techniques to give us the Wan-to <br/>\n(Japanese sword).<br/>\n\tPart of that process was combining different steels and <br/>\nlearning to control the curvature in a blade sometimes over thirty <br/>\ninches in length. The explanation for the presence of uchisori <br/>\n(reverse curve at the tip) on tanto, as given to me, is that the <br/>\nsmiths, understanding that the blade would curve on yaki-ire, made <br/>\ntheir blades with reverse curve. A little too much and the blade <br/>\nwould still have a hint of that reverse curve when finished, done <br/>\njust right the sori produced when the blade was heated and cooled <br/>\nproduced a perfectly straight blade. As time went on tanto too took <br/>\non more curvature.<br/>\n\tNow how much of this was experimentation and how much was <br/>\napplication of knowledge learned in the field, I don&#39;t think we can <br/>\nsay though later changes in shape show just how quickly popular <br/>\nstyles of construction spread.Favoring the idea that it was work by <br/>\ndesign. In fact in my original post I didn&#39;t say just where or when <br/>\nthat &quot;happy accident&quot; might have happened. I am more inclined to <br/>\nbelieve that it was a Chinese smith who first put a hard edge into a <br/>\nsoft bodied sword and produce curve in the process. The Japanese <br/>\neither learned it from their neighbors, in which case it was likely <br/>\nwell understood by the time it got to Japan, or they had to &quot;relearn <br/>\nit&quot; for themselves, getting that curve to &quot;work for them&quot; as Dean <br/>\nsaid...<br/>\n-t</div>",

It seems<br/>\nthat as sori was first introduced in the nakago area(where there is no clay)<br/>\nthis must have been intentional. Of course I agree with you that a skilled<br/>\nswordsmith has control over all aspects of sword making being able to<br/>\ncontrol and dictate the kind of sori at will (saki-soroi, koshisori etc.)<br/>\nAs to Rod&#39;s original question, only very early swords were straight (Nara<br/>\nperiod and earlier) and mostly these were not thought to be of Japanese<br/>\nmanufacture but imported from the Asian mainland along with the technology.<br/>\nThe true Japanese sword as we would recognise it today, was perfected in the<br/>\nHeian period and is still made today, well after Meiji. Also both tachi and<br/>\nkatana are made basically the same way, although the shape of tachi tend to<br/>\nbe more slender and graceful than most katana (gross generalisation and<br/>\noversimplification!)<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nClive Sinclaire<br/>\nwww.to-ken.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;tom helm&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junkmail@...\">junkmail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 03, 2005 4:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] SWORD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rod et al-<br/>\n&gt; A skilled smith ultimately has control over all aspects of<br/>\n&gt; the finished product.
