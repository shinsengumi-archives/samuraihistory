To show the quality of his craft,<br/>\n&gt; Muramasa placed his blade in the streambed in such a way that the<br/>\n&gt; edge just broke the surface. As the leaves floated by, they were<br/>\n&gt; neatly cut in two, and Muramasa recovered his blade, proud of his<br/>\n&gt; craftsmanship.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Masamune then placed his blade in the stream. This time, as the<br/>\n&gt; leaves floated along, the were deflected to the left and right,<br/>\n&gt; slipping past the blade, as it were, without harm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This story is used to exemplify the difference between the two<br/>\n&gt; smiths, but the tale is apocryphal, the two men lived about 200 years<br/>\n&gt; apart, but it does demonstrate the reputation of their blades.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Muramasa was noted for &#39;bad luck&#39; blades, and I have read somewhere<br/>\n&gt; he might have suffered from some mental disability, perhaps<br/>\n&gt; schizophrenia (quite how this is arrived at, I have no idea).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu had an antipathy towards Muramasa blades, he cut<br/>\n&gt; himself with one as a child, his grandfather was killed with one and<br/>\n&gt; when his son committed seppuku, the kaishaku used a Muramasa blade.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ieyasu let it be known that his men should get rid of them if they<br/>\n&gt; owned one, and Muramasa blades became prized possessions amongst his<br/>\n&gt; enemies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question - is the &#39;ill luck&#39; reputation of Muramasa blades founded<br/>\n&gt; on Ieyasu&#39;s antipathy, or is there evidence of this prior to the<br/>\n&gt; Tokugawa?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thomas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Sadler:<br/>\n<br/>\nTokugawa Nobuyasu&#39;s seppuku was overseen by Hattori Hanzo, who <br/>\nhad been despatched by Ieyasu, along with one of Ieyasu&#39;s <br/>\nretainers, Amakata Michitsuna, to see the matter through.<br/>\n<br/>\nHattori is, of course, Ieyasu&#39; famous &#39;ninja chief&#39; and <br/>\nNobuyasu requested the man to act as his kaishaku. When it came <br/>\nto it, Hattori was so emotional he could not act, and Amakatsu <br/>\nstepped forward to administer the coup de grace.<br/>\n<br/>\nIeyasu had told both men before their despatch that his son was <br/>\ninnocent and that the plot would at some time be shown to be a <br/>\nslanderous rumour.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn their return, there was not a dry eye in the house. Both men <br/>\nwere troubled by the task undertaken, and both Honda Tadakatsu <br/>\nand Sakakibara Yasumasa (2 of the shi-tenno - &#39;the 4 pillars of <br/>\nthe Tokugawa&#39;) wept aloud.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And of what make was the wakizashi with which the second <br/>\nstruck off his head?&quot; asked Ieyasu. &quot;Muramasa,&quot; came the reply. <br/>\n&quot;How ominous!&quot; he remarked. &quot;It was a Muramasa blade that <br/>\nstruck down my grandfather, and when I was a child I cut myself <br/>\nwith one by accident, and now my son is killed by one. Muramasa <br/>\nblades bode ill for our house. If any of you possess one, he <br/>\nhad better get rid of it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLater Ieyasu observed &quot;Even such a devil as Hanzo does not care <br/>\nto cut off the head of his master,&quot; (which does little to <br/>\nreinforce the idea of the ninja as heartless murderers).<br/>\n<br/>\nAmakatsu, on hearing this, sensed an ominous tone in Ieyasu&#39;s <br/>\nwords and took himself off with all haste to Mount Koya, and <br/>\nlater took service with Hideyoshi.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lady Tsukiyama was put to death at another time and another <br/>\nplace, and another retainer, Nonaka Shigemasa, oversaw <br/>\nproceedings - so the Muramasa link to her might be apocryphal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",

To show the quality of his craft, <br/>\nMuramasa placed his blade in the streambed in such a way that the <br/>\nedge just broke the surface. As the leaves floated by, they were<br/>\nneatly cut in two, and Muramasa recovered his blade, proud of his<br/>\ncraftsmanship.<br/>\n<br/>\nMasamune then placed his blade in the stream. This time, as the<br/>\nleaves floated along, the were deflected to the left and right,<br/>\nslipping past the blade, as it were, without harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis story is used to exemplify the difference between the two<br/>\nsmiths, but the tale is apocryphal, the two men lived about 200 years <br/>\napart, but it does demonstrate the reputation of their blades.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuramasa was noted for &#39;bad luck&#39; blades, and I have read somewhere<br/>\nhe might have suffered from some mental disability, perhaps<br/>\nschizophrenia (quite how this is arrived at, I have no idea).<br/>\n<br/>\nTokugawa Ieyasu had an antipathy towards Muramasa blades, he cut<br/>\nhimself with one as a child, his grandfather was killed with one and<br/>\nwhen his son committed seppuku, the kaishaku used a Muramasa blade. <br/>\n<br/>\nIeyasu let it be known that his men should get rid of them if they<br/>\nowned one, and Muramasa blades became prized possessions amongst his<br/>\nenemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question - is the &#39;ill luck&#39; reputation of Muramasa blades founded<br/>\non Ieyasu&#39;s antipathy, or is there evidence of this prior to the<br/>\nTokugawa?<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
