They were under the service of and dedicated<br/>\n&gt; fully to a daimyo or lord. most Were paid in rice, which was farmed by<br/>\n&gt; the underclass which were not allowed to wear the swords. Any samurai<br/>\n&gt; who wished to test out his new shinken or (real sword),for a price<br/>\n&gt; could cut down a criminal who had been caught as Japan had no prisons.<br/>\n&gt; Death was the customary punishment for every offense. Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; samurai would cut down innocent people to test their steel if no one<br/>\n&gt; was looking but this was most likely not the norm. Samurai means to<br/>\n&gt; serve and a samurai was also called bushi being the plural or bujin<br/>\n&gt; for one of them. Most of Japan&#39;s population consisted of lower class<br/>\n&gt; farmers however until later on in the history when Japan began to<br/>\n&gt; adopt more western ways. Guns were introduced by the first europeans<br/>\n&gt; but not given or sold to them one man made a sketch of one of the guns<br/>\n&gt; and within 6 months there were guns aplenty. The samurai adopted their<br/>\n&gt; use for a short time until they were considered dishonorable and the<br/>\n&gt; samurai abandoned there use willingly. The use of a jo or staff was<br/>\n&gt; the weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and the main weapon of<br/>\n&gt; the lower class to defend against the samurai. Then there were the<br/>\n&gt; Ninja. This was an illegal occupation but Hattori Hanzo who was ninja<br/>\n&gt; is mentioned in the history as bushi. They were the spies and assasins<br/>\n&gt; of old japan and were hired out by a diamyo to obtain information or<br/>\n&gt; deal with an enemy lord. They employed many dishonorable tactics and<br/>\n&gt; devices including throwing venomous snakes on their foes. Samurai<br/>\n&gt; would stand and state their name and such before fighting in duels<br/>\n&gt; which usually lasted 30 seconds or less.Ninja did not and snuk around<br/>\n&gt; and disguised themselves and such. Ninja were more effective in combat<br/>\n&gt; than most samurai though and usually acted alone. Slaying a sleeping<br/>\n&gt; army and other similar antics. Honor meant everything to the samurai<br/>\n&gt; and they would not hesitate to commit hara kiri done with the<br/>\n&gt; wakizashi one would stick the blade into his gut with the goal of<br/>\n&gt; cutting the spine from the front then another would end his suffering<br/>\n&gt; with a beheading. Someone the former had chosen to assist him in<br/>\n&gt; restoring his honor. A samurai could probably take down a charging<br/>\n&gt; bull but I would not expect the could have tussled succesfully with a<br/>\n&gt; grizzly bear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That was bloody sensational.</div>",

Before the 1590&#39;s,<br/>\n&gt; that would be a complete fallacy. Even during the Edo<br/>\n&gt; period, commoners were allowed to carry personal<br/>\n&gt; protection weapons, to include short swords.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any samurai<br/>\n&gt;&gt; who wished to test out his new shinken or (real<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sword),for a price<br/>\n&gt;&gt; could cut down a criminal who had been caught as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Japan had no prisons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Japan most definitely had prisons. Not sure where the<br/>\n&gt; hell you came up with that one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Death was the customary punishment for every<br/>\n&gt;&gt; offense. Sometimes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; samurai would cut down innocent people to test their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; steel if no one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; was looking but this was most likely not the norm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Me? No, I didn&#39;t cut that guy down...you didn&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; me, did you? Nope, wasn&#39;t me...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Samurai means to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; serve and a samurai was also called bushi being the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; plural or bujin<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for one of them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bushi&quot; isn&#39;t the plural of &quot;bujin&quot;. Japanese has no<br/>\n&gt; plural or singular--the plural of &quot;bushi&quot; is &quot;bushi&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; the singular of &quot;bushi&quot; is &quot;bushi. Plural or singular<br/>\n&gt; is determined by context or counters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Guns were introduced by the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; first europeans<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but not given or sold to them one man made a sketch<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of one of the guns<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and within 6 months there were guns aplenty.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow, this is so wrong it&#39;s not even funny. There&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; possible way that someone who&#39;d never seen one before<br/>\n&gt; could make a sketch of an arquebus and then create<br/>\n&gt; one. The swordmaker of the lord of Tanegashima island,<br/>\n&gt; where the first Portuguese landed and demonstrated<br/>\n&gt; firearms, aquired several arquebuses, and was able to<br/>\n&gt; do everything except figure out how to seal the<br/>\n&gt; barrel. For the secret to this, he traded his daughter<br/>\n&gt; to a Portuguese merchant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt;&gt; samurai adopted their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; use for a short time until they were considered<br/>\n&gt;&gt; dishonorable and the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; samurai abandoned there use willingly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; God, no. No, no, no, no, and no. &quot;Dishonorable&quot; had<br/>\n&gt; nothing to do with anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The use of a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; jo or staff was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the main weapon of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the lower class to defend against the samurai.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Um, no.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; there were the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ninja.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stop. I can&#39;t even begin to read the idiocy you write<br/>\n&gt; here. Go to the link I posted, go read the section on<br/>\n&gt; ninja. You&#39;ve managed to post every single myth and<br/>\n&gt; Hollywood fantasy possible here, congrats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They employed many<br/>\n&gt;&gt; dishonorable tactics and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; devices including throwing venomous snakes on their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; foes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm...that&#39;s a new one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would stand and state their name and such before<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fighting in duels<br/>\n&gt;&gt; which usually lasted 30 seconds or less.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, Samurai stated their names and lineage prior to<br/>\n&gt; battle...a practice that died out before 1300, because<br/>\n&gt; it was completely impractical. This ended essentially<br/>\n&gt; during the Mongol invasions, since those nasty Mongols<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t play nice and simply shot the brave Samurai in<br/>\n&gt; the middle of his introduction speech.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ninja did<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not and snuk around<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and disguised themselves and such. Ninja were more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; effective in combat<br/>\n&gt;&gt; than most samurai though and usually acted alone.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Slaying a sleeping<br/>\n&gt;&gt; army and other similar antics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slaying a sleeping army? At once? Wow, those ninjers<br/>\n&gt; are Kool.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Honor meant<br/>\n&gt;&gt; everything to the samurai<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and they would not hesitate to commit hara kiri done<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wakizashi one would stick the blade into his gut<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with the goal of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cutting the spine from the front then another would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; end his suffering<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with a beheading. Someone the former had chosen to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; assist him in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; restoring his honor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yup, I saw in a comic book that some samurai called<br/>\n&gt; his friend by the wrong name, so to atone he cut his<br/>\n&gt; own stomach right then and there, without even<br/>\n&gt; thinking about it. Those samurai were always<br/>\n&gt; committing suicide...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No. And....no.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A samurai could probably take<br/>\n&gt;&gt; down a charging<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bull but I would not expect the could have tussled<br/>\n&gt;&gt; succesfully with a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; grizzly bear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, many samurai were successful economically,<br/>\n&gt; in both the prosperous and lean times...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ...or did you really mean to give your opinion vis a<br/>\n&gt; vis various animals? <br/>\n&gt; &#12414;&#12387;&#12383;&#12367;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?

Before the 1590&#39;s,<br/>\nthat would be a complete fallacy. Even during the Edo<br/>\nperiod, commoners were allowed to carry personal<br/>\nprotection weapons, to include short swords. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny samurai<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; who wished to test out his new shinken or (real<br/>\n&gt; sword),for a price<br/>\n&gt; could cut down a criminal who had been caught as<br/>\n&gt; Japan had no prisons.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Japan most definitely had prisons. Not sure where the<br/>\nhell you came up with that one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Death was the customary punishment for every<br/>\n&gt; offense. Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; samurai would cut down innocent people to test their<br/>\n&gt; steel if no one<br/>\n&gt; was looking but this was most likely not the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Me? No, I didn&#39;t cut that guy down...you didn&#39;t see<br/>\nme, did you? Nope, wasn&#39;t me...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Samurai means to<br/>\n&gt; serve and a samurai was also called bushi being the<br/>\n&gt; plural or bujin<br/>\n&gt; for one of them. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;bushi&quot; isn&#39;t the plural of &quot;bujin&quot;. Japanese has no<br/>\nplural or singular--the plural of &quot;bushi&quot; is &quot;bushi&quot;,<br/>\nthe singular of &quot;bushi&quot; is &quot;bushi. Plural or singular<br/>\nis determined by context or counters. <br/>\n<br/>\n Guns were introduced by the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; first europeans<br/>\n&gt; but not given or sold to them one man made a sketch<br/>\n&gt; of one of the guns<br/>\n&gt; and within 6 months there were guns aplenty.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, this is so wrong it&#39;s not even funny. There&#39;s no<br/>\npossible way that someone who&#39;d never seen one before<br/>\ncould make a sketch of an arquebus and then create<br/>\none. The swordmaker of the lord of Tanegashima island,<br/>\nwhere the first Portuguese landed and demonstrated<br/>\nfirearms, aquired several arquebuses, and was able to<br/>\ndo everything except figure out how to seal the<br/>\nbarrel. For the secret to this, he traded his daughter<br/>\nto a Portuguese merchant. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; samurai adopted their<br/>\n&gt; use for a short time until they were considered<br/>\n&gt; dishonorable and the<br/>\n&gt; samurai abandoned there use willingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>God, no. No, no, no, no, and no. &quot;Dishonorable&quot; had<br/>\nnothing to do with anything. <br/>\n<br/>\n The use of a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; jo or staff was<br/>\n&gt; the weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and<br/>\n&gt; the main weapon of<br/>\n&gt; the lower class to defend against the samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Um, no. <br/>\n<br/>\n Then<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there were the<br/>\n&gt; Ninja. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Stop. I can&#39;t even begin to read the idiocy you write<br/>\nhere. Go to the link I posted, go read the section on<br/>\nninja. You&#39;ve managed to post every single myth and<br/>\nHollywood fantasy possible here, congrats. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey employed many<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dishonorable tactics and<br/>\n&gt; devices including throwing venomous snakes on their<br/>\n&gt; foes. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm...that&#39;s a new one. <br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; would stand and state their name and such before<br/>\n&gt; fighting in duels<br/>\n&gt; which usually lasted 30 seconds or less.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, Samurai stated their names and lineage prior to<br/>\nbattle...a practice that died out before 1300, because<br/>\nit was completely impractical. This ended essentially<br/>\nduring the Mongol invasions, since those nasty Mongols<br/>\ndidn&#39;t play nice and simply shot the brave Samurai in<br/>\nthe middle of his introduction speech. <br/>\n<br/>\nNinja did<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not and snuk around<br/>\n&gt; and disguised themselves and such. Ninja were more<br/>\n&gt; effective in combat<br/>\n&gt; than most samurai though and usually acted alone.<br/>\n&gt; Slaying a sleeping<br/>\n&gt; army and other similar antics. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Slaying a sleeping army? At once? Wow, those ninjers<br/>\nare Kool. <br/>\n<br/>\nHonor meant<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; everything to the samurai<br/>\n&gt; and they would not hesitate to commit hara kiri done<br/>\n&gt; with the<br/>\n&gt; wakizashi one would stick the blade into his gut<br/>\n&gt; with the goal of<br/>\n&gt; cutting the spine from the front then another would<br/>\n&gt; end his suffering<br/>\n&gt; with a beheading. Someone the former had chosen to<br/>\n&gt; assist him in<br/>\n&gt; restoring his honor.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup, I saw in a comic book that some samurai called<br/>\nhis friend by the wrong name, so to atone he cut his<br/>\nown stomach right then and there, without even<br/>\nthinking about it. Those samurai were always<br/>\ncommitting suicide...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. And....no. <br/>\n<br/>\n A samurai could probably take<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; down a charging<br/>\n&gt; bull but I would not expect the could have tussled<br/>\n&gt; succesfully with a<br/>\n&gt; grizzly bear. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, many samurai were successful economically,<br/>\nin both the prosperous and lean times...<br/>\n<br/>\n...or did you really mean to give your opinion vis a<br/>\nvis various animals? &#12414;&#12387;&#12383;&#12367;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

They were under the service of and dedicated<br/>\nfully to a daimyo or lord. most Were paid in rice, which was farmed by<br/>\nthe underclass which were not allowed to wear the swords. Any samurai<br/>\nwho wished to test out his new shinken or (real sword),for a price<br/>\ncould cut down a criminal who had been caught as Japan had no prisons.<br/>\nDeath was the customary punishment for every offense. Sometimes<br/>\nsamurai would cut down innocent people to test their steel if no one<br/>\nwas looking but this was most likely not the norm. Samurai means to<br/>\nserve and a samurai was also called bushi being the plural or bujin<br/>\nfor one of them. Most of Japan&#39;s population consisted of lower class<br/>\nfarmers however until later on in the history when Japan began to<br/>\nadopt more western ways. Guns were introduced by the first europeans<br/>\nbut not given or sold to them one man made a sketch of one of the guns<br/>\nand within 6 months there were guns aplenty. The samurai adopted their<br/>\nuse for a short time until they were considered dishonorable and the<br/>\nsamurai abandoned there use willingly. The use of a jo or staff was<br/>\nthe weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and the main weapon of<br/>\nthe lower class to defend against the samurai. Then there were the<br/>\nNinja. This was an illegal occupation but Hattori Hanzo who was ninja<br/>\nis mentioned in the history as bushi. They were the spies and assasins<br/>\nof old japan and were hired out by a diamyo to obtain information or<br/>\ndeal with an enemy lord. They employed many dishonorable tactics and<br/>\ndevices including throwing venomous snakes on their foes. Samurai<br/>\nwould stand and state their name and such before fighting in duels<br/>\nwhich usually lasted 30 seconds or less.Ninja did not and snuk around<br/>\nand disguised themselves and such.
