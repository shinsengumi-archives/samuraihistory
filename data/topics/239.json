It<br/>\n&gt; was gernerally shorter than ordinary swords with a<br/>\n&gt; length of 18 to 20 inches. The blade tended to be<br/>\n&gt; wider. the Tsuba was larger than usual for greater<br/>\n&gt; strenght as it was used as a aid for climbing. the<br/>\n&gt; design Tsuba tended to follow popular design which was<br/>\n&gt; the lotus petal or sometimes it was square (Kyokaku<br/>\n&gt; Tsuba). The saya(scabbard) also differed in a number<br/>\n&gt; of ways , it was generally several inches longer than<br/>\n&gt; the blade this allowed a space at the bottom of the<br/>\n&gt; scabbard for the storage of Metsubishi, posions,or<br/>\n&gt; messages. Also in an emergency the scabbard was used<br/>\n&gt; for a snorkel when the Ninja hid under water.  The<br/>\n&gt; Ninja would use other swords apart from the Ninja To<br/>\n&gt; and the Katana these inclueded -: Shinkoro Gatana :<br/>\n&gt; this was a sword that had a serrated edge. Daito -: A<br/>\n&gt; large Battlefield Sword.  Futokorogatana-: short<br/>\n&gt; blades. Odachi-:long swords. Kodachi-: short swords.<br/>\n&gt; Shinobigatana-: Ninja sword. Others trick swords where<br/>\n&gt; used like a blade concealed in the Tsuka or the Teppo<br/>\n&gt; wakazashi which had the appearance of a normal<br/>\n&gt; Wakazashi but concealed a gun.<br/>\n&gt;  Hope this helps<br/>\n&gt; Ian<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Theron Gong<br/>\nPosted To: hoshinchat<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From my research, the use of the straight single edged sword, what is now<br/>\n&gt; known as a ninja-to, has less to do with the modern katana, and more with<br/>\n&gt; what came from China. It was after the time when Japan was using double<br/>\n&gt; edged straight swords (ken), that the HAN (cavalry?) sword went over. This<br/>\n&gt; was what we think of as a ninja-to, but is actually called a chokuto. It<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; before they discovered the clay heat treatment that katana&#39;s receive,<br/>\n&gt; therefore they did not have the curve that would be induced by that kind<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; quenching. They did not have the hard razor edge of a katana, and because<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; that is why much of our sword movement requires the whole body to push the<br/>\n&gt; blade through the target.<br/>\n&gt; Also, these were very early weapons, giving a sort of scale to compare the<br/>\n&gt; age of some of the schools. I don&#39;t think you would see these weapons<br/>\nduring<br/>\n&gt; the later periods for several reasons. One is that if everybody is using a<br/>\n&gt; curved blade, having a straight one will make you stick out, something<br/>\nevery<br/>\n&gt; stealth warrior would rather avoid. Second, they are inferior cutters to<br/>\n&gt; more modern katanas due to the heat treatment. And also, it would not be<br/>\n&gt; difficult to obtain a regular katana or wakizashi, either commissioned<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; a smith, or taken from any battlefield.<br/>\n&gt; I also don&#39;t think they were ever used as &quot;stepping swords&quot;, using the<br/>\n&gt; tsuba. If you look at the construction of a Japanese sword, you would see<br/>\n&gt; that all that would be holding your entire weight would be a thin disk of<br/>\n&gt; copper (seppa), which the tsuba lays on, pressing against the collar on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; blade (habaki), which in turn would press against a fairly thin wood<br/>\n&gt; scabbard (saya). Using it as such would make one if not all of the<br/>\n&gt; components to fail.<br/>\n&gt; Then we get into stuff like chissagatana, which is a wakizashi blade in<br/>\n&gt; katana fittings. So they think your using a katana, then you draw the<br/>\nfaster<br/>\n&gt; wak blade (though your body placement must be much more exact), with<br/>\n&gt; whatever little gadgets you hid in the rest of the saya.<br/>\n&gt; In the end, you have to remember Takamatsu&#39;s saying , quoted from one of<br/>\n&gt; Hatsumi&#39;s books,&quot;To discover the roots of ninjutsu, you must travel the<br/>\nSilk<br/>\n&gt; Road.&quot; Stuff flowed in from China and Korea long ago and was adapted and<br/>\n&gt; refined.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my thoughts,<br/>\n&gt; Theron Gong<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ian MacDaire<br/>\nPosted To: ninjutsu<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001 5:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: Ninjutsu The origins of the Ninja straight sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   The origin of the &quot;ninja straight sword&quot;? Two<br/>\n&gt; words...cheap blades.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Y&#39;see, hand forging a katana, using the traditional<br/>\n&gt; swordmaking arts and techniques, resulted in a<br/>\n&gt; remarkable and superior weapon. Well, provided that is<br/>\n&gt; it didn&#39;t turn into a bodge job, lot of things could<br/>\n&gt; go wrong especially in the tempering.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   There was a couple little problems with aquiring the<br/>\n&gt; hammerfolded work of a master sword maker. They were<br/>\n&gt; hella expensive. Some of the best works could cost you<br/>\n&gt; as much as buying, say, a small village. And they were<br/>\n&gt; handmade, which means they took a fair time to make<br/>\n&gt; -hence relatively short supply.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The mountain clans 1)weren&#39;t particularly wealthy<br/>\n&gt; people, and 2)for the most part lacked the connections<br/>\n&gt; needed in order to commision the superior katanas<br/>\n&gt; (back when and then, ya didn&#39;t just stroll into the<br/>\n&gt; forge-shop-showroom, plunk down some ducats, make<br/>\n&gt; nicey nice talk with the attractive sales help, and<br/>\n&gt; walk out with three feet of razor sharp perfection and<br/>\n&gt; beauty...you needed to be of the right class even to<br/>\n&gt; GET in the door, never mind sitting down with the<br/>\n&gt; master over tea to talk about your needs in the<br/>\n&gt; cutlery dept.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The ninja of old mostly couldn&#39;t afford those<br/>\n&gt; swords, even if they could get them made in the first<br/>\n&gt; place. They had to for the most part settle on DIY in<br/>\n&gt; swordmaking, like they did in most things in their<br/>\n&gt; lives (DIY is Do It Yourself, if anyone didn&#39;t already<br/>\n&gt; know).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Ninja DIY in swordmaking likely was based around<br/>\n&gt; rough forging of bar iron, and then stock reduction<br/>\n&gt; (grinding) to finished size and form. It could then be<br/>\n&gt; case hardened to steel during the tempering heatings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Using this type of techniques, the end result would<br/>\n&gt; be a blade that was straight instead of having the<br/>\n&gt; distinctive curve of the katana. It&#39;d be too much work<br/>\n&gt; to try and duplicate the curved blade shape with stock<br/>\n&gt; reduction, and it&#39;d also waste a lot more metal in the<br/>\n&gt; process. Ironically, the forging-smithing techniques<br/>\n&gt; used in producing hammerfolded steel naurally results<br/>\n&gt; in a curve to the blade...if you want it straight<br/>\n&gt; using these techniques, you have to rework things in<br/>\n&gt; subsequent forgings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Ninja produced blades would therefore tend to be<br/>\n&gt; straight. Not as good as the masterworks by a long<br/>\n&gt; shot, but they&#39;d have certain advantages. They were<br/>\n&gt; cheap to make, and the tools for doing the work were<br/>\n&gt; readily available in a farming community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The straight blade also lends itself better to<br/>\n&gt; certain sword styles of fighting, in that it can more<br/>\n&gt; readily exploit the chinks and weak points in samurai<br/>\n&gt; armour through a thrusting type of attack.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   So did the ninja of old just carry straight blades?<br/>\n&gt; Well...there was also another resource available to<br/>\n&gt; clan swordmakers, still working in the stock reduction<br/>\n&gt; techniques. That was, cutting down broken katanas. Of<br/>\n&gt; which in the Japan of the warring clan periods there<br/>\n&gt; would have been plenty to be found. Most of those<br/>\n&gt; swords would also be cheaper knockoff blades, made to<br/>\n&gt; look like the high quality ones (it is possible using<br/>\n&gt; stock reduction to get the curve, it just doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; result in a better blade...think of it as an example<br/>\n&gt; of human vanity, like kit cars today -Bently body on a<br/>\n&gt; Volkswagon chassis and engine, vroom vroooom Hey Baby,<br/>\n&gt; want a lift?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hope that was of some help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Ian Mac Daire(who does know his way around a forge,<br/>\n&gt; and has a sighty different definition of &quot;getting<br/>\n&gt; hammered&quot; from most folks.)<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Dominic Hobbs<br/>\nPosted To: ninjutsu<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; *clap-clap-clap*<br/>\n&gt; thankyou for an informative and entertaining explanation, very nice<br/>\nindeed.<br/>\n&gt; The only thing to add to that is, for those who don&#39;t know the bujinkan is<br/>\n&gt; made up of nine schools, only three of which are of ninja origin.

Interesting but not too surprising when you think these guys<br/>\n&gt; were sword fighters who now had to use sticks.<br/>\n&gt; Hmmm...   ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Duffry<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Insancio<br/>\nPosted To: ninjutsu<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my understanding that the ninja developed the straight sword as the<br/>\nantithesis to the samurai katana, even though many ninja families still held<br/>\ntheir family katana very sacred.  But, understanding that ninjutsu was<br/>\ndeveloped for survival and practicality, the straight sword was more<br/>\npractical, shorter, and lighter in weight than the samurai dai-katana.  And<br/>\nsince it had not been embued with the spiritual qualities of the katana, it<br/>\nwas more like a utility knife than a symbol of honor.  I believe the<br/>\nstraight ninjato came into serious use in the 1500s, and were usually forged<br/>\nfrom a single piece of steel, blade and tang together, for the greatest<br/>\nefficiency.  The could be produced very quickly and in great numbers (not<br/>\nhaving to go through the elaborate forging and honing of the curved samurai<br/>\nkatana).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was not usually carried on the back, as most ninja movies would have<br/>\nyou believe.  It was carried thrust into the sash at the side of the ninja.<br/>\nIt was carried on the back usually just to keep it out of the way while<br/>\nclimbing.  (Have you ever tried to effectively draw a ninjato while sheathed<br/>\non your back?  It ain&#39;t as easy as it looks.  You have to pull the scabbard<br/>\ndown at the same time that you are drawing up, and heaven help you if you<br/>\nhave short arms.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Nezumi<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sensei Rick<br/>\nPosted To: amitakun<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; this a great question...there is allot of contraversy about the ninja-to<br/>\nstraight sword..it is not in any history or any museums.The ninja did not<br/>\nform any of their own swords..the closest you can get to a ninja using a<br/>\nstraight sword would be a gardening blade but it looked nothing like the<br/>\nstraight blades you can get today.The common blade used was a shoto with a<br/>\ncurved blade.Train with the Samurai curved blade it is easier to manuever<br/>\nand pull from the sheath.<br/>\n&gt; Grand Master Takashi says there are no such things as a straight bladed<br/>\nninja sword,<br/>\n&gt; I agree with him<br/>\n&gt; Sensei Rick<br/>\n&gt; Amita K&#39;un Ryu<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Erica Meier<br/>\nPosted To: budotaijutsu<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From what I heard, the famed straight sword style actually from kabuki<br/>\ntheater.They had to devise a way to let the audience tell the difference<br/>\nbetween the &#39;good&#39;<br/>\n&gt; samauri and the &#39;bad&#39; ninja so they came up with a straight sword and a<br/>\nsquare tsuba. </span></blockquote></div>",
