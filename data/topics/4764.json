I know it&#39;s confusing, but I&#39;ll try to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmperor isn&#39;t a rank--you don&#39;t get &quot;promoted&quot; to it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a JOB, really. A hereditary one. <br/>\n<br/>\nShogun, also, isn&#39;t a rank--not in the sense of a<br/>\ncourt rank, which is what was being discussed. Kampaku<br/>\nalso isn&#39;t a &quot;rank&quot;, it&#39;s a job. Ieyasu didn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily &quot;outrank&quot; Hideyoshi because he made it to<br/>\nShogun and Hideyoshi was Kampaku--the two are<br/>\nessentially seperate entitites, with little or no<br/>\nties. <br/>\n<br/>\nDaimyo, again, is a description of someone&#39;s military,<br/>\neconomic, and political status, but not necessarily a<br/>\n&quot;rank&quot;. A daimyo was a daimyo was a daimyo, whether<br/>\nyou held 15,000 koku in Sado, or 3 million koku in the<br/>\nKanto--you were still a daimyo. What mattered was your<br/>\nincome and military strength. <br/>\n<br/>\nTaisho, again, is translated as general, but not in<br/>\nthe &quot;Brigadier General, Major General, etc.&quot; sense. It<br/>\nmeans someone who led a large group of soldiers into<br/>\nbattle. If you led 1,000 or 15,000, you were a taisho<br/>\neither way. It describes someone who led the<br/>\ntroops--in other words, like the rest, a job.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanks, as we mean with &quot;lower second rank&quot;, were ranks<br/>\naccording to the imperial ranking system devised in<br/>\nthe Heian period. I&#39;m by no means an expert--actually,<br/>\nI know very little. However, there were various<br/>\ngradations of rank, and each gradation was further<br/>\nsubdivided into lower, middle, and upper. So you could<br/>\nbe of &quot;Lower 5th rank&quot;, but that was more impressive<br/>\nthan someone of &quot;Upper 7th rank&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nTony&#39;s website, www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany <br/>\nhas a pretty good explanation on this, much better<br/>\nthan I could do. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
