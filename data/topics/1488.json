I tend towards <br/>\nwestern believes of good, evil and guilt and I do not find the concept <br/>\nof face as practiced by Japan to be honorable. I.E. if no one saw the <br/>\nevil deed then nothing happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe code of Bushido evolved after the bloody civil wars that united <br/>\nJapan. It was a method to stop the underlings from thinking about <br/>\nrevolting against their superiors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will once again bow to my western roots and state that I find the <br/>\nwestern concept of chivalric knight to be much more honorable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe books and topics recommended are all good ones, get thee to a library!<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;many samurai were crood and many were not ,time has<br/>\n&gt;offered us the power status of which a samurai came to<br/>\n&gt;be known but verious times shown those like kings over<br/>\n&gt;knights have not kept their vow and those that have<br/>\n&gt;made it their virtue in keeping their credit between<br/>\n&gt;them and the heavens and in turn those are the true<br/>\n&gt;samurai whom have done for a master intuition of<br/>\n&gt;gaining their keep sake untel they could survive on<br/>\n&gt;their own terms ,like holding a job against our<br/>\n&gt;beliefs long enough to earn what we feel we need to go<br/>\n&gt;are own way ,and to this is what many have done to<br/>\n&gt;keep a vow and some who left their master made groups<br/>\n&gt;of their own but many vannish like ghosts to be with<br/>\n&gt;the earth as their sword being their own master and<br/>\n&gt;were forgotten or sought out by their masters army.<br/>\n&gt;and those that were forgotten are the true keepers of<br/>\n&gt;the samurai way.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
