When Turnbull is speaking of historical ninja, what he writes is accurate (as borne out by many Japanese texts in my collection-although as noted in my last post, these events do not stand out as being anything other than regular samurai history in said texts. Japanese historical sources both primary and secondary are notoriously lacking in any reference to ninja as such, and in fact I would find any document that does somewhat Hayes-esque and suspect). When he is speaking of legends/myths etc, those are accurate. And when he is speaking of their role in popular culture, that is correct as well (the &#39;high school website&#39; stuff-I&#39;m unsure of what the &#39;pop culture&#39; image of the ninja is in the UK, but he has nailed the USA pop culture version). The Iga Ninja museum (which Turnbull draws heavily upon) goes along with pretty much everything in the book (and is a great place to visit-along with the whacked out nearby ninja theme park).<br/>\nI do agree (as indicated by my original post) that the earlier book is much better, in large part due to a greater focus on the historical ninja.<br/>\nBest of luck with the dojo!</div>",

I ask because I bought a Sojutsu DVD<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; was made by him <br/>\n&gt; &gt; because there is very little material available on<br/>\n&gt; that martial art <br/>\n&gt; in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; English.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I picked it up in a bookshop, glanced at the<br/>\n&gt; numerous<br/>\n&gt; pictures of black <br/>\n&gt; pyjama clad warriors with throwing stars and put it<br/>\n&gt; back down again. <br/>\n&gt; And went home and took a shower.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Seriously though, having briefly leafed through it,<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; does seem to <br/>\n&gt; contradict itself in that it tries to debunk some of<br/>\n&gt; the myths and ends <br/>\n&gt; up perpetuating those very same myths.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; considering 10 years ago Yurnbull wrote a bigger<br/>\n&gt; book<br/>\n&gt; on the Ninja this one was a seriously pathetic<br/>\n&gt; attempt<br/>\n&gt; at just making money<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He has taken comic book principles bits of hollywood<br/>\n&gt; and tried to pass it off as Ninja related material.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was shocked to see that he states that Ninja<br/>\n&gt; carried<br/>\n&gt; straight bladed swords. He obviously has done no<br/>\n&gt; research whatsoever into anything regarding ninja<br/>\n&gt; weapons, and he definately has not had any timeon<br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; hands to read forums etc. <br/>\n&gt; The straight ninja sword was 100% debunked by<br/>\n&gt; members<br/>\n&gt; of the Ninjutsu training community 15 years ago,<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; the source of that creation going back to Steve<br/>\n&gt; Hayes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was given the book as a gift and I wish I could<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; given it back. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wouldnt waste my money on it<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Paul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Paul,<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I look through the book I see that the artist drew<br/>\na picture of a square tsuba style sword in one panal<br/>\nbut also shows katana in the very next panal. <br/>\nTurnbull makes a point to mention katana, although on<br/>\npage 18 under the heading of &quot;<br/>\nStandard ninja equipment&quot; he says &quot;... for convenience<br/>\nthe ninja would choose a blade that was shorter and<br/>\nstraighter then usual.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
