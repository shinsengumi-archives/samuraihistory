            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-840179505\">Emperor, Shinto, Democracy:<br/>\nJapan&#39;s Unresolved Questions of Historical Consciousness<br/>\nby Herbert P. Bix  <br/>\nJune 14, 2005 <br/>\n <br/>\nJapanese archaeologists and historians have long rejected the <br/>\ngovernment&#39;s claim that Japan has had 124 emperors from the mythical <br/>\nJimmu, descendant of the Sun Goddess, to the controversial Showa <br/>\nEmperor Hirohito, whose pre-World War II reign brought havoc to <br/>\nAsian and Japanese people. The scholars recognize that most sites of <br/>\nancient imperial tombs should be treated as objects of scientific <br/>\ninquiry rather than as religious remnants of discredited State <br/>\nShinto. But bureaucrats of the Imperial Household Agency, claiming <br/>\nto follow the Imperial Household Law, interpret the rules and <br/>\ncontrol the tombs. They will neither allow the tombs to be treated <br/>\nas ordinary historical sites for investigation nor release copies of <br/>\ndocuments pertaining to them or to more recent emperors. Professing <br/>\nconcern for the peace, calm, and privacy of emperors, but really <br/>\nfearing public scrutiny of the imperial institution and <br/>\nits &quot;traditions,&quot; they continue to deny permission to excavate the <br/>\ntombs. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, Toike Noboru, a professor of imperial history at Den-en <br/>\nChofu University in Tokyo, invoked Japan&#39;s freedom of information <br/>\nlaw in his effort to make the numerous imperial tumuli that dot the <br/>\nJapanese countryside accessible to historical knowledge.[1] At stake <br/>\nis not only the possibility of writing a more lucid account of the <br/>\norigins of the Japanese people but also a less idealized history of <br/>\nthe modern imperial house. Blood myths of an unbroken line of <br/>\nimperial succession for ages eternal&quot; (bansei ikkei) and Japan as <br/>\na &quot;divine land&quot; (shinkoku) could be better understood. Indeed, the <br/>\nentire field of ancient Japanese history would benefit if the oldest <br/>\ntombs were excavated, and the question of the imperial family&#39;s <br/>\ndescent from Korea could be resolved. We might also learn more about <br/>\nwhy keepers of the imperial secrets go to such great lengths to <br/>\nconceal this strong likelihood. Even Emperor Akihito has said that <br/>\nthe mother of the so-called &quot;50th emperor,&quot; Kammu, had Korean blood <br/>\nand &quot;it made him feel a certain closeness to Korea.&quot;[2] <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Akihito has never said anything that could offer support to <br/>\nscholars who call for release of the historical papers of his <br/>\ndeceased father, Hirohito. Apparently the Japanese public lacks the <br/>\nright to learn more about the activities of its most important 20th <br/>\ncentury monarch. For how else to explain the failure to mount a <br/>\nmovement to revise laws and regulations of the Imperial Household <br/>\nAgency, which were enacted by the Diet and are, presumably, laws <br/>\nlike any other.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday bold scholarly efforts to pry open the Imperial Household&#39;s <br/>\nsanctuary -- its administration of graves, storehouses, archives, <br/>\nand other related properties of hundreds of emperors, empresses, <br/>\ndowager empresses, and imperial family members -- need to be <br/>\nsituated in a larger constitutional and historical context. Only <br/>\nthen can we see behind them the conflict between legacies of the old <br/>\nand the new imperial order, and ultimately between the principles of <br/>\nmonarchy and democracy. Bring the virtually autonomous &quot;symbol <br/>\nmonarchy&quot; and its high-handed, secretive administrative practices <br/>\ninto the picture, and the tombs issue will also illuminate other <br/>\nproblems of historical consciousness that trouble Japan and disturb <br/>\nits relations with Asian neighbors. <br/>\n<br/>\n*<br/>\n<br/>\nTomb identification, restoration, and repair marked the first stage <br/>\nin the construction of Japan&#39;s modern monarchy. The costly work was <br/>\nbegun in the early 1860s under Emperor Komei, father of the Meiji <br/>\nemperor who served as the guiding light for Japan&#39;s modern <br/>\ntransformation. For decades the Tokugawa feudal regime had opposed <br/>\nthe identification of such burial sites. Only in its final crisis <br/>\nyears did it suddenly relent and cooperate in the project, which <br/>\ncontinued until the Meiji Restoration. The grave of 14th century <br/>\nEmperor Go-Daigo, one of the few monarchs who actually combined real <br/>\npower and authority, was the first to be identified. Essentially, <br/>\nthe tombs and mausoleum denoted points of continuity with the <br/>\nancestors buried in them, purportedly stretching back in time to the <br/>\nage of the gods. In that sense they signified exactly what Komei and <br/>\nthe &quot;scholars of National Learning&quot; most wanted to establish: <br/>\nnamely, the permanence of the imperial order, its connection with <br/>\nthe gods, and thus his own divinity.[3] <br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing the revolutionary changes that began in 1868, the <br/>\nresurrection of emperorship continued. More burial mounds were <br/>\nidentified, and this activity became part of a major oligarchic <br/>\neffort to foster belief in the myth of an unbroken line of imperial <br/>\nsuccession. Numerous caretakers and performers of funeral rites <br/>\nbecame involved in tomb maintenance, which developed into a major <br/>\nfunction of the Imperial Household Ministry, predecessor to the <br/>\nAgency. By the time of Meiji&#39;s death in 1912, the Japanese people <br/>\nhad been bound, in theory, to the emperor and his divine ancestors. <br/>\nBut Japan&#39;s bureaucratic elites still worried about the fragility of <br/>\ntheir new monarchy, based on hereditary male succession. Their <br/>\nworries increased during the reign of Meiji&#39;s son, the chronically <br/>\nill Taisho, of whom few expected anything. Already it had been made <br/>\na crime even to say that the emperor was not a living deity. In the <br/>\n1920s lese majesty laws were tightened and teachings on the national <br/>\npolity [kokutai], or the meaning of the throne in Japanese life, <br/>\nfurther systematized. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Hirohito, the only emperor ever to be educated under the new <br/>\nimperial system, ascended to the throne at the end of 1925, the <br/>\ndefining political principles, formalized in the Constitution <br/>\n(1889), the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890), and kokutai <br/>\nthought, began to be re-emphasized. But among ruling elites, fear <br/>\nfor the survival of the monarchy persisted. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile the number of graves identified as &quot;imperial&quot; kept on <br/>\nincreasing. When Japanese soldiers started dying in Manchuria during <br/>\nthe early 1930s, Yasukuni Shrine, charged with commemorating their <br/>\nspirits and mobilizing the nation for war, took on new importance; <br/>\nso too did the emperor&#39;s dispatch of emissaries to the grave sites <br/>\nof his imperial ancestors, but especially to Ise Jingu, shrine for <br/>\nthe spirit of the Sun Goddess, and to Yasukuni. <br/>\n<br/>\n*<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Japan&#39;s defeat in 1945, U.S. officials, with the active <br/>\ncooperation of Japan&#39;s old guard &quot;moderates,&quot; reformed and <br/>\nconstitutionally preserved the monarchy, for without constitutional <br/>\nsupport it might not have lasted. Unwisely, they kept Hirohito on <br/>\nthe throne. They did, however, transform the emperor into a vague, <br/>\nill-defined &quot;symbol&quot; bereft of political power, but left undecided <br/>\nthe question of whether he is the head of state. They also abolished <br/>\nState Shinto, formally disestablished but did not abolish Yasukuni <br/>\nShrine, and wrote a rigorous separation of politics and religion <br/>\ninto the Constitution. Because U.S. occupation officials treated <br/>\npostwar Yasukuni the same way they treated Hirohito -- keeping him <br/>\non the throne and indulgently shielding him from the Tokyo War <br/>\nCrimes Trial -- the shrine was eventually able to restore its <br/>\nauthority and resume its close connection with the monarchy. <br/>\nHirohito paid his first post-occupation visit to Yasukuni in 1952, <br/>\nhis last in 1975. Three years after that final visit, the name-list <br/>\nof the newly enshrined martyrs arrived at the Imperial Household <br/>\nAgency. Hirohito learned that fourteen A-Class war criminals, <br/>\nincluding former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, an individual who <br/>\nhad not died in the war and whom he blamed for his alliance with <br/>\nNazi Germany, had been secretly enshrined. His visits to Yasukuni <br/>\nabruptly ended, but he continued to send imperial family members to <br/>\nattend the shrine&#39;s spring and autumn rites, a practice that <br/>\ncontinues to this day. Akihito has never visited Yasukuni.[4] <br/>\n<br/>\nFor four straight decades, from the mid-1950s through the late <br/>\n1980s, Japan&#39;s economy had grown, holding in check the undemocratic <br/>\ntendencies of its polity. During that time, Yasukuni, together with <br/>\nthe Central Association of Shinto Shrines, its main support <br/>\norganization, repeatedly attempted to regain state protection and <br/>\nrevive the practice of official public visits by ministers of state. <br/>\nA concurrence of crises at the end of the 1980s -- the temporary <br/>\nweakening of the LDP, Hirohito&#39;s death, and the end of the cold war -<br/>\n- soon altered the political atmosphere in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nNationalism is once again on the rise throughout East Asia. Japan, <br/>\nhaving sent troops to Iraq and accommodated to post 9/11 U.S. <br/>\nstrategic planning, has entered a stage that could produce <br/>\nirrevocable alterations in its constitutional provisions and image <br/>\nas a peace state. The ruling conservative politicians have turned to <br/>\nlegal compulsion to force patriotic expression, and increasingly <br/>\nseek to impart only one subjective meaning to it, which all must <br/>\nembrace. Singing the national anthem (kimigayo) and raising the sun <br/>\nflag (hinomaru) during school entrance and graduation ceremonies are <br/>\ntypical examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecent efforts to revise Japan&#39;s Basic Education Law also reveal <br/>\nrestorationist impulses that are stirring again beneath the surface <br/>\nof conservative politics. The present Education Law, for example, <br/>\nwas enacted in 1947, nearly two years after defeat, in reaction to <br/>\nEmperor Meiji&#39;s Education Rescript, which had disavowed universal <br/>\nideals and promoted militarism, loyalty, and filial piety. In the <br/>\ncurrent post-9/11 situation the two leading business federations <br/>\n(Keidanren and Doyukai) and the leading political parties blame the <br/>\nEducation Law for the ills of society and seek to rewrite it along <br/>\nwith the Constitution. Rather than address real economic problems <br/>\nand the dissolution of middle class social norms that lie behind the <br/>\npresent tribulations of Japan&#39;s school system, conservative <br/>\npoliticians pose as guardians of morality and rush ahead with <br/>\nrevision schemes.[5] <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same restorationist inclination can be seen in the way some of <br/>\nJapan&#39;s elites cling to their old perceptions of the Japan-China War <br/>\nand Pacific War, ignoring differences with China and Korea. The <br/>\nbehavior of Prime Minister Koizumi well illustrates the problem. <br/>\nKoizumi follows in the footsteps of former prime minister Nakasone, <br/>\nbut unlike Nakasone he persists in visiting Yasukuni despite <br/>\ndiplomatic protests and demonstrations in China and Korea. The <br/>\npostwar Yasukuni re-presents the prewar view of Japan&#39;s modern wars <br/>\nand actively combats the results of the Tokyo Trials. Thus Koizumi&#39;s <br/>\nvisits highlight the gap in historical consciousness between Japan <br/>\nand the Asian neighbors it attacked and occupied during the first <br/>\nhalf of the twentieth century. His actions carry the danger of <br/>\njeopardizing critically important economic ties. Were it not for the <br/>\nwillingness of all sides to keep politics and economics separate, <br/>\ntheir respective nationalisms could narrow and spiral out of <br/>\ncontrol. For Korea and China also remain locked into pre-World War <br/>\nII images of Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Japan neo-nationalist views of the lost war have moved into the <br/>\nmainstream, but public opinion remains divided over Koizumi&#39;s stand <br/>\non official visits to Yasukuni, with more than half opposing them. <br/>\nAt the same time, the public also strongly supports revision of the <br/>\nImperial Household Law to accommodate a future female successor to <br/>\nthe throne. Unfortunately, there has been no public debate, as yet, <br/>\nover far more fundamental questions: What is the relationship <br/>\nbetween the symbol monarchy and Japanese democracy in a time of <br/>\nrising nationalism? Should the monarchy, predicated on gender <br/>\ndiscrimination and inseparably connected with Yasukuni Shrine, be <br/>\nremoved from the Constitution? Should it even continue to exist in <br/>\nthe Twenty-First Century? If it should, then on what grounds, and at <br/>\nwhat cost to the constitutional rights and freedoms of imperial <br/>\nfamily members?[6] <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if Japan is to protect its democratic institutions and <br/>\nrebuild political relations with China and Korea, then public debate <br/>\nover the Security Treaty with the United States must also be <br/>\nreopened, and the historical legacy of that military alliance <br/>\nreassessed to prevent Japan&#39;s Pentagon ties from undermining its <br/>\ndemocratic processes. Mass movements demanding the ouster of all <br/>\nU.S. bases on Japanese soil could stiffen the will of Japanese <br/>\npoliticians and force them to place relations with Washington on a <br/>\nnew foundation. For U.S. political elites seek to perpetuate Japan&#39;s <br/>\nenergy dependency, limit its diplomatic options, and check its <br/>\ntendency to draw closer to its neighbors in an economic community <br/>\nthat could be of benefit to all peoples of the East Asian region. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1.
