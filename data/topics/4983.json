As in the Hojo commiting seppuku en masse at the <br/>\nbattle of Kamakura, to avoid capture, and humiliation. Or for say the <br/>\nfailure to complete your mission, saying to your lord and all your <br/>\ncomrades you gave your utmost (literally).<br/>\n\tSo in my mind anyway the presence or addition of a Kaishaku was as the <br/>\nname in english implies &quot;Second-ary&quot;, the act is one you do by yourself <br/>\nto preserve your or your families position, status, face, honour if you <br/>\nlike. The Kaishaku when present helped to make things a bit neater and <br/>\ncertainly less painful for the man in the hot seat but Seppuku was no <br/>\nless impressive, effective and honourable without him...<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 3, 2004, at 8:51 PM, M.
