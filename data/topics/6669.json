The whole Kamakura-Muromachi period was in fact a <br/>\ncontinuous attempt from every part to &quot;cut the middle man.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ***idealized*** structure should have been something like: <br/>\nemperor/court - shogun - daimyo - kokujin - dos√¥ - peasants. As a <br/>\nmatter of fact, each party tried to do whatever possible for its own <br/>\nconvenience.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering the convulsion of the period, and the fact that there is no <br/>\naccepted theory on KK-MM institutional history, I would stay away from <br/>\nit. Tokugawa period seems much more approachable, because of the <br/>\nConfucian ideology layer, and the police-state that managed more or <br/>\nless to control people at least fro two centuries.<br/>\n<br/>\ncepo</div>",
