The ladied of daimyo were compelled to stay in Edo as a kind <br/>\nof hostages. The Edo shogunate was very nervous of the tendency of the western counries and paid close <br/>\nattention to taking guns for rebelling against it into Edo and to leaking out secret information of the shogunate <br/>\nthrough forge women travellers of the western daimyo.<br/>\n  <br/>\nThe Ooi River waited for those travellers who successfully passed through the checkpoint of Hakone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shogunate intentionally didn&#39;t construct any bridge across the Ooi River in order to prevent the western <br/>\narmies from advancing into Edo. The melting snow on the Mt. Fuji or heavy rains sometimes caused a sudden <br/>\nrise in the River. At that time, travellers inevitably put up at inns in Mishima (in Shizuoka prefecture at present) <br/>\nalong the River.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn those days, as a post town, very prosperous was Mishima where there were many &quot;geisha&quot; who came from <br/>\nEdo or other districts.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your delectation - Tom</div>",
