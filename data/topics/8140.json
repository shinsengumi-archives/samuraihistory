But I suspect we all have our &quot;favorites&quot; for <br/>\n &gt; whatever disparate reasons there may be.<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; Certainly he was considered one of the paragons of samurai <br/>\n &gt; virtue -- but, oddly enough, more *after* the Meiji <br/>\n &gt; Restoration than before it. Well, not so oddly, really, when <br/>\n &gt; one considers that he fought for the emperor against a <br/>\n &gt; samurai government... &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; Tony<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I would consider Masashige the samurai ideal. He&#39;s definately one<br/>\nof my favourites, along with Yoshitsune and, for some reason, Imagawa<br/>\nSadayo. I think my fondness for Sadayo, which has seen me get my hands<br/>\non everything that&#39;s written about him even only briefly in English, has<br/>\na lot to do with Sansom&#39;s write-up on him in this History of Japan<br/>\nvolume 2. I&#39;d kill for a translation of his travelling diary.<br/>\n <br/>\nAngus<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
