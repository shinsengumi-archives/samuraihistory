            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1403458155\">I have been following this thread with interest and wondering <br/>\nwhether training etc. was a lot more &#39;organic&#39; rather than <br/>\norganised. Presumably dad (or uncle, or someone in the family <br/>\ngroup) would take it upon themselves to teach junior how to <br/>\nhold a sword properly, how to do this, how to do that . . . the <br/>\nsame applies to the bow, horse-riding, etc. Surely in military <br/>\nhouseholds boys would have learned this the same as how to <br/>\ndress themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, although we look at maps of old battles showing the<br/>\ndispositions of various lords and clans, the model might have <br/>\nbeen closer to the Scottish clans (my own heritage) who<br/>\njust turned up on the day with the boys and were told to &#39;stand <br/>\nthere - go when I say&#39; rather than forming an organised army as <br/>\nwe understand it. (My family got effectively wiped out when one <br/>\nof our confederation clans pulled out of the battle moments <br/>\nbefore it began because they were refused the &#39;place of honour&#39; <br/>\nin the line!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skill of the major daimyo must have been organisational as <br/>\nwell as military, in raising and managing large armies. Even at <br/>\nthe last Osaka battle was there not confusion when one unit <br/>\nmoved causing another to cry &#39;treachery&#39;, and wasn&#39;t someone<br/>\nunwilling to move because he hadn&#39;t finished breakfast? This <br/>\nsuggests a lot more of a confederation of allies liable to do <br/>\ntheir own thing rather than, say, a Napoleonic Grande Armee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, daimyo being the tin-pot dictators a lot of them probably <br/>\nwere, I can well see them calling the troops out on a Sunday <br/>\nmorning and marching them up and down - perhaps if one thinks <br/>\nof the local militia units raised by the &#39;lord of the manor&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the Dojo and Ryu we have today was always a rather <br/>\non the esoteric side of things - the exception rather than the <br/>\nrule? Masters opened schools and took students, yes, but not as <br/>\npart of a cohesive daimyo training programme. Also, presumably, <br/>\nskilled warriors on their travels would stop off and avail <br/>\nthemselves of local hospitality in exchange for a few tips?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Hagakure there&#39;s that bit where the young lord is taken <br/>\nto the execution grounds to test his cutting skills . . . <br/>\npresumably again by dad or someone?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe might well ask where the mafia learn all their skills? I <br/>\ndoubt there&#39;s some secret training school in Sicily - more <br/>\nlikely within the family, and by trail and error, and luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts for the mix<br/>\n<br/>\nTom</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1729277717\">This much I know ...<br/>\n    There were two schools that taught martial arts that I know of, the<br/>\ninformation passed down through verbal transmission in the Takeda line. Aizu<br/>\nhad a school that taught Oshikiuchi, a weaponless martial art, and the other<br/>\nwas, I THINK, Onaha Itto-ryu. These schools were very prized, and they<br/>\ntaught to all the high ranking members of the Aizu and Takeda clans; the<br/>\ndignitaries and political members specifically.<br/>\n    In direct regard to &quot;martial arts training&quot;, Judo is an offspring of<br/>\nDaito-ryu. Although it is powerful in and of itself, it&#39;s initial creation<br/>\nwas through a student of Daito-ryu, and all the original &quot;advertisement&quot; so<br/>\nto speak, was a display of Daito-ryu by Shiro Tanomo, son of Saigo Tanomo.<br/>\n    Certain members of the higher ranking samurai, like Shingen Takeda, not<br/>\nonly learned their heritage art passed down through the family, but they<br/>\nstarted at eight years old. The Daito-ryu art in particular, which is the<br/>\none Shingen would have studied through his youth and young adulthood, has<br/>\nbeen in existence as far back as 1200 AD, formalized by Minamoto Yoshimitsu.<br/>\nThe original form included some weapon study, but it was still a form of<br/>\njujutsu, and jujutsu happens to be one of the most potent and deadly arts in<br/>\nthe history of the world. Just watch The Ultimate Fighting Championships if<br/>\nyou doubt that. :oP<br/>\n    As far as high ranking members of the Samurai tradition hiring martial<br/>\nartists to teach them ... Tokugawa did just that. In the 1640s(?), following<br/>\nhis amnesty, Tokugawa sought out the remnants of the Takeda clan to train<br/>\nhis personal body guards.<br/>\n    The majority of this information is complements of Kondo Sensei. These<br/>\nare his oral trasmissions as best as I know them, passed down from the<br/>\ndirect Takeda line.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fredjnsn@...\">fredjnsn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 22, 2001 3:52 PM<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: The origins of the Ninja straight sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Indirectly on topic, but a question/comment nonetheless. . . In all<br/>\n&gt; my years of reading and studying Japanese Samurai history, I have<br/>\n&gt; NEVER come accross anything even remotely resembling &#39;a group of<br/>\n&gt; samurai practicing karate together in a dojo&#39; (quote is my own).  I<br/>\n&gt; have never seen any references to unarmed combat training, and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see much use for it anyway.  The samurai studied weapons, which is<br/>\n&gt; common sense, of course.  I don&#39;t believe (and this is opinion) that<br/>\n&gt; even &#39;powerful samurai families&#39; employed &#39;martial artists&#39; to teach<br/>\n&gt; them unarmed combat.  from my limited (6 years of martial arts<br/>\n&gt; training about 10 years ago or so - and my studying of martial arts<br/>\n&gt; history) is that unarmed combat originated in Okinawa, and at best<br/>\n&gt; 200 - 300 years ago.  I&#39;m sure that judo or jujitsu-like &#39;wrestling&#39;<br/>\n&gt; probably existed, but I doubt that Takeda Shingen or Oda Nobunaga<br/>\n&gt; hired martial arts experts to train there armies in the way of<br/>\n&gt; unarmed combat.  I would hazzard to guess based on what I&#39;ve read<br/>\n&gt; (and thus on what I &#39;haven&#39;t&#39; come accross) that mass training for<br/>\n&gt; the armies wasn&#39;t too common - even weapons training.  most ashigaru<br/>\n&gt; probably went out and cut themselves a bamboo spear and just charged<br/>\n&gt; into battle hoping for the best.  I would assume that any martial<br/>\n&gt; training with weapons was done on one&#39;s own, and not through<br/>\n&gt; a &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or closest to the lord,<br/>\n&gt; who would receive sword training.  Anyway, my point is that I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts training in<br/>\n&gt; the &#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books.  At best the subject comes up<br/>\n&gt; in the VERY questionable &#39;martial arts history books&#39;.  If someone<br/>\n&gt; has info on martial arts training from a &#39;reputable source&#39; PLEASE<br/>\n&gt; respond to this post.

I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have never seen any references to unarmed combat<br/>\n&gt; training, and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see much use for it anyway.  The samurai studied<br/>\n&gt; weapons, which is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; common sense, of course.  I don&#39;t believe (and<br/>\n&gt; this is opinion) that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even &#39;powerful samurai families&#39; employed &#39;martial<br/>\n&gt; artists&#39; to teach<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them unarmed combat.  from my limited (6 years of<br/>\n&gt; martial arts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; training about 10 years ago or so - and my<br/>\n&gt; studying of martial arts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; history) is that unarmed combat originated in<br/>\n&gt; Okinawa, and at best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 200 - 300 years ago.  I&#39;m sure that judo or<br/>\n&gt; jujitsu-like &#39;wrestling&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably existed, but I doubt that Takeda Shingen<br/>\n&gt; or Oda Nobunaga<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hired martial arts experts to train there armies<br/>\n&gt; in the way of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unarmed combat.  I would hazzard to guess based on<br/>\n&gt; what I&#39;ve read<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (and thus on what I &#39;haven&#39;t&#39; come accross) that<br/>\n&gt; mass training for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the armies wasn&#39;t too common - even weapons<br/>\n&gt; training.  most ashigaru<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably went out and cut themselves a bamboo<br/>\n&gt; spear and just charged<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into battle hoping for the best.  I would assume<br/>\n&gt; that any martial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; training with weapons was done on one&#39;s own, and<br/>\n&gt; not through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or<br/>\n&gt; closest to the lord,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who would receive sword training.  Anyway, my<br/>\n&gt; point is that I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts<br/>\n&gt; training in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the &#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books.

There is an old martial art (the name of which escapes<br/>\nme for the moment) which is, essentially, &quot;wrestling in armour.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a very practical thing to learn to do, if you&#39;re an armoured warrior<br/>\nwho periodically has to fight in close quarters.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1995183936\">In regard to the ninja straight sword, something I would like to add to<br/>\nthis discussion may shed some light on the subject. I couldn&#39;t say<br/>\nspecifically or without doubt that ninja did or did not use some different<br/>\nsort of weapon.<br/>\n    What I CAN say, though, is that ninja, if you consider them with some<br/>\nmodicum of common sense, were samurai. The &quot;Ninjitsu&quot; art is very skilled<br/>\nand shows traces of the higher teachings of other martial arts belonging to<br/>\nfamilies of very high social status, including the Imperial family.<br/>\n    Arts such as these were not taught to the common soldier. More<br/>\nspecifically, they were rarely, if ever, taught to people outside the family<br/>\nor clan. The ninja arts you see on the hyped up television shows are more<br/>\nlike karate, an art developed by peasants. The actual art of ninjitsu is<br/>\nMUCH different. It is more like jujutsu, involving joint locks, pressure<br/>\npoints, balance breaking, and all the other fundamental principles of the<br/>\nsecret arts of the samurai clans.<br/>\n    What you must consider here is that ninja were not assassins sent to<br/>\nmurder the common folk. Soldiers would have done just fine for that task.<br/>\nNinja were assassins designated for murdering members of the higher social<br/>\nstatus.<br/>\n    Send an ill-trained man to take out someone like Oda Nobunaga, Ieyesu<br/>\nTokugawa, Shingen Takeda, etc, and what you would likely end up with is a<br/>\nbotched assassination. Yes, it&#39;s true that any man can be gotten to, but men<br/>\nof such stature were not so easy to kill, and only a fool would send a lacky<br/>\nfor such an important task knowing that if he failed, the blame might come<br/>\nback on him. Japanese bravery or not, torture can motivate a lot of people.<br/>\n    Therefore, it is my educated guess that ninja had to be of at least<br/>\nsamurai status in order to have the training necessary to lay low someone so<br/>\nwell trained in the martial arts as the people they were sent to<br/>\nassassinate. If they are samurai, then it is not likely they used anything<br/>\ndifferent than the typical samurai katana.<br/>\n    IF they used something different, it would have been for some sort of<br/>\npractical purpose, like ease of movement, or the ability to move unhindered<br/>\nin tight quarters. After all, they did not walk up to the front door and<br/>\nannounce that they were there to assassinate someone, and I imagine it would<br/>\nhave been cumbersome trying to scale a castle wall in the fancy samurai garb<br/>\nand protruding katana at the hip. A shoulder harness would have been<br/>\nappropriate for such tasks, and a curved katana blade would have been more<br/>\ndifficult to draw from such a position.<br/>\n    Sooo, although I am of the opinion that the ninja did not carry straight<br/>\nswords, I can see the practicality in it given their task and the<br/>\ncircumstances surrounding the completion of it. The curved katana might have<br/>\nbeen a better weapon, but the ninja did not intend to pitch battle. They<br/>\nintended a sword in the back.<br/>\n    This, of course, is all just opinion and conjecture, but as with most<br/>\nthings, if you take a look at the root of something, a lot of truths come to<br/>\nthe surface.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: erik baker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:musashieb@...\">musashieb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001 9:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] The origins of the Ninja straight sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The ninja straight sword is a myth.
