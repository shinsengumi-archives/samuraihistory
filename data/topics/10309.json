Contrary to popular belief, and often overlooked by historians, guns did in fact make their way into Japan as early as the 1450&#39;s, mainly through Ryukyu or to mainland Japan via China and Korea. Although they remained more of an oddity or curio until they were mass produced beginning in the 1540&#39;s, there are accounts of them in Japan long before the introduction by Western traders, which we present to you in this episode. And, for anyone who has ever wondered what the difference is between a musket, matchlock, and arquebus, we&#39;ll give you a concise explanation of the types of firearms in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nMentioned in this podcast:<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapons & Fighting Techniques of the Samurai Warrior 1200-1877 AD <br/>\nBy Thomas, D Conlan, Amber Books Ltd, 2008 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/iTAroK\">http://bit.ly/iTAroK</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUezato, Takashi, Ryûkyû no kaki ni tsuite (On Ryukyu&#39;s Firearms) <br/>\nOkinawa Bunka, No. 36, pp73-92, July 2000<br/>\n<br/>\nOda Nobunaga Rekishi Gunzo Series #1 <br/>\nGAKKEN, 1996<br/>\n<br/>\nEtheridge, Charles, Reinventing the Sword: A Cultural Comparison of the Development of the Sword in Response to the Advent of Firearms in Spain and Japan.
