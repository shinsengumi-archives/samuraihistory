Worth area know there is a Japanese Armor Exhibit going on right now in Dallas.  I&#39;m sorry for not putting this out their sooner but computer use is so limited right now.  Anyway, it&#39;s on Flora St. in Dallas, but I don&#39;t know EXACTLY where it is being held.  I am sorry for not being more precise with my information.  I didn&#39;t bring my paper with the address on it with me to my local Kinko&#39;s!  HA HA... As soon as I do I will write you all and let you know.  It is only going on until the 26th of August so get moving!  I just found out about it and nearly died because I didn&#39;t know it was here.!!!  Like I said, if I find the paper with the address on it I&#39;ll pass that along for you all. <br/>\n <br/>\nEnjoy,<br/>\nChristine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Eagles may soar, but weasles don&#39;t get caught in jet engines.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nHotJobs, a Yahoo! service - Search Thousands of New Jobs<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

We&#39;ll study the influency of the japanese philosophy<br/>\nat the artisan work and the swordsmiths at the moment of the sword<br/>\nconstruction, looking for their own philosophical merits, the beauty and the<br/>\nfunctionality. The sword wasn&#39;t just an object of cut for the Samurai but<br/>\nsomething that had a philosophy, simbols, an interior essence or how it&#39;s<br/>\nsaid, it has an soul. The peculiar and different way, that it was necessary<br/>\nto get the ideal sword, made the artisan use cultural and religious aspects<br/>\nin a symmetry with the Nature. The parallel universe of the oriental<br/>\ncreation is something mystic and philosophic, wich the objective is to<br/>\ncreate<br/>\nin a way to sensitize because of the beauty and the utility.</div>",
