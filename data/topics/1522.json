            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-550278546\">Kirk-<br/>\n\tThe Shinsengumi did exists unfortunately Ruroni Kenshin and <br/>\nmany of the characters in the comixs did not. When the Tokugawa <br/>\nbakufu began to lose control of the country in the 1850s, Kyoto <br/>\nbecame a magnet for Anti-Tokugawa ronin. The Bakufus&#39; hold on the <br/>\ncity became rather tenuous. Thye Shinsegumi was a group of Tokugawa <br/>\nloyalists banded together to act as counter-terrorists in the capitol.<br/>\n\tThey were known for their harsh rules and strict <br/>\ntraditionalism. I would recommend the movies &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; with <br/>\nMifune, &quot;Shisengumi Shimatsuki&quot; with Ichikawa, &quot;Bakumatsu zankoku <br/>\nmonogatari&quot; and even the recent &quot;Gohatto&quot;. There are many more, but <br/>\nif these stimulate your interest I think you&#39;ll find the true story <br/>\nof the Shinsegumi more interesting than any manga.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
