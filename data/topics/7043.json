It reminds me of an incident that happened to me in <br/>\nMA. I was in the amrory getting pictures of a daisho and some early <br/>\nEdo period armor for a project. The tour guide had a group with him, <br/>\nand he pointed out the armor, while I was writing down some notes. He <br/>\nsaid that samurai armor was made from bamboo since there was not alor <br/>\nof good iron in Japan (I wonder how they got all those yari, katana <br/>\nand kabuto.) so armor was made from bamboo. Clearly he was wrong, <br/>\nescpecially when the information plate next to the armor said it was <br/>\nmade from metal and silk. So in the end I do not listen to tour <br/>\nguides much, I always check and double check info and thats that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in the end BA,MA or PHD someone can be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaikeru</div>",

In this case for<br/>\nexample, say that you are aware that Hayes&#39; word is, and let&#39;s be<br/>\ngenerous here &quot;unreliable&quot;, and that you do not know the other quoted<br/>\nsources, how the heck are you then supposed to judge what these other<br/>\npeople say? I&#39;m sorry, if one of your sources is severely flawed and the<br/>\nothers are unknown to you, then you have to ignore the lot. Unless of<br/>\ncourse you have the time to become an authority yourself. And let&#39;s face<br/>\nit most of us don&#39;t, so we have to make judgements about the sources we<br/>\nhave access to. For example I don&#39;t speak or read Japanese, which means<br/>\nthat I have to read a variety of English sources just to make sure, that<br/>\na &quot;fact&quot; is generally supported by those who have &quot;earned&quot; my respect.<br/>\nHayes and his supernatural, future viewing, PJ wearing wonder warriors<br/>\nfirmly belongs in the land of &quot;wu-wu-yibble&quot;, not that of the rising<br/>\nsun!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are images of history that become rooted in the popular culture,<br/>\nwhich are quite simply, wrong. For example the commonly heard/seen term<br/>\n&quot;chainmail&quot;. It doesn&#39;t make them right simply because a lot of people<br/>\ndon&#39;t know their history well enough, nor is it their fault.

You<br/>\nneed big bucks to take the time, and do the travelling, pay experts for<br/>\ninterviews etc. to get it anywhere near right. And unless this is a big<br/>\nbudget, or a dilettante production with a rich patron with time to<br/>\nspend, I don&#39;t hold out much hope for its academic rigor. I know how<br/>\nthese things go, I&#39;m about to do a tiny, tiny part in a god awful low<br/>\nbudget documentary series of ten 60 minute programs for the Discovery<br/>\nChannel*, and believe me accuracy is the last thing on the producer&#39;s<br/>\nmind.

It appears, with a few exceptions,<br/>\nthat on this topic we&#39;re going to stay divided into<br/>\ntwo camps: the historians, and the martial artists. As<br/>\nlong as everyone recognizes where they belong, then we<br/>\ncan move on. <br/>\n<br/>\nMe? I&#39;m a skeptic--that&#39;s my nature. If I saw a<br/>\ndocumentary on Korean/Japanese history  that listed<br/>\nWong-Tak Hong as a source, I&#39;d avoid it like the<br/>\nplague simply based on that. Of course it&#39;s entirely<br/>\npossible that he&#39;s simply the &quot;dissenting view&quot; in the<br/>\ndocumentary and that more credible historians are<br/>\ngiven the lion&#39;s share of the screen time, but even<br/>\nacknowledging him as a small source is extremely<br/>\nquestionable. Same with Hayes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may end up being a great documentary, with Hayes<br/>\nas a minor player--fine, and good for it. However, if<br/>\nit wants viewership in the larger history community,<br/>\nand not just in the martial arts community, then<br/>\nsources like Hayes are a detriment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1506689925\">By ROBERT YELLIN<br/>\n<br/>\nJapan has long been fascinated with outside<br/>\ninfluences, and voraciously absorbs them in order to<br/>\ncreate something totally unique. This can be found in<br/>\nalmost all aspects of Japanese industry and culture --<br/>\nand it is nowhere more apparent than in the pottery<br/>\nborn in Kyushu. Of course, ancient kilns dating back<br/>\nto the dawn of Japanese civilization are to be found<br/>\non Kyushu, yet it wasn&#39;t until the late 1590s with the<br/>\ninflux of Korean potters -- in the &quot;Pottery Wars&quot; --<br/>\nthat the island&#39;s pottery really matured. <br/>\n <br/>\nThose Korean potters -- many of whom became Japanese<br/>\ncitizens -- brought with them new kiln designs, the<br/>\nability to create porcelain, and ash glazes that have<br/>\ndelighted ceramic enthusiasts ever since. The glory of<br/>\nKyushu&#39;s ceramic art from the Edo Period (1603-1867)<br/>\nto the early Showa Era is now on display in Tokyo at<br/>\nthe Nihon Mingeikan (Japan Folk Crafts Museum) until<br/>\nJune 26 in an exhibition titled &quot;Ceramics in Kyushu.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThose who have not yet been to the Mingeikan, are<br/>\nmissing one of Japan&#39;s most charming museums. Its<br/>\nintimate and timeless atmosphere is the perfect place<br/>\nto discover the beauty of folk arts, and it&#39;s a<br/>\npilgrimage any lover of Japanese art should make no<br/>\nmatter what exhibition they have on offer. Anyone with<br/>\nan interest in traditional ceramic art will be<br/>\ncaptivated by this exhibition that introduces visitors<br/>\nto the many styles of pottery fired in Kyushu,<br/>\nincluding Imari and Karatsu from Saga, Hasami from<br/>\nNagasaki, Koishiwara from Fukuoka, Onta from Oita,<br/>\nShodai from Kumamoto, and Naeshirogawa and Tanegashima<br/>\nfrom Kagoshima. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two basic kinds of ceramics in antique<br/>\nKyushu -- pottery fired by part-time farmers/part-time<br/>\npotters creating vessels for daily life, and Tea<br/>\npottery fired originally for daimyo, with the style<br/>\nthat best represents the latter category being<br/>\nKaratsu-yaki.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaratsu is a port city in Saga Prefecture which is<br/>\nvery close to Korea. In eastern Japan, the generic<br/>\nterm to describe pottery is setomono, the Kyushu<br/>\nequivalent is karatsumono, showing just how important<br/>\nthis potting center was, and, of course, still is. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe noborigama (chambered climbing kiln) was<br/>\nintroduced from Korea to Japan -- via Karatsu -- in<br/>\nthe 17th century and forever changed the ceramic<br/>\nlandscape. It allowed various glazed wares such as<br/>\nmadara-garatsu (speckled straw-ash glaze),<br/>\nchosen-garatsu (Korean-style, two-tone glazing),<br/>\ne-garatsu (painted) or kuro-garatsu (black) to be<br/>\ncreated on these shores. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaratsu became important in the tea world with many<br/>\ntea-ceremony devotees considering it one of the top<br/>\nfour styles along with Raku, Ido and Hagi. An<br/>\nunassuming e-garatsu jar in the exhibition aptly<br/>\nillustrates the philosophy of the &quot;unknown craftsman,&quot;<br/>\nmade famous by mingei founder Yanagi Soetsu<br/>\n(1889-1961) -- its fully rounded tranquil form and<br/>\nspontaneous iron-brush rendition of reeds are the<br/>\nepitome of Japanese folk pottery. Originally it was<br/>\nused as a salt-cellar, yet is now more commonly used<br/>\nas a mizusashi (fresh water jar) in a Way of Tea<br/>\ngathering. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the outstanding pieces in the exhibition is a<br/>\nlarge 18th-century Shodai-yaki tea jar. Shodai-yaki<br/>\ntakes its name from Mount Shodai (Arao City, Kumamoto<br/>\nPrefecture) where the clay has a high iron-content and<br/>\nis perfect for sturdy pottery. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the iron-rich clay, a dark-brown iron glaze is<br/>\napplied, and then a rice-straw ash-glaze is either<br/>\nladled or dramatically dripped on, here creating an<br/>\nunintentional abstract rendering of birdlike figures. <br/>\n<br/>\nRepresentative of Kyushu forms is a large spouted<br/>\nvessel called an unsuke of which there are a few<br/>\noutstanding examples on show. One was made at<br/>\nKoishiwara and has a wild white-and-yellow splash<br/>\nglazing over the base iron glaze; it was originally<br/>\nused to hold soy sauce, vinegar, or sake. Another<br/>\nunsuke has a magical overlapping of a green glaze with<br/>\ntinges of blue over the iron glaze. It&#39;s almost<br/>\nimpossible to find potters able to create this effect<br/>\ntoday due to changes in materials and methods of<br/>\nfiring. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnsuke were commonly used in Kyushu households until<br/>\nthe early Showa Era, mini-versions of them called a<br/>\nkarakara are still used for pouring shochu throughout<br/>\nKyushu.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorld-famous Imari porcelains are more than adequately<br/>\nrepresented here. There are several large subdued<br/>\nunderglaze blue landscape bowls -- one of which is a<br/>\nmasterpiece in terms of design, color and the balance<br/>\nof the two -- and also the more colorful underglaze<br/>\nblue with overglaze enamel paintings. <br/>\n<br/>\nKorean potter Ri Sampei (1579-1655) located a cache of<br/>\nsuitable porcelain clay in the early 1600s in Northern<br/>\nKyushu and Japan, and, finally, was able to produce<br/>\nporcelain. The neighboring port town of Imari was<br/>\nwhere many 17th-century Dutch merchants loaded up<br/>\ntheir ships with Arita-made porcelain, so the term<br/>\nImari and Arita wares are often interchangeable. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo one piece in the exhibition is as haunting as a<br/>\n17th-century Tataro-yaki burial urn from Saga. It&#39;s<br/>\ncrudely formed with a somber dark brown body and has a<br/>\nmaze-like coil motif; giving the whole a gothic feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy quietly observing the outer strength and inner calm<br/>\nof all the pieces on display, a serene majestic mood<br/>\nwill guide you back home to where (hopefully) your<br/>\ndaily utensils offer you not only usefulness, yet also<br/>\ntake you to some place where beauty and life can<br/>\nintertwine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mingeikan (03) 3467-4527 is a 7-minute walk from<br/>\nKomaba Todaimae station on the Inokashira local line.<br/>\nWalk out of the station, under the tracks, and turn<br/>\nleft.

I started<br/>\ntraining in the Bujinkan in the early/mid 80&#39;s.  I have no illusions about<br/>\nStephen Hayes.  While I would certainly agree that he had his own<br/>\ninterpretation of Ninjutsu, he did bring the art to the United States in a<br/>\nbig way.  So let&#39;s give him some credit.  One can certainly see him going<br/>\nhis own direction in &quot;Ninja Realms of Power&quot;.  While I stop short of calling<br/>\nhim a fraud, I do think it wise that any information from him be cross<br/>\nchecked.  I had a long gap in trianing and came back a few years ago.  When<br/>\nI did, I found that there were many holes in my knowledge and many peices of<br/>\ninfomrtion I found to be incorrect.  Some of that, I suppose could be<br/>\nattributed to Hayes.  However, I think that at the time a good portion of it<br/>\nwas that we just plain do not live in Japan and get impressions (not just<br/>\nfrom Hayes) and 2nd and 3rd hand information.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, for what it is worth, Paul, your book &quot;History of the Schools of<br/>\nthe Bujinkan&quot; is required reading for my students.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nJohn Hidalgo<br/>\nwww.texasshinto.org<br/>\nwww.roundrockbujinkan.com<br/>\nwww.lonestarsumo.org<br/>\n&quot;Seek freedom and become captive of your desires.

I can&#39;t imagine a group of assassins allowing people to spread their <br/>\nREAL information freely, so the group is either dead or non-existent.<br/>\n5.

It is possible I can also\r<br/>\nfind someone to fund it\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nhowever until someone who knows better (maybe yourself\r<br/>\nNate) then we have to make do with a little better\r<br/>\neach time. So far the only nina documentaries I have\r<br/>\nseen are on things ike dicovery and I could have\r<br/>\nchoked at the crap they spouted.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPaul\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n--- Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; wrote:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n---------------------------------\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:umaryu@...\">umaryu@...</a>&gt; wrote:\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; HI\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; I love this attitude.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; I havent seen it, I know nothing about it, so I will\r<br/>\n&gt; slam it as much as I can.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since when has skepticism meant &quot;slam it as much as I\r<br/>\ncan&quot;? I&#39;ll slam Hayes all day--I&#39;ve, to date, made 1\r<br/>\ncomment about the documentary. Did you produce this?\r<br/>\nYou&#39;re certainly defending it like you&#39;ve got a vested\r<br/>\ninterest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese\r<br/>\nhistory 101 and knows something now--but I&#39;m\r<br/>\nskeptical. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf the documentary isn&#39;t built around him, than\r<br/>\nlovely--hopefully it has some useful information. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My I suggest if you already think its a load of crap\r<br/>\n&gt; before its been released that you go and produce\r<br/>\n&gt; something better.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; i await your future project on the ninja so we can\r<br/>\n&gt; all\r<br/>\n&gt; insult it\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re willing to pay me to quit my job, fund the\r<br/>\nproject, and pay the production costs, I&#39;d be more\r<br/>\nthan happy to. Of course, it&#39;d be cheaper to just\r<br/>\ntranslate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then\r<br/>\nyou&#39;d take issue with my translation, I&#39;m sure. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n__________________________________________________\r<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?\r<br/>\nTired of spam?

Lets get one<br/>\n&gt; thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; straight - I know from your past quotes you know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nothing really about The Bujinkan or Hayes or even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hatsumi. Hatsumi did not Teach Hayes everything he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knows, It has been discussed openly on Bujinkan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forums<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and its been pointed out that hayes has fabricated<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; large amount of information, he is also credited<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inventing the straight sword theory. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, nor do I claim to know.

I&#39;ve REPLIED to many<br/>\n&gt; posts<br/>\n&gt; now with comments about Hayes. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; Or �it is that perhaps did You more than<br/>\n&gt; Hayes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Budo Taijutsu?  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend you see the film and train dogs,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; martial arts. Not with a heart closed.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Very insulting. Helly is a martial artist who so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happens to be in Budo Taijutsu, so what. I suggest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you shut up , stop insuulting people you dont<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know, stop insulting material you have yet to see.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a moderator in this forum your behavior here is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disgusting. In the past you have told people to<br/>\n&gt; stop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; such behavior and here you are - the sole cause of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; insults.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Learn to attribute the correct insult to the correct<br/>\n&gt; person, my friend. Helly said what you quoted above<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; ME, not the other way around. I quoted it in<br/>\n&gt; response<br/>\n&gt; to him to ask him what he was talking about. The<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; thing I&#39;ve said insulting to Helly, possibly, is<br/>\n&gt; questioning his grasp of the English language--and<br/>\n&gt; since he&#39;s a native of another country, it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; meant<br/>\n&gt; to be insulting. I simply had no idea what he said<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; a certain passage. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am quite shocked at your comments and behavior,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially as you  are a moderator - not the what<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would expect.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again, learn to recognize who is typing what. Shall<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; repost Helly&#39;s reply to me for you? Here you go: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Budo Taijutsu? I recommend you see the film and<br/>\n&gt; train<br/>\n&gt; dogs, not martial arts.

In the past you have told people to stop<br/>\n&gt; such behavior and here you are - the sole cause of<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; insults.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Learn to attribute the correct insult to the correct<br/>\nperson, my friend. Helly said what you quoted above to<br/>\nME, not the other way around. I quoted it in response<br/>\nto him to ask him what he was talking about. The only<br/>\nthing I&#39;ve said insulting to Helly, possibly, is<br/>\nquestioning his grasp of the English language--and<br/>\nsince he&#39;s a native of another country, it&#39;s not meant<br/>\nto be insulting. I simply had no idea what he said in<br/>\na certain passage. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am quite shocked at your comments and behavior,<br/>\n&gt; especially as you  are a moderator - not the what we<br/>\n&gt; would expect.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, learn to recognize who is typing what. Shall I<br/>\nrepost Helly&#39;s reply to me for you? Here you go: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by the<br/>\nBudo Taijutsu? I recommend you see the film and train<br/>\ndogs, not martial arts. Not with a heart closed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still not sure I understand what the heck he&#39;s<br/>\ntalking about, at least in the first sentence. If<br/>\nyou&#39;re both members of the Budo Taijutsu, then please<br/>\nset your fellow martial artist straight about Hayes,<br/>\nfor one. Secondly, you can pass on to him that both of<br/>\nmy dogs are trained, though not in martial arts. Sit,<br/>\ndown, stay...these they can do. <br/>\n<br/>\nNOW, if there is any further issue with the above<br/>\nquote, then please direct it to me offline. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\nDiscover Yahoo! <br/>\nStay in touch with email, IM, photo sharing and more.

Have you<br/>\nread his &quot;Secret Ninja Fighting Arts&quot;? It&#39;s a joke.<br/>\nAside from the fact that the man claims to have lived<br/>\nin Japan and speak Japanese and yet he can&#39;t romanize<br/>\nanything correctly, nor does he understand the<br/>\nsimplest of phrases. As somebody who&#39;s studied the<br/>\nJapanese language for over 10 years and Japanese<br/>\nhistory for 22, I find it ridiculous to think that an<br/>\n&quot;expert&quot; doesn&#39;t know how to pronounce/spell<br/>\nvocabulary inherent to his topic. His &quot;research&quot; into<br/>\n&quot;ninja history&quot; is comical at best--Japanese school<br/>\nchildren could set him straight, yet he&#39;s a published<br/>\nauthor? If I had the book in front of me now, I could<br/>\ngenerate you a list 3 pages long--however, I can&#39;t<br/>\nstomach the thought of reading that putrid excuse for<br/>\n&quot;research&quot; again. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am particularly interested in what<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is the specific Hollywood<br/>\n&gt; misinformation you attribute to Mr. Hayes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1. Straight &quot;Ninja-to&quot;. Didn&#39;t exist. He is, as far as<br/>\nI can tell, the proponent of the myth. He discusses it<br/>\nin his books, and the use of it in movies seems to<br/>\ndate from around the same time he became a Hollywood<br/>\n&quot;consultant&quot;. Seen many Japanese produced movies<br/>\ninvolving Shinobi/Ninja? You don&#39;t find any straight<br/>\nswords. You don&#39;t see any in museums, you don&#39;t find<br/>\nany in flea markets. They didn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The &quot;Black Uniform&quot; phenomenon. Black outlines at<br/>\nnight, which is why a. modern special forces units do<br/>\nnot use black uniforms even at night, and b. the<br/>\nIga-Ueno Ninja museum specifically displays a blue<br/>\nnightsuit for covert work. Hayes won&#39;t be seen outside<br/>\nof his black pjs. It&#39;s well documented (Turnbull, for<br/>\none, if you&#39;d like an English source) that the common<br/>\nimage of &quot;ninja&quot; in black stems from Kabuki/Bunraku<br/>\nstage conventions. Both stage formats have assistants<br/>\non stage in black--their wearing of all black<br/>\nindicates to the audience that they are &quot;not seen&quot;,<br/>\nand are to be ignored. When faced with the problem of<br/>\nportraying assasins with mythical skills, playwrights<br/>\nhit upon the idea of putting them in black, to<br/>\nindicate they were &quot;invisible&quot;. It stuck. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s use some common sense here--you&#39;re a doshin in<br/>\nEdo, and you see some guy walking down the street in<br/>\nblack kimono, kobakama, tabi, and a mask. Aren&#39;t you<br/>\ngoing to be the least bit suspicious and take him in<br/>\nfor questioning? <br/>\n<br/>\n  If I am<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; reading your post<br/>\n&gt; correctly, you seem to indicate that Masaaki Hatsumi<br/>\n&gt; is a fraud.  Could you<br/>\n&gt; also present your basis for this as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Connection with Hayes? Both Hatsumi and Hayes may very<br/>\nwell be excellent martial artists. Historians they are<br/>\nnot, and it is my opinion--note I said opinion--that<br/>\n&quot;ninjutsu&quot; is a marketing tool for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n Who has<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mr. Hayes or Mr. Hatsumi<br/>\n&gt; drefrauded and how? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anyone who believes their versions of history, for<br/>\none. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou also mentioned history<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; books.  What specific history<br/>\n&gt; books do you feel we should be reading so that &quot;this<br/>\n&gt; crap wouldn&#39;t keep<br/>\n&gt; coming back&quot; and while we are at it, to what<br/>\n&gt; specific &quot;crap&quot; are you<br/>\n&gt; referring?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anything not connected with &quot;Martial Arts Weekly&quot;<br/>\nwould be a start. Turnbull is an acceptable starting<br/>\nplace, I suppose, though his research is questioned by<br/>\nmany. I&#39;ve got no problem with his research per<br/>\nse--only his repetitiveness from book to book and his<br/>\nhorrible editing. But, he&#39;s a good place to start. AJ<br/>\nBryant is pretty good too. GB Sansom, Mary Berry,<br/>\nBottomley & Hopson...out of the group, only Turnbull<br/>\nhas put out a book on &quot;ninja&quot;. Why? Because you can<br/>\nget enough about special operations, assasinations,<br/>\netc. in Japanese history without focusing on the word<br/>\n&quot;ninja&quot;. The word is a later phenomenon--check out<br/>\ntexts from the Sengoku or before. Koyo Gunkan,<br/>\nShinchoukouki, etc. You might find &quot;shinobi no mono&quot;,<br/>\nbut often enough you either get &quot;kusa&quot; (grass--an<br/>\nallusion to their role as scouts) or simply a<br/>\ndescription of the act, not the person who acted.<br/>\nNinja weren&#39;t some secret peasant society, either.<br/>\nHattori Hanzo? A samurai retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br/>\nYagyuu Jubei? From the Yagyuu family, a samurai family<br/>\nfrom Iga, who controlled the fief around Ueno and<br/>\nlater served as kenjutsu instructors to the Tokugawa<br/>\nbakufu. Sure, they probably trained in a wider arrange<br/>\nof war-making skills than your average samurai, to<br/>\ninclude subterfuge, stealth, etc., but is this any<br/>\ndifferent than military units/operatives who study the<br/>\nsame things now? Are Rangers or Green Berets a<br/>\nmystical cult? No--they&#39;re military operatives with<br/>\ndifferent training and missions than your normal<br/>\nsoldier. What we call ninja now were no different than<br/>\nthat. Could you call a maid hired to pass information<br/>\nshe overhears in her ladies chamber a shinobi? Sure<br/>\nyou could. Does she necessarily have to be trained to<br/>\nadminister death 37 different ways with a chopstick?<br/>\nOf course not. <br/>\n<br/>\n Your post gives the impression that you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have reseached Mr. Hayes<br/>\n&gt; and Mr. Hayes.  What methodolgy did you use for this<br/>\n&gt; reseach?  How much time<br/>\n&gt; was put into it?  What qualifications do you<br/>\n&gt; personally hold to make a valid<br/>\n&gt; assesment whether or not the activities of Mr. Hayes<br/>\n&gt; or Mr. Hatsumi are<br/>\n&gt; fraudlent?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You mean, other than a functioning brain and a working<br/>\nlevel knowledge of Japanese and Japanese history?<br/>\nNone, I suppose. If you want to buy into the hype, be<br/>\nmy guest. However, this is a HISTORY email list, not a<br/>\nmartial arts list. I study Japanese HISTORY, not<br/>\nmartial arts. Hayes or Hatsumi may have excellent<br/>\ntechniques for arm locks or foot sweeps--however, when<br/>\nyou can&#39;t accurately reproduce historical facts that I<br/>\ncould ask of the 5 year old girl next door, then you<br/>\nlack credibility. <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, since you brought it up, for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; whom are you an<br/>\n&gt; intellegence officer?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*I* didn&#39;t bring it up. Helly did. I simply responded<br/>\nto him. As for who employs me, there&#39;s a &quot;I&#39;d tell<br/>\nyou, but I&#39;d have to kill you&quot; joke in there just<br/>\ndying to get out, but I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s worth<br/>\nit. I&#39;m in the US Army stationed in Japan. No<br/>\nrelevance to this discussion whatsoever except in the<br/>\ncontext in which Helly, making a personal attack,<br/>\naddressed me, and I responded.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also suggest that if you want to see ninja done in a<br/>\nfun way, check out some Japanese movies. I&#39;ve<br/>\nmentioned &quot;Owl&#39;s Castle&quot; (Fukuro no shiro in<br/>\nJapanese). Excellent flick that does play around with<br/>\nthe mystical side of ninjutsu, but for the most part<br/>\nkeeps things...somewhat real. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Hayes<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; hardly a &quot;source&quot; of anything but Hollywood<br/>\n&gt; misinformation.

Let me<br/>\n&gt; break it down: Hayes = fraud. Hatsumi taught Hayes<br/>\n&gt; everything he knows. That makes Hatsumi a.....?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Criminy, if people would put down the martial arts<br/>\n&gt; magazines and pick up a history book, this crap<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t keep coming back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Budo Taijutsu?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not a CLUE what you&#39;re saying here.

Hatsumi did not Teach Hayes everything he<br/>\nknows, It has been discussed openly on Bujinkan forums<br/>\nand its been pointed out that hayes has fabricated a<br/>\nlarge amount of information, he is also credited with<br/>\ninventing the straight sword theory. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust because Hayes is in it does not mean it is bad.<br/>\nAgain if you havent seen it why attack it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Budo Taijutsu?  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend you see the film and train dogs, not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; martial arts. Not with a heart closed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very insulting. Helly is a martial artist who so<br/>\nhappens to be in Budo Taijutsu, so what. I suggest<br/>\nthat you shut up , stop insuulting people you dont<br/>\nknow, stop insulting material you have yet to see. As<br/>\na moderator in this forum your behavior here is<br/>\ndisgusting. In the past you have told people to stop<br/>\nsuch behavior and here you are - the sole cause of all<br/>\ninsults.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your noit interested in it you should just have<br/>\nsaid I am not interested in the Ninja,, and I<br/>\npersonally wont be watching it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am quite shocked at your comments and behavior,<br/>\nespecially as you  are a moderator - not the what we<br/>\nwould expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

They didn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The &quot;Black Uniform&quot; phenomenon. Black outlines at<br/>\nnight, which is why a. modern special forces units do<br/>\nnot use black uniforms even at night, and b. the<br/>\nIga-Ueno Ninja museum specifically displays a blue<br/>\nnightsuit for covert work. Hayes won&#39;t be seen outside<br/>\nof his black pjs. It&#39;s well documented (Turnbull, for<br/>\none, if you&#39;d like an English source) that the common<br/>\nimage of &quot;ninja&quot; in black stems from Kabuki/Bunraku<br/>\nstage conventions. Both stage formats have assistants<br/>\non stage in black--their wearing of all black<br/>\nindicates to the audience that they are &quot;not seen&quot;,<br/>\nand are to be ignored. When faced with the problem of<br/>\nportraying assasins with mythical skills, playwrights<br/>\nhit upon the idea of putting them in black, to<br/>\nindicate they were &quot;invisible&quot;. It stuck. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s use some common sense here--you&#39;re a doshin in<br/>\nEdo, and you see some guy walking down the street in<br/>\nblack kimono, kobakama, tabi, and a mask. Aren&#39;t you<br/>\ngoing to be the least bit suspicious and take him in<br/>\nfor questioning? <br/>\n<br/>\n  If I am<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; reading your post<br/>\n&gt; correctly, you seem to indicate that Masaaki Hatsumi<br/>\n&gt; is a fraud.  Could you<br/>\n&gt; also present your basis for this as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Connection with Hayes? Both Hatsumi and Hayes may very<br/>\nwell be excellent martial artists. Historians they are<br/>\nnot, and it is my opinion--note I said opinion--that<br/>\n&quot;ninjutsu&quot; is a marketing tool for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n Who has<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mr. Hayes or Mr. Hatsumi<br/>\n&gt; drefrauded and how? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anyone who believes their versions of history, for<br/>\none. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou also mentioned history<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; books.  What specific history<br/>\n&gt; books do you feel we should be reading so that &quot;this<br/>\n&gt; crap wouldn&#39;t keep<br/>\n&gt; coming back&quot; and while we are at it, to what<br/>\n&gt; specific &quot;crap&quot; are you<br/>\n&gt; referring?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anything not connected with &quot;Martial Arts Weekly&quot;<br/>\nwould be a start. Turnbull is an acceptable starting<br/>\nplace, I suppose, though his research is questioned by<br/>\nmany. I&#39;ve got no problem with his research per<br/>\nse--only his repetitiveness from book to book and his<br/>\nhorrible editing. But, he&#39;s a good place to start. AJ<br/>\nBryant is pretty good too. GB Sansom, Mary Berry,<br/>\nBottomley & Hopson...out of the group, only Turnbull<br/>\nhas put out a book on &quot;ninja&quot;. Why? Because you can<br/>\nget enough about special operations, assasinations,<br/>\netc. in Japanese history without focusing on the word<br/>\n&quot;ninja&quot;. The word is a later phenomenon--check out<br/>\ntexts from the Sengoku or before. Koyo Gunkan,<br/>\nShinchoukouki, etc. You might find &quot;shinobi no mono&quot;,<br/>\nbut often enough you either get &quot;kusa&quot; (grass--an<br/>\nallusion to their role as scouts) or simply a<br/>\ndescription of the act, not the person who acted.<br/>\nNinja weren&#39;t some secret peasant society, either.<br/>\nHattori Hanzo? A samurai retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br/>\nYagyuu Jubei? From the Yagyuu family, a samurai family<br/>\nfrom Iga, who controlled the fief around Ueno and<br/>\nlater served as kenjutsu instructors to the Tokugawa<br/>\nbakufu. Sure, they probably trained in a wider arrange<br/>\nof war-making skills than your average samurai, to<br/>\ninclude subterfuge, stealth, etc., but is this any<br/>\ndifferent than military units/operatives who study the<br/>\nsame things now? Are Rangers or Green Berets a<br/>\nmystical cult? No--they&#39;re military operatives with<br/>\ndifferent training and missions than your normal<br/>\nsoldier. What we call ninja now were no different than<br/>\nthat. Could you call a maid hired to pass information<br/>\nshe overhears in her ladies chamber a shinobi? Sure<br/>\nyou could. Does she necessarily have to be trained to<br/>\nadminister death 37 different ways with a chopstick?<br/>\nOf course not. <br/>\n<br/>\n Your post gives the impression that you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have reseached Mr. Hayes<br/>\n&gt; and Mr. Hayes.  What methodolgy did you use for this<br/>\n&gt; reseach?  How much time<br/>\n&gt; was put into it?  What qualifications do you<br/>\n&gt; personally hold to make a valid<br/>\n&gt; assesment whether or not the activities of Mr. Hayes<br/>\n&gt; or Mr. Hatsumi are<br/>\n&gt; fraudlent?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You mean, other than a functioning brain and a working<br/>\nlevel knowledge of Japanese and Japanese history?<br/>\nNone, I suppose. If you want to buy into the hype, be<br/>\nmy guest. However, this is a HISTORY email list, not a<br/>\nmartial arts list. I study Japanese HISTORY, not<br/>\nmartial arts. Hayes or Hatsumi may have excellent<br/>\ntechniques for arm locks or foot sweeps--however, when<br/>\nyou can&#39;t accurately reproduce historical facts that I<br/>\ncould ask of the 5 year old girl next door, then you<br/>\nlack credibility. <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, since you brought it up, for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; whom are you an<br/>\n&gt; intellegence officer?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*I* didn&#39;t bring it up. Helly did. I simply responded<br/>\nto him. As for who employs me, there&#39;s a &quot;I&#39;d tell<br/>\nyou, but I&#39;d have to kill you&quot; joke in there just<br/>\ndying to get out, but I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s worth<br/>\nit. I&#39;m in the US Army stationed in Japan. No<br/>\nrelevance to this discussion whatsoever except in the<br/>\ncontext in which Helly, making a personal attack,<br/>\naddressed me, and I responded.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also suggest that if you want to see ninja done in a<br/>\nfun way, check out some Japanese movies. I&#39;ve<br/>\nmentioned &quot;Owl&#39;s Castle&quot; (Fukuro no shiro in<br/>\nJapanese). Excellent flick that does play around with<br/>\nthe mystical side of ninjutsu, but for the most part<br/>\nkeeps things...somewhat real. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Hayes is<br/>\nhardly a &quot;source&quot; of anything but Hollywood<br/>\nmisinformation. If this documentary is going to use<br/>\nhim as a source, then there&#39;s no reason for me to<br/>\nwaste my time clicking on the link, much less watching<br/>\nthe dang thing. And last I checked, Hayes learned from<br/>\nHatsumi. Ergo (That means &quot;therefore&quot;), I don&#39;t see<br/>\nmuch reason to be excited about him, either. Let me<br/>\nbreak it down: Hayes = fraud. Hatsumi taught Hayes<br/>\neverything he knows.

Masaaki Hatsumi is in the film and this is sufficient for me.   Each one is free to administer its knowledge as want.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOr ¿it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by the Budo Taijutsu?  Hayes will be wrong in his vision,  but by him many people knew to Sensei and they went to Japon to study true Budo.  Malstrolm as example.<br/>\n <br/>\nHow important is Hayes for the Bujinkan?  The people who train in the Bujinkan, do that - I think- from heart not because they have a shorter curved saber, it does not matter it of form but it of fund.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn my country we have a thought: &quot;when the words are not better than the silence, is better to silence&quot;.  I recommend you see the film and train dogs, not martial arts. Not with a heart closed.<br/>\n <br/>\nHelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; escribió:<br/>\n<br/>\n--- ahelly69 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahelly69@...\">ahelly69@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This proyect was made by Mr. Brandon Alvarez and is<br/>\n&gt; based in a deep <br/>\n&gt; research and interviews with real ninja masters like<br/>\n&gt; Dr. Masaaki <br/>\n&gt; Hatsumi, Stephen K.
