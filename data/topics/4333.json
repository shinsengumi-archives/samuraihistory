I wanted to know how the inheritance of the<br/>\nKa-mon is carried out.  For instance, when people get married whose<br/>\ncrest do they take, the bride or groom?  Are all the children in the<br/>\nfamily entitled to it?  And, did inheritance guidelines change over<br/>\ntime for the crest, for instance, at one point only first born boys<br/>\nwere entitled to inheritance?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anybody help her???<br/>\n<br/>\nthanx a lot<br/>\ncepo</div>",
