            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-690058683\">Hi there.<br/>\n       I will deal with much of the rest of my answer to this a bit later.  <br/>\n(Just how things are working out right now.)  But I do want to answer a couple <br/>\nthings right now.<br/>\n       The Shogun question: If memory serves me correctly, at one point, <br/>\nEmperor Ogimachi offered Nobunaga the Shogunate.  And he turned it down.  It seems <br/>\nto me that, as long as anybody else over him lived, including a figurehead <br/>\nemperor, he would never be satisfied.  Why have a figurehead, when he himself <br/>\ncould be BOTH the Emperor (titular ruler) AND the Shogun (actual ruler)?  If <br/>\nShogun Ashikaga Yoshitatsu was swept aside as so much chattel, what would stop <br/>\nOda from doing the same to the Emperor himself and unifying the two offices <br/>\nunder himself?  (Granted, this was essentially done in reverse during the Meiji <br/>\nRestoration in the late 1860s.  But if memory serves me correctly, it was the <br/>\nEmperor who directly challenged the Shogun in that one.)<br/>\n       The Akechi question: The incident I referred to was the 1577 Tamba <br/>\nseige and the fall of the Hatano clan.  Akechi achieved a bloodless surrender, <br/>\nmaking it unnecessary for Oda to have them put to death.  That was the start of <br/>\nit.  The remaining followers -- most likely the clan&#39;s retainers -- that <br/>\nsomehow survived the Oda fist, it appears, blamed Akechi for the deaths in that <br/>\nincident, although it was not his fault.  Among the deaths was a mother, as the <br/>\nstory goes, and the retainers claimed Akechi&#39;s mother in vengeance for it.  <br/>\nThis may have been the last straw.  The line from the death of his (Akechi&#39;s) <br/>\nmother to the feet of Oda Nobunaga was, for Mitsuhide, a very short line.  His <br/>\nown mother was killed in vengeance by the Hatano retainers because Oda killed <br/>\nthose whom Akechi had said would not be, the Hatano retainers holding Akechi <br/>\nMitsuhide responsible for the lives that Nobunaga took.  Granted, this story may <br/>\nor may not be true, but it&#39;s just wacky enough to BE true.<br/>\n       In several readings I have done, although Akechi was one of Oda&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;inner circle generals&quot;, it seems that Nobunaga, though he treated his retainers <br/>\nwith not the greatest of respect, took special pleasure in the humiliation of <br/>\nthis one general.  It is my estimation that, as the saying goes, enough became <br/>\ntoo much, and when Oda made it personal -- even in a round-about way, and <br/>\nregardless of the status of women, the killing of one&#39;s mother makes it VERY <br/>\npersonal -- that was all Akechi needed.<br/>\n       It is incidents like Tamba -- if completely true -- that make me <br/>\nreally wonder if Oda Nobunaga was not just in it for unification or power, but the <br/>\nenjoyment of the brutality.  (Owari isn&#39;t the biggest of provinces, after all, <br/>\nand one can only get so much brutality there.)<br/>\n       For now, that&#39;s bout it.  I&#39;ll get to the others in the next few days. <br/>\n :-)  Hope this clears some things up.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater<br/>\nTim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

Also, I find Hideyoshi a far more diligent character, and generally devoid of dishonour (despite the mental failings and brutality of the 1590s).<br/>\nIn regard though to what Tim mentioned about the Mother of Akechi Mitsuhide, because he had promised safe passage to the besieged parties, an agreement then overturned by Nobunaga, other retainers took it upon themselves to punish the &quot;liar&quot; Mitsuhide, and in the process killed his mother. There were other factors, such as his excellent poetry, which the lesser poet Nobunaga continuously abused, but the murder of his mother was probably a far more serious cause of the attack on Nobunaga at the Honno-ji.<br/>\nMichael<br/>\n<br/>\nMasamori Masami &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oni_shogun@...\">oni_shogun@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nHey Tim, <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you could clear some things up I would appreciate it.  For <br/>\ninstance, why would Nobunaga want to replace the Emperor, if he <br/>\nconquered Japan he would have gotten the title of Shogun, which <br/>\ncarries all the power. The Emperor is just a figure head. It would <br/>\nseem to make more sense to be Shogun than to try and over throw the <br/>\nEmperor, where everyones ultimate loyalty laid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, Nobunaga is betrayed twice by two brothers. In 1556, <br/>\nNobuhiro, Nobunaga&#39;s elder brother, plotted with the new (and <br/>\nhostile) lord of Mino, Saitô Yoshitatsu, an act Nobunaga would later <br/>\npardon him for. In 1557, Oda Nobuyuki and Shibata Katsuie plot <br/>\nagainst Oda Nobunaga in Owari. Though Shibata is spared, Nobuyuki is <br/>\nkilled. Back in feudal japan its more surprising that Nobuhiro was <br/>\nspared, rather than Nobuyuki being killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, why trust his sister (O-ichi) to some one who betrayed his <br/>\ntrust (Katsuie) when he could marry her off to Asai Nagamasa to <br/>\nsolitify an allaince (which was a very common practice). Then when <br/>\nAsai back an enemy of Nobunaga, he became an enemy and by that time <br/>\nKatsuie had earned back Nobunaga&#39;s trust, so why not reunite them?<br/>\n<br/>\nForthly, you say Toyotomi Hideyoshi used dishonorable techniques to <br/>\nclimb to his right hand position. I was just wondering if you could <br/>\ngive some examples?<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, you say, &quot;He needlessly had the captives that Akechi had <br/>\nspared to effect a surrender put to death -- including a mother, <br/>\nwhich was the motivator that cost Akechi his own mother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you could elaborate on how the death of a mother was <br/>\nthe &quot;motivator that cost Akechi his own mother.&quot; I would appreciate <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am not saying everything Nobunaga did was morally right. Its <br/>\ntrue he used burtal tactics, but when the country has been at war <br/>\nfor 250 years, &quot;death is necessary if you want peace.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Eponymous13@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi there.<br/>\n&gt;        I agree with you to a point.

I read somewhere -- and I <br/>\ndo not <br/>\n&gt; remember where -- that Nobunaga&#39;s ultimate goal was to conquer all <br/>\nof Japan and <br/>\n&gt; then replace the Emperor with himself.  (Any truth to this, <br/>\nanybody?)<br/>\n&gt;        According to the readings I&#39;ve done, as for Nobunaga <br/>\nhimself, he was a <br/>\n&gt; brutal man, one of the two most brutal men alive at the time.  <br/>\n(The other was <br/>\n&gt; Tsar Ivan IV of Russia, whose lifespan nearly mirrored that of <br/>\nNobunaga, the <br/>\n&gt; former barely outliving the latter, Ivan living 1530-1584 to <br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; 1534-1582.)  He killed his own brother because of a failed revolt <br/>\nin 1557 (sparing <br/>\n&gt; his then-twice-future brother-in-law Shibata Katsuie), forced a <br/>\nsister (O-ichi) <br/>\n&gt; to divorce Shibata, whom he had forced to MARRY (I believe around <br/>\nthe age of <br/>\n&gt; 11!!!!!) to solidify an alliance, so he could marry her off to <br/>\nANOTHER warlord <br/>\n&gt; (Asai Nagamasa) to solidify THAT alliance, killed that brother-in-<br/>\nlaw when he <br/>\n&gt; backed an (I believe) ages-old ally (the Asakura at Anegawa, <br/>\n1570), remarried <br/>\n&gt; the sister to her first husband, and rewarded a man (Toyotomi <br/>\nHideyoshi) who <br/>\n&gt; used dishonorable techniques to climb to his right hand position.  <br/>\nHe <br/>\n&gt; needlessly had the captives that Akechi had spared to effect a <br/>\nsurrender put to death <br/>\n&gt; -- including a mother, which was the motivator that cost Akechi <br/>\nhis own <br/>\n&gt; mother, and in effect started the wheels turning which brought <br/>\nNobunaga to his <br/>\n&gt; seppuku at Honno-ji.<br/>\n&gt;        For the good he did, which there was certainly at least <br/>\nsome -- <br/>\n&gt; including the invention of the sumo dohyo ring and the start of <br/>\nthe unification <br/>\n&gt; process -- it was better in my humble estimation that he not be <br/>\nthe one to finish <br/>\n&gt; the unification process.  It was accomplished much more peacefully <br/>\nwith <br/>\n&gt; Hideyoshi and Tokugawa.  (BTW, I have my thoughts about that 1591 <br/>\nedict, too, but I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to get into them here.)<br/>\n&gt;        Hope this helps.  :-D<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later<br/>\n&gt; Tim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-65213305\">Hey Tim, <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you could clear some things up I would appreciate it.  For <br/>\ninstance, why would Nobunaga want to replace the Emperor, if he <br/>\nconquered Japan he would have gotten the title of Shogun, which <br/>\ncarries all the power. The Emperor is just a figure head. It would <br/>\nseem to make more sense to be Shogun than to try and over throw the <br/>\nEmperor, where everyones ultimate loyalty laid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, Nobunaga is betrayed twice by two brothers. In 1556, <br/>\nNobuhiro, Nobunaga&#39;s elder brother, plotted with the new (and <br/>\nhostile) lord of Mino, Saitô Yoshitatsu, an act Nobunaga would later <br/>\npardon him for. In 1557, Oda Nobuyuki and Shibata Katsuie plot <br/>\nagainst Oda Nobunaga in Owari. Though Shibata is spared, Nobuyuki is <br/>\nkilled. Back in feudal japan its more surprising that Nobuhiro was <br/>\nspared, rather than Nobuyuki being killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, why trust his sister (O-ichi) to some one who betrayed his <br/>\ntrust (Katsuie) when he could marry her off to Asai Nagamasa to <br/>\nsolitify an allaince (which was a very common practice). Then when <br/>\nAsai back an enemy of Nobunaga, he became an enemy and by that time <br/>\nKatsuie had earned back Nobunaga&#39;s trust, so why not reunite them?<br/>\n<br/>\nForthly, you say Toyotomi Hideyoshi used dishonorable techniques to <br/>\nclimb to his right hand position. I was just wondering if you could <br/>\ngive some examples?<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, you say, &quot;He needlessly had the captives that Akechi had <br/>\nspared to effect a surrender put to death -- including a mother, <br/>\nwhich was the motivator that cost Akechi his own mother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you could elaborate on how the death of a mother was <br/>\nthe &quot;motivator that cost Akechi his own mother.&quot; I would appreciate <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am not saying everything Nobunaga did was morally right. Its <br/>\ntrue he used burtal tactics, but when the country has been at war <br/>\nfor 250 years, &quot;death is necessary if you want peace.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Eponymous13@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi there.<br/>\n&gt;        I agree with you to a point.

Was he a great general who got done what <br/>\nwas needed? Or was he a brutal war monger?  Did he realize the need <br/>\nto unify Japan? Or was he just power-hungry?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally i think Nobunaga was a great visonary who saw the need, <br/>\nand had the will, to unify Japan. And although some of his tactics <br/>\nmight have been considered brutal, Mount Hiei for example, in the <br/>\nlong run it presevered life.  By committing one big act of violence, <br/>\nsuch as Mount Hiei, it sent a message to any other warrior-monks or <br/>\nsamurai clans that might have been thinking of attacking the Oda. It <br/>\nshowed the consequences of messing with the Oda. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that if Nobunaga wasn&#39;t betrayed by Akechi Mitsuhide, <br/>\nhe would have been successful in uniting Japan. Which would have <br/>\nushered in centuries of peace not seen until 18 years later under <br/>\nthe Tokugawa Shogunate.</div>",
