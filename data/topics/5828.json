            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1034834807\">I just wanted to take some time to introduce myself, and <br/>\ncomment on how neat it is to know that there are groups here that <br/>\nare interested in this topic.  I would like to know if there is <br/>\nanyone who can assist me in researching my family name.I come from a <br/>\nlong line of samurai and my ancestors come from the Hiroshima <br/>\nPrefecture, and Kamakura, I believe. My father had the opportunity <br/>\nto be in Japan while he was in the Army after the Second World War <br/>\nand visit our distant relatives. And had the privelige to see the <br/>\nfamily tree in Hiroshima Prefecture.  I know that my name can be <br/>\ntraced back to about 800 years, and that they were samurai. My last <br/>\nname is Kodama.  And from what my pop and grandparents have told me, <br/>\nthat it is indeed a very well respected name. Also, that my direct <br/>\nancestors were over 5feet 11 to 6 feet tall. Which is very unusual <br/>\nfor Japanese men.  ( I am 5&#39;11 and 3/4 &quot; tall.) That&#39;s about all for <br/>\nnow, but I look forward to hearing from you folk.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care and God Bless<br/>\n<br/>\nYoshio Kodama, Sergeant, US Army</div>",
