They were active in the Phillipines and <br/>\nsiam for sure, often as mercenaries. Whether they were Christian I&#39;d <br/>\nhave to re-research, but some of them WERE Christians who left when <br/>\nChristianity was forbidden by the Tokugawa. My favorite Christian <br/>\ndaimyo, Konishi Yukinaga (one of the 3 lead generals in Hideyoshi&#39;s <br/>\ninvasion of Korea) picked the wrong side at the battle of Sekigahara <br/>\nin 1600 (he fought against the Tokugawa) and was killed.<br/>\n   I can look through my notes if you want more details.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Hazlett<br/>\n(I was a Japanese History student, now I&#39;m studying Nautical <br/>\nArchaeology -- currently researching Portuguese shipping in the <br/>\nsisxteenth century - I&#39;m researching how the Naos that went to Japan <br/>\nwere built)</div>",
