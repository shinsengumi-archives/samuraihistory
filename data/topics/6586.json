It seems to me that the urge to collect Japanese swords should be<br/>\ncurbed until a decent sword may be obtained. I think to collect anything,<br/>\nyou must buy the best quality you can with the money available. Therefore if<br/>\nyou only have �200-�300 you might be better advised to buy a reasonable<br/>\nkogai or tsuba rather than a repro sword which really is not a Japanese<br/>\nsword at all, only a pale facsimile. Early collectors are rather vulnerable<br/>\nin this respect and should curb their enthusiasm until they can make<br/>\ninformed judgements. Now, although I am a lifetime collector of Japanese<br/>\nswords, I know that the swords that I really would like to have, are way<br/>\nbeyond my reach unless a miracle involving the national lottery occurs and<br/>\nprobably even then, they are unobtainable.

It seems to me that the urge to collect Japanese swords should be<br/>\ncurbed until a decent sword may be obtained. I think to collect anything,<br/>\nyou must buy the best quality you can with the money available. Therefore if<br/>\nyou only have £200-£300 you might be better advised to buy a reasonable<br/>\nkogai or tsuba rather than a repro sword which really is not a Japanese<br/>\nsword at all, only a pale facsimile.
