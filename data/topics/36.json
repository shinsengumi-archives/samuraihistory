I am a new member of this <br/>\ngroup, so I would like to say nice to meet you to all the members and wish a <br/>\nmerry christmas and happy new year. I am a brazilian lawyer who love Samurai <br/>\nCulture and history and along my 61 years of age I have been reading about <br/>\nsuch involving culture that I love.<br/>\nIt is a pleasure to be in touch with other people that enjoy getting to know <br/>\nmore and more about the Samurais and their history! There is a very <br/>\ninteresting book about Bushido that I would like to recommend you highly. It <br/>\nis published in Spain and its title is &quot; Zen y Artes Marciales&quot; (Zen and <br/>\nMarcial Arts) The writer is Taisen Deshimaru a master in Zen. Luiz Cï¿½rcamo <br/>\nEditor. San Raimundo, 58 - Madrid. This is one of the books I like the most <br/>\nabout Zen and Marcial Arts. I know that there is a french edition, but I am <br/>\nnot quite sure if there is an english edition yet.<br/>\nI have just read the new biography written about Miyamoto Musashi that has <br/>\nsome information about &quot;Bo-jutsu&quot;.<br/>\nI like Bo-jutsu and I would like to receive some information about the <br/>\nwooden bastons, its size and interesting information about this art!<br/>\nso, once more nice to meet you!<br/>\nI am sorry for my poor english<br/>\nbest wishes.<br/>\nAntenor C.
