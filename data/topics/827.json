The<br/>\n&quot;Vikings&quot; from Scandinavia often used a large battle axe in their left<br/>\nhand so as to catch their opponents on their unshielded side. At the<br/>\nsame time they could carry a smaller lighter weapon with which to defend<br/>\nthemselves whilst they were getting ready for another blow with their<br/>\naxe. Does anyone know if the samurai ever carried two weapons at once<br/>\nlike this, especially an axe and a tanto?
