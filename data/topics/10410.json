I know that isn&#39;t a very satisfying answer, but there are plenty of examples where how someone looks doesn&#39;t correlate with their ancestry. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, remember that the people of central asia have a lot of the &quot;east asian look&quot; in them.  All I mean by that is a lot of the populations just north of Iran have ethnic groups that &quot;look&quot; chinese or korean or japanese.  And depending on where she is from in Iran, there are different ethnic groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have any actual documentation (names, writing, jewelry, etc...), then your best bet [at some point in the future] would be to do genome sequencing, and see how you (or your parent descended from her) compare.  In particular, if this is a maternal grandmother AND you assume that her mother was of Japanese descent, then you could compare the mitochondrial DNA in her child (your mom or dad) to that of a japanese population (or other populations), and see if there are significant matches.  This isn&#39;t my field of expertise, and I don&#39;t know how distinct the Japanese population&#39;s mitochondrial DNA (as a whole) is relative to the rest of eastern asia, but this could be a future avenue of exploration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t trust the companies that perform human genome sequencing just yet, but in the not too distant future they should be fairly reliable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking for documentation, then you should probably consider the Japanese government.  They had very tight population (entering/leaving) controls all the way through WWII.  So, she (or her parents) would almost certainly have to have registered their intent to leave the country and then receive permission.<br/>\n<br/>\n-dennis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chad Janzemini &lt;chadjanzemini@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i have attached a photo of her, tell me what you think. also if i was to tell you her name or maiden name itÂ wouldn&#39;tÂ helpÂ becauseÂ i think she might be half or lessÂ Japanese, from her mother and iÂ don&#39;tÂ know her mothers name.Â that&#39;sÂ why im researchingÂ JapaneseÂ migrations toÂ IranÂ to narrow the search down. my family members have always said she could have it in her and judging from the photo you could see its a good chance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________<br/>\n&gt;  From: Oyakata &lt;oyakata@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 30, 2012 12:11 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] info on japanese settlement in iran<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Â  <br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; I am not aware of any large-scale migration from Japan to Persia / Iran.
