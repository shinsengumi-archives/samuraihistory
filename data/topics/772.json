What Brand had to say<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t at all stupid and it is very possible that he&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; correct.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Did I say it was stupid? I said it&#39;s not a name.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&quot;Kami&quot; means &quot;god&quot; or &quot;deity&quot; specifically, not &quot;the spirit of something.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;So first of all, it&#39;s impossible for &quot;Torakami&quot; to means &quot;spirit of the<br/>\n  &gt;tiger.&quot; If anything, it would be &quot;tiger god.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; As far as my name goes, there is nothing odd<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; about it and it is very much a Japanese name that was<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; given to me by my great-grandmother who happened to be<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Japanese, which goes to show that you&#39;re not as much<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; an authority as you seem to give yourself credit for<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; being.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Then perhaps you will recall that my exact words were &quot;Without the kanji, <br/>\n  &gt;it<br/>\n  &gt;would be impossible. Frankly &quot;Taneiko&quot; doesn&#39;t sound typically Japanese to<br/>\n  &gt;me. Taneko would, but Taneiko... something seems odd.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Well, here goes.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Women&#39;s names using &quot;-ko&quot; endings are typically one kanji (haru, yuki, <br/>\n  &gt;hana)<br/>\n  &gt;plus the finishing &quot;-ko.&quot; There is *no* kanji that has &quot;tamei&quot; as a <br/>\n  &gt;reading.<br/>\n  &gt;To get to &quot;tanei&quot; you need two kanji (or more) to produce tane+i, or <br/>\n  &gt;ta+nei,<br/>\n  &gt;or ta+ne+i (the last one, meaning a four kanji name, is statistically<br/>\n  &gt;improbable. Therefore we&#39;re stuck with &quot;tane+i&quot; or &quot;ta+nei.&quot; Since there <br/>\n  &gt;few<br/>\n  &gt;kanji with the reading &quot;nei&quot;, but not often seen in names, we&#39;re<br/>\n  &gt;functionally limited, then to &quot;tane+i&quot;, which produces the question, which<br/>\n  &gt;kanji combination would allow a (positive meaning) name combining the<br/>\n  &gt;syllables tane+i+ko?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;There are a few names that are listed in my books with the reading &quot;Taneko&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;(no &quot;i&quot;) -- one &quot;tane&quot; meaning &quot;seed/kernel&quot; and the other meaning<br/>\n  &gt;&quot;egg/seed&quot; or &quot;sincerity.&quot; There is a third &quot;tane&quot; which pops up in names <br/>\n  &gt;--<br/>\n  &gt;&quot;issue/offspring&quot; -- but it&#39;s very unusual these days.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;So what we have is a very improbably Tane*i*ko, but a very probable Tane[no<br/>\n  &gt;*i*]ko.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Now, it&#39;s possible that whoever Romanized the name added the &quot;i&quot; to make<br/>\n  &gt;sure people would pronounce it properly (like the errant &quot;y&quot; that sometimes<br/>\n  &gt;pops up in Ma[y]eda and U[y]eda. These variant readings are common, <br/>\n  &gt;however.<br/>\n  &gt;Taneiko is not. Therefore, again, we&#39;re back to &quot;either the name is Taneko<br/>\n  &gt;and someone mis-Romanized it&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not a typical Japanese name.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Do you find a flaw with the argument or with the [original] conclusion?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;For the record, Japanese onomastics, especially historical onomastics, is a<br/>\n  &gt;field I study, and I study it seriously.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Before you get all huffy, perhaps you should consider that some people *do*<br/>\n  &gt;know more than you do.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Tony<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I said it&#39;s not a name.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Kami&quot; means &quot;god&quot; or &quot;deity&quot; specifically, not &quot;the spirit of something.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;So first of all, it&#39;s impossible for &quot;Torakami&quot; to means &quot;spirit of the<br/>\n&gt;tiger.&quot; If anything, it would be &quot;tiger god.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As far as my name goes, there is nothing odd<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about it and it is very much a Japanese name that was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; given to me by my great-grandmother who happened to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Japanese, which goes to show that you&#39;re not as much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an authority as you seem to give yourself credit for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then perhaps you will recall that my exact words were &quot;Without the kanji, <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;would be impossible. Frankly &quot;Taneiko&quot; doesn&#39;t sound typically Japanese to<br/>\n&gt;me. Taneko would, but Taneiko... something seems odd.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, here goes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Women&#39;s names using &quot;-ko&quot; endings are typically one kanji (haru, yuki, <br/>\n&gt;hana)<br/>\n&gt;plus the finishing &quot;-ko.&quot; There is *no* kanji that has &quot;tamei&quot; as a <br/>\n&gt;reading.<br/>\n&gt;To get to &quot;tanei&quot; you need two kanji (or more) to produce tane+i, or <br/>\n&gt;ta+nei,<br/>\n&gt;or ta+ne+i (the last one, meaning a four kanji name, is statistically<br/>\n&gt;improbable. Therefore we&#39;re stuck with &quot;tane+i&quot; or &quot;ta+nei.&quot; Since there <br/>\n&gt;few<br/>\n&gt;kanji with the reading &quot;nei&quot;, but not often seen in names, we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;functionally limited, then to &quot;tane+i&quot;, which produces the question, which<br/>\n&gt;kanji combination would allow a (positive meaning) name combining the<br/>\n&gt;syllables tane+i+ko?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are a few names that are listed in my books with the reading &quot;Taneko&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(no &quot;i&quot;) -- one &quot;tane&quot; meaning &quot;seed/kernel&quot; and the other meaning<br/>\n&gt;&quot;egg/seed&quot; or &quot;sincerity.&quot; There is a third &quot;tane&quot; which pops up in names <br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;&quot;issue/offspring&quot; -- but it&#39;s very unusual these days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So what we have is a very improbably Tane*i*ko, but a very probable Tane[no<br/>\n&gt;*i*]ko.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, it&#39;s possible that whoever Romanized the name added the &quot;i&quot; to make<br/>\n&gt;sure people would pronounce it properly (like the errant &quot;y&quot; that sometimes<br/>\n&gt;pops up in Ma[y]eda and U[y]eda. These variant readings are common, <br/>\n&gt;however.<br/>\n&gt;Taneiko is not. Therefore, again, we&#39;re back to &quot;either the name is Taneko<br/>\n&gt;and someone mis-Romanized it&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not a typical Japanese name.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Do you find a flaw with the argument or with the [original] conclusion?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For the record, Japanese onomastics, especially historical onomastics, is a<br/>\n&gt;field I study, and I study it seriously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Before you get all huffy, perhaps you should consider that some people *do*<br/>\n&gt;know more than you do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>",

I&#39;d like to be able to say &quot;Tora no kami&quot; hit me<br/>\nfirst, but I have to get my head back into some Muromachi texts for a while<br/>\nto reformat my mind-set. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Like another poster on here stated,<br/>\n&gt; &#39;tora no tamashii&#39; would litteraly mean &#39;spirit of the tiger&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed it would; but it wouldn&#39;t be a name, either. The thing is, names<br/>\ndon&#39;t really literally translate well. Heck, I used to live in Stone Well<br/>\nMouth Public Field, commuting to work via Western Samurai Pond Bag and then<br/>\nto Circle Center. Later I moved to There Are Turtles, and after that lived<br/>\nin Big Eternal Preservation. (That is, Shakujii Koen, Seibu Ikebukuro,<br/>\nMarunouchi, Kameari, and Ogikubo &lt;G&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Toranokami would be pretty cool, but I don&#39;t know how well it would<br/>\n&gt; fit in &#39;reality&#39; since all of the ~no kamis were always preceeded by<br/>\n&gt; the name of a province.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, but that&#39;s a kami of a different color. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",

Frankly &quot;Taneiko&quot; doesn&#39;t sound typically Japanese to<br/>\nme. Taneko would, but Taneiko... something seems odd.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen&#39;s names using &quot;-ko&quot; endings are typically one kanji (haru, yuki, hana)<br/>\nplus the finishing &quot;-ko.&quot; There is *no* kanji that has &quot;tamei&quot; as a reading.<br/>\nTo get to &quot;tanei&quot; you need two kanji (or more) to produce tane+i, or ta+nei,<br/>\nor ta+ne+i (the last one, meaning a four kanji name, is statistically<br/>\nimprobable. Therefore we&#39;re stuck with &quot;tane+i&quot; or &quot;ta+nei.&quot; Since there few<br/>\nkanji with the reading &quot;nei&quot;, but not often seen in names, we&#39;re<br/>\nfunctionally limited, then to &quot;tane+i&quot;, which produces the question, which<br/>\nkanji combination would allow a (positive meaning) name combining the<br/>\nsyllables tane+i+ko?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few names that are listed in my books with the reading &quot;Taneko&quot;<br/>\n(no &quot;i&quot;) -- one &quot;tane&quot; meaning &quot;seed/kernel&quot; and the other meaning<br/>\n&quot;egg/seed&quot; or &quot;sincerity.&quot; There is a third &quot;tane&quot; which pops up in names --<br/>\n&quot;issue/offspring&quot; -- but it&#39;s very unusual these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what we have is a very improbably Tane*i*ko, but a very probable Tane[no<br/>\n*i*]ko.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it&#39;s possible that whoever Romanized the name added the &quot;i&quot; to make<br/>\nsure people would pronounce it properly (like the errant &quot;y&quot; that sometimes<br/>\npops up in Ma[y]eda and U[y]eda. These variant readings are common, however.<br/>\nTaneiko is not. Therefore, again, we&#39;re back to &quot;either the name is Taneko<br/>\nand someone mis-Romanized it&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not a typical Japanese name.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you find a flaw with the argument or with the [original] conclusion?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, Japanese onomastics, especially historical onomastics, is a<br/>\nfield I study, and I study it seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you get all huffy, perhaps you should consider that some people *do*<br/>\nknow more than you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",
