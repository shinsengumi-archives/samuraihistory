I am not <br/>\n&gt;saying they were less honorable.  But the ideal of going off and <br/>\n&gt;killing all the bad muslim people (just a statement of the feeling of <br/>\n&gt;the time of the knights, I have nothing against muslims as a group) <br/>\n&gt;for the glory of god and holy mother church or you will burn in hell <br/>\n&gt;for all eternity does not seem any more honorable.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree, most of them by modern standards were thugs and killers. I&#39;m <br/>\ntalking more about the ideal knight, who is supposed to protect those <br/>\nweaker than himself, practice charity, and otherwise act like a decent <br/>\nsort of guy. These are ideals that were put forward by bards and others <br/>\nin that period. Also there is quite a bit of difference between <br/>\nface/shame cultures and guilt/sin cultures and I&#39;m hopelessly Western in <br/>\nmy outlook towards these two approaches. Now in reality it&#39;s never that <br/>\nclearcut, but I&#39;m only talking about perfection here, something I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever really approached closely except for idiocy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Scott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottc_4@...\">scottc_4@...</a>&gt;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottc_4@...\">scottc_4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Heaven and Earth Review<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I read the review of Heaven and Earth that was linked here a while <br/>\n&gt;ago when I asked about the movie on DVD.  I can tell that guy didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;like it, and I think he sees Kurasawa as god, at least he acts like <br/>\n&gt;it.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He some ways he should, Kurosawa was a great director, his earlier films <br/>\nwere excellent and not just the chanbara ones. Rent High and Low from a <br/>\nvideo store if possible or some of the other films he made in the middle <br/>\nof his career. Still won&#39;t mind seeing Heaven and Earth one time. Even <br/>\nbad chanbara is better that the best Hollywood teen comedy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;eatswithscissorsrunswithmonkeys&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:intp@...\">intp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: To put this in perspective<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This &#39;I wanna be a Sammy-rai&#39; conversation is analgous to <br/>\n&gt;a bunch of Japanese people sitting in Japan right now <br/>\n&gt;saying <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;I wanna be a confederate! <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are some, I&#39;ve met them. Scary thought eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If that makes no sense, then you get my point.

It might be closer to on topic. Better still <br/>\nfuedal period Japanese. There might be one or two on the list that could <br/>\nread it! ^_^ Happier than my current reading assignment at least, <br/>\nChinmoku, where I get to learn all the delightful words for torture, <br/>\npain and suffering and the happy fate of the Christians in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
