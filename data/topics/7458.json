            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-780881930\">Martial Arts and Japanese Culture<br/>\nBy Jigme Daniels<br/>\nSpecial to The Epoch Times Aug 09, 2005 <br/>\n<br/>\nJapanese martial arts, particularly those descended from classical-<br/>\nera ones, are a distinctive combination of art and science. Borne of <br/>\nhundreds of years of internecine warfare, there were (at <br/>\nconservative estimates) over 1000 different systems of combative <br/>\ntechnique, each with their own peculiarities. What survives of these <br/>\nare fascinating artifacts of the time and place of their development <br/>\nthat offer modern students a unique opportunity to practice an <br/>\nancient form.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to a myth, the islands of Japan were formed by the two <br/>\ndeities Izanagi and Izanami. They dipped their spear into the ocean, <br/>\nchurned it, and created the first island, Onogoro, from the drops of <br/>\nsalty water which fell from the spear. In those early myths, gods <br/>\nare described as partaking in ritual combat (wrestling, probably a <br/>\nvery ancient forerunner to modern Sumo) and using weapons as tools <br/>\nfor creation as well as destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 1200-1600, Japan was at war with herself, and large-scale <br/>\narmored combat flourished. Martial arts of this period all featured <br/>\neffective use of pole arms (spears, glaives and the like), some <br/>\nsword, and general rudimentary grappling. By the time of the Battle <br/>\nof Sekigahara in 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved into the final stage of <br/>\nunifying a large number of independent fiefs under a central, <br/>\nconsolidated power. He established a new capital, Tokyoto (or Edo), <br/>\nand contrived ways to keep the local rulers unable to mount <br/>\nchallenges to his authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the relative peace and isolation of the Tokugawa era took hold <br/>\n(trade was shut-down with outside countries except through two very <br/>\ntightly controlled ports), the warrior class had less to do. <br/>\nIndividuals began to develop combative skills that were less <br/>\napplicable to battlefield-use and more geared toward defending one&#39;s <br/>\nemployer and duelling. Warriors traveled from province to province <br/>\nand challenged the best instructors; this was known as Musha Shugyo <br/>\n(warrior&#39;s austerities). If the shugyosha (person undergoing the <br/>\ntraining) lost, then he would become a student of the victor. Thus <br/>\nfamous systems were modified to suit specific needs for this type of <br/>\nencounter. Arts also specialized in only a few weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a contrast to the preceding warring-states period, where <br/>\nBushi (martial experts) of higher class were expected to be familiar <br/>\nwith everything from archery to dressage, and spears to dirks.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the next two centuries, the role of the warrior caste changed, <br/>\nwhich was reflected in the arts that they practiced and taught. In <br/>\nthe mid 1800&#39;s, Japan was reopened to the rest of the world. By the <br/>\nlate 1800&#39;s many members of the recently-abolished Samurai class <br/>\nsuddenly found themselves without stipends, so began teaching <br/>\ncommoners (which was previously considered in poor taste). It bears <br/>\nmention that what was taught publicly was the Omote (outside, front-<br/>\nface) of an art; the Ura (rear, what is not immediately apparent) <br/>\nwas still held in reserve for a select few.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile more comprehensive arts were still being taught, Kano Jigoro <br/>\nfounded the Kodokan (house for study of the way) in 1882. Kano <br/>\nadapted the dangerous techniques of classical jujutsu into the sport <br/>\nof Judo (a kind of jacket wrestling). By doing so, Kano contributed <br/>\na critical element of bringing obscure war arts to the general <br/>\npopulace. Japanese combative disciplines were also taken abroad <br/>\n(U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was an active student of Judo).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the late teens, the arts of Okinawa (tode, te or karate- <br/>\noriginally meaning China hand, now empty hand) were imported to the <br/>\nmain islands of Japan. These civilian boxing systems became popular <br/>\nin Okinawa in primary and secondary schools (as Judo had done in <br/>\nJapan). Note that karate is really outside of the purview <br/>\nof &#39;Japanese fighting disciplines&#39;, but has become strongly <br/>\nidentified with Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther popular Japanese arts that emerged during the last century <br/>\ninclude Shorinji Kempo (founded by a Japanese monk who combined <br/>\nChinese and Japanese methods), Aikido (based on classical jujutsu) <br/>\nand Kendo (way of the sword, based on classical swordsmanship; kendo <br/>\nhas been in existence for 200 years but was standardized in the <br/>\nearly 1900&#39;s). Though none of these arts have the depth or <br/>\ncomplexity of their forbears, they still manage to provide a glimpse <br/>\ninto the ancient Japanese fighting arts and are accessible to people <br/>\nof all ages and backgrounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nJigme Daniels has been training in traditional Japanese martial arts <br/>\nfor over 20 years, and teaching for more than 10.</div>",
