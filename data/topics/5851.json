            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1188150978\">Gentlemen and Ladies<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your responses, the reason for my dilemma is that I&#39;m listing <br/>\nthese swords in a catalogue for an Museum exhibition for the general public <br/>\nin the US.  Like you all are, I am too, familiar with Shaku etc. I was <br/>\ninterested (seeing as what Japans secondary measurement is) seeing what your <br/>\nsecondary measurement was. Harry, I laughed myself to within a gnats c**k of <br/>\na heart attack, and you can&#39;t put that into metric either.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I just use this airtime to remind you all of the forthcoming &quot;Tosho: The <br/>\nYoshihara Tradition of Japanese Swordmaking&quot; Exhibition at the Pacific Asia <br/>\nMuseum in Pasadena CA. It is from March to June next year.(Just a little <br/>\ntopical side-note about myself, I cared for the swords in the British Museum <br/>\nexhibition from when they were newly polished in 2000, up until Feb 2003).  <br/>\nAdditionally the Pacific Asia Museum is a private, non-profit museum. They <br/>\nare trying to raise the final $10,000 at the moment for the exhibition <br/>\ncatalogue, if anyone can assist it would be greatly appreciated. If you <br/>\nwould like to make a donation, please contact the Museum and specify that <br/>\nthe donation is for the catalogue. The catalogue will contain historically <br/>\ninteresting pictures of Shodai Kuniie, as well as photography of great <br/>\nswords including A  large katana by shodai Kuniie with a fantastic horimono, <br/>\nOno Yoshimitsu&#39;s Yamatorige (photographed by Fujishiro Okisato) and many <br/>\nswords by the Yoshihara family members and former deshi. Please keep an eye <br/>\non the Pacific Asia Museum website for updates.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacificasiamuseum.org/calendar/exhibits.htm\">http://www.pacificasiamuseum.org/calendar/exhibits.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYours, trying to bring Japanese sword exhibitions to the west.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Martin<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.traditionaloshigata.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Paul Martin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pmartin6@...\">pmartin6@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai@...\">token_kenkyu_kai@...</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:token_kenkyu_kai@...\">token_kenkyu_kai@...</a><br/>\n&gt;CC: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mastersword53777@yahoogroups.com\">mastersword53777@yahoogroups.com</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihonto@yahoogroups.com\">nihonto@yahoogroups.com</a>,   <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Gendai Measurements ;-)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 30 Oct 2004 10:32:53 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My American Fellows<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was wondering what system do you all use to measure your blades, seeing <br/>\n&gt;as no-one really wants to use shaku and Japans secondary unit is CMs. I <br/>\n&gt;believe that you are doggedly keeping the feet and inches part of <br/>\n&gt;imperialism (as well as gallons), is this still the case when it comes to <br/>\n&gt;Japanese swords, or do you make the exception in this case and use the <br/>\n&gt;metric system?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Paul<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
