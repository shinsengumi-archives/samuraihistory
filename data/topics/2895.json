            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-694809733\">Hi.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the late response to this post and my apologies if someone else <br/>\nhas already addressed this issue.  I am trying to get caught up on my <br/>\nlist-reading, and am doing a fairly bad job.  Maybe when winter break <br/>\ncomes...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my understanding is that what later becomes referred to as Bushido <br/>\nhas many precursors that appeared prior to _Hagakure_.  It is a little out <br/>\nof my period, but I recall that Yamaga Soko (1622-1685) wrote a treatise (or <br/>\nportion thereof) that was entitled &quot;shido&quot;.  In it he sets out what he <br/>\nbelieves to be the correct comportment of a member of the samurai class.<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from these all-encompassing &quot;this is what a warrior is (or should be)&quot; <br/>\ntype of texts, there are many ways in which warrior ideals were disseminated <br/>\nand/or propaganidized.  Not the least of which would have been the war tales <br/>\n-- albeit, as originally oral tales meant for nonliterate audiences.  Also, <br/>\nmany high-ranking warrior leaders from the Kamakura era onward wrote buke <br/>\nkakun &quot;warrior house codes&quot; which were short treatises usually with a target <br/>\naudience of the writer&#39;s successor/descendants as well as the higher ranking <br/>\nretainers.  This is not to suggest, however, that there was anywhere near a <br/>\nconsensus as to &quot;a warrior is X type of person, dresses in Y type of <br/>\nclothing, and comports himself in Z manner&quot;, and as such no tidy overarching <br/>\nideal of a samurai to which all aspired.  So the kakun, although exhibiting <br/>\nsome similarities to one another, really reflected the inidividual <br/>\npredilections of the author and to some extent the prevailing beliefs of the <br/>\ntime period in which they were written.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of this is that the kakun from the early Medieval period often <br/>\nstressed the importance of samurai improving their ability in letters <br/>\n(writing, music, poetry, etc.)  This was likely due to the fact that the <br/>\nwarriors (mostly from the Eastern part of Japan) were coming into increasing <br/>\ncontact with the people of high breeding from Kyoto and found their <br/>\nabilities in this area lacking. As the courtiers had had a monopoly on <br/>\ngovernmental positions until the Kamakura period, their tastes and <br/>\nrefinements were, to a certain extent synonymous with governmental <br/>\nauthority.  The case is drastically different as regards kakun from the <br/>\nGekokujo period (1467 onward), at least as far as those written by samurai <br/>\nthat held court rank.  These men were highly literate and as such were not <br/>\nconcerned with whether their kids could read or write.  These house codes <br/>\nare much more pragmatic in tone and generally deal with issues of immediate <br/>\nconcern to the preservation of the &quot;clan&quot; and its territories .<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess, my points for this rant are as follows.  1) There were certainly <br/>\nprecursors to the ideals set forth in Hagakure, those from the period <br/>\nimmediately preceeding it being the closest in both form and tone.  2) There <br/>\nwas some sense of a warrior identity as far back as the Kamakura period, but <br/>\nits specific articulation varied by person, geography and time period.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn closing please allow me to aopologize for the incomplete reference, but I <br/>\nam currently at &quot;work&quot; and dont have access to my files.  I will look into <br/>\nthe Yamaga Soko thing and will try to send more complete info in a day or <br/>\ntwo.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Might be a good idea to check out the kakun translated in _Ideals of <br/>\nthe Samurai_ by William Scott Wilson<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:golfmandan@...\">golfmandan@...</a><br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] New Member Arrival<br/>\nDate: Sun, 07 Dec 2003 19:03:47 +0000<br/>\nMIME-Version: 1.0<br/>\nX-Sender: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:golfmandan@...\">golfmandan@...</a><br/>\nReceived: from n36.grp.scd.yahoo.com ([66.218.66.104]) by <br/>\nmc9-f15.hotmail.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC(5.0.2195.6713); Sun, 7 Dec 2003 <br/>\n11:56:39 -0800<br/>\nReceived: from [66.218.66.97] by n36.grp.scd.yahoo.com with NNFMP; 07 Dec <br/>\n2003 19:56:22 -0000<br/>\nReceived: (qmail 31749 invoked from network); 7 Dec 2003 19:56:17 -0000<br/>\nReceived: from unknown (66.218.66.167)  by m14.grp.scd.yahoo.com with QMQP; <br/>\n7 Dec 2003 19:56:17 -0000<br/>\nReceived: from unknown (HELO n7.grp.scd.yahoo.com) (66.218.66.91)  by <br/>\nmta6.grp.scd.yahoo.com with SMTP; 7 Dec 2003 19:56:16 -0000<br/>\nReceived: from [66.218.67.253] by n7.grp.scd.yahoo.com with NNFMP; 07 Dec <br/>\n2003 19:56:16 -0000<br/>\nReceived: (qmail 18459 invoked from network); 7 Dec 2003 19:03:48 -0000<br/>\nReceived: from unknown (66.218.66.167)  by m18.grp.scd.yahoo.com with QMQP; <br/>\n7 Dec 2003 19:03:48 -0000<br/>\nReceived: from unknown (HELO mtiwmhc12.worldnet.att.net) (204.127.131.116)  <br/>\nby mta6.grp.scd.yahoo.com with SMTP; 7 Dec 2003 19:03:48 -0000<br/>\nReceived: from 204.127.135.43 ([204.127.135.43])          by <br/>\nworldnet.att.net (mtiwmhc12) with SMTP          id <br/>\n&lt;2003120719034711200isv5ue&gt;; Sun, 7 Dec 2003 19:03:47 +0000<br/>\nReceived: from [67.248.208.87] by 204.127.135.43;Sun, 07 Dec 2003 19:03:47 <br/>\n+0000<br/>\nX-Message-Info: JGTYoYF78jHCPzkI8jVDS+k852q45yDk<br/>\nX-eGroups-Return: <br/>\nsentto-2247946-2689-1070826979-rntihg=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hotmail.com@...\">hotmail.com@...</a><br/>\nX-eGroups-Return: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:golfmandan@...\">golfmandan@...</a><br/>\nX-Apparently-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nMessage-Id: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:120720031903.13979.3501@...\">120720031903.13979.3501@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nX-Mailer: AT&T Message Center Version 1 (Oct 10 2003)<br/>\nX-Authenticated-Sender: Z29sZm1hbmRhbkBhdHQubmV0<br/>\nX-eGroups-Remote-IP: 204.127.131.116<br/>\nX-Yahoo-Profile: twheels2many<br/>\nX-eGroups-Approved-By: kitsuno &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samurai-listowner@...\">samurai-listowner@...</a>&gt; via <br/>\nweb; 07 Dec 2003 19:56:15 -0000<br/>\nX-eGroups-Remote-IP: 66.218.66.91<br/>\nMailing-List: list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>; contact <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-owner@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-owner@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDelivered-To: mailing list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nPrecedence: bulk<br/>\nList-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nReturn-Path: <br/>\nsentto-2247946-2689-1070826979-rntihg=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hotmail.com@...\">hotmail.com@...</a><br/>\nX-OriginalArrivalTime: 07 Dec 2003 19:56:39.0365 (UTC) <br/>\nFILETIME=[3A5FE750:01C3BCFC]<br/>\n<br/>\nHey Angry Lllama<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is true what you said about the hagakure being a rather late <br/>\ndevelopment (1716), but I<br/>\nfigure Yamamoto Tsunetomo was &quot;standing on the shoulders&quot; of those who went <br/>\nbefore him.<br/>\nTo say that there was no bushido before 1716... is it really fair to claim <br/>\nthat? Just because it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t written down? Sure, it may have varied from region to region and era <br/>\nto era, but the<br/>\nsamurai as a caste surely had a set of expectations or ethics - whether <br/>\nself-imposed or<br/>\nimposed by others. If I&#39;m way off base, let me know. Related to this, I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to know: is there<br/>\nany evidence for &quot;bushido&quot; prior to the Hagakure? What are the other main <br/>\npieces of samurai<br/>\nliterature?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWonder if the latest virus has gotten to your computer?
