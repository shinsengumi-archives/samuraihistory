A modern analogy would be<br/>\nthe old, crusty Colonel who refuses to give up his .45<br/>\ncaliber pistol, despite the fact that the Army has<br/>\nused the 9mm Beretta M9 for decades now. (this is a<br/>\ntrue story, by the way--I know the guy, and he caused<br/>\nhis officer in charge of ordering ammunition all kinds<br/>\nof heartache trying to find .45 rounds for the darn<br/>\nthing.) While unusual, there&#39;s nothing that would<br/>\nactually prevent someone from carrying a tetsubo in<br/>\n1583, to use Tom&#39;s example of Shizugatake. The guy<br/>\nwould probably have thought he was being a badass.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1632742163\">Hi. I have been discussing the actual existence/use of tetsubo with <br/>\nsome fellow RPG players.<br/>\n<br/>\nTetsubo (&quot;iron staff&quot;?) are those big and heavy iron studded staves <br/>\noften seen in old samurai prints. They seem to have been popular <br/>\nduring the Gempei war and/or Kamakura period. I have also read that <br/>\nthey were used as a kind of psychological weapon, to intimidate the <br/>\nenemies with a &quot;big fu*king club&quot;. (I seem to remember that nodachi <br/>\nblades were also used for a similar purpose, in later eras).<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to another source found on the internet, the tetsubo was <br/>\nalso - and foremost - employed from horseback (which surprised me, <br/>\nbecause I would have thought that a such a weapon would be too <br/>\ncumbersome to be used effectively from the saddle), so the wielder <br/>\ncould add the mount&#39;s momentum to his swing, for a truly devastating <br/>\nblow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still wonder to what extent the tetsubos were actually used on the <br/>\nbattlefield.<br/>\nWere they a common sight on the battlefield or were they limited <br/>\nto earlier historic periods and/or specific tactical purposes? <br/>\nWere there a specific martial style associated with the tetsubo, such <br/>\nas to allow something like basic parries, counterattacks or &quot;called <br/>\nshots&quot;, or their use was simple and straightforward (a- lift weapon; <br/>\nb- lower weapon on enemy&#39;s head; 3- repeat from 1.)? They don&#39;t look <br/>\nlike they could be used like a naginata, a bo staff or anything like <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny info on the subject is appreciated.<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nC E Z</div>",
