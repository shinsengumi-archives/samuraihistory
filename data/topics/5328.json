            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1726216997\">Hi Folks,<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say that I really enjoyed my download this morning, nice thread,<br/>\nnicely discussed, not to mention illuminating, and it&#39;s left me with a<br/>\nquestion to which I hope you folks can provide an answer:<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine a hypothetical Daimyo, &quot;Lord X&quot;, who needs to organise his army.<br/>\nWhat roles does he need to create and what are their titles? Can anyone<br/>\neither point me to a site, or provide me with a list of the various jobs<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what do these various titles literally mean, for example, the word<br/>\ntaichou, was translated in to &quot;group-chief&quot;, assuming the kanji is the<br/>\nsame, does this mean that taisho means something like &quot;group-something<br/>\nelse&quot; and if so what?<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, it appeared that kashira and taichou were different words for<br/>\nthe same job. Is this simply a function of the era/region/fashion/taste<br/>\nof the army using the title, or was there another subtlety at play?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay to summarise then, as I understand it ALL sengoku armies (more or<br/>\nless):<br/>\n<br/>\n1) have the same range of required &quot;appointments&quot; within its structure,<br/>\nregardless of it&#39;s relative size when compared to another lord&#39;s army.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) thus there is no difference what so ever, to the titles used within<br/>\nthat army, as they merely describe the various tasks being undertaken by<br/>\nthe &quot;appointees&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) any prestige accrues to these appointees from either:<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) the comparative social standing of one army when compared to<br/>\nanother, or<br/>\n<br/>\n(b) as a function of the perceived quality/value of some but not all<br/>\nappointments within their own army, for example the kudos of being<br/>\nappointed as a messenger within the Takeda forces.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sorts of jobs that occurred to me included:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) army overall &quot;manager&quot;, if not the lord himself.<br/>\n2) sub-contingent managers, probably defined by inter-personal<br/>\nrelationship with the lord.<br/>\n3) large sub-unit manager&#39;s, probably defined by function, i.e. units of<br/>\ncavalry or infantry (bushi or ashigaru)<br/>\n4) smaller sub-unit managers, either as part of a larger one or<br/>\nfulfilling a specialist role, messengers, artillery or HQ guards etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from the main function divisions of cavalry, spearman, gunners and<br/>\narchers, the task type roles would include:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) support personnel such as porters, pack horse and cart handlers,<br/>\ndoctors/vets, pages/servants, cooks and other artisans/craftsmen. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) specialists: such as artillery crews, siege engineers and sailors.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) communications roles such as messengers, flag bearers (various<br/>\nbanners/standards), drummers, conch players etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlus sandal bearers, kitchen sink bearers... You get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I think that&#39;s enough of that, cheer&#39;s for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\">http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk</a></div>",

The answer is<br/>\nNO. <br/>\n<br/>\n Would you agree to the phrase,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for instance, that <br/>\n&gt; a taisho outranks an ashigaru?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but I wouldn&#39;t say that &quot;taisho&quot; is a higher RANK<br/>\nthan &quot;ashigaru&quot;. Again, the difference between &quot;rank&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;ranking&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do. But then again, I think that your personal<br/>\n&gt; experience and your <br/>\n&gt; technical expertise is coloring too much the way you<br/>\n&gt; are using the <br/>\n&gt; word rank.

There&#39;s no<br/>\nother way to answer his/her question--the answer is<br/>\nno. While there was obviously gradation in the<br/>\nimportance of jobs, etc., there were no military<br/>\nranks. Pure and simple. You can&#39;t even use<br/>\ntranslations of the words the Japanese used, because<br/>\nas has been said, General (Taisho) A may command 300<br/>\ntroops, whereas General B commands 30,000. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Absolutely agreed - believe me. However, the round<br/>\n&gt; modern military <br/>\n&gt; hole is not the one and only way to understand the<br/>\n&gt; word &quot;rank&quot;, <br/>\n&gt; either.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the context of the question, yes it is. If we were<br/>\ntalking social rank, or &quot;importance&quot;, then yes, that<br/>\nchanges things. But the poster asked if there were<br/>\nmilitary ranks ala the modern system. The answer is<br/>\nno. While a taisho may &quot;outrank&quot; an ashigaru, that<br/>\nmakes neither &quot;taisho&quot; or &quot;ashigaru&quot; a rank. If you&#39;re<br/>\nan assembly line worker, someone in corporate<br/>\nmanagement obviously &quot;outranks&quot; you in the context of<br/>\nyour company. However, your &quot;rank&quot; isn&#39;t Factory<br/>\nWorker, and his isn&#39;t &quot;Middle Manager&quot;. Those are<br/>\njobs--one is &quot;higher&quot; than the other, but they aren&#39;t<br/>\nranks. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n_______________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!

I think that it <br/>\nmight be a factor of the &quot;equality&quot; of a republican form of government that <br/>\ncreated that modern army, as it was certainly not a typical feudal structure <br/>\nlike that which pervaded Europe from the Normans on, until GA&#39;s &quot;new model army&quot; <br/>\n-- and even then it was looser than we think of ranks today.

But beyond this,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of course an <br/>\n&gt;&gt; ashigaru is lower than a taisho.

It&#39;s a job. You<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t make &quot;Taisho 3rd Class&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere I think is where it looks like we&#39;re just using different <br/>\nterminology. Which is what I was trying to get at by saying &quot;rank <br/>\nand promotion&quot;. We can probably agree more violently if we change <br/>\nthe terms slightly. Would you agree to the phrase, for instance, that <br/>\na taisho outranks an ashigaru?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Then of course to confuse matters more we have that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ashigaru <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Taisho.....<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Who leads a larger group of ashigaru than a<br/>\n&gt;ashigaru-kashira, but is still performing a JOB. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This specific example seems in my way of thinking to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; blur the lines a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; bit. It seems to me that once &#39;promoted&#39; to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ashigaru-gashira a person <br/>\n&gt;&gt; would not go back to being a plain ashigaru. In<br/>\n&gt;&gt; other words this one <br/>\n&gt;&gt; seems more like a permanent promotion rather than<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; battle-by-battle job assignment. What do you think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A company commander is higher than a platoon leader,<br/>\n&gt;and once you&#39;re a company commander you&#39;re not going<br/>\n&gt;to ever go back to being a platoon leader. However,<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;re both still JOBS....descriptions of<br/>\n&gt;function...not RANKS. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;handle the command of a Brigade, etc. HOWEVER, they<br/>\n&gt;are not equal. I&#39;m a captain, but have not had command<br/>\n&gt;yet--I&#39;m filling a staff position. I filled a staff<br/>\n&gt;position at my last assignment also. So while my rank<br/>\n&gt;has not changed, nor will it in the next few years, my<br/>\n&gt;POSITION has, and will. I will take company command in<br/>\n&gt;a year or so--but that doesn&#39;t change my RANK. See the<br/>\n&gt;difference? <br/>\n<br/>\nI do. But then again, I think that your personal experience and your <br/>\ntechnical expertise is coloring too much the way you are using the <br/>\nword rank. But then again again, I don&#39;t know how the original <br/>\nposter really meant the question either - so I might be the only one <br/>\nhere who sees this my way (wouldn&#39;t be the first time....)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;There WAS no rank system in a sengoku army. Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;confuse ranks with &quot;ranking&quot;. Obviously some people<br/>\n&gt;were more important than others, and some jobs were<br/>\n&gt;more prestigious, etc. But you didn&#39;t start as<br/>\n&gt;Ashigaru 2nd Class, work up to Ashigaru 1st Class,<br/>\n&gt;then Gunsou, then 2nd Samurai, then 1st Samurai, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, exactly. Which is (again) what I meant by the &quot;rank and <br/>\npromotion&quot; comment - which I guess didn&#39;t really express what I <br/>\nwanted it to.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;You simply can&#39;t fit the square Sengoku army peg into<br/>\n&gt;the round modern military hole. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely agreed - believe me. However, the round modern military <br/>\nhole is not the one and only way to understand the word &quot;rank&quot;, <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>",

It&#39;s a job. You<br/>\ndon&#39;t make &quot;Taisho 3rd Class&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then of course to confuse matters more we have that<br/>\n&gt; Ashigaru <br/>\n&gt; Taisho.....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who leads a larger group of ashigaru than a<br/>\nashigaru-kashira, but is still performing a JOB. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This specific example seems in my way of thinking to<br/>\n&gt; blur the lines a <br/>\n&gt; bit. It seems to me that once &#39;promoted&#39; to<br/>\n&gt; ashigaru-gashira a person <br/>\n&gt; would not go back to being a plain ashigaru. In<br/>\n&gt; other words this one <br/>\n&gt; seems more like a permanent promotion rather than<br/>\n&gt; just a <br/>\n&gt; battle-by-battle job assignment. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A company commander is higher than a platoon leader,<br/>\nand once you&#39;re a company commander you&#39;re not going<br/>\nto ever go back to being a platoon leader. However,<br/>\nthey&#39;re both still JOBS....descriptions of<br/>\nfunction...not RANKS. <br/>\n<br/>\nPut it this way: in the modern military, ranks<br/>\ngenerally coincide with certain job positions. A squad<br/>\nleader is usually a Staff Sergeant, a platoon sergeant<br/>\nusually a Sergeant First Class. A platoon leader is<br/>\nusually a lieutenant (normally 2nd LT), a company XO<br/>\nis a 1st LT, a company commander is a Captain, majors<br/>\nhold the main battalion staff positions, such as XO, a<br/>\nbattalion commander is a lieutanant colonel, a brigade<br/>\ncommander is a colonel, etc. Why is it this way?<br/>\nBecause the US Army says that those are the ranks that<br/>\ngo with those positions--someone with the experience<br/>\nand skill to get promoted to COL should be able to<br/>\nhandle the command of a Brigade, etc. HOWEVER, they<br/>\nare not equal. I&#39;m a captain, but have not had command<br/>\nyet--I&#39;m filling a staff position. I filled a staff<br/>\nposition at my last assignment also. So while my rank<br/>\nhas not changed, nor will it in the next few years, my<br/>\nPOSITION has, and will. I will take company command in<br/>\na year or so--but that doesn&#39;t change my RANK. See the<br/>\ndifference? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere WAS no rank system in a sengoku army. Don&#39;t<br/>\nconfuse ranks with &quot;ranking&quot;. Obviously some people<br/>\nwere more important than others, and some jobs were<br/>\nmore prestigious, etc. But you didn&#39;t start as<br/>\nAshigaru 2nd Class, work up to Ashigaru 1st Class,<br/>\nthen Gunsou, then 2nd Samurai, then 1st Samurai, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou simply can&#39;t fit the square Sengoku army peg into<br/>\nthe round modern military hole. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven today, at work I take advantage of the difference<br/>\nbetween rank and job title. Our office liaisons with<br/>\nJapanese 3 and 4 star level officers (generals,<br/>\nadmirals, etc) regularly. I&#39;m a nobody as a simple<br/>\ncaptain. But I use my job title, not my rank--Deputy<br/>\nOperations Officer sounds much better to them then<br/>\nusing my rank, which is the lower than the guy who<br/>\ngets their coffee in the morning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

There&#39;s a difference, and it&#39;s a fairly<br/>\ncritical one. Ranks tend to have a consistency. A lieutenant always has X-number<br/>\nof people under him, a major X-number of people, a general X-number and so on. A<br/>\ntaisho can have 50, 500, or 5,000.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most basic &quot;rank&quot; -- that of kashira or taicho^, doesn&#39;t even have a number.<br/>\nA taicho^ (lit. &quot;group-chief&quot;) can have five people or 50 under him, depending on<br/>\nthe job and the specific assignment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On top of that there were of course the ranks in terms of the <br/>\n&gt; Shoku-i 職位 system.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but the Ritsuryo^ Code has nothing to do with this. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is very well said! In fact (as you and I have exchanged on this <br/>\n&gt; list before), even the title Shogun is not in essence a &quot;rank&quot;. It <br/>\n&gt; is really a job description. IN fact the title &quot;Shogun&quot; is not even <br/>\n&gt; part of the Shoku-i ranking system.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, IIRC, it&#39;s a fifth-court-rank position.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It refers to someone who leads a large body of troops.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;That could be 10,000 troops, or 300. Obviously if you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;lead 10,000 you are probably more important, and of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;higher &quot;rank&quot; than the guy with only 300, but you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;&gt;still both &quot;Taisho&quot;. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Ah - here&#39;s what I was getting at. But beyond this, of course an <br/>\n&gt; ashigaru is lower than a taisho. So at some level wouldn&#39;t you be <br/>\n&gt; able to call this a &#39;rank&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, again, due to the big difference between the concept of &quot;rank&quot; and &quot;job&quot;.<br/>\nYou could call ashigaru a *class* of samurai, perhaps, but it&#39;s not a rank per<br/>\nse. Ashigaru had different functions. Some might be section or squad leaders<br/>\n(taicho^ or kashira) or what have you; sometimes &quot;full-fledged samurai&quot; might<br/>\nhold those positions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, it is VERY important to divorce the concept of terminology of<br/>\nMILITARY rank from samurai -- they just don&#39;t operate on the same level. There<br/>\nis rank, yes, but that&#39;s SOCIAL rank, not military rank.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then of course to confuse matters more we have that Ashigaru <br/>\n&gt; Taisho.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;Similiarly, you&#39;ll see things like &quot;Ashigaru-gashira&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;etc., but again, these are job titles, not ranks. A<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;Kashira&quot; is the head of a particular unit, so the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;ashigaru-kashira would be the leader of a small unit<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of ashigaru, kind of like a platoon leader in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;modern army. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This specific example seems in my way of thinking to blur the lines a <br/>\n&gt; bit. It seems to me that once &#39;promoted&#39; to ashigaru-gashira a person <br/>\n&gt; would not go back to being a plain ashigaru. In other words this one <br/>\n&gt; seems more like a permanent promotion rather than just a <br/>\n&gt; battle-by-battle job assignment. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s no rule. In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and duties are<br/>\nheld at the pleasure of the overlord in question. There is no way to say &quot;I&#39;m a<br/>\nfirst sergeant, you can&#39;t make me a private without due cause and a<br/>\ncourt-martial.&quot; Even &quot;permanent&quot; appointments (such as that of a taicho^) in a<br/>\nJapanese army were understood to be continued appointments that could be<br/>\nwithdrawn at any time (or magnified with further postings) and not one&#39;s &quot;right&quot;<br/>\nto the position.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony J.
