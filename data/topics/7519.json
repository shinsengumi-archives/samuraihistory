It is a collection of letters, history <br/>\nwritten by the victors, history written 100 years after the fact, <br/>\nand conjecture.  I read an article about a year ago that talked <br/>\nabout a family who had family documents for a prominent Samurai <br/>\nfamily of the Sengoku who finally released it to scholars about 9 <br/>\nyears ago, and it turned out that a lot of what was thought to be <br/>\ncorrect history of that clan was actually incorrect. Also, there <br/>\nwere tons of documents destroyed by US bombing raids of temples that <br/>\nwere never examined, and even today there are decendants of samurai <br/>\nfamilies who have historical documents who refuse to release them to <br/>\nscholars because it is thier own &quot;family matters&quot;.  So there were <br/>\npotentially a lot of historical revelations destroyed during WWII, <br/>\nand historical documents that exist but are inaccessible to <br/>\nscholars.  When you think about it, some of what happened in the <br/>\nSengoku is both so epic and fortuituous, the only real explanation <br/>\nhas to be that there was more to the event(s) than what the <br/>\ndocuments currently tell us.  Too many people died of &quot;illness&quot; at <br/>\nperfect times for opportunists, and too many miraculous turnings of <br/>\nthe tides of war happened for me to believe that we have the &#39;whole&#39; <br/>\nstory.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-134304287\">For me, all elements are fascinating and worthy of study.  I guess  the trick is never to see any particular version as being &quot;gospel&quot;, because  although facts are incontrovertible, the ability to discern facts from slightly altered facts, from fiction, from propaganda (and disinformation) is way out of my field of expertise!  Looking at the story of just one of the 47 ronin, for example, compared to huge story of the Tokugawa shogunate, how could I insist that one episode is more important than another, or more interesting, or offers the world more in either sociological education or simple entertainment?  Personally, I love all of it, although some eras fascinate me more than others. I think it&#39;s important to see chambara films for what they are: magnificent pieces of entertainment about fascinating periods in history, tempered by the personal opinions and experiences of the writers and directors.  If we do that, though, shouldn&#39;t we also do the same for a great deal of accepted history which may have been written by one or other side&#39;s faction?  Is it so important to &quot;know&quot; something for an absolute certainty, or is it better to FEEl somthing for a pretty close bet?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to know your opinion on this!<br/>\n Do we study<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; history as grand themes and tendencies?

So in order to make a film<br/>\nabout such a theme, one must set up a particular individual with a<br/>\nparticular personality. With particular strengths and weaknesses of<br/>\ncharacter. <br/>\n <br/>\nEven for someone who couldn&#39;t care less about Japanese (or American or<br/>\nEuropean or wherever) politics, either in ancient or modern times -- still<br/>\nSEPPUKU is a chilling and compelling portrait of individuals and how they<br/>\ndeal with the fate meted out to them. <br/>\n <br/>\nNow to reference actual history to this comment -- because this is a history<br/>\nlist and not a list about fictional literature or cinema.

It&#39;s an interesting<br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n <br/>\nPart of what made Miyamoto Musashi a samurai was his birth, his bloodlines.<br/>\nHe was born into a samurai family, though accounts of his early life are<br/>\nvague. From what I can gather from reading these accounts, it seems likely<br/>\nto me that he was born the son of a ronin who lived in a farming village.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut also, I believe that he was born before Hideyoshi&#39;s &quot;sword hunt&quot; and<br/>\nthus the distinction between samurai and farmers wasn&#39;t as clear-cut as<br/>\nafter that time. The &quot;sword hunt&quot; did occur during Musashi&#39;s lifetime, I<br/>\nbelieve, and he came out on the &quot;samurai&quot; end of that as far as I know. He<br/>\nfought in the battle of Sekigahara on the losing side, so he definitely was<br/>\nthe 17th century equivilent of a &quot;combat-veteran.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nFor most of Musashi&#39;s life, he was a ronin. He spent a bit of time in<br/>\nservice to (I believe it was) one of the Hosokawa daimyos and I believe that<br/>\nhe was involved in the summer siege of Osaka Castle. As far as I know, he<br/>\nwas always friendly to the Hosokawa Clan. But he wanted to study on his own,<br/>\nnot attached to a clan. As for how he made his living, this is vague, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve read that he sometimes taught fencing in itinerent fencing schools or<br/>\nmakeshift classes that he set up while on his travels. He never made more<br/>\nthan enough for him to live on; he was one of those stereotypical rough,<br/>\nragged ronin who was quite scary to many folk. He never married but did<br/>\nadopt two sons.<br/>\n <br/>\nNear the end of his life, he entered Lord Hosokawa&#39;s service and got<br/>\ninvolved in advising him during the Shimabara battle. AFter that, he<br/>\nretreated into a cave and wrote &quot;Book of Five Rings.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nNina Boal<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Sensei J.

No. Perhaps I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t convey what I wanted to with the &quot;Shogun&quot;<br/>\nreference--in the book. Gyoko, the Mama-san, tries to<br/>\nbargain with Toranaga to get her son &quot;named&quot; a<br/>\nsamurai.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-933462370\">Nina, it&#39;s clear that you know this film very well.  I also love this<br/>\nfilm, and although it moved me deeply, I found myself questioning the<br/>\ninitial, strong reaction that it induced.<br/>\nIt seems that no matter how much research one conducts in order to get<br/>\nto the &quot;truth&quot; of a matter, it&#39;s impossible to ever really know what<br/>\nhappened.  Each party will always have his or her own axe to grind and<br/>\nwill slant the information in a way to suit them.  It&#39;s also the case<br/>\nthat how we ourselves approach and view an event can often say more<br/>\nabout us and our backgrounds than the event itself.  So, in Seppuku we<br/>\nhave an event that is utterly abhorrent to us, as modern people.  Yet<br/>\ntaken in its own context it&#39;s almost impossible to see what else the<br/>\nIi clan could have done.  If they were to become caring,<br/>\ncompassionate, warm-hearted and empathetic, would they not more<br/>\nclosely resemble Mother Theresa than the very thing that fascinates us<br/>\nso?  From a historical point of view, it&#39;s ludicrous to expect it;from<br/>\nour own point of view, knowing the history of Japan in general and<br/>\nsamurai in particular, how could we possibly condemn the Ii clan out<br/>\nof hand?    By the time the film was made there were no samurai, yet<br/>\nit almost feels like the film-maker was making a propaganda movie<br/>\nagainst the feudal era and its practices.  Perhaps it was a metaphor<br/>\nfor post-war Japan and the horrors of rebuilding the country.  I&#39;m<br/>\nguessing, but it makes more sense than trying to rewrite history,<br/>\nbecause if you condemn the Ii clan, you have to condemn every other<br/>\nclan.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal view is that many of us who love samurai but are disturbed<br/>\nby the tale of Seppuku are trying too hard to Disney-fy the samurai. <br/>\nWe like our good guys and bad guys to be easily identified, so when<br/>\nthe film maker leads us gently but very, very firmly by the hand to<br/>\nreach the conclusion that he clearly wants us to make, we allow<br/>\nourselves to be led.  We condemn the Ii clan, not only because they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t care to ask Motome about his chosen course of action, but<br/>\nbecause even when they found out his tragic story, they still didn&#39;t<br/>\ncare.  How heartless are they?  But then, how much heart can you<br/>\nafford to have when the country has an epidemic of ronin and the<br/>\nbakufu has no clear plan for them?  Presumably the Tokugawa desired<br/>\nnothing more than that these ronin would take the honorable way out<br/>\nand commit seppuku, without fuss.  This, to me, is far more cruel than<br/>\nthe little drama played out by both victims of the shogunate&#39;s lack of<br/>\nhumanity: the Ii Clan and Motome.  The Ii clan were forced into taking<br/>\nactions it did not seek to take, and to deal with a country-wide<br/>\nproblem without guidance or funds to do so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeppuku is a superb film, even taken at face value.  However, when you<br/>\nquestion it, analyse it and explore it - and your own reactions to it<br/>\n- it becomes an absolute masterpiece for forcing you to keep your<br/>\nknees from jerking where they were supposed to jerk.  By trying to<br/>\nturn this film in a heroes and villains tearjerker the viewer can lose<br/>\nthe chance to delve a little deeper and get much more out of it.</div>",

Not<br/>\n&gt; really--not that way. A rich farmer could possibly<br/>\n&gt; have been adopted into an impoverished samurai<br/>\n&gt; family<br/>\n&gt; and thereby &quot;made&quot; samurai, but I couldn&#39;t tell you<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve ever come across that. It sounds too dramatic<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; me. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Happened? Yes--documentably so. Common? No. Perhaps I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t convey what I wanted to with the &quot;Shogun&quot;<br/>\nreference--in the book. Gyoko, the Mama-san, tries to<br/>\nbargain with Toranaga to get her son &quot;named&quot; a<br/>\nsamurai.

Especially from the Onin on, anyone with the<br/>\nright breaks and a set of iron...fists...could become<br/>\na samurai. Saito Dosan either was, or was the son of,<br/>\nan oil seller, depending on which author you read. Ise<br/>\nShinkuro (later Hojo Soun) rises up practically from<br/>\nout of nowhere. Most of Hideyoshi&#39;s close retainers<br/>\n(Kato Kiyomasa, for example) came from the same Owari<br/>\npeasant villages he did--in fact, it&#39;s celebrated in<br/>\nNagoya&#39;s Nakamura-ku, which used to be the village of<br/>\nNakamura, where Hideyoshi and Kiyomasa both were born.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCould status be bought, like in Shogun? Not<br/>\nreally--not that way. A rich farmer could possibly<br/>\nhave been adopted into an impoverished samurai family<br/>\nand thereby &quot;made&quot; samurai, but I couldn&#39;t tell you if<br/>\nI&#39;ve ever come across that. It sounds too dramatic to<br/>\nme. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!

During the vast bulk of the Sengoku,<br/>\nAshigaru  weren&#39;t considered &quot;samurai&quot;--they were<br/>\noriginally farmer-footsoldiers recruited from the<br/>\nprovinces to serve during campaigns, and then went<br/>\nback to the fields when the battle was over. Only with<br/>\nthe professionalization of armies did they become the<br/>\nlower ranks of the samurai class. Many ashigaru could<br/>\nand did rise within the samurai structure--notably,<br/>\nHideyoshi. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s not even mentioning the &quot;jizamurai&quot;, the<br/>\nlanded gentry who farmed and warred, and were both<br/>\nsamurai and farmers (generally wealthy landowners). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with your statement is it&#39;s very much a<br/>\nproduct of the tail end of the Sengoku and the Edo<br/>\nperiod. Especially from the Onin on, anyone with the<br/>\nright breaks and a set of iron...fists...could become<br/>\na samurai. Saito Dosan either was, or was the son of,<br/>\nan oil seller, depending on which author you read. Ise<br/>\nShinkuro (later Hojo Soun) rises up practically from<br/>\nout of nowhere. Most of Hideyoshi&#39;s close retainers<br/>\n(Kato Kiyomasa, for example) came from the same Owari<br/>\npeasant villages he did--in fact, it&#39;s celebrated in<br/>\nNagoya&#39;s Nakamura-ku, which used to be the village of<br/>\nNakamura, where Hideyoshi and Kiyomasa both were born.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCould status be bought, like in Shogun? Not<br/>\nreally--not that way. A rich farmer could possibly<br/>\nhave been adopted into an impoverished samurai family<br/>\nand thereby &quot;made&quot; samurai, but I couldn&#39;t tell you if<br/>\nI&#39;ve ever come across that. It sounds too dramatic to<br/>\nme. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-785440131\">At the risk of putting my foot in my mouth:<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for research, each person has to judge what is or what isn&#39;t accurate.<br/>\nSometimes we simply don&#39;t know. History books can be rife with inaccuracies,<br/>\nno matter how many years the author may have studied in Japan or even if the<br/>\nauthor is a native Japanese. Believe me, as an American, I&#39;ve read plenty of<br/>\nbooks on American history. If simply having the author being an American<br/>\nwere automatic proof of accuracy in historical research: I think that most<br/>\nof the American people on this list know that there are scores of inaccurate<br/>\nbooks written about the U.S. by native-born Americans. So the same with<br/>\nJapanese history works or the works about the history of any country or<br/>\nculture. <br/>\n <br/>\nIndividual movies, comics, etc. taken at face value would seem to be tenuous<br/>\nsources of history. But sometimes a pattern can emerge from popular works<br/>\nthat can indicate some truths, or which at least, we can draw or speculate<br/>\non conclusions. So I don&#39;t think that movies, comics, etc. can be entirely<br/>\ndiscounted either. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m a writer who is engaged in writing historical fiction that takes place<br/>\nin Japan. I&#39;m NOT a historian and would never claim to be so. I do depend on<br/>\nvarious sources to research the background for my writings. I am unable to<br/>\nread Japanese so I&#39;m limited to translated works for my research. I find<br/>\nthat I have to consult several sources and then use my logic to decide upon<br/>\nthe reasonable accuracy of any of them. And also realize that my own works<br/>\nare works of fiction, not definite statements on what actually has happened<br/>\nin history. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn my short story &quot;Stray Dogs, &quot; I certainly cannot claim that this is a<br/>\nproven, complete historical rendition of events in Fuwa Kazuemon&#39;s life.<br/>\nThat is because we simply don&#39;t know a whole lot about his life. He was a<br/>\nronin for the last 5-6 years of his life and there really weren&#39;t a whole<br/>\nlot of historical records kept on the lives of ronin; most people of the<br/>\ntime considered them to be inconsequential. So in order to produce a<br/>\nsatisfactory work of fiction, I have to do my research on what is available<br/>\nabout his life. But then, I have to use my logic in researching the general<br/>\nliving conditions for ronin of that era, and put in my speculations as to<br/>\nhow Fuwa Kazuemon&#39;s life might have occurred within that context. <br/>\n <br/>\nTo try and sum up, in studying history, one must consult many sources. And<br/>\nthen use logic to decide the weight to be put on each source that is<br/>\nconsulted.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know if any of this makes sense or is just ramblings.   <br/>\n <br/>\nNina Boal <br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 31, 2005 10:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Our &quot;welcoming&quot; attitude<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seikei7248@...\">seikei7248@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n <br/>\n[snips]<br/>\n <br/>\nAdditionally, &quot;I read in a comic<br/>\nbook&quot;, &quot;my sensei told me so&quot;, and &quot;I saw in a<br/>\nmovie/anime/tv show&quot; aren&#39;t considered accurate<br/>\nhistorical references, and anyone who uses these as<br/>\ndocumentation for supposed facts deserves whatever<br/>\nrebuttal with historical sources they get.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1034745938\">There are a zillion 47 Ronin films, many of them sub-titled in English. The<br/>\nmost familiar to English-speaking audiences is CHUSHINGURA, directed by<br/>\nInagaki. There are several others available on DVD from the &quot;fan-subbers&quot;<br/>\nwho have managed to get prints and been able to sub-title them. Being very<br/>\ninterested in the 47 Ronin event, I&#39;ve collected quite a few of these.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe problem with most of the 47 Ronin films is the mythology in them. In<br/>\nmost of these films, the local Edo samurai and townspeople are shown to be<br/>\nquite knowledgeable of the revenge and its planning, almost as if they have<br/>\nformed &quot;Ako Ronin Fan Clubs&quot; to cheer them on. It seems, according to the<br/>\nfilms, that everyone and his brother and sister throughout Japan just KNOW<br/>\nexactly what the Ako ronin are planning. The problem with these sorts of<br/>\ndepictions is that, if all these folks in Edo knew exactly what was going<br/>\non, wouldn&#39;t Kira and his associates also know? And thus they would have<br/>\nbeen able to easily thwart the revenge plans. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn fact, the planning and execution of the Ako ronin&#39;s revenge was carried<br/>\non in great secrecy. It was the only way that a sorely out-numbered handful<br/>\nof ex-Ako retainers could achieve what they wanted to achieve. So they<br/>\ndeliberately set out on a course of action to make it appear that the LAST<br/>\nthing on their minds would be a revenge. Oishi Kuranosuke was known to have<br/>\nengaged in an extended pretense of dissipation, divorcing his wife and<br/>\ngetting drunk and disorderly at various Kyoto teahouses. The idea was to<br/>\nlull Kira and his allies into thinking that the Ako ronin were a bunch of<br/>\nne&#39;er do-wells who had no intention of avenging their lord. That way, they<br/>\ncould have the element of surprise on their side to successfully carry out<br/>\ntheir attack. <br/>\n <br/>\nNina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of bellaireroad<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 31, 2005 8:06 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nI have to agree on &quot;Hara Kiri&quot;  I just saw this the other night...the<br/>\nCriterion version....great storyline, acting, and fantastic ending. <br/>\nI&#39;m somewhat an armor fan, and Kagemusha was great eye candy...also<br/>\nreally liked the hidden fortress...no one seems to have mentioned it<br/>\nso far...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m kind of suprised there is not an epic film based on the 47 Ronin,<br/>\nespecially since this event is so steeped in Samurai tradition and honor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@s...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello everyone, coming out of lurk-dom.

Seriously, though--we&#39;re all trying to improve,<br/>\nand as long as we realize what we don&#39;t know, it&#39;s<br/>\neasier to find out more stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I am often facing the fact that many authors are<br/>\n&gt; saying totally <br/>\n&gt; opposite from one to another. So, as you spoke about<br/>\n&gt; Turnbull and Samson <br/>\n&gt; (I don&#39;t have any of these books), and are<br/>\n&gt; explaining why their books <br/>\n&gt; might include mistakes, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Turnbull is a touchy subject around some people, as<br/>\nsome people love him, others hate him. In his favor,<br/>\nhe&#39;s probably the most prolific author in English on<br/>\nthe subject, some of his books are excellently<br/>\ndetailed (the Samurai Sourcebook being a great book),<br/>\nand he generally doesn&#39;t put out too much<br/>\nmisinformation on purpose. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bad side, his early works were accused of<br/>\nplagiarism, many of his later books are simply<br/>\nrewrites/reshuffles of earlier books with the same<br/>\ninfo/anecdotes under different titles, and in many of<br/>\nhis Osprey works he&#39;s not very careful to check his<br/>\nfacts/spelling/editing/etc. Samurai Warfare, 1465-1600<br/>\nis the biggest waste of money I&#39;ve ever had the<br/>\nmispleasure of buying. Some of his works are obvious<br/>\nattempts at repackaging previous info, or writing<br/>\nstuff off the top of his head to simply sell another<br/>\nbook. So, while some of his stuff is great, be careful<br/>\nwith it. Read it, then verify it with other sources.<br/>\nTurnbull books I recommend: Nagashino 1575, The<br/>\nSamurai Sourcebook, any of the Samurai<br/>\nWarriors/Samurai Warlords/Lone Samurai and the Martial<br/>\nArts/etc. I&#39;d be dubious of much of his Osprey work<br/>\nunless you can verify it with something else--it just<br/>\nsmacks of mass production. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge B. Sansom compiled a fabulous History of Japan<br/>\nin 3 volumes. It&#39;s epic--and a must-read. However, he<br/>\nmakes several notable mistakes, makes statements that<br/>\nhave since been shown to be false, etc. It&#39;s<br/>\ngood--don&#39;t get me wrong. But particularly his Sengoku<br/>\nperiod (1333-1615) information gets a little too<br/>\nshallow. A must as a background read, but for<br/>\nspecifics, delve deeper. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am more interested right now about Momoyama period<br/>\n&gt; and the whole <br/>\n&gt; &quot;reign&quot; of Hideyoshi, but, unfortunately I can only<br/>\n&gt; read in French or <br/>\n&gt; English.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mary Berry&#39;s &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; is an excellent read.<br/>\n&quot;Japonius Tyrannus&quot; is about Nobunaga, but provides<br/>\nlots of good scholarly info. Sansom would help provide<br/>\ngood background, of course. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne book I&#39;d recommend, even though it&#39;s fiction, is<br/>\nYoshikawa Eiji&#39;s &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;, available in<br/>\nEnglish--not sure about French. Even though it&#39;s<br/>\nfictitious, and horribly didactic, it does lay out the<br/>\ncommonly believed episodes from Hideyoshi&#39;s early<br/>\nlife, and matches most other sources that I&#39;ve seen,<br/>\nat least in the events. The only bad part of the book<br/>\nis that it drips with hero-worship; there are only so<br/>\nmany times I can read about how brilliant Hideyoshi<br/>\nwas without gagging.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The books I got right now (please let me know if<br/>\n&gt; they include bad <br/>\n&gt; information):<br/>\n&gt; - Samurai: An Illustrated History by Mitsuo Kure;<br/>\n&gt; - å³é²æ¥æ¬ã®ç²åæ­¦å·äºå¸ (I hope i am<br/>\n&gt; pasting the right letters);<br/>\n&gt; - Samurai Invasion by Turnbull<br/>\n&gt; - Samurai Sourcebook by Turnbull<br/>\n&gt; - The Cambridge history of Japan : vol 4 : early<br/>\n&gt; modern history.<br/>\n&gt; - Another book in Japanese about Oda nobunaga&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; followers (i was <br/>\n&gt; actually looking for the sengoku jinmei jiten but I<br/>\n&gt; went through this one).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All of these, especially Cambridge, are pretty good.<br/>\nSourcebook and Samurai Invasion are two of Turnbull&#39;s<br/>\nbetter works. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know there is a &quot;recommended readings&quot; section on <br/>\n&gt; www.samurai-archives.com , but without comments it<br/>\n&gt; is pretty hard for me <br/>\n&gt; to appraise books (and authors) quality. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard until you start reading through things. Most<br/>\nof those books are excellent, but every author, no<br/>\nmatter how good, has his/her own tendencies, biases,<br/>\netc. Knowledge comes not from reading one or two<br/>\nbooks, but from reading and comparing many sources and<br/>\ntrying to find the common picture. This is why I say<br/>\nmovies and anime, etc., are not good sources and<br/>\nshould not be treated as such. If it&#39;s hard to find<br/>\nagreement in scholarly historical books, then how much<br/>\nharder is it to figure out fact from fiction in a work<br/>\nof fiction?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n____________________________________________________<br/>\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\">http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs</a></div>",

Problems occur when:<br/>\n<br/>\na. people come in with preconceived notions shaped by<br/>\npop culture and refuse to accept that pop culture is<br/>\nwrong 80% of the time, at least. We are all wrong at<br/>\nsome point in our lives, and it&#39;s better to learn to<br/>\naccept it and learn from it then defend mistaken<br/>\nideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nb. People ignore the &quot;history&quot; portion of the &quot;Samurai<br/>\nHistory&quot; groups. While martial arts are okay as a<br/>\nside-topic in relation to the Samurai, this is NOT a<br/>\nmartial-arts forum. Additionally, &quot;I read in a comic<br/>\nbook&quot;, &quot;my sensei told me so&quot;, and &quot;I saw in a<br/>\nmovie/anime/tv show&quot; aren&#39;t considered accurate<br/>\nhistorical references, and anyone who uses these as<br/>\ndocumentation for supposed facts deserves whatever<br/>\nrebuttal with historical sources they get. Many<br/>\n&quot;history&quot; books aren&#39;t correct, either. Turnbull does<br/>\na great job of getting information into English, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve got a collection of many of his books. However,<br/>\nsome I wish I hadn&#39;t wasted money on--sometimes he (or<br/>\nhis editor) gets lazy and prints counterfactual<br/>\ninformation, and he tends to publish the same<br/>\ninformation (complete with the<br/>\nsame...anecdotes...over...and...over). ALL sources<br/>\nneed to be verified, doublechecked, or corroborated.<br/>\nSansom, God love him, while a great source of overview<br/>\nknowledge, has sadly been passed up by a lot of recent<br/>\nresearch, and is downright wrong on some things.<br/>\n[/rant]<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, got off-track there. The bottom line of the<br/>\nabove is that even real historical sources aren&#39;t<br/>\nalways &quot;right&quot;, so when a question is asked here, it&#39;s<br/>\nnot always easy to give a simple answer. Honestly,<br/>\nmany people ask superficial questions--as if all<br/>\nSamurai were the same, and what applied to one samurai<br/>\napplied to another in all cases, regardless of<br/>\nstation, socio-economic status, time period, location,<br/>\netc. A lot of romanticized ideals bring people here,<br/>\nand as with any romanticized ideal, the reality is<br/>\nsort of sobering and disappointing to some.<br/>\nPersonally, I find the betrayal, self-serving<br/>\naggression, and general chaos of the Sengoku to be<br/>\nmuch more interesting than the idea that all samurai<br/>\nfollowed this neat little code called Bushido and<br/>\ncommitted seppuku if they sneezed in public. It&#39;s<br/>\nasked of every member who signs up that they read the<br/>\nTop Ten (11) misconceptions of the Samurai webpage,<br/>\nwhich serves as the baseline for discussion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who wants to challenge those statements may do<br/>\nso, but the weight of Japanese Historical Scholastic<br/>\nEndeavours, in both English and Japanese, is against<br/>\nyou. <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, it&#39;s an internet web discussion group--nothing<br/>\nanyone says should be taken personally. Some people<br/>\ntend to load their messages with irony (I&#39;ve been<br/>\naccused of this...) and some people take that<br/>\npersonally. Don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know you, and you don&#39;t<br/>\nknow me. If someone comes around making claims of<br/>\nspeaking fluent Japanese and having XYZ amount of<br/>\nknowledge, I&#39;m immediately suspicious. I&#39;ve studied<br/>\nJapanese for 11 years now, live in Japan, deal with<br/>\nJapanese government officials on official business in<br/>\nJapanese on a daily basis, rented a house and make<br/>\nbank transactions in Japanese, and I still (and<br/>\nprobably never will) don&#39;t consider myself &quot;fluent&quot;.<br/>\nHowever, this happened on another board, and when I<br/>\nasked if said person could function in Japan, that<br/>\nperson provided me with ample evidence chronicling his<br/>\nlast 30 years or so in Japan. Skepticism gone. What it<br/>\nall boils down to is being able to back up your<br/>\nstatements/assertions with documentable facts and<br/>\nexperience, and if you can&#39;t, being willing to accept<br/>\nthe answers of those who can. <br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to your daughter, we look forward to her<br/>\nquestions and contributions to the board. Any issues,<br/>\nplease report them to me or Kitsuno, and they&#39;ll be<br/>\ndealt with. <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

However, I<br/>\nwill not respect anyone who blatantly prints such<br/>\ninaccurate historical information.

Most of the films here have been well <br/>\n&gt; discussed, and deserve their status. While I have lots of (very) <br/>\n&gt; obscure favorites, these are all benchmark films. <br/>\n&gt; 1)Seven Samurai-simply the best. <br/>\n&gt; 2)Kwaidan-the Japanese were (and are) very superstitious, and this <br/>\n&gt; compilation of four macabre tales is excellent. Art direction, <br/>\n&gt; photography, acting, and sound are all top notch. The highlight is <br/>\n&gt; the segment involving the spirits of the Taira from the battle of Dan-<br/>\n&gt; No-Ura.<br/>\n&gt; 3)Shogun-yeah, the 2 hour movie version sucked. And it&#39;s loaded with <br/>\n&gt; historical inaccuracies. But the 12 hour mini has stunning sets, <br/>\n&gt; costuming, great acting (from the Japanese part of the cast-never <br/>\n&gt; been a Chamberlain fan) and an involving story. Were it not for <br/>\n&gt; Shogun, much of the Western interest in Japanese history and cinema <br/>\n&gt; would never have happened. The King Of Ninja Misinformation, Stephen <br/>\n&gt; Hayes, makes his split second film debut.<br/>\n&gt; 4)Castle of The Spider&#39;s Web (Throne Of Blood)-great performance by <br/>\n&gt; Mifune along with Kurosawa&#39;s typically fantastic art direction and <br/>\n&gt; photography. This is his samurai flavored remake of Macbeth. <br/>\n&gt; 5)Heaven & Earth-Some folks really hate this film. I think it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; great. The battle scenes are among the best ever put to screen <br/>\n&gt; (albeit relatively bloodless). While the backstory of Uesugi Kenshin <br/>\n&gt; was well done, the film could have stood a bit more of it. The <br/>\n&gt; juxtaposition of the battles with scenes of nature is very Japanese.<br/>\n&gt; 6)Daimajin-a great samurai film all on its own, AND you get one of <br/>\n&gt; the most convincing Japanese giant monsters too! The evil god Majin <br/>\n&gt; inhabits the stone state of the province&#39;s protector and mashes the <br/>\n&gt; bad guys in the closing minutes of the film. If you went into this <br/>\n&gt; film cold, it&#39;s left up in the air whether Majin is just a legend or <br/>\n&gt; the real thing until he makes his grand appearance.<br/>\n&gt; 7)Hanzo The Razor:The Snare-a great break from the tired genre of <br/>\n&gt; noble ronin films. The Hanzo films work as drama, parody, comedy and <br/>\n&gt; chambara. It&#39;s still hard to believe Katsu could make such disparate <br/>\n&gt; characters as Hanzo and Zatoichi work-it&#39;s sometimes incomprehensible <br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s the same guy. And speaking of hard, the Hanzo films take <br/>\n&gt; the genre to new heights of bizarre set pieces.<br/>\n&gt; 8)Yojimbo-set the standard for the `anti hero&#39; ronin film, and did it <br/>\n&gt; with style.<br/>\n&gt; 9)Zatoichi & The Festival Of Fire-you could plug just about any <br/>\n&gt; Zatoichi film into this slot-they&#39;re basically all the same, but <br/>\n&gt; always enjoyable. For my money, Zatoichi is the best recurring <br/>\n&gt; character in Japanese cinema (other than Godzilla). The recent remake <br/>\n&gt; is good too.<br/>\n&gt; 10)Hara Kiri-the best of the noble ronin films, the 2 ½ hrs just fly <br/>\n&gt; by. Riveting performances and a completely believable story. You&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; be hating the Ii clan after seeing this.<br/>\n&gt; Honorable mention to Ran and Kagemusha, both of which are classics <br/>\n&gt; but just flawed enough to keep them out of my top 10. <br/>\n&gt; And for best Taiga drama-Toshiie & Matsu. OK, it&#39;s a `chick&#39; Taiga <br/>\n&gt; drama, but Toshiie is such an engaging goof and Matsu is just plain <br/>\n&gt; adorable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Awesome...I am definately going to be looking for some of these...thanks</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-457360114\">Hello everyone, coming out of lurk-dom. I just joined the email group though<br/>\nI&#39;ve been posting on the Delphi message board under the tag line<br/>\n&quot;Nevermore...&quot; (which is a NFL football reference, as I participate in some<br/>\nother Delphi forums and we discuss football. But needless to say, I won&#39;t<br/>\ndiscuss football here). I also participate (I&#39;m a moderator) in the Ninja<br/>\nDojo Samurai Film message board on EZBoard and there, I&#39;m known as &quot;Wave<br/>\nTossed&quot; (which I use for Amazon.com book and movie reviews and IMDB movie<br/>\nreviews). Email me if you want more information on the Ninja Dojo site.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo just a little introduction: My name is Nina Boal, I&#39;m female, American<br/>\n(live in the Baltimore, Maryland region), in my late fifties. I became<br/>\ninterested in Japanese history many years ago when I was studying kendo. I<br/>\nstudied kendo for around ten years, achieving the rank of shodan. A severe<br/>\nback injury has taken me out of kendo study. Now I have severe arthritis of<br/>\nthe knees and am wondering if I could ever take up the study of iaido at<br/>\nthis late stage, even with crippled knees. I do participate in swimming<br/>\nexercise and physical therapy to try and make my knees stronger but I still<br/>\ncannot sit in the seiza position because of my knees. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the meantime, I became a fan of Japanese cinema, particularly period<br/>\ndramas, jidai-geki and chambara films. The swordfighting in chambara films<br/>\nis not usually related to real kenjutsu or kendo; one of my kendo senseis<br/>\nused to admonish his students by telling us, &quot;that&#39;s not kendo, that&#39;s<br/>\nchambara!!&quot; Still, I like watching these films. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhich have inspired me to begin writing period pieces. I started out writing<br/>\nin fantasy/science fiction and have had several short stories published in<br/>\nanthologies that have been available on the mass market. But my direction in<br/>\nwriting has shifted to writing historical pieces, particularly about<br/>\nJapanese samurai. One of my efforts is &quot;Stray Dogs,&quot; which you can read on<br/>\nthe Samurai Archives web site. It won the First Samurai Fiction Short Story<br/>\ncontest. It is about a man whom I&#39;ve been interested in for years, Fuwa<br/>\nKazuemon, one of the Forty Seven Ronin. I&#39;m currently working on a novel<br/>\ninvolving completely fictional characters that takes place in 18th century<br/>\nJapan. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, finally to get to the topic here. I&#39;m a huge film buff. So here are my<br/>\nTop Ten Samurai Movies. The order is not static, though SEPPUKU (&quot;Hara<br/>\nKiri&quot;) always remains on the top:<br/>\n <br/>\n1. Seppuku (aka &quot;Hara Kiri&quot;): The best movie made, period, on any subject<br/>\nfrom any country. Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshiro) and Ishihama (Chijiiwa Motome)<br/>\nwere both stunning, as was Tamba (Onodaka Hikokuro) playing a real<br/>\nslimeball. A study of false &quot;bushido&quot; versus the real way of the warrior. A<br/>\nfilm made in 1962 about some 17th century Japanese people, and we&#39;re still<br/>\navidly discussing it in 2005 all over the world. Illustrates the staying<br/>\npower of a true classic.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The Seven Samurai: Another real classic and deservedly so. The first<br/>\nsamurai film I had ever seen. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. The Last Samurai directed by Misumi, not the one by Zwick with Cruise in<br/>\nit (don&#39;t get me started on that one... ) A truly epic film that captures<br/>\nthe end of the feudal era and the beginning of a more modern era in Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Three Outlaw Samurai: I believe that this was Gosha&#39;s first film. This<br/>\ntime, Tamba Tetsuro plays the oppressed good guy who comes to the aid of<br/>\nthose even more oppressed than he is. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Tange Sazen: I&#39;m just listing the character&#39;s name because all of the<br/>\nversions I&#39;ve seen of this tale are tied for this position: Gosha&#39;s two<br/>\nfilms (with Yorozuya Kinnosuke and also with Nakadai Tatsuya), the older<br/>\nfilms with Otomo Ryutaro plus another with Tamba Tetsuro; and the new one<br/>\nwith Toyokawa: all are quality films about this fascinating one-eyed,<br/>\none-armed swordsman.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Goyokin: Nakadai again, playing a man haunted by his role in the<br/>\nslaughter of a fishing village, and how he makes amends for what he has done<br/>\nas he saves another fishing village from slaughter.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Samurai Wolf: Natsuyagi Isao is great as a scroungy, hungry ronin named<br/>\nKiba Okaminosuke (&quot;Fangs of the Wolf&quot;) who comes into town working for food.<br/>\nHe wants to be a fierce &quot;wolf&quot; but in many ways, is more like a sweet,<br/>\nwistful puppy dog. Though he does wield a really mean sword. Natsuyagi also<br/>\nplays Fuwa Kazuemon in the TV special DAI CHUSHINGURA and does an excellent<br/>\njob there as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n8. Shogun&#39;s Samurai: The Yagyu Conspiracy: Grand tragedy with a big cast of<br/>\nstellar performers. <br/>\n<br/>\nTied for ninth/tenth place:<br/>\nHidden Blade: A recent film about a man who must decide between loyalty and<br/>\ndoing the right thing according to his beliefs. <br/>\nAfter The Rain: A ronin and his wife find that there are more important<br/>\nthings than fame or position. <br/>\nTwilight Samurai: Sanada is magnificent as a low-ranked, impoverished<br/>\nsamurai (who is an excellent swordsman) who must deal with raising his<br/>\nfamily as a single parent, and also must deal with a difficult task given to<br/>\nhim by his lord. <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of bellaireroad<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 30, 2005 12:58 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Top Ten Samurai Movies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your pick 1-10?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a>&gt; <br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a>&gt; <br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
