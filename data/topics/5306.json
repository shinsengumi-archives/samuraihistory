This would involve presenting your claim for vendetta to <br/>\n  the government and getting the OK to proceed. Such &quot;revenge&quot; killings <br/>\n  were accepted and pretty much considered a duty. After the samurai <br/>\n  had received the OK, tracked down the son, and killed him, he would <br/>\n  have to report his act to the local authorities along with presenting <br/>\n  his documentation. Also, in pursuing your vendetta, you could not <br/>\n  create a riotous situation or (in theory at least) risk the safety of <br/>\n  uninvolved parties. Then the samurai would go his merry way without <br/>\n  any negative legal consequences at all, having fulfilled his duty. Of <br/>\n  course, this could invite a vendetta from the just killed son&#39;s <br/>\n  family/retainers....<br/>\n  If the samurai just killed the son without following the rules, it <br/>\n  was up to the authorities to decide his fate based on the situation<br/>\n  (in your case, since the son had staged a coup and the father&#39;s <br/>\n  retainer killed him, the retainer might get off with a &#39;slap on the <br/>\n  wrist&#39;). <br/>\n  Before the Edo period, revenge killings were expected but not codifed <br/>\n  as during the Shogunate (at least not on a national level) so the <br/>\n  local reaction to a revenge or duty killing varied greatly. <br/>\n  In either case, the son in question is dead meat during the Edo <br/>\n  period-even if the samurai didn&#39;t get him the government would <br/>\n  (crucifixtion). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com&lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/&gt;<br/>\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt;<br/>\n  --- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Were there other <br/>\nforms of executions practiced (apologies for the morbidity of topic) <br/>\nother than seppuku, crucifixion?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, lots of them. Not so much during the Edo period where <br/>\ncrucifixtion was the standard, but during the Sengoku period and <br/>\nbefore, the forms of execution were pretty much subject to the local <br/>\nwarlord&#39;s whims. Just about anything was done...one of the most <br/>\ngruesome being one of the Saito clan boiling an enemy to death in a <br/>\nlarge cauldron (much like Lord Yabu did in Clavell&#39;s Shogun). This <br/>\nalso happened to the notorious bandit Ishikawa Goemon. Another <br/>\nwarlord (sorry, don&#39;t recall who) was buried up to his neck with a <br/>\nbamboo saw placed next to him and a sign inviting passersby to feel <br/>\nfree to have a go at him (Clavell used this too, for Lord Ishida). <br/>\nBeating a man to death was common as was death during torture (which <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a planned execution, but just sped up the process).</div>",

This would involve presenting your claim for vendetta to <br/>\nthe government and getting the OK to proceed. Such &quot;revenge&quot; killings <br/>\nwere accepted and pretty much considered a duty.
