These papers (4-6 pages) are usually to <br/>\nbe written in 4 days, and are real killers, since there is technically <br/>\nno time to double and triple check one&#39;s sources. (we usually read <br/>\n3-400 pages per paper) I usually exchange them with some of my <br/>\nclassmates the day before they&#39;re due, but rarely get a real input.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, since in this mailing list there are so many competent people, I <br/>\nwas thinking that maybe somebody ***MIGHT*** want to read the final <br/>\ndraft of my papers, and point out to eventual mistakes. More over, I <br/>\nsuppose I am not the only student here, so it would be cool if others <br/>\nas well would exchange papers and we could help each other, while <br/>\nlearning something new.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my paper is due on Tuesday... let me know here or in private if <br/>\nyou have the time and the will to check it... Or should I simply send <br/>\nit like a post, and the willing can criticize it. That would be... <br/>\nouch... but... why not??<br/>\nThanks and ban-banzai.<br/>\ncepo<br/>\n<br/>\nPS = Professor Tony and other faculty on the list...
