We knew it was there as previous excavations had unearthed one of<br/>\nthe roman gateways. <br/>\n<br/>\nit seems that the normans had used the roman wall as part of the foundations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently videoed a discovery channel program on the samurai and it had a lot<br/>\non Himeji castle. i forget the weight of the wooden structure but the<br/>\nfoundations for the castle must be amazing. Maybe that is one of the reasons<br/>\nfor the huge mound then to face it with huge boulders. the more reienforcement<br/>\nyou have the more weight it can take on top. It also seems Himeji has a wood<br/>\nbeam running vertical inside o fthe wood structure to stop it collapsing in<br/>\nthe even of an earth quake.<br/>\n<br/>\npaul<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Richardson<br/>\nBujinkan Lincoln Dojo 7th Dan<br/>\nwww.bujinkanuk.co.uk<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet free email and a permanent address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netaddress.com/?N=1\">http://www.netaddress.com/?N=1</a></div>",
