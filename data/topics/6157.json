            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1899162877\">Changsub,<br/>\n<br/>\n    I often get fascinated by obscure periods of history and start to <br/>\nresearch them.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I got interested in the Imjin War (which is what I&#39;ve read is the <br/>\nJapanese name for the invasion of Korea in the 1590s) because of two things.  One is <br/>\nthe availabilty of 15mm Korean cavalry and infantry figures from Eureka <br/>\nminiatures in Australia.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    The other is a seven part series on the Korean army by Rob Morgan which <br/>\nwas published in the Arquebusier (a British journal dedicated to the <br/>\nRenaissance period).<br/>\n<br/>\n    I have collected a list of references on the Imjin War, which is below.  <br/>\nI actually need to add to it, which I will do over the holidays and then I&#39;ll <br/>\npost them to the group&#39;s archives.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I did find a reference on the Internet to an upcoming Korean movie about <br/>\nthe Japanese invasion.  Here is what the blurb said:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;SOLDIERS OF HEAVEN. (&quot;Cheon-gun&quot;) A group of soldiers from North and South<br/>\n<br/>\nKorea are caught in a timewarp and swept back to 1592 and find themselves in<br/>\n<br/>\nthe middle of the Imjin War. The cast includes Park Jung-hoon, Kim<br/>\n<br/>\nSeung-woo, Hwang Jeong-min and Kong Hyo-jin. The production company, Sidus,<br/>\n<br/>\nhas budgeted around 8 million dollars on this project which will be filmed<br/>\n<br/>\nby new director Min Jun-gi. Filming began on July 20 and there is an<br/>\n<br/>\nestimated release sometime in April 2005.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I just hope it gets released with English subtitles.  If it shows a lot <br/>\nof Korean soldiers I could use it as a painting guide for when I finally buy my <br/>\nKorean army.<br/>\n<br/>\n    If you know of any other references in English about this war, please let <br/>\nme know.<br/>\nI&#39;m especially interested in finding colour illustrations of Korean troops.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;ve listed a booklet by the Korean Defense Department below that I would <br/>\nespecially like to get a copy of.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Burke<br/>\n<br/>\nReferences for Japanese Invasion of Korea<br/>\n<br/>\n    “The Book of Corrections, Reflections on the National Crisis During the <br/>\nJapanese Invasion of Korea, 1592-1598”, by Yu Songnyong (translated by Choi <br/>\nByonghyon), Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, <br/>\nCalifornia, 2002.<br/>\n<br/>\n    “In the Field as a Kitten - In the Castle as a Tiger”, by Rob Morgan, <br/>\npublished in various issues of the Arquebusier.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Part 1: “The Signal Gun?

Up to this point the <br/>\noutgunned Korean defenders had suffered defeat after defeat and been forced to <br/>\nabandon all of Korea’s major cities and fortresses and seek refuge along the <br/>\nChinese border. They requested help from Ming China, Korea’s tributary <br/>\noverlords and even though a small Ming expeditionary force was defeated in the summer <br/>\nof 1592, the Ming promised to send more aid. This arrived in early 1593 and <br/>\ntogether with Korean troops and volunteers, the Ming overwhelmed the Japanese <br/>\nwith superior firepower and recovered the city of Pyongyang, Korea’s auxiliary <br/>\ncapital. Within months Seoul was also recovered and the Japanese never regained <br/>\ntheir early momentum.<br/>\n <br/>\n    “The Three Great Campaigns of the Wanli Emperor: Court, Military, and <br/>\nSociety in Late Sixteenth Century China”, Dissertation by Kenneth Swope, <br/>\navailable from UMI (#3022033).<br/>\n<br/>\n    “Korean Boats & Ships”, by Horace Underwood, Transactions of the Royal <br/>\nAsiatic Society of Korea, 23 (1934), pp 1-99.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    “The Celestial Warriors: A Drama of Military Aid and Corruption in the <br/>\nKorean War, 1592-98,”, by Nam-lin Hur, in Dimensions of Korea’s Imjin War, <br/>\n1592-98, ed.

There was<br/>\nno significant milarty event worthy of a record except<br/>\nfor one incidence when a low rank officer of Chosun<br/>\ndynasty scrared off some Japanese soldiers who shot<br/>\nmuskets for fun by shooting several arrows across the<br/>\nriver.<br/>\nI also don&#39;t remember seeing any movies on the Imjin<br/>\ncrossing although I was in Korea only until 1998.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                            <br/>\n                         Sincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                         Changsub Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:burker1@...\">burker1@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does anyone know of any Samurai movies about the<br/>\n&gt; Imjin War, Japan&#39;s invasion <br/>\n&gt; of Korea in the 1590s?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If so, where can I find a copy with English<br/>\n&gt; subtitles?
