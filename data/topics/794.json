I have never read your book, is that true do they take their <br/>\nideas from your books, thats a pretty cool compliment then, they say <br/>\nimitaition is the best compliment.  I still think the detail is good <br/>\nI am no expert but I have seen other complanies 25mm and there Bushi <br/>\nranges are to put it kind poor/.  (^_^) (^O^) I do think they are too <br/>\nexpensive though.  I might have to buy your book sometime to check <br/>\nthat out.  Maybe you should get them to put a link to your book, they <br/>\nhave Turnbulls, by the bucket load (what a surprise!). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways cheers for replying <br/>\n<br/>\nMark   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nA.J Bryant wrote<br/>\n<br/>\nMwa ha ha!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love it.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-10203923\">Hi all<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been browsing the web again and have found a fantasic website <br/>\non the Bushi/Buke, it is called www.eastofindia.com I just had to <br/>\ntell you guys, it rocks. It really does.  It is basically a site <br/>\nselling minatures of the samurai in 54mm scale, this in itself may be <br/>\ninteresting to some, but it is the detail and depth that the <br/>\nminatures go to that makes it so good.  The armies of Tokugawa Ieyasu <br/>\nand the Mori clan are portrayed also Ii Naomasa (1561-1602) Red <br/>\ndevils (Not manchester united, but a crack cavalry unit wearing red <br/>\narmour.  All the figures have correct Monsho and Sashimono <br/>\nBackbanners, and sword positions, they even have the 47 ronin.  It is <br/>\nhowever obvious that there is a catch the catch is they are damn <br/>\nexpensive too much for the likes of me approx 30 Usd each and 60 for <br/>\na cavalry model.  So only for connosiuers really.  But the site is <br/>\nworth checking out for it&#39;s photo&#39;s of the various samurai and <br/>\nhistorical context.  Personally I used to collect minatures but gave <br/>\nit up about 12 years ago as to cost and also I was growing out of it, <br/>\nseeing this I have been severley tempted to start up this hobby <br/>\nagain, but with more of a historical sway, I would like to collect a <br/>\nfull samurai army of the Hosokawa clan, Date, Mogami, I could go on, <br/>\nbut I won&#39;t, so check out the site to see what I am talking about <br/>\nhope you lot like it, message me back with comments.  Also I agree <br/>\nwith the last comments about the royal armouries at Leeds it is <br/>\nexcellent, I met Ian Bottomly the curator of the oriental gallery and <br/>\nsaw some behind the scenes armour for a university archaelogy <br/>\nproject, he is an expert on Japan check out his book samurai arms and <br/>\narmour and he changed my view on the Bushi for ever, Turnbull has <br/>\nsuch a rosy view sometimes.  I saw a helmet with rabbit ears the <br/>\nbizzarist coolist, thing I have ever seen to do with samurai.  Anyway <br/>\ncheck out that website you won&#39;t regret anything but the price.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best Mark</div>",
