I&#39;ve <br/>\nenjoyed the knowledgeable discussions and even the not so <br/>\nknowledgeable discussions as well, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, before I start explaining what this post is about, keep in <br/>\nmind that I&#39;m at university majoring in Asian Studies and <br/>\nPhilosophy, with my major interest being anything to do with East <br/>\nAsia, and especially Japan.  I&#39;m quite widely read on Japanese <br/>\nculture, history and language.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy university&#39;s anime society is holding its second convention in a <br/>\ncouple of weeks and I&#39;m presenting two lectures/discussions in a <br/>\nmore serious, educational and factual nature then what is usually <br/>\npresented at such events.  One is titled &quot;Shinto, its origins and <br/>\nwhat it means to modern Japan&quot; (being of major importance to my <br/>\npotential post-graduate studies/research) and the other is <br/>\ntitled &quot;Samurai, Ninja and Mythconceptions&quot;.  Now the purpose of <br/>\nthis post is to ask the samurai history community about any good <br/>\nresources/links related to the second topic, well anything relating <br/>\nto the first is quite welcome too.  I&#39;ve come across quite a lot of <br/>\ninfo already, the uni library has a very large collection of books <br/>\nabout Japan, in fact too much, because I can&#39;t possibly look at it <br/>\nall before the con Â… I&#39;m also doing a summer school unit which takes <br/>\npriority. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s ok with Nate, I would like to quote extensively from <br/>\nhis &quot;Common Misconceptions Concerning those Kewl Ninja&quot; as well <br/>\nas &quot;The Top Eleven Western, Modern Day Common Misconceptions About <br/>\nThe Samurai&quot;, is that yours as well Nate?  Also do you have any <br/>\nreferences for these articles?  <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nWarren</div>",
