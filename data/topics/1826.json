Plz Explain... Was: Tokugawa Evil? <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just so happen to live in Sweden, the southern part of Sweden. History<br/>\n&gt;is my favourite hobby, and I really cant recall any autrocities done by<br/>\n&gt;the catholic curch to us. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please explain what Gustav Adolphus was doing in the 30 years war then, <br/>\nwhat if he lost big time and Sweden was occupied ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Nope, we are friendly, peacefull people in Sweden, and as such we have<br/>\n&gt;been treated nicely by the Father.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I forgot the nickname for Gustav, &quot;Lion of the North&quot;? God protect us <br/>\nfrom Vikings and Irish (old English prayer) It would be hard to point to <br/>\na culture on earth that didn&#39;t have wars. May be I should us the term <br/>\ncivilization (city folk) since there were a few hunter gatherer tribes <br/>\nthat weren&#39;t very warlike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well thats what I remember from my history lessons in my 12 year carer<br/>\n&gt;of grammar school, junior high and highschool. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Time to crack the books again ;) I know from personal experience that <br/>\nNONE of the juicy bits of history are taught in most grade schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo keep this on topic, I would contrast and compare the armies of the 30 <br/>\nyears war with the Sengoku period armies. I would consider Japan to be a <br/>\ndecent military power until Gustavus introduced fast and mobile <br/>\nartillery after which Europe keeps developing its military and Japan <br/>\nlies stagnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
