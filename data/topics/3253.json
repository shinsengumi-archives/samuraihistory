            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1534062736\">Wilson-<br/>\n\tSeveral things to consider here. Are your swords traditionally made <br/>\n(preferably signed) Japanese swords? OR are they Paul Chen, Michael <br/>\nBell, Howard Clark swords or Showa-to (swords from the war years)? The <br/>\nfirst can be licensed and carried in Japan the second group cannot. <br/>\nlaws restricting the ownership of Swords are strict but not onerous. <br/>\nThe best thing to do is establish yourself in Japan, leave your swords <br/>\nat home. Once you have a visa, job and address have your swords sent to <br/>\nyou. They will be sent to the Head office of the Post Office in your <br/>\nprefecture (though they are addressed to you). This office is not <br/>\nalways in a convenient place; if you live in Kanagawa you have to go to <br/>\nTokyo.<br/>\n\tOnce every two months there is a shinsa at the post office you will <br/>\nhave to present yourself there on the appointed day. Your package will <br/>\nbe opened by a government appointed appraiser who will make the <br/>\ndetermination if your sword is a weapon or if it has potential value as <br/>\na collectible. If it passes shinsa, you will have to pay something like <br/>\n$100 per sword or a little less and then your swords will be sent to <br/>\nyou along with a registration card. This card must be carried with the <br/>\nsword at all times and you must present it to the police if asked. Once <br/>\nthe blade is registered you will likely never be asked for the <br/>\nregistration (until you leave)and will be free to travel about with <br/>\nyour sword.<br/>\n\tIf your sword is deemed a weapon it must be returned to the country of <br/>\norigin. If you fail to report for shinsa and fail to notify the post <br/>\noffice it will be returned to the country of origin or confiscated. You <br/>\ncan bring your swords into Japan on the plane, provided the airline <br/>\nlets you, these days it is tougher and tougher. When you get to the <br/>\nairport tell the authorities you have swords and are requesting a <br/>\nshinsa and registration. A police inspector will be called and he can <br/>\ntake hours to show, that is why you tell them the moment you get off <br/>\nthe plane. At the airport police station they will do a shinsa and <br/>\nissue you a temporary registration. If you have your act together this <br/>\nmay only add an hour or so to your time at the airport. Remember the <br/>\npolice inspector typically doesn&#39;t know swords as well as the <br/>\ninspectors at the post office. If he doesn&#39;t like the swords, they will <br/>\nhave to be sent back, expensive and time consuming.<br/>\n\tIf you have a Sensei or know a sword dealer in your area, they could <br/>\nact as your agent, the swords could be sent ahead and be waiting for <br/>\nyou. However this is a huge pain in the A**, and is a lot to ask <br/>\nsomeone who is not your dearest of friends. Frankly no amount of money <br/>\nmakes the registration part of handling swords profitable...<br/>\n-t</div>",
