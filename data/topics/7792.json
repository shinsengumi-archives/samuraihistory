            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1287111091\">I realize that this is a history list and not a film criticism/discussion<br/>\nlist. However, I do think that historical novels or films can sometimes give<br/>\nus a few insights into studying actual history, especially when source<br/>\ndocuments or accounts that are contemporary to the time being studied are<br/>\nnot always available. So I&#39;m going to go ahead and discuss some films here.<br/>\nI&#39;ll try and relate the discussion of films to the study of history. <br/>\n<br/>\nDiscussing AFTER THE RAIN: Just my opinion, but I try to be careful when<br/>\nusing terms such as &quot;western&quot;. What does that really mean? That Kurosawa was<br/>\ninfluenced by non-Japanese (American or European) writings or films? Or that<br/>\nhe incorporated some of these concepts and ideas into his own script for<br/>\nAFTER THE RAIN and/or his other films?  Many American or European novelists<br/>\nand film makers have adopted Japanese ideas and concepts into their works.<br/>\nSo does that make them &quot;eastern?&quot; What constitutes &quot;western&quot; and &quot;eastern?&quot;<br/>\nHow meaningful are these concepts, really? <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso which Japanese criticized Kurosawa and what were their specific<br/>\ncriticisms? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not one who espouses &quot;identity politics,&quot; which I understand to be a<br/>\nstrain of academic thought that people should only write or create or<br/>\ninterpret from their own cultural experiences and not stray into the<br/>\nexperiences of cultures not their own.  I don&#39;t follow this, as in some<br/>\nways, we all belong to the culture known as &quot;human beings.&quot; We don&#39;t exist<br/>\nin a vacuum; so anyone, whether Japanese, European, American, African,<br/>\nwhatever, will be influenced to a greater or lesser extent by other cultures<br/>\nand not just by the culture that we may have grown up in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the issue as to whether a person such as the main character in AFTER<br/>\nTHE RAIN can be a &quot;good&quot; samurai: Are you trying to say that this would be a<br/>\n&quot;western&quot; idea, that a man like this might be an admirable samurai? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are correct in that within the Edo period, a bushi who makes his living<br/>\nby swordfighting for money was not considered to be very honorable at all.<br/>\nBecause the ethic was that a samurai was supposed to use his sword skills in<br/>\nservice to his lord and not for monetary gain. That was the ethic of the<br/>\nday. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then why study history? Do we simply say, &quot;this swordsman was<br/>\ndishonorable because that&#39;s what was thought by the majority in the time<br/>\nthat he lived&quot; and leave it at that? Don&#39;t we sometimes study history to<br/>\nstudy these codes of ethics -- and sometimes to question them? Or is this<br/>\n&quot;western?&quot; I don&#39;t think so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve discussed Kobayashi Masaki&#39;s film SEPPUKU here earlier. In this film,<br/>\na ronin shows up at the gate of a daimyo&#39;s Edo headquarters, stating that he<br/>\nwishes a spot to commit seppuku so as to no longer have to live in dire<br/>\npoverty. It turns out that this ronin didn&#39;t even have real swords, but had<br/>\npawned them and substituted bamboo blades for his real ones; he had sold his<br/>\n&quot;soul of the samurai&quot; for money. So how could he commit seppuku? It turns<br/>\nout further that seppuku wasn&#39;t his real motive, he really wanted to beg for<br/>\nmoney. How more dishonorable than that can a samurai be? This was the ethic<br/>\nof the day, and in the film, the clan involved, the Ii clan, decide to give<br/>\nout a stern message by forcing the man to commit seppuku with his bamboo<br/>\nblade. According to the standards of that society, that was a just and<br/>\nappropriate response to this man&#39;s shameless beggary and extortion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then Kobayashi turns the whole event upside down by revealing that<br/>\nperhaps this man had very few alternatives to what he had chosen to do. His<br/>\nfamily was sick and starving and he had no way to support them, even though<br/>\nhe had tried. Would it have been more honorable to let his family starve and<br/>\ndie rather than attempt to get money to try and save them?  Was the clan&#39;s<br/>\nreaction honorable and just? Or cruel and sadistic? All these questions get<br/>\nraised in the film. Though the events he portrays are set in the 17th<br/>\ncentury in Japan, these questions that are raised apply all over the world,<br/>\nthroughout different ages -- that could have been one of the motives for<br/>\nKobayashi to make this historical film. Did this make Kobayashi &quot;western?&quot; I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think so.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another subject: how does the study of historical films and novels relate<br/>\nto the study of actual history? Most fiction is speculative and there are<br/>\nthose who find it worthless because it is fiction and not an attempt to<br/>\nstudy what is &quot;real.&quot; But some of us do turn to fiction because other<br/>\nsources aren&#39;t available. I find it interesting: did Kobayashi turn to a<br/>\nferile imagination when he made the film about samurai begging for funds<br/>\nwhile claiming to want to commit seppuku? Or is it possible that this sort<br/>\nof thing actually happened? Is the bamboo-blade seppuku a product of a wild<br/>\nimagination, or is it possible that something like this may also have<br/>\nhappened but the historical accounts are lost? That is the nature of<br/>\nspeculative fiction. It might have a place in studying history or perhaps it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 500 Ryo.

The idea of an accountant that uses a ploy to<br/>\ntrick kenjutsu masters into feeding him (effectively begging) then when he<br/>\nfinally can fence, fencing for money is all despicable in the eyes of<br/>\nsamurai (as they made clear at the end of the film). <br/>\nThe samurai (masterfully portrayed by Mifune Shiro) was an amazing swordsman<br/>\nand a very nice man, but by &quot;period&quot; samurai standards, not a worthy<br/>\nsamurai. <br/>\nThis is not a story about a great samurai, it is at its heart a love story<br/>\nand the relationship between a man and his wife and how she grows to respect<br/>\nhim and love him not for who she wants him to become but for who he is.<br/>\n<br/>\n[snips]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nYahoo!
