            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-745333333\">Yes, the orders passed by Toyotomi made a big impact on all of this. Ironically, it was his decrees that solidified the &quot;status&quot; of most Ji-samurai as Ji-samurai.  For example, I was talking about the Iba of Kirihara in a previous email. Some of them were &quot;legal country samurai&quot;... but some of them had, in the weird workings of Toyotomi, lost their &quot;legal status&quot; as samurai..<br/>\n However, in the backwoods... &quot;legal status&quot; means very little. They maintained their samurai lifestyle, married farmer&#39;s daughters if they wanted, and continue to train and amass weapons. Large areas of land also belonged to them. In a way, these domains made excellent hide-outs for certain groups. <br/>\n <br/>\n      Kinda like how the ronin rules led to all the drama at Kyoto in the early 1620s, these samurai status and &quot;you can&#39;t do this&quot; decrees passed by Toyotomi actually created a blackmarket of samurai activity, as it were.<br/>\n <br/>\n    Because of the family ties between Ji-samurai who legally had status and Ji-Samurai who had lost their status.... Many ubran samurai eventually a distaste for the Ji-samurai in general. <br/>\n <br/>\n     &quot;Country Samurai&quot; was indeed meant as an insult at the time.<br/>\n  <br/>\nLike I said before, it would be like calling someone a &quot;hick&quot; or a &quot;redneck&quot;.  However, some Ji-samurai loved the name, just like some love being a &quot;country hick&quot; these days. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 2/17/10, Michael Lorimer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mijalo_jp@...\">mijalo_jp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Michael Lorimer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mijalo_jp@...\">mijalo_jp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Ji-samurai, Ikki, and Sousen?

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1490835580\">Some of my family&#39;s ancestors can be identified as Ji-samurai.  This was because they were located deep in rural territory (out in Gamo-gun Omihachiman area) and while most of them were identified as samurai,  some of them were officially not recognized as samurai, even though many of their relatives were.. it created an ackward situation. Remember, deep in the rural areas, the &quot;laws and codes&quot; were easily bent. Samurai marrying peasant girls, etc.etc.  --- and because of this, many of the samurai in the more urban areas -- who knew this kind of stuff was going on --- held these samurai in contempt and thus, the country samurai were seen as being barely samurai by most non-country samurai.<br/>\n So, in my experience,  Ji-Samurai refers to samurai families that live &quot;out in the woods&quot; and might even be married into farmer/merchent families.  There were also ackward situations of ronins coming out and staying at their ji-samurai relative&#39;s lands and using their relative&#39;s land as an headquarters to run mercenary-like businesses,etc.etc.<br/>\n <br/>\n   O.k.. basically... the idea of Ji-Samurai is like &quot;redneck samurai&quot; or &quot;hillbilly samurai&quot;... .you live way out in the boon-docks, you don&#39;t follow many of the laws and customs, and because of this, you don&#39;t get alot of respect from your urban counter-parts.. but you get away with ALOT of stuff out in those boon-docks !<br/>\n <br/>\n Hahaha.. I love ji-samurai... hahaha<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 2/15/10, konohawolfie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Greywolf456@...\">Greywolf456@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: konohawolfie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Greywolf456@...\">Greywolf456@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Ji-samurai, Ikki, and Sousen?
