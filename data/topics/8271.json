            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1267009690\">Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Brian Bradford and I am the author of a set of wargame <br/>\nrules that will allow a person to recreate the battles of Sengoku <br/>\nJapan with model soldiers.  The rules are called Killer Katanas 2.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe original edition was published back in 1995 and I have just <br/>\nrecently published an improved second version of the book.  The rules <br/>\nwere developed using the latest information at my disposal with the <br/>\nassistance of samurai authors Terje Solumn and Dr. Stephen Turnbull.  <br/>\nSo popular was the first edition of the rules that they were used as <br/>\na reference for the Electronic Arts PC game &quot;Shogun: Total War&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of KK2 is to allow larger battles of the samurai to be <br/>\nfought.  Included in the 120+ page book is army lists and rules for <br/>\nclans so that a player can recreate their favorite Daimyo&#39;s army on <br/>\nthe tabletop, game uses for 22 tactical battle formations, ability <br/>\nratings for over 500 Daimyo, siege rules, a points system for <br/>\ndesigning armies and battles, a scenario generator and 10 historical <br/>\nbattle scenarios: 4th Kawanakajima, 2nd Konodai, Mimasetoge, <br/>\nNunobeyama, Anegawa, Mikatagahara, Nagashino, Okitanawate, Hitotori <br/>\nBridge and Sekigahara.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules are laser printed on high-quality paper and are spiral <br/>\nbound with a glossy cover depicting a scene from the Battle of <br/>\nTennoji.  Even if you are not a gamer the book is full of information <br/>\nand contains many items never before printed in the English language.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in a copy you can get one at Amazon.com by <br/>\ndoing a search for &quot;Killer Katanas,&quot; or you can order it direct from <br/>\nme by sending an email to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BBradford1973@...\">BBradford1973@...</a>.  The cost of each <br/>\nbook is $35 plus postage.  I can accept paypal.<br/>\n<br/>\nArrigato!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian</div>",
