Mitsuhide got the holders of some castle to come out to negotiate by giving over his mother to them as a hostage.  Nobunaga promptly had them all exectued.  Of course, Mitsuhide&#39;s mother was then killed in retaliation.  Mitsuhide probably justifiably held Nobunaga at fault for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;squrpio_prince&quot; &lt;squrpio_prince@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      What exactly happened to make Akechi Mitshuhide want to kill <br/>\n&gt; him?
