The Battle of Sekigahara was in 1600 and SDK is set to begin <br/>\nfour years after that battle (1604) so at least then Yuya and Megeira <br/>\nwere not breaking any laws of that period in Japanese Shogunate <br/>\nhistory. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the sites I found my info on:-<br/>\nLaw-<br/>\nwww.wikipedia.org/sekigahara<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blindkat.hegewisch.net/pirates/multibarrel.html\">http://blindkat.hegewisch.net/pirates/multibarrel.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blindkat.hegewisch.net/other/7pistols.html\">http://blindkat.hegewisch.net/other/7pistols.html</a><br/>\nwww.dave-cushman.net/shot/ducksfoot.html<br/>\nwww.thewayofthepirates.com/pirate-life/pirate-pistols.php<br/>\n<br/>\nArigatou er thanks a lot for all the help you guys and gals have been <br/>\nin helping me out in this and other questions I have had about anime <br/>\nand stuff over the years.
