            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1013842827\">On Dec 10, 2003, at 7:14 PM, Toshimi HIra wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear friends,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can some body tell me about the HEIKE history.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Toshimi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heike monogatari<br/>\nThe Tale of the Heike<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important of the Kamakura (1185�1333) and Muromachi <br/>\n(1333�1568) period prose tales known as gunki monogatari, or �war <br/>\ntales.� It deals with the short heyday of the Taira family (the 20 <br/>\nyears following the Hogen Disturbance [1156] and the Heiji Disturbance <br/>\n[1160], when they not only defeated their rivals, the Minamoto family, <br/>\nbut also ousted the Fujiwara family from its dominant position at <br/>\ncourt) and the five years of the Taira-Minamoto War. The war began with <br/>\nthe Minamoto rising again in 1180 and ended with the crushing defeat of <br/>\nthe Taira in 1185. The tale divides into roughly three parts. The <br/>\ncentral figure in the first is Taira no Kiyomori. Arrogant, evil, and <br/>\nruthless, he is above all so consumed by the fires of hatred for the <br/>\nMinamoto that he dies in agony, his feverish body beyond all cooling, <br/>\neven when he is immersed in water. The main figures of the second and <br/>\nthird parts are generals on the Minamoto side, first Minamoto no <br/>\nYoshinaka and then, after his death, the heroic Minamoto no Yoshitsune, <br/>\na youthful military genius wrongly suspected of treachery by his elder <br/>\nbrother Minamoto no Yoritomo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeike monogatari abounds in stirring scenes of battle, recounting brave <br/>\ndeeds by warriors proud of their lineage and military prowess and <br/>\nprizing loyalty above life. Dealing with the cataclysmic upheavals of <br/>\nthis time of Taira and Minamoto rivalry, it undoubtedly has a grand <br/>\nsweep about it that can be described as �epic.� Whether it may truly be <br/>\ntermed an epic is debatable, principally because of its lyrical and <br/>\nemotional content. Several episodes about tragic lovers or love affairs <br/>\nhave an atmosphere redolent of the mono no aware of Heian court <br/>\nliterature. Also, the emphasis throughout is very much on the pathos of <br/>\nthe situation of the Taira, a warrior family that rose to importance at <br/>\ncourt, only to be forced out by uncouth rivals from eastern Japan. The <br/>\natmosphere of the whole work is permeated by the Buddhist doctrine that <br/>\nall human activity is ephemeral and illusory, that the mighty are soon <br/>\ncast down, and that nothing avails but faith in the grace of the Buddha <br/>\nAmida.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch Buddhist sentiments are not uncommon in the literature of the <br/>\ntime, but the reason for their prominence in Heike monogatari is that <br/>\nthose responsible for the development of this work were chanters (biwa <br/>\nhoshi), lute-playing priests who traveled the country reciting this and <br/>\nother chronicles. They were blind men who used no fixed text but rather <br/>\nrecreated the work at each performance on the basis of oral formulae. <br/>\nThe original Heike text, dating from the early 13th century, comprises <br/>\nmaterial from various sources, including oral tales about the wars, <br/>\nsome of which may have been first told as religious rituals for the <br/>\nbenefit of the dead warriors. From the mid-13th century, two traditions <br/>\ndeveloped. One was a line of texts for silent reading, culminating <br/>\ninGempei seisuiki, and the other was a line of texts for oral chanters, <br/>\nwhich contained many passages in the 7-5 syllable rhythm of classical <br/>\npoetry. The chanted tradition continued well into the Muromachi period, <br/>\nbut of all the approximately 100 texts of theHeike, the accepted <br/>\nstandard is the version dictated by a master Heike performer, Akashi <br/>\nKakuichi, just before his death in 1371. Heike texts vary not only in <br/>\nwording but also in content, revealing the development of social <br/>\nattitudes and ideals of conduct.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeike monogatari contains so much of varied human interest that it has <br/>\nbeen almost as popular a source for later Japanese writers as has Genji <br/>\nmonogatari (Tale of Genji). It has provided material for a number of No <br/>\nplays. Some of these, such as Atsumori, are �warrior pieces,� but <br/>\nseveral are based on more lyrical episodes about tragic lovers, <br/>\nparticularly women, such as Gio, Senju, and Kogo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

His latest movie, &quot;The<br/>\n&gt;Last Samurai,&quot; falls squarely into the realm of the<br/>\n&gt;previous Zwick bedeviled-hero films, &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Courage<br/>\n&gt;Under Fire&quot; and &quot;The Siege.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And I do mean squarely. &quot;Samurai&quot; is a mythic western that<br/>\n&gt;combines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in<br/>\n&gt;Japanese culture: John Ford&#39;s &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot; It<br/>\n&gt;depicts phalanxes of troops moving with deliberate,<br/>\n&gt;terrifying fervor across the very wide screen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And this time Tom Cruise, the can-do idol of millions, uses<br/>\n&gt;his polished-chrome smile mirthlessly. At least for the<br/>\n&gt;first hour, his grin looks like a faded tattoo. The uneven<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Samurai&quot; is a can-do movie that&#39;s far more effective at<br/>\n&gt;communicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more<br/>\n&gt;intimate ones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mr. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a burned-out former Army<br/>\n&gt;officer and Indian fighter. Having survived Custer&#39;s Last<br/>\n&gt;Stand in 1876, he is now a commercial sideshow prop,<br/>\n&gt;demonstrating the newest Winchester rifle. As Algren<br/>\n&gt;lumbers through the clich�s he&#39;s hired to recite before<br/>\n&gt;blasting away at targets - though the whiskey oozing from<br/>\n&gt;his pores probably makes him more of a danger than the<br/>\n&gt;weapon - a sudden ember of regret flames in this<br/>\n&gt;ex-soldier&#39;s eyes. He goes off the script, reciting the<br/>\n&gt;horrors of a campaign in which he and his troops<br/>\n&gt;slaughtered innocents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Algren looks so wasted and beleaguered that the biggest<br/>\n&gt;question is not whether he&#39;ll wing an audience member with<br/>\n&gt;a stray shot, but whether he can bear up under the dense,<br/>\n&gt;cast-iron plot. After being bounced by the Winchester<br/>\n&gt;folks, Algren is hired by his former commander, Colonel<br/>\n&gt;Bagley (Tony Goldwyn, playing a salamanderlike ancestor of<br/>\n&gt;all the sleazy characters he&#39;s ever portrayed). Bagley<br/>\n&gt;wants Algren to travel with him to Tokyo and train Japanese<br/>\n&gt;soldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles. The<br/>\n&gt;Meiji emperor is ready to accept the ways of the West; he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;actually being pressured to by American business interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Once in Japan, Algren is forced to send his nervous,<br/>\n&gt;underprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against<br/>\n&gt;an enemy of the emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken<br/>\n&gt;Watanabe). Despite the imperial army&#39;s modern weapons,<br/>\n&gt;Katsumoto and his men sweep in with ferocity and wield<br/>\n&gt;their arms of the past - swords and spears - with lethal<br/>\n&gt;effectiveness. The cinematographer, John Toll, films their<br/>\n&gt;arrival through a thick fog in a forest, as if Katsumoto&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;men were ghosts from the recent past out to rob Algren&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;troops of their backbones - and their lives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In their ritual armor, Katsumoto&#39;s men make quick work of<br/>\n&gt;their foes; there&#39;s tragicomic relief as Algren&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;conscripted farmers tremble while trying to load their<br/>\n&gt;guns. When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto&#39;s second in<br/>\n&gt;command, he&#39;s captured by the invaders and, even more<br/>\n&gt;bewildering, cared for by Katsumoto&#39;s sister, Taka<br/>\n&gt;(Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren murdered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s a complicated story, and Mr. Zwick is complicated,<br/>\n&gt;too: he loves arrogance slapped out of its self-regard.<br/>\n&gt;Algren is full of himself, even though he&#39;s conceived as a<br/>\n&gt;man who was second tenor to a legend; he knew and despised<br/>\n&gt;Custer. Looking fashionably distressed, with slightly<br/>\n&gt;puffy, red-rimmed eyes that at the very least suggest that<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s survived a grueling press junket, Mr. Cruise has a<br/>\n&gt;worn cockiness. His aw-shucks virility is a little wilted,<br/>\n&gt;if not mildewed, around the edges: a kind of reverse<br/>\n&gt;narcissism, since Algren is proud of his dissolution<br/>\n&gt;(though Mr. Cruise&#39;s good-boy posture works for a man<br/>\n&gt;reared under the disciplinary rigors of the military).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Although at times Mr. Cruise comes off as too contemporary<br/>\n&gt;for the 19th century - at one point, he seems to be waiting<br/>\n&gt;for a cellphone call to confirm his terms for a cover of<br/>\n&gt;Details magazine - this displacement fits better when he<br/>\n&gt;becomes a prisoner. Algren appears to be reacting to this<br/>\n&gt;strange new world through sounds; nothing he&#39;s hearing<br/>\n&gt;makes any sense to him. He&#39;s a mangy gaijin that Edgar Rice<br/>\n&gt;Burroughs might have invented, though James Clavell got<br/>\n&gt;there eventually.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The film includes notable performances by actors not<br/>\n&gt;drafted to shoulder the burden of the entire production.<br/>\n&gt;Billy Connolly, emanating a gamy, sly menace that he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;rarely suggested before, plays Algren&#39;s former sergeant at<br/>\n&gt;arms, Zebulon Gant. Gant, used to propping up his old<br/>\n&gt;friend and superior officer, joins Algren in the journey to<br/>\n&gt;Japan. Mr. Connolly&#39;s loose, hostile vivacity registers so<br/>\n&gt;clearly that it&#39;s obvious we won&#39;t be seeing very much of<br/>\n&gt;him. But this is crackling, rigorous comic work; he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;have to present the face of tragedy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The far more weighted and daring acting comes from Mr.<br/>\n&gt;Watanabe, as Katsumoto. Probably best known outside of<br/>\n&gt;Japan as the reedy, restless sidekick in the gourmand<br/>\n&gt;classic &quot;Tampopo,&quot; Mr. Watanabe has filled out physically<br/>\n&gt;and spiritually. The formality he brings to Katsumoto is<br/>\n&gt;hard-won, especially when he&#39;s having pointedly thoughtful<br/>\n&gt;conversations with Algren that sound more like translations<br/>\n&gt;of ideograms than actual dialogue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The film never really explains how or why this resolute,<br/>\n&gt;isolated samurai learned to speak English better than the<br/>\n&gt;emperor. His fluency doesn&#39;t quite make sense, though it<br/>\n&gt;gives the movie some needed mystique. It plays better than<br/>\n&gt;the inexorable pull of romance, drawing Taka and Algren<br/>\n&gt;together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; which Mr. Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz<br/>\n&gt;wrote with John Logan, from a story by Mr. Logan,<br/>\n&gt;super-glues together a host of contradictions.<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunately, as dramatized, they function as conventions<br/>\n&gt;that are older than the story the film is weaving. The<br/>\n&gt;movie, which opens nationwide today, is most watchable<br/>\n&gt;during the majestic brutality of the battle sequences. This<br/>\n&gt;is not only because of the handsome staging, but also<br/>\n&gt;because the keywords sacrifice and honor are evoked with<br/>\n&gt;verve and simplicity, more so than in the &quot;exchange of<br/>\n&gt;idea&quot; chats between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like<br/>\n&gt;statements being read into the Congressional Record by<br/>\n&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mr. Zwick has absorbed the lethal agility of Akira<br/>\n&gt;Kurosawa; what registers just as powerfully as the sureness<br/>\n&gt;of the combatants is the ugly futility of the battles<br/>\n&gt;themselves. When the film sets up the lessons that Algren<br/>\n&gt;has to learn, the hero is not really a fish out of water;<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s more like a big fish in a dry pond, picking up a<br/>\n&gt;lesson in Eastern deportment and philosophy a step away<br/>\n&gt;from the &quot;wax-on, wax-off&quot; curriculum of &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;In those scenes presaging his Eastern conversion, Algren<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t suppress his eagerness to learn, picking up the ways<br/>\n&gt;of the sword and the Samurai code of Bushido with an<br/>\n&gt;alacrity that&#39;s mandated for movie stars: flash-card<br/>\n&gt;education.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The film&#39;s title evokes James Fenimore Cooper, though he<br/>\n&gt;had enough perspective not to make a white man &quot;the last&quot;<br/>\n&gt;in his novel.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-440711796\">Movie Review | &#39;The Last Samurai&#39;: From the Wild West to the Honorable East<br/>\n<br/>\nDecember 5, 2003<br/>\nBy ELVIS MITCHELL <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is probably no director more obsessed with the<br/>\ncomplexity of patriotism - an unusual subject to plumb in<br/>\nmainstream films - than Edward Zwick, who is driven to<br/>\nquestion the imperatives of an America that his<br/>\nprotagonists both love and detest. His latest movie, &quot;The<br/>\nLast Samurai,&quot; falls squarely into the realm of the<br/>\nprevious Zwick bedeviled-hero films, &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Courage<br/>\nUnder Fire&quot; and &quot;The Siege.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I do mean squarely. &quot;Samurai&quot; is a mythic western that<br/>\ncombines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in<br/>\nJapanese culture: John Ford&#39;s &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot; It<br/>\ndepicts phalanxes of troops moving with deliberate,<br/>\nterrifying fervor across the very wide screen. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this time Tom Cruise, the can-do idol of millions, uses<br/>\nhis polished-chrome smile mirthlessly. At least for the<br/>\nfirst hour, his grin looks like a faded tattoo. The uneven<br/>\n&quot;Samurai&quot; is a can-do movie that&#39;s far more effective at<br/>\ncommunicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more<br/>\nintimate ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a burned-out former Army<br/>\nofficer and Indian fighter. Having survived Custer&#39;s Last<br/>\nStand in 1876, he is now a commercial sideshow prop,<br/>\ndemonstrating the newest Winchester rifle. As Algren<br/>\nlumbers through the clich�s he&#39;s hired to recite before<br/>\nblasting away at targets - though the whiskey oozing from<br/>\nhis pores probably makes him more of a danger than the<br/>\nweapon - a sudden ember of regret flames in this<br/>\nex-soldier&#39;s eyes. He goes off the script, reciting the<br/>\nhorrors of a campaign in which he and his troops<br/>\nslaughtered innocents. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlgren looks so wasted and beleaguered that the biggest<br/>\nquestion is not whether he&#39;ll wing an audience member with<br/>\na stray shot, but whether he can bear up under the dense,<br/>\ncast-iron plot. After being bounced by the Winchester<br/>\nfolks, Algren is hired by his former commander, Colonel<br/>\nBagley (Tony Goldwyn, playing a salamanderlike ancestor of<br/>\nall the sleazy characters he&#39;s ever portrayed). Bagley<br/>\nwants Algren to travel with him to Tokyo and train Japanese<br/>\nsoldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles. The<br/>\nMeiji emperor is ready to accept the ways of the West; he&#39;s<br/>\nactually being pressured to by American business interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in Japan, Algren is forced to send his nervous,<br/>\nunderprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against<br/>\nan enemy of the emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken<br/>\nWatanabe). Despite the imperial army&#39;s modern weapons,<br/>\nKatsumoto and his men sweep in with ferocity and wield<br/>\ntheir arms of the past - swords and spears - with lethal<br/>\neffectiveness. The cinematographer, John Toll, films their<br/>\narrival through a thick fog in a forest, as if Katsumoto&#39;s<br/>\nmen were ghosts from the recent past out to rob Algren&#39;s<br/>\ntroops of their backbones - and their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn their ritual armor, Katsumoto&#39;s men make quick work of<br/>\ntheir foes; there&#39;s tragicomic relief as Algren&#39;s<br/>\nconscripted farmers tremble while trying to load their<br/>\nguns. When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto&#39;s second in<br/>\ncommand, he&#39;s captured by the invaders and, even more<br/>\nbewildering, cared for by Katsumoto&#39;s sister, Taka<br/>\n(Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren murdered. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a complicated story, and Mr. Zwick is complicated,<br/>\ntoo: he loves arrogance slapped out of its self-regard.<br/>\nAlgren is full of himself, even though he&#39;s conceived as a<br/>\nman who was second tenor to a legend; he knew and despised<br/>\nCuster. Looking fashionably distressed, with slightly<br/>\npuffy, red-rimmed eyes that at the very least suggest that<br/>\nhe&#39;s survived a grueling press junket, Mr. Cruise has a<br/>\nworn cockiness. His aw-shucks virility is a little wilted,<br/>\nif not mildewed, around the edges: a kind of reverse<br/>\nnarcissism, since Algren is proud of his dissolution<br/>\n(though Mr. Cruise&#39;s good-boy posture works for a man<br/>\nreared under the disciplinary rigors of the military). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough at times Mr. Cruise comes off as too contemporary<br/>\nfor the 19th century - at one point, he seems to be waiting<br/>\nfor a cellphone call to confirm his terms for a cover of<br/>\nDetails magazine - this displacement fits better when he<br/>\nbecomes a prisoner. Algren appears to be reacting to this<br/>\nstrange new world through sounds; nothing he&#39;s hearing<br/>\nmakes any sense to him. He&#39;s a mangy gaijin that Edgar Rice<br/>\nBurroughs might have invented, though James Clavell got<br/>\nthere eventually. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe film includes notable performances by actors not<br/>\ndrafted to shoulder the burden of the entire production.<br/>\nBilly Connolly, emanating a gamy, sly menace that he&#39;s<br/>\nrarely suggested before, plays Algren&#39;s former sergeant at<br/>\narms, Zebulon Gant. Gant, used to propping up his old<br/>\nfriend and superior officer, joins Algren in the journey to<br/>\nJapan. Mr. Connolly&#39;s loose, hostile vivacity registers so<br/>\nclearly that it&#39;s obvious we won&#39;t be seeing very much of<br/>\nhim. But this is crackling, rigorous comic work; he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to present the face of tragedy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe far more weighted and daring acting comes from Mr.<br/>\nWatanabe, as Katsumoto. Probably best known outside of<br/>\nJapan as the reedy, restless sidekick in the gourmand<br/>\nclassic &quot;Tampopo,&quot; Mr. Watanabe has filled out physically<br/>\nand spiritually. The formality he brings to Katsumoto is<br/>\nhard-won, especially when he&#39;s having pointedly thoughtful<br/>\nconversations with Algren that sound more like translations<br/>\nof ideograms than actual dialogue. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe film never really explains how or why this resolute,<br/>\nisolated samurai learned to speak English better than the<br/>\nemperor. His fluency doesn&#39;t quite make sense, though it<br/>\ngives the movie some needed mystique. It plays better than<br/>\nthe inexorable pull of romance, drawing Taka and Algren<br/>\ntogether. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; which Mr. Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz<br/>\nwrote with John Logan, from a story by Mr. Logan,<br/>\nsuper-glues together a host of contradictions.<br/>\nUnfortunately, as dramatized, they function as conventions<br/>\nthat are older than the story the film is weaving. The<br/>\nmovie, which opens nationwide today, is most watchable<br/>\nduring the majestic brutality of the battle sequences. This<br/>\nis not only because of the handsome staging, but also<br/>\nbecause the keywords sacrifice and honor are evoked with<br/>\nverve and simplicity, more so than in the &quot;exchange of<br/>\nidea&quot; chats between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like<br/>\nstatements being read into the Congressional Record by<br/>\nNathaniel Hawthorne. <br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Zwick has absorbed the lethal agility of Akira<br/>\nKurosawa; what registers just as powerfully as the sureness<br/>\nof the combatants is the ugly futility of the battles<br/>\nthemselves. When the film sets up the lessons that Algren<br/>\nhas to learn, the hero is not really a fish out of water;<br/>\nhe&#39;s more like a big fish in a dry pond, picking up a<br/>\nlesson in Eastern deportment and philosophy a step away<br/>\nfrom the &quot;wax-on, wax-off&quot; curriculum of &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot;<br/>\nIn those scenes presaging his Eastern conversion, Algren<br/>\ncan&#39;t suppress his eagerness to learn, picking up the ways<br/>\nof the sword and the Samurai code of Bushido with an<br/>\nalacrity that&#39;s mandated for movie stars: flash-card<br/>\neducation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe film&#39;s title evokes James Fenimore Cooper, though he<br/>\nhad enough perspective not to make a white man &quot;the last&quot;<br/>\nin his novel. Even though &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; opts for<br/>\nJapan&#39;s cultural differences, all of the unmentioned<br/>\nhardships of a feudal society notwithstanding, the<br/>\nremaining honorable native here is an American. Is that a<br/>\nveiled way of saying that Japan&#39;s old ways were doomed<br/>\nafter all? <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is rated R (Under 17 requires<br/>\naccompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence,<br/>\nincluding enough ritualistic bloodletting for a week on the<br/>\nHistory Channel; alcohol use; strong language; and a chaste<br/>\nhint of sexuality. <br/>\n<br/>\nTHE LAST SAMURAI <br/>\n<br/>\nDirected by Edward Zwick; written by John Logan, Marshall<br/>\nHerskovitz and Mr. Zwick, based on a story by Mr. Logan;<br/>\ndirector of photography, John Toll; edited by Steven<br/>\nRosenblum and Victor du Bois; music by Hans Zimmer;<br/>\nproduction designer, Lilly Kilvert; produced by Mr. Zwick,<br/>\nMr. Herskovitz, Tom Cruise, Paula Wagner, Scott Kroopf and<br/>\nTom Engelman; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.
