Mori Motonari won an impressive <br/>\nvictory over them, one of his earliest victories.  They seem to have <br/>\nfallen off the map after that:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Motonari was born Shojumaru, the second son of M�ri Hiromoto, a <br/>\ndaimyo who struggled against the local Takeda clan (not to be <br/>\nconfused with the Kai branch of that family) and the encroaching <br/>\nO�chi. In 1499, Hiromoto found himself in the path of a looming <br/>\nAmako invasion from Izumo, and allied with O�chi. At the time, O�chi <br/>\nYoshioki was becoming involved in the gunboat politics of Kyoto and <br/>\nwhile he was away, the Amako grew stronger. In 1506 Hiromoto died, <br/>\nand was succeded by his eldest son, Okimoto, who ended up assisting <br/>\nYoshioki in Kyoto for a short period. It happened that he died in <br/>\n1516, and Motonari was named to act as guardian to the late lord&#39;s <br/>\nyoung son, Komatsumaru. Komatsumaru in turn was to die in 1523, after <br/>\nwhich Motonari became the official head of he clan. Evidently, <br/>\nM�ri&#39;s predecessors had died under unclear circumstances, for there <br/>\nis a legend that it was Motonari himself who dispatched them. At any <br/>\nrate, Motonari did not inherit a particularly enviable position. The <br/>\nmost powerful daimyo in Aki, Takeda Motoshige, took advantage of <br/>\nOkimoto&#39;s death to make a play for M�ri land, and in Izumo the Amako <br/>\nbegan to rattle their sabers. Luckily for the M�ri, however, their <br/>\nyoung lord quickly proved himself a man of action. Takeda had set out <br/>\nto take Koriyama Castle (the M�ri&#39;s chief bastion since the early <br/>\n14th Century) but found his troops intercepted and routed by the <br/>\nnumerically inferior M�ri clan. This victory carried a certain <br/>\nprestige value for Motonari, but was quickly over-shadowed by greater <br/>\nevents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Nate Ledbetter <br/>\n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re playing too much Shogun: Total War. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Takeda were a Shugo family under the Ashikaga<br/>\n&gt; Shogunate.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1215975277\">Actually, there was a Takeda clan of a different branch than the Kai <br/>\nTakeda there into the 16th century.  Mori Motonari won an impressive <br/>\nvictory over them, one of his earliest victories.  They seem to have <br/>\nfallen off the map after that:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Motonari was born Shojumaru, the second son of Môri Hiromoto, a <br/>\ndaimyo who struggled against the local Takeda clan (not to be <br/>\nconfused with the Kai branch of that family) and the encroaching <br/>\nOûchi. In 1499, Hiromoto found himself in the path of a looming <br/>\nAmako invasion from Izumo, and allied with Oûchi. At the time, Oûchi <br/>\nYoshioki was becoming involved in the gunboat politics of Kyoto and <br/>\nwhile he was away, the Amako grew stronger. In 1506 Hiromoto died, <br/>\nand was succeded by his eldest son, Okimoto, who ended up assisting <br/>\nYoshioki in Kyoto for a short period. It happened that he died in <br/>\n1516, and Motonari was named to act as guardian to the late lord&#39;s <br/>\nyoung son, Komatsumaru. Komatsumaru in turn was to die in 1523, after <br/>\nwhich Motonari became the official head of he clan. Evidently, <br/>\nMôri&#39;s predecessors had died under unclear circumstances, for there <br/>\nis a legend that it was Motonari himself who dispatched them. At any <br/>\nrate, Motonari did not inherit a particularly enviable position. The <br/>\nmost powerful daimyo in Aki, Takeda Motoshige, took advantage of <br/>\nOkimoto&#39;s death to make a play for Môri land, and in Izumo the Amako <br/>\nbegan to rattle their sabers. Luckily for the Môri, however, their <br/>\nyoung lord quickly proved himself a man of action. Takeda had set out <br/>\nto take Koriyama Castle (the Môri&#39;s chief bastion since the early <br/>\n14th Century) but found his troops intercepted and routed by the <br/>\nnumerically inferior Môri clan. This victory carried a certain <br/>\nprestige value for Motonari, but was quickly over-shadowed by greater <br/>\nevents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Nate Ledbetter <br/>\n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re playing too much Shogun: Total War. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Takeda were a Shugo family under the Ashikaga<br/>\n&gt; Shogunate.
