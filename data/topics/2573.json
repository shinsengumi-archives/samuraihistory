I <br/>\nbelieve that with the interest at hand,  we can consider this the founding of a <br/>\nsubgroup specifically on Japanese Arms and Armour.   Since there is so much in <br/>\nmuseums on these subjects,  like the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the <br/>\nVictoria and Albert Museum in London,  I think we have a precedent here.  <br/>\nSpeaking of armor, you  can&#39;t beat the two books by H.  Russell Robinson,  <br/>\nOriental Armor and   Japanese Arms and Armor.  They have stood the passage of time as <br/>\n splendid chronicles of the Age of the Country at War.  Japanese Arms and <br/>\nArmor is--of and in itself--a work of art!  I extend a courteous invitation to <br/>\nTom Helm and to Donovan to bring their research to the attention of the group.  <br/>\nAnd as Tom Bodett said about Motel 6,  &quot;we&#39;ll leave the light on for ya.&quot;  <br/>\nLater and greater,   Jack Murphy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
