Jack<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Speaking as one who&#39;s worn both types of armour, I can see little difference <br/>\nwhen it comes to the armpit. Both European and Japanese were exposed there, so <br/>\nboth had alternate methods of dealing with it; the Japanese had the manjuwa or <br/>\nwakibiki worn under the armour, and the Europeans had arming doublets with <br/>\nintegral mail gussets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assure you: if articulation is important, you can&#39;t articulate better than a <br/>\ncloth foundation. The difference is the amount of *solid* protection on the <br/>\nsleeves. European were solid, with upper and lower canons and articulated elbow <br/>\ncops, while the Japanese didn&#39;t provide the same amount of solid protection. <br/>\nIt&#39;s an exchange: the Japanese as a rule was looser and provided a far greater <br/>\nrange of motion, while the European was more protective and in all but the <br/>\nhighest quality suits a slightly restricted range of motion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere I fighting Europeans, I&#39;d prefer their armour; but fighting the Japanese, <br/>\nI&#39;d prefer *theirs*. They were each admirably suited to the milieu in which they <br/>\nwere used.<br/>\n<br/>\n(But, yeah, Augsburg armourers made *damn* nice looking stuff!)<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1616029574\">While I hold no brief as an expert in armour,  offhand it seems that the <br/>\narmourers of Western Europe were much more concerned with the articulation of <br/>\ntheir armor than those in Japan.  Whether Gothic or Maximilian,  German or Italian <br/>\nor French, the armourers seemed to take more care in what we would call the <br/>\nergonomics of armor than did their contemporaries in Japan.  If one studies <br/>\nmerely the arm defenses of both knight and samurai...not getting into the <br/>\ntechnical terms French or Japanese..it seems apparent (at least to me)  that there <br/>\nwas more technical sophistication, including armpit armor,  in the armor shops <br/>\nof Augsburg than in Sakai.  Of course, the question arises also did Japan have <br/>\nthe mineral resources to produce all the steel armor  that Europe had?
