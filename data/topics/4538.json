A few things had changed in the meantime, just <br/>\ncheck out two maps of Europe from 1924 and 1941, for example... Do you <br/>\nthink hitler was the same person with the same agenda?? And do you <br/>\nthink he had the same amount of power and the same number of neurons??<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hitler mentioned in his mein kamph that no matter the race, an certain<br/>\n&gt; people can be &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; deppending on their cultural <br/>\n&gt; background. He<br/>\n&gt; also said &quot;the first step to destroy a nation, is to destroy its <br/>\n&gt; culture&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He fought non christians<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like... he was Christian?<br/>\nPerhaps vegetarian, but Christian I don&#39;t think so...<br/>\nAhem: &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; ???<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in general at Germany, Jews, homosexuals, people<br/>\n&gt; who was freethinkers and didn´t supported the Nazi Regime (they was <br/>\n&gt; sent to<br/>\n&gt; concentration camps despite if they was &quot;pure race&quot;-dogs with pedigree <br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; not). So, more than racial, it was even more about an ideological<br/>\n&gt; absolutism.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In this way, he was very alike Nobunaga, Oda.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, but two very different kind of absolutisms, pointing different <br/>\ngoals, in different centuries, in different centuries, blah... blah... <br/>\nblah... you can&#39;t say two individuals are the same just because they&#39;re <br/>\nboth absolutists.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Hitler killed jews not due to racist motivations<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; only, but also religious,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Question 1: I do not understand what you meant by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &#39;religious&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; Octavio: Means: NO CHRISTIAN! Although the precedent catholic <br/>\n&gt; concentration<br/>\n&gt; camps at Yugoslavia killed not only jews, non christians, homosexuals <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; people who though differently of the interests of the Rebel Catholic<br/>\n&gt; Ustashi, they also killed protestants, lutherans, catholic orthodox as <br/>\n&gt; well,<br/>\n&gt; Germany under Adolph Hitler, killed just no christians. Other <br/>\n&gt; denominations<br/>\n&gt; of christianity was more safer than it was in Yugoslavia. Religion is <br/>\n&gt; also a<br/>\n&gt; set of morals and ideas, not only simple an belief system. If he was an<br/>\n&gt; absolutist, he fough also, what he considered inconvenient religions <br/>\n&gt; for his<br/>\n&gt; purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once again, I really believe he killed most people for economic reasons <br/>\nand because he was a madman. Nobunaga was no madman. He was a ruthless <br/>\nwarrior, who killed a lot of people, but with a clearly defined goal in <br/>\nhis mind, a goal that MANY in Japan today still consider the greater <br/>\ngood: unification of the country, before Japan was unified as a colony <br/>\nunder China or a Western power...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; And... Although this is offtopic, Cesar, you may<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; criticise my History View<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Points as much as ye want, but was not any<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; non-christian religion who always<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was conspiring to change history logs, doing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; adulteration and falsification<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; on the documents, such as what whas done with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; certain doccuments by Taccitus<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and others to &quot;prove&quot; that Jesus existed. As well,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to accuse several others<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; religions (including judaism) of &quot;human sacrifice&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and all the same rant as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aways.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The japanese remember very well their history.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks to Tokugawa again.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Question 2: Do you mean that the Japanese remember<br/>\n&gt;&gt; well that Nobunaga = Hitler? Is this how many Japanese<br/>\n&gt;&gt; historians interpret the historical postion of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Nobunaga and teach young Japanese students in their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; history classes?<br/>\n&gt; Octavio: I mean exactly what I mean. You added meaning to my stated <br/>\n&gt; phrases.<br/>\n&gt; Japanese people does not taunt, at least at the time I learn japanese<br/>\n&gt; history, things like &quot;loosers was the evil&quot; and &quot;winners was the <br/>\n&gt; good&quot;, but<br/>\n&gt; just telling the facts. They also din´t put in their history books that<br/>\n&gt; Shinto do human sacrifices, and buddhists do the same as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your sources for this, please?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But if<br/>\n&gt; christianity would take over Japan as it happened with my country, and<br/>\n&gt; several scandinavian ones, Shinto and Buddhism would be despicted in <br/>\n&gt; history<br/>\n&gt; books as &quot;absolute EVIL&quot;. That was my point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, your theory is: both Hitler and Nobunaga killed non-christisns, so <br/>\nthey&#39;re the same?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; And although I am not a communist...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;the people who don´t know their true history<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; deeply, are fated to repeat it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in circles&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mao Tse Tung<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Question 3: How is this quotation of Mao related to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; your argument?<br/>\n&gt; Octavio: Think better, and you will realize what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>More than that I&#39;d need some Asahi Dry, I believe...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Don´t go around spreading<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that I am telling lies.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Stand up and PROVE I am wrong.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The History of the Church<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is full of conspirations of ambition and power&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Goetche<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Question 4: How does this quotation PROVE that you did<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not lie when you said that the Japanese parents quote<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Nobunaga to scare their children?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Octavio: I saw it with my own eyes when at Japan 14 years ago, and also<br/>\n&gt; mentioned in some mangas as well at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry, but the stories and you&#39;ve heard and the manga you&#39;ve read do <br/>\nnot make very impressive historical sources. My wife is Japanese, and <br/>\nshe does not tell Nobunaga stories to our kid (actually she likes him a <br/>\nlot-so eventually would be positive stories.) So, we&#39;re 1-1, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can you prove the contrary? I<br/>\n&gt; don´t care if you do not believe me, or even if you believe as well. I <br/>\n&gt; am<br/>\n&gt; not a preacher. My life´s meaning will not end if you don´t believe me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do believe you&#39;re sincere, but we&#39;re talking history here, non <br/>\nopinions based (it seems) upon fragmentary sources.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Those who want know the truth, not only about what I stated, but about <br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; subject, must just not simply believe in what me or other people <br/>\n&gt; affirmed,<br/>\n&gt; or skeptically disbelieve, but do their own research in all the <br/>\n&gt; sources they<br/>\n&gt; can access. Including public libraries and internet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I am a graduate student in Japanese history, and I teach World <br/>\nHistory. The professor I study with is one of the best in the world in <br/>\ntraditional Japan history.<br/>\nI believe by now I know a bit about how to manage sources.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For an example... Who cares if you didn´t believe in what I stated <br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; Buddhism history in Japan and their co-relaction with Samurai?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What, where, when?? The sacrifices...?? I am lost again...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The sources,<br/>\n&gt; like Kalama Sutta, shingon-tendai references are available even in <br/>\n&gt; english<br/>\n&gt; nowaddays. And if one want study the tripitaka, one can become a monk, <br/>\n&gt; learn<br/>\n&gt; Pali and spend a life reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pali is an old Indian language, the vulgar version of Sanskrit. What <br/>\nhas this to do with what we were talking about???!?!?!??!??!?! Do I <br/>\nneed more Asahi Dry????<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In fact, is what even Buddha recomended to<br/>\n&gt; do in Kalama Sutra. Don´t believe me, go and read it. he he he<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow. I&#39;d wish you can stick to the point, and make things clearer.<br/>\nDo you have a greater theory?<br/>\nI am still not clear on Nobunaga & Hitler, let alone the sacrifices....<br/>\ncepo</div>",
