It has a bit too much <br/>\nof the one true way for me to feel comfortable with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote from JKA site &quot;Bushido: The Way of the Samurai /Bushido/ has been <br/>\nthe samurai code of conduct in Japan for centuries. Based firmly on the <br/>\nteachings of Zen, /Bushido/ was intended to help the samurai master <br/>\ntheir nature and understand their minds and the universe through direct <br/>\nexperienceâ€”as well as through fostering strength, self-control and wisdom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Bushido really based on Zen? Or is it just a nasty perversion created <br/>\nto justify brutality and the abdication of personal responsibility? Zen <br/>\ncovers a wide range even in Japan, not counting some of the Chinese <br/>\nversions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     Because of recent e-mails about the relationship between Bushido and Karate, I have decided to write an essay on this subject, using evidence from JKA masters as well as extracts from respected books. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Looking forward to it, I will read it if you write it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This is my final attempt to prove to you all there is such a strong link between the 2. I hope you all will then decide to do your own research to compliment this essay. Thank you very much.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jim Eckman</div>",
