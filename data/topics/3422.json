I think if you will follow the discussion of <br/>\njust what is a samurai and what has become of the samurai class going <br/>\non now in other threads here many of your questions will be answered. <br/>\nThere are no true samurai left, there are many descendants of samurai <br/>\nstill around and many good tales from the period before the samurai <br/>\nclass was abolished. Unfortunately there is no one left alive from that <br/>\nperiod, for most people alive today they would have been their Great <br/>\nGreat Grandparents.<br/>\n\tSince you work in Radio and need a live body for your work I would <br/>\nsuggest looking for a Kendo or Iaido dojo in your area. Look for <br/>\nJapanese instructors or students born before the war and approach them <br/>\nfor an interview. Were we in Japan, I could introduce you to many <br/>\ninteresting characters but alas I am no longer there. Not having met <br/>\nyou myself I wouldn&#39;t feel right sending you to my friends homes and <br/>\nnot be present myself. I am sure you can find persons of interest right <br/>\nthere in Singapore...<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm</a></div>",
