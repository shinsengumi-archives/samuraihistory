Always when certain portions of <br/>\n&gt;&gt; his ideal map are in the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; hands of germans, other portions was independent. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Some would say that he did <br/>\n&gt;&gt; attempted to do with the entire world what the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; bastard of Nobunaga attempted <br/>\n&gt;&gt; with Japan. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Comment: I do not agree. Hitler identified the cause <br/>\n&gt;of the defeat of the previous German Empire as the <br/>\n&gt;racial impurity, which he generalized into a larger <br/>\n&gt;sphere of historical context. <br/>\n&gt;In essence, in his book, &#39;Mein Kampf&#39;, he claimed that <br/>\n&gt;in order for an empire to last, it was necessary to <br/>\n&gt;eliminate the racial impurity, the mass bulk of which <br/>\n&gt;he also associated with Jews. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;As a practical realization of his &#39;theoretical&#39; <br/>\n&gt;reasoning, he devised a systematic mass execution, <br/>\n&gt;which his followers &#39;efficiently&#39; implemented. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;His ideal map of German nation, which I also believe <br/>\n&gt;was on Hitler&#39;s mind, therefore was not the cause of <br/>\n&gt;his &#39;mass&#39; execuation in a strict sense whereas as for <br/>\n&gt;Nobunaga, the reunification itself was the primary <br/>\n&gt;cause of the execution. The expansive warfare <br/>\n&gt;motivated by his ideal territory can be quoted at most <br/>\n&gt;as the secondary cause of the mass exectution. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Although it may be apparently a race issue, notes on his mein kamph proves <br/>\nwrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nHitler mentioned in his mein kamph that no matter the race, an certain <br/>\npeople can be &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; deppending on their cultural background. He <br/>\nalso said &quot;the first step to destroy a nation, is to destroy its culture&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe fought non christians in general at Germany, Jews, homosexuals, people <br/>\nwho was freethinkers and didn�t supported the Nazi Regime (they was sent to <br/>\nconcentration camps despite if they was &quot;pure race&quot;-dogs with pedigree or <br/>\nnot). So, more than racial, it was even more about an ideological <br/>\nabsolutism. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this way, he was very alike Nobunaga, Oda. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Hitler killed jews not due to racist motivations <br/>\n&gt;&gt; only, but also religious, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Question 1: I do not understand what you meant by <br/>\n&gt;&#39;religious&#39;. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Octavio: Means: NO CHRISTIAN! Although the precedent catholic concentration <br/>\ncamps at Yugoslavia killed not only jews, non christians, homosexuals and <br/>\npeople who though differently of the interests of the Rebel Catholic <br/>\nUstashi, they also killed protestants, lutherans, catholic orthodox as well, <br/>\nGermany under Adolph Hitler, killed just no christians. Other denominations <br/>\nof christianity was more safer than it was in Yugoslavia. Religion is also a <br/>\nset of morals and ideas, not only simple an belief system. If he was an <br/>\nabsolutist, he fough also, what he considered inconvenient religions for his <br/>\npurposes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; And... Although this is offtopic, Cesar, you may <br/>\n&gt;&gt; criticise my History View <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Points as much as ye want, but was not any <br/>\n&gt;&gt; non-christian religion who always <br/>\n&gt;&gt; was conspiring to change history logs, doing <br/>\n&gt;&gt; adulteration and falsification <br/>\n&gt;&gt; on the documents, such as what whas done with <br/>\n&gt;&gt; certain doccuments by Taccitus <br/>\n&gt;&gt; and others to &quot;prove&quot; that Jesus existed. As well, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; to accuse several others <br/>\n&gt;&gt; religions (including judaism) of &quot;human sacrifice&quot; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; and all the same rant as <br/>\n&gt;&gt; aways. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The japanese remember very well their history. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Thanks to Tokugawa again. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Question 2: Do you mean that the Japanese remember <br/>\n&gt;well that Nobunaga = Hitler? Is this how many Japanese <br/>\n&gt;historians interpret the historical postion of <br/>\n&gt;Nobunaga and teach young Japanese students in their <br/>\n&gt;history classes? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Octavio: I mean exactly what I mean. You added meaning to my stated phrases. <br/>\nJapanese people does not taunt, at least at the time I learn japanese <br/>\nhistory, things like &quot;loosers was the evil&quot; and &quot;winners was the good&quot;, but <br/>\njust telling the facts. They also din�t put in their history books that <br/>\nShinto do human sacrifices, and buddhists do the same as well. But if <br/>\nchristianity would take over Japan as it happened with my country, and <br/>\nseveral scandinavian ones, Shinto and Buddhism would be despicted in history <br/>\nbooks as &quot;absolute EVIL&quot;. That was my point. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; And although I am not a communist... <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;the people who don�t know their true history <br/>\n&gt;&gt; deeply, are fated to repeat it <br/>\n&gt;&gt; in circles&quot; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mao Tse Tung <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Question 3: How is this quotation of Mao related to <br/>\n&gt;your argument? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Octavio: Think better, and you will realize what I mean. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Don�t go around spreading <br/>\n&gt;&gt; that I am telling lies. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Stand up and PROVE I am wrong. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The History of the Church <br/>\n&gt;&gt; is full of conspirations of ambition and power&quot; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Goetche <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Question 4: How does this quotation PROVE that you did <br/>\n&gt;not lie when you said that the Japanese parents quote <br/>\n&gt;Nobunaga to scare their children? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Octavio: I saw it with my own eyes when at Japan 14 years ago, and also <br/>\nmentioned in some mangas as well at that time. Can you prove the contrary? I <br/>\ndon�t care if you do not believe me, or even if you believe as well. I am <br/>\nnot a preacher. My life�s meaning will not end if you don�t believe me. <br/>\nThose who want know the truth, not only about what I stated, but about every <br/>\nsubject, must just not simply believe in what me or other people affirmed, <br/>\nor skeptically disbelieve, but do their own research in all the sources they <br/>\ncan access. Including public libraries and internet. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor an example... Who cares if you didn�t believe in what I stated about <br/>\nBuddhism history in Japan and their co-relaction with Samurai? The sources, <br/>\nlike Kalama Sutta, shingon-tendai references are available even in english <br/>\nnowaddays. And if one want study the tripitaka, one can become a monk, learn <br/>\nPali and spend a life reading it. In fact, is what even Buddha recomended to <br/>\ndo in Kalama Sutra.

All small portions of Japan was small countries with their <br/>\nindependence and own emperator as well. <br/>\nThe first one who dreamt to have one nation and perhaps one world (for these <br/>\npeople, Japan was the entire world) was the Emperator Yamato, that unlike <br/>\nNobunaga, had peaceful goals and intentions in his heart. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo quote him (Yamato Emperor, NOT Nobunaga) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;On the earth there ins�t earth portions marked with lines and different <br/>\ncolours like a map.

Hitler killed 5.7 million people simply because they <br/>\n&gt;belonged to a race, or because he considered them inferiors. They were <br/>\n&gt;not people on his path, he sent out over half of Europe his Gestapo and <br/>\n&gt;special extermination squads to get them, and to murder them. Hitler&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;&quot;final solution,&quot; the ultimate decision of killing ALL Jewish, is <br/>\n&gt;something you can not compare with Nobunaga&#39;s will to unify Japan at <br/>\n&gt;all costs. Nobunaga did not build concentration camps where thousands <br/>\n&gt;of people were killed every day after they were exploited as slaves. <br/>\n&gt;And besides that, Nobunaga was born in the middle of a civil war, while <br/>\n&gt;Hitler started a World War... How can you compare them? Hitler lived <br/>\n&gt;400 years later than Nobunaga, in a different continent, and in a <br/>\n&gt;totally different contest. <br/>\n&gt;Sure, you can speculate that, given the chance, Nobunaga would have <br/>\n&gt;done as bad as Hitler, but... ***speculate*** that&#39;s it. <br/>\n&gt;History is a different matter.
