So there is really no answer to your question. <br/>\nIf your question is why did the Samurai government of the Tokugawa <br/>\nfail, then the answers are there but not easy to elucidate.<br/>\n\tBushi households had their income tied to rice production on lands <br/>\nalotted to them by the bakufu. Once peace was established these incomes <br/>\nwere set and most positions within the government became hereditary. <br/>\nEssentially freezing political and economic conditions at their 1620&#39;s <br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n\tWith each generation the population grew, but rice production did not, <br/>\nso Bushi families had to make ends meet for larger and larger <br/>\nhouseholds on a salary that did not increase at anywhere near the same <br/>\nrate. Heavy taxation, flood and famine placed onerous burdens upon the <br/>\nfarmer who began to rebel more often. Bushi houses and the government <br/>\nborrowed heavily, increasing the power and prestige of the merchant <br/>\nclass, while draining national coffers.<br/>\n\tThe policy of isolationism, handicapped efforts to modernize the <br/>\nmilitary and political power of the Shoguns. The threat of European <br/>\nintervention in Japan, laid plain all the weaknesses of the Tokugawa <br/>\nsystem. There were only three choices left; War with the Great Powers <br/>\nand colonization, rapid and dramatic reform of the existing government <br/>\nor revolution. The second was undertaken too late, bringing about the <br/>\nthird which we know as the Meiji Restoration...<br/>\n-t</div>",
