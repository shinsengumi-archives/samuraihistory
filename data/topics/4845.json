            "msgSnippet": "... American kiddie excuse for Japanese cultural stuff. A couple of notes on this dialogue - first (to be fair), the original TMNT was a loving one-shot",
            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2052627716\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&quot;the fake Japanese weapons used by cartoon turtles in a badly researched<br/>\n </span></blockquote>American kiddie excuse for Japanese cultural stuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA couple of notes on this dialogue - first (to be fair), the original TMNT<br/>\nwas a loving one-shot satire of Frank Miller&#39;s Daredevil comic, heavily<br/>\ninfluenced in turn by Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub).  What grew out of<br/>\nthat single-issue in-joke can be seen as a kind of huge marketing joke in<br/>\nand of itself, but as a satire of American youth and media fads (i.e. the<br/>\nmartial arts film craze, teen teams in comics, funny animal comics, anime<br/>\nand manga influence, etc.), the original was pretty amusing.  Not great<br/>\nliterature; certainly not on a par with Kozure Okami, as far as graphic<br/>\nstorytelling goes; but amusing all the same.<br/>\nThat aside, this comment sounds like something I&#39;d say.  That&#39;s some quality<br/>\nranting there.  (And I do mean that as a compliment.)<br/>\nOn a more serious note:<br/>\nMessage: 4<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 15 Jul 2004 03:39:11 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;zevlord&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LordZev@...\">LordZev@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Weapons of Ninjas<br/>\n<br/>\n(snip)  ... they are not Ninja weapons, in actual fact they were<br/>\noriginally farming implements that was used to plant seeds. Now I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know when but they got extended for battle and instead of<br/>\ncarrying two they actually carried THREE one in each hand and one<br/>\ntucked into their belt. When entering battle they would run towards<br/>\nthere enemies throwing one of the sai&#39;s  at the enemy then drew the<br/>\nthird one ready for combat. (snip)<br/>\n\tThis comment about the agricultural derivation of the sai is one I&#39;ve heard<br/>\nbefore.  And back in the &#39;70s, I remember my teacher telling me about the<br/>\npractise of carrying a third sai for throwing (Draeger & Smith&#39;s<br/>\n_Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts_ also corroborates this.).  But I have<br/>\nalso heard (and this seems more credible to me) that the sai were originally<br/>\nOkinawan hay-hooks, that the worker would stick one sai into each end of a<br/>\n(small) bale and walk away with these as handles.  In terms of design, they<br/>\nseem better suited to this than to planting, as the side tines would serve<br/>\nto stabilise the bale, while I can&#39;t think what use they are in planting.<br/>\nAnyone have any sources to cite on this question?  Oral tradition on this<br/>\ncontinent is something I have learned to regard with great suspicion, as<br/>\nI&#39;ve found plenty of bad information being passed along in good faith by<br/>\nfolks who honestly believed what they were saying.  So Zev, please don&#39;t<br/>\ntake this as a challenge of your integrity, as that&#39;s not my intention at<br/>\nall.  But I would like to nail down the facts if I can.<br/>\n\tApparently (according to Draeger & Smith again) a weapon of this design has<br/>\nbeen in use under various names for over 1500 years, everywhere from India<br/>\nto Okinawa, and observes, &quot;Evidence exists which favours Indonesia as the<br/>\nplace of origin.  ...Ancient Indonesian civilizations on Sumatra and Java,<br/>\nwhich had contact with Okinawa, used the weapon in their combat systems.&quot;<br/>\nIf this is so (and Draeger tends to be reliable), then it may never have had<br/>\nan agricultural application at all:  any stories of that sort could<br/>\nconceivably have been &#39;cover stories&#39; devised during such times as the<br/>\ncarrying of weapons was illegal.  (&quot;This, officer?  Nah, this ain&#39;t a<br/>\nweapon.  This is a, uh, hay hook.  Yeah, a hay hook.  Got a couple of &#39;em.<br/>\nAnd, um a spare.  In case one gets, y&#39;know, broken.  Or something.&quot;)  This<br/>\nis pure speculation on my part, so I&#39;d be very interested in more solid<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n\tDraeger & Smith also note that the weapon &quot;never became popular in Japan<br/>\nand is almost completely divorced from Japanese combat systems; it is only<br/>\nseen in those karate systems that have an Okinawan tradition.&quot;  So as far as<br/>\nthe ninja and sai go, I guess we do have to blame those pesky adolescent<br/>\nterrapins.  And that, in turn, goes back to Frank Miller putting sai in the<br/>\nhands of Daredevil&#39;s girlfriend Elektra... although her fingers were always<br/>\npositioned wrong... which may take us back to that &#39;badly researched<br/>\nAmerican excuse&#39; business again.  Come to think of it, he could never draw<br/>\nthe tip of a katana right either.<br/>\n\tAdmittedly, kobujutsu is a bit of a digression from samurai history.  But<br/>\nas far as that goes, does anyone have any information on whether individual<br/>\nsamurai are likely to have trained in any of the kobu weapons?<br/>\n\tGereg</div>",
