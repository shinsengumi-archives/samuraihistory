If you want to compare<br/>\nyourself with say, Kenshin, limit your comparison<br/>\nbetween you and Kenshin.

But, I do<br/>\nmeet some loser who just makes me uncomfortable by<br/>\ntying his or her identity to that of America, saying<br/>\nthat I am a merely(?!) Korean... These losers have<br/>\nobviously have problem with his or her self-esteem,<br/>\nwhich I can not help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, when I see America, I think of John. F.
