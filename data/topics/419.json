By this I mean that in the <br/>\npast the tatto was used as one method in the &#39;five tortures&#39; to brand a <br/>\nperson who was convicted of a crime..The samurai themselves would not have <br/>\nbeen tattooed unless they had been inprisoned or marked by the authorities in <br/>\nthis way..i.e. if he was Ronin it would be a possibility that he was tattooed <br/>\nbut otherwise it would be incredibly unlikely and if he was then it would <br/>\ncertainly be hidden from sight.<br/>\n Tattooing is still viewed along these same lines in Japan today..although <br/>\nwith the &#39;westernization&#39; of Japans youth it is becoming more acceptable..The <br/>\nTattoo is often associated with the Yakuza clans and various &#39;disreputable&#39; <br/>\ntypes rather than the business classes and the same ideas were more in force <br/>\nduring the past in Japan.<br/>\n Hope this helps ya!<br/>\n Abayo.<br/>\n Ben.</div>",
