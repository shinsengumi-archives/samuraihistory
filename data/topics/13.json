Tell me<br/>\nmore about your project.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m helping a group of people set up a web site for a highly detailed low<br/>\nfantasy RPG called Harn not so loosely based on earth (its a fan site. and<br/>\nnot put out by the comp. that created Harn). Unfortunately only 3 of over 50<br/>\nsections of the world have been published. We&#39;ve chosen one called Shoju<br/>\n(Japan) to develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn doing some research I&#39;ve determined that Harns time line correlates with<br/>\nearth at about the 10th to 12th century AD( the Kamakura period) and Shoju<br/>\nis known for its major naval presence in the area of this world. So I&#39;ve<br/>\nstarted to look about for any sources with very little luck until now.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m looking for are types of ships, technology that might be different<br/>\nthat Europe at the time, or descriptions of the ships/boats ie. average<br/>\nlength/beam/depth/height or base # of masts or what is the gross burthen of<br/>\nsaid ship is etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nif some one has any pic&#39;s or art of ships of the time period to give me an<br/>\nidea of what working with. (I&#39;ll discard after my viewing them)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have very little to work with so if you can help please contact me<br/>\ndirectly at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbisaillon@...\">dbisaillon@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanx<br/>\n<br/>\nJoel Bisaillon</div>",
