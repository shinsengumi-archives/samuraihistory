            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1223462491\">Global Arizona: Author says Japan needs to rebuild on samurai <br/>\ntradition <br/>\n<br/>\nJan. 23, 2005 12:00 AM <br/>\n<br/>\nsuccess, samurai code<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBoye Lafayette De Mente&#39;sfirst book, on the etiquette and ethics of <br/>\ndoing business in Japan, is such a classic that it sold like crazy <br/>\nand is now in its sixth edition. <br/>\n<br/>\nForty-six years later, the Paradise Valley resident and Japan expert <br/>\nhas added to his string of books with The Japanese Samurai Code: <br/>\nClassic Strategies for Success,due out this spring from Boston-based <br/>\nTuttle Publishing Co. Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the new book, De Mente details nearly 40traits of the samurai <br/>\nthat he says have shaped present-day Japanese thinking and behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In my judgment, it was the influence of the samurai class over 800 <br/>\nyears that molded the common Japanese into what they are today,&quot; De <br/>\nMente said.<br/>\n<br/>\nForemost among the samurai traits, De Mente says, are perseverance, <br/>\ndiligence, obsession with detail and obsession with quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch traits were instilled early in samurai clans. Boys began sword <br/>\ntraining at age 7, and for the next eight years underwent extensive <br/>\nphysical and mental training before they could be recognized as <br/>\nsamurai. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest American parallel, De Mente says, might be the Navy <br/>\nSEALs or other specialized units in which young participants are <br/>\ntrained for years under extreme challenges and high expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nA samurai had to win to be able to survive, and the samurai class <br/>\nput that kind of intensity into its training of other Japanese, he <br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When you transfer that to business, it becomes a very powerful <br/>\nmotive for success,&quot; he said. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since the bubble burst on Japan&#39;s economy about 15 years ago, <br/>\nregaining the samurai spirit has been a common topic of discussion <br/>\nand concern there, De Mente said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The older Japanese recognize that if they lose more of the samurai <br/>\ncode, then Japan is in for trouble,&quot; he said. &quot;Without that <br/>\nattitude, they&#39;re just going to be another kid on the block.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven given the emergence of China and India, De Mente counts Japan <br/>\nas down but definitely not out of the economic picture. Japan is <br/>\nstill the world&#39;s second-largest economy, and it is very good at <br/>\nresearch and is making breakthroughs in vital areas such as biology <br/>\nand materials, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nJapan was Arizona&#39;s eight-largest market in 2003, taking $466 <br/>\nmillion in exports from the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nDe Mente graduated from Jochi University in Tokyo and lived in Japan <br/>\nfor more than 20 years. Now 76 years old, he still returns two to <br/>\nfour times a year to the country that has become his life&#39;s work.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I encourage people to study the cultural history of countries <br/>\nthey&#39;re interested in,&quot; he said. &quot;Without that insight, it is <br/>\nextremely difficult to be communicating on the same channel.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- Jane Larson</div>",
