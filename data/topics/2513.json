            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-138629143\">Hi there sounds interesting what your doing, <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat type of figures are you using to portray the samurai, <br/>\nwww.Eastofindia are excellent but expensive. Anyway to attempt to <br/>\nhelp you out, the first place you should look is of course <br/>\nwww.samurai-archives esp <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/registry.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/registry.html</a><br/>\nThis gives a list of hundreds of samurai, with good detail on their <br/>\nlives. Also reading the article on Hojo Ujimasa would help you. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I can help you I will try, here are some names to look into<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst Hojo Ujinao was officially Daimyo of the Hojo although his <br/>\nfather Hojo Ujimasa still advised him and had control over aspects of <br/>\nthe clans actions. Initially the Hojou were allied to the Tokugawa <br/>\nbut later it was revoked and Ieyasu began the siege against Hojou. <br/>\nThere were attempted negotiations into 1590, only in May of 1590 did <br/>\nthe invasion of the Hojou lands of Kai, Sagami,Izu, Shimosa, Mushahsi <br/>\netc begin. The scale of the invasion was huge and from all sides, <br/>\nincluding naval contingents. Apparently 200 000 besiegers faced <br/>\n50 000 Hojou and allies. The chain of sattilite forts were quickly <br/>\nreduced individually as support could not be guarranted. While the <br/>\nsiege lengthened and the troops on both sides dug in or partied as <br/>\nthe case of the Besiegers, negotioations contiuned. When in July <br/>\nHideyoshi demanded surrender Hojou Ujinori (Ujimasa brother and <br/>\nretainer) went as messenger. Ujimasa wanted to continue fighting but <br/>\nUjinao eventually in Sept surrendered saving himself but Ujimasa and <br/>\nUjiteru (his brother) were forced to commit Seppuku.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs regards to the retainers allied to the Hojou well, first there are <br/>\nthe family clan members, Ujinao (Son of Ujimasa), Ujimasa (Father <br/>\nUjinao), Hojou Genan (Bro Ujitsuna),Hojo Tsunashige (adopted son of <br/>\nUjitsuna), Hojou Ujiteru (2nd son of Ujiyasu {Father of Ujimasa})<br/>\nUjikuni (3rd son of Ujiyasu, held Hachigata-jo a sattelite castle <br/>\nuntil subdued) Hojou Ujinori (4th son of Ujiyasu)Complicated family <br/>\nstructure but all employed in defense.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoujo retainers I can find, not sure about position of all-<br/>\n<br/>\nAshikaga Yoshiuji (think he is old Hojo not Sengoku)<br/>\n<br/>\nChiba Shigetane (Killed in Sakura castle think Izu province not <br/>\nOdawara jo because the campaign would have been conquest of all Hojou <br/>\nterritory which means 4-5 provinces namely Sagami, Mushashi, Izu, <br/>\npart of Kai, Shimosa ,Hitachi)<br/>\n<br/>\nDaidoji Masahige (one of Hojo Ujimasa&#39;s chief advisors, told Ujinao <br/>\navoid pitched battle)<br/>\n<br/>\nFuma Kotara (reported leader of Hojo special forces 200 man nija <br/>\nesque raid on Takeda forces in 1580, unsure as to if he was there)<br/>\n<br/>\nYuki Harumoto (Interesting Daimyo of Shimosa province severed ties <br/>\nwith Hojou after 1590, forced to break vassalship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about Odawara castle is that it is not as well known as <br/>\nOsaka castle siege, Odawara was the finishing of the Hojou and it <br/>\nseems I can find info about who finished them, but not much about who <br/>\nattempted to save them, maybe its a case of History is dictated by <br/>\nthe conquerers. undoubtedly there are 1000s of forgotten names. The <br/>\nHojo were on there way out, their allies deserted them they were <br/>\nsurrounded having previously helped Nobunaga, then Hideyoshi defeat <br/>\nthe Takeda, they brought their own downfall. Like rats deserting a <br/>\nsinking ship many samurai choose to throw in their lot with the <br/>\nstrong side, leaving the Hojou surrounded and weak, there were many <br/>\nrats left clinging to the ship when it went down but many have been <br/>\nforgoten. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking that in Turnbulls book on samurai heraldry there is a <br/>\npicture of the siege of Odawara, but thats me mixing it up with <br/>\nOsaka. I think in general it will be alot harder for you to portray <br/>\nOdawara because of the scanty information. The best way in my opinion <br/>\nwould be to show depending on your scale, a surrounded castle town, <br/>\nwith drooping banners on the castle walls, the inhabitants running <br/>\nout of ideas and hope, while an almost carnival atmosphere exists <br/>\naround the besiegers, with samurai on a war-peace footing capable of <br/>\nchanging at different moments, long periods of boredom with the <br/>\noccasional moment of action (like war in general, even the 2nd world <br/>\nwar) <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you luck with it, Ill continue to look for info, also I live <br/>\nin the North of England and am interested about your idea, it would <br/>\nbe good to see when finished. The Royal armouries in Leeds is a great <br/>\nplace to be inspired by seeing real sengoku period artifacts. If I <br/>\ncan help anymore don&#39;t hesitate to ask <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I finish I just read the article on the pre modern history of <br/>\nOdawara in the samurai archives articles section, you should read <br/>\nthis, the siege is more complicated than I realised, I forget <br/>\nHideyoshi built a castle opposite Odawara. You should take this info <br/>\ninto account. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll best Mark C</div>",
