The point was to reveal your &quot;heart&quot; and show that it was not black (meaning that you were honorable). And if I remember correctly, women opted to slit their throats rather than their bellies, simply because the act of seppuku was so utterly painful that a woman generally cannot tollerate the pain. Remeber, too, that this act is to be carried out without any emotion, or any sign of pain, or the act is all for naught. Taking this into consideration, and the fact that slitting your belly was a very slow death, women would choose the quicker, less painful method of suicide. <br/>\n <br/>\n  I hope that answers it! There are a few great books that can also help you along in your research (as well as a few websites), and I&#39;d be happy to give you a short bibliography if you&#39;d like.
