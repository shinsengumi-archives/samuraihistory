            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2015263371\">Learning samurai swordsmanship Japanese martial art exhilarating and <br/>\ndemanding, say practitioners <br/>\nFriday, August 26, 2005<br/>\nBY JASON DEEGAN <br/>\nNews Staff Reporter <br/>\nThe sign of respect signals the start of Kendo practice for the <br/>\nMaltby Middle School seventh-grader. <br/>\n<br/>\nMinutes later, DeBruhl, 12, is in full attack mode, dishing out <br/>\nblows to his opponent&#39;s head with his bokken, a bamboo stick used <br/>\nfor practice. DeBruhl appears tiny next to the bulking size of his <br/>\nsparring partner - his tall, lanky father, Perry DeBruhl. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs the two take turns trading blows in traditional forms of Kendo <br/>\ncalled kata, Perry stops his son for a quick pointer. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t pull off (during your strike). Go here,&#39;&#39; he says as he bangs <br/>\nhis bokken on Troy&#39;s head with aggressive precision. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe DeBruhls are the only Livingston County connection to a small <br/>\nband of loyalists in EMU&#39;s club called Kendo Dojo. Kendo, which <br/>\ntranslates to &quot;the way of the sword&#39;&#39; in Japanese, is the art of <br/>\nsamurai swordsmanship. People who practice the martial art say it&#39;s <br/>\nboth exhilarating and demanding to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the Web site, www.kendo-usa.org, modern Kendo has roots <br/>\nwith the samurai and evolved over several centuries. The <br/>\nintroduction of protective gear like the men (head gear), kote <br/>\n(wrist) and doh (chest protector) during the late 18th century <br/>\nallowed warriors to deliver full blows to one another without <br/>\ninjury. This forced the establishment of new regulations and <br/>\npractice habits. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerry DeBruhl, who works at Home Depot in Brighton and attends EMU <br/>\nto study construction management, became interested in the martial <br/>\narts as a U.S. Marine stationed in Okinawa, Japan, years ago. <br/>\nDeBruhl, a black belt in tae kwon do, introduced Kendo to his son <br/>\nafter finding out about the club in the summer of 2003. Today, they <br/>\ntravel the Midwest, competing in tournaments together. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo win a match, Kendo warriors must strike an opponent in either the <br/>\nmen (head), kote (wrist), belly (doh) or throat (tsuki) to score. <br/>\nNot only must the warrior hit the correct spot, they must do so with <br/>\nZanshin or &quot;zeal and intent&#39;&#39; by shouting the proper kiai, or war <br/>\ncry, according to EMU assistant coach Charlie Kondek. <br/>\n<br/>\nTroy DeBruhl said the most challenging parts of Kendo are learning <br/>\nthe footwork and war cries. He enjoys it so much, he did a science <br/>\nproject at Maltby about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is the hardest sport and the most fun sport I&#39;ve ever tried,&#39;&#39; <br/>\nhe said. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Kendo appears to be violent, Perry DeBruhl says the sport <br/>\nteaches many lessons. He added without reigi - the force behind <br/>\nKendo etiquette - the sport &quot;is just two people hitting each other <br/>\nwith sticks.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I enjoy the competition,&#39;&#39; he said. &quot;There are a lot of lessons in <br/>\nKendo that you can learn in life - respect, courtesy and manners. <br/>\nOnce you&#39;ve made the decision to attack, you have to commit your <br/>\nheart and soul. You go 100 percent.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn his Kendo garb, a blue robe, protective pads and black mask, <br/>\nPerry DeBruhl is an imposing figure. He towers over most of the <br/>\nothers in the class. His ability to deliver down blows from above <br/>\nhas earned him the nickname the &quot;blue bomber from Brighton.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Not only did Perry have prior athletic background, but with a <br/>\nbackground in martial arts, he knew exactly what it took to <br/>\ndiscipline himself (for Kendo),&#39;&#39; Kondek said. &quot;He&#39;s come a long way <br/>\nin a short time.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe club&#39;s younger members, including Troy, have done well in <br/>\ntournaments. &quot;The youth in our club have put the adults to shame,&#39;&#39; <br/>\nKondek admitted. &quot;Troy&#39;s picked it up quick.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nTroy said he loves battling his dad in practice, especially after a <br/>\nlittle motivation from home. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve had my PS/2 (video game) taken away, so I had reason for anger <br/>\nabout that,&#39;&#39; he said. &quot;We do go at it pretty hard, and we always <br/>\ntalk about it afterwards.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nPerry DeBruhl said he will test to become a shodan, like a black <br/>\nbelt, at a tournament in Chicago in November. Troy said he can&#39;t <br/>\nwait to move up in rank, so he can start teaching others. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are a lot of people who come to Kendo from other martial <br/>\narts,&#39;&#39; Perry DeBruhl said. &quot;The Japanese sword is a classic.&#39;&#39;</div>",
