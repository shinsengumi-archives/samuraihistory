            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1720760883\">These may be a bit rarified, but probably the best place to start is &quot;Shiryo ni Yoru Nihon no Ayumi.&quot;  This has a good overview of sources for the Tokugawa period, both primary and secondary.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Along with consulting the works cited, you probably should familiarize yourself with the Chu Hsi or the neo-Confucian movement, which Tsunayoshi was a major force behind.  This was also the period of the 47 Ronin and you might want to check out some of the historical sources and commentaries on this famous play.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Probably the most accessable source of the period of Tsunayoshi&#39;s reign would be the well-known memoirs of Engelbert Kaempfer, a Dutch trader who was one of the few people who got see what was happening in Japan outside Nagasaki.<br/>\n<br/>\n  From the Japanese side, I can only think that Arai Hakuseki&#39;s memoirs might be useful.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As always, my favorite general history of Japan is George Sansom&#39;s Three vol history from the beginning of time through the Meiji Resotration.  There is a brief overview of Tsunayoshi&#39;s career at the beginning of chapter XI.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I hope this is a help to you. I would be interested in hearing what others might have to say about these sources. <br/>\nGillian Rubinstein &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gillian@...\">gillian@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;     firstly i am after literature- published workd, or websites- <br/>\n </span></blockquote>containing <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; information on the life of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1680-1709).
