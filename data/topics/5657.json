            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1383789197\">Play it again, samurai <br/>\n<br/>\nStephen Hunter<br/>\nThe Washington Post<br/>\nOct. 2, 2004 12:00 AM <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was my summer of sam - sam as in samurai. Who knows why? What I <br/>\ndo know is that when I saw Yoji Yamada&#39;s &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot; back <br/>\nin May, it lit something in me. The speed, grace and beauty of the <br/>\nfighting, the intractability of the men compelled to do it, the <br/>\ntenderness of the women who accepted it, the themes of vengeance and <br/>\nloyalty (those primeval melodramatic staples) as expressed in the <br/>\nspurting blood and lopped limbs; it all seemed suddenly powerful and <br/>\nright and satisfying in a way movies hadn&#39;t been for some while.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo begin with, the samurai were all fresh, at least to my eyes. The <br/>\nimagery of the West, of knights on horseback, of soldiers charging <br/>\nup a beach under heavy fire: all old, all stale, hardly impressive <br/>\nanymore. But ... here were these guys in bathrobes. They grunted and <br/>\nstomped and stared and laughed. They seemed to be having so much <br/>\nfun! And to repeat what I believe is the funniest image I have ever <br/>\ninvented: They swordfought in flip-flops! How cool is that? That <br/>\nhair, shaven (the Japanese equated baldness with masculinity, <br/>\nnothing wrong with that!), a ponytail nursed, then folded over to <br/>\nform a topknot. The swagger, the run, the utter comfort in the <br/>\nphysical world! God, to carry a sword, eat sushi and sleep with <br/>\nwomen in kimonos! What else is there? And, speaking of mysteries, <br/>\nhow do they get the swords to stay in the sashes? Aren&#39;t swords <br/>\nheavy? Wouldn&#39;t they droop? Yet these guys run, ride, sit, drink, <br/>\nlaugh, all with six pounds of double-folded, multi-pounded and <br/>\nquenched blades (always with two: a 27-inch katana and a 14-inch <br/>\nwakizashi) imperturbably lodged in their sashes. Baby, that&#39;s style!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unlike most movie fans who get a second wind when some obscure <br/>\nstimulus sends them flying into the ether for a few months, I had a <br/>\nnewspaper at my disposal. So I wrote a batch of pieces on my <br/>\nfixation. In one I celebrated three great samurai films - Akira <br/>\nKurosawa&#39;s &quot;The Seven Samurai,&quot; Hiroshi Inagaki&#39;s &quot;Samurai&quot; trilogy <br/>\nand Kenji Misumi&#39;s &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (never to be confused with <br/>\nEdward Zwick&#39;s &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;!) Then I discovered the series <br/>\nfilms of the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, the six &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; and the <br/>\n26 &quot;Zatoichi, the Blind Swordsman,&quot; and had great fun writing about <br/>\nthem, too. But the most fun of all was when Beat <br/>\nTakeshi&#39;s &quot;Zatoichi, the Blind Swordsman&quot; re-created the<br/>\ndelights of the earlier series.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut ever since then, I have learned more. I have learned so much - <br/>\nsay, that Tatsuya Nakadai was a better actor than Toshiro Mifune and <br/>\nthat Kihachi Okamoto at least rivaled Kurosawa at moments and that <br/>\nkilling a high lord in the snow at Sakurada Gate in Edo in 1860 <br/>\nisn&#39;t a good career move but it does get you a certain immortality - <br/>\nthat I can now say proudly, I know nothing. The breadth and depth, <br/>\nthe differing tonalities, the textures of color, it&#39;s all dazzling <br/>\nand possibly endless.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what the samurai pictures, high and low, seem to have in common <br/>\nis a sense of the code - absolute loyalty to the clan, no matter the <br/>\ncost (though its meaning could be played straight or ironically) - a <br/>\nfaith in bravery, and the soundest story construction, movie by <br/>\nmovie, in history. The writers of these movies were workmen, not <br/>\nartists, carpenters and drywall guys, not poets and dancers. Thus <br/>\nthe stories are all rooted in narrative simplicity and the value of <br/>\nmotive. Even at their most insipid, they grip in a way that American <br/>\nmovies seem to have forgotten how to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides the trio of films I recommend, let me mention several others <br/>\nthat are equally excellent: &quot;Sword of Doom,&quot; a look at a psychotic <br/>\nswordsman (played by Nakadai); &quot;Harakiri&quot; (which watches a father - <br/>\nNakadai again - gain vengeance on the clan that bluffed his son into <br/>\na horrible death), &quot;Goyokin&quot; (a giant Italian western sort of <br/>\nmovie); &quot;Samurai Rebellion,&quot; (Mifune on the warpath); &quot;The Yagyu <br/>\nConspiracy&quot; (with Sonny Chiba); and the fabulous &quot;Shogun&#39;s Shadow&quot; <br/>\n(wall-to-wall-to-ceiling-to-back-porch action, with Chiba as the bad <br/>\nguy!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, I went a little samurai nuts for weeks and weeks. <br/>\nHappily, I have not recovered. Hopefully, I never will.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/1002samurai02.html\">http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/1002samurai02.html</a></div>",
