You might like to do a search on him and have a <br/>\nlook at his forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own experience in Japan (purely anectdotal, I&#39;m afraid) is that most <br/>\nof my friends my age find foreigners&#39; interest in &quot;samurai&quot; (mine <br/>\nincluded) rather strange. For a start, they never call them &quot;samurai&quot;, <br/>\nalways &quot;bushi&quot;. But the same people (mostly women) love kabuki drama <br/>\nand watch taiga (the NHK many episode period drama). The young <br/>\nactors I was working with last year (in their 20s) thought bushi heroes <br/>\nvery cool, and were especially keen on the shinsengumi - the plays for <br/>\nchildren in this theatre company&#39;s repertoire often include samurai <br/>\nstories in all sorts of forms, Boys&#39; festival keeps alive the interest in <br/>\nswords, helmets etc, thousands of manga and anime have historical <br/>\nthemes, which can be comic, heroic, ghostly, whatever. So perhaps the <br/>\nreal, ongoing cultural history of the country should be seen separately <br/>\nfrom the admiration of bushido which is more common among <br/>\nforeigners than among Japanese where, I suspect, it is seen as verging <br/>\ntowards fascism. (This was definitely the view of the occupying forces <br/>\nafter the war when samurai drama and films were banned.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own interest came from Kurosawa movies!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nGillian<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

This is often<br/>\nexpressed in enka music and I recommend the book by<br/>\nChristine Yano, &quot;Tears of Longing&quot; on the subject.<br/>\nThis nostalgic desire though does explain some of the<br/>\nfascination with samurai/bushido that survives in pop<br/>\nculture. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese might be a few directions to look into, if I<br/>\nthink of anything else I&#39;know!<br/>\n<br/>\n-J.Salvador<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/\">http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/</a></div>",

We&#39;ve got one<br/>\npublished author that I know of, and a few others who<br/>\nhave academic credentials that can weigh in--is that<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re looking for? If you plan on using them for<br/>\na source, make sure whomever you use can establish<br/>\ntheir expertise--otherwise, you get a bunch of wannabe<br/>\nhacks (like me, I&#39;ll admit) answering your question,<br/>\nand you quoting them without knowing they aren&#39;t<br/>\nformally educated in the matter. Just want to make<br/>\nsure you&#39;re careful :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) how do accounts of bushido/samurai differ inside<br/>\n&gt; and outside <br/>\n&gt; Japan?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Outside Japan, too many people only understand it from<br/>\neither movies and television, or from Hagakure, or<br/>\nfrom study of pre-WWII Japan, and think it&#39;s an<br/>\nall-encompassing lifestyle still followed today, or<br/>\nthey think it&#39;s a religion, or that all samurai were<br/>\nparagons of bushido. <br/>\n<br/>\nJapanese have a much better grasp of the reality, I<br/>\nthink--that it is a vague set of warrior ideals<br/>\ncreated throughout samurai history, codified in the<br/>\nEdo period by those who felt a need to explain the<br/>\nexistence of a warrior class with no wars to fight, <br/>\nthen coopted by the political elite to speed the<br/>\nbuildup of military and industry to catch up and<br/>\nsurpass the West. While it&#39;s by no means completely<br/>\nirrelevant to modern Japan, it&#39;s not any more invoked<br/>\nby Japanese than any Western virtues are invoked by<br/>\nEuropeans or Americans. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Where do public conceptions of bushido originate<br/>\n&gt; (i.e., How do <br/>\n&gt; most people learn about bushido?), and is this<br/>\n&gt; different for Japan <br/>\n&gt; and the West?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The West: Movies, anime, and reading bad Cleary<br/>\ntranslations. Seriously, part of it is because the<br/>\nimage is more interesting than the reality--so the<br/>\nimage gets perpetuated, and the reality gets<br/>\nforgotten. <br/>\n<br/>\nJapan: History class? Of course it&#39;s much more<br/>\nprevalent in their pop culture, but there&#39;s a<br/>\nhistorical understanding of it that tempers it a bit. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) How has the useage/meaning of the terms bushido<br/>\n&gt; and samurai <br/>\n&gt; changed over the years since Nitobe Inazo<br/>\n&gt; popularized them in 1900?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Um, well, both words existed before 1900. Samurai<br/>\nceased to exist about 25 years before 1900, so I&#39;d<br/>\nhardly say the word was popularized then. In the West,<br/>\nI&#39;d say, Bushido is either mentioned in the context of<br/>\nthe &quot;wonderful&quot; martial virtues of the Samurai, or the<br/>\nsame &quot;horrific&quot; values of the WWII era Japanese<br/>\nmilitary. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) Why do samurai retain such a hold on the popular<br/>\n&gt; imagination?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because they&#39;re freaking cool! As we&#39;ve discussed on<br/>\nthe Archives board before, just about everyone has a<br/>\ndifferent reason they are interested in the<br/>\nsubject...some because they collect swords, others<br/>\nbecause they are history buffs, some because they read<br/>\na certain book or movie (if you took a poll, about 40%<br/>\nwould say &quot;Shogun&quot;, in book or movie format, was the<br/>\nkey for them), etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to attempt to really answer the question, for much<br/>\nthe same reason that gunfighters of the Old West or<br/>\nknights in shining armor do--because the ideal image<br/>\nof a brave warrior fighting for &quot;right&quot; against the<br/>\nodds is a common human ideal archetype. <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting questions!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/\">http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/</a></div>",
