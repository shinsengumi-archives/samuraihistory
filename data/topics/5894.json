See I&#39;m an ABC (Australian Born<br/>\n&gt; Chinese). Thing <br/>\n&gt; is, I know more about Japanese history then I do my<br/>\n&gt; own. I know very <br/>\n&gt; little about Chinese history and what I do know<br/>\n&gt; about Australian <br/>\n&gt; history is what I have learnt from school. To me<br/>\n&gt; Australian history <br/>\n&gt; is very hmm how would you say? &quot;Mind-numbing&quot;, we<br/>\n&gt; only have around <br/>\n&gt; two hundred years of history so it isn&#39;t as<br/>\n&gt; impressive as other <br/>\n&gt; cultures. I do have an interest in Chinese history,<br/>\n&gt; however is not a <br/>\n&gt; priority for me at the moment. One day, sometime in<br/>\n&gt; the near future I <br/>\n&gt; do plan on correcting this. So I guess what I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; asking is, are there <br/>\n&gt; others that know more about a specific culture then<br/>\n&gt; they do their own.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zev<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi, fellow chinese.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, we tend to use the term ABC for American<br/>\nBC, not Australian BC ;) (we as in Singaporeans :p)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, I am of a similar situation, interested more<br/>\nin Japanese history (started by Shogun Total War) and<br/>\nculture in general (anime fan myself), than of the<br/>\nhistory of my own culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne good thing about living in Singapore is that we do<br/>\nget to watch historical dramas made by PRC (far more<br/>\nauthentic than what ROC and HK churns out).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone else said, ask your parents and<br/>\ngrandparents on they know. Likewise, libraries and the<br/>\ninternet offers quite a lot of information to begin<br/>\nwith. Of course, there are a lot of less than<br/>\nauthentic information out there. A little experience<br/>\nwill help you to separate the wheat from the chaff.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nDon&#39;t think your swords and clothes should be as good as those of other people.
