            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1677477334\">Here&#39;s an FYI to any and all wondering why there is a conspicuous <br/>\nlack of updates to the Samurai Archives page - we are currently in <br/>\nthe process of putting a book together - with plans for a second <br/>\nwithin the next two years, contents of which are temporarily top <br/>\nsecret.  The amount of translating involved, as well as school, <br/>\nfamily and work obligations takes away from any real time to make any <br/>\nmajor updates to the page.  We are looking at a publishing date of <br/>\nsometime in the future within the last 4 - 5 months of this year, but <br/>\ndon&#39;t have a solid timetable down.  Anyway, the one publisher we have <br/>\nbeen looking at has a [hopefully] temporary hold on new manuscripts <br/>\nuntil they catch up on an apparently large backlog of books that are <br/>\nwaiting to be published.  At the very least, we intend to keep <br/>\nthe &#39;Samurai of the Week&#39;  changed each week, and keep this list <br/>\nmoderated (so don&#39;t worry if it takes a day or two for one of us to <br/>\napprove a message).  Anyway, somewhat on topic - since updates from <br/>\nus may not be too forthcoming on the page for a while, if there is <br/>\nanyone out there who wants to put together some &#39;samurai desktop <br/>\nwallpaper&#39; for us to put on the &#39;downloads&#39; page, or even create <br/>\nsome &#39;samurai&#39; related &#39;skins&#39; for games such as &quot;the sims&quot;, &quot;half-<br/>\nlife&quot;, etc.,  email me off the list (especially the sims!)  at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kitsuno@...\">kitsuno@...</a> and we&#39;ll see about adding them to <br/>\nour &#39;downloads&#39; section.<br/>\n<br/>\nC.West</div>",
