This is<br/>\nnot a novel in the full sense but rather &quot;faction&quot; - a very interesting way<br/>\nof portraying events in the Inn by using little playlets. I would recommend<br/>\nit to light readers as well as serious readers. I have a copy from 1961,<br/>\npublished in New York by Random House. In it I have kept a review by a<br/>\nliterature critic of the time (in the Daily Telegraph I think). I thought it<br/>\nmight be of interest, as an aside the cost then was 35s - £1.75 in sterling<br/>\nnow or about $2.50:<br/>\n<br/>\nJAPANESE INN. By Oliver Statler. (.Secker and Warburg. 35s.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFOR Mr. Statler in 1947, a fortyeight-hour pass meant not the fleshpots of<br/>\nTokyo but a week-end in a village inn; and the trip into the countryside,<br/>\noften repeated, soon became a trip into the feudal past. The inn was the<br/>\nMinaguchi-ya, in the village of Okitsu, on the Tokaido highway linking the<br/>\nold Imperial capital of Kyoto with Edo, the Shogunate site of modern Tokyo.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn electing to write a history of the Minaguchi-ya Mr. Statler could<br/>\nscarcely avoid anthologising most of the more colourful episodes and<br/>\ncharacters in the Japanese calendar. There is no denying the fascination of<br/>\nthis material, which will be familiar only to students of things Japanese.<br/>\nIt is all written up with a vividness that captures what is bloody minded as<br/>\nwell as what is charming in this culture of ascetic aestheticism.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany generations of the Mochizuki family played host here to such eccentrics<br/>\nas Ieyasu Tokugawa, Will Adams, the Zen poet Basho, Dr. Kaempfer, and<br/>\nHiroshige, whose views of the Tokaido liberally illustrate these pages. More<br/>\ntenuously linked to the fortunes of the inn are the many period politicos<br/>\nand the European bagmen and missionaries, with their serio-comical<br/>\nsquabbles. The inn was awash with blood during the police terror of 1651. In<br/>\n1705 the teenagers were on the march; a compulsive crusade of three and a<br/>\nhalf millions passed by en route to Ise. Of such little-known incidents is<br/>\nthis entertaining and unusual volume composed. It is decorated with the<br/>\nsatirical brush sketches of Jichosai, an agreeably astringent foil to the<br/>\nwoodcuts of Hiroshige, Hokusai, Kuniyoshi and Moronobu.<br/>\n<br/>\nHUGH GORDON PORTEUS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Paul & Anne Wittine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dogen@...\">dogen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 02, 2002 9:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Japanese Inn by Statler Oliver (Slightly OT?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Can anybody who somewhat knows the subject, tell me if this book can be<br/>\n&gt; taken at face value, or is it just another misguided attempt at<br/>\n&gt; understanding Eastern culture and history by a citizen of the West?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paul Wittine<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
