Let me introduce myself. My name is Martin, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m from Quebec City, Canada. I&#39;ve done a couple of different <br/>\n&gt; japanese martial arts in the last 15 years. I stopped for a while but <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m about to return to it. I&#39;m also in the SCA ans as you probably <br/>\n&gt; suspect, my persona is japanese. My SCA name is Fukushima Masanari <br/>\n&gt; Hanzo, a late Heian imperial guard. <br/>\n&gt;    Now the question.<br/>\n&gt;    I&#39;m searching about some kind of ceremonial &quot;passing of power&quot;, or <br/>\n&gt; any info about how the samurai daimyo steps down and how daimyo were <br/>\n&gt; promoted, etc. In fact, we have a small japanese household here and <br/>\n&gt; the leader is stepping down and want to give the power to someone <br/>\n&gt; else. We would like to do it the more authentic possible. I know that <br/>\n&gt; sometimes a Daimyo takes over a household by killing the former <br/>\n&gt; ruler, but we are searching about something more peaceful. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    Than you very much about your future advices.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    Martin <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
