            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-786964378\">Hi there! Zen buddhism was popularized in japan by the bushi, and became the basis of bushi-do.<br/>\nWhat I heard was that a famous warrior who used a Bo-staff fled Japan in the 8th century a.d. for some unknown reason, perhaps he was being sought after by rivals of his dead lord or something like that.<br/>\nAt any rate this warrior went to china, where he met up with the shaolin monks, who were buddhists. Influenced by the Chinese philosophies of taoism and confucianism and impressed by the buddhist sharma of the shaolin, the warrior became the first zen-buddhist.<br/>\nAfter a time the warrior was forgotten by his enemies and he returned to Japan. Now the faith of Japan at the time was and is still called &quot;Shinto&quot;, shinto is the nature and ancestor worship practised by the ancient Japanese, who claim that the islandsof Honshu was in fact the body of a dead goddess, and that Kami or spirits live in the wild places of Japan.<br/>\nThis warrior-monk incorporated Shinto with the Buddhist/Taoists beliefs of the Chinese to form Zen-buddhism.<br/>\nAs the buddhists believe in re-incarnation and a progressive pattern of good/positive actions that lead to a better re-incarnation in a future life, Zen was quickly adopted by the bushi. Men who were to die valiantly in their lord&#39;s service need not fear death, as they would re-incarnate further along the path of Insamsara, the cycle of living and dying.<br/>\nZen is considered to be an austere and disciplined form of buddhism, perfect for the serious minded bushi, and incorporated many of the principles of taoism (ying and yang) and confuscist thought.<br/>\nZen teachers often use parables to impart their teachings to their students. For example one teacher wrote: &quot; Before studying Zen, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers. During the studying, mountains are no longer mountains and rivers are no longer rivers. After having mastered Zen, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers.&quot;<br/>\nSelf-lessness, ego suppression, calmness of thought, sense of purpose; these were the goals of Zen students. Hope I answered some of your questions.<br/>\nYou might want to read...Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, The book of five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi, the art of war by Sun Tzu, and also the Dharma.<br/>\ncheck out my website if you want to chat or get a hold of me, www.angelfire.com/extreme4/yukongrapplers.html bye for now!

Some Zen practitioners use Kyudo as a tool for <br/>\nspiritual development. In these cases Kyudo is no different than use of any <br/>\nother koan.<br/>\n  However, this is not the WAY. As put down in the writings of <br/>\nInagaki-sensei. Kokoro no Yumi is not zen although it does share some <br/>\naspects. Nate phrased it well when he mentioned what a small percentage of <br/>\nJapanese follow Zen precepts. Do a search on Herrigel It has pretty much <br/>\nbeen concluded that there were huge misunderstandings between him and his <br/>\nteacher ( a man who was a laughingstock among the Kyudo community). In Kyudo <br/>\nand kendo, there are serious mental/spiritual issues to deal with once <br/>\ntechnique has been conquered, but cloaking things in mysticism is a disguise <br/>\nfor teachers who don&#39;t understand the core of thier arts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Don&#39;t get me wrong I have respect for Zen practitioners. A friend of mine <br/>\nfrom Spain who was doing Kyudo for spiritual aspects left to begin Chado <br/>\nabout 6 months ago. However, Zen doesn&#39;t permeate the air you breathe in <br/>\nJapan, or even the air in dojo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis links in to some of my thoughts recently about why I love japanese <br/>\nculture so much. When we are young we believe in magic. As we age we <br/>\ndiscover there is no Santa Claus, no Easter bunny, no magic. Some people <br/>\nturn to religion. Others to mysticism. When I was a teenager, I was one of <br/>\nthose wannabe ninja/samurai. (The ones who drive Tony and myself insane with <br/>\nthier &quot;facts&quot;)I believed in the mystic. I am fortunate in that when I <br/>\ndiscovered it&#39;s smoke, mirrors and physics, I had already learned about <br/>\nother interesting aspects of the culture.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?

Unfortunately, it receives so much print and<br/>\npress that many people believe that all Japanese sit<br/>\nand listen to the rocks grow, or harken to hear the<br/>\nsound of one hand clapping. This is far from the<br/>\ntruth. Neither must one be a strict adherent of Zen<br/>\nBuddhism to practice Kendo or Kyudo. Yes, the<br/>\nphilosophy is part of the practice, but they are not<br/>\none and the same. Do I have to renounce my<br/>\nChristianity in order to pick up a shinai?

The goal in Zen is to abandon all agendas.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>However, the writers mentioned certainly have a<br/>\nZen-biased agenda. That&#39;s not a criticism, but an<br/>\nobservation. Their purpose is to promote their image<br/>\nof Zen. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, it is JUST as unfortunate for people to be led<br/>\nto the misperception that all Japanese practice tea<br/>\nceremony and kendo in some sort of mystical Zen quest<br/>\nas it is for them to think that all samurai followed<br/>\nbushido and committed seppuku if they coughed wrong.<br/>\nWhile Zen captures the Western imagination, even<br/>\nTokugawa Ieyasu didn&#39;t belong to the Zen sect--he was<br/>\na follower of Jodo-shuu. Most samurai didn&#39;t study<br/>\nkenjutsu in preparation for some musha-shugyo where<br/>\nthey found spiritual enlightenment, they did it so<br/>\nthey could kill and keep from being killed on the<br/>\nbattlefield. While Kyudo may have developed as a means<br/>\nto putting Zen principles into practice, kyujutsu was<br/>\ndeveloped as a means of putting an arrow into your<br/>\nenemy. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, I hope the young person who started all<br/>\nthis is happy--with no effort on his part, we&#39;ve given<br/>\nhim a lot to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

As a student in <br/>\nTokyo back in the early 80&#39;s I once attended a kyudo and kendo <br/>\ndemonstration at Yasukuni-jinja which was followed by a   <br/>\nlecture  on the philosophical underpinnings of kyudo, kendo, <br/>\nchado, etc.  by Nakamura Hajime (whose authority in Japan on <br/>\nthis subject is unquestioned). Nakamura-sensei (Toyo Bunka <br/>\nKenkyu-jo, Tokyo Daigaku) described the relationship between <br/>\nkyudo-Zen, kendo-Zen, etc as being co-terminus. It seems that <br/>\nyou practice kyudo, desho? Wouldn&#39;t you say that the &quot;goal&quot; of <br/>\nkyudo lies in the &quot;cultivation&quot; of &quot;mushin&quot;, &quot;munen&quot;? These are <br/>\ncentral Zen terms ... In fact, as you well know, the suffix &quot;do&quot; (kyu-<br/>\ndo) is a translation of the Sanskrit term &quot;marga&quot; which means <br/>\nthe &quot;path to enlightenment&quot;. Also, the training halls of kyudo, <br/>\nkendo, etc is called &quot;dojo&quot; which is translation of &quot;bodhimanda&quot; <br/>\n(the site where Buddhas attain enlightenment ...<br/>\n<br/>\nA  member of our tea ceremony group in Tokyo back in the day <br/>\nwho was studying kyudo once asked our tea sensei about the <br/>\nrelationship between tea and kyudo. He answered, &quot; Onaji desu <br/>\n- Mattaku onaji&quot;. I think if you contacted a judan kyudo sensei, he <br/>\nwould probably answer the same way if asked about the <br/>\nrelationship between Zen and kyudo...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might irritate you a bit but it is intended with a bit of humor <br/>\nand certainly much love: You wrote &quot;bear in mind the agendas of <br/>\nwriters&quot;. The goal in Zen is to abandon all agendas. I think if a <br/>\nperson has an &quot;agenda&quot;, he or she might  certainly learn - and <br/>\nlearn well -  the mechanics of a Japanese martial arts. However, <br/>\nthere is a point beyond where no progress is possible until <br/>\n&quot;agendas&quot; are abandoned..<br/>\n<br/>\nStill working on my own agendas,<br/>\nryhorikawa</div>",

On enquiring its<br/>\npurposer, I was told it was a device for measuring<br/>\ntime elapsed... It appears that our &quot;western&quot; day of<br/>\n24hours was divided into two parts, being night and<br/>\nday. Nothing strange there until it was pointed out<br/>\nthat night = sunset to sunrise and day = sunrise to<br/>\nsunset. Now the &quot;clever bit&quot; - of course through the<br/>\nyear the number of hours from sunrise to sunset varies<br/>\nbut there had to be a similar time period night and<br/>\nday {whatever it was say for now 6 periods!} ie<br/>\nvarying &quot;hours&quot;. The device was so made to compensate<br/>\nfor seasonal changes... I suppose thinking about it we<br/>\nhad sundials (but little sun!) before chronometers<br/>\ncame along.....<br/>\n<br/>\nWell thats a start anyway.... and if you are in the<br/>\nCotswolds Area make sure you visit Snowshill (National<br/>\nTrust) it had a unique collection of &quot;samurai&quot; armour.<br/>\n<br/>\n          Rod Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Hi<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering what is the medievil Japanese method<br/>\nof time keeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard of it being in 2 hour segments named<br/>\nafter animals but I am unsure if this is correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just how did they maintain the method of keeping<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the UK in ancient times they used to mark a candle<br/>\nwith one hour segments.

On enquiring its purposer, I was told it was a device for measuring time elapsed... It appears that our &quot;western&quot; day of 24hours was divided into two parts, being night and day. Nothing strange there until it was pointed out that night = sunset to sunrise and day = sunrise to sunset. Now the &quot;clever bit&quot; - of course through the year the number of hours from sunrise to sunset varies but there had to be a similar time period night and day {whatever it was say for now 6 periods!} ie varying &quot;hours&quot;. The device was so made to compensate for seasonal changes... I suppose thinking about it we had sundials (but little sun!) before chronometers came along.....<br/>\n<br/>\nWell thats a start anyway.... and if you are in the Cotswolds Area make sure you visit Snowshill (National Trust) it had a unique collection of &quot;samurai&quot; armour.<br/>\n<br/>\n          Rod Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Hi<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering what is the medievil Japanese method of time keeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard of it being in 2 hour segments named after animals but I am unsure if this is correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just how did they maintain the method of keeping time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the UK in ancient times they used to mark a candle with one hour segments.
