I suggest this :<br/>\n- Do not make anything to the blade or the tang in order to discover<br/>\nbetter details or, worst, in order to let it sharper. Do not touch the<br/>\nblade, clean it with paper nose tissue, maintain it in the scabbard<br/>\ncutting edge up. <br/>\n- Search for easy and near To-ken fun club, give it personally (without<br/>\nleaving them alone in their hands) for a first, direct kantei if they<br/>\nagree to make it free. If they agree the blade is a traditional<br/>\nhand-made and is in recoverable conditions, ask for a qualified togishi<br/>\n(polisher).<br/>\n-Get in touch with the togishi, asking for polish prices, usually XY U$<br/>\nat inch (both sides included) of the sharp part of the blade. At the<br/>\nfinish of the work all the mystery of the blade will be unveiled.<br/>\nPersonally, I gave to polisher also a blade that is not at present day<br/>\nan investment. The price paid and the polish was superior to the market<br/>\nprice.<br/>\nBut is a personal thought. To give back a blade to their dignity is for<br/>\nme enough for the price paid...<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Messaggio originale-----<br/>\nDa: Scott Moore [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sgmoore@...\">sgmoore@...</a>] <br/>\nInviato: domenica 11 maggio 2003 19.29<br/>\nA: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nOggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you for your information and thoughts.

Remembering that in the 1660&#39;s<br/>\na shallow curve was en vogue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It resemble to me no &#39;&#39;black color&#39;&#39; rust in the tang but it may be due<br/>\n&gt;to the flash light surely used to take the photos.

If this<br/>\n&gt;patterns do not match with the signature ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes correct kantei dictates that the signature confirms what you see <br/>\nin the blade.

The Meikan is a listing of over 20,000 smiths <br/>\nincluding gendai, if there is a later smith with this signature he <br/>\nwould turn up here. Although Banshu (Harima) did not exist after 1870 <br/>\nor so, thus it would be very unlikely to turn up in a gendai sig.<br/>\n\tAgain I ask Scott, what does his translation say, and can he <br/>\nbe so kind as to provide more pics.

And why so slight curvature in a 17th<br/>\n&gt;century blade ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No but it would if the sword were suriage,<br/>\nwhich is how it appears to my eye, this would reduce<br/>\nthe sori as well. Remembering that in the 1660&#39;s<br/>\na shallow curve was en vogue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It resemble to me no &#39;&#39;black color&#39;&#39; rust in the tang but it may be due<br/>\n&gt;to the flash light surely used to take the photos. The handle is rather<br/>\n&gt;long, suggesting a possible ancestral blade, but... also the signature<br/>\n&gt;seems to me too much well preserved for having 300 years,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have seen older blades that looked new,<br/>\nwith surprisingly little rust for all their years.<br/>\nA custom handle may indicate an older blade or just the preference of <br/>\nthe swordsman..<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;as the sharp<br/>\n&gt;angles of the tang and mekugi-ana. Sharpness may be explained with a<br/>\n&gt;borders re-shaping (saving the signature) to fit with the kyugunto<br/>\n&gt;mounting<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>may have been altered to fit the gunto mounts true<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;but I am still not able to see filemarks, whether the kanji are<br/>\n&gt;rather good visible. Without jihada, boshi and a closer image of at<br/>\n&gt;least little part of the hamon is hard to determine the school. If this<br/>\n&gt;patterns do not match with the signature ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes correct kantei dictates that the signature confirms what you see <br/>\nin the blade. This is why I asked for pics of the kissaki and <br/>\nmonouchi.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;May be a new swordsmith signature of later time? Because effectively, if<br/>\n&gt;old, is hard to think of a fake with such a signature, but nowadays some<br/>\n&gt;fakers make the same reasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Granted but fakers want to sell swords, faking an obscure signature <br/>\nmay throw off the wary but would hardly bring enough money to be <br/>\nworth the trouble. The Meikan is a listing of over 20,000 smiths <br/>\nincluding gendai, if there is a later smith with this signature he <br/>\nwould turn up here. Although Banshu (Harima) did not exist after 1870 <br/>\nor so, thus it would be very unlikely to turn up in a gendai sig.<br/>\n\tAgain I ask Scott, what does his translation say, and can he <br/>\nbe so kind as to provide more pics. As you say we need to kantei the <br/>\nsword and not the koshirae.<br/>\n  -t<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Honestly, signature is the last thing I see to, while here we have to<br/>\n&gt;work with it as the first step. And to be sincere, I was not able to<br/>\n&gt;read it as good as you have made. I have thinked about the little label<br/>\n&gt;:<br/>\n&gt;surrenders swords had such a lebel to make it easy to give back<br/>\n&gt;(eventually...) the blade to the formerly owner, and this may suggest<br/>\n&gt;the blade was of a certain interest.<br/>\n&gt;But this is not a rule in kantei (fakes of surrenders blade with<br/>\n&gt;&#39;&#39;dedications&#39;&#39; have a their own market...). If Scott would see at the<br/>\n&gt;back of the handle and other details comparing it to the description<br/>\n&gt;shown in the part of the article I have posted, may be we can argue if<br/>\n&gt;the mounting was intended for a High officer, enforcing the &#39;&#39;ancestral<br/>\n&gt;blade&#39;&#39; theory.<br/>\n&gt;By the way, Gen. Yamashita&#39;s sword was of the same period...<br/>\n&gt;Please have no trouble to refute my suggestions as I&#39;m taking this as a<br/>\n&gt;learning session, with a lot of fun.  <br/>\n&gt;Thanks for your time.<br/>\n&gt;Carlo<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Messaggio originale-----<br/>\n&gt;Da: tom helm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junkmail@...\">junkmail@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Inviato: mercoledì 7 maggio 2003 9.06<br/>\n&gt;A: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Oggetto: Re: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Carlo-<br/>\n&gt;       Scott has the translation so he can easily straighten us out<br/>\n&gt;and the mountings are clearly wartime production.

The handle is rather<br/>\nlong, suggesting a possible ancestral blade, but... also the signature<br/>\nseems to me too much well preserved for having 300 years, as the sharp<br/>\nangles of the tang and mekugi-ana. Sharpness may be explained with a<br/>\nborders re-shaping (saving the signature) to fit with the kyugunto<br/>\nmounting but I am still not able to see filemarks, whether the kanji are<br/>\nrather good visible. Without jihada, boshi and a closer image of at<br/>\nleast little part of the hamon is hard to determine the school. If this<br/>\npatterns do not match with the signature ?<br/>\nMay be a new swordsmith signature of later time? Because effectively, if<br/>\nold, is hard to think of a fake with such a signature, but nowadays some<br/>\nfakers make the same reasoning.<br/>\nHonestly, signature is the last thing I see to, while here we have to<br/>\nwork with it as the first step. And to be sincere, I was not able to<br/>\nread it as good as you have made. I have thinked about the little label<br/>\n:<br/>\nsurrenders swords had such a lebel to make it easy to give back<br/>\n(eventually...) the blade to the formerly owner, and this may suggest<br/>\nthe blade was of a certain interest.<br/>\nBut this is not a rule in kantei (fakes of surrenders blade with<br/>\n&#39;&#39;dedications&#39;&#39; have a their own market...). If Scott would see at the<br/>\nback of the handle and other details comparing it to the description<br/>\nshown in the part of the article I have posted, may be we can argue if<br/>\nthe mounting was intended for a High officer, enforcing the &#39;&#39;ancestral<br/>\nblade&#39;&#39; theory.<br/>\nBy the way, Gen. Yamashita&#39;s sword was of the same period... <br/>\nPlease have no trouble to refute my suggestions as I&#39;m taking this as a<br/>\nlearning session, with a lot of fun.   <br/>\nThanks for your time.<br/>\nCarlo<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Messaggio originale-----<br/>\nDa: tom helm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junkmail@...\">junkmail@...</a>] <br/>\nInviato: mercoledì 7 maggio 2003 9.06<br/>\nA: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nOggetto: Re: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword<br/>\n<br/>\nCarlo-<br/>\n\tScott has the translation so he can easily straighten us out <br/>\nand the mountings are clearly wartime production.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1150404174\">Some information (from the book I quoted) useful for you that can handle<br/>\nthe blade and see it in a proper manner :<br/>\nQuote...<br/>\nARMY KYU-GUNTO PATTERN<br/>\nThis &#39;Kyu-gunto&#39;, or proto-military sword, must have superseded the 1877<br/>\nsword patterns with the possible exception of the cavalry type. The<br/>\nintroduction date has not been established; one source suggests 1874,<br/>\nwhich must be regarded as doubtful - otherwise, the kyu-gunto would have<br/>\npreceded the 1877 patterns. Dating to the end of the nineteenth century<br/>\nis more likely. <br/>\nEarly examples are thought to have mass-produced blades but most<br/>\nsurvivors originate from the Russo-japanese War (1904-5) and usually<br/>\ndisplay hand-forged or ancestral blades. They were carried until<br/>\nsuperseded by shin-gunto in the early 1930s, though many senior officers<br/>\ncontinued to carry them during the Second World War. The hilts are<br/>\ngilt-finished brass with a small pierced obverse guard of sakura (cherry<br/>\nblossom) design and a long, thin knucklebow. The backstrap is wholly or<br/>\npartially engraved according to rank, a general officers&#39; pattern<br/>\nincorporating a kiku or chrysanthemum blossom near the pommel. The grips<br/>\nare rough or polished white same (rayskin) or, in rare cases, tortoise-<br/>\nshell -normally confined to swords of field and generai officers. Black<br/>\nsame is also sometimes found. Gilt-wire binding fills the grip grooves.<br/>\nHilts of extreme length can be found when traditional blades are<br/>\nutilised. They are retained by a removable bamboo peg, the mekugi, which<br/>\npasses through the blade tang. Swords with mass- produced blades have<br/>\nshorter hilts that may be removed by unscrewing the pommel-top nut in<br/>\nthe same manner as a &#39;parade sabre&#39;. A few hand-forged blades have been<br/>\nfound with tangs tapered and threaded far this kind of fixing. A<br/>\ndecorated press stud with a spring clip, set in the fuchi (collar),<br/>\nengages a slot in the scabbard mouth to retain the sword. Secondary<br/>\nretention by means of a leather strap and press studs is also found. The<br/>\nmetal scabbards are painted or nickel or chromium-plated, and have wood<br/>\nliners. A second (lower) ashi or suspension mount, when present, is<br/>\nnormally removable; a slot on the top of the mount slides aver the<br/>\nscabbard shoe. Contemporary photographs seem to indicate that the<br/>\ntwo-ashi sty/e was used with the two-sling full dress sword belt, while<br/>\nthe one-ashi fitting was confined to the service belt with its single<br/>\nhanger of chain or leather. Non-commissioned officers carried a similar<br/>\nsword with plain brass mounts, the backstrap often lacking the side<br/>\nears. Mass- produced blades and painted metal scabbards are prevalent.<br/>\nThere are many variations of this sword pattern, differing largely in<br/>\nquality of fittings and the amount of decoration.<br/>\n...unquote.<br/>\nAs you can read, still remain a good possibility to have found an<br/>\nancestral blade, but more details are needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Messaggio originale-----<br/>\nDa: Scott Moore [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sgmoore@...\">sgmoore@...</a>] <br/>\nInviato: martedì 6 maggio 2003 4.28<br/>\nA: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nOggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword<br/>\n<br/>\nCarlo,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Take a look at the photo of the tang that I posted.

The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>\n    blade<br/>\n<br/>\n      mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage<br/>\nto<br/>\n    get<br/>\n      it <br/>\n      cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a<br/>\nShirasaya.<br/>\n        Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.<br/>\n  Professional<br/>\n<br/>\n      polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take<br/>\ntwo<br/>\n      years <br/>\n      and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It<br/>\nwill<br/>\n      keep <br/>\n      any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>\n        I hope this helped you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Peace,<br/>\n<br/>\n      Matt<br/>\n<br/>\n      _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n      The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n      ---<br/>\n      To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Your use of Yahoo!

You truly have a treasure in your <br/>\n      possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it<br/>\n      professionally <br/>\n      cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>\n    blade<br/>\n<br/>\n      mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to<br/>\n    get<br/>\n      it <br/>\n      cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.<br/>\n        Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.<br/>\n  Professional<br/>\n<br/>\n      polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two<br/>\n      years <br/>\n      and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will<br/>\n      keep <br/>\n      any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>\n        I hope this helped you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Peace,<br/>\n<br/>\n      Matt<br/>\n<br/>\n      _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n      The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n      ---<br/>\n      To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Your use of Yahoo!

Also before the meiji era <br/>\nkatana and wakisashi(Daisho) where worn only by the samurai class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough the meiji era didn&#39;t detur the carring of swords. it was <br/>\ndurong this time that we see the rise of the tsueken cane sword. <br/>\nAnyway back to Carlos&#39;sword.( I imagine it to be his as i think he <br/>\nstarted the thread) it is an interiting peice but somethings about it <br/>\nvex me: Are there characters on the other side of the tang? I was <br/>\nunable to gleen such information from the photo&#39;s. Also where did the <br/>\ntsuka come from? it seems quite athentic but the tsuba doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\nto fit, more the elongated hand guard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully that answered more questions than it posed<br/>\n<br/>\nMeisei<br/>\n<br/>\nAtsi Kazuri</div>",

You truly have a treasure in your <br/>\n    possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it<br/>\n    professionally <br/>\n    cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>\n  blade<br/>\n<br/>\n    mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to<br/>\n  get<br/>\n    it <br/>\n    cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.<br/>\n      Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.<br/>\nProfessional<br/>\n<br/>\n    polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two<br/>\n    years <br/>\n    and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will<br/>\n    keep <br/>\n    any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>\n      I hope this helped you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Peace,<br/>\n<br/>\n    Matt<br/>\n<br/>\n    _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n    The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n    ---<br/>\n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Your use of Yahoo!

You truly have a treasure in your <br/>\n    possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it<br/>\n    professionally <br/>\n    cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>\n  blade<br/>\n<br/>\n    mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to<br/>\n  get<br/>\n    it <br/>\n    cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.<br/>\n      Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.  Professional<br/>\n<br/>\n    polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two<br/>\n    years <br/>\n    and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will<br/>\n    keep <br/>\n    any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>\n      I hope this helped you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Peace,<br/>\n<br/>\n    Matt<br/>\n<br/>\n    _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n    The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n    ---<br/>\n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Your use of Yahoo!

You truly have a treasure in your <br/>\n  possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it<br/>\n  professionally <br/>\n  cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>\nblade<br/>\n<br/>\n  mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to<br/>\nget<br/>\n  it <br/>\n  cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.<br/>\n    Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.  Professional<br/>\n<br/>\n  polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two<br/>\n  years <br/>\n  and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will<br/>\n  keep <br/>\n  any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>\n    I hope this helped you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Peace,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Matt<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!

My <br/>\nteacher told me to study swords, easy thought I, now half a lifetime <br/>\nlater I am still studying. It is a fascinating subject with something <br/>\nfor every interest. If you follow the above link you&#39;ll be taken to <br/>\nprobably the most comprehensive site on the web.<br/>\n\tDepending on where you live there are clubs and collectors <br/>\nwho will be willing to help you research your swords. There is a <br/>\n&quot;Nihontostudy&quot; group on Yahoo like this one and I of course would be <br/>\nhappy to help if I can.<br/>\nTom Helm<br/>\nmember NCJSC<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-876158171\">I am new to this group and relatively new to the fascination and <br/>\ninterest in Samurai history. I have two swords that have been in my <br/>\nfamily&#39;s possession for almost 60 years, since they returned to the <br/>\nUS with an older member of my family at the end of World War II. For <br/>\nyears I admired these swords, but only recently started to examine <br/>\nthem with a sense of their history. Certainly, a little knowledge can <br/>\nbe a dangerous thing, but every thing I learn (or think I do)leads to <br/>\nmore curiosity and questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne sword is an Army Parade Saber that I gather is relatively common <br/>\nand nothing special - except for one thing - this saber has its <br/>\noriginal tassel.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the other sword is more intriguing and of more historical <br/>\ninterest. The style is Kyu Gunto which I believe became popular <br/>\nduring the Russo/Japanese war and continued until World War II. <br/>\nRemoving the blade from the handle reveals the signature on the tang. <br/>\nThe translation I have indicates that the sword blade was forged in <br/>\nthe 17th century. More specifically, by a smith between 1681 and 1684.<br/>\nI am just fascinated by all of this - the characters on the hidden <br/>\npart of the sword blade, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long preamble, but this leads to three questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I would like to know better how to care for these swords. I know <br/>\nthis is not the proper forum for that discussion, but if anyone could <br/>\npoint me toward that information somewhere, I would appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. How common a practice was it for a military officer to take an old <br/>\nsword, maybe a family sword, and have it configured and adapted to a <br/>\nmore contemporary style?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I am interested in learning about the smith who forged this sword <br/>\nblade in the 1680&#39;s. The name was translated for me, but I have been <br/>\nunable to find information about him. He is not listed on the Samurai-<br/>\nArchives site. Can anyone give me any suggestions about searching for <br/>\ninformation about this smith?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for offering and supporting this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Moore</div>",
