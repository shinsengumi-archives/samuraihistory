I&#39;ve got one<br/>\ntranslation, but being as I haven&#39;t finished reading<br/>\nit, and certainly haven&#39;t compared it, I can&#39;t help<br/>\nyou. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Secondly, I am wondering if anyone has read Thomas<br/>\n&gt; Cleary&#39;s &#39;The Art of Japanese War&#39; (1992), and would<br/>\n&gt; like to hear your thoughts <br/>\n&gt; on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not surprisingly, I&#39;ve got strong feelings about<br/>\nCleary. I haven&#39;t read his &quot;Art of Japanese War&quot;,<br/>\nbecause his &quot;translation&quot; of Sun Zi Ping Fa (THE Art<br/>\nof War) is hideous. He&#39;s a philosophy nut, and if<br/>\nyou&#39;re looking for goofy easternish mystic<br/>\ngobbledygook, then he&#39;s your man. Unfortunately, I<br/>\ntend to think when an ancient Chinese strategist is<br/>\nwriting about war, when he writes about how to defeat<br/>\nan enemy, that&#39;s what he&#39;s talking about. Cleary takes<br/>\nit all as metaphor, expressing Taoist essence, blah<br/>\nblah blah. When the man talks about killing people,<br/>\nTom, he&#39;s talking about killing people--not moon<br/>\nviewing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nAll your favorites on one personal page ï¿½ Try My Yahoo!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.yahoo.com\">http://my.yahoo.com</a></div>",
