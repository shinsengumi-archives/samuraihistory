Taking into account recent<br/>\n&gt;research which indicates that the Oda had 1,000, not<br/>\n&gt;3,000, arquebuses, and that at most 3 ranks could have<br/>\n&gt;shot in the time it took the Takeda to move from the<br/>\n&gt;woodline, across the Rengogawa, and up to the Oda<br/>\n&gt;palisades (thus nullifying the common image of<br/>\n&gt;&quot;rotating&quot; fire mowing down the Takeda, since it<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t have actually done more than one &quot;rotation&quot;),<br/>\n&gt;Nobunaga&#39;s use of terrain is that much more<br/>\n&gt;impressive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Takeda themselves had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rifles, and I fancy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that they weren&#39;t idiotic enough to ride straight in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to a wave of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gunfire ala the Nagashino scene in &#39;Kagemusha&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No one at this time had &quot;rifles&quot;, as they hadn&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt;invented yet.

These<br/>\n&gt;weren&#39;t machine guns, or even, as I said, rifles--one<br/>\n&gt;shot, then you&#39;ve got to take a significant amount of<br/>\n&gt;time to reload. The distances involved clearly show<br/>\n&gt;that even with 3 ranks firing &quot;in rotation&quot;, at most<br/>\n&gt;each rank got one shot off before the Takeda closed<br/>\n&gt;the distance. Hardly a British gun square from the<br/>\n&gt;Zulu Wars. Ordinarily, arquebus ashigaru weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;behind palisades--at best they had nagaeyari (long<br/>\n&gt;spears) protecting them, similiar to a European pike<br/>\n&gt;and shot formation, but in 1575 this wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;necessarily standard yet. Add in the aura of the<br/>\n&gt;Takeda Cavalry, and the fact that most ashigaru<br/>\n&gt;(before Nobunaga made them a major factor in battle,<br/>\n&gt;anyways) were poorly trained and disciplined, and<br/>\n&gt;there was no real reason for the Takeda to expect they<br/>\n&gt;couldn&#39;t succeed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Katsuyori may not have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been as talented as his father, but I&#39;m sure he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t as big a fool as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he tends to get credited for either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;See above. Correct.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Still, it probably is the most famous battle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; post-Kamakura, except for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe Sekigahara, which is far more interesting in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If what you want is political repercussions, see<br/>\n&gt;Sekigahara.

Numbers aren&#39;t everything of course, and it was<br/>\ngood strategy on the Oda&#39;s part in using the terrain as they did, but to<br/>\nme it just seems that the Oda took the &quot;obvious&quot; strategy.

This comes<br/>\nfrom descriptions taken from They Came to Japan, the size of Japanese<br/>\nhorses, and comments by Prof. Karl Friday in several usenet posts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;...Add in the aura of the<br/>\n&gt;Takeda Cavalry, and the fact that most ashigaru<br/>\n&gt;(before Nobunaga made them a major factor in battle,<br/>\n&gt;anyways) were poorly trained and disciplined, and<br/>\n&gt;there was no real reason for the Takeda to expect they<br/>\n&gt;couldn&#39;t succeed. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye, I agree, I&#39;m sure they did expect to win, especially considering<br/>\nthat the Takeda and Oda both believed that the Takeda army was more<br/>\nnumerous. But it wasn&#39;t, not even close in fact, and they were<br/>\nthoroughly routed.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If what you want is political repercussions, see<br/>\n&gt;Sekigahara.

The story of how<br/>\nNobunaga learnt of the siege and came to break it is interesting, as is<br/>\nthe damage to the Takeda caused by the battle. Maybe hindsight is 20/20,<br/>\nbut the actual battle itself, once it took place, heavily favoured the<br/>\nOda and they came out on top. I don&#39;t find much interesting about it,<br/>\nbut again maybe that says more about my tastes in history than the<br/>\nbattle itself.<br/>\n <br/>\n-AngusH<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.

It was famous<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for its use of 3000 matchlock guns (muskets) by the samurai led by Oda<br/>\nNobunaga to vanquish the  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Takeda &quot;cavalry&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kind of off-topic, but to me Nagashino ranks as probably the most<br/>\noverrated battle in Japanese history. The Takeda struggled on for<br/>\nanother 7 years - albeit heavily reduced in power - and the losses<br/>\nsuffered in the battle probably had a lot more to do with Katsuyori<br/>\nbeing heavily outnumbered and in a poor strategic position than the use<br/>\nof rifles by Nobunaga. The Takeda themselves had rifles, and I fancy<br/>\nthat they weren&#39;t idiotic enough to ride straight in to a wave of<br/>\ngunfire ala the Nagashino scene in &#39;Kagemusha&#39;. Katsuyori may not have<br/>\nbeen as talented as his father, but I&#39;m sure he wasn&#39;t as big a fool as<br/>\nhe tends to get credited for either.<br/>\n <br/>\nStill, it probably is the most famous battle post-Kamakura, except for<br/>\nmaybe Sekigahara, which is far more interesting in my opinion.<br/>\n <br/>\n-AngusH<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
