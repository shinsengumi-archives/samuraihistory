Her names appears in <br/>\nhistorical sources<br/>\nas Ine, Oine, Komatsudono and Dairenin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bio provided by Koei and the game give you an impression that she <br/>\ntook a bow<br/>\nherself but she just ordered to attack her father-in-law&#39;s army as proxy <br/>\nfor her<br/>\nhusband.  Real Inahime seems not to be a brave archer but a lady of wisdom.<br/>\nWhen her husband (Eastern Sanada) sieged Ueda castle, where the Western <br/>\nSanada<br/>\nhad defended,  she invited the defender&#39;s families into her castle on an <br/>\nexcuse of<br/>\nprotecting  weak people and offer her hospitaility to them.  This deed <br/>\nfunctioned<br/>\nin two ways; taking hostages and decreasing casualities in divided <br/>\nSanada clan<br/>\nand its vassals.  And she was so uncompromising that she mentiond her <br/>\nthought<br/>\ndirectly even to Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Hidetada TOKUGAWA.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Inahime&#39;s tomb at Housenji, Sanada Town, Ueda city, Nagano pref.<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2.pf-x.net/~sanraku/shinano04/images/0014.htm\">http://www2.pf-x.net/~sanraku/shinano04/images/0014.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n*Other tomb at Shougakuji, Numata city, Nagano pref.<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kotatujo.cool.ne.jp/Image/tawagoto/2005-01/P9260061.jpg\">http://kotatujo.cool.ne.jp/Image/tawagoto/2005-01/P9260061.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n*Other tomb(the right) at Shouganji, Kounosu city (where she died), <br/>\nSaitama pref.<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.jp/wind_of_hometown/image/syohgan_ji11.jpg\">http://www.geocities.jp/wind_of_hometown/image/syohgan_ji11.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n*Reference<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~jt7t-imfk/taiandir/x149.html\">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~jt7t-imfk/taiandir/x149.html</a></div>",
