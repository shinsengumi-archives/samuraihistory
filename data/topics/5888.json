Tres your background sound really interesting, will read <br/>\nup on both the Arapaho and Pima cultures as I know next to nothing <br/>\nabout them. Dave your family has a coat of arms that so cool. So with <br/>\nluck you could trace your history back to the medieval times. <br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be something if you found that your family was actually <br/>\npart royalty? If you can give me a picture of you family coat of arms <br/>\nI would be very grateful, would also like to look into this if that <br/>\nok with you. <br/>\nI spoke to my Uncle (Mothers side) last night about a family tree <br/>\nthat he had put together quite sometime ago, I have never see it so I <br/>\nasked him to send me a copy. This will be my starting point and with <br/>\nthis I hope to be able to learn more about my ancestors and culture. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone in my Fathers side has done a family tree yet so <br/>\nmy brother and I are looking into this at the moment. Maybe that&#39;s <br/>\nsomething you both could look into, maybe someone in your family has <br/>\nalready done a family tree or maybe you will need to start the ball <br/>\nrolling. Anyways good luck and let us know how you go.<br/>\n<br/>\nZev</div>",
