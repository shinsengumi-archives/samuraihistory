FRAZIER<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Read between your paragraphs for responses:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Alexander M. Frazier<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; KUMO ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you ten years old?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * What is wrong with ten year olds?<br/>\n&gt; ** Nothing if you ARE ten years old. If you are a grown man acting like a<br/>\nten year old, there is a big problem with it in adult society.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you disagree with someone, so be it, but that was the rudest display<br/>\nof adolescent behavior I have seen in a very long time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Show some respect.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; People from various martial arts are passed verbal transmissions of<br/>\ntheir &quot;history&quot; and the reasons for various traditions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; revolving around that art.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As mentioned in this diatribe, I am a student of Aikido. Daito ryu more<br/>\nspecifically. In our art, the hakama is gifted to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shodan. It is believed by our shihan that the hakama was worn for both<br/>\nceremony and ease of movement for combat in an &quot;in-house&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; circumstance. In another art there may have been different traditions or<br/>\ncircumstances surrounding its use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Who questioned another ryu&#39;s use of the Hakama? NO-ONE.<br/>\n** Let me just quote you on this one first. &quot;Did you invent the Hakama and<br/>\ndevise it&#39;s uses? I believe that you didn&#39;t. You only know of it&#39;s uses<br/>\ninside Budo as you learn it, and are in no position to comment on any other<br/>\narts uses of the hakama.&quot;<br/>\n** What I had to say was not intended or designed to question anything. You<br/>\nslammed him for expressing what he was taught, and I was trying to show that<br/>\ndifferent arts are taught different things. He wasn&#39;t wrong by having<br/>\nincomplete information. You, on the other hand, were very wrong in being so<br/>\nrude about it as though you were the authority on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, regardless of any one teaching, you must consider the fact that<br/>\nthe hakama was Japanese<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Who said that the Hakama wasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t Japanese? NO-ONE.<br/>\n** Lovely how you broke this sentence in half to twist its meaning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not the tool of martial arts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * And how do you then account for it&#39;s additional and specific uses in the<br/>\narts?<br/>\n** I account for it the same way I account for Indians discovering the added<br/>\nbonus of a warm pelt after eating the buffalo. The Japanese wore it, and<br/>\nwonder of wonders, it was really easy to move in it. Go figure.<br/>\n&gt; * It is in fact BOTH, Japanese and a TOOL of the arts.<br/>\n&gt; * You seem to have missed this.<br/>\n&gt; ** It IS both, but it may not necessarily have ALWAYS been both.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It was worn by practitioners and &quot;lay&quot; folk alike.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Who said that it wasn&#39;t worn by many kinds of people? NO-ONE.<br/>\n** By bringing up the point that everyone wore them, I was simply showing<br/>\nthat it was not designed for any specific martial purpose. It was a garment.<br/>\nAnd your comments as referenced above were unnecessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Martial arts all stemmed from India and developed into numerous styles<br/>\nover many generations throughout all of the orient, taking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on various characteristics by each major clan and teacher. The hakama<br/>\nwas just a garment that simply followed the Japanese during<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their day, and when one clan broke from another ... or one family<br/>\ndivided and became two ... when they moved on they took their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hakamas with them. Perhaps after the fact each determined that it had<br/>\ncertain combative attributes. Who can truly say?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Hmmmmm, I don&#39;t know..... maybe the GRAND MASTERS?<br/>\n** Another childish response.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know that YOU weren&#39;t there any more than Eric was, so certainly you<br/>\ncan&#39;t answer the question with any more authority than he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Who questioned Mr. Baker&#39;s authority on the use of the Hakama? NO-ONE.<br/>\n** Ummm, you did! Let me go ahead and quote you again. &quot;Did you invent the<br/>\nHakama and devise it&#39;s uses? I believe that you didn&#39;t. You only know of<br/>\nit&#39;s uses inside Budo as you learn it, and are in no position to comment on<br/>\nany other arts uses of the hakama.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In any case, people have different reasons for the things they think and<br/>\nbelieve, and not all of it is rootless. Unless YOU<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are the expert on all these matters, which I do not believe you are, try<br/>\nto have a little sensitivity in rebuking information you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BELIEVE is incorrect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Next time you feel the need to go on, ...and on, ...and on about things<br/>\nthat you have no clue about, Don&#39;t. Supress the need to BE<br/>\n&gt; * WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING IN YOUR E-MAIL THAT YOU ACCUSE ME OF.<br/>\n** Seems to me that I was right on target about everything I had to say. You<br/>\nshould consider being a writer. They are all touchy and critical like you,<br/>\nand they love rebutting criticism over even a single word.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Included is a copy of my e-mail to Mr. Baker. Please re-read it, as you<br/>\npaid no attention to it last time, and must have been<br/>\n&gt; * looking slightly off-screen while typing, looking at the television or<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n&gt; * THEN, when you understand what I was expressing, please e-mail me<br/>\nprivately, because I would hope that you do not<br/>\n&gt; * enjoy embarrassing yourself any more than you have on this matter.<br/>\n** Here is my email <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:punish10@...\">punish10@...</a><br/>\n** If you choose to stop making a fool of YOURself and choose to rebut<br/>\nprivately, I will be happy to discuss things in more detail on a personal<br/>\nbasis. However, you are crazy if you think you are going attempt to demean<br/>\nme on a public message and not get a worthy response of a like kind. Most<br/>\nespecially when it all stemmed from your rude message to another member of<br/>\nthis message group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Alex<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * AGAIN, THIS IS THE LAST ON THIS MATTER. YOU SEEMED TO HAVE MISSSED THAT<br/>\nLAST TIME.<br/>\n&gt; * AND MY INVITATION TO E-MAIL ME PRIVATELY.<br/>\n&gt; * IT IS HOPED THAT IN CAPS IT WILL BE HARDER TO OVERLOOK THIS TIME.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kumo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Natsu-gusa ya<br/>\n&gt; Tsuamono-domo ga<br/>\n&gt; yume no ato<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Basho Matsuo.<br/>\n&gt;   (1644 - 1694)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Flollowing is my e-mail to Mr. Baker.<br/>\n&gt; =========================<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: KUM0<br/>\n&gt; Subject: The ignorant<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Mr. Baker,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am sorry<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Do not be sorry, for you cannot change. And would not where it even for<br/>\nthe better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years of my life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * A commendable time spent learning. Kudos.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have to disagree.  There are all kinds of ideas that the Hakama was<br/>\nworn to disguise movement or position.  This is simply not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; true.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Did you invent the Hakama and devise it&#39;s uses? I believe that you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t. You only know of it&#39;s uses inside Budo as you learn it,<br/>\n&gt; * and are in no position to comment on any other arts uses of the hakama.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Samurai when going in to combat without armor preffered to were<br/>\nthere hakama tucked up some under the Obi.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * As does anybody with an ounce of common sense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This allowed full movement without tripping on the hakama itself.(anyone<br/>\nwho practices Aikido has had this happen)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * I agree. This I have seen for myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When wearing armor they didn&#39;t even wear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hakama so it did not apply.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * However, I don&#39;t believe that this paragraph has anything atall to do<br/>\nwith the subject matter being discussed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Word &quot;ninja&quot; is not hstorically correct and neither is their movie<br/>\nincarnation.  They were usually reffered to as Shinobi and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; originally were not as specialized as the movies make them appear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They were used to set fire to enemy encampments and castles in order to<br/>\ncause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they would be employed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to kill.  But I have heard of very few if any cases with the latter.  A<br/>\ngood book on the subject of the origin and truths behind<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ninja&quot; is Stephen Turnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold of<br/>\nand has to be ordered from Europe but is worth the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; price.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are alot of myths regarding the history of the Martial arts.(Ninja<br/>\nEspecially)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Who mentioned movies? Who mentioned historically correct details<br/>\nregarding the ninja? How would you be an authority on the ninja?<br/>\n&gt; * You study Budo by your own admission. It is very rude by every cultures<br/>\nbeliefs to denounce that of which you are ignorant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * And ignorant of such matters you are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Whether the term &quot;Ninja&quot; appeared in Japan  _ever_  is no matter.<br/>\nNowdays it is an accepted layman&#39;s term. Whether you like it or<br/>\n&gt; * not. And the world will use it without you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * I have respect for the way of Bu, but not for you, because you are<br/>\nignorant, and have no respect for anything but your own<br/>\n&gt; * &quot;knowledge&quot;. Of which you probably know nothing outside of Budo<br/>\nteachings, and the odd bit of book reading here or there by<br/>\n&gt; authors<br/>\n&gt; * who are also no authority on the subjects which they publish books on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * That is my last comment on the matter on the list, if you wish to<br/>\ncomment youself, which you no doubt would accept to do without<br/>\n&gt; * thought, then you have my e-mail address and have my invitation to mail<br/>\nme personally for any reason.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

FRAZIER<br/>\n<br/>\nRead between your paragraphs for responses:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Alexander M. Frazier<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; KUMO ...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Are you ten years old?<br/>\n<br/>\n* What is wrong with ten year olds?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If you disagree with someone, so be it, but that was the rudest display of adolescent behavior I have seen in a very long time.<br/>\n&gt; Show some respect.<br/>\n&gt; People from various martial arts are passed verbal transmissions of their &quot;history&quot; and the reasons for various traditions<br/>\n&gt; revolving around that art.<br/>\n&gt; As mentioned in this diatribe, I am a student of Aikido. Daito ryu more specifically. In our art, the hakama is gifted to a<br/>\n&gt; shodan. It is believed by our shihan that the hakama was worn for both ceremony and ease of movement for combat in an &quot;in-house&quot;<br/>\n&gt; circumstance. In another art there may have been different traditions or circumstances surrounding its use.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Who questioned another ryu&#39;s use of the Hakama? NO-ONE.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; However, regardless of any one teaching, you must consider the fact that the hakama was Japanese<br/>\n<br/>\n* Who said that the Hakama wasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t Japanese? NO-ONE.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; not the tool of martial arts.<br/>\n<br/>\n* And how do you then account for it&#39;s additional and specific uses in the arts?<br/>\n* It is in fact BOTH, Japanese and a TOOL of the arts.<br/>\n* You seem to have missed this.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It was worn by practitioners and &quot;lay&quot; folk alike.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Who said that it wasn&#39;t worn by many kinds of people? NO-ONE.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Martial arts all stemmed from India and developed into numerous styles over many generations throughout all of the orient, taking<br/>\n&gt; on various characteristics by each major clan and teacher. The hakama was just a garment that simply followed the Japanese during<br/>\n&gt; their day, and when one clan broke from another ... or one family divided and became two ... when they moved on they took their<br/>\n&gt; hakamas with them. Perhaps after the fact each determined that it had certain combative attributes. Who can truly say?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Hmmmmm, I don&#39;t know..... maybe the GRAND MASTERS?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I know that YOU weren&#39;t there any more than Eric was, so certainly you can&#39;t answer the question with any more authority than he<br/>\n&gt; could.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Who questioned Mr. Baker&#39;s authority on the use of the Hakama? NO-ONE.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In any case, people have different reasons for the things they think and believe, and not all of it is rootless. Unless YOU<br/>\n&gt; are the expert on all these matters, which I do not believe you are, try to have a little sensitivity in rebuking information you<br/>\n&gt; BELIEVE is incorrect.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Next time you feel the need to go on, ...and on, ...and on about things that you have no clue about, Don&#39;t. Supress the need to BE<br/>\n* WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING IN YOUR E-MAIL THAT YOU ACCUSE ME OF.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Included is a copy of my e-mail to Mr. Baker. Please re-read it, as you paid no attention to it last time, and must have been<br/>\n* looking slightly off-screen while typing, looking at the television or something.<br/>\n* THEN, when you understand what I was expressing, please e-mail me privately, because I would hope that you do not<br/>\n* enjoy embarrassing yourself any more than you have on this matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Alex<br/>\n<br/>\n* AGAIN, THIS IS THE LAST ON THIS MATTER. YOU SEEMED TO HAVE MISSSED THAT LAST TIME.<br/>\n* AND MY INVITATION TO E-MAIL ME PRIVATELY.<br/>\n* IT IS HOPED THAT IN CAPS IT WILL BE HARDER TO OVERLOOK THIS TIME.<br/>\n<br/>\nKumo.<br/>\n<br/>\nNatsu-gusa ya<br/>\nTsuamono-domo ga<br/>\nyume no ato<br/>\n<br/>\n- Basho Matsuo.<br/>\n  (1644 - 1694)<br/>\n<br/>\nFlollowing is my e-mail to Mr. Baker.<br/>\n=========================<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: KUM0<br/>\nSubject: The ignorant<br/>\n<br/>\n* Mr. Baker,<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I am sorry<br/>\n<br/>\n* Do not be sorry, for you cannot change. And would not where it even for the better.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\n* A commendable time spent learning. Kudos.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have to disagree.  There are all kinds of ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise movement or position.  This is simply not<br/>\n&gt; true.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Did you invent the Hakama and devise it&#39;s uses? I believe that you didn&#39;t. You only know of it&#39;s uses inside Budo as you learn it,<br/>\n* and are in no position to comment on any other arts uses of the hakama.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The Samurai when going in to combat without armor preffered to were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.<br/>\n<br/>\n* As does anybody with an ounce of common sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This allowed full movement without tripping on the hakama itself.(anyone who practices Aikido has had this happen)<br/>\n<br/>\n* I agree. This I have seen for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When wearing armor they didn&#39;t even wear<br/>\n&gt; hakama so it did not apply.<br/>\n<br/>\n* However, I don&#39;t believe that this paragraph has anything atall to do with the subject matter being discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The Word &quot;ninja&quot; is not hstorically correct and neither is their movie incarnation.  They were usually reffered to as Shinobi and<br/>\n&gt; originally were not as specialized as the movies make them appear.<br/>\n&gt; They were used to set fire to enemy encampments and castles in order to cause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they would be employed<br/>\n&gt; to kill.  But I have heard of very few if any cases with the latter.  A good book on the subject of the origin and truths behind<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Ninja&quot; is Stephen Turnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold of and has to be ordered from Europe but is worth the<br/>\n&gt; price.<br/>\n&gt; There are alot of myths regarding the history of the Martial arts.(Ninja Especially)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Who mentioned movies? Who mentioned historically correct details regarding the ninja? How would you be an authority on the ninja?<br/>\n* You study Budo by your own admission. It is very rude by every cultures beliefs to denounce that of which you are ignorant.<br/>\n<br/>\n* And ignorant of such matters you are.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Whether the term &quot;Ninja&quot; appeared in Japan  _ever_  is no matter. Nowdays it is an accepted layman&#39;s term. Whether you like it or<br/>\n* not. And the world will use it without you.<br/>\n<br/>\n* I have respect for the way of Bu, but not for you, because you are ignorant, and have no respect for anything but your own<br/>\n* &quot;knowledge&quot;. Of which you probably know nothing outside of Budo teachings, and the odd bit of book reading here or there by<br/>\nauthors<br/>\n* who are also no authority on the subjects which they publish books on.<br/>\n<br/>\n* That is my last comment on the matter on the list, if you wish to comment youself, which you no doubt would accept to do without<br/>\n* thought, then you have my e-mail address and have my invitation to mail me personally for any reason. </span></blockquote></div>",
