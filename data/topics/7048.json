I just <br/>\nreread the introduction and was struck again by the description of the <br/>\nmeeting of the veterans of Changi in Tokyo. There seems to be such a <br/>\nsilence on what the Japanese actually did, saw and experienced first <br/>\nhand in SE Asia - there are many Australian histories and memoirs of <br/>\nBurma, Thailand, New Guinea etc, which make agonising reading. It <br/>\nalways seems to me one of the great tragedies of a tragic war (&quot;the war <br/>\nwithout mercy&quot;):  the Japanese could have liberated Asia from <br/>\ncolonialism (well, they did effectively), but for most nations the <br/>\nliberator was worse than the coloniser, and the lingering results still <br/>\ncolour foreign policy in the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Just celebrated ANZAC day here in Australia, so there&#39;s been a lot of <br/>\nmedia coverage of war)<br/>\n<br/>\nGillian</div>",
