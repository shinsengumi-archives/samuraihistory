I live in Tokyo and <br/>\nusually go to the antiquarian booksellers district at least once a week and I have never <br/>\nseen anything similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnders R<br/>\nTokyo<br/>\nPS. Auction description:<br/>\n*Artist: Teijo<br/>\n*Format: Ehon: 9.75&quot; x 6.5&quot;<br/>\n*Subject: This type of book was never printed, but always hand written and copied from <br/>\ngeneration to generation as the information therein was considered strategically sensitive <br/>\nand secret not to be disseminated outside the Samurai class. Also the books often <br/>\ncontained details of family secrets in warfare. Few complete copies have survived.<br/>\n*Date: c. 1820<br/>\n*Condition: Full size. Some light creases and wear. Generally very good state.</div>",
