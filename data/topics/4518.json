All things that the Japanese shared. Actually few places in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the world were (and are) as homogeneous as Japan.<br/>\n&gt; That is wrong! All small portions of Japan was small countries with <br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; independence and own emperator as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Uh? The only native minority in Japan were the Ainu, who were tamed <br/>\nwell before Nobunaga came on the scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The first one who dreamt to have one nation and perhaps one world (for <br/>\n&gt; these<br/>\n&gt; people, Japan was the entire world) was the Emperator Yamato, that <br/>\n&gt; unlike<br/>\n&gt; Nobunaga, had peaceful goals and intentions in his heart.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To quote him (Yamato Emperor, NOT Nobunaga)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;On the earth there ins´t earth portions marked with lines and <br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt; colours like a map. Why people of these earth portions had to fight <br/>\n&gt; each<br/>\n&gt; others when the earth is only one?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where is this citation from, and what is the date?<br/>\nAnd more than this, who is this &quot;Yamato Emperor&quot; ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So, he did exactly the same, including genocide against people who<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; disagreed<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with him or hated religions... Just like Hitler...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, wait a minute... Do you have an idea of what the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Holocaust was? Hitler killed 5.7 million people simply because they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; belonged to a race, or because he considered them inferiors. They were<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not people on his path, he sent out over half of Europe his Gestapo <br/>\n&gt;&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; special extermination squads to get them, and to murder them. Hitler&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;final solution,&quot; the ultimate decision of killing ALL Jewish, is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; something you can not compare with Nobunaga&#39;s will to unify Japan at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; all costs. Nobunaga did not build concentration camps where thousands<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of people were killed every day after they were exploited as slaves.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And besides that, Nobunaga was born in the middle of a civil war, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; while<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hitler started a World War... How can you compare them? Hitler lived<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 400 years later than Nobunaga, in a different continent, and in a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; totally different contest.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you can speculate that, given the chance, Nobunaga would have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; done as bad as Hitler, but... ***speculate*** that&#39;s it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; History is a different matter. IMHO.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cepo<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oooooo.... Very different contest...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hitler attempted to reunify the &quot;old Sacred German Empire&quot; that never<br/>\n&gt; existed in history. Always when certain portions of his ideal map are <br/>\n&gt; in the<br/>\n&gt; hands of germans, other portions was independent. Some would say that <br/>\n&gt; he did<br/>\n&gt; attempted to do with the entire world what the bastard of Nobunaga <br/>\n&gt; attempted<br/>\n&gt; with Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly. The world and Japan are two different entities, and thus the <br/>\ncontexts are indeed different.<br/>\nNot to mention (again) that there were some 400 years of between <br/>\nNobunaga and Hitler, and that to start a war and to continue it is not <br/>\nthe same, like it is not the same to raze a few villages and to build <br/>\nconcentration camps for systematic extermination.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hitler killed jews not due to racist motivations only, but also <br/>\n&gt; religious,<br/>\n&gt; he also prosecuted gypsies, homosexuals and even germans who didn´t <br/>\n&gt; agreed<br/>\n&gt; with his policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So...?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And... Although this is offtopic, Cesar, you may criticise my History <br/>\n&gt; View<br/>\n&gt; Points as much as ye want, but was not any non-christian religion who <br/>\n&gt; always<br/>\n&gt; was conspiring to change history logs, doing adulteration and <br/>\n&gt; falsification<br/>\n&gt; on the documents, such as what whas done with certain doccuments by <br/>\n&gt; Taccitus<br/>\n&gt; and others to &quot;prove&quot; that Jesus existed. As well, to accuse several <br/>\n&gt; others<br/>\n&gt; religions (including judaism) of &quot;human sacrifice&quot; and all the same <br/>\n&gt; rant as<br/>\n&gt; aways.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The japanese remember very well their history. Thanks to Tokugawa <br/>\n&gt; again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...............<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And although I am not a communist...<br/>\n&gt; &quot;the people who don´t know their true history deeply, are fated to <br/>\n&gt; repeat it<br/>\n&gt; in circles&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Mao Tse Tung<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and again...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Don´t go around spreading<br/>\n&gt; that I am telling lies.<br/>\n&gt; Stand up and PROVE I am wrong.<br/>\n&gt; The History of the Church<br/>\n&gt; is full of conspirations of ambition and power&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Goetche<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; that´s all<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho<br/>\n&gt; São Paulo - SP Brasil<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry, I have NO IDEA of what are you trying to prove with these <br/>\ncitations above and the discourse on Tacitus etc. Actually, -again, I <br/>\napologize- I have no idea of what you are talking about. I thought the <br/>\ndiscussion was about the utility or the futility to compare Nobunaga <br/>\nand Hitler. Have I miss something?<br/>\n<br/>\ncepo</div>",
