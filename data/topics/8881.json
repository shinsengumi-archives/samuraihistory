It was OK to keep the shoto in the obi<br/>\nas a samurai would never be totally unarmed. Dependant on which side the<br/>\nlong  sword was placed indicated the state of preparedness. Basically, if<br/>\nremoved from the obi and placed on your right-hand side, this was taken as<br/>\nbeing relaxed and no threat. If on the left hand side, then a greater level<br/>\nof preparedness was indicated, but precisely how it was placed, upped the<br/>\nlevel. For instance if the back of the sword was closest to your left side,<br/>\nthis was less intimidating than if the curve was away from you as, in this<br/>\ncircumstance, it would be unnecessary to turn the sword before drawing it.<br/>\nThis could seem quite a threatening position. Further, if the left thumb had<br/>\npushed the tsuba so that the habaki (collar) was clear of the koi-guchi<br/>\n(scabbard mouth), then this was most threatening and meant that the owner<br/>\nwas fully anticipating that he would need to draw his sword! If he then<br/>\nraised up onto his toes, coming out of the &quot;safe&quot; seiza position, he was<br/>\nabout to fight.<br/>\nSword etiquette was very important to the samurai as usually nobody wanted<br/>\naccidentally to become involved in situations where blood was shed. It is<br/>\nprobable that the rules of etiquette were refined and structured in the<br/>\nTogugawa period where the only action likely to occur was in a one-on-one<br/>\nsituation, but here I speculate somewhat. Rules of sword etiquette  still<br/>\napplies today although the bloody consequences of poor etiquette are less<br/>\nlikely, however, good etiquette shows the difference between the educated<br/>\ngentlemen and the less well educated. It is unlikely that you will be able<br/>\nto view important swords in Japan (on a hands-on basis) such as National<br/>\nTreasures etc.unless you have already shown that you fall into the &quot;educated<br/>\ngentleman&quot; catagory.<br/>\nAs for No-dachi, I guess they can do whatever they want!! although more<br/>\nseriously, I prefer a katana-kake as oversized swords are less well balanced<br/>\non a tachi-kake.<br/>\nClive Sinclaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dean Wayland&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean@...\">dean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 17, 2006 6:12 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] SWORD SETS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi Clive,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the feedback. You also wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Also interesting are the various positions in which a katana is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    placed on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    the floor at one&#39;s side when kneeling in front of another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can hazard a few guesses at what would be involved, but I would be<br/>\n&gt; very interested to hear what would have been the correct practise in<br/>\n&gt; this circumstance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also on the topic of mounting tachi on a tachi-kake, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    incorrect<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    as is often seen, for the tsuka to be at the top when placed on a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    proper<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    tachi stand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I owned but one sword, my other half bought me a tachi-kake to<br/>\n&gt; display it. I was aware at the time of how to correctly use it, but out<br/>\n&gt; of curiosity I experimented with mounting it the wrong way round, to see<br/>\n&gt; if I could deduce the reasoning behind the practise. I found two things,<br/>\n&gt; (a) the end of the saya (kojiri?) would try to escape from the small<br/>\n&gt; indentation in the base, and (b) due to the point of balance being<br/>\n&gt; somewhat higher than it should be, the sword was easily dislodged.<br/>\n&gt; Needless to say ever since, I&#39;ve always done as you previously outlined.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Incidentally would I be right in thinking that a large weapon like a no-<br/>\n&gt; dachi/ou-dachi would also be displayed on a tachi-kake?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yours<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dean<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***<br/>\n&gt; Dean Wayland<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

You also wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Also interesting are the various positions in which a katana is <br/>\n&gt;    placed on<br/>\n&gt;    the floor at one&#39;s side when kneeling in front of another.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can hazard a few guesses at what would be involved, but I would be<br/>\nvery interested to hear what would have been the correct practise in<br/>\nthis circumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso on the topic of mounting tachi on a tachi-kake, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is <br/>\n&gt;    incorrect<br/>\n&gt;    as is often seen, for the tsuka to be at the top when placed on a <br/>\n&gt;    proper<br/>\n&gt;    tachi stand.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When I owned but one sword, my other half bought me a tachi-kake to<br/>\ndisplay it. I was aware at the time of how to correctly use it, but out<br/>\nof curiosity I experimented with mounting it the wrong way round, to see<br/>\nif I could deduce the reasoning behind the practise. I found two things,<br/>\n(a) the end of the saya (kojiri?) would try to escape from the small<br/>\nindentation in the base, and (b) due to the point of balance being<br/>\nsomewhat higher than it should be, the sword was easily dislodged.<br/>\nNeedless to say ever since, I&#39;ve always done as you previously outlined.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally would I be right in thinking that a large weapon like a no-<br/>\ndachi/ou-dachi would also be displayed on a tachi-kake?<br/>\n<br/>\nYours<br/>\n<br/>\nDean<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nDean Wayland</div>",

A tachi, if on an ordinary<br/>\n&gt;katana-kake is place with the cutting edge downwards so that it also<br/>\n&gt;simulates the position when worn. More often and more correctly, a tachi is<br/>\n&gt;placed on a different type of rack so that it can stand vertically, with <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;tsuka (handle) resting in a small indentation on the base. It is incorrect<br/>\n&gt;as is often seen, for the tsuka to be at the top when placed on a proper<br/>\n&gt;tachi stand.<br/>\n&gt;Regards<br/>\n&gt;Clive<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Dean Wayland&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean@...\">dean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, June 16, 2006 2:59 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] SWORD SETS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Clive,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A daisho on a katana-kake is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    normally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    with the katana on the top and the wakizashi at the bottom, to make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    easier to pick up the katana in an emergency, in those days when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    things mattered.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Was there any customary significance to the weapons orientation when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; displayed on a kake?

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1225887409\">Not sure if I 100% agree with that. A daisho on a katana-kake is normally<br/>\nwith the katana on the top and the wakizashi at the bottom, to make it<br/>\neasier to pick up the katana in an emergency, in those days when these<br/>\nthings mattered. Sometimes the shoto of a daisho is a tanto and this is more<br/>\nusual if the daito is a tachi, but it can be a tanto with a katana. How<br/>\nswords were displayed on their racks in a samurai household would indicate<br/>\nto any visitor the state of preparedness of the occupants and so it was an<br/>\nimportant part of sword etiquette. Also I would certainly not describe a<br/>\ntanto as &quot;a small utilitarian knife more of a tool than a weapon&quot;. Tanto are<br/>\nmade in the same manner as other swords and are as magnificent as any other<br/>\nblades, just smaller. They are certainly classed as a weapon and count<br/>\nNational Treasures amongst their number, some of which date back to the<br/>\nKamakura period and even earlier.<br/>\nI may be misunderstanding the original question, but I have never, as far as<br/>\nI can remember seen, 3 matching swords other than in the realm of cheap<br/>\nmodern reproductions.<br/>\nI hope this does not contradict the samurai history subject of this list,<br/>\nbut I felt the points worth noting.<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nClive Sinclaire<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;federico trejos&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:federicotrejos@...\">federicotrejos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2006 3:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] SWORD SETS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good morning.<br/>\n&gt; In a kake in that fashion usually the first blade from<br/>\n&gt; up to down is the shortest one and is called &quot;Tanto&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; A small utilitarian knife, more a tool than a weapon.<br/>\n&gt; But it does not mean that it could not be used as the<br/>\n&gt; second.
