Westmoreland, for losing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are any number of ways to answer your question,<br/>\ndepending on what you are looking for. Do you want to<br/>\nknow about samurai who were particularly good<br/>\nduelists? Try Miyamoto Musashi, Tsukuhara Bokuden, or<br/>\nKamiizumi Nobutsuna. Great Samurai Generals? Try Oda<br/>\nNobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu,<br/>\nMinamoto Yoshitsune, Minamoto Yoshinaka, Takeda<br/>\nShingen, Uesugi Kenshin, Date Masamune, Mori Motonari,<br/>\nAshikaga Takauji, Nitta Yoshisada, Kusunoki Masashige,<br/>\nTaira Kiyomori....and on, and on...and on....<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai who were famous for loyalty? Yamanaka<br/>\nShikanosuke, the 47 Ronin (look under &quot;Chushingura&quot;),<br/>\nHashiba/Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Benkei, Shimizu Muneharu,<br/>\nThe Tsuchiya family, etc., etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai who were famous for being inept or for not<br/>\nbeing loyal, etc: Akechi Mitsuhide, any of the<br/>\nAshikaga after Yoshinori, The Akamatsu, Matsunaga<br/>\nHisahide and Miyoshi Nagayoshi, Anayama Baisetsu...<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai who were most often the subject of<br/>\nmovies/plays/TV shows/Manga/anime? Wow...way too many<br/>\nto list.<br/>\n<br/>\nRefine your question and you&#39;ll get plenty of<br/>\nopinions, probably all conflicting, but at least it<br/>\nwill give you an idea of where to look. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
