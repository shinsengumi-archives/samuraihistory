I had believed that bronze - a mixture of 90% copper and 10% tin - was the preferred metal used for the casting of cannon. Although cast-iron cannon became available ca 1550, these were much more difficult to cast, and bronze remained the metal of choice until the mid to late C17. Since the &#39;De Liefde&#39; arrived in Kyushu in 1600, is it not highly likely that its cannon were of bronze rather than of iron? Is there an expert on cannon out there somewhere who can clarify this point for me? Regards, John L.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThe cannon on the &#39;De Liefde&#39; were indeed made out of bronze. This was verfied by a cargo manifest prepared by a Jesuit that was sent on board to inspect the ship. </span></blockquote></div>",
