As in any warrior class or <br/>\nmilitary group; you have both good and bead individuals.  There were <br/>\nsome Samurai that intimidated and murdered.  There were others that <br/>\nwe well known for being sophisticated and artful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is difficult to say that Samurai affected Japanese Society because <br/>\nthey were very much a product of society.  Japanese society today <br/>\nstill has some &quot;Samurai&quot; values incorperated and ingrained in their <br/>\nimage as individuals and society accepted group behavior.  I&#39;m not an <br/>\nexpert but even after the Meiji Restoration (when the Emperor crushed <br/>\nthe Samurai class and returned Military power to the throne) Samurai <br/>\nvalues were still important to the Japanese.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted to talk about the ways that Samurai values have <br/>\nsurvived into modern Japan, I&#39;d discuss the ideas of honor, chivalry, <br/>\nservice, and ferocity in battle(in the business world now).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Samurai were a wide and varied class of warriors.  There were low <br/>\nClass Ashigaru to the very high class Nobles.  But I think that the <br/>\nconditions the Japanese were subjected to caused a unique <br/>\nspecialization of the feudal system.  The harsh weather, constent <br/>\ninternal military conflict, and repeated invasion attempts, changed <br/>\nthe Samurai and Japanese culture both.  They can&#39;t quite be seperated <br/>\nbecause the occured simultaniously.  To simplify; until the lat 1800s <br/>\n(Meiji Restoration) they were the same.  Samurai ruled the society at <br/>\nthat time and the Samurai Culture was Japanese Culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In samuraihistory@y..., eraysir@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your reply.<br/>\n&gt; After agreeing to help my son with this, I found myself lost in <br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n&gt; I was dumbfounded.<br/>\n&gt; I asked him what kind of evil teacher would give a child a task <br/>\nlike this.<br/>\n&gt; He said &quot;I just made up the subject myself&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Everything in the world has a reason.
