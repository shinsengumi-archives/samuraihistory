            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-389628216\">Hi Gabs<br/>\n<br/>\nWill Adams is an interesting subject, not only was he reputed to be the first North European on Japanese soil and that he became Samurai but he wrote a number of letters describing his &quot;adventure&quot; and many survived... You can view one at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1611adams-japan.html\">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1611adams-japan.html</a> although this has been &quot;cleaned&quot; to make it readable. There are many books detailing his life based on the letters as well as Faction Novels (such as Clavell&#39;s Shogun) and more than a few fictional works. Apart from various sources for copies of his letters, I have an early &quot;Romantic Biography&quot; published 1860 - entitled &quot;Will Adams, The First Englishman in Japan&quot; by William Dalton. Dalton &quot;fills-in&quot; between the letters and with some other sources makes quite an entertaining read. Will Adams is also covered in one of the chapters in Herbert H. Gowen&#39;s work &quot;Five Foreigners in Japan&quot; which is quite a factual approach... As an aside, one of the other chapters relates to a native american (although born under the British Flag) visiting Japan in 1848, he was named - Ranald MacDonald. - worth many hours of fun on that name!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to Clavell.... There was a book published on the making of the film &quot;Shogun&quot;... &quot;The Making of James Clavell&#39;s Shogun&quot; ISBN 0 340 26155 2, which gives a fascinating insight into the novel and the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding other foreigners... Papinot lists many &quot;principal foreigners&quot; in his supplement to his &quot;Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan&quot; but none appear to have been accepted into japanese society as samurai. Most appear to have lost their lives in one or other tortuous ways!! <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with the searching,<br/>\n<br/>\n                                            Rod Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: gabriel d gabaya <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, December 03, 2002 9:47 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] will adams...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you think that Will Adams was the real life model of John Blackthorne in James Clavell&#39;s &#39;Shogun?&#39;  The similarities are striking:  Adams came to Japan aboard a Dutch vessel, his chemistry w/ Ieyasu/Toranaga was very good and eventually both were conferrred samurai rank and were not permitted to leave Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BTW, did Adams encourage Ieyasu&#39;s anti-Christian paranoia?  In Clavell&#39;s novel, Blackthorne and the Jesuits were at loggerheads.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Other than Adams, were there foreign-born adventurers who claimed samurai status after serving the shogunate for a considerable abount of time?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gabs<br/>\n<br/>\n  _______________________________________<br/>\n  EDSAMAIL.

It&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt;good read if mostly nonsense, although some find it insulting <br/>\n&gt;and playing up to the idea of the &#39;exotic orient&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ieyasu was a very patient, vcery diplomatic, very skillful <br/>\n&gt;leader who knew his own mind and exactly what he wanted and <br/>\n&gt;how he was going to do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;History suggests he would listen at length to the council of <br/>\n&gt;his hatamoto, and then do precisely what he intended all along. <br/>\n&gt;Whilst he and Adams did become friends of sorts, I reckon it <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;was always on the basis that Adams was such an outsider that he <br/>\n&gt;could pose no threat as such. I doubt whether Adams ever got a <br/>\n&gt;grip of the convoluted politics of Sengoku Japan, let alone the <br/>\n&gt;deeper workings of Ieyasu&#39;s mind. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Regardless of what Adams thought of the Jesuits, Ieyasu played <br/>\n&gt;his own game, and if anything Adams would have supplied the <br/>\n&gt;information Ieyasu wanted to make a case for or against.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In short, his closest retainers rarely knew what was in his <br/>\n&gt;mind, and I doubt any opinion Adams might have held would have <br/>\n&gt;swayed him one iota.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as I know, Adams was the only foreigner to make the rank <br/>\n&gt;of samurai, let alone hatamoto.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you&#39;re really interested get hold of &quot;The Needle-Watcher&quot; by<br/>\n&gt;Richard Blaker, a fictional biography of Adams and much, much <br/>\n&gt;more accurate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thomas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!

It is not clear if he achieved samurai status, but he <br/>\n&gt;apparently had the right of<br/>\n&gt;audience with Ieyasu, a right normally granted only to daimyo and <br/>\n&gt;hatamoto samurai.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
