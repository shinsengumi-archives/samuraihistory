Rather they had ponies, which are much smaller than the horses seen on the continent.<br/>\n    Also to be taken into account is the arable land needed to graze & raise horse. Which Japan has rather little. So the &#39;warhorse&#39; was usually kept for<br/>\nhigh-ranking people, or the very rich (which many times meant the same thing). Even then horses used were just ponies trained & groomed for war (read a<br/>\nlittle bigger)...  Japanese people are small... :)<br/>\n    Note that I am no authority on this, but those were my 2cents (in euro)<br/>\n<br/>\nJP</div>",
