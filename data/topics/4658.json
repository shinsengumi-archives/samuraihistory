            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-392267470\">Zev -<br/>\nI gather the chance of being elevated to samurai rank varied quite a bit<br/>\nfrom period to period, but in general it was hereditary.  (Draeger&#39;s<br/>\n_Classical Bujutsu_, which I loaned out to one too many students, had some<br/>\ndetails on this that I&#39;m no longer in a position to check, unfortunately.)<br/>\nAs I recall, the greatest chances of elevation in station took place during<br/>\ntimes of war, for the same reason that knighthoods in Europe were easier to<br/>\ncome by in such times:  more of the upper echelons were getting killed off,<br/>\ncreating space for upward mobility by those who could show their courage and<br/>\nskill at appropriate moments (i.e., when your superiors are watching).<br/>\nBut given the hereditary element, to say there was an age at which one<br/>\nbecame samurai is kind of self-contradicting.  But what I suspect you mean<br/>\nis the age at which he became a warrior.  Assuming that&#39;s the case... There<br/>\nwas a coming of age ceremony (genpuku, or genbuku) held at 13 or 15, or<br/>\nshortly before the lad was expected to go into battle for the first time,<br/>\naccording to Anthony J. Bryant&#39;s Osprey book _Samurai 1550 - 1600_.  (Some<br/>\nof the colour plates in that are a little suspect, but the information in<br/>\nthe text seems to check out with other sources I&#39;ve run across - save that<br/>\nBryant stresses the inflexible power of the bushido in motivating the<br/>\nsamurai, whereas Draeger and others mention the frequency with which this<br/>\ncode was violated by every class of samurai - to paraphrase &quot;Pirates of the<br/>\nCaribbean,&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not so much rules as a set of guidelines.&quot;)  According to<br/>\nBryant, by the time of the genbuku ceremony the boy had already been in<br/>\nfairly serious training for two to three years (and in some senses, had been<br/>\ntraining all his life).  At genbuku the boy&#39;s head would first get the<br/>\nshave-and-a-topknot treatment.  Since the age at which the ceremony took<br/>\nplace varies so much, I&#39;d guess it was based on the individual&#39;s readiness,<br/>\nbut that&#39;s only a guess.  Anyone with more solid info?<br/>\nBryant also has an excellent website - sengokudaimyo.com - with a great deal<br/>\nof very good information.  Apparently he&#39;s an SCA recreationist, working on<br/>\nthe living history version of his studies, which in my view gives him a much<br/>\nbetter-rounded perspective of the daily life and details of training, etc.,<br/>\nthan most of the other academics.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tGereg Jones Muller, Master-at-Arms<br/>\n\tThe Silk Road School of Sword and Self-Defense<br/>\n<br/>\n      2.

To become<br/>\na Samurai you must have the right bloodline, is this correct? Also<br/>\nhow old would a boy be before he turned Samurai. And how old would he<br/>\nhave to be before his first battle or was it, when he proved himself<br/>\nready.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 3<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 24 Jun 2004 23:26:27 EDT<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eponymous13@...\">Eponymous13@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: Becoming a Samurai<br/>\n<br/>\nHey<br/>\n       I don&#39;t know about the other questions, but yes, aside from the<br/>\nexceptions, someone was born into the samurai class as far as I know.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nL8r<br/>\nTim</div>",
