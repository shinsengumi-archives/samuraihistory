            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1950246361\">Everybody&#39;s samurai fighting<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Mike Snider, USA TODAY<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai films are on a hot streak at the movies, on TV and on DVD. <br/>\n<br/>\nA DVD invasion arrives this week in the Rebel Samurai Sixties <br/>\nSwordplay Classics box set (Criterion, $100, or $30 sold <br/>\nseparately), which includes Samurai Spy (1965), Sword of the Beast <br/>\n(1965), Samurai Rebellion (1967) and Kill! (1968).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome new prints of the samurai films that were struck to produce the <br/>\nDVDs have been shown at film festivals in New York and Washington, <br/>\nD.C., and are scheduled for Cambridge, Mass., (Nov. 4-10) and San <br/>\nFrancisco (Dec. 2-22).<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral also are being broadcast on the Independent Film Channel as <br/>\npart of its Samurai Saturdays series (Kill! airs Saturday at 8 a.m. <br/>\nET/5 a.m. PT). In March, IFC will air the Japanese-produced Samurai <br/>\n7 series, a sci-fi animé takeoff on Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Seven Samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nA subset of the martial arts genre, samurai films have been made <br/>\nsince the early 1930s in Japan. They gained international status <br/>\nwhen renowned directors such as Kurosawa (Rashomon) explored the <br/>\ngenre.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterest in Japanese pop culture and easy access to the films on DVD <br/>\nis driving the resurgence. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It seems they&#39;re just now, at the dawn of the 21st century, finally <br/>\nreceiving the mainstream appreciation in the U.S. that is their <br/>\ndue,&quot; says Patrick Galloway, author of Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The <br/>\nSamurai Film Handbook.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The popularity has always been there, and when (samurai films) have <br/>\nproperly been revived, they have always done well,&quot; says Michael <br/>\nJeck, an expert on Japanese films who coordinated the American Film <br/>\nInstitute&#39;s samurai cinema series, now in Silver Spring, Md. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeven Samurai remains a top-requested DVD in Criterion&#39;s 300-plus <br/>\nlibrary and sells steadily on Amazon.com. &quot;I have to think that <br/>\n(Quentin Tarantino&#39;s) Kill Bill films spotlighted the genre for many <br/>\nof the uninitiated,&quot; says Amazon.com&#39;s DVD editor Doug Thomas. <br/>\n<br/>\nSwordplay is only part of the attraction of samurai films. &quot;What you <br/>\nhave in a samurai battle is close-in, bladed warfare, the good guy <br/>\ngoing against the bad guy face to face,&quot; Jeck says. &quot;You have <br/>\nkinetic energy, balletic grace and brutal force, all conjoined.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA foreign cousin of the American Western, samurai films &quot;have struck <br/>\na chord with U.S. audiences,&quot; IFC&#39;s George Lentz says. <br/>\n<br/>\nDirector John Sturges adapted Seven Samurai to make The Magnificent <br/>\nSeven; Sergio Leone adopted Kurosawa&#39;s Yojimbo to create Clint <br/>\nEastwood&#39;s &quot;The Man with No Name&quot; in three films; and George Lucas <br/>\nsays The Hidden Fortress (1958) inspired Star Wars. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently, Tarantino has cited the movies starring the blind <br/>\nswordsman Zatoichi as an influence for his Kill Bill films. And Tom <br/>\nCruise took up his sword in 2003&#39;s The Last Samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese films owe a debt to the counterculture anti-heroes in <br/>\nCriterion&#39;s Rebel Samurai box set. &quot;They are asking themselves &#39;Is <br/>\nthere a time when how I&#39;m supposed to act conflicts with what I know <br/>\nis right?&#39; It&#39;s not just a guy with a sword,&quot; says co-producer Marc <br/>\nWalkow. &quot;Life and death are at stake.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA new class of filmmakers is carrying on the tradition:<br/>\n<br/>\nShinobi, a special-effects-infused samurai/ninja flick by director <br/>\nTen Shimoyama, is playing well in Japanese theaters.<br/>\n<br/>\n Yoji Yamada, nominated by the Japanese Film Academy as best <br/>\ndirector for The Hidden Blade (2004, due on DVD in January), begins <br/>\nwork on a new film, One-Line Samurai, early next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Last Sword Is Drawn, the winner of last year&#39;s Japanese <br/>\nAcademy Award for best picture, arrives on DVD Dec. 27.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese directors &quot;are revitalizing samurai cinema by making lyrical <br/>\nfilms divorced from mythology, presenting the samurai as <br/>\nrealistically as possible,&quot; Galloway says. &quot;We&#39;re witnessing a new <br/>\nchapter in the genre.&quot;</div>",
