            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1389735546\">FIRST ENGLISH-LANGUAGE ACCOUNT OF THE SHOGUN?S LAST SAMURAI CORPS, <br/>\nBY ACCLAIMED WRITER OF SAMURAI HISTORY<br/>\n<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nSHINSENGUMI: THE SHOGUN?S LAST SAMURAI CORPS, BY ROMULUS HILLSBOROUGH<br/>\n<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nSigned copies available to subscribers of Samurai History Papers<br/>\n<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shinsengumi was the most dreaded police force in Japanese <br/>\nhistory. It was formed by the shogun?s government, the Tokugawa <br/>\nShogunate, to combat revolutionaries who wreaked terror on the <br/>\nstreets of the Imperial Capital. The corps existed for 5 years (1863-<br/>\n1868). It disintegrated with the collapse of the shogunate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shinsengumi is widely depicted in Japan. SHINSENGUMI: The Shogun?<br/>\ns Last Samurai Corps (Tuttle Publishing) is the first book about the <br/>\ncorps in English. While focusing on the Shinsengumi, Hillsborough <br/>\nhas written a history-in-brief of the Meiji Restoration, Japan?s <br/>\ngreatest revolution. The revolution centered around the overthrow of <br/>\nthe shogunate in 1868 and the restoration of power to the emperor. <br/>\nJust as the Meiji Restoration is considered ?the dawn of modern <br/>\nJapan,? knowledge of this history is essential to understanding how <br/>\nand why Japan has evolved into the nation that it is today. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this nonfiction historical narrative of the Shinsengumi, <br/>\nHillsborough spotlights the personalities of the corps? leaders. ?<br/>\nThis book is about bloodshed and death and atrocity,? begins the <br/>\nPreface. ?It is also about courage and honor and fidelity. It <br/>\nexplores some of the darkest regions of the human soul, and some of <br/>\nits most noble parts. The underlying themes?are the extraordinary <br/>\nwill to power and sense of self-importance of the leaders of this <br/>\nmost lethal samurai corps, and the unsurpassed propensity to kill <br/>\ninstilled by them into the rank and file.? The narrative is <br/>\nembellished by numerous vivid anecdotal episodes, including sword <br/>\nfights, assassinations and personal stories to illustrate the nature <br/>\nand spirit of the Shinsengumi. Also included are numerous quotes <br/>\nfrom letters, memoirs and interviews by corpsmen, eyewitnesses of <br/>\nevents and other people directly involved with the Shinsengumi and <br/>\ntheir history.<br/>\n<br/>\nRidgeback Press, publisher of Hillsborough?s Samurai History Papers, <br/>\nan electronic quarterly, is making signed copies of SHINSENGUMI <br/>\navailable to subscribers of the Papers. For more information on this <br/>\noffer and to view the book cover visit www.ridgebackpress.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nRomulus Hillsborough is an expert in Meiji Restoration history. His <br/>\nother books include RYOMA: Life of a Renaissance Samurai (Ridgeback <br/>\nPress, 1999) and Samurai Sketches: From the Bloody Final Years of <br/>\nthe Shogun (Ridgeback Press, 2001). He has appeared on TV specials <br/>\nfocusing on this history, including broadcasts of the History <br/>\nChannel, and NHK (Japan?s national public broadcaster). Hillsborough <br/>\nlived in Japan for sixteen years. Fluent in Japanese, he has worked <br/>\nas a staff writer for a Japanese magazine in Tokyo, and as a US <br/>\ncorrespondent for the Japanese press.</div>",
