Although two others reacted to it,<br/>\nit was not abut the question. Maybe it was the way I asked, maybe nobody<br/>\nknows anything to help me. Just in case some of you overread it I give it<br/>\nanopther try:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day I had a discussion on the rules and restrictions the samurai<br/>\nfaced in daily life concerning the use of swords. The guy I was talking to<br/>\ninsisted on the idea, that they were forbidden by law to draw their swords,<br/>\nunless told to by their superiors.<br/>\nMy point was that there were only resctrictions to the drawing of swords on<br/>\ncertain occasions like being at the shoguns palace or in the court. I guess<br/>\nthere are many more times when it was forbidden but those are the points<br/>\nthat instantly came to my mind. I think that apart from that, there were no<br/>\nlaws that restricted the drawing or the use of the sword. One example here<br/>\nwould be kirisute gomen.<br/>\nMy request to the members of this list would be to name any kind of source<br/>\nthat proves my point as I don´t want to rely only on one or two sources I<br/>\nhave at hand right now. I can use english, german, french or japanese texts.<br/>\nEspecially original sources or their modern day transcriptions would be<br/>\ngreat (i.e. osadamegaki, buke shohatto). Any help will be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much for your time<br/>\nKarsten Helmholz<br/>\nGermany</div>",
