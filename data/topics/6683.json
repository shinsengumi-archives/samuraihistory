Such an association, however, <br/>\n``is a mere vestige&#39;&#39; of the Bushido that existed for more than 700 <br/>\nyears up to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, stresses University of <br/>\nTokyo professor Kakumyo Kanno in his recent book ``Bushido no <br/>\nGyakushu&#39;&#39; (Bushido strikes back). In the paperback, published by <br/>\nKodansha, the 49-year-old professor of ethics argues that the Meiji <br/>\nRestoration severed that thinking and that discontinuity served as a <br/>\nremote cause of Japan&#39;s defeat in World War II. Kanno shared his <br/>\nviews on Bushido in a recent interview. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy has thinking very different from the original Bushido gained <br/>\nground, even though the word bushi (samurai) remains in the name? <br/>\n<br/>\nKanno began by citing ``Bushido: the Soul of Japan,&#39;&#39; written in <br/>\nEnglish by Inazo Nitobe and published in the United States in 1899. <br/>\n<br/>\n``The Bushido spirit presented by Nitobe has nothing to do with the <br/>\nthinking of the samurai. <br/>\n<br/>\n``The actual standpoint of the samurai is completely ignored,&#39;&#39; said <br/>\nKanno sharply. <br/>\n<br/>\n``Nitobe was a Christian who lived in the modern era. The Meiji <br/>\nRestoration ended the age of the samurai. His Bushido is a modern <br/>\nconcept that, so to speak, could be called Meiji Bushido. Nitobe <br/>\nborrowed the word Bushido to use as a link between the Japanese and <br/>\na universal Western thinking that is the same as Christian <br/>\nthinking,&#39;&#39; said Kanno. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen what is the real Bushido like? <br/>\n<br/>\nKanno cited three key terms-self, warrior and community. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe beginnings of the samurai can be traced back to the 10th <br/>\ncentury. At that time, private bands of warriors were formed after <br/>\nthe ritsuryo (legal code) state, which had national troops, ceased <br/>\nto exist. According to Kanno, the thinking that sustained the new <br/>\nbands of private soldiers was Bushido. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince Bushido is the thinking of private warriors, it adheres <br/>\ncompletely to personal attachments. A warrior fights for the sake of <br/>\nhis independence, relying solely on his own capability. This does <br/>\nnot necessarily mean violence without a specific purpose. Kanno <br/>\nbelieves that the samurai fought for his own interests, those of his <br/>\nwife and children and for the community that embraced his lord. <br/>\n<br/>\n``To us, used to the idea of citizens within the framework of the <br/>\nmodern nation-state, this thinking is practically <br/>\nincomprehensible.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nThen why does Meiji Bushido, cloaked in the Bushido shell, still <br/>\nhold interest? <br/>\n<br/>\nTo explain this, Kanno cites the fact that Bushido thinking was <br/>\npreviously declared a national moral code. An example is the gunjin <br/>\nchokuyu, the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors issued by <br/>\nEmperor Meiji in 1882. By examining its formation, Kanno observes <br/>\nthat Bushido was remodeled to become a principle to control the <br/>\narmed forces of a modern state. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe leaders of the imperial army in the early days ingeniously <br/>\nremoved the spirit of the ``original Bushido,&#39;&#39; rooted in personal <br/>\nattachments. And to govern the nation&#39;s army, they are said to have <br/>\ncreated the ``yamato (Japanese) spirit&#39;&#39; to replace the ``original <br/>\nBushido.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\n``Bushido is a way of thinking that was severed by the Meiji <br/>\nRestoration.&#39;&#39; Had Bushido been correctly passed down to the <br/>\nimperial army, Kanno believes, defeat in the last world war might <br/>\nhave been avoided since ``Bushido held the wisdom to end war.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nKanno, a priest of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism, is known for his <br/>\nstudies of Shinto and his research on Motoori Norinaga, a scholar of <br/>\nclassical culture. In addition to publishing ``Shinto no Gyakushu&#39;&#39; <br/>\n(Shinto strikes back), Kanno addressed the topic of Yasukuni Shrine <br/>\nin the January edition of Shokun! magazine. <br/>\n<br/>\n``Although Yasukuni Shrine is a fitting place to console the souls <br/>\nof the deceased, it needs to be supplemented in its present form.
