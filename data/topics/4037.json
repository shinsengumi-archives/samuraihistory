Since it <br/>\nwas during the bakumatsu it still, techincally, involves samurai but I do <br/>\nnot think Okita (the character I admire from this story) himself was a <br/>\nsamurai which is why I did not vote for him in the famous/favorite samurai <br/>\npoll.  The part of the event that captures my attention is the actions of <br/>\nOkita Souji, first squad leader of the Shinsengumi.  He was in his very <br/>\nearly 20s, mayhaps even late teens, when he participated in that raid.  He <br/>\nhad been suffering from tubercluosis for years but had kept it hidden from <br/>\nall but the highest members of the Shinsengumi.  He fought that night and <br/>\nmanaged to survive unharmed up until he took out his last opponent.  From <br/>\nwhat I understand after he delivered the killing blow he coughed up a <br/>\nsubstantial amount of blood and proceeded to pass out.<br/>\n  Call it what you will.  Bushido.  Honor.  Loyalty.  Whatever.  I call it <br/>\nbeing a man.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page ï¿½ FREE <br/>\ndownload! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/\">http://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/</a></div>",
