            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-766667439\">Okay, I held my comments until I finished the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nObservation #1: Milton obviously did an excellent job<br/>\ndoing the research on the letters, accounts, etc., of<br/>\nthe European travelers who made it to Japan. What is<br/>\nequally obvious is that he didn&#39;t do nearly as much<br/>\nresearch about Japan itself, especially the background<br/>\nof what was going on in the country during the time<br/>\nAdams, et al were there. Several places he obviously<br/>\ntakes what was written in the letters by Europeans as<br/>\nthe facts about Japanese politics of the time, when<br/>\nreally they were not accurate at all--kind of like me<br/>\ntrying to describe the politics of South Korea, in<br/>\nwhich I live, but don&#39;t speak the language, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nObservation #2: MUST he refer to things as if he&#39;s a<br/>\n16th century European himself? I thought I was going<br/>\nto puke if I read &quot;scimitar&quot; describing a katana one<br/>\nmore time. &quot;Scimitar&quot;? We couldn&#39;t just say &quot;sword&quot;?<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t have enough &quot;period&quot; flavor, I suppose. And<br/>\nhow hard would it have been to use the JAPANESE names<br/>\n(since, in actuality, they were their names) for<br/>\nJapanese historical figures, and not the stupid &quot;King<br/>\nFoyne&quot;, &quot;Matinga&quot;, etc.? Beyond the fact that I have<br/>\nno idea how phonetically challenged the English must<br/>\nhave been at this time for them to come up with those,<br/>\nit just HURT reading that. Like when people pronounce<br/>\nmy favorite restaurant in Sierra Vista, AZ, which is<br/>\nTanuki, as &quot;Ta NOOOO ki&quot;. AARRGH.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, enough of that--overall I thought it was very<br/>\ninformative, and fairly well done except for my petty<br/>\ngripes above. Worth reading as long as one understands<br/>\nnot to take what Milton writes as a history of Japan<br/>\nduring that time, but a history of the Europeans in<br/>\nJapan, told COMPLETELY through their eyes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!

See below for the biggest (and<br/>\none of the ones that explain much as to why the Japanese were ambivalent about<br/>\nthe book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. Adams early enemy was indeed a specific Jesuit priest whose<br/>\n&gt; personality was virtually identical to that displayed by the movie<br/>\n&gt; Jesuit. This priest did indeed act as interpreter in Adam&#39;s first<br/>\n&gt; meeting with the Shogun, and Adam&#39;s did tell Ieyasu that the Priest<br/>\n&gt; was his enemy. What was less clear in the movie was that Adam&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; eventually learned the Japanese languge well enough that he replaced<br/>\n&gt; the jesuit as Ieyasu&#39;s interpreter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hardly. Joao Rodriguez was a key interpreter -- and quite possibly the best<br/>\nforeign speaker of Japanese in this time frame -- but he was by no means the<br/>\nonly one. There were, by the early 1620s, many Japanese who had had training at<br/>\none of the Jesuit seminaries but left them, and any of them could have done<br/>\ninterpretation -- as well as any number of non-seminary-trained samurai who&#39;d<br/>\nbeen educated in the Portuguese and Spanish languages just for that purpose (as<br/>\nwould later happen to those who were taught Dutch).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are numerous other instances of historical accuracy but let me<br/>\n&gt; now turn to two inaccuracies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. There was apparently no Lady Mariko.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, there was. An incredibly famous woman who is still highly regarded in<br/>\nJapanese historical circles. Her name was Hosokawa Gracia, the Christian<br/>\ndaughter of Akechi Mitsuhide (Akechi Jinsai in the book, assassin of the<br/>\ndictator Goroda, the novel&#39;s version of Oda Nobunaga), wife of Hosokawa Tadaoki<br/>\n(Buntaro), and daughter-in-law of Hosokawa Fujitaka (Hiromatsu).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was held hostage by Ishida Mitsunari (Ishido) in his castle, and committed<br/>\nsuicide and burned her home down (with her in it) to prevent Ishida from being<br/>\nable to hold her prisoner to keep her husband from acting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat such a high-born lady would have had an affair with a foreigner like<br/>\n&quot;Anjin&quot; was an affront to Japanese sensibilities of propriety. It is the<br/>\ngreatest historical inaccuracy -- or rather, the most obvious fiction created --<br/>\nin the book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Adam&#39;s influence with<br/>\n&gt; the Shogun may well have played a role in the Shogun&#39;s eventual<br/>\n&gt; decision to ban Christian&#39;s from Japan. This apparently applied<br/>\n&gt; mostly to Roman Catholics who were indeed enemy to England.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hardly. There was much more to it than the piddling influence Adams was able to<br/>\ncreate. Most critical, possibly, was the San Felipe Incident, and as likely the<br/>\npersonality of Coelho the head of the Jesuit Mission in Japan, who liked to show<br/>\noff Portugal&#39;s military might to impress the Japanese. The ultimate end was the<br/>\nfact that the Catholics wouldn&#39;t lend the shogunate ships to attack Shimabara<br/>\nand the Christians holed up in there; neither would the British. The Dutch,<br/>\nhowever, more interested in trade than in souls, gave the bakufu whatever they<br/>\nneeded, thus securing their position as &quot;foreigners we can work with.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This in turn led to the last major war when Osaka Castle, under<br/>\n&gt; Hideyori, became a refuge for disaffected Christians.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re conflating Shimabara and Osaka.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-93469060\">Some time ago I posted in this forum a comment about the book/movie, <br/>\nShogun. I recalled that on one of my trips to Japan, a hill, (I <br/>\nbelieve it was in Kyushu.), was pointed out to me as being Pilot <br/>\nHill, named after Anjin-San. At that time it was my distinct <br/>\nimpression that the English pilot in Shogun was based on fact. <br/>\nSomeone, I do not recall who, said they thought it was strictly <br/>\nfiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally was able to get my hands on &quot;Samurai William&quot; a history <br/>\nbook by Giles Milton. This book left no doubt that not only did Anjin-<br/>\nSan exist as a real person, but that James Clavell covered the <br/>\nimportant events of William Adams experience with remarkable accuracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould any of you not have read it, I highly recommend doing so, as <br/>\nit does a wonderfull job of discussing events during many years of <br/>\nTokunaga Ieyasu&#39;s &quot;rein&quot; (It goes beyond that into the rein of <br/>\nIeyasu&#39;s son Hidetada, but I haven&#39;t finished the book yet so do not <br/>\nknow how far it extends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number of events of historical accuracy are many and so far I <br/>\nhave only found two significant departures from history.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvents of historical accuracy include:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Adam&#39;s was an English &quot;pilot&quot; (navigator) on board a Dutch Ship.<br/>\n2. He was indeed made Samurai and Hatamoto, not just the first <br/>\nforeigner to be so honored, but the first person, not trained in &quot;the <br/>\nway of the Sword&quot; to be so honored.<br/>\n3. Adams early enemy was indeed a specific Jesuit priest whose <br/>\npersonality was virtually identical to that displayed by the movie <br/>\nJesuit. This priest did indeed act as interpreter in Adam&#39;s first <br/>\nmeeting with the Shogun, and Adam&#39;s did tell Ieyasu that the Priest <br/>\nwas his enemy. What was less clear in the movie was that Adam&#39;s <br/>\neventually learned the Japanese languge well enough that he replaced <br/>\nthe jesuit as Ieyasu&#39;s interpreter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are numerous other instances of historical accuracy but let me <br/>\nnow turn to two inaccuracies.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. There was apparently no Lady Mariko. Adams did marry a Japanese <br/>\nwoman, (making him a bigamist as he had a wife and daughter in <br/>\nEngland.) He had two children with his Japanese wife. But his wife <br/>\nwas not  of a noble family, although her father did have a position <br/>\nof some importance.<br/>\n2. Ieyasu did not have Anjin-San&#39;s ships destroyed to keep him in <br/>\nJapan. To the contrary he had Adam&#39;s build two ships, one an 80 ton <br/>\nvessel and the other a 120 ton vessel.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that Adam&#39;s was refused persmission to leave Japan for 15 <br/>\nyears, but Ieyasu eventually relented and gave permission for him to <br/>\nleave. This was done shortly after the first English ship arrived in <br/>\nJapan. Adam&#39;s was prepared to return home on the ship, but quickly <br/>\nfound the Captain to be such a &quot;jerk&quot; that he decided he prefered to <br/>\nstay in Japan to spending a year aboard a ship with the idiot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Captain was immediately a odds with Adam&#39;s. Although he had no <br/>\nexperience what ever in Japan he continually disregarded Adam&#39;s <br/>\nadvice and made a great deal of trouble for himself and his success <br/>\nin so doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch more recently history repeated when I was &quot;presented&quot; with a <br/>\nboss who also had no exprerience what so ever in foreign countries, <br/>\n(at that time I had 10 years experience), and he also failed to <br/>\nfollow my advice, eventually losing a lot of international business.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also interesting tidbits about the real Anjin-San&#39;s <br/>\nexperience not covered in the book or movie. Adam&#39;s influence with <br/>\nthe Shogun may well have played a role in the Shogun&#39;s eventual <br/>\ndecision to ban Christian&#39;s from Japan. This apparently applied <br/>\nmostly to Roman Catholics who were indeed enemy to England.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis in turn led to the last major war when Osaka Castle, under <br/>\nHideyori, became a refuge for disaffected Christians. That battle <br/>\npitted 180,000 troops under Ieyasu against Hideyori and 120,000 <br/>\ntroops, with the added benefit of the impregnable Osaka castle. <br/>\nIeyasu won.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am finding Samurai William to be an excellent and facinating book <br/>\nand recommend it to all who are interested in that period of Japanese <br/>\nhistory. I have read quite a bit about Tokunaga Shogun, but only in <br/>\nthis book have I actually found a physical description of the man. <br/>\n(In his later years he became too fat to mount a horse).</div>",
