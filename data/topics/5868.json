This was an illustrated talk with 12 swords dating from the Kamakura to the Bakamatsu period. The transcript is a bit &quot;sketchy&quot; and the oshigata are rather poor but, for what its worth you may find it of some interest on www.to-ken.com under Articles.<br/>\nBest regards<br/>\nClive Sinclaire<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
