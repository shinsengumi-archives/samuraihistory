            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-834804877\">This is an interesting response.<br/>\nEuropean fencing places the sword the furest away from the body than any <br/>\nother sword art.  Therefore it styles are modified for more straight in <br/>\nattacks.  Scoring with the tip instead of the side of the blade so to speak.<br/>\nSheild and sword can also be straight in however there differences.  The <br/>\nsheild is used to block and also deflect to the side for a return side of <br/>\nblade cut.  When this happens the body dynamics are more side to side or <br/>\nobleaque than straight in.  The sheild colaspes or moves way left, either way <br/>\nprotect the heart from side and forward attacks.  It also prevents other <br/>\nforms of damage coming from your opponent.  The opponents are in very close <br/>\nto each other.  Unlike fencing where it is difficult to reach out and place <br/>\nyour hand on your opponent you can use grabs, shoulders, stepping on feet, <br/>\nthigh kicks with the knees in sword and sheild.  If you want to strike your <br/>\nopponent, the sword arm comes forward for the strike.  Hence, the heart is <br/>\nprotected.  It needs to come past the sheild to do this.  If the sheild is <br/>\nstill in front of you then you are facing your opponent square on.  Sword and <br/>\nsheild have been used as a means of fighting alot longer than the refined <br/>\nfencing styles.<br/>\nHowever, the point is to compare to japanese sword arts.  The katana is a <br/>\nside of the blade weapon more so that a tip type blade.  It attacks are close <br/>\nin and more from a side angle than the up in the face, high over head, open <br/>\nyour belly style.  Both hands tend to come into use for in feild combat <br/>\npurposes.  This would place the attack perpendicular the the opponents <br/>\ncenter.  When enterening or leaving the current attack, youe generally can <br/>\nswitch to a single right hand to create or remain in contact with the <br/>\nopponent.  The handle of the katanas in the 15th through the 18th century <br/>\nwere longer for more leverage and srtength with the blade.  The strengh was <br/>\nneeded for close contact.  If you move up to later time frames, the length of <br/>\nthe handles were shortened for style reason more than combat reasons.  The <br/>\ngentleman were bumping into things with the longer blades and handles being <br/>\nword in their belts.  This lead to single hand style iaido.  The blades were <br/>\nalso lightened with grooves.<br/>\nAll of this become apparent when you have these different blades in hand and <br/>\ncan try them out.<br/>\nNo disrespect but arguing about right and left handed practioners of the <br/>\nsword arts is of no value.  The dogma of any ART lies within the practioner <br/>\nand their understand of its application.  There are excpetions to everything. <br/>\n Some things are better to do one way and others not.  But if the practioner <br/>\ncan make a ART work for them using nondogmatic ways than so be it.  Lets not <br/>\nget started on exceptions.  The Japanese made rules for everything.  This is <br/>\na way to control a society.  The rules and teachings of sword arts are <br/>\ncreated for specific reasons.  Ask a swordmaster this question for his <br/>\nunderstanding.  Each one you ask will have a different reason.  Ask Toshiro <br/>\nObata at www.shinkendo.com or James Williams at www.bugei.com.<br/>\nIf anyone needs to have this go further, I suggest take lessons in multiple <br/>\nsword arts, read about blade combat tatics, and move on.<br/>\nI have a whole lot more but I think you get the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeijoshin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; In European Swordsmanship, the right hand is used for the sword because it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; places the heart furthest away from the attacker.  Safer place to have <br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The left hand was used for a shield to protect the heart.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry, this is horribly false.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The sword was in the dominant hand. I&#39;ve fenced with many a lefty.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the record, sword-and-shield  combat is the opposite of fencing. In the<br/>\n&gt; former, the shield side is in FRONT (because the shield is BETWEEN you and<br/>\n&gt; the opponent) and if you&#39;re left handed that puts your &quot;heart&quot; closer to <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; opponent, and the sword farther back. In fencing, your sword is out in <br/>\n&gt; front<br/>\n&gt; because you want the maximum distance between you and the opponent. If <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; a lefty, your left side faces; if a righty, your right side faces.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There have been left-handed rapiers and so on, so it&#39;s pretty clear that<br/>\n&gt; there were lefties fighting in Europe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Scott Erickson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Heijoshin@...\">Heijoshin@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
