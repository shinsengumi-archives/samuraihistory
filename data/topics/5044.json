I&#39;m always up for finding another author (that is, above and<br/>\nbeyond those of us on this list - a goodly number, it would appear, even<br/>\ntaking into account that at least one published author has declined to toss<br/>\nhis hat into this particular ring [hi, Tony!]).  As to Basho, I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nthat the &quot;he slept here&quot; phenomenon is connected to the fact that he appears<br/>\nto have been a popular travel writer.  _Narrow Road_ reads like kind of a<br/>\npre-photographic travelogue.

I haven&#39;t read it, so I just know<br/>\nhe wrote it, and the only other thing I remember about<br/>\nhim is that he wrote the &quot;frog/pond&quot; haiku that is so<br/>\noften quoted.
