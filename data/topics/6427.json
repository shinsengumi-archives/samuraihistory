We see the celluloid samurai in various<br/>\nguises - chambara, TC, and &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot; as a more &#39;serious&#39;<br/>\nflick - but I have often wondered about what we might describe as &quot;the<br/>\ncognitive map&quot; of a samurai&#39;s world-view.  I read that their education was<br/>\nlimited to their rank in the Class and that the bottom of the samurai class<br/>\nwere subsistence farmers.  Were they really ALL prepared to face death in an<br/>\ninstant?  Anyway, however uninformed my own position, I certainly support<br/>\nthis thread as being relevant to samurai history.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBarry Thomas<br/>\n(Melbourne, Australia)</div>",

My apologies.  Because after all, those<br/>\n&#39;guys with the helmets and swords&#39; had religious beliefs, beliefs that<br/>\naffected the way they regarded those swords (and a great deal of the rest of<br/>\ntheir world as well).  That does seem, to my poor brain at least, to be<br/>\nrelevant to the subject of samurai history.  The dryads and naiads were<br/>\nintended as parallels in western culture, and I hoped that by using such<br/>\nexamples in discussing Shinto with a primarily western audience, I could<br/>\nmake clearer the great variety of beings that in Shinto are considered to<br/>\nhave spirits.<br/>\nKitsuno, I did not in fact cite gnomes and elves; but I believe I could<br/>\nlegitimately have done so in the context of Shinto, and still have been on<br/>\nthe subject.  To be honest, I don&#39;t know what the Shinto view on, say, the<br/>\nTengu really is.  Are they technically considered kami?  I&#39;m honestly most<br/>\ncurious to learn that.<br/>\nPerhaps I should have expanded on the whole subject for greater clarity, but<br/>\nI rather thought that brevity would be more welcome than detail.<br/>\n\tAs to the subject as a whole... gentlemen, I find it hard to believe that<br/>\nin a forum for the discussion of samurai history, you both regard it as<br/>\ninappropriate to address their beliefs.  ...At least their religious<br/>\nbeliefs:  bushido (and its modern offshoots and parallels) are appropriate<br/>\nbut Shinto (and its) are not?<br/>\nThis is what makes me think that I was somehow unclear.  My own beliefs I<br/>\nbrought up primarily because of the &#39;land mine&#39; I inadvertently set by<br/>\nhaving failed to note them in the earlier rounds of this discussion:  but<br/>\nperhaps the mention of them in this round caused some confusion in turn.<br/>\n(Catch-22, anyone?)  I suggest to you that I have not actually strayed from<br/>\nthe subject of the list by pursuing this thread.  I was, and am still,<br/>\ntrying to increase understanding - my own and others&#39; - of a traditional<br/>\naspect of Japanese culture, and specifically of the subculture of the bushi.<br/>\nI thought that&#39;s what we were here for.  Kinda weird, kinda wild, as you<br/>\nsay.  But there it is.<br/>\n\tGereg</div>",

The very term &#39;Shinto&#39; is loosely<br/>\ntranslated as Way of the Spirits:  a reading of the characters for michi<br/>\n(Way) and kami (which can mean everything from humans, to what the classical<br/>\nGreeks would have regarded as dryads and naiads, to mountains, gods, and<br/>\nfundamental universal principles).   (While humans are not properly<br/>\ndescribed as kami, technically we do qualify, along with anything possessing<br/>\na spirit.  To the followers of Shinto, and within my faith as well, this<br/>\nincludes quite a few things that modern culture regards as inanimate.<br/>\n\tSo my current thinking on this subject is that the kind of focus, will and<br/>\nlabour involved in hand-crafting a thing, or the loving use of a thing, can<br/>\nawaken the spirit inherent in it, and (in some manner that I don&#39;t begin to<br/>\ncomprehend) can augment its development of &#39;presence,&#39; or individual<br/>\ncharacter.  I do not expect to persuade anyone to adopt this view, but for<br/>\nthose who have experienced something similar, it may provide some fresh<br/>\ninsight.  And for those interested in the beliefs of the samurai, it may<br/>\noffer some insight into just how those beliefs might have developed in the<br/>\nfirst place.  For - as I&#39;ve said before - I&#39;ve never known a serious sworder<br/>\nwho did not share my sense of a good sword carrying a spirit that eludes<br/>\neither easy description or easy dismissal.  It&#39;s simply easier to fit the<br/>\nidea into some views of reality than others.<br/>\n\tGereg</div>",
