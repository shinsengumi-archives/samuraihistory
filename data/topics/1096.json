If you&#39;ve read my previous posts, I hope you&#39;ll <br/>\ngather that I have nothing against the guy personally, I just have <br/>\nissues with his work, but don&#39;t take my word for it, grab some of his <br/>\nbooks, and compare what he writes to the Japanese sources, as well as <br/>\nPapinot.  In one of his books he has a picture of something <br/>\nlike &quot;authors sketch of a calvalary charge&quot; or something like that, <br/>\nwhich is ACTUALLY A HAND-SKETCHED COPY of a picture from one of the <br/>\nRekishi Gunzo books! Of course he doesn&#39;t mention that fact in his <br/>\nbook, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn essence, it is the contention of myself and apparently some others <br/>\non this forum that Turnbull is either a poor researcher or a lazy <br/>\nresearcher, or at the very least doesn&#39;t actually use any of the <br/>\nJapanese sources he cites except in the most rudimentary way.  If you <br/>\nhave a copy of Turnbull&#39;s samurai warriors book and a copy of <br/>\nPapinot&#39;s book, the fact that Turnbull took heavily from it is <br/>\npainfully obvious even though he didn&#39;t cite it.  However he cites <br/>\nmany Japanese sources that contradict things he puts in his books.<br/>\nI don&#39;t consider these posts &#39;flames&#39; - I consider them legitimate <br/>\ncomplaints against his scholarship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still want to know what this guy&#39;s doctorate is actually IN!!!! <br/>\nLike I said, if he is a doctor of journalism or economics, or <br/>\nsomething unrelated to Japanese history, I&#39;ll recant everything I&#39;ve <br/>\never said about him.
