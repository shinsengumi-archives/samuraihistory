I<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel he ever really &quot;back-stabbed&quot; the imperial restoration. The<br/>\nKamakura Bakufu had grown weak and needed to be replaced, which Takauji<br/>\ndid, with a good deal of help from the Imperial Court & it&#39;s allies to<br/>\nbe fair... But after it was removed, Tajauji pretty much straight away<br/>\nstepped in to the previous Bakufu&#39;s shoes and kept things moving much as<br/>\nthey had been before. It doesn&#39;t sound to me like he ever even pretended<br/>\nto have any kind of Imperial restoration in mind, and I think most of<br/>\nthe other warriors around the nation also gave up on that idea pretty<br/>\nquickly too, if they ever truly had it in the first place. It&#39;s not like<br/>\nGo-Daigo proved to be any kind of great ruler or anything. The only<br/>\nthing Go-Daigo and his administration seemed to do really well was anger<br/>\nthe warrior class...<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.

There never were any plans to<br/>\n&gt; cover it in silver, much to the contrary of what<br/>\n&gt; guidebooks and Mr. Turnbull will tell you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nate<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree. The ginkaku-ji wasn&#39;t meant to be covered in silver. The <br/>\nname merely alludes to the Kinkaku-ji, that might explain the <br/>\nmisconception. Keene writes in his book about the personality of <br/>\nYoshimasa and the way it probably differed from Yoshimitsu&#39;s. The <br/>\nlatter wanted a building, the kinkaku-ji, that would perpetuate his <br/>\nlegacy through the centuries to come. Yoshimasa on the other hand, <br/>\nabove all, wanted a building that reflected his personal taste. He <br/>\nplanned it thoroughly and had special rocks and plants removed from <br/>\ntemples and palace gardens in order to enhance the beauty of his <br/>\ngardens at Higashiyama. He had certain features and even whole <br/>\nbuildings deconstructed and reconstructed because he didn&#39;t like it.<br/>\nThere is only one known account, according to Keene (sounds like a <br/>\nbroken record :), that Yoshimasa expressed sadness and wonder about <br/>\nthe poverty of the commoners or the famines that plagued Japan <br/>\nduring his reign. In any case, it didn&#39;t stop him from building very <br/>\nexpensive palaces (if I remember correctly the Hana no gosho and <br/>\nothers) or organising Sakura (cherry tree) viewings. Above all, <br/>\nGinkaku-ji was his retreat to where he retired from his position as <br/>\nshogun and only returned to politics (not as shogun but acting as <br/>\none) when his son the ninth Ashikaga shogun, Yoshihisa, died and he <br/>\nhad no heir. Yoshimasa was very much into &#39;karamono&#39; (Chinese things <br/>\nand objects of art). In my humble opinion this probably was a reason <br/>\nthat he didn&#39;t mind being a vassal of or paying tribute to the <br/>\nChinese emperor. The other reason was (again my opinion) that he <br/>\nrevered his grandfather Yoshimitsu and his father Yoshinori, who <br/>\nboth were &#39;King of Japan&#39; and vassals of the Middle Kingdom. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe off-topic;<br/>\n<br/>\nA curious event happened in 1863 when: &quot;Hatred of Yoshimitsu was <br/>\nespecially strong during the years immediately before the Meiji <br/>\nrestoration of 1868, which had as one of it&#39;s professed goals the <br/>\nreturn of secular authority to the emperor. In the second month of <br/>\nthe third year of Bunkyu (1863), nine men, followers of the Shinto <br/>\nzealot Hirata Atsutane, broke into the Toji-in [a temple in Kyoto] <br/>\nand removed the heads of the statues of the first three Ashikaga <br/>\nshoguns: Takauji, Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu. They then exposed the <br/>\nheads on a bank of the Kamo river, following the common practice at <br/>\nthis time of &#39;patriots&#39; exposing for all to see the heads of men <br/>\naccused of being traitors. Beside the heads of the three shogun, <br/>\nplacards were set up enumerating the crimes of each. Yoshimitsu&#39;s <br/>\nacceptance of the title of King of Japan made him the worst traitor <br/>\nof all.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nNow i&#39;m tired<br/>\n<br/>\nNahless<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? <br/>\n&gt; Make Yahoo! your home page <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\">http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
