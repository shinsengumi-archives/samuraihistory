It is great to hear some logical and correct<br/>\nMartial combat ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusashi<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tom.davidson@...\">tom.davidson@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a fair proportion of iai technique is performed<br/>\n&gt; from a <br/>\n&gt; seated posture, I thought it might be useful to post<br/>\n&gt; a couple <br/>\n&gt; of points.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The beginner learns initially in seiza - the<br/>\n&gt; kneeling posture <br/>\n&gt; used indoors and formally. At the commencement of<br/>\n&gt; any technique <br/>\n&gt; the practitioner is therefore seated, with his<br/>\n&gt; weight on his <br/>\n&gt; ankles, the feet flat and soles facing upward, and<br/>\n&gt; his first <br/>\n&gt; move is to rise up to allow him to turn his toes to<br/>\n&gt; get a grip <br/>\n&gt; to launch an attack.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most common seated posture, however, is tate<br/>\n&gt; hiza, sitting <br/>\n&gt; with one knee raised, the foot close in to the body,<br/>\n&gt; the other <br/>\n&gt; leg folded beneath you, bum on ankle. It is an<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable <br/>\n&gt; posture but it allows maximum of movement, freedom<br/>\n&gt; of movement <br/>\n&gt; to pivot in any direction, and therefore gives the<br/>\n&gt; man seated <br/>\n&gt; in hiza a marked advantage over someone in seiza.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tate hiza came about because it is the easiest way<br/>\n&gt; to sit when <br/>\n&gt; wearing armour, other than on a stool. One cannot<br/>\n&gt; sit in seiza, <br/>\n&gt; which compacts the torso, without the body of the<br/>\n&gt; armour rising <br/>\n&gt; up around the neck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another posture is iai-goshi, which is used widely<br/>\n&gt; in aikido, <br/>\n&gt; and was a combative form of hiza (probably hiza<br/>\n&gt; derives from <br/>\n&gt; it). In this both heels are raised and the toes on<br/>\n&gt; the ground, <br/>\n&gt; effectively its a squat with one knee down. It<br/>\n&gt; allows greater <br/>\n&gt; freedom of movement still, whilst keeping a low<br/>\n&gt; profile, and I <br/>\n&gt; have seen aikido practitioners move with amazing<br/>\n&gt; speed and <br/>\n&gt; change of direction in iai-goshi, &#39;running rings&#39;<br/>\n&gt; round those <br/>\n&gt; on two feet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In iai circles hiza and goshi are &#39;combative&#39;<br/>\n&gt; postures and can <br/>\n&gt; be read to imply uncertainty and mistrust in semi<br/>\n&gt; formal <br/>\n&gt; situations. A samurai sitting in hiza before his<br/>\n&gt; lord, if his <br/>\n&gt; katana was within reach, would be watched intently<br/>\n&gt; by the <br/>\n&gt; master&#39;s guards. Samurai countered this by stating<br/>\n&gt; that such a <br/>\n&gt; posture showed &#39;zanshin&#39; - the state of constant<br/>\n&gt; alertness (a <br/>\n&gt; simplified definition) and a readiness to perform<br/>\n&gt; his master&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; will.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Put another way, if I was receiving an armed<br/>\n&gt; warrior, sitting <br/>\n&gt; in seiza, and he in hiza, I would probably change my<br/>\n&gt; posture <br/>\n&gt; accordingly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trivia:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is bad manners to show the soles of one&#39;s feet<br/>\n&gt; when sitting. <br/>\n&gt; The cross-legged posture of the west is used in the<br/>\n&gt; east but <br/>\n&gt; the feet are kept tucked in to the body and the<br/>\n&gt; hakama is drawn <br/>\n&gt; in close to cover the soles without &#39;spraying&#39; all<br/>\n&gt; over the <br/>\n&gt; floor, which is dillatory and considered somewhat<br/>\n&gt; flashy or <br/>\n&gt; feminine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The practice of overlong sleeves and leggings in<br/>\n&gt; court attire <br/>\n&gt; was adopted from the Chinese court dress and had a<br/>\n&gt; useful <br/>\n&gt; benefit of hampering an attacker. The draw of the<br/>\n&gt; Katori Shinto <br/>\n&gt; Ryu utilises a &#39;roll&#39; of the wrist as the right hand<br/>\n&gt; reaches <br/>\n&gt; across to the hilt, and this serves to roll the<br/>\n&gt; sleeve back <br/>\n&gt; from the wrist and thus not hamper the draw of the<br/>\n&gt; sword.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Samurai in &#39;civvies&#39; would tuck the cuffs of their<br/>\n&gt; hakama in <br/>\n&gt; the waistband and tie back their sleeves (if time<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; circumstance allowed).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Iai techniques when all protagonists begin in<br/>\n&gt; kneeling postures <br/>\n&gt; sometimes employ the device of stamping on the<br/>\n&gt; opponent&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; hakama cuff to imobilise him prior to a strike.<br/>\n&gt; Others involves <br/>\n&gt; forcing your opponent down with your sword then<br/>\n&gt; stamping on his <br/>\n&gt; sleeve or whatever to hold him there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thomas<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-657343402\">Hi all -<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a fair proportion of iai technique is performed from a <br/>\nseated posture, I thought it might be useful to post a couple <br/>\nof points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beginner learns initially in seiza - the kneeling posture <br/>\nused indoors and formally. At the commencement of any technique <br/>\nthe practitioner is therefore seated, with his weight on his <br/>\nankles, the feet flat and soles facing upward, and his first <br/>\nmove is to rise up to allow him to turn his toes to get a grip <br/>\nto launch an attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most common seated posture, however, is tate hiza, sitting <br/>\nwith one knee raised, the foot close in to the body, the other <br/>\nleg folded beneath you, bum on ankle. It is an uncomfortable <br/>\nposture but it allows maximum of movement, freedom of movement <br/>\nto pivot in any direction, and therefore gives the man seated <br/>\nin hiza a marked advantage over someone in seiza.<br/>\n<br/>\nTate hiza came about because it is the easiest way to sit when <br/>\nwearing armour, other than on a stool. One cannot sit in seiza, <br/>\nwhich compacts the torso, without the body of the armour rising <br/>\nup around the neck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother posture is iai-goshi, which is used widely in aikido, <br/>\nand was a combative form of hiza (probably hiza derives from <br/>\nit). In this both heels are raised and the toes on the ground, <br/>\neffectively its a squat with one knee down. It allows greater <br/>\nfreedom of movement still, whilst keeping a low profile, and I <br/>\nhave seen aikido practitioners move with amazing speed and <br/>\nchange of direction in iai-goshi, &#39;running rings&#39; round those <br/>\non two feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn iai circles hiza and goshi are &#39;combative&#39; postures and can <br/>\nbe read to imply uncertainty and mistrust in semi formal <br/>\nsituations. A samurai sitting in hiza before his lord, if his <br/>\nkatana was within reach, would be watched intently by the <br/>\nmaster&#39;s guards. Samurai countered this by stating that such a <br/>\nposture showed &#39;zanshin&#39; - the state of constant alertness (a <br/>\nsimplified definition) and a readiness to perform his master&#39;s <br/>\nwill.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way, if I was receiving an armed warrior, sitting <br/>\nin seiza, and he in hiza, I would probably change my posture <br/>\naccordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrivia:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is bad manners to show the soles of one&#39;s feet when sitting. <br/>\nThe cross-legged posture of the west is used in the east but <br/>\nthe feet are kept tucked in to the body and the hakama is drawn <br/>\nin close to cover the soles without &#39;spraying&#39; all over the <br/>\nfloor, which is dillatory and considered somewhat flashy or <br/>\nfeminine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe practice of overlong sleeves and leggings in court attire <br/>\nwas adopted from the Chinese court dress and had a useful <br/>\nbenefit of hampering an attacker. The draw of the Katori Shinto <br/>\nRyu utilises a &#39;roll&#39; of the wrist as the right hand reaches <br/>\nacross to the hilt, and this serves to roll the sleeve back <br/>\nfrom the wrist and thus not hamper the draw of the sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai in &#39;civvies&#39; would tuck the cuffs of their hakama in <br/>\nthe waistband and tie back their sleeves (if time and <br/>\ncircumstance allowed).<br/>\n<br/>\nIai techniques when all protagonists begin in kneeling postures <br/>\nsometimes employ the device of stamping on the opponent&#39;s <br/>\nhakama cuff to imobilise him prior to a strike. Others involves <br/>\nforcing your opponent down with your sword then stamping on his <br/>\nsleeve or whatever to hold him there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
