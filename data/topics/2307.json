Amazon will provide information.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn japanese:  There are several of the &quot;Red&quot; series Nihon Gunzo Rekishi booklets and at least two of the deluxe &quot;Selection&quot; series by Gakken Publishers that have details of castles and seiges. These are relatively easily available in Japan and in specialist booksellers in Europe and USA.<br/>\n<br/>\n It may also be worth checking out a further publication by Stephen Turnbull &quot;Nagashino 1575&quot; published by Osprey in 2000: ISBN 1-84176-250-4<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes with the project<br/>\n<br/>\n                                            Rod Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello,  I am a Fellow of the Japan Foundation and am  currently researching <br/>\n  the sieges of Nagashino Castle in 1575 and that of Osaka Castle in 1615.  While <br/>\n  I have found much information on Japanese castles themselves in &quot;The Age of <br/>\n  the Country at War,&quot;  there seems to be little information on siege engines <br/>\n  like catapults.  Also,  I have difficulty in finding information on Japanese <br/>\n  cannon,  although I know Ishida Mitsunari is known to have deployed 5 cannon at <br/>\n  Sekigahara (1600).  If anybody can help me  (I prefer contact and sources in <br/>\n  English),  I would really appreciate it.  If I can help others I shall try,  <br/>\n  because I feel that before we fall like cherry blossoms,  we should leave a trail <br/>\n  behind for those who follow.  Cheers!  Professor John F.
