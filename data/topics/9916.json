As a professional historian, Prof Varley explains how various sections of the 40-book text are reliable or less so. He relates how Nan-Taiheiki by Imagawa Ryoshun challenged the authority of the Taiheiki&#39;s stance, in that it took an anti-Ashikaga view, and due to that end, its author or authors invented parts of the tale. There are several versions of the Taiheiki text. One factual difference Varley states is numbers of troops quoted as present in battles. The book is on Amazon and available through Powells.</div>",
