            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-693478145\">None of the &#39;featured samurai&#39; are archived, and we took down the <br/>\nregistry a while ago and totally reworked, added to, and cleaned it <br/>\nup, but it is still a work on progress, so none of those bios are <br/>\navailable online.  There is a chance within the next 6 weeks that it <br/>\nwill get put together into a giant online database, but that is still <br/>\nsort of up in the air.  For the moment, here is info on Otani <br/>\nYoshitsugu:<br/>\n<br/>\nYoshitsugu&#39;s origins are unclear but one theory holds that <br/>\nYoshitsugu&#39;s family were former retainers of the Ôtomo family of <br/>\nBungo Province. He was recommended to Toyotomi Hideyoshi (possibly by <br/>\nthe young Ishida Mitsunari) around 1574 and quickly rose through the <br/>\nranks. He attacked Takigawa Kazumasu in the 1583 Shizugatake Campaign <br/>\nand afterwards, follwing Hideyoshi&#39;s defeat of Shibata Katsuie, was <br/>\ngiven Tsuruga in Echizen Province. He assisted in the logistical <br/>\naspects of Hideyoshi&#39;s 1587 invasion of Kyushu and was present for <br/>\nthe siege of Odawara Castle in 1590. He was later dispatched to the <br/>\nnorthern provinces as a land survey officer, though his activities <br/>\nduring the 1590&#39;s are otherwise obscure, possibly due to a worsening <br/>\ncase of leprosy he was suffering from by this point. While in the <br/>\nnorth he was forced to quell the resistance of Onodera Yasumichi in <br/>\n1599, whose castle of Ômori Yoshitsugu besieged. In 1600 he at first <br/>\nthought of joining Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s side in the coming war but was <br/>\nconvinced by Ishida Mitsunari to follow the latter instead. Though <br/>\nsuffering from now-advanced leprosy, he joined the &#39;western&#39; forces <br/>\non the battlefield at Sekigahara and directed his troops from within <br/>\na palanquin. After the defection of Kobayakawa Hideaki to Tokugawa <br/>\nIeyasu&#39;s side, he ordered a retainer to cut off his head and spirit <br/>\nit away. His daughter was married to Sanada Yukimura.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/searchst.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/searchst.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is this listing any help?<br/>\n&gt; -t </span></blockquote></div>",
