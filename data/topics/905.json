The site I was <br/>\ninterested in making would be more to do with the coolness of the <br/>\nhats the style the function the history as well.  But I wanted <br/>\nsomething that shows the coolness of the Japanese as well as the <br/>\nhistory.  I like the basket hats and the peasant hats, the monsho <br/>\nused on them, the purpose of hats disguise,anoniymaty, use in snow, <br/>\netc.  Ever since I spoke to someone here in England who kept telling <br/>\nme all the historical facts, it was good at first but I admit part of <br/>\nthe reason I like Japanese society is because it is distinctive, <br/>\ncool, strange, fascinating, (isn&#39;t that the same with us all anyway)  <br/>\nnot just because Oda Nobunaga was apparently assasinated by his own <br/>\nretainer, although things like that are interesting.  Like you I <br/>\nreally wanted to get into the heart of the matter.  Like Hiroshiges <br/>\npaintings and other things of people in hats.  So soon when my site <br/>\nis up people can judge for themselves what the Bushi were like and <br/>\nhow the society was through it&#39;s hats. A bit odd but I like the hats <br/>\nvery much.  A historian should not be a man who just looks at history <br/>\ndo you agree? <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best Mark</div>",
