I can tell that guy didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike it, and I think he sees Kurasawa as god, at least he acts like <br/>\nit.  One thing I can see that shows that he didnt give it chance when <br/>\nhe mentions that Kagetora is waiting or 6 days for troops from a <br/>\ncastle that is a 2 day ride.  It doesn&#39;t seem to take much thought to <br/>\nme to see this as possible.  2 days for meengers to arrive, time to <br/>\nmobilize the garrison, and then 2 days back, and the almost <br/>\ninvetiable delays in the actual travel.  Just something that has been <br/>\non my mind and wanted to speak my peace.</div>",
