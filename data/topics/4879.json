Personally I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever found (not that I was looking) any errors in <br/>\nCleary - but it just doesn&#39;t quite have the same oomph as the <br/>\noriginal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d also be grateful if anyone can tell me of a literal,<br/>\n&gt; character-by-character translation of Musashi&#39;s work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know what kind of thing you are referring to here, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink it would work for Japanese --&gt; English. I guess that it works <br/>\nfor Chinese because the grammer structures are apparently quite <br/>\nsimilar. But because of the differences in grammar between Japanese <br/>\nand English you really couldn&#39;t render a character for character <br/>\nliteral translation; or rather, I would say that doing so wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nprovide any help to more deeply understanding the original.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now Harris gives a capsule biography of Musashi which is (I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>believe) about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all we really know about him.

By now <br/>\nYoshikawa&#39;s Musashi has itself become part of folk tradition. Again <br/>\nI&#39;m no expert, but it&#39;s my understanding that Musashi&#39;s actual life <br/>\nis essentially a mystery - even his birthplace is the source of much <br/>\ndebate. I am of the impression that even the few events which are <br/>\nthought to be &#39;known&#39; (such as his early duel with Arita) are <br/>\nimpossible to really prove one way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn no particular relationshp to anything above, allow me to mention <br/>\nthat last fall I visited a town called &quot;Miyamoto Musashi-no-Mura&quot; <br/>\nwhich is one of the purported birthplaces of Musashi. This one is in <br/>\nOkayama Prefecture and is in my esteemed opinion :) the place with <br/>\nthe best claim. It was a lot of fun to get off of the train <br/>\nat &quot;Miyamoto Musashi Station&quot; and walk around. One highlight of the <br/>\ntrip for me was visiting the supposed grave of Musashi. One other was <br/>\nseeing the Hirao family home; this is the family that Musashi&#39;s elder <br/>\nsister O-gin was married to. Amazingly, the home is still there and <br/>\nthe Hirao family still live there. It&#39;s little experiences and <br/>\nepisodes like that, that for whatever reason constantly re-kindle my <br/>\ninterest in Japanese history.</div>",

He&#39;s got an agenda, as<br/>\ndoes everyone. His Sun Zi Ping Fa (&quot;Art of War&quot;) is<br/>\nHORRIBLE, in my opinion. He attempts to take out all<br/>\nsense that it&#39;s a military strategy guide, and make it<br/>\ninto some pithy philosophical gobbledygook. Yes, it<br/>\nreflects the taoist and confucian philosophy of the<br/>\ntime Sun Zi wrote, but it&#39;s a book of strategy on how<br/>\nto defeat an enemy, not a morality play. His<br/>\ntranslation really turned me off--his actual<br/>\ntranslations may be okay (the word for word<br/>\ntranslation), but when he &quot;explains&quot; the text, it<br/>\ncomes out as philosphical hogwash. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t gone through his &quot;Japanese Art of War&quot;, etc.,<br/>\nbecause after reading his Sun Zi I&#39;m simply not<br/>\ninterested. It seems he&#39;s less concerned with any art<br/>\nof war, more concerned with contemplating his navel<br/>\nand becoming one with the Tao. I&#39;ve got no problem<br/>\nwith philosophers, but I do have a problem with<br/>\noverinjecting philosophy where it isn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\n The one I have of the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; _Tao Te Ching_ in that style is by far the most<br/>\n&gt; illuminating I&#39;ve seen, as<br/>\n&gt; it makes sense of all the variations one finds in<br/>\n&gt; the other translations.<br/>\n&gt; (One English word beneath this character, seven<br/>\n&gt; words beneath the next - it<br/>\n&gt; captures the nuances in a way that makes a good deal<br/>\n&gt; of sense, and helps me<br/>\n&gt; to understand the logic patterns in the parent<br/>\n&gt; language.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which translation is that? I think I&#39;ve seen it, and<br/>\nyou&#39;re right, you catch a lot more that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t help you too much with your Musashi<br/>\nquestions--I&#39;m not a Musashi officianado at all.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-935336340\">Someone recently mentioned &quot;bad Cleary translations,&quot; and it&#39;s got me to<br/>\nwondering about something.  I&#39;ve got three translations of _Book of Five<br/>\nRings_ on my shelves, as the Harris translation I found in the &#39;70s only<br/>\nwhetted my appetite for a better understanding.  (I come from a family of<br/>\nlinguists, and I always prefer to compare translations on any work that<br/>\nreally matters to me - _Beowulf_, the _Tao Te Ching_, the _Mabinogi_, and<br/>\nMusashi, for instance - in order to penetrate a little further into a given<br/>\nsource work than one translator can ever achieve.)  If I were ever to study<br/>\nJapanese, it would mostly be so I could read Musashi in the original.<br/>\nNow Cleary&#39;s been translating some works I value - Soho&#39;s _Unfettered Mind_,<br/>\nthe Yagyu _Heiho Kaden Sho_ (although he leaves out the incredibly valuable<br/>\nillustrations, which is... weird), and - of course - _Five Rings_.  So I&#39;d<br/>\nbe very grateful if anyone could let me know if there&#39;s a problem with his<br/>\ntranslations that I ought to know about.  This one seems to me to be quite a<br/>\nbit like Harris&#39;s, a little clearer on some points and a little less so on<br/>\nothers.<br/>\nI&#39;d also be grateful if anyone can tell me of a literal,<br/>\ncharacter-by-character translation of Musashi&#39;s work.  The one I have of the<br/>\n_Tao Te Ching_ in that style is by far the most illuminating I&#39;ve seen, as<br/>\nit makes sense of all the variations one finds in the other translations.<br/>\n(One English word beneath this character, seven words beneath the next - it<br/>\ncaptures the nuances in a way that makes a good deal of sense, and helps me<br/>\nto understand the logic patterns in the parent language.)<br/>\nFor that matter, are there any books available of his artwork?  I suspect<br/>\nthat Inagaki uses one of his statues in the opening credits of &quot;Duel at<br/>\nGanryu Island,&quot; but I&#39;m not sure.  And the pictures in Harris&#39;s translation,<br/>\nof course, are only black-and-white.  If he had a serious body of artwork,<br/>\nI&#39;d be very interested to get a closer look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Harris gives a capsule biography of Musashi which is (I believe) about<br/>\nall we really know about him.  Yet Yoshikawa&#39;s melodrama of his life (and<br/>\nthe Inagaki film adaptation), expand on that to so vast a degree that I<br/>\nwonder to what extent they represent the novelist&#39;s fancy, and to what<br/>\nextent they represent legitimate folk tradition.  For example, I understand<br/>\nthat the tale of his meeting with the jo stylist - whose name escapes me at<br/>\nthe moment - is actual tradition:  but is it history?  And am I even correct<br/>\nin my understanding that it&#39;s actual tradition?<br/>\nThis list is the first place I&#39;ve come across a group of people sufficiently<br/>\ninformed that I thought I might find some answers I could trust on the<br/>\nsubject.
