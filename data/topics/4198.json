Several years prior, Hawaii had asked <br/>\nthe US to be a territory (but still a sovreign state) but the US <br/>\nrefused, twice.  Primarily because the US didn&#39;t see any benefit in <br/>\nit.  Hawaii was being bullied around.  Although, Hawaii was its own <br/>\ncountry, the Hawaiian military was not strong enough to stand up to <br/>\nthe super powers of that time.  Treaties were being forced upon them <br/>\nthat put Hawaiians at a severe disadvantage.  Hawaii needed to align <br/>\nitself with another country in order to retain its sovriegnty.  Since <br/>\nthe US had refused and the Monarchy thought a Pacific alliance would <br/>\nstrengthen the dying Hawaiian bloodline, they asked Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it was a ploy to push Japan&#39;s buttons.  I don&#39;t even <br/>\nthink annexing Hawaii was a US decision.  The decision belonged to <br/>\none man, Dole (think pineapples).  A rich landowner who decided he <br/>\nneeded to protect his property in Hawaii.  So he (having the support <br/>\nof most US Marines on Oahu) decided to storm the Palace.  The actions <br/>\nwere illegal and unconstitutional but resulted in the statehood of <br/>\nHawaii.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon</div>",

By this point Japan has been<br/>\nmucking about in Korea and China for decades and showing their talent<br/>\nfor colonial administration. I.E. virtually none. Previous to this they<br/>\nhad already attacked Americans, read up on the Panay. These actions and<br/>\nothers lead to the embargoes and other sanctions. Military dictatorships<br/>\ndon&#39;t make good neighbors and are generally poor at diplomacy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I also feel that the US has to bear a good portion of the blame -<br/>\n&gt;you have to remember that the Japanese people&#39;s only experience of the US<br/>\n&gt;was being forced to trade at gunpoint, and the US invasion of Hawaii because<br/>\n&gt;they were holding a referendum which would have made Hawaii a Japanese, not<br/>\n&gt;American, state.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The original treaty also dealt with treating shipwrecked sailors like<br/>\nhumans and other things along those lines, this is close to 90 years<br/>\nbefore, I&#39;ve never heard of the referendum to make Hawaii a Japanese<br/>\nstate, I doubt it would have come close to passing since the number of<br/>\nanglos, Hawaiians and Chinese far exceeded the number of Japanese on the<br/>\nisland. Even if just the Hawaiians voted, they felt they could stay an<br/>\nindependent country at the time. The US backed coup came as an<br/>\nunpleasant surprise. P.S. Look up the difference in the US between a<br/>\nterritory and a state, It took about 60 years for Hawaii to become a state.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Plus in nearby Phillipines they had seen the Americans<br/>\n&gt;invade the islands and then keep it as a colony. Are they the actions of a<br/>\n&gt;state that you would trust in their position?? I suppose it is little wonder<br/>\n&gt;that no diplomatic solution was ever reached.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We were late to the colonial game, so we got the leftovers that the UK,<br/>\nFrance and Germany didn&#39;t want. We should have freed them like we did<br/>\nwith Cuba. This still has little bearing on Japan&#39;s actions, they were<br/>\nan aggressive, expansionist, military dictatorship that had set out to<br/>\nconquer Asia, this would have lead to war no matter what and the US<br/>\ntried diplomatic means to prevent it including not going to war over<br/>\nattacking US citizens and soldiers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways these does show samurai spirit, a bunch of bloody minded<br/>\nkillers who are going to take what they want and only understand force<br/>\nas an argument. Which makes them no different from their European<br/>\ncounterparts.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",

Plus in nearby Phillipines they had seen the Americans<br/>\ninvade the islands and then keep it as a colony. Are they the actions of a<br/>\nstate that you would trust in their position?? I suppose it is little wonder<br/>\nthat no diplomatic solution was ever reached.<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Michael Lorimer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mijalo_jp@...\">mijalo_jp@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: 12 April 2004 12:33<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] WWII... why?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I feel in terms of diplomacy Japan couldn&#39;t back down. It had shown its<br/>\nmilitary capability, both naval and on land, during the Russo-Japanese War,<br/>\nbut effectively ganged-up upon by the more mature diploatic powers, Japan<br/>\nreceived nothing from the War other than, in many poltical and military<br/>\ncircles, a revanchist attitude not too dissimilar to the French Right and<br/>\nLeft of the Third Republic between 1871-1914. Driven as much by this<br/>\nattitude of pride and a stubborn willingness to ignore the obvious, Japan&#39;s<br/>\nleadership willingly blundered into the War, succeeding in antagonizing the<br/>\nUSA, the UK, and a host of other colonizers and dominions, aswell China. The<br/>\nsame lack of forethought that drove them against the NT of Australia (were<br/>\nthey going to march to Adelaide down The Track??) was what kept them going.<br/>\n  And at this stage of tragic proceedings, would the Allies have negotiated<br/>\na settlement if the Japanese had appeared willing. American attitudes were<br/>\nakin to those of more recent years; an attack on the American nation, state,<br/>\nand way of life. Roosevelt was in little doubt that revenge had to be taken,<br/>\nan attitude willingly shared by Churchill. And the Nationalists or<br/>\nCommunists in China?<br/>\n  Perhaps by comparing this to the samurai spirit is degrading the samurai.<br/>\nWhile samurai armies were composed of a corps of trusted retainers and<br/>\n&#39;captains&#39;, the majority, whether ashigaru were samurai, were<br/>\nagriculturalists.  Wars were generally fought around the agricultural<br/>\ncalendar. Their loyalty ran to what was at stake; their property. There were<br/>\nfew mass suicides or massive &#39;bloodbath&#39; battles, the daimyo and their<br/>\ntroops had more sense; more often than not a daimyo surrendered and in<br/>\nreturn was confirmed in his estates, upon condition of loyalty. Perhaps in<br/>\nthe Japanese High Command in 1943/44 should have done the same to save<br/>\nthemselves, rather than pursuing an impossible dream in the remodelled<br/>\nspirit of the samurai.That&#39;s just my opinion anyways.<br/>\n  M.Lorimer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cesare Polenghi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cepo@...\">cepo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  According to Mass (the former Japanese historian at Stanford), the<br/>\n  samurai spirit was alive and kicking until the forties. Thus I hope I<br/>\n  am not going off-topic here. Ok, once I am done with my excuse, here is<br/>\n  my question: the Japanese campaign in East Asia and in the Pacific was<br/>\n  clearly a hopeless hyperbole. There was NO WAY the Japanese could<br/>\n  control and man such a vast area. After Guadalcanal, then, it was clear<br/>\n  that the wind had changed, still there was room for diplomacy, either<br/>\n  with the US and perhaps with what was left of China and the Soviets.<br/>\n  But the Japanese kept fighting and dying until August 1945.<br/>\n  Why?<br/>\n  I have my own theories, but before throwing them on the table, I&#39;d love<br/>\n  to hear from some of you.<br/>\n  Thanks<br/>\n  cepo<br/>\n  PS= subquestion; is the &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; a good movie?

After Midway I think that they fought on because they still held hope for a major victory. They were far behind in the development of radar and sonar, but they had advantages in torpedoes, biological warfare, and Japanese navy was the best in the world in night warfare. And of course there was the great hope that the kamakaze would bring them a victory. After it was clear that these things had failed I think that most were resolved to die for the emperor rather than surrender, look at what happend on Saipan, Okinawa and Iwojima. Had the home islands themselves been invaded much the same would have happend.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Cesare Polenghi <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 11, 2004 9:28 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] WWII... why?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  According to Mass (the former Japanese historian at Stanford), the <br/>\n  samurai spirit was alive and kicking until the forties.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1687580829\">I feel in terms of diplomacy Japan couldn&#39;t back down. It had shown its military capability, both naval and on land, during the Russo-Japanese War, but effectively ganged-up upon by the more mature diploatic powers, Japan received nothing from the War other than, in many poltical and military circles, a revanchist attitude not too dissimilar to the French Right and Left of the Third Republic between 1871-1914. Driven as much by this attitude of pride and a stubborn willingness to ignore the obvious, Japan&#39;s leadership willingly blundered into the War, succeeding in antagonizing the USA, the UK, and a host of other colonizers and dominions, aswell China. The same lack of forethought that drove them against the NT of Australia (were they going to march to Adelaide down The Track??) was what kept them going. <br/>\nAnd at this stage of tragic proceedings, would the Allies have negotiated a settlement if the Japanese had appeared willing. American attitudes were akin to those of more recent years; an attack on the American nation, state, and way of life. Roosevelt was in little doubt that revenge had to be taken, an attitude willingly shared by Churchill. And the Nationalists or Communists in China? <br/>\nPerhaps by comparing this to the samurai spirit is degrading the samurai. While samurai armies were composed of a corps of trusted retainers and &#39;captains&#39;, the majority, whether ashigaru were samurai, were agriculturalists.  Wars were generally fought around the agricultural calendar. Their loyalty ran to what was at stake; their property. There were few mass suicides or massive &#39;bloodbath&#39; battles, the daimyo and their troops had more sense; more often than not a daimyo surrendered and in return was confirmed in his estates, upon condition of loyalty. Perhaps in the Japanese High Command in 1943/44 should have done the same to save themselves, rather than pursuing an impossible dream in the remodelled spirit of the samurai.That&#39;s just my opinion anyways.<br/>\nM.Lorimer   <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCesare Polenghi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cepo@...\">cepo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nAccording to Mass (the former Japanese historian at Stanford), the <br/>\nsamurai spirit was alive and kicking until the forties.

After Guadalcanal, then, it was clear <br/>\nthat the wind had changed, still there was room for diplomacy, either <br/>\nwith the US and perhaps with what was left of China and the Soviets. <br/>\nBut the Japanese kept fighting and dying until August 1945.<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\nI have my own theories, but before throwing them on the table, I&#39;d love <br/>\nto hear from some of you.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\ncepo<br/>\nPS= subquestion; is the &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; a good movie? Worth 3 hours of <br/>\nmy life and the $3,99 at block buster?</div>",
