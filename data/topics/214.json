            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1395647640\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\n you are correct that many armies did not have uniform<br/>\ncolors.  In fact at that time so many different armies<br/>\nwould join forces and then split that the armies were<br/>\nreally just coalitions of different forces.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe sashimono was a device used buy a single samurai<br/>\nto identify his position on the field.  During this<br/>\nperiod for the most part warrior attentandts had been<br/>\ngotten rid of and the individual warrior would carry<br/>\nhis own sashimono on a ring and post on the back of<br/>\nthe armour.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnouther form of device was the o uma jirushi.  This<br/>\nwas the identifyibng device of a daimyo or high<br/>\nranking general in the army.  This device was usually<br/>\npositioned at the center of an army near were the<br/>\ngeneral was positioned.  This position was usually the<br/>\npoint of the most conflict.  The holder/holders of the<br/>\numa jirushi were considered very important and<br/>\nhonored.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier in the e-mail I said that attendants were<br/>\nmostly gotten rid of.  This is true except ing the<br/>\ncase of the daimyo or some high ranking personages who<br/>\nstill had quite a few, dependant upon there income of<br/>\nkoku.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are few books that talk about the actual<br/>\nformatio ns and positions in early samurai warfare. <br/>\nYou can find some strategy maps and battle formations<br/>\nin books like &quot;sekigahara&quot; by anthony J. Bryant. <br/>\n&quot;Nagashino&quot; by stephen turnbull and the &quot;Samurai<br/>\nsourcebook&quot; by stephen turnbull.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I hope that this has been helpful.<br/>\nThere are more identifying devices like religous<br/>\nsayings such as namyo ho renge kyo but for the most<br/>\nsimple this is it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusashi<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bnason@...\">bnason@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Greets all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just want to say that I&#39;m thrilled to have found<br/>\n&gt; this list, even <br/>\n&gt; though I&#39;m at best a pseudo-amateur historian of<br/>\n&gt; Japanese military <br/>\n&gt; history.  My main interest in this group is that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; an avid <br/>\n&gt; wargamer, and am putting together miniatures to<br/>\n&gt; recreate samurai <br/>\n&gt; conflicts from the feudal era (just ordered 800+<br/>\n&gt; miniatures).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At first, I probably won&#39;t have a good mix of troop<br/>\n&gt; types to <br/>\n&gt; represent what would have appeared on the<br/>\n&gt; battlefield at any given <br/>\n&gt; time.  I have a small contingent of monks, lots of<br/>\n&gt; mounted troops, <br/>\n&gt; and an assortment of ashigaru spearmen, bowmen, and<br/>\n&gt; some samurai <br/>\n&gt; retainers.  While I have a couple ashigaru<br/>\n&gt; arquebusiers, my thought <br/>\n&gt; is that with all the mounted troops I&#39;d best<br/>\n&gt; represent earlier <br/>\n&gt; periods of warfare (1300-1450ish or so).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My conundrum is this: I&#39;d like to paint the<br/>\n&gt; miniatures so that they <br/>\n&gt; reflect what a real army would have looked like on<br/>\n&gt; the battlefield.  <br/>\n&gt; With only a few exceptions, such as Ii&#39;s Red Devil&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; in the later <br/>\n&gt; period of samurai warfare, I&#39;ve run across almost no<br/>\n&gt; accounts of <br/>\n&gt; organized uniforms or the like.  I&#39;ve even having a<br/>\n&gt; hard time <br/>\n&gt; figuring out how sashimono&#39;s and other field<br/>\n&gt; standards would be <br/>\n&gt; used.  Anyone mind giving me some tips on how they<br/>\n&gt; would be used, and <br/>\n&gt; what a typical army might look like?  My guess is<br/>\n&gt; assorted colors, <br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;m not sure.  Like I said, I enjoy the history<br/>\n&gt; of the period but <br/>\n&gt; am not well versed in it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>\n&gt; Ben Nason<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
