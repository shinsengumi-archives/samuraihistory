How many documentaries have you seen where they get the<br/>\nbasic, fundamental things wrong and the narrator can&#39;t even pronounce<br/>\nsimple things correctly?  How many books about a specific subject have<br/>\nyou read, and then found another with an opposing view?  Does any of<br/>\nthis really matter, unless you want to think of yourself as an<br/>\n&quot;expert&quot; or a definitive source of knowledge?

What&#39;s the bet that<br/>\nmost books about him have just as many viewpoints but slightly less<br/>\nentertainment value.  Why does it matter?  Are you concerned that we<br/>\nare gullible enough to believe that a film is equal to the truth?  <br/>\nIf I couldn&#39;t tell the difference I&#39;d need locking up.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1482848985\">Not to be argumentative, but &quot;just movies&quot; is probably what got a lot<br/>\nof us started in our interest of Japan.  Some movies are plain<br/>\nentertainment, nothing wrong with that.  Others have been made by<br/>\nsomeone with their own political or social agenda.  Still more have<br/>\nbeen made by people with access to research material and reflect some<br/>\nkind of truth.<br/>\nI am also interested to understand why you prefer archive material,<br/>\nand how you are assured of its veracity. Since every contemporaneous<br/>\nwriter would have reflected whatever particular axe he (or his<br/>\nsuperior) wished to grind, how are you sure that they are writing the<br/>\ntruth and not tweaking, spinning or slanting?  I don&#39;t think spin is<br/>\nanything new, it&#39;s been going on for as long as we have.  Thus, any<br/>\nhistorical piece written by someone who was there (IF you can find it)<br/>\nhas to be seived through, and a large pinch of salt added.  If it<br/>\nhappened 300, 500 or 800 years ago, and there are several sources<br/>\navailable who contradict each other, what makes you choose one side?  <br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to most people I&#39;m an ignoramous, but I&#39;m not so stupid as to<br/>\nbelieve something that is unprovable.  I prefer to go with my gut<br/>\ninstincts, and then doubt them too!  Ultimately, that&#39;s all any of us<br/>\nhave, a feeling that the source whose view we prefer is the one that<br/>\nis correct.  But we can&#39;t KNOW, so relying on it, quoting on it or<br/>\nswearing on it is just plain daft.  Why would you doubt that a film<br/>\nmaker has spent years of research in order to present his film in the<br/>\nmost accurate possible light?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll verions of history are fascinating, interesting and worthy of<br/>\nexploration, if for no other reason than to see how opposing views<br/>\nevolve.  Definitive decisions about what is real and what is not is<br/>\nbeyond our field of expertise, and the sooner we understand that, the<br/>\nsooner we stop criticising others for not toe-ing our particular party<br/>\nline.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rntihg&quot; &lt;rntihg@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been absent from the list for at least a year, but have decided<br/>\n&gt; to see what&#39;s what here (albeit from a new email address).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to comment on the premise of Ms. Boal&#39;s questions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@s...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Back in the earlier thread, we were discussing the qualities of a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;good&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; samurai.

Peer<br/>\n&gt; reviewed (as in university and other scholarly presses)?<br/>\n&gt; All of these (and many more) are the first questions one normally<br/>\n&gt; would ask about sources quoted in support of any statement or<br/>\n&gt; hypothesis.  Without some idea of the sources that you are using, a<br/>\n&gt; statement such as &#39;some historical accounts I&#39;ve read&#39; has an<br/>\n&gt; indeterminate authority and leaves me (and I suspect others) curious<br/>\n&gt; as to the accuracy that we can expect from the sources.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The next thing that I would point out is that these are just movies. <br/>\n&gt; While I like Kurosawa and Tokugawa-set period pieces, I don&#39;t beleive<br/>\n&gt; anyone would put much faith in their historical accuracy.  That is not<br/>\n&gt; to say that the things that movies depict are necessarily untrue, but<br/>\n&gt; simply that they can&#39;t be relied upon as historical documents in the<br/>\n&gt; same way that contemporaneous materials can.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So with the statement cited below: can it be inferred that a<br/>\n&gt; samurai&#39;s sword<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -- and keeping it -- would be more important to a samurai&#39;s honor than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feeding his family? That it was considered better if the samurai&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; family<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were to starve to death rather than for the samurai to ever part<br/>\n&gt; with his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sword? And thus a samurai who sells his sword blades, even to keep his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; family alive, is acting dishonorably?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another thing to keep in mind is that the stories that come down to us<br/>\n&gt; throug history and are popularized in  books that treat the samurai<br/>\n&gt; and the concept of honor (among other things), often uncritically<br/>\n&gt; choose those stories/anecdotes/legends that support the picture of the<br/>\n&gt; samurai that they are trying to paint and do a poor job at addressing<br/>\n&gt; alternative interpretations of the sources that do exist.  I believe<br/>\n&gt; that most of us have probably heard that a samurai&#39;s topknot was,<br/>\n&gt; similar to the sword, sacrosanct as a badge of the privileged class to<br/>\n&gt; which he belonged.  If memory serves, Kurosawa in 7 Samurai, has one<br/>\n&gt; of the main characters cut hit hair to impersonate a priest in order<br/>\n&gt; to achieve a solution to the hostage stalemate.  Who to believe, the<br/>\n&gt; popular history books or Kurosawa...or are both depictions accurate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been reading and trying to get caught up with the threads that<br/>\n&gt; I have missed during the last year or so, that I have been absent from<br/>\n&gt; the list and am enjoying the variety of topics that have come up. <br/>\n&gt; Some of the recent threads in particular have piqued my curiosity, but<br/>\n&gt; it seems reasonable for us to analyze the assumptions behind some of<br/>\n&gt; the questions that we are asking and to be as clear as possible about<br/>\n&gt; the sources that we use so that everyone has an idea as to the<br/>\n&gt; relative accuracy and authority of the information. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Granted that many times we don&#39;t have our references to hand when we<br/>\n&gt; are inspired to post, but even in those cases it might be nice to<br/>\n&gt; follow up including the citations in a later post in the thread.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Shannon<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

That it was considered better if the samurai&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>family<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; were to starve to death rather than for the samurai to ever part<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sword? And thus a samurai who sells his sword blades, even to keep his<br/>\n&gt; family alive, is acting dishonorably?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nina<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another thing to keep in mind is that the stories that come down to us<br/>\nthroug history and are popularized in  books that treat the samurai<br/>\nand the concept of honor (among other things), often uncritically<br/>\nchoose those stories/anecdotes/legends that support the picture of the<br/>\nsamurai that they are trying to paint and do a poor job at addressing<br/>\nalternative interpretations of the sources that do exist.  I believe<br/>\nthat most of us have probably heard that a samurai&#39;s topknot was,<br/>\nsimilar to the sword, sacrosanct as a badge of the privileged class to<br/>\nwhich he belonged.  If memory serves, Kurosawa in 7 Samurai, has one<br/>\nof the main characters cut hit hair to impersonate a priest in order<br/>\nto achieve a solution to the hostage stalemate.  Who to believe, the<br/>\npopular history books or Kurosawa...or are both depictions accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading and trying to get caught up with the threads that<br/>\nI have missed during the last year or so, that I have been absent from<br/>\nthe list and am enjoying the variety of topics that have come up. <br/>\nSome of the recent threads in particular have piqued my curiosity, but<br/>\nit seems reasonable for us to analyze the assumptions behind some of<br/>\nthe questions that we are asking and to be as clear as possible about<br/>\nthe sources that we use so that everyone has an idea as to the<br/>\nrelative accuracy and authority of the information. <br/>\n<br/>\nGranted that many times we don&#39;t have our references to hand when we<br/>\nare inspired to post, but even in those cases it might be nice to<br/>\nfollow up including the citations in a later post in the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shannon</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-919364843\">Great points made here. I snipped out some of your post in the interest of<br/>\nbrevity and saving bandwidth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that the idea of &quot;The Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai&quot; came about<br/>\nduring the Edo period. This was during the time of peace and various<br/>\nscholars and others of the samurai class were seeking basically for a<br/>\n&quot;raison d&#39;etre&quot; (reason for being) for their class. Many of them began<br/>\nintensive studies of various forms of bujutsu and the concept of &quot;budo&quot; was<br/>\nborn during this era. I read somewhere (not sure where I read it) that the<br/>\nconcept of the sword being a samurai&#39;s soul was first expressed by Tokugawa<br/>\nIeyasu after he became the Shogun, but don&#39;t hold me exactly to this. <br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that a sword was a samurai&#39;s &quot;soul&quot; was designed to make him more<br/>\n&quot;spiritual,&quot; that his sword and study and preservation of budo (martial way)<br/>\nwas an ideal for a samurai to strive for when there was peace and no longer<br/>\nany actual wars for a samurai to practice any bujutsu (martial tactics).<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, this was an idealistic view put forth. In reality, many<br/>\nsamurai became a lot more interested in commerce and administration than in<br/>\nmartial arts; the actual &quot;soul&quot; of the administrative samurai was more<br/>\nlikely to be an abacus rather than a sword. But the daisho (the two swords)<br/>\nbecame a status symbol, a badge showing rank rather than a real &quot;soul&quot; so to<br/>\nspeak.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there were the struggling ronin and low-ranked, low-paid clan samurai,<br/>\nmost who were more concerned with surviving and feeding their families<br/>\nrather than in whether their sword was their &quot;soul&quot; or not. These were the<br/>\nones who would likely pawn their swords and wear hidden bamboo swords. The<br/>\nfilm SEPPUKU deals with one of these ronin who did so. This film challenges<br/>\nthe official, prevailing Edo-era definition of &quot;the sword is the soul&quot; as a<br/>\nconcept that has become empty and hypocritical in the face of rank<br/>\noppression and cruelty. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that there were a few samurai who followed the path of &quot;musha<br/>\nshugyo&quot; the martial journey, traveling all over the country in pursuit of<br/>\nstudying kendo and other budo. But they were most likely in the minority.<br/>\n<br/>\nNina<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Thomas Davidson<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 14, 2005 8:57 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?<br/>\n<br/>\nHang on a minute - <br/>\n<br/>\n[snips]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sword never played a significant part of the samurai psyche until the<br/>\nEdo period and later, when it came to symbolise the &#39;martial way&#39; for what<br/>\nwas by majority a bureaucracy. <br/>\nSwords then began to attain a &#39;value&#39; out of all proportion to that of the<br/>\npast.<br/>\n<br/>\n[snips]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &#39;best&#39; samurai will remain forever anonymous - discreet and efficient in<br/>\nthe service of his master (samurai is from the verb &#39;to serve&#39;) - it&#39;s quite<br/>\npossible he never saw a battlefield, never even drew his sword in anger. <br/>\n<br/>\nThomas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------ Yahoo!

So I quoted just that one part of your post below.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in the earlier thread, we were discussing the qualities of a &quot;good&quot;<br/>\nsamurai. Some people, including myself, brought up two films, AFTER THE RAIN<br/>\nand SEPPUKU. I remember discussing one of the characters in SEPPUKU who had<br/>\npawned his sword blades in order to try and feed his family. According to<br/>\nsome historical accounts I&#39;ve read, this seemed to have happened rather<br/>\nfrequently during the Edo period, with impoverished ronin and sometimes<br/>\nlow-ranked (low-paid) clan samurai pawning their sword blades, replacing<br/>\nthem with bamboo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo with the statement cited below: can it be inferred that a samurai&#39;s sword<br/>\n-- and keeping it -- would be more important to a samurai&#39;s honor than<br/>\nfeeding his family? That it was considered better if the samurai&#39;s family<br/>\nwere to starve to death rather than for the samurai to ever part with his<br/>\nsword? And thus a samurai who sells his sword blades, even to keep his<br/>\nfamily alive, is acting dishonorably?<br/>\n<br/>\nNina<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of raffy yanuario<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 13, 2005 12:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: hitokiri kawakami gensai?<br/>\n<br/>\n[snips.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1174055250\">Thanks for the interesting post about the life of Kawakami Gensai and<br/>\nMasamune and Muramasa swords.<br/>\n<br/>\nJut one point which isn&#39;t really related to any of the above, but relates to<br/>\nan earlier discussion. So I quoted just that one part of your post below.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in the earlier thread, we were discussing the qualities of a &quot;good&quot;<br/>\nsamurai. Some people, including myself, brought up two films, AFTER THE RAIN<br/>\nand SEPPUKU. I remember discussing one of the characters in SEPPUKU who had<br/>\npawned his sword blades in order to try and feed his family. According to<br/>\nsome historical accounts I&#39;ve read, this seemed to have happened rather<br/>\nfrequently during the Edo period, with impoverished ronin and sometimes<br/>\nlow-ranked (low-paid) clan samurai pawning their sword blades, replacing<br/>\nthem with bamboo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo with the statement cited below: can it be inferred that a samurai&#39;s sword<br/>\n-- and keeping it -- would be more important to a samurai&#39;s honor than<br/>\nfeeding his family? That it was considered better if the samurai&#39;s family<br/>\nwere to starve to death rather than for the samurai to ever part with his<br/>\nsword? And thus a samurai who sells his sword blades, even to keep his<br/>\nfamily alive, is acting dishonorably?<br/>\n<br/>\nNina<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of raffy yanuario<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 13, 2005 12:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: hitokiri kawakami gensai?<br/>\n<br/>\n[snips.
