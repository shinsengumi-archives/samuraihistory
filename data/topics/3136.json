            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-346174350\">Between Liz Dalby and several ex-geishas there are some good books on <br/>\nmodern geisha. The amount of training they go through is amazing, one <br/>\nwho&#39;s book I read started training at age 5 or 6! Now they have to <br/>\nfinish junior high before they can start training full time. If your <br/>\nrunning a very late Sengoku period scenario you could have onna Kabuki, <br/>\nclosest you will get to a geisha!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;cepo<br/>\n&gt;(4) Finally, I believe is a good idea to point out how today&#39;s geisha <br/>\n&gt;(and maiko) are NOT prostitutes, but high-class entertainers. While <br/>\n&gt;sexual services were a part of their work in the past, they had always <br/>\n&gt;been different from ordinary prostitutes, for the simple reason that <br/>\n&gt;geisha are trained in the traditional arts - prostitutes are not. <br/>\n&gt;Today&#39;s geisha are professional musicians and dancers, and testimonial <br/>\n&gt;of a disappearing past. I know a few of them personally, and I can <br/>\n&gt;guarantee they&#39;re fantastic women, whose lives are dedicated to art - <br/>\n&gt;not to selling their bodies.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s awesome! I&#39;ve only possibly saw one in the old section of Kyoto <br/>\nin traditional dress.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
