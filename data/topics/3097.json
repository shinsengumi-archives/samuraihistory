He was an American/Canadian/native<br/>\nAmerican who came to Japan in the 1840&#39;s. Somehow he managed to traverse<br/>\nJapan from north to south winding up in Nagasaki. There is a new book on<br/>\nhim. I can&#39;t recall the author or title of hand. What I read about him from<br/>\nother books his adventures sound quite interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also a British doctor who lived in Okinawa for some time prior to<br/>\n1853. His name was Bernard Bettlehiem. You can find his story as well as<br/>\nMacDonalds in &quot;Yankees in the Land of Gods&quot; by Peter Booth Wiley.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) arrive in the country and not be immediately executed<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I recall no intruders into 19th (pre 1853) Japan were executed.<br/>\nMost were incarcerated and later repatriated through Nagasaki.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) endear himself to someone who would teach him the ways of the<br/>\nsamurai<br/>\n<br/>\nDoubt it. Most of the people that befriended the two mentioned above were<br/>\npeasants and fisherman. Besides at this time many &quot;samurai&quot; were starting to<br/>\nquestion the need for the samurai class and the so-called ways of the<br/>\nsamurai. Read Toward Restoration by Harry Harootunian and The Western World<br/>\nand Japan by George Sansom.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Perhaps be involved in the battle of battle of Tonegawa (1844)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell if its a work of fiction why not. However any such act by a foreigner<br/>\nin Japan at that time would be considered very serious.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) perhaps meet Tokugawa Iesada<br/>\n<br/>\nMost unlikely. By this time the Shogun lived a fairly secluded life in Edo<br/>\ncastle. permission to see him was limited to a few senior advisors.</div>",
