Its many feudal<br/>\nlords could field armies greater in size than most<br/>\ngreat European powers of the time could. Also, the<br/>\nvarious religious sects had great influence and<br/>\nstrength, which could rival those all-too powerful<br/>\ndaimyos. It was importing advanced, and therefore<br/>\nexpensive, weaponry (matchlocks, cannons, breast-plate<br/>\narmour) all the way from Europe. Its lords were<br/>\nfinancing the construction of massive strongholds and<br/>\nfortifications.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion is that Togukawa Ieyashu chose to counter<br/>\nthis by making everyone poor. He confiscated and took<br/>\nunder direct (appointing daikan) or indirect (through<br/>\nthe hatamoto families) bakufu control the most<br/>\nstrategically and economically important lands, he<br/>\novertaxed the rest of the daimyo, and he came up with<br/>\nan ingenious hostage system, which also strained<br/>\ngreatly the finances of the daimyo. They had to<br/>\nmaintain two residences (double expenses), travel to<br/>\nand from Edo according to a very strict and luxurious<br/>\nprotocol, etc. Plus they had two counselors (Edo- and<br/>\nKano-Karo), which were usually the actual rulers of<br/>\ntheir particular domain (Edo estate or Han), and often<br/>\nconspired against each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to cope with the above, the daimyo had in<br/>\nturn to overtax their serfs. So the economically<br/>\nstrangled daimyo were in turn doing the same to their<br/>\npopulations, thus doing the job of the bakufu<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, another important factor might have been the way<br/>\nthe bakufu was able to benefit financially from the<br/>\npricing of rice. It was paying its retainers in rice,<br/>\nthe rice merchants bought that cheap, and later on<br/>\nsold it expensive, paying adequate taxes to the<br/>\nbakufu, while at the same time samurai, peasants, and<br/>\neven jikisan retainers were strugling with poverty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it&#39;s been pointed out before &quot;It&#39;s the economy,<br/>\nstupid!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThodoris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
