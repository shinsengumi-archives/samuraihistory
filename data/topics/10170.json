            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1619088293\"> <br/>\n It is not that hard man... you don&#39;t have to be &quot;Japanese&quot; to have and use the crest. Maybe in some parts of  Japan itself people get tight about this..<br/>\n <br/>\n .. but... lets look at a different situation..<br/>\n <br/>\n For many Japanese-living in American and Japanese Americans (immigrants and citizens) it is simply a matter of being brought into the family AND being trusted/liked enough.  Basically, the more important you are, the more &quot;inside&quot; you get... etc.etc.. Especially if that family branch only had daughters and they need an &quot;adopted son&quot; to continue the line.. you think you won&#39;t get the crest?  I can&#39;t imagine someone being so ethnocentric/xenophobic as to let their family line DIE than to place it in the hands of their trusted &quot;adopted son&quot;.<br/>\n Grant it.. we all have probably seen situations where the DAUGHTER will pass it down to the kids, and the non-japanese guy is completely skipped over.. This DOES happen.. but does not HAVE to happen. The key factor is usually the guys involvement in the wife&#39;s family... does he really fit into the family as a &quot;clan member&quot; or.. is he just that white guy that the daughter happened to marry ?<br/>\n    Devotion to the cause plays a big role in this equation. How many white husbands have Japanese wives --but don&#39;t have any interest in Japanese culture or the family affairs ? That is why they are not &quot;in&quot;... because they don&#39;t want to be. <br/>\n <br/>\nANyway.... <br/>\n <br/>\n The choice rest with the family. It is THEIR crest, they decide who wears it. <br/>\n <br/>\n Somone might say that a family does not count if they are outside of Japan--- and to this, all I can say is :<br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;Wow.. I didn&#39;t realize that the simple act of crossing a political border could erase thousands of years of family history ... thats is amazing !<br/>\n Ooohh oohh... If we go BACK to Japan, will that history magically reappear ?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n   Again... it is not about swords, borders, or doctrine... It is about the family itself. If the family authorizes you to wear the crest, you wear the crest. <br/>\n         <br/>\n   So.. like I said before--- either a family takes you in and gives you authorization to wear the crest..<br/>\n .. OR.. you just make one up yourself (like most commoners did at the beginning of the Meiji)  and pass it down..<br/>\n <br/>\n            <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Sun, 4/18/10, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Cearb@...\">Cearb@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Cearb@...\">Cearb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Cearb@...\">Cearb@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Cearb@...\">Cearb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory]<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Sunday, April 18, 2010, 5:36 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy GUESS is that you don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very nearly impossible for foreigners to even get Japanese <br/>\ncitizenship, much less become a member of a traditional family.
