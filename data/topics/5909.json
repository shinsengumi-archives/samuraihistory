            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-977357063\">Another samurai swinging in Edo&#39;s twilight<br/>\n<br/>\nBy MARK SCHILLING<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n <br/>\nOni no Tsume -- Kakushi Ken <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n <br/>\nRating: * * * 1/2 (out of 5)<br/>\nDirector: Yoji Yamada<br/>\nRunning time: 131 minutes<br/>\nLanguage: Japanese<br/>\nCurrently showing <br/>\n<br/>\nAkira Kurosawa never liked to repeat himself. True, &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961) <br/>\nand &quot;Tsubaki Sanjuro&quot; (1962) were strikingly similar in the way the <br/>\ncrafty samurai hero (played in both films by Toshiro Mifune) <br/>\noutwitted his enemies -- but Kurosawa made &quot;Yojimbo&quot; from an <br/>\noriginal script, while &quot;Tsubaki Sanjuro&quot; was based on a novel by <br/>\nShugoro Yamamoto. Also, after these box-office successes, he put <br/>\nMifune&#39;s samurai -- his most popular creation -- into permanent <br/>\nstorage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, Kenji Misumi turned his 1962 hit about a blind <br/>\nswordsman, &quot;Zatoichi Monogatari,&quot; into a series that lasted 26 <br/>\nepisodes, one featuring a showdown between Zatoichi and Yojimbo <br/>\n(which Kurosawa had nothing to do with whatsoever).<br/>\n<br/>\nThough a declared disciple of Kurosawa -- and corecipient of the <br/>\nfirst-ever Akira Kurosawa Award for career achievement at this <br/>\nyear&#39;s Tokyo International Film Festival -- Yoji Yamada is more in <br/>\nthe spin-it-out-forever mold of Misumi. Best known for the 48 films <br/>\nin his &quot;Tora-san&quot; series about a wandering peddler who is forever <br/>\nfalling in love, Yamada has directed or scripted several other <br/>\nseries in his four-decade-long career, including the &quot;Tsuribaka <br/>\nNisshi (Free and Easy)&quot; series about a fishing-crazy salaryman, now <br/>\nin its 15th installment.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years ago, Yamada released his first jidai geki (period drama) --<br/>\n &quot;Tasogare Seibei (The Twilight Samurai).&quot; Based on three novellas <br/>\nby Shuhei Fujisawa, this portrait of a low-ranking samurai who was <br/>\nboth a devoted family man and a death-dealing swordsman swept the <br/>\nJapanese Academy Awards and was nominated for a Best Foreign Film <br/>\nOscar.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven his track record, it&#39;s no surprise that Yamada&#39;s second period <br/>\ndrama is much like his first. &quot;Oni no Tsume -- Kakushi Ken (The <br/>\nHidden Blade)&quot; is not only based on two short stories by Fujisawa, <br/>\nbut also has a storyline similar to that of &quot;Tasogare Seibei.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again the hero, Katagiri Munezo (Masatoshi Nagase), is the <br/>\nsamurai equivalent of a hira (rank-and-file) salaryman, scraping by <br/>\non 30 koku (bales of rice) a year. Once again he is a dab hand with <br/>\na sword, having learned the deadly kakushiken (hidden blade) <br/>\ntechnique from his fencing teacher. And once again the hero falls in <br/>\nlove with a woman, the lovely family servant Kie (Takako Matsu), <br/>\nwhom he considers untouchable (not unsuitable) because of the class <br/>\ndifference between them. (The platonic love of [&quot;Twilight&quot;] Seibei&#39;s <br/>\nlife was from a higher-ranking samurai family.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYamada films this story in the same subdued and realistic, if <br/>\nemotionally charged, style as &quot;Tasogare.&quot; Instead of the dancelike <br/>\nsword fights of so many jidai geki, though, the duels in &quot;Oni no <br/>\nTsume&quot; look sweaty, tiring and dangerous. Also, instead of the theme-<br/>\npark appearance of so many jidai geki, with every kimono and fusuma <br/>\n(sliding door) seemingly brand new, the clothes and sets in &quot;Oni no <br/>\nTsume&quot; have a lived-in, even worn-out, look. Meanwhile, the cast of <br/>\ncharacters, particularly the lower classes, mostly look in need of a <br/>\nlong rest and a few good meals. The full-of-beans folks of so many <br/>\njidai geki, forever about to burst into song or dance are nowhere in <br/>\nsight.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oni no Tsume,&quot; however, is not a two-hour exercise in gloom and <br/>\ndoom. Serious though he may be, Yamada is first and foremost an <br/>\nentertainer who is dedicated to giving his large audience what it <br/>\nwants.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what we get is an opening scene of two samurai friends, Katagiri <br/>\nand Shimada Samon (Hidetaka Yoshioka), bidding a third, Hazama <br/>\nYachiro (Yukiyoshi Ozawa), goodbye at a riverbank as his boat leaves <br/>\nfor Edo (present-day Tokyo), where he intends to work for their clan <br/>\nand seek his fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two stay-at-homes, though sad, are not about to follow him. <br/>\nShimada is looking forward to his marriage to Katagiri&#39;s younger <br/>\nsister Shino (Tomoko Tabata), while Katagiri is living contentedly <br/>\nwith his elderly mother and devoted servant-girl Kie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree years pass. Katagiri&#39;s mother dies and Kie marries a son of <br/>\nthe Iseyas, prosperous oil sellers in town. Meanwhile, waves of <br/>\nWesternization and political change are surging through the Tohoku <br/>\nregion -- and Katagiri&#39;s clan is not exempt. He starts to learn the <br/>\nforeign arts of war (including how to fire a cannon without causing <br/>\nmajor havoc to the people firing them). The age of the sword and <br/>\nsamurai is coming to an end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Katagiri learns that, far from the happy life he had imagined <br/>\nfor her, Kie has separated from her husband and is wasting away from <br/>\nillness. He rescues her, brings her home, where he, Shino and Kie&#39;s <br/>\nyounger sister Bun slowly nurse her back to health. Meanwhile, her <br/>\nfeelings toward him change from gratitude to something more -- and <br/>\nhe finds himself wanting to reciprocate.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut before Katagiri can properly celebrate Kie&#39;s recovery, more bad <br/>\nnews arrives: Hazama has been discovered leading a plot against the <br/>\nclan leaders -- and has been imprisoned in a mountain hut instead of <br/>\nbeing allowed to honorably commit seppuku like the other plotters. <br/>\nBecause Katagiri and Hazama trained at the same fencing school, <br/>\nKatagiri&#39;s loyalty is doubted by the clan&#39;s wily karo (chief <br/>\nretainer), Shogen Hori (Ken Ogata). How can he prove it -- while <br/>\nstaying true to himself?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Katagiri, Nagase is no longer the punkish rebel he played in <br/>\nYamada&#39;s 1991 father-and-son drama &quot;Musuko (My Son).&quot; Instead, here <br/>\nhe is closer to the modest-but-proud samurai Sanada Hiroyuki <br/>\nportrayed in &quot;Tasogare Seibei.&quot; But while the martial-arts-trained <br/>\nSanada impressed more with his sword skills, Nagase is more <br/>\nconvincingly the pacifist at heart who turns to violence only out of <br/>\nextreme necessity -- but knows how to mete it out. The sense of <br/>\nbanked fires that can flare up, which Yamada deployed to good effect <br/>\nin the earlier film, is still present, though Nagase, now pushing 40 <br/>\nand no longer the wild kid, really seems to mean it when he says he <br/>\nwants a quiet life with the woman he loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the world is going mad around you, carving out a small oasis of <br/>\nsanity is no mean feat. Sometimes it helps to have a hidden blade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japan Times: Nov. 10, 2004<br/>\n(C) All rights reserved</div>",
