Hideyoshi&#39;s edicts, for example, were an attempt<br/>\nto prevent the occurance of another Hideyoshi.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome samurai formed alliances with farmers and merchants, offering<br/>\nmutual protection and support. Thus farmers provided for the samurai<br/>\nwho in turn protected them, and issues were discussed &#39;in the round.&#39;<br/>\nAs the larger daimyates engulfed the smaller, this proto-democratic<br/>\nprocess was stamped out vigorously. The Big Names were having none of<br/>\nthat! Democracy? Pah!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side, the Mikawa bushi (for example) were so reduced that<br/>\nthey were obliged to work alongisde their farmers if they were going<br/>\nto eat. Time and again we can read of samurai living on or over the<br/>\nedge of poverty, so that any distinction between &#39;peasant&#39; and<br/>\n&#39;samurai&#39; was largely theoretical. In reality, everyone was starving.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin all this <br/>\n  by <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the wake of the chaos of the Onin wars, point 1 was rendered void<br/>\nas a number of the great samurai houses, domiciled in Kyoto but<br/>\ndependent upon income from distant estates, were so reduced as to<br/>\nbecome powerless. Local estate managers either usurped the rights of<br/>\nthe absentee owners, weakened in the Onin Wars, or simply by filling<br/>\nthe void left by their demise. The Oda were one, and probably the<br/>\nMatsudaira (later Tokugawa) were another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSamurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a>&gt; <br/>\nSamurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a>&gt; <br/>\n--- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
