Also if you think the average Japanese focuses well you should see <br/>\nall the idiots trying to ride bicycles while reading e-mail on thier keitai<br/>\n  Perhaps this is because we DO tend to over-intellectualize things in the <br/>\nWest. My poor Japanese HAS forced me to use ishin denshin while studying <br/>\nKyuudo, but my focus is the same it has been for years while armouring or <br/>\ntraining in different martial art systems.<br/>\n  Side observation. It often seems that the people who believe (key word <br/>\nbelieve) in the &quot;Mystical East&quot; are people who would LIKE to believe in <br/>\nmagic but have too much sense yet are too much of the romantic to give up <br/>\nthe idea that there is SOMETHING more so they transfer that desire to a far <br/>\ndistant and strange land. I undestand that hope. I shared it when I was much <br/>\nyounger, but I have travelled too much and seen too much to give it any <br/>\ncredence.<br/>\n<br/>\nM.J.Peters<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.

That is (very) unlikely, since<br/>\n&gt; the tamahagane would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have had to be folded 20 or 21 times depending how<br/>\n&gt; you count. The point<br/>\n&gt; &gt;being that everytime the steel is folded you are<br/>\n&gt; adding carbon (and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;losing impurities), making it tougher / harder and<br/>\n&gt; thus more difficult<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to fold each time, and making the swords cutting<br/>\n&gt; edge eventually more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;brittle. (the inner core of a sword is not folded<br/>\n&gt; as often as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;outside &#39;skin&#39; for this reason - keeping it<br/>\n&gt; simple).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I believe you will find that the average no. Of<br/>\n&gt; times the outer steel is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;folded will range from 12 - 16.

That is (very) unlikely, since the tamahagane would<br/>\n&gt;have had to be folded 20 or 21 times depending how you count. The point<br/>\n&gt;being that everytime the steel is folded you are adding carbon (and<br/>\n&gt;losing impurities), making it tougher / harder and thus more difficult<br/>\n&gt;to fold each time, and making the swords cutting edge eventually more<br/>\n&gt;brittle. (the inner core of a sword is not folded as often as the<br/>\n&gt;outside &#39;skin&#39; for this reason - keeping it simple).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I believe you will find that the average no. Of times the outer steel is<br/>\n&gt;folded will range from 12 - 16.
