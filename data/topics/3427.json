As most of you will probably know in Japan they produce or<br/>\ndid produce the historical TV dramas called taiga dramas. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course. They have been making them for the past 41 years. This year is<br/>\nthe 44th one and its Shinsengumi.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There are 5 that I&#39;m after in particular. They<br/>\nare:<br/>\n<br/>\nOda Nobunaga - King of Zipangu&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently being repeated on the Family Channel on Cable here in Japan<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Tokugawa Ieyasu&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWill be reshown starting in March on the Jidai Geki Channel<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother channel will start showing &quot;Onna Taiko-ki&quot; from 1981 next month.<br/>\nThese will the first these shows have been repeated. It seems NHK has<br/>\nunleashed its archives. What else may be show we will have to wait and see.<br/>\nHideyoshi, Takeda Shingen, and Dokuganryu Masamune (the Date Masamune<br/>\nseries) were very popular series, so I think there may be agood chance they<br/>\nalso will be shown soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the complete Hideyoshi, Mori Motonari and Takeda Shingen series on<br/>\ntape. I could copy them but the copies don&#39;t come out very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might try and contact a friend in Japan who could tape them. I would but<br/>\nI&#39;ve already got a deal with someone else so my VCR is already doing<br/>\novertime.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are also available in condensed form (down to 4-10hrs depending on the<br/>\nseries) on VHS but they are very pricey running up to several hundred<br/>\nAmerican Dollars. There have also been some complete series done on DVD. Do<br/>\nsome searches for NHK and the series titles to see what you can find.<br/>\nHowever these are not subtitled.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Taiko-ki (which was made in the 60s I think)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n1965 to be exact.</div>",
