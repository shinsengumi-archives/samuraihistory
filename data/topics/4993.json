Being Japanese doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re required<br/>\n&gt; to commit seppuku.<br/>\n&gt; A legitimate point, to be sure.  But by way of<br/>\n&gt; background, my father used a<br/>\n&gt; .30-06 on himself as a way of redeeming his honour<br/>\n&gt; (an oversimplification,<br/>\n&gt; but pretty accurate), and it&#39;s left me with a<br/>\n&gt; profound distaste for that<br/>\n&gt; method of departure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My condolences. I don&#39;t wish to sound callous, but<br/>\nyour feelings seem to be more directed at suicide in<br/>\ngeneral, rather than seppuku in particular. Again, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to be Japanese to commit suicide (as you<br/>\ntragically are aware) and you don&#39;t have to commit<br/>\nseppuku to be Japanese.<br/>\n\t\tThank you.  You don&#39;t sound callous, you sound analytical.  Not a problem.<br/>\nSay rather that my feelings have to do with suicide as a way out of one&#39;s<br/>\nproblems or a method of redemption.  Where there&#39;s room to fight, or cause<br/>\nto live on (as in dependents who will suffer from one&#39;s death), I&#39;d prefer<br/>\nto make my life count for every scrap of advantage or any injury to my enemy<br/>\nthat it can be made to count for.  I can think of cases where suicide would<br/>\nbe a perfectly rational response:  e.g. terminal illness, impending capture<br/>\nby forces known to treat prisoners badly (as noted by another party) (and<br/>\nindeed, I understand that this was the way in which the custom of seppuku<br/>\noriginated).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I agree that &quot;sticking it out&quot; is much more<br/>\nhonorable than what many in the west call suicide,<br/>\n&quot;taking the easy way out&quot;. Even if that way is neither<br/>\neasy nor pleasant.<br/>\n\t\tIndeed.  I may have made it seem my father&#39;s suicide was cowardly:  this I<br/>\ndo not believe, particularly given his deep Christian beliefs (to say<br/>\nnothing of the merciless self-honesty of his last letter).  &quot;Neither easy<br/>\nnor pleasant&quot; is pretty accurate.  From his own perspective, I think it was<br/>\nmore the scenario of &quot;The English gentleman, his family&#39;s finances ruined by<br/>\ninjudicious investments, retires to his study with his Webley service<br/>\nrevolver.&quot;  But to come to terms with it myself, I came to regard it as his<br/>\nversion of seppuku.  I feel he could have done wiser things, but he faced a<br/>\nvery tough and painful decision squarely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;       Thank you for the corrections.  Is it also<br/>\n&gt; incorrect, then, that the act<br/>\n&gt; was filmed?  I had understood this to be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It may have been, I&#39;m not sure. I know that a short<br/>\nwhile before, Mishima made a movie where the pivotal<br/>\nscene was a seppuku (performed by him), a sort of<br/>\nforeshadowing, if you will. The scene was intensely<br/>\ngraphic, and if I believe correctly he actually did<br/>\ncut himself (on accident this time). Copious amounts<br/>\nof fake blood were used. This is third hand info, as<br/>\nI&#39;ve not seen the scene, and only had it described by<br/>\nmy Japanese lit teacher in college (a few years back).<br/>\nThe recreation of the recreation is recreated in the<br/>\nbiographical movie of his life.<br/>\n\t\tRumour being what it is, it would not surprise me at all to learn that<br/>\nthis filmed episode gained the second-hand (or third- or fourth-) reputation<br/>\nof being a film of his actual death.<br/>\n The poet<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; who wrote _The Narrow<br/>\n&gt; Road to the Far North_, even.  (Yet another name<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve forgotten over the<br/>\n&gt; years.)  Again, this is not meant to criticise you.<br/>\n&gt; What is it about<br/>\n&gt; Mishima that affects you so, if I may ask?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Matsuo Basho is the poet you&#39;re looking for.<br/>\n\t\tDamn, was that Basho?  I&#39;d completely forgotten that.  That was the only<br/>\nJapanese poet whose name I could remember, and I didn&#39;t think it was he.<br/>\nAnd I<br/>\nagree, I&#39;ve got no desire to emulate Mishima.<br/>\nPersonally, he was a nutjob, out of touch with<br/>\nreality, as was proven when he attempted to cause a<br/>\ncoup and even the students at Ichigaya laughed at him.<br/>\nThe books of his I&#39;ve read are, well, disturbing.<br/>\nHardly my favorite author, much less someone who&#39;d<br/>\nmake me want to be Japanese.<br/>\n\t\tWell, that was approximately what I was trying _not_ to say to the party<br/>\nwho admired him...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMurakami Haruki, OTOH...<br/>\n\t\tA name with which I am unfamiliar (one of many, as is obvious by now).

The crude terminology was a deliberate attempt<br/>\nto translate the crudity of (my understanding of) the term &#39;hara-kiri.&#39;<br/>\nTo be honest, this attitude is perfectly accepted in<br/>\nthe military today--I&#39;ve had several discussions with<br/>\nfellow army officers where we all said we&#39;d save a<br/>\nbullet in our 9mm for us, should the prospect of being<br/>\ncaptured by the north Koreans (I was stationed twice<br/>\nalong the DMZ) in the event of a war. However, the key<br/>\nhere really isn&#39;t the prospect of dishonor--to any<br/>\ndecent enemy, I&#39;d fight until I couldn&#39;t fight<br/>\nanymore, and then surrender if there was nothing else<br/>\nI could do. However, Charles Jenkins notwithstanding,<br/>\nthe nK doesn&#39;t have a great reputation for treatment<br/>\nof enemy soldiers, as with most communist regimes.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo be fair, this is hardly unique to Communist regimes.  (Vlad the<br/>\nImpaler comes to mind, to say nothing of the Osmanli Turks from whom he got<br/>\nhis, er, education.)  And in the context of this list - that is to say,<br/>\ndragging myself back to Japanese history, I have read that among the<br/>\nJapanese it is regarded as disgraceful to be taken prisoner.  Both prisoners<br/>\nand captors, as I recall, tended to perpetuate this view - to the extent<br/>\nthat captives not infrequently became partisans of their captors, seemingly<br/>\nrequiring a new &#39;identity&#39; to replace that which was lost when they were<br/>\ncaptured.  (This is echoed in Kurosawa&#39;s &quot;Sanjuro,&quot; where the captive ends<br/>\nup cheering at a victory before he recalls whose side he&#39;s supposed to be<br/>\non.)  Another example comes from WWII:  I believe it was on Mindanao where<br/>\nmuch of the civilian Japanese population chose to go off a cliff with their<br/>\nchildren rather than be taken by the Americans.  Even if this view of being<br/>\ntaken alive is not correct - and I can&#39;t recall my sources - there are<br/>\nenough instances of horrific and humiliating executions of important<br/>\nprisoners in Japanese history that I can definitely sympathise with anyone<br/>\nof significance who preferred not to be taken alive.<br/>\n\tAnd even in feudal Europe, for all the modern popular ideas of the<br/>\nchivalric ideal, if you wanted to be taken alive in battle, you&#39;d better<br/>\nmake certain to have been born with gentle blood in your veins:  the Lower<br/>\nClasses (that&#39;d be most of us) were rarely treated well.  For that matter,<br/>\nthe Italians didn&#39;t care how well-bred you were:  they didn&#39;t like taking<br/>\nprisoners, and they didn&#39;t respect class.  Consequence of being a nation of<br/>\ncity-states, I gather, as opposed to a feudal monarchy.<br/>\nI<br/>\nadmire men like John McCain quite a lot, but I&#39;d be<br/>\nsorely tempted to let my wife collect on my insurance<br/>\nrather than face captivity under those conditions.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tBut with all those provisos and exceptions, I&#39;m with you on this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question--where the heck does this &quot;Digest<br/>\nNumber XXX&quot; stuff come from? That wasn&#39;t the original<br/>\ntitle of this thread.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tNo, but I receive the list in digest form:  so I got it all at once, and<br/>\nresponded in kind.

I&#39;ve read of it in a few<br/>\n&gt;books, but have not seen any scholarly verification.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I personally have never heard of this. From a practical point of view<br/>\nit seems like it would be next to impossible to carry off. Plus it<br/>\nseems like it&#39;s confusing things a bit. If this is the seppuku done<br/>\non the battlefield, it&#39;s not always clear that there would be a<br/>\nkaishaku-nin there to cut off the head. If it is the more formal<br/>\nseppuku ceremony, then of course there would be no need to make such<br/>\na distinction -- and in fact the head viewing ceremony took place<br/>\nat a relatively far distance from the body.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFor what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve heard of this... but (surprise!) I do not<br/>\nrecall the source.  I can certainly see how the solemnity of the occasion<br/>\nwould be marred by the head rolling across the tatami.  I also think that<br/>\nwith decent practise, it would not be that difficult to &#39;pull&#39; the cut so as<br/>\nnot to completely sever the neck.  Not to sound boastful, but I think with a<br/>\nfew months&#39; practise I could duplicate that precision - at least, on a<br/>\ntarget that would remain stationary for the purpose.  (You will understand<br/>\nthat my cutting practise does not generally focus on this detail - a<br/>\ngrievous oversight in my training, I grant you.  I humbly crave your pardon,<br/>\none and all.  My school focusses more on battlefield technique than on the<br/>\nstylish execution of seppuku.)<br/>\nThank you all once again for a spirited and informative multilogue.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tGereg</div>",
