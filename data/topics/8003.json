            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-977821039\">Hi Roland,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry to have taken so long to answer your questions. I just got back from doing a sword seminar in El Paso, Texas.<br/>\nBelow is your letter with the answers you seek.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Araki Ryu Iaido a particular &#39;school&#39; of swordsmanship? <br/>\nYes, it&#39;s one of the three oldest classical sword arts. You can find much information about it.  On our site you can read it&#39;s history and see the genealogy  line. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat gives it its distinction? I mean, if you say you follow Araki Ryu Iaido, what does that tell people who know about these things?<br/>\nIt tells student of iaido that we do a very old sword art. Again, it is a very formal and classical sword ryu.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf &#39;three of the four cuts are repeated&#39;, then do you move in a continuous circle until all four attackers are driven off? Can you please describe it to me in more detail? <br/>\nIts hard to describe a technique with words. We start off in a sitting position. Its like looking over head when we start to defend. If you can think of an X on the ground and you in the middle of the intersecting lines then you will have an idea of what is happening. We first make an over head cut to the top right of the X.  Then we turn around and cut to the bottom left of the X (overhead cut). This is followed by horizontal cut to the chest to the 3rd attacker - top left (we are still seating down). To finish we turn to the last attacker (bottom right) and make our final cut to the head. I hope all this makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you presently doing iaido? What city do you live in?<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Corella<br/>\nkenshindojo.net<br/>\nPhoenix, Arizona<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
