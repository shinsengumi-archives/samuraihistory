I don&#39;t know about this subject, so I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like to see your point of view, especially since you are in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; marine, if I remember correctly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cogs and caravelles were no longer being used, I believe, by the mid 16th<br/>\n&gt; century. The Iberian ships traveling around Asia were typically <br/>\n&gt; referred to as<br/>\n&gt; galleons, although in the 1540s they were probably fairly early types <br/>\n&gt; with some<br/>\n&gt; caravelle features still in place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tony<br/>\n&gt; caravelles Were just being replaced out as you say tony, but <br/>\n&gt; portuguese trade post in africa were still actively using them due to <br/>\n&gt; the adapted sail (which i think was arabic in origin) which allowed <br/>\n&gt; the ship to sail headlong. Galleons became the norm ,and it bacame a <br/>\n&gt; kind of arms race in europe to see whom could build the largest and <br/>\n&gt; most decorative. Id imagine the sight of these highly decorated and <br/>\n&gt; large craft to indiginous peoples would be a sign of strength as well <br/>\n&gt; as a practical use. But as you say there maybe be a combination of <br/>\n&gt; both galleon and caravelles so it would be intresting to look at the <br/>\n&gt; early galleons to see if they retain any features of the caravelle. <br/>\n&gt; james willis aka not james wilson lol lizzie<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course, IIRC, the first Portuguese to step on Japanese soil arrived <br/>\non (or from the wreck) of a Chineese Junk. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDan Cooper<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

Galleons became the norm ,and it bacame a kind of arms race in europe to see whom could build the largest and most decorative. Id imagine the sight of these highly decorated and large craft to indiginous peoples would be a sign of strength as well as a practical use. But as you say there maybe be a combination of both galleon and caravelles so it would be intresting to look at the early galleons to see if they retain any features of the caravelle. james willis aka not james wilson lol lizzie<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony J.

Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you&#39;re not a &quot;ringer&quot; posting from middle Ohio?  You made me look up &quot;concatenates.&quot;  I think I heard the word used ONCE back in 1992.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  To the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be wrong, but my ex-wife&#39;s aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have no idea how it is spelled, since I have never ever seen it in print) told me that the great sword makers had stopped making katanas and moved into making kitchen knives, since that&#39;s where the money is.  Now, I can see perhaps where it would be extra handy to have a ginsu knife for chopping garlic instead of your trusty katana, but maybe that&#39;s just me.  Some of you might enjoy the garlic chopping with a larger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged if you do, since that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there any truth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there, just making steak knives for Williams Sonoma?  (Incidentally, the ex and myself are on excellent terms, so no need to fear for my safety.

I was merely thinking of what I commonly do with kitchen knives, and one of them is chopping garlic for a good soffrito, after you&#39;ve cooked the onions in oil to a nice pale transparency (because the onions need to cook longer than the garlic).  No cross necessary for that.  The whole vampire myth- vampires wouldn&#39;t last a week in Italy, would they?<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, why would sword makers be limited in their production of fine blades each year?  Is it a law?  And what would be the purpose of that law, beyond artificially driving the price of each sword up?

Towards the end of the Heian Period, two military clans, the Minamoto and Taira, had grown so powerful that they seized control over the country and fought wars for supremacy against each other. <br/>\nKamakura Period (1192-1333) <br/>\nIn 1185, the Minamoto defeated the Taira, and Minamoto Yoritomo established a new military government in Kamakura in 1192. As shogun, the highest military officer, he became the ruler of Japan. <br/>\nMuromachi Period (1333 - 1573) <br/>\nDuring the chaotic Era of Warring States (sengoku jidai, 1467-1573), Japan consisted of dozens of independent states which were constantly fighting each other. Consequently, the demand for samurai was very high. Between the wars, many samurai were working on farms. Many of the famous samurai movies by Kurosawa take place during this era. <br/>\nAzuchi-Momoyama Period (1573 - 1603) <br/>\nWhen Toyotomi Hideyoshi reunited Japan, he started to introduce a rigid social caste system which was later completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors. Hideyoshi forced all samurai to decide between a life on the farm and a warrior life in castle towns. Furthermore, he forbade anyone but the samurai to arm themselves with a sword. <br/>\nEdo Period (1603 - 1868) <br/>\nAccording to the Edo Period&#39;s official hierarchy of social castes, the samurai stood at the top, followed by the farmers, artisans and merchants. Furthermore, there were hierarchies within each caste. All samurai were forced to live in castle towns and received income from their lords in form of rice. Masterless samurai were called ronin and caused minor troubles during the early Edo Period. <br/>\nWith the fall of Osaka Castle in 1615, the Tokugawa&#39;s last potential rival was eliminated, and relative peace prevailed in Japan for about 250 years. As a result, the importance of martial skills declined, and most samurai became bureaucrats, teachers or artists.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: this is from japan-guide.com, a site which I have just discovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Take Yahoo!
