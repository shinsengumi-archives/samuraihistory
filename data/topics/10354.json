A map would be great, but a general sense would be fine too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, does anyone know how the hostilities began between Kagetora and Kagekatsu?  Kenshin dies in early 1578... and does conflict break out immediately, or is it more gradual?   Kagetora ends up committing suicide in 1579.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is very little information on this conflict, even though it essentially marks the end of all Uesugi expansion, while simultaneously allowing Oda expansion from Echizen through to Ecchu.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks!<br/>\n-dennis</div>",
