Swords would not have been primary weapons and would be<br/>\n&gt; a personal weapon not counted in these registers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for mounted men vs foot soldiers, from 1597 the Shimazu listed the<br/>\n&gt; following (I&#39;m excluding labourers from this list):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 262 mounted men, with 5068 personal followers on foot. 800 other foot<br/>\n&gt; soldiers (landless men, muashi, and squires, kaji ko-sho), and 665<br/>\n&gt; weapon bearers. If we exclude weapon bearers (or dogu, who may or may<br/>\n&gt; not have actually fought in battle, I&#39;m not sure), then that&#39;s 4%<br/>\n&gt; mounted samurai with 96% foot soldiers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -AngusH<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ____________ ________ ________ ________ ________ ________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, <br/>\n&gt; and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.

That only describes a<br/>\nforce of 3,500, but perhaps might be typical, meaning 43% guns, 43%<br/>\nbows, 14% yari. Swords would not have been primary weapons and would be<br/>\na personal weapon not counted in these registers.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for mounted men vs foot soldiers, from 1597 the Shimazu listed the<br/>\nfollowing (I&#39;m excluding labourers from this list):<br/>\n <br/>\n262 mounted men, with 5068 personal followers on foot. 800 other foot<br/>\nsoldiers (landless men, muashi, and squires, kaji ko-sho), and 665<br/>\nweapon bearers. If we exclude weapon bearers (or dogu, who may or may<br/>\nnot have actually fought in battle, I&#39;m not sure), then that&#39;s 4%<br/>\nmounted samurai with 96% foot soldiers. <br/>\n <br/>\n-AngusH<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
