It may be passe, but the fact is, Nobunaga was not<br/>\nonly flexible in war and politics - far more than most of his<br/>\ncontemporaries, but he also knew what it took to unify the country, and went<br/>\nabout it fearlessly and ruthlessly.  Before his attack on Mt. Hiei, where<br/>\n[allegedly] 20,000 men, women and children were slaughtered, he stated, that<br/>\nhe (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) basically threw any semblance of a normal life or<br/>\nthe pursuit of worldly pleasure away for the good of Japan (in order to<br/>\nunify it, and bring peace to it), and since not only had the monks of Mt.<br/>\nhiei stymied his attempts at subjugating the asakura, but done so even after<br/>\nmany warnings, he was forced to slaugher them because they stand in the way<br/>\nof the peace of Japan.<br/>\nUnfortunately, Nobunaga was killed before we could know what his true<br/>\nintentions were, so the validity of that statement can&#39;t be measured, but<br/>\nthe fact does stand that the young upstart from Owari province who due to a<br/>\nfreak occurence (destroying Imagawa Yoshimoto on a fluke) changed the course<br/>\nof Japanese history.<br/>\nIf Yoshimoto had gone through Mino instead of Owari, and challenged or<br/>\nallied with Saito, things would have been completely different, the Oda may<br/>\nhave been crushed in the mid 1560&#39;s by an emperor sanctioned army sent from<br/>\nKyoto by the Imagawa...  <br/>\nOne could argue that Nobunaga sacrificed a &#39;normal life&#39; (whatever that<br/>\nwould amount to during the sengoku) for the good of Japan - although that<br/>\nwas probably not his true motivation, but again, he died probably about 6<br/>\nyears too soon to know what his true intentions were - would he have tried<br/>\nto become Shogun, or taken another title, or ursurp the depose the emperor<br/>\nand make himself emperor?
