            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1867458436\">Japan - Culture and Art in the Edo Period (1603-1867)<br/>\n<br/>\nKOLDING, DENMARK.-Museet på Koldinghus presents Japan  Culture and <br/>\nArt in the Edo Period (1603-1867) - A flourishing time under the <br/>\nShogun. The most ambitious exhibition so far held in Koldinghus <br/>\nMuseum, presented under the patronage of His Royal Highness Crown <br/>\nPrince Frederik of Denmark, has been prepared in conjunction with <br/>\nthe National Museum of Denmark and displays a large number of <br/>\nJapanese artefacts such as Samurai equipment, kimonos, paintings, <br/>\nwoodcuts and refined craftwork. The exhibits are lent by museums in <br/>\nDenmark and abroad, and some of them come from the historical museum <br/>\nin the Japanese town of Anjo, which is Kolding&#39;s twin town. <br/>\n<br/>\nJapan has an unusual and fascinating history, and the Edo period is <br/>\nconsidered to be an era of cultural blossoming in which the art and <br/>\nculture of the elite spread to large sections of society. The <br/>\nexhibition provides a rare insight into many of the old traditions <br/>\nthat have continued to play a major role in modern Japanese society. <br/>\nStories about the Samurai concept of honour and images of the <br/>\nbeautiful courtesans of the Edo period are enduring picturesque <br/>\ncomponents of our knowledge about Japan. The exhibition will be <br/>\nshown from 20 August 2005 until 8 January 2006. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?\">http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?</a><br/>\nint_sec=2&int_new=14680</div>",
