What bothers myself, and Tony, and<br/>\nothers, is when things that are simply WRONG are<br/>\nperpetuated. For example, the samurai in the Satsuma<br/>\nRebellion did NOT fight with bows against a modern<br/>\narmy with firearms--as has been stated, the Japanese<br/>\nhad been using firearms for several centuries, and the<br/>\nSatsuma army had firearms, wore &quot;uniforms&quot;, and wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthis Sengoku style army. Though that makes for better<br/>\ncinematography and wins you Oscars for costume design,<br/>\nso accuracy loses to spectacle. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem isn&#39;t with the STORY--heck, if we can<br/>\naccept Shogun, we can accept anything. It&#39;s the<br/>\ndetails that are flat WRONG, and perpetuate the myths.<br/>\nThat&#39;s what is so frustrating.
