Rather they<br/>\nlived in an overtly-patriarchal society where masculine virtues were <br/>\nheld in high regard (higher than the feminine) and consequently found <br/>\na physical outlet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll overtly-patriarchal societies are marked by same-gender sexual<br/>\nactivity - Greece (as you mention) particularly Sparta, Japan, <br/>\nthe English Public School, etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany notable samurai had &#39;close companions&#39; - notably Oda Nobunaga<br/>\nand Uesugi Kenshin, and I believe Takeda Shingen and Tokugawa <br/>\nIeyasu have been hinted at.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are instructions in &quot;Hagakure&quot; for the proper arrangements (can<br/>\nwe say courtship) between samurai, and the film Gohatto (which by <br/>\nthe way has some splendid sword-play sequences) focusses on just <br/>\nthis point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
