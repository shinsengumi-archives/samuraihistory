While it <br/>\nmay have happened earlier it was when nationalism swept Japan that <br/>\nthe Geisha were seen as one of the symbols of old Japan, and were <br/>\nseen as the quintesential Japanese.  This popularity of the Geisha <br/>\ncaused a boom of 80,000 women in their ranks.  It also caused the <br/>\nwide spread practice of mizuage by the women that owned the geisha to <br/>\ncash in even more on the patriotism of their patrons.  And, I have <br/>\nnot heard of it happening since the end of WWII.  So to say that <br/>\nevery Geisha *SELLS* her virginity it might give the impression that <br/>\nit is still a wide spread practice that continues to this day.</div>",
