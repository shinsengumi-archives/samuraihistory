I<br/>\nlook forward to them.<br/>\nAs to &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; - not only has it been released with revised<br/>\nsubtitles, it&#39;s been restored to its original release length - which had<br/>\npreviously not been shown outside of a few major Japanese cities in its<br/>\nfirst run.  A student of mine also has a DVD version that includes the<br/>\ntheatrical trailer for the film, which is pretty delightful in itself.  But<br/>\nboth of these have been out long enough that I&#39;m not sure either one is what<br/>\nyou&#39;re referring to.<br/>\n\tGereg<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 08 Dec 2004 13:43:58 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tom.davidson@...\">tom.davidson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: movie list (was new gaijin)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of other movies:<br/>\n<br/>\nAme Agaru (After the Rain) - a gentle story<br/>\n<br/>\nTwilight Samurai - another gentle story with some nice kodachi work for<br/>\nthose who recall<br/>\nprevious discussions here...<br/>\n<br/>\n... and Gohatto, more &#39;gay&#39; than &#39;gentle&#39;, again with some excellent dojo<br/>\nfencing which<br/>\ncontrasts nicely with the somewhat wild &#39;cut n slash&#39; of &#39;the real thing&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Kurosawas are, of course, mandatory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard Seven Samurai is being re-released with revised subtitling<br/>\nwhich is somewhat<br/>\nmore &#39;earthy&#39; than the 50&#39;s version.
