The Saga and other earlier rebellions were<br/>\n&gt;about the loss of privileges, really the loss of income as the<br/>\n&gt;government cut back on the stipends they paid out to disenfranchised<br/>\n&gt;bushi.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1217791151\">The movie is, of course, loosely based on the Satsuma rebellion of <br/>\n1877.  Although the story in the film is significantly different from <br/>\nwhat actually transpired in 1877, I found a few themes to be common.  <br/>\nFirst, the origin of the Satsuma rebellion was in the dissatisfaction <br/>\nof the samurai at the ending of their way of life.  Secondly, as with <br/>\nKen Watanabe in the movie, Saigo Takamori did indeed have deep <br/>\nrespect for the emperor.  Finally, the failure of Saigo&#39;s rebellion <br/>\nwas partially due to the fact that he was fighting in an old Japanese <br/>\nstyle, while the Meiji government had westernized their methods.  <br/>\nHowever, it was not really western weapons versus Japanese weapons on <br/>\nthe battlefields of the Satsuma rebellion, since both sides used <br/>\nguns.  Rather, the Meiji government made much better use of western-<br/>\nstyle logistics (reinforcements) and communications (the telegraph).  <br/>\nThe Meiji government was able to get Saigo bogged down in Kumamoto, <br/>\nwhile they sent in reinforcements and eventually overwhelmed him at <br/>\nTabaru-zaka.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, jonathan ellgen &lt;jpellgen@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree there were historical mistakes, but it was a movie and not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>intended to be a documentary or re-enactment. I was actually quite <br/>\npleased with the film despite its short-comings. I felt that it <br/>\ncaptured several powerful emotions which may have been present at <br/>\nthose last moments of samurai existence. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But some of the things you mentioned really don&#39;t bother me.

I am curious about that time period in Japanese history but for learning the actual history, I pick up a book.  As for learning Martial Arts, I study Aikido at the Aikido of Virginia Beach Dojo www.aikido-of-virginia-beach.com and my sensei is very outstanding in his weapons training.  During the one sceen where they were training in the field, I noticed a few familar bokken suburi techniques I have learned in the dojo.  It is very important not to rely on movies to learn.  They are for entertainment only and there is two reasons I can think of for not using movies for research regarding Martial Arts, one is you will look like an fool and two, you can do yourself and others serious injury by showing off your &quot;moves&quot; you learned from the Karate Kid.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Phil in Norfolk<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nina.Boal@...\">Nina.Boal@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          I studied kendo for ten years (until my health took me out). I&#39;m not sure that watching films is the best place to learn sword skills or any other martial arts skills. Do you practice in a school with a sensei? If so, you can ask your sensei about &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; and whatever sword tactics might be included within. If you don&#39;t practice in a school with a sensei, I would try and find a well-reputed school and sign up. This is a much better place to learn sword techniques rather than try and pick them up from films -- which after all are choreographed. <br/>\n<br/>\nNina aka Wave Tossed<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Phillip Michael<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 17, 2007 11:49 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Fwd: History vs The Last Samurai?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell said.

I for one can not stand Tom Cruse and it took every ounce of concentration to ignore his part in the film because I was only interested in the Martial Arts techniques. If one wants to know the true story of that period, pick up a book (sometimes you can&#39;t really rely on the internet for research). As a Civil War reenactor, I picked out several of flaws but that didn&#39;t stop me from learning a thing or two about sword techinques. By the way, I waited till that flick came out on AMC.

Obviously, there is a famous bust of Kondo Isami there. Also, I believe Serizawa Kamo and Hirayama Goro are there as well.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1432861097\">Wow you really have to be kidding...   First on the part about the howitzer <br/>\ncomment...  b/c I do have some expertise when it comes to american weapons.  <br/>\n  The part about the american weapons would probablly  be the most accurate <br/>\nstuff in the movie.  More than likely the Howitzer in the movie was supposed <br/>\nto be the Model 1841 Field Howitzer - 12 Pounder.   (Hint the 1841 was the <br/>\nyear it went into service with the US army) With them even doing a decent <br/>\njob of  showing them max elevating the guns to get to their maximum range <br/>\nwhich was only about 1000 yards.   As a matter of fact most Field artillery <br/>\npersonnel would refer them as guns... i.e. a 4 gun or 6 gun battery.   Not <br/>\nas cannons.  There is a difference between guns and howitzers in that guns <br/>\nshot higher velocities and flatter trajectories and had greater range.  The <br/>\nnomenclature of the weapons themselves started to include both terms gun and <br/>\nhowitzer such as the Model 1857 light 12-pdr gun-howitzer and still actually <br/>\ncalled that today.<br/>\nNow about some of the Japanese references you made.   I cannot speak at all <br/>\non the historical accuracy of the timelines and people involved other than I <br/>\nknow that there was no american involvement (that I am aware of) in the <br/>\nSatsuma rebellion on which the film is loosely based.  Technically speaking <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t aware of any samurai ever carrying more than one Katana.   They <br/>\ncarried katana and wakizashi and from what I remember every battle scene in <br/>\nthe movie, all the samurai are wearing &#39;the two swords&#39;.  The man that <br/>\ncommits seppuku is using a wakizashi... not a katana, and samurai would <br/>\nnever use a katana to commit seppuku.  It is always was a wakizashi or <br/>\ntanto, with the tanto being used quite often.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinja&#39;s... you might as well get ready to be fragged for that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the battle...  Calvary with swords vs light infantry with actually <br/>\nweapons with with rifled barrels and cartridges... i will stand with the <br/>\ninfantry on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a personal note, I enjoyed the movie.  I have seen so many people really <br/>\ndissect this movie about historical inaccuracies, when I wasn&#39;t aware the <br/>\nmovie was suppose to be a documentary.  I didn&#39;t see in the beginning <br/>\ncredits &quot;based on actual events&quot;.  How often does a movie get it right <br/>\nanyways?  &#39;Blackhawk down&#39; was full of inaccuracies, just like &#39;We were <br/>\nSoldiers&#39; was as well, and both of those movies were based on actual events. <br/>\n  Movies rarely come close to being right when they are just based on a <br/>\nnovel, much less an actual historical event. I also didn&#39;t recall anywhere <br/>\nthroughout the movie Tom Cruise gettin up and saying &#39; I am the last <br/>\nsamurai&#39;.   I don&#39;t recall him ever refering to himself as a samurai period. <br/>\n   I actually thought he did a decent job with the swordplay, being a novice <br/>\npractioner of Iaido myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with the anime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;keiman0&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KeimanZero@...\">KeimanZero@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Fwd:  History vs The Last Samurai?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 13 Apr 2007 16:44:56 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:animeontv@yahoogroups.com\">animeontv@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;keiman0&quot; &lt;KeimanZero@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I finally got to see the Tom Cruise/Ken Watanabe flick The last<br/>\n&gt;Samurai<br/>\n&gt;and I was appalled at all of the stupid historical mistakes that were<br/>\n&gt;in it.

I was actually quite pleased with the film despite its short-comings. I felt that it captured several powerful emotions which may have been present at those last moments of samurai existence. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut some of the things you mentioned really don&#39;t bother me. For example, the suggestion that an outsider would be taken in the way Tom Cruise&#39;s character was... That is obviously part of what makes the story interesting, not particularly anything historical. We know that William Adams was taken in, as you alluded too, but that hardly would make it a common thing. As far as seppuku is concerned, there was really no end to what type of bladed instrument a samurai might have used. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while I agree that it isn&#39;t the best source of historical information, I still found it to be acceptable from an entertainment point of view. Film is a much more widely accepted form of media than anime, and I am fairly confident that more English-speaking people were willing to watch Tom Cruise than watch Japanimation. Cruise&#39;s character was, afterall, a civil war captain... Not necessarily a samurai. <br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan P.
