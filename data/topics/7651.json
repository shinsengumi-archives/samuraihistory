            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-465387952\">SAMURAI 7: VOLUME 1 - SEARCH FOR THE SEVEN DVD REVIEW<br/>\n<br/>\nFeatured review by Paul Melia, Contributing Editor<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything old is new again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s like deja vu all over again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe English language is filled with sayings about the circular <br/>\nnature of existence. We just cannot seem to break free of the desire <br/>\nto revisit themes or events that we have experienced before. Just <br/>\nthink of that cousin that kept doing the same dumb thing over and <br/>\nover again. So what does all of this have to do with anime?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, in Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Samurai 7, we are treated to <br/>\na &quot;reimagining&quot; of the classic tale of conflict between seven <br/>\nhonorable warriors and the fallen nobles turned thieves that prey <br/>\nupon the helpless. But this update is an uncomfortable marriage of <br/>\nold and new. Wars are fought with huge flying fortresses and cyborg <br/>\nsamurai but everyone still uses swords. Society is technologically <br/>\nadvanced but still uses rice as currency. It all looks great but <br/>\nthere is very little explanation why a world with huge Matrix-like <br/>\nmachines would also look like feudal Japan. Which brings us back to <br/>\nthe &quot;everything old is new again&quot; theme. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the recent Steamboy, Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) conceived a <br/>\nVictorian London filled with amazing modern machines all powered by <br/>\nsteam. He went to great lengths to make the viewer believe that all <br/>\nthe gears and boilers worked to achieve the results. In Osamu <br/>\nTezuka&#39;s Metropolis, mechanical people and fantastic machinery exist <br/>\nbelievably in world vaguely set in the roaring &#39;20s. And we would be <br/>\nremiss in not mentioning the works of Leji Matsumoto (Star Blazers, <br/>\nQueen Emeraldas, Captin Harlock, Galaxy Railways) where WWII <br/>\nbattleships, pirate ships and steam engine trains all zip across <br/>\nspace. The point is that all of these series combine old with new <br/>\nbut make it believable. Unfortunately, Samurai 7 doesn&#39;t quite <br/>\nsucceed at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not to say that this is a bad series. Gonzo (Last Exile, <br/>\nKiddy Grade, Blue Submarine No. 6) has done a remarkable job. 3D and <br/>\ntraditional animation have been seamlessly combined and the artwork <br/>\nis superb. The characters range widely in style though, with the <br/>\nleads lovingly drawn while supporting characters can be quite <br/>\nunusual in appearance. The background audio is a subtle but <br/>\neffective mix of traditional Japanese instruments and modern pieces <br/>\nthat convey the mood perfectly. Also, the script has been nicely <br/>\nadapted, keeping Kurosawa&#39;s unique combination of action, drama and <br/>\nhumor. There is plenty of all three and no anime fan will be <br/>\ndisappointed with this series.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a DVD, Samurai 7 soars. Funimation has given this title loving <br/>\nattention and it shows. The English cast is perfect - the voices are <br/>\njust what you&#39;d expect when you first see the characters. Even <br/>\nchallenging characters such as the cyborg samurai Kikuchiyo come <br/>\nacross great. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe video is presented in 16:9 widescreen format and the sound comes <br/>\nin immersive English and Japanese 5.1 or standard English and <br/>\nJapanese stereo. The disc and packaging come chock full of extras as <br/>\nwell. The case includes a great action painting of the samurai in <br/>\naction running the full width of the interior and a hefty book full <br/>\nof interviews and artwork. The disc offers character profiles, <br/>\npromotional videos (including a five-minute piece that gives much of <br/>\nthe new story&#39;s background), an image gallery, textless songs and <br/>\nFunimation trailers. It is all very cleanly executed though some of <br/>\nthe menus are so subtle that they are bit difficult to navigate.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne minor bone to pick with Funimation - their recent discs have <br/>\ncome with long promotional videos for other titles that play before <br/>\nthe menu appears. On the Samurai 7 disc, that meant spending 1 <br/>\nminute and 30 seconds watching a promo that cannot be skipped over <br/>\nbefore the menu appeared. The promos were nice but having the option <br/>\nto skip over them would have been even nicer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Samurai 7 is an ideal sci-fi/action <br/>\nadventure. It has cool heros, nasty nasties and plenty of stuff to <br/>\nlook at. Just don&#39;t try to explain why the super science is <br/>\nthere...it just is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ugo.com/channels/dvd/features/samurai7/volume1.asp\">http://www.ugo.com/channels/dvd/features/samurai7/volume1.asp</a></div>",
