I can tell by reading your emails that you all know what u are<br/>\n&gt; talking about and I would be very grateful if u could suggest some<br/>\n&gt; websites books and anything relating to samurai history. I have already<br/>\n&gt; got my hands on some books (by Stephen Turnbull who I am told is<br/>\n&gt; somewhat of an expert in this field) but I am looking for books that<br/>\n&gt; focus more on the armor and the mons of the samurai.
