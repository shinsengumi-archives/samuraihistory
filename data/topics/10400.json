The land in that area is really beautiful, but there was not (at the time) too much preservation or many displays.  Supposedly there may have been some renovation of the site(s) since then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought Gifu was a really great site.  I loved the sky cable car I had to take to get to the top, and you could see how powerful of a position the castle was.  This great little mountain surrounded by lush fields and a nearby river (or at least that&#39;s how I remember it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also saw Nagahama.  It was nice, nothing special.  The best part of Nagahama was a map they had inside the castle showing the locations of other important castles (and how far away they were).  It really hit home that the big players were fighting over very small stretches of land--and the major castles were often no more than a day or two apart (by horse) and no more than a few hours away by car.<br/>\n<br/>\nI skipped Sekigahara (train went by it) because it looked toooo touristy.  I like to be able to explore on my own, and my japanese was good enough back then to talk with the occasional random person when I got lost or confused.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;scott_rekishika&quot; &lt;scottc_4@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as I know Himeiji Castle will still be under reconstruction for a couple more years at least.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1600543970\">Sekigahara 1600<br/>\nLocation: Gifu Province, Japan<br/>\nType of Battle:Extended meeting engagement<br/>\nCombatants: Western Army commanded by Ishida Mitsunari. Eastern Army commanded by Tokugawa Ieyasu, assisted by Kobuayawaka Hideaki<br/>\nResult:A resounding victory for Tokugawa faction, leading to eventual victory in the Sengoku Jidai – a long series of civil wars.<br/>\nAccessiblity:Good, by rail and road<br/>\nOther: Battlefield monument, museum and ‘Warland’ battle theme park with excellent display of arms and armour. Shrine to the defeated Western Samurai near railway station. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntroduction <br/>\nJapan in the 16th Century was torn apart by almost continuous civil war between rival clans and<br/>\ntheir daimyo, or warlords, each<br/>\nseeking to establish a military governorship of the islands with the title ‘Shogun’. <br/>\nRuling over them all was the<br/>\nsemi-divine Emperor, who legimitised temporal power by his presence, but took<br/>\nvery little part in day-to-day politics. Some families by clever political<br/>\nintrigue had managed to elevate themselves to high status social rank, and<br/>\nestablish governorship over large areas of Japan. By the later 16th century chief among these clan leaders were Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen,<br/>\nUesegi Kenshin, Toyotomi Hiyedoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. From 1573 onwards, Oda<br/>\nhad established control over most of the islands, but was murdered in 1583 by<br/>\nrebellious followers. He was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who became ruler<br/>\nof most of the country and established his capital at Kyoto, with Osaka Castle<br/>\nas his chief fortress. On his death in 1598  a regency for his infant son was established<br/>\nunder Tokugawa Ieyasu, Maeda Toshiie, Uesegi Kagekatsu, Mori Terumoto and Ukita Hideie, each vying with the other<br/>\nfor supremacy. It was a poisonous mixture that could only lead to further<br/>\nbloodshed.<br/>\nSoon Tokugawa Ieyasu had<br/>\nattracted by far the largest number of followers and tried to set himself up as<br/>\nheir to the Hideyoshi shogunate on the death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599. Faced by<br/>\npotential risings on every quarter, Ieyasu left Osaka with the bulk of his<br/>\ntroops to menace the Uesegi clan. His enemies gathered an enormous force of<br/>\n128,000 men, mostly from the Western part of Japan, hence known as the ‘Western<br/>\nArmy’. They camped around the pass of Sekigahara in October 1600, east of<br/>\nKyoto, in order to try conclusions with the ambitious Ieyasu.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Battle <br/>\nIeyasu had received intelligence of his enemy’s intentions,<br/>\nand knew that Kobayakawa Hideaki was prepared to come over to his side, along<br/>\nwith all his samurai and ashigaru,<br/>\nthe ordinary foot soldiers. Early in the morning of 21 October Ieyasu’s forces<br/>\nmoved into the attack and after some delay Hideaki’s forces treacherously<br/>\njoined the general melee against his erstwhile allies.<br/>\nOutnumbered and outflanked, Mitsunari fled and his troops<br/>\nsurrendered – about 9,00had been slaughtered on the field. Soon afterwards<br/>\nIeyasu was able to assume the regency, hunting down  Mitsunari and having him executed. Ieyasu set<br/>\nup his capital at Edo, the site of  modern Tokyo, and in 1603 was appointed Shogun by the emperor. Rivalry<br/>\nwith the Toyotomi clan brought further conflict at Osaka in 1615, but the the<br/>\nTukugawa Shogunate remained in place and lasted after the death of Ieyasu until<br/>\n1867, overseeing a lengthy period of peace and stability. Under the aegis of<br/>\nthe Tokugawa shoguns, the warrior elite of Japan turned their energies to less<br/>\nwarlike pursuits, becoming loyal servants of the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nSekigahara Today <br/>\nThe Tokugawa camp is now the site of a public park<br/>\nopposite the town’s museum, where there is a significant collection of arms and<br/>\narmour from the time of the battle. Extensive battlefield trails exist for<br/>\nwalkers to explore the area, and the kessen-ba,<br/>\nthe site of the final denouement of the fighting, is marked by a stone obelisk.<br/>\nThe entire site can be viewed from Mount Sasao after a brisk walk, where Ishida<br/>\nhad his camp. Opposite here, the slopes of Mount Matsuo give a panoramic view<br/>\nof the battlefield from the point of view of Kobayakawa Hideyaki.<br/>\n<br/>\nSekigahara ‘Warland’ is a modern theme park near the<br/>\nbattle field with plaster statues of various warriors in authentic poses, and<br/>\nwhile this will not necessarily appeal to everyone, it does house a very<br/>\nimpressive display of armour of the period.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: docwho499 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:docwho499@...\">docwho499@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Saturday, 25 February 2012, 19:28<br/>\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Any recommended battle tours in central Japan (&lt;2hr from Koyto )??<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nAny recommended battle tours in central Japan (&lt;2hr from Koyto )??<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
