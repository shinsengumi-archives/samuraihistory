I appreciate your comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I am honored and privileged to have a friend such as Yasuhiro, <br/>\n(Ken) Komatsu. I have known Komatsu-San for 20 years, first as <br/>\nbusiness associates then as friends. Ken was employed by a company <br/>\nwhich was the Japanese distributor for my company&#39;s products.<br/>\n<br/>\nKen was the best English speaker with his company and as such was <br/>\nsent to the U.S. for 6 months to learn better English and our company <br/>\nproducts. As Manager Far East I spent much time with him. My company <br/>\nalso spent $ 7000 on Japanese language lessons for me, so we could <br/>\nconverse pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been greatly honored by being invited several times to visit <br/>\nhis home, not common in Japan where most entertaining is done <br/>\nelsewhere, and he has visited mine. I became well acquainted with his <br/>\nfamily; his father, wife and two children.<br/>\n<br/>\n I took early retirement in 1992 and a few years later Komatsu-San <br/>\nchanged companies. I very much regret that I have not been able to <br/>\nvisit Japan since I retired, but Komatsu-San has been to the U.S. <br/>\ntwice and each time has visited me, at some effort since I live in an <br/>\nout of the way community now. We correspond by e-mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough during my career, I have been so lucky as to be able to <br/>\nvisit, often numerous times, some 40 countries in Europe, the Middle <br/>\nEast, Central and South America, and Asia as well as Australia, I <br/>\ngrew to love Japan and the Japanese people most. I have never met any <br/>\npeople who work so hard, and play equally hard, who are so worldly <br/>\nwise, yet cherish their gardens, temples, and Cherry blossums. Had I <br/>\nnot had a business reversal losing a lot of money, I had planned to <br/>\ntry and live in Japan for a year or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I can never repay Ken&#39;s wonderful gift to me, he sort of thinks <br/>\nI have. He is a great fan of Glen Cambell and Andy Williams. During <br/>\none of his visits I took him to see Andy Williams in Branson and he <br/>\ntold me that was the best Christmas present I could ever give him. <br/>\nLast fall, he brought his Wife to the U.S. for the first time and I <br/>\ntook them both to see Andy Williams and Glen Cambell. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat amazed both him and me was how his wife, who speaks virtually no <br/>\nEnglish, could disappear, going to the ladies room for what seemed <br/>\nlike ages, and when we would go looking for her we found that, <br/>\nthrough the language barrier, she was conversing with an American <br/>\nwoman and within 15 minutes they knew all about each others children <br/>\nand lives.<br/>\nPerhaps its through such simple things that world understanding and <br/>\npeace will someday be achieved.<br/>\n<br/>\nBud<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, tom helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Bud-<br/>\n&gt; \tYou are very lucky to have such a friend.

There <br/>\nis <br/>\n&gt; also Tsubaki abura, or camellia oil which some prefer because it <br/>\nhas <br/>\n&gt; little or no odor.

You need aks him if it is a <br/>\n&quot;shinsakuto&quot;or a &quot;Iaito&quot; (mogito). If it is an Iaito then you need <br/>\nonly keep it clean, if it is a shinsakuto you&#39;ll need a cleaning kit.<br/>\n\tFor a traditionally made Japanese sword a cleaning kit is <br/>\ntissue or better yet rice paper, a ball of uchiko and choji oil. <br/>\nUchiko is a mild abrasive used to clean off the old coating of oil <br/>\nbefore an application of a new one. the Choji oil is usually a <br/>\nmineral oil with a hint of choji (clove) for fragrance, this is most <br/>\nassuredly NOT the same oil used for toothache so be careful. There is <br/>\nalso Tsubaki abura, or camellia oil which some prefer because it has <br/>\nlittle or no odor. Uchiko is made from the &quot;sludge&quot; or by product of <br/>\nthe uchigomori stone used in polishing. Literally &quot;child of the <br/>\nUchigomori&quot;. There are several grades but for Shinsakuto it matters <br/>\nlittle.<br/>\n\tIf your saya is new, remember that it was likely not made for <br/>\nyour climate but that of Japan. If the fit of the habaki or collar on <br/>\nyour sword/saya is tight do not force it but leave a 1/4 inch of it <br/>\nout of the saya. It is expected that in a new saya the opening will <br/>\nbe very tight, in a dryer climate it may contract and crack. There is <br/>\nlittle maintence for a well made saya...<br/>\n\t-t<br/>\n<br/>\nif you believe you have a true nihonto I invite you to visit the <br/>\nfollowing link and to join the &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihonto@yahoogroups.com\">nihonto@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm</a></div>",

Advise will be <br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, this is a modern sword and is sold in Japan <br/>\nunsharpened. Sholud I leave it that way? Is it possible to sharpen <br/>\nthese swords? If so is it desirable to have it sharpened?<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though the sword is not sharpened, My friend had to get a police <br/>\npermit to buy one. This took several months. On the way to the <br/>\nstates, three times he was required to open the box and show it to <br/>\ninspectors at various airports.<br/>\n<br/>\n Even though this this is not a collectors item it is very beautiful <br/>\nand authentic looking and I am very proud of it. I have another <br/>\nsword, but that was is very cheap looking with lots of plastic on the <br/>\nhandle. (Also a gift however, so the thought was there.)</div>",
