The Turnbull map is a much larger <br/>\nscale than the maps I&#39;ve been linking to. The map from the book is <br/>\nindeed oriented the same way - North is up. But the scal is so much <br/>\nlarger, that Uji appears as just a dot. The maps that I&#39;ve linked to <br/>\nrecently basically show &quot;inside the dot&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person were to mark where the Byou-dou-in is on that Turnbull <br/>\nmap, it would just be a tiny dot inside the circle that is marked <br/>\nUji.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way thanks for going to the effort to scan the map. It makes <br/>\nthe conversation much easier!<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a></div>",
