I am currently attempting to persuade them to issue <br/>\nsome books on the Battle of Ueno since I have hardly been able to find any books on the <br/>\nbattle in English.  If you have an interest in seeing an English-language book written about <br/>\nthem, please send them an email.  You can get their conact info at <br/>\nwww.ospreypublishing.com.  Just a few minutes of your time and we might be able to <br/>\npersuade them to make a valuable contribution to military history students.</div>",
