            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1032354103\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   From: tom helm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junkmail@...\">junkmail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tIn the study of Japanese Art swords all descriptions are <br/>\n&gt;given in Sun Shaku and in CM.s<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool! I figured the metric system had completely taken over. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: Dave Jackson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nihontonut@...\">nihontonut@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: gun tactics<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Volly fire of guns was first used in Japan at the battle of Nagashino in 1575. My question is, <br/>\n&gt;is this the first time it was employed anywhere? When was this tactic first used in Europe?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maurice of Nassau was mucking with linear tactics in 1584 as well as <br/>\nuniform drills and the like, before then starting around 1500, Gonzalo <br/>\ninvents the prototype for what becomes the Tercio. This is a roughly <br/>\nhalf pike and gun formation of about 1 to 3,000 men. I don&#39;t know if <br/>\nthey volleyed, but they did keep up a continous fire. My references <br/>\ndon&#39;t give enough details to be sure but sometime prior to 1584 might <br/>\nnot be too rash.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samurai-listowner@...\">samurai-listowner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;What might be overlooked is that the technique used by Nobunaga to <br/>\n&gt;keep a continuous hail of bullets flying at the enemy [at Nagashino] -<br/>\n&gt; having the front row of musketeers move to the back to reload, <br/>\n&gt;allowing the next row to fire - was not even realized in Europe until <br/>\n&gt;almost twenty years after Nobunaga&#39;s application, in the 1590&#39;s. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like an interesting book, but this description sounds like what <br/>\nthe Europeans were already doing with the Tercio and their multiple <br/>\nranks of arquebusers. They would fall back to reload inside the pikes <br/>\nwhile their fellows sallied out to fire again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Europe because it was inferior to having everyone blast away at once <br/>\n&gt;which would cause greater shock and chaos in the enemy ranks, or <br/>\n&gt;something essentially to that effect...  any thoughts on this?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, the gunners in a Tercio cannot all fire at once, period! They are <br/>\nseveral ranks deep and the earlier weapons required forks to rest on <br/>\nwhich means you can&#39;t even have a kneeling rank along with a standing <br/>\nrank. Also drill until roughly the 1590&#39;s was kind of a hit or miss affair.</div>",
