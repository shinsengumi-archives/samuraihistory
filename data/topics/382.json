Saya clashing (saya-biki? I can&#39;t remember the <br/>\nterm) was an unforgivable offence and when it happened swords <br/>\nwould be drawn instantly - effectively it was an invitation to <br/>\na duel.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Gunsliger&#39; type samurai would strut round the streets with the <br/>\nsword worn almost flat across the stomach so the saya stuck out <br/>\nas far as possible to the side. More restrained samurai would <br/>\nwear their swords something over 45 degrees across the body - <br/>\nutilising the curve of the blade to keep the saya to the rear <br/>\nas much as possible, whilst a small move of the left hand on <br/>\nthe saya would move the butt of the hilt towards a potential <br/>\nenemy to the front, ready for a draw.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a lovely move by a venerable old iai master who showed a <br/>\nway to avoid this unfortunate occurance:<br/>\n<br/>\nLeft hand sits naturally on top of the saya just below the <br/>\nhilt, thumb next to belly, knuckles facing out. As the <br/>\n&#39;gunslinger&#39; (or should that be saya slinger?) approaches, just <br/>\nbefore the clash, the old man tightens his grip, turns the <br/>\nknuckles downward and at the same time pulls his fist up <br/>\ntowards his shoulder. This action &#39;screws&#39; in his saya and the <br/>\nsword ends up held close in and parallel to the body, thus <br/>\navoiding the clash!<br/>\n<br/>\nBad guy, who missed the move, also having missed his mark, <br/>\nstumbles uncertainly and the old boy then draws his sword and <br/>\ncuts him down with ease!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all in a day&#39;s work.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom</div>",
