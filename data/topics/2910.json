The fact that he fought on the losing side<br/>\nand survived should at least speak of his ability to<br/>\nsurvive.  Beyond that, I&#39;ve read that he participated<br/>\nin a few of Ieyasu&#39;s &quot;closing&quot; battles so to speak.  I<br/>\nbeleive Sekigahara was the battle to decide the rule<br/>\nof the country, of course, but there&#39;s always a bit of<br/>\ncleaning up to do after such battles.  Rebel factions,<br/>\nthe decimation of the Toyotomi family line, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is nevermind the fact that being a great<br/>\nswordsman and a great warrior do not always go hand in<br/>\nhand.  To duel with a single or even multiple<br/>\nopponents is something very differt from soldiering. <br/>\nIn personal duels you have many more options and more<br/>\noppertunities to make precision cuts than in a large<br/>\nscale battle (reference: 45 year old opponent who<br/>\nkicked a rock in my face before rushing me with a<br/>\nkama-gusari!  You&#39;d be hard pressed to do that in<br/>\nbattle!).<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:murphymurphyjohn@...\">murphymurphyjohn@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Musashi has perhaps a greater reputation as a<br/>\n&gt; swordsman than deserved.
