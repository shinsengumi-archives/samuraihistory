Lastly, samurais were warriors. Japan, of this time, was under a feudal system. In a feudal society, warriors always maintain the highest rung in society.

I said it contrasted.  <br/>\nSecond, I don&#39;t recall Julius Ceasar&#39;s &quot;Ode to a Summer Morning&quot; or <br/>\nRichard the Lionheart&#39;s &quot;Study of Roses.&quot;  The point I&#39;m making, it <br/>\nshows duality but not all warrior cultures highly prize artistic <br/>\nexpression, especially among the warriors.  Lastly, samurais were <br/>\nwarriors.  Japan, of this time, was under a feudal system.  In a <br/>\nfeudal society, warriors always maintain the highest rung in <br/>\nsociety.  With that said, I asked what was their choice of <br/>\nentertainment.  Within that, I mentioned training and the playing of <br/>\nshogi.  Those can&#39;t be the only examples of war like entertainment.  <br/>\nUnlike Rome, the samurai, in particualr before the edo period, <br/>\nprepared for war constantly and were measured more by prowess in <br/>\ncombat.  Yet, they didn&#39;t relish in bloodshed as much as their Roman <br/>\ncounterparts.  There has to be some other examples.  Drinking, <br/>\nwomanizing, and gambling: I don&#39;t view these as war like <br/>\nentertainment because all males participate.  I&#39;m sure wealth <br/>\nmerchants endulged as much if not more then the samurai.</div>",
