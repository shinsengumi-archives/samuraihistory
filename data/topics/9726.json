            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-575965474\">I agree with Greg.  I used to be very dismissive of these modern replicas, but a young friend of my daughter&#39;s boyfriend works for the Australian company Global Gear.  At his invitation I have looked at some Hanwei swords and I have to say I was very impressed.  The price/quality equation is superb.  The sugata (shape) is very good and the togi (polish) is also amazingly good.  The hamon (&quot;temper line&quot;) appears to be real, i.e., water quenched.  To top it all off there is visible hada of a sort.  Even the koshirae (mounting) is a quite reasonable looking facsimile of the real thing.  Now, a Nihontô lover&#39;s collector sword it ain&#39;t, but for AUD$500 up it is the closest thing anyone is going to get to a real katana.  The CEO of Hanwei is Mr CHEN CHAO-PO and I have seen a DVD produced by him about his company, swords and personal philosophy.  I was really surprised to discover that his son Ron has studied with the famous Japanese swordsmith Yoshindo Yoshihara in Japan - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samuraisword.com/nihontodisplay/other/yoshindo/index.htm\">http://www.samuraisword.com/nihontodisplay/other/yoshindo/index.htm</a> for those not familiar with the world of Nihontô.  I am fortunate to have a sword made by Yoshindo&#39;s grandfather Yoshihara Kuniie.  Whilst, as Greg notes, &quot;Hanwei swords were never intended to be collector swords&quot;, I would nevertheless commend such a sword to a non-practitioner as a good &quot;substitute example&quot; for a real katana that would cost thousands of dollars for the equivalent real thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nBarry Thomas<br/>\n(Melbourne, Australia)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:INRSTRGTH@...\">INRSTRGTH@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 09, 2008 1:46 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Hanwei Swords<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I never meant to claim that they would be a &quot;Collector&quot; sword.
