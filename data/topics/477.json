Price wise it is high but the package certainly looked worth the while..<br/>\n www.buyubooks.com<br/>\n And type &#39;Gorin no Sho&#39; into the search engine there.<br/>\n You could also have a look at the other Miyamoto Musashi books they offer there for more information on his style.<br/>\n Also &#39;SeiDoKai&#39; supplies have copies of their own books written as an aid to learning the forms as practised in the Niten Ichi Ryu and taught by Shihan Imai Masayuki in Japan. Type Seidokai into a search engine and you will find the site easily enough.<br/>\n Hope this helps.</div>",
