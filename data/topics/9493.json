For the rest <br/>\n  of us- We now have two distinct dates. 1545 and 1615. Remember <br/>\n  jakotsu&#39;s encounter with the matchlock wielding riflemen? There were <br/>\n  no flintlocks in Japan before the Portugese came in 1545. In 1615 the <br/>\n  Tokogowan victor&#39;s (NobuNaga) first act (after using rifles to win <br/>\n  the Great Battle which united the clans in 1615) was to ban and <br/>\n  outlaw &#39;all&#39; firearms. Therefore it is twixt 1545 and 1615 that IY is <br/>\n  laid. Another one for you- why are IY and his bro considered &#39;Lords&#39;? <br/>\n  More later.
