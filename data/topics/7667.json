The only problem is that any information seems to stop after <br/>\nKuki Yoshitaka&#39;s victory in the second battle of Kizugawaguchi and <br/>\nHideyoshi&#39;s release of his anti-piracy edict.  I need to know what <br/>\nhappened to the Murakami in the time between their defeat, and <br/>\nTokugawa&#39;s rise to power.  Did they cease to exist as a naval power <br/>\naltogether?  Also, any information on naval battles in the Seto area <br/>\nduring that time, especially those involving the Murakami, Kuki, or <br/>\nMori, would be useful. <br/>\n   I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve exhausted all of my resources on this, any help <br/>\nwould be tremendously appreciated.</div>",
