Speculating, though, is still fun to do, and as a(n <br/>\nunpublished) fiction writer, I do it ALL the time with various situations that I <br/>\nwrite about.  Pertaining to history, I used to do it all the time with the end <br/>\nof the Tsars when I was a more concentrated student of Russian history, and my <br/>\nquery to Tony some time ago about the alt-history novel about Nobunaga&#39;s <br/>\nsister, O-ichi.  But in order to speculate, it helps to know the history anyway.  <br/>\n:-)  And history is, IMHO, a fascinating subject anyway.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nL8r<br/>\nTim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

Hitler killed 5.7 million people simply because they <br/>\nbelonged to a race, or because he considered them inferiors. They were <br/>\nnot people on his path, he sent out over half of Europe his Gestapo and <br/>\nspecial extermination squads to get them, and to murder them. Hitler&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;final solution,&quot; the ultimate decision of killing ALL Jewish, is <br/>\nsomething you can not compare with Nobunaga&#39;s will to unify Japan at <br/>\nall costs. Nobunaga did not build concentration camps where thousands <br/>\nof people were killed every day after they were exploited as slaves.<br/>\nAnd besides that, Nobunaga was born in the middle of a civil war, while <br/>\nHitler started a World War... How can you compare them? Hitler lived <br/>\n400 years later than Nobunaga, in a different continent, and in a <br/>\ntotally different contest.<br/>\nSure, you can speculate that, given the chance, Nobunaga would have <br/>\ndone as bad as Hitler, but... ***speculate*** that&#39;s it.<br/>\nHistory is a different matter.
