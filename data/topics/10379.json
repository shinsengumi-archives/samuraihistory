Some of the &quot;translations&quot; look like they are either historical or glossary-like descriptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis FAQ:<br/>\nQ: I found an error in your translation/scanlation/research. What do I do?<br/>\nA: Good for you! Please email me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes me think that some of the translations are historical, and the Otate no Ran article is written in a way that suggests looking at historical sources.<br/>\nAdditionally, the glossary has an &quot;historical/real people&quot; section.  And while not every entry completely matches what the equivalent entry at Samurai Archives says, they appear to align well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also &quot;sources&quot; at the bottom of many/most articles.
