            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1663595245\">Michael -<br/>\n\tI think you&#39;ve expressed Nate&#39;s essential philosophical view here, in fact, and rather better than he&#39;s done so far.  And you make a very good case for it.  But I truly don&#39;t think it&#39;s projection.  (For that matter, I tend to think the same of feline and canine emotions:  they&#39;re not the same as human emotions, to be sure, but as far as I can tell, they&#39;re not as far removed from it as a lot of folks seem to think, either.)  I could be mistaken, to be sure, but I&#39;ve experimented with the possibility of projection - it is, after all, the most culturally obvious one - and it simply doesn&#39;t feel right.  It doesn&#39;t seem to accurately describe the sensations that take place in a sword&#39;s proximity, let alone in the handling.  More close to the mark might be - note I say &quot;might&quot; - the idea that we are capable of endowing objects technically regarded as inanimate with a certain degree of self and spirit, under certain circumstances.  That&#39;s one I&#39;m not quite prepared to swallow, myself, but I acknowledge that it could be the case.  If this is projection, however, it&#39;s a lasting variety well beyond the ordinary usage of the term.<br/>\nHowever, I appreciate the voice of moderation.<br/>\n\tGereg<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 14 Dec 2004 11:21:00 +0700<br/>\n   From: &quot;Michael Peters&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwstel@...\">shdwstel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: swords (was ...Eras)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If you want to argue that a sword has &quot;spirit&quot; as any<br/>\n&gt;piece of art would, I&#39;ll buy it.

Let&#39;s take a different approach. You pick up<br/>\n*something* that you are trained to handle. The weight, balance and feel are<br/>\nperfect for *you*, not in any way you can express. Something subliminal.<br/>\nThen that object *speaks* to you. I know I felt that way the first time I<br/>\npicked up a Glock 19 (and proceeded to put an extended clip in a silver<br/>\ndollar sized circle at 30 yards. Some of my best shooting ever). Sure a<br/>\nstandard issue M1911A1 will do the job, but it doesn&#39;t feel the same. For<br/>\nthe same reason I haven&#39;t bought a takeyumi at Asahi. Nothing there *spoke*<br/>\nto me. As a craftsman, lots of things *speak* to me on some level. I expect<br/>\nit&#39;s projection, like people ascribing human emotions to thier pets.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wouldn&#39;t worry about it unless the gollum conversations begin. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nM.J.Peters<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

To: Tony Bryant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhello tony,<br/>\n  com&#39;on man,...it was pretty good.?? I&#39;ve seen a handful &quot;samurai&quot; movies in the past, (and yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but this is the 2000&#39;s, not the 1900&#39;s (lol). People like to see cool stuff like the Last Samurai even if it isn&#39;t all that accurate. You can&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve seen any better Samurai &quot;battle&quot; scenes in another movies from the past?? (if so, please let me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great movie to boost the Samurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of people to respect them for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate history stuff & think i&#39;m a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome movie. They were like....&quot;Wow, those guys could really kick butt&quot; I don&#39;t know,....maybe i&#39;m wrong??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more insentive to practice kendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in the making,....delayed temp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watch it again and tell me that<br/>\n those battle scenes don&#39;t want to make you get up, build a time machine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hopefully a good one), and fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese back then were only like 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(lol). Well, my times up. Have a good one.<br/>\n                                                             Yours,<br/>\n                                                                Mark<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony Bryant &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ajbryant@...\">ajbryant@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nmark kd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if you buy the movie book(or just go to your local book store and look at<br/>\n&gt; it), it will tell you what is accurate and what is not(to some extent).

There is so much that&#39;s wrong with it historically that I almost<br/>\ncried. Yeah, the armour&#39;s pretty. Yeah, the battles are fancy. But historically<br/>\nit was totally crapola.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, I&#39;d think that Watanabe Ken and Sanada Hiroyuki ought to be<br/>\nembarrassed. They&#39;ve each made dozens of films -- some crappy, some really good<br/>\n-- and the one they get international reputations for is this American &quot;Dances<br/>\nWith Samurai&quot; piece of steaming, fetid poop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally caught it on HBO last night, after months and months of refusing to go<br/>\npay to see it, rent it, or buy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt made me sick.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTony<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony J.
