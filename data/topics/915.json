Some <br/>\nDaimyo did not. Uniformed ashigaru seemed to be used during the main <br/>\nperiod of Sengoku about 1570-1600. My dates might be a bit off but it <br/>\nseems to me to coincide with the rise of professional ashigaru during <br/>\nthe later years. Each ashigaru would have one if so organized.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW is your real name Nuno Pereira??? I ask because I am Portuguese <br/>\nand that name rings a bell regarding a general by I believe the same <br/>\nname during the wars vs Castille in the late 14 th century.</div>",
