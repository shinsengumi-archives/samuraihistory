A duraluminum blade would be just fine; it&#39;s for a costume, <br/>\nafter all.  I&#39;m more concerned with the proper shape and reasonably accurate <br/>\nfurniture.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, most of what I see for sale is crap, and the stuff that isn&#39;t crap I can&#39;t <br/>\nafford (I could probably swing up to $150 per blade, but $500 per blade is out of my <br/>\nleague).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, the things people have the gall to label &quot;samurai sword&quot; astounds me.  <br/>\nSome of &#39;em look like freaking steak knives.  :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Cerebus</div>",
