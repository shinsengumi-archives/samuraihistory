I do not<br/>\nwant to say if this is sad or not here, but this<br/>\nhappens just because it is insane to compare Japan now<br/>\nwith the Japan of 300 years ago.   Perhaps japanese<br/>\ncould think in the same way, but want keeps them<br/>\nrolling and living now is simply different than the<br/>\ncircumstances of 300 years ago.   <br/>\nAnd please notice that I am talking about japanese<br/>\npeople, that is because we supouse that they now more<br/>\nabout this form of life than anyone else.<br/>\nSo now what can we say about western people.<br/>\n   I want to put you an exemple :   Remember this poet<br/>\nMishima ?
