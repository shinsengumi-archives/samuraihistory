There is no doubt that many nations had assassins and <br/>\nhired killers and Japan I&#39;m sure is no exception. But I have read <br/>\nthat Ninja, as such, are a myth and are the subject of storytellers <br/>\nand some fanciful notion that there was a dojo specifically for the <br/>\npurpose of training these super human elite. We&#39;ve read the stories <br/>\nand seen the films, so over to you all, if they did exist where is <br/>\nthe evidence?<br/>\n<br/>\nKEYOKE.</div>",
