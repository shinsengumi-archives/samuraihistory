I think justify<br/>\nsuch actions by the poorest people using the word &#39;&#39;politics&#39;&#39; is a<br/>\nsilly thing. They can be poor but are not stupid.

The same as the atempt to<br/>\nchrash into 1600 Pensylvania Avenue. And that my friend is a political<br/>\nstatment. Politics and Religion are the same thing when used to control<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nWTC was and still is a symbol of the capitalist world of trade and the<br/>\nUSA is the foremost country in the capitalist world. Pentagon is the<br/>\nsymbol of your (I asume you are american) military power. 1600<br/>\nPensylvania is the symbol of US policys, leedership and the very heart<br/>\nof the USA. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe exact things that the Al-Quaida opposes on RELIGOUS grounds.<br/>\nReligion is what they use as a means to justify their actions agains the<br/>\nUSA. They see the USA as a threat to their way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that sound familiare? The USA say that the Al-Quaida and other<br/>\nterrorist organisations is a threat to the &quot;American Dream&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this not politics?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why is it politics? The USA have interfered with the internal<br/>\naffaires of Mideast, when not invited. This is a series of cause and<br/>\neffects dating back to neolithic age. If you fail to realise this and<br/>\ndon&#39;t study history you are doomed to repeat it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you say muslime, it is not all muslime who wants to blow the western<br/>\ndevils to bits, but rather a small group of radical religous people.<br/>\nMany muslim countries does not want to atack the USA. Egypt, Saudi<br/>\nArabia, Quatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, India (has some<br/>\nmuslims, but the majority is Hindu) only to mention some.  Granted, they<br/>\nmay not see eye to eye with USA, but thats only natural. <br/>\n<br/>\nHell half of Europa doesnt see eye to eye, but we have a Union together<br/>\nand have taken a revolutinary step to change the Currency of every EU<br/>\ncountry. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf one continues to follow the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; doctrin, wich by the way<br/>\nis even older than the Koran, the world will come to an end sooner than<br/>\nany of us really want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut thats besides the point. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are discussing Evil, and its nature. The Taliban and Al-Quaida are<br/>\nnot evil, they just follow an outdated religous law, that hasent been<br/>\nrevised since the days of muslim Spain. Understanding and respecting<br/>\neach others differences is what will unite this planet, and it is our<br/>\ndiversity and conflicts (not necesarily armed militay conflicts) that<br/>\nhas made us as a human species so prominent. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, things are always more complex in their nature than to say it<br/>\nis evil. You must see the cause to understand the effect. Evil in it&#39;s<br/>\nclassical definition is very simplistic. Evil seeks the destruction of<br/>\nman and her world.  But it does not give us an explaination as to why<br/>\nthe Evil seeks the destruction of the world of men.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time, there was this guy who suggested how nice it woulf be<br/>\nif everybody just stoped fighting each other and started to be nice.<br/>\nThey _naild_ him to the nearest tree and fought for the next 2000 years<br/>\nabout how he said it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you have caught me at a bit of a disadvantage, since I havent heard<br/>\nof B2B and Merkava.

Just plain stupid in my view.<br/>\n&gt; I dont belive in pure/diluted evil. I think that is a figment <br/>\n&gt; of the christian church imagination. Hitler was insane, yes. <br/>\n&gt; He hurt/killed alot of people and suronded himself with <br/>\n&gt; people of the same belief. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides, there is no really good definition on what evil is.<br/>\n&gt; Is one Evil for wanting to kill some one?<br/>\n&gt; Is one Evil for wanting world domination?<br/>\n&gt; Is one Evil for wanting to make money at any cost?<br/>\n&gt; Is one Evil for wanting to hurt someone ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But what about the reason of these desires?<br/>\n&gt; What is the cause of them? And what will be the effect of them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; During the mideval ages, Evil was everyone who opposed the <br/>\n&gt; church, since they were in liason with the devil. If you said <br/>\n&gt; something that differd from the church doctrin, say the earth <br/>\n&gt; is not the center of the univers, or the earth is not flat. <br/>\n&gt; Then you were evil and in liason with the devil. <br/>\n&gt; If you were an unknown coutry with <br/>\n&gt; black/yellow/red/blue/green skin colur, with unknown kultural <br/>\n&gt; standards and belief. You were evil heretics until you <br/>\n&gt; accepted jesus christ savior bla bla.. Until then you made <br/>\n&gt; good slaves, and colonies. Teh concept of Evil was used as a <br/>\n&gt; method of control.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One could say that the British Empire was Evil, for using <br/>\n&gt; Opium to force china into submission.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some People I know say that USA is evil for interfering with <br/>\n&gt; other states internal buissness. Like getting Noriega (he was <br/>\n&gt; a CIA operative, but defekted after he got<br/>\n&gt; elected) elected president and then assainated. USA put <br/>\n&gt; Pinochet into power, and as such made life a living hell for <br/>\n&gt; alot of people. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are always a cause and an effect. This to is important <br/>\n&gt; to remember.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Take the now famous 9/11 incident. <br/>\n&gt; The most elaborate, complex and best executed guerilla <br/>\n&gt; opperaiton ever peformed by terrorists. Now why on earth <br/>\n&gt; would some one want to kill off five to seven thousand people <br/>\n&gt; in a building? <br/>\n&gt; Basically to make a point. The terrorists didnt care about <br/>\n&gt; the people in the buildings, that only came as a bounus. It <br/>\n&gt; was what those buildings represented that matterd. It was an <br/>\n&gt; awfull act, and persoanly I was in chock for three days. I <br/>\n&gt; have relatives in the states so naturally I was concernd. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was that an evil act? If you ask the americans, it was <br/>\n&gt; definatly the ultimate and purest Evil. But it was nothing <br/>\n&gt; but a political statement from a group of people who thinks <br/>\n&gt; that USA should butt out of their internal buissness. <br/>\n&gt; I mean come on! Do you really think that the midle east is a <br/>\n&gt; new problem? Hell no! It has been a hodgepodge of assorted <br/>\n&gt; violence and territorial aggression for over 5000 years. And <br/>\n&gt; the only difference now from then is that they have the <br/>\n&gt; capacity to wipe each other out totally. They are pissed off <br/>\n&gt; at the americans/allied for getting involved in a several <br/>\n&gt; thousand year old conflict, and were telling them, and any <br/>\n&gt; other nation that might get the idea to get involved to &quot;stay <br/>\n&gt; the fuck away&quot; (pardon my language). If you dont, we will <br/>\n&gt; make sure that you feel the effects of your actions in our <br/>\n&gt; home, at your home. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So the cause to ther 9/11 effect was all the acumulated <br/>\n&gt; actions the USA/Allied had done in the past concentrated in <br/>\n&gt; one opretaion. <br/>\n&gt; The effect after 9/11?<br/>\n&gt; USA bombed two countries back to the darkages, and what to <br/>\n&gt; continue with Iran. Is USA Evil for doing so? Oh no would <br/>\n&gt; most people say, they are only defending themself from evil. <br/>\n&gt; Yeah, but you have to considerd what the other side will say <br/>\n&gt; about this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They say that they were defending themself from the ultimate <br/>\n&gt; purest form of Evil. Gerorge W Bush Junior the apostel of <br/>\n&gt; satan. Sounds familliar?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, we are all friendly peacefull people, arent we?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I say everything is a matter of point of view. And in most <br/>\n&gt; cases, economics and religion are the major contributers to <br/>\n&gt; so called &quot;evil&quot; events. And in a few cases insanity with a <br/>\n&gt; little help from economics and religon can end up in <br/>\n&gt; disatorus events. Like the world wars, Togukawa regime and <br/>\n&gt; emperor Xiang of china. The guy who united al of china and <br/>\n&gt; built the great wall of china. He did kill a lott of people, <br/>\n&gt; was a cruel bastard, and probably slightly YoYo in the head. <br/>\n&gt; But he did unite china, and gave it a very stable future. <br/>\n&gt; Evil or not? Point of view. <br/>\n&gt; (BTW, I have _no_ idea how to spell Xiang&#39;s name, I&#39;m guessing this is<br/>\n&gt; correct)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other question we must ask ourself is this.<br/>\n&gt; Does the means justify the goal?<br/>\n&gt; or does the goal justify the means?<br/>\n&gt; Emperor Xiang probably thought that if he united the people <br/>\n&gt; of what was to be &quot;China&quot;, a period of peace and prosperity <br/>\n&gt; would come. And the country would flourish in the fields of <br/>\n&gt; science and economics. But it would all come at a high price. <br/>\n&gt; He aparently thought it was worth it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My point in all of this rambling is this.<br/>\n&gt; 1. Evil is a matter of point of view. <br/>\n&gt; 2. History is written by those who survive and comes out on <br/>\n&gt; top of things. 3. Does the goal justefy the means, and does <br/>\n&gt; the means justify the goal. 4. Evil is a word used to <br/>\n&gt; describe &quot;the others&quot; in a way to de humanise the opposit side.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And as such I do not belive in evil, deluted or pure, it does <br/>\n&gt; not matter for it is all a point o view. For it is all just <br/>\n&gt; the effect of a prior event. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /// Chris the agnostic realist<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;We are friendly peacfull people. we&#39;re not the ones out <br/>\n&gt; there causing troubble&quot; -The streets &quot;Irony of it all&quot; (as I <br/>\n&gt; was saying it is just a point of view -C)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Burker1@...\">Burker1@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Burker1@...\">Burker1@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: den 8 juni 2003 04:23<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 521<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not always just a matter of one&#39;s &quot;point of view&quot;.

Your logic is flawed, you <br/>\n&gt; state that there is a social protocol we must adhere too in <br/>\n&gt; one statement, and then you go on to state that each culture <br/>\n&gt; has its own standard by which to live by.  So I guess in your <br/>\n&gt; logic I (being a country) can invade you (being another<br/>\n&gt; country) for reason that are only believed or adhered too by <br/>\n&gt; my country and be in the right.  Or I being a thief can <br/>\n&gt; invade your house and still money and say that society did it <br/>\n&gt; to me, I need to steal to survive, and not get punished.  <br/>\n&gt; Thank God there is a an ultimate moral truth or there would <br/>\n&gt; be complete anarchy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How are the world wars an example of the moral codes being <br/>\n&gt; bent.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-949037389\">Ah, now we are getting somewere.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, I must say that I have experienced my fair share of horrible<br/>\nevents, and I have been treated very badly by some really sadistic<br/>\npeople. I do not say they are evil, I say they are either sick and needs<br/>\nhelp, or misguided. I even go as far as to forgive them, but I never<br/>\nforget what has happend in the past. I hope you understand if I do not<br/>\ngo into detail as it is some very unpleasant memories for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorals and Etics are standards of behaviour that define our relatuions<br/>\nwith each other. These standards are accepted as protocolls of<br/>\ncomunication and are based on the thought that we can all live together<br/>\nif we have an unspoken law that govenrs our behaviour. I.E. I dislike<br/>\nyour hairdo, I punch you on the nose. BUT this leads to a new set of<br/>\nevents, it just so happens to be socialy unacceptable and<br/>\nuncommunicative to hit people in the face if you dont like their hairdo,<br/>\nI go to prisson. <br/>\nOkay this is a very simplistic chain of events, but it makes your and my<br/>\npoint clear. I break the social protocoll of standardised behavioural<br/>\npatterns established for the sake of us living together and for us to<br/>\ncomunicate, then I must face the consequenses. It is when these Morals<br/>\nor standard protocolls are faceing each other that friction occures.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay now to the nature of Evil part. You say that one must be devoid of<br/>\nemotion (or mentally insane) or has never had something bad happen to<br/>\nthem. And that Evil is based on moral truth witchis absolute. But this<br/>\nis where you falter, my friend. Moral truth is not absloute, different<br/>\ncultures have different moral values.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a country guided by, say for the sake of exampel, the Sharia (Muslim<br/>\nlaw provided by the koran and its comments). It is not moraly wrong to<br/>\nslay a woman who has been in bed with a man outside of wedlock.<br/>\nAu contrare, it is encouraged to slay her. It is not evil, it is<br/>\nnecessary for the clan/family to retain its honor.<br/>\nIn the western world it would be imoral to have a sexual relationship<br/>\noutside wedlock, but the woman most sertainly would not be stoned to<br/>\ndeath. She would be either thrown out of her family, or if it was the<br/>\nold days, be the center of the village gosip and a subject of<br/>\nharrasment. If you would rais your voice against the Ming dynasty, you<br/>\nwould be arrested for treason and probably killed, not moraly wrong<br/>\nsince he/she was a security threat. In Western world, the person would<br/>\nbe called an inconveinence and not untill actions against the government<br/>\nhad been taken, would imprisonment and possible death sentence be<br/>\ndeliverd.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent culture equals different moral codes. And as such there is no<br/>\nabsolut moral code.<br/>\nAnd even the moral codes can be bent and deformed, the world wars are<br/>\nexcelent examples of that. The inquisition is an excelent example of<br/>\nthat to. By saying that the person that is the target of torture is not<br/>\na humanbeeing, but rather an animal or a demon, and that you are doing<br/>\nthis for your own survival, is in essence a defomation of moral code.<br/>\nChristians say &quot;Thou shalt not Kill&quot; even so they have committed alot of<br/>\nhideous crimes. The Germans during the second world war killed<br/>\nhomosexuals, communists, Jews, and political dissidents with the excuse<br/>\n&quot;they are not Arian&quot;. And this allowed them to act under the belief that<br/>\nthis is not a moral crime. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you consider Cows to have a social valu? Yes, you consider them food,<br/>\nand as such you kill them and eat them as food. Why? It is conciderd<br/>\nmoraly to be our perogative since we are on top of the food chain. Even<br/>\nso, the cow does not have a sens of awareness and it doesnt play chess.<br/>\nWhat do we know, have we ever spoken to a cow? Does it consider us Evil<br/>\nfor slaying it and eating it? No it is an animal, it doesn&#39;t feel a<br/>\nthing...<br/>\n<br/>\nSame reasoning of morals different target of cruelty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo people outside these defined moralcodes are called Evil to make it<br/>\neasier to kill, maim, torture and in other ways seriously hurt their<br/>\nfeelings. <br/>\nI do not doubt that someone is capable in commiting acts of cruelty.<br/>\nThey can be a saidist. Someone who likes to hurt people. That doesnt<br/>\nmean they are Evil. They could have a reason for hurting me, beeing<br/>\nafraid or feeling cornerd. Political or religious pressure can also be<br/>\nan incentive to hurt me. Forcing a difernet view on me, and I sease to<br/>\nbe a human, and become an &quot;it&quot;, making it easier for the agressor to<br/>\nhurt me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if one does not have feelings, one can not commit acts of cruelty,<br/>\nbut acts of logic behaviour.<br/>\nIf there are no feelings, one have no concept of pain, suffering and<br/>\npleasure. If you have no notion of that, then you can not take pleasure<br/>\nin hurting someone. Your acts will be governd by logic. And logic by it<br/>\nself is a sort of moral code.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you on the other hand are mentally disturbed, and take pleasure out<br/>\nof someones pain, and have no problem of killing me, you or a child.<br/>\nThen that persona has a different set of moralcodes that he/she abides<br/>\nto. And If that persona acts out in accordance to this moral code, he<br/>\nhas not broken it. It does not nessecarily mean that he is &quot;Evil&quot; but<br/>\nmore of a social problem that has to be adressed and contained since<br/>\nhe/she acts not out of the established commonly accepted standards of<br/>\nbehaviour, and as such poses a problem. Thats not Evil, its mentally<br/>\nill. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if different sets of moral codes exist, then two different points of<br/>\nview exsists. QED.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor intrinsic Evil to Exist, intrinsic Good has to exist. <br/>\nNone of them exist to my knowledge. <br/>\nShow me one intrinsicly good beeing that I as an agnostic can accept<br/>\ndoes not have any flaws in its reasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I will admitt my reasoning to be faulty.<br/>\n<br/>\n/// Chris <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a personal note: I really like to discuss with you people, its fun<br/>\nand educating for me. I have not meant to hurt anybodys feelings with my<br/>\ndiscussion, and from prior experience of mailing lists I know that<br/>\ndiscussions can get very intense. And so if I have hurt anybodys<br/>\nfeelings I Sincerly apologise, for that was not my intention. I sincerly<br/>\nhope that everybody has enyojed this discussion as much as I have. =)</div>",

So any organization that does that, whether its al quaida or the united nations, is evil.  That also goes for individuals.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe terrorist my friend where trying to kill people, sorry to let down.  There mission was to kill as many Americans as possible.  That is what terrorist do.  Use terror as a weapon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnything or anyone that tries to control another person or people unjustly is wrong.  Religion, political group, whatever, its wrong.  What you seem to forget here is that the terrorist attacked the US.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes radical Islam is the problem most Muslims are not radical in nature.  But groups like al quaida that want to make all western Christendom Muslim are evil and wrong.  Again going to my point earlier that anybody that wants to control another unjustly is wrong<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd regarding Jesus Christ he was and still is for just war.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nGreg Quaresma<br/>\n&quot;There are no atheist in foxholes&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gquaresma@...\">gquaresma@...</a></div>",

The same as the atempt to<br/>\nchrash into 1600 Pensylvania Avenue. And that my friend is a political<br/>\nstatment. Politics and Religion are the same thing when used to control<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nWTC was and still is a symbol of the capitalist world of trade and the<br/>\nUSA is the foremost country in the capitalist world. Pentagon is the<br/>\nsymbol of your (I asume you are american) military power. 1600<br/>\nPensylvania is the symbol of US policys, leedership and the very heart<br/>\nof the USA. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe exact things that the Al-Quaida opposes on RELIGOUS grounds.<br/>\nReligion is what they use as a means to justify their actions agains the<br/>\nUSA. They see the USA as a threat to their way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that sound familiare? The USA say that the Al-Quaida and other<br/>\nterrorist organisations is a threat to the &quot;American Dream&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this not politics?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why is it politics? The USA have interfered with the internal<br/>\naffaires of Mideast, when not invited. This is a series of cause and<br/>\neffects dating back to neolithic age. If you fail to realise this and<br/>\ndon&#39;t study history you are doomed to repeat it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you say muslime, it is not all muslime who wants to blow the western<br/>\ndevils to bits, but rather a small group of radical religous people.<br/>\nMany muslim countries does not want to atack the USA. Egypt, Saudi<br/>\nArabia, Quatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, India (has some<br/>\nmuslims, but the majority is Hindu) only to mention some.  Granted, they<br/>\nmay not see eye to eye with USA, but thats only natural. <br/>\n<br/>\nHell half of Europa doesnt see eye to eye, but we have a Union together<br/>\nand have taken a revolutinary step to change the Currency of every EU<br/>\ncountry. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf one continues to follow the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; doctrin, wich by the way<br/>\nis even older than the Koran, the world will come to an end sooner than<br/>\nany of us really want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut thats besides the point. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are discussing Evil, and its nature. The Taliban and Al-Quaida are<br/>\nnot evil, they just follow an outdated religous law, that hasent been<br/>\nrevised since the days of muslim Spain. Understanding and respecting<br/>\neach others differences is what will unite this planet, and it is our<br/>\ndiversity and conflicts (not necesarily armed militay conflicts) that<br/>\nhas made us as a human species so prominent. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, things are always more complex in their nature than to say it<br/>\nis evil. You must see the cause to understand the effect. Evil in it&#39;s<br/>\nclassical definition is very simplistic. Evil seeks the destruction of<br/>\nman and her world.  But it does not give us an explaination as to why<br/>\nthe Evil seeks the destruction of the world of men.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time, there was this guy who suggested how nice it woulf be<br/>\nif everybody just stoped fighting each other and started to be nice.<br/>\nThey _naild_ him to the nearest tree and fought for the next 2000 years<br/>\nabout how he said it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you have caught me at a bit of a disadvantage, since I havent heard<br/>\nof B2B and Merkava.

Just plain stupid in my view.<br/>\n&gt; I dont belive in pure/diluted evil. I think that is a figment <br/>\n&gt; of the christian church imagination. Hitler was insane, yes. <br/>\n&gt; He hurt/killed alot of people and suronded himself with <br/>\n&gt; people of the same belief. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides, there is no really good definition on what evil is.<br/>\n&gt; Is one Evil for wanting to kill some one?<br/>\n&gt; Is one Evil for wanting world domination?<br/>\n&gt; Is one Evil for wanting to make money at any cost?<br/>\n&gt; Is one Evil for wanting to hurt someone ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But what about the reason of these desires?<br/>\n&gt; What is the cause of them? And what will be the effect of them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; During the mideval ages, Evil was everyone who opposed the <br/>\n&gt; church, since they were in liason with the devil. If you said <br/>\n&gt; something that differd from the church doctrin, say the earth <br/>\n&gt; is not the center of the univers, or the earth is not flat. <br/>\n&gt; Then you were evil and in liason with the devil. <br/>\n&gt; If you were an unknown coutry with <br/>\n&gt; black/yellow/red/blue/green skin colur, with unknown kultural <br/>\n&gt; standards and belief. You were evil heretics until you <br/>\n&gt; accepted jesus christ savior bla bla.. Until then you made <br/>\n&gt; good slaves, and colonies. Teh concept of Evil was used as a <br/>\n&gt; method of control.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One could say that the British Empire was Evil, for using <br/>\n&gt; Opium to force china into submission.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some People I know say that USA is evil for interfering with <br/>\n&gt; other states internal buissness. Like getting Noriega (he was <br/>\n&gt; a CIA operative, but defekted after he got<br/>\n&gt; elected) elected president and then assainated. USA put <br/>\n&gt; Pinochet into power, and as such made life a living hell for <br/>\n&gt; alot of people. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are always a cause and an effect. This to is important <br/>\n&gt; to remember.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Take the now famous 9/11 incident. <br/>\n&gt; The most elaborate, complex and best executed guerilla <br/>\n&gt; opperaiton ever peformed by terrorists. Now why on earth <br/>\n&gt; would some one want to kill off five to seven thousand people <br/>\n&gt; in a building? <br/>\n&gt; Basically to make a point. The terrorists didnt care about <br/>\n&gt; the people in the buildings, that only came as a bounus. It <br/>\n&gt; was what those buildings represented that matterd. It was an <br/>\n&gt; awfull act, and persoanly I was in chock for three days. I <br/>\n&gt; have relatives in the states so naturally I was concernd. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was that an evil act? If you ask the americans, it was <br/>\n&gt; definatly the ultimate and purest Evil. But it was nothing <br/>\n&gt; but a political statement from a group of people who thinks <br/>\n&gt; that USA should butt out of their internal buissness. <br/>\n&gt; I mean come on! Do you really think that the midle east is a <br/>\n&gt; new problem? Hell no! It has been a hodgepodge of assorted <br/>\n&gt; violence and territorial aggression for over 5000 years. And <br/>\n&gt; the only difference now from then is that they have the <br/>\n&gt; capacity to wipe each other out totally. They are pissed off <br/>\n&gt; at the americans/allied for getting involved in a several <br/>\n&gt; thousand year old conflict, and were telling them, and any <br/>\n&gt; other nation that might get the idea to get involved to &quot;stay <br/>\n&gt; the fuck away&quot; (pardon my language). If you dont, we will <br/>\n&gt; make sure that you feel the effects of your actions in our <br/>\n&gt; home, at your home. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So the cause to ther 9/11 effect was all the acumulated <br/>\n&gt; actions the USA/Allied had done in the past concentrated in <br/>\n&gt; one opretaion. <br/>\n&gt; The effect after 9/11?<br/>\n&gt; USA bombed two countries back to the darkages, and what to <br/>\n&gt; continue with Iran. Is USA Evil for doing so? Oh no would <br/>\n&gt; most people say, they are only defending themself from evil. <br/>\n&gt; Yeah, but you have to considerd what the other side will say <br/>\n&gt; about this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They say that they were defending themself from the ultimate <br/>\n&gt; purest form of Evil. Gerorge W Bush Junior the apostel of <br/>\n&gt; satan. Sounds familliar?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, we are all friendly peacefull people, arent we?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I say everything is a matter of point of view. And in most <br/>\n&gt; cases, economics and religion are the major contributers to <br/>\n&gt; so called &quot;evil&quot; events. And in a few cases insanity with a <br/>\n&gt; little help from economics and religon can end up in <br/>\n&gt; disatorus events. Like the world wars, Togukawa regime and <br/>\n&gt; emperor Xiang of china. The guy who united al of china and <br/>\n&gt; built the great wall of china. He did kill a lott of people, <br/>\n&gt; was a cruel bastard, and probably slightly YoYo in the head. <br/>\n&gt; But he did unite china, and gave it a very stable future. <br/>\n&gt; Evil or not? Point of view. <br/>\n&gt; (BTW, I have _no_ idea how to spell Xiang&#39;s name, I&#39;m guessing this is<br/>\n&gt; correct)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other question we must ask ourself is this.<br/>\n&gt; Does the means justify the goal?<br/>\n&gt; or does the goal justify the means?<br/>\n&gt; Emperor Xiang probably thought that if he united the people <br/>\n&gt; of what was to be &quot;China&quot;, a period of peace and prosperity <br/>\n&gt; would come. And the country would flourish in the fields of <br/>\n&gt; science and economics. But it would all come at a high price. <br/>\n&gt; He aparently thought it was worth it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My point in all of this rambling is this.<br/>\n&gt; 1. Evil is a matter of point of view. <br/>\n&gt; 2. History is written by those who survive and comes out on <br/>\n&gt; top of things. 3. Does the goal justefy the means, and does <br/>\n&gt; the means justify the goal. 4. Evil is a word used to <br/>\n&gt; describe &quot;the others&quot; in a way to de humanise the opposit side.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And as such I do not belive in evil, deluted or pure, it does <br/>\n&gt; not matter for it is all a point o view. For it is all just <br/>\n&gt; the effect of a prior event. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /// Chris the agnostic realist<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;We are friendly peacfull people. we&#39;re not the ones out <br/>\n&gt; there causing troubble&quot; -The streets &quot;Irony of it all&quot; (as I <br/>\n&gt; was saying it is just a point of view -C)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Burker1@...\">Burker1@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Burker1@...\">Burker1@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: den 8 juni 2003 04:23<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 521<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not always just a matter of one&#39;s &quot;point of view&quot;.

Teh concept of Evil was<br/>\n  used as a method of control.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One could say that the British Empire was Evil, for using Opium to force<br/>\n  china into submission.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some People I know say that USA is evil for interfering with other<br/>\n  states internal buissness.<br/>\n  Like getting Noriega (he was a CIA operative, but defekted after he got<br/>\n  elected) elected president and then assainated. USA put Pinochet into<br/>\n  power, and as such made life a living hell for alot of people. <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are always a cause and an effect. This to is important to<br/>\n  remember.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Take the now famous 9/11 incident. <br/>\n  The most elaborate, complex and best executed guerilla opperaiton ever<br/>\n  peformed by terrorists. Now why on earth would some one want to kill off<br/>\n  five to seven thousand people in a building? <br/>\n  Basically to make a point. The terrorists didnt care about the people in<br/>\n  the buildings, that only came as a bounus. It was what those buildings<br/>\n  represented that matterd. It was an awfull act, and persoanly I was in<br/>\n  chock for three days. I have relatives in the states so naturally I was<br/>\n  concernd. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Was that an evil act? If you ask the americans, it was definatly the<br/>\n  ultimate and purest Evil. But it was nothing but a political statement<br/>\n  from a group of people who thinks that USA should butt out of their<br/>\n  internal buissness. <br/>\n  I mean come on! Do you really think that the midle east is a new<br/>\n  problem? Hell no!<br/>\n  It has been a hodgepodge of assorted violence and territorial aggression<br/>\n  for over 5000 years. And the only difference now from then is that they<br/>\n  have the capacity to wipe each other out totally.<br/>\n  They are pissed off at the americans/allied for getting involved in a<br/>\n  several thousand year old conflict, and were telling them, and any other<br/>\n  nation that might get the idea to get involved to &quot;stay the fuck away&quot;<br/>\n  (pardon my language). If you dont, we will make sure that you feel the<br/>\n  effects of your actions in our home, at your home. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So the cause to ther 9/11 effect was all the acumulated actions the<br/>\n  USA/Allied had done in the past concentrated in one opretaion. <br/>\n  The effect after 9/11?<br/>\n  USA bombed two countries back to the darkages, and what to continue with<br/>\n  Iran.<br/>\n  Is USA Evil for doing so? Oh no would most people say, they are only<br/>\n  defending themself from evil.<br/>\n  Yeah, but you have to considerd what the other side will say about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They say that they were defending themself from the ultimate purest form<br/>\n  of Evil. Gerorge W Bush Junior the apostel of satan. Sounds familliar?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, we are all friendly peacefull people, arent we?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I say everything is a matter of point of view. And in most cases,<br/>\n  economics and religion are the major contributers to so called &quot;evil&quot;<br/>\n  events. And in a few cases insanity with a little help from economics<br/>\n  and religon can end up in disatorus events. Like the world wars,<br/>\n  Togukawa regime and emperor Xiang of china. The guy who united al of<br/>\n  china and built the great wall of china. He did kill a lott of people,<br/>\n  was a cruel bastard, and probably slightly YoYo in the head.

Point of<br/>\n  view. <br/>\n  (BTW, I have _no_ idea how to spell Xiang&#39;s name, I&#39;m guessing this is<br/>\n  correct)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The other question we must ask ourself is this.<br/>\n  Does the means justify the goal?<br/>\n  or does the goal justify the means?<br/>\n  Emperor Xiang probably thought that if he united the people of what was<br/>\n  to be &quot;China&quot;, a period of peace and prosperity would come. And the<br/>\n  country would flourish in the fields of science and economics. But it<br/>\n  would all come at a high price. He aparently thought it was worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My point in all of this rambling is this.<br/>\n  1. Evil is a matter of point of view. <br/>\n  2.
