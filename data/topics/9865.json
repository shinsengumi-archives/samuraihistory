Can you imagine, what if someone else was taking a dump, the plot would have been discovered and Nobunaga would not have the empire. Or you can just use your own imagination as to how he died. It could have been from stomach cancer or maybe he drank himself into a stupor in the loo and died from alcoholic poisoning. And furthermore, ask this question, how the heck would the ninja known what Kenshin&#39;s backside looked like?
