At the end of the Edo <br/>\nperiod a custom sword by Kurihara Nobuhide cost 38 Ryo 3bu, Ishido <br/>\nKorekazu 31 Ryo and Koyama Munetsugu 27 Ryo. Thats 310 man-en, 248 <br/>\nman-en and 216 man-en respectively in todays money. Considerable sums <br/>\nyes, but less than you&#39;d pay for their works today and about what you&#39;d <br/>\npay for work by someone like Yoshihara Yoshindo currently.<br/>\n\tI am not so sure I made my case but if you extrapolate a bit, I think <br/>\nyou can argue that the everyday Edo Samurai wasn&#39;t investing in works <br/>\nby the most popular smiths of his day, but was likely getting the best <br/>\nthe smith in his Han offered and that he could afford so 10 to 20 Ryo <br/>\nor about a years salary...<br/>\nIMHO,<br/>\n-t</div>",
