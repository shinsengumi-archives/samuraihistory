            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1272087690\">RPG related question for an Alt-History campaign set on the eve of <br/>\nthe Onin War... I&#39;ll have more questions if this proves useful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read that a wide variety of noted worthies were all exiled to <br/>\nSado Island, apparently to work in mines or something. I also note <br/>\nthat it was considered a one way trip. How does that work, exactly?  <br/>\nI see that it was ruled by the Homma clan for the relevant period. <br/>\nDid they act as jailers for the court and Shogunate? Did only people <br/>\nthat it was impolitic to execute get sent there? <br/>\n<br/>\nI have the following hypothetical examples in my mind&#39;s eye:<br/>\n<br/>\n#1 &quot;Prince Okisugi no Guchi offends the Emperor one too many times <br/>\nwith his scandalous gossip, and he is ordered to relocate to Sado <br/>\nIsland. His estates forfeit, the prince is escorted by a retinue of <br/>\nImperial guardsmen across Japan, taking only what his four or five <br/>\nservants will carry. After many weeks of travel, during which he is <br/>\ngiven opportunities to end his own life with dignity, he is loaded <br/>\nonto a boat and transferred to Homma custody, where he is received as <br/>\nan honored guest... meaning he lives out his days in a decrepit <br/>\nseaside house with one loyal servant, writing his memoirs. He does <br/>\nnot escape, because if he does, he will be executed, or something bad <br/>\nmight happen to his relatives in Kyoto, or his considerable remaining <br/>\ndignity will be squandered. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n#2 &quot;Priest Yominikui offends the Shogun one too many times with his <br/>\natrocious poetry. It is considered bad form to kill a priest who is <br/>\ndistantly related to Lord Yamana Sozen, so he is instead slapped in <br/>\nchains, carted to the boat, and shipped to Sado Island. There he is <br/>\nfar too busy digging in the Homma silver mines to write poems. Priest <br/>\nYominikui eventually expires under the strain of his new labors.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be plausible for PC&#39;s to be sent to Sado by a powerful <br/>\npatron to retrieve some old noble, because he was needed for the <br/>\nbrewing Onin intrigues? Or perhaps simply for a PC to carry a private <br/>\nletter from one powerful person to an exiled Imperial relative, <br/>\nseeking support for some power play?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nAndrew</div>",
