Unless, of course, peace is defined as the absence of opposition, by which any warlord and any warmonger may be shielded by the flag of peace. I can´t recall to whom it is ascribed, but a very interesting quotation sums it up: &quot;diplomacy is the art of saying ´nice doggie, nice doggie´ until one finds a stick big enough&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe one of the most important conclusions we can harness from the Nobunaga-Akechi incident concerns the value of loyalty. It doesn´t matter how powerful and accomplished an enitity is, for the lack of loyal retainers may cause the collapse of any structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to agree with Edy pertaining to the outcome of the Sengoku Jidai. Both Hideiyoshi´s and Tokugawa´s achievements laid heavily on the road paved by Nobunaga.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it is important to note that the Tokugawa clan was not above employing social control measures in order to maintain power. The class restrictions and the creation of a &quot;political police&quot; (like the shinsengummi) are examples of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nThiago<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.: Octavio, would you attend classes at the Niten Institute?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA presente mensagem contém informações e/ou anexos confidenciais, protegidos pelas leis de sigilo de correspondência e profissional.

Then the little samurai told Musashi this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Bushido&#39;s way is to not be afraid of Death, in fact is to live in death&quot;,<br/>\n  then suddendly he killed himself in front of Musashi just to prove him that<br/>\n  he is better than Musashi.<br/>\n<br/>\n  With tears on his face, Musashi said that this is correct, but NOT NECESSARY<br/>\n  in this WAY!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  (this was supposed to be a joke in such a dark humour typical of such comics<br/>\n  serie and of course, was not published in english)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, I&#39;ve heard about Musashi much time before all this NIPON-Modism, and<br/>\n  it was around the 80&#39;s as well!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sincerelly<br/>\n<br/>\n  Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho<br/>\n  São Paulo - SP Brazil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message: 1<br/>\n     Date: Mon, 5 Apr 2004 11:29:47 +0300<br/>\n     From: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:edy@...\">edy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Subject: Re: Digest Number 768<br/>\n<br/>\n  No,Tokugawa and Hideyoshi would never have ended like they did.If Nobunaga<br/>\n  didn&#39;t take all that territory,Hideyoshi would have never been to<br/>\n  Korea.....and perhaps the Tokugawa dinasty would&#39;t have existed....<br/>\n<br/>\n  Edy<br/>\n    ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n    From: Thiago Buschinelli Sorrentino<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n    Sent: Monday, April 05, 2004 12:27 AM<br/>\n    Subject: RES: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 768<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyways, would Hideiyoshi and Tokugawa have gotten that far without<br/>\n    Nobunaga´s incursions?

Oda Nobunaga undertook no such actions. He eradicated threats, admittedly ruthlessly and with little consideration for the status of those he deemed to be threats. Of course women and children were casualties, which is never right, but simply the way it was, and still is. <br/>\nHe held little regard for Buddhism, shown by his allegedly debaucherous formative years and lack of respect shown at his father&#39;s funeral, but he was no Christian hoping to destroy Buddhism, but only to destroy those who stood in his way. This may have lead to large loss of life but this wasn&#39;t genocide, and it struck terror into his opponents but was not what we now call terrorism. <br/>\nThe meas suited the objective, an objective that is hard to sum up in much of the language we are so used to today.<br/>\nM.Lorimer <br/>\n<br/>\nCesare Polenghi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cepo@...\">cepo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 6, 2004, at 6:29 PM, Meðal Mikit Stór-ljon Oddhinsson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Are you kidding, Mr Alexander?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The one who did a real admirable work on this subject was Takeda <br/>\n&gt; Shingen!<br/>\n&gt;  One of the most admirable persons in the Japan History!

Tokugawa did the<br/>\nunifying of Japan because his incursions had peace as a goal, unlike the<br/>\nchristian Nobunaga, that only spread terrorism and genocide.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I admire him as well Musashi. Of course I am speaking about<br/>\nTakeda...<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, that statements (babbling in japanese) about Musashi being not fammous<br/>\nto real japan dwellers is ridiculous. Sorry if I offend anyone, but I have<br/>\nsome basis to call the attention of all.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, his book Go Rin No Shou is obrigatory reading to several japan<br/>\nexecutive staff people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, There was a Japanese TV Series Drama about Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s<br/>\nbiography and it was very popular in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, there was TONS of manga and gekiga that was in homnage of Musashi,<br/>\nmentioned him somewhere or used a version of him like an popular comic manga<br/>\nof the 80s that had a kind of Musashi-Kid as its principal character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a joke very well inside such manga...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a duel between musashi-kid and another little samurai about who<br/>\nwould be a better samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusashi glared to him and he glared to Musashi, and no one lost this face<br/>\ndown. Then the little samurai told Musashi this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Bushido&#39;s way is to not be afraid of Death, in fact is to live in death&quot;,<br/>\nthen suddendly he killed himself in front of Musashi just to prove him that<br/>\nhe is better than Musashi.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith tears on his face, Musashi said that this is correct, but NOT NECESSARY<br/>\nin this WAY!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n(this was supposed to be a joke in such a dark humour typical of such comics<br/>\nserie and of course, was not published in english)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ve heard about Musashi much time before all this NIPON-Modism, and<br/>\nit was around the 80&#39;s as well!<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerelly<br/>\n<br/>\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho<br/>\nSão Paulo - SP Brazil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 1<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 5 Apr 2004 11:29:47 +0300<br/>\n   From: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:edy@...\">edy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Digest Number 768<br/>\n<br/>\nNo,Tokugawa and Hideyoshi would never have ended like they did.If Nobunaga<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take all that territory,Hideyoshi would have never been to<br/>\nKorea.....and perhaps the Tokugawa dinasty would&#39;t have existed....<br/>\n<br/>\nEdy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Thiago Buschinelli Sorrentino<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 05, 2004 12:27 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RES: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 768<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyways, would Hideiyoshi and Tokugawa have gotten that far without<br/>\n  Nobunaga´s incursions?

In terms of the question itself,<br/>\n  surely<br/>\n    a leader (anywhere) could be both dictator and unifier, they are not<br/>\n    mutually exclusive terms.<br/>\n    &gt; Sprouting from the term &#39;unifier&#39; though I have a question? When was<br/>\n  Japan<br/>\n    unified? Considering, Hokkaiko was really only geographically part of<br/>\n  Japan<br/>\n    until the 18th and 19th Centuries, despite incursions and expeditions<br/>\ninto<br/>\n    the north dating back to the Asuka-jidai, and before; while the Nansei<br/>\n  (SW)<br/>\n    Islands (Okinawa, etc) were not part of Japan until the first decades of<br/>\n  the<br/>\n    Edo-jidai.<br/>\n    &gt;<br/>\n    &gt; M.Lorimer<br/>\n    &gt;<br/>\n    &gt; &quot;Anthony J.
