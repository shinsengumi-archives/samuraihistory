Nobuhide kidnapped (or intercepted, if you like) Takechiyo <br/>\n(Tokugawa Ieyasu) and demanded that Tokugawa Hirotada give up Okazaki <br/>\nin return for his son&#39;s life.  Of course he refused, but Nobuhiro <br/>\ndecided not to kill Ieyasu anyway. In the book (which is of course <br/>\nfiction) the implication is that Nobuhide was ready and willing to <br/>\nkill Ieyasu, but Nobunaga was the one that stopped his father from <br/>\nkilling the boy - although it doesn&#39;t say it straight out, the story <br/>\nimplies that he was fond of the kid and was hoping his father would <br/>\nadopt him into the Oda clan.<br/>\nMy question is, is there any basis in fact for this, or are <br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s actions in the book artistic license on the part of the <br/>\nauthor?</div>",
