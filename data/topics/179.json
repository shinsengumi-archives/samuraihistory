In a classic<br/>\ncase of gekokujo they took the shiba land and made it<br/>\ntheir own.  Within the mess of paper work and fighting<br/>\nthey did claim a descent from the taira.  Whether this<br/>\nis true is up for debate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to point out that although I knew the<br/>\nMinamoto were not destroyed because they were the<br/>\nvictors.  I did find out after my last response that<br/>\nsome small factions of the taira did survive.  An<br/>\nexample of this is the hojo.  This correction was give<br/>\nto me by Mr. Bryant(thanks alot).  I also wanted to<br/>\npoint ot that the ieyasu&#39;s family claimed descent from<br/>\nthe minamoto long bfore he had enough power to<br/>\nthreaten the emperor.  However, whether he threatened<br/>\nhim to back up the families past claims is unknown to<br/>\nme.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course their are many stories in japanese history<br/>\nthat are made up as well as family&#39;s with no real<br/>\naristocratic past that took names of famous families<br/>\nto add prestige to their rule.  But history that has<br/>\nno material backing can only be debated an questioned.<br/>\n Thats why I write this response.

What I CAN tell you is<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; following:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) The Minamoto and Taira were NOT destroyed after<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Genji-Heike wars.

During the first years of the Tokugawa Bakufu there was a struggle<br/>\nbetween Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son Hidetada and Toyotomi Hideyori over<br/>\nsecuring different ranks from the court. This seems to imply that the title<br/>\nof Shogun was not as important as it would later become. After all Ieyasu<br/>\nhad the title only for two years before handing it over to Hidetada to the<br/>\nchagrin of Hideyori and Yodogimi.<br/>\nWhy Nobunaga and Hideyoshi didn&#39;t become shogun; there have been several<br/>\nreasons given.

The obvious answer is<br/>\n&gt; that Hideyoshi did not come from the Genji lineage that would have<br/>\n&gt; allowed him to hold the title...But I also read that Ieyasu&#39;s own<br/>\n&gt; lineage was never too clear cut in a line from the Minamoto. (a<br/>\n&gt; suspect link to a clan called &#39;Nitta&#39; was his claim to power)<br/>\n&gt;  In Berry&#39;s book the idea is presented that Hideyoshi was not<br/>\n&gt; concerned with the position of Shogun because that of Kampaku would<br/>\n&gt; permit him the power but without the trouble of upsetting the<br/>\n&gt; delicate balance that he had achieved with the Daimyo.<br/>\n&gt;  If Ieyasu could &#39;alter&#39; his lineage what other reasons can you all<br/>\n&gt; suggest for why Hideyoshi decided not to follow the same route?<br/>\n&gt;  Something to think over for a while maybe...<br/>\n&gt;  (Off topic please try to check out the pictures that I&#39;ve drawn of<br/>\n&gt; Samurai in a series at; www.dickyjjamison.homestead.com/artwork.html<br/>\n&gt; and please tell me what you think...Shameless plug I know but oh<br/>\n&gt; well...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\">http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-129820851\">Hello again all,<br/>\n I have been reading Elizabeth Berry&#39;s excellant book &#39;Hideyoshi&#39;<br/>\nalong with a biography of Tokugawa Ieyasu and I got to thinking about <br/>\nthe possible reasons why Hideyoshi decided to take the title <br/>\nof &#39;Kampaku&#39; (Regent) over &#39;SeiiTai Shogun&#39;. The obvious answer is <br/>\nthat Hideyoshi did not come from the Genji lineage that would have <br/>\nallowed him to hold the title...But I also read that Ieyasu&#39;s own <br/>\nlineage was never too clear cut in a line from the Minamoto. (a <br/>\nsuspect link to a clan called &#39;Nitta&#39; was his claim to power)<br/>\n In Berry&#39;s book the idea is presented that Hideyoshi was not <br/>\nconcerned with the position of Shogun because that of Kampaku would <br/>\npermit him the power but without the trouble of upsetting the <br/>\ndelicate balance that he had achieved with the Daimyo. <br/>\n If Ieyasu could &#39;alter&#39; his lineage what other reasons can you all <br/>\nsuggest for why Hideyoshi decided not to follow the same route?<br/>\n Something to think over for a while maybe...<br/>\n (Off topic please try to check out the pictures that I&#39;ve drawn of <br/>\nSamurai in a series at; www.dickyjjamison.homestead.com/artwork.html<br/>\nand please tell me what you think...Shameless plug I know but oh <br/>\nwell...)</div>",
