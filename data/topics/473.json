It sparked a new area<br/>\nof interest for me and thus I&#39;d appreciate any info in<br/>\nregards to where I can acquire quality material on the<br/>\nhistory of Japanese castles, since trawling a number<br/>\nof large bookstores in Tokyo and Osaka presented with<br/>\nnothing (in English).<br/>\nAll info appreciated<br/>\nMichael Lorimer <br/>\n-- <br/>\nrob broom</div>",
