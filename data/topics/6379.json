Still not sure if I can write in a sensible <br/>\nmanner, but I&#39;ll try.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I recall correctly, you had early on in your writing alluded to &#39;the <br/>\nartist&#39;s eye&#39;, and to perceptions that others might miss.   Some people seem <br/>\nto have an ability to perceive that is so sensitive as to appear <br/>\n&#39;supernatural&#39;, or &#39;mystic&#39;.  Artists, particularly those of Eastern arts, <br/>\nincluding martial,  are taught (or advised) to learn to put aside their own <br/>\nego and absorb their environment, especially in the beginning, of their <br/>\ntraining.  Later on they have learned, or should have learned, to <br/>\nincorporate their ego into their perceptions &#39;properly&#39;, and &#39;become one&#39; <br/>\nwith the world around them.  Clumsily and said in clichï¿½ form, forgive me, <br/>\nbut that means to me that the person has become the same ego inside and out, <br/>\nand is in a state of &#39;constant harmony&#39; with their environment....   a place <br/>\nin their existence where perception of and response to their environment is <br/>\nso well ingrained that the individual appears to have some kind of &#39;power&#39;.  <br/>\n  It&#39;s not power; it is &#39;mushin&#39;.....   at rest,  this concept is <br/>\n&#39;zanshin&#39;.............   but this you know already.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a person who has knit, crocheted, embroidered, and sewn since she was 7 <br/>\nyears old,  the catalog of impressions my brain has stored about fabrics, <br/>\nyarns, and threads is more than I can consciously recall. We in the <br/>\nknitter&#39;s realm have a concept of yarn &#39;telling us what it wants to be&#39;  <br/>\nsuch that we say the yarn &#39;speaks to us&#39;.  Other knitters I know scoff at us <br/>\nabout &#39;mysticism&#39;, and proceed to knit with yarn obviously unsuited to their <br/>\nproject and they are wailing and complaining about a &#39;troublesome project&#39;.  <br/>\nThey wonder at how others of us can &#39;make it look so easy&#39;.  I try to <br/>\ndescribe the way I personally &#39;hear&#39; my yarn or fabric is not in words per <br/>\nse, but in a mind-full picture conjured by that store of impressions already <br/>\nthere.  If the needle size is wrong for the yarn, it will appear to &#39;fight&#39; <br/>\nbeing knit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother person who paints, draws, or writes is tuned to a different store of <br/>\ninformation, as are swordsmiths and all other artisans.   Persons who <br/>\ndevelop several avenues of pursuit get better at amalgamating information <br/>\nand perceptions of those arts into a cohesiveness, a &#39;way&#39; of responding to <br/>\ntheir environment that to others can seem a bit unreal, but it is not.  It <br/>\nis simply being and staying aware and responsive to the cues given by one&#39;s <br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealth care providers, particularly nurses, also undergo a barrage of <br/>\nsensory input that is beyond conscious recall, but some of them can take in <br/>\nthe appearance of a patient, and the summation of impressions that &#39;come up <br/>\non screen&#39; &#39;tells&#39; them that something is not going well.  It&#39;s that &#39;gut&#39; <br/>\nfeeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoldiers also develop that catalog, unfortunately, with experience in <br/>\nbattle; Nathan can undoubtedly expound on this subject  much better than I.  <br/>\nSome groundwork is certainly laid with intensive training.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do my previous words have to do with swords that  seem to &#39;speak&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it has more to do with the person who is handling the sword, than it <br/>\ndoes with the sword itself.  I think it is that awareness, that catalog of <br/>\nphysical and visual impressions gathered over time, and the ability to allow <br/>\none&#39;s mind to create a meaningful picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I have a lot more to say,  also about the way a samurai may have <br/>\nperceived his blade,  but it mostly enters into the realm of psychology, so <br/>\nI won&#39;t go there unless there is interest in further discussion.  This is, <br/>\nafter all, a history list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to work with me....<br/>\n<br/>\nLizzie </span></blockquote></div>",
