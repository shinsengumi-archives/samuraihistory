When you&#39;ve been reading<br/>\nthis stuff for 24 years or so, it&#39;s easy to forget<br/>\nwhere each particular fact comes from. With all the<br/>\nJapanese TV/movies/books I&#39;ve watched/read over the<br/>\npast 11 years, a lot of things just become general<br/>\nimpressions. People like Nina are kind enough to<br/>\nremind me that because it&#39;s in my head, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nserve as a source :), so I try to pull up<br/>\npictures/sources when possible.

Do you think this had something to do with the interventions of the west? In a span of lest than 50 of this new Japanese regiment they where defeating countries like Russia and invading China. However, I do want my next statement to do more than to relate; if there is a samurai nature or samurai spirit could or shouldn&#39;t it still be today. Like many newcomers espescially think when they spend a course of time in Japan learning culture and such (and they get the idea that they too are samurai: I myself included) that this spirit still lives on. I lived there for 3 years and did not know that the profession was no longer. But maybe the spirit is still very real. OH Oh I got it why dont we just make a new one? New aged samurai.

What the black ships did more than anything else was reveal how<br/>\nweak the shogunate actually was, which came as a real shock to many. The<br/>\nenemies of the shogunate and the Imperial court were quick to seize on<br/>\nthis discovery and kick-start what was likely inevitable anyway, black<br/>\nships or no black ships - the bakumatsu, or &#39;last days of the<br/>\nshogunate&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tozama clans, such as the Shimazu of Satsuma for example, had held a<br/>\ngrudge of sorts ever since the formation of the shogunate due to their<br/>\nexclusion from national politics & the many other predjudices shown to<br/>\nthem due to their tozama status despite being one of the oldest and most<br/>\npowerful of all the clans.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shogunate became a very corrupt body, and as soon as it began to<br/>\nlose it&#39;s true military nature (after the first three shoguns) it began<br/>\nto lose it&#39;s effectiveness and really struggled to deal with the rapidly<br/>\nchanging conditions in Japan during the 18th and 19th centuries. The<br/>\nstructure of the shogunate - a ruling body loosely overseeing largely<br/>\nautonomous states who each have their own military power - was long<br/>\noutdated by the mid-19th century, especially when compared with the<br/>\nEngland&#92;Russia&#92;France&#39;s of the world. If the shogunate had not fallen<br/>\nwhen it did it could have been disastrous for Japan, because the lack of<br/>\na national military and true national government would have invited<br/>\ntrouble had the other world powers, Russia perhaps most especially,<br/>\nattacked.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nAngusH<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.

What the black ships did more than anything else was reveal how<br/>\nweak the shogunate actually was, which came as a real shock to many. The<br/>\nenemies of the shogunate and the Imperial court were quick to seize on<br/>\nthis discovery and kick-start what was likely inevitable anyway, black<br/>\nships or no black ships - the bakumatsu, or &#39;last days of the<br/>\nshogunate&#39;.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe tozama clans, such as the Shimazu of Satsuma for example, had held a<br/>\ngrudge of sorts ever since the formation of the shogunate due to their<br/>\nexclusion from national politics & the many other predjudices shown to<br/>\nthem due to their tozama status despite being one of the oldest and most<br/>\npowerful of all the clans.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe shogunate became a very corrupt body, and as soon as it began to<br/>\nlose it&#39;s true military nature (after the first three shoguns) it began<br/>\nto lose it&#39;s effectiveness and really struggled to deal with the rapidly<br/>\nchanging conditions in Japan during the 18th and 19th centuries. The<br/>\nstructure of the shogunate - a ruling body loosely overseeing largely<br/>\nautonomous states who each have their own military power - was long<br/>\noutdated by the mid-19th century, especially when compared with the<br/>\nEngland&#92;Russia&#92;France&#39;s of the world. If the shogunate had not fallen<br/>\nwhen it did it could have been disastrous for Japan, because the lack of<br/>\na national military and true national government would have invited<br/>\ntrouble had the other world powers, Russia perhaps most especially,<br/>\nattacked.<br/>\n <br/>\n---<br/>\nAngusH<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.

As a moderator, it&#39;s sometimes<br/>\nfrustrating when people come on here and ask<br/>\nopen-ended, general questions without doing any<br/>\nresearch, like &quot;Can someone tell me everything about<br/>\nthe Samurai???????&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously yours is not a case like this--have no fear,<br/>\nthere will be no smiting. It&#39;s much more<br/>\nunderstandable that you can&#39;t find many sources if<br/>\nyou&#39;re looking for a specific fire (1861). When people<br/>\nask general questions (Tell me about fires in Edo!)<br/>\nand say they can&#39;t find anything, I tend to do a quick<br/>\ngoogle search to see what comes up. In this case, I<br/>\nfound quite a bit about fires in Edo, most referencing<br/>\nthe 1657 fire. Your mention of a timeline, as opposed<br/>\nto a specific time, indicated to me you didn&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat year you were looking for. Since I found several<br/>\npages of hits in less than 2 minutes, it made me doubt<br/>\nhow hard you actually looked. Looking for specific<br/>\ninformation about the fire in 1861, I can see how the<br/>\npages that came up (most of the Wiki variety) didn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp at all, and you&#39;d turn here for more specifics. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the regulars (and you&#39;ve been here a while, so<br/>\nyou probably are familiar with the problem) will tell<br/>\nyou that we often get people here who have spent a<br/>\ntotal of 30 seconds online, haven&#39;t found the answer<br/>\nto whatever question they have, and ask here when if<br/>\nthey&#39;d invested 5 minutes with a decent search engine,<br/>\nthey could find it. Again, I&#39;m glad we are not dealing<br/>\nwith that--I&#39;ll poke around some more and see what I<br/>\ncan find for you, though.

As a moderator, it&#39;s sometimes<br/>\nfrustrating when people come on here and ask<br/>\nopen-ended, general questions without doing any<br/>\nresearch, like &quot;Can someone tell me everything about<br/>\nthe Samurai???????&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously yours is not a case like this--have no fear,<br/>\nthere will be no smiting. It&#39;s much more<br/>\nunderstandable that you can&#39;t find many sources if<br/>\nyou&#39;re looking for a specific fire (1861). When people<br/>\nask general questions (Tell me about fires in Edo!)<br/>\nand say they can&#39;t find anything, I tend to do a quick<br/>\ngoogle search to see what comes up. In this case, I<br/>\nfound quite a bit about fires in Edo, most referencing<br/>\nthe 1657 fire. Your mention of a timeline, as opposed<br/>\nto a specific time, indicated to me you didn&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat year you were looking for. Since I found several<br/>\npages of hits in less than 2 minutes, it made me doubt<br/>\nhow hard you actually looked. Looking for specific<br/>\ninformation about the fire in 1861, I can see how the<br/>\npages that came up (most of the Wiki variety) didn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp at all, and you&#39;d turn here for more specifics. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the regulars (and you&#39;ve been here a while, so<br/>\nyou probably are familiar with the problem) will tell<br/>\nyou that we often get people here who have spent a<br/>\ntotal of 30 seconds online, haven&#39;t found the answer<br/>\nto whatever question they have, and ask here when if<br/>\nthey&#39;d invested 5 minutes with a decent search engine,<br/>\nthey could find it. Again, I&#39;m glad we are not dealing<br/>\nwith that--I&#39;ll poke around some more and see what I<br/>\ncan find for you, though. Will Japanese<br/>\nsources/webpages work for you? <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grfkboyz@...\">grfkboyz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Nate:<br/>\n&gt;   I feel bad that my question annoyed you or anyone<br/>\n&gt; else.
