This group is pretty big on &quot;no bushido before<br/>\nmusashi&quot; and I think<br/>\n(from the reviews I&#39;ve read) King assumes bushido was always a part of the<br/>\nSamurai lifestyle.<br/>\n------------------<br/>\nOCT: Nope, I didn&#39;t read the book, but I think this statement is aceptable.<br/>\nAccording to what I&#39;ve studied, there was before Musashi, a type of non<br/>\nwritten Samurai&#39;s Morality System.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read much on the use of Zen in the Samurai class. Zen seems to be<br/>\nstrangely<br/>\ncompatible in an opposites attract sort of way with Bushido, but what about<br/>\nbefore Bushido<br/>\nwas really around? Which, did Zen give birth to Bushido in some way? And<br/>\nwhat role did Zen<br/>\nreally play in the samurai&#39;s life? I just don&#39;t see the connection or<br/>\ncompatibility between the<br/>\nupper warrior class and Zen Buddhism. The principles and lifestyle just<br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to mesh.<br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\nOCT: Don&#39;t know if it will help ya get the answer, but those symbols at the<br/>\nKessa (Sanskrit: Kassaya) of Soto Zen Shu is actually Crest of Arms of two<br/>\nSamurai Families that I don&#39;t recall their names. However I believe any<br/>\nZenji Bishop (Sozu) can answer this to ya.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, In defense of Mr. Lee,<br/>\n--------------<br/>\nOCT: In defense? If I understand well, ye pointed a third way of thinking,<br/>\nthat I should agree in some points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he may have been getting at was the difference between Mahayana and<br/>\nTheravada<br/>\nBuddhism. Mahayana is the more popular, less rigorous, and more syncretistic<br/>\nvariety found<br/>\nthroughout SE Asia, whereas Theravada is the more &quot;pure&quot; version of<br/>\nBuddhism, which had a<br/>\nstronger hold in Japan (Zen Buddhism being a subcategory of Theravada). Zen,<br/>\nas a<br/>\nsubcategory of Theravada, adds to the mix the idea of &quot;immediate&quot;<br/>\nenlightenment rather than<br/>\ngradual enlightenment, through the use of meditation to bring about<br/>\nenlightening moments, or<br/>\nepiphanies.<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\nOCT: I think ye are not 100% accurate. Dhyana is not a theravada school,<br/>\nhowever there is comments between the Dhyana (Zen, Chaan) school and<br/>\nTheravadins that Dhyana is the most Theravada of the Mahayana Schools, and<br/>\nya must know that Vajrayana is a subdivision of the Mahayana as well, since<br/>\nit both includes Mahayana Sutras and Treatises, the Classical (theravada)<br/>\nCanon that is the Tripitaka (Three Vases) and their own vajrayana treatises,<br/>\nsutras, shastras and saddhanas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut where Lee says that Korean, Japanese, and Chinese Buddhism should all be<br/>\nin one<br/>\ncategory, he&#39;s right as far as them all being Theravada, but he&#39;s wrong in<br/>\nthat Japanese<br/>\nBuddhism is pretty different from Chinese, at least in that Chinese Buddhism<br/>\nis more<br/>\nsyncretistic. Japanese Buddhism is generally regarded as being the version<br/>\nclosest to the<br/>\noriginal Buddhism.<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\nOCT: It depends to what school you refer. The Hokkekyo is totally Japanese<br/>\nand much of its contends have a great range of diferences between it and<br/>\nOriginal Buddhism in itself. Hokekkyo and Pure Land Teachings was the most<br/>\npopular between the peasants and would be that what Mr. Lee called Japan&#39;s<br/>\nFolk-Buddhism, However Zen Shu (all both two schools of Japan - Soto and<br/>\nHinzai if not mispelled the last one) and Vajrayana Schools (Shingon-Shu and<br/>\nTendai-Shu) was the popular ones between the dominant class like the<br/>\nSamurais and those of the Imperial Court.<br/>\n***<br/>\nAll of couse, worshipped Shinto Gods (specially the Imperial Family, Te<br/>\nhee).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLee wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The Japanese Buddism results from intellectual<br/>\n&gt; interaction among Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism<br/>\n&gt; itself throughout centuries, the first two of which<br/>\n&gt; did not really have much effect on India, South Asia,<br/>\n&gt; and Tibet.<br/>\n&gt; Through this interaction, primitive Taoism and<br/>\n&gt; Confucianism was reborn as more subtle and complex<br/>\n&gt; philosophy with rigorous logical structures in 5 and<br/>\n&gt; 12 centuries respectivly<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t say that Japanese Buddhism &quot;results from&quot; that interaction, but<br/>\nrather that the<br/>\npresence of Taoism and Confucianism allowed for Buddhism to be accepted with<br/>\ngreater ease.<br/>\nTaoism and Confucianism are primarily atheistic, as is Theravada Buddhism.<br/>\nBoth promote a<br/>\ngeneral morality, as does Buddhism. And Taoism, with its quizzical proverbs<br/>\nand mysterious<br/>\nstatements, parallels (a little bit) the practices of Zen teachers quizzing<br/>\ntheir students (strange<br/>\nstatements that don&#39;t really mean anything but might help you understand<br/>\nsomething else).<br/>\n-------------<br/>\nOCT: Your thoughs have logic, but sorry. According to what I remember,<br/>\nBuddhism does not entered due to the acceptance of Taoism and Confucianism<br/>\nin Japan. But in an independent way. I unfortunatelly does not have anymore<br/>\nthe book of japanese history that taunt this to me, so I can&#39;t give ya the<br/>\naccurate date and century, but a certain japanese emperor married a chinese<br/>\nnoble lady, and when she comes to Japan, she brough an image of Amithaba<br/>\nBuddha, and some sutras. The image was destroyed by shinto peasants, who was<br/>\nafraid that &quot;this new religion would be forced down by the emperor&#39;s wife<br/>\nand force them to forget their holy Gods&quot; but in the end, buddhism never<br/>\nentered in conflict with the native religion, but instead, it helped in the<br/>\npreservation of shinto, since Japan was illiterate at that time, and all<br/>\nShinto Rites, myths and history was based on Oral Tradition. With the advent<br/>\nof buddhism, and latter, the Kukai (Shingon-shu founder) interference, there<br/>\ncomes the hiragana and katakana, and the common folk was also learn how to<br/>\nwrite and read. So, there comes from it, a form of shinto written liturgy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Buddhism can easily be looked at as &quot;The Way&quot;. But &quot;parallels&quot; is a<br/>\ndifferent thing than<br/>\n&quot;results from.&quot; I think history would show that Japanese Buddhism - rather<br/>\nthan being an<br/>\nexample of syncretism - is actually the closest to the original Buddhism of<br/>\nIndia. Mahayana<br/>\nBuddhism is sometimes VERY syncretistic, and has little to do with what<br/>\nSiddartha Gautama<br/>\nactually taught, and again, the Buddhism of Japan is different from that of<br/>\nChina, even though<br/>\nthey&#39;re both technically Theravada.<br/>\n------------------<br/>\nOCT: Don&#39;t forget that even Shingon-shu and Tendai-shu comes from China,<br/>\nalthough the tantric buddhism that was transmited to Kukai, was extinct.<br/>\nPerhaps buddhism comes intact to China, and there remained so, until a very<br/>\nlatter influence that changed their ways. The reason why I disagree with<br/>\nyour statement about they be both theravada, I already explained. Also<br/>\nremember that the most important Sutra of Zen Shu is Hannya Shingyo - Heart<br/>\nSutra (Prajña Pâramita Hrdaya Sutra)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who don&#39;t know the history: Buddhism started in India as kind of a<br/>\nreactionary<br/>\nspinoff of Hinduism. It grew in popularity and Buddhist missionaries were<br/>\nsent out to Asia. As<br/>\nTheravada Buddhism spread in Asia (and through China, into Japan) there was<br/>\na resurgence of<br/>\nHinduism in India, and the Hindus killed or drove out all the Buddhists. In<br/>\nJapan, the Buddhism<br/>\nstayed more or less in its pure form, but in the rest of Asia, it developed<br/>\ninto a less rigorous<br/>\nversion (Mahayana) and mixed with the traditional religions. Though China is<br/>\ntechnically<br/>\ntheravada, it&#39;s still syncretistic, so more like the rest of asia than<br/>\nJapan.<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\nOCT: The ressurgence of hinduism in India was totally pacific. Although it<br/>\nwas an threat to Buddhism in India, it was non violent and buddhism was<br/>\ndestroyed there through extreme syncretism, with hinduism assimilating some<br/>\nof the buddhist vallues and Siddharta Gautama (Shakyamuni Buddha) as one of<br/>\nthose avatars that are manifestations of Vishnu. The real violent threat to<br/>\nbuddhism in India was two centuries latter, with the muslim invasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sincretism in the Japanese case, is called as Shinbutsu Shugo, and is<br/>\nfully studied at Sophia University at Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, buddhism, taoism and confucionism (as well, poetry, caligraphy,<br/>\netc) was subject of study in universities at Edo Jidai, and all of them<br/>\ncould be possible, be the seeds to form the non written Samurai morality,<br/>\neven before Musashi, since those who went to those universities was the<br/>\nnoble aristocratic classes and those samurais.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember that when I was following Shugendo or Vajrayana, my former<br/>\nmasters would be very angry if I would be doing any kind of Salada, so just<br/>\nremembering their angry faces was enough to be horrorified with what  Mr.<br/>\nLee stated. And it had nothing to do with intolerance. One of them have an<br/>\nchristian son, but he always explained to his son that one way is one way<br/>\nand another way is another way. One cannot follow two at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\n<br/>\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho<br/>\nSão Paulo - SP Brazil</div>",

But, as for your response, I do<br/>\nnot know where to start to touch if I am a surgeon to<br/>\noperate on the patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make things clearer, the framework I placed in the<br/>\ndistinction and the interaction among Taoism,<br/>\nConfucianism, and Buddihism has been quite<br/>\nconventional and been well known facts among scholars<br/>\nin the continent. <br/>\nIt is just not known to the Western scholars because<br/>\nmost of sources were written for people who are<br/>\nfamiliar with the Chinese literature. Let&#39;s consider<br/>\nyour case:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Where is your sources?<br/>\n&gt; Had ye at LEAST studyed anything about japanese<br/>\n&gt; buddhism?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is the meaning of the &#39;Japanese&#39; Buddhism? Can we<br/>\ntalk about the Japanese Buddhism without linking to<br/>\nChina or India? <br/>\nYes, we can, but depending on the specificis of<br/>\nanalysis on the given topics, we leave out China or<br/>\nIndia. So, given the scopes of studies, we can<br/>\nformulate the wide, intermediate, and the short ranged<br/>\nanalytical scopes. <br/>\nIf we say that the studies of the Japanese Buddhism<br/>\nincluding India and China are the wide-ranged studies,<br/>\nwe may say that studies leaving out India, but<br/>\nincluding China are the intermediate ranged studies. <br/>\nMy argument becomes clearer if you superimpose this<br/>\nintermediate scope on your mind, which probabiliy<br/>\nrequires the understanding of the &#39;theoretical&#39; Taoism<br/>\nand Confucianism in addition to the &#39;Japanese&#39;<br/>\nBuddhism.(Mere understaning or reading of primitive<br/>\nTaosim and Confucianism books would not help as I<br/>\npointed out before)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yes, taoism had an influence in japanese culture,<br/>\n&gt; but buddhism is another<br/>\n&gt; case.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can we discuss the Japanese culture without Buddhism?<br/>\nYes, we can. But, as I said, it depends on your scope<br/>\nof analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Your information is incorrect, specially if ye take<br/>\n&gt; in an absolute degree.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I never draw my argument in an absolute degree.<br/>\nHowever, I was absolute in my scope of observation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We can say at certain points that in popular sence,<br/>\n&gt; due to the Shinbutsu<br/>\n&gt; Shugo historical phenomena, there was some<br/>\n&gt; syncretisms between buddhism and<br/>\n&gt; shindo (way of the gods, the indigenous faith of<br/>\n&gt; japan, also know as<br/>\n&gt; shintoism) <br/>\n </span></blockquote>True. But in the sense of short-ranged(not meant for<br/>\nany negative sense) studies on &#39;Pure&#39;(if any) Japanese<br/>\nBuddihism. (I do not need to reiterate that it is the<br/>\nrelative judgement)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you read the Shingon-shu founder Kubo Daishi<br/>\n&gt; K�kai Great Treatise about<br/>\n&gt; the three religions, including Buddhism, Taoism and<br/>\n&gt; Confucionism, you would<br/>\n&gt; see his great knowledge about these three<br/>\n&gt; philosofical systems, but showing<br/>\n&gt; Buddhism as supperior, so discouraging mixes and<br/>\n&gt; saladas<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even on the continent(China and Korea), there were<br/>\n&#39;mixes and saladas&#39;. But, it simply looked like it<br/>\nwhen we did not make a rigid distinction between<br/>\nBuddhism and &#39;Folk&#39; Buddhism. Recall that many of<br/>\ncommon people in the North Asis were illiterate<br/>\nwhereas the nobility class exhibited intelligence of<br/>\nhigh complexity and rigor until the modernization<br/>\nperiod.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, what is the meaning of these?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are you nuts Mr Lee?<br/>\n&gt; study more before saying ignorant things about<br/>\n&gt; Japan.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My current research area is on quantum mechanics and<br/>\nit application to social sciences.

They have a direct linneage of tranmission direct from<br/>\nBoddhidharma who also transmitted the Bodhisattva Vajramukti that is the<br/>\nroot of the majority of several asiatic martial systems, including Karate<br/>\nwhose movements are based on the paterns of the Maha-Mandala that is the<br/>\nembodyment of the three holy bodies of Dai-nichi Nyorai (Maha Vairocana<br/>\nTathagâta) and Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni Tathagâta).<br/>\n<br/>\nstudy more before saying ignorant things about Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a Mikkyo follower, including Shugendo, for several years in my past,<br/>\nand even if no longer a buddhist, I still respect this way due to their<br/>\ntolerance towards others religions, unlike certain ones that promoted a real<br/>\nbloodshed in Europe, Japan, Brazil, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho<br/>\nSão Paulo - SP Brazil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 10<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 4 Feb 2004 02:58:59 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n   From: Lee Changsub &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:knorr31@...\">knorr31@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: One minor point<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Group:<br/>\nI often have read discussions involving Buddihism as a<br/>\npart of the Japanese culture.<br/>\nWith regard to the connection of the Japanese Buddhism<br/>\nto that of India, South Asia, and Tibet, I want to<br/>\npoint out that they are significantly different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japanese Buddism results from intellectual<br/>\ninteraction among Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism<br/>\nitself throughout centuries, the first two of which<br/>\ndid not really have much effect on India, South Asia,<br/>\nand Tibet.<br/>\nThrough this interaction, primitive Taoism and<br/>\nConfucianism was reborn as more subtle and complex<br/>\nphilosophy with rigorous logical structures in 5 and<br/>\n12 centuries respectivly.As for the proper terminology<br/>\nfor the present Taoism and Confuncianism for the<br/>\nWesterners, I personally think that words like<br/>\n&#39;Theoretical&#39; Taoism and Confuciansim would suit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of reasons why I think that we need to<br/>\nconsider having a distinctly different cultural<br/>\nclassification covering Japan, China, and<br/>\nKorea.(something like North Asia or North East Asia)<br/>\nThis may be one of fertile area of research for<br/>\nWestern scholars for the coming years.

I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; &gt; trying to think of an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; historical illustration of this... Can&#39;t. Does anyone else know of a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; restoration of a class through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; revolt or law? In The Three Musketeers, this happens with the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Musketeers. But that&#39;s fiction,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the Musketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there might be some <br/>\n&gt; &gt; parallels). Lookin&#39; for a real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; historical example...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a different idea...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real <br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyday life, the caste<br/>\n&gt; &gt; system is just as real as it was before the laws. The law only serves <br/>\n&gt; &gt; its purpose if people obey<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it, or if it is enforced. So it is theoretically possible, also, that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; descendents of samurai could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for all intents and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished. Of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; course, what a samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; today would do or be is ... well... difficult to imagine. Maybe they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; would carry two guns instead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police <br/>\n&gt; &gt; force.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Theoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; abolishment of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public <br/>\n&gt; &gt; still regarded them as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; samurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Governments often act in an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; would that group of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think they would.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This has some parallel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and woman &quot;shack up&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for an extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they have never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and wife. That was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; common practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eventually <br/>\n&gt; &gt; recognized this and would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after said elapse of time pronounce them legally man and wife (so the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; government could get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; additional taxes out of them).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; government acknowledged<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one man and wife. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of paper&quot; from the government to confirm <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or legitimize the marriage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Public practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal <br/>\n&gt; &gt; action.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public <br/>\n&gt; &gt; acceptance, apart from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; law, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw <br/>\n&gt; &gt; marriage or the Indian caste<br/>\n&gt; &gt; system), how much of the public would it take to justify that claim? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s the critical mass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; required for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the samurai&#39;s heyday,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as it was. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe 51%? A simple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; majority? Who decides what the percentage would be?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today... but theoretically, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Honestly, I do not understand the meaning of the whole discussion. <br/>\n&gt; Theoretically, you can speculate, but it makes no sense at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Modern Japan is a democracy, and classes have nothing to do with it. <br/>\n&gt; There is no way the government is going to pay a salary to samurai <br/>\n&gt; descendants, no way people could go around the country carrying <br/>\n&gt; weapons, and once again I remind you that to be a samurai means to <br/>\n&gt; ***SERVE*** a lord.<br/>\n&gt; So, who will they serve? Shogun Koizumi?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Moreover, the comparison with India does not hold up. India is a 75% <br/>\n&gt; rural country, a pseudo-democracy, and a country where the great <br/>\n&gt; majority of people are Hindu: classes are defined by religion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thus, unlike in Japan, Indian society is still structured on a vertical <br/>\n&gt; axis, especially at the village level. Japan has vertical relationships <br/>\n&gt; in schools, companies, etc. but NOT in its constitution. The vertical <br/>\n&gt; relationships in Japan are of a microcosmic nature, and do not permeate <br/>\n&gt; society as a whole.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Finally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not yet mollified by Western <br/>\n&gt; influences and got rid of  Buddhism.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These are the reasons why Hindu ideology can still continue. (And of <br/>\n&gt; course -as usual- there are economic reasons as well.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And talking about economy, being the second wealthiest country in the <br/>\n&gt; world, having schools, hospitals, Panasonics and Toyotas, do you think <br/>\n&gt; the Japanese would care a bit about restoring a medieval social class?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Guys: give up.<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s stop confounding history with reactionary science fiction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cepo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

There has also been a whole series debates on whether certain authors&#39; books are just rehashes, organizing trips to Kyoto, want-to-be samurai, and sometimes even just plain old simple abuse.  Most has been enjoyable, some not so. Not everyone can be interested in the same topics or conversations (however hypothetical), so I don&#39;t feel certain members should simply try to put a block on what other another member, or members, wish to talk about.<br/>\nLet the tirades commence.<br/>\nM.Lorimer <br/>\n<br/>\nCesare Polenghi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cepo@...\">cepo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 2, 2004, at 7:19 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:golfmandan@...\">golfmandan@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It is theoretically possible, though, that the class could be <br/>\n&gt; restored, either through a legal<br/>\n&gt; decision, or through a collective revolt by samurai descendents.

So it is theoretically possible, also, that <br/>\n&gt; descendents of samurai could<br/>\n&gt; claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would <br/>\n&gt; for all intents and<br/>\n&gt; purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished. Of <br/>\n&gt; course, what a samurai<br/>\n&gt; today would do or be is ... well... difficult to imagine. Maybe they <br/>\n&gt; would carry two guns instead<br/>\n&gt; of two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police <br/>\n&gt; force.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Theoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the <br/>\n&gt; abolishment of the<br/>\n&gt; samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public <br/>\n&gt; still regarded them as<br/>\n&gt; samurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. <br/>\n&gt; (Governments often act in an<br/>\n&gt; inconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, <br/>\n&gt; would that group of<br/>\n&gt; people still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think they would.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This has some parallel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man <br/>\n&gt; and woman &quot;shack up&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for an extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though <br/>\n&gt; they have never<br/>\n&gt; exchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man <br/>\n&gt; and wife. That was<br/>\n&gt; common practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eventually <br/>\n&gt; recognized this and would<br/>\n&gt; after said elapse of time pronounce them legally man and wife (so the <br/>\n&gt; government could get<br/>\n&gt; additional taxes out of them).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the <br/>\n&gt; government acknowledged<br/>\n&gt; them to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one man and wife. <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many<br/>\n&gt; cultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of paper&quot; from the government to confirm <br/>\n&gt; or legitimize the marriage.<br/>\n&gt; Public practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal <br/>\n&gt; action.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public <br/>\n&gt; acceptance, apart from<br/>\n&gt; law, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw <br/>\n&gt; marriage or the Indian caste<br/>\n&gt; system), how much of the public would it take to justify that claim? <br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s the critical mass<br/>\n&gt; required for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in <br/>\n&gt; the samurai&#39;s heyday,<br/>\n&gt; there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as it was. <br/>\n&gt; Maybe 51%? A simple<br/>\n&gt; majority?

The vertical <br/>\nrelationships in Japan are of a microcosmic nature, and do not permeate <br/>\nsociety as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not yet mollified by Western <br/>\ninfluences and got rid of  Buddhism.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the reasons why Hindu ideology can still continue.

I&#39;m trying to think of an <br/>\n&gt;historical illustration of this... Can&#39;t. Does anyone else know of a restoration of a class through <br/>\n&gt;revolt or law? In The Three Musketeers, this happens with the Musketeers. But that&#39;s fiction, <br/>\n&gt;and the Musketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there might be some parallels). Lookin&#39; for a real <br/>\n&gt;historical example...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s a different idea...<br/>\n&gt;In India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real everyday life, the caste <br/>\n&gt;system is just as real as it was before the laws. The law only serves its purpose if people obey <br/>\n&gt;it, or if it is enforced. So it is theoretically possible, also, that descendents of samurai could <br/>\n&gt;claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would for all intents and <br/>\n&gt;purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished. Of course, what a samurai <br/>\n&gt;today would do or be is ... well... difficult to imagine. Maybe they would carry two guns instead <br/>\n&gt;of two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police force.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Theoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the abolishment of the <br/>\n&gt;samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public still regarded them as <br/>\n&gt;samurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. (Governments often act in an <br/>\n&gt;inconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, would that group of <br/>\n&gt;people still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think they would. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This has some parallel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man and woman &quot;shack up&quot; <br/>\n&gt;for an extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though they have never <br/>\n&gt;exchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man and wife. That was <br/>\n&gt;common practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eventually recognized this and would <br/>\n&gt;after said elapse of time pronounce them legally man and wife (so the government could get <br/>\n&gt;additional taxes out of them).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the government acknowledged <br/>\n&gt;them to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one man and wife. It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many <br/>\n&gt;cultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of paper&quot; from the government to confirm or legitimize the marriage. <br/>\n&gt;Public practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal action. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public acceptance, apart from <br/>\n&gt;law, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw marriage or the Indian caste <br/>\n&gt;system), how much of the public would it take to justify that claim? What&#39;s the critical mass <br/>\n&gt;required for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in the samurai&#39;s heyday, <br/>\n&gt;there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as it was. Maybe 51%? A simple <br/>\n&gt;majority? Who decides what the percentage would be?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today... but theoretically, it&#39;s possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Konnichi wa, tomodachi<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This is going to seem as if I am against samurai, which I am not. I am<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rather intrigued by them, in their day. Follow me on this for a moment<br/>\n&gt;&gt; if you will...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; When Slavery was abolished in the United States, there were people who<br/>\n&gt;&gt; still thought slavery was a good idea, and people who didn&#39;t.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1010978681\">It is theoretically possible, though, that the class could be restored, either through a legal <br/>\ndecision, or through a collective revolt by samurai descendents. I&#39;m trying to think of an <br/>\nhistorical illustration of this... Can&#39;t. Does anyone else know of a restoration of a class through <br/>\nrevolt or law? In The Three Musketeers, this happens with the Musketeers. But that&#39;s fiction, <br/>\nand the Musketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there might be some parallels). Lookin&#39; for a real <br/>\nhistorical example...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a different idea...<br/>\nIn India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real everyday life, the caste <br/>\nsystem is just as real as it was before the laws. The law only serves its purpose if people obey <br/>\nit, or if it is enforced. So it is theoretically possible, also, that descendents of samurai could <br/>\nclaim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would for all intents and <br/>\npurposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished. Of course, what a samurai <br/>\ntoday would do or be is ... well... difficult to imagine. Maybe they would carry two guns instead <br/>\nof two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police force.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the abolishment of the <br/>\nsamurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public still regarded them as <br/>\nsamurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. (Governments often act in an <br/>\ninconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, would that group of <br/>\npeople still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they would. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has some parallel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man and woman &quot;shack up&quot; <br/>\nfor an extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though they have never <br/>\nexchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man and wife. That was <br/>\ncommon practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eventually recognized this and would <br/>\nafter said elapse of time pronounce them legally man and wife (so the government could get <br/>\nadditional taxes out of them).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the government acknowledged <br/>\nthem to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one man and wife. It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many <br/>\ncultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of paper&quot; from the government to confirm or legitimize the marriage. <br/>\nPublic practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal action. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public acceptance, apart from <br/>\nlaw, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw marriage or the Indian caste <br/>\nsystem), how much of the public would it take to justify that claim? What&#39;s the critical mass <br/>\nrequired for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in the samurai&#39;s heyday, <br/>\nthere were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as it was. Maybe 51%? A simple <br/>\nmajority? Who decides what the percentage would be?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today... but theoretically, it&#39;s possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Konnichi wa, tomodachi<br/>\n&gt; This is going to seem as if I am against samurai, which I am not. I am<br/>\n&gt; rather intrigued by them, in their day. Follow me on this for a moment<br/>\n&gt; if you will...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When Slavery was abolished in the United States, there were people who<br/>\n&gt; still thought slavery was a good idea, and people who didn&#39;t. After<br/>\n&gt; the abolishment of slavery, for the most part, former slave owners<br/>\n&gt; rarely went about saying they were members of a class that proudly<br/>\n&gt; owned other human beings and had the right to life or death over them.<br/>\n&gt; The law didn&#39;t allow that any more, and for the most part, and the<br/>\n&gt; general populace would not stand for that. The abolishment was drilled<br/>\n&gt; into the public psyche, as was the concept that slave owners were not<br/>\n&gt; needed in a changed society, and that all races and classes should be<br/>\n&gt; free and theoretically equal. Owning slaves was made not-noble.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Samurai had an equal right of life or death over those of lesser<br/>\n&gt; class, held all of the benefits of the current society, and when<br/>\n&gt; Samurai were abolished, the general psyche of the public thought they<br/>\n&gt; were as un-needed as slave owners were in the U.S.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I suppose one could say they were still slave owners if they were<br/>\n&gt; the descendants of slave owners...but the public would not look kindly<br/>\n&gt; on that, nor would I suspect the public would look kindly on Samurai.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There were good samurai, and the parts of samurai life that were noble<br/>\n&gt; should be celebrated but lets not forget it was a package deal. - just<br/>\n&gt; like there were, I suppose, some good slave owners, but the society<br/>\n&gt; evolved around them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just other thoughts...<br/>\n&gt; Christopher <br/>\n&gt; (who celebrates the good parts of samurai life, but is aware there are<br/>\n&gt; bad ones...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So theoretically the descendants of the samurai class could<br/>\n&gt; therefore still consider themselves to be samurai, although not with a<br/>\n&gt; legal foundation, with the laws enacted during the Meiji Restoration<br/>\n&gt; being formulated by the winners, if not nessarily/hypothetically those<br/>\n&gt; in the &#39;right&#39; ??<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just a thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; M.Lorimer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
