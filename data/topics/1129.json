Andrea Brascaro did<br/>\nedit some book of Hideyoshis letters. I&#39;ve never seen it but I hazard to<br/>\nguess it wouldn&#39;t shed any light either. As for the drama itself, (which is<br/>\nthis years by the way episode 33 aired sunday night) I&#39;m rather<br/>\ndissappointed especially in the battle scenes or lack thereof, Okehazama was<br/>\na mess and Shizugatake wasn&#39;t even there. This was a let down following the<br/>\nCG enhanced battles from 2000s Aoi Tokugawa Sandai, and last years Hojo<br/>\nTokimune. However my wife loves it, and its been a hit in the ratings<br/>\nstaying in the top five dramas. Taiga drama has basically become a &#39;trendy&#39;<br/>\njidaigeki drama. I wonder what NHK will do with next years Musashi? Another<br/>\ndrama I saw had Hideyoshi in love with Ochi, Nobunagas sister. I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthey will ever make a drama about the &#39;relationship&#39; between Nobunaga and<br/>\nToshiie though..<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 26, 2002 10:52 AM<br/>\nSubject: [samuraihistory] One vs. Matsu?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got a question regarding the relationships<br/>\n&gt; between Kinoshita Tokichiro (the future<br/>\n&gt; Hashiba/Toyotomi Hideyoshi) and his wife One, and<br/>\n&gt; Maeda Toshiie and his wife Matsu. Most of what I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; read that touches on the subject is fictional works,<br/>\n&gt; notably Eiji Yoshikawa&#39;s &quot;Taiko&quot; and Taiga Drama. If<br/>\n&gt; you listen to Yoshikawa&#39;s story and the &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Taiga drama (1996), One was pursued by both Tokichiro<br/>\n&gt; and Toshiie, and Tokichiro won her heart and married<br/>\n&gt; her. It&#39;s portrayed as part of his charm, how he could<br/>\n&gt; get this wonderfully beautiful (and smart) woman who<br/>\n&gt; was above his station to love the little monkey, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After watching the first 4 episodes of &quot;Toshiie to<br/>\n&gt; Matsu&quot; (1997, I think?) the story it tells is that One<br/>\n&gt; and Matsu were vying for Toshiie&#39;s affections, and<br/>\n&gt; Matsu won. One was ordered by Nobunaga to marry<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Saru-dono&quot; (Monkey Lord) Tokichiro, and she was very<br/>\n&gt; unhappy about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know that all this is fiction. My question is, is<br/>\n&gt; there anything academic that documents the relations<br/>\n&gt; between the 4, and what is the truth about their<br/>\n&gt; relationships? Or is it all left open to fictional<br/>\n&gt; interpretation? I figured the Ehon Taiko-ki wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go into great detail about how the great Taiko&#39;s wife<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to marry him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is very interesting to watch the two different<br/>\n&gt; Taiga Drama&#39;s and see the differences.
