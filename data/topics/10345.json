            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1255586711\">Here are the Introduction to Japanese History Series podcast episodes we&#39;ve done so far:<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 1: Prehistory <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/mXo50f\">http://bit.ly/mXo50f</a><br/>\nFor part one of our Introduction to Japanese History series, we&#39;ll be starting at the beginning of the earliest history of the Japanese archipelago and the changes that took place in culture and technology from the Paleolithic period to the Jomon period, which takes us from prehistory to approximately 300BC.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 2: Yayoi and Kofun period <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/nFligr\">http://bit.ly/nFligr</a><br/>\nFor part two of our Introduction to Japanese History series, we&#39;ll be covering the Yayoi period which was a sharp change from the culture of the Jomon period, where there was a massive influx of NE Asians into the Japanese archipelago. This was followed by the Kofun period, where Japan began to slowly consolidate and unify into a confederacy. The name of the Kofun period comes from the huge keyhole shaped burial mounds known as &quot;Kofun&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 3: Asuka-Nara period (Part 1) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/ozFahT\">http://bit.ly/ozFahT</a><br/>\nContinuing our Introduction to Japanese History podcast series, we will examine the Asuka-Nara period over two episodes. The Asuka-Nara period (538AD-794AD) is known for it&#39;s classic art and architecture, the introduction of Buddhism, and the Taika reforms and Ritsuryo system. Japan adopted many Chinese style institutions, began to form a national government, and started to assert itself internationally in East Asia.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 4: Asuka-Nara Period (Part 2) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/nOMqVt\">http://bit.ly/nOMqVt</a><br/>\nContinuing our Introduction to Japanese History series is part 2 of our Asuka-Nara podcast. <br/>\nThe Asuka-Nara period (538AD-794AD) is known for it&#39;s classic art and architecture, the introduction of Buddhism, and the Taika reforms and Ritsuryo system.

The Heian period is known for it&#39;s art, literature, and poetry, as well as the spread of Tendai and Shingon Buddhism.<br/>\n<br/>\nComing up next week - the rise of the warrior class.</div>",
