(He was probably more cultivated than Nobunaga as well ;o). Thus, <br/>\nthe opinions we have in the West about Caesar might somehow <br/>\n***resemble*** the ones the Japanese have on Nobunaga.<br/>\nOf course, -as you have said- these analogies are always tricky. After <br/>\nall, even here the scenario is different, and the temporal difference <br/>\nis greater (even thou life and warfare in Nobunaga&#39;s times probably <br/>\nresembles more Ceasar&#39;s Rome than Hitler&#39;s Europe...).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway... phew... just mention Nobunaga, and see what happens... :oD<br/>\ncepo<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-531081114\">Greetings <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;Message: 11 <br/>\n&gt; Date: Sat, 5 Jun 2004 22:33:15 -1000 <br/>\n&gt; From: Cesare Polenghi <br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Nobunaga as a villain <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;1 - He was a &quot;strong man,&quot; and the Japanese revere people with strong <br/>\n&gt;will. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Japanese of old was not stupid. They recognized tyrant leaders when <br/>\nhappened, and there is why so many villagers suicidal revolutions happened <br/>\nin Japan history against bad daimyos when things got really bad! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;2 - Asia has a tradition of men who cared about &quot;duty,&quot; rather than <br/>\n&gt;about individuals. Just think of the indian Prince Krishna in the <br/>\n&gt;Bhagavad-Gita, of the Chinese first Emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di (who&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;celebrated even in recent times, by Mao Tze Tung, rather than in Jet <br/>\n&gt;Li&#39;s &quot;Hero&quot;), and of course of Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Nobunaga had a <br/>\n&gt;goal: to unify Japan. He dedicated his life to that, and he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;stop at nothing. Some people like such attitude. <br/>\n&gt;Again, careful with comparisons with people such as Hitler. Hitler <br/>\n&gt;invaded foreign countries, and he created a bureaucratic apparatus to <br/>\n&gt;kill civilians (=concentration camps). Nobunaga played in his own <br/>\n&gt;country and he killed simply what was on his way. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is a thing ye hast forgot.... <br/>\nHe was not &quot;playing in his own country&quot;. Japan was not a country at that <br/>\ntime, but MANY countries. Many nations. <br/>\nSo, he did exactly the same, including genocide against people who disagreed <br/>\nwith him or hated religions... Just like Hitler... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3 - Finally, it can be argued that Nobunaga, just as many other <br/>\n&gt;unifiers, worked for a &#39;greater good.&#39; The unification was necessarily <br/>\n&gt;a bloodshed, but what emerged at its end (the Tokugawa Shogunate) <br/>\n&gt;formed the basis for modern Japan and guaranteed 250+ years of relative <br/>\n&gt;peace. Ultimately, if Japan would have go on &quot;sengokuing&quot; another <br/>\n&gt;100-200 years, it would have been routed easily by the first Western <br/>\n&gt;fleet arriving. So, the unification was a good thing for Japan, I would <br/>\n&gt;say. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup! That is why I say that Tokugawa was the one who did the right thing, <br/>\nAnd also, doing Japan cultural preservation. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;In general, our approach as historians (??) should be less judgmental. <br/>\n&gt;We are here to observe, perhaps comment, but we are in no position to <br/>\n&gt;judge the &quot;morality&quot; or the &quot;sense of justice&quot; of a man who lived some <br/>\n&gt;500 years ago in a far away country, engulfed in a civil war. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Sure, by our modern Enlightenment-Christian influenced standard, he was <br/>\n&gt;a villain. But this is a biased point of view. I think. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whoï¿½s &quot;modern-enlightenment-christian influenced standard&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Individual Liberties line of though is not christian in any way. <br/>\nAnd I think the guy of Sweden guessed what I am. Just would say that I am <br/>\nnot even an monotheist. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;cepo <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;PS = I believe Nobunaga was not killed by ninja, but by Akechi <br/>\n&gt;Mitsuhide&#39;s men. Apparently, Nobunaga was on his way to Kyoto to do <br/>\n&gt;some tea ceremony. He stayed over at a temple, and there he&#39;s got it. <br/>\n&gt;There is no historical evidence of his death, however. The temple <br/>\n&gt;(Honnouji) burnt down, and he probably perished in the fire, perhaps <br/>\n&gt;after committing seppuku. It was 1582. Hideyoshi, was campaigning in <br/>\n&gt;the West, and once he heard the news he returned to Kyoto, and he <br/>\n&gt;destroyed Akechi Mitsuhide, to become the new leader of Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a book saying something different. But is not at this house I am now. <br/>\nSo I must someday go to my parents house, research the book and tell its <br/>\nsources. Lets say that this book is one that also promote Hatsumi Massaaki <br/>\nSensei. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards <br/>\n<br/>\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho <br/>\nSï¿½o Paulo - SP Brazil <br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nVoce quer um iGMail protegido contra vï¿½rus e spams?<br/>\nClique aqui: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\">http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br</a><br/>\nOfertas imperdï¿½veis!
