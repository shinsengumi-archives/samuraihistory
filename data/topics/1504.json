It&#39;s supposed to get a bit nastier later on. I&#39;m pretty sure <br/>\nEndo-sensei didn&#39;t write a single happy book. Of course I&#39;m American, so <br/>\nI like heros and happy endings. Something hard to find in most other <br/>\ncultures writings. For those on the list interested in historical <br/>\nfiction, he also wrote a book called Samurai which is a story about some <br/>\nlow level flunkies sent to Mexico and then Rome to negotiate treaties <br/>\nfor their lord. I think this one and Chinmoku have English editions. He <br/>\nwas at one time considered for the Nobel Prize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: jonathan lee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinobij@...\">shinobij@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m new to this group and fairly ignorant when it comes to the subject of samurai, but what i kow i find facinating and i&#39;m dying (not literally) to know more.

Type in samurai, sengoku, daimyo, etc. and be <br/>\nprepared to burn lots of time. You could also buy some of Stephen <br/>\nTurnbull&#39;s or Tony Bryant&#39;s books on the subject ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",
