I think of it as a &#39;time machine&#39;<br/>\nwith which I can go to my favourite era in Japanese<br/>\nhistory: The Sengoku Jiddai (The Era of Warring<br/>\nStates).<br/>\n   I fell in love with it the first time I saw the<br/>\nscreen shots in a magazine and many tales of glorious<br/>\nbattles from a few of my fellow Daimyo at school. Too<br/>\nbad you just can&#39;t simulate a battle as EPIC as the<br/>\nBattle of Sekigahara or the Battle of Dan no Ura.<br/>\nAlthough that would be cool...<br/>\n   In reply to the comment on using Sun Tzu&#39;s Art of<br/>\nWar during the game, I agree that using the &quot;Holy<br/>\nTome&quot; is very useful. Note that in the modern day,<br/>\nChinese and Japanese businessmen has used the Art of<br/>\nWar for business strategy. Too bad you can&#39;t use it<br/>\nfor &quot;conquering&quot; your friends... (&quot;Bow to me, slave!&quot;)<br/>\n   Try using other books based on East Asian warfare,<br/>\nespescially ones written by Dr. Stephen Turnbull.<br/>\n   Oh, one final thing. If Sun Tzu was a Japanese<br/>\ndaimyo during the Sengoku Jiddai, the war would&#39;ve<br/>\nended much sooner than we know it now. He&#39;d probably<br/>\nexploit the uses of Ninjas, Shinobi and Arquebuses<br/>\nmore than the other daimyo would!!<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
