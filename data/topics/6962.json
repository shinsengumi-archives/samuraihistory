            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1987774125\">REVIEWS <br/>\n<br/>\nHanzo the Razor: The Snare (1973) <br/>\n<br/>\nAKA: n/a<br/>\n<br/>\nPremise: Renegade officer Hanzo&#39;s (Shintaro Katsu) investigation of <br/>\na fouled abortion at the hands of a cult-like practitioner leads him <br/>\nto a twisted S&M party hosted by a Buddhist nun and attended by a <br/>\nhigh-ranking treasury officer he had previously insulted. As a <br/>\nresult of this insult, Hanzo is put on his toughest case yet, to <br/>\ncatch the country&#39;s most notorious thief. <br/>\n<br/>\nReview: Round two in the Hanzo the Razor samurai exploitation <br/>\ntrilogy sees Shintaro Katzu (The Tale of Zatoichi) return to the <br/>\nrole of a tough-as-nails police officer out to uncover corruption <br/>\nwith an array of fierce weaponry, torture practices and his <br/>\noversized penis with which he uses to interrogate his female <br/>\nsuspects into pleasured compliance. It&#39;s part gut-wrenching <br/>\nchambara, part sleazy sexploitation and all live-action manga from <br/>\nthe creator of Lone Wolf and Cub.<br/>\n<br/>\nEasily-offended viewers beware. The Snare and its two companion <br/>\nfilms are not your typical samurai movies. Filled with unrepentant <br/>\nviolence and sexual depravity, they are Shintaro Katsu&#39;s answer to <br/>\nthe popular Western exploitation films of the early &#39;70s. And of the <br/>\nthree, The Snare is probably the most sensational.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt kicks off with a bang as Hanzo and his loyal deputies chase down <br/>\na pair of petty thieves, only to end up in a tussle with samurai in <br/>\nthe employ of a high-ranking treasury officer. This sets Hanzo on a <br/>\ncollision course with trouble as he makes enemies of the officer&#39;s <br/>\nsamurai bodyguard and ends up having to take on the country&#39;s most <br/>\nnotorious thief or face the possibility of ritual suicide. Of <br/>\ncourse, he goes about his business with his usual lack of tact and <br/>\ndiscretion. This includes tracing a string of ritualistic abortions <br/>\nto an S&M gathering at a Buddhist Temple where nuns are kidnapping <br/>\nand drugging women to satisfy the sadistic pleasures of the treasury <br/>\nofficer and a group of business owners. Unable to prove the <br/>\nofficer&#39;s involvement, Hanzo tortures and pleasures the head nun <br/>\ninto a full confession. With his career and life at stake, Hanzo <br/>\ntakes on the mission to bring in the country&#39;s most dangerous <br/>\ncriminal, a killer and thief named Shobei Hamajima (Kei Sato). Hanzo <br/>\nsets a trap at the treasury by hiding away with the female steward, <br/>\na widow he decides needs a little special attention in order to keep <br/>\nher from giving his presence away when the thief arrives.<br/>\n<br/>\nJapan is known for creating some pretty eccentric entertainment. One <br/>\nlook at the adult anime and manga business will provide plenty of <br/>\nexamples. Even so, there is little to prepare a viewer for the Hanzo <br/>\nfilms. The Snare is easily one of the most outrageous samurai movies <br/>\never made and probably has more in common with Hong Kong&#39;s category <br/>\nIII period films like Sex and Zen than your typical samurai <br/>\nactioner. Shintaro Katsu shamelessly runs around half naked through <br/>\nthe film, conditioning his enlarged manhood with a stick, defiling a <br/>\nsack of rice with it, and jamming it into reluctant women who are <br/>\nquick to call out for more. At one point, he is nearly crushing a <br/>\nbald nun&#39;s legs with the weight of large bricks and the next, has <br/>\nher suspended from the ceiling and spinning in delight as <br/>\nhe &quot;probes&quot; her for more information while threatening to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatsu&#39;s &quot;gift&quot; to Japanese cinema is in creating a winning formula <br/>\nand revisiting it over and over again without fully tapping it dry <br/>\nas he did with the Zatoichi franchise. While keyed up a bit, this <br/>\nfilm is essentially a rehash of the first, Sword of Justice. It <br/>\nimproves in its pacing and exploitive nature, while appearing less <br/>\nof an overt rip-off of blaxploitation cinema. With a nod to the cult-<br/>\nlike fetishes of European trash cinema of the day and a ramping up <br/>\nof topless nudity, sadist action and grizzly deaths, Katsu even more <br/>\nclearly defines his exploitive take on the samurai genre. However, <br/>\nits these same features that will undoubtedly turn off more <br/>\nmainstream audiences whose preferences lean towards compelling <br/>\nperiod drama and classical swordplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny way you slice it, The Snare is still just just Shintaro Katsu&#39;s <br/>\nsensational attempt to cash in on a trend and neither represents the <br/>\njidei geki well nor his abilities as an action film star. Anyone not <br/>\neasily offended who is looking for something out of the ordinary <br/>\nmight find this of interest. Typical chambara fans would be better <br/>\nserved by sticking with Katsu&#39;s equally exploitive, but more action-<br/>\noriented Lone Wolf and Cub films. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Mark Pollard<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/hanzotherazor02_042005.htm\">http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/hanzotherazor02_042005.htm</a></div>",
