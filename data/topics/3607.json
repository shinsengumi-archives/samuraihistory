I hope they will add in a positive manner to this<br/>\nconversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  May it please the fellow list members (smile)<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  1. Did samurai exist before they were made into a class?<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  It depends on your concept of Samurai. This step supercedes mere lexical<br/>\nspeculation. Defining a term avoids ambiguity and rhetoric usage of words<br/>\n(&quot;doublespeak&quot;, as in &quot;1984&quot;). For this brief discussion, I hold &quot;Samurai&quot;<br/>\nas a social class, and, hence, any statement containing to members of a<br/>\nSamurai class before its ascension unto a social class cannot be considered<br/>\nvalid. If you define &quot;Samurai&quot; as &quot;retainer&quot;, then there were members of a<br/>\nSamurai class before it was turned into a social class. What should be<br/>\navoided, if possible, is the usage of the word &quot;Samurai&quot; with both meanings,<br/>\nunder a single context.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  2. Why is legitimacy by the government so important to the abolishment of<br/>\nthe class of samurai?<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  Please consider the &quot;Language Systems&quot; Philosophical School of Thought, if<br/>\nyou will. Think of any given &quot;due process of law&quot; - if the highest court in<br/>\na country utters &quot;the sky is yellow&quot;, no matter any what other language (as<br/>\nthe scientific) holds, the sky is yellow, because the State will have the<br/>\npower to enforce the ruling. Will it make the sky turn yellow before other<br/>\nlanguage systems (as the ones pertaining to human perception)? Definitely<br/>\nnot. However, the given State may enforce the ruling, for, before the Legal<br/>\nLanguage System, &quot;the sky is yellow&quot;.<br/>\n  ThatÂ´s why the person uttering the language is so important: dynamic<br/>\nvalidity arises from the utterance process and uttering person. Static<br/>\nvalidity - the contents of the ruling - is assessed at a later stage. Sure,<br/>\nthis may be unjust, unfair, incorrect and inefficient - however valid,<br/>\nnonetheless.<br/>\n  Such School of Thought, although supported by many researchers, is not an<br/>\nunanimity. Please do not take me as a zealot for it, but it is an<br/>\ninteresting tool of investigation which should be considered.<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  3. Why did some samurai families hide their swords instead of obeying the<br/>\ngovernment?<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  Sorry, I do not hold enough data in order to address this topic.<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  4. When the WW II officers carried swords did they, the military, or<br/>\nanyone else consider them samurai?<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  Again, sorry, but I do not hold enough data in order to address this<br/>\ntopic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Again, I hope those ideas are proper to this tread.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thiago<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  From: Chris Ketterling<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, February 04, 2004 5:43 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Trying to learn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m trying to grasp the whole &quot;There are no Samurai&quot; argument by patching<br/>\nup some holes in my thought process.<br/>\n<br/>\n  1. Did samurai exist before they were made into a class?<br/>\n<br/>\n  2. Why is legitimacy by the government so important to the abolishment of<br/>\nthe class of samurai?<br/>\n<br/>\n  3.
