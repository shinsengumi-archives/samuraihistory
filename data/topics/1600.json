            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-686913635\">It is interisting to note that famous and well known Bushi(those of <br/>\nthe warrior class) are shown in times leading up to the Tokugawa <br/>\npeace 1605-1867 with Nobunaga, Hidayoshi, Ieyasu and others of the <br/>\nMori, Hojo, ect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also those within the Menji Restoration, and times of rebellion <br/>\nby the last of the bushi class. Satsuma being the most well known of <br/>\nsuch rebellions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet, with the noteable acception of Musashi, of which i am still <br/>\ntrying to find historical evidance of his existance, there are very <br/>\nfew bushi of note during the Tokugawa peace.<br/>\n<br/>\npersonaly I have found that many of the myths and movies, that have <br/>\nfed off those myths tend to show much of the life during the Peace, <br/>\nbeing the one on one battles in forests and along roads. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to say that popular and interisting bushi didn&#39;t arise out of <br/>\nsuch era, it is more that they really had no way to get any sort of <br/>\nrecognition, due to the overall lack of major battles during the <br/>\nPeace.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Atsi</div>",
