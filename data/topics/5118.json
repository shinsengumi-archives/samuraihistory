And most of his<br/>\nbooks, individually, are good. The biggest problem<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen is that most of the books are extremely<br/>\nrepetitive. The same anecdotes, the same outline, etc.<br/>\nWhile some of this can be excused by &quot;updating&quot;--his<br/>\nfirst books were published in the 1970&#39;s, so it&#39;<br/>\nunderstandable things will change somewhat--it&#39;s<br/>\nalmost like if you own one Turnbull book, you own them<br/>\nall. The fact that he keeps publishing more and more<br/>\n(Especially &#39;Samurai Warriors&#39;, &#39;Samurai Warlords&#39;,<br/>\netc.,) seems like he&#39;s just reshuffling and adding a<br/>\nnew title to make more money. The second complaint I<br/>\noften see is &quot;inaccuracies&quot;--some of his earlier<br/>\nstuff, especially, is, well, wrong on many points. He<br/>\ndoes seem to correct that in later works, at least. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, he&#39;s great because with all his<br/>\nfaults, he gets information out there. He&#39;s much<br/>\neasier to read than John Whitney Hall, etc. I just<br/>\nbought 2 more books by him, and I&#39;ll let you know what<br/>\nI think when I get them from Amazon. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
