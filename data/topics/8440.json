Yes, I know I&#39;m not<br/>\nactually dyslexic--it was a bit tongue in cheek. My<br/>\nwife actually does have mild dyslexia, so it certainly<br/>\nwasn&#39;t meant to be insensitive (funnily enough, she<br/>\nkicks my butt at reading/using katakana). <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 12 years of studying Japanese and living off and<br/>\non in Japan, I&#39;m well aware of the differences between<br/>\nthe characters that you point out above. It&#39;s not a<br/>\nlack of knowledge--hence why I describe it as a<br/>\n&quot;dyslexia&quot;. Sometimes my brain simply doesn&#39;t compute<br/>\nthe katakana word I&#39;m looking at, even though I&#39;d see<br/>\nthe same thing in hiragana and not miss a beat. For<br/>\ninstance, even though I&#39;ve seen the word ¥¢¥ë¥Ð¥¤¥È<br/>\n1000 times since my Japanese 121 class 12 years ago,<br/>\nit&#39;s entirely possible that 10% of the time I&#39;d simply<br/>\nblank when looking at it. More common, however, is<br/>\nfrustration when seeing a word I use daily in hiragana<br/>\nor kanji, but spending a full minute to figure it out<br/>\nbecause someone wrote it in katakana. Even though I<br/>\nused to live within a 2 minute walk of it, if I<br/>\nsaw¡¡¥è¥è¥®¥³¥¦¥¨¥ó¡¡on a sign, it&#39;d take me forever<br/>\nto figure out it was the Âå¡¹ÌÚ¸ø±à next to¡¡ÌÀ¼£¿ÀµÜ<br/>\nwhere I used to walk my dogs. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo use an example in English--I don&#39;t have to sound<br/>\nout &quot;C-e-n-t-r-a-l P-a-r-k&quot; to get a famous park in<br/>\nNew York--I just read the words &quot;Central&quot; and &quot;Park&quot;.<br/>\nSimilarly, I don&#39;t have to stop and sound out<br/>\n&quot;¤è¤è¤®¤³¤¦¤¨¤ó¡Éor &quot;Âå¡¹ÌÚ¸ø±à&quot;, but I do have to<br/>\nstop with ¥è¥è¥®¥³¥¦¥¨¥ó. As I said, it&#39;s not an issue<br/>\nof being unfamiliar with the katakana characters--I<br/>\nuse them daily. I simply have some sort of &quot;block&quot;<br/>\nwith katakana, especially when I see a word I don&#39;t<br/>\nimmediately recognize. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my wife laughs at me all the time for it. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Can anyone expand on the cannon <br/>\n&gt;theory though? Sounds interesting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I had looked into this several months ago (the use or lack thereof of <br/>\n&gt;Tokugawa cannon at Sekigahara).<br/>\n&gt;The Governor-general of Nagasaki (who was also in charge of Kioesjoe, where <br/>\n&gt;Adam&#39;s ship De Liefde landed) sent a Jesuit to inspect and inventory the <br/>\n&gt;ship. Among other things, they found 500 muskets and 19 (or 18, depending <br/>\n&gt;on the account) bronze guns (cannons). Ieyasu took the guns and cannon <br/>\n&gt;after his third interview with Adams. A later Jesuit account states that it <br/>\n&gt;was the 19 guns that provided the margin of victory at Sekigahara. However, <br/>\n&gt;none of Adam&#39;s letters mention the cannon being used and (aside from a <br/>\n&gt;short mention in one of Tony&#39;s Osprey samurai books) this was the only <br/>\n&gt;mention of the Tokugawa forces using cannon at Sekigahara I could find <br/>\n&gt;(although it&#39;s well documented that Ishida used several). I&#39;ve never seen <br/>\n&gt;them mentioned in a Japanese source. Since the Jesuits were known to slant <br/>\n&gt;history for their own purposes, my opinion is that the account of the <br/>\n&gt;cannon being used was fabricated to show the &#39;menace&#39; of Protestant traders <br/>\n&gt;in Japan.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!

I did not think this to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be true, but another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friend said that before Adams arrived they were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using arquebus, and that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Adams had introduced the flintlock. Can someone set<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me straight please?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nope. The flintlock was introduced in Europe around<br/>\n&gt;1630<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From Wiki (though I hate to use them):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;&quot;Flintlock&quot; is the general term for any firearm based<br/>\n&gt;on the flintlock mechanism. The type is now obsolete.<br/>\n&gt;Introduced about 1630, it rapidly replaced earlier<br/>\n&gt;types, such as the matchlock and wheellock, and<br/>\n&gt;continued in common use for over two centuries,<br/>\n&gt;replaced by cap and cartridge-based systems. The last<br/>\n&gt;major use of flintlocks in the Americas occurred in<br/>\n&gt;the first years of the American Civil War; however, a<br/>\n&gt;few guns of this type are still manufactured for black<br/>\n&gt;powder enthusiasts.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flintlock\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flintlock</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve read that some of the cannon from the ship Adams<br/>\n&gt;arrived on were used at Sekigahara, but I don&#39;t recall<br/>\n&gt;if this is myth or fact. However, I&#39;ve never heard of<br/>\n&gt;them being a decisive factor in any way. No other guns<br/>\n&gt;from the ship would have made a difference, as the<br/>\n&gt;Japanese had plenty themselves already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tony, any more info on the cannon, Mr. Sekigahara?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Tired of spam?

It is understood that many of the writers hold degrees in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Japanese history. That being said it is also true that many of us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t. Does that make us somehow unworthy of comment or do you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simply derive pleasure in the belittlement of others?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As the moderator and owner, let it be known right now that I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;care about &quot;feelings&quot;. Anyone who wants warm fuzzies and emotional<br/>\n&gt;coddling can feel free to join this group:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/oprah/\">http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/oprah/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as I can tell, there are a few things at work here on this<br/>\n&gt;list. First, the people who have been here the longest and still post<br/>\n&gt;frequently all have known eachother for a few years now. Some of us<br/>\n&gt;have even met in real life. Since we are the &quot;in&quot; crowd (being<br/>\n&gt;moderators and/or people who are in with the moderator crowd) we tend<br/>\n&gt;to not feel the need to &quot;self-edit&quot; our posts for the emotional<br/>\n&gt;security of others. We play rough. Another thing at play here is that<br/>\n&gt;most of the oldbies here are 1. guys, 2. guys who don&#39;t particularly<br/>\n&gt;worry about offending others, and 3. Quite independent, fairly<br/>\n&gt;cynical, and don&#39;t mince words.  Some people take this as being<br/>\n&gt;insulting or being an outright attack on them. It isn&#39;t.  We are a<br/>\n&gt;sarcastic bunch, but a pretty cool group once you get to know us,<br/>\n&gt;unless you are the sensitive type that feels that sarcasm is always<br/>\n&gt;mean and nasty. Don&#39;t expect us to put on velvet kid gloves when we<br/>\n&gt;post. I can&#39;t type with gloves anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Remember rule #4, which should have been read when anyone joins the list:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>\n&gt;personally. While we won&#39;t allow personal insults, you<br/>\n&gt;must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>\n&gt;especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>\n&gt;is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>\n&gt;sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>\n&gt;whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>\n&gt;personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with<br/>\n&gt;what is commonly known and accepted as history,<br/>\n&gt;then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath<br/>\n&gt;of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Some people may be insulted by this post and leave. Oh well. Don&#39;t let<br/>\n&gt;  the door hit you on the way out, or strain your finger clicking the<br/>\n&gt;&#39;leave this group&#39; button, or whatever. For the rest of you who aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;too sensitive to the written word, keep on posting, keep on asking<br/>\n&gt;questions, and keep in mind that sarcasm is just because it is funny,<br/>\n&gt;it isn&#39;t an attack, and a lot of the time, you may think you are being<br/>\n&gt;attacked when all it is is just a straight answer. People here don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;tend to wrap the truth in a warm silk blanket, with perfume and roses.<br/>\n&gt;Sometimes we hit bludgeon you with it. I understand that some people<br/>\n&gt;are touchy feely, and I have to put up with that in the real world.<br/>\n&gt;But this isn&#39;t the real world, this is MY world. That&#39;s what us<br/>\n&gt;in-group people have the perrogative to do. Consider it some minor<br/>\n&gt;hazing in order to get into the fraternity (although there are women<br/>\n&gt;too). I am not PC, and I could give a rat&#39;s ass about being PC. Put up<br/>\n&gt;with the hazing long enough, and you might find you accidentaly<br/>\n&gt;learned something. And after a while, you too may end up in the in<br/>\n&gt;crowd, and sit with us at the cool table in the cafeteria.<br/>\n&gt;You have been warned, fortunately or unfortunately (depending on your<br/>\n&gt;level of moral indignation) this is the way this place is run, so if<br/>\n&gt;you can handle it, you are super kewl. If not, Ted Nugent is<br/>\n&gt;dissapointed in you. And maybe I am too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And, for the record: I have only banned one person EVER for being<br/>\n&gt;combatitive, and that was because they were emotionaly erratic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And maybe most importantly, don&#39;t forget who you are dealing with:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/e2fck\">http://tinyurl.com/e2fck</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!

First, the people who have been here the longest and still post<br/>\nfrequently all have known eachother for a few years now. Some of us<br/>\nhave even met in real life. Since we are the &quot;in&quot; crowd (being<br/>\nmoderators and/or people who are in with the moderator crowd) we tend<br/>\nto not feel the need to &quot;self-edit&quot; our posts for the emotional<br/>\nsecurity of others. We play rough. Another thing at play here is that<br/>\nmost of the oldbies here are 1. guys, 2. guys who don&#39;t particularly<br/>\nworry about offending others, and 3. Quite independent, fairly<br/>\ncynical, and don&#39;t mince words.  Some people take this as being<br/>\ninsulting or being an outright attack on them. It isn&#39;t.  We are a<br/>\nsarcastic bunch, but a pretty cool group once you get to know us,<br/>\nunless you are the sensitive type that feels that sarcasm is always<br/>\nmean and nasty. Don&#39;t expect us to put on velvet kid gloves when we<br/>\npost. I can&#39;t type with gloves anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nRemember rule #4, which should have been read when anyone joins the list:<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>\npersonally. While we won&#39;t allow personal insults, you<br/>\nmust be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>\nespecially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>\nis infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>\nsarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>\nwhine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>\npersonally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>\nwhat is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>\nthen back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>\nof the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people may be insulted by this post and leave. Oh well. Don&#39;t let<br/>\n the door hit you on the way out, or strain your finger clicking the<br/>\n&#39;leave this group&#39; button, or whatever. For the rest of you who aren&#39;t<br/>\ntoo sensitive to the written word, keep on posting, keep on asking<br/>\nquestions, and keep in mind that sarcasm is just because it is funny,<br/>\nit isn&#39;t an attack, and a lot of the time, you may think you are being<br/>\nattacked when all it is is just a straight answer. People here don&#39;t<br/>\ntend to wrap the truth in a warm silk blanket, with perfume and roses.<br/>\nSometimes we hit bludgeon you with it. I understand that some people<br/>\nare touchy feely, and I have to put up with that in the real world.<br/>\nBut this isn&#39;t the real world, this is MY world. That&#39;s what us<br/>\nin-group people have the perrogative to do. Consider it some minor<br/>\nhazing in order to get into the fraternity (although there are women<br/>\ntoo). I am not PC, and I could give a rat&#39;s ass about being PC. Put up<br/>\nwith the hazing long enough, and you might find you accidentaly<br/>\nlearned something. And after a while, you too may end up in the in<br/>\ncrowd, and sit with us at the cool table in the cafeteria.<br/>\nYou have been warned, fortunately or unfortunately (depending on your<br/>\nlevel of moral indignation) this is the way this place is run, so if<br/>\nyou can handle it, you are super kewl. If not, Ted Nugent is<br/>\ndissapointed in you. And maybe I am too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, for the record: I have only banned one person EVER for being<br/>\ncombatitive, and that was because they were emotionaly erratic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe most importantly, don&#39;t forget who you are dealing with:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/e2fck\">http://tinyurl.com/e2fck</a></div>",

For instance, if I see &quot; èªÆ¤&quot; (Arigatou)<br/>\nin hiragana, I just read it, as easily as an English<br/>\nword, since it&#39;s normally written in hiragana and I<br/>\nrecognize it.

Both write ika in katakana usually.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Hirai says is &quot;generally&quot; correct, katakana is<br/>\nusually reserved for words originating outside of the<br/>\nJapanese language in modern usage. However, this isn&#39;t<br/>\na hard and fast rule by any means, and frequently in<br/>\nadvertising, price tags, signs, etc. you will see<br/>\nthings written in kanji, hiragana, katakana, and<br/>\nromaji with no rhyme or reason. There&#39;s nothing wrong<br/>\nwith writing Ika in katakana as opposed to hiragana. I<br/>\nsuppose you could use the kanji, too, though I think<br/>\neven most Japanese would be surprised to see it. If<br/>\nyou were writing in a letter to your aunt that you ate<br/>\nsome fine yari-ika at the local sushiya, you&#39;d likely<br/>\nuse hiragana; however, there&#39;s no requirement for you<br/>\nto do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nFunnily enough, the sushiya I go to usually has the<br/>\nspecials up on the blackboard. Being katakana impaired<br/>\nlike I am (I simply DESPISE it), I spent 10 minutes<br/>\ntrying to figure out what &quot;kashio&quot; was...until it<br/>\ndawned on me that one of the specials was hon-katsuo.<br/>\nD&#39;oh!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
