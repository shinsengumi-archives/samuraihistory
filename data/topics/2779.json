            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1942070589\">December 7, 2003<br/>\n By KEN BELSON <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTOKYO - The climax of the new film &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is no<br/>\nordinary fight scene: It is a coda to Japan&#39;s medieval past<br/>\nand a nod to its enduring fighting spirit. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a dramatic battle, the leader of a group of rebel<br/>\nholdouts commits ritual suicide rather than surrender in<br/>\nshame to the well-armed and newly Westernized Japanese<br/>\nArmy. The victors, awed by the rebels&#39; bravery, bow in<br/>\nreverence. Though they now wear Prussian-style uniforms,<br/>\nthey remain true to the samurais&#39; unspoken code of Bushido.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe film takes place in the late 1870&#39;s, when Japan was<br/>\nabandoning its feudal society and industrializing, yet the<br/>\nsame tug of war between preserving tradition and opening<br/>\nJapan to the world persists today. Even as Japan is about<br/>\nto commit troops in Iraq, sending its military abroad for<br/>\nthe first time since World War II, the tension between old<br/>\nways and modern life is evident. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie, though fictional, reminds us that while the<br/>\nsamurai are gone, many of their values are still part of<br/>\nthe fabric of Japanese society. Though outsiders - and many<br/>\nJapanese - exaggerate the resonance of this mix of<br/>\nallegiance, self-control and shame, the social structure<br/>\nthat nurtures these values has resisted everything from the<br/>\nAmerican occupation to encroaching globalization. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hierarchy is still part of everyday life in Japan,&quot; said<br/>\nSheldon M. Garon, a professor of history at Princeton<br/>\nUniversity and author of &quot;Molding Japanese Minds&quot;<br/>\n(Princeton University Press, 1997). &quot;It&#39;s in every<br/>\nrelationship, whether it&#39;s a company, college or otherwise.<br/>\nThe basic organizational structure is remarkably<br/>\nresilient.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAmerican society may celebrate initiative and reward<br/>\nupstarts, but most Japanese still define themselves by<br/>\ntheir affiliations and their ranking in these groups. The<br/>\nsamurai did not invent the system; they were just ardent<br/>\nfollowers of it. But their fervor has become lore in Japan,<br/>\nwhere &quot;salarymen&quot; are compared to warriors, baseball teams<br/>\nare like armies and students cramming for exams wear<br/>\nheadbands like kamikaze pilots. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe flip side is the shame in letting down one&#39;s boss,<br/>\ncoach or teacher. &quot;The Japanese ethical code consists of<br/>\nthree main pillars: obligation, shame and the environment<br/>\nthat surrounds people,&quot; said Shinichi Yanaka, a professor<br/>\nat Japan Women&#39;s University and a specialist in Bushido,<br/>\nthe samurai&#39;s code. &quot;To do something bad in Japan does not<br/>\nonly mean breaking the rules but also doing something that<br/>\nsociety does not permit.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis system of social checks and balances was heavily<br/>\nrefined during the shoguns&#39; rule from 1600 to 1868. The<br/>\ncircles people moved in and the roles they performed were<br/>\nfar more rigidly defined than today, and the penalties for<br/>\nfailure were often crueler, including banishment and death<br/>\nby sword. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe arrival of the Americans and the industrialization they<br/>\nushered in threatened the system and the ruling class that<br/>\nlong benefited from it. Within two decades - the time frame<br/>\nfor &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; - Japan&#39;s industrialists and their<br/>\nWestern backers all but replaced that status quo. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the samurai spirit and the precepts of Bushido made a<br/>\ncomeback in the 1930&#39;s as Japan&#39;s military prepared the<br/>\nnation for war. The kamikaze pilots, who defended the honor<br/>\nof Japan and the emperor by turning their airplanes into<br/>\nmissiles, were the most fanatical expression of this<br/>\nthinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe sentimental attachment to the samurai code runs deep.<br/>\nJapanese form hundreds of relationships based on deep and<br/>\noften subtle obligations to one&#39;s company, school or sports<br/>\nteams. And with those obligations comes the shame in not<br/>\nmeeting them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter World War II, workers began to see themselves as<br/>\ntoiling not for money but for the honor of serving their<br/>\ncorporate masters, and helped turn Japan into an economic<br/>\ngiant. During the economy&#39;s 10-year slide, though,<br/>\nthousands of businessmen have killed themselves for letting<br/>\ndown co-workers, companies and families. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;After the war, people thought their companies were their<br/>\nfamily and decided to be loyal to the company,&quot; said Eiichi<br/>\nMotono, a professor at Waseda University who studies<br/>\nJapan&#39;s industrial development. &quot;People who did not work<br/>\nfor companies were considered heretics, and those who<br/>\nfailed to keep up with their business were looked down on.<br/>\nThat is why people commit suicide in today&#39;s stagnant<br/>\neconomy.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIncreasingly, Japanese are questioning their romance with<br/>\nthe samurai past, even as many others cling to the old ways<br/>\nand lament the decline in the lifetime employment system<br/>\nand other cornerstones of postwar Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing is certain, though: No matter how strong the<br/>\npressure for cultural change, the intertwining code of<br/>\nobligation and shame that has grown over centuries will not<br/>\nunravel easily. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/07/weekinreview/07BELS.html?\">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/07/weekinreview/07BELS.html?</a><br/>\nex=1071957197&ei=1&en=7299c384a31e81b9</div>",
