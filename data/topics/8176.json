They were living in <br/>\nthe Honjo area of Tokyo (Old Edo), at least in 1858 - I can&#39;t go back <br/>\nfurther yet.  I know they were/are Buddhist, but don&#39;t know what <br/>\nsect.  I can study that to see how to ask my aunt that question, <br/>\nthough.  As a Christian, I have a general knowledge of Buddhism, but <br/>\nnot a specific knowledge of its history in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Mon - Thanks for explaining the variations in how kamon have <br/>\ndeveloped- I will need to ask my aunt or other surviving family <br/>\nmembers if a family mon still exists.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. &quot;Official&quot; Names - Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Hatamoto - I knew who they were as a group, but I&#39;ll work with my <br/>\naunt to get more family information.  I have one generation of <br/>\nofficial Japanese family registry - perhaps there is a way to get <br/>\nother older ones (they are quite delicate and elegant pieces of <br/>\npaper!).

My great-great-<br/>\n&gt; grandfather was a Hatamoto Samurai who had a rank/reward/status of<br/>\n&gt; 1500 koku.  The family name is Shimada.  His given name is Sugo.<br/>\n&gt; His other name(perhaps imani?) is Naoaki.  I have independently<br/>\n&gt; confirmed all the kanji characters in the name translation<br/>\n&gt; except &quot;Sugo&quot;.  The first kanji is &quot;su&quot;, but the second one (&quot;go&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; is the best guess of the translator.  Sugo Shimada served in the<br/>\n&gt; early 1800&#39;s in the Edo (Tokyo) area, likely in/near Honjo.  He had<br/>\n&gt; a son (Nobushi Naoharu Shimada) born in 1858, who served under<br/>\n&gt; General Nogi.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My questions are:<br/>\n&gt; 1.  What additional resources (beyond this very helpful site) are<br/>\n&gt; recommended for this type of researching?  I&#39;ve done extensive web<br/>\n&gt; browsing and have begun to get some books.<br/>\nTry the Japanese American History Archives in San Francisco<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Today, Shimada is a relatively common surname in Japan.  In the<br/>\n&gt; Samurai days, was there only one Shimada clan, or perhaps one<br/>\n&gt; Shimada clan per city/area?  I don&#39;t know how unique the name was<br/>\n&gt; during the Samaurai period.  I have read that this surname is<br/>\n&gt; contained in ancient Japanese family name records.  If there is any<br/>\n&gt; Samurai history about the Shimada family, and if there is some sort<br/>\n&gt; of connection between &quot;those&quot; Shimada&#39;s and my family, I would love<br/>\n&gt; to learn about it.<br/>\nShimada was not uncommon back then either, part of the problem is you  <br/>\nwill need the kanji, and since everybody from Edo was from somewhere  <br/>\nelse you&#39;ll want clues to the home province, family temple? sect of  <br/>\nBuddhism?<br/>\n&gt; 3.  Is there a kamon associated with the Shimada family/clan?  Where<br/>\n&gt; might I look for a copy of it?  I have not found it among the<br/>\n&gt; samurai-archives and other helpful web sites.<br/>\nYes, many, but there will be families that used mon not associated  <br/>\nwith the name, cousins that used the mon but not the last name, and  <br/>\nunrelated families that used it for unknown reasons. May be hard to  <br/>\npin down until you know for sure where you&#39;re family is from<br/>\n&gt; 4.  Can someone confirm what the second names (Naoaki and Naoharu)<br/>\n&gt; typically represent for Samurai, especially in a society where many<br/>\n&gt; had only one or two names at that time?  Were their names associated<br/>\n&gt; with the Samurai coming of age ceremony, or perhaps names given to<br/>\n&gt; them after their deaths?  I&#39;m just not clear about that.<br/>\nProbably was custom in this family to have a NAO-something as head of  <br/>\nthe family, thus all male children (at least the ones likely to  <br/>\nsucceed the father) were given a Nao-something official name, Sugo  <br/>\nand Nobushi were familiar names perhaps used only within the  <br/>\nhousehold, by close family members<br/>\n&gt; 5.  Can a tell anything about the status in society (or other<br/>\n&gt; things) of Sugo Shimada as a Hatamoto in the Edo area with 1500<br/>\n&gt; koku?  Whatever they possessed (and it appeared to have been much),<br/>\n&gt; survived the Meiji restoration, but did not survive the US strategic<br/>\n&gt; bombing campaign during WWII.  The surviving family members were<br/>\n&gt; back to &quot;ground zero&quot; in 1945.<br/>\n1500 is not a bad salary, Hatamoto implies direct vassal of the  <br/>\nShogun, would be pretty cool if you could prove it and would narrow  <br/>\nyour search but then again alot of the Edo records were lost...<br/>\n-t<br/>\nPS geneology sites will likely be more helpful than us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any perspectives would be greatly appreciated,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dave Cain<br/>\n&gt; Cincinnati, Ohio, USA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS<br/>\n&gt; Samurai\tJapan\tJapan airline<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; YAHOO!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-118597704\">I just joined the group.  I&#39;m doing family genealogy research and <br/>\nwill be glad to share any relevant findings.  I recently had a 30-<br/>\nyear old family letter translated between my Japanese aunt and her <br/>\nsister (my deceased mother).  I only speak English.  My great-great-<br/>\ngrandfather was a Hatamoto Samurai who had a rank/reward/status of <br/>\n1500 koku.  The family name is Shimada.  His given name is Sugo.  <br/>\nHis other name(perhaps imani?) is Naoaki.  I have independently <br/>\nconfirmed all the kanji characters in the name translation <br/>\nexcept &quot;Sugo&quot;.  The first kanji is &quot;su&quot;, but the second one (&quot;go&quot;) <br/>\nis the best guess of the translator.  Sugo Shimada served in the <br/>\nearly 1800&#39;s in the Edo (Tokyo) area, likely in/near Honjo.  He had <br/>\na son (Nobushi Naoharu Shimada) born in 1858, who served under <br/>\nGeneral Nogi.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy questions are:<br/>\n1.  What additional resources (beyond this very helpful site) are <br/>\nrecommended for this type of researching?  I&#39;ve done extensive web <br/>\nbrowsing and have begun to get some books.<br/>\n2.  Today, Shimada is a relatively common surname in Japan.  In the <br/>\nSamurai days, was there only one Shimada clan, or perhaps one <br/>\nShimada clan per city/area?  I don&#39;t know how unique the name was <br/>\nduring the Samaurai period.  I have read that this surname is <br/>\ncontained in ancient Japanese family name records.  If there is any <br/>\nSamurai history about the Shimada family, and if there is some sort <br/>\nof connection between &quot;those&quot; Shimada&#39;s and my family, I would love <br/>\nto learn about it.<br/>\n3.  Is there a kamon associated with the Shimada family/clan?  Where <br/>\nmight I look for a copy of it?  I have not found it among the <br/>\nsamurai-archives and other helpful web sites.<br/>\n4.  Can someone confirm what the second names (Naoaki and Naoharu) <br/>\ntypically represent for Samurai, especially in a society where many <br/>\nhad only one or two names at that time?  Were their names associated <br/>\nwith the Samurai coming of age ceremony, or perhaps names given to <br/>\nthem after their deaths?  I&#39;m just not clear about that.<br/>\n5.  Can a tell anything about the status in society (or other <br/>\nthings) of Sugo Shimada as a Hatamoto in the Edo area with 1500 <br/>\nkoku?  Whatever they possessed (and it appeared to have been much), <br/>\nsurvived the Meiji restoration, but did not survive the US strategic <br/>\nbombing campaign during WWII.  The surviving family members were <br/>\nback to &quot;ground zero&quot; in 1945.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny perspectives would be greatly appreciated,<br/>\n<br/>\nDave Cain<br/>\nCincinnati, Ohio, USA</div>",
