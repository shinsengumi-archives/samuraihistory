He was <br/>\na very large and powerful man.  They said that He ultimately provoked <br/>\nthe central government into sending an armada of twenty small <br/>\nwarships in an attempt to force him to pay.  As a gesture of <br/>\ndefience, Tametomo decided to shoot a large, bulbed arrow over the <br/>\nbow of one of the ships, but it struck the wooden hull a few inches <br/>\nabove the waterline instead.  The shot was so powerful that the arrow <br/>\npenetrated both sides of the vessel, creating two gaping holes.  Sea <br/>\nwater poured in and the ship began to sink.  The sight of the warship <br/>\nbeing sunk by a single arrow so frightened the other ships&#39; captains <br/>\nthat they retreated.
