I&#39;d have to say that out of those, Mori <br/>\nMotonari was my favorite - most of it was pretty new to me, and for <br/>\nthe most part it had some excellent acting, but above all else, the <br/>\nmakeup surpasses all the previous drama.  I think they must have <br/>\nadded a little grey or a few wrinkles each episode, making the aging <br/>\nlook so natural.  After it was over, and i went back and watched the <br/>\nfirst few episodes again, i was surprised at how young everyone <br/>\nlooked.  Apparently it was more or less a bomb in Japan, but one of <br/>\nmy favorites.  Hideyoshi would come up #2 for the entertainment value <br/>\nalone - Takenaka Naoto is one of my favorite Japanese actors.  I was <br/>\nalso impressed by Sekigahara at the begining of Tokugawa Sandai, <br/>\nalthough apparently others weren&#39;t as impressed as I was...<br/>\n<br/>\nCEWest</div>",
