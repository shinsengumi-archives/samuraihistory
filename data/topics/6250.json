A connection can be made between the History of Religions <br/>\nand Beliefs and the Ancient Japan, at least regarding the Buddhism, <br/>\ndon&#39;t you think? I have also mentioned it because, ever since I have <br/>\nread my first book by him (his &quot;Shortsided Teenager Diary&quot; - <br/>\napproximated translation), he has become a &quot;role-model&quot; for me. It <br/>\nwas the concept of &quot;encyclopedic knowledge&quot; that he promoted I found <br/>\nmost appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And about swords, I have sooooo infinite more to learn about them <br/>\nuntil I can even begin to grasp the possibility of acquiring one. For <br/>\nthe time being, I just dream...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Respectfully,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gabriel</div>",

My mistake...Thank<br/>\nyou for helping me and tell me what do you think of this site:<br/>\nwww.jidai.jp, although I&#39;m having difficulties at this time buying a<br/>\n300 Euros sword...So the site is just a dream, besides, since I don&#39;t<br/>\ntake any Kendo or any alike, I wouldn&#39;t know what to do with a sword,<br/>\nbut to admire its beauty.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry again, and I hope I have redeemed myself in your eyes :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Respectfully,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gabriel</div>",
