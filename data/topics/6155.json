            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1382009268\">Erg.<br/>\n<br/>\nGents, I was joking about English in subtitles. JOKING, I say!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, I&#39;ll watch whatever movies y&#39;all recommend on the subject, and<br/>\nwould prefer some sort of translation in to the bastard tongue of English,<br/>\nbut I can probably chew through something all in Japanese if I had to.  I<br/>\njust wouldn&#39;t know why people did what they did, but it&#39;s sorta like watching<br/>\nthose Japanese soap operas.  It can be amusing... for a few minutes, if<br/>\n&quot;Desperate housewives&quot; isn&#39;t on at the moment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI sense that Momoyama period might, indeed, be the one I&#39;d find the first<br/>\ninterest in, but only due to the relative safety of knowing a bit about the<br/>\n1550s elsewhere in the European sphere and thus having some safety to flee<br/>\ntoward when cornered on a period.  &quot;Um... I don&#39;t know... um... but the<br/>\nFuggers *were* a very powerful banking family in the Germanies, you know.&quot; <br/>\nSee? Pull out not-very-useful fact and wave it around to distract people<br/>\nwhile you slip the other direction. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Mr. Turnbull is engaging in his own way, I was attracted to a shiny<br/>\nthing, like a magpie, and went burbling into the pre-history of that<br/>\nthoroughly unSamurai-like fellow, Mr. Ming (&quot;The&quot;) and his happy, rollicking<br/>\ndynasty.  Now that we know the ships thing was related to the rise and fall<br/>\nof the eunichs-- and make no mistake, no double entendre there; none<br/>\npossible-- I&#39;m still fascinated about what the heck those crazy Chinese were<br/>\nthinking in 1351 during the whole Red Turban affair, and how it relates to<br/>\n&quot;let&#39;s sink a perfectly good largest fleet in the world in 1433 and turn<br/>\nreally insular.&quot;  A monk, you say, as emporer?  Preposterous. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, then, I shall be chastened to return to the pearl isle to<br/>\nlearn more about how many soldiers you have to provide for every cho of<br/>\nriceland you own (and here I thought, all along, Koko was the name of the<br/>\ngorilla who did the sign language with a cat.  With a CAT! The cat can&#39;t do<br/>\nsign language.  It was a doomed experiment).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of mundane detail brings me to a quick question, perhaps not easily<br/>\nanswered: What did the sandal-bearer and the rain-hat carriers do?  Rain-hat<br/>\ncarrier?  This, from a list on page 9 of Mr. Turnbull&#39;s Samurai (&quot;u&quot; not &quot;a&quot;)<br/>\nArmies: 1550-1615 Osprey book.  No offense to Tony, but this was the only<br/>\noffering from those fine ï¿½5,000 per book fellows available at the Central<br/>\nLibrary, so I took it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve got all these ashigaro carrying all sorts of things, but to have a guy<br/>\nto carry rain hats?  Interesting.  And sandals? Wouldn&#39;t people carry their<br/>\nown? Maybe they were artisans to make/create new ones when old ones wore out<br/>\nor damaged.  Still... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Silk Road School &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silk.road.school@...\">silk.road.school@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Matt -<br/>\n&gt; \tI don&#39;t think anybody else is actually gong to be blatant or direct enough<br/>\n&gt; to recommend Anthony Bryant&#39;s Osprey book on the Samurai of the Tudor<br/>\n&gt; period<br/>\n&gt; (although oddly enough, as you may think, it isn&#39;t titled _exactly_ that),<br/>\n&gt; because Tony&#39;s too ethical (and too proud) to do it and Nate knows him too<br/>\n&gt; well... so I might as well just out and say it.  Good book.  (And I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even know the author was here when I signed onto the list.)  Particularly<br/>\n&gt; interesting to you, I would guess, because of the period it covers - Japan<br/>\n&gt; during Queen Elizabeth&#39;s time (God save her).<br/>\n&gt; \tNow knowing your dramatic background, and knowing that this isn&#39;t your<br/>\n&gt; usual milieu (Pilot Adams, I presume?  -Sorry, that&#39;s a kind of &#39;Shogun&#39;<br/>\n&gt; joke), let me commend to your attention a few films for general &#39;feel&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; None of these is actual history, of course.  But there&#39;s lots (and lots and<br/>\n&gt; LOTS) of crrrap out there, and it&#39;s easy to get lost in delusions based on<br/>\n&gt; bad period drama.  You know how it goes.  (A perfectly pleasant and<br/>\n&gt; intelligent soul recently said here that &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; seemed to be<br/>\n&gt; reasonably historical, for example, provoking uncontrollable fits of<br/>\n&gt; laughter from Tony.)  So here&#39;s some _good_ period drama, by way of<br/>\n&gt; contrast.<br/>\n&gt; ...It&#39;ll be interesting to see how this list goes over on this list, in<br/>\n&gt; fact. (By the way, I have to admit here and now to a sneaking fondness for<br/>\n&gt; the manga of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; (I&#39;ve seen nothing of the anime, so have no<br/>\n&gt; opinion), but let&#39;s say I&#39;ve ...reserved judgement ...on any historical<br/>\n&gt; details I came across in the storyline...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tStuff by Kurosawa Akira (look under &#39;K&#39;, not &#39;A&#39;)<br/>\n&gt; Seven Samurai<br/>\n&gt; Hidden Fortress<br/>\n&gt; \t...both set in the Warring States period (roughly while Gloriana sat the<br/>\n&gt; throne of England)<br/>\n&gt; Yojimbo<br/>\n&gt; Sanjuro<br/>\n&gt; \t...some centuries later - these are bloody hilarious:  and I mean both. <br/>\n&gt; As<br/>\n&gt; I recall, these are set in the mid-1800s.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tStuff by Inagaki Hiroshi (under &#39;I&#39;, not &#39;H&#39;)<br/>\n&gt; Chushingura<br/>\n&gt; ...set about 1700 -the archetypal samurai epic:  the 47 Ronin done on the<br/>\n&gt; scale of &#39;Gone With The Wind&#39; - think of it as the Japanese cultural<br/>\n&gt; equivalent to Thermopylae, the Alamo, the Titanic, and the Easter Uprising<br/>\n&gt; all rolled into one.  This film is long and slow, and it&#39;s hard for a<br/>\n&gt; gaijin<br/>\n&gt; (at least) to keep track of everybody the first time or two through it...<br/>\n&gt; but it&#39;s wonderful for all that.  Many of the shots were taken directly<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; classic woodcuts of the episode.<br/>\n&gt; The Samurai Trilogy<br/>\n&gt; ...a popularised (and fairly implausible) version of the life of Musashi<br/>\n&gt; Miyamoto, author of the Book of Five Rings (or Spheres)... arguably the<br/>\n&gt; greatest of the samurai.  (I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s referred to as &quot;Kensei&quot; in<br/>\n&gt; Japan,<br/>\n&gt; and if someone would give me a more clear definition of that than Harris&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &quot;sword-saint&quot; I would be most grateful.)  Matt, I&#39;ve made the better part<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; a life&#39;s study of this work.  Strong talk from an Arrogant Son-Of-a-Bitch<br/>\n&gt; like me, you may note.  I carry a small copy of the book on me the way some<br/>\n&gt; folks carry a Bible, and I have never exhausted what I can learn from it.<br/>\n&gt; If I ever achieve a fraction of Musashi&#39;s mastery, I will regard myself as<br/>\n&gt; fortunate beyond my deserts.<br/>\n&gt; ...Now don&#39;t expect this trilogy to make a hell of a lot of sense in terms<br/>\n&gt; of sequential plot line unless you&#39;ve read the lengthy book on which it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; based, but it&#39;s beautifully made and it&#39;s packed with a zillion little<br/>\n&gt; period details.  The novel was written and serialised in the 1930s, and<br/>\n&gt; reflects some of the most impressively developed virgin/whore dichotomy<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; ever seen anywhere.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tNow then:  if Kitsuno (the list-owner:  a Mysterious Figure with whom I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never exchanged a post:  some say he&#39;s really a fox spirit), or Tony, Nate,<br/>\n&gt; Dean or any of you other elitist, ASOB lot have some suggestions I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; missed, I&#39;d be only too happy for the recommendation.  I&#39;ve just about got<br/>\n&gt; the ones I&#39;ve listed memorised already.  (I only pray I&#39;m not opening a<br/>\n&gt; floodgate of raving fandom.)<br/>\n&gt; \tGereg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!

(A perfectly pleasant and<br/>\nintelligent soul recently said here that &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; seemed to be<br/>\nreasonably historical, for example, provoking uncontrollable fits of<br/>\nlaughter from Tony.)  So here&#39;s some _good_ period drama, by way of<br/>\ncontrast.<br/>\n...It&#39;ll be interesting to see how this list goes over on this list, in<br/>\nfact. (By the way, I have to admit here and now to a sneaking fondness for<br/>\nthe manga of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; (I&#39;ve seen nothing of the anime, so have no<br/>\nopinion), but let&#39;s say I&#39;ve ...reserved judgement ...on any historical<br/>\ndetails I came across in the storyline...)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tStuff by Kurosawa Akira (look under &#39;K&#39;, not &#39;A&#39;)<br/>\nSeven Samurai<br/>\nHidden Fortress<br/>\n\t...both set in the Warring States period (roughly while Gloriana sat the<br/>\nthrone of England)<br/>\nYojimbo<br/>\nSanjuro<br/>\n\t...some centuries later - these are bloody hilarious:  and I mean both.  As<br/>\nI recall, these are set in the mid-1800s.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tStuff by Inagaki Hiroshi (under &#39;I&#39;, not &#39;H&#39;)<br/>\nChushingura<br/>\n...set about 1700 -the archetypal samurai epic:  the 47 Ronin done on the<br/>\nscale of &#39;Gone With The Wind&#39; - think of it as the Japanese cultural<br/>\nequivalent to Thermopylae, the Alamo, the Titanic, and the Easter Uprising<br/>\nall rolled into one.  This film is long and slow, and it&#39;s hard for a gaijin<br/>\n(at least) to keep track of everybody the first time or two through it...<br/>\nbut it&#39;s wonderful for all that.  Many of the shots were taken directly from<br/>\nclassic woodcuts of the episode.<br/>\nThe Samurai Trilogy<br/>\n...a popularised (and fairly implausible) version of the life of Musashi<br/>\nMiyamoto, author of the Book of Five Rings (or Spheres)... arguably the<br/>\ngreatest of the samurai.  (I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s referred to as &quot;Kensei&quot; in Japan,<br/>\nand if someone would give me a more clear definition of that than Harris&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;sword-saint&quot; I would be most grateful.)  Matt, I&#39;ve made the better part of<br/>\na life&#39;s study of this work.  Strong talk from an Arrogant Son-Of-a-Bitch<br/>\nlike me, you may note.  I carry a small copy of the book on me the way some<br/>\nfolks carry a Bible, and I have never exhausted what I can learn from it.<br/>\nIf I ever achieve a fraction of Musashi&#39;s mastery, I will regard myself as<br/>\nfortunate beyond my deserts.<br/>\n...Now don&#39;t expect this trilogy to make a hell of a lot of sense in terms<br/>\nof sequential plot line unless you&#39;ve read the lengthy book on which it&#39;s<br/>\nbased, but it&#39;s beautifully made and it&#39;s packed with a zillion little<br/>\nperiod details.  The novel was written and serialised in the 1930s, and<br/>\nreflects some of the most impressively developed virgin/whore dichotomy I&#39;ve<br/>\never seen anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow then:  if Kitsuno (the list-owner:  a Mysterious Figure with whom I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever exchanged a post:  some say he&#39;s really a fox spirit), or Tony, Nate,<br/>\nDean or any of you other elitist, ASOB lot have some suggestions I&#39;ve<br/>\nmissed, I&#39;d be only too happy for the recommendation.  I&#39;ve just about got<br/>\nthe ones I&#39;ve listed memorised already.  (I only pray I&#39;m not opening a<br/>\nfloodgate of raving fandom.)<br/>\n\tGereg</div>",
