In feudal times, the <br/>\nTokaido (the Eastern Sea Road) was the highway traveled between the <br/>\nold imperial capital, Kyoto, where the emperor lived, and Tokyo, <br/>\nwhere the shogun lived. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Our tours do things that people couldn&#39;t do on their own. They just <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have the opportunity,&quot; said tour representative Nancy <br/>\nCraft. &quot;For example, in Kyoto we visit the home of an international <br/>\ncalligraphy master who is a performance artist.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile in Tokyo, participants will tour Sensoji Temple (also known as <br/>\nAsakusa Kannon Temple) and the Meiji Shrine; they&#39;ll visit the Edo-<br/>\nTokyo Museum and shopping districts, including the trendy Omotesando-<br/>\ndori area.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ll also visit the Tsukiji wholesale fish market and Takashimaya <br/>\ngourmet market.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next stop is Hakone, a resort area known for its mineral baths <br/>\nand home to several museums and an outdoor sculpture garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ll take a cable-car ride to view Mt. Fuji and Owakudani Crater, <br/>\nreturning by boat on Lake Ashi.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will travel along the coast to Ise, visit Ise-Shima National <br/>\nPark and tour Toba&#39;s Mikimoto Pearl Island. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Kyoto, tour participants will stop at Ginkaku-ji (the Silver <br/>\nPavilion), Jodo Temple and several Zen monasteries. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey will attend a private traditional tea ceremony at the Moss <br/>\nTemple (Kokedera), where they will try the art of calligraphy and <br/>\ntour the moss gardens. <br/>\n<br/>\nCost: $5,150 per person, double occupancy ($1,050 single surcharge), <br/>\nincluding accommodations, most meals, train transportation, <br/>\nbilingual guides, admissions and excursions. International airfare <br/>\nis not included.<br/>\n<br/>\nContact: Esprit Travel & Tours, Los Angeles; (800) 377-7481, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.esprittravel.com\">http://www.esprittravel.com</a> .</div>",
