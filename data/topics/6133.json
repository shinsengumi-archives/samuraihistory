And I say that having lived their twice. It&#39;s<br/>\na 2 way road between Japan and the Asian<br/>\nmainland--nobody in their right mind would invade<br/>\nKorea simply to own that....place. If Japan owns it,<br/>\nthey control any Asian movement towards their country,<br/>\nand can move into Asia. Same thing for the Chinese,<br/>\nRussians, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So I snagged Mr. Turnbull&#39;s Osprey book and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Samurai, A Military <br/>\n&gt; History,&quot; also by that same worthy, and found that<br/>\n&gt; the Osprey book <br/>\n&gt; was meaty reading for such a thin tome. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which Osprey book? He&#39;s got about 20 of them. <br/>\n<br/>\n I suspect,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from Turnbull&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; many offerings, that he is an excellent gent to<br/>\n&gt; start with, and then <br/>\n&gt; to branch out when my abundant free time is no<br/>\n&gt; longer taken up by <br/>\n&gt; these books.  Suggestions, anyone?  (Or, if there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a reading list <br/>\n&gt; compiled by some person, kindly direct me to it?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once again: www.samuraiarchives.com<br/>\n<br/>\nOne note of warning about Turnbull: He&#39;s mercurial,<br/>\nand often times concerned with publication for<br/>\npublication&#39;s sake. Much of his newer books are<br/>\nrehashes of things he&#39;d previously written, and some<br/>\nare horribly edited. Many of his older books contain<br/>\nnumerous mistakes, some of which he has later<br/>\ncorrected. Questions have arisen about his &quot;research&quot;<br/>\nin earlier books since they mirror other books by less<br/>\nprolific authors. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a good place to start, and some of his books are<br/>\nfabulous: Samurai Invasion, Samurai Warriors, Samurai<br/>\nWarlords, to name a few. In other ways, he simply<br/>\ncashes in on what he can: Japanese Warfare from 1467;<br/>\nNinja (how can you say that ninja didn&#39;t walk around<br/>\nin black pajamas, then have every picture in the book<br/>\nbe of a skulking sneak in black pajamas?), etc. <br/>\n  <br/>\nMy own recommendations would be:<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge Sansom&#39;s series: dated, some places inaccurate,<br/>\nbut the best overall overview of Japanese history out<br/>\nthere for under $500. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary Berry--Hideyoshi<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony J. Bryant (I&#39;m not his agent, but should be).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo! Mail - 250MB free storage.

I wandered through the history <br/>\nsection of the lovely and art endowed Los Angeles County Central <br/>\nLibrary (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lapl.org/central/art_architecture.html)\">http://www.lapl.org/central/art_architecture.html)</a> which <br/>\nwas organized by country/region, and/or individual, and went from <br/>\nthe tumultous Koreans right into Japan.  One moment, it&#39;s all this <br/>\nnorth-south damn-those-chinese-and-americans kind of talk, the next, <br/>\nthere&#39;s twigs and blossoms and peace.  Well, that&#39;s how it started, <br/>\nbut it soon grew ugly as the section broadened into warfare.  <br/>\nWarfare, art, warfare, art... I understand you can study both, but <br/>\nit seemed a curious mixture to have them interspaced.  There was a <br/>\ntheme here, but I couldn&#39;t quite lay my finger on it. (Of course, <br/>\ngoing back a bit in the Korea section revealed that they, too, <br/>\nshared no love of the Japanese, probably due to the twice a millenia <br/>\ninvasions by those folks.  What is so wonderful about Korea that the <br/>\nJapanese kept invading it?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I snagged Mr. Turnbull&#39;s Osprey book and &quot;Samurai, A Military <br/>\nHistory,&quot; also by that same worthy, and found that the Osprey book <br/>\nwas meaty reading for such a thin tome.  I suspect, from Turnbull&#39;s <br/>\nmany offerings, that he is an excellent gent to start with, and then <br/>\nto branch out when my abundant free time is no longer taken up by <br/>\nthese books.  Suggestions, anyone?  (Or, if there&#39;s a reading list <br/>\ncompiled by some person, kindly direct me to it?)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter picking up those volumes, I wandered some more, and mused on <br/>\nthe fact that someone, somewhere, for some reason completely unknown <br/>\nto me, thinks it important that we preserve the 1964 yellow pages <br/>\nfor Des Moines, Iowa.  Else, why have it available for checkout, in <br/>\na library created ugly brown cover, with black lettering?  If only <br/>\nAndrew could see his progeny now, and think, &quot;for this, I ruthlessly <br/>\ncrushed all other steel companies?&quot;  Ah, but the rest of the place! <br/>\nIt was enough to humble your kind author.  I know so very little <br/>\nabout anything.  Soon, I will know a very little about this subject, <br/>\ntoo.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers.</div>",
