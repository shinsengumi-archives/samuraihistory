It is hard to <br/>\ntell from the picture but I would guess that there is a very low <br/>\nchance that it&#39;s a swinging door.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tiny door that you mention is on the right-hand side of the <br/>\npicture. It&#39;s knows as the &quot;nijiri-guchi&quot;. This door is used by guests <br/>\nat the time of the tea itself. You do have to crawl through it, <br/>\nalthough crawl isn&#39;t precisely the right word. It&#39;s more like &quot;slide <br/>\non one&#39;s knees while kneeling&quot;. The difference being that the posture <br/>\nis kept upright when entering a tea house.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe larger door on the left is called the &quot;sadou-guchi&quot;. This is a <br/>\nbigger (but still small) door that is used by the host. It&#39;s used from <br/>\ntime to time to carry things into and out of the tea house. It leads <br/>\ninto a small (as you can imagine) room at the back of the tea house <br/>\nthat holds all of the tools and materials needed to do tea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\noyakata@...</div>",
