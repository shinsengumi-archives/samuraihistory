This again is the condensed version 49 episodes into 7 and a half hours. Taharazaka was done by VAP video company. I&#39;m not sure where it might be available if it still is but I think it was as expensive as the other one. These videos plus many others are available for rent in most big Japanese video stores like Tsutaya. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
