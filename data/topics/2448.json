The 4th Battle of<br/>\nKawanakajima, usually the one considered THE battle,<br/>\ntook place in 1561. Great battle to study, with lots<br/>\nof tactical point-counterpoint, at one point allegedly<br/>\nUesugi Kenshin led a charge into the Takeda<br/>\nheadquarters and swung at Shingen, who parried with<br/>\nhis war-fan (whether this happened or not, it&#39;s been<br/>\nthe subject of much artwork). <br/>\n<br/>\ngo to the Samurai Archives website, I know a better<br/>\ndescription is in there.

What makes this battle more of interest is <br/>\nthat Shingen drew up his battle lines after nightfall and completed manouvers <br/>\nbefore first light. However, what should have been a surprise attack on the <br/>\nunwarry Uesugi was thwarted and instead the Takeda were subjected to the focus <br/>\nof attacks from a well practised tactical development by Kenshin.  Kenshin had <br/>\nbeen made aware of Shingens night movements and had undertaken his own <br/>\nplacements under cover of the same darkness. The Takeda forces came under great <br/>\npresssure but held firm to &quot;win&quot; the day with a loss of around 14000, including <br/>\nmany important family members and generals. The Uesugi losses were similar but <br/>\naccounted for a higher proportion of troops engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is one of a series of books, produced by Bellona [ <br/>\nhttp://ksiegarnia.bellona.pl]and published in Poland - in polish, discussing the background and <br/>\nthe events leading up to the warfare. &quot;Kawanakajima 1561&quot; is well illustrated <br/>\nwith colour artwork, maps and prints in a format similar to Osprey but <br/>\nslightly smaller [160x235] - cosisting of 48 pages of which 8 are in full colour. <br/>\nThe new artwork is reminiscient of Angus McBride&#39;s style [almost identical] with <br/>\nthe figures represented being rather squat and short. The work relies heavily <br/>\non previously work published in Osprey - Turnbull and Bryant - and the red <br/>\nbook Rekishi Series. An ideal book for readers who would find reading Polish <br/>\neasier than English. However, Stephen Turnbull is due to publish an Osprey <br/>\nCampaign Series later this year tittled &quot;Kawanakajima 1553-64&quot;. {truely SRT has been <br/>\nvery busy with the pen this last year!}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n{Here is the AMAZON pre publication notes on this.}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTURNBULL Paperback; November 25 2003; 96 pages; ISBN: 1841765627 Â£12.99<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKawanakajima is unique in history. In the space of 12 years, between 1553 and <br/>\n1564, this valley deep in the mountains of central Japan witnessed no less <br/>\nthan five battles between two of Japan&#39;s greatest warlords. Takeda Shingen and <br/>\nUesugi Kenshin were both descended from great families and were highly skilled <br/>\ntacticians. Both had taken the tonsure and risen to high rank in their <br/>\nrespective Buddhist sects. When Shingen attempted to seize control of Shinano <br/>\nprovince they were set on a collision course. Stephen Turnbull chronicles the see-saw <br/>\nstruggle between two men who epitomize the warrior daimyo from Japan&#39;s <br/>\n&#39;Warring States&#39; period. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContents <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOrigins of the campaigns; Chronology; Opposing Commanders; Opposing Armies; <br/>\nOpposing Plans; The Kawanakajima campaigns (1553, 1555, 1557, 1561, 1564) ; <br/>\nAftermath; The Battlefield Today; Bibliography ; Index<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Kenshin had been made aware of Shingens night movements and had undertaken his own placements under cover of the same darkness. The Takeda forces came under great presssure but held firm to &quot;win&quot; the day with a loss of around 14000, including many important family members and generals. The Uesugi losses were similar but accounted for a higher proportion of troops engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is one of a series of books, produced by Bellona [ http://ksiegarnia.bellona.pl]and published in Poland - in polish, discussing the background and the events leading up to the warfare. &quot;Kawanakajima 1561&quot; is well illustrated with colour artwork, maps and prints in a format similar to Osprey but slightly smaller [160x235] - cosisting of 48 pages of which 8 are in full colour. The new artwork is reminiscient of Angus McBride&#39;s style [almost identical] with the figures represented being rather squat and short. The work relies heavily on previously work published in Osprey - Turnbull and Bryant - and the red book Rekishi Series. An ideal book for readers who would find reading Polish easier than English. However, Stephen Turnbull is due to publish an Osprey Campaign Series later this year tittled &quot;Kawanakajima 1553-64&quot;. {truely SRT has been very busy with the pen this last year!}<br/>\n<br/>\n{Here is the AMAZON pre publication notes on this.}<br/>\n<br/>\nTURNBULL Paperback; November 25 2003; 96 pages; ISBN: 1841765627 Â£12.99<br/>\n<br/>\nKawanakajima is unique in history. In the space of 12 years, between 1553 and 1564, this valley deep in the mountains of central Japan witnessed no less than five battles between two of Japan&#39;s greatest warlords. Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin were both descended from great families and were highly skilled tacticians. Both had taken the tonsure and risen to high rank in their respective Buddhist sects. When Shingen attempted to seize control of Shinano province they were set on a collision course. Stephen Turnbull chronicles the see-saw struggle between two men who epitomize the warrior daimyo from Japan&#39;s &#39;Warring States&#39; period. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContents <br/>\n<br/>\nOrigins of the campaigns; Chronology; Opposing Commanders; Opposing Armies; Opposing Plans; The Kawanakajima campaigns (1553, 1555, 1557, 1561, 1564) ; Aftermath; The Battlefield Today; Bibliography ; Index<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
