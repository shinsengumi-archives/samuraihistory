            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1182106449\">Hi,<br/>\n    firstly i am after literature- published workd, or websites- containing <br/>\ninformation on the life of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1680-1709). The fifth <br/>\nTokugawa Shogun. I am especially concerned with the protection of dogs that <br/>\nhis mother inspired, as well as the Urban culture during, and preceeding, <br/>\nthe Genroku Era (as well as any other information on this area, of which i <br/>\nam particularly ignorant). Lastly, i would like to look into the Shohei <br/>\nacademy, of which Tsunayoshi was apparently the patron. Although, again, i <br/>\nhave no idea how long he remained appointed to this position.<br/>\n    Secondly, and less specific;- Can anyone inform me as to whether ancient <br/>\nAssyria would have contained modern Baghdad.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any, and all help would be accepted with my full thanks<br/>\nMiles R Dewey<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe the first to hear what&#39;s new at MSN - sign up to our free newsletters! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.msn.co.uk/newsletters\">http://www.msn.co.uk/newsletters</a></div>",
