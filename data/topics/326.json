            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1597855386\">Hello all,<br/>\n This is a personal response to the mail I saw with the article from the <br/>\nCanadian newspaper...I am British, first off and truly resent the statements <br/>\ndecrying the U.K.&#39;s involvement in the &#39;clean up&#39; operation and any events <br/>\npursuant to the attacks. My question is just what else can we do in Britain <br/>\nto aid the U.S. at this time? We are sending Blood, firemen, police, and <br/>\nothers with knowledge of how to help in the aftermath of a bomb strike  <br/>\n(terrorist activity), our Prime Minister has declared that we will stand <br/>\nfirmly behind any plans the U.S. has to seek &#39;vengeance&#39; on the guilty party <br/>\nhere...But as a country we are no where near rich enough to supply the <br/>\namounts that are needed to truly help. We are doing all that we can to aid <br/>\nthe States at this time but could never supply aid equal to that given by the <br/>\nU.S. and others in the Second World War. Here is the point...The U.S. has <br/>\nalways been looked upon as the &#39;saviour of the free world&#39;, a kind of &#39;big <br/>\nbrother&#39; with the power to help in nearly all situations. Some may say that <br/>\nit is that level of involvement that has made the U.S. the target for the <br/>\nterrorist parties. My heart truly goes out to all involved in this atrocity, <br/>\n(see my previous post) But the implication in the article is that we are <br/>\nstanding idly by while the U.S. is attacked. This cannot be farther from the <br/>\ntruth. If the point of the e-mail was to show the stupidity of some reporters <br/>\non the case then my points should be disregarded, sorry. But the world does <br/>\nnot need any more rift building and division, blame, or guilt than is already <br/>\npresent. Articles like this sow discord and in my opinion should not be <br/>\nposted on an international forum like this one. We need to join together if <br/>\nthere is any hope in finding and dealing with the guilty here....We cannot <br/>\neasily do this if people continually lay the guilt for it on countries that <br/>\nare genuinly trying to help clear up the situation. Please, take care with <br/>\nthe articles allowed to be shown here. It is not the U.S. against the world, <br/>\nbut the world against the mindless scum willing to commit these attacks.<br/>\n Sorry if I cause offense here...That is not my intention. Once again, my <br/>\nheartfelt condolences goes to all those who have suffered as a result of this.<br/>\nNAMU AMIDA BUTSU.<br/>\nBen Sharples<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fifthchamber@...\">fifthchamber@...</a></div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-188137673\">Well, none of this is on topic, but I was forwarded the following, <br/>\nsomething I never really thought about:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;America: The Good Neighbor. <br/>\n&gt;Widespread but only partial news coverage was given <br/>\n&gt;recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from <br/>\n&gt;Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television <br/>\n&gt;commentator. What follows is the full text of his <br/>\n&gt;trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record: <br/>\n&gt;&quot;This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the <br/>\n&gt;Americans as the most generous and possibly the least <br/>\n&gt;appreciated people on all the earth. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and <br/>\n&gt;Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the <br/>\n&gt;Americans who poured in billions of dollars and <br/>\n&gt;forgave other billions in debts. None of these <br/>\n&gt;countries is today paying even the interest on its <br/>\n&gt;remaining debts to the United States. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, <br/>\n&gt;it was the Americans who propped it up, and their <br/>\n&gt;reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets <br/>\n&gt;of Paris. I was there. I saw it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the <br/>\n&gt;United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 <br/>\n&gt;American communities were flattened by tornadoes. <br/>\n&gt;Nobody helped. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped <br/>\n&gt;billions of dollars! into discouraged countries. Now <br/>\n&gt;newspapers in those countries are writing about the <br/>\n&gt;decadent, warmongering Americans. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d like to see just one of those countries that <br/>\n&gt;is gloating over the erosion of the United States <br/>\n&gt;dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country <br/>\n&gt;in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo <br/>\n&gt;Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? <br/>\n&gt;If so, why don&#39;t they fly them? Why do all the <br/>\n&gt;International lines except Russia fly American Planes? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Why does no other land on earth even consider putting <br/>\n&gt;a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese <br/>\n&gt;technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German <br/>\n&gt;technocracy, and you get automobiles. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;You talk about American technocracy, and you find <br/>\n&gt;men on the moon -! not once, but several times - <br/>\n&gt;and safely home again. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs <br/>\n&gt;right in the store window for everybody to look at. <br/>\n&gt;Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. <br/>\n&gt;They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless <br/>\n&gt;they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American <br/>\n&gt;dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;When the railways of France, Germany and India <br/>\n&gt;were breaking down through age, it was the Americans <br/>\n&gt;who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and <br/>\n&gt;the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an <br/>\n&gt;old caboose. Both are still broke. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced <br/>\n&gt;to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name <br/>\n&gt;me even one time when someone else raced to the <br/>\n&gt;Americans in trouble? I don&#39;t think there was outside <br/>\n&gt;help even during the San Francisco earthquake. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I&#39;m one <br/>\n&gt;Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get <br/>\n&gt;kicked around. They will come out of this thing with <br/>\n&gt;their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled <br/>\n&gt;to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating <br/>\n&gt;over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of <br/>\n&gt;those.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; As a member of the U.S. Military, but most importantly<br/>\n&gt; as an American, Thank you.
