Do you have any suggestions where to<br/>\nstart?<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nGyula Sofi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2011/9/1 bbradf3021 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BBradford1973@...\">BBradford1973@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do not think it has been mentioned here, but for a few months my book,<br/>\n&gt; Hideyoshi&#39;s Korean Invasion, has been available.
