            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-104813156\">Hi Ezequiel, <br/>\n <br/>\nThis is from a Japanese sword discussion list on a friday afternoon,<br/>\nwhen it was very very quiet :-) , I thought you might find it<br/>\ninteresting. Remember that all the responses are by different people, so<br/>\nthere might be some overlap. <br/>\n <br/>\nQ: Gang, suppose that a Portuguese soldier encountered a Samurai and<br/>\nthey<br/>\nhad a duel / fight back in the 16th cent, which would be more likely to<br/>\nwin ? <br/>\n  <br/>\nDid anything like this ever happen ? Is it documented ?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nA: <br/>\nI have seen this documented somewhere many years back, but can&#39;t recall<br/>\nwhere.  The author felt that a European would win, because the Samurai<br/>\nwas constrained to use certain traditional slashing cuts to certain<br/>\ntraditional striking points, while the European would tend towards<br/>\nthrusts to the chest.  The European fighting style had a far, far<br/>\ngreater reach than the traditional Samurai slashing motion cuts. <br/>\n <br/>\nI recall that Musashi Miyamato was said to take advantage of the<br/>\ntraditional limitations of  striking cuts used by his opponents, and<br/>\nslip in a blow to the groin or two to soften them up.  Definitely in any<br/>\nEuropean&#39;s bag of tricks.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nA: <br/>\nMy friend Akio related to me a story passed on to him by his<br/>\ngrandfather.  According to the story, at the battle of Shimonoseki, a<br/>\nJapanese and an Englishman were fighting.  The Englishman kept jabbing<br/>\nthe Japanese, and the Japanese just stood there.  Suddenly, the<br/>\nEnglishman got in closer, and the Japanese swung his sword one time,<br/>\nending the fight.  <br/>\nI do not know whether this actually happened, just relaying what I was<br/>\ntold, and I am not open to any arguments on this story.<br/>\nGanbatte!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nA:<br/>\na  German guy nailed the japanese officer in  Tsingtao ( spelling ? )<br/>\nduring the ww1....................<br/>\n <br/>\nA:<br/>\nThe person who was better trained would likely win.  Each weapon has<br/>\nadvantages and disadvantages.  Also, don&#39;t discount the thrusting<br/>\npotential of the Japanese blade.  Most will handle more axial loading (<br/>\nfor thrusting) without buckling than the European weapons.  The major<br/>\nadvantage of the European blade is weight and reach, which can be<br/>\ncountered by a parry and rapidly closing the distance between opponents.<br/>\n <br/>\nA: <br/>\nHello All,<br/>\nThere was an emergency room doctor a few years ago who was interested in<br/>\nfencing. he researched injuries that were documented in European duels<br/>\nand found that most ended with both dying due to infection. I would<br/>\nwager that the Samurai Afu spoke of died as well, just a bit later then<br/>\nthe Englishman.<br/>\n <br/>\nI would think that the better warrior would prevail, but as this would<br/>\nchange from one fight to the next there is really no one answer.<br/>\n <br/>\nA:<br/>\nSwords, swordsmen, armour, period, school, strategy, experience...  Any<br/>\nother variables you can think to plug into the equation?  It&#39;s kind of<br/>\nlike asking if throwing a coin off of a building will hurt much.  Well,<br/>\nthrowing a 5p coin off a water shed will make you wonder if an acorn<br/>\nhasn&#39;t just hit you, throwing a 5 ruble coin off of the Parthenon is<br/>\ngoing to hurt a lot more, and a US 1/2 dollar off of the Empire State<br/>\nbuilding would kill just about anything...  <br/>\n <br/>\nNow, back to swords ;-)<br/>\n <br/>\nA:<br/>\nThe short answer: The fellow with the most confidence irrespective of <br/>\n<br/>\nweapon. It is not, and never will be, the weapon that makes the<br/>\ndifference. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would be a lot more attentive to combat with someone who had mastered <br/>\n<br/>\ntheir art and was armed with a rusty lawnmower blade than someone with <br/>\n<br/>\nlesser experience and the best damned sword in the world. Please see the<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nstory of the tea master in D.T. Suzuki, Zen and the Art of Japanese<br/>\nculture, <br/>\n<br/>\nchapters on sword. That is another story that illustrates the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Blue<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I do not have the references, but someone on this list may have them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are reports to the effect that a Frenchman, a master of the<br/>\npointy <br/>\n<br/>\nschool of sword, faced off against a nihonto practitioner in the early<br/>\n20th <br/>\n<br/>\ncentury. The fight ended in about two seconds after the Frenchperson<br/>\nlost <br/>\n<br/>\nhis sword arm and it was all the referee could do to stop the nihonto<br/>\nfellow <br/>\n<br/>\nfrom trimming away other nonessential body parts (or something like<br/>\nthat, <br/>\n<br/>\npardon my paraphrase).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA:<br/>\n<br/>\nHellow all,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I would think the Samurai blade striking a european blade could easily<br/>\nbreak his oppnents sword and I could see the samurai being much quicker.<br/>\nIf this was indeed the case and both man went to hand to hand combat, I<br/>\ncould easily see the samurai with the upper hand. Just a thought <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA: <br/>\n<br/>\nNever forget Miyamoto Musashi and his boat oar!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-P<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA: <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget about a rock in a sox!<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that it is mental training of the person using the sword or <br/>\n<br/>\nwhatever, Having been trained by some very sever Japanese and Okinawan <br/>\n<br/>\nSensei I would give the nod to the Japanese trained samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow,also is it my imagination or do Koto just naturally cut well? Is it <br/>\n<br/>\nthat they were designed for just one purpose (fighting) and this is the <br/>\n<br/>\nreason they cut so well. I have a almost worn out 29 3/4 inch koto <br/>\n<br/>\nblade that just cuts anything. It handles like it is a part of me. So <br/>\n<br/>\nthe question is do Koto blades just naturally handle well because they <br/>\n<br/>\nwere designed for only purpose. Is this why the Japanese prize them? <br/>\n<br/>\nDid the Shinshinto blades give up usage for beauty?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA: <br/>\n<br/>\nRick,<br/>\n<br/>\nSome sword scholars feel that the shinshinto blades became nothing more<br/>\nthan a canvas on which to display the sword smiths art.
