Contact: Satoko Murata<br/>\nJTB USA, Inc.<br/>\n(415) 986-4764<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smurata@...\">smurata@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ridgebackpress.com\">http://www.ridgebackpress.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSAMURAI HISTORY TOUR with Author of ³RYOMA²<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe overthrow of the shogun in 1868 was one of the great events in <br/>\nAsian history. As The Wall Street Journal reports, Sakamoto Ryoma, a <br/>\nleader of the revolution, is the idol of the financial and <br/>\ngovernmental elite in today¹s Japan. Ryoma and his samurai <br/>\ncontemporaries, and the historic cities where the revolution <br/>\nunfolded, are the focus of SAMURAI HISTORY TOUR.<br/>\n<br/>\nRomulus Hillsborough, acclaimed author of RYOMA ­ Life of a <br/>\nRenaissance Samurai, has recently created the tour. ³We will visit <br/>\nold houses and inns, feudal castles, Buddhist temples, sites of <br/>\nbattles and assassinations, villas of feudal lords, museums, statues <br/>\nand gravesites,² says Hillsborough. ³We will view the actual swords <br/>\nthese samurai used, the clothes they wore, and personal possessions <br/>\nthey kept with them during those turbulent and bloody years. I will <br/>\nnarrate the tour in order to share the knowledge I have gained <br/>\nthroughout my travels and research over these past twenty years. By <br/>\nso doing, I hope to bring this fascinating era to life before your <br/>\nvery eyes.²<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tour groups will be small so that the author may share his <br/>\nknowledge and answer questions on a personalized basis. He will also <br/>\nspeak about the history of the destinations on each evening before <br/>\nthe visits. The tours will be operated by Japan Travel Bureau Group <br/>\n(JTB), the world¹s largest travel company. The first tour is <br/>\nscheduled September 15 - 24, 2003.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe price of Samurai History Tour, including roundtrip airfare, most <br/>\nmeals and 8 nights at deluxe or superior hotels and Japanese inns, is <br/>\n$3,950 per person.
