            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-117737235\">Why Kawanakajima? Shingen and Kenshin&#39;s Five Battles<br/>\n<br/>\nSengoku Daimyo Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin are two well known<br/>\nfigures from Japan&#39;s Sengoku period who fought five battles on the<br/>\nKawanakajima plain in Shinano province (Modern day Nagano prefecture)<br/>\nbetween 1553 and 1564. (The fouth battle was depicted in the 1990<br/>\nKadokawa Haruki movie Heaven and Earth) Why did Kawanakajima become<br/>\nthe main battleground for these two warriors? What made Kawanakajima<br/>\nsuch a contested area? I thought I&#39;d tackle this question for my blog<br/>\npost this week. After a combination of poking around and deductive<br/>\nreasoning, I can come up with a few reasons. Although, there is no way<br/>\nto really know which reasons might be correct, a little theoretical<br/>\nguesswork never hurt anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shogun-yashiki.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-kawanakajima-shingen-and-kenshins.html\">http://shogun-yashiki.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-kawanakajima-shingen-and-kenshins.html</a></div>",
