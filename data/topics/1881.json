Some are Aluminium and some are steel, i&#39;ll talk about <br/>\nshapening in a moment. Either way the blade should be taken out of <br/>\nit&#39;s funishings every once in a while for a whole cleaning though <br/>\nmostly leave it as is and do the blade. As to blade care, it should <br/>\nbe rubbed clean with silk or someother non marking cloth before being <br/>\noiled.This will remove any old oil or bits of dirt, dust ect. I know <br/>\nyou can buy various cleaning kits( i don&#39;t remember at the moment <br/>\nwhich is the best oil, though likely rice oil or some such thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter figuring out what type of metal the blade is then you can think <br/>\nabout sharpening. Aluminium you SOULD NOT SHARPEN as it will ruin the <br/>\nblade and cause it to rust very quickly. As for steel if you intened <br/>\nto use it in any sort of combat or otherwise you should get someone <br/>\nto professionaly sharpen it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe you should check with your friend see what they think, some <br/>\nfeel it to be a dishonor to sharpen something that came unsharpend. <br/>\nIt&#39;s likely that they could not have even gotten it to you if it was <br/>\nsharpend, laws about that are very strict and every nihon has to be <br/>\nregistered anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and Wisdom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAtsi <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
