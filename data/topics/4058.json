It wasn&#39;t for keeping the samurai down, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for keeping them &quot;up.&quot; That is, in a society without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any wars, if you have a military class, you have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have some rational or emotional justification for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuing their benefits. Bushido made the samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out to be more than just a soldier, and so attempted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I guess successfully) to justify his existence in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the non-warring period. Kinda like for america, if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we don&#39;t have any perceived military threats, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want to cut military spending. So what does the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; military do? Come up with all the &quot;be all you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be&quot; and &quot;army of one&quot; and &quot;we&#39;re looking for a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good men&quot; advertising campaigns... which glorifies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the military in the public&#39;s eye, and gives it a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose apart from war... namely the bettering of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our citizens by education and experience. Bushido<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made samurai out to be &quot;honorable citizens&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something to that effect...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All sounds about right to me.

I do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the practice of one on one combat existed in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; early samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; period.  Even in the Gempei war many challanges<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were shouted to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on the existing honor system.  Many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai did call out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lineage before a battle.  Although it seems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; silly to us now, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to remember how isolated Japan was from the rest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the world.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had a system of fighting wars that was very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different than any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other...Until the Mongols invaded.  Then the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai began to wise<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up.  &quot;Hey, these Mongols don&#39;t really care about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our family do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My understanding is that the Japanese were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; totally unprepared to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight a war with an organized mongolian military<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; machine.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the samurai were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prepared the second time, and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; preparations/strategic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that followed changed the face of Samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warfare.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Into the Sengoku is when Ashigaru are much more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apparent in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; armies.  Long after the lineage practice had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been proven unwise by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mongols (I know, they were actually Korean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Chinese<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conscripts).  So at this point I can&#39;t see them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing it either.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many years later, after a couple hundred years<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of peace, under the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bushido is crystalized into what we know today.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prior to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peaceful Edo Jidai, much of the &quot;honor sytem&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t based on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high and holy precepts that everyone thinks the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samurai lived by.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was only in the last years of the samurai that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the bushido code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; influence the population.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess, I too get a little sick of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generalizations.  I recently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Kensei.  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; informed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; code.  They were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warriors and role models that were bound by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; honor to better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; society.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They helped everyone gain greater understanding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by standing for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peace, justice, and the American way (well, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t really say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that, but they might as well have).  Upon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hearing this, I could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were good and bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai.  They didn&#39;t all live honorable and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they Bushido code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; affect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; must agree that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had some system of honor.  How else could we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quantify a good or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; samurai?  But it wasn&#39;t &quot;Bushido&quot; persay.  Since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Bushido&quot; did not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist in the Sengoku, it probably wasn&#39;t used to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; keep the troops<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their troops but it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been much more simple and less dubious than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you presume.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Promises of fame and fortune, political status,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; social status,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pride,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and land are other methods that could be used to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain loyalty.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In short, I don&#39;t think that there was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; universal conspiracy by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders of the time, to devise a system to keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a brotha down.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was not the &quot;purpose&quot; of honor or bushido,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; although it (like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else) could be perverted and warped to serve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sinister means.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brandon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kyle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Segall&quot; &lt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Try a little more than Shogun.

The purpose of the advertising <br/>\ncampaigns are to get peopel to join.  You may be right that they <br/>\naren&#39;t completly seperate.  While they may also convince others that <br/>\nthe military is a good thing that is not their primary purpose.  What <br/>\nreally justifies the military is the contingencies we are involved <br/>\nin, the honorable behavior of the men and women who serve, and the <br/>\nfamily members/friends who support the U.S. citizen soldiers in <br/>\nservice.  I don&#39;t believe that congress has ever voted the military a <br/>\npayraise because some constituant wrote their congress person, who <br/>\nwas so completely moved by a commercial.  &quot;Dog gonnit, that Army of <br/>\none thing is pretty snappy.  The military needs more money.  I&#39;m <br/>\nwriting my congressman.&quot;  Supporters of the military have been: those <br/>\nwho have served themselves, those who have family or friends serving, <br/>\nor those who wish they could have served.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not attacking YOU.  You have valid points <br/>\nand I did agree that early Japan may have attempted to justify the <br/>\nsamurai class by changing their role.  You are entitled to an <br/>\nopinion.  In this case, I think I may be closer to the issue and may <br/>\nbe more informed.  I have not based what I told you purely on <br/>\nspeculation.  I know how some of the money is budgeted and why they <br/>\nuse it a certain way.  Any communication may serve multiple purposes <br/>\nbut not all those purposes were the driving factor for creating the <br/>\ncommunication.  You believe that the military advertises to get more <br/>\nmoney.  It doesn&#39;t hurt my feelings that you think that.  In some <br/>\nround about way, the military may get more money.  But the purpose of <br/>\nthose advertising campaigns is to recruit.  I don&#39;t know if it could <br/>\nbe more obvious, since the end of those commercials tell you to <br/>\ncontact a recruiter not a congress person.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the topic.  Samurai didn&#39;t have to worry about advertising <br/>\ncampaigns and raising money from the public.  They were in the <br/>\nsamurai class.  They didn&#39;t need more people in it and they didn&#39;t <br/>\nrequire the support of the general public to get paid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, golfmandan@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Brandon, I don&#39;t know what your motivation is in disagreeing with <br/>\nme. I think I&#39;ve only stated the obvious. It&#39;s not like I made any <br/>\ngiant assuming leaps. First of all, I said &quot;kinda like&quot;... not <br/>\nEXACTLY like. Second of all, YES the military advertises itself to <br/>\nbuild up its image so it can maintain its numbers AND get more money <br/>\nfrom Congress. It&#39;s not like the two things are completely separate. <br/>\nThird, as for there &quot;always&quot; being a need for military... I never <br/>\nsaid there wasn&#39;t. But the need is greater or lesser at any given <br/>\ntime when compared with other times, and certainly PERCEIVED to be <br/>\ngreater or lesser at any given time. In a time of &quot;perceived&quot; lesser <br/>\nneed, spending gets cut. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  My point was just that without all the civil wars to fight, the <br/>\nrole of the samurai changed. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Kinda like for america, if we don&#39;t have any perceived military <br/>\n&gt; &gt; threats, we want to cut military spending. So what does the <br/>\nmilitary <br/>\n&gt; &gt; do? Come up with all the &quot;be all you can be&quot; and &quot;army of one&quot; <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;we&#39;re looking for a few good men&quot; advertising campaigns... which <br/>\n&gt; &gt; glorifies the military in the public&#39;s eye, and gives it a <br/>\npurpose <br/>\n&gt; &gt; apart from war... namely the bettering of our citizens by <br/>\neducation <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and experience. Bushido made samurai out to be &quot;honorable <br/>\ncitizens&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or something to that effect...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have to disagree with you here.  The military does not come up <br/>\nwith <br/>\n&gt; &gt; advertising campaigns to glorify the military in the public&#39;s <br/>\neye.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; How does spending more of the military budget on advertising give <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; military any more money.  A portion of the budget is allotted to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; recruit and retain personnel through these campaigns.  This was <br/>\nan <br/>\n&gt; &gt; important issue about 5 years ago.  The military branches were <br/>\nall <br/>\n&gt; &gt; significantly under mandated strength numbers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you want to cut military spending (or more aptly if congress <br/>\nwants <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do so) there isn&#39;t much the military can do about it.  <br/>\nCongress <br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes laws about force budgets and limitaions on force strength <br/>\n(the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; number of personnel in each branch).  Perception is an important <br/>\n&gt; &gt; issue and some people do percieve that we aren&#39;t in need of a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; military.  Perceptions are not always the truth.  Your perception <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; &gt; my perception may be completely different.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Relating back to the samurai, there is always a need for military <br/>\n&gt; &gt; power.  In the samurai days it may have been for civil obedience <br/>\n&gt; &gt; outside the existance of a war.  As for America&#39;s military, I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; &gt; challenge you to name a period in recent history that they <br/>\nweren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; invovled in some conflict.  U.S. forces have been reduced by more <br/>\n&gt; &gt; than half.  The military performs the same job with less people. <br/>\nThe  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; military also serves the purpose of civil protection, aid natural <br/>\n&gt; &gt; disaster victims, and any other emergency of national or local <br/>\n&gt; &gt; importance. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  The U.S. military is very different from the samurai.  Japan was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; isolated from most of the world.  By their own choice and because <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; &gt; geography.  The U.S. military deals with global issues.  A <br/>\nmilitary <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dealing only with its own country&#39;s problems has different <br/>\ndemands. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In which case your second assertion may bear some truth.  Only <br/>\nsome <br/>\n&gt; &gt; truth becuase I believe the samurai were in a postion like many <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dictatorships in the world.  They possessed the frightening might <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the military and didn&#39;t require justifying themselves to the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; population they ruled.  If the peasants didn&#39;t like it; what <br/>\nwould <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they do about it?  They odd situation with Japan is that they had <br/>\n2 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; positions of power.  Shogun and Emperor.  Periods existed when <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Emperor possessed all the power and there were times when the <br/>\nEmperor <br/>\n&gt; &gt; was only a puppet.  The peasants were&#39;nt the only ones who didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; like the system.  The Emperor didn&#39;t and he did something about <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; No matter how the samurai class may have been &quot;justified&quot; the <br/>\nEmperor <br/>\n&gt; &gt; decided that the weren&#39;t needed and that a new military needed to <br/>\nbe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; formed to progress the nation into modern times.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Important to note that he still thought a military was important <br/>\njust <br/>\n&gt; &gt; not the one they had.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brandon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

Many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Samurai did call out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lineage before a battle.  Although it seems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; silly to us now, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to remember how isolated Japan was from the rest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the world.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had a system of fighting wars that was very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different than any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other...Until the Mongols invaded.  Then the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Samurai began to wise<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up.  &quot;Hey, these Mongols don&#39;t really care about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our family do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My understanding is that the Japanese were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; totally unprepared to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight a war with an organized mongolian military<br/>\n&gt; &gt; machine.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the samurai were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prepared the second time, and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; preparations/strategic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that followed changed the face of Samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warfare.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Into the Sengoku is when Ashigaru are much more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; apparent in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; armies.  Long after the lineage practice had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been proven unwise by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mongols (I know, they were actually Korean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Chinese<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conscripts).  So at this point I can&#39;t see them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing it either.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many years later, after a couple hundred years<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of peace, under the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bushido is crystalized into what we know today.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Prior to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peaceful Edo Jidai, much of the &quot;honor sytem&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t based on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high and holy precepts that everyone thinks the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; samurai lived by.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was only in the last years of the samurai that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the bushido code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; influence the population.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess, I too get a little sick of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; generalizations.  I recently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Kensei.  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; informed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido<br/>\n&gt; &gt; code.  They were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warriors and role models that were bound by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; honor to better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; society.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They helped everyone gain greater understanding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by standing for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peace, justice, and the American way (well, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t really say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that, but they might as well have).  Upon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hearing this, I could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were good and bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai.  They didn&#39;t all live honorable and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they Bushido code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; affect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; must agree that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had some system of honor.  How else could we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quantify a good or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; samurai?  But it wasn&#39;t &quot;Bushido&quot; persay.  Since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Bushido&quot; did not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist in the Sengoku, it probably wasn&#39;t used to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep the troops<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their troops but it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been much more simple and less dubious than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you presume.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Promises of fame and fortune, political status,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; social status,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pride,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and land are other methods that could be used to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obtain loyalty.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In short, I don&#39;t think that there was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; universal conspiracy by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders of the time, to devise a system to keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a brotha down.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was not the &quot;purpose&quot; of honor or bushido,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; although it (like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else) could be perverted and warped to serve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sinister means.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brandon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kyle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Segall&quot; &lt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Try a little more than Shogun.

It&#39;s not like I made any giant assuming leaps. First of all, I said &quot;kinda like&quot;... not EXACTLY like. Second of all, YES the military advertises itself to build up its image so it can maintain its numbers AND get more money from Congress. It&#39;s not like the two things are completely separate. Third, as for there &quot;always&quot; being a need for military... I never said there wasn&#39;t. But the need is greater or lesser at any given time when compared with other times, and certainly PERCEIVED to be greater or lesser at any given time. In a time of &quot;perceived&quot; lesser need, spending gets cut. <br/>\n<br/>\n My point was just that without all the civil wars to fight, the role of the samurai changed. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Kinda like for america, if we don&#39;t have any perceived military <br/>\n&gt; threats, we want to cut military spending. So what does the military <br/>\n&gt; do? Come up with all the &quot;be all you can be&quot; and &quot;army of one&quot; and <br/>\n&gt; &quot;we&#39;re looking for a few good men&quot; advertising campaigns... which <br/>\n&gt; glorifies the military in the public&#39;s eye, and gives it a purpose <br/>\n&gt; apart from war... namely the bettering of our citizens by education <br/>\n&gt; and experience. Bushido made samurai out to be &quot;honorable citizens&quot; <br/>\n&gt; or something to that effect...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to disagree with you here.  The military does not come up with <br/>\n&gt; advertising campaigns to glorify the military in the public&#39;s eye.  <br/>\n&gt; How does spending more of the military budget on advertising give the <br/>\n&gt; military any more money.  A portion of the budget is allotted to <br/>\n&gt; recruit and retain personnel through these campaigns.  This was an <br/>\n&gt; important issue about 5 years ago.  The military branches were all <br/>\n&gt; significantly under mandated strength numbers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want to cut military spending (or more aptly if congress wants <br/>\n&gt; to do so) there isn&#39;t much the military can do about it.  Congress <br/>\n&gt; makes laws about force budgets and limitaions on force strength (the <br/>\n&gt; number of personnel in each branch).  Perception is an important <br/>\n&gt; issue and some people do percieve that we aren&#39;t in need of a <br/>\n&gt; military.  Perceptions are not always the truth.  Your perception and <br/>\n&gt; my perception may be completely different.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Relating back to the samurai, there is always a need for military <br/>\n&gt; power.  In the samurai days it may have been for civil obedience <br/>\n&gt; outside the existance of a war.  As for America&#39;s military, I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; challenge you to name a period in recent history that they weren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; invovled in some conflict.  U.S. forces have been reduced by more <br/>\n&gt; than half.  The military performs the same job with less people. The  <br/>\n&gt; military also serves the purpose of civil protection, aid natural <br/>\n&gt; disaster victims, and any other emergency of national or local <br/>\n&gt; importance. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  The U.S. military is very different from the samurai.  Japan was <br/>\n&gt; isolated from most of the world.  By their own choice and because of <br/>\n&gt; geography.  The U.S. military deals with global issues.  A military <br/>\n&gt; dealing only with its own country&#39;s problems has different demands. <br/>\n&gt; In which case your second assertion may bear some truth.  Only some <br/>\n&gt; truth becuase I believe the samurai were in a postion like many <br/>\n&gt; dictatorships in the world.  They possessed the frightening might or <br/>\n&gt; the military and didn&#39;t require justifying themselves to the <br/>\n&gt; population they ruled.  If the peasants didn&#39;t like it; what would <br/>\n&gt; they do about it?  They odd situation with Japan is that they had 2 <br/>\n&gt; positions of power.  Shogun and Emperor.  Periods existed when the <br/>\n&gt; Emperor possessed all the power and there were times when the Emperor <br/>\n&gt; was only a puppet.  The peasants were&#39;nt the only ones who didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; like the system.  The Emperor didn&#39;t and he did something about it.  <br/>\n&gt; No matter how the samurai class may have been &quot;justified&quot; the Emperor <br/>\n&gt; decided that the weren&#39;t needed and that a new military needed to be <br/>\n&gt; formed to progress the nation into modern times.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Important to note that he still thought a military was important just <br/>\n&gt; not the one they had.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brandon<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Upon<br/>\n&gt; hearing this, I could <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hear <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There<br/>\n&gt; were good and bad <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1046649255\">Kinda like for america, if we don&#39;t have any perceived military <br/>\nthreats, we want to cut military spending. So what does the military <br/>\ndo? Come up with all the &quot;be all you can be&quot; and &quot;army of one&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;we&#39;re looking for a few good men&quot; advertising campaigns... which <br/>\nglorifies the military in the public&#39;s eye, and gives it a purpose <br/>\napart from war... namely the bettering of our citizens by education <br/>\nand experience. Bushido made samurai out to be &quot;honorable citizens&quot; <br/>\nor something to that effect...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to disagree with you here.  The military does not come up with <br/>\nadvertising campaigns to glorify the military in the public&#39;s eye.  <br/>\nHow does spending more of the military budget on advertising give the <br/>\nmilitary any more money.  A portion of the budget is allotted to <br/>\nrecruit and retain personnel through these campaigns.  This was an <br/>\nimportant issue about 5 years ago.  The military branches were all <br/>\nsignificantly under mandated strength numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to cut military spending (or more aptly if congress wants <br/>\nto do so) there isn&#39;t much the military can do about it.  Congress <br/>\nmakes laws about force budgets and limitaions on force strength (the <br/>\nnumber of personnel in each branch).  Perception is an important <br/>\nissue and some people do percieve that we aren&#39;t in need of a <br/>\nmilitary.  Perceptions are not always the truth.  Your perception and <br/>\nmy perception may be completely different.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRelating back to the samurai, there is always a need for military <br/>\npower.  In the samurai days it may have been for civil obedience <br/>\noutside the existance of a war.  As for America&#39;s military, I&#39;d <br/>\nchallenge you to name a period in recent history that they weren&#39;t <br/>\ninvovled in some conflict.  U.S. forces have been reduced by more <br/>\nthan half.  The military performs the same job with less people. The  <br/>\nmilitary also serves the purpose of civil protection, aid natural <br/>\ndisaster victims, and any other emergency of national or local <br/>\nimportance. <br/>\n<br/>\n The U.S. military is very different from the samurai.  Japan was <br/>\nisolated from most of the world.  By their own choice and because of <br/>\ngeography.  The U.S. military deals with global issues.  A military <br/>\ndealing only with its own country&#39;s problems has different demands. <br/>\nIn which case your second assertion may bear some truth.  Only some <br/>\ntruth becuase I believe the samurai were in a postion like many <br/>\ndictatorships in the world.  They possessed the frightening might or <br/>\nthe military and didn&#39;t require justifying themselves to the <br/>\npopulation they ruled.  If the peasants didn&#39;t like it; what would <br/>\nthey do about it?  They odd situation with Japan is that they had 2 <br/>\npositions of power.  Shogun and Emperor.  Periods existed when the <br/>\nEmperor possessed all the power and there were times when the Emperor <br/>\nwas only a puppet.  The peasants were&#39;nt the only ones who didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike the system.  The Emperor didn&#39;t and he did something about it.  <br/>\nNo matter how the samurai class may have been &quot;justified&quot; the Emperor <br/>\ndecided that the weren&#39;t needed and that a new military needed to be <br/>\nformed to progress the nation into modern times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nImportant to note that he still thought a military was important just <br/>\nnot the one they had.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon</div>",

It wasn&#39;t for keeping the samurai down, but for keeping them &quot;up.&quot; That is, in a society without any wars, if you have a military class, you have to have some rational or emotional justification for continuing their benefits.

I&#39;m just SICK of all these <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for <br/>\n&gt; every <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; age, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his <br/>\n&gt; actions. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Only famous for who he killed and how dumb he was in doing it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
