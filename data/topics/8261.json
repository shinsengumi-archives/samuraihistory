            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1916086788\">&quot;And also there was a class of people, I believe they were called<br/>\n&quot;Ji-samurai&quot; or &quot;farmer-samurai&quot; who worked the fields but also could<br/>\nfight in battles. Not sure, please anyone feel free to correct me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s about right. &#39;Samurai&#39; status covered the richest to<br/>\nthe poorest, and many samurai were dirt poor, working alongside their<br/>\nfarmers in the fields if they wanted to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nStories of early Tokugawa (Matsudaira) retainers tell of samurai<br/>\nlining the rice field with sandals hung from the shafts of their<br/>\nspears, and in one case a samurai covered himself in mud in the hope<br/>\nthat a 15-year-old Ieyasu might not recognise him, and how low he had<br/>\nfallen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother of the era tell of a samurai who lost his Takeda &#39;castle&#39; (not<br/>\nmuch more than a stockade) when the land fell to Tokugawa. The<br/>\nstructure was burned down and he became an inn-keeper.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the same era are stories of peasants elevated in status at the whim<br/>\nof the Shogun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation grows even more complex if you look at Shikoku after<br/>\nSekigahara, when it was ruled that samurai must be attached to the<br/>\ncastle, any farmer must therefore surrender his samurai status. This<br/>\nwas a move to stop rebellion, by making the samurai absolutely<br/>\ndependent upon the bakafu for their survival. It reintroduced the<br/>\n&#39;goshi&#39; - a gentleman farmer who might well be richer than his samurai<br/>\nneighbour (and better skilled in the carriage of arms).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact the Shikoku goshi was closer to the original samurai than his<br/>\nEdo counterpart, who became more and more a time-serving bureaucrat,<br/>\nand one might say the mantle of most of what people think of as<br/>\nsamurai passed to him. Certainly the Tosa swordsmen (of whom Ryoma was<br/>\none) kept the classical arts of the warrior very much alive and &#39;real&#39;<br/>\nas opposed to the artificiality that was creeping into the<br/>\nprofessional Edo dojo. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But definitely after Hideyoshi&#39;s &quot;sword-hunt,&quot; a samurai was<br/>\ndefinitely born, not made.&quot;<br/>\nThat was the rule, but I think at the time it was hard to enforce -<br/>\nand of course was at the whim of whoever was in charge. Hideyoshi<br/>\nhimself &#39;elevated&#39; commoners to samurai - Kato Kiyomasa was the son of<br/>\na blacksmith. So did Ieyasu after him.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly post-Edo it was the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think basically the rule was not made to protect or preserve samurai<br/>\nstatus, but as a means of social control and restraint.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",

You&#39;re correct, the sword hunt<br/>\nwas in 1588--12 to 15 years earlier. However, it&#39;s not<br/>\nlike he gave the order and *poof* things were<br/>\nsolidified. Major social changes like this take a<br/>\nlittle time to take effect. You could argue that up<br/>\nthrough the Osaka campaign, it was possible to change<br/>\nstatus through armed conflict--certainly enough<br/>\noutside the establishment joined the Toyotomi cause in<br/>\norder to make a name for themselves. The majority<br/>\nwould have been ronin, and you could say they were &quot;in<br/>\nthe samurai class&quot;, but I hardly think they checked<br/>\nfor Samurai ID cards at the door. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m considering 12 years as an<br/>\ninsignificant stretch of time in the 1000 years of<br/>\nsamurai history. Especially in this case, the Sword<br/>\nHunt and the social concepts it heralded were direct<br/>\nprecursors to the social order of the Tokugawa period,<br/>\nand not part of the Sengoku. Hideyoshi wasn&#39;t merely<br/>\nbefore the Tokugawa, he set the stage for it. The idea<br/>\nwas there, the law was there, but it really only<br/>\nbecame something solid after peace. People up unto the<br/>\n1630&#39;s still had the institutional memory of the<br/>\nprevious social order--I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a<br/>\ncoincidence that the last major rebellion against the<br/>\nTokugawa, the Shimabara Rebellion, was a<br/>\ncommoner/lower-class samurai rebellion that took place<br/>\nin the 1630&#39;s. Past this, anybody who had any memory<br/>\nof commoners carrying weapons and partaking in combat<br/>\nwas dead--the rest accepted the status quo because<br/>\nit&#39;s all they knew. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I<br/>\n&gt; thought that this <br/>\n&gt; was only true when Toyotomi Hideyoshi turned Japan<br/>\n&gt; society into a caste <br/>\n&gt; system (so that no one else could do what he did.<br/>\n&gt; ;-) ) and that before <br/>\n&gt; that there was a lot more fluidity in the social<br/>\n&gt; classes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Correct, Dan--up until Hideyoshi&#39;s edicts, most<br/>\nsamurai of the lower and middle levels were also<br/>\ninvolved in agriculture. The common term is<br/>\n&quot;Jizamurai&quot;, n, indicating the samurai had a<br/>\nconnection with the land. These warrior-farmers could<br/>\ninclude peasant farmers who only served as ashigaru<br/>\nwhen called up, and returned to the rice paddies when<br/>\nnot at war, but mostly refer to samurai who owned<br/>\nfields and may have been small plantation owners. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe strict division Nina mentions is largely an<br/>\nEdo-period construct--prior to the edicts, there was<br/>\nmuch more ambiguity, and the right combination of<br/>\nopportunity and skill could lead a lower-class peasant<br/>\nor merchant to not only become a samurai, but to<br/>\nbecome a daimyo, a la Saito Dosan (a former oil<br/>\nmerchant) or Toyotomi Hideyoshi***. If these famous<br/>\ncases exist, it&#39;s certainly likely that many more<br/>\npeople were able to transition from peasant to<br/>\nlower-level warrior, ashigaru, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, we shouldn&#39;t assume that prior to the<br/>\nEdo period you could, as Nina says, &quot;enroll in Samurai<br/>\n101&quot; and become a samurai. It was definitely easier in<br/>\nperiods of national turmoil, such as the Sengoku<br/>\nperiod, when anyone of skill would be utilized, and<br/>\ncould make a name for themselves (and then invent a<br/>\nlineage later). You don&#39;t hear of too many situations<br/>\nlike Dosan and Hideyoshi in the Heian or Kamakura<br/>\nperiods, for example. This was due to many factors,<br/>\nmost of which changed during the Sengoku. Previously,<br/>\nashigaru weren&#39;t considered &quot;samurai&quot;--they were cheap<br/>\nfootsoldiers recruited from the peasantry to put<br/>\nspears in the field, but weren&#39;t a professional or<br/>\neven semi-professional fighting force. As the scale of<br/>\nwarfare grew, new weapons (guns, the longer spears<br/>\ncarried by ashigaru, etc.) and new tactics were<br/>\ndeveloped, and consequently you couldn&#39;t just round up<br/>\na bunch of farmers, give them spears, and send them<br/>\noff to fight. While early guns didn&#39;t require as much<br/>\ntraining as the sword or bow, they still required<br/>\ntraining--and once trained, a daimyo isn&#39;t just going<br/>\nto release his new ashigaru to their own devices.<br/>\nSamurai combat became more and more an ashigaru<br/>\nfight--led by upper level samurai, but the footsoldier<br/>\nwas vitally important to the success of Oda Nobunaga,<br/>\netc. As this importance was realized, ashigaru were<br/>\ngranted more status, gradually separated from their<br/>\nfarming duties (though warfare frequently stopped so<br/>\nfields could be tended up into the 1570&#39;s), and<br/>\nsigning up as an ashigaru became a way to &quot;get<br/>\nnoticed&quot;--Hideyoshi&#39;s path to glory, along with many<br/>\nwho he brought up with him, started this way. As I<br/>\nsaid before, in the period of civil war a good soldier<br/>\nwas a good soldier, regardless of his parentage, and<br/>\nwould be promoted and given leadership roles and<br/>\nprestige if warranted. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the Sengoku, this need to utilize<br/>\ntalented people regardless of background ends.<br/>\nHideyoshi&#39;s edicts made the separation between the<br/>\nclasses, and recognized the ashigaru as the lowest<br/>\nlevel of samurai. Those jizamurai who both fought and<br/>\nfarmed were forced to choose between the two<br/>\nprofessions, and more chose farming than you would<br/>\nthink. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, even those who &quot;rose from the masses&quot; took great<br/>\npains to either hide or compensate for their humble<br/>\nbackgrounds. Hideyoshi had himself &quot;adopted&quot; by a<br/>\nFujiwara nobleman, to legitimize his position. <br/>\n<br/>\n***It should be noted that the notion of Hideyoshi<br/>\nbeginning life as a vagabond peasant is mostly<br/>\nromantic fiction. Research indicates his father was an<br/>\nashigaru under Oda Nobuhide, so while he may have<br/>\nfloated between classes early in his life (different<br/>\nstories have him selling needles as an itinerant<br/>\nmerchant, farming, training as a priest, traveling<br/>\naround for work as a stableboy, etc.), he had a<br/>\nconnection to the warrior class from the beginning. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

As you can see there are  <br/>\nmany strong opinions here, the underlying theme being if you are  <br/>\ngoing to write about the conception of the samurai you had first  <br/>\nbetter know from real history just what a samurai really is (was).  <br/>\nWill you study only one period in Japanese History as background or  <br/>\nall of it? The samurai dominated art, culture and politics for close  <br/>\nto a thousand years. What will be your control model? How western  <br/>\nscholars view the samurai? How Japanese scholars view him? How  <br/>\nJapanese popular culture sees him today or how he was viewed in context?<br/>\n\tThere are a lot of great films out there, what is the cut off for  <br/>\n&quot;modern Hollywood film?&quot; Is &quot;Memoirs&quot; included in your list? Would  <br/>\nyou include Black Rain? or Mr Baseball? or Gung-ho? None feature a  <br/>\nman in 16th century armour but all feed the (mis-)conception. What  <br/>\nabout The Octagon, The Challenge, Red Sun, Bushido Blade or The  <br/>\nYakuza? or even The Killer Elite or Bataan and a dozen other war  <br/>\nfilms? are they too old to be &quot;modern?&quot; How are you going to sort  <br/>\nthem out and decide what to include and what to ignore? It is a big  <br/>\njob. It certainly can be done but you may need to tighten your focus  <br/>\nor you&#39;ll wind up starting off on a career rather than a dissertation...<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with both BTW</div>",

From around 1100 until <br/>\naround 1868 (NOTE: please anyone correct me on the specifics of dates; I <br/>\nforget the exact year that the samurai class was officially abolished). After the <br/>\nsamurai were officially abolished in Japan, there WERE NO MORE SAMURAI. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the second place, a samurai was almost always born into the samurai class. <br/>\nIn general, a person couldn&#39;t wake up and tell himself, &quot;gee, I think I&#39;d <br/>\nreally like a career as a samurai, so I&#39;ll enroll in Samurai 101 at the Samurai <br/>\nUniversity.&quot; Once in a while, a non-samurai could be married into a samurai <br/>\nfamily, usually as an adopted son. But for the most part, a samurai was born, not <br/>\nmade.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the third place, the Western idea of samurai women as being wafting, week, <br/>\nsimpering Oriental beauties, just waiting for a strong, strapping Tom Cruise <br/>\nclone to rescue her from the cruel, sinister evil male-chauvinist-pig Oriental <br/>\nmen: this is purely a fantasy. <br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE HERE: we already had a long, involved discussion about the real roles of <br/>\nwomen in historical samurai culture on the forum and probably here as well. <br/>\nSo with the above, I do NOT intend to get involved in such a discussion again. <br/>\nWhat I meant above is that Western mythmakers have a whole lot of fantasies <br/>\nabout servile, compliant, helpless Asian women, and this is reflected in a lot <br/>\nof Western movies and novels. <br/>\n<br/>\nA prime example of Western misconceptions about the samurai is in comparing <br/>\nthe films THE SEVEN SAMURAI and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

Western gunfighters are not <br/>\nJapanese ronin; western gunfighters don&#39;t have the same issues, culture, or <br/>\nplace as Japanese ronin.  A person in the U.S. could decide that, &quot;I think I&#39;ll <br/>\nbecome a gunfighter,&quot; then could study hard and then go forth in this career. <br/>\n<br/>\nA Japanese ronin rarefly became a ronin by choice. Usually he was forced into <br/>\nthis role by some event in history. And also, a ronin could not be a ronin <br/>\nwithout first being a samurai. So he had to be born into the samurai class, <br/>\nunlike western U.S. gunfighters, who could be born in any class or background.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are the vast differences between 17th century Japan itself and <br/>\n19th century U.S. I could write a book on this. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnough for now.

So he had to be born into the samurai class, <br/>\nunlike western U.S. gunfighters, who could be born in any class or background.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are the vast differences between 17th century Japan itself and <br/>\n19th century U.S. I could write a book on this. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnough for now.

There<br/>\nare a lot of people here than I&#39;m sure agree with me. You&#39;ve come to<br/>\nthe right place with  your topic. I hope others here speak up.
