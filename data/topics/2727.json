It&#39;a all stuff taken from the <br/>\nKodansha Encyclopedia of Japan Online.

Carried out by former samurai of the Satsuma domain (now <br/>\nKagoshima Prefecture) under the leadership of Saigo Takamori, the <br/>\nrebellion lasted from 29 January to 24 September 1877. Its suppression <br/>\nproved the effectiveness of the government&#39;s new conscript army in <br/>\nmodern warfare.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reform program of the government had caused the disestablishment of <br/>\nthe samurai class, the abolition of their social privileges, a drastic <br/>\nreduction of their income, and the destruction of their traditional way <br/>\nof life. When their hero, Saigo Takamori, was politically discredited <br/>\nand resigned from the government in October 1873 as a result of a <br/>\ndebate over whether to wage war on Korea , a number of former Satsuma <br/>\nsamurai left their posts in the army and police force en masse to <br/>\nreturn to Kagoshima with Saigo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeizure of arms and ammunition from a naval yard and army munitions <br/>\ndepot by some of Saigo&#39;s followers was the spark that touched off open <br/>\nrebellion. Presented with thisfait accompli, Saigo saw no choice but to <br/>\ncome out of semiretirement to lead a hastily organized and poorly <br/>\nequipped rebel army of about 40,000 men.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a battle between the rebels and the local garrison at Kumamoto <br/>\nlasting about 50 days, the arrival of government reinforcements turned <br/>\nthe tide and forced Saigo&#39;s retreat. For the next few months the <br/>\nremnants of the Satsuma army fought their way through the mountains of <br/>\nsouthern Kyushu, arriving in Kagoshima with about 400 troops. The <br/>\nrebellion came to an end with a last charge by Saigo and his men, <br/>\nfollowed by Saigo&#39;s suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- and here&#39;s something about the end of the Samurai...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tokugawa Shogunate (1603�1867) brought peace, which posed problems <br/>\nfor the ruling samurai class. Some samurai were employed in government, <br/>\nbut many more became idle stipendaries. In response to these problems <br/>\nof the samurai during the peaceful Edo period (1600�1868), <br/>\nintellectuals formulated the code of bushido, or the �Way of the <br/>\nwarrior.� Bushido romanticized the Japanese warrior tradition and <br/>\nenjoined samurai to maintain military preparedness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe visit to Japan in 1853 of a squadron of ships commanded by <br/>\nCommodore Matthew Perry of the United States brought Japan&#39;s National <br/>\nseclusion policy to an end. During the next decade and a half, owing to <br/>\nits inability to deal effectively with foreign relations, the shogunate <br/>\nwas increasingly criticized and attacked, especially by samurai <br/>\nopponents within those domains, including Satsuma (now Kagoshima <br/>\nPrefecture) and Choshu (now Yamaguchi Prefecture), that had never been <br/>\npermitted to participate directly in central government affairs. <br/>\nUltimately there arose in the mid-1860s an imperial-loyalist movement, <br/>\nled by lower-level samurai from Satsuma, Choshu, and other domains, <br/>\nwhich branded the shogunate an unworthy government and led to the Meiji <br/>\nRestoration of 1868.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Meiji government, however, could ill afford to continue payment of <br/>\nthe hereditary samurai stipends; moreover, continuance of the samurai&#39;s <br/>\nelite warrior status was incompatible with the building of a modern <br/>\nconscript army. Dissolution of the samurai class was carried out <br/>\nbetween 1873 and 1876 in a series of measures collectively called <br/>\nchitsuroku shobun. Some samurai leaders undertook armed rebellions, the <br/>\nlast of which�the Satsuma Rebellion�was put down in 1877; others <br/>\nfounded Western-style political parties and launched a movement for <br/>\nrepresentative government.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- finally...<br/>\n<br/>\nchitsuroku shobun<br/>\nMeasures (shobun) adopted by the government in the 1870s to abolish the <br/>\nhereditary stipends (chitsuroku) granted to the nobility and members of <br/>\nthe samurai class immediately after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. In <br/>\n1869 the court aristocracy and former daimyo had been classified as <br/>\nkazoku, while the former samurai were divided into shizoku or sotsu; <br/>\nthese status distinctions became the basis for computing the stipends <br/>\nto be paid to members of these groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy 1871, however, the government began to reconsider the whole stipend <br/>\nsystem. The cost of rice stipends alone constituted 30 percent of total <br/>\ngovernment expenses and was diverting essential resources from other <br/>\ncrucial tasks such as the development of a modern army and navy. As a <br/>\nresult, the government began to tax the stipends in 1873, and in 1876 <br/>\ndecreed that all stipends be converted into government bonds called <br/>\nkinroku kosai that would not be redeemable for a five-year period. <br/>\nThese measures were a blow to the former samurai and, together with the <br/>\nloss of other feudal privileges, led to a wave of samurai revolts <br/>\nculminating in the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. By 1880 more than half of <br/>\nthe poorer samurai had sold off their bonds; the nobility and former <br/>\ndaimyo fared better, many using the bonds as investment capital in the <br/>\nnewly formed national bank system.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
