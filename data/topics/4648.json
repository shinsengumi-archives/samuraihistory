Recall <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree 100% with this. I believe that it&#39;s important when asking <br/>\n(or answering) questions, to explicitly talk about what time period <br/>\nis under discussion. Since we are talking about almost 1000 years of <br/>\nhistory, there is no absolute answer to almost any question at all. <br/>\nIt depends on when (and sometimes where) we are talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;that the first samurai (really bushi, since the kind of socio-political <br/>\n&gt;organization implied by the term &quot;samurai&quot; had not really evolved yet) were <br/>\n&gt;essentially outlaws on the rugged and unsettled northeastern frontier of <br/>\n&gt;Honshu, where the writ of the imperial court did not run, nearly 1,000 years <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a very long and well written reply. I only would like to add <br/>\nthat this way of understanding of the roots of the samurai is really <br/>\none of several competing theories (theory in the sense of theory of <br/>\nevolution - I don&#39;t use theory here in a disparaging way) . There is a <br/>\nwhole field of study about how the samurai class came about. While <br/>\nthere are theories that are more accepted than others, it is still up <br/>\nfor grabs. The &quot;strongmen of the north&quot; theory is not necessarily the <br/>\nonly way to understand how the samurai class came about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI particulary enjoy (and hate - it&#39;s a very difficult read) _Bushi <br/>\nno SeiRitsu_ by Motoki Yasuo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;At this point it was largely true that a samurai was as a samurai did. If you <br/>\n&gt;showed up with a mount, armed cap-�pie,  and demonstrated the skills and <br/>\n&gt;courage to fight effectively no one was likely to be inclined to inquire <br/>\n&gt;closely about your ancestry. And if someone got rude about it you, as a <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is compounded by the fact that ancestries could be, well, made <br/>\nup on the spot. Anyone could claim to be decended from the Minamoto or <br/>\nTaira, and they often did.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;After the Onin Wars, and particularly after the introduction of gunpowder <br/>\n&gt;weapons, entry at the bottom became even more porous -- a sturdy physique and <br/>\n&gt;pugnacious disposition could win you access to the lowest rungs of warrior <br/>\n&gt;status. Were these fellows &quot;real samurai&quot;? It was a question that didn&#39;t seem <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is very well said, again. The question &quot;were ashigaru actually <br/>\nsamurai&quot; is an un-answerable one. Or rather, the answer is probably <br/>\n&quot;it doesn&#39;t really matter&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;ability could carry you a long way up the social hierarchy. Hideyoshi never <br/>\n&gt;felt quite secure enough to claim the very topmost rung, but if anyone <br/>\n&gt;despised such a man for his humble origins he needed to be very, very <br/>\n&gt;circumspect in saying so.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This point I agree less with. It&#39;s telling that &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; is <br/>\nprobably the example that is mentioned most. Of course <br/>\nthere is also Saitou Dousan who was a seller of oils. But there are <br/>\nfew cases of common people going very far up the social heirarchy. <br/>\nIt did happen and we&#39;ve just mentioned two actual people who did it. B<br/>\nut it has to be said that this was very much the exception to the rule<br/>\n.<br/>\nOn the other hand of course the sengoku era is known as the era of &quot;ge<br/>\n-koku-jou&quot; which means &quot;the low supplanting the high&quot;. It was the era <br/>\nof vassals supplanting their lords; but not of commoners supplanting s<br/>\namurai.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(BTW, the point of the sword hunt was not to close the samurai class in <br/>\n&gt;social terms but rather to secure the countryside and ensure that no <br/>\n&gt;challenges to Hideyoshi&#39;s order could arise. Ieyasu and his successors <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;followed Hidedyoshi&#39;s lead for like reasons. Of course Nobunaga had really <br/>\n&gt;set the precedent through his vigorous suppression of the militarized ikki.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not so sure that Nobunaga&#39;s efforts at repressing his enemies <br/>\ncan be said to have directly led to the katana-gari approach. Any <br/>\nmilitary leader would of course want to disarm or disable his enemy. <br/>\nBut the katana-gari method seems a fairly different solution than <br/>\nordinary armed suppression (or armed conflict).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;All this changed a great deal between the establishment of the Tokugawa <br/>\n&gt;bakufu in 1603 and its full consolidation in power (about a generation <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. This is a very important point. A lot of structures, <br/>\nphilosophies, and overall &quot;rules&quot; were formalized and legitimized in <br/>\nthe Edo period. Sometimes people misunderstand that these <br/>\nformalities were in place all along. Sometimes they were and <br/>\nsometimes they were not. But as a general approach it&#39;s a good idea <br/>\nto keep in mind that the Tokugawa structure only came about in the <br/>\nearly 17th century. What came before it was not (necessarily) the <br/>\nsame thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJay Kelly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oyakata@...\">oyakata@...</a></div>",

By 1630, the actual military functions of the <br/>\nsamurai were largely moot and the members of this numerous class <br/>\n(probably 7% or so of the total population, although varying greatly <br/>\nfrom han to han) were employed (when employed at all) solely in <br/>\nbureaucratic or ceremonial duties. The Tokugawa order still rested <br/>\non military dominance -- the term &quot;bakufu&quot; directly implies as much -<br/>\n- so the military functions of the samurai could not be dispensed <br/>\nwith, but they remained in abeyance for more than two centuries.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In these circumstances, the samurai became two things: an <br/>\n </span></blockquote>essentially hereditary social class and a collective term for those <br/>\noccupying the top 100 or more of the levels of authority in a deeply <br/>\nhierarchical socio-political structure. The picture was complicated <br/>\nby the decentralized nature of authority under the Tokugawa, since <br/>\neach daimyo&#39;s household or o-ie was a largely a law unto itself <br/>\nregarding its own composition and structure. That is, if your local <br/>\ndaimyo said you were a samurai, that was all it took to make you a <br/>\nmember of the authority hierarchy, entitled and required to behave <br/>\naccordingly. And if no daimyo (recalling that the shogun himself was <br/>\nalso a daimyo, head of his own great o-ie) claimed you, then you <br/>\nwere an outcaste, at least officially -- a ronin. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; (A ronin remained a sort of samurai-by-courtesy, owing to social <br/>\n </span></blockquote>origin, and might by good fortune or exceptional ability gain the <br/>\npatronage of some other daimyo and thus regain official standing. <br/>\nBut many drifted to other employment, including agriculture, trade, <br/>\nor less reputable fields.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The practice of the daimyo varied a great deal. In fact, no one <br/>\n </span></blockquote>has yet mapped out the patterns of all 260+ daimyo households. But <br/>\nit is clear that at least some of them altered the status order a <br/>\nlot. First of all, of course, there was a general trend toward <br/>\nreducing many samurai from independent holders to stipendiaries <br/>\nwholly dependent on the daimyo -- a major shift (downward) in terms <br/>\nof status and autonomy. On the other hand, various individuals or <br/>\ngroups might be granted samurai status (and stipends, although the <br/>\nlatter were usually meager) in return for benefits bestowed on the <br/>\nhan. To put it bluntly, in a lot of cases you could very well buy <br/>\nyour way into samurai status. (How far &quot;real&quot; hereditary samurai <br/>\nwould go in cashing your status claims is another matter, of course.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the most part, it was pretty difficult to move more than one <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or perhaps two rungs up the samurai status ladder in the Tokugawa <br/>\nera -- and most han had at least a score of rungs, with hundreds in <br/>\nsome of the larger ones. But one could ascend a long way in certain <br/>\ncases. For one thing, homosexuality was relatively widespread among <br/>\nthe samurai (both before and during the Tokugawa era) and a young <br/>\nfavorite of the daimyo might rise to high status.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; When the samurai structure was swept away after the Restoration, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the samurai social class did not entirely disappear. Indeed, the <br/>\nMeiji elite, in one of their concessions to the old order, gave <br/>\nofficial recognition to the class. This created the problem of <br/>\ndeciding who should be so designated, which was the source of many <br/>\nheadaches due to the variation among han practices. It was <br/>\noriginally proposed to have some gradation in official class, <br/>\nreflecting former rank distinctions. This was eventually given up as <br/>\na bad job and all former daimyo were ranked in one class, with <br/>\neveryone else lumped in another. Even so, there were many gray areas <br/>\nand many who were dissatisfied with the results.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I think I&#39;ve addressed most of the points raised by others, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>there are two specific questions deserving separate treatment<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;naomasa298&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;shanesuebsahakarn@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At that stage, you were either born a samurai or you weren&#39;t, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure there were exceptions.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-536689517\">This question has certainly generated some lively and interesting discussion!<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it helpful to think back over the evolution of the samurai. Recall that the first samurai (really bushi, since the kind of socio-political organization implied by the term &quot;samurai&quot; had not really evolved yet) were essentially outlaws on the rugged and unsettled northeastern frontier of Honshu, where the writ of the imperial court did not run, nearly 1,000 years ago. (Some people have tried to trace their roots further back than that, but not entirely convincingly to my mind. Martin Collcutt reviewed several relevant books a few years ago -- full citations for this and other works at end of this post.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the leaders of bushi bands made good and established themselves as overlords of one or more villages. In other cases local magnates, recognizing their value, took bushi into their service (as &quot;samurai&quot; per se -- the word comes from one meaning &quot;to serve&quot;). The logic of big battalions fostered the formation and growth of samurai/bushi networks and hierarchies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point it was largely true that a samurai was as a samurai did. If you showed up with a mount, armed cap-à-pie,  and demonstrated the skills and courage to fight effectively no one was likely to be inclined to inquire closely about your ancestry. And if someone got rude about it you, as a proper samurai, demonstrated how good your bloodline really was by fighting him to the death, then and there. Of course it took a good deal of capital, in a society without much movable wealth, in order to equip and train yourself. Being the son of a successful bushi was the most common route, but by no means the only one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the Onin Wars, and particularly after the introduction of gunpowder weapons, entry at the bottom became even more porous -- a sturdy physique and pugnacious disposition could win you access to the lowest rungs of warrior status. Were these fellows &quot;real samurai&quot;? It was a question that didn&#39;t seem to bother anyone especially -- their military utility was enough to recommend them in an era where it was very much a matter of dog eat dog. And of course ability could carry you a long way up the social hierarchy. Hideyoshi never felt quite secure enough to claim the very topmost rung, but if anyone despised such a man for his humble origins he needed to be very, very circumspect in saying so.<br/>\n<br/>\n(BTW, the point of the sword hunt was not to close the samurai class in social terms but rather to secure the countryside and ensure that no challenges to Hideyoshi&#39;s order could arise. Ieyasu and his successors followed Hidedyoshi&#39;s lead for like reasons. Of course Nobunaga had really set the precedent through his vigorous suppression of the militarized ikki.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this changed a great deal between the establishment of the Tokugawa bakufu in 1603 and its full consolidation in power (about a generation later). By 1630, the actual military functions of the samurai were largely moot and the members of this numerous class (probably 7% or so of the total population, although varying greatly from han to han) were employed (when employed at all) solely in bureaucratic or ceremonial duties. The Tokugawa order still rested on military dominance -- the term &quot;bakufu&quot; directly implies as much -- so the military functions of the samurai could not be dispensed with, but they remained in abeyance for more than two centuries.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn these circumstances, the samurai became two things: an essentially hereditary social class and a collective term for those occupying the top 100 or more of the levels of authority in a deeply hierarchical socio-political structure. The picture was complicated by the decentralized nature of authority under the Tokugawa, since each daimyo&#39;s household or o-ie was a largely a law unto itself regarding its own composition and structure. That is, if your local daimyo said you were a samurai, that was all it took to make you a member of the authority hierarchy, entitled and required to behave accordingly. And if no daimyo (recalling that the shogun himself was also a daimyo, head of his own great o-ie) claimed you, then you were an outcaste, at least officially -- a ronin. <br/>\n<br/>\n(A ronin remained a sort of samurai-by-courtesy, owing to social origin, and might by good fortune or exceptional ability gain the patronage of some other daimyo and thus regain official standing. But many drifted to other employment, including agriculture, trade, or less reputable fields.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe practice of the daimyo varied a great deal. In fact, no one has yet mapped out the patterns of all 260+ daimyo households. But it is clear that at least some of them altered the status order a lot. First of all, of course, there was a general trend toward reducing many samurai from independent holders to stipendiaries wholly dependent on the daimyo -- a major shift (downward) in terms of status and autonomy. On the other hand, various individuals or groups might be granted samurai status (and stipends, although the latter were usually meager) in return for benefits bestowed on the han. To put it bluntly, in a lot of cases you could very well buy your way into samurai status. (How far &quot;real&quot; hereditary samurai would go in cashing your status claims is another matter, of course.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part, it was pretty difficult to move more than one or perhaps two rungs up the samurai status ladder in the Tokugawa era -- and most han had at least a score of rungs, with hundreds in some of the larger ones. But one could ascend a long way in certain cases. For one thing, homosexuality was relatively widespread among the samurai (both before and during the Tokugawa era) and a young favorite of the daimyo might rise to high status.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the samurai structure was swept away after the Restoration, the samurai social class did not entirely disappear. Indeed, the Meiji elite, in one of their concessions to the old order, gave official recognition to the class. This created the problem of deciding who should be so designated, which was the source of many headaches due to the variation among han practices. It was originally proposed to have some gradation in official class, reflecting former rank distinctions. This was eventually given up as a bad job and all former daimyo were ranked in one class, with everyone else lumped in another. Even so, there were many gray areas and many who were dissatisfied with the results.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I think I&#39;ve addressed most of the points raised by others, there are two specific questions deserving separate treatment<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;naomasa298&quot; &lt;shanesuebsahakarn@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At that stage, you were either born a samurai or you weren&#39;t, but <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure there were exceptions.

Of what period are you speaking? Over the eight centuries or so of samurai history, routes of entry changed enormously.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Sengoku, with its great expansion of infantry forces, it was entirely possible for a farmboy to become first an ashigaru and then a &quot;real&quot; samurai (the ashigaru not having been altogether assimilated to samurai status at that point) based on ability. Need I mention Hideyoshi? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Tokugawa, of course, there was vanishingly small opportunity for assimilation to the samurai class through individual military merit (a source of much unrest early in the period), but there were a number of other accesses to the lower rungs of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Japan, as in most societies, there seem always to have been rites of passage into manhood which occurred about the time of puberty. It was at this point that the youth of samurai family took adult dress and hairstyle, and began carrying the long and short. The extent to which such striplings actually fought varied, of course. But we are told that Ieyasu (then Motonobu), for instance came officially of age at 15 and first fought at 17, leading his exigent forces in a border expedition. He was by then a married man.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I recall correctly, the youngest of the 47 ronin was a lad of 15. He alone of the plotters was not condemned, on account of his youth, but he had participated in the attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill O&#39;Neil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
