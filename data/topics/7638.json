            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1035383009\">Samurai Film Retrospective<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAn Oak Street Cinema Samurai Cinema Retrospective will present six <br/>\nof sword wielding action epics genre&#39;s greatest films in a series <br/>\nspanning Sept 2-22 at the theater located at 309 Oak Street, <br/>\nMinneapolis (just a half block off Washington Avenue SE on the U of <br/>\nM East Bank campus). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe films include: &quot;Samurai Rebellion&quot; and &quot;Harakiri&quot; from director <br/>\nMasaki Kobayashi; &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; from <br/>\ndirector Akira Kurosawa; and &quot;Sword of Doom&quot; and &quot;Kill!&quot; from <br/>\ndirector Kihachi Okamoto.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe series begins with a new 35mm print of Samurai Rebellion on <br/>\nFriday, September 2 through Sept. 5 at 7:20, 9:40 nightly; Saturday <br/>\nat 2:30 and 5:00. Samurai Rebellion was made in 1967 and was <br/>\ndirected by Masaki Kobayashi. It stars Toshiro Mifune, Yoko Tsukasa, <br/>\nand Tatsuya Nakadai. Mifune, a legend in Japan cinema, stars as <br/>\nIsaburo, an aging swordsman living a quiet life. When his lord <br/>\nbegins making unreasonable demands, however, Isaburo has enough and <br/>\nthe peaceful family man takes a stand against injustice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second film in the series is Hidden Fortress, which will screen <br/>\non Wednesday, Sept 7 and Sept. 8 at 7:00, 9:40 nightly. Director <br/>\nAkira Kurosawa&#39;s 1958 film stars Toshiro Mifune and Minoru Chiaki as <br/>\na general and a princess that must dodge enemy clans while smuggling <br/>\nthe royal treasure out of hostile territory with two bumbling, <br/>\nconniving peasants at their sides. The film inspired Star Wars.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe series continues with a new 35mm print of Harakiri from Friday, <br/>\nSept 9 through Monday, Sept 12, at 7:00, 9:40 nightly; and Saturday <br/>\nat 1:30, 4:15. Harakiri was produced in 1962 by director Masaki <br/>\nKobayashi and stars Tatsuya Nakadai and Rentaro Mikuni. Following <br/>\nthe collapse of his clan, unemployed samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo <br/>\n(Nakadai) arrives at the manor of Lord Iyi, begging to commit ritual <br/>\nsuicide on his property. Iyi&#39;s clansmen, believing the desperate <br/>\nronin is merely angling for charity, try to force him to eviscerate <br/>\nhimselfÂ—but they have underestimated his honor and his past. Winner <br/>\nof the 1963 Cannes Special Jury Prize, the films portrays feudal <br/>\nauthority and hypocrisy.<br/>\n<br/>\nA new 35mm print of Sword of Doom follows on Thursday, Sept 15 <br/>\nthrough Sept 17, at 7:20, 9:40 nightly; and Saturday at 2:30, 5:00. <br/>\nThe film was produced in 1966 by director Kihachi Okamoto and stars <br/>\nTatsuya Nakadai and Toshiro Mifune in the story of a wandering <br/>\nsamurai who finds violence at every turn. Full of carnage and not <br/>\nfor the faint of heart, the film traces the slow disintegration of <br/>\naristocratic, savage loner Ryunosuke (Nakadai), whose murderous <br/>\ndetermination bypasses any sense of mercy or remorse. This samurai <br/>\nclassic is a jaw-dropping exploration of good and evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe series continues on Sunday, Sept 18 and Monday, Sept 19 with a <br/>\nnew 35mm print of &quot;Kill!&quot; at 7:20, 9:40 nightly. The film was <br/>\nproduced in 1968 by director Kihachi Okamoto and stars Tatsuya <br/>\nNakadai and Etsushi Takahashi. This dark-humored action film follows <br/>\nthe story of a pair of down-on-their-luck swordsmen arrive in a <br/>\nwindblown town and become involved in a local clan dispute. One <br/>\nlongs to become a noble samurai while the other prefers living <br/>\nanonymously with gangsters. But when they discover the wrongdoings <br/>\nof the nefarious leader, they side with a band of rebels who are <br/>\nunder siege at a remote mountain cabin. Though true to samurai <br/>\nconvention, Okamoto&#39;s film technique borrows from chanbara classics <br/>\nand has a bit of Spaghetti Western feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong considered the epic masterpiece of samurai film, director Akira <br/>\nKurosawa&#39;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; will be screened on Sept 21 and Sept 22 <br/>\nat 7:30 nightly. The 1954 film stars Toshiro Mifune and Takashi <br/>\nShimura in a film that seamlessly weaves philosophy and <br/>\nentertainment, delicate human emotions and relentless action. Seven <br/>\nSamurai became the foundation for action films from the Spaghetti <br/>\nWestern to the urban shoot-em-ups of the 1980s. <br/>\n<br/>\nOak Street Cinema is a nonprofit single-screen movie house in <br/>\nMinneapolis. It is located at 309 Oak Street SE at the corner of Oak <br/>\nSt. & Washington Ave SE.
