However, I would recommend a recently published book to give you an overall feel and vision of the times: &quot;Samurai, an illustrated history&quot; by Mitsuo Kure, 2001; published by  Tuttle - plenty of full coloured photos of re-enactors, banners and battle plans.  And I suppose reading a few novels of the time would provide some faction base - Clavell&#39;s &quot;SHOGUN&quot; must be regarded as essential..<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with the writing....<br/>\n                                                    Rod Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside I used to enjoy the old western movies - I knew they were mostly factually incorrect - but it was entertainment!! So it is not unexpected that I look forward to &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; [and I will probably buy the video (or DVD) when it comes out]. I didn&#39;t look for wrist watches, telegraph poles and jet trails in the sky on &quot;Waterloo&quot;, so I enjoyed it....  Treat &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; as entertainment, we couldn&#39;t look to Shakespear for history lessons! And it may even give another generation interest in &quot;our&quot; subject as the novel SHOGUN did........<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-711409325\">Thanks a lot for your answers. As for a feel of the genre I have been <br/>\nwatching Kurosawa films, but I&#39;m also eyeing Yoshikawa&#39;s &quot;Musashi&quot; <br/>\n(that is set is the same timeframe). <br/>\n<br/>\nFor references these are the ones I have come up so far that have <br/>\ngrabbed my attention:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sekigahara 1600&quot; - also set in the timeframe I&#39;m looking for, and I <br/>\nwould also like some insight into samurai battle strategies. This <br/>\nbook apparently has this; do anyone here own the book?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Samurai Warfare&quot; - again, a good insight into samurai....well, <br/>\nwarfare. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Samurai Warlords&quot; and other Turnbull books.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Musashi&quot; - as you said, a feel for the genre.<br/>\n<br/>\np.d. I wanted to know the meaning of the name &quot;Iwamura&quot; in case I can <br/>\napply a metaphorical meaning to it. The meaning turns out to be <br/>\nperfect (Rock village) for the story...in this way I would like to <br/>\nfind out meanings on other names, to make them &quot;fit&quot; the character <br/>\n(another one is Makoto, which I believe means &quot;honor&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nMiburo Sam <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;William&Mikiko Letham&quot; <br/>\n&lt;mickey.letham@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; .&quot; In what year did Tokugawa Ieyasu pass the edict that allied lords<br/>\n&gt; had to spend some time in or near Edo?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Sankin Kotai system was a gradual process that developed over <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the reigns<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of Ieyasu, Hidetada, and Iemitsu.
