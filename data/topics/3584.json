All ties to the the class of samurai had been legally severed. Why take a chance of validating a soldier&#39;s claim to that status by bringing back the &quot;soul of the samurai&quot;? In essence the Japanese government was reinstating the rank of samurai without the class or privileges by letting them carry swords again. A person might humbly say that they are not samurai but in their heart of hearts they feel they are and that no matter what the government says they still remain samurai.<br/>\n  Now on the darker side:<br/>\n  There was a military uprising in the 1970&#39;s by a general who wanted to go back to the days of Imperial japan and reinstate the class of samurai by force. But only a handful of soldiers joined him. Everyone else shouted him down as a crazy man. He committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- Chris Ketterling &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisketterling1@...\">chrisketterling1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Okay, but why a Katana instead of a Calvary sword<br/>\n  &gt; like other (US) militaries.

You seem to have blended the original post by Mr. Wilson and my response to his post, in which I was defending the Japanese as not being &quot;sellouts&quot; but as being skilled at adapting their culture to the times, and particularly, in taking from other cultures and improving upon them. Kanji, buddhism, airplanes, electronics, and the get-rid-of-the-samurai-and-modernize-movement are all part of that cultural quality. The japanese did not invent any of those things. They simply learned/took from other cultures and improved upon them. If you want justification for the inclusion of airplanes in that list... the americans invented the airplane, but in WWII it was the Japanese Zero that was king of the skies, not the American P-51 Mustang. As for electronics... again, Americans were at the helm of this... Thomas Edison, for example, and americans invented the computer, too. But what country makes the most/best computers? Japan. Sony and Hitachi and Toshiba generally make the best electronic equipment... TV&#39;s and computers and such. Japanese companies. Though America  has experienced a resurgence in quality with the Apple Macintosh brand, but it is still struggling with popularity. (I&#39;m typing on a iMac right now). Similarly, who makes the most reliable engines for vehicles? It ain&#39;t Ford! Get a Honda or a Toyota, a Lexus or an Acura, if you want reliability. Same with motorcycles. The Japanese have long made the best engines... Hondas, Suzukis, Kawasakis... all way better than the old Harley Davidson (I&#39;ve owned a Harley, a honda, a suzuki, and now I have a Buell... which the Buell is supposed to be an American response to the Japanese sportbike). Again, Americans invented the motorcycle, but Japan makes the best ones. Shoot, even my american made Buell has a Japanese suspension!<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting rid of the sword carrying Samurai class and modernizing is simply an example of that cultural adaptation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I&#39;ve explained my point well enough. As Nate responded, the Japanese aren&#39;t &quot;sellouts&quot; anymore than the rest of us. But if I were to make a generalized statement of opinion, I would say Americans were adventurous innovators, and the Japanese were creative assimilators. Seems like americans invent the stuff, and then the Japanese make it better. (But Macs still rule...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Mr. Wilson,<br/>\n&gt; Forgive me if I disagree with you on some points...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sellouts? Adaption is a common way of all biolagical critters...but<br/>\n&gt; selling out involves monetary or other similar compensation - <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kanji - yes, they found that the Chinese had a functional writing<br/>\n&gt; system and adopted it - but remember that they added verb ending usage<br/>\n&gt; to a Chinese system that used none...How was that a sellout? What<br/>\n&gt; country did your particular writing system come from?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Buddhism - remember that they added a tollerance for other religions<br/>\n&gt; that strict Buddhism from India did not espouse...<br/>\n&gt; They had indigionous religious systems and simply added Buddhism to<br/>\n&gt; the pile - they did not replace their religions...(I am also a<br/>\n&gt; Buddhist, but that is a side note...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Airplanes - quite post-period, but if it is pertanent, I ask you off<br/>\n&gt; list to write me and inform me of what Japanese only improvements did<br/>\n&gt; they add to the basic idea of aircraft?<br/>\n&gt; Electronics? Again, post period and beyond this list&#39;s discussion<br/>\n&gt; protocal...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In a way, getting rid of the samurai was a very Japanese thing to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just do not get this part of your post - Getting rid of Samurai<br/>\n&gt; might be a result of the possible history lines that Japan might have<br/>\n&gt; chosen, as any country with a cast system might have done - but I do<br/>\n&gt; not understand your reference to it being a &quot;very Japanese&quot; thing to<br/>\n&gt; do... Assimilating - yes, I can see that...Purging - that depended<br/>\n&gt; more on circumstance, rather that a national requirement...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your argument seems to be self contradictory...<br/>\n&gt; Please illuminate for us...<br/>\n&gt; No offence - I am just curious...<br/>\n&gt; Christopher...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, golfmandan@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Japanese have always been &quot;sellouts&quot; in a certain way. That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; part of what makes them so uniquely, well, Japanese. What I mean is<br/>\n&gt; that one of Japan&#39;s strong points has been their ability to take parts<br/>\n&gt; of other cultures and adapt them to their own use, usually improving<br/>\n&gt; upon them in the process. Whether it&#39;s kanji, or buddhism, or<br/>\n&gt; airplanes, or electronics... the japanese have a knack for learning<br/>\n&gt; from other cultures. Yeah, they might be &quot;losing&quot; something in the<br/>\n&gt; process, but that&#39;s just part of the inevitable evolution that all<br/>\n&gt; cultures undergo. Speaking of which, the loss of the samurai class is<br/>\n&gt; part of that process. In a way, getting rid of the samurai was a very<br/>\n&gt; Japanese thing to do. LOL. The thing that WASN&#39;T very Japanese-like<br/>\n&gt; was their attempt at isolationism practiced before the Meiji restoration. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Anyway we should note that Mishima was not really looking for<br/>\n&gt; militarism, but a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; returnto Japan&#39;s past, what he felt made Japan uniquely Japanese.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is that really such a bad thing?? Im gonna have to mve to Japan in<br/>\n&gt; a few years.. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at first I was not looking foreward to it, mostly bcos I dont<br/>\n&gt; speak the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; language.. but many ppl have been telling me I&#39;ll do just fine<br/>\n&gt; that they are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very westernized and most ppl, especially the younger ones (in my<br/>\n&gt; age backet) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speak english.. (on a side note, according to the NY times Wed.<br/>\n&gt; Oct 23, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2002..&quot;To Grandparents english word trend isnt naissu&quot;) *hooray I<br/>\n&gt; actually have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a refference* the Japanese are adopting English words into their<br/>\n&gt; own language.. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; History, tradition and a sense of who I am culturaly is really<br/>\n&gt; important to me.. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so on one hand I was pretty relieved to hear that they are<br/>\n&gt; westernizing and that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will get along fine over there, but on the other hand, I feel<br/>\n&gt; sorry bcos in a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way they are loosing that.. it seems Mishima was in his<br/>\n&gt; own....whacko little <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way, was just trying to point this out to ppl.. does anyone else<br/>\n&gt; not see this or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see modern Japan as being &quot;sell outs&quot; in a way??<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wilson<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Find what you are looking for with the Lycos Yellow Pages<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://r.lycos.com/r/yp_emailfooter/http://yellowpages.lycos.com/default.asp?SRC\">http://r.lycos.com/r/yp_emailfooter/http://yellowpages.lycos.com/default.asp?SRC</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =lycos10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\">http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!

Be careful what<br/>\nyou assume by &quot;speak english&quot;--many are familiar with<br/>\nthe language, can read it (mostly), but SPEAKING it is<br/>\nsomething entirely different. Many people can speak<br/>\nenough to help you find the grocery store or show you<br/>\nan English menu, but I wouldn&#39;t expect in depth<br/>\nconversations on astro-physics. <br/>\n<br/>\nthe Japanese are adopting English words<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; into their own language..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And making them Japanese. One of the hardest things<br/>\nfor me in Japanese is trying to figure out what the<br/>\n&quot;adopted&quot; english word is when a Japanese says it. I<br/>\nhad to look up a few--&quot;Borantia&quot; (Volunteer) is the<br/>\nexample that comes to mind, but frequently the words<br/>\nare used out of normal English context or are just<br/>\nplain unrecognizable. <br/>\n<br/>\n History, tradition and a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sense of who I am culturaly is really important to<br/>\n&gt; me.. so on one hand I was pretty relieved to hear<br/>\n&gt; that they are westernizing and that I will get along<br/>\n&gt; fine over there, but on the other hand, I feel sorry<br/>\n&gt; bcos in a way they are loosing that.. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Japan is still Japan, always will be. Are Americans<br/>\nany less American because they don&#39;t wear cowboy hats<br/>\nand six-shooters? Even Japan&#39;s modernization is<br/>\nuniquely Japanese--I wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;Westernizing&quot;.<br/>\nFor example, any of us from the West can tell you that<br/>\nyou walk into a Japanese McDonald&#39;s and it&#39;s a<br/>\ncompletely DIFFERENT experience than it is in the US<br/>\nor Europe. <br/>\n<br/>\nit seems<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mishima was in his own....whacko little way, was<br/>\n&gt; just trying to point this out to ppl.. does anyone<br/>\n&gt; else not see this or see modern Japan as being &quot;sell<br/>\n&gt; outs&quot; in a way??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No more than anyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to continue this discussion, but we<br/>\nshoudl probably take it to the modern history board.<br/>\nKitsuno, can you post the link again??<br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Whether it&#39;s kanji, or buddhism, or airplanes, or electronics... the japanese have a knack for learning from other cultures. Yeah, they might be &quot;losing&quot; something in the process, but that&#39;s just part of the inevitable evolution that all cultures undergo. Speaking of which, the loss of the samurai class is part of that process. In a way, getting rid of the samurai was a very Japanese thing to do. LOL.

The <br/>\n&gt; 30+ intervening years have done much to shape the<br/>\n&gt; thoughts of the Japanese <br/>\n&gt; (nation and people) as well as the opinions of those<br/>\n&gt; looking in from <br/>\n&gt; without.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having not lived here in the 70&#39;s (I was only around<br/>\nfor the second half of the decade anyways) I can&#39;t<br/>\ncomment on that, but I will say the Japan is probably<br/>\nthe most adamantly pacifist country I can think of,<br/>\nsocially speaking. Many Japanese are barely aware of<br/>\nthe existence of their own Jietai, or were before the<br/>\nwhole Iraq deployment thing. I find it highly ironic<br/>\nthat the countries in Asia still get upset at visits<br/>\nto Yasukuni and keep pointing to it as a leftover<br/>\nvestige of militarism and a sign that Japan might &quot;do<br/>\nit again.&quot; China&#39;s CLEARLY the bigger expansionist<br/>\nthreat. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I contend that the problem sending troops is a<br/>\n&gt; political one.  Koizumi, <br/>\n&gt; like most politicians, doesn&#39;t want to do anything<br/>\n&gt; unpopular with the <br/>\n&gt; people and so that is why it took them so long to<br/>\n&gt; get off their hands. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course. And if it goes badly, he&#39;s toast. But<br/>\ninternationally speaking it&#39;s about time Japan got off<br/>\nit&#39;s duff and did something in the world. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That this is not the only outlook in Japan is<br/>\n&gt; evidenced by the popularity <br/>\n&gt; of Mayor Ishihara.  He has been advocating getting<br/>\n&gt; rid of the <br/>\n&gt; non-aggression clause in the constituition (article<br/>\n&gt; 9 is it?) for some <br/>\n&gt; time, and yet remains wildly popular.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, Article 9. Limiting Japan&#39;s &quot;defense&quot; spending<br/>\nsince 1954. Of course, even when they stay under 1%<br/>\n(the unofficial limit--as far as I know Nakasone in<br/>\nthe 80&#39;s was the only one to go over that) of their<br/>\nbudget, it&#39;s still a huge defense expenditure compared<br/>\nto many countries around the world. Japan&#39;s military<br/>\nisn&#39;t huge, but it beats the pants technologically off<br/>\nof just about anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; should note that Mishima <br/>\n&gt; was not really looking for militarism, but a return<br/>\n&gt; to Japan&#39;s past, what <br/>\n&gt; he felt made Japan uniquely Japanese.  And that,<br/>\n&gt; more than militarism, was <br/>\n&gt; a return to reverence for the emperor and that<br/>\n&gt; (military) service should be <br/>\n&gt; in those terms, rather than in more secular ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, got it. You are definitely more up on Mishima<br/>\nthan me (not my area of interest, really.) The<br/>\nendstate of this discussion is that we agree that the<br/>\nfirst poster&#39;s question on this is erroneous--it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a general, it was Mishima, and it wasn&#39;t even<br/>\nreally a coup attempt. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -Shannon<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I got spurs, and I even wear them to work sometimes...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ain&#39;t CAV, you ain&#39;t KUSSOO!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Allow me a little<br/>\nhyperbole.)

He&#39;s a case study in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n He wrote a comment on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hagakure, he started to <br/>\n&gt; lift weights and study Kendo in his 30s (as a way to<br/>\n&gt; exemplify bunbu <br/>\n&gt; ryodou), and wrote a book called wakaki samurai no<br/>\n&gt; tame ni.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is also the same time he became homosexual, is it<br/>\nnot? I believe, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, that he felt<br/>\nthat masculine love was a virtue, like many samurai<br/>\ndid, and Ihara Saikaku (speaking of authors). <br/>\n<br/>\nInsane or not, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there is much to mine their for material for<br/>\n&gt; research and such.

It&#39;s<br/>\nbeen too long. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to debate his literary merits--he&#39;s<br/>\ndefinitely got a place in the pantheon of Japanese, if<br/>\nnot world, literature. Many writers who are &quot;great&quot;<br/>\nare writers who I wouldn&#39;t read if stranded on a<br/>\ndeserted island with their collected works--pick a<br/>\nRussian writer and give me his name and I&#39;ll<br/>\nimmediately fall asleep. That&#39;s not a reflection on<br/>\ntheir writing per se, it&#39;s a reflection on my attitude<br/>\ntowards their writing. As I said, I&#39;ve got nothing<br/>\nagainst Japanese modern fiction--while I think Oe<br/>\nKenzaburo and Abe Kobo are boring and I&#39;d rather pluck<br/>\nmy eyelashes out, I simply LOVE Murakami Haruki,<br/>\nKawabata Yasunari, Natsume Soseki, etc. My FAVORITE<br/>\nbook of all time is probably either &quot;South of the<br/>\nBorder, West of the Sun&quot; or &quot;Sputnik Sweetheart&quot; by<br/>\nMurakami or &quot;All She Was Worth&quot;, the best mystery I&#39;ve<br/>\never read, by Miyabe Miyuki.

So here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the concept of Japanese re-militarization may be &quot;laughable&quot; today -- <br/>\nthough I disagree -- the case today is not the same as it was in 1970.  The <br/>\n30+ intervening years have done much to shape the thoughts of the Japanese <br/>\n(nation and people) as well as the opinions of those looking in from <br/>\nwithout.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI contend that the problem sending troops is a political one.  Koizumi, <br/>\nlike most politicians, doesn&#39;t want to do anything unpopular with the <br/>\npeople and so that is why it took them so long to get off their hands.  <br/>\nThat this is not the only outlook in Japan is evidenced by the popularity <br/>\nof Mayor Ishihara.  He has been advocating getting rid of the <br/>\nnon-aggression clause in the constituition (article 9 is it?) for some <br/>\ntime, and yet remains wildly popular.  Anyway we should note that Mishima <br/>\nwas not really looking for militarism, but a return to Japan&#39;s past, what <br/>\nhe felt made Japan uniquely Japanese.  And that, more than militarism, was <br/>\na return to reverence for the emperor and that (military) service should be <br/>\nin those terms, rather than in more secular ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shannon<br/>\n&quot;I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Anthony J.

All ties to the the class of samurai had been legally severed. Why take a chance of validating a soldier&#39;s claim to that status by bringing back the &quot;soul of the samurai&quot;? In essence the Japanese government was reinstating the rank of samurai without the class or privileges by letting them carry swords again. A person might humbly say that they are not samurai but in their heart of hearts they feel they are and that no matter what the government says they still remain samurai.<br/>\n Now on the darker side:<br/>\nThere was a military uprising in the 1970&#39;s by a general who wanted to go back to the days of Imperial japan and reinstate the class of samurai by force. But only a handful of soldiers joined him. Everyone else shouted him down as a crazy man. He committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Chris Ketterling &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisketterling1@...\">chrisketterling1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Okay, but why a Katana instead of a Calvary sword<br/>\n&gt; like other (US) militaries.

Of the officers and nco&#39;s,<br/>\n(the people who actually took swords into battle in WW2) many of them had<br/>\ntraining in iado, kendo and kenjutsu. They complained that the kyugunto, a<br/>\nwestern style saber used during the Russo-Japanese war until the mid 1930s<br/>\nwas to brittle and inflexable for combat and it also did not allow for a two<br/>\nhanded grip. Also there were strong nationalistic feelings at the time and<br/>\nmany people thought that they should be using there own swords instead of<br/>\ncopying an inferior western style. at the time of WW2 an officer could<br/>\npurchase a machine made sword, or for extra cost he could order a handmade<br/>\none. In addition many officers were decended from samurai and many family<br/>\nswords were remounted in military mounts and taken to war. I am sure there<br/>\nwas a great deal of pride in taking great grandads sword to war.(some of<br/>\nwhich had family mons on the mounts)<br/>\nI dont think they thought the were samurai, but I am sure that they saw<br/>\nthemselves in a similer light, same ideals and values anyway.(When they<br/>\nasked a group of fighter pilots if anyone would fly a plane into a ship the<br/>\nresponse was allways almost 100% YES!!) I have couple of WW2 mounted swords,<br/>\none is late war poor quality and machine made, the other dates from the mid<br/>\n1500s.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1500046492\">Tony, not to dispute you, but why was your response about the officers considering themselves samurai incorrect?? In WWI, the cavalry still consisted of horses, but by WWII, the cavalry was tanks and such.. if yor in a tank w/ a biiiiiiiiig cannon on the front, whats the point of a sword?? hence why the sword became a dress item, it no longer had a functional purpose.. However I have seen many pictures in textbooks and on the history channel and such showing the Japanese at prison camps using the swords to behead POWs.. I also heard on the history channel that they did consider themselves samurai, even tho they knew they werent.. So I jsut wondered what else you had to say about the subject and where you got your info.. I am, unfortunately, notorious for not having specific referrences, sorry I cant supply any..<br/>\n<br/>\nWilson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...

Among <br/>\nother things, they were able to rattle off all of Oda Nobunagas aunts, uncles, <br/>\nbrothers, and sisters, and knew who was adopted by who and knew both the titles <br/>\nand adopted names of pretty much anyone you could think of.  They had them up <br/>\nagainst random people on the street, then college-level history students and <br/>\neventually up against a professor of Sengoku history at Shizuoka university.  They <br/>\nknew the sengoku inside out, but lost to the professor by one question - one of <br/>\nthe only questions I actually knew the answer to...!  The question was:  What was <br/>\nthe original full name of the warrior who lead the battle against Mori Motonari at <br/>\nthe battle of Itsukushima? (Sue Takafusa).  Although the two kids stumped the <br/>\nprofessor after the little competition with the following question:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What was the biggest event of 1601?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it, then check the answer below:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The first aniversary of the battle of Sekigahara&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nClassic stuff.  ;)</div>",
