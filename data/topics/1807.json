Part of the reason <br/>\n&gt; for this of course is that other cultures didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to pray at exact <br/>\n&gt; times like the Catholic church of the period<br/>\n&gt; insisted on. I do remember <br/>\n&gt; seeing a book on the subject but if I recollect<br/>\n&gt; properly, clockmaking <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t get started until the Jesuits show up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still cool for later period stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some stuff off a website:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have a number of such books on general or<br/>\n&gt; specific technologies <br/>\n&gt; published during the period, as never existed in the<br/>\n&gt; preceding era. <br/>\n&gt; Progress in printing and the demand for information<br/>\n&gt; from industrialists <br/>\n&gt; stimulated their publication. Number, variety and<br/>\n&gt; contents of these <br/>\n&gt; books far more superseded those written in the<br/>\n&gt; contemporary China, and <br/>\n&gt; we may compare them with the Renaissance and Baroque<br/>\n&gt; technical books of <br/>\n&gt; Europe. Most of them are reprinted with commentary<br/>\n&gt; and notes by modern <br/>\n&gt; editors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We can classify these books in several categories:<br/>\n&gt; first, compendium or <br/>\n&gt; encyclopedia; second, picture book; third, practical<br/>\n&gt; text; and fourth, <br/>\n&gt; memorandum of practioner. Karakuri-kimmo-kagamigusa<br/>\n&gt; (automaton) 1730; <br/>\n&gt; Karakuri-zui (clock & automaton) 1796; &lt;snip snip<br/>\n&gt; snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In addition to these books local historians are<br/>\n&gt; searching for materials <br/>\n&gt; of related subjects in unpublished letters or<br/>\n&gt; reports.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The first mechanical clocks introduced to Japan were<br/>\n&gt; probably Italian <br/>\n&gt; and Dutch clocks presented as gifts by European<br/>\n&gt; merchants in the early <br/>\n&gt; to mid sixteenth century. Between 1550 and 1650<br/>\n&gt; there was a strong <br/>\n&gt; missionary influence in Japan, particularly the<br/>\n&gt; Jesuits, who taught <br/>\n&gt; clock making. In 1650 all Europeans were ejected<br/>\n&gt; from Japan with the <br/>\n&gt; exception of a small European enclave at Nagasaki.<br/>\n&gt; Early Japanese clocks <br/>\n&gt; therefore used Western technology to keep the<br/>\n&gt; Chino/Japanese time system.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This time system divides the day into two parts,<br/>\n&gt; each with six two hours <br/>\n&gt; periods. The first is from sun up to sun down and<br/>\n&gt; the second from sun <br/>\n&gt; down to sun up. The problem is obviously that with<br/>\n&gt; changing seasons the <br/>\n&gt; dark hours and the light hours will be relatively<br/>\n&gt; longer or shorter. <br/>\n&gt; This resulted in two kinds of clock, one with a<br/>\n&gt; variable running speed <br/>\n&gt; and fixed markers or one with a constant running<br/>\n&gt; speed and movable markers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In 1853 Perry re-established a European presence in<br/>\n&gt; Japan and in 1873 <br/>\n&gt; the Japanese revoked their traditional time keeping<br/>\n&gt; system and adopted <br/>\n&gt; Western time keeping. Traditional Japanese clocks<br/>\n&gt; have therefore become <br/>\n&gt; very collectible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More:!<br/>\n&gt; When the Dutch factory chief Isaac Titsingh left<br/>\n&gt; Japan in 1784, he <br/>\n&gt; decided to take home a local timepiece. He was<br/>\n&gt; furious with the <br/>\n&gt; shogunate for its intransigence and stymieing of<br/>\n&gt; trade, and feigned <br/>\n&gt; illness to be relieved on his post ahead of<br/>\n&gt; schedule. But the clocks of <br/>\n&gt; Japan were something for which he had nothing but<br/>\n&gt; admiration. &quot;I <br/>\n&gt; examined a clock&quot;, he wrote on his return, &quot;in the<br/>\n&gt; palace of the <br/>\n&gt; governor of Nagasaki; and as the construction seemed<br/>\n&gt; curious, I was <br/>\n&gt; desirous of bringing one with me from Japan.&quot; Yet<br/>\n&gt; trade being fettered <br/>\n&gt; as it was, &quot;the high price demanded for them<br/>\n&gt; deprived me of this <br/>\n&gt; gratification&quot; (Isaac Titsingh, /Illustrations of<br/>\n&gt; Japan/, 1822; p.159). <br/>\n&gt; Fortunately later travellers were better heeled, and<br/>\n&gt; there are clock <br/>\n&gt; collections in the West. But we have waited until<br/>\n&gt; now for a proper <br/>\n&gt; exhibition of Japanese clocks in all their<br/>\n&gt; &#39;curiousness&#39;. This wonderful <br/>\n&gt; show (which goes far beyond just clocks) should not<br/>\n&gt; be missed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many items used in Japanese time-keeping are not<br/>\n&gt; indigenous, and had <br/>\n&gt; Titsingh looked closer, he might have seen workings<br/>\n&gt; not dissimilar to <br/>\n&gt; European ones; very possibly the governor&#39;s clock<br/>\n&gt; included imported <br/>\n&gt; parts. Steel springs could not be made in Japan,<br/>\n&gt; neither could small <br/>\n&gt; cogwheels. In fact, clocks and pocket watches were<br/>\n&gt; extensively imported <br/>\n&gt; to Japan, where the latter became known as &quot;London<br/>\n&gt; clocks&quot; <br/>\n&gt; (/rondon-dokei/); it is often forgotten that England<br/>\n&gt; lost its <br/>\n&gt; horological priority to Switzerland only in the 19th<br/>\n&gt; century. A samurai <br/>\n&gt; and wit, Ota Nanpo, wrote of the situation in Edo at<br/>\n&gt; just the moment <br/>\n&gt; Titsingh was in town. &quot;No-one was without an<br/>\n&gt; imported European clock <br/>\n&gt; slipped in at his breast&quot; (Ota Nanpo, &#39;Ichiwa<br/>\n&gt; ichigon&#39;, in /Zoku nihon <br/>\n&gt; zuihitsu taisei/, supplement, 1978, p.197).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Time is told differently in different parts of the<br/>\n&gt; globe, and it was a <br/>\n&gt; feature of Japanese time telling to assign six hours<br/>\n&gt; to daylight and six <br/>\n&gt; to darkness. This meant that, other than at the<br/>\n&gt; equinoxes, a day-time <br/>\n&gt; and a night-time hour were not the same, and that<br/>\n&gt; they fluctuated <br/>\n&gt; against each other throughout the year. Full time<br/>\n&gt; &#39;masters of clocks&#39; <br/>\n&gt; (/tokeishi/) regulated the weights that hung from<br/>\n&gt; the gyrating spindles <br/>\n&gt; to retard or quicken movement. Not for nothing went<br/>\n&gt; the comic verse,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However cunningly made,<br/>\n&gt; A clock&#39;s workings<br/>\n&gt; Are just too many<br/>\n&gt; \t\t/D� kuf� shite mo tokei/<br/>\n&gt; /no wa ga amari/<br/>\n&gt; /Haif� yanagi-daru/<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;JavaScript: newWindow = RevealWin(<br/>\n&gt; &#39;P00852_I00721_01123_pop.html&#39;, <br/>\n&gt; &#39;screech3006_1&#39;,229,455,1);&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;JavaScript: newWindow = RevealWin(<br/>\n&gt; &#39;P00852_I00721_01123_pop.html&#39;, <br/>\n&gt; &#39;screech3006_1&#39;,229,455,1);&gt;*Mechanical Japanese<br/>\n&gt; Clock*<br/>\n&gt; Japan, Edo period (1615-1868)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Time in Japan&#39;s cities was mostly measured by the<br/>\n&gt; booming of hour-bells <br/>\n&gt; (/toki no kane/), either those erected for the<br/>\n&gt; purpose, or those <br/>\n&gt; co-opted from local temples. The bell at the city<br/>\n&gt; entrance to Edo rang <br/>\n&gt; an hour ahead to ensure those going to attend at the<br/>\n&gt; castle would never <br/>\n&gt; be late. Edo&#39;s main hour-bell was in Kokuch�, which<br/>\n&gt; happened to be by <br/>\n&gt; the Dutch East India Company&#39;s hostel. This spawned<br/>\n&gt; many jokes of a <br/>\n&gt; culturally relative kind.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is fundamentally an art exhibition, and the<br/>\n&gt; technical pieces on <br/>\n&gt; display are mostly given the backdrop of a painting<br/>\n&gt; or print <br/>\n&gt; illustrating them in real spaces. /Ukiyo-e/ prints �<br/>\n&gt; the forte of <br/>\n&gt; Timothy Clark who curated this show � are copiously<br/>\n&gt; used in evidence. <br/>\n&gt; More than half of the gallery is given over to other<br/>\n&gt; instances of <br/>\n&gt; time-telling, such as representations of the signs<br/>\n&gt; of the so-called <br/>\n&gt; Chinese Zodiac (actually not a zodiac at all), with<br/>\n&gt; which most people <br/>\n&gt; today are familiar. These signs (monkey, cock,<br/>\n&gt; tiger, etc.) were used in <br/>\n&gt; fashion ornaments, such as /netsuke/ toggles, or<br/>\n&gt; were the subject of <br/>\n&gt; full-blown paintings. A painting of a dragon, for<br/>\n&gt; example, would be <br/>\n&gt; appropriate to put out in a Year of the Dragon (like<br/>\n&gt; 2000), and as the <br/>\n&gt; signs came around every 12 years, it was worth the<br/>\n&gt; cost of buying such <br/>\n&gt; things, each according to their budget. People might<br/>\n&gt; display the sign of <br/>\n&gt; their birth, and the grave of the third Shogun,<br/>\n&gt; Iemitsu, is covered with <br/>\n&gt; hares, as this was his natal sign.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The cycle of the year has a place in the heart of<br/>\n&gt; anyone who has <br/>\n&gt; received a Japanese education, and paintings of the<br/>\n&gt; four seasons, the <br/>\n&gt; twelve months, or the festivals and events proper to<br/>\n&gt; these are all <br/>\n&gt; common in Japanese visual arts. It is a feature of<br/>\n&gt; Japanese painting, <br/>\n&gt; not seen elsewhere on the Asian continent, to depict<br/>\n&gt; a single landscape <br/>\n&gt; across a complete year, usually with two seasons per<br/>\n&gt; screen across a <br/>\n&gt; pair. Some good examples are on display in the Japan<br/>\n&gt; Time exhibition.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yet More!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; */A very rare and unusual watch. The Japanese based<br/>\n&gt; their method of <br/>\n&gt; timekeeping on a Chinese system which is somewhat<br/>\n&gt; eccentric, the length <br/>\n&gt; of their periods of time altering throughout the<br/>\n&gt; year. Each 24 hour day <br/>\n&gt; is divided into its two natural sections, day and<br/>\n&gt; night. These are then <br/>\n&gt; divided into six equal parts. This necessitates<br/>\n&gt; allowing mechanical <br/>\n&gt; timekeepers to have adjustable markings. Timepieces<br/>\n&gt; made for the <br/>\n&gt; Japanese market are rare. This is the only example<br/>\n&gt; of a clockwatch we <br/>\n&gt; have seen. The case itself is also somewhat odd,<br/>\n&gt; being large and deep. <br/>\n&gt; It would have originally had a protective case or<br/>\n&gt; box made of leather or <br/>\n&gt; perhaps wood. /*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve probably bored you silly now.<br/>\n&gt; Sumimasen,<br/>\n&gt; Jim Eckman<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1300619097\">Some of the English and French clocks of the period have an insane <br/>\namount of dials that tracks tides, moonrise, sunset, etc. Clocks are one <br/>\nof the few areas where Europe was far ahead of the East starting in the <br/>\n12-1300&#39;s with the invention of the verge escapement. Part of the reason <br/>\nfor this of course is that other cultures didn&#39;t have to pray at exact <br/>\ntimes like the Catholic church of the period insisted on. I do remember <br/>\nseeing a book on the subject but if I recollect properly, clockmaking <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get started until the Jesuits show up.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill cool for later period stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome stuff off a website:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a number of such books on general or specific technologies <br/>\npublished during the period, as never existed in the preceding era. <br/>\nProgress in printing and the demand for information from industrialists <br/>\nstimulated their publication. Number, variety and contents of these <br/>\nbooks far more superseded those written in the contemporary China, and <br/>\nwe may compare them with the Renaissance and Baroque technical books of <br/>\nEurope. Most of them are reprinted with commentary and notes by modern <br/>\neditors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can classify these books in several categories: first, compendium or <br/>\nencyclopedia; second, picture book; third, practical text; and fourth, <br/>\nmemorandum of practioner. Karakuri-kimmo-kagamigusa (automaton) 1730; <br/>\nKarakuri-zui (clock & automaton) 1796; &lt;snip snip snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to these books local historians are searching for materials <br/>\nof related subjects in unpublished letters or reports.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first mechanical clocks introduced to Japan were probably Italian <br/>\nand Dutch clocks presented as gifts by European merchants in the early <br/>\nto mid sixteenth century. Between 1550 and 1650 there was a strong <br/>\nmissionary influence in Japan, particularly the Jesuits, who taught <br/>\nclock making. In 1650 all Europeans were ejected from Japan with the <br/>\nexception of a small European enclave at Nagasaki. Early Japanese clocks <br/>\ntherefore used Western technology to keep the Chino/Japanese time system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time system divides the day into two parts, each with six two hours <br/>\nperiods. The first is from sun up to sun down and the second from sun <br/>\ndown to sun up. The problem is obviously that with changing seasons the <br/>\ndark hours and the light hours will be relatively longer or shorter. <br/>\nThis resulted in two kinds of clock, one with a variable running speed <br/>\nand fixed markers or one with a constant running speed and movable markers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1853 Perry re-established a European presence in Japan and in 1873 <br/>\nthe Japanese revoked their traditional time keeping system and adopted <br/>\nWestern time keeping. Traditional Japanese clocks have therefore become <br/>\nvery collectible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore:!<br/>\nWhen the Dutch factory chief Isaac Titsingh left Japan in 1784, he <br/>\ndecided to take home a local timepiece. He was furious with the <br/>\nshogunate for its intransigence and stymieing of trade, and feigned <br/>\nillness to be relieved on his post ahead of schedule. But the clocks of <br/>\nJapan were something for which he had nothing but admiration. &quot;I <br/>\nexamined a clock&quot;, he wrote on his return, &quot;in the palace of the <br/>\ngovernor of Nagasaki; and as the construction seemed curious, I was <br/>\ndesirous of bringing one with me from Japan.&quot; Yet trade being fettered <br/>\nas it was, &quot;the high price demanded for them deprived me of this <br/>\ngratification&quot; (Isaac Titsingh, /Illustrations of Japan/, 1822; p.159). <br/>\nFortunately later travellers were better heeled, and there are clock <br/>\ncollections in the West. But we have waited until now for a proper <br/>\nexhibition of Japanese clocks in all their &#39;curiousness&#39;. This wonderful <br/>\nshow (which goes far beyond just clocks) should not be missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany items used in Japanese time-keeping are not indigenous, and had <br/>\nTitsingh looked closer, he might have seen workings not dissimilar to <br/>\nEuropean ones; very possibly the governor&#39;s clock included imported <br/>\nparts. Steel springs could not be made in Japan, neither could small <br/>\ncogwheels. In fact, clocks and pocket watches were extensively imported <br/>\nto Japan, where the latter became known as &quot;London clocks&quot; <br/>\n(/rondon-dokei/); it is often forgotten that England lost its <br/>\nhorological priority to Switzerland only in the 19th century. A samurai <br/>\nand wit, Ota Nanpo, wrote of the situation in Edo at just the moment <br/>\nTitsingh was in town. &quot;No-one was without an imported European clock <br/>\nslipped in at his breast&quot; (Ota Nanpo, &#39;Ichiwa ichigon&#39;, in /Zoku nihon <br/>\nzuihitsu taisei/, supplement, 1978, p.197).<br/>\n<br/>\nTime is told differently in different parts of the globe, and it was a <br/>\nfeature of Japanese time telling to assign six hours to daylight and six <br/>\nto darkness. This meant that, other than at the equinoxes, a day-time <br/>\nand a night-time hour were not the same, and that they fluctuated <br/>\nagainst each other throughout the year. Full time &#39;masters of clocks&#39; <br/>\n(/tokeishi/) regulated the weights that hung from the gyrating spindles <br/>\nto retard or quicken movement. Not for nothing went the comic verse,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever cunningly made,<br/>\nA clock&#39;s workings<br/>\nAre just too many<br/>\n\t\t/Dô kufû shite mo tokei/<br/>\n/no wa ga amari/<br/>\n/Haifû yanagi-daru/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;JavaScript: newWindow = RevealWin( &#39;P00852_I00721_01123_pop.html&#39;, <br/>\n&#39;screech3006_1&#39;,229,455,1);&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;JavaScript: newWindow = RevealWin( &#39;P00852_I00721_01123_pop.html&#39;, <br/>\n&#39;screech3006_1&#39;,229,455,1);&gt;*Mechanical Japanese Clock*<br/>\nJapan, Edo period (1615-1868)<br/>\n<br/>\nTime in Japan&#39;s cities was mostly measured by the booming of hour-bells <br/>\n(/toki no kane/), either those erected for the purpose, or those <br/>\nco-opted from local temples. The bell at the city entrance to Edo rang <br/>\nan hour ahead to ensure those going to attend at the castle would never <br/>\nbe late. Edo&#39;s main hour-bell was in Kokuchô, which happened to be by <br/>\nthe Dutch East India Company&#39;s hostel. This spawned many jokes of a <br/>\nculturally relative kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is fundamentally an art exhibition, and the technical pieces on <br/>\ndisplay are mostly given the backdrop of a painting or print <br/>\nillustrating them in real spaces. /Ukiyo-e/ prints – the forte of <br/>\nTimothy Clark who curated this show – are copiously used in evidence. <br/>\nMore than half of the gallery is given over to other instances of <br/>\ntime-telling, such as representations of the signs of the so-called <br/>\nChinese Zodiac (actually not a zodiac at all), with which most people <br/>\ntoday are familiar. These signs (monkey, cock, tiger, etc.) were used in <br/>\nfashion ornaments, such as /netsuke/ toggles, or were the subject of <br/>\nfull-blown paintings. A painting of a dragon, for example, would be <br/>\nappropriate to put out in a Year of the Dragon (like 2000), and as the <br/>\nsigns came around every 12 years, it was worth the cost of buying such <br/>\nthings, each according to their budget. People might display the sign of <br/>\ntheir birth, and the grave of the third Shogun, Iemitsu, is covered with <br/>\nhares, as this was his natal sign.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cycle of the year has a place in the heart of anyone who has <br/>\nreceived a Japanese education, and paintings of the four seasons, the <br/>\ntwelve months, or the festivals and events proper to these are all <br/>\ncommon in Japanese visual arts. It is a feature of Japanese painting, <br/>\nnot seen elsewhere on the Asian continent, to depict a single landscape <br/>\nacross a complete year, usually with two seasons per screen across a <br/>\npair. Some good examples are on display in the Japan Time exhibition.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet More!<br/>\n<br/>\n*/A very rare and unusual watch.
