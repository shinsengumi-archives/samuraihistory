There are several different plants <br/>\nused to make one sort of tea or another. There are several different <br/>\ntea ceremonies before you even start talking about tea schools. The <br/>\nearliest type of tea introduced to Japan was called dancha and is <br/>\npractically undrinkable. Or at least, it never became particularly <br/>\npopular. I suggest that you read one of the introductory tea books. For <br/>\nexample, there is one in English by Sen Shoshitsu. I believe that <br/>\nHerbert Plutschow has also written a book about tea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",

The whole story sounds pretty much wrong. The way to <br/>\nreally get on someone&#39;s nerves is to be excessively polite, not turning <br/>\na tea bowl backwards. The really big problem with turning a tea bowl <br/>\nbackwards is it makes yourself look bad. Not an all an acceptable <br/>\napproach for displaying pique. Incidentally, tea bowls are descended <br/>\nfrom Chinese herbal medicine bowls as are several other tea implements. <br/>\nIn theory, and occasionally in practice, every bowl has a spout for <br/>\nadministering medicine. Since you are not ill, you turn the bowl so <br/>\nthat spout points away from you. Also, Urasenke is one of the tea <br/>\nschools which is into threes.</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1607288609\">Matcha tea is the highest grade used for the tea ceremony. During <br/>\nharvesting only the small stems called tencha are used. Everyday <br/>\ntable tea is called bancha. The lowest grade generally harvested <br/>\nfrom the second or third cutting season. The first cutting in April <br/>\nis the best and brings the majority of the farmer&#39;s annual income. A <br/>\nstep up from Bancha is Sencha harvested from the top two leaves of <br/>\nthe tea bush. Here in Shizuoka Japan we grow gyokuro tea which is <br/>\nanother fine grade of tea. Also using only the first cutting the <br/>\nleaves are shaded two to three weeks before harvesting. This process <br/>\nlocks in the flavor. Inbetween these types are many mixes to produce <br/>\nunique flavors.
