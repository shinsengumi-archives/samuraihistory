My study of armor in Japan begins in the Muromachi <br/>\nPeriod, so I am relatively unaware of details of armor in preceding eras. As to <br/>\nwhy arm protection was phased out,  as Japan arguably entered its most violent <br/>\nera,  is a question whose answer would be difficult indeed.  My SO is  a whiz <br/>\non Japan,  I believe she lived there, so I might ask her sometime.  As <br/>\nalways,  great pleasure in talking to you,  Tom.
