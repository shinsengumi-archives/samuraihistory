In biblical theology, you will find a great deal of text dealing with what one should NOT do (sin)--the greatest example being the 10 commandment which is mostly a list of &quot;thou shall nots.&quot; It is a commonality among Western religions, but not something that a philosophy like Zen, for example, adheres to. In that case you dealing more with &quot;doing&quot; than with not doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure you could read idealistic literature like &quot;Hagakure&quot; and pull out some admonitions of what a samurai shouldn&#39;t do, but I view those more as advice than anything and not widespread law/rule. Using literature like that for historical purposes is a slippery enough slope as is... You may also look into clan policy or law, but as we have seen in Christian countries, religion and law are often miles apart. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only &quot;sin&quot; that stands out to me would be disloyalty/dishonoring ones _____. <br/>\n<br/>\nComing up with a general list of samurai sins seems like a tall order to me, but I&#39;d be interested in seeing what you come up with.
