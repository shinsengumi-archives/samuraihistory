            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-443177609\">Hi Nate, and everyone:<br/>\n<br/>\nClashing saya was a definite no-no and considered a challenge, <br/>\nand a challenge could never be refused.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1630 Maeda Higo, grandson of Toshiie, was crossing a bridge <br/>\nwith some friends when they met two samurai, Murase and Sakabe, <br/>\ncoming the other way. Higo and Sakabe&#39;s saya bumped together <br/>\naccidentally as they passed. Higo slapped Sakabe&#39;s shoulder <br/>\nwith his fan, and Sakabe drew his sword &#39;with a shout&#39;. Higo&#39;s <br/>\nfriends rallied to his cause, and soon Sakabe and Murase were <br/>\nkilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nHearing the news Murase&#39;s father rushed to the scene with sword <br/>\nin hand and killed two of Higo&#39;s retainers and injured a third <br/>\nbefore he was himself cut down. Sakabe&#39;s father came armed with <br/>\na spear, but the press of the crowd prevented him from getting <br/>\nclose enough to get involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe incident was reported to Lord Maeda, but no-one was <br/>\npunished. Sakabe&#39;s father, ashamed of his failure to exact <br/>\nrevenge, left the city and entered the priesthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nHigo apparently lived the rest of his life in constant fear of <br/>\nrevenge.<br/>\n(from &#39;Taming of the Samurai&#39; by Eiko Ikegami)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example shows the stupid lengths peacetime samurai <br/>\nwould go to to protect their pride and prove their courage. <br/>\nUnfortunately I can&#39;t recall the source, and have forgotten the <br/>\nnames of those involved, however:<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo samurai passed on a staircase in (I believe) Edo Castle. <br/>\nTheir sayas clashed as they did so, and each turned angrily on <br/>\nthe other.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the dilemma: The affront demands instant retribution, <br/>\nbut the guy going up the stairs is delivering a message to his <br/>\nmaster - if he gets involved in a fight he&#39;s placing his own <br/>\ninterests before his lord&#39;s, and that carries the death <br/>\npenalty. If the guy coming down cuts down the man going up, he <br/>\nis then preventing someone carrying out his master&#39;s business, <br/>\nso both men are caught on the same point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simple solution was to arrange a duel at a time convenient <br/>\nto both - but that&#39;s not what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat actually happened is that the guy coming down, determined <br/>\nto show he was not afraid to die, &#39;right here, right now,&#39; as <br/>\nit were, drew his sword and killed himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guy going up, not to be outdone, continued up, delivered <br/>\nhis message, then came back down and he too killed himself on <br/>\nthe same spot!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tokugawa problem was how to maintain the &#39;spirit of the <br/>\nsamurai&#39; as an ideal, which demands instant response to any <br/>\nquarrel (kenka), no matter its cause, whilst keeping the peace <br/>\nby a law called kenka ryoseibai, which demanded equally severe <br/>\npunishment for both parties.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a real mess, never fully resolved, and aggravated by the <br/>\nfact that the Tokugawa bureaucracy was notoriously uneven and <br/>\nindecisive when making decisions with regard to duels and <br/>\nvendettas. Sometimes men were beheaded for NOT getting involed <br/>\nin fights, which was seen as dishonouring their status as <br/>\nsamurai, other times men were beheaded for getting involved <br/>\nwhen they should have practiced restraint.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
