Different<br/>\norigins, same essential result. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe military, per se, didn&#39;t have a rank structure<br/>\nsuch as you would think of today. For instance, in the<br/>\nAshigaru ranks you&#39;d have someone appointed Captain of<br/>\nAshigaru, or Ashigaru-kashira, and under him would be<br/>\nan Ashigaru Kogashira, or &quot;little captain&quot;, but it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t necessarily that you went through these ranks,<br/>\ngot promoted or demoted or whatever. They were more<br/>\njob descriptions than ranks. Above them would be an<br/>\nAshigaru-Taisho (Ashigaru General), who&#39;d command a<br/>\nwhole lot of people. Generally speaking, a general is<br/>\na Taisho, but just about anyone could be a taisho--if<br/>\nyou commanded 1,000 or 100,000 men, you were a Taisho.<br/>\nThere was no difference necessarily in rank--just in<br/>\nprestige or power. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor court ranks, which are really what mattered to<br/>\nmost individuals, try<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.sengokydaimyo.com<br/>\n<br/>\nTony&#39;s got a whole huge explanation on there. <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n--- muds_theaz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:muds_theaz@...\">muds_theaz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi there,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently researching The Sengoku period.
