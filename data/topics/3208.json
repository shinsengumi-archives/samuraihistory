It&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt;as &quot;original&quot;, in the Sengoku way, but it is an<br/>\n&gt;original POST Sengoku castle, and besides it&#39;s better<br/>\n&gt;than Nagoya-jo (How many Daimyo had ELEVATORS<br/>\n&gt;installed????)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And when I went, a giant disco ball as well!!! They were having some <br/>\nmodern dance contest then, but it&#39;s way too electrified to feel real. On <br/>\nthe other hand wandering the woodworkers shops of Nagoya was awesome. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what they really thought of the nerd with the suit on but I <br/>\nwas invited into several and it was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Randall Edwards&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcma66@...\">tcma66@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Japanese History<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am relatively new to the group so this might be a stupid question but I <br/>\n&gt;was wondering if any of you could point me in the right direction of getting <br/>\n&gt;a degree in Japanese history.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First you have to buy a 100 pound sack of rice and consume it all. If <br/>\nyou can handle this part, you can major in Japanese history since after <br/>\ngraduating that will be all you can afford to eat ;) It&#39;s not a stupid <br/>\nquestion, but it is a silly answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
