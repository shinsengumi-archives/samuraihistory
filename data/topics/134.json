            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-217006376\">Well, as I mentioned, the &#39;-no kami&#39; title was for the most part honorific <br/>\nby the sengoku period.  The title seems to have become widespread in the <br/>\nKamakura Period, when it was based in fact (often being given to shugo <br/>\nhouses). By the Ashikaga age, the title was simply a sign of esteem.<br/>\nIn a similar vein, even more ancient titles were still being used in this <br/>\nhonorific fashion - Nakatsukasa, for example, was one of the 8 offices <br/>\nestablished by the ancient Yoro revision of the Tiaho Code.  As an example, <br/>\nTokugawa retainer Honda Tadakatsu was awarded the title Nakatsukasa-taiyu in <br/>\n1586 on a visit to Toyotomi Hideyoshi.  Obviously, Tadakatsu really had <br/>\nnothing to do with the &#39;Ministry of the Central Office&#39; (Nakatsukasa), nor <br/>\ndid Shimazu retainer Hishijima Gunai-shoyu Kunisada (d.1600) have much to do <br/>\nwith the ancient &#39;Ministry of the Imperial Household&#39; (Gunai/Kunai).<br/>\nAs for who exactly handed out these titles, I actually have not read much on <br/>\nthat. My assumption is that the Court was petitioned in individual cases to <br/>\nOk the awarding of the titles in question (as opposed to the Court doing so <br/>\nof its own volition as a rule, as literally hundreds - if not thousands - of <br/>\n&#39;-no kami&#39;&#39;s were walking around at any given time, if one is to judge by <br/>\nretainer registries).  I do know of any number of specific examples, one of <br/>\nwhich involved Takeda Shingen.  At the time of his coming of age, <br/>\nrepresentatives of both the the court and shogunate were in attendance.  At <br/>\nthat time he was allowed to use the &#39;Haru&#39; from the name of the then-shogun, <br/>\nYoshiharu, as well as the title &#39;Shinano no kami&#39;.  Around 1560 the Court <br/>\nawarded Mori Motonari and his eldest son Takamoto various titles (including <br/>\n&#39;Mutsu no kami&#39; for Motonari and &#39;Daizen-daibu&#39; for Takamoto) in recognition <br/>\nof gifts and donations they had sent on the occasion of the Emperor <br/>\nOgimachi&#39;s enthronement in 1559.<br/>\nPerhaps the liberal use of titles harks back, at least in spirit, to ancient <br/>\nChina, where one saw a bewildering array of colorful titles in circulation.  <br/>\nCertainly, sai-tai-shogun seems to have a Sino-inspired basis.<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>",

By the 16th Century this had become mostly honorific, <br/>\nthough certain lords carried a given governorship from generation to <br/>\ngeneration that was based in fact (such as the Shimazu of Satsuma, who were <br/>\nstyled &#39;Satsuma no kami&#39; and the So of Tsushima, who were styled &#39;Tsushima <br/>\nno kami&#39; - as well as Chosokabe Motochika, who assumed the title &#39;Tosa no <br/>\nkami&#39; after being confirmed in that province by Toyotomi Hideyoshi).  While <br/>\nany number of men in Japan might have the same title at any one time, they <br/>\ntended to be unique within a given clan - that is, and for example, Takeda <br/>\nretainer Baba Nobufusa became &#39;Mino no kami&#39; after the death of the previous <br/>\nholder of that title within the Takeda, Hara Toratane.  This occured in 1564 <br/>\n- from this point on Nobufusa is almost always described as &#39;Baba Mino&#39; or <br/>\n&#39;Baba Mino no kami&#39;.
