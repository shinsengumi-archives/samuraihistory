The outer<br/>\nwalls remained the same, but the tenshaku was larger<br/>\nand placed differently to that of the Toyotomi-period<br/>\nOsaka castle.&quot;<br/>\nThat&#39;s correct about the tenshaku-it was a different<br/>\ncolor too (black-Toyotomi, white-Tokugawa). The<br/>\nTokugawa one also bit the dust (struck by lighting in<br/>\nthe 1600&#39;s) and didn&#39;t get rebuilt until the 1930&#39;s. <br/>\nHowever, the outer walls are not the Toyotomi<br/>\noriginals. The Tokugawa covered the entire complex<br/>\nwith dirt (building a small mountain on top) and under<br/>\nthe guidance of Todo Takatora built all new ones. Many<br/>\nof the stones have the mon of the lord who was<br/>\nresponsibile for constructing that section of wall,<br/>\nand the Osaka Castle museum actually inspected and<br/>\ncatalogued EVERY SINGLE STONE!!! in the walls a few<br/>\nyears back. Why? Seems symbolic more than anything<br/>\nelse. The old walls were perfectly good. As stated<br/>\nearlier, they have conducted excavations and uncovered<br/>\nsome of the Toyotomi walls.<br/>\nSeveral publications sold at the Osaka-jo museum have<br/>\ngreat diagrams of all this. Gakken also just released<br/>\na new book that recreates the Toyotomi version of the<br/>\ncitadel with computer graphics. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nCelebrate Yahoo!&#39;s 10th Birthday! <br/>\nYahoo!
