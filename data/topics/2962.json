            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1746704599\">Mutsuhito by a top knot.  He steered Japan on a liberal course toward a <br/>\nparliamentary democracy.  His armed forces in the  Russo-Japanese War earned renown <br/>\nfrom all foreign correspondents and war observers, like our Black Jack <br/>\nPershing,  for the chivalrous way they handled Russian prisoners.   His death in <br/>\n1912 and the suicide of the general Nogi and his wife heralded the true end of <br/>\nthe Age of the Samurai.  Had Hirohito had an ounce of the courage and character <br/>\nthat Meiji had,  there would have been no invasion of China nor war  in the <br/>\nPacific.  Of course my opinion is clouded a bit here by the fact that Hirohito&#39;s <br/>\nminions tried to kill my dad twice, at Leyte Gulf and Okinawa.
