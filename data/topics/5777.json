I have been reading & researching Japanese history<br/>\nfor the better part of my life and i am finally within a group where i feel<br/>\ni can converse openly, freely & most of all...continue to learn. Please<br/>\npardon me for being overly ecstatic, but this forum is just truly what i<br/>\nhave been looking for in a nutshell. I have recently returned from Okinawa,<br/>\nJapan...but luckily for me i am sure none of you will hold that against me<br/>\n(i hope that was funny to some, give me a little face...please) but have<br/>\nbeen over mainland Japan as well and there are not many places in Japan or<br/>\nAsia period that i have not traveled. On my own or through the U.S.<br/>\nMilitary. So i offer my modest thanks and praise for being able to exist<br/>\nwithin the forum...<br/>\n     Secondly; i agree with the statements of Mr. Wayland...to request for<br/>\ninformation one must truly want to seek the truth. As i am sure we all know,<br/>\none of the staples of Bushido was that it was commonplace to seek<br/>\nconstructive criticism from your peers...for as Tsunetomo said: &quot;If you<br/>\njudge and manage every affair while depending only on your small learning<br/>\nand wisdom...etc.&quot; The point is that you cannot ask a question with the<br/>\nintention of getting only the answer you desire.<br/>\n     Thirdly; i wanted to acquire some books or writings if possible<br/>\nexplaining the history of the Yakuza as a sort of &quot;police force&quot; in their<br/>\norigination, i am not sure if this is correct, but i am really looking for a<br/>\nsort of timeline from their beginning and how they progressed and changed.<br/>\nAny assistance in this manner would be extremely grateful. Continued<br/>\nBlessings!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n --- On Wed 10/13, Nate Ledbetter &lt; ltdomer98@... &gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter [mailto: ltdomer98@...]<br/>\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nDate: Wed, 13 Oct 2004 19:44:42 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai Inquiry<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;tt&gt;<br/>\nMy use of the phrase &quot;bad romance novel&quot; in no way,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nshape, or form, justified an attack on my person using&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nfoul language. That is not the act of someone who&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nwants answers. The impression is that this person read&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nsomething somewhere, potentially fictional, and&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nbelieves it to be real. Fine--no problem. To me, it&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sound real. It certainly doesn&#39;t sound like&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nanything I&#39;m familiar with, at least with no further&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\ninformation to draw from. However, I&#39;m fully willing&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nto grant it may be a story based on some real events,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nand would be happy to help find what those events&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nwere, if I could. I cannot, especially when told &quot;I&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nknow more about this, but won&#39;t tell you.&quot; Please.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nIt is not the responsibility of anyone on this board&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nto soothe egoes or confirm erroneous beliefs. You have&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nthe right to incorrectly believe geisha existed in&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n1600--you do not have the right to call people who&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\ntell you that you are incorrect and present facts&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\ndirty names. &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nMy reply may have been sardonic, but was not&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\noffensive. I didn&#39;t call anyone any names. As a&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nsubordinate list moderator, I was well within my&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nrights granted by Kitsuno to simply delete the email&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nand ban the person from posting. I did not, as it was&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nan attack directly on me--I chose not to act so I&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\ncould not be accused of acting out of malice. Kitsuno&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\ncan decide to ban or not ban, delete or not delete. &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nIf you want information, this is a great place to be.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nIf you want affirmation, go see a therapist. &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n--- Kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It really is not an issue of scholarship. First he&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; asks a vague &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; question, which is fine. but he also later mentions&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; that he has more &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; information that he then refuses to release, which&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; tells me he isnt &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; very interested in getting information. The&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; response that offended &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; him seemed pretty benign to me, but that is just my&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; humble opinion. &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regardless, it makes sense to me that if you ask a&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; question, you try &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to include as much information as possible, which he&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; apparently &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; didnt do if he is now bragging about having other&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; information. &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, these groups are pretty easy, but not always&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; a one way &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; street. Just because you ask for someone to do your&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; homework for you &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; doesnt mean they will do it willingly. People tend&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to want a reason &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to do you work for you. That was part of what I was&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; trying to say.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@i...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dear Brothers,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regardless of your emotional state, this:&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ...&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is brutally vague in the extreme.
