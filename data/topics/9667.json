The politicsand ideas of the time, the ritsuryo system, the court...all had a hand in what was to come (obvious,I know). Anyone interested in this period should check out Karl Friday&#39;s book titled The First Samurai: The  Life and Legend of the Warrior Rebel Taira Masakado. It presents a fairly straightforward account of the times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNever miss a thing.
