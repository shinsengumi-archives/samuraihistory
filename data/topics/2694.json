Rotation of ranks, firing by &#39;introduction&#39;,<br/>\n&#39;extraduction&#39; or whatever you want to call it was already happening in<br/>\nEurope. In fact it was the only effective way that ranks of<br/>\narquebusiers/musketeers could keep up a steady stream of fire. Volley or<br/>\n&#39;salvo&#39; (ie firing all ranks together) could be devastating if troops held<br/>\ntheir nerve, but was risky since there would now be a time lapse before they<br/>\nhad all reloaded.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At Nagashino we see 3000 (though some<br/>\n&gt; recent scholarly debate has asserted the number was<br/>\n&gt; closer to 1000)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even 3000 would still be a very small percentage of Nobunaga&#39;s army (less<br/>\nthan 10%). Most European armies would have had a higher percentage of<br/>\nfirearms than that. Perhaps it was the combination of arquebusiers with<br/>\narchers plus obstacles (?).<br/>\nPerhaps the heavy rain the previous night was decisive (remember the French<br/>\nknights floundering in the mud at Agincourt?). Nobunaga&#39;s use of obstacles<br/>\nmay have been a stroke of genius, but even this has already been used in<br/>\nEurope to great effect during the Italian Wars 50 years previous.<br/>\nMichael</div>",

Most impressive. More discussions <br/>\nabout this appeared on the sca-jml list recently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;By 1575 the Japanese were using firearms on the battlefield to<br/>\n&gt;greater effect than Europeans, and on a much more<br/>\n&gt;massive scale. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tactics for Spain and the rest of Europe were roughly the same as Japan, <br/>\ni.e. musket and pike/yari. Japan had many fine generals as did Europe. <br/>\nCertainly Sengoku had honed their treachery, err.. political skills as <br/>\nwell. I would hesitate about the much greater effect since many Western <br/>\narmies had some form of drill in this period.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The only reason Europeans surpassed the Japanese by the time the two civilizations re-engaged<br/>\n&gt;in the 1800&#39;s is that the Japanese had 200 years of peace, no warfare, so no reason to adapt and change<br/>\n&gt;the way they did things. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Remotely possible but I highly doubt that 200 more years of warfare <br/>\nwould have modernized Japan to the degree that happened in Europe. Japan <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have the access to resources that Europe had and if they had <br/>\nexpanded they may have experienced the same problems that Spain and <br/>\nother previously great powers had. Also I would argue that Japan wasn&#39;t <br/>\na country until Meiji and that the individual provinces were still <br/>\nthinking of independence and kicking out the Tokugawa, which is eventual <br/>\nwhat happened. Of course this puts them on par with Italy and Germany <br/>\nwhich are both fairly modern themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;ONce they saw that need, they<br/>\n&gt;did, and defeated a major European power shortly<br/>\n&gt;thereafter (1904-05, Russia). <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lucky they didn&#39;t win WW2 then.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Eckman</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1504351188\">Hi Craz,<br/>\n<br/>\nSure please send the jpg&#39;s if they&#39;re not too big.<br/>\nRegarding comparison&#39;s between European and Japanese martial ways, I think it&#39;s like comparing apples and tangerines.<br/>\nBut there are some things that can definitely be compared. The sword for one, as you mentioned. Most experts consider the Japanese swords as the best swords ever made, even compared with edged blades made under current technological specifications. And in my opinion, I consider the Greek phalanx under Alexander the most awesome and fearsome infantry battle formation ever created. Can you imagine facing a quarter mile front of 16 to 18 foot pikes, with spearheads five deep? Even if you get past the first one, you got four more in your face, not to mention from all sides. No matter how good the Samurai warrior was in individual combat, I think they would have shared the same fate as all those that Alexander confronted and destroyed. But, that&#39;s just my opinion. We&#39;ll never know as Alexander never got that far. It would also have been interesting to see how the Mongols would have fared in an all-out war against the Samurai. Since the Mongol invasion was thwarted by typhoons, there were only a few brief skirmishes in which the Samurai is said to have done well. A full on war would have changed the history of Japan as we know it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: CRAZ <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, December 07, 2003 2:05 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Samura battle tactics<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not deeply versed on the subject of specific<br/>\n  formations and the like, but I do know I have about 8<br/>\n  jpg&#39;s of Japanese battle formations after firearms<br/>\n  started seeing regular usage, so I&#39;m assuming these<br/>\n  particular ones were used in the short span from the<br/>\n  time Oda Nobunaga rose to power to when the Toyotomi<br/>\n  line was killed off.  If you&#39;d like, I can try and<br/>\n  send them to you personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, in the book &quot;samurai warfare&quot; there&#39;s a good<br/>\n  deal of paintings and plates of large Japanese armies<br/>\n  either going into or in the midsts of battle.  The<br/>\n  book as well as several others also tell how battles<br/>\n  were generally fought, usually with the highest<br/>\n  ranking general (shokun, daimyo, whatever word you<br/>\n  want to use) watching from a nearby hill or some other<br/>\n  place to get a good overview of the field.  Each<br/>\n  daimyo, and possibly highly celebrated warriors of<br/>\n  lesser rank, had a standard bearer to show where his<br/>\n  force was on the field, and the head general from high<br/>\n  atop his hill would send specifically chosen runners<br/>\n  (I forget what book it was but I did read a great deal<br/>\n  on the importance, training and ability of these<br/>\n  chosen message carriers) to relay messages/orders<br/>\n  between himself and each standard worthy leader. <br/>\n  Below that I think each leader was pretty much<br/>\n  responsible for his own type of organization amongst<br/>\n  his troops.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wearing sashimono was obviously one way of keeping<br/>\n  order and telling who was who on the battlefield, and<br/>\n  the previously mentioned standards also helped.  I<br/>\n  beleive I read that one of the reasons that there&#39;s<br/>\n  not much written on Japanese mass warfare is that the<br/>\n  Japanese never had any great literary generals like<br/>\n  the west did.  Generals were too busy warring most of<br/>\n  the time so most of the accounts we have of battles<br/>\n  before the end of Sengoku Jidai are accounts written<br/>\n  by people not in the military.  And this is not even<br/>\n  taking into the account the possible number of lost<br/>\n  records during such an unsteady time as the Sengoku<br/>\n  period.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I beleive Japanese warfare was very highly regulated<br/>\n  much like their wastern counterparts, I think it&#39;s<br/>\n  nearly impossible for a country with a history of so<br/>\n  much war to have gotten by just sort of &quot;winging it&quot;,<br/>\n  and reading of genius minds like Hideyoshi Toyotomi, a<br/>\n  man who once had the perspective to use the seasonal<br/>\n  monsoons of Japanese to submerge a castle he was<br/>\n  beseiging, I just can&#39;t see the Japanese being so<br/>\n  inept at mass warfare as nearly everyone insists that<br/>\n  they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am a full blooded american with nothing but<br/>\n  anglo-saxon roots, but it offends me to hear Japanese<br/>\n  warfare spoken of in such a negative fashion these<br/>\n  days.  It used to be left at &quot;the Japanese were more<br/>\n  specialized and better at personal combat whereas the<br/>\n  Europeans were better at keeping order and mass<br/>\n  combat&quot;, but even that is being challenged these days<br/>\n  by people who insist in the superiorty of European<br/>\n  fencing, unarmed combat and actually have the gull to<br/>\n  compare the european sword to the katana.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I could rant on, but I&#39;ll do that some other time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  New Yahoo!

I tried several times but I just couldn&#39;t get into it. Being a US army brat in Japan with Japanese looks, my Dad focused my education on being American. I may still get to reading Kanji someday. But meanwhile, how about briefing me on what you read. Did the Samurai have something equivalent to the phalanx? Did the front lines hold even and try to penetrate each other&#39;s defenses or was the battle similiar to what is usually shown on tv and film where the warriors inter-penetrate each other&#39;s lines and get involved in numerous man-to-man melees all over the field with no clear demarcation of sides? I&#39;m thinking that was probably the case in Japan, that that was the reason why they needed the sashimono, so they would know who was on who&#39;s side. <br/>\n<br/>\nRichard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
