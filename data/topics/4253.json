I don&#39;t even <br/>\n&gt;think annexing Hawaii was a US decision.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, it was a coup that the US backed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Michael Peters&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwstel@...\">shdwstel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The Japanese of today are NOT the japanese on 70 years ago. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is so true, we are also not the Americans of the period as well. <br/>\nJapanese tenant farmers were still little better than slaves. Their <br/>\nlifestyle had not changed since the Tokugawa bakafu decided to squeeze <br/>\nthem. In many ways all but the urban elite and the military were still <br/>\nfairly bad off. In many ways it was a continuation of the fuedal state <br/>\nwith technology thrown in. It&#39;s the ugly ending of the military classes <br/>\nas rulers of Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
