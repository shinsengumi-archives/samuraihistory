In <br/>\nrespects to the generalization of Japanese history, being honorable could be <br/>\nviewed as a part of one&#39;s duty, depending upon the historical era and the <br/>\nregion involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn respects to the subject of war, it&#39;s difficult to determine whether or <br/>\nnot it is for an honorable cause.  The &#39;facts&#39; of all wars have been <br/>\nnotoriously biased in favor of the victor, so they will generally seem to <br/>\nhave had good cause.  It comes down to individual leaders and soldiers <br/>\nrather than a war in general.  Should I define WWII by Germany&#39;s <br/>\nextermination of the Jews or by America&#39;s use of atomic weaponry?  Should <br/>\neither of those definitions drown out the actions of individuals who acted <br/>\nhonorably?  And, with more questions, how do we define honor in war and who <br/>\ndefines it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many more questions raised beyond these few.  With each answer, <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to find more differing opinions amongst the group members.  <br/>\nThis, of course, should help educate each of us in our own way.  Honestly, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t place much stock in the opinions of those who are going to throw <br/>\ntantrums and exchange pre-schoolish insults.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m over-stepping my boundaries as a newbie who has been on the list <br/>\nfor less than forty-eight hours, but I joined this group because I have an <br/>\ninterest in japanese culture and history and felt I could learn a bit from <br/>\nthose more educated that I.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Matt<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Fighting in a war does not provide extra validation to one&#39;s opinions <br/>\nor make them any more worthwhile.  Having been a soldier, I, of course, feel <br/>\neveryone should serve some military service, but I don&#39;t use that as a <br/>\nmeasurement of overall value of a person.  Nor should anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.S.  This is a cultural history group, not a group of primates flinging <br/>\nfeces at one another.  I might be new here, but, please, can some of you put <br/>\naside aggressive differences and act as if evolution has actually been <br/>\nbeneficial?<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet reliable access on MSN 9 Dial-up. 3 months for the price of 1! <br/>\n(Limited-time offer) <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/\">http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/</a></div>",

Waging war upon those who are perceived enemies or threats could be criticised but wars fought to create one&#39;s identity (eg; the Vietnamese against the French, US and Allies, then China, or even the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 or the Zulu Campaigns against British rule). Expansionist wars are driven by political and ecominc gluttony but wars to create national integrity are honourable, even if the means used to fight them are not.

During the warring<br/>\nstates period (&quot;Sengoku Jidai&quot;), japanese politics (understood as the<br/>\nrelationship between the social entities) could be traced back to constant<br/>\narmed conflict. I seem to have lost track of the source, but I remember<br/>\ncoming across a statement claiming that &quot;during the Sengoku era, specially<br/>\nunder Oda Nobunaga?s blossoming period, the internal diplomatic relations in<br/>\nJapan almost ceased to be, as the driving force for change were war&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, war was a way of life, a basis for assigning meaning to reality.<br/>\nAs such, the concepts of &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;loyalty&quot; were deeply woven amongst<br/>\nthe fabric of war. Perhaps before today?s standarts, &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;loyalty&quot;<br/>\nhave different meanings from what they used to have on those days. Even the<br/>\nwarlords and warmongers were subject to suffering the effects of defeat on<br/>\nsuch era.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, lack of honour which can be ascribed to a warlord or warmonger does<br/>\nnot entail lack of honour which can be ascribed to soldiers,<br/>\nbrothers-in-arms bound by something far greater than the conflict itself. I<br/>\nbeesech Shakespeare knowledge to make this point: &quot;Those who shed their<br/>\nblood with me today, on this field, shall be my brother - we, a band of<br/>\nbrothers&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this adds in a positive way to this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nThiago<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Mensagem original-----<br/>\nDe: Nate Ledbetter [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>]<br/>\nEnviada em: terca-feira, 23 de marco de 2004 20:50<br/>\nPara: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nAssunto: Re: [samuraihistory] loyalty and honour<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Tony.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no honor in wanting to start a war.
