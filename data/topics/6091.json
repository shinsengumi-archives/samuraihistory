I did learn,  became tough, and as a purple belt (4th <br/>\nkyu) was capable of defeating many who outranked me by a wide margin.  However, I may have had technique, but there was no peace, no <br/>\nserenity in my heart. That relationship didn&#39;t survive, thank the fates, and let&#39;s just say his anger and attitude has brought him <br/>\nno happy life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had the good fortune to have excellent tutelage and example set for me in several dear friends.   I don&#39;t know that I follow <br/>\n&#39;The Way&#39;, but I strive to be the same person from the core of my being to what others see, and with my actions.  I try to be <br/>\nhonest, and act with integrity. I don&#39;t claim a permanent state of serenity, kindness, dignity, or clarity of mind.  I have learned <br/>\nthe concept of &#39;beginner&#39;s mind&#39;, and have been rewarded with teachers of all ages, cultures, and species.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m grateful to be here, and look forward to learning more from some very fine people.
