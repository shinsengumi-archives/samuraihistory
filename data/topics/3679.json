They were just as well trained as the samurai were. They had a standing army of men who were monk in name only and who had a long history of using military threats and action for reasons that had nothing to do with religion! Now if I am wrong I will be the first to admit it but in tthis case it is you who are wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave Jackson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
