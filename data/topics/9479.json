I can think of a few like Rurouni <br/>\nKenshin/Samurai X; Hellsing; SaiYuki/SYR; Read or Die and the new one <br/>\nCOD/Cutting Edge/AnimeNetwork/Le Chevalier D&#39;Eon. The last one is set <br/>\nat the time of the French revolts (1790s) and includes the title <br/>\ncharacter, the Royals, Duc d&#39;Orleans (baddie) and a few others. Kyo <br/>\nhas lots like Nobunaga, Yukimura Sanada (what a family!) and Saito <br/>\nHajime (ancestor of his namesake who was Captain of the third squad <br/>\nof the Shinsengumi featured in RK as well as Peacemaker). In <br/>\nPeacemaker Saito is cast as a ghost seer who can see the dead souls <br/>\nmuch like Ichigo in Bleach can. Well more soon. Have a cool day and <br/>\nKami bless you all.
