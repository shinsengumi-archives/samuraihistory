            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1236792847\">Hello Tony and fellow members,<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, thanks Tony, but graphic evidence -Z么hy么 Monogatari, amongst other primary sources, clearly indicate that the number of sashimono bearing Ashigaru is limited in comparison to Samurai....as for those Samurai films, I have even seen Ashigaru archers wearing sashimono which most students think impractical for bowmen! Still as I said, there are many books where the use of the afore-mentioned banners is confusing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing which is unclear in many secondary sources is the use of Samurai cavalry. I have read that cavalry were actually supported by infantry reatiners so the tactical mobility enjoyed by say European cavalry was not an option, as Japanese cavalry units could not and did not want to outpace their foot element. Now I know Kurosawa portrayed some lovely cavalry charges in Ran but is the former assertion correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope these doubts can be cleared.
