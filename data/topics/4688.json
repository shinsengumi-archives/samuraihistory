            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1407553862\">zevlord,<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is also the no-daito (no-dachi) which is around 3 shaku or longer.  <br/>\nIt was used primarily as a cavalry sword though there are instances that I <br/>\nhave heard of where it was used on foot.  Though I am sure that they were <br/>\nextreme cases since weilding 3+ shaku katana is a muchly different <br/>\nexperience than the more typical 2.0 - 2.5 shaku katana.<br/>\n  As a matter of general court procedures during the Edo (Tokugawa) period <br/>\nthe daito was removed when entering someone elses house and the visitor was <br/>\nleft with the shoto (wakizashi) and their tanto.<br/>\n  There are two other &quot;blades&quot; that are often overlooked as being part of <br/>\nthe common accoutrements of the samurai, the kogai and the kozuka.  The <br/>\nkogai is, for the most part, the stick that you often see in the topknot of <br/>\nthe Edo period men.  It is adorned with the kamon of the carrier and, <br/>\naccording to what I have been told by my Iaido sensei, it was used to mark a <br/>\nslain opponent by sticking it into their Achilles&#39; tendon.  Also, if the tip <br/>\nhad enough of an edge, it could be used as a shuriken since the original <br/>\nshuriken were merely short knives, not throwing stars.<br/>\n  The kozuka is basically a 3 or 4 inch blade that was stored in the saya <br/>\n(sheath) and could be pulled out through the tsuba (hand guard).  This knife <br/>\nwas often used as a utility knife for cutting rope, fruit, etc.  Though in <br/>\nthe hands of a skilled samurai it could be used as a close quarters weapon <br/>\nor as a shuriken.<br/>\n  Hopefully this has helped in some way.  If anyone knows something that I <br/>\nhave mis-stated please do correct me.  I do not yet have the wealth of <br/>\nknowledge that some on this list have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMake the most of your family vacation with tips from the MSN Family Travel <br/>\nGuide! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dollar.msn.com\">http://dollar.msn.com</a></div>",
