Nowadays students expect<br/>\nmore explanations.<br/>\n<br/>\nG:  A contrasting perspective on this idea is that the people who do things<br/>\nbest are not always the ones who are capable of explaining it best.  I think<br/>\nit highly probable that the original teachers of martial arts fell into this<br/>\ncategory, and that this became the accepted model for such teaching.  ...I<br/>\nalso confess to a sneaking suspicion that this served to cover a great deal<br/>\nof poor teaching over the generations.  And that&#39;s not necessarily an insult<br/>\nto any of the teachers, in my mind, because what other model for the art of<br/>\nteaching did they have themselves?  Here&#39;s a case where I think mystique<br/>\nserved no good purpose.  Teaching is an art unto itself, and can be applied<br/>\nwith good results to pretty much any external discipline.  (Internal<br/>\ndisciplines are more tricky.)  Myself, I come from a teaching background,<br/>\nand I find that if I can explain a concept clearly, I can get the student to<br/>\nlearn faster.  (In many cases, this means less of a straightforward verbal<br/>\nexplanation and more of a method of evoking the correct kinesthetic<br/>\nsensation:  I don&#39;t want to suggest that anyone can simply be talked through<br/>\nlearning - say - to cut correctly.)  I find that this approach involves far<br/>\nless frustration for me and the student both.  So my experience, at least,<br/>\nJames, is that most skills involving physical co-ordination can be taught<br/>\nwith good results, using a very different method than the one you&#39;ve<br/>\ndescribed here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well, not quite, but the assimilation of knowledge<br/>\n&gt;through training and kata is not &#39;head knowledge&#39;<br/>\n&gt;but &#39;heart&#39; or &#39;body knowledge&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;but once the hands understand what they&#39;re supposed to do,<br/>\n&gt;best leave it up to them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Correct practice makes perfect. A slightly improved saying.<br/>\nG:  I&#39;d say both of those have merit; I don&#39;t think they&#39;re quite the same.<br/>\nThe former speaks more to me of training the intuition, the latter of<br/>\ntraining the form.  The art would be incomplete without both.<br/>\n\tGereg</div>",

We perceive <br/>\n&#39;knowledge&#39; as, in a sense, &#39;objective data&#39;, to be <br/>\nlearnt, imparted from sensei to student, and upon <br/>\nthis foundation one can speculate with a lesser or <br/>\ngreater degree of accuracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus we are head or question based.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the dojo nothing is said, you are shown, and learn <br/>\nby example, and emulation. I have memories of sensei <br/>\nstopping me, then showing me the form. I do exactly what <br/>\nhe does, and he shows me again, I do the same again and <br/>\nhe shows me again. I do EXACTLY what he did, and he shakes <br/>\nhis head and walks away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, not quite, but the assimilation of knowledge <br/>\nthrough training and kata is not &#39;head knowledge&#39; <br/>\nbut &#39;heart&#39; or &#39;body knowledge&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a phrase in Japanese &#39;hand knowledge&#39; - <br/>\nit&#39;s to do with how one holds the sword. Although there <br/>\nis the basic, most dynamic grip, the position of the <br/>\nhands change all the time as one performs the <br/>\ntechnique - the training is to stop bad habit (weak grip)<br/>\nbut once the hands understand what they&#39;re supposed to do,<br/>\nbest leave it up to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",

Still not sure if I can write in a sensible<br/>\nmanner, but I&#39;ll try.<br/>\nG:  The evidence is in your favour.  It all looks pretty sensible to me.<br/>\nIf I recall correctly, you had early on in your writing alluded to &#39;the<br/>\nartist&#39;s eye&#39;, and to perceptions that others might miss.<br/>\nG:  I don&#39;t recall the phrase, but I might have used it.  I don&#39;t dispute<br/>\nthe gist of this.<br/>\nSome people seem<br/>\nto have an ability to perceive that is so sensitive as to appear<br/>\n&#39;supernatural&#39;, or &#39;mystic&#39;.  Artists, particularly those of Eastern arts,<br/>\nincluding martial,  are taught (or advised) to learn to put aside their own<br/>\nego and absorb their environment, especially in the beginning, of their<br/>\ntraining.  Later on they have learned, or should have learned, to<br/>\nincorporate their ego into their perceptions &#39;properly&#39;, and &#39;become one&#39;<br/>\nwith the world around them.  Clumsily and said in cliché form, forgive me,<br/>\nbut that means to me that the person has become the same ego inside and out,<br/>\nand is in a state of &#39;constant harmony&#39; with their environment....   a place<br/>\nin their existence where perception of and response to their environment is<br/>\nso well ingrained that the individual appears to have some kind of &#39;power&#39;.<br/>\n  It&#39;s not power; it is &#39;mushin&#39;.....   at rest,  this concept is<br/>\n&#39;zanshin&#39;.............   but this you know already.<br/>\nG:  I&#39;m with you so far, but I&#39;ll note this:  as I see it, that is &#39;some<br/>\nkind of power.&#39;  I believe I&#39;ve said (though perhaps not here) that I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen a good deal of magic, but I don&#39;t believe in the supernatural.  This is<br/>\na nice example of the sort of thing I mean.  The terminology my Aikido<br/>\nsensei used to use - centring, grounding, gathering ki (often translated<br/>\n&#39;life force&#39;) - always reminded me a great deal of the way my Wiccan friends<br/>\ntalked about European paganism.  They called it magic, he always hastened to<br/>\nsay it wasn&#39;t.  From their respective approaches, I think they were both<br/>\nright.  Focussed will produces results, it&#39;s as simple as that.  And those<br/>\nresults are not always limited to obvious - or even rational - cause and<br/>\neffect.<br/>\nAs a person who has knit, crocheted, embroidered, and sewn since she was 7<br/>\nyears old,  the catalog of impressions my brain has stored about fabrics,<br/>\nyarns, and threads is more than I can consciously recall. We in the<br/>\nknitter&#39;s realm have a concept of yarn &#39;telling us what it wants to be&#39;<br/>\nsuch that we say the yarn &#39;speaks to us&#39;.  Other knitters I know scoff at us<br/>\nabout &#39;mysticism&#39;, and proceed to knit with yarn obviously unsuited to their<br/>\nproject and they are wailing and complaining about a &#39;troublesome project&#39;.<br/>\nThey wonder at how others of us can &#39;make it look so easy&#39;.  I try to<br/>\ndescribe the way I personally &#39;hear&#39; my yarn or fabric is not in words per<br/>\nse, but in a mind-full picture conjured by that store of impressions already<br/>\nthere.  If the needle size is wrong for the yarn, it will appear to &#39;fight&#39;<br/>\nbeing knit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother person who paints, draws, or writes is tuned to a different store of<br/>\ninformation, as are swordsmiths and all other artisans.   Persons who<br/>\ndevelop several avenues of pursuit get better at amalgamating information<br/>\nand perceptions of those arts into a cohesiveness, a &#39;way&#39; of responding to<br/>\ntheir environment that to others can seem a bit unreal, but it is not.  It<br/>\nis simply being and staying aware and responsive to the cues given by one&#39;s<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\nHealth care providers, particularly nurses, also undergo a barrage of<br/>\nsensory input that is beyond conscious recall, but some of them can take in<br/>\nthe appearance of a patient, and the summation of impressions that &#39;come up<br/>\non screen&#39; &#39;tells&#39; them that something is not going well.  It&#39;s that &#39;gut&#39;<br/>\nfeeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoldiers also develop that catalog, unfortunately, with experience in<br/>\nbattle; Nathan can undoubtedly expound on this subject  much better than I.<br/>\nSome groundwork is certainly laid with intensive training.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do my previous words have to do with swords that  seem to &#39;speak&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it has more to do with the person who is handling the sword, than it<br/>\ndoes with the sword itself.  I think it is that awareness, that catalog of<br/>\nphysical and visual impressions gathered over time, and the ability to allow<br/>\none&#39;s mind to create a meaningful picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I have a lot more to say,  also about the way a samurai may have<br/>\nperceived his blade,  but it mostly enters into the realm of psychology, so<br/>\nI won&#39;t go there unless there is interest in further discussion.  This is,<br/>\nafter all, a history list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to work with me....<br/>\n<br/>\nLizzie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nG:  The yarn analogy is amusing, partly because my wife&#39;s recently started<br/>\nspinning, but mostly because I&#39;ve lately found myself regrinding some stock<br/>\nblades - mostly Windlass Cutlery swords - that are tip-heavy and unwieldy.<br/>\nA student gets a blade, it&#39;s not suited to him or her - but with a little<br/>\nwork it could be...  I&#39;ve been told I bring out the &quot;inner blade,&quot; and while<br/>\nthat may be a little excessive, I do find I have a pretty clear feeling for<br/>\nwhat that sword wants to be.  As far as that goes, I agree with your<br/>\nanalysis completely.  That&#39;s the sense that tells me how much taper&#39;s<br/>\nneeded, what kind of ricasso to leave, whether a new pommel&#39;s necessary,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n...But it&#39;s not the same sense as that I get of the personality of the sword<br/>\nitself.  Consider your analogy to health care:  that experienced unconscious<br/>\nanalysis - to use a clumsy explication of &#39;intuition&quot; - may tell you what<br/>\ntreatment a patient will respond to, but it isn&#39;t how you can tell the<br/>\npatient&#39;s in the room with you.<br/>\nThat analogy isn&#39;t as stretched as it might seem, either, since the obvious<br/>\ncounter to that would be:  &quot;Well, I can see the patient.&quot;  Fair enough:  an<br/>\nex-wife did hospital work, much of it with seniors; she said she could<br/>\nimmediately tell when a patient had died, as soon as she walked into the<br/>\nroom, by a feeling of absence that didn&#39;t seem to be related to sound or<br/>\nsmell or sight.  I have no trouble believing this, and I doubt that her<br/>\nsensitivity is unique:  I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s a pretty common phenomenon among<br/>\nnurses - am I right?<br/>\nNow I find this idea so credible (even if I&#39;m wrong about it) not because<br/>\nI&#39;ve been around enough death to sense the absence myself, but because I<br/>\nfeel a corresponding sense of presence in many (not all, but many) blades.<br/>\nAfter considering Mr. Sinclaire&#39;s post, I&#39;ve come to wonder if a blade as<br/>\nold as he&#39;s speaking of might not have developed sufficient &#39;presence&#39; -<br/>\nperhaps a less inflammatory term than &#39;spirit&#39; - that it might be more<br/>\nconspicuously perceptible.  It is certainly my experience that a blade that<br/>\nhas been lovingly used for any length of time always carries with it a<br/>\nproportionately more intense presence.  That focussed will that I mentioned<br/>\nearlier is also a factor here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as a general note on this thread, I&#39;d like to apologise for an<br/>\nunintentional trap I set.  I didn&#39;t originally want to get into the subject<br/>\nof religion here, because that&#39;s not what this list is about.  But it is a<br/>\nfact that these ideas are connected to my personal faith, and in retrospect<br/>\nI&#39;ve come to think that if I&#39;d been clearer about that to begin with, the<br/>\nresponses I got might have been accordingly more respectful, and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave been in a position to take such offense.<br/>\nMy regrets and apologies for the resultant unpleasantness:  to Nate in<br/>\nparticular, and to the rest of you.  I look forward to more civil<br/>\ndisagreements, and to even more civil agreements.<br/>\n\tIn honour,<br/>\n\t\tGereg </span></blockquote></div>",
