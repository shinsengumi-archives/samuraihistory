Maybe <br/>\nthe remake of it by Hollywood will ring bells...&quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; (? Seven <br/>\nSamurai is far, far, far better as a film but both are excellent to watch.)<br/>\n Yojimbo was also remade as &quot;A fistful of Dollars&quot; by Eastwood/Leone and more <br/>\nrecently as &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; with B.

As the Hattori, and Momochi families <br/>\n&gt; were all commoners they used the same Mon (coat of arms).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Iga Heinaizaemon no jo Ienaga one time, the head of the Hattori <br/>\n&gt; family, gave permission for his sons to start their own lineage. <br/>\n&gt; These three were called Hattori Heitaro Koreyuki, Hattori Heijiro <br/>\n&gt; Yasuyori, and Hattori Heijiro Yasunori. The eldest son Koreyuki, <br/>\n&gt; called his family &#39;Kamihattori&#39;, the middle son Yasuyori named <br/>\n&gt; his &#39;Nakahattori&#39;, and the youngest Yasunori, called his <br/>\n&gt; family &#39;Shimohattori&#39;. The descendants of the Hattori family <br/>\n&gt; originated many centuries early from China, and were at that time the <br/>\n&gt; warlords of many provinces. For this reason they were known by many <br/>\n&gt; names, amongst which they were known as &quot;Kan Kuni no Kami&quot; (Hattori <br/>\n&gt; lords of Kan). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heitaro Koreyuki was the oldest son of Iga no jo Ienaga, and as such <br/>\n&gt; on his fathers death became the head of the Kamihattori. The <br/>\n&gt; Kamihattori mon (crest) was known as Yahazu Nihon, or, &quot;The two arrow <br/>\n&gt; heads&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heijiro Yasuyori, of the Nakahattori, had ties with the Chinese Go <br/>\n&gt; province, their Mon was called Ichitomoe, or, &quot;an arc&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heijiro Yasunori, of the Shimohattori, was also called &quot;Ae Kuni no <br/>\n&gt; Hattori&quot;, (The Hattori of Ae). The Shimohattori Mon was called <br/>\n&gt; Yaguruma, &quot;The eight arrowheads in a circle&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hanzo Hattori came from the Kamihattori branch of the Hattori family. <br/>\n&gt; It is not fully known if he came from the Heitaro or the Chigachi <br/>\n&gt; line (another branch of the Kamihattori family).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As well as the Hattori family, the Momochi, and Fujibayashi were also <br/>\n&gt; very prominent within the Ninja schools of Iga.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In 1567, Oda Nobunaga ordered his Samurai to attack the Iga province. <br/>\n&gt; The three Hattori families Kami, Naka, and Shimo were almost <br/>\n&gt; destroyed. Only 80 members of these three powerful families survived.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the three branches of <br/>\n&gt; the Hattori family dispersed to different area&#39;s of Japan. The <br/>\n&gt; Kamihattori fled to Nagaoka in Echigo. The Nakahattori split into two <br/>\n&gt; groups. One group went to went to Mikawa, to the protection of, and <br/>\n&gt; work in the service of the  Tokugawa family, the other half of the <br/>\n&gt; group went to the Oichi family in Takatori, in Yamato. The <br/>\n&gt; Shimohattori escaped to the safety of the mountains of Takano in <br/>\n&gt; Kishu.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hattori Masanari, and his son  Hattori Hanzo (both from the <br/>\n&gt; Kamihattori), swore allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while <br/>\n&gt; working for the Tokugawa held the rank of &#39;Shinobi Metsuke&#39;, and he <br/>\n&gt; had served Ieyasu&#39;s grandfather Matsudaira Kiyoyasu. Hanzo later, <br/>\n&gt; with a friend, Shiro Tarao who was a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa <br/>\n&gt; Ieyasu flee across Japan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely, <br/>\n&gt; utilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting up special <br/>\n&gt; defensive formations along the road, and by using Ninja methods of <br/>\n&gt; running. This all helped the Tokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. <br/>\n&gt; The Hattori were not &quot;Watari Ninja&quot; (Ninja who moved around from one <br/>\n&gt; Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the Tokugawa, and remained in <br/>\n&gt; their service for many generations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Masanari Hanzo, head of the Hattori family, received his training in <br/>\n&gt; the martial arts, and Ninjutsu, from his father Hattori Hanzo <br/>\n&gt; Yasunaga, when he was a child. He virtually grew up in the practice, <br/>\n&gt; and tradition of the martial arts. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at night, Hanzo was <br/>\n&gt; young man of 16 years. For the skills that he used during the battle, <br/>\n&gt; he earned himself a commendation. He was given the name &quot;Hanzo the <br/>\n&gt; Ghost&quot;. Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the province of <br/>\n&gt; Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in use. In his later years <br/>\n&gt; Hanzo was also known as &quot;Hanzo the great lancer&quot; (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai, and then came <br/>\n&gt; to be known as &quot;Hattori Hanzo Iwami no Kami&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him, each held the <br/>\n&gt; rank of Doshin. He developed problems with these Ninja and he found <br/>\n&gt; it difficult to control them, and he relieved them of their services. <br/>\n&gt; He then employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in his <br/>\n&gt; life, he became a Monk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hanzo Hattori (above) was so famous that in the province of Mikawa <br/>\n&gt; songs were written about him. One contained these lines:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Lord Tokugawa has the finest warriors<br/>\n&gt; Hanzo Hattori is Demon<br/>\n&gt; Hanzo is Hanzo the Yari&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th December 1596, while <br/>\n&gt; trying to bring the Ninja of the Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must <br/>\n&gt; be wrong as Hanzo helped Ieyasu in the early 1600&quot;s. The story of his <br/>\n&gt; death says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding teeth), and <br/>\n&gt; his Fuma Ryu originally came from Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and <br/>\n&gt; his men chased the Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf <br/>\n&gt; of Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of water, and <br/>\n&gt; several swam under water, and began dismantling the rudders of the <br/>\n&gt; boats belonging to Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; men decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by shore. When <br/>\n&gt; they entered the water, they discovered that the water was covered <br/>\n&gt; with oil. To which the Fuma Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the <br/>\n&gt; Tokugawa Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Samurai Archives: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samurai-archives.com\">http://www.samurai-archives.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

As the Hattori, and Momochi families <br/>\nwere all commoners they used the same Mon (coat of arms).<br/>\n<br/>\nIga Heinaizaemon no jo Ienaga one time, the head of the Hattori <br/>\nfamily, gave permission for his sons to start their own lineage. <br/>\nThese three were called Hattori Heitaro Koreyuki, Hattori Heijiro <br/>\nYasuyori, and Hattori Heijiro Yasunori. The eldest son Koreyuki, <br/>\ncalled his family &#39;Kamihattori&#39;, the middle son Yasuyori named <br/>\nhis &#39;Nakahattori&#39;, and the youngest Yasunori, called his <br/>\nfamily &#39;Shimohattori&#39;. The descendants of the Hattori family <br/>\noriginated many centuries early from China, and were at that time the <br/>\nwarlords of many provinces. For this reason they were known by many <br/>\nnames, amongst which they were known as &quot;Kan Kuni no Kami&quot; (Hattori <br/>\nlords of Kan). <br/>\n<br/>\nHeitaro Koreyuki was the oldest son of Iga no jo Ienaga, and as such <br/>\non his fathers death became the head of the Kamihattori. The <br/>\nKamihattori mon (crest) was known as Yahazu Nihon, or, &quot;The two arrow <br/>\nheads&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeijiro Yasuyori, of the Nakahattori, had ties with the Chinese Go <br/>\nprovince, their Mon was called Ichitomoe, or, &quot;an arc&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeijiro Yasunori, of the Shimohattori, was also called &quot;Ae Kuni no <br/>\nHattori&quot;, (The Hattori of Ae). The Shimohattori Mon was called <br/>\nYaguruma, &quot;The eight arrowheads in a circle&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nHanzo Hattori came from the Kamihattori branch of the Hattori family. <br/>\nIt is not fully known if he came from the Heitaro or the Chigachi <br/>\nline (another branch of the Kamihattori family).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs well as the Hattori family, the Momochi, and Fujibayashi were also <br/>\nvery prominent within the Ninja schools of Iga.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1567, Oda Nobunaga ordered his Samurai to attack the Iga province. <br/>\nThe three Hattori families Kami, Naka, and Shimo were almost <br/>\ndestroyed. Only 80 members of these three powerful families survived.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the three branches of <br/>\nthe Hattori family dispersed to different area&#39;s of Japan. The <br/>\nKamihattori fled to Nagaoka in Echigo. The Nakahattori split into two <br/>\ngroups. One group went to went to Mikawa, to the protection of, and <br/>\nwork in the service of the  Tokugawa family, the other half of the <br/>\ngroup went to the Oichi family in Takatori, in Yamato. The <br/>\nShimohattori escaped to the safety of the mountains of Takano in <br/>\nKishu.<br/>\n<br/>\nHattori Masanari, and his son  Hattori Hanzo (both from the <br/>\nKamihattori), swore allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while <br/>\nworking for the Tokugawa held the rank of &#39;Shinobi Metsuke&#39;, and he <br/>\nhad served Ieyasu&#39;s grandfather Matsudaira Kiyoyasu. Hanzo later, <br/>\nwith a friend, Shiro Tarao who was a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa <br/>\nIeyasu flee across Japan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely, <br/>\nutilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting up special <br/>\ndefensive formations along the road, and by using Ninja methods of <br/>\nrunning. This all helped the Tokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. <br/>\nThe Hattori were not &quot;Watari Ninja&quot; (Ninja who moved around from one <br/>\nDaimyo to another), they were loyal to the Tokugawa, and remained in <br/>\ntheir service for many generations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMasanari Hanzo, head of the Hattori family, received his training in <br/>\nthe martial arts, and Ninjutsu, from his father Hattori Hanzo <br/>\nYasunaga, when he was a child. He virtually grew up in the practice, <br/>\nand tradition of the martial arts. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at night, Hanzo was <br/>\nyoung man of 16 years. For the skills that he used during the battle, <br/>\nhe earned himself a commendation. He was given the name &quot;Hanzo the <br/>\nGhost&quot;. Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the province of <br/>\nKawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in use. In his later years <br/>\nHanzo was also known as &quot;Hanzo the great lancer&quot; (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>\n<br/>\nHanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai, and then came <br/>\nto be known as &quot;Hattori Hanzo Iwami no Kami&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him, each held the <br/>\nrank of Doshin. He developed problems with these Ninja and he found <br/>\nit difficult to control them, and he relieved them of their services. <br/>\nHe then employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in his <br/>\nlife, he became a Monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHanzo Hattori (above) was so famous that in the province of Mikawa <br/>\nsongs were written about him. One contained these lines:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Lord Tokugawa has the finest warriors<br/>\nHanzo Hattori is Demon<br/>\nHanzo is Hanzo the Yari&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th December 1596, while <br/>\ntrying to bring the Ninja of the Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must <br/>\nbe wrong as Hanzo helped Ieyasu in the early 1600&quot;s. The story of his <br/>\ndeath says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding teeth), and <br/>\nhis Fuma Ryu originally came from Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and <br/>\nhis men chased the Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf <br/>\nof Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of water, and <br/>\nseveral swam under water, and began dismantling the rudders of the <br/>\nboats belonging to Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo&#39;s <br/>\nmen decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by shore. When <br/>\nthey entered the water, they discovered that the water was covered <br/>\nwith oil. To which the Fuma Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the <br/>\nTokugawa Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps</div>",

Hanzo, as he is commonly known, had been born in 1541 as the son of Hattori Yasunaga, a hereditary retainer of the tokugawa (or Matsudaira as they were then named).  He fought his first battle at the age of  16 years in the form of a night attack on the castle of Udo in 1557, and went on to serve with distinction at the battles of Anegawa (1570) and Mikata ga hara (1572).  His nickname was Devil Hanzo, to distinguish him from another prominent Mikawa Samurai, Watanabe Hanzo.  As noted by Yamaguchi from Mikawa Monagatori: &quot;Lord Tokugawa&#39;s best samurai were hattori Hanzo, (Devil Hanzo); Watanabe Hanzo, (Spear hanzo) and Atsumi Gengo (Headslicer Gengo).<br/>\n<br/>\nHattori Hanzo died in 1596 aged 55, and was succeeded by his son Hattori Iwami-no-kami Masanari.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe text goes on to talk about Tokugawa Ieyasu also emplying Koga men but does not discuss whether they were under the command of Hattori Hanzo.  Also of interest is the fact that Hanzo&#39;s men became the guards of Edo castle and the Hanzo Gate still bears his name.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is helpful,<br/>\n<br/>\nMusashi<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone,<br/>\nI&#39;m also trying to find out more about Hattori Hanzo (1541-1596).<br/>\nI know that he was a Tokugawa retainer and was also a famous leader of <br/>\nninja.
