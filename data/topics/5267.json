            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-921410043\">I think that the Mongols would probably have won the battle but not the war. Though greatly outnumbered it must be remembered that these figures are only the number of samurai meeting the Mongols in northern Kyushu at Hakata bay and not the whole Japanese force. The samurai had better weapons and armour as well as the determination of a people defending their homeland, ( the Mongol army had a large percentage of Chinese and Korean conscripts). Where the samurai lacked was in tactics, but by the second invasion they were fighting much smarter, adapting their tactics to this new enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\njust my two cents<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: zevlord <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, August 17, 2004 7:11 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Mongols v Japanese<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Mongols have had really bad luck when trying to invade Japan a <br/>\n  thunderstorm harassed north Kyushu island in 1274 when the Yuan army <br/>\n  was fighting (first invasion attempt), and again in 1281 a typhoon <br/>\n  hit north Kyushu island while the Yuan soldiers were on board their <br/>\n  ships preparing for a major landing operation (second attempt).

I don&#39;t expect to be able to contribute<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very much as, quite frankly, most of you guys seem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; WAY out of my league.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heh, we talk a good game...seriously, most of us here<br/>\n&gt; are amateurs who read a lot. Feel free to jump in<br/>\n&gt; anytime!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kublai Khans invasion force had not been destroyed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by the &quot;Divine wind&quot; in 1281. Who and why do you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think would have emerged victorious, the Mongols or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Japanese ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have thought about this a good deal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I think It would have been the Japanese, mainly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because of the Mongols not being able to maintain a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supply line. On the other hand, apart from a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; relatively minor clash in 1221, there had been no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; real warfare in Japan since the Gempei war. Where as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Mongols were battle hardened. However, I am sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this is all very open to debate. Any takers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Mongol supply lines: The Mongols sure were not<br/>\n&gt; seamen, but neither were the samurai. Apart from a<br/>\n&gt; handful of pirates, most Japanese didn&#39;t venture into<br/>\n&gt; the water, and &quot;sea battles&quot;, even Dannoura, etc.,<br/>\n&gt; were merely land battles fought on boats. Crash into<br/>\n&gt; the enemy, hop aboard, take his head...not much<br/>\n&gt; seamanship involved (Yeah yeah, tides at Dannoura,<br/>\n&gt; whatever...it was no Trafalgar).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Being as the Mongols relied on Korean and Chinese who<br/>\n&gt; had much more sailing experience than either the<br/>\n&gt; Mongols or the Japanese, I think it&#39;s conceivable they<br/>\n&gt; could have maintained their supply lines. If they<br/>\n&gt; could transport supplies 1,000&#39;s of miles between<br/>\n&gt; China and Poland, I don&#39;t think the Strait of Tsushima<br/>\n&gt; was that difficult for them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Lack of Japanese combat since 1221...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In individual combat, this wasn&#39;t a problem. The<br/>\n&gt; Japanese matched up quite well, once they realized<br/>\n&gt; that shouting their lineage to a foe who didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand it was just making them vulnerable to<br/>\n&gt; archers. The problem wasn&#39;t so much lack of<br/>\n&gt; experience, it was lack of experience in the KIND of<br/>\n&gt; warfare the Mongols fought. I don&#39;t think the army of<br/>\n&gt; Minamoto Yoshitsune would have done well in a pitched<br/>\n&gt; battle against Mongol armies. I really don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; anyone would have had a chance until the Sengoku<br/>\n&gt; period. Japanese simply didn&#39;t fight in organized<br/>\n&gt; formations, reacting to signals, etc., like the<br/>\n&gt; Mongols did. Had the Mongols been able to land in<br/>\n&gt; force and establish a coherent beachhead, the course<br/>\n&gt; of history would be very different. Of course, you<br/>\n&gt; have to look at the fact that much of the &quot;mongol&quot;<br/>\n&gt; army were Korean and Chinese conscripts who had no<br/>\n&gt; desire to be there, and wouldn&#39;t have been all that<br/>\n&gt; effective, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that a Mongol<br/>\n&gt; army would have had it&#39;s way with an equivalent<br/>\n&gt; samurai army in a pitched battle on open terrain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. HOWEVER...as Kusunoki Masashige would prove 50<br/>\n&gt; years later, the Japanese could adapt to guerrila<br/>\n&gt; warfare very easily. The Mongols would have found it<br/>\n&gt; very hard to garrison Japan, and wouldn&#39;t have ever<br/>\n&gt; had a true hold on it, I believe. Their usual<br/>\n&gt; techniques of razing the main cities would only harden<br/>\n&gt; Japanese resistance against them.
