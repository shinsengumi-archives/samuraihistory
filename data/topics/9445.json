            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1323102485\">--Bad enough that poor Nobunaga is cast as the villain. Now they are <br/>\nusing the Mibu Clan (the Shinsengumi) as the baddies too. They come <br/>\noff after last night&#39;s eppy as being a cross twixt alchemists and <br/>\nthe &#39;True Knights&#39; (the Knights Templar aka the Rosicrucians or <br/>\nKnights of the Rosy Cross) of the Crusades. There are striking <br/>\nsimilarities too. Both had a working knowledge of nature, both were <br/>\nconcerned with history, both used alchemy (what else is Kyo&#39;s body <br/>\nbut an alchemical wonder?), both were rumoured to possess secrets of <br/>\ntime travel, both were wealthy and both were persecuted by the higher-<br/>\nups. After all that is why Friday the 13th is unlucky. It&#39;s the day <br/>\nthe Pope hanged Sir Gilles de Mourignay the Templar Leader for <br/>\nrefusing to disclose the location of the Templar fortune. By the way, <br/>\nthe Templars founded the banking industry and created credit cards <br/>\ntoo. One more thing- Mageria has the secret of seeing the future. Is <br/>\nhe also a Mibu Clansman? This explains how Yui (think I got it spelt <br/>\nOK this time) or rather her brother came to possess a weapon not to <br/>\nbe invented for a few more centuries. Time travel? If I knew all this <br/>\nstuff about SDK I would have added some of &#39;em to my ff. Well more <br/>\nsoon since tonight is the demonic castle at Sekigahara. A last note <br/>\nhere- Is it a coincidence that Kyoto (old capitol) and Tokyo (new <br/>\ncapitol) are anagrams of each other? See you soon.
