It&#39;s amazing the cost of DVDs and videos in<br/>\nJapan. For example: Onmyoji is being released here on DVD in two months. It&#39;s<br/>\nless than $23 for the deluxe edition with documentaries and all that. The same<br/>\nedition in Japan is about 5400 yen -- over twice the price.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to order them, you can from Amazon.co.jp (the Japanese Amazon). They<br/>\nhave a button you can hit to get English readings. The rest of the interface is<br/>\nidentical to the American version, so even if you can&#39;t read Japanese, that<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be too hard. Note, though, that you can&#39;t get whole NHK series --<br/>\nthey&#39;re 52 hours long. They have a digest version that&#39;s usually three or four<br/>\ntapes, but will cost you about 30-40 bucks per tape. You can also buy full sets,<br/>\nIIRC, from NHK&#39;s website, but they cost about 500 bucks for a series.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",
