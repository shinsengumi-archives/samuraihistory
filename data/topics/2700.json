If you look at the <br/>\nboard about &#39;the Last Samurai&#39; in www.imdb.com, there is a big <br/>\ndiscussion going on, with at least 5 people calling themselves <br/>\n&quot;samurai&quot; (for various reasons), and a lot more mocking them.<br/>\nNow, I have lived in Kyoto for 6 years (and I will be back in a few <br/>\nyears), and I am personally quite annoyed by the &quot;I-am-a-samurai&quot; guys <br/>\n(or &quot;I-am-a-Zen-monk,&quot; etc.), especially gaijins. And believe me, there <br/>\nare a lot of them in Japan. And after Tom Cruise&#39;s movie, expect <br/>\nmore...<br/>\nHowever, my opinion is that everybody is entitled to his/her own <br/>\nfantasies. As far as these &quot;samurai&quot; do not go around cutting people <br/>\nfor real, I believe we should tolerate them. We all have our own <br/>\ndreams, and we hate others shattering them, don&#39;t we?<br/>\nThe only alternative would be to be &quot;NORMAL.&quot; Now, there we would <br/>\nreally have a problem...<br/>\nBye!<br/>\ncepo, honolulu</div>",
