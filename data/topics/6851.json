I&#39;m hoping to find some people here <br/>\nwho share my interests (looks like the right place!) since i&#39;ve <br/>\ndriven my girlfriend nuts with my &#39;samurai talk&#39;. To start off with <br/>\na question: I&#39;ve read Mitsuo Kure&#39;s &#39;Samurai&#39; (Tuttle books) and he <br/>\nwrites on page 174 (near the top of the page) that Takeda Shingen&#39;s <br/>\nadult name (zokumyô) was Nobuharu. I was under the impression that <br/>\nhis zokumyô was harunobu (as it is stated on samurai-archives).<br/>\nStrange error of Mitsuo Kure or am I wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nNahless</div>",
