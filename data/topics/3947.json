In terms of the question itself, surely a leader (anywhere) could be both dictator and unifier, they are not mutually exclusive terms.<br/>\n&gt;Sprouting from the term &#39;unifier&#39; though I have a question? When was Japan unified? <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that&#39;s a tough question, it wouldn&#39;t be irrational to claim that <br/>\nJapan wasn&#39;t a nation until Meiji forced it to become one. It had no <br/>\nnational army or many of the other characteristics of the nations of <br/>\nEurope or later on of the Americas You could look at the Edo jidai as <br/>\none long occupation by an invading force for half of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:edy@...\">edy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He tried to conquerKorea but he was forced out because the Koreanswere helped by the Chinese<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the Korean navy might disagree with that. The Japanese did great <br/>\non land, but failed horribly at sea against Korean naval forces. I <br/>\nsuspect the Korean peasants and commoners didn&#39;t welcome them either.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J.

He was definitely an interesting character and he left some <br/>\ngood paintings behind! I have to ask my freshly arrived who the most <br/>\nfamous American historic character in Japan, I think the answer will be <br/>\na bit scary. Of course some of my favorite Americans are among the <br/>\nfounding fathers, the wierdest group ever assembled I think in part <br/>\nbecause America was the first place in the West that ordinary people <br/>\ncould rise to the top without any form of nobility baggage. So all the <br/>\nnuts and flakes came and then continued west ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;If the question is &quot;best known&quot;, then I would go<br/>\n&gt;&gt;with Musashi, at <br/>\n&gt;&gt;least in the USA.  No one knows who Uesugi Kenshin<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is here...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And more is the pity...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If he had written a best selling business tactics<br/>\n&gt;book, we&#39;d know him, wouldn&#39;t we? <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m grateful that it&#39;s published as that in English since it means cheap <br/>\ncopies everywhere, but I always laugh at the though of it as a business <br/>\nmanual. Prabably better than anything coming out of Harvard though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Anthony J.

You can&#39;t say is <br/>\nunpopular in Japan, so he appeals to a wide range of people. Besides do <br/>\nfanboys read ^_^ Though in some ways he&#39;s more like Billy the Kid or <br/>\nsome Hollywood cowboy hero in some ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eponymous13@...\">Eponymous13@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey.<br/>\n&gt;       At the risk of being branded heretical, I personally wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt;even thought of Musashi.
