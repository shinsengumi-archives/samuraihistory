Totally fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nA book named &quot;Kou-you-gun-kan&quot;, which was written by KOUSAKA<br/>\nMasanobu (Shingen&#39;s &quot;boyfriend&quot; and adviser) and his nephew KASUGA<br/>\nSoujirou in some time from 1596 to 1624,  says that Shingen wanted to<br/>\nsuppress his heath for three years, but it dosen&#39;t mention about kagemusha<br/>\nat all.  And Takeda clan seemed to fail to keep Shingen&#39;s will.  <br/>\nAdditionally<br/>\nKou-you-gun-kan has so many exaggerated stories that historians don&#39;t<br/>\nregard it as reliable source so much.  ( I think there is no problem for <br/>\nus to<br/>\nbelieve only Shingen&#39;s will part though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, a fact that Death of TAKEDA Shigenobu (Shingen&#39;s brother)<br/>\nin Kawanakajima could be regarded as a death as Shingen&#39;s &quot;kagemusha&quot;<br/>\nseems toreinforce the legend of Shingen&#39;s double.</div>",
