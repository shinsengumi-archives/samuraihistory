However, in the West there is still a tendancy <br/>\n(although not always, and it seems to be decling slowly) for men, <br/>\neven when walking side by side with a woman, to walk on the side that <br/>\nthe road is on.  There may be others, but the explaination that I <br/>\nhave heard for this social phenomenea stems from the time in which <br/>\nhorses were used, and could easily go off the street and cause <br/>\nserious injury or death.  So there is a possiblity of some form of <br/>\nprotection with women walking a step behind a man (please don&#39;t flame <br/>\nme feminists :D).</div>",
