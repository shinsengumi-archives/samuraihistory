Other<br/>\nthan your officer ranks, generally ALL soldiers in the<br/>\nEnglish Army, whether infantry or cavalry or whatever,<br/>\nwere from the &quot;bottom&quot; of society. It&#39;s just that the<br/>\nones who could ride became cavalry.

If you were poor,<br/>\nyou couldn&#39;t afford a horse, so you didn&#39;t. If you<br/>\nlook at the breakdown of what samurai were expected to<br/>\nprovide based on stipend, the more money, the more<br/>\nhorses they were supposed to provide. <br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Of the officers and nco&#39;s,<br/>\n&gt;(the people who actually took swords into battle in WW2) many of them had<br/>\n&gt;training in iado, kendo and kenjutsu. They complained that the kyugunto, a<br/>\n&gt;western style saber used during the Russo-Japanese war until the mid 1930s<br/>\n&gt;was to brittle and inflexable for combat and it also did not allow for a two<br/>\n&gt;handed grip. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Also many of the Western sabre patterns had degenerated into inferior <br/>\nshapes that were dressy rather than useful.

Because that&#39;s what we<br/>\n&gt;used--that&#39;s what fit with our Army.
