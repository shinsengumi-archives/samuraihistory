It was <br/>\nof a group of warrior monks running along a beach, I think, with a <br/>\nwide assortment of polearms held up. I believe one was a large war <br/>\naxe, an ono I think. The other polearms may have been similar to the <br/>\nweapons that were supposed to be carried by Benkei. If anyone can <br/>\nprovide me with information about this painting or an image it would <br/>\nbe greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nIsaias</div>",
