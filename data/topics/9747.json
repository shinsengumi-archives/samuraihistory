And that self same weapon (exact) was featured in Geena <br/>\nDavis&#39;s film &#39;Cutthroat Island&#39; which is where Depp&#39;s &#39;Pirates&#39; <br/>\ntrilogy drew a lot of its stuff from. <br/>\n<br/>\nComments? Thanks for all the help and interest in Japanese history <br/>\ngang. SFN/SYS and Kami bless ya all. Toodles-K&K<br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:animeontv@yahoogroups.com\">animeontv@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;keiman0&quot; &lt;KeimanZero@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have just discovered that at the start of every Samurai Deeper <br/>\nKyo <br/>\n&gt; eppy we are told the exact year the adventure began. Yuya is <br/>\n&gt; narrating and says something like &#39;the great war was ravaging the <br/>\n&gt; land and it is now four years since the great Battle of Sekigahara <br/>\n&gt; where the legend of Demon Eyed Kyo was born etc&#39;. Well that battle <br/>\n&gt; was in 1600 so SDK is set in the year 1604. Now in 1545 firearms <br/>\nwere <br/>\n&gt; introduced into Japan so Yuya and Megeira are not violating any <br/>\nlaws <br/>\n&gt; yet albeit Meg&#39;s is futuristic in nature and Yuya&#39;s is a rare <br/>\n&gt; flintlock called a &#39;duckfoot&#39; for its unique shape. If you&#39;ve ever <br/>\n&gt; seen the Geena Davis film &#39;Cutthroat Island&#39; (which was used as a <br/>\n&gt; drawing ground for pirate stuff when Depp&#39;s Pirates trilogy was <br/>\ndone) <br/>\n&gt; there is a scene in it which shows a genuine four-<br/>\n&gt; barrelled &#39;duckfoot&#39; flintlock pistol although the barrels are <br/>\nlined <br/>\n&gt; up side by side rather than over each other in a triangular <br/>\nformation <br/>\n&gt; like Yuya&#39;s gun. Megeira (BIG SPOILER ALERT)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; well he is a time traveller from the future- right? So he would <br/>\nhave <br/>\n&gt; a state-of-the-arts weapon, wouldn&#39;t he? Ever notice he resembles <br/>\n&gt; Kakashi Sensei from Naruto? I think so anyway. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I mentioned that Megeira and Yuya had not violated any Japanese <br/>\nlaws <br/>\n&gt; regarding firearms- yet. In 1615 when the great NobuNaga (the real <br/>\n&gt; Shogun who united the clans after the civil war not the weirdo in <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; Kyo series) came to power he did many things to pave the way for <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; nation as it is known today but two key laws he passed were to <br/>\n&gt; restrict foreign trade and visits and to ban all firearms from the <br/>\n&gt; entire country and these laws stood for a few more centuries too. I <br/>\n&gt; have since learned that he banned guns not because of their danger <br/>\n&gt; but because NobuNaga wanted to expound the virtues of the Samurai <br/>\n&gt; blade (katana as a rule) and its noble tradition in Japan. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well that&#39;s my two cents worth for today. Have a swell day hazu and <br/>\n&gt; Kami bless you all. Toodles-K&K<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--- End forwarded message --- </span></blockquote></div>",
