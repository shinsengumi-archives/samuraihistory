A few may go,<br/>\n&gt; God help them, <br/>\n&gt; because they liked Tom Cruise&#39;s tired exercise in<br/>\n&gt; emotional <br/>\n&gt; manipulation, The Last Samurai. These people do not<br/>\n&gt; know what they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; in for.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;ll get their swooshing swords and their copious<br/>\n&gt; blood. But <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll be scratching their heads at Zatoichi&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; sudden bursts of <br/>\n&gt; slapstick humor, or when the entire cast partakes in<br/>\n&gt; a thunderous tap <br/>\n&gt; dance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could be that only those folks going to see a film<br/>\n&gt; by the awesome <br/>\n&gt; Japanese talent &quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi Kitano will be<br/>\n&gt; content with this new <br/>\n&gt; version of the famous Japanese hero. Kitano<br/>\n&gt; audaciously takes on the <br/>\n&gt; celluloid persona of the blind, justice-seeking<br/>\n&gt; swordsman created in <br/>\n&gt; the 1960s and played for decades by Shintaro Katsu.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zatoichi&#39;s story is taken from the very first Katsu<br/>\n&gt; film in the <br/>\n&gt; 1960s, about warring factions in a small town. The<br/>\n&gt; blind swordsman <br/>\n&gt; (played by Kitano) comes to town as a humble masseur<br/>\n&gt; and gambler, <br/>\n&gt; biding his time with the dice-playing nephew of the<br/>\n&gt; woman who takes <br/>\n&gt; him in. Soon, he&#39;s in the middle of a gang war.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In Kitano&#39;s samurai universe we&#39;re given wonderfully<br/>\n&gt; flawed and <br/>\n&gt; dimensional characters. The film is populated with<br/>\n&gt; bums and <br/>\n&gt; prostitutes, guys who hurt themselves because they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know how to <br/>\n&gt; hold a sword, put-upon working-class folks, and an<br/>\n&gt; idiot or two.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kitano has the odd ability to appeal to both the<br/>\n&gt; art-film lover and <br/>\n&gt; the action-film fan (though not all of his films are<br/>\n&gt; gangster <br/>\n&gt; flicks). He allows bullets to fly and blood to spurt<br/>\n&gt; in the midst of <br/>\n&gt; silly humor, solid storytelling and stunningly<br/>\n&gt; beautiful visuals. <br/>\n&gt; Like blind Zatoichi&#39;s sword sheathed in a rickety<br/>\n&gt; old cane, Kitano <br/>\n&gt; shows us the extraordinary hidden within the<br/>\n&gt; ordinary. His Zatoichi <br/>\n&gt; is no ordinary samurai story. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/custom/showtime/sfl-\">http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/custom/showtime/sfl-</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>shzatoiaug20,0,251117.story?coll=sfla-features-showtime<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!

Soon, he&#39;s in the middle of a gang war.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Kitano&#39;s samurai universe we&#39;re given wonderfully flawed and <br/>\ndimensional characters. The film is populated with bums and <br/>\nprostitutes, guys who hurt themselves because they don&#39;t know how to <br/>\nhold a sword, put-upon working-class folks, and an idiot or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitano has the odd ability to appeal to both the art-film lover and <br/>\nthe action-film fan (though not all of his films are gangster <br/>\nflicks). He allows bullets to fly and blood to spurt in the midst of <br/>\nsilly humor, solid storytelling and stunningly beautiful visuals. <br/>\nLike blind Zatoichi&#39;s sword sheathed in a rickety old cane, Kitano <br/>\nshows us the extraordinary hidden within the ordinary. His Zatoichi <br/>\nis no ordinary samurai story. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/custom/showtime/sfl-\">http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/custom/showtime/sfl-</a><br/>\nshzatoiaug20,0,251117.story?coll=sfla-features-showtime</div>",
