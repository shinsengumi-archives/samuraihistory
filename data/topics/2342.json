What is foolish is when the answer is given,<br/>\npeople want to argue or play semantical games with it.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean to imply it was a stupid question--it&#39;s<br/>\njust that many times that kind of question comes from<br/>\nthose who have a ridiculously romanticized idea of<br/>\nwhat being a samurai is--that it&#39;s some lofty thing<br/>\nthat only those who live by Hagakure and so forth can<br/>\nobtain. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a hereditary social class.<br/>\nPlain and simple. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour question is fine. The answer is that you don&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;retire&quot; from being a samurai, anymore than I would<br/>\nretire from being American. It&#39;s something you are<br/>\nborn as. If you&#39;re looking for a particular word that<br/>\ndescribes a samurai who is no longer active in the<br/>\nworld, then there isn&#39;t one, specifically. There are<br/>\nwords for monk, if he becomes one, or recluse, or so<br/>\nforth, but not anything that means &quot;a samurai who no<br/>\nlonger does anything&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!

Perhaps I phrased my question in a way that is too simplistic. <br/>\nSome time ago I attended a tea ceremony with a Japanese master of this art. <br/>\nMy family was honored by recieving the first taste of the tea. The man who <br/>\nperformed the tea ceremony explained that the art of tea was often taken up by <br/>\nsamurai as they grew older and took up the pursuits of maturity. For this reason <br/>\nI thought that the stages of a samurai&#39;s life might be named in some way, and <br/>\nthat there might be a partiular label given to the samrai as he matured.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
