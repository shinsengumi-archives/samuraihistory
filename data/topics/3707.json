As someone said, it&#39;s a matter of WHICH<br/>\n(L)ord you&#39;re dying for.  In their cases, they were dying for a Lord Not Of<br/>\nThis<br/>\nWorld.  They adhered absolutely to the tenets of bushido in that they served<br/>\ntheir highest Lord to the death.<br/>\n------------------<br/>\nWell, had ya forgot that they had a previous Lord to whom they was already<br/>\nin oath of Loyalty? It is called threason anyway. So, in this way, it is not<br/>\nbushido.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShow me one samurai who never lied or used<br/>\nfalsehood or murdered or committed some form of treason to protect his<br/>\nlord --<br/>\nhuman or Otherwise -- and I&#39;ll show you a liar.  :-)<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\nWell, I admit that I must study more about the life of individual samurais<br/>\nin general than great batles and events in Japan History, however I know<br/>\nabout The Saint of the Sword (The Kensei), and never heard about him needing<br/>\nto break oathes and telling lies to accomplish his missions. (read Go Rin No<br/>\nShou)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       As for Nobunaga, what about the threat of the Ikko Ikki?  Do you<br/>\nthink<br/>\nthey wanted to party hearty?  Do you think they were going to try and<br/>\nproselytize him and his army?  Hardly likely.  It is unlikely that a<br/>\nmajority of the<br/>\npeople who stood in Nobunaga&#39;s way, even if they did congeal into a potent<br/>\nfighting force, would have stood a chance against a brilliant general such<br/>\nas the<br/>\nleader of the Oda and his right hand man, Toyotomi, this is true.  But that<br/>\nwasn&#39;t the issue.  The issue was that anyone who stood in Oda&#39;s way of<br/>\nunifying<br/>\nJapan -- in WHATEVER WAY THAT WAS -- was seen as a threat.  Any threat -- no<br/>\nmatter how great or small, or how justified or unjustified -- must be<br/>\nremoved.<br/>\n Therefore, the genocide, however indefencible to us, was very defencible to<br/>\nHIM, and quite frankly, that&#39;s the only opinion about the issue that really<br/>\nmattered in the end, although it is nice to bat it around and say &quot;what if&quot;<br/>\nand<br/>\n&quot;what was he thinking?&quot; now with four hundred years plus of hindsight.<br/>\n       And I must throw my hat into the ring about it too -- I may not be a<br/>\nCatholic (either belief or by church membership), but these anti-Catholic<br/>\nposts<br/>\nhave GOT to stop.<br/>\n       Anyway, that&#39;s my two &quot;not-worth-much&quot; cents.  8-)  Take care, y&#39;all.<br/>\n8-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTim<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n&quot;All gifts demand a compensation&quot;<br/>\n(Old Viking Saying)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is just to go back to the topic and not preaching or embelezling<br/>\nchristianity history related to Samurai.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Nobunaga, ya forgot the point that he did all that massacre under the<br/>\npolitical and finantial support of the Jesus Company (Jesuites), and yes,<br/>\npoor villagers was killed for just dwelling near the temples. And concerning<br/>\nthe temples weaponry, since the beggining, certain forms of buddhism,<br/>\nspecially Dhyana, has contained Martial Arts under their spiritual<br/>\npractices, not only to their own safety, but as a trainning to achieve<br/>\nenlightenment. (it was presented in the Pure Land monasteries in Japan,<br/>\nbecause in China, the Pure Land Teachings and Dhyana Teachings was taunt<br/>\ntogether from the same patriarch, Bodhidharma who also had a linneage from<br/>\nNagarjuna too.).<br/>\nReferences:<br/>\nThe Bodhisattva Warriors<br/>\nTerence Dukes<br/>\nWisdom Publishing<br/>\n(it is in english)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough (under my knowledge), Martial Arts are not present in Tibetan<br/>\nVajrayana, there is several references in their sutras, shastras and<br/>\ntreatises using weapon iconography both representing Demonic Forces working<br/>\nagainst karma, sentient beings, etc or in hand of a Wrathful deities to cut<br/>\nnegativities, such as the three poisons of the mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, they had weapons, and what? They was not a big fan of Nobunaga&#39;s abuses,<br/>\nand so what? Does they attempted to take over control of Japan, went to<br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s house to kill him, to justificate such actions?<br/>\n<br/>\nConcerning you throwing your hat about that, it displeases me that people do<br/>\nso much to act in defense of a institution that gave so much support to such<br/>\natrocities, including Germany&#39;s Nazism, but no one said anything about a<br/>\nserious demonstration of RACISM and discrimination against my country<br/>\n(Brazil), in a message that was totally OFF TOPIC, and of course, a SERIOUS<br/>\nVIOLATION not only against Yahoogroups TOS (Therms of Service) but against<br/>\neven some international laws. I sent my protests to the list owner and he<br/>\nasked me for more tolerance to ensure peace. And All what I did was to say<br/>\nthat I was very happy that in this recent fiction movie inside an period of<br/>\nJapan History, that they did a positive reference instead of the usual<br/>\nracist discrimination USA Movies did against asiatic in the past presenting<br/>\nasiatics as monkeys and simmilar extremisms. Like those that made the<br/>\nfammous Mr. Bruce Lee so upset in his life. (and in this way I was happy<br/>\nthat The Last Samurai did that, even if not 100% historically accurated) So,<br/>\nI even respectfully ask you to, before take the role of &quot;most holy than<br/>\nthou&quot;, to think about this issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy country is not perfect, and I know that, however racism here is crime<br/>\npunishable with jail and I am very proud of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nOctavio Augusto</div>",
