            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-134894162\">I&#39;ve started a side project I wanted to let everyone know about, the Yakuza Film Rundown:<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.yakuzafilm.com<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be giving a rundown of 1-2 Yakuza films a month, which will are chosen by you, the readers - the next movie will be Takashi Miike&#39;s &quot;Like a Dragon&quot;, which beat out &quot;Deadly Outlaw: REKKA&quot; and &quot;Yakuza Demon&quot;, after which I&#39;ll have up another poll so you can vote on the next movie.  The first rundown is available - Takashi Miike&#39;s 2002 &quot;Graveyard of Honor&quot;, as well as a post detailing the AnimEigo release and Extras DVD.  Rather than keeping it a straight review, I try to mix it up, keep it conversational, and add as many pertinent and entertaining links and images into the text as I can find, trying to give it a more &quot;multimedia&quot; feel. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook for the &quot;Like a Dragon&quot; rundown soon.  I hope you enjoy the blog.</div>",
