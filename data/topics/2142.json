Here is an excerpt:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------<br/>\n&gt; -JAMES starts to turn away.  HIROSHI finally speaks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HIROSHI<br/>\n&gt; On the day of battle, a champion is chosen.  He<br/>\n&gt; rides ahead of his <br/>\n&gt; army, meets the challenger of the enemy.  The victor<br/>\n&gt; brings great <br/>\n&gt; acclaim to himself, to his clan.  A dozen times I<br/>\n&gt; rode out as <br/>\n&gt; champion, a dozen men I killed.  In only one contest<br/>\n&gt; did I know <br/>\n&gt; fear.  Our combat seemed to last an eternity, by the<br/>\n&gt; grace of some <br/>\n&gt; god I prevailed...  I had never been more proud to<br/>\n&gt; be samurai, to <br/>\n&gt; take an enemy&#39;s head.  I raised it high on my<br/>\n&gt; pike... Learned later <br/>\n&gt; the warrior&#39;s son, a six-year old boy, had watched<br/>\n&gt; it all from the <br/>\n&gt; castle walls.  That boy was Daigo Masakado.<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That looks to me like something that would have been<br/>\n&gt; pretty much <br/>\n&gt; outdated even in the 15th century, let alone the<br/>\n&gt; 19th, and there is <br/>\n&gt; of course the obligatory trip to the geisha house. <br/>\n&gt; There are lots <br/>\n&gt; of things like that - some things that make it<br/>\n&gt; little better than <br/>\n&gt; the meiji-era samurai classic &quot;the barbarian and the<br/>\n&gt; geisha&quot;.  <br/>\n&gt; although, like I said, assuming this is truly an<br/>\n&gt; early version of <br/>\n&gt; the script, I HOPE they would have worked out the<br/>\n&gt; most obvious <br/>\n&gt; problems.  The first scene of the movie, if they<br/>\n&gt; keep it as I have <br/>\n&gt; here, should be real good, though.  The battle<br/>\n&gt; scenes have potential <br/>\n&gt; to say the least.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>, Nate<br/>\n&gt; Ledbetter <br/>\n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s one thing when something &quot;wrong&quot; is done for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cinematic effect. We all know that the Nagashino<br/>\n&gt; scene<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; isn&#39;t the way it really<br/>\n&gt; happened--the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Takeda cavalry didn&#39;t die in a 9 minute span from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rapid-fire Oda arqubusiers mowing them down like<br/>\n&gt; WWI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; German machine gunners against a British &quot;Over the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Top&quot; Charge. But it fits the cinematic effect<br/>\n&gt; desired,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so none of us complain about it.

In the current issue of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hitchcock Magazine, there&#39;s a &quot;Heian period&quot; murder<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mystery. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set in the eleventh century. Except I recognize the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Japanese story used as the basis for it -- a story<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that took<br/>\n&gt; &gt; place a century later (because there was a war that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figured in the background, and one of the characters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; historical). I also recognized that the author made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some anachronisms with names (using a very late<br/>\n&gt; &gt; period name for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; woman character in the story). I was also thrown off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because of mentions of cotton clothing and candles,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; neither of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which existed in Japan during the  Heian period.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So.... is that a good story? To some, yes. To me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no. There was too<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much wrong with it that kept throwing me *out* of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the story.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Like some people stop reading detective fiction<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where someone puts a silencer on a revolver. Or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; removes &quot;the clip&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from a revolver. Both of which I see often -- it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; means the writer really doesn&#39;t know guns, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t done the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; research -- it makes me wonder what else might be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wrong that I *don&#39;t* know about.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tony<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

A dozen times I rode out as <br/>\nchampion, a dozen men I killed.  In only one contest did I know <br/>\nfear.  Our combat seemed to last an eternity, by the grace of some <br/>\ngod I prevailed...  I had never been more proud to be samurai, to <br/>\ntake an enemy&#39;s head.  I raised it high on my pike... Learned later <br/>\nthe warrior&#39;s son, a six-year old boy, had watched it all from the <br/>\ncastle walls.  That boy was Daigo Masakado.<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThat looks to me like something that would have been pretty much <br/>\noutdated even in the 15th century, let alone the 19th, and there is <br/>\nof course the obligatory trip to the geisha house.  There are lots <br/>\nof things like that - some things that make it little better than <br/>\nthe meiji-era samurai classic &quot;the barbarian and the geisha&quot;.  <br/>\nalthough, like I said, assuming this is truly an early version of <br/>\nthe script, I HOPE they would have worked out the most obvious <br/>\nproblems.  The first scene of the movie, if they keep it as I have <br/>\nhere, should be real good, though.

In the current issue of Hitchcock Magazine, there&#39;s a &quot;Heian period&quot; murder mystery. It&#39;s<br/>\nset in the eleventh century. Except I recognize the Japanese story used as the basis for it -- a story that took<br/>\nplace a century later (because there was a war that figured in the background, and one of the characters is<br/>\nhistorical). I also recognized that the author made some anachronisms with names (using a very late period name for a<br/>\nwoman character in the story). I was also thrown off because of mentions of cotton clothing and candles, neither of<br/>\nwhich existed in Japan during the  Heian period. So.... is that a good story? To some, yes. To me, no. There was too<br/>\nmuch wrong with it that kept throwing me *out* of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike some people stop reading detective fiction where someone puts a silencer on a revolver. Or removes &quot;the clip&quot;<br/>\nfrom a revolver. Both of which I see often -- it means the writer really doesn&#39;t know guns, and hasn&#39;t done the<br/>\nresearch -- it makes me wonder what else might be wrong that I *don&#39;t* know about.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",

And of course they are going to<br/>\nmuck it up, because accuracy and reality doesn&#39;t sell<br/>\nin movies. The American public would rather see Tom<br/>\nCruise run around in gusoku, and be fed trite BS about<br/>\nbushido, etc., romanticising this rather than treating<br/>\nit with any degree of objective reality. I will go and<br/>\nwatch, hoping I&#39;m wrong, but expecting that I&#39;ll spend<br/>\nmore time noticing incorrect details than appreciating<br/>\nanything in the movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nNate<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Burker1@...\">Burker1@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Spoken like a true wargamer/masochist.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bob Burke<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/28/03 3:54:53 PM,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Agreed....I think it will be painful.
