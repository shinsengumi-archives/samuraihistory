            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1189204013\">Ladies and Gentlemen, here is a soon to be distributed press release, but I <br/>\nthought you all should get it first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japanese Sword�The Yoshihara Tradition of Swordmaking<br/>\nPacific Asian Museum, Pasadena March 19, 2005-June 19, 2005<br/>\n<br/>\nPress preview-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pacific Asia Museum is proud to present Tosho--The Yoshihara tradition <br/>\nof swordmaking. The exhibition, the first of its kind in Los Angeles for <br/>\nover 30 years, features the work of twelve award winning swordsmiths, four <br/>\nof whom have been awarded the rank of mukansa by the Agency of Cultural <br/>\nAffairs of Japan. The exhibition highlights the idea that Japanese swords <br/>\nare not merely weapons, but also spiritual objects of great artistic value. <br/>\nThe swords will be exhibited in same manner that they are displayed in <br/>\nJapanese museums and shrines, far removed from their practical use, <br/>\nillustrating the different styles of workmanship and expression of the <br/>\nindividual artist. The swords will be borrowed from collections on the West <br/>\ncoast of the United States, from collectors in Japan and from many of the <br/>\nswordsmiths themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japanese sword is the most efficient, intrinsically beautiful, <br/>\nmeticulously handcrafted blade in the world. They are produced by methods of <br/>\nmanufacture that have remained relatively unchanged for a thousand years. <br/>\nOnce forged, they undergo a rigorous polishing procedure that involves as <br/>\nmany as 20 different grades of stones and copious amounts of water. This <br/>\npolishing process enhances the wood grain like quality of the steel and the <br/>\nhamon: a complex crystalline structure, created by the quenching process, <br/>\nthat traverses the blade�s edge. The hamon provides the blade with a tough <br/>\nresilient edge that remains sharp even with heavy use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sword has always been highly revered within Japanese society. It is one <br/>\nof the three objects of the Japanese imperial regalia, along with the mirror <br/>\nand the jewel. According to Japanese mythology, a sacred sword found in the <br/>\ntail of a dragon was brought down from heaven with the ancient gods to begin <br/>\nthe imperial line of Japan. Swords are often dedicated to shrines and <br/>\ntemples as gifts for the residing kami (gods) or as vessels for them to <br/>\nreside in. The changes in shape and manufacture of Japanese blades reflect <br/>\nthe periods in which they were produced, and in many cases, it was the sword <br/>\nthat wrote Japanese history. Later, during the peaceful Edo period <br/>\n(1603-1868), the sword was viewed as an instrument of direction for the <br/>\nwarrior seeking enlightenment, guiding the samurai on ethics of conduct and <br/>\nself-improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the restoration of power from the Shogun (military commander) to the <br/>\nEmperor Meiji in the latter part of the 19th century, the samurai became a <br/>\nrelic of Japan�s ancient past. The Japanese people craved modernisation and <br/>\nindustrialisation equal to that of the western powers. This caused a decline <br/>\nin the call for swords and the art of swordmaking was almost lost. In 1933, <br/>\nKurihara Hikosaburo, a keen sword enthusiast and a member of the National <br/>\ndiet, in an effort to save the craft, began a project to recruit and train <br/>\nswordsmiths from all over Japan. The first member to sign up for this <br/>\nproject was Yoshihara Katsukichi, a toolmaker. Katsukichi would later to use <br/>\nthe art name Yoshihara Kuniie and become one of the most famous swordsmiths <br/>\nof the Showa period (1926-1989). Swordmaking was once again threatened by <br/>\nthe allied occupation of Japan following WWII. All swordmaking and related <br/>\nactivities were banned during this time. Kurihara again spearheaded a <br/>\nrevival of the craft, but this time many of the smiths did not to return to <br/>\nswordmaking, including Kuniie�s brother and son. Kuniie however, became one <br/>\nof the pioneers of the post-war rebirth of Japanese swordmaking, leaving us <br/>\nseveral prominent smiths as his legacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nKuniie�s descendants continue to this day to produce Japanese swords in the <br/>\ntraditional manner. The exhibition displays examples of several generations <br/>\nof his family and their former apprentices. The current head of the <br/>\nYoshihara school Kuniie�s grandson Yoshihara Yoshindo, (recently appointed <br/>\nan Intangible Cultural Property of Tokyo) will be coming from Japan to open <br/>\nthe exhibition and give a talk on the opening day. Yoshindo�s younger <br/>\nbrother Shoji (Kuniie III), is the current deputy chairman of The All Japan <br/>\nSwordsmiths Association and in 2004 had a cameo role in the Warner Brothers <br/>\nmovie The Last Samurai. Yoshihara Yoshikazu is Yoshindo�s son and the fourth <br/>\ngeneration of Yoshihara smiths. In 2003 he became the youngest smith ever to <br/>\nbe elevated to the rank of mukansa (above competition level).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guest curator for the exhibition is Paul Martin, a former member of the <br/>\nJapanese department of the British Museum in London - where he studied and <br/>\ncared for the arms and armour collections. The former All England Karate <br/>\nChampion currently lives in Japan where practices kendo and is furthering <br/>\nhis study of Japanese swords at national museums, shrines and at the <br/>\nworkshops of many of Japan�s top swordsmiths and sword polishers.</div>",
