But what were <br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s motives?  He died too soon to ever really know, and most <br/>\nhistorians don&#39;t even attempt to glean the &#39;why&#39;.  I&#39;ve created a poll <br/>\nwith 12 possible reasons, that you can find here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/polls\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/polls</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGo vote in the poll, and post your opinions!  I myself think that he <br/>\nprobably didn&#39;t intend to at first, but as he gathered power, it sort <br/>\nof came as a natural result - fell into place.  Some people, like <br/>\nNapoleon, Hitler, and others (Robert Jordan would call them &quot;Ta&#39;veren&quot; <br/>\n- to throw in an obscure reference) somehow not only end up on paths <br/>\nto greatness (or great evil), but are spectacularly suited for the <br/>\njob, and rather than being pulled along with the flow of events, they <br/>\ncreate the flow.  I think Nobunaga falls into this category.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some other views?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nc.</div>",
