            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-206697380\">Matt -<br/>\nThat would be spelt &quot;iai&quot;.  In our alphabet, anyway.  The sword would be an<br/>\niaito, or sword for iai practise.  Was (is) she studying iaido or an<br/>\niai-jutsu style, d&#39;you know?<br/>\nTo expand on someone else&#39;s response to this:  apparently (someone<br/>\nknowledgeable correct me if I&#39;m wrong, please) after DubyDubyaAyeAye the<br/>\nAllies prohibited the making of swords for several (&#39;seven&#39; comes to mind?)<br/>\nyears.  (Part of the prohibition on military manufacturing, probably with a<br/>\nside order of suppressing a popular national symbol of martial prowess.)<br/>\nWhen the ban was lifted, the Japanese government wanted to be sure that the<br/>\nold standards of sword quality were maintained.  (Hear, hear.)  They went<br/>\naround asking some of the surviving masters how many swords they could make<br/>\nin a month.  Consensus was &quot;Two.&quot;  So there&#39;s a limit, by law, of two katana<br/>\n(over 24&quot; as I recall) per month.  I think they can make three wakizashi in<br/>\na month instead, which are shorter.<br/>\n(This tends to raise the price of such blades through the ceiling, as a<br/>\nmoment&#39;s thought may lead you to imagine.  And that in turn has a great deal<br/>\nto do with the reason my own pair of katana were made by Chen Chao-po of<br/>\nHanwei, China, a smith for whose studio&#39;s work I hold considerable<br/>\nfondness.)<br/>\nBut I digress.  (Again.)<br/>\nNow there are probably blessed few smiths left in Japan today who still use<br/>\nentirely, completely, no-compromises-not-even-a-little-bit, traditional<br/>\nmethods for crafting a katana - from collecting the iron sand to the old<br/>\nsmelting process, etc.  Machines are available today that make some of those<br/>\nsteps produce irresistibly consistent results.  So if it doesn&#39;t take you<br/>\nall month to make those two swords... well, it&#39;s a shame to waste that nice<br/>\nforge and all that smithying skill.  Those apprentices are sitting around<br/>\nlooking mighty lazy, too.  Eat you out of house and home.  What to do to get<br/>\nthem moving...?<br/>\nGereg<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 3<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 8 Dec 2004 16:50:30 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n   From: Matt Bowes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yeomanforbes@...\">yeomanforbes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: Japan Eras<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Gabriel:<br/>\n<br/>\nImpressive.  Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you&#39;re not a &quot;ringer&quot;<br/>\nposting from middle Ohio?  You made me look up &quot;concatenates.&quot;  I think I<br/>\nheard the word used ONCE back in 1992.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be wrong, but<br/>\nmy ex-wife&#39;s aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have no idea how it is<br/>\nspelled, since I have never ever seen it in print) told me that the great<br/>\nsword makers had stopped making katanas and moved into making kitchen<br/>\nknives, since that&#39;s where the money is.  Now, I can see perhaps where it<br/>\nwould be extra handy to have a ginsu knife for chopping garlic instead of<br/>\nyour trusty katana, but maybe that&#39;s just me.  Some of you might enjoy the<br/>\ngarlic chopping with a larger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged<br/>\nif you do, since that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there<br/>\nany truth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there, just<br/>\nmaking steak knives for Williams Sonoma?

The cast includes Park Jung-hoon, Kim<br/>\n<br/>\nSeung-woo, Hwang Jeong-min and Kong Hyo-jin. The production company, Sidus,<br/>\n<br/>\nhas budgeted around 8 million dollars on this project which will be filmed<br/>\n<br/>\nby new director Min Jun-gi. Filming began on July 20 and there is an<br/>\n<br/>\nestimated release sometime in April 2005.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I just hope it gets released with English subtitles.
