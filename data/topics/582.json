You&#39;re right about Japanese sources for primary lingo research,<br/>\nbut you&#39;ve already listed most of the common source texts used in classes.<br/>\nDepending on specializations, we work with Mass (and the Massites) and Janssen,<br/>\nas well as Friday and Farris. And Elisonas, of course (Deus Destroyed is a<br/>\nclassic.) Many others have only one or two books out there, but they&#39;re really<br/>\nuseful in their areas (Shirane,  Barger, Adolphson, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people are getting into Japanese, I often send them to Sansom for a<br/>\ngeneral historical overview to find an area that interests them, but I&#39;d never<br/>\nrely on it or teach it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are the Japanese books, both modern scholarship and critical<br/>\ntexts. I love the Japanese; who else publishes books with the near corpus of<br/>\nthe classical language literature in their language? With collections like the<br/>\nNihon Koten Bungaku Taikei, the Nihon Koten Bungaku Zenshu, the Nihon Shiso<br/>\nTaikei and so on, I&#39;m in hog heaven.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; New scholarship in Japan comes out yearly, so are there books in<br/>\n&gt; english (textbooks, etc.) for students currently being written by<br/>\n&gt; professors for these Japanese history students?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely. We see a lot of them in literature, too. Plus theories are<br/>\nconstantly being re-evaluated. I&#39;ve totally reversed my position on the Emishi,<br/>\nfor example, and have come into line with the current theory that they<br/>\n*weren&#39;t* any different than the regular &quot;Yamato&quot; Japanese except that they<br/>\nrefused to submit to central court rule. The evidence seems rather compelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have been getting<br/>\n&gt; most of my info from varous books in Japanese, including the Rekishi<br/>\n&gt; Gunzo series, and other sources, by historians such as Kuwada<br/>\n&gt; Nagachika and Kasaya Kazuhiko among others, but would like to find<br/>\n&gt; out what sort of resources &#39;university students&#39; of Japanese<br/>\n&gt; history / sengoku actually get. I doubt that students are required to<br/>\n&gt; actually learn Japanese, read Japanese sources, including old<br/>\n&gt; japanese, or are they?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s good if they can, but it&#39;s not a major factor. Certainly for an undergrad<br/>\nmajor you need three years in the language, and that&#39;s enough to at least work<br/>\nthrough popular historical texts. For grad school, of course primary language<br/>\nresearch is pretty much required. I have little use for people who do grad work<br/>\nin an area studies field entirely in their mother tongue. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you can tell, I&#39;m particularly interested in the type of (and<br/>\n&gt; availability of) these textbooks, if they exist.  Hey, why reinvent<br/>\n&gt; the wheel?  if the sort of info I&#39;m getting from Japanese sources is<br/>\n&gt; the same as what is hidden away in University libraries in english,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d choose english!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can relate. I can read Mass in a day or so, but if I were reading the<br/>\nJapanese equivalent of Mass it would take me many days. Frustrating....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTony</div>",

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1031906986\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently working on an MA and am doing research on buke kakun &quot;warrior <br/>\nhouse codes&quot;, and am specifically doing a translation of one from the late <br/>\n15th century.  I am enrolled in a program that is officially a &quot;language and <br/>\nliteratures&quot; department and therefore did not have the benefit of a set <br/>\ncourse of classes from which to be guided in terms of history books.  I can, <br/>\nhowever, share the books that I was directed to by my advisor...<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially, I did look at the older stuff (Sansom, et. al.)  While his <br/>\nperspective may be rightly characterized as outdated, and his choice of what <br/>\nthings (people, events) to include/emphasize a bit suspect, still I find the <br/>\nSansom books invaluable as the indexes are extensive and the bibliographies <br/>\nsuperb.  I usually go there first when heading off on new subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Kamakura stuff it is pretty much a Mass world.  The late Jeffrey Mass, <br/>\nformerly professor at Stanford, wrote the book(s) on Western scholarship of <br/>\nmedieval Japan.  Not only are _his_ books great, but most of the leading <br/>\nAmerican scholars currently working on medieval Japan are his former <br/>\nstudents (Karl Friday, Thomas Conlan, Alex Bay, etc.)  I must say that most <br/>\nof the books authored or edited by Mass have to do with political <br/>\ninstitutions and are not really of the military history genre, but much in <br/>\nthe same way as Turnbull has monopolized the warring states period, Mass <br/>\n(and the Mass-ites) are pretty much the only game in town when it comes to <br/>\nmedieval stuff.  Anyway, here are a few books that I have used in my <br/>\nresearch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMass:<br/>\n   Kamakura Bakufu: A Study in Documents<br/>\n   Medieval Japan<br/>\n   Court and Bakufu in Japan<br/>\n   Antiquity and Anachronism in Japanese History<br/>\n   The Bakufu in Japanese History<br/>\n   The Origins of Japan&#39;s Medieval World: Courtiers, Clerics, Warriors and <br/>\nZPeasants in the Fourteenth Century<br/>\n   Warrior Government in Early Medieval Japan<br/>\n   Lordship and Inheritance in Early Medieval Japan<br/>\n   The Dev&#39;t of Kamakura Rule<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers:<br/>\n   G. Cameron Hurst - The Armed Martial Arts of Japan<br/>\n   G. Cameron Hurst - Insei - Abdicated Sovereigns<br/>\n   William Wayne Farris - Heavenly Warriors<br/>\n   Karl Friday - Hired Swords<br/>\n   Kenneth Grossberg - Japan&#39;s Renaissance - The Politics of the Muromachi <br/>\nBakufu<br/>\n   Ikegami - The Taming of the Samurai<br/>\n   Hiroaki Sato - Legends of the Samurai<br/>\n   George Perkins - The Clear Mirror<br/>\n   John Brownlee - Japanese Historians and the National Myths<br/>\n   Martin Colcutt - Five Mountains<br/>\n   Marius Jansen - Warrior Rule in Japan<br/>\n   George Elison (now Jurgas Elisonas...hi A.J.) Warlords, Artists and <br/>\nCommoners: Japan in the 16th century<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just a few off the top of my head and many major works are <br/>\nprobably not represented.  It should also be noted that a lot of what gets <br/>\nread (even at the MA level) is not in the form of monographs.  Lots of the <br/>\ncurrent research is actually presented as journal articles (Monumenta <br/>\nNipponica, Harvard Journal of Asian Studies, etc.) as well as Ph.D theses.  <br/>\nMost of this research eventually makes it to books, but it is usually a <br/>\nwhile in the offing.  For those in the States, most of the large state <br/>\nuniversities (land grant-types) have these journals on-hand or at least can <br/>\nget you what you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure, but would think that anyone doing research on Japan (at least <br/>\npre-modern) would be required to read in Japanese at the graduate level.  As <br/>\nundergraduates it is unlikely, however except in exceptional cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is what you were looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a co-webmaster and translator for the Samurai Archives - who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have the benefit of studying Japanese history in a university<br/>\nsetting (I&#39;m working on an MBA) I was wondering what sort of<br/>\nresources students of Japanese history in a university setting<br/>\nactually get.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1437532797\">As a co-webmaster and translator for the Samurai Archives - who <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have the benefit of studying Japanese history in a university <br/>\nsetting (I&#39;m working on an MBA) I was wondering what sort of <br/>\nresources students of Japanese history in a university setting <br/>\nactually get.  I&#39;m targeting this at anyone currently studying <br/>\nJapanese history in a university / college, (particularly A.J. <br/>\nBryant).  I doubt that the sources used are the 20 - 40 year old <br/>\nVarley, Sansom, Reischauer, Berry, etc...?   <br/>\nNew scholarship in Japan comes out yearly, so are there books in <br/>\nenglish (textbooks, etc.) for students currently being written by <br/>\nprofessors for these Japanese history students?  I have been getting <br/>\nmost of my info from varous books in Japanese, including the Rekishi <br/>\nGunzo series, and other sources, by historians such as Kuwada <br/>\nNagachika and Kasaya Kazuhiko among others, but would like to find <br/>\nout what sort of resources &#39;university students&#39; of Japanese <br/>\nhistory / sengoku actually get. I doubt that students are required to <br/>\nactually learn Japanese, read Japanese sources, including old <br/>\njapanese, or are they?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can tell, I&#39;m particularly interested in the type of (and <br/>\navailability of) these textbooks, if they exist.  Hey, why reinvent <br/>\nthe wheel?  if the sort of info I&#39;m getting from Japanese sources is <br/>\nthe same as what is hidden away in University libraries in english, <br/>\nI&#39;d choose english!</div>",
