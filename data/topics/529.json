Since he was assassinated <br/>\nunexpectedly, an heir to the Oda family had yet to be chosen. After <br/>\nHideyoshi (then a general of the Oda) rushed to avenge Nobunaga&#39;s <br/>\ndeath, there was a big dispute about who would succeed him. <br/>\nNobunaga&#39;s eldest son Nobutada was killed during the attempt on his <br/>\nfather&#39;s life, so he was out of the question. The second and third <br/>\nsons (Nobukatsu and Nobutaka) were left to quarrel over who was <br/>\nworthy of succeeding Nobunaga. Hideyoshi&#39;s solution to this was to <br/>\nsuggest that Nobutada&#39;s son Samboshi should succeed him, since <br/>\nSamboshi was the eldest son of Nobunaga&#39;s eldest son, and thus had <br/>\nthe most direct lineage. (Hmm, did that sentence make sense? I hope <br/>\nso.) The problem was that Samboshi was still an infant, so he would <br/>\nneed regents to rule in his place until he grew old enough to take <br/>\nover. Hideyoshi&#39;s opinion eventually won out, and Hideyoshi himself <br/>\nended up as one of the regents ruling in Samboshi&#39;s place. Hideyoshi <br/>\ntook up the reins where Nobunaga left off, and through that position <br/>\nof power ended up playing a big role in the unification of Japan. So <br/>\nI guess that once Hideyoshi rose to power in his own right, the issue <br/>\nof who became head of the Oda family kind of just faded into the <br/>\nbackground. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I know, and I doubt it&#39;s helpful, but I&#39;m sure the smarter <br/>\npeople here can clarify things (and tell me where I&#39;m wrong! -_^)<br/>\n<br/>\nSally</div>",
