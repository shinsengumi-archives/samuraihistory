Matter of fact, you inspired me to have my wife send the JW Hall book to me here in the hinterlands of the earth. <br/>\n<br/>\nCareful, though, making assumptions--peasants didn&#39;t have freedom of movement in Japan, either. As the producers for the entire nation, it was a major concern of local and national landholders if the peasantry up and left their plots. Hideyoshi&#39;s formalization of societal division was as much to keep the farmers on the land as farmers as it was to keep the samurai class in check, if not more. Laws across the country for villages to report &quot;unknown suspicious persons&quot; were as much about identifying absconded peasants as it was for preventing nefarious types shelter. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to distinguish the peasant from the townsperson, the chonin, who was not under any such restriction--as they were viewed as parasites rather than producers, it really wasn&#39;t cared if they moved around. Of course, much of what BECAME townspeople, as in Edo, were peasants who left to escape oppresive conditions, but the bottom line is that especially from the time of Hideyoshi on, it was very clearly illegal for peasants to leave their lands. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Dennis Sheridan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ldsheridan@...\">ldsheridan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thu, December 31, 2009 12:29:35 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nThanks much, Nate.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-287329884\">I guess the point of my way-too-long post was that, even though one koku is technically as you say, in real value, after domainal &quot;borrowing back&quot; and pay adjustments, that one koku ends up being significantly less than what it should be--enough rice to feed one person for a year. Thus, a stipend of such-and-such koku ends up being more a measure of rank but not of real income, which varied per retainer household depending on what the domain took out of it before the stipend was paid.

I just could never keep up before! Anyway, I had the serendipitous occurrence this morning of randomly picking up a book as I was searching for my lost checkbook (happens a lot), and I opened said book (Women of the Mito Domain by Yamakawa Kikue) to the index area and there before me is the technical equivalence of a koku: it is 5.1 bushels or 180 liters of rice. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUpon checking the index of this work (which was my initial intention anyway), I found a passage concerning the &quot;real&quot; value of koku grants:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nfrom page 150, a quote internally from An Oral Record of Mito History, pub. by Takase Shinkyo in the early 1900&#39;s:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&quot;According to what an old man told me when I was fourteen or fifteen about bushi income, a family with a stipend of less than 100 koku could just make do if the household was limited to the man, his wife, and his parents. If, in addition, there were two or three children, they could not make ends meet unless the couple engaged in side jobs. Without such additional income, they would go deeper and deeper in debt. To lead a decent life, a samurai, the old man said, had to have a stipend of at least 300 koku. Asking further about this, I learned that until the time of Lords Harumori and Harutoshi (reigned 1766-1805 and 1805-16, respectively), a retainer with a stipend of 100 koku received as his actual income 72 bales of unhulled rice. This rate for stipends paid from the domain storehouses was better than that obtained by fief holders who collected their income directly from the peasants working their holdings. During the time of Lord Nariaki however, the\r<br/>\n domain withheld 4 bales under the pretext of &quot;borrowing back,&quot; leaving the retainer with 68 bales. This &quot;borrowing back&quot; was not limited to just one year but continued for three or even  five years at a time. Thus the sale of the actual amount of rice received from a stipend of 100 koku would not bring even twenty ryo. ...And out of this one had to pay the domain a military levy of one-half ryo for every 100 koku of one&#39;s stipend. Although at the time prices were very low, a bushi had to keep up a certain lifestyle and couldn&#39;t neglect training in the civil and martial arts. What with these pressures on his budget he had difficulties making ends meet.&quot;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI also remember reading about the pitiful travails of the Tosa retainer Tani Tannai, as he wrangled with his merchant moneylender in an attempt to pay down his debt. Somehow, the debt kept getting larger. This chronicle appears in Constantine Vaporis&#39; excellent Tour of Duty book. I felt sorry for poor old Tani, as he really had no clue about budgeting. One need only look at how Tani spent money to realize the irony of the term &quot;samurai economics.&quot; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCheers to all!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOnnamusha\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 12/25/09, Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; wrote:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Friday, December 25, 2009, 1:37 AM\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n    \r<br/>\n      \r<br/>\n      \r<br/>\n      The key phrase is &quot;at the time&quot;--it varied wildly from period to period and even place to place within that period.

I knew the definition of koku,<br/>\nand that generally - at least in the literature I&#39;ve been reading - that<br/>\nterm isn&#39;t used, just the number of bushels or rice of the stipend.  I did<br/>\nlocate a couple of online sources that indicated that samurai were paid<br/>\neither directly in rice, or, in non-rice growing regions, in coin.  And that<br/>\nreally is what had me confused. As in the source Deborah quoted, I&#39;m not<br/>\nunderstanding the mechanics of this rice economy.  It seems to be terribly<br/>\ninefficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any given daimyo, the farmers have to grow the rice, then harvest it,<br/>\nthen it is gathered to the granaries, then distributed. So to use Nate&#39;s #2<br/>\nwhen kokudaka was employed if I understand correctly: each year people show<br/>\nup at a samurai&#39;s door - or barracks if they are castle samurai - with all<br/>\nthese koku?  Where would one keep 500 or even a thousand koku?  How do they<br/>\nconvert the koku into the money they would need to purchase household goods,<br/>\nclothes, etc?  Would samurai living in households pay their staff with rice<br/>\nin the same way they are paid? Would the staff convert their rice to coin<br/>\nthe same way?  How do people who are not paid in rice get their rice?<br/>\nSpecifically, the poor, who are barely surviving? From what I&#39;ve read they<br/>\ndon&#39;t eat much rice at all, mostly millet and other poorer grains.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read previously that a family would need 250 - 300 koku to keep just<br/>\nabove the poverty level.  But I&#39;m getting the impression that families had a<br/>\nmuch harder time than &#39;barracks samurai&#39; who appear to have a fair amount of<br/>\ndisposable income even though they might be paid far less.  So my dilemma is<br/>\nin understanding how the mechanics of the economy worked.  I understand a<br/>\ngold economy, a barter economy.  I am not understanding a rice economy.

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-735178422\">Nice find! Interesting anecdote about the worth of a stipend in the early 1800&#39;s. It&#39;s important to remember that by that point the Tokugawa Bakufu had been regulating things for 200 years, and everything was standardized. In addition, inflation due to the urbanization of Japanese society meant that in 1800 one koku purchased significantly less than it did in 1600 or before. This is why it&#39;s impossible to say &quot;1 koku = X&quot; without identifying a specific time, and usually a specific place. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone interested in the nitty gritty of taxation systems (you can&#39;t understand stipends without understanding how the money/rice came in, after all), I *HIGHLY* recommendGovernment And Local Power In Japan 500-1700: A Study Based On Bizen Province by John Whitney Hall. Government in Japan from the earliest beginnings up through the end of the Tokugawa period revolved around controlling the output of agricultural production. From the extension and consolidation of Imperial control over the country, to the takeover of local Jizamurai from their absentee noble landlords, to the constant struggles between the central military government and the regional power brokers, it&#39;s all focused, in essence, on authority/ability to tax rice. Because the political system changes so drastically from one period to another, and the systems of taxation and methods of stipend payment change with it, it&#39;s worth reading to understand why the answer to the question given<br/>\n 1190 as a year is radically different from the answer to the same question in 1800. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Deborah Hartman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:goatndogg@...\">goatndogg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Fri, December 25, 2009 5:00:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\nHi, everybody,<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is my first post here, but I&#39;ve been signed up for quite awhile. I just could never keep up before! Anyway, I had the serendipitous occurrence this morning of randomly picking up a book as I was searching for my lost checkbook (happens a lot), and I opened said book (Women of the Mito Domain by Yamakawa Kikue) to the index area and there before me is the technical equivalence of a koku: it is 5.1 bushels or 180 liters of rice. <br/>\n<br/>\nUpon checking the index of this work (which was my initial intention anyway), I found a passage concerning the &quot;real&quot; value of koku grants:<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom page 150, a quote internally from An Oral Record of Mito History, pub. by Takase Shinkyo in the early 1900&#39;s:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;According to what an old man told me when I was fourteen or fifteen about bushi income, a family with a stipend of less than 100 koku could just make do if the household was limited to the man, his wife, and his parents. If, in addition, there were two or three children, they could not make ends meet unless the couple engaged in side jobs. Without such additional income, they would go deeper and deeper in debt. To lead a decent life, a samurai, the old man said, had to have a stipend of at least 300 koku. Asking further about this, I learned that until the time of Lords Harumori and Harutoshi (reigned 1766-1805 and 1805-16, respectively) , a retainer with a stipend of 100 koku received as his actual income 72 bales of unhulled rice. This rate for stipends paid from the domain storehouses was better than that obtained by fief holders who collected their income directly from the peasants working their holdings. During the time of Lord Nariaki however, the<br/>\ndomain withheld 4 bales under the pretext of &quot;borrowing back,&quot; leaving the retainer with 68 bales. This &quot;borrowing back&quot; was not limited to just one year but continued for three or even  five years at a time. Thus the sale of the actual amount of rice received from a stipend of 100 koku would not bring even twenty ryo. ...And out of this one had to pay the domain a military levy of one-half ryo for every 100 koku of one&#39;s stipend. Although at the time prices were very low, a bushi had to keep up a certain lifestyle and couldn&#39;t neglect training in the civil and martial arts. What with these pressures on his budget he had difficulties making ends meet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember reading about the pitiful travails of the Tosa retainer Tani Tannai, as he wrangled with his merchant moneylender in an attempt to pay down his debt. Somehow, the debt kept getting larger. This chronicle appears in Constantine Vaporis&#39; excellent Tour of Duty book. I felt sorry for poor old Tani, as he really had no clue about budgeting. One need only look at how Tani spent money to realize the irony of the term &quot;samurai economics.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers to all!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnnamusha<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 12/25/09, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@yahoo. com&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku<br/>\nTo: samuraihistory@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\nDate: Friday, December 25, 2009, 1:37 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe key phrase is &quot;at the time&quot;--it varied wildly from period to period and even place to place within that period.

Generally speaking if the kokudaka system was used, the retainer was paid in rice. During the mid to late-1500s many daimyo instituted the kandaka system, where taxes were collected in kan (coin) and it was the taxpayer&#39;s responsibility to convert their produce (not just rice, but whatever they had) into coin. Under that system, a retainer would have been paid in coin. Hideyoshi and then Ieyasu reverted back to a koku of rice being the standardized taxation unit, and therefore what retainers were paid in. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Lump sum, yes. This is why you hear so many tales of the women of the house having to shave their heads and sell their hair, or do other things to make ends meet--call it poor budgeting. <br/>\n<br/>\n- <br/>\n<br/>\nGoing Green: Your Yahoo!

            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-23086762\">Hi, everybody,<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is my first post here, but I&#39;ve been signed up for quite awhile. I just could never keep up before! Anyway, I had the serendipitous occurrence this morning of randomly picking up a book as I was searching for my lost checkbook (happens a lot), and I opened said book (Women of the Mito Domain by Yamakawa Kikue) to the index area and there before me is the technical equivalence of a koku: it is 5.1 bushels or 180 liters of rice. <br/>\n<br/>\nUpon checking the index of this work (which was my initial intention anyway), I found a passage concerning the &quot;real&quot; value of koku grants:<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom page 150, a quote internally from An Oral Record of Mito History, pub. by Takase Shinkyo in the early 1900&#39;s:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;According to what an old man told me when I was fourteen or fifteen about bushi income, a family with a stipend of less than 100 koku could just make do if the household was limited to the man, his wife, and his parents. If, in addition, there were two or three children, they could not make ends meet unless the couple engaged in side jobs. Without such additional income, they would go deeper and deeper in debt. To lead a decent life, a samurai, the old man said, had to have a stipend of at least 300 koku. Asking further about this, I learned that until the time of Lords Harumori and Harutoshi (reigned 1766-1805 and 1805-16, respectively), a retainer with a stipend of 100 koku received as his actual income 72 bales of unhulled rice. This rate for stipends paid from the domain storehouses was better than that obtained by fief holders who collected their income directly from the peasants working their holdings. During the time of Lord Nariaki however, the<br/>\n domain withheld 4 bales under the pretext of &quot;borrowing back,&quot; leaving the retainer with 68 bales. This &quot;borrowing back&quot; was not limited to just one year but continued for three or even  five years at a time. Thus the sale of the actual amount of rice received from a stipend of 100 koku would not bring even twenty ryo. ...And out of this one had to pay the domain a military levy of one-half ryo for every 100 koku of one&#39;s stipend. Although at the time prices were very low, a bushi had to keep up a certain lifestyle and couldn&#39;t neglect training in the civil and martial arts. What with these pressures on his budget he had difficulties making ends meet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember reading about the pitiful travails of the Tosa retainer Tani Tannai, as he wrangled with his merchant moneylender in an attempt to pay down his debt. Somehow, the debt kept getting larger. This chronicle appears in Constantine Vaporis&#39; excellent Tour of Duty book. I felt sorry for poor old Tani, as he really had no clue about budgeting. One need only look at how Tani spent money to realize the irony of the term &quot;samurai economics.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers to all!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnnamusha<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 12/25/09, Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ltdomer98@...\">ltdomer98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\">samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Friday, December 25, 2009, 1:37 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      The key phrase is &quot;at the time&quot;--it varied wildly from period to period and even place to place within that period.
