            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1726700135\">There is no honor in wanting to start a war. There&#39;s<br/>\nplenty of honor shown by many of those who fight it.<br/>\nNot every soldier is honorable, just like not every<br/>\nsamurai was honorable. But usually it&#39;s not the<br/>\nsoldiers who want to go fight the war. Anyone who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t believe that, I&#39;ll take a poll of my friends<br/>\nand colleagues, and get back to you--I&#39;ll ask how many<br/>\nof them in Iraq and Afghanistan right now are enjoying<br/>\nthemselves, how many wanted to go and be separated<br/>\nfrom their families, etc. I doubt I&#39;ll get many<br/>\npositive responses. <br/>\n<br/>\nNate Ledbetter<br/>\nCPT, US Army<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNate,<br/>\n<br/>\nI would totally agree with this, soldiers/service personnel rarely start a<br/>\nwar, but bear the brunt of the outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Samurai spent a considerable part of their time doing things other than<br/>\nactual war, I would suggest they, like all soliders through time, accepted<br/>\ntheir duty with good grace and loyalty to their Lord/Commander, when asked<br/>\nto serve in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently reading Karl Fridays new/recent book, Samurai, Warfare and<br/>\nthe State in Early Medieval Japan, and there he discusses how Samurai were<br/>\nmore interested in progressing up the Court polictical ladder of power and<br/>\nviewed service in war as a means to an end..<br/>\n<br/>\nWhilst I am only into the second chapter, based on what I have read so far,<br/>\nI would recommend it and am looking forward to finishing it off, along side<br/>\nthe various other titles I have to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRob Broom<br/>\nWarhammer Historical General Manager<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robb@...\">robb@...</a><br/>\nwww.warhammer-historical.com</div>",
