            "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1520415744\">As one initially interested in the swordsman, and from them the <br/>\nsamurai, I have to say I treat Musashi as something of a &#39;bubble&#39; <br/>\ncharacter. He could belong to any era, and in his person and conduct <br/>\ncould hardly be considered an exemplar of samurai virtue. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis legacy as a samurai is zero, and as a swordsman rests almost <br/>\nentirely on The Book of Five Rings - he had no remarkable &#39;heritage&#39; <br/>\nin swordsmanship, and his Niten Ichi Ryu techniques were absorbed <br/>\ninto other, more prominent ryu, without making any significant impact <br/>\nupon them. He was an oddball, one might say &#39;a natural born killer.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nHistorically, there are (in my book) far more interesting characters, <br/>\nwho made an equally, if not greater, impact on the art of <br/>\nswordsmanship, and also took their place on the stage of history, a <br/>\nfew of them major players in the events of their day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBokuden, for example, out-stripped Mushashi in martial <br/>\naccomplishment, and most of his individual victories were on the <br/>\nbattlefield, which I reckon are harder fought and harder earned (and <br/>\nMushashi used every trick in the book to unsettle his opponents.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNobutsuna learned from Bokuden and fought Takeda Shingen, from whom <br/>\nhe received his name Kamizumi, and was the &#39;real deal&#39; upon which <br/>\nKurosawa modelled the scene in which Kanbei, leader of the 7 Samurai, <br/>\nrescued a child from a bandit, and who was praised as living <br/>\nthe &#39;essence of Zen&#39; in surrendering to attain victory.<br/>\n<br/>\nYagyu Munenori (hope I&#39;m getting all these names right) studied under <br/>\nNobutsuna and was an instructor to and possibly an &#39;agent of <br/>\ninfluence&#39; (real shinobi stuff here) of Tokugawa Ieyasu. At the Siege <br/>\nof Osaka when Ieyasu and his son were ambushed, Munenori attacked <br/>\nsingle-handed and took out seven men in full armour before Ieyasu&#39;s <br/>\nescort had even recovered. This stands as one of the most outstanding <br/>\nacts of swordsmanship authentically witnessed and recorded for <br/>\nposterity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tosa Swordsmen of what is now the Muso Shinden and Eishinkan Ryu <br/>\nwere some of the most active during the Meiji Restoration, Ryoma <br/>\nSakamoto among them. Another notable, Master Swordsman Tesshu, <br/>\nfounded the Muto Ryu on Bokuden&#39;s lineage, plus also the Itto Ryu. <br/>\nHis Edo Dojo was always packed with hardcore swordsmen, little <br/>\nknowing that Tesshu&#39;s intention was to tire them out in training so <br/>\nthat they wouldn&#39;t go out and make trouble. He also acted as <br/>\nintermediary between the Emperor and the Shogunate, with quite <br/>\nremarkable effect. He was also a Zen aesthete and a notable <br/>\ncalligrapher and artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just a few of the men who proved and perfected the art of <br/>\nswordsmanship, and who took their stand in the affairs of the day and <br/>\nmade their mark on history. Some, in some small way, might have <br/>\nactually altered its course.<br/>\n<br/>\nMushashi&#39;s contribution should be measured against their <br/>\nachievements, and in so doing I view him as a big man, standing among <br/>\ngiants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>",
