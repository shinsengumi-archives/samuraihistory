It has been \nviewed as virtuous since at least the Heian period. Frequently, the \ntragedy occurs before becoming a hermit, but that does not make \nactually being a hermit particularly tragic. Now then, there are some \nfamous persecuted Buddhist monks, but that is another matter. And, \nthese folks are also often heroes. Now being an exile is another \nmatter. Heike Monogatari can get positively wheepy about exiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
