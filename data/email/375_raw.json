At the commencement of\n&gt; any technique \n&gt; the practitioner is therefore seated, with his\n&gt; weight on his \n&gt; ankles, the feet flat and soles facing upward, and\n&gt; his first \n&gt; move is to rise up to allow him to turn his toes to\n&gt; get a grip \n&gt; to launch an attack.\n&gt; \n&gt; The most common seated posture, however, is tate\n&gt; hiza, sitting \n&gt; with one knee raised, the foot close in to the body,\n&gt; the other \n&gt; leg folded beneath you, bum on ankle. It is an\n&gt; uncomfortable \n&gt; posture but it allows maximum of movement, freedom\n&gt; of movement \n&gt; to pivot in any direction, and therefore gives the\n&gt; man seated \n&gt; in hiza a marked advantage over someone in seiza.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tate hiza came about because it is the easiest way\n&gt; to sit when \n&gt; wearing armour, other than on a stool. One cannot\n&gt; sit in seiza, \n&gt; which compacts the torso, without the body of the\n&gt; armour rising \n&gt; up around the neck.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another posture is iai-goshi, which is used widely\n&gt; in aikido, \n&gt; and was a combative form of hiza (probably hiza\n&gt; derives from \n&gt; it). In this both heels are raised and the toes on\n&gt; the ground, \n&gt; effectively its a squat with one knee down. It\n&gt; allows greater \n&gt; freedom of movement still, whilst keeping a low\n&gt; profile, and I \n&gt; have seen aikido practitioners move with amazing\n&gt; speed and \n&gt; change of direction in iai-goshi, &#39;running rings&#39;\n&gt; round those \n&gt; on two feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; In iai circles hiza and goshi are &#39;combative&#39;\n&gt; postures and can \n&gt; be read to imply uncertainty and mistrust in semi\n&gt; formal \n&gt; situations. A samurai sitting in hiza before his\n&gt; lord, if his \n&gt; katana was within reach, would be watched intently\n&gt; by the \n&gt; master&#39;s guards. Samurai countered this by stating\n&gt; that such a \n&gt; posture showed &#39;zanshin&#39; - the state of constant\n&gt; alertness (a \n&gt; simplified definition) and a readiness to perform\n&gt; his master&#39;s \n&gt; will.\n&gt; \n&gt; Put another way, if I was receiving an armed\n&gt; warrior, sitting \n&gt; in seiza, and he in hiza, I would probably change my\n&gt; posture \n&gt; accordingly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Trivia:\n&gt; \n&gt; It is bad manners to show the soles of one&#39;s feet\n&gt; when sitting. \n&gt; The cross-legged posture of the west is used in the\n&gt; east but \n&gt; the feet are kept tucked in to the body and the\n&gt; hakama is drawn \n&gt; in close to cover the soles without &#39;spraying&#39; all\n&gt; over the \n&gt; floor, which is dillatory and considered somewhat\n&gt; flashy or \n&gt; feminine.\n&gt; \n&gt; The practice of overlong sleeves and leggings in\n&gt; court attire \n&gt; was adopted from the Chinese court dress and had a\n&gt; useful \n&gt; benefit of hampering an attacker. The draw of the\n&gt; Katori Shinto \n&gt; Ryu utilises a &#39;roll&#39; of the wrist as the right hand\n&gt; reaches \n&gt; across to the hilt, and this serves to roll the\n&gt; sleeve back \n&gt; from the wrist and thus not hamper the draw of the\n&gt; sword.\n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai in &#39;civvies&#39; would tuck the cuffs of their\n&gt; hakama in \n&gt; the waistband and tie back their sleeves (if time\n&gt; and \n&gt; circumstance allowed).\n&gt; \n&gt; Iai techniques when all protagonists begin in\n&gt; kneeling postures \n&gt; sometimes employ the device of stamping on the\n&gt; opponent&#39;s \n&gt; hakama cuff to imobilise him prior to a strike.\n&gt; Others involves \n&gt; forcing your opponent down with your sword then\n&gt; stamping on his \n&gt; sleeve or whatever to hold him there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
