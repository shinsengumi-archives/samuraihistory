I htink Patrick\nneeds to not only appologise for passing out\ninaccurate information but also needs to appologise to\nTony of his bad language.\n\nPatrick, in case you dont know, Tony is a well known\ninternationally published author on Japanese history,\nhe is also recognised for his knwoledge and studies\n(and skills) with regards to making japanese armous,\nand I also believe a member of the SCA \n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Anthony J.
