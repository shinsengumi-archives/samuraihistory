The list seems to be a little quiet at present so I&#39;ll be \nindulgent and ramble on a bit about this film, one of my favourites.\n\nA thoroughly enjoyable movie, one reviewer commenting &quot;Kinugasa&#39;s sublime \ncontrol of color intensifies every emotion in his Academy Awardï¿½-winning \nmasterpiece, a classic 12th-century tale about a warrior whose love \ndishonors a married woman. The screen is steeped in fiery reds for chaotic \nbattle scenes, then blanketed in soothing images of white-kimonoed priests \nbeside a calm blue sea. The exquisite compositions and charged performances \nof Kazuo Hasegawa and Machiko Kyo depict a culture dedicated to order, yet \neasily rocked by passion.&quot;.\n\nAnother reviwer \nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gate-Hell-Teinosuke-Kinugasa/dp/6303073093 comments:\n\nIn 1953, Teinosuke Kinugasa (1896-1982) directed and co-adapted the \nhistorical play entitled &quot;Jigokumon&quot; (English transliteration of the \nJapanese title), which was written by Kan Kikuchi (1888-1948). The film&#39;s \nname (the same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, and \nwas released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes place in \n12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a revolt. \nDuring the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal palace in \nKyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescued by a soldier \nnamed Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revolt fails, Moritoh \nis told that he can have anything that he wants, and what he wants is Lady \nKesa to be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that she is already \nmarried to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Rather than seek \nsomething different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with Lady Kesa.\nFilmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first color films \nfrom Japan), the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exquisite. The story is \nby no means dated, though it does become somewhat predictable. Still, it is \nboth compelling and engaging and the acting is superb, especially Machiko \nKy. Memorable scenes in the film include the confusion at the royal palace, \nLaky Kesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Moritoh meeting Lady Kesa and her \naunt after the revolt, Moritoh given the choice of his heart&#39;s desire, the \nhorse races, Moritoh at the home of Lady Kesa&#39;s aunt, and the ending scenes. \nThe makeup used on Moritoh could have been better.\n\nThe film won several awards including an Oscar for Best Costume Design, an \nHonorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the prestigious \nGrand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Overall, I rate &quot;Gate of \nHell&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars. Hopefully, the film will be fully restored and \nreleased on DVD one day. I highly recommend the film.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n\nFrom: &quot;jonathan ellgen&quot; &lt;jpellgen@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 9:28 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory]\n\n\n&gt;I am working on a section of my master&#39;s thesis dealing with the Hogen \n&gt;Incident.
