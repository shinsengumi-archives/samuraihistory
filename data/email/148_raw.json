Could a samurai warrior\n| use firearms on the field of battle in any time in their history,\n| without loss of honor? I know that armies of that used ashigaru en\n| masse with these weapons , the issue for me is if the warriors\n| themselves would use them under certain conditions at all.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Samurai Archives: http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n| ---\n| To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n| samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n|\n|\n|\n| Your use of Yahoo!
