A few may go, God help them, \nbecause they liked Tom Cruise&#39;s tired exercise in emotional \nmanipulation, The Last Samurai. These people do not know what they&#39;re \nin for.\n\nThey&#39;ll get their swooshing swords and their copious blood. But \nthey&#39;ll be scratching their heads at Zatoichi&#39;s sudden bursts of \nslapstick humor, or when the entire cast partakes in a thunderous tap \ndance.\n\nCould be that only those folks going to see a film by the awesome \nJapanese talent &quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi Kitano will be content with this new \nversion of the famous Japanese hero. Kitano audaciously takes on the \ncelluloid persona of the blind, justice-seeking swordsman created in \nthe 1960s and played for decades by Shintaro Katsu.\n\nZatoichi&#39;s story is taken from the very first Katsu film in the \n1960s, about warring factions in a small town. The blind swordsman \n(played by Kitano) comes to town as a humble masseur and gambler, \nbiding his time with the dice-playing nephew of the woman who takes \nhim in. Soon, he&#39;s in the middle of a gang war.\n\nIn Kitano&#39;s samurai universe we&#39;re given wonderfully flawed and \ndimensional characters. The film is populated with bums and \nprostitutes, guys who hurt themselves because they don&#39;t know how to \nhold a sword, put-upon working-class folks, and an idiot or two.\n\nKitano has the odd ability to appeal to both the art-film lover and \nthe action-film fan (though not all of his films are gangster \nflicks). He allows bullets to fly and blood to spurt in the midst of \nsilly humor, solid storytelling and stunningly beautiful visuals. \nLike blind Zatoichi&#39;s sword sheathed in a rickety old cane, Kitano \nshows us the extraordinary hidden within the ordinary. His Zatoichi \nis no ordinary samurai story. \n\nhttp://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/custom/showtime/sfl-\nshzatoiaug20,0,251117.story?coll=sfla-features-showtime\n\n\n"
