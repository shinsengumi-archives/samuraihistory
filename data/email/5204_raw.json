The development of swordsmanship becomes \n&gt; meaningless (to me) when those involved are demigods. When \n&gt; they are simply men ... then that&#39;s something else.\n\n\nI have always thought the reality is so much more amazing than any \nfiction.  i guess 100 years of civil war truly does work a certain \nsocial darwinism.  It took almost 80 years after the Onin war for \nsomeone like Nobunaga to come along and start busting heads and \ntaking names.  The treachery, strategy, epic battles, and reality of \nthe Sengoku is probably more interesting and epic than most fiction \nbooks could ever hope for - although LOTR is way up there :P \n\nYou&#39;d have to work backwards into ancient history to find much \ncomparable, where war was everyday life for entire lifetimes.\n\n\n"
