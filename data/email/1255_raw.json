I&#39;ve heard that european blades are \ndifficult to come by in good condition due to oxidation from constant \nhandling.  \nI had heard the similar story about the samurai sword only being \ndrawn to taste blood... so I&#39;m curious, as this was the explaination \n(albiet misinformed) for the condition of samurai swords.\nI do realize that the samurai regaurded their blades more highly than \nany European blade (even x-caliber).  The famous grass cutter and \nother blades are the holy grails of Samurai Myth & Legend.  I also \nknow that if a blade is inspected they have a very special method \n(almost cermonial) to preserve the blade after inspection.  \nCan you tell us exaclty why Samurai blades have survived so long with \nso little oxidation?  Or you can tell me that I&#39;m on crack and \neverything I just said was also misinformed.  You are the expert.  I \ntrust anything you would tell us more than any other western souce.  \nThanks.\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@i...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Aldo Schepis wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; According to legend, if a samurai sword was drawn from its \nscabbard, it had\n&gt; &gt; to draw blood.  So for all intent and purposes the sword was only \ndrawn for\n&gt; &gt; fighting, practice or testing the blade.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the kukri, the knife carried by the Gurkha. And the \ncrysknife, carried\n&gt; by the Fremen on Arrakis. Not samurai swords.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n"
