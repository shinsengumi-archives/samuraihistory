One question thought, (=\r\nI would ask in Japaanes but being flame sprayed for misspeling is not worth=\r\n it). In any event is there any other Afro Americans on this forum? GOD BLE=\r\nSS YOU\n \npeace\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Matt &lt;yeom=\r\nanforbes@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Greetings all.\n&gt; \n&gt; I joined this list at the=\r\n behest of a friend, and\n&gt; noted a few things.\n\nWelcome!\n\n&gt; 1.  I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw much about the period.  &quot;Why,&quot;\n&gt; then, you ask, &quot;are \n&gt; you on here?&quot;  I =\r\nsuppose I&#39;ll learn a lot by reading\n&gt; the posts, eh? \n\nWe&#39;re all here to le=\r\narn. If we were all experts, what\nwould there to be to discuss? :)\n\nWait, I=\r\n saw a movie\n&gt; with Tom Cruise \n&gt; in it... it was called, I think, &quot;Top Gun=\r\n.&quot;  Samurai\n&gt; use F14s... \n&gt; no, &#39;fraid I&#39;m wrong.  It was a different movi=\r\ne,\n&gt; where he was on an \n&gt; island... ah, &quot;Far and Away.&quot;  No.  Wait.  I&#39;ll =\r\nget\n&gt; it.  Was it \n&gt; called &quot;The Last Scientologist&quot;? (Yes, I know,\n&gt; you&#39;r=\r\ne all grinding \n&gt; your teeth... in unison... It&#39;s like when people\n&gt; think =\r\nthat Kate \n&gt; Blanchet in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; was a good representation of\n&gt; history=\r\n for \n&gt; Tudor England.  And Ninjaburger.com is the end-all\n&gt; for learning t=\r\nhe \n&gt; history of the Ninja, you know.  [See #3 below.])\n\nThis kind of sardo=\r\nnic humor could be most welcome...it\nis humor, right?\n\n&gt; I am\n&gt; assuming th=\r\nat \n&gt; because the forum is moderated, the ratio of dross\n&gt; to content will =\r\n\n&gt; be very low, and that much of the content is going\n&gt; to be quite \n&gt; spec=\r\nific, rather than broad generalizations that we\n&gt; should all know \n&gt; becaus=\r\ne we read a book once in school.\n\nNow, now, you know what they say about as=\r\nsuming. Makes\na donkey out of you and Ming. And the Ming don&#39;t like\nthat. \n=\r\n\nSome things are quite specific. Some things are very\ngeneral. And more thi=\r\nngs than should probably get let\nin, including inside jokes. I&#39;m trying to =\r\ncut down on\nthose, but sometimes I just can&#39;t help it.\n\n&gt; 3.  Ninjaburger.c=\r\nom?  Even my pet, who has no\n&gt; opposable thumbs, and \n&gt; can barely remember=\r\n or perceive beyond\n&gt; eat/excrete/sleep, knows this \n&gt; is a joke site.  \n\nY=\r\neah, but I bet if his ninjutsu sensei told him it was\ntrue, he&#39;d believe it=\r\n. \n\n&gt; 5.  No, I&#39;m not doing a report on Samurai for school\n&gt; and need you \n=\r\n&gt; all to do my research for me.\n\nLike the guy who posted right after you? :=\r\n)\n\n&gt; 7.  No, I&#39;m not in the military, either, but kudos\n&gt; and thank you to =\r\n\n&gt; those of you who are now serving.\n\nThanks.\n\n&gt; 9.  Samurai is spelled wit=\r\nh a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot; \n&gt; Samurai is spelled \n&gt; with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;  Samu=\r\nrai is spelled with a\n&gt; &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot; \n&gt; (Thank you MS Word spellchecker=\r\n.)  This should be\n&gt; good enough to \n&gt; keep Mr. Ledbetter mollified... but =\r\nif I slip and\n&gt; spell it with \n&gt; an &quot;a,&quot; may I get a &quot;Get Out of Spelling J=\r\nail Free&quot;\n&gt; card, please?\n\nHmm...incorrectly spelling the main topic of thi=\r\ns list\nIS a heinous offense, being as you can just look at\nthe email addres=\r\ns and get it right. However, minor\nmistakes are acceptable--nobody is perfe=\r\nct. The issue\nis wilfull abuse of spelling, punctuation, and\ngrammar. If yo=\r\nu slip and type &quot;samarai&quot; once, that&#39;s\nfine. If over the course of 5 emails=\r\n you spell it that\nway 25 times, we have a problem. \n\n  I&#39;m\n&gt; sure I&#39;ll run=\r\n into \n&gt; a good reading list somewhere on a recommended\n&gt; website \n\nwww.sam=\r\nuraiarchives.com has a great list.
