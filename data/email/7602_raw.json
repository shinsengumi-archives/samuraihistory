She goes on to speculate about how some real-life ronin &quot;avenged&quot;\nTsugumo Hanshiro (the main character, played by Nakadai)&#39;s death a few\ncenturies later when Ii Naosuke was assasinated.\n \nHowever... as a historian, Joan Mellen really needs to stick to\nmovie-critiquing. I&#39;ve also read about the assasination of Ii Naosuke and it\nhas absolutely nothing about poor, impoverished ronin rising up against the\nrich ruling class. Not at all. The assasination was done by some\nanti-Tokugawa pro-Emperor forces who wished to enforce their motto of\n&quot;Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians&quot; (&quot;Sonno-Joi&quot;). These\nanti-Tokugawa forces were exponents of keeping a strict feudalism, they just\nthought that the Tokugawas, in wanting to open up the country for trade,\nweren&#39;t being strict enough in being feudal. \n \nThe only forces in the bakumatsu wars who wanted to bring any sort of\ndemocracy to the common people (which would include poor, starving ronin)\nwas Sakamoto Ryoma. Who I find to be one of the most fascinating people of\nthe bakumatsu era. He and his forces were not at all involved in the\nassassination of Ii Naosuke as far as I know. \n \nAn aside on cinema: in the new Criterion release of SEPPUKU (&quot;HaraKiri&quot;)\nJoan Mellen has an essay included. I think she learned her lesson and her\nnew essay has no references to the assassination of Ii Naosuke.\n \nNina \n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Randy Schadel\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 11:11 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Ii Clan (was RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies)\n\n\n\n3)The Ii were accused (in the person of Ii Naosuke) of being too \nstrict and cruel in dealing with anti-government factions during the \nBakumatsu era (about 230 years after the time period Hara-kiri was \nset in). This formed the basis for the events in the film Samurai \nAssassination. Personally, I&#39;ve always felt it was a bum rap. Naosuke \nwas trying his best to bring Japan into the modern era while still \nkeeping its national identity, but the many factions pulling in \ndifferent directions made it a near impossible job. This helped to \ngive the Ii clan a `bad guy&#39; image.\nI&#39;ve always found the story of Ii Naomasa fascinating. It reads like \na movie. His father was murdered when Naomasa was a child, leaving \nhim the last of his clan. He was sheltered, protected, and brought to \nadulthood by his aunt, a Buddhist nun who assumed the leadership of \nthe clan and brooked no nonsense during his childhood (sometimes even \ndressing as a man to command the respect of those she had to deal \nwith). He became one of the `4 Pillars Of Tokugawa&#39; (in most \nreckonings) and received the wound that eventually killed him while \nengaged in battle with one of the few clans that were the martial \nequals of the Ii (the Shimazu). Interestingly enough, Tokugawa Ieyasu \nblamed that famous suit of armor for being the cause of the wound.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&gt; \nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt; \n--- \n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \nSamurai\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+swords&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Sam\nurai+part&c=2&s=38&.sig=i-aS2VqspDvuosjyLvkOEQ&gt; swords \tSamurai\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+part&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Samur\nai+part&c=2&s=38&.sig=p5v93HNycsLUTd-IlYGqOA&gt; part \t\n\n  _____  \n\nYAHOO!
