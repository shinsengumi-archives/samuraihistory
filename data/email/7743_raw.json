He has a website online \nwww.michiganknives.com.  He has more blades than what he shows online.  Just \nshoot him an email and he will let you know what he has.  He gave me a great \ndeal on a tiger katana and wakizashi... 1400 for both.  Of course I was \noverseas at the time, and seems to be very pro military (probably the other \nreason I like him so much).  But his prices are some of the lowest i have \nseen for Hanwei blades.\nJust on a personal note.  I think that the hanwei blades are about as good \nas you are going to get for a katana that is made outside of japan.  \nEspecially for the price.  I have to say I really like my tiger set.  But \nnow of course by no means am I an expert.  But I practice iaido and have \nseen different swords through the various students of the class.  I myself \nhave a custom made iaito from japan... for a non live blade it is really a \ngorgeous sword.  Again can&#39;t state enough that they are very sharp!  (the \nhanwei blades).  I have both the practical plus and tiger sets... (katana&#39;s \nand wakizahi).  Both are very, very sharp.  There is a noticable difference \nin quality though from the practical plus to the tiger.  You can definitely \ntell the practical plus is made for cutting practice!\nWell I hope that helps.  Very good deal though on the sets!\n\nRobert Burns\n\n\n&gt;From: peter martinez &lt;proconsul99@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] hanwei\n&gt;Date: Thu, 29 Sep 2005 11:20:44 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a Hanwei Katana and Wakizashi so can you \n&gt;recommend a seller?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;federico trejos &lt;federicotrejos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;Good afternoon to all.\n&gt;\n&gt;I practice Iaido with a Hanwei Practical Katana.\n&gt;The story is this :  It was from a guy who used to\n&gt;practice Iaido in the same Dojo I do.   He was playing\n&gt;with the Katana ( that is the best description of what\n&gt;he was doing ) and he damaged the edge.   So he put\n&gt;the sword on sell and I bought it.   It is around 3\n&gt;and a half pounds heavier than a normal Iaito, but it\n&gt;is ok ( my arms are getting stronger, imagine what I\n&gt;can do with a Iaito !!! ).\n&gt;Before I kill the sharpenes from the edge, I can tell\n&gt;you that when I pass a sheet of paper on the mono-\n&gt;uchi of the blade, when I was close to the final of\n&gt;the mono- uchi I have to stop before cutting my\n&gt;fingers.\n&gt;In a scale from 1 to 10 on sharpenes for comercial\n&gt;swords, I give Hanwei swords a 9.\n&gt;If you have one, my advice is : do not play with it.\n&gt;It is a weapon (or mean to replay a weapon ) and is\n&gt;primary objective is to kill people.\n&gt;Japanese swords are beauty to see, to handle and to\n&gt;cut with it; but always keep in mind that it is a\n&gt;weapon.  Be respectful with it, because it will remind\n&gt;you.\n&gt;About the ability of the swordsman, I can tell you\n&gt;this old japanese saying : &quot;An excellent Katana will\n&gt;cry in the hands of a bad samurai&quot;...\n&gt;So if you are training, train hard.   And if you are\n&gt;training hard, train harder.   There is always\n&gt;something new to learn.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards to all.\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Correo Yahoo!\n&gt;Espacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis!\n&gt;Reg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;YAHOO!
