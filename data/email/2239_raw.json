You wouldn&#39;t \nknow \n&gt; precisely which timeframe the story belongs to if it wasn&#39;t for a \n&gt; brief mention of Emperor Tensho (who I think ruled in the late \n&gt; 1500s...). However, the story&#39;s a fantasy: the lead \n&gt; character &quot;Ashitaka&quot; is cursed by the toach of a Boar God (who was \nin \n&gt; turn cursed by hate, a tatarigami), and is banished from his \nvillage, \n&gt; embarking on a quest to find a way to lift his curse. In the way he \n&gt; encounters tons of people (including some samurai warlords) and \ngods \n&gt; (wolf, boar, and dear gods), yet there is never a heavy load of \n&gt; historical info; in fact, there is almost none, save the details of \n&gt; daily living in that time.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the kind of story I&#39;m writing; the historical info is more \nof \n&gt; a way to set myself into that timeframe, and to give the story \n&gt; some &quot;realistic&quot; feel to something that is mostly fantastic \n&gt; (werewolves, gods, etc...). Now, it if were something more along \nthe \n&gt; lines of &quot;Ran&quot; or &quot;Musashi&quot;, your points would be very valid (and \nI&#39;m \n&gt; with you on that aspect completely), but it&#39;s just something else. \nI \n&gt; apologize for the confusion, for I should have stated the nature of \n&gt; my story more explicitely from the beginning.\n&gt; \n&gt; And to answer your question, the target audience leans more towards \n&gt; anime/manga people than samurai history scholars/fans.\n&gt; \n&gt; p.d. so what the banner of the Shinsengumi has written is &quot;Makoto&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, tom helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Now thats Makoto!\n&gt; &gt; \tWhich incidentally is the slogan of you old friends the \n&gt; &gt; Shinsengumi. I am sorry if I offended you. look forward to \nreading \n&gt; &gt; your book.\n&gt; &gt; Tom\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
