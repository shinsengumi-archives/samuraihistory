It is a\n&gt; well-established fact that Hideyoshi could never be\n&gt; shogun. You brought up about his own lineage & I can\n&gt; confirm that not only HE but Ieyasu were not of\n&gt; Minamoto blood. \n\nHow can you confirm this? DO you have documentation?\nI&#39;d be very interested (as would we all) in seeing\nthat.\n\nTokugawa basically threatened the\n&gt; life\n&gt; of the emperor into altering his lineage. Since the\n&gt; shogun was considered to be the source of all &#39;true&#39;\n&gt; power during the era, the emperor had no choice but\n&gt; to\n&gt; make Tokugawa a &#39;Minamoto.&#39;\n\nAlso, can you document this too?\n\n\n&gt;      Yet, it\n&gt; eludes\n&gt; me that Oda Nobunaga, of Taira descent did not so\n&gt; clearly connect himself with his heritage in both\n&gt; name\n&gt; and nostalgia. \n\n\nSimple. Using the Taira name didn&#39;t give you any real\npolitical advantage or claim to an office. Not like\nthe Minamoto claim to Sei-i-taishogun or the Fujiwara\nKampaku offices. \n\n\nNate Ledbetter\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
