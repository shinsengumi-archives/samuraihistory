Measurements varied \ngreatly by location, and across different eras. Just for reference, \nthe modern measurements of rice (which are done by weight) are \nas follows. Traditionally these were measures of volume, and \nstill are in some uses.\n\n1 gou \u001b$B0l9g!!\u001b(B= 150 grams = 180cc\n10 gou = 1 shou \u001b$B0l&gt;#!!\u001b(B= 1.5 kg\n10 shou = 1 to \u001b$B0lEM!!\u001b(B= 15 kg\n4 to\u001b$B!!;MEM\u001b(B = 1 tawara \u001b$B0lI6\u001b(B = 60 kg\n10 to  = 1 koku \u001b$B0l@P\u001b(B = 150 kg = 180 liters\n\nAgain to be clear these metric equivalents are current, modern \ndefinitions. It&#39;s just to give a sense of how the units of measure \nbreak down.\n\nWhile the math doesn&#39;t work out perfectly, you can \nsee that a samurai would have roughly 5 &#39;gou&#39; of rice per day. So, \nwhile &#39;a day&#39;s worth of rice&#39; really was not a unit of measure with \nits own name, it&#39;s a pretty common conception that 1 day = 5 gou.\n\nNow this has all kind of problems. If a person really ate all 5 \ngou of rice, they would have not any left over to turn into cash. \nIn addition, there are an uncountable number of simplifications \nand assumptions in the above. But, for a quick rule of thumb that \nis fairly well accepted, I would think 5 gou per day would \nbe good enough.\n \n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
