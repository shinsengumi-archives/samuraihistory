The sword was a sacred weapon to =\r\nthe samurai but if you read \nthe rules of some old clans some of them say c=\r\nertain things like \nnobody but a certain group was allowed to use the sword=\r\n(shinsengumi). \nthe shogun was normally a master of a certain style of figh=\r\ntingand \ntaught the soldiers themselves. I still don&#39;t know why they choose=\r\n \nfarmers to become samurai all the books that i read say that samurai \nwer=\r\ne just farmers with a sword. im not sure wheather or not they had \nberserke=\r\nrs for soldiers but normally if a samurai goes into to many \nfights the sam=\r\nurai went completely berserk.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
