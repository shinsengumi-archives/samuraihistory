These elite warriors where called many\n&gt; &gt; different things in many different records.  The\n&gt; terms\n&gt; &gt; that we start to see arrising the most out of\n&gt; these\n&gt; &gt; recors is &quot;bushi&quot; and &quot;Kyuba no Michi&quot;.  These two\n&gt; &gt; terms as far as I know are the main precursors to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; famed &quot;Samurai&quot; and &quot;bushido&quot;.  While there are\n&gt; many\n&gt; &gt; terms used to describe ancient warriors of Japan\n&gt; these\n&gt; &gt; appear to be the most common.  Samrai does come\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; the meaning &quot;to serve&quot; and sybolized this idea\n&gt; &gt; throughout the history of Japan.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Not quite.\n&gt; \n&gt; The earliest terms for warriors, dating from the\n&gt; records of the seventh\n&gt; century and later, were &quot;tsuwamono&quot; or &quot;mononofu&quot;,\n&gt; or occasionally &quot;mosa.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bushi and samurai are of later development.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyuba no michi, BTW, does not refer to the person,\n&gt; but to the occupation; it\n&gt; is &quot;the WAY of the bow and horse.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
