This changes the distance between opponents and confuses \nthe \n&gt; righty as he is used to fighting other righties.\n&gt; \t During Tokugawa times left-handedness likely would have been \n&gt; an impediment to ones career so discouraged. During the sengoku \n&gt; uniform movement of large groups of men would have required \n&gt; left-handedness to be trained out of a soldier as it is today I \n&gt; believe. However, in this same era  if one were born of sufficient \n&gt; rank you might have been allowed to be a lefty especially if it \nmeant \n&gt; you excelled at the martial arts. Standing out on the battlefield \nwas \n&gt; what one wanted unlike today (nails and all...). Though I have yet \nto \n&gt; hear of &quot;the famous left-handed general...&quot;\n&gt; \tKeep in mind also that Musashi is believed by many to have \n&gt; been a south-paw, thus making it only natural for him to pick up \nthat \n&gt; second sword...\n&gt; \tStill struggling with the right hand,\n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
