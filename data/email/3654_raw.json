Over rather a few tokkuri of warm sake in recent months he has b=\r\neen regaling me with stories of when he served in Manchuria, much as my gra=\r\nndfather did with his stories from North Africa, Italy, the Middle East and=\r\n India. He clearly found that while officers were more than often not of sa=\r\nmurai stock, but considered themselves the successors of that class, perhap=\r\ns in a similar manner to which many yakuza consider themselves modern samur=\r\nai.\nSo why did they carry swords? Why do officers in many officers around t=\r\nhe world carry swords? If you view the photographs of the carnage on the We=\r\nstern Front during WW1 you will still see officers leading their troops swo=\r\nrd in hand. Why? Distinction.  Still, the officer has to be seen as superio=\r\nr to his/her men/women (not to be accused of sexism) and the sword is an ob=\r\nvious symbol universally of such a principle.  A man with a sword has alway=\r\ns ranked higher than one with a spear or musket.\nM.Lorimer \n\nCesare Polengh=\r\ni &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote: \n\nOn Feb 5, 2004, at 10:54 AM, Josh Wilson=\r\n wrote:\n\n&gt; Tony, not to dispute you, but why was your response about the of=\r\nficers \n&gt; considering themselves samurai incorrect??
