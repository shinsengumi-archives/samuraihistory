Sorry if I sound ignorance but alot=\r\n of illnesses/ailments are pushed down within a family like heart poldems a=\r\nnd other stuff. And if having the same ailments means you have a curse, nee=\r\nd that means almost everyone has been cursed. But sorry about your family.\n=\r\n\n     \n   \n  -Yes, this is for real.  She never told us kids til we were ol=\r\nder \nand could understand.  The Japanese culture is ridden with many \nstran=\r\nge concepts, my mother believes some really strange things.  \nBut if I wasn=\r\n&#39;t affected, I wouldn&#39;t be asking.  I do not believe in \nmost things, but t=\r\nhis is not a joke.I also have 2 grown daughters \nthat are affected by this =\r\ncurse.  Also my brother and 2 sisters.  \nIt&#39;s not possible for all of us to=\r\n have common ailments, all \nobtained in different manners.  I still have fa=\r\nmily in Japan, they \nhave come her to the states and the language barrier i=\r\ns a true \nobstacle.  The ways of life that they have is so different than w=\r\nhat \nwe have here.  So don&#39;t make light of it, it just shows your \nignoranc=\r\ne.  All I want is to know if it&#39;s possible to reverse it.  \nSam -- In samur=\r\naihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\nlistowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ar=\r\ne you for real? (Just thought I&#39;d get that in before Tony)\n&gt; \n&gt; That aside,=\r\n I&#39;ve noticed that Japanese families have this concept \nof \n&gt; a &quot;family cur=\r\nse&quot; that I&#39;ve never seen in the US (except in \nmovies), \n&gt; and have obsessi=\r\nons that they are afflicted by it, and have thier \n&gt; little &quot;put the salt o=\r\nn the door&quot; rituals to keep the evil spirits \nat \n&gt; bay. I&#39;ve seen it first=\r\nhand (the obsessions, not the results).  \nNot \n&gt; much more to say, other th=\r\nan I don&#39;t think family curses are \nreal... \n&gt; at all, but that is my own p=\r\nossibly eccentric and idiosyncratic \n&gt; opinion. To be cliche, the more you =\r\nbelieve in it, the more real \nit \n&gt; becomes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think John Edward=\r\ns posts to the list, but someone here \nmore \n&gt; attuned to the supernatural =\r\nmight be able to help you out more \nthan I.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;Natalie&quot; &lt;robbins.s@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was born in Japan,=\r\n Japanese mother, caucasian father.  My \nmother \n&gt; told \n&gt; &gt; me that her fa=\r\nmily history was samurai.  She also told me about \na \n&gt; curse \n&gt; &gt; placed o=\r\nn her/our family for the many deaths caused by them.  I \nam \n&gt; &gt; curious to=\r\n know if this was indeed true and if it was just our \n&gt; family \n&gt; &gt; that wa=\r\ns cursed or all samurai that was cursed.  I will be \nhonest to \n&gt; &gt; say tha=\r\nt the curse is still intact and still affects us.  I do \nnot \n&gt; want \n&gt; &gt; t=\r\no go into detail, but is it possible to end this suffering on \nour \n&gt; &gt; fam=\r\nily or is this something that will plague us forever?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoi=\r\nn the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon=\r\n2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives =\r\nstore: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS =\r\n\n        Samurai   Japan   Japan airline \n    \n----------------------------=\r\n-----\n  YAHOO!
