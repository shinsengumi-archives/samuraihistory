I did mean &quot;feudal&quot; in the very broad sense. Much in both\ncultures had nothing in common - the complete lack of mobility among\ncommoners in Europe and, if I understand correctly, freedom of movement in\nJapan as just one small example.  I really appreciate the reading\nreferences.  My problem has been what authors to read and is it in English.\nYour recommendations are of enormous help.\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 28, 2009 at 9:01 PM, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dennis--\n&gt;\n&gt; There are parallels, but be careful of oversimplifying the similarities.\n&gt; Most serious scholars consider Japan&#39;s system semi-feudal in relation to the\n&gt; European model, and in reality the &quot;feudal&quot; period in Japan ended prior to\n&gt; 1500. Being as I&#39;m in Afghanistan right now I don&#39;t have any access to my\n&gt; notes or books, so I can&#39;t quote anything for you, but if you&#39;re interested\n&gt; in the academic take on things, I highly recommend Japan Before Tokugawa,\n&gt; edited by John Whitney Hall, which covers a lot of the transition both into\n&gt; and out of the feudalistic system. Of course, I already mentioned Government\n&gt; in Japan 500-1700, also by Hall. In addition, it&#39;s worth checking out\n&gt; several of the books by both William Wayne Farris and Karl Friday--they tend\n&gt; to see things from different angles, but Hired Swords by Friday is an\n&gt; excellent explanation of how the warrior class came into being.\n&gt;\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t matter what your primary area of interest is (mine happens to be\n&gt; the Sengoku, with some deviation into the Ashikaga bakufu), it&#39;s important\n&gt; to understand the economic system and how things evolved to that point. I\n&gt; was never really interested in pre-Nara period until I read Hall&#39;s book and\n&gt; saw how that initial formation of taxation and government systems laid the\n&gt; foundation for every thing that came after, including the social\n&gt; institutions and class systems. Now, personally I have no interest in the\n&gt; Edo period, so my research usually stops around 1615, but if that is your\n&gt; cup of tea, it&#39;s worth doing at least a little digging into what comes\n&gt; before it so you understand the framework and WHY certain things came into\n&gt; being.\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Dennis Sheridan &lt;ldsheridan@... &lt;ldsheridan%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com &lt;samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Mon, December 28, 2009 8:13:52 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku\n&gt; Onnamusha, I really appreciate that you, and Nate and Deborah, have taken\n&gt; the time to respond to my question. I have learned much from your\n&gt; responses, and have references for further reading. So thank you! In my\n&gt; limited reading, I get the impression the feudal system in Europe has\n&gt; parallels in Japanese history. Both had a small population that controlled\n&gt; most of the wealth and power, with everyone else left pretty much to thier\n&gt; own devices - as long as there was no boat rocking.\n&gt; ._,_.___\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
