In a book I was recently reading,=\r\n &quot;Young Japan: Yokohama and Yedo&quot; by John R. Black, the author writes about=\r\n witnessing an execution sometime in the 1860`s in the Tobe area of Yokoham=\r\na. Also a journalist in Japan in 1880 wrote a story about the execution gro=\r\nund. You can see the story here: \n\nhttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.ht=\r\nml?res=3DFB0B10FA3F551A7493C0A81782D85F448784F9 \n\nI have been living in Yok=\r\nohama for 4 years and was quite surprised to hear about this bleak part of =\r\nYokohama`s past. I figure there must be some kind of memorial, shrine or, a=\r\nt least a sign marking the site - but, thus far, no luck at all in finding =\r\nit. \n\nThanks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have bee=\r\nn removed]\n\n\n"
