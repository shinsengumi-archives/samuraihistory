I have started buying or trying to buy\nKatana swords. I have looked up all I could find around here. (I have to\ndrive 25 miles to the library to find out that they don&#39;t carry that sort of\nreading) I have started trying to buy books on the subject of the katana and\ncame up with The Book of Five Rings, By Miyamoto Musashi, This was a very\ngood book! Now Can anybody lead me to more about my swords? Like the 47\nRonin, These things I know nothing about...
