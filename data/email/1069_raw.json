However,  From what I \nhave read these are the thoughts the I have come up with conderning \nninja.  Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu , the oldest documented \nmartial art in Japan dating from the 1400&#39;s, includes ninjutsu \ntraining in it ciriculum.  It is about 600 years old, while the \nBujinkan claims to have a lineage dating back over 800 years.  I \nthink that the original ninja were actually samurai.  Smaurai that \nspecialized in the ninjutsu techniques of one of the ryu they \nstudied.  Yagyu Jubei is an example.  He was a samurai, but is well \nknown for acting as a ninja.  Of course this is just one example.  \nDurring the Tokugawa period there were a large number of ronin in \nJapan.  The idea of the freelance ninja probably developed from this \ntime.  Ronin who had been trained in nijutsu techniques would sell \ntheir services, and teach others.  This is when ,I think, ninjutsu as \na seperate clandestine art developed.  This is also when history and \nmyths got mixed together and gave the idea that ninja had a long \nhistory.  Or maybe the instrustors at that time told their students \nthat there was a long history.  And those histories have been taught \nto modern students.  Now before I get too many indictments \nfor &quot;ninjutsu bashing&quot;  let me say this.   I am not saying ninjutsu \nis a good or bad art to train in.  I studied ninjutsu myself before I \ndeveloped my interest in the samurai.  I am only speaking of history \nhere.  For more information this is a good article \nhttp://www.koryubooks.com/library/ninjutsu.html\nDr. Karl Friday holds a Menkyo Kaiden (highest rank possible) in \nKashima Shin Ryu, one of the oldest documented ryu.  He is also a \ntrained historian and is professor in University of Georgia&#39;s history \ndepartment.  Once again I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on this so I am \nvery open to others opinions and inforamtion.  Just try to remain \nacademic and don&#39;t get too personal *lol*.   \n\n\n\n"
