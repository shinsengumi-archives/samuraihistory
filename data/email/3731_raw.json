Most of the board\nwould do anything for the opportunity. I had to suffer\na second year on the Korean DMZ to get here. \n\nat first I was not\n&gt; looking foreward to it, mostly bcos I dont speak the\n&gt; language.. but many ppl have been telling me I&#39;ll do\n&gt; just fine that they are very westernized and most\n&gt; ppl, especially the younger ones (in my age backet)\n&gt; speak english.. \n\nIf you don&#39;t mind, how old are you? Be careful what\nyou assume by &quot;speak english&quot;--many are familiar with\nthe language, can read it (mostly), but SPEAKING it is\nsomething entirely different. Many people can speak\nenough to help you find the grocery store or show you\nan English menu, but I wouldn&#39;t expect in depth\nconversations on astro-physics. \n\nthe Japanese are adopting English words\n&gt; into their own language..\n\nAnd making them Japanese. One of the hardest things\nfor me in Japanese is trying to figure out what the\n&quot;adopted&quot; english word is when a Japanese says it. I\nhad to look up a few--&quot;Borantia&quot; (Volunteer) is the\nexample that comes to mind, but frequently the words\nare used out of normal English context or are just\nplain unrecognizable. \n\n History, tradition and a\n&gt; sense of who I am culturaly is really important to\n&gt; me.. so on one hand I was pretty relieved to hear\n&gt; that they are westernizing and that I will get along\n&gt; fine over there, but on the other hand, I feel sorry\n&gt; bcos in a way they are loosing that.. \n\nJapan is still Japan, always will be. Are Americans\nany less American because they don&#39;t wear cowboy hats\nand six-shooters? Even Japan&#39;s modernization is\nuniquely Japanese--I wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;Westernizing&quot;.\nFor example, any of us from the West can tell you that\nyou walk into a Japanese McDonald&#39;s and it&#39;s a\ncompletely DIFFERENT experience than it is in the US\nor Europe. \n\nit seems\n&gt; Mishima was in his own....whacko little way, was\n&gt; just trying to point this out to ppl.. does anyone\n&gt; else not see this or see modern Japan as being &quot;sell\n&gt; outs&quot; in a way??\n\nNo more than anyone else. \n\nI&#39;d be happy to continue this discussion, but we\nshoudl probably take it to the modern history board.\nKitsuno, can you post the link again??\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
