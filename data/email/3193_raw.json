I think Hideyori was snuck out of Osaka\n&gt; castle via the elevator \n&gt; &gt; in the center before being whisked off to Kyushu\n&gt; to live out his \n&gt; &gt; remaining years in seclusion.  Bet that was the\n&gt; last place the \n&gt; &gt; attacking Samurai would have thought to look,\n&gt; &quot;Tono, Hideyori \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t be in the elevator, it says &#39;in case of\n&gt; fire, use stairs&#39;!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; That would be an excellent point. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Taking the cowardly elevator would be on par to\n&gt; Ishida&#39;s escaping Ieyasu&#39;s \n&gt; clutches dressed as a woman. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
