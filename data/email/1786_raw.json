While this period \nis ripe for &quot;novelization&quot;, Hollywood it seems always chooses the \nwriters and directors who have the least knowledge, the least \naffinity for the subject.As a film it may be great entertainment , as \nhistory it is an insult to the subject and the audience.\n\tThe Satsuma rebellion, on which this is loosely based did not \nfeature 16th century cavalry units against 19th century rifle units. \nThe truth is that the restoration wars, featured a mish-mash of \ntechnologies but it was the modern trained and outfitted rifle units \nthat proved most effective. It was the Shoguns&#39; army that had the \nmost dead weight in the form of sword, spear and bow wielding units.\n\tOnce the Satsuma men quit the new government, they returned \nto their home but NOT to the 16th century. While some of the \nirregulars who fought under Saigo may have worn older armour it was \nonly for lack of more modern arms. The units of swordsmen that \ndevastated the Emperors troops at Tabaruzaka only did so while the \nweather and terrain was advantageous to them.\n\tI&#39;ll be there, you may count on that but I am afraid that \nonce again faced with presenting a nuanced, intelligent, tale from \nhistory, the Hollywood movie machine has chosen to dumb it down to a \ntale of good vs. evil.\nTobaku!Tobaku! MataTobaku!\n-t\n\n"
