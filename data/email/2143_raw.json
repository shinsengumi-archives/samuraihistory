I was using the term as told to me years ago by\n&gt; hatsumi masaaki\n&gt; \n&gt; paul\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; My understanding of &#39;Kunoichi&#39; is that it is simply a\n&gt; breakdown of \n&gt; the Japanese kanji for &#39;woman&#39; (onna) -- The three\n&gt; &#39;katakana&#39; symbols \n&gt; that make up kunoichi are also the three strokes that\n&gt; make up &#39;onna&#39; -\n&gt;  the &#39;ku&#39; is the left, the &#39;no&#39; is the right hand\n&gt; slash, and \n&gt; the &#39;ichi&#39; is the line across the top.  basically, if\n&gt; you slide the \n&gt; katakana &#39;ku no ichi&#39; together you get &#39;onna&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Richardson Paul\n&gt; &lt;umaryu@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; female ninja are called kunoichi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; the ku no ichi are 3 different katakana and is I am\n&gt; &gt; told supposed to represent the 9 (ku) orifices that\n&gt; &gt; men have +1 (ichi) extra that women have.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; who know s this may be also be myth\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; paul\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
