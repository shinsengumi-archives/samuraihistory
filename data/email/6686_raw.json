So in my opinion, he was the most important, although \nhis death prevented HIM from being the one to complete the mission.  \nHideyoshi, the one to actually UNIFY Japan, had an heir (Hideyori, Nobunaga&#39;s \ngrandnephew) but the people who succeeded him ultimately were too weak to be &quot;regents&quot; \nuntil that child came of age.  But his disarming of  the people helped \nsolidify his hold on things.  (Was Hideyoshi the one to disarm the people?)  So \nunified Japan was in place when Tokugawa was name Shogun in 1603.  However, I \ndon&#39;t think necessarily it was a case of Ieyasu being in the right place at the \nright time.  From what I&#39;ve read here on the list and elsewhere, it was a matter \nof time before Ieyasu challenged Hideyoshi and took command of things, \nespecially after Sekigahara in 1600, which, to my mind, &quot;sealed the deal&quot; as it \nwere.\n       This may all be conjecture so anyone else have anything to add or \ncorrect?\n       Take care, y&#39;all.  :-)\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
