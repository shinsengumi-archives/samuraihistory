I am not \n&gt;saying they were less honorable.  But the ideal of going off and \n&gt;killing all the bad muslim people (just a statement of the feeling of \n&gt;the time of the knights, I have nothing against muslims as a group) \n&gt;for the glory of god and holy mother church or you will burn in hell \n&gt;for all eternity does not seem any more honorable.  \n&gt;\nI agree, most of them by modern standards were thugs and killers. I&#39;m \ntalking more about the ideal knight, who is supposed to protect those \nweaker than himself, practice charity, and otherwise act like a decent \nsort of guy. These are ideals that were put forward by bards and others \nin that period. Also there is quite a bit of difference between \nface/shame cultures and guilt/sin cultures and I&#39;m hopelessly Western in \nmy outlook towards these two approaches. Now in reality it&#39;s never that \nclearcut, but I&#39;m only talking about perfection here, something I&#39;ve \nnever really approached closely except for idiocy.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Scott &lt;scottc_4@...&gt;&quot; &lt;scottc_4@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Heaven and Earth Review\n&gt;\n&gt;I read the review of Heaven and Earth that was linked here a while \n&gt;ago when I asked about the movie on DVD.  I can tell that guy didn&#39;t \n&gt;like it, and I think he sees Kurasawa as god, at least he acts like \n&gt;it.  \n&gt;\nHe some ways he should, Kurosawa was a great director, his earlier films \nwere excellent and not just the chanbara ones. Rent High and Low from a \nvideo store if possible or some of the other films he made in the middle \nof his career. Still won&#39;t mind seeing Heaven and Earth one time. Even \nbad chanbara is better that the best Hollywood teen comedy.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;eatswithscissorsrunswithmonkeys&quot; &lt;intp@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: To put this in perspective\n&gt;\n&gt;This &#39;I wanna be a Sammy-rai&#39; conversation is analgous to \n&gt;a bunch of Japanese people sitting in Japan right now \n&gt;saying \n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I wanna be a confederate! \n&gt;\nThere are some, I&#39;ve met them. Scary thought eh?\n\n&gt;If that makes no sense, then you get my point.  If not, \n&gt;you&#39;re a nut.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSanity is not my strong point, so what&#39;s another nut among otaku?\n\n&gt;Lol ;)\n&gt;Could everybody speak in french please? , i will understand better then ;)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHow about in Japanese? It might be closer to on topic. Better still \nfuedal period Japanese. There might be one or two on the list that could \nread it! ^_^ Happier than my current reading assignment at least, \nChinmoku, where I get to learn all the delightful words for torture, \npain and suffering and the happy fate of the Christians in Japan.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"
