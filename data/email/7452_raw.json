It desc=\r\nribes Saigo Takamori&#39;s life and the War \nof the Southwest (also known as th=\r\ne Satsuma Rebellion). It&#39;s \ninteresting to note that Saigo used several nam=\r\nes when corresponding \nwith other people. One of the names Saigo Takamori u=\r\nsed when writing \npoetry was &#39;Saigo Nansh=FB&#39; which means Saigo of the Sout=\r\nh. With\nthis name Saigo refers to the Southern Court (Go-Daigo&#39;s Southern \n=\r\nline). Torn between truly unifying (under the Emperor) and \nmodernizing Jap=\r\nan and his loyalty towards the ideals of the samurai \nclass and his Lord Sh=\r\nimazu, Saigo&#39;s life was interesting indeed.\n\nNahless\n\nP.S. Should you have =\r\nspecific questions about this book, just let me \nknow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
