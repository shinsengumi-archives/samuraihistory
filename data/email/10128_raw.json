As such, they cannot be taken as objec=\r\nts of refuge. However, because of their relative existence as relative gods=\r\n, they can be paid respect to, and thus, shrines within the Temple grounds =\r\nare common for such things.\n=C2=A0Even in other countries, like Bhutan or T=\r\nhailand, you will see this respect paid in such a way.=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0Within Buddhism --- which actually is a western word.. the real name =\r\nof the religion is simply &quot;The Teachings of Actual Truth as expressed by th=\r\ne Buddhas&quot; .. a.k.a. The Dharma or Buddha Dharma....=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0In Buddha=\r\n Dharma,=C2=A0 you can show respect to any class of sentient being, includi=\r\nng gods, as long as you don&#39;t worship them or take them as your refuge. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 So.. paying respect and h=\r\nomage and even making an offering is fine. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0In this way, &quot;Budd=\r\nhism&quot; does not conflict with most religions, especially religions like shin=\r\nto.=C2=A0 The only religions in conflicts with are the religions were a god=\r\n demands you take him/her as your sole refuge (most Monotheistic religions)=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0Sometimes, earthly gods vow to protect dharma and assist the=\r\n Sangha...and they become Worldly Protectors.=C2=A0 It is important to note=\r\n that Worldly Protectors are earth gods associated with Dharma... and that =\r\n&quot;Dharma Protectors&quot; are actually projections/emanations of Buddhas/Bodhisat=\r\ntvas.=C2=A0 Thus, sometimes you see sangha members treating a protector wit=\r\nh refuge, it might look weird. However, if you know they are not a Worldly =\r\nProtector, but a Dharma Protector, then you understand they are paying refu=\r\nge to a Buddha.=C2=A0 So you need to know if that being is a worldly protec=\r\ntor or a dharma protector. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 In the ea=\r\nrlier letter, it sounded like he (Eddie?)=C2=A0was saying that Buddha&#39;s God=\r\n was Amida ? Maybe I read that wrong-- but let me just correct this just in=\r\n case.\n=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0 Buddha has no god. This is because Dharma teaches two=\r\n realities 1.) relative and 2.) Absolute.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0The=C2=A0 relative r=\r\neality is &quot;run&quot; by Interdependet Origination, which manifest as different t=\r\nypes of karma (Yes.. there are actually different types of karma, not just =\r\n&quot;karma&quot;). This system is, in a nutshell, a system of cause-and-result. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\n=C2=A0The absolute truth is the buddhanature a.k.a. nature of mind etc.=\r\netc... \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 At no point in this equation is there a &quot;god&quot;.=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0Amida, better known as Amitabha or Amitayus (Infinite =\r\nLight) (Infinite Life)... is the Buddha who radiates the &quot;western paradise&quot;=\r\n..=C2=A0=C2=A0 which, in all seriousness, is like a world that was purified=\r\n due to Amitabha&#39;s enligthenment.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0 How did this happen ?\n=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 Because of Interdependent Origination.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0Amitabha made=\r\n a series of vows and those vows were interdependent with his awakening. As=\r\n he awoke, these vows ripened.=C2=A0 Most Buddhas have some kind of &quot;relate=\r\nd power&quot;.. that upon awakening, their vow ripens into that power ...so to s=\r\npeak.=C2=A0 Amitabha vowed that his awakening would be interconnected with =\r\nthe pufication of the world he was practicing on, and that once he attained=\r\n enlightenment, his radiance would produce this pure field. \n=C2=A0=C2=A0 A=\r\nnother vow that was ripened was that if you focus on Amitabha PROPERLY, you=\r\n can connect with his radiance from your concentration meeting with his rip=\r\nened vow. \n=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0 O.k... many people have seemingly misunderstood h=\r\now this works. Most Amitabha practice was become really just Buddha-Christ=\r\n=C2=A0 god-worshiping and &quot;save me Oh Amida!&quot; kinda of methodology.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The real idea is that you take Amitabha, the Pure Land, =\r\nHis vows..etc.etc.. AS YOUR OBJECT OF CONCENTRATION... and through the proc=\r\ness of meditating and concentrating on these, you will create the connectio=\r\nn with it. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 It is actually suppose to be a form of meditation=\r\n... not salvation worship.=C2=A0 However, as most of the common folk, such =\r\nas farmers and merchents, don&#39;t have time, leisure, or training on how to p=\r\nroperly concentrate on an object or to meditate, the system of &quot;Amida&#39;s sal=\r\nvation if you call out to him&quot; came into effect...\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0because, if=\r\n their faith in Amitabha can be sustain in their mind, they will KEEP Amita=\r\nbha in their thoughts constantly...\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0.. then this MIGHT produce=\r\n the same result as if you were properly meditating on Amitabha.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 However, this must be understood to be an=\r\n alteration to the actual program/system of accomplishing the Pure Land. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\nAmitabha was never taught, by the Buddhas, to be a &quot;god&quot; or a &quot;savior&quot; --- =\r\nHe is a meditation technique, actually.=C2=A0 All four variations of the Pu=\r\nre Land sutra teach this, and in the esoteric Amitabha rituals teach this a=\r\ns well.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0=C2=A0 In this case :=C2=A0=C2=A0 &quot;Faith&quot; =3D &quot;Mental =\r\nConcentration&quot;\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 It should be noted that one can make contact, =\r\nin theory, with ANY Buddha or Bodhisattva via this method of mental concent=\r\nration, not just Amitabha.=C2=A0 The &quot;key difference&quot; of Amitabha is the be=\r\ning born into the Pure Field part. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0I hope this puts this into proper=\r\n perspective. \n\n--- On Tue, 2/16/10, Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt; wrote:\n\n=\r\n\nFrom: Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Shinto a=\r\nnd Buddhism\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Tuesday, February 16, =\r\n2010, 11:08 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nEddie--\n\nMy understanding of the history is tha=\r\nt Shinto is an animistic religion \nindigenous to Japan, and that there was =\r\na certain degree of tension between \nBuddhism and Shinto when Buddhism was =\r\nfirst introduced (as you said) from \nChina, but that the two religions beca=\r\nme, if not precisely syncretic, then at \nleast interwoven -- that it was to=\r\n a large extent held that the kami of \nShinto were genuine entities who, li=\r\nke all others, could benefit from the \nBuddha&#39;s enlightenment. (Hence the f=\r\nact that Shinto shrines are such a common \nfixture in so many Buddhist temp=\r\nles).\n\nI got the impression that this changed substantially during the Meij=\r\ni \nrestoration and into WWII, when the government pressed the notion of the=\r\n \nImperial lineage (the descent from Amaterasu-o- Mikami) as evidence that =\r\nJapan was \nunder the unique protection of the gods / kami, as a result of w=\r\nhich a very \nstrict separation of church and state was written into the pos=\r\nt-war \nconstitution. ..\n\nAm I missing anything substantial here? My persona=\r\nl experience of Japan \nwas that the temples and shrines were largely apprec=\r\niated for their historic \nnature; I seldom saw religious ceremonies going o=\r\nn (apart from New Year&#39;s \nDay, when people arrived, made their offerings, a=\r\nnd departed) the way I did \nin Korea, for example.
