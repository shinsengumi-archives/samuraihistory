I wanted to know the meaning of the name &quot;Iwamura&quot; in case I \ncan\n&gt; &gt; apply a metaphorical meaning to it. The meaning turns out to be\n&gt; &gt; perfect (Rock village) for the story...in this way I would like to\n&gt; &gt; find out meanings on other names, to make them &quot;fit&quot; the character\n&gt; &gt; (another one is Makoto, which I believe means &quot;honor&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Makoto&quot; means &quot;truth.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t think too much about meaning and names. It gets obnoxious. \nAre girls named &quot;Rose&quot; really flowers? Are all guys\n&gt; named &quot;Thomas&quot; twins?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n"
