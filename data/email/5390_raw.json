They basically had\n&gt; thier panel of \n&gt; pretty boys and girls answer multiple choice\n&gt; questions about ninja.   \n&gt; Apparently, the &quot;flying ninja&quot; trick with the square\n&gt; shaped cloak \n&gt; could work in theory, but my question is, if so, why\n&gt; did it take 1000 \n&gt; years and the wright brothers to prove it?  Also,\n&gt; they talked about \n&gt; how ninja can jump 2.4 meters straight up, and can\n&gt; long jump two \n&gt; parked volvos.  So of course they said &quot;ooh, if we\n&gt; had ninja in the \n&gt; olympics this time, we would win every event!&quot; The\n&gt; only useful bit of \n&gt; info I got from it is that ninja dont wear thier\n&gt; swords over thier \n&gt; shoulder because it is too hard to draw - except\n&gt; when they are \n&gt; crawling under a house.  \n\nOn friday night (I think) I saw a show that was\nbasically counting down the silliest blunders in\nhistory, or at least that&#39;s what I got out of it.\nAnyways, one of their countdown was about\nNobunaga--basically, the theory went that the reason\nMitsuhide turned against him and attacked was that\nNobunaga &quot;propositioned&quot; Mitsuhide&#39;s wife, and she hit\nhim on the head with a fan. So after that, Nobunaga\ndid his best to humiliate Mitsuhide, including hitting\nhim on the head with...a fan. Hmm...\n\nOf course, this same show had Ieyasu stopping at a\nfood stall prior to the battle of Mikata-ga-hara,\nhearing the Takeda army coming while mid-dango, and\nrunning off without paying--the old lady running the\nstall apparently chased him down after a couple miles\nand made him pay. Later on, after the battle, he gets\nback to his castle, and his retainers unsaddle his\nhorse, finding &quot;unchi&quot; on the saddle--and Ieyasu\nclaims it&#39;s &quot;yakimiso&quot;...\n\nI&#39;d heard part 2 of that one before--just not sure of\nthe physics of it, being as he was wearing armor and\nall. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
