The code was promoted by the Tokugawa shoguns, so as to turn\nthe now redundant samurai class in to administrators and warriors\n(individual fighters) rather than soldiers (team players), to help\nensure continuing peace. This policy was so effective that after the\ndreadful performance of the samurai in their attempts to put down the\nShinabara rebellion of mainly farmers in 1638, the planned invasion of\nthe Philippines was cancelled and the country completely sealed. So when\nreading anything on Bushido, keep in mind its political purpose.\n\nYours\nDean \nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
