And why so slight curvature in a 17th\ncentury blade ?\nIt=\r\n resemble to me no &#39;&#39;black color&#39;&#39; rust in the tang but it may be due\nto th=\r\ne flash light surely used to take the photos. The handle is rather\nlong, su=\r\nggesting a possible ancestral blade, but... also the signature\nseems to me =\r\ntoo much well preserved for having 300 years, as the sharp\nangles of the ta=\r\nng and mekugi-ana. Sharpness may be explained with a\nborders re-shaping (sa=\r\nving the signature) to fit with the kyugunto\nmounting but I am still not ab=\r\nle to see filemarks, whether the kanji are\nrather good visible. Without jih=\r\nada, boshi and a closer image of at\nleast little part of the hamon is hard =\r\nto determine the school. If this\npatterns do not match with the signature ?=\r\n\nMay be a new swordsmith signature of later time? Because effectively, if\no=\r\nld, is hard to think of a fake with such a signature, but nowadays some\nfak=\r\ners make the same reasoning.\nHonestly, signature is the last thing I see to=\r\n, while here we have to\nwork with it as the first step. And to be sincere, =\r\nI was not able to\nread it as good as you have made. I have thinked about th=\r\ne little label\n:\nsurrenders swords had such a lebel to make it easy to give=\r\n back\n(eventually...) the blade to the formerly owner, and this may suggest=\r\n\nthe blade was of a certain interest.\nBut this is not a rule in kantei (fak=\r\nes of surrenders blade with\n&#39;&#39;dedications&#39;&#39; have a their own market...). If=\r\n Scott would see at the\nback of the handle and other details comparing it t=\r\no the description\nshown in the part of the article I have posted, may be we=\r\n can argue if\nthe mounting was intended for a High officer, enforcing the &#39;=\r\n&#39;ancestral\nblade&#39;&#39; theory.\nBy the way, Gen. Yamashita&#39;s sword was of the sa=\r\nme period... \nPlease have no trouble to refute my suggestions as I&#39;m taking=\r\n this as a\nlearning session, with a lot of fun.   \nThanks for your time.\nCa=\r\nrlo\n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@toryu-mon.=\r\ncom] \nInviato: mercoled=EC 7 maggio 2003 9.06\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups=\r\n.com\nOggetto: Re: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\nCarlo-\n\tScott has=\r\n the translation so he can easily straighten us out \nand the mountings are =\r\nclearly wartime production. Without further \ninfo though, I stand by my tra=\r\nnslation. The Nihonto Meikan lists five \nKatsuyoshi using this kanji, but o=\r\nnly one who signed in this manner. \nThe shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the sc=\r\nhool of Sengo Masashige. \nMasashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa.=\r\n Banshu Katsuyoshi \nwas originally from the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and work=\r\ned around the \nTenna era (1681-1683).\n\tOne would expect to see some charact=\r\neristics of the Sengo \nschool in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and mo=\r\nnouchi are \nimportant. I agree no final determination can be made without s=\r\nword \nin hand, but I would posit that a faker or &#39;tribute&#39; sword would \nhar=\r\ndly choose to copy the work of a late generation smith from a \nlittle known=\r\n line.\nTom\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nSamu=\r\nrai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this =\r\ngroup, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYou=\r\nr use of Yahoo!
