I&#39;m producing Sendai dou now and another set of kusazuri is \n&gt;do-able.\n\nNo, he never got back to me. He&#39;s a medic in the services and is hopping\naround rather a lot at the moment, but I&#39;ll have another go at trying to\nget hold of him and I&#39;ll get back to you.\n\nAt some point soon I need to talk to you (off list) about making some\nother bits and pieces for myself etc., but it&#39;ll have to wait for a\ncouple of months as I&#39;ve got way too much &quot;stuff&quot; going on at the\nmoment, including our first true largish scale historical display at the\nend of August and our second two weeks later at the Will Adams Festival,\nGillingham, Kent, England.\n\nAnyway cheers for the moment.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
