Please look up &quot;kirisute\n&gt; gomen.&quot; \n&gt; And no samurai ever called his sword &quot;shinken.&quot;\n&gt; That&#39;s a \n&gt; modern term.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   So he never kill as an assasin.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, he did a lot of the time. Samurai also\n&gt; lied, \n&gt; cheated, and betrayed people.\n&gt; \n&gt; They were HUMAN, not comic-book heroes or cardboard\n&gt; cutouts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In previous Japan\n&gt; &gt; eras, Hitokiri were in their majority Ronin paid\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; someone to kill another person due to usually\n&gt; &gt; political reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hitokiri?\n&gt; \n&gt; Please read history instead of manga, and try\n&gt; watching less \n&gt; anime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And if some one wants to kill his self, please do\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; use Sepukku.   Sepukku is a ritual designed to\n&gt; give\n&gt; &gt; back the dignity of a person who falls in disgrace\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; showing that his blood is red (then pure, and no\n&gt; &gt; stained or black blood ).  \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;smacks head against desk&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\nI&#39;m not sure if i should laugh hysterically, or weep\nendlessly.\n----Michael Arndt\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
