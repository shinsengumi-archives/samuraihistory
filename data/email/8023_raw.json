But never forget her primary use :\n&gt; to\n&gt; kill trough cutting.   Be very respectful with her\n&gt; and\n&gt; around her.   Remember\n&gt; what you have in your hands is a Shin Ken and\n&gt; although\n&gt; it is a recent made blade I know for shore it has a\n&gt; very sharp and excellent edge.\n&gt;    Also please avoid trying tameshigiri if you do\n&gt; not\n&gt; know what you are doing, you can ruin your blade and\n&gt; even worst, get very seriously injured.\n&gt;    Finally, if you are not practicing any martial\n&gt; art\n&gt; such as Kendo or my beloved Iaido, I strongly\n&gt; encourage you to do it in order to learn more about\n&gt; your Shin ken.   Only through the right path you\n&gt; will\n&gt; enjoy it the most.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Best regards.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Federico.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Correo Yahoo!\n&gt; Espacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y\n&gt; antispam �gratis! \n&gt; Reg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
