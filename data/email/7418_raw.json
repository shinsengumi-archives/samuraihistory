When Turnbull is speaking of historical ninja, what he writes is accurate (as borne out by many Japanese texts in my collection-although as noted in my last post, these events do not stand out as being anything other than regular samurai history in said texts. Japanese historical sources both primary and secondary are notoriously lacking in any reference to ninja as such, and in fact I would find any document that does somewhat Hayes-esque and suspect). When he is speaking of legends/myths etc, those are accurate. And when he is speaking of their role in popular culture, that is correct as well (the &#39;high school website&#39; stuff-I&#39;m unsure of what the &#39;pop culture&#39; image of the ninja is in the UK, but he has nailed the USA pop culture version). The Iga Ninja museum (which Turnbull draws heavily upon) goes along with pretty much everything in the book (and is a great place to visit-along with the whacked out nearby ninja theme park).\nI do agree (as indicated by my original post) that the earlier book is much better, in large part due to a greater focus on the historical ninja.\nBest of luck with the dojo! \n\n\n\n"
