In Japanese schools they teach katakana before hiragana \n(which really struck me as odd)  and I often saw things like trash bins \n(gomi) marked in katakana. Possibly one of the dictionaries is a learners \ndictionary and katakana is default.\n\nM.J.Peters\n\n&gt;Ika is written only in hiragana. Katakana is usually reserved for\n&gt;words that did not originate in Japan or what we call borrowed words.\n&gt;\n&gt;Happy to help!\n&gt;\n&gt;Hirai\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;miles dewey&quot;\n&gt;&lt;commissionercod@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; sorry to bring up an unrelated subject, but i need to know if the\n&gt;japanese\n&gt; &gt; word Ika (squid)\n&gt; &gt; is written in katakana or hirigana, as my japanese-english\n&gt;dictionary gives\n&gt; &gt; a contradictory result to my english japanese.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; cheers\n&gt; &gt; miles r dewey\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Be the first to hear what&#39;s new at MSN - sign up to our free\n&gt;newsletters!\n&gt; &gt; http://www.msn.co.uk/newsletters\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
