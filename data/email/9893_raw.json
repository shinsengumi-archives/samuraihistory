For example, the role of the Meiji Restoration=\r\n leaders seems\n&gt; analogous to the founding fathers of the US. Toshimichi Ok=\r\nubo strikes\n&gt; me as a Thomas Jefferson type of character. Saigo Takamori re=\r\nminds me\n&gt; of George Washington.\n&gt; \n&gt; The analogies are not, of course, per=\r\nfect. But they are strong enough\n&gt; to be interesting. This evening I was co=\r\nmparing the Battle of\n&gt; Sekigahara (East vs West) with the Battle of Gettys=\r\nburg (North vs\n&gt; South). These are the two key large domestic battles in bo=\r\nth countries&#39;\n&gt; histories. I was surprised to learn how close the troop num=\r\nbers were.\n&gt; At Gettysburg, it was 93K (north) vs 71K (south). At Sekigahar=\r\na, it was\n&gt; 88K (east) vs 81K (west). How coincidental that such analogous =\r\nbattles\n&gt; had troop numbers that were so comparable!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n******=\r\n********\nAccess 350+ FREE radio stations anytime from anywhere on the \nweb.=\r\n Get the Radio Toolbar! \n(http://toolbar.aol.com/aolradio/download.html?nci=\r\nd=3Demlcntusdown00000003)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been re=\r\nmoved]\n\n\n"
