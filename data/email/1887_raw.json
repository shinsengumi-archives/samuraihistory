I am just curious.\n\n\n&gt; Hi Bud, \n&gt; \n&gt;      First off, is there any reason that you would need a sharp \n&gt; sword? Unless you are training, or will be training in a style of \n&gt; Japanese swordsmanship that performs tameshigiri(test cutting),it \n&gt; would be a big expense for no practical reason. This should be done \n&gt; by a professional sword polisher to be done properly (to preserve \nthe \n&gt; integrity and value of the blade), and that is costly.    \n&gt;      If you are or will be taking up such training, your instructor \n&gt; is who you should talk to. If he is not comfortable with his \n&gt; knowledge of assessing swords they should know someone that can \nhelp. \n&gt; Many a good blade has been ruined or destroyed by the untrained or \n&gt; the inexperienced in attempts at sharpening.  \n&gt;   Second, even if this sword is suitible for sharpening and you see \na \n&gt; need for a sharp sword, you may want to to leave it dull while you \n&gt; learn the basics of handling it properly. People have lost fingers \n&gt; just drawing a sword out improperly.\n&gt;    On mataining the sword, if it if steel, there is a good article \non \n&gt; the JSSUS (Japanese Sword Society of the US) website--here is their \n&gt; link: http://www.jssus.org/.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good Luck, and whatever you do, be safe!\n&gt; Jeff Harris\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bud Brann&quot; &lt;cebrann@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lat fall a Japanese friend visited the U.S. and gave me a samurai \n&gt; &gt; Sword as a gift.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is the proper way to take care of the Sword? Should one oil \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; blade periodically? If so, what is the best kind of oil to use? \nIs \n&gt; &gt; the anything else which should be done? What about  the scabbard? \n&gt; &gt; What maintence and care should be taken with it? Advise will be \n&gt; &gt; appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Incidentally, this is a modern sword and is sold in Japan \n&gt; &gt; unsharpened. Sholud I leave it that way? Is it possible to \nsharpen \n&gt; &gt; these swords? If so is it desirable to have it sharpened?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even though the sword is not sharpened, My friend had to get a \n&gt; police \n&gt; &gt; permit to buy one. This took several months. On the way to the \n&gt; &gt; states, three times he was required to open the box and show it \nto \n&gt; &gt; inspectors at various airports.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Even though this this is not a collectors item it is very \n&gt; beautiful \n&gt; &gt; and authentic looking and I am very proud of it. I have another \n&gt; &gt; sword, but that was is very cheap looking with lots of plastic on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; handle. (Also a gift however, so the thought was there.)\n\n\n"
