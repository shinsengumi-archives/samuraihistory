I like the show but I dont \ngo \n&gt; out of my way to make sure I watch it.  But I do remember Saito \n&gt; Hajime being a character from the series, and someone on here was \n&gt; writing about him.  Was he a real person that used to be a member \nof \n&gt; the Shinsengumi?  And about another Shinsengumi member.  Okita Soji \n&gt; who is a major character in the movie Gohatto.  I have a friend \nthat \n&gt; told me he is very popluar in Japan, and they even sell dolls of \n&gt; him.  Also she told me that he died of consumption before the \n&gt; revolution ever happened.  Can anyone confrim of correct these?\n\n\n\n"
