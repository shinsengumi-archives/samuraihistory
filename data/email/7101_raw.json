Famous Samurai swordsmen there schools and items\nbelonging or rewlating tot hem\n2. Various Koryu - sort of a intro to each school and\nwhat they do and who they are - 6 old schools have\nbeen contacted and 5 have already said yes.\n3. production of a kata from start to finish including\nthe making of the koshirae and polishing. (We have\naccess to one of the most senior polishers in Japan)\n\nIf all goes well we are hoping to then do one on\narmour production. \n\nIf these projects do get off the ground I will be\nasking members of this list whom I have noticed are\ninvolved in various subjects relating to what we are\ncurrently working on for help or advise.&quot;\n\n-In the above you say &quot;we&quot; alot, sounds like you are involved in this project and 3 or 4 future projects as well, no wonder you defend it so much.\n\nDave\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richardson Paul \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, May 09, 2005 12:10 AM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] New Ninja documentary\n\n\n  www.shinobiwinds.com\n\n  not sure how it will be distributed as I am not\n  involved in it\n\n  Paul\n\n\n  --- Michael Youngblood &lt;warrior02@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  ---------------------------------\n  Paul,\n  Speaking of witch, how can the film be viewed?

It is possible I can also\n  find someone to fund it\n\n  however until someone who knows better (maybe yourself\n  Nate) then we have to make do with a little better\n  each time. So far the only nina documentaries I have\n  seen are on things ike dicovery and I could have\n  choked at the crap they spouted.\n\n  Paul\n\n\n\n\n  --- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  ---------------------------------\n\n  --- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; HI\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I love this attitude.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I havent seen it, I know nothing about it, so I will\n  &gt; slam it as much as I can.\n\n  Since when has skepticism meant &quot;slam it as much as I\n  can&quot;? I&#39;ll slam Hayes all day--I&#39;ve, to date, made 1\n  comment about the documentary. Did you produce this?\n  You&#39;re certainly defending it like you&#39;ve got a vested\n  interest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese\n  history 101 and knows something now--but I&#39;m\n  skeptical. \n\n  If the documentary isn&#39;t built around him, than\n  lovely--hopefully it has some useful information. \n\n  &gt; My I suggest if you already think its a load of crap\n  &gt; before its been released that you go and produce\n  &gt; something better.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; i await your future project on the ninja so we can\n  &gt; all\n  &gt; insult it\n\n  If you&#39;re willing to pay me to quit my job, fund the\n  project, and pay the production costs, I&#39;d be more\n  than happy to. Of course, it&#39;d be cheaper to just\n  translate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then\n  you&#39;d take issue with my translation, I&#39;m sure. \n\n  __________________________________________________\n  Do You Yahoo!?\n  Tired of spam?  Yahoo!
