People always \nwalked to the left, much in the manner that European people drive.  If there \nwas a left-handed kenshi, his saya would be hitting everyone that he walked \nby which would, in essence, be insulting and challenging to any other kenshi \nhe happened to meet.\n  Now I am not saying that there were no kenshi that were left hand \ndominant, but they were trained to use the daito as if they were \nright-handed.  Left hand dominant kenshi would have an advantage in the use \nof the wakizashi as a secondary weapon, since it could be drawn left-handed \nif the right hand was occupied.\n  I hope that this has helped in some way.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
