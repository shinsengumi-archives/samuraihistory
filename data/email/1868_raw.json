As a member \n&gt; of several lists like this I think we learn alot about the people \nin \n&gt; the group from some of the off-topic banter. Wouldn&#39;t it be more \n&gt; constructive simply to request that posters put &#39;NSR&#39; &quot;Not Samurai \n&gt; Related&quot; in the subject line? Then we can all join in, lurk or \ndelete \n&gt; as we see fit.\n&gt; \tBTW I give anzen unten stickers to all my friends who drink \n&gt; and drive, and have omamori on all my bogu bags. I also think the \n&gt; Swiss are the most evil people on earth!\n&gt; -t\n\n\n"
