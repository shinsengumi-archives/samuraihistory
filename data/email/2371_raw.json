First of all, is every samurai sword\n&gt; has a number on the sword?\n&gt; What is the meaning of this numbers?\n&gt; The samurai my friend told me have two numbers, first 1356 and the\n&gt; second numbers is 510023 are these numbers mean something?\n&gt; The samurai I talk about was found in a cave, in north sulawesi, are\n&gt; there a specific history event take place in there? Suppose 1356 is\n&gt; the year when the samurai was forged.\n&gt; Thanks anyway for those who willing to share their knowledge.\n\nHi Edhie. I do not think the sword has been brought to Papua by a \nsamurai. Most likely, a Japanese soldier in WWII. Regarding the \nnumbers, are they Arab (=roman) numbers or Chinese numbers? I doubt \nJapanese swordsmiths used Arab numbers in the 14th century...\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
