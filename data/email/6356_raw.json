Sadler:\n\nTokugawa Nobuyasu&#39;s seppuku was overseen by Hattori Hanzo, who \nhad been despatched by Ieyasu, along with one of Ieyasu&#39;s \nretainers, Amakata Michitsuna, to see the matter through.\n\nHattori is, of course, Ieyasu&#39; famous &#39;ninja chief&#39; and \nNobuyasu requested the man to act as his kaishaku. When it came \nto it, Hattori was so emotional he could not act, and Amakatsu \nstepped forward to administer the coup de grace.\n\nIeyasu had told both men before their despatch that his son was \ninnocent and that the plot would at some time be shown to be a \nslanderous rumour.\n\nOn their return, there was not a dry eye in the house. Both men \nwere troubled by the task undertaken, and both Honda Tadakatsu \nand Sakakibara Yasumasa (2 of the shi-tenno - &#39;the 4 pillars of \nthe Tokugawa&#39;) wept aloud.\n\n&quot;And of what make was the wakizashi with which the second \nstruck off his head?&quot; asked Ieyasu. &quot;Muramasa,&quot; came the reply. \n&quot;How ominous!&quot; he remarked. &quot;It was a Muramasa blade that \nstruck down my grandfather, and when I was a child I cut myself \nwith one by accident, and now my son is killed by one. Muramasa \nblades bode ill for our house. If any of you possess one, he \nhad better get rid of it.&quot;\n\nLater Ieyasu observed &quot;Even such a devil as Hanzo does not care \nto cut off the head of his master,&quot; (which does little to \nreinforce the idea of the ninja as heartless murderers).\n\nAmakatsu, on hearing this, sensed an ominous tone in Ieyasu&#39;s \nwords and took himself off with all haste to Mount Koya, and \nlater took service with Hideyoshi.\n\n***\n\nThe lady Tsukiyama was put to death at another time and another \nplace, and another retainer, Nonaka Shigemasa, oversaw \nproceedings - so the Muramasa link to her might be apocryphal.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
