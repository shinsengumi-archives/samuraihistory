An amazing film about\nMusashi&#39;s life after his contest with Kojiro. Yorozuya as Musashi is superb\nand later I heard that he was a master of kenjutsu (6th dan).\n\nFor long time now, I&#39;m trying hard to find more infos about Yorozuya.\nHowever, it is impossible so far. It is said that Japanese &#39;hide&#39; many\nevidence because they want to keep them only for... them. I dunno if this is\ntrue. But I know that there are for sure many files which have been left\nwithout english translation...\n\nPlease, if you know more about Yorozuya, feel free to let me know.\n\nThanks for your interest on Musashi&#39;s site.\n\nSoon, I&#39;ll publish a book on Musashi based on this site.\n\nregards,\nAmphipolis\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Message: 1\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 4 Sep 2001 00:54:44 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;    From: &quot;ANDREI C.&quot; &lt;cif_arh@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Thanks...\n&gt;\n&gt;     There are no words for me to express my gratitude\n&gt; for whoever sent this mail whith the &#39;Musashi site&#39;\n&gt; link.If anyone has some more information on the man I\n&gt; sure hope won&#39;t keep it only for him/herself...Thanks again...A.\n.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n\n\n"
