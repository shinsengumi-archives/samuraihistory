That class was abolish=\r\ned in the late 19th century by the Meiji government. They could be descende=\r\nd from samurai (which is not the same thing).\nSecondly, there are no Japane=\r\nse castles that are privately owned. They all belong to the goverment (usua=\r\nlly the prefectural or city govenment where they are located). The last pri=\r\nvately owned castle (Inuyama) gave up the ghost a couple of years ago and t=\r\nurned it over to the city.\nAnyway, Kamo (or Kamou) is indeed a Japanese nam=\r\ne, but not one that has any notations in the couple of sources I checked (i=\r\nncluding Sengoku Chronik, which has histories for about 200 families and th=\r\neir retainers).\nOn the castle front, none of the castles that existed in th=\r\ne Edo period were ever under the control/stewardship of a Kamo family. This=\r\n takes it back to about the year 1600. I also checked the histories of the =\r\nhandful of extant Japanese castles that were around before 1600, and none o=\r\nf them were ever associated with a Kamo.\nIs it possible (as LT has already =\r\nalluded to) that the family name might have been pronounced Gamou? That&#39;s c=\r\nlose to Kamou, and there is a very famous castle (Aizu-Wakamatsu) that was =\r\ncontrolled by the Gamou for a few years.\nAnyway, if you could post the kanj=\r\ni used for your mother&#39;s family name (or better yet, the name of the castle=\r\n-the ones left have well documented histories) it would be helpful in findi=\r\nng out more. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
