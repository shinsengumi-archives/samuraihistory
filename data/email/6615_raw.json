I did a little more reasearch just on last night and found that there is a deference between Sochin kata and Sanchin kata. I do only Sochin as to I was only trained in Japan. Dont think that would have any thing to do with it though. Thanks for your humble enlightenment and to all others that I have not gotten around to reading yet. Next thing though where is the Dojo in which you attend?. Fayetteville is not my fav city but I do not have a formal training home here in America. Well again thanks for all replys God Bless you\n \npeace\n\nbudddogg33@... wrote:\nTo all,\n        You are probably referring to  the kata &quot;Sanchin&quot;, which is done \nprimarily by the Karate styles descending from  Naha-te. The breathing style used \nduring the performance of this kata has been  under debate for many years, \nregarding it&#39;s health related issues, and the  early passing of some of those \npractioners.\n\nBud Morgan\nKarate Yudansha\nFayetteville, NC USA\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
