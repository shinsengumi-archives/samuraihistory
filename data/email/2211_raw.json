These straw-\nhatted, musket-bearing soldiers represent the new, &quot;modern&quot; army of \nEmperor Meiji, and they&#39;re led by American Civil War veteran Capt. \nNathan Aldren. But they&#39;re about to get a lesson in good, old-\nfashioned shock and awe. \nWar cries and the sound of thundering hooves rise from the \nmist. &quot;Samurai,&quot; mutter the infantrymen, their eyes darting around in \npanic. Aldren tries to maintain fire-discipline, hoping to unleash a \nvolley just as the mounted warriors are upon them. But as the enemy \nhorsemen rush headlong into his line, his men break, scatter and run, \nand are slaughtered to a man. All except Aldren, who is taken \nprisoner. \nThis is the first glimpse the world got of the new Tom Cruise \nproject, &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; a few scenes from which were unveiled at \na press conference at Roppongi Hills last week. Shot in Japan (Himeji \nand Kyoto), New Zealand and a Warner backlot in Los Angeles, &quot;The \nLast Samurai&quot; -- which will open in December -- is a $100 million \nHollywood attempt to make a Japanese jidaigeki (period drama) with \nthe impact of &quot;Gladiator&quot; or &quot;Braveheart.&quot; Cruise and director Edward \nZwick turned up with nearly all the Japanese cast -- jidaigeki \nregulars like Ken Watanabe, Shun Sugata and the supercool Hiroyuki \nSanada, as well as kabuki actor Shichinosuke Nakamura and \nmodel/actress Koyuki -- to hype the first major Hollywood-does-Japan \nflick since 1993&#39;s &quot;Rising Sun.&quot; \nCinemagoers who remember that film -- as well as dreck like &quot;Black \nRain&quot; and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; -- know that American directors rarely \nmanage to get Japan right, with awkward mannerisms and speech \npatterns, and costumes that invariably leave Japanese audiences \nfeeling bewildered. It&#39;s easy to imagine &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; marching \noff the same cliff of cultural miscomprehension, but despite the \nstoryline&#39;s similarities to the television miniseries &quot;Shogun&quot; -- \nbearded gaijin is enlisted by enemy samurai warriors; slowly \nacclimates and falls for demure, kimono-clad beauty; then suffers \nfrom torn loyalties -- it seems the filmmakers have done everything \npossible to get their on-screen Japan right. \nDirector Zwick is a history buff and a stickler for detail, and it \nshows. Actor after actor attested to the production&#39;s deep commitment \nto research and accuracy. Ken Watanabe, who plays a rebellious \nsamurai modeled on Takamori Saigo -- who fought to the bitter end \nagainst the Meiji administration&#39;s centralization and modernization --\n admits he had doubts when he first read the script. &quot;Most of the \nstaff were American, British or New Zealanders, and there were hardly \nany Japanese except for a few advisers,&quot; he said. &quot;Right from the \nbeginning, I spoke with Sanada-san, and we agreed that we would speak \nup if there were any points that didn&#39;t feel right. But that turned \nout to be unnecessary; the filmmakers had a very deep understanding \nof the samurai.&quot; \nSanada added that there were some compromises &quot;between reality and \nentertainment, between making it authentically Japanese and \ncomprehensible to audiences overseas,&quot; but said, &quot;I&#39;m proud of the \nresults.&quot; Masato Harada noted that there&#39;s certainly nothing as wince-\ninducing as when the Emperor off-handedly says &quot;Domo!&quot; to Richard \nChamberlain in &quot;Shogun.&quot; \nCertainly, the film looks right, from its massive temples and rustic \nvillages, to floral kimono and antiquated yoroi armor. One point of \nconcern, naturally, is Cruise&#39;s attempts to deliver dialogue in \nJapanese: A brief scene with Koyuki, however, revealed language \nskills that, however basic, sound better than many foreigners who&#39;ve \nbeen here for a few years. Cruise handles the scene with an \nappropriate awkwardness, putting to shame the incomprehensible \nnihongo of Sean Connery -- playing an &quot;old Japan hand&quot; -- in &quot;Rising \nSun.&quot; \nWhen it comes to swordfighting, the staple of any chanbara flick, \nCruise is utterly convincing. &quot;I trained for eight months prior to \nshooting the film, and I put on 20 pounds [9 kg] for the movie, to be \nable to carry the swords and wear the armor,&quot; said Cruise. &quot;But it \nwas great, because as I was developing the character, my body was \nchanging and I was becoming more and more like Aldren.&quot; Sanada, who \nalong with Watanabe tutored Cruise in the finer points of swordplay, \nsaid simply: &quot;He&#39;s really tough. No matter how many hours we filmed \neach day, he&#39;d still want to do one or two hours of training \nafterward. I did give him a little advice regarding Japanese kenjutsu \n(swordfighting), but whatever I told him, he&#39;d absorb it right away. \nAnd as he got better, his stance became centered lower, and he really \nstarted to look like a samurai.&quot; \nPerhaps the greatest praise for Cruise&#39;s immersion in his role came \nfrom Sugata, who&#39;s had a decades-long career in jidaigeki as the \nkirareyaku, the &quot;guy who gets slashed.&quot; Said Sugata: &quot;I was doubtful \nthat Americans could really do swordfighting, but they had studied it \nin depth, they had seen all the Kurosawa films, so the American staff \nwere even telling Sanada and me what to do! I was really impressed by \nTom Cruise. I mean, sure, he&#39;d practiced, but I know from 40 years of \nexperience that if you just practice for a couple of months, you \ncan&#39;t do it right, but he was perfect. I could feel the passion and \ncommitment he put into this film.&quot; \nSugata went on to say that &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; would be a wake-up call \nto the Japanese film industry that had regarded chanbara as a \ndomestic specialty. &quot;Now I feel we just can&#39;t sit back and assume \nit&#39;s our specialty, because no Japanese film has done this so well.&quot; \nObviously, the film is a canny move for Cruise, who knows on which \nside his bread is buttered; the actor has a huge following in Japan --\n witness even Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi angling for a photo-op \nwith him -- and, sure enough, he&#39;ll be back in December for the \nopening to give it another push. Beyond that, the post-&quot;Crouching \nTiger&quot; (and &quot;Matrix&quot;) mini-boom in Asian action seems to still be on \nthe upswing, although it remains to be seen if fans of the fantastic, \nlooney-tunes fights of Hong Kong cinema will go for the gritty \nrealism of &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; which largely avoids computer-graphic \neffects. \nBut beyond that, Cruise -- a Scientologist who neither drinks nor \nsmokes and who has increasingly taken on physically demanding roles --\n seems genuinely fascinated by Bushido and the &quot;Hagakure,&quot; the way of \nthe warrior. \n&quot;Bushido is really the reason I wanted to make this film,&quot; said \nCruise. &quot;I strongly identify with those values of honor, loyalty and \npassion. It&#39;s a very powerful code; those are wonderful things to \naspire to in a life.&quot; \nOK, so perhaps he&#39;s laying it on a bit thick. But for an actor who \ngot by for so long on pure charm, he&#39;s certainly willed himself into \na more mature performer, with depth and gravity, in films \nlike &quot;Magnolia,&quot; &quot;Minority Report&quot; and &quot;Vanilla Sky.&quot; Here&#39;s \nhoping &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; shows him at his best. \n\n\n"
