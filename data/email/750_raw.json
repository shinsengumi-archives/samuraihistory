A new poll has been created for the \nsamuraihistory group:\n\nEveryone knows Nobunaga was a pioneer in \nthe unification of Japan - but what were \n his motives?  I&#39;ve created a little \npoll to get everyone&#39;s opinions - What \nwas Nobunaga&#39;s motivation for the \nunification battles of Japan? \n\n  o Pure self interest from the start. \n  o An honest to goodness feeling of loyalty and duty to his country. \n  o Self interest at first, which grew into a sense of duty. \n  o Started with a sense of duty to Japan, but grew into a selfish drive for power. \n  o Just happened to be good at winning and politics, and sort of &#39;fell into it&#39;. \n  o Pushed by his generals and vassals to achieve. \n  o Reveled in death and destruction - unification would only be a side effect of his bloodlust. \n  o Was part of a grand conspiracy among daimyo and the emperor as the &#39;chosen one&#39; to lead Japan. \n  o He enjoyed the thrill of battle and the thrill of political intrigue. \n  o Wanted nothing more than power over others. \n  o Fought out of loyalty to the emperor, to whom he intended to return power. \n  o Fought to unify Japan against the Europeans, whom he saw as a threat to the fractured country. \n\n\nTo vote, please visit the following web page:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/polls \n\nNote: Please do not reply to this message.
