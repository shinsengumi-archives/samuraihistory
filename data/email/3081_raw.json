I haven&#39;t really liked a Taiga drama \nsince Tokugawa Yoshinobu.  But much like William and &#39;The Last \nSamurai&#39;, I had to listen to my wife talk about how Kokkoii &quot;Mok-kun&quot; \nwas the whole time. Motoki Masahiro usually comes across as too \neffeminate in a lot of his other shows and movies (like, say, as the \ngay nightclub partyboy in &#39;Gonin&#39;, for example), but I thought he was \nreal good in Tokugawa Yoshinobu.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- William&Mikiko Letham &lt;mickey.letham@n...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; His name was Kastura Kogoro\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Domo...\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; For a synopsis of the first few episodes try here\n&gt; &gt; http://www.nhk-jn.co.jp/wp/best_e.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You might also try one of the series guides that are\n&gt; &gt; in the bookstores.\n&gt; &gt; Particularly the official NHK one (with Kondo\n&gt; &gt; Isami/Shigo-kun on the cover)\n&gt; &gt; They have pix of all the stars and the characters\n&gt; &gt; they play. Thankfully this\n&gt; &gt; one is done in hiragana, better to read.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also just bought the rekishi manga series on the\n&gt; Bakumatsu, with the Shinsengumi in it--I can&#39;t\n&gt; remember right now the name of the series, but it&#39;s\n&gt; the one I was reading here as a student suu-nen mae. I\n&gt; figure it&#39;s as good a way as any, and i might actually\n&gt; understand some of it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yes that&#39;s right. Her name is Nogiwa Yoko\n&gt; \n&gt; She&#39;s SOOOO good at playing Onibaba!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way do you have access to cable or skyperfect\n&gt; &gt; yet. The first episode\n&gt; &gt; of Nobunaga was repeated on Saturday; Onna Taiko-ki\n&gt; &gt; will be in February and\n&gt; &gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu will start in march!!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll be getting SkyPerfect at my house in Yoyogi...I\n&gt; won&#39;t move in for another week or so, but that&#39;s\n&gt; negotiated into my lease. I&#39;ve got the first episode\n&gt; of Nobunaga, King of Zipangu on tape, watched part of\n&gt; it last night--the rest I&#39;l have to catch once I&#39;m in\n&gt; the house...\n&gt; \n&gt; so does the jidai geki channel come with Sky Perfect,\n&gt; or is it something seperate I have to order??\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n\n\n"
