A question occured to me- If you could be a famous Military leader from the past who would you be?\n     I think my answer at this point would be possibly split between Ieyasu Tokugawa and Erwin Rommel.\n     My first choice, Ieyasu Tokugawa was the first Shogun of Japan; according to my research, he united Japan; I could elaborate but in fairness this could be a seperate e-mail.\n     My second choice, Erwin Rommel, known as the Desert Fox, again according to my research, was one of Hitler&#39;s smartest generals.\n       There you have my answer to the question, what&#39;s your answer?  \n        I&#39;d be glad to answer any questions or hear any comments.\n         I closing, I just though it might be interesting or fun to see what answers turned up.\n        Hope to hear from you soon,\n            Shadow \n\n\n\n"
