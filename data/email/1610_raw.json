New to group. I have aquired an outstanding Japanese longsword.\n(I have a small collection) The tsuba is very nicely detailed and the \nblade itself has a very distinctive &quot;damascus&quot; pattern.The scabard is \nin very good shape physically but unfortunatly has been re-finished \nwith a modern &quot;antique&quot; finish. My problem is that there are 4 \ncharacters on the right side of the tang and 6 char. on the left side \n& I have not been able to translate them. Can anyone tell me where I \ncan go to get help? I am trying to get a good shot of them on my \nlaser scanner or get a &quot;rubbing&quot; of them to send out. If you think \nyou can help let me know and I will get a pic out soon as I can.\nAre there any sites that might help?----Thanks----ronin121293     \n\n\n"
