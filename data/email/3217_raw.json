Do you know who came up\n&gt; &gt; this? I couldn&#39;t find it on the site. Interesting\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; the ~no suke and ~ no kami titles seemed to rank\n&gt; below\n&gt; &gt; Taisho and so forth. Maybe I&#39;m just thinking in\n&gt; terms\n&gt; &gt; of landed titles (which by that point they were\n&gt; not)\n&gt; &gt; but it seemed to me that you would have to be a\n&gt; taisho\n&gt; &gt; before you could gain enough prestige before you\n&gt; got a\n&gt; &gt; title like that. \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s because dajï¿½-daijin was a code position.\n&gt; Kanpaku wasn&#39;t. It was created \n&gt; ad hoc outside the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool.
