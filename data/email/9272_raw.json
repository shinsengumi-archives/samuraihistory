NEED INTERVIEW. VERY \nIMPORTANT!!!!! NEED TO BE ANSWERED IMMEDIA\n\n\n&gt; Meltroniks, this is so unbelievably full of nothing\n&gt; but stereotypical crap I&#39;m not even sure where to\n&gt; begin, so I&#39;ll begin by pointing you to the top 11\n&gt; misconceptions regarding the Samurai:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; Go there, read it all, and do so before posting again.\n&gt; Now, I&#39;ll get to the content of your post, edited in\n&gt; text below.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- meltroniks &lt;meltroniks@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; It is my understanding that the samurai lived a very\n&gt;&gt; strict and\n&gt;&gt; ritualistic lifestyle.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some did, some didn&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; They were under the service\n&gt;&gt; of and dedicated\n&gt;&gt; fully to a daimyo or lord.\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;ve been watching too many anime or movies.\n&gt;\n&gt; most Were paid in rice,\n&gt;&gt; which was farmed by\n&gt;&gt; the underclass which were not allowed to wear the\n&gt;&gt; swords.\n&gt;\n&gt; Post-sword hunt, that&#39;s correct. Before the 1590&#39;s,\n&gt; that would be a complete fallacy. Even during the Edo\n&gt; period, commoners were allowed to carry personal\n&gt; protection weapons, to include short swords.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any samurai\n&gt;&gt; who wished to test out his new shinken or (real\n&gt;&gt; sword),for a price\n&gt;&gt; could cut down a criminal who had been caught as\n&gt;&gt; Japan had no prisons.\n&gt;\n&gt; Japan most definitely had prisons. Not sure where the\n&gt; hell you came up with that one.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Death was the customary punishment for every\n&gt;&gt; offense. Sometimes\n&gt;&gt; samurai would cut down innocent people to test their\n&gt;&gt; steel if no one\n&gt;&gt; was looking but this was most likely not the norm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Me? No, I didn&#39;t cut that guy down...you didn&#39;t see\n&gt; me, did you? Nope, wasn&#39;t me...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Samurai means to\n&gt;&gt; serve and a samurai was also called bushi being the\n&gt;&gt; plural or bujin\n&gt;&gt; for one of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;bushi&quot; isn&#39;t the plural of &quot;bujin&quot;. Japanese has no\n&gt; plural or singular--the plural of &quot;bushi&quot; is &quot;bushi&quot;,\n&gt; the singular of &quot;bushi&quot; is &quot;bushi. Plural or singular\n&gt; is determined by context or counters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Guns were introduced by the\n&gt;&gt; first europeans\n&gt;&gt; but not given or sold to them one man made a sketch\n&gt;&gt; of one of the guns\n&gt;&gt; and within 6 months there were guns aplenty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow, this is so wrong it&#39;s not even funny. There&#39;s no\n&gt; possible way that someone who&#39;d never seen one before\n&gt; could make a sketch of an arquebus and then create\n&gt; one. The swordmaker of the lord of Tanegashima island,\n&gt; where the first Portuguese landed and demonstrated\n&gt; firearms, aquired several arquebuses, and was able to\n&gt; do everything except figure out how to seal the\n&gt; barrel. For the secret to this, he traded his daughter\n&gt; to a Portuguese merchant.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The\n&gt;&gt; samurai adopted their\n&gt;&gt; use for a short time until they were considered\n&gt;&gt; dishonorable and the\n&gt;&gt; samurai abandoned there use willingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; God, no. No, no, no, no, and no. &quot;Dishonorable&quot; had\n&gt; nothing to do with anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; The use of a\n&gt;&gt; jo or staff was\n&gt;&gt; the weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and\n&gt;&gt; the main weapon of\n&gt;&gt; the lower class to defend against the samurai.\n&gt;\n&gt; Um, no.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then\n&gt;&gt; there were the\n&gt;&gt; Ninja.\n&gt;\n&gt; Stop. I can&#39;t even begin to read the idiocy you write\n&gt; here. Go to the link I posted, go read the section on\n&gt; ninja. You&#39;ve managed to post every single myth and\n&gt; Hollywood fantasy possible here, congrats.\n&gt;\n&gt; They employed many\n&gt;&gt; dishonorable tactics and\n&gt;&gt; devices including throwing venomous snakes on their\n&gt;&gt; foes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm...that&#39;s a new one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai\n&gt;&gt; would stand and state their name and such before\n&gt;&gt; fighting in duels\n&gt;&gt; which usually lasted 30 seconds or less.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, Samurai stated their names and lineage prior to\n&gt; battle...a practice that died out before 1300, because\n&gt; it was completely impractical. This ended essentially\n&gt; during the Mongol invasions, since those nasty Mongols\n&gt; didn&#39;t play nice and simply shot the brave Samurai in\n&gt; the middle of his introduction speech.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ninja did\n&gt;&gt; not and snuk around\n&gt;&gt; and disguised themselves and such. Ninja were more\n&gt;&gt; effective in combat\n&gt;&gt; than most samurai though and usually acted alone.\n&gt;&gt; Slaying a sleeping\n&gt;&gt; army and other similar antics.\n&gt;\n&gt; Slaying a sleeping army? At once? Wow, those ninjers\n&gt; are Kool.\n&gt;\n&gt; Honor meant\n&gt;&gt; everything to the samurai\n&gt;&gt; and they would not hesitate to commit hara kiri done\n&gt;&gt; with the\n&gt;&gt; wakizashi one would stick the blade into his gut\n&gt;&gt; with the goal of\n&gt;&gt; cutting the spine from the front then another would\n&gt;&gt; end his suffering\n&gt;&gt; with a beheading. Someone the former had chosen to\n&gt;&gt; assist him in\n&gt;&gt; restoring his honor.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yup, I saw in a comic book that some samurai called\n&gt; his friend by the wrong name, so to atone he cut his\n&gt; own stomach right then and there, without even\n&gt; thinking about it. Those samurai were always\n&gt; committing suicide...\n&gt;\n&gt; No. And....no.\n&gt;\n&gt; A samurai could probably take\n&gt;&gt; down a charging\n&gt;&gt; bull but I would not expect the could have tussled\n&gt;&gt; succesfully with a\n&gt;&gt; grizzly bear.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, many samurai were successful economically,\n&gt; in both the prosperous and lean times...\n&gt;\n&gt; ...or did you really mean to give your opinion vis a\n&gt; vis various animals? \n&gt; &#12414;&#12387;&#12383;&#12367;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
