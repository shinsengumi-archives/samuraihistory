Yes, I would absolutely subscribe to such a journal.\n&gt;=\r\n Whether or not I am qualified to write an article for such a\njournal, that=\r\n\n&gt; is an entirely different question. Like Nina, and perhaps many\nothers on=\r\n the\n&gt; list, I am just an enthusiast of Japanese history, not an expert. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; One other question: have you considered how and S-A quarterly mi=\r\nght be\n&gt; similar or different from Monumenta Nipponica or the Journal of Ja=\r\npanese\n&gt; Studies? Have you given any thought to what niche S-A quarterly\nmi=\r\nght occupy\n&gt; to differentiate itself from those journals?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; In an=\r\ny case, kudos to you for the idea. \n\n\n\nGood points and good questions.  Fir=\r\nst off - (and I need to make this\nclear) - &quot;Academic Journals&quot; essentially =\r\n*will not* publish you, no\nmatter the level of your scholarship, unless you=\r\n have some academic\ncredentials to back up your name. Which I think you kno=\r\nw means that\nneither I, nor F.Seal, nor anyone else associated with the sam=\r\nurai\narchives could ever hope to get published.  I&#39;m subversively\nundercutt=\r\ning that bias by allowing anyone with the theories, ideas,\nand ability to m=\r\nake for a well written, academically sound, and\ninteresting research to be =\r\npublished. So above all else, I want it\nunderstood that I really don&#39;t care=\r\n if someone lacks (or has) a PhD or\nMA after thier name if they can put tog=\r\nether a good paper. The best I\ncan personally do is put &quot;MBA&quot; after my name=\r\n, and that surely doesn&#39;t\nqualify *me* as a historian.  This would be a jou=\r\nrnal of independent\nscholarship, and that&#39;s my intention.  I do know a coup=\r\nle people\nactually qualified in the academic sense who have shown interest,=\r\n but\nthat most definately *doesn&#39;t* exclude anyone who doesn&#39;t.\n\nAs for &quot;ho=\r\nw does this stand apart&quot;? - my aim is to focus more on the\nmilitary history=\r\n, and the personalities of Japanese history, rather\nthan social issues, &quot;in=\r\ntellectual history&quot;, and how (for example)\nDaimyo administered thier lands,=\r\n and all of the other stuff that is\nthe vogue of the academic journals. I w=\r\nant to publish the stuff that\npeople want to read, not the stuff that you a=\r\nre forced to write if you\nwant to get into an academic journal.  I have the=\r\n business background,\nso I&#39;m already in the process of building the busines=\r\ns foundation. \nAll that will be left are the articles themselves.\n\nI am giv=\r\ning myself 4 months to organize the business side, as well as\norganize the =\r\npotential editors and the &quot;checklist&quot;, if you will, of\nthe formats, expecta=\r\ntions, and requirements, and my goal is to have\nthe articles ready to go in=\r\n a minimum of 6 months from now.  I already\nknow how to go about publishing=\r\n and distributing, so that monster is\nalready in it&#39;s cage. I&#39;ll probably c=\r\nreate a seperate group or forum\nfor people interested in discussing the req=\r\nuirements of publication\n(how to format it correctly, what sources are and =\r\nare not acceptable,\netc.), so if/when I do that, I&#39;ll let you know, but any=\r\none interested\nin helping out in any capacity, let me know. I&#39;m going to ne=\r\ned a basic\nsupport structure (editors, fact checkers, grammar nazis) on the=\r\n one\nhand, and writers on the other.  I have no doubts this can work, and I=\r\n\nalready know the costs involved, the main thing again will be &quot;you&quot;,\nthe w=\r\nriters and researchers.\n\nSo, again, don&#39;t let something so small as a few l=\r\netters after your\nname dissuade you - Einstein didn&#39;t have a PhD when he ca=\r\nme up with\nthe theory of relativity. \n\n\n"
