That and I can&#39;t see the episodes &lt;grrr....&gt;, and i dont know \nhow much of the jidai geki is historical and how much is fictional \ndrama (for example, I never knew the leader of the Choshu shishi was \nfriends with the leader of the shinsen gumi...). Feel free to ask me \nany question, though, of course.\n\nIf I may ask, how come you can use the email service and not the \nboard. \n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; No, it was Katsura...William answered it for me, and\n&gt; gave me some sources to read, but if you care to share\n&gt; your knowledge, of course it would be greatly\n&gt; appreciated. For the moment i don&#39;t have access to the\n&gt; discussion board, just the email.

I liked\n&gt; &gt; it,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but unlike when I watch Hideyoshi or Nobunaga or\n&gt; &gt; Aoi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sandai, for example, I&#39;m not all that familiar\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the story. Any recommendations (in English, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible...I&#39;ve got my fill translating military\n&gt; &gt; &gt; documents for the moment) of books to check out\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can give me a roadmap here? I&#39;m vaguely familiar\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sakamoto Ryoma from history class, but was a\n&gt; &gt; little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confused with Kondo Isami and the guy he was\n&gt; &gt; chasing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the beginning of the show, but apparently was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; friends with 10 years before (when they flashed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back--William Letham, I know you watched it last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; night, help with his name??). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the assitance--I was surprised a little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with Katori Shingo&#39;s performance (good, so far)\n&gt; &gt; and of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course as it has Sawaguchi Yasuko in it, I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another question for William--is the woman playing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kondo Isami&#39;s mother the same woman who was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mitsuhide&#39;s mother in &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;?? Sokkuri but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t catch the name. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of Hideyoshi, Kitsuno, I see you&#39;ve got\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ishikawa Goemon as the Samurai of the Month on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; website--I just watched the episode where he gets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; boiled in oil...a little different than the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; description you&#39;ve got, eh?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks all!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mata!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
