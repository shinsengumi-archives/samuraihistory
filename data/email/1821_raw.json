Much of his deeds was in part, responsible for the greatness of the\n&gt;Japan of nowaddays.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tokugawa was responsible for the end of the several wars inside Japan and\n&gt;the unification of it. \n&gt;\nNot the Tokugawa we had anything to do with, Ieyasu died LONG before the \nUSA was a gleam in anybodies eyes. Most of it was still filled with \nNative Americans! Yoshinobu inherited a corrupt and doddering system \nthat sooner or later would have had another civil war, which it did. I \nwould argue in many ways that Japan wasn&#39;t really a nation until the \nMeiji restoration. Also one of the reasons we forced Japan to negotiate \nwith us was to insure fair treatment of our castaways. Japan enslaved or \nkilled them. Will Adams was one such in an earlier period and the people \nhe was with were badly mistreated.\n\n&gt;Ieyassu Tokugawa is a name to be listed between the great historic statesmen\n&gt;leaders just like Julius Caesar Augustus, Alexander The Great and others.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, but I&#39;m sure there are dead clans and monasterys that would curse \nhis name. He killed a lot of people, as did his two predecessors.\n\n&gt;And the Tokugawa procedures against christianism&#39;s infiltration and\n&gt;political conspiracy avoided the several atrocities that happened against\n&gt;the other religions that christianism promoted in other countries just like\n&gt;Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Spain and others, just to name a few cases.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI have no disagreement with that. Christianity is a plague of some kind \nin that period, the Spanish had used that conversion trick many times \nbefore.\n\n&gt;To be anti-tokugawa is to be against the samurai spirit and culture.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIeyasu was an incredibly pragmatic warlord of the Sengoku jidai who rose \nto the top by commiting treachery against his master. The things you \nthink of  &#39;samurai spirit&#39; and all of that are an Edo jidai construct of \na government that wished to stop the endless revolts against the current \nshoguns. Unless betrayal and murder are the spirit your talking about.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
