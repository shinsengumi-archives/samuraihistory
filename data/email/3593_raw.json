Among \nother things, they were able to rattle off all of Oda Nobunagas aunts, uncles, \nbrothers, and sisters, and knew who was adopted by who and knew both the titles \nand adopted names of pretty much anyone you could think of.  They had them up \nagainst random people on the street, then college-level history students and \neventually up against a professor of Sengoku history at Shizuoka university.  They \nknew the sengoku inside out, but lost to the professor by one question - one of \nthe only questions I actually knew the answer to...!  The question was:  What was \nthe original full name of the warrior who lead the battle against Mori Motonari at \nthe battle of Itsukushima? (Sue Takafusa).  Although the two kids stumped the \nprofessor after the little competition with the following question:\n\n&quot;What was the biggest event of 1601?&quot;\n\nThink about it, then check the answer below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;The first aniversary of the battle of Sekigahara&quot;!\n\nClassic stuff.  ;)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
