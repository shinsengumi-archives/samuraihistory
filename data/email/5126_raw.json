I figured with 900+ people on the list, at least ONE person \nmight come up with something.  It makes sense that Soun just went in \non his own, that was what I suspected.  That leads into the second \npart of my question - I have seen it said that Chachamaru assasinated \nhis father, and also that his father just &#39;died&#39;.  Anyone know what \nthe common theory is?\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \tA very free translation BTW, but it is clear Wakamori at \nleast saw it \n&gt; as pure ambition on Soun&#39;s part and the campaign to punish \nChachamaru \n&gt; was a thin veil adopted to give legitimacy to his move...\n&gt; -t\n\n\n"
