Set in 1630 near the beginning of the famous \nshoguna=\r\nte&#39;s rule, Harakiri (Seppuku) exposes Tom Cruise&#39;s vain \nattempt at multicu=\r\nlturalism, The Last Samurai, for what it is=97a \nmindless narrative based o=\r\nn inane American notions of the samurai. \nKobayashi&#39;s film is a subtle, ast=\r\nute tale full of outrage and \nprofundity.\n\nAs the film opens, momentous cha=\r\nnge is sweeping across Japan, \ncausing many samurai to fall into exile as r=\r\nonin, masterless \nsamurai. Despite the changes, the Iyi Clan is prosperous =\r\nand adheres \nstrictly to their oaths. Thus, when a man claiming to be a ret=\r\nainer \nof the fallen Fukushima Clan arrives, they question his motives. \nHa=\r\nnshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) asks permission to commit \nharakiri, ritua=\r\nl suicide, in the Iyi Clan&#39;s forecourt. The \ncounselor, Kageyu Saito (Renta=\r\nro Mikuni), is skeptical because many \nronin have been attempting to extort=\r\n money from various clans by \nplaying to their sympathies under the guise o=\r\nf this sacred ritual. \nSaito meets with Tsugumo in private, speaking frankl=\r\ny in the ascetic \nenvironment, telling the story of a young man, Motome Chi=\r\njiiwa \n(Akira Ishihama), who made the same proposition. Through a series of=\r\n \nvivid flashbacks, Chijiiwa&#39;s fate at the austere hands of the Iyi \nClan i=\r\ns revealed. Exposed as a scoundrel, they force him to commit \nharakiri with=\r\n his bamboo sword.\n\nThe story does not phase Tsugumo, however, who confiden=\r\ntly informs \nSaito that he has every intention of slicing his own abdomen. =\r\nThe \nceremony is prepared, but Tsugumo makes a request for the great Iyi \ns=\r\nwordsmen Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsuro Tamba) to assist in the ritual. \nOmodaka=\r\n is absent due to illness, so Tsugumo makes two additional \nrequests for sa=\r\nmurai who are also absent. Each of the three \nrequested men was intricately=\r\n involved in Chijiiwa&#39;s excruciating \ndeath, prompting Saito to suspect Tsu=\r\ngumo of a conspiracy. As they \nwait for news on the three missing samurai, =\r\nTsugumo tells the story \nof his life and reveals his relationship to Chijii=\r\nwa. There is no \ntelling how things will play out, but Saito and Tsugumo fi=\r\nnd \nthemselves locked in a battle of wills that could very soon turn \ninto =\r\na deadly duel.\n\nKobayashi&#39;s direction is patient in its storytelling. Worki=\r\nng from a \nscript by Shinobu Hashimoto (most famous for Rashomon), Kobayash=\r\ni \nshifts focus between the Iyi courtyard and Tsugumo&#39;s story with \ngreat s=\r\nkill, allowing the flashbacks to slowly reveal all the events \nthat led up =\r\nto Tsugumo&#39;s arrival. Watching the events unfold, I \nfound myself mesmerize=\r\nd by how little actually happens. In many \nways, Harakiri is the antithesis=\r\n to Kurosawa&#39;s brilliant samurai \npictures. Apart from the violent and unbr=\r\nidled demise of Chijiiwa \n(shown in unblinking horror, with canted camera a=\r\nngles heightening \nthe effect) the movie is mostly calm and little more tha=\r\nn two men \nconversing in front of a large audience. Yet, there&#39;s a kind of =\r\n\nspectacle in all of this. The richly adventurous black-and-white \ncinemato=\r\ngraphy by Yoshio Miyajima merges both serenity and chaos, \ncapturing the al=\r\nluring production design with tremendous realism. \nFurthering that sense is=\r\n the musical score, bringing emotion and \ndrama into perfect harmony. The f=\r\nilmmaking is so good that I \ngenuinely felt like I was sitting in feudal Ja=\r\npan while watching it.\n\nThere are flaws, however, in the storytelling. At 1=\r\n33 minutes, \nKobayashi could employ some judicious editing to strengthen th=\r\ne \nfilm&#39;s effect. There are moments when the courtyard scenes lag, \ntaking =\r\nthe audience out of Tsugumo&#39;s drama. However, the extended \nlength is made =\r\ndurable by Tatsuya Nakadai&#39;s incredible performance \nas Tsugumo. Only 30 ye=\r\nars old when making the film, Nakadai embodies \nhis character with zeal and=\r\n intelligence. The ragged beard and \ntethered clothes further his performan=\r\nce, which contains a range \nunusual in Japanese films of the period. The di=\r\nalogue is poetic, \nemploying a kabuki aesthetic and mixing it with method a=\r\ncting. Pay \nspecial attention to the early scenes when Nakadai is listening=\r\n to \nhis fellow actor, Rentaro Mikuni. The two create a tension that \nseeps=\r\n off of the screen and into the viewer.\n\nHarakiri is a classic piece of cin=\r\nema. The themes of the film, which \nare antiauthoritarian, are timeless and=\r\n raise many questions. What \nis honor? Who decides whether an act is honora=\r\nble? What is the price \nof humanity? Kobayashi weaves these questions into =\r\na stunning story \nthat can only be appreciated by viewing it.\n\nRating for S=\r\ntyle: A-\nRating for Substance: A\n\nhttp://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showrevi=\r\new.php3?ID=3D7738\n\n\n\n"
