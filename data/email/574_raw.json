Its the kind of book that\n&gt; absorbs you into the world it is set in. It is truly\n&gt; amazing how much detail was in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Clavell got the samurai&#39;s way of life perfect. The\n&gt; only complaint I have, is that I wish he wrote the\n&gt; last battle in first person perspective. There was\n&gt; such a build up to it. It doesn&#39;t spoil the book\n&gt; though, not even close.\n&gt;\n&gt; I get shivers up my spine every time I read it.\n\nI&#39;m torn by it.\n\nPart of me loves it and I owe it a great debt. When I was in college in the\nlate 70s I read it, and it is what inspired me to go off and major in\nJapanese history and go to Japan and yada yada yada. After decades of\nstudying Japan and writing about it, though, I can no longer read it as the\nmistakes and &quot;that never could have happened that way&quot; events in the book\njust don&#39;t work for me any more. I used to read it once a year or so. I\nhaven&#39;t read it for ten years now.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
