Plz Explain... Was: Tokugawa Evil? \n&gt;\n&gt;I just so happen to live in Sweden, the southern part of Sweden. History\n&gt;is my favourite hobby, and I really cant recall any autrocities done by\n&gt;the catholic curch to us. \n&gt;\nPlease explain what Gustav Adolphus was doing in the 30 years war then, \nwhat if he lost big time and Sweden was occupied ;)\n\n&gt;Nope, we are friendly, peacefull people in Sweden, and as such we have\n&gt;been treated nicely by the Father.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI forgot the nickname for Gustav, &quot;Lion of the North&quot;? God protect us \nfrom Vikings and Irish (old English prayer) It would be hard to point to \na culture on earth that didn&#39;t have wars. May be I should us the term \ncivilization (city folk) since there were a few hunter gatherer tribes \nthat weren&#39;t very warlike.\n\n&gt;Well thats what I remember from my history lessons in my 12 year carer\n&gt;of grammar school, junior high and highschool. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nTime to crack the books again ;) I know from personal experience that \nNONE of the juicy bits of history are taught in most grade schools.\n\nTo keep this on topic, I would contrast and compare the armies of the 30 \nyears war with the Sengoku period armies. I would consider Japan to be a \ndecent military power until Gustavus introduced fast and mobile \nartillery after which Europe keeps developing its military and Japan \nlies stagnant.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
