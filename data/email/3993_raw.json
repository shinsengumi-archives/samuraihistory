Guess what people--there\n&gt; were dishonorable samurai, there were dishonorable\n&gt; knights...there are honorable people today. Get over\n&gt; yourselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, Brandon, I haven&#39;t forgotten our outing--things\n&gt; have been kind of crazy here, hope you&#39;ll forgive me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \nIsn&#39;t it amazing how some tend to polorize groups of people.  Germans \nof WWII weren&#39;t all Nazis.  Japanese of the same period weren&#39;t all \nmonsters.  The thing I appreciate about eastern philosphy is that \nthey embrace the duality in nature.  Even an individual can be both \ngood and bad.  There is good and bad in every culture, country, \ncity...  I just hope that there is more good than bad in the world.\n\nBTW, Nate--I did venture out to the palace and took aboout 50 \npictures of Kusunoki.  My wife surprised me and planned the whole \nthing.  We can still do something else tho.  I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s \nmore to show me in downtown Tokyo.\n\nBrandon\n\n\n"
