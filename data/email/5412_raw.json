On the commentary done by the director, he remarks that almost \nall of the legends connected with ninja are untrue and that they were \nactually quite ordinary and unobtrusive looking. No news there, but \nthe best part is when he goes on to tell of wannabe Ninjas wanting to \nbe involved with his production (like the self proclaimed Ninja Sword \nMaster whose ultimate goal was to make himself capable of \ndisappearing-hopefully the director helped him with that-and a card \ncarrying supposed 18th generation Iga Clan Ninja). \n\n\n"
