Everyone knows that the purpose of the ninja \nis to flip \n&gt; out and kill people.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n\n\nAcutely, Ninjutsu is a form of martial arts, which incorporate a lot \nof street fighting techniques, to be blunt dirty tactics. We are \ntaught that on the street anything can happen example, one person in \na park could confront you when all of a sudden three of his friends \nappear from behind. Anyway we have this technique called the win-win \nsituation, deal with one with quick blows then move on. Aiming to \nattack soft parts of the body (the groin, throat, arm pits. etc) \ndon&#39;t get me wrong that not all we are taught but is a significant \npart of the art.  \nNow to deal with this Ninja day, Have never heard of it, checked out \nthe website and from what I can gather seems like a lot of rubbish to \nme. Will talk to my senses though and see if he knows anything about \nit. Thing is though, there was a large workshop on Sunday the 4th \nhear in Australia and no one mentioned anything about it\n\nZev\n\n\n\n\n\n"
