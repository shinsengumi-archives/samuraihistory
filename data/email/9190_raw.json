Secondly: I&#39;m not=\r\n one of the \n  experts of this list, so don&#39;t take anything I write here to=\r\no serious, \n  those things are just assumptions.\n  What about the game of &#39;=\r\ngo&#39;? I think it is of Chinese originese, does it \n  in some way fit togethe=\r\nr with &#39;shogi&#39;?\n  Just a thought, but I&#39;d be grateful for a good answer, to=\r\no.\n\n  Cheers\n  Thomas\n\n  Tom wrote:\n  &gt;&gt; Since Japan&#39;s samurai class was a =\r\nsocial class with many different \n  &gt;&gt; levels, entertainment varied but ass=\r\nociating poetry or writing with being a sissy is a silly modern American th=\r\nought. Lord Byron has a \n  &gt;&gt; statue in Greece erected to him not because h=\r\ne was a great poet but because he helped liberate Greece from the Turks. Mu=\r\nsashi wrote books and was an excellent painter. Etc. Etc.\n  &gt;&gt;\n  &gt;&gt; Jim Eck=\r\nman\n  &gt;\n  &gt; First, I don&#39;t remember saying it was sissy. I said it contrast=\r\ned. \n  &gt; Second, I don&#39;t recall Julius Ceasar&#39;s &quot;Ode to a Summer Morning&quot; o=\r\nr \n  &gt; Richard the Lionheart&#39;s &quot;Study of Roses.&quot; The point I&#39;m making, it s=\r\nhows duality but not all warrior cultures highly prize artistic expression,=\r\n especially among the warriors. Lastly, samurais were warriors. Japan, of t=\r\nhis time, was under a feudal system. In a feudal society, warriors always m=\r\naintain the highest rung in society. With that said, I asked what was their=\r\n choice of entertainment. Within that, I mentioned training and the playing=\r\n of shogi. Those can&#39;t be the only examples of war like entertainment. \n  &gt;=\r\n Unlike Rome, the samurai, in particualr before the edo period, \n  &gt; prepar=\r\ned for war constantly and were measured more by prowess in \n  &gt; combat. Yet=\r\n, they didn&#39;t relish in bloodshed as much as their Roman counterparts. Ther=\r\ne has to be some other examples. Drinking, womanizing, and gambling: I don&#39;=\r\nt view these as war like entertainment because all males participate. I&#39;m s=\r\nure wealth merchants endulged as much if not more then the samurai.\n\n\n\n  __=\r\n________________________________________________________ \n  Der fr=FChe Vog=\r\nel f=E4ngt den Wurm.
