Huh? \n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds like you needed to use the remote, to change\n&gt; the channel. \n\n\nI heard of some kind of mind control technics that was imploded by \nNinja&#39;s.  Weather it is true or not I don&#39;t know. In all my years of \nmartial arts experience I have never seen or been trained in these \ntechnics. I believe there are a few books out at the moment on the \ntopic. If I&#39;m not mistaken this remote reading sound very similar to \nthe remote viewing technics used by physic&#39;s during the cold war. But \nonce again I don&#39;t even know if that was true or just fiction.  \n\n\n\n"
