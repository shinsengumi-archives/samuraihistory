I&#39;ve been told by some Japanese people that \nthere shouldn&#39;t be any military in Japan.  Not U.S. or Japanese.  The \nI wonder, so what will happen if you don&#39;t have a military?  Someone \nwith a military (probably North Korea) would love to help them \nremember history.  Where small countries get trampled because they do \nnot have adequate means to deter a war (or better stated -a \nslaughter).  Even a simple look south, at Okinawa could show them \nthat.  It had been conquered so many times that you can find \nreminants of virtually every asian dynasty on the island.  Even the \nlanguage changed, the native dialect (hogan) has many borrowed words \nfrom those cultures.  \n\nAnother question:  Why would someone who hates war be interested in a \ngroup discussion about samurai?  Samurai-the military class.  Having \none of the strongest military histories in the world.  Fighting many \nmore wars than the average society (albiet, mostly against \nthemselves).  While the rest of us are not &quot;Warmongers&quot;, I think we \nhave an appreciation for the historical importance of war.\n\nBrandon\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kyle Segall&quot; &lt;\nklancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yeah. God forbid those dishonorable allied troops stopped nazi \n&gt; germany from exterminating six million Jewish people. Jeeze. Why \ndid \n&gt; they have to go and do that? I sure know the life of me and my \n&gt; family would be so much better if they hadn&#39;t done those \n&gt; dishonorable things.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes, I&#39;m being snappy this time, and I won&#39;t applogize. If you \n&gt; think war is all evil and dishonor... you&#39;re an idiot.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kentguy212002&quot; \n&gt; &lt;kentguy212002@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; loyalty and honour are two different things.
