Most of the news groups and \nweb-based discussion boards that discuss &quot;Japan&quot; are hopeless. \nThey basically seem to be structured flame wars. The few fj. \nnewsgroups that deal with history tend to focus on discussions of more \nrecent history. So I&#39;m really happy to have stumbled upon this mailing\n list. I actually found it by visiting the home page of samurai-archiv\nes.com - which I normally don&#39;t do, because I usually hit particular p\nages via web searches.\n\nI am an amateur student of Japanese history. That is to say I don&#39;t \nhave any particular expertise or academic qualifications on the \nsubject - and it also means I have a day job. :)\n\nMy interest within Japanese history are pretty wide. I&#39;ve been \ninterested in the late-Bakufu/Meiji Restoration period and the Heian \nPeriod. Mostly political and military history. These days my focus \nis on the Sengoku Jidai. Particularly I&#39;ve become fascinated with Oda \nNobunaga.\n\nI look forward to asking lots of questions on the forum. Maybe \nonce in a while I&#39;ll be able to answer one, too.\n\nThanks and \u001b$B$h$m$7$/$*4j$$$7$^$9!#\u001b(B\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n"
