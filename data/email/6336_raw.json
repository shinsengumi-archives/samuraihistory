I don&#39;t know much yet about\n&gt; identifying armor, so I cannot tell what was wrong\n&gt; about the armor in TLS. \n\nDon&#39;t you just hate typing out long replies, and then\nlosing it all because your net goes down? Arrgh.\n\nIt&#39;s tricky because of the time of the movie. Yoroi\nweren&#39;t in common use once the samurai stopped being\nmounted archers and became mounted spearmen--the Yoroi\nwas designed all wrong for that. In the Sengoku, you\ndon&#39;t see too many yoroi--most of those you do see\nwere worn by upper ranking general types who didn&#39;t\nactually expect to be in the thick of things. It was\nkind of a &quot;see how rich I am, that I can afford an\nantique like this in pristine condition? And I have a\nfull bodyguard to keep me from having to rely on\nit...&quot; deal. \n\nAfter warfare stopped for the most part in the Edo\nperiod, armor became more for presentation and\ndisplay. &quot;Arms and Armour of the Samurai&quot; by Bottomley\nand Hopson does a great job of explaining why Edo\nperiod pieces are mainly presentation and highly\nimpractical. Some of this presentation stuff went into\nyoroi becoming popular again, among many other things.\nTokugawa Yoshimune was known to wear a yoroi at times,\nwhen out on &quot;maneuvers&quot;. \n\nTherefore, the armor in TLS could conceivably have\nbeen a reflection (as I think someone else points out\nin another response) of the eclectic array of display\narmor created over the last 200 years. Is it well-made\nSengoku armor? No. Should we expect it to be? Not\nreally. \n\n  And \n&gt; remember, that production had it&#39;s own technical\n&gt; advisor, and none of us know what went on between\n&gt; that/those person/s and the \n&gt; director.\n\nProbably a lot of\n\n&quot;But that&#39;s not right!&quot;\n\n&quot;Shutup, I&#39;m the director, and that&#39;s what Americans\nwant to see&quot;\n\n&quot;okay&quot;\n\n\n&gt; Anyway, time to move on.....    I have to go study\n&gt; medieval history by watching &#39;Return of the\n&gt; King&#39;.....\n\nWell, I always thought that trolls were a metaphor for\nthe French. \n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
