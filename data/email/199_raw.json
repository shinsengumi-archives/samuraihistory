Kenshin is a devoter of \nthe Hindu God Vishnu, whom he titled &quot;War God of the North&quot;.\n\n&gt;IMHO Uesugi Kenshin was not a man to weep for a fallen foe, it is said he\n&gt;remarked on the loss of Shingen as regrettable. He was more likely to sit \n&gt;up\n&gt;all night before a blazing fire chanting in prayer...\n&gt;\n&gt;     Tom\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n&gt;---\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
