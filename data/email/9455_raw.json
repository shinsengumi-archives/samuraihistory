I am considering\n(seriously  considering) publishing a quarterly Japanese history\njournal. The main  issue to address, aside from wondering if anyone\nwould even want to buy it,  is, I would need to gather enough articles\nto constitute a bi-yearly or  quarterly journal. So these are the\ninitial questions:\n\n1. If the S-A  published a history journal (actual paperback high\nquality books), with 4-6  articles, probably totalling 80-120 pages,\nwould you consider  buying/subscribing?\n2. Is there anyone who would be interested in actually  contributing\narticles? (I would have a set of requirements TBD)\n\nAll  of the details are TBD (To Be Decided), I&#39;m just testing the\nwaters here. I  would aim for between 8-16 articles a year (the number\nof articles would  determine the number of issues) and would set an\nestimated target of  between 25-60 pages per article, and an assortment\nof other requirements.  Basically it would be in official book form,\nwith issues available to  purchase online via amazon.com,\nbarnesandnoble.barnesandnoble.&lt;WBR&gt;com etc., or if I  decide to offe\nwould be available for a  discount.\n\nSo, thoughts?\n\n\n\nI would definitely consider subscribing to such a journal. I would be  \nwilling to contribute, though I probably don&#39;t have appropriate credentials -- I  am \nnot a historian, I&#39;m a computer programmer by trade. So my efforts are  \nstricly on the amateur level. My only other possible credentials is that I  studied \nkendo for ten years.\n \nNina aka &quot;Wave Tossed&quot;\n\n\n\n************************************** AOL now offers free email to everyone. \n Find out more about what&#39;s free from AOL at http://www.aol.com.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
