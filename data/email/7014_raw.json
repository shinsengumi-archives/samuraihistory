In the original\ntitle of this thread, the first questioner wrote\n&quot;Geishas&quot;. Japanese words do not get an &quot;s&quot; added to\nthem to make them plural; it&#39;s understood by context.\nThe plural of &quot;Geisha&quot; is &quot;Geisha&quot;. This is still the\ncase even when speaking in English. You can meet one\nGeisha, or you can see many Geisha walking down the\nstreet. You wouldn&#39;t see many Geishas. Similarly, you\ncould meet a samurai, or you could go drinking with\nmany samurai, but you&#39;d never run into several\n&quot;samurais&quot;. \n\nMinor point, possibly, but it helps you sound like you\nknow what you are talking about if you can correctly\nuse the words. \n\nThanks,\n\nThe Asst. Management\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo! Mail has the best spam protection around \nhttp://mail.yahoo.com \n\n"
