One group dealt with barbarians\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; Mongols and Manchurians in the North, which\n&gt; favored\n&gt; &gt; combining calvary and archers(usually on horse)\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; the other group in the South was specialized in\n&gt; &gt; dealing with the Japanese pirates who were very\n&gt; &gt; skilled in using swords and spears.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 300,000 Ming soldiers were from the Southern group\n&gt; &gt; specialized in the Japanese warfare.\n&gt; &gt; After the war, Yi dynasty also adopted and started\n&gt; &gt; manufacturing arquebus and put more emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; training the use of swords and spears.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With regard to the topics of diplomatic issues\n&gt; among\n&gt; &gt; Ming, Japan, and Yi dynasty, the following book\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; be of use:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Book of Corrections: Reflections on the\n&gt; National\n&gt; &gt; Crisis During the Japanese Invasion of Korea,\n&gt; &gt; 1592-1598 (Korea Research Monograph, No 28)\n&gt; &gt; by Song-Nyong Yu, et al (Paperback - December\n&gt; 2002)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Song-Nyong Yu was a prime minister during the war\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; was also a very close friend to Admiral Yi,\n&gt; Sun-Shin\n&gt; &gt; from the childhood. Admiral Yi did not hold any\n&gt; higher\n&gt; &gt; commanding position until he was appointed to\n&gt; command\n&gt; &gt; the western fleet through Prime minister Song&#39;s\n&gt; strong\n&gt; &gt; recommendation only a few years before the war. He\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; not even trained for the Navy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, the Yi Royal court published the military\n&gt; &gt; training manual for the use of spears and swords\n&gt; after\n&gt; &gt; the war. Its English translation is also\n&gt; available:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Muye Dobo Tongji : Comprehensive Illustrated\n&gt; Manual of\n&gt; &gt; Martial Arts of Ancient Korea\n&gt; &gt; by Muye Dobo Tongji, et al (Paperback - October\n&gt; 2000)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lastly, for the TV series on the war, MBC\n&gt; broadcasted\n&gt; &gt; the TV series on the war in the late 80&#39;s when I\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; in the middle school. It was so good that it got\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; air through NHK(Japan). You may check both of\n&gt; &gt; broadcasting companies for more information.\n&gt; &gt; Also, KBS aired the documentray series on the war\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; 1995(?). It was not superb, but you can see real\n&gt; &gt; weapons used and the battle scenes not great in\n&gt; &gt; picture but constructed by a group of contemporary\n&gt; &gt; military officers and war experts.  I hope that\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; will help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                          Sincerely,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                          Changsub Lee\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It actually happened, in Korea, 1592-98. The\n&gt; Ming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; celestial army\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crossed the Yalu River and pushed the Japanese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samurai army way back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; south. It might be said, thou, that the Chinese\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 300,000, while the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whole Japanese troops who entered the conflict\n&gt; &gt; &gt; numbered some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 150,000-and by no means they were all there to\n&gt; fight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Chinese. After\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the push South, the situation stalemated,\n&gt; basically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; until Hideyoshi&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; death in 1598.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A very good article on these battles is in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Cambridge History of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Japan&quot; vol .4. The book costs $150,- but its\n&gt; easily\n&gt; &gt; &gt; found virtually in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every university library.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai Invasion,&quot; instead,\n&gt; concentrates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mostly on Japanese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Korean sources-very few words abt the Ming\n&gt; army.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not aware of any movie about the Japanese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; invasion of Korea. Does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody know of any??
