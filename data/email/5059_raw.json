Here&#39;s the deal. I&#39;m a past member of SFWA. I used to be a magazine \neditor. Specifically, one of the magazines was Dragon Magazine. I got to read a \nlot of fiction. I got to read some really good stuff, and got to read some \nreally bad stuff. There was very little that was in between. Some of the really \nbad stuff we all (the magazine editors) tended to save up and present bits and \npieces -- anonymously, and in good humor -- at panels called &quot;It Came from Over \nthe Transom&quot; at WorldCon and other conventions.\n\nI have to tell you, upon looking at this... what&#39;s the idea? Is it Japanese or \nnot? If it is, use Japanese names. If it&#39;s not, DON&#39;T use Japanese names. \nEspecially really FAMOUS ones. It&#39;s that simple.\n\nDon&#39;t use cutesy &quot;kinda&quot; Japanese words (&quot;jogun&quot;? come on! -- and it&#39;s spelled \n&quot;sake&quot; not &quot;saki&quot; -- but if this isn&#39;t Japan, WHY is there &quot;saki&quot;?) instead of \nthe real one. As one of my mentors once said when I tried something like that, \neither &quot;do it,&quot; or get off the pot.\n\nThe pseudo Japanese will alienate the Japanophile, and only confuse those who \ndon&#39;t care one way or another about Japan as they&#39;ll think they&#39;re missing \nsomething. If you want to see how to pseudo-fantasize Japan, look up a book \ncalled &quot;Ladylord&quot; by a good friend of mine, Sasha Miller. The names aren&#39;t \nJapanese. The words and titles are English. But the fantasy world in which the \ntale takes place is a very sinified Japan (if you know Japan) and just a cool \nfantasy world if you don&#39;t.\n\nOne of the great rules in fiction is &quot;show, don&#39;t tell.&quot; This is far too \nexpository. By the third paragraph I was already skipping and scanning.\n\nIn all honesty (and since you asked for feedback), here it is:\n\nAs -- I think -- the only one in this group who actually dealt professionally \nwith fantasy fiction on the purchasing and publishing end, I have to say that my \nreading would not make it to the second page, and it would be returned the next \nmorning with a form rejection letter.\n\nBefore you think that&#39;s not nice, consider this: I&#39;ve actually given you more \nsolid feedback on what&#39;s wrong and needs fixing in this e-mail than just about \nany professional editor who sees the ms will.\n\nSorry, but that&#39;s the way it is, in the eyes of this grizzled old veteran of \neditorial panels at SF cons.\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
