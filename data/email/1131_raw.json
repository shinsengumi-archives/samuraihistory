Andrea Brascaro did\nedit some book of Hideyoshis letters. I&#39;ve never seen it but I hazard to\nguess it wouldn&#39;t shed any light either. As for the drama itself, (which is\nthis years by the way episode 33 aired sunday night) I&#39;m rather\ndissappointed especially in the battle scenes or lack thereof, Okehazama was\na mess and Shizugatake wasn&#39;t even there. This was a let down following the\nCG enhanced battles from 2000s Aoi Tokugawa Sandai, and last years Hojo\nTokimune. However my wife loves it, and its been a hit in the ratings\nstaying in the top five dramas. Taiga drama has basically become a &#39;trendy&#39;\njidaigeki drama. I wonder what NHK will do with next years Musashi? Another\ndrama I saw had Hideyoshi in love with Ochi, Nobunagas sister. I don&#39;t think\nthey will ever make a drama about the &#39;relationship&#39; between Nobunaga and\nToshiie though..\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, August 26, 2002 10:52 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] One vs. Matsu?\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve got a question regarding the relationships\n&gt; between Kinoshita Tokichiro (the future\n&gt; Hashiba/Toyotomi Hideyoshi) and his wife One, and\n&gt; Maeda Toshiie and his wife Matsu. Most of what I&#39;ve\n&gt; read that touches on the subject is fictional works,\n&gt; notably Eiji Yoshikawa&#39;s &quot;Taiko&quot; and Taiga Drama. If\n&gt; you listen to Yoshikawa&#39;s story and the &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;\n&gt; Taiga drama (1996), One was pursued by both Tokichiro\n&gt; and Toshiie, and Tokichiro won her heart and married\n&gt; her. It&#39;s portrayed as part of his charm, how he could\n&gt; get this wonderfully beautiful (and smart) woman who\n&gt; was above his station to love the little monkey, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; After watching the first 4 episodes of &quot;Toshiie to\n&gt; Matsu&quot; (1997, I think?) the story it tells is that One\n&gt; and Matsu were vying for Toshiie&#39;s affections, and\n&gt; Matsu won. One was ordered by Nobunaga to marry\n&gt; &quot;Saru-dono&quot; (Monkey Lord) Tokichiro, and she was very\n&gt; unhappy about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know that all this is fiction. My question is, is\n&gt; there anything academic that documents the relations\n&gt; between the 4, and what is the truth about their\n&gt; relationships? Or is it all left open to fictional\n&gt; interpretation? I figured the Ehon Taiko-ki wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; go into great detail about how the great Taiko&#39;s wife\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to marry him.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is very interesting to watch the two different\n&gt; Taiga Drama&#39;s and see the differences. Quite funny,\n&gt; actually.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nate\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
