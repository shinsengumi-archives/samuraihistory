During the first years of the Tokugawa Bakufu there was a struggle\nbetween Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son Hidetada and Toyotomi Hideyori over\nsecuring different ranks from the court. This seems to imply that the title\nof Shogun was not as important as it would later become. After all Ieyasu\nhad the title only for two years before handing it over to Hidetada to the\nchagrin of Hideyori and Yodogimi.\nWhy Nobunaga and Hideyoshi didn&#39;t become shogun; there have been several\nreasons given. I think the main reason was the example of the ineffectual\nlater Ashikaga Shogunate. The position had become so bereft of power that\nneither wanted it.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;fifthchamber@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, May 12, 2001 7:59 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Question of credentials...\n\n\n&gt; Hello again all,\n&gt;  I have been reading Elizabeth Berry&#39;s excellant book &#39;Hideyoshi&#39;\n&gt; along with a biography of Tokugawa Ieyasu and I got to thinking about\n&gt; the possible reasons why Hideyoshi decided to take the title\n&gt; of &#39;Kampaku&#39; (Regent) over &#39;SeiiTai Shogun&#39;. The obvious answer is\n&gt; that Hideyoshi did not come from the Genji lineage that would have\n&gt; allowed him to hold the title...But I also read that Ieyasu&#39;s own\n&gt; lineage was never too clear cut in a line from the Minamoto. (a\n&gt; suspect link to a clan called &#39;Nitta&#39; was his claim to power)\n&gt;  In Berry&#39;s book the idea is presented that Hideyoshi was not\n&gt; concerned with the position of Shogun because that of Kampaku would\n&gt; permit him the power but without the trouble of upsetting the\n&gt; delicate balance that he had achieved with the Daimyo.\n&gt;  If Ieyasu could &#39;alter&#39; his lineage what other reasons can you all\n&gt; suggest for why Hideyoshi decided not to follow the same route?\n&gt;  Something to think over for a while maybe...\n&gt;  (Off topic please try to check out the pictures that I&#39;ve drawn of\n&gt; Samurai in a series at; www.dickyjjamison.homestead.com/artwork.html\n&gt; and please tell me what you think...Shameless plug I know but oh\n&gt; well...)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
