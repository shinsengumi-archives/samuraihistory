And yes, it was Yoshitsune.\n\n Does anybody\n&gt; better-informed than I am happen to\n&gt; recall these books, and have any views on their\n&gt; historical value? \n\nDon&#39;t know that I&#39;m better informed, but I recall\nreading one at one point. It was decent fiction, but\nhistorically....um, it was decent fiction with a\nhistorical background, how&#39;s that?\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
