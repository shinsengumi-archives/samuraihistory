(was RE: [samuraihistory] R\ne: h itokiri k\n\nNo, no--you&#39;re misunderstanding me. Onnagozen specifically addressed me by\nname, in the post replying to me which I summed up in the logical syllogism\nbelow. When I said &quot;how else ought I take it?&quot; I was referring to\nOnnagozen&#39;s post, not yours. \n\nYou&#39;ve been simply arguing a point--and not a bad one, though we&#39;re on\noccaision coming at cross purposes. No problem. However, Onnagozen attacks\nmy point that fiction is not the proper place to study your historical facts\nby saying that history books aren&#39;t all correct, so who cares? That a. makes\nno logical sense, and b. was done in such a flippant, overbearing,\ncondescending manner (to have the gall to suggest that I was saying fiction\nwas a BAD thing is simply unnerving) that yes, I take issue with it. \n\nThe only argument I can see that he/she is trying to make that makes sense\nwould be: History books have flaws, so they are worthless, so you might as\nwell learn your history from movies. \n\nThat leaves us with everyone getting their origins of WWII from &quot;Pearl\nHarbor&quot; and &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;.\nWhether you liked or disliked or were inspired or think they are great or\nbad for fostering historical discussion, to say that this alone suffices and\nyou can get a grasp of history without trying to find actual historical fact\nis plain mystifying to me. \n\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I addressed you by name (and I profusely apologize for making the \n&gt; mistake on your name) because yours was the post I was replying to. \n&gt; Still, it is directed to the group and anyone can respond to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I won&#39;t address anyone by name any longer if it causes this sort of \n&gt; misunderstanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 21, 2005 9:39 AM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?

If you reply\n&gt; directly to me, I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; going to directly answer, especially when\n&gt; addressed in an\n&gt; &gt; argumentative and combative manner.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got no problem if you or he/she or anyone\n&gt; wants to argue the\n&gt; &gt; merits and foibles of history books, in specific,\n&gt; or in general. I DO\n&gt; &gt; have a problem when this is couched as a\n&gt; counterargument to my\n&gt; &gt; statement, because it doesn&#39;t counter my statement\n&gt; whatsoever.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What we had was this: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate: &quot;Tangerines are not red.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dissenter: &quot;Well, neither are all apples red! So\n&gt; how do we really know\n&gt; &gt; which ones are red and which ones aren&#39;t? Does it\n&gt; matter?\n&gt; &gt; What does it matter if\n&gt; &gt; your apple is red and my tangerine is blue, as\n&gt; long as it inspires me? \n&gt; &gt; And certain tangerines may be of such hues of\n&gt; orange that they may be\n&gt; &gt; very very close to red.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Simple facts: not everyone can tell that\n&gt; tangerines are not red. Many\n&gt; &gt; tangerines may be so orange they are close to\n&gt; being red, but being red\n&gt; &gt; is not the point of a tangerine. For purposes of\n&gt; this analogy, all\n&gt; &gt; apples SHOULD be red--the fact that many are green\n&gt; or brown is a\n&gt; &gt; warning to the partaker that they need to check\n&gt; their apples before\n&gt; &gt; they eat them, but not grounds for saying that a.\n&gt; all apples are bad,\n&gt; &gt; or b.\n&gt; &gt; all tangerines are\n&gt; &gt; equally red with apples. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Yahoo!
