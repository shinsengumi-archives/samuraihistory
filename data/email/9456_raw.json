Ha=\r\nve you given any thought to what niche S-A quarterly might occupy\nto differ=\r\nentiate itself from those journals?\n\n \n\nIn any case, kudos to you for the i=\r\ndea. \n\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihi=\r\nstory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Kitsuno\nSent: Monday, March 19, 2007 6:=\r\n31 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Prelim t=\r\nhought - S-A Japanese History Journal\n\n \n\nI&#39;ve already posted this to the f=\r\norum, but I want to get feedback here\nas well, since there are a lot more m=\r\nembers. I am considering\n(seriously considering) publishing a quarterly Jap=\r\nanese history\njournal. The main issue to address, aside from wondering if a=\r\nnyone\nwould even want to buy it, is, I would need to gather enough articles=\r\n\nto constitute a bi-yearly or quarterly journal. So these are the\ninitial q=\r\nuestions:\n\n1. If the S-A published a history journal (actual paperback high=\r\n\nquality books), with 4-6 articles, probably totalling 80-120 pages,\nwould =\r\nyou consider buying/subscribing?\n2. Is there anyone who would be interested=\r\n in actually contributing\narticles? (I would have a set of requirements TBD=\r\n)\n\nAll of the details are TBD (To Be Decided), I&#39;m just testing the\nwaters =\r\nhere. I would aim for between 8-16 articles a year (the number\nof articles =\r\nwould determine the number of issues) and would set an\nestimated target of =\r\nbetween 25-60 pages per article, and an assortment\nof other requirements. B=\r\nasically it would be in official book form,\nwith issues available to purcha=\r\nse online via amazon.com,\nbarnesandnoble.com etc., or if I decide to offer =\r\na subscription, it\nwould be available for a discount.\n\nSo, thoughts?\n\n \n\n\n\n=\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
