The book came available at 49.00 and certainly seemed more \nfact-filled than just color photos of gorgeous swords.  Now that I do have it, and have read &#39;Japanese Swordsmanship&#39; and Mr. \nCraig&#39;s &#39;Iai&#39;,  I might like to branch out into some books that would give me a good understanding of how construction of the sword \nchanged over the passage of time.  Suggestions welcome....\n&#92;\n\nSleepily,,\nLizzie\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Clive Sinclaire\nubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai Bill.... I mean William... & another book.... was ] Re: Question...\n\n\nLizzy\nSorry not to have responded earlier but have only just returned home from Australia. The Connoiseur&#39;s Book of Japanese Swords was \nessentially written as an aid to kantei or sword appraisal. I would say that it is for the rather more advanced collector rather \nthan the beginner or less keen collector but is an essential reference for the dedicated. (I was somewhat involved in the \ntranslation and wroter the Intro so am somewhat bias maybe!)\nClive Sinclaire\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Elizabeth Chase&quot; &lt;lizzirrd@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, January 06, 2005 1:24 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Samurai Bill....
