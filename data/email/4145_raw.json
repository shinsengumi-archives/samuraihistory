Kosaka Masanobu,Yamamoto Kans=\r\nuke,Itagaki Nobutaka(he did an excellent thing with Shingen,I&#39;ll explain in=\r\n a mail) and many other........The part with excellent commanding is the 4t=\r\nh battle of Kawanakajima where he defeated the great Dragon of Echigo(Uesug=\r\ni Kenshin)....Too bad that Takeda Katsuyori(his son,he was born by lady Suw=\r\na)wasn&#39;t such a good commander like him.If he was,he could have defeated To=\r\nkugawa and Oda and bring back the peace with the Takeda clan rulling all ov=\r\ner Japan.\n\nEdy\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Me=F0al Mikit St=\r\n=F3r-ljon Oddhinsson \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesd=\r\nay, April 07, 2004 7:29 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Most Admirable Samur=\r\nai and also about Nobunaga\n\n\n  Are you kidding, Mr Alexander?\n\n  The one wh=\r\no did a real admirable work on this subject was Takeda Shingen!\n  One of th=\r\ne most admirable persons in the Japan History! Tokugawa did the\n  unifying =\r\nof Japan because his incursions had peace as a goal, unlike the\n  christian=\r\n Nobunaga, that only spread terrorism and genocide.\n\n  And yes, I admire hi=\r\nm as well Musashi. Of course I am speaking about\n  Takeda...\n\n  Btw, that s=\r\ntatements (babbling in japanese) about Musashi being not fammous\n  to real =\r\njapan dwellers is ridiculous. Sorry if I offend anyone, but I have\n  some b=\r\nasis to call the attention of all.\n\n  First of all, his book Go Rin No Shou=\r\n is obrigatory reading to several japan\n  executive staff people.\n\n  Second=\r\n, There was a Japanese TV Series Drama about Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s\n  biography=\r\n and it was very popular in Japan.\n\n  Third, there was TONS of manga and ge=\r\nkiga that was in homnage of Musashi,\n  mentioned him somewhere or used a ve=\r\nrsion of him like an popular comic manga\n  of the 80s that had a kind of Mu=\r\nsashi-Kid as its principal character.\n\n  I remember a joke very well inside=\r\n such manga...\n\n  There was a duel between musashi-kid and another little s=\r\namurai about who\n  would be a better samurai.\n\n  Musashi glared to him and =\r\nhe glared to Musashi, and no one lost this face\n  down. Then the little sam=\r\nurai told Musashi this:\n\n  &quot;Bushido&#39;s way is to not be afraid of Death, in =\r\nfact is to live in death&quot;,\n  then suddendly he killed himself in front of M=\r\nusashi just to prove him that\n  he is better than Musashi.\n\n  With tears on=\r\n his face, Musashi said that this is correct, but NOT NECESSARY\n  in this W=\r\nAY!!!\n\n  (this was supposed to be a joke in such a dark humour typical of s=\r\nuch comics\n  serie and of course, was not published in english)\n\n  Also, I&#39;=\r\nve heard about Musashi much time before all this NIPON-Modism, and\n  it was=\r\n around the 80&#39;s as well!\n\n  Sincerelly\n\n  Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de=\r\n Carvalho\n  S=E3o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\n  Message: 1\n     Date: Mon, 5 Apr 20=\r\n04 11:29:47 +0300\n     From: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;edy@...&gt;\n  Subject: Re=\r\n: Digest Number 768\n\n  No,Tokugawa and Hideyoshi would never have ended lik=\r\ne they did.If Nobunaga\n  didn&#39;t take all that territory,Hideyoshi would hav=\r\ne never been to\n  Korea.....and perhaps the Tokugawa dinasty would&#39;t have e=\r\nxisted....\n\n  Edy\n    ----- Original Message -----\n    From: Thiago Buschin=\r\nelli Sorrentino\n    To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n    Sent: Monday, Ap=\r\nril 05, 2004 12:27 AM\n    Subject: RES: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 768\n=\r\n\n\n\n    Anyways, would Hideiyoshi and Tokugawa have gotten that far without\n=\r\n    Nobunaga=B4s incursions?
