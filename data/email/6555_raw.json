It asked specifically about a\nBATTLE--not a war, or political struggle, between\nHideyoshi and Ieyasu, not between Ieyasu and\nHideyoshi&#39;s house, line, progeny, what have you.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be this:\n\nHideyoshi and Ieyasu squared off against each other in\nwhat was called the Komaki Campaign. Ostensibly,\nIeyasu was supporting Oda Nobuo against Hideyoshi, but\nthe contest was really between the two of them. Both\nsides fortified some castles in the Owari-Mino area,\nalong the Tokaido. Neither side moved, and neither\ncould gain a tactical advantage, until forces of\nHideyoshi&#39;s led by Ikeda Shonyu attempted a flanking\nattack on the Tokugawa position. Ieyasu had\nanticipated the move, and a during a running battle\ncalled the Battle of Nagakute, Tokugawa forces\ndefeated Hideyoshi&#39;s force. Each side learned about\nthe other--Hideyoshi learned that any attempt to move\nagainst Ieyasu would be difficult at best, and he&#39;d\nlost a lot of time and men doing it. Ieyasu learned\nthat he could hold off Hideyoshi for a long time, but\nif push came to shove he&#39;d eventually lose. So the\ncampaign was essentially a draw. Tactical victory for\nIeyasu, strategic victory for Hideyoshi.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo! Mail - Easier than ever with enhanced search.
