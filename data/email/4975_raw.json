Of \n&gt; course the body was never found so it&#39;s impossible\n&gt; to say for sure \n&gt; (like alot of things about that night...).\n\nNo one really knows. If they did, we&#39;d either a. hear\nabout how the body was found by the Akechi, or b. how\nsome intrepid Oda samurai spirited away his head, to\nkeep it from falling into Mitsuhide&#39;s hands. \n\nAs regaring whether Nobunaga&#39;s suicide was honorable\nor not, I&#39;d say in this case, sure, since he didn&#39;t\nreally have a choice. He fought against the Akechi\nattack until he ran out of arrows and the situation\nwas hopeless, and retired to commit seppuku (as far as\nis known) only at the last minute. There was no avenue\nof escape, for him to &quot;fight another day&quot;. \n\nTo be honest, this attitude is perfectly accepted in\nthe military today--I&#39;ve had several discussions with\nfellow army officers where we all said we&#39;d save a\nbullet in our 9mm for us, should the prospect of being\ncaptured by the north Koreans (I was stationed twice\nalong the DMZ) in the event of a war. However, the key\nhere really isn&#39;t the prospect of dishonor--to any\ndecent enemy, I&#39;d fight until I couldn&#39;t fight\nanymore, and then surrender if there was nothing else\nI could do. However, Charles Jenkins notwithstanding,\nthe nK doesn&#39;t have a great reputation for treatment\nof enemy soldiers, as with most communist regimes. I\nadmire men like John McCain quite a lot, but I&#39;d be\nsorely tempted to let my wife collect on my insurance\nrather than face captivity under those conditions. \n\nAnother question--where the heck does this &quot;Digest\nNumber XXX&quot; stuff come from? That wasn&#39;t the original\ntitle of this thread. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
