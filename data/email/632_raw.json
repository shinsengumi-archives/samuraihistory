Paul Varley, Penguin Books, 1974;\nthough it&#39;s a short book it&#39;s very much in tune with Sadler&#39;s narrative.\n\nWhat I found to be a &#39;surprise packet&#39; was Malcolm Kennedy&#39;s &quot;A Short\nHistory of Japan&quot; Mentor Books, 1964;  the first half of the book is a\nwonderful portrayal of the samurai in Japanese history, quite in-depth\nreally.\n\nYou&#39;ve probably read John Allyn&#39;s &quot;The 47 Ronin Story&quot; Tuttle, 1983 --\nthough a little slow as a novel the insights into the motivation of the\nheroes are good. Jack Seward&#39;s &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot; [Japanese Ritual Suicide] Tuttle,\n1984 is a nicely graphic account of Seppuku in action!\n\nSome of the more &#39;academic&#39; types of tome, that I found very interesting\nwere:-  &quot;Meiji 1868&quot; [Revolution and Counter-revolution in Japan], Paul\nAkamatsu, George Allen & Unwin, 1972;\n&quot;Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration&quot; by Marius Jansen, Standford Uni.\nPress, 1971;\n&quot;Studies in the Institutional History of Early  Modern Japan&quot;, Hall &\nJansen, Princeton Uni. Press, 1970\n\nAs a contrast to Lafcadio Hearn&#39;s writings, you may like Lord Redesdale&#39;s\n&quot;Tales of Old Japan&quot; -- my copy is a  Macmillan & Co., 1910 - it still may\nbe in print somewhere;  the stories seem so fresh & new...\nAnother nice yarn is Elizabeth Gray Vining&#39;s &quot;Windows for the Crown Prince&quot;\nLippincott, 1952 -- it&#39;s the personal story of an American woman&#39;s 4 years\nas private tutor to the Crown Prince Akihito (Now Emperor).\nGood reading, David.\nSteve Lofts\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;William Letham&quot; &lt;samuraiw@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, February 28, 2002 4:01 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Japanese historical fiction\n\n\n&gt; Could you give me some more info on the books by Newman, Wienck, Mabire &\n&gt; Breheret.

I&#39;m a simple bugei who loves to read\nabout\n&gt; &gt; those warriors, & their times, who practiced their martial specialties\n&gt; &gt; somewhat more seriously than I (due to obvious reasons), although I have\n&gt; &gt; been a practitioner for some twenty years.  My own Japanese is limited &\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve only visited Japan twice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree with Alex:  big novelisations, like those of Yoshikawa&#39;s, are a\n&gt; &gt; great way to pick-up &quot;the flavour&quot; of our subject/topic of interest.\n&gt; &gt; General Studies, like those of Newman, Wiencek & Cook are also very\nuseful\n&gt; &gt; as is Friday&#39;s &quot;Hired Swords&quot; (which I believe is quite accessible for\nus\n&gt; &gt; amateurs).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sadler&#39;s &quot;The Maker of Modern Japan&quot;, Mabire & Breheret&#39;s &quot;The Samurai&quot;\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; good and Wilson&#39;s translations:- &quot;Ideals of the Samurai&quot; & the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Budoshoshinshu&quot; are really great.  &quot;Musui&#39;s Story - the Autobiogaphy of\na\n&gt; &gt; Tokugawa Samurai by Katsu Kokichi is absolutely marvellous as a journal\nof\n&gt; &gt; the first half of the nineteenth century.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d also like to concur with Scott Nicholas, who noted that the\nemergence\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;samurai&quot; militarily was during Masakado&#39;s rebellion.\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Steve Lofts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Alex Hazlett&quot; &lt;arexu@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &quot;samurai list&quot; &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, February 25, 2002 3:24 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Japanese historical fiction\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    For those of you who did want their history in a big novelization,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have you seen the works of Eiji Yoshikawa? These are huge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (many hundreds of pages) tomes (His book on Musashi was printed in 5\n&gt; &gt; &gt; volumes I believe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I read &#39;Musashi&#39; and &#39;Taiko&#39; for sure, and perhaps another on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Heike,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they are long reads but well worth the time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alex Hazlett\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; p.s. according to amazon.com, people who buy &#39;Taiko&#39; are likely to buy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; books by:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Takuan Soho\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stephen Turnbull &lt;---------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; John Allyn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Miyamoto Musashi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yagyu Munenori\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
