A character, reading from a book (probably a history book) stated that Japan did not have an army until 1868, the year that the Emperor Meji was restored.\n\nI hate to sound like a politician, but it probably depends on what you mean by an &quot;army&quot;.  You could argue that until the Meji restoration that Japan did not have a central army, on the grounds that before then it had clan based provincial armies.\n\nEven the Shogun&#39;s army could be considered his own personal army as opposed to a national Japanese army. Certainly, the Emperor did not have an army.\n\nBesides, it&#39;s a great TV show and they usually get things right.\n\nBob Burke\n\nIn a message dated 2/6/2004 5:16:09 PM Eastern Standard Time, &quot;Heishiro Mitsurugi&quot; &lt;mitsurugi_guy@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt;Last night, Feb. 5, CSI had a new episode where a colletion of 17th\n&gt;Japanese samurai antiques were stolen. There was samurai armor in the\n&gt;mix and the lead guy said it was out of place because there was no\n&gt;formal Japanese military until 1865. Am I wrong, but I thought when\n&gt;the army went to Meiji they did away with the armor and used the\n&gt;uniform and guns or did I just misundertand what happened?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;--- \n&gt;Yahoo!
