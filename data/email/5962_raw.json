Any\n&gt; way i was wondering if any one can help me with\n&gt; sword names, was it a common pratice to name swords,\n&gt; i know that one of musashis opponenets ( i forget ,\n&gt; very shameful of me i know) names his sword of\n&gt; length, dfrying pole or something like that. Any way\n&gt; im intrested in learning and knowing any swords\n&gt; named by famous samurai and how common the practice\n&gt; was,oh and this isnt a harsh forum as ive been\n&gt; helped many a time by the better educated among as\n&gt; thanks all ,\n&gt; james\n\nJames--\n\nFamous works of art, whether they were swords, tea\nutensils, or other items, were often given names. Yes,\naccording to tradition Musashi&#39;s famous opponent\nSasaki Kojiro named his sword &quot;drying pole&quot;, I believe\ndue to it&#39;s length. I&#39;m not a Musashi afficionado, so\nI can&#39;t provide anything further. \n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nMeet the all-new My Yahoo! - Try it today! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
