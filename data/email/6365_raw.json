Its virtues were\npermanently established by Yoritomo - he required that his\nwarriors lead the simple life, avoid display, exhibit a high\ndegree of physical and moral courage, maintain their martial\nreadiness at all times, and serve with unswerving loyalty.\n\nIts vices were established almost simultaneously - the tactical\ngenius of his younger brother Yoshitsune was the living model\nof the classical warrior espoused by his brother - yet\nYoshitsune - and the ideal - was betrayed by Yoshimoto who\nsuccumbed to the personal and political expediency of removing\nany potential opponent from the field, innocent or otherwise.\n\nThis tension between loyalty and self-serving ambition\ncharacterises the samurai from that moment on - an arc that\nbegan to fall from the moment of Yoshitsune&#39;s death and\ncontinued in its downward arc, with ever but a few bright\nexceptions, towards its lowest ebb at the close of the Sengoku\n- a decline brought to a halt by the establishment of the\nTokugawa bakafu.\n\nFrom here the whole fallen image of the noble warrior was\nreconstructed along new lines and with a new expression,\ndemanding a moral example (in times of peace) in place of the\nmartial example (in times of war) - Do, not jutsu - the way\nrather than the art.\n\nMy perspective on the samurai is always that of the swordsman,\nbut in my mind it is only against the background of his place\nand time that the brilliance of these men shines forth in all\nits true colour.\n\nI also happily acknowledge that, by the same token, there were\nsamurai in every age who stood as exemplars of their calling,\nwithout ever having to prove themselves by the carriage of arms.\n\nyours, waxing lyrically,\n\nThomas\n\nThomas -\n\tat the risk of spoiling the mystique (sorry, couldn&#39;t resist) of the\noblique manner in which your lyricism here addresses its object (its subject\nbeing quite delightfully clear)... permit me to ask how you see this\npertaining to recent conversations.  Please note that I&#39;m intrigued, not\ndubious.\n\tAnd that&#39;s a marvelous little essay.  If you aren&#39;t published, you ought to\ngive it some thought. (If you are, what&#39;ve you written?)\n\t\tGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
