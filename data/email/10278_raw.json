Samurai archives (dictionary) m=\r\nentions Michiyori, based in Iyo province in the second half of XVIth centur=\r\ny. Yorikatsu was an officer of Kobayakawa Hideaki at the battle of Sekigaha=\r\nra (Sadler, The life of Tokugawa Ieyasu). The Kobayakawa were based in the =\r\nsouth of Aki province and were separated from Iyo province by the Inland se=\r\na but had a long and friendly relationship with clans of Iyo (notably Kawan=\r\no/Kono and Murakami). I presume Michiyori and Yorikatsu were members of the=\r\n same family or of branches of the Hiraoka, as well as Yoriyasu who, circa =\r\n1620 held a domain of 10.000 koku in Mino (Mass and Hauser, The Bakufu in J=\r\napanese history). As usual, the family had a special kanji : yori in this c=\r\nase.\n\n\n&gt; Message du 29/12/10 06:58\n&gt; De : &quot;Paul Martin&quot; \n&gt; A : samuraihisto=\r\nry@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Copie =C3=A0 : \n&gt; Objet : RE: [samuraihistory] Simple =\r\nSengoku Daimyo Question\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; Does anyone have any information=\r\n on this guy: Hiraoka Yorikatsu Born 1560.
