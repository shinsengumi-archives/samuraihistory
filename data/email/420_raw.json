Here are a few:\n\nBow with various arrow heads\nNaginata:  Sort of a sword blad on a long pole(glave)\nYari:  Spear which could vary depending on your\nposition.  Samurai usually carried a shorter single\ncombat version for on horse back or single combat. \nAhigaru(foot soldiers) often times used a very long\nversion used en masse against calvary or other troops.\nStephen Turnbull has an excellent description of this\nin his book &quot; Samurai Sourcebook&quot;.\nKatana:  The sword carried by the samurai on his left\nside blade up(in earlier periods such as kamakura it\nwas worn tachi style with the blade down from a sling\nof sorts) This wewapon was not the main weapon on the\nbattle field for the samurai as was usually thought. \nThis weapon could be considered secondary to the yari.\nTanto:  This knife was carried in place of the short\nsword called the wakizashi while wearing armor.  This\nweapon was used in hanbd-tohand combat and could also\nbe used to take the head of your enemy.  Last resort\nweapon.\nNo-dachi:  Not a very popular weapon during the\nsengoku-Jidai but was seen.  This is essentially a\nreally long katana.  Sometimes as long as 6 feet. \nThought this was unusual.  Used more like a naginata\nthan a sword it could be used against a man on horse\nback.\n\n\nThis is a small list of the major weapons and you can\nfind more in almost any book but i would highly\nrecommend if you want good pictures and descriptions\nyou pick up any anthony J. Bryant book, or any stephen\nturnbull book on the samurai subject.  Also Arms and\nArmour of the Samurai by A.P. Bottomley and Thompson. \nThese are all good basics books on samurai arms.\n\nMusashi\n--- Edwin Angulo &lt;mayalan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi!!\n&gt; \n&gt;  My name is Edwin, I am from mexico, i am an\n&gt; archaeologist, and i`m researching about the\n&gt; sengoku-jidai, i wonder, have any of you a list of\n&gt; weapons used by the warriors of this age?, or there\n&gt; is\n&gt; any book in which i can found this information?\n&gt; \n&gt;  Thanks!!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Edwin Angulo Torres.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Buy the perfect holiday gifts at Yahoo!
