It \ntook me a while to dig s=\r\nome of this up so apologies to the list for \nthe gap=C5c\n\n\n&quot;Komori Genjiro,=\r\n he changed his name into Kawakami \nGensai(Hitokiri-Gensai). He changed his=\r\n name further into Takada \nGenbe...&quot;\n\nI know three &quot;Hitokiri&quot;;=DD Hitokiri =\r\nHanzo (Nakamura Hanjiro)=DD , \nHitokiri Izo, and another Hitokiri Hanzo. Th=\r\ne first was Kirino \nToshiaki of Satsuma, who changed his name, to that of t=\r\nhe =C5gmain \nhouse=C5h (Kirino)when he became an officer in the new Army of=\r\n Satsuma. \nHe got the nickname as a young hot head in Kyoto where he is sai=\r\nd to \nhave cut down a man in a crowded street in broad daylight. The second=\r\n \nwas Okada Izo of Tosa, who killed several men in Kochi (maybe more in \nKy=\r\noto)who were opposed to the initiatives of the Tosa loyalist party \nand Tak=\r\nechi Zuizan. A fictionalized version of his life can be seen \nin the film =\r\n=C5gHitokiri=C5h starring Katsu Shin. The third seems to have \nbeen lost in=\r\n the shadow of these other two, I find only brief mention \nof him.\n\tKawakam=\r\ni Gensai, I know as the man who killed Sakuma Shozan, \nbut didn=C5ft know m=\r\nuch else until I looked into him. He was indeed \ncalled =C5gHitokiri Gensai=\r\n=C5h, though Sakuma is the only man we know for \nsure that he killed.\n\tHe w=\r\nas one of the major domo of the Hosokawa mansion in Edo, \nwhen four men fre=\r\nsh from the Sakurada mon-gai presented themselves at \nthe door. The house w=\r\nas in a panic no one seemed to know what to do. \nGensai however, took charg=\r\ne of the situation as soon as he was \ninformed, calling for the doctor and =\r\nseeing to their baths and \nclothing. Providing them with tea and every comf=\r\nort, he expressed his \nadmiration even as he notified the authorities as wa=\r\ns his duty.\n\tA supporter of the Emperor his whole life he survived the \nRes=\r\ntoration, was a member of the Jinpuren and=DD rebelled against the \nnew gov=\r\nernment in the Mei-yon jiken. Because he was something of a \nchatty cathy h=\r\nis fellow prisoners described him as =C5gfeminine=C5h, it \nwas said that hi=\r\ns reputation did not match his appearance. However he \nwas quick to temper,=\r\n he killed Sakuma based only on rumour, and \nresolute in his beliefs. The a=\r\nuthorities knowing him to be a man of \nhonor and education offered to pardo=\r\nn him if he would work with them \nbut he refused. Kido himself said that if=\r\n he were released he would \ncause trouble, so he was executed on his order,=\r\n he was 38.\n\n=DD\n=DDAnd, purportedly kendo lost its flare and popularity im=\r\nmediately \nafter the Meiji Restoration; how true is that?\n\nThe short answer=\r\n is it=C5fs true. With the triumph of western tactics \nand weapons over the=\r\n Bakufu, the banning of swords as symbol of \nrank,and the suppression of th=\r\ne Satsuma Rebellion. The Japanese sword \nand its related arts seemed doomed=\r\n to extinction. There are stories \nof sword teachers who simply walked off =\r\ninto the mountains never to \nbe seen again.\n\tA whole lifestyle and whole in=\r\ndustries seemed to be vanishing \nin the face of a crazed adoption of everyt=\r\nhing western. English was \nproposed as the official language, school girls =\r\nhad to wear the \nfashions popular in the capitols of Europe, Men cut off th=\r\neir \ntopknots and many Buddhist temples, castles and other institutions \nwe=\r\nre destroyed. It was a sad state of affairs.\n\tFukuzawa Yukichi who had once=\r\n been the great reformer, now \ntook the advice of European friends and advo=\r\ncated the preservation of \ntraditional dress and custom. Much of the damage=\r\n had already been \ndone though. Japan seems to have gone thru this phase of=\r\n accepting \nand then rejecting western influence several times after the \nR=\r\nestoration. Kano Jigoro and others were part of the Japanese effort \nto pre=\r\nserve and spread the best of traditional Japanese culture. Thus \nwe saw the=\r\n birth of =C5gModern=C5h kendo after many of the teachers of \nthe late Edo =\r\nperiod had ceased to be.\n-t\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been =\r\nremoved]\n\n\n"
