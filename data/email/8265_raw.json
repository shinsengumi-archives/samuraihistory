I don&#39;t have the\n&gt; time at the moment to\n&gt; address this fully, but the consequences is that it\n&gt; reinforces the\n&gt; long held stereotypes and does nothing to show the\n&gt; real history. There\n&gt; are a lot of people here than I&#39;m sure agree with\n&gt; me. You&#39;ve come to\n&gt; the right place with  your topic. I hope others here\n&gt; speak up. Nate,\n&gt; Tony - get to work! &lt;g&gt;\n\nFoxfoil, start HERE:\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\n\nHere are 11, plus two WONDERFULLY written bonus\nsections :), common misconceptions Westerners hold\nabout the samurai, perpetuated by Hollywood and other\nfiction. \n\nMore later when I&#39;ve got time. \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
