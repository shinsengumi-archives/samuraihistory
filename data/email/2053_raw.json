It is a \nbit novelized, but still a very interesting depiction (and very well \nresearched) of some Shinsengumi members, including Isami Kondo and \nKamo Serizawa.\n\nHope that helped...\n\n\n\n&gt; Hi all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m new. Hope I&#39;m in the right place to ask this. I&#39;m researching \n&gt; key figures of the Shinsengumi, particularly Isami Kondo and \n&gt; Kamo Serizawa. They were of course members of the \n&gt; Shinsengumi, but I&#39;ve also run accross something called the \n&gt; Shinchogumi. It that the same thing? If not, what is it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help much appreciated,\n&gt; \n&gt; St. John Lord Merridewe\n\n\n"
