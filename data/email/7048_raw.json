I just \nreread the introduction and was struck again by the description of the \nmeeting of the veterans of Changi in Tokyo. There seems to be such a \nsilence on what the Japanese actually did, saw and experienced first \nhand in SE Asia - there are many Australian histories and memoirs of \nBurma, Thailand, New Guinea etc, which make agonising reading. It \nalways seems to me one of the great tragedies of a tragic war (&quot;the war \nwithout mercy&quot;):  the Japanese could have liberated Asia from \ncolonialism (well, they did effectively), but for most nations the \nliberator was worse than the coloniser, and the lingering results still \ncolour foreign policy in the region.\n\n(Just celebrated ANZAC day here in Australia, so there&#39;s been a lot of \nmedia coverage of war)\n\nGillian\n\n"
