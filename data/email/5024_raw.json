I&#39;d like to \nmake it as real and accurate as possible, even though it is a fantasy \nworld, and some of the questions I have might have instructive \nanswers for the list people.\n\nThe questions I&#39;d like to start off with are:\n\n1. What were the penalties (if any, social or otherwise) of women \ndressing like men, and men dressing like women, in Japanese culture \nof that time?\n\n2. When did revenge killing become illegal, and what were the \npenalties?\n\n3. What would be the penalties for killing a shogun, and likely \nrepercussions politically of a shogun&#39;s murder?\n\n4. When did a sword without a tsuba (yes, I&#39;ll say it, like Lucy \nLiu&#39;s sword in Kill Bill) become acceptable, if it ever did?\n\nI realize these questions might be far more complex than a single \npost- or even ten posts- could answer. I appreciate any help- and of \ncourse, anyone who helps out will be listed in the acknowledgements \nif and when I get this book to print.\n\nLili\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
