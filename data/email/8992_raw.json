It was a\ncamellia by the name of &quot;kamohonami&quot;.  His lady friend in Japan asked me if I\ncould &quot;rescue&quot; the plant from his garden because it was planted in her honour.\nApparently my friend had great difficulty in finding this particular variety,\ntaking 18 months to do so.  I immediately recognised the name &quot;Hon&#39;ami&quot; as that\nof the famous family of sword appraisers, and guessed that &quot;Kamo&quot; meant\nsomething else.  Being a sword man I never bothered to chase it up until now,\nbut I do know that flowers are usually named after something of significance to\nthe namer.\n\nPutting &quot;kamohonami&quot; into google gave this link, which offers kanji for the name\nand an explanation:\n\nhttp://www8.ocn.ne.jp/~novalis/kamohonami.html\n\n加茂本阿弥\n(Kamo-Honnami)\nKamo=&#39;a place in Kyoto&#39;\nHonnami=&#39;An active famous artist in the Azuchi-Momoyama Period&#39;\n\nA couple of other links were interesting, one for Ikebana followers of the Enshu\nschool.\n\nRegards,\n\nW.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;QueenBee_15@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, July 24, 2006 1:58 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] (unknown)\n\n\nwould like to get history on the japanese last name &quot;kamo&quot; if anyone has\nany info?\n\n\n\n"
