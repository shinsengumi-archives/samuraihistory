I agree with you, I just watched\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; Bojustu DVD and I think he should be sued for what\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; says in that DVD. Lie after Lie. Lets get one\n&gt; thing\n&gt; &gt; straight - I know from your past quotes you know\n&gt; &gt; nothing really about The Bujinkan or Hayes or even\n&gt; &gt; Hatsumi. Hatsumi did not Teach Hayes everything he\n&gt; &gt; knows, It has been discussed openly on Bujinkan\n&gt; &gt; forums\n&gt; &gt; and its been pointed out that hayes has fabricated\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; large amount of information, he is also credited\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; inventing the straight sword theory. \n&gt; \n&gt; No, nor do I claim to know. I study history--not\n&gt; martial arts. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just because Hayes is in it does not mean it is\n&gt; bad.\n&gt; &gt; Again if you havent seen it why attack it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I&#39;ve said in another reply to you, I&#39;ve made 1\n&gt; post\n&gt; regarding the documentary. I&#39;ve REPLIED to many\n&gt; posts\n&gt; now with comments about Hayes. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; Or �it is that perhaps did You more than\n&gt; Hayes\n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Budo Taijutsu?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend you see the film and train dogs,\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; martial arts. Not with a heart closed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Very insulting. Helly is a martial artist who so\n&gt; &gt; happens to be in Budo Taijutsu, so what. I suggest\n&gt; &gt; that you shut up , stop insuulting people you dont\n&gt; &gt; know, stop insulting material you have yet to see.\n&gt; &gt; As\n&gt; &gt; a moderator in this forum your behavior here is\n&gt; &gt; disgusting. In the past you have told people to\n&gt; stop\n&gt; &gt; such behavior and here you are - the sole cause of\n&gt; &gt; all\n&gt; &gt; insults.\n&gt; \n&gt; Learn to attribute the correct insult to the correct\n&gt; person, my friend. Helly said what you quoted above\n&gt; to\n&gt; ME, not the other way around. I quoted it in\n&gt; response\n&gt; to him to ask him what he was talking about. The\n&gt; only\n&gt; thing I&#39;ve said insulting to Helly, possibly, is\n&gt; questioning his grasp of the English language--and\n&gt; since he&#39;s a native of another country, it&#39;s not\n&gt; meant\n&gt; to be insulting. I simply had no idea what he said\n&gt; in\n&gt; a certain passage. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am quite shocked at your comments and behavior,\n&gt; &gt; especially as you  are a moderator - not the what\n&gt; we\n&gt; &gt; would expect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, learn to recognize who is typing what. Shall\n&gt; I\n&gt; repost Helly&#39;s reply to me for you? Here you go: \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by\n&gt; the\n&gt; Budo Taijutsu? I recommend you see the film and\n&gt; train\n&gt; dogs, not martial arts. Not with a heart closed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m still not sure I understand what the heck he&#39;s\n&gt; talking about, at least in the first sentence. If\n&gt; you&#39;re both members of the Budo Taijutsu, then\n&gt; please\n&gt; set your fellow martial artist straight about Hayes,\n&gt; for one. Secondly, you can pass on to him that both\n&gt; of\n&gt; my dogs are trained, though not in martial arts.\n&gt; Sit,\n&gt; down, stay...these they can do. \n&gt; \n&gt; NOW, if there is any further issue with the above\n&gt; quote, then please direct it to me offline. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; Discover Yahoo! \n&gt; Stay in touch with email, IM, photo sharing and\n&gt; more.
