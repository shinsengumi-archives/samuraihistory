We all know that the Nagashino scene\nin &quot;Kagemusha&quot; isn&#39;t the way it really happened--the\nTakeda cavalry didn&#39;t die in a 9 minute span from\nrapid-fire Oda arqubusiers mowing them down like WWI\nGerman machine gunners against a British &quot;Over the\nTop&quot; Charge. But it fits the cinematic effect desired,\nso none of us complain about it. (And that&#39;s ignoring\nthe red sky and all that, too)\n\nI&#39;m anticipating that this will not be the case--not\nwith Tom Cruise in it. They&#39;ll mess something up.\nMaybe it&#39;s just my natural bias against this time\nperiod, and the fact that I&#39;m sure that there will be\na gaudy amount of talk about Bushido and honor and\nstereotypical crap, and that some of the language will\nbe wrong, and the costumes, and other things that\naren&#39;t hard to get right will be wrong...\n\nBut, I will go and see it, and might be surprised. And\nI might like it, despite whatever is wrong. I&#39;m just\nnot getting my hopes up. \n\nNate\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
