They just need to research more on history even to make their \nfiction movies. \n\nWant something really worse? \nThere is some babbling about another movie with a bride holding an bad \nreplica of an japanese katana.. Unfortunatelly I didn�t remember the \ntitle... \n\nBe well \n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho \nS�o Paulo-SP Brazil \n\n\n\n&gt;Message: 2 \n&gt; Date: Sat, 10 Jan 2004 17:20:22 -1000 \n&gt; From: Cesare Polenghi \n&gt;Subject: Re: The Last Samurai \n&gt; \n&gt;Historically it was as accurate as... Gladiator: not much. The setting \n&gt;is historically sound, the events are pure Hollywood fiction, but why \n&gt;not? People loved it!! I think all over it was a good movie, even with \n&gt;all its inconsistencies. I especially enjoyed the part when Algren is \n&gt;&quot;prisoner&#39; in the Japanese village, and &quot;learns&quot; to be Japanese. The \n&gt;first battle (in the forest) was EXCELLENT as well. The scene with the \n&gt;samurai coming out of the mist... Kurosawa himself would have loved \n&gt;that. \n&gt; \n&gt;*** SPOILER DOWN HERE *** \n&gt; \n&gt;The lamest part was at the end, when the Emperor refused to sign a deal \n&gt;with the Americans just because of Algren bringing back Katsumoto&#39;s \n&gt;sword. That was a bit like... mmmmhhhh... I was happy thou that Algren \n&gt;went back to his girlfriend (Ok, ok, I know I&#39;m cheesy...) \n&gt; \n&gt;Anyway, good movie, and I&#39;ll buy the DVD as soon as it comes out. \n&gt;cepo \n&gt; \n&gt;On Jan 10, 2004, at 7:48 AM, spud10000 wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have just seen The Last Samurai.

I found it very emotional, which is strange, \n&gt;&gt; because I am not an emotional person. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; P.S How historically accurate was it? \n\n_________________________________________________________\nVoce quer um iGMail protegido contra v�rus e spams?\nClique aqui: http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\nOfertas imperd�veis!
