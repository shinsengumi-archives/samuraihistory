The myth promulgated during the Edo period when \nthere were no more wars -- a myth designed to give the non-warrior warrior class \na mystique and reason for being.\n\nSamurai were just like everyone else. Some were brave, some were not; some were \nclever, some were not; some were devout, some were not; some believed in loyalty \nabove all, some believed in looking out for number one.\n\nThink about it. If there was a single universal code of bushido, there never \nwould have been any conflict or struggle because SOMEONE SOMEWHERE was violating \nthat &quot;code&quot; to create struggle.\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
