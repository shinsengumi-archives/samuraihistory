But only a handful of\n&gt; soldiers joined him. Everyone else shouted him down as a crazy man. He\n&gt; committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.\n\nThat was hardly an uprising, and it wasn&#39;t a general. It was novelist Mishima \nYukio, card carrying whacko, who harrangued the army at Japan&#39;s military HQ. No \none joined him -- they all laughed. The only people *with* him were loonies who \nwere in his private &quot;militia.&quot;\n\nTony\n\n\n"
