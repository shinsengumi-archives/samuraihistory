Definately a good start. Also, head out to Barnes and \nNoble (or Amazon) and check the mythology section for books like \n&quot;Japanese Fairy Tales&quot; by Keiske Nishimoto and other such books. A \nlittle study of Shinto will reveal some interesting Japanese tales as well.\n_Joe\n\nps - be sure to check out the &quot;kappa&quot; turtle-demon!!!!\n\n Andrea Smith wrote:\n\n&gt;Hey, I put my mind into what I&#39;m writing and now I\n&gt;need some help with Japanese legends, I live in the\n&gt;real world but my mind wanders into the fantasy. I&#39;m\n&gt;writing a samurai legend and I&#39;m still looking on the\n&gt;Internet and I can&#39;t find what I&#39;m looking for, were\n&gt;there samurai that had legends written about them?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
