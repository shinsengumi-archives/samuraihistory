Always foundhim to be very welcoming\nand exstremely friendly even when he dont recogise me\nor remember me at first from perevious visits.\n\nMy first meeting with him was out of this world, he\nnot only took me to the storage area but then took me\nto the public display and explained what many of the\nmain items on display were.\n\nHe has been most helpful in my (self taught) study of\narmour making, it was he would told  me to search out\nAnthony&#39;s armour site. with the site and Ian&#39;s one on\none I managed to produce a very nice set of armoured\nsleeves.\n\nI have always found him very responsive to emails as\nwell when I have had questions to ask.\n\npaul\n\n\n--- Barry Thomas &lt;warlord@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nJust a faint &quot;ding&quot; of memory here, but I seem to\nrecall that Ian Bottomley\nof the Leeds Royal Armouries has an interest in this. \nPerhaps a look at\ntheir website might reveal something?  I haven&#39;t heard\nanything about Ian\nfor seemingly years now - anybody heard anything about\nhim??\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: kelly smith &lt;kellylindawd@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, October 16, 2004 4:59 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] firearm training\n\ni want to know anything thats out there on the\njapanese matchlocks and how\nthey were used and by whom.\nPlease share with me anything you might find out\n\nthank you\n\nWayne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
