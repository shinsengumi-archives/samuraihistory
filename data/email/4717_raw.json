There is a \nmodern definition of shaku which is defined in mercantile law. this \nis the shaku that zevlord has given you - it is almost exactly \nequal to a US &#39;foot&#39;, or about 30 cm.\n\nBut even today there are different kinds of shaku for different \npurposes (the most famous example being the kujira-jaku which is \nused in creating kimono). Historically there were many different \nkinds of shaku depending on the time period, the thing being \nmeasured, and the location. There were not large differences (shaku \nnever means &#39;60 cm&#39; for example).\n\nIn other words - today when a person says &#39;shaku&#39; you can think \n&#39;about 30 cm&#39;, and probably be safe. But when reading history, it&#39;s \nactually quite difficult to know what might have been meant by \n&#39;shaku&#39; in any given circumstance.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
