It \n&gt; took me a while to dig some of this up so apologies\n&gt; to the list for \n&gt; the gap�c\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Komori Genjiro, he changed his name into Kawakami \n&gt; Gensai(Hitokiri-Gensai). He changed his name further\n&gt; into Takada \n&gt; Genbe...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I know three &quot;Hitokiri&quot;;� Hitokiri Hanzo (Nakamura\n&gt; Hanjiro)� , \n&gt; Hitokiri Izo, and another Hitokiri Hanzo. The first\n&gt; was Kirino \n&gt; Toshiaki of Satsuma, who changed his name, to that\n&gt; of the �gmain \n&gt; house�h (Kirino)when he became an officer in the new\n&gt; Army of Satsuma. \n&gt; He got the nickname as a young hot head in Kyoto\n&gt; where he is said to \n&gt; have cut down a man in a crowded street in broad\n&gt; daylight. The second \n&gt; was Okada Izo of Tosa, who killed several men in\n&gt; Kochi (maybe more in \n&gt; Kyoto)who were opposed to the initiatives of the\n&gt; Tosa loyalist party \n&gt; and Takechi Zuizan. A fictionalized version of his\n&gt; life can be seen \n&gt; in the film �gHitokiri�h starring Katsu Shin. The\n&gt; third seems to have \n&gt; been lost in the shadow of these other two, I find\n&gt; only brief mention \n&gt; of him.\n&gt; \tKawakami Gensai, I know as the man who killed\n&gt; Sakuma Shozan, \n&gt; but didn�ft know much else until I looked into him.\n&gt; He was indeed \n&gt; called �gHitokiri Gensai�h, though Sakuma is the\n&gt; only man we know for \n&gt; sure that he killed.\n&gt; \tHe was one of the major domo of the Hosokawa\n&gt; mansion in Edo, \n&gt; when four men fresh from the Sakurada mon-gai\n&gt; presented themselves at \n&gt; the door. The house was in a panic no one seemed to\n&gt; know what to do. \n&gt; Gensai however, took charge of the situation as soon\n&gt; as he was \n&gt; informed, calling for the doctor and seeing to their\n&gt; baths and \n&gt; clothing. Providing them with tea and every comfort,\n&gt; he expressed his \n&gt; admiration even as he notified the authorities as\n&gt; was his duty.\n&gt; \tA supporter of the Emperor his whole life he\n&gt; survived the \n&gt; Restoration, was a member of the Jinpuren and�\n&gt; rebelled against the \n&gt; new government in the Mei-yon jiken. Because he was\n&gt; something of a \n&gt; chatty cathy his fellow prisoners described him as\n&gt; �gfeminine�h, it \n&gt; was said that his reputation did not match his\n&gt; appearance. However he \n&gt; was quick to temper, he killed Sakuma based only on\n&gt; rumour, and \n&gt; resolute in his beliefs. The authorities knowing him\n&gt; to be a man of \n&gt; honor and education offered to pardon him if he\n&gt; would work with them \n&gt; but he refused. Kido himself said that if he were\n&gt; released he would \n&gt; cause trouble, so he was executed on his order, he\n&gt; was 38.\n&gt; \n&gt; �\n&gt; �And, purportedly kendo lost its flare and\n&gt; popularity immediately \n&gt; after the Meiji Restoration; how true is that?\n&gt; \n&gt; The short answer is it�fs true. With the triumph of\n&gt; western tactics \n&gt; and weapons over the Bakufu, the banning of swords\n&gt; as symbol of \n&gt; rank,and the suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion.\n&gt; The Japanese sword \n&gt; and its related arts seemed doomed to extinction.\n&gt; There are stories \n&gt; of sword teachers who simply walked off into the\n&gt; mountains never to \n&gt; be seen again.\n&gt; \tA whole lifestyle and whole industries seemed to be\n&gt; vanishing \n&gt; in the face of a crazed adoption of everything\n&gt; western. English was \n&gt; proposed as the official language, school girls had\n&gt; to wear the \n&gt; fashions popular in the capitols of Europe, Men cut\n&gt; off their \n&gt; topknots and many Buddhist temples, castles and\n&gt; other institutions \n&gt; were destroyed. It was a sad state of affairs.\n&gt; \tFukuzawa Yukichi who had once been the great\n&gt; reformer, now \n&gt; took the advice of European friends and advocated\n&gt; the preservation of \n&gt; traditional dress and custom. Much of the damage had\n&gt; already been \n&gt; done though. Japan seems to have gone thru this\n&gt; phase of accepting \n&gt; and then rejecting western influence several times\n&gt; after the \n&gt; Restoration. Kano Jigoro and others were part of the\n&gt; Japanese effort \n&gt; to preserve and spread the best of traditional\n&gt; Japanese culture. Thus \n&gt; we saw the birth of �gModern�h kendo after many of\n&gt; the teachers of \n&gt; the late Edo period had ceased to be.\n&gt; -t\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo!
