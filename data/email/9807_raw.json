Wether or not the story is true, I do not=\r\n know. \nBut could someone please help me out in finding its name. I believe=\r\n it \nhas a soul just like a katana and would like to honor it by calling th=\r\ne \nyumi by its name. thank you all very much. Also I have been \nresearching=\r\n for about three years now. The Yumi pictures are in the \nPhotos under Yumi=\r\n and Asano Family Clan Kimono.
