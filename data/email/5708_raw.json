Onimusha 3, and supposedly \nthe series closer).  Mitsuhide makes a brief appearance or two in this third \ngame and is mentioned in the first.  The BradyGames guide gives some actual \nhistorical background in the character bios section, but not enough to recommend \nit as a source.  In the games, though, Mitsuhide is referred to as Hidemitsu&#39;s \nuncle, instead of his brother (and hey, weren&#39;t they *cousins*?).  As I&#39;ve \nsaid before, though, don&#39;t knock it: it&#39;s what got me interested in this age in \nJapan&#39;s history.  Just my two senseless worth.  :-)  Take care.\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
