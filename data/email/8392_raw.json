Ushiwakamaru is \n&gt; the birth name of Yoshitsune Minamoto and Musashibo Benkei \n&gt; was a monk famous for his skill with the naginata. \n\nWas the birth name of Musashibo Benkei Oniwaka? And wasn&#39;t Ushiwakamaru\nShanou Yoshitsune or was it Yoshitsune Minamoto? If I am not mistaken, was\nthe event of Benkei&#39;s collecting swords at Gojo bridge after Heike clan\ndefeated Genji clan? And Yoshitsune was from Genji clan, and Benkei only\nconfiscated swords from the members of Heike clan.\n\nI also heard about this but not remember from where or who. I want to hear\nthe complete story from Japanese history masters of this group.\n\n\n\n\n"
