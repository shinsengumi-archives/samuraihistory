At the end of the \n&gt;Sengoku Period, Tokugawa Ieyasu usurped power from the other daimyo and was \n&gt;granted the status of Shogun. Whether their policies were good or bad, Ieyasu \n&gt;and his descendents reigned in an era of over 250 years of peace in Japan. \n&gt;The first few Tokugawa shoguns went to great lengths to insure their \n&gt;dominance over the other daimyo throughout Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Tokugawa strategically placed their allies in territories that could keep \n&gt;watch over other daimyo who weren&#39;t Tokugawa allies from the Battle of \n&gt;Sekigahara. They also forced all of the daimyo to spend half of their time in \n&gt;Edo (Tokyo) which helped the Tokugawa to keep a close watch over their \n&gt;activities. These pilgrimages back and forth between Edo and their home \n&gt;territories placed great financial burdens on the daimyo which was also a \n&gt;part of the Tokugawa master plan.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Tokugawa enforced strict social reforms too. They created a rigid caste \n&gt;system of samurai, peasants and merchants. The samurai were the only ones \n&gt;allowed to carry weapons and no one could change caste. They officially \n&gt;banned Christianity and closed Japan to the outside world. Only the Dutch and \n&gt;Chinese were allowed to trade with Japan and that was in a few closely \n&gt;monitored ports only. The Edo Period is also known as the sakoku jidai, the \n&gt;period of isolation.\n&gt;\n&gt;During the two and a half centuries of peace, merchants who were supposedly \n&gt;at the bottom of the caste system prospered while the samurai fell into ruin. \n&gt;Since there were no more wars the samurai could not hone their skills and \n&gt;over time they lost most of their once cherished abilities. Towards the end \n&gt;of the Edo Period, many samurai didn&#39;t even carry real swords anymore. Many \n&gt;unfulfilled samurai turned to the arts to occupy their time and the Edo \n&gt;period saw a flourishing of art unparalleled in Japanese history.\n&gt;\n&gt;Various internal and external influences led to an overthrow of the Tokugawa \n&gt;government in 1868.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;samurai_daimyo2003 &lt;samurai_daimyo2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;Hello All \n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m looking for information regarding to the Provinces of Japan \n&gt;during the Edo period.
