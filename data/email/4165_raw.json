Without going that extra\nlittle bit he could never have hoped to maintain any level of control over\nhis fellow Samurai - instead their disdain for his lower status would have\nlead to trouble - it was fear he used rather than terror as he targeted\nthose he felt opposed him rather than just indiscrimate killings which would\nhave made him a terrorist, instead he was no different to a hundred other\nrulers - and certainly not as bad as some.\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Oyakata [mailto:oyakata@...]\n  Sent: 07 April 2004 12:35\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 784\n\n\n  On Wed, 7 Apr 2004 07:13:09 +0100, Tristan Burke\u001b$B$5$s\u001b(B wrote in message\n&lt;JAEALPEFBIFABLHFNDJLIENOCKAA.football1st@...&gt;\n  &gt;i think he&#39;s getting his info from sources outside of Japan because I too\n  &gt;have read of children being scared by threats but I read it was Korean\n  &gt;children scared by stories of tokugawa - same as many middle eastern\n  &gt;countries still scare their kids with stories of the demon invader\n  &gt;(ALexander the great to westerners)\n\n  Just for the record let me add that I too have never heard of\n  Japanese mothers using Nobunaga as a bogeyman, to scare their kids\n  into good behavior.\n\n  &gt;as for the killings he did - well they were par for the course in those\ndays\n  &gt;you would be hard pressed to find any leaders around the world who didnt\ndo\n  &gt;these things without meaning it to be seen as horrific because they\nbelieved\n  &gt;differently from the way people do now.\n\n  This I think is overstating it a bit in the opposite direction. Seeing\n  Nobunaga as a &quot;demon&quot; and all of that is definitely a modern, and it\n  seems to me western, way to interpret what he accomplished. But even\n  contemporary and Japanese sources do agree that Nobunaga was\n  something fierce. The Hiei-zan incident in particular is pointed to\n  as being well over the top, but there are several others.\n\n  So I think it is fair to say that Nobunaga&#39;s methods were indeed\n  fearsome and from time to time were quite out of the norm even\n  within the context of the time period in Japan.\n\n  My own interpretation of it is that Nobunaga really did go further\n  than most people of the time. One the one hand, this could be seen\n  as &quot;terrorism&quot; or something similar by those people who can read\n  history only in the context of their own personal, modern\n  experiences. On the other hand, this willingness to do these kind\n  of deeds probably is a symptom of whatever it was that Nobunaga &quot;had&quot;\n  that allowed him to play the historical role that he did.\n\n  &gt;i believe he was just a man of his time who managed to rise above his\nlowly\n  &gt;start in the same way as Genghis Khan and is just seen through the eyes\nof a\n  &gt;modern man as a murderer, even though he wasnt at the time.\n\n  --\n  Jay Kelly\n  oyakata@...\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---\n\n\n        Yahoo!
