About a week \n&gt;since joining. Im very impressed with the group so far , Thanks for \n&gt;having me aboard. I have a living history society called the \n&gt;M.R.S.N.E.(Military Re-neactment Society of New England) one of our \n&gt;affiliated living history groups is called Daimyo of the Samurai . It \n&gt;is dedicated to the History, religion, and the way of the Samurai and \n&gt;will express its self during time line events in costume as Samurai \n&gt;and as the Samurai families. In the spring 2005 I plan to purchase a \n&gt;horse and complete a mounted Samurai impression to show off during \n&gt;time line event. Also along with the armor and weapons. I also have \n&gt;studied martial arts for the past 20 yrs in Kendo, kung fu and Tae \n&gt;Kwon Do. I am in the research phase now; to learn every thing I can \n&gt;about every aspect of the Samurai, This Yahoo group has already been \n&gt;a great help to me in so far as research. I will have many questions \n&gt;in the near future. \n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;Samurai\n&gt;Takara Tokugawa \n&gt;\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
