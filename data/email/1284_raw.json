I have been undertaking some research on this topic and it may, one day, see the light of day in a book!! However in the meantime......\n\nThere is an interesting chapter in Ivan Morris&#39; Book &quot; The Nobility of Failure&quot; (ISBN 0-03-010811-X) Pub. 1975 which covers the &quot;Japanese Messiah&quot; and aspects covering the Shimabara Rebellion.  It is also briefly mentioned in Stephen Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai Sourcebook&quot; under the Seige of Hara 1637-38 and several other of his works.\n\nThere are also some interesting articles to be found on the &quot;NET&quot; if you search for &quot;Amakusa Shiro&quot; (the messiah), Shimabara or Hara.\n\nGood luck with the hunt, I am sure you will find it an interesting topic.... the last full, true samurai campaign.\n \n                                            Rod Johnson\n \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: gabriel d gabaya \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, December 02, 2002 2:41 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] question....\n\n\n  Does anybody here have indepth knowledge about the Shimabara rebellion of 1637-38?  All I know is that Japanese Christians got fed up w/ the local tax collectors.\n\n  Thanks.\n\n  Gabs\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
