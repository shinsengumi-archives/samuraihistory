Haven&#39;t \nbothered to read anything else by Mishima, though. He should have had \nat least one of his books take place during the Sengoku, so at the \nvery least this post would be more applicable to the list ;)\n\n\n&gt; Exactly. He was a whacko writer (how can you read his\n&gt; books? The only one I could finish was Kinkakuji, and\n&gt; that was for a class) who acted more in a moral and\n&gt; artistic protest than an attempt to really overthrow\n&gt; the government or anything. That&#39;s very interesting\n&gt; about the seppuku...how it was botched and so forth.\n&gt; The movie about his live is very interesting, and he\n&gt; was actually acting in a play at one point where his\n&gt; character committed seppuku--I wonder how much he came\n&gt; to associate with that character. He was clearly\n&gt; mental, to say the least. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
