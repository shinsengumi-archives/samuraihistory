Tell me\nmore about your project.\n\nI&#39;m helping a group of people set up a web site for a highly detailed low\nfantasy RPG called Harn not so loosely based on earth (its a fan site. and\nnot put out by the comp. that created Harn). Unfortunately only 3 of over 50\nsections of the world have been published. We&#39;ve chosen one called Shoju\n(Japan) to develop.\n\nIn doing some research I&#39;ve determined that Harns time line correlates with\nearth at about the 10th to 12th century AD( the Kamakura period) and Shoju\nis known for its major naval presence in the area of this world. So I&#39;ve\nstarted to look about for any sources with very little luck until now.\n\nwhat I&#39;m looking for are types of ships, technology that might be different\nthat Europe at the time, or descriptions of the ships/boats ie. average\nlength/beam/depth/height or base # of masts or what is the gross burthen of\nsaid ship is etc.\n\nif some one has any pic&#39;s or art of ships of the time period to give me an\nidea of what working with. (I&#39;ll discard after my viewing them)\n\nI have very little to work with so if you can help please contact me\ndirectly at dbisaillon@...\n\nThanx\n\nJoel Bisaillon\n\n\n"
