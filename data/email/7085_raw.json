The think that I can=B4t =\r\nunderstand is how an offensive forist like Ledbetter could be &quot;moderator&quot;. =\r\n The function of the moderator is the &quot;moderation&quot;! he must be the equilibr=\r\nium in the relation of several people who share the same interests in a for=\r\num, ins=B4t?\n \nAnd by the way I=B4m not guilty for not speak english.  Is t=\r\nhe spanish a easy idiom to you?\nIn the Bujinkan the idiom is not really imp=\r\nortant (Thank=B4s God!)\n \nReally which is the problem with the black pijama=\r\ns? ( I dislike guys in black pijamas) is because they are for the world run=\r\nning and saying &quot;I=B4m a ninja... I=B4m a ninja!&quot; is for that?\n \nThis is li=\r\nke the guy who run for the world saying &quot;I=B4m a IO!... I=B4m IO!!!&quot;  the s=\r\name thing.\n \nI=B4m don=B4t know how are the things in your country but in m=\r\ny country if you say &quot;I=B4m a IO&quot; the consecuences coul be bad... here the =\r\nsituation is real.\n \n \nHelly Angel.\n \n \n \n\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@yahoo=\r\n.com&gt; escribi=F3:\n\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; HI \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; if you read what we said then you would not have\n&gt; posted your critism.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I did state that this was not anything like the\n&gt; hollywood version of=\r\n ninja\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul\n\nAnd if you&#39;ll read my reply, it was to Helly, not to\nyou-=\r\n-and was posted before yours was, so I couldn&#39;t\nhave read yours, now could =\r\nI? \n\nHowever, any connection with Hayes certainly SUGGESTS\nthat the researc=\r\nh is questionable, at best. I don&#39;t\nknow Helly--and I&#39;ve seen too many ninj=\r\na fanatics here\nto accept his say-so that this is legit. Forgive me,\nbut wi=\r\nth a connection to Hayes it&#39;s guilty until\nproven innocent. I didn&#39;t reply =\r\nto you in the same\nmanner, as you&#39;ve been around on the board, post\nintelli=\r\ngently, and don&#39;t strike me as the &quot;wannabe&quot;\nninja type. If you&#39;re endorsin=\r\ng this, then fine--I&#39;ll\nfully admit there is a chance it&#39;s not crap, but\nag=\r\nain, any connection with Hayes makes it doubtful, at\nleast until I see it. =\r\nToo many documentaries simply\ntry to capitalize on the hype (exhibit a-n: a=\r\nny\ndocumentary made during the &quot;Last Samurai&quot; hype)\nwithout doing any real =\r\nresearch. \n\n\n\n\n            \nYahoo!
