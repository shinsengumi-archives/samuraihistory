I have seen some that are very intricate. \n\nNot as far as I know, but they may have acquired meanings during or post\nthe Edo era, as so many things have done. But I could be wrong.\n\n&gt;Also in some Japanese prints I see mounted samurai wearing a large \n&gt;ring over their sword. What is it for?\n\nThis device is the &quot;tsurumaki&quot; or &quot;bow-string wrap&quot;. It&#39;s used for\ncarrying a spare string for the bow. It is made with a deep channel\n(circa 30mm deep) around the outer edge, so the string can be wrapped\nwithin the trench and be protected by it. This is done because the tsuru\nis coated in resin which means that you can&#39;t just stuff it away in a\npouch/pocket without it being possibly damaged. The resin which is to\nsome degree still fluid, flows away from creases, and you have to wipe\nthe crease smooth again before using it. And you really don&#39;t want to be\ndoing this in the middle of a battle! Tsurumaki can be made of rattan\n(split vine), wood, or lacquered paper. They are normally suspended by a\nstrip of printed leather or other textile, from the obi (when worn with\na katana), or from the sword&#39;s waist cord (forgotten the name) in the\ncase of a tachi. Go here to see a couple of modern made rattan tsurumaki\nas used in kyudo for a close up view:\n\nhttp://www.coara.or.jp/~lucyfer/kyugu/accessories/tsurumaki33-e.html\n\nHope this is useful.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\n\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
