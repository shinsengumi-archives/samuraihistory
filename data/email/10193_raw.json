Most wounds were deep cuts. Some were bullet wounds by the=\r\n rifles provided by the Portuguese. Not much was written about that as far =\r\nas I know. As for the dead bodies, they were burned to=C2=A0stop the spread=\r\n of disease and as an act of respect for the fallen warriors. For those who=\r\n were highly sought after, a reward for that certain Samurai&#39;s head was off=\r\nered by the Diamyo of his enemy. It had to be a fresh kill. Decomposition m=\r\nade identifying the face difficult. \n\nI have studied the history of the Sam=\r\nurai not only because it is fascinating but because I am from Samurai blood=\r\nlines. Specifically the Harubiyuna. Thier kamon is two arrow feathers insid=\r\ne a circle. One pointing upwards, and one downwards. I find myself both luc=\r\nky and honored to be the descendant of Samurai. It&#39;s truly something to be =\r\nproud of. Not for anything I have done but to be linked to such a rich hist=\r\nory as the Samurai. I am half American, half Japanese. \n=C2=A0\nGood luck in=\r\n your writing! I look forward to reading it!

But as=\r\n a practical matter, men wounded in battle had to be treated. Willingness t=\r\no die notwithstanding, a dead samurai (or ashigaru) is worth less to his ma=\r\nster than a living one. As I understand it, seppuku was reserved for hopele=\r\nss situations, where the only other option was capture or abject failure (t=\r\nhe death of one&#39;s daimyo, say). \n\nI imagine that battlefield medicine was v=\r\nery catch-as-catch-can and based as much on Chinese medicine as was practic=\r\nal, but still, the more specifics I can get, the better off I&#39;ll be. Ditto =\r\ninfo regarding disposal of the dead after mass-casualty events.\n\nAnd lest a=\r\nnyone think I&#39;m some sort of poseur, I will say that I am an Active member =\r\nof the Horror Writers Association (that is, a member considered to have pro=\r\nfessional credentials) with a couple dozen published short stories to my na=\r\nme.

A Samurai who knows that he may not surv=\r\nive it shall be victorious.&quot; Something along those lines.\n\nA true Samurai d=\r\noes not fear death but embraces it in the face of his opponent! For it is a=\r\nn honor to die in battle than to run like a coward! Those who have shamed h=\r\nis clan are expected to commit Harikiri or sepuku! Suicide by his own Tanto=\r\n. To save his and his family&#39;s honor! If he is lucky, he will have a &quot;Kaish=\r\naku&quot;. A close friend or family member to cut off his head with a Katana to =\r\nend the painful death by disembowelment. It was considered &quot;humane&quot; ironica=\r\nlly!\n\nFor the Samurai, death is expected of him. Not failure, but death was=\r\n thier way of life. They dont glorify death, but accept it as a part of thi=\r\ner duty and honor. Of course they expect to be victorious in battle always!=\r\n But they also accept death as a part of that victory!\n\nAs for medicine, if=\r\n a Samurai was not mortally wounded, I heard they used salt to stop the ble=\r\neding. A very painful but effective method. A Samurai is also trained to be=\r\nar the most extreme pain. \n\nHope this helps!\n\nJohn\n\n--- On Thu, 6/24/10, Ce=\r\narb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt;\nSub=\r\nject: Re: [samuraihistory] Battlefield medicine\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogro=\r\nups.com\nDate: Thursday, June 24, 2010, 1:59 PM\n\nMina-san, Konnichiwa!\n\nWond=\r\nering if anyone can recommend any good resources or has particular knowledg=\r\ne of battlefield medicine from around the early Warring States period.
