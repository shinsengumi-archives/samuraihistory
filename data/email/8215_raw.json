They became \nsplit to allow=\r\n samurai to wear them while on horseback.  \n   The thing with the foot move=\r\nments may be one reason that hakama \nwere adopted by many of the martial ar=\r\nts like kendo - rather than, \nfor example, sumo.  \n   The horseback explana=\r\ntion makes sense to me because hakama were \nnot originally split like pants=\r\n.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@y...&gt; \nwrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:  --- ROD PAVEZ \n&lt;grfkboyz=\r\n@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The hakama was designed to hide the foot movements\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n of the samurai so that an opponent could not see\n&gt; &gt; them and predict the =\r\noutcome of an attack so easily.\n&gt; &gt; That is all I know of their style choic=\r\ne it was more\n&gt; &gt; practical than aesthetic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rod, where did you get thi=\r\ns from? I&#39;m a little\n&gt; skeptical--it sounds like something out of Martial\n&gt;=\r\n Arts Illustrated or something. Most images of samurai\n&gt; you see preparing =\r\nfor a battle or a duel have their\n&gt; hakama tied back with leggings to keep =\r\nthem out of the\n&gt; way (assuming they aren&#39;t in armor, which would keep\n&gt; th=\r\ne clothing out of the way by definition.) Kobakama,\n&gt; or shorter, tighter h=\r\nakama, were frequently worn when\n&gt; &quot;expecting action&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Were hakama wo=\r\nrn exclusively by the samurai class,\n&gt; then maybe I could see your answer m=\r\naking sense. But\n&gt; how would that explain nagabakama, worn by courtiers\n&gt; a=\r\nnd samurai during court functions? I&#39;m no clothing\n&gt; historian, but I know =\r\nwe&#39;ve got some here. Tony? Lady\n&gt; Solveig? Care to enlighten us further? \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Of course, I could just look at Tony&#39;s website: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.sengok=\r\nudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hakama worn by commoners and laborers in H=\r\neian were\n&gt; two panel, and typically only reached to the mid-calf\n&gt; or a bi=\r\nt lower. During the sixteenth century,\n&gt; low-class warriors often wore a kn=\r\nee-length two- or\n&gt; three-panel hakama which were sometimes called\n&gt; kobaka=\r\nma, a terminology problem as regular hakama were\n&gt; also called kobakama in =\r\nthe Edo period owing to the\n&gt; formal nagabakama being the &quot;formal=81Enorm.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If hakama were being worn by commoners and laborers,\n&gt; then I hardly =\r\nthink a critical part of their design\n&gt; would be to hide the movement of th=\r\ne legs from an\n&gt; opponent. \n&gt; \n&gt; Continuing: \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Earlier hakama, unlike =\r\nmodern martial arts hakama,\n&gt; had two clearly defined legs, rather than hav=\r\ning the\n&gt; pleats overlapping left and right so that one can&#39;t\n&gt; tell where =\r\none leg ends and the other begins. Another\n&gt; modern feature is the koshita,=\r\n the solid panel at the\n&gt; small of the back. This seems to have appeared\n&gt; =\r\nsometime in the early Edo period or at the earliest in\n&gt; the very late days=\r\n of the sixteenth century, as\n&gt; earlier hakama were merely cut straight acr=\r\noss the\n&gt; back as at the front.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If these things were developed in the=\r\n Edo period, and\n&gt; hakama were being worn in the Heian period, then they\n&gt; =\r\ncould hardly be part of the development of hakama. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d still like to =\r\nsee what Tony and others have to\n&gt; say. \n&gt; \n&gt; _____________________________=\r\n_____________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
