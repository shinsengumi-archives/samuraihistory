The site I was \ninterested in making would be more to do with the coolness of the \nhats the style the function the history as well.  But I wanted \nsomething that shows the coolness of the Japanese as well as the \nhistory.  I like the basket hats and the peasant hats, the monsho \nused on them, the purpose of hats disguise,anoniymaty, use in snow, \netc.  Ever since I spoke to someone here in England who kept telling \nme all the historical facts, it was good at first but I admit part of \nthe reason I like Japanese society is because it is distinctive, \ncool, strange, fascinating, (isn&#39;t that the same with us all anyway)  \nnot just because Oda Nobunaga was apparently assasinated by his own \nretainer, although things like that are interesting.  Like you I \nreally wanted to get into the heart of the matter.  Like Hiroshiges \npaintings and other things of people in hats.  So soon when my site \nis up people can judge for themselves what the Bushi were like and \nhow the society was through it&#39;s hats. A bit odd but I like the hats \nvery much.  A historian should not be a man who just looks at history \ndo you agree? \n\nAll the best Mark  \n\n\n"
