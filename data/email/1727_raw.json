The phone number of the International Affairs Office is 0839 25 7116 - they should be able to put you on to the bookshop.\n\nThere is quite a good website on Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japanese and English \n\nhttp://www.oidemase.or.jp\n\nwith several references to the Ouchi. Again, this may not be in the depth you are looking for.\n\nI&#39;ve seen maps of Hagi from the late 18th and mid 19th century, but nothing earlier. I&#39;ve got a (not very good) photo of one from about 1850, from the Takasugi Shinsaku museum near Shimonoseki.\n\nI was in Yamaguchi prefecture for three months last year and spent quite a lot of time in both Hagi and Yamaguchi, visiting some of the Ouchi sites, but my main interest was in the bakumatsu period. But if you want any other information about the landscape, seasons etc, let me know.\n\nThe Ouchi are a fascinating clan and Yamaguchi in their era must have been a vibrant and interesting place.\n\nGillian\n\n"
