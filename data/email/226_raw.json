I have also seen an \nolder book entitled &#39;Life in Japan...during the samurai eras&#39; but cannot \nremember the author. (Give me a couple of days and I can find out for you..) \nAlso the &#39;Hojoki&#39; or &#39;An account of my hut&#39; by Kamo no Chomei describes a \nmore general account of the times covering the Gempei wars and after, \nfocussing more on the general populace rather than the Samurai and the \neffects that the natural disasters of the time brought about. There are \nundoubtedly more than these but the titles above would give a good general \noverview for you...Good Luck.\n\n"
