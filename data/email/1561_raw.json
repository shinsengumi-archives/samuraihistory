The most \nnotable one of recent memory is Raisa Gorbacheva, who, when appearing in \npublic with Mikhail Gorbachev, ALWAYS walked a step back of him, and very \nrarely was seen even standing level with him.  I&#39;m guessing it was (and may \nstill be) a show of deference for whatever his position is -- even if the \nsociety (in whatever way) dictates (or the man himself dictates, whichever \nthe case may be) that simply his being a MAN makes him worthy of walking the \nstep ahead.  (Although I would hope that of the two, it is the first rather \nthan the second.  The first is undesirable and avoided not without a great \ndeal of difficulty.  The second, though, is insufferable and avoidable.)  \nAlthough, I must say, tsukiyo&#39;s notion is at the VERY least, romantic and \nVERY laudable that a man would want to protect his lady like that.  Although, \nI would hope that he would only step the step ahead in the case that it were \nnecessary, and the rest of the time he was with her, that they&#39;d walk \neven-up.  That&#39;s about it.\n\nLater.\nT\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
