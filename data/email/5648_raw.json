The Code of Bushido, which was a set of ten ideals for samurai set down for all with a sword to follow. I think they were given to someone by one of the Kami or gods/goddesses, but I can&#39;t quite remember the specifics. Go ahead and e-mail me if you need any more specifics on the subject. I spent a past life during some of feudal japan, and was alive during Sekigahara.\n \nAmerican Oni ^_^\n\nDave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt; wrote:\nHi Jeff,\nthere were many different laws in many different places, it would depend on the time period as well as the diamyo. Although not laws if I had to choose two things that were expected of a samurai in all places and times it would be, obedience and loyalty these things were core to what a samurai should be, the word samurai even means &quot;to serve&quot;.\nDave\n\nP.S. Even though a ronin had no lord to serve and be loyal and obiedient to this did not make him any less of a samurai.\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: jeff \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, October 01, 2004 7:37 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] laws of samurai\n\n\n  hello im doing a project i need to know two laws of a samurai could \n  anyone help\n\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
