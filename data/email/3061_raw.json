I liked it,\nbut unlike when I watch Hideyoshi or Nobunaga or Aoi\nSandai, for example, I&#39;m not all that familiar with\nthe story. Any recommendations (in English, if\npossible...I&#39;ve got my fill translating military\ndocuments for the moment) of books to check out that\ncan give me a roadmap here? I&#39;m vaguely familiar with\nSakamoto Ryoma from history class, but was a little\nconfused with Kondo Isami and the guy he was chasing\nin the beginning of the show, but apparently was\nfriends with 10 years before (when they flashed\nback--William Letham, I know you watched it last\nnight, help with his name??). \n\nThanks for the assitance--I was surprised a little\nwith Katori Shingo&#39;s performance (good, so far) and of\ncourse as it has Sawaguchi Yasuko in it, I&#39;m happy.\nAnother question for William--is the woman playing\nKondo Isami&#39;s mother the same woman who was\nMitsuhide&#39;s mother in &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;?? Sokkuri but I\ncouldn&#39;t catch the name. \n\nSpeaking of Hideyoshi, Kitsuno, I see you&#39;ve got\nIshikawa Goemon as the Samurai of the Month on the\nwebsite--I just watched the episode where he gets\nboiled in oil...a little different than the\ndescription you&#39;ve got, eh?\n\nThanks all!\n\nMata!\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
