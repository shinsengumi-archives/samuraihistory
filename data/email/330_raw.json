My question is just what else can we do in Britain \nto aid the U.S. at this time? We are sending Blood, firemen, police, and \nothers with knowledge of how to help in the aftermath of a bomb strike  \n(terrorist activity), our Prime Minister has declared that we will stand \nfirmly behind any plans the U.S. has to seek &#39;vengeance&#39; on the guilty party \nhere...But as a country we are no where near rich enough to supply the \namounts that are needed to truly help. We are doing all that we can to aid \nthe States at this time but could never supply aid equal to that given by the \nU.S. and others in the Second World War. Here is the point...The U.S. has \nalways been looked upon as the &#39;saviour of the free world&#39;, a kind of &#39;big \nbrother&#39; with the power to help in nearly all situations. Some may say that \nit is that level of involvement that has made the U.S. the target for the \nterrorist parties. My heart truly goes out to all involved in this atrocity, \n(see my previous post) But the implication in the article is that we are \nstanding idly by while the U.S. is attacked. This cannot be farther from the \ntruth. If the point of the e-mail was to show the stupidity of some reporters \non the case then my points should be disregarded, sorry. But the world does \nnot need any more rift building and division, blame, or guilt than is already \npresent. Articles like this sow discord and in my opinion should not be \nposted on an international forum like this one. We need to join together if \nthere is any hope in finding and dealing with the guilty here....We cannot \neasily do this if people continually lay the guilt for it on countries that \nare genuinly trying to help clear up the situation. Please, take care with \nthe articles allowed to be shown here. It is not the U.S. against the world, \nbut the world against the mindless scum willing to commit these attacks.\n Sorry if I cause offense here...That is not my intention. Once again, my \nheartfelt condolences goes to all those who have suffered as a result of this.\nNAMU AMIDA BUTSU.\nBen Sharples\nfifthchamber@...\n\n"
