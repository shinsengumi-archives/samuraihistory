She refused and he apparently relented.    She \nwas known for her great\nintelligence, learning and beauty.   She was described by the Jesuits as \nfluent in Latin and\nPortuguese and of extraordinary piety.  \n\nThere is an account of her death in Sadler&#39;s &quot;The Maker of Modern \nJapan.&quot;  In brief, it says that\none of Hosokawa&#39;s retainers killed Gracia to prevent her from being \ntaken hostage by the\nToyotomi forces prior to the Sekigahara campaign.  \n\nAlthough James Clavell used her as the model for Toda Mariko,  there is \nno record of\nGracia having met Will Adams, much less having an affair with him.   \nUnfortunately there\nis little information about her available outside of Japan.   She was at \nleast as interesting\nas the many famous men of that period.\n\n\ngabriel d gabaya wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;James Clavell acknowledged that Will Adams was the model for Blackthorne\n&gt; &gt;on several occasions.\n&gt; &gt;Although he clearly took many liberties with history in order to make\n&gt; &gt;for a more popular novel,\n&gt; &gt;especially the romance between Blackthorne and Toda Mariko (modelled on\n&gt; &gt;Hosokawa Gracia),\n&gt;\n&gt; Tell me more about Hosokawa Gracia if you may?  Does she also hold \n&gt; samurai rank?\n&gt;\n&gt; Gabs\n&gt; &gt;there can be no doubt that Blackthorne is Adams, plus a generous dollop\n&gt; &gt;of Clavell and a dash\n&gt; &gt;of Sean Connery to flavor the mix (Clavell wanted Connery to play\n&gt; &gt;Blatckthorne in the movie version).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Jesuits were implacably hostile to Adams and his co-religionists and\n&gt; &gt;never missed a chance\n&gt; &gt;to abuse them as pirates to Ieyasu and other Japanese authorities.  \n&gt; &gt;Adams probably returned\n&gt; &gt;the favor, although suspicion of the Jesuits and European colonial\n&gt; &gt;amibitions was prevalent among\n&gt; &gt;the Japanese military hierarchy,  going back to Hideyoshi and Nobunaga.\n&gt; &gt;  Far from being\n&gt; &gt;paranoid, these suspicions were grounded on genuine concerns and some\n&gt; &gt;knowledge of how\n&gt; &gt;the Spaniards had colonized many parts of the new world using religion\n&gt; &gt;as an advance guard for\n&gt; &gt;military conquest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jan Joosten Lodensteyn was a Dutch contemporary of Adams who also became\n&gt; &gt;a favorite\n&gt; &gt;of Ieyasu.   It is not clear if he achieved samurai status, but he\n&gt; &gt;apparently had the right of\n&gt; &gt;audience with Ieyasu, a right normally granted only to daimyo and\n&gt; &gt;hatamoto samurai.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt;samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
