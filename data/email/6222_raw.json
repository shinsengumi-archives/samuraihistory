These\ncouple of digressions (caravelles, Dracula, Orthodoxy)\nhave been within tolerance, for the most part--I\ncertainly can&#39;t complain, since I&#39;ve been known to\ndigress about tanks, the US Cavalry, and Iijima Ai. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
