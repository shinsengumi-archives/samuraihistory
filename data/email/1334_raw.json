Ito\nhimself was a student of Katakura Kojuro  - Note the\nsame surname katakura. To make the connection even\ncloser is Katakura Kojuro was a samurai from oshu.\nTakagi himself was from Tohoku Shiraishi in Oshu. all\nof this is taking place 1600 - 1625 - present. Kojuro\nwas possibly the aimyo of the Tohoku Shirashi domain.\n\nDate Masamune and Katakura Kagatsune were also from\nOshu.\n\nSo now heres my questions\n\nAs the time period for the katakura conncted to Takagi\nis the same as that conected with Date Masamune, does\nanyone know if Katakura Kojuro and Kagetsune are\nrelated. \n\nOr - where could I go to find out.\n\nany and all help as always much appreciated\n\n\n\n=====\nPaul Richardson \n8th Dan - Shidoshi (Bujinkan Lincoln Dojo UK)\nwww.hanako.co.uk\nHanako - Newsletter editor\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
