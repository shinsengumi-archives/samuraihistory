He installed Ashikaga Yoshiaki, brother of the murdered Shogun \n&gt;Ashikaga Yoshiteru, in 1568, only to depose him in the early 1570s. Therefore \n&gt;between then and the victory of Tokugawa Ieyasu there were no Shogun.\n\nA question I can not seem to answer for my self is this: was Yoshiaki \nwas in fact still the official Shogun until his death in the 1590s \n(1592 I believe off the top of my head)? It&#39;s said that 1573 \nrepresents the end of the Muromachi Bakufu, but I&#39;ve always noticed \nthat Yoshiaki is allowed to stay alive. I have not been able to find \nout for sure but as far as I can tell the Emperor did not rescind the \noffice of Shogun. If Yoshiaki still was Shogun even if in name only, \nNobunaga would have had to have waited until at least the 1590s (and \nof course it&#39;s a requirement that Honnoji didn&#39;t end up happening). Or \nhe would have had to out and out kill Yoshiaki - which I don&#39;t think \nwould have happened.\n\nAnother factor is that Nobunaga had set him self up as being a \ndescendant of the Taira family. There is a common opinion that \nthere was no way that a Taira was going to be made Shogun instead of s\nomeone of the Minamoto (which is why Hideyoshi wanted to be adopted an\nd why Ieyasu changed his name). This same sentiment would have \napplied to Nobunaga as well.\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n"
