From \nwhat I&#39;ve seen and heard, a terrorist usually works outside the law, working to \nbreak it and create chaos.  Oda Nobunaga did no such thing.  He had the \nsanction of Ogimachi, I believe, from about 1562.  He deposed the last Ashikaga \nshogun, and was the first of what I&#39;ve seen called the &quot;three unifiers.&quot;  As for \nworking outside the law, he essentially WAS the law, as seen, and noted by \nothers in the group, through his repression of real or perceived threats and the \naforementioned deposition of Ashikaga   Yoshiaki.  There was no bigger bully on \nthe Sengoku block than Nobunaga, from Okehazama to Honnoji.  Shingen and \nKenshin it seems were little more than a sidenote (even if the largest of them) to \nthe Oda drive and wasn&#39;t one in some sort of alliance or another with the Oda \nanyway?\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
