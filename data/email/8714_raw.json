In my sociology undergraduate days I found Dirkheim&#39;s &quot;Le\nSuicide&quot; a stimulating read, having already read much about seppuku.  Seeing\nyour post I recalled a fragment of memory that said Roman soldiers also\ncommitted suicide in a similar way to Samurai.  I went looking for some evidence\nin google with &quot;roman soldier suicide&quot; (no quotes), and whilst not finding any\nevidence I have spent the last couple of hours reading Roman history!  One of\nthe links (we come to the point) comprised essays in three parts with the title\n&quot;Suicide in a cultural history perspective&quot;.  Part 3 deals with other cultures.\nThe essays begin here:\nhttp://www.med.uio.no/ipsy/ssff/engelsk/menuculture/Retterstol1.htm\n\nPart 3 dealing with other cultures is here:\nhttp://www.med.uio.no/ipsy/ssff/engelsk/menuculture/Retterstol3.htm\n\nThe text concerning Japanese culture is short and I doubt that it offers you\nanything new, but others may be interested in the general reading.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;jonathan ellgen&quot; &lt;jpellgen@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, April 01, 2006 9:04 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Opinions on seppuku for my graduate thesis\n\n\nAs I continue to put together my graduate thesis, I just wanted to get  some\nfeedback from everyone. I have done alot of writing and revising,  but Im still\nsearching for that one sentence that puts everything  together for me. I know\nwhat I want to say, but sometimes it&#39;s hard to  put those things into writing. I\nthink asking this question will spark  something for me, as I know there are\nseveral informed and educated  people in this group who know far more than I.\n\n  In your opinion, were there differences in the philosophy of seppuku  during\nthe reign of the Tokugawa as opposed to the period of time  leading up to the\nTokugawa period? If so, what were they?\n\n  For me, the first thing that comes to mind is the lack of widespread  warfare\nduring the Tokugawa reign. This alters the significance of  seppuku during this\nperiod, in my opinion.\n\n  Your ideas and input would be grately appreciated.\n\n  Jonathan\n\n\n\n\n"
