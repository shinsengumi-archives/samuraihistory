With this huge pool of resources, and the decision during the tenure of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu to allow the hereditary holding of the post of Shugo. Pronounced &#39;taimai&#39; in the 14th Century, these figures with their local networks of warriors and landholders/workers (admittedly not necessarily exclusive groups), emerged as what are called by historians &#39;shugo-daimyo&#39;; a precursor/forbear to the Sengokudaimyo, and the later daimyo of the Edojidai.\nM.Lorimer\n\nrjuri &lt;rjuri@...&gt; wrote:\nThanks a lot by this quick mending of my mistake.\nThis information raises a question of my own. When the daimyos took \nthis name for them, or whoever that chose it, they were thinking in \nthat figure of the 11th century? Or was just the &quot;great name&quot; thing?\n(Sorry if that thing was discussed earlier).\n\nRodrigo Juri A.\n\nPS: I erased the former messages in order to limit the extension of \nthe post.

When the myoshu moved on to \nacquire more fields they became &#39;daimyo&#39; (literally &#39;great name&#39;). \nTheir duties included collecting dues for their lord, but by the late \n11th Century, many were making the rural situation even more \ncomplicated by placing their land under the indirect supervision of a \ndistant lord (eg; a Fujiwara noble or one of the larger Kenmon \ntemples).  These myoshu/daimyo were the foundations of the latter \njizamurai/ kokujin (basically the lower echelons of the military \nclass). \n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; \nhave been removed]\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
