I seem to vaguely r=\r\nemember\nEiko Ikegami mentioning it briefly in the introduction to &#39;Taming o=\r\nf the\nSamurai&#39;, which I&#39;ll check when I get home. I had thought that prior =\r\nto\nthe Tokugawa Bakufu bushi was the preferred term, where as during the\nEd=\r\no period the preferred term was samurai, as &#39;one who serves&#39; was a\nperhaps =\r\nmore the image the Bakufu was looking to promote than &#39;warrior&#39;.\n&#39;Samurai&#39; =\r\nseems to carry more prestige with it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever\nread anything=\r\n suggesting that though.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Gillian Rubinste=\r\nin [mailto:gillian@...] \nSent: Wednesday, 9 March 2005 9:=\r\n38 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Tale=\r\ns of the Taira Clan\n\n\n\nI watched this movie last night. Can anyone tell me =\r\nwhat Kiyomori&#39;s \nparents address him as? It sounds like Heita: is this a ti=\r\ntle (eldest\nson??) \nor a family name?\n\nIncidentally, with reference to a co=\r\nuple of other threads, the word used\n\nin this film for clan is &quot;ichimon&quot; an=\r\nd what is translated in the\nsubtitles \nas &quot;samurai&quot; seems to be invariably =\r\n&quot;bushi.&quot;\n\nI thought Kurosawa might have been responsible for popularising \n=\r\nsamurai as a word in the West, but in fact the early writers like Satow \nan=\r\nd Mitford (1870s) all use it as a term for the daimyo&#39;s retainers, and\n\nalr=\r\neady seem to invest it with a great deal of romantic feeling (see \nTales of=\r\n Old Japan and A Diplomat in Japan) which they presumably \npicked up from c=\r\nontemporary Japanese. I don&#39;t know enough about \nEdo period to know how the=\r\n two words were used then and what \ndifference there was. Does anyone have =\r\nany ideas?\n\nThanks,\n\nGillian \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; =\r\nCelebrate Yahoo!&#39;s 10th Birthday! \n&gt; Yahoo!
