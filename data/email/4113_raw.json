He=\r\n set himself (through ambition or just sheer consequence), and eventually J=\r\napan upon the route to unification. His control was far more effectual than=\r\n that imposed four centuries earlier by either Taira no Kiyomori or Minamot=\r\no no Yoritomo, but like these earlier examples, his control was only over t=\r\nhe central island of Honshu, not Kyushu, Shikoku, Chugoku (although that wa=\r\ns under way at the time of his death), Tohoku or Hokkaido. Although more si=\r\ngnificant than Toyotomi Hideyoshi in what he established, it is Hideyoshi w=\r\nho brought the bulk of the archipelago under a central administration and w=\r\nas e facto unifier, although it was Nobunaga or set the work in motion and =\r\nundertook much of the hard labour (smashing the Ikko ikki, the Enryakuji, t=\r\nhe Imagawa, the Takeda, &c) that made the work of Toyotomi and the Tokugawa=\r\n considerably easier. \nM.Lorimer\n\nOyakata &lt;oyakata@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\nKitsuno=A4=B5=A4=F3=A4=CE&lt;c4prc9+39l6@...&gt;=A4=AB=A4=E9\n&gt;Well, since=\r\n a concequence of his actions led to more and more \n&gt;territory falling unde=\r\nr his control, I think by default Nobunaga is \n&gt;a &#39;unifier&#39;...\n&gt;\nIt&#39;s proba=\r\nbly right to say that he was &quot;a&quot; unifyer, since he took seve\nral regions th=\r\nat had been under the control of various people and \nunified them under his=\r\n control.\n\nBut sometimes Nobunaga is referred to as &quot;the&quot; unifier implying =\r\nthat \nhe succeeded in pulling all of Japan under his rule. Clearly that \nwa=\r\ns not the case.\n\nSo he&#39;s &quot;a&quot; unifier in terms of what he accomplished, but =\r\nhe is not \n&quot;the&quot; unifier of Sengoku Japan.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n--\nJay K=\r\nelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-arc=\r\nhives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n=\r\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
