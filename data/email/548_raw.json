Try www.koryu.com and when you get there visit the Ryu list they have (under &#39;schools&#39; heading)..Take a look at the &#39;Kage Ryu&#39; write up and in particular the photos and sited they have. There are excellent photos of the previous head of the school with his Tachi that is easily as tall as he is.. The Tsuka is about the length of my arm!\n Abayo.\n Ben Sharples \n\n"
