Same with the Fujiwara--Toyotomi Hideyoshi\n&gt; had to arrange to be adopted by a Fujiwara nobleman,\nto give legitimacy to his title of Kampaku. Tokugawa\nIeyasu had several family tree charts drawn up to\nsupport claims of descent from either the Minamoto,\nTaira, or Fujiwara, as the situation\n&gt; dictated--everyone is taught that the Tokugawa were\n&gt; descended from the Minamoto because that was state\n&gt; orthodoxy for 200 years, to legitamize the Tokugawa\n&gt; bakufu. \n\nSorry, realized I needed to clarify the above point.\nHideyoshi couldn&#39;t simply have been &quot;named&quot; a Fujiwara\nor Minamoto or whatever--he had to contrive a scenario\nwhere he legitimately became one. It wasn&#39;t the\nEmperor who made him a &quot;Fujiwara&quot;, it was his adoption\ninto the family. Similarly, nobody could &quot;make&quot; Ieyasu\na Minamoto--he had to concoct a family history that\n&quot;proved&quot; he was one by birth, whether it was true or\nnot. Both were fairly inventive about how they did it,\nin my opinion.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
