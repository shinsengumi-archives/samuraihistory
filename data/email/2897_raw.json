I am very proud of my Scots heritage,  if for nothing than the \nDeclaration of Arbroath, the world&#39;s first declaration of Independence.  In part \nit reads: &quot;we  fight for freedom,  which no good man surrenders but with his \nlife.&quot;  (After 300 years of fighting for Freedom, you would think my family \nwould have had enough!)   Anyhow,  the main weakness of the katana is that,  with \na two-handed haft (hold),  the samurai was perilously exposed under his arm \npits for a thrust.  This was a defect in Japanese armor never fully remedied, \nwhile European knights had chain mail to cover that area by 1000 AD.  The \nclaymore broadsword,  however,  was used with one hand,  the other side protected \nby a  target (the original of the name, and hence the round  &#39;&#39;&#39;target&#39;&#39;&#39; for \nshooters later), or shield.   Shields,  at least to my knowledge,  never \nappeared in samurai warfighting.  In the early battles of the Rising of 1745, the \nHighlanders of Bonnie Prince Charlie terrified the British  &quot;&quot;sojers&#39;&#39;&#39; with \ntheir claymores, amputating heads and limbs at will--as did katanas.  Having \nboth,  the claymore is a much heavier weapon with a wide straight blade,  always \nat least 36 inches long.   The width is never less than one inch. The hand \nguard is solid brass--the origin of the  &#39;&#39;brass knuckle.&quot;   It was not until \nCulloden in April 1746,  the final battle, that British soldiers, trained by  &quot;The \nButcher,&quot;  the Duke of Cumberland,  learned to best the Highlanders.  The  \nredcoat would lunge with his bayonet--if memory serves--at the kiltie laddie to \nhis left, getting him in the exposed right side and arm pit as he raised his \nsword at the soldier on the soldier&#39;s left.  A chara dhil,  Jack M.  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
