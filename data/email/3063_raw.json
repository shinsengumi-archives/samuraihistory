Any recommendations (in English, if\npossible...I&#39;ve got my fill translating military\ndocuments for the moment) of books to check out that\ncan give me a roadmap here? I&#39;m vaguely familiar with\nSakamoto Ryoma from history class, but was a little\nconfused with Kondo Isami and the guy he was chasing\nin the beginning of the show, but apparently was\nfriends with 10 years before (when they flashed\nback--William Letham, I know you watched it last\nnight, help with his name??). &quot;\n\nHis name was Kastura Kogoro\n\nFor a synopsis of the first few episodes try here\nhttp://www.nhk-jn.co.jp/wp/best_e.htm\n\nFor books on the era try\nBeasley The Meiji Restoration\nTotman The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu\nJansen Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration\nThomas Huber The Revolutionary Origins of Modern Japan\n\nIn addition you might try two of Romulos Hillsborough&#39;s books, Ryoma,\nSamurai Sketches. They are not particularly well written by they have a lot\nof good info.\n\nYou might also try one of the series guides that are in the bookstores.\nParticularly the official NHK one (with Kondo Isami/Shigo-kun on the cover)\nThey have pix of all the stars and the characters they play. Thankfully this\none is done in hiragana, better to read.\n\n&quot;Another question for William--is the woman playing\nKondo Isami&#39;s mother the same woman who was\nMitsuhide&#39;s mother in &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;?? Sokkuri but I\ncouldn&#39;t catch the name. &quot;\n\nYes that&#39;s right. Her name is Nogiwa Yoko\n\nBy the way do you have access to cable or skyperfect yet. The first episode\nof Nobunaga was repeated on Saturday; Onna Taiko-ki will be in February and\nTokugawa Ieyasu will start in march!!!!!\n\n\n"
