Different parts of the country\nhave them at different parts of the year--there&#39;s no\nnational &quot;Dress as a Samurai&quot; Day or anything. \n\nhttp://community.webshots.com/slideshow?ID=140951969&key=xVpHsZ\n\nThe above are pictures I took at the Hojo Godai\nMatsuri, in Odawara, Kanagawa-prefecture, this past\nApril. The festival celebrates the famous Hojo family\nthat ruled much of the Kanto during the 1500&#39;s. Feel\nfree to check the pics out. \n\nIn addition to that one and the Takeda and Uesugi\nfestivals previously mentioned, I know the Nagashino\nFestival in Nagashino, Aich Prefecture, is also held\nin April--it reenacts the Battle of Nagashino, between\nthe Takeda and the Oda. That&#39;s high on my list of\nplaces to get to. I&#39;m sure there are other festival\nreenactments elsewhere, at possibly different\ntimes--if you&#39;re looking for something in a particular\nregion, I&#39;d be happy to try to help look something up\nfor you. At least when I get back to Japan and can\nlook it up in Japanese again. \n\nAdditionally, different from the above festivals\nmentioned, many places have Yabusame demonstrations at\nvarious times of the year. Yabusame is mounted\narchery, where the rider shoots from horseback at 3-4\ntargets as he gallops down the course. Very\ninteresting--I attended an event in Kamakura in April.\nMeiji-jingu shrine, near my house, has Yabusame in\nNovember. Nikko has some some other time of year, too.\n\n\nHope that helps,\n\nNate\n\n\n--- kellylindawd &lt;kellylindawd@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; can anyone tell me the names and what time of the\n&gt; year they have the \n&gt; samurai festivals in japan?\n&gt; i see alot of talk about them and occasionaly a\n&gt; picture or two but \n&gt; dont really know that much about them\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; wayne\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n            \n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
