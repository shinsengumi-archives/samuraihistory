I  have some questions:\n- whenn the shoguns ruled japan there was no emperor, was there?\n- can someone tell me something about the training of the samurai? or information about the wapens they used and how?\n- who exactly were the daimyo? As far I understand they were the lords of the samurai, but did the daymio fight also?\n- I would like to know something about the influence of confucius on the life of the samurai.\nthanks in advance.\n \nregards,\nshannon\n \n_________________________________________________________________\nLive.nl: je eigen persoonlijk startpagina met nieuws en feeds die JIJ belangrijk vindt!\nhttp://www.live.com/getstarted.aspx\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
