So I won&#39;t add yet another.\n\n&gt;considering all \n&gt;this,i want to ask if the difference is simply because of \n&gt;religious beliefs or perhaps out of conveniency?\n\nIt is convenience, which of course may have been couched in mystical \nterms. It&#39;s apparently quite difficult to pull off slicing one&#39;s \nbelly open (I haven&#39;t tried it myself), even for a man. So on average, \nbased on physical strength, it&#39;s that much more difficult for a \nwoman.\n\n&gt;and secondly,were there any other &#39;honourable&#39; ways to commit suicide apart \n&gt;from slicing open the belly?\n\nJust about all of them, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThere are apparently cases of women doing seppuku historically - but \naccepted wisdom is that they sliced their throat (or, more usually, \npierced their throat). \n\nAlternatively, there is a common idea that when faced with \ncertain death, women would essentially fall on their sword - put a \nblade up to their chest and fall forwards, plunging it into their \nhearts.\n\nAnother common folk-truth is that women committed suicide in these \nsituations by biting off their tongues - though it&#39;s never been clear \nto me exactly how this would lead to death, other than by slowly bleed\ning to death which could have been accomplished any other number of wa\nys.\n\nWomen are also said to have hanged themselves (kubi-tsuri), drown \nthemselves (nyuu-sui), or jumped off of cliffs (tobi-ori).\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
