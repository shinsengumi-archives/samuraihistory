Shingen and Kenshin&#39;s Five BattlesSengoku Daimyo Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin are two well knownfigures from Japan&#39;s Sengoku period who fought five battles on theKawanakajima plain in Shinano province (Modern day Nagano prefecture)between 1553 and 1564. (The fouth battle was depicted in the 1990Kadokawa Haruki movie Heaven and Earth) Why did Kawanakajima becomethe main battleground for these two warriors? What made Kawanakajimasuch a contested area? I thought I&#39;d tackle this question for my blogpost this week. After a combination of poking around and deductivereasoning, I can come up with a few reasons. Although, there is no wayto really know which reasons might be correct, a little theoreticalguesswork never hurt anyone.The rest here:http://shogun-yashiki.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-kawanakajima-shingen-and-kenshins.html \n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLiity nyt uuteen Windows Live Messenger perheeseen\nhttp://get.live.com\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
