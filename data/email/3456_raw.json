The first British model was the Lee-Metford of 1888.  Therefore, any \nbreech loaders in Imperial Japanese army in 1877 were movie anachronisms.   \nMuskets----rifled muskets------in first battle could have been Civil War \nsurplus \nModel 1861 Springfield percussion muskets.  The US Army in 1877 was using the \nlater 45-70. caliber trap door Springfields,  still single shot.  This is \nwhat \nhelped doom Custer at Little Big Horn in 1876:  renegades had armed Indians \nwith the Model 1873 Winchester repeating rifle.  Prof Murf &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
