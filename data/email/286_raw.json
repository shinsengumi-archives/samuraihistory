Lyle Parker&quot; &lt;rntihg@...&gt;\r\n\r\nI did see a documentary on the history channel a year or two ago.  It was \nnot particularly scholarly, but of some use as an introductory look at the \ndevelopment of the Japanese warrior over time.  The documentary included \nexcerpts pf interviews with a few of the &quot;biggies&quot;: Stephen Turnbull, G. \nCameron Hurst and Karl Friday.  I did a search on the history channel \nwebsite and came up with the following:\n\n                        In Search of History:\n                        Samurai Warrior\n                        Price: $19.95\nhttp://www.historychannel.com\n\nThis seems a bit steep of a price from what I remember of the content, but \nperhaps someone else on the list could give a more detailed accounting.  One \ncaveat, I seem to recall an email conversation with Prof. Friday in which he \nintimated that some of his statements were taken a bit out of context.\n\nCheers,\n\nShannon\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nThere is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness.
