Several years after the death of=\r\n Musashi was wrote a compilation with the testimonies of the witnesses of t=\r\nhis event. The book was called &quot;Niten-Ki&quot;, the first biography of Musashi. =\r\nIn the book one of the chapters had a info about Musashi, accord this text =\r\nhe had both swords in the duel. \n \nHe left the Daito in the boat and took t=\r\nhe Shoto and the Suburito with him.  In the fight he just used the Suburito=\r\n.\n \nI have a resume of  this book but in spanish and my english is bad.\n \nB=\r\nest regards, \n\nHelly\n \n\nThomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; escribi=\r\n=F3:\n&gt; Guys,\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know the true story of Musashi when he was ab=\r\nout to duel \n&gt; with Sasaki Kojiro?&quot;\n\nShort answer - no - no-one knows, as t=\r\nhere are no records of the duel.\n\nThat a duelist should forget his weapon i=\r\ns patent nonsense, and shows\nhow a myth collects in time.\n\nOne aspect of th=\r\ne duel often ignored is the psychological ploys\nemployed to unsettle one&#39;s =\r\nopponent. Musashi employed them (from what\nwe read), such as arriving early=\r\n and waiting in ambush, arriving late,\netc.\n\nOther swordsmen used similar t=\r\nechniques - Nobutsuna Kamiizumi once\nasked an opponent to wait until a stud=\r\nent had arrived.\n\nToda Seigan faced an opponent with a bokken, so the man p=\r\nut away his\nsword and used a bokken too, not to be out-done. Seigan then pu=\r\nt down\nthe bokken and picked up a stick.\n\nI have read somewhere that there =\r\nis a view that Musashi had his\nstudents waiting in hiding on the island, an=\r\nd it was they who ambushed\nand killed Kojiro.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 200=\r\n6 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nS=\r\namurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: ht=\r\ntp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \nSamurai Jap=\r\nan Japan airline \n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
