The show, which is set in \nthe Edo period, is not a true historical title, but features action, \nadventure, and some comedy blended with an anachronistic hip-hop \nsoundtrack. Its name comes from the Okinawan word, &quot;champuru&quot; (e.g. \ngoya champuru), which means to mix or blend. \n\nWhat Watanabe started with Cowboy Bebop he now continues with \nSamurai Champloo. He has created a new genre by implementing a hip-\nhop theme into this title, much like Cowboy Bebop had a blues and \njazz theme. The score is composed of hip-hop beats by Japanese hip-\nhop artists Nujabes and Tsutchie among others, although the hip-hop \ninfluence is mostly subtle. Some samurai sport Adidas-like stripe \npatterns on their kimonos, while one of the main characters, Mugen, \nhas a capoeira-esque fighting style. The show has many other \nanachronistic elements as well. \n\nThe show revolves around three characters: The brash and lanky \nvagabond Mugen, the quiet and stoic ronin Jin, and the cute and \nquick-thinking waitress Fuu. Fuu helps Mugen and Jin escape from a \nvengeful daimyo and, in exchange, she persuades the two to help her \nin her search for a mysterious samurai who smells like sunflowers \nwith a coin toss. She will have trouble keeping the two from killing \neach other, though. \n\nGeneon Entertainment licensed the show for distribution in the \nUnited States nearly a full year prior to the show&#39;s airing in \nJapan. This decision was based almost solely on the reputation of \nits creator, Shinichiro Watanabe. On January 20, 2004, it was \nrevealed that the broadcasting rights were acquired by Cartoon \nNetwork, and the series began airing on the Adult Swim block on May \n14, 2005, in the 11:30 PM timeslot. \n\nThere is also a manga adaptation of Samurai Champloo that debuted in \nShonen Ace in January 2004.\n\n\n\n\n"
