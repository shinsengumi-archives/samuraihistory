And I&#39;ve also read it... but totally forgot \neverything :( I will read it one more time... \nBut do you agree with Yates on the importance of that meeting?\nI remember the story of Sakamoto, went to assassinate Katsu but ended\nup a disciple. But do you think that a single meeting could influece \na strong personality as Saigo?\nThank you for everything and once more sorry for my English...\nBye.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Gillian Rubinstein \n&lt;gillian@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Domenico,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Katsu Kaishuu (other names: Awa and Rintarou) is one of the most \n&gt; interesting characters of the period. Jansen has some very good \nstuff \n&gt; on him and his background (S.R. and the Meiji Restoration pp154 et \n&gt; seq). Is this book in your library?
