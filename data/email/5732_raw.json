Until now I&#39;ve been\ngetting mine for my group from a UK dealer, http://www.ninecircles.co.uk\nwho, recently found it necessary to switch his Japanese suppliers, which\nhas made getting custom fittings impossible. \n\nSo, I&#39;ve been trolling my way across the web looking for alternative\nsuppliers, and I&#39;d like to know people&#39;s opinions about any of the ones\nthat I&#39;ve found so far, see below.\n\nI&#39;m not interested in the iaito blades themselves, just the fittings, as\nfor our purposes the blades of these weapons are too soft. I get custom\nmade steel ones manufactured here in the UK by local smiths using the\nstandard iaito blade as a pattern, they then mount the new blade with\nthe imported fittings. I&#39;m looking for everything else: habaki, seppa,\ntsuba, tsuka, fuchi-kashira, menuki, saya and sageo.\n\nI&#39;m also looking for anyone dealing in tanto, yari, tachi and even no-\ndachi (if such exist), or someone who would be able to produce extra\nlong tsuka and saya for such big weapons, ideally with tachi style\nfittings. Man this is a tall order:-)\n\nAnyway, my list so far:\n\n1 &quot;Sword Store&quot; http://www.swordstore.com\n\n2 &quot;Minosaka&quot; http://www.jidai.jp\n\n3 &quot;Nishijin&quot; http://japanesesword.net/eng/index.html\n\n4 &quot;Meirin&quot; http://www.nipponto.co.jp/english/iai_e.htm\n\n5 &quot;Tozando&quot; http://www.tozando.com\n\nAs I do not speak any Japanese, having a heads-up on the above, before I\ngo throwing other people&#39;s money at them would be really appreciated.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n(Dean Wayland)\n\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
