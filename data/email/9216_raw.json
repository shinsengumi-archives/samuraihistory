Although from what =\r\nI&#39;ve seen a better word would be &quot;intone&quot;\nor &quot;recite&quot;, you don&#39;t really sin=\r\ng Noh, at least not in the\ntraditional sense.  According to the shinchokoki=\r\n, he sung it after\nhearing about the fall of two forts to the Imagawa (Wash=\r\nizu and\nMarune) as they closed in on him - he apparently made the announcem=\r\nent\nto fight after he finished the atsumori.  The Shinchokoki is\nconsidered=\r\n a reliable account, as the author was a first hand witness,\nborn in 1527, =\r\nso I would disagre with Wikipedia in that at least\nOkehazama was probably t=\r\nrue.  No one survived Honnouji that I know of\nwho could validate things at =\r\nthat point though.\n\n\n"
