The only thing is they have to be in English.  I am currently reading \n  Legends of  the Samurai and have several books about Bushido on order by \n  Yamamoto Tsunetomo.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, also if there are any \n  good fiction books to read about Samurai, I would be interested in those also.\n\n  Thanks,\n\n  Brett\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
