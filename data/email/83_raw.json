I&#39;d have to say that out of those, Mori \nMotonari was my favorite - most of it was pretty new to me, and for \nthe most part it had some excellent acting, but above all else, the \nmakeup surpasses all the previous drama.  I think they must have \nadded a little grey or a few wrinkles each episode, making the aging \nlook so natural.  After it was over, and i went back and watched the \nfirst few episodes again, i was surprised at how young everyone \nlooked.  Apparently it was more or less a bomb in Japan, but one of \nmy favorites.  Hideyoshi would come up #2 for the entertainment value \nalone - Takenaka Naoto is one of my favorite Japanese actors.  I was \nalso impressed by Sekigahara at the begining of Tokugawa Sandai, \nalthough apparently others weren&#39;t as impressed as I was...\n\nCEWest\n\n\n"
