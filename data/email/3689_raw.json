This group is pretty big on &quot;no bushido before musashi&quot; and I think \n(from the reviews I&#39;ve read) King assumes bushido was always a part of the Samurai lifestyle. \n\nI haven&#39;t read much on the use of Zen in the Samurai class. Zen seems to be strangely \ncompatible in an opposites attract sort of way with Bushido, but what about before Bushido \nwas really around? Which, did Zen give birth to Bushido in some way? And what role did Zen \nreally play in the samurai&#39;s life? I just don&#39;t see the connection or compatibility between the \nupper warrior class and Zen Buddhism. The principles and lifestyle just don&#39;t seem to mesh.\n\nAnyway, In defense of Mr. Lee,\n\nWhat he may have been getting at was the difference between Mahayana and Theravada \nBuddhism. Mahayana is the more popular, less rigorous, and more syncretistic variety found \nthroughout SE Asia, whereas Theravada is the more &quot;pure&quot; version of Buddhism, which had a \nstronger hold in Japan (Zen Buddhism being a subcategory of Theravada). Zen, as a \nsubcategory of Theravada, adds to the mix the idea of &quot;immediate&quot; enlightenment rather than \ngradual enlightenment, through the use of meditation to bring about enlightening moments, or \nepiphanies.\n\nBut where Lee says that Korean, Japanese, and Chinese Buddhism should all be in one \ncategory, he&#39;s right as far as them all being Theravada, but he&#39;s wrong in that Japanese \nBuddhism is pretty different from Chinese, at least in that Chinese Buddhism is more \nsyncretistic. Japanese Buddhism is generally regarded as being the version closest to the \noriginal Buddhism.\n\nLee wrote:\n&gt;The Japanese Buddism results from intellectual\n&gt; interaction among Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism\n&gt; itself throughout centuries, the first two of which\n&gt; did not really have much effect on India, South Asia,\n&gt; and Tibet.\n&gt; Through this interaction, primitive Taoism and\n&gt; Confucianism was reborn as more subtle and complex\n&gt; philosophy with rigorous logical structures in 5 and\n&gt; 12 centuries respectivly\n\nI wouldn&#39;t say that Japanese Buddhism &quot;results from&quot; that interaction, but rather that the \npresence of Taoism and Confucianism allowed for Buddhism to be accepted with greater ease. \nTaoism and Confucianism are primarily atheistic, as is Theravada Buddhism. Both promote a \ngeneral morality, as does Buddhism. And Taoism, with its quizzical proverbs and mysterious \nstatements, parallels (a little bit) the practices of Zen teachers quizzing their students (strange \nstatements that don&#39;t really mean anything but might help you understand something else). \nAnd Buddhism can easily be looked at as &quot;The Way&quot;. But &quot;parallels&quot; is a different thing than \n&quot;results from.&quot; I think history would show that Japanese Buddhism - rather than being an \nexample of syncretism - is actually the closest to the original Buddhism of India. Mahayana \nBuddhism is sometimes VERY syncretistic, and has little to do with what Siddartha Gautama \nactually taught, and again, the Buddhism of Japan is different from that of China, even though \nthey&#39;re both technically Theravada.\n\nFor those who don&#39;t know the history: Buddhism started in India as kind of a reactionary \nspinoff of Hinduism. It grew in popularity and Buddhist missionaries were sent out to Asia. As \nTheravada Buddhism spread in Asia (and through China, into Japan) there was a resurgence of \nHinduism in India, and the Hindus killed or drove out all the Buddhists. In Japan, the Buddhism \nstayed more or less in its pure form, but in the rest of Asia, it developed into a less rigorous \nversion (Mahayana) and mixed with the traditional religions. Though China is technically \ntheravada, it&#39;s still syncretistic, so more like the rest of asia than Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Are you nuts Mr Lee?\n&gt; Where is your sources?\n&gt; Had ye at LEAST studyed anything about japanese buddhism?\n&gt; \n&gt; With the exception of the Nichiren Shoshu (Not Nichiren Shu), that I will\n&gt; give no comments for politeness reasons...\n&gt; \n&gt; Your information is incorrect, specially if ye take in an absolute degree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, taoism had an influence in japanese culture, but buddhism is another\n&gt; case.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can say at certain points that in popular sence, due to the Shinbutsu\n&gt; Shugo historical phenomena, there was some syncretisms between buddhism and\n&gt; shindo (way of the gods, the indigenous faith of japan, also know as\n&gt; shintoism) like the Shichifukujin, in special the Daikokuten, that is a\n&gt; translation of the sanskrit Mah�kala, a wrathful war deity, called to fight\n&gt; evil spirits, grant victory against evil enemies, and to ensure prosperity\n&gt; with an image of an shinto god of weathiness whose name is something like\n&gt; &quot;...onushin no kami&quot; or something like that.\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If you read the Shingon-shu founder Kubo Daishi K�kai Great Treatise about\n&gt; the three religions, including Buddhism, Taoism and Confucionism, you would\n&gt; see his great knowledge about these three philosofical systems, but showing\n&gt; Buddhism as supperior, so discouraging mixes and saladas.\n&gt; \n&gt; He went to China, to receive the transmission of the Tantric Vajrayana\n&gt; Buddhism from Hui-kwo, who received from Subhakarasimha, who have a direct\n&gt; lineage to Nagarjuna himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; The same happens with the Zen (chinese: Chaan Sanskrit: Dhyana) Shu\n&gt; buddhism. They have a direct linneage of tranmission direct from\n&gt; Boddhidharma who also transmitted the Bodhisattva Vajramukti that is the\n&gt; root of the majority of several asiatic martial systems, including Karate\n&gt; whose movements are based on the paterns of the Maha-Mandala that is the\n&gt; embodyment of the three holy bodies of Dai-nichi Nyorai (Maha Vairocana\n&gt; Tathag�ta) and Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni Tathag�ta).\n&gt; \n&gt; study more before saying ignorant things about Japan.\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I was a Mikkyo follower, including Shugendo, for several years in my past,\n&gt; and even if no longer a buddhist, I still respect this way due to their\n&gt; tolerance towards others religions, unlike certain ones that promoted a real\n&gt; bloodshed in Europe, Japan, Brazil, etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\n&gt; S�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Message: 10\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 4 Feb 2004 02:58:59 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;    From: Lee Changsub &lt;knorr31@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: One minor point\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Group:\n&gt; I often have read discussions involving Buddihism as a\n&gt; part of the Japanese culture.\n&gt; With regard to the connection of the Japanese Buddhism\n&gt; to that of India, South Asia, and Tibet, I want to\n&gt; point out that they are significantly different.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Japanese Buddism results from intellectual\n&gt; interaction among Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism\n&gt; itself throughout centuries, the first two of which\n&gt; did not really have much effect on India, South Asia,\n&gt; and Tibet.\n&gt; Through this interaction, primitive Taoism and\n\n&gt; Confucianism was reborn as more subtle and complex\n&gt; philosophy with rigorous logical structures in 5 and\n&gt; 12 centuries respectivly.As for the proper terminology\n&gt; for the present Taoism and Confuncianism for the\n&gt; Westerners, I personally think that words like\n&gt; &#39;Theoretical&#39; Taoism and Confuciansim would suit.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is one of reasons why I think that we need to\n&gt; consider having a distinctly different cultural\n&gt; classification covering Japan, China, and\n&gt; Korea.(something like North Asia or North East Asia)\n&gt; This may be one of fertile area of research for\n&gt; Western scholars for the coming years.
