You wouldn&#39;t know \nprecisely which timeframe the story belongs to if it wasn&#39;t for a \nbrief mention of Emperor Tensho (who I think ruled in the late \n1500s...). However, the story&#39;s a fantasy: the lead \ncharacter &quot;Ashitaka&quot; is cursed by the toach of a Boar God (who was in \nturn cursed by hate, a tatarigami), and is banished from his village, \nembarking on a quest to find a way to lift his curse. In the way he \nencounters tons of people (including some samurai warlords) and gods \n(wolf, boar, and dear gods), yet there is never a heavy load of \nhistorical info; in fact, there is almost none, save the details of \ndaily living in that time.\n\nThat&#39;s the kind of story I&#39;m writing; the historical info is more of \na way to set myself into that timeframe, and to give the story \nsome &quot;realistic&quot; feel to something that is mostly fantastic \n(werewolves, gods, etc...). Now, it if were something more along the \nlines of &quot;Ran&quot; or &quot;Musashi&quot;, your points would be very valid (and I&#39;m \nwith you on that aspect completely), but it&#39;s just something else. I \napologize for the confusion, for I should have stated the nature of \nmy story more explicitely from the beginning.\n\nAnd to answer your question, the target audience leans more towards \nanime/manga people than samurai history scholars/fans.\n\np.d. so what the banner of the Shinsengumi has written is &quot;Makoto&quot;?\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, tom helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Now thats Makoto!\n&gt; \tWhich incidentally is the slogan of you old friends the \n&gt; Shinsengumi. I am sorry if I offended you. look forward to reading \n&gt; your book.\n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
