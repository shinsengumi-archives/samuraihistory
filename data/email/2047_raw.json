And you must \nbe ready to die on a moments notice. there are also\n&gt; many sources that speak of keeping your armour and weapons in good \nrepair and to practice your martial skills.\n&gt; I hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Myumi \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, August 01, 2003 4:01 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Bushido\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   hi! just wnat to ask if anybody here could help me about the code \nof \n&gt;   ethics of the samurai and if there are any contents of the \nbushido? \n&gt;   thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
