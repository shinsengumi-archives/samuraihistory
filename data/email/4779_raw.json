A daimyo ruled over a province \n&gt; and reported to the shogun, the military leader in Japan during the \n&gt; Edo period. During the Meiji restauration, the institution of the \n&gt; daimyo was abolished and the provinces were replaced by prefectures. \n&gt; While The shogun was the highest Japanese military ruler during the \n&gt; Kamakura and Edo period. Although the emperor was officially the head \n&gt; of the state, the shogun rulers had the actual power until the end of \n&gt; the Edo period\n\nKind of. The only thing really wrong is that daimyo didn&#39;t run provinces, as a \nrule very few had an entire province or more. There were only sixty-some \nprovinces in Japan, and well over 200 daimyo at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate.\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
