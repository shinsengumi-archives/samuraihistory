They wrote the thoughts , \nstory about the  succession of Emperor.\n\n   T=\r\nhey said the origin of Japanese Emperor was AMATERAS OOMIKAMI , \nthe god of=\r\n Sun , and the child between the Japanese first gods for \nwhole things , IZ=\r\nANAGI and  IZANAMI .  The number sixth descendant \nfrom AMATERAS  OOMIKAMI =\r\n was the first Emperor ,  JINMU TENNOU ( \nEmperor JINMU )  and was followed=\r\n by descendants all the way.  \n   Which means Japanese Emperor was believed=\r\n as God, and Human God \nby Japanese peoples of BUKE groups, Peerrages, Farm=\r\ners, every body \nsince then untill very nowadays.\n   Of course, the present=\r\n Japanese , except some people, dont belive \nEmperor as the God.  \n   Becau=\r\nse of the thought that Emperor is god, other than the \ndescendants of Emper=\r\nor family , inherited Emperor blood, cannot \nsucess the Japanese Emperor.  =\r\n Even the most powerful Shogun or \nChief of BUKE  coudn&#39;t success the statu=\r\ns of Emperor, because they \nwere not first position of Emperor family.\n\n  I=\r\nn this book,  KOJIKI, also they said Japanese Emperor can leave \nthe power =\r\nto govern the political affairs of Japanese peoples to \nanybody else, for e=\r\nxample  , SHOGUN.  However, Japanese Emperor \ncannot leave the power of rel=\r\nigious affairs of people, so , Emperor \nhas been continuing to involve in t=\r\nhe power of religious things as \nthe representative of Japanese god.\n\n    C=\r\nan you believe this thing ?  I think any foreigners cannot \nbelieve this th=\r\ning, but it is understandable.  Emperor is the very \nunique , only Japanese=\r\n thing in history.\n    If you believe the story , thoughts in KOJIKI , the =\r\nbook of old \nstories  compiled  in  the year of 712 AC ,  you can understan=\r\nd the \nabove.\n\n   \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Gerard Gi=\r\nllespie \n&lt;gjgillespie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The Emperor is decended of the sun go=\r\nddess=A0=A0and =A0a priest of \nthe Shinto order. none if the others would h=\r\nave never been reconized \nby the other great power China, Korea, because th=\r\ney where of low \nbirth, also one does not cut one self off from the sun, an=\r\nd the \nEmperor was the sun so it was to greater prestege to have connection=\r\n \nto the royal family then destroy it.\n&gt; =A0That is why the office of Shogu=\r\nn of the military class=A0was \ncreated=A0=A0so that who ever occupied the o=\r\nffice . would appear to \nhave to royal blessing to rule the land in the emp=\r\neriors name.\n&gt; yours respectfully,\n&gt; Gerard Gillespie\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 10/5=\r\n/08, yoshiyuki hiramoto &lt;eddiehiramoto@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: yoshiyuki hir=\r\namoto &lt;eddiehiramoto@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai ( Buke in=\r\n auchaeological \nterm )\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday=\r\n, October 5, 2008, 12:51 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@ yaho=\r\nogroups. com, &quot;JL Badgley&quot; \n&lt;tatsushu@ .&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is *w=\r\nay* too much of a summary of events, but I&#39;ll leave it \n&gt; stand\n&gt; &gt; so some=\r\none can nitpick it and further refine it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Josh\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Josh,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n You did good job to explain about Samurai, Buke including \n&gt; Minamoto, Tai=\r\nra, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please let me summarize Buke things following to my previous =\r\n\n&gt; explanation. I said TO BE CONTINUED.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then, Buke power became =\r\nstronger and stronger as time \n&gt; went by. And the chief of many of the Buke=\r\n groupes came out. That \n&gt; is Heike. Kanmu Emperor had so many wives and so=\r\n many children as \na \n&gt; result of it, and finaly he couln&#39;t feed whole of h=\r\nis big family , \n&gt; so he decided to seperate his fourth son, named price Ka=\r\njiwara as \n&gt; HEISI and sentenced him to become the chief of Buke group to g=\r\nard \n&gt; Emperor family and his desendants inherited HEISI name . One of \n&gt; t=\r\nhe groupes of HEISI was ISE HEISI followed by Taira no Kiyomori \nwho \n&gt; was=\r\n the first chief of BUKE having the power a little bit stronger \n&gt; than Emp=\r\neror and control the political administrative business \n&gt; supervising Emper=\r\nor. \n&gt; However, the emperor at that time, aiming to get back power over \n&gt; =\r\nHEISI and utilize Genji group to upset HEISI.\n&gt; Genji was another chief of =\r\nBUKE groupes . Emperor SEIWA got so \n&gt; many wives and so many children like=\r\n Emperor Kanmu before and \n&gt; nominated number sixth prine , named SADASUMI =\r\nas to become the \nChief \n&gt; of BUKE as GENJI group. the desendants of SADASU=\r\nMI inherited \n&gt; Genji group and did the job of gardman for Enmperor.\n&gt; Yori=\r\ntomo defeatd HEISI and became the first chief of Genji who \n&gt; founded and w=\r\nas nominated the SHOGUN and formed government to \n&gt; control The political a=\r\ndministrative business.\n&gt; Since then, the chief of BUKE controled the polit=\r\nical \n&gt; administrative business , pushed Emperor far a way aside untill \nth=\r\ne \n&gt; end of TOKUGAWA era.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Emperor who used to control policy with =\r\nthe strongest power \n&gt; in Japan have to stay in small place in somewhere in=\r\n KYOTO without \n&gt; no political power , but just religious related power for=\r\n a long \n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now at this point , here comes very famous question.\n=\r\n&gt; Why Emperor of Japan was not destroyed . Why many chieves of \n&gt; BUKE such=\r\n as NOBUNAGA, ASHIKAGA, TOKUGAWA didn&#39;t wipe out \n&gt; Emperor ? Only Japanese=\r\n Emperor has been continuing to exist in \n&gt; this world since the begining ,=\r\n inheriting only one same blood. \n&gt; The present Emperor ( HEISEI Emperor ) =\r\nis the number 125th.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking forward to hearing your any comments abou=\r\nt above \n&gt; question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eddie Hiramoto\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have be=\r\nen removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
