But it seems quite possible that this may =\r\nhave been the case. Actually, I had not planned to cover this but it would =\r\nbe an excellent addition if I have time to recearch it. \n\nMy skills at read=\r\ning Japanese are limited, but there is a book by Hirofumi Yamamoto (Seppuku=\r\n: Nihonjin no Sekinin no Torikata). that has about 400 examples of seppuku =\r\nduring the Edo Period--could be in there. I have been getting some translat=\r\nions of from Dr. Stephen Taguchi from the University of Northern Alabama, b=\r\nut I haven&#39;t come across that particular story. I will look into that as so=\r\non as I can. I am extremely interested in this. I can&#39;t believe I havent se=\r\nen anything about this yet.\n\nJonathan P.

Perhaps you might want to put a link to it in the Edo Period sectio=\r\nn of the Samurai Archives Citadel.\n  \n Speaking of film and seppuku: I&#39;ve b=\r\nrought this up before. But Kobayashi&#39;s film SEPPUKU discussed incidents of =\r\nearly Edo-period ronin from disbanded clans coming to clan gateways to requ=\r\nest a spot to commit seppuku. In the film, the main fictional character (Ts=\r\nugumo Hanshiro) mention a name of a ronin who came to the Sengoku clan&#39;s ga=\r\nteway (unfortunately, the man&#39;s name mentioned in the film has escaped me a=\r\nt the moment). This ronin told the clan leaders that he preferred to commit=\r\n seppuku rather than live on in endless poverty. The Sengoku clan leaders w=\r\nere so impressed that they made him a member of their clan. After that, sup=\r\nposedly scores of impoverished ronin went to clan gates with seppuku reques=\r\nts and the clans would give them &quot;go away&quot; money. Sooner or later most of t=\r\nhese seppuku requests were insincere; the ronin involved wanted the money r=\r\nather than actually wanting to commit seppuku. As many of us know, the film=\r\n SEPPUKU involves a ronin making such a request --\n with tragic consequence=\r\ns. \n  \n Anyway, I don&#39;t really want to discuss the film. Rather I&#39;m curious=\r\n to know: did the incident mentioned in the film involving the Sengoku clan=\r\n actually happen? Or did Kobayashi (and/or novelest Takaguchi) draw a compl=\r\netely fictional event with fictional names out of the hat?

The film&#39;s \n=\r\n name (the same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, and=\r\n \n was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes place in =\r\n\n 12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a revolt. =\r\n\n During the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal palace in=\r\n \n Kyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescued by a sol=\r\ndier \n named Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revolt fails, M=\r\noritoh \n is told that he can have anything that he wants, and what he wants=\r\n is Lady \n Kesa to be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that she is al=\r\nready \n married to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Rather than =\r\nseek \n something different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with Lady =\r\nKesa.\n Filmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first color=\r\n films \n from Japan), the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exquisite. Th=\r\ne story is \n by no means dated, though it does become somewhat predictable.=\r\n Still, it is \n both compelling and engaging and the acting is superb, espe=\r\ncially Machiko \n Ky. Memorable scenes in the film include the confusion at =\r\nthe royal palace, \n Laky Kesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Moritoh meet=\r\ning Lady Kesa and her \n aunt after the revolt, Moritoh given the choice of =\r\nhis heart&#39;s desire, the \n horse races, Moritoh at the home of Lady Kesa&#39;s a=\r\nunt, and the ending scenes. \n The makeup used on Moritoh could have been be=\r\ntter.\n \n The film won several awards including an Oscar for Best Costume De=\r\nsign, an \n Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the pr=\r\nestigious \n Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Overall, I r=\r\nate &quot;Gate of \n Hell&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars. Hopefully, the film will be ful=\r\nly restored and \n released on DVD one day. I highly recommend the film.\n \n =\r\nBest regards,\n \n Barry Thomas.\n \n ----- Original Message ----- \n \n From: &quot;j=\r\nonathan ellgen&quot; &lt;jpellgen@yahoo. &lt;mailto:jpellgen%40yahoo.com&gt; com&gt;\n To: &lt;s=\r\namuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com&gt;\n =\r\nSent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 9:28 AM\n Subject: Re: [samuraihistory]\n \n &gt;=\r\nI am working on a section of my master&#39;s thesis dealing with the Hogen \n &gt;I=\r\nncident.
