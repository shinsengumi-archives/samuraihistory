The book, which evolved out of earlier\nresearch first published in Japane=\r\nse under the title of &quot;Haha Naru\nTenno,&quot; covers the political, cultural and=\r\n religious background to the\n&quot;emperor&quot; system in Japan from mythological ti=\r\nmes down to the present\nday. I have put the term &quot;emperor&quot; in quotes as wha=\r\ntever else they\nwere, Japanese emperors were never equivalent to emperors i=\r\nn China or\nRussia. Nor were they ever emperors in the Roman sense of the te=\r\nrm\n&quot;imperator&quot; or generalissimo.\n\nShillony emphasizes that &quot;The political w=\r\neakness of the Japanese\nemperors was balanced by the extraordinary stabilit=\r\ny of their dynasty.\nThe effete emperors occupied an unchallenged throne. An=\r\n emperor could\nbe deposed, exiled or even murdered, but his institution cou=\r\nld never\nbe abolished and his family could not be replaced.&quot;\n\nHe concludes =\r\nthat the &quot;strange survival&quot; of the dynasty was due to the\nfact that Japanes=\r\ne emperors combined sanctity with passivity to such\nan extent that they wer=\r\ne &quot;too subservient to rule, but too sacred to\nbe deposed.&quot; These conclusion=\r\ns are based on his study of how the\nemperors behaved over the centuries.\n\nT=\r\nhe author has much to say about the divinity of the emperors. He\npoints out=\r\n that in Japan the &quot;kami,&quot; which is generally translated as\n&quot;god,&quot; were tra=\r\nnscendental beings. The term could be applied to any\ndead person, object or=\r\n natural phenomenon. He notes the differences\nbetween the divinity ascribed=\r\n to Japanese emperors to that ascribed to\nthe pharaohs in ancient Egypt and=\r\n notes the stress laid in Europe on\nthe &quot;divine right of kings&quot; resulting f=\r\nrom their claim to be God&#39;s\nrepresentative on earth carrying out His orders=\r\n.\n\nThe emperor in Japan was not the representative of the kami but &quot;an\ninte=\r\nrmediary between the people and the gods.&quot; He was venerated but\nnot worship=\r\nped. However his body was regarded as &quot;sacred and neither\nknives nor scisso=\r\nrs could be applied to it.&quot; This seems to have been\none of the causes of th=\r\ne high rate of infant mortality in the imperial\nfamily down to the 20th cen=\r\ntury.\n\nShillony discusses in detail the occasions during which women were\nr=\r\nuling empresses. There seem to have been shaman queens in early times\nbut t=\r\nhe first person to hold the title of &quot;tenno&quot; (The Emperor) was\nthe Empress =\r\nSuiko in 593. Between that time and 770, six women were\ntitular empresses, =\r\nbut the last of these, Koken-Shotoku, was a\ncontroversial figure and there =\r\nno titular empresses until the Tokugawa\nEra. One reason for this was the in=\r\nfluence of Confucian attitudes\nadopted by the Japanese; these gave preceden=\r\nce to men and led to male\nchauvinism, which is still a strong element in Ja=\r\npanese culture today.\n\nWe tend to think that Japanese emperors since the en=\r\nd of the 6th\ncentury have always been called tenno but as Shillony points o=\r\nut,\nvarious different terms have been used over the ages. The old Japanese\n=\r\ntitle for emperor was &quot;sumera mikoto.&quot; According to the Yoro code of\n718, &quot;=\r\ntenno&quot; was to be used in imperial rescripts, &quot;tenshi&quot; in\nceremonies, &quot;kotei=\r\n&quot; in correspondence with &quot;barbarians&quot;&#39; and &quot;heika&quot;\nin addressing the empero=\r\nr. At the beginning of the Meiji Era, the term\n&quot;mikado&quot; was in general use =\r\nwhen the English title of &quot;emperor&quot; was\nadopted to give the Meiji Emperor a=\r\nn equivalent status to that of the\nsovereigns of China, Russia, Germany, Fr=\r\nance (at the time of Napoleon\nIII) and Britain (Queen Victoria had been pro=\r\nclaimed Empress of India).\n\nShillony points out that the continuation of th=\r\ne Imperial dynasty\ndepended on the birth of sufficient sons in the family. =\r\n&quot;To avert\nbiological extinction, the emperors had to have access to many no=\r\nble\nand fertile women.&quot; Even so sometimes the succession was remote,\nalthou=\r\ngh the ancestral chain was never apparently broken. The Meiji\nEmperor had 1=\r\n5 children by various concubines but only five survived.\nThe Showa Emperor =\r\nwas not prepared to follow his grandfather&#39;s example\nand the practice thus =\r\nended in the 20th century. After World War II,\nthe collateral branches of t=\r\nhe Imperial family, which could provide a\nsuccessor, were abolished.\n\nIn th=\r\ne last 40 years there have been no male children born into what\nhas become =\r\na very limited Imperial family. This has made it necessary\nto consider the =\r\npossibility of a female eventually once again becoming\nthe tenno. This woul=\r\nd not require a constitutional amendment but it\nwould require a change to t=\r\nhe Imperial House Law. At present Imperial\nprincesses cease to be &quot;imperial=\r\n&quot; when they marry, and for some\nJapanese the adoption of a matrilineal line=\r\n of succession instead of a\npatrilineal could be a sticking point. It would=\r\n also lead to the end\nof the unreasonable pressure apparently still being p=\r\nlaced by Imperial\nHousehold officials on the Crown Princess to produce a ma=\r\nle heir.\n\nShillony considers that the most important issue for the continua=\r\nnce\nof the Imperial institution is to ensure its continued relevance for\nJa=\r\npanese people. In 1977, while he was Crown Prince, the present\nEmperor decl=\r\nared: &quot;When we look at the tradition of the Imperial\nfamily, we see that it=\r\n is mainly a tradition of gakumon (learning) and\nnot of bu (fighting). Very=\r\n few emperors donned military uniforms. I\nwould like to continue this tradi=\r\ntion . . . The phenomenon of symbol\nemperors is not a postwar creation. In =\r\nmy view, the emperors have been\nsymbols since antiquity.&quot; This may well be =\r\nthe case, but at least the\nemperor should be accepted by the Constitution a=\r\ns &quot;head of state&quot; as\nin practice he has been by foreign countries to which =\r\nhe has paid\nstate visits.\n\nA &quot;symbol&quot; also needs to be able to fulfill a me=\r\naningful role and not\nbe totally hedged about by Imperial Household bureauc=\r\nrats. Shillony\nthinks that the Imperial family might regain relevance throu=\r\ngh its\nsupport for the protection of the environment and he suggests that:\n=\r\n&quot;The archaic rites of the Japanese emperor [e.g. in relation to\nJapan&#39;s ric=\r\ne culture], which for a long time have been a source of\nembarrassment to mo=\r\ndern-minded Japanese, may in the future appear as a\nsymbolic ceremony of pa=\r\nying tribute to mother nature.&quot; Perhaps so, but\nwhile we do not need or wan=\r\nt to see the Imperial family becoming a\nmore frequent source of scandal and=\r\n gossip as has happened to the\nroyal family in Britain, Japan&#39;s Imperial in=\r\nstitution would benefit\nfrom a more open culture.\n\nA beginning was made whe=\r\nn the present Crown Prince stayed in Britain\nas a student at Oxford from 19=\r\n83-85. This showed him how ordinary\npeople lived and enabled him to gain a =\r\nbetter understanding of the\nworld around him. His memoir &quot;Thames to tomo ni=\r\n,&quot; which will be\npublished in English later this year under the title &quot;The =\r\nThames and\nI,&quot; reveals his natural human charm and sense of humor. Perhaps =\r\nit was\nthis fact that led the Imperial Household to delay for many years\npe=\r\nrmission for a translation.\n\nHugh Cortazzi, a former career diplomat, serve=\r\nd as Britain&#39;s\nambassador to Japan from 1980 to 1984. He translated &quot;The Th=\r\names and\nI,&quot; which will be published later this year by Global Oriental.\n\nT=\r\nhe Japan Times: Oct. 23, 2005\n(C) All rights reserved\n\n\n\n\n"
