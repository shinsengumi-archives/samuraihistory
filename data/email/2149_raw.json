Here is an excerpt from a research paper I wrote in 1997 on \nthe subject, for what it is worth:\n\n&quot;What might be overlooked is that the technique used by Nobunaga to \nkeep a continuous hail of bullets flying at the enemy [at Nagashino] -\n having the front row of musketeers move to the back to reload, \nallowing the next row to fire - was not even realized in Europe until \nalmost twenty years after Nobunaga&#39;s application, in the 1590&#39;s. \n(Parker)&quot;\n\n&#39;The Military Revolution&#39; is an excellent book and I highly recommend \nit.  If anyone on this list owns it, the section on Nobunaga can be \nfound on page 140, where if I recall correctly he actually mentions \nwho and where in Europe utilized volley fire for the first time in \nEurope.\n\nAs an aside to this, my military history teacher, who held any in \ndisdain any non-european country (in regards to pre-modern history), \nargued to me that Nobunaga&#39;s approach wasn&#39;t used until later in \nEurope because it was inferior to having everyone blast away at once \nwhich would cause greater shock and chaos in the enemy ranks, or \nsomething essentially to that effect...  any thoughts on this?\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Volly fire of guns was first used in Japan at the battle of \nNagashino in 1575. My question is, \n&gt; is this the first time it was employed anywhere? When was this \ntactic first used in Europe?\n&gt; I know the europeans were using the &quot;broadside&quot; in naval warfare \nbut when was in first used\n&gt; by infantry, anyone know?\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
