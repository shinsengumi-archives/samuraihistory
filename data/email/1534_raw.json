They are: Number 5 - \nTakeda Shingen, Number 6 - Shingen Battles and 24 Generals and number \n8 - Uesugi Kenshin.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will have a quick look in my &quot;library&quot; to see if there are any \nreferences....\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;                                 Rod Johnson\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Kitsuno &lt;cewest@s...&gt; \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, February 25, 2003 5:43 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Biography of Takeda Shingen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Can anyone tell me if there is a &#39;definitive&#39; biography of Takeda \n&gt;   Shingen and/or Uesugi Kenshin in Japanese, and if so, the title \nand \n&gt;   author?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
