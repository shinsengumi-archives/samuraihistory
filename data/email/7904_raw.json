It looks like that it&#39;s in this one area where\nwe disagree.\n\nNina \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Friday, October 21, 2005 9:34 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai? (was RE: [samuraihistory] R\ne: h itokiri kawaka\n\nPart A:\n\n&gt; I agree that people who read Ruroni Kenshin or see a\nZatoichi film and\n&gt; say &quot;this is THE TRUTH as it happened&quot; need to be\nreminded that this\n&gt; is not necessarily so.\n\nPart B:\n\n But also, saying that &quot;Author X wrote this in\n&gt; his Japanese history book&quot; also does not make it\nnecessarily the\n&gt; truth.\n\nThe &quot;But also&quot; is a clear connector, and therefore also the dividing line\nbetween two parts. You may be a math major, but I&#39;m a language major. \n\nWhile B is a tangential logical step that may outgrow from Part A, I stopped\nat Part A. And to then attack my statement of Part A by stating Part B,\nmakes no sense, and of course raises my hackles. B does not mean that A is\nincorrect. \n\n"
