This is just one of the things that makes r=\r\nesearching Japanese\n&gt;history sometimes difficult. Original source material,=\r\n unless you can read\n&gt;Japanese. Even then it depends on when it was written=\r\n. For example, I have\n&gt;managed to get my hands on a set of the Official Jap=\r\nanese Naval General\n&gt;Staff Report written after the Russo-Japanese War! Wha=\r\nt a score.\n\nWhat a score indeed! I&#39;d love to see even just a page or two of=\r\n \nthat. Any chance of getting even just a fraction of it scanned?\n\n&gt;Problem=\r\n is, it is written in Meji era Japanese and even my Japanese friends\n&gt;and a=\r\nssociates have a very hard time translating it. But! And this is a big\n\nThi=\r\ns is a fascinating thing about Japanese. Some languages can be \nread for hu=\r\nndreds of years.The often cited example being Italian. \nApparently Dante&#39;s =\r\nInferno is almost no problem at all to read for \nmodern Italian speakers (o=\r\nf which I am not one). On the other hand \nJapanese has changed very signifi=\r\ncantly over the same period of \ntime.\n\nI&#39;m not sure that Meiji Japanese sho=\r\nuld be _that_ big of a deal - \nbut maybe it&#39;s the combination of the fact t=\r\nhat it is Military \nlanguage and the fact that it was written 100 years ago=\r\n that makes \nit difficult.\n\n&gt;I will list the books that I have managed to c=\r\nollect covering the samurai\n&gt;and Japanese early history in another email.\n\n=\r\nPlease don&#39;t go to that trouble unless you were planning to do so \notherwis=\r\ne. But of course I&#39;d love to share notes.\n\nWhen you say &quot;early history&quot; - h=\r\now early do you mean? My own personal \nrealm of interest is currently rough=\r\nly the 16th century, though I am \nbeing pulled ever further backwards. I&#39;ve=\r\n recently started to get \ninterested in the Ritsuryo system which had its s=\r\ntart in the 7th \ncentury.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n\n---\nSamu=\r\nrai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http:=\r\n//www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
