Well, like I said,\n&gt; he might very \n&gt; well be an excellent martial artist and instructor,\n&gt; but as far as \n&gt; scholarship goes, he is a fiction writer at best.\n\nFunny, I seem to remember saying that he may well be a\ngood martial artist, but no, that&#39;s not what people\nremember me saying, even though they can go back and\ncheck. As far as him being a great guy, I doubt\nit--but then again, that&#39;s my personal opinion of\nsomeone who&#39;d &quot;invent&quot; history and mislead people for\npersonal gain. I&#39;m sure he could teach me a thing or\ntwo about choke holds, but as stated before, the\nJapanese kindergardener next door to me could teach\nhim a thing or two about history. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
