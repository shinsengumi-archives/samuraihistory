But there has to be some willing\nsuspension of disbelief. No way would Hosokawa Gracia\nand Will Adams, the real characters that Mariko and\nBlackthorne were based loosely on, have gotten\ntogether. NO WAY. As long as you don&#39;t take it too\nseriously, it&#39;s a lot of fun. But a lot of western\nmisconceptions are there--like the ninja mystique,\nincorrect translations of Japanese, notions of samurai\nhonor that didn&#39;t really exist until much later (or at\nleast we&#39;re not codified)....it plays on a lot of\nsamurai stereotypes that are frustrating if you know\nbetter. Down to things like that the main Daimyo had\nuniforms for their samurai--um, no.\n\nBut literary wise, it&#39;s a fun read. \n\nNate\n--- Eponymous13@... wrote:\n&gt; Hey there.\n&gt;        This may sound like dumb question, but AS A\n&gt; WORK OF FICTION, is Shogun \n&gt; any good?  Or is it a mire of a story like I found\n&gt; Tale of the Heike to be?  \n&gt; Just wondering, b/c I&#39;m thinking of reading it. \n&gt; (And yes, I am planning to \n&gt; give Tale another honest try someday, just not right\n&gt; now.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Later\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
