The aduchimomoyama.com site works, but is in Japanese.  I think I know \nthe answer to my first question before I ask it, but I&#39;ll ask it anyway: How \ndid Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi get along?  Second, one I asked \nsome time ago is still on my mind: other than both being married at one point \nor another to Nobunaga&#39;s sister Oichinokata, how did Shibata Katsuie and Asai \nNagamasa get along -- if at all?  I ask the two questions because I&#39;m doing \nresearch for a story I started writing.\n  Thanks y&#39;all for your help.\n\nLater,\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
