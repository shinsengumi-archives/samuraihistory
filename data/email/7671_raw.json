Katsumoto is a stand-in for Saigo Takamori,\nthe real historical person, who has been described as &quot;the last true\nsamurai&quot;. The film is nothing like the history. Likewise, no American\nsamurai either. This was just a viewpoint character to enable westerners\nto glimpse Japanese culture, or at least Hollywood&#39;s version of it.\n\nAnyway, see this short piece on Saigo Takamori:\nhttp://www.jref.com/glossary/saigo_takamori.shtml\n\nAnd for more info on the samurai in general go to:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/index.html\n\nHope this helps.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
