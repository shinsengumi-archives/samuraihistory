The Emperor is the head of state\n&gt; because he&#39;s divine? \n\n\nI meant it in the lightest sense (hence &quot;SEMI-Theocracy) ;) \nCould one have really united the country under one rule without the \ncooperation or destruction of the Ikko Ikki?  That was sort of my \npoint, or one of them.  Meaning, in the invented theoretical case \nabove, if the Shogun is a puppet for the Buddhists, they have \ncontrol, and it therefore would be in thier interest to be theocratic \nabout things. Unlike all of the previous times, Japan was broken up \ncompletely by independent Daimyo, and I guess you could look on the \nEnryakuji, etc. in a similar way.  That being the case, they are as \nmuch an impediment to one uniting the country as an enemy daimyo.  In \nwhich case you either work with them or against them. And what \nwould &quot;working with them&quot; entail?\n\nBut all that is just a side question/comment to the original - which \nwas what would the most likely event be if someone else not as \ncompletely and utterly iron fisted against the Ikko Ikki et all as \nNobunaga had tried to unify the country.  Nobunaga didnt stop at \nEnryakuji, it was policy for his armies to slaughter men, women, \nchildren, and the old who were in any way associated with the ikko \nikki fortresses he brought down.\n\n\n"
