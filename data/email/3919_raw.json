I believe this concept is a sort of fake conciencnesse created created by the people at the top to make loyal soldiers to die for their battles battle. And in fact this &quot;honor&quot; is the most dishounarble thing to follow.\n \nI believe the only honor is the honor to all of mankind and our fellow human beings. This honor includes not to kill another.\nWhat does everybody else think?\nThanks for listening\nJonny\n\n \n \n \nVladilen Blackthorne &lt;vladilen_blackthorne@...&gt; wrote:\nI&#39;m new to this site and I do not know much about samurai. But I \nhope I have found a group that does know. From what I know fromt \nhesite and others is it is the perfect life. at least for me  to die \nfor the word honor. I only wish I had been born about 250 years \nago.. So maybe I could have fought int he battle of Shiroyama.. and \ndied with the one thing I understand well I joined to learn  more.. \nSo I guess.. hi\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
