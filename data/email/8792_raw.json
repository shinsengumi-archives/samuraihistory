Do you practice any\n&gt; Japanese Sword Martial Art ???   =\r\n\n&gt;  A real samurai never killed another person just\n&gt; because.   There was =\r\nalways a reason and certanly he\n&gt; never stain the edge of his shinken with =\r\nout a reason.\n&gt;   So he never kill as an assasin.   In previous Japan\n&gt; era=\r\ns, Hitokiri were in their majority Ronin paid by\n&gt; someone to kill another =\r\nperson due to usually\n&gt; political reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; And if some one wants to ki=\r\nll his self, please do not\n&gt; use Sepukku.   Sepukku is a ritual designed to=\r\n give\n&gt; back the dignity of a person who falls in disgrace by\n&gt; showing tha=\r\nt his blood is red (then pure, and no\n&gt; stained or black blood ).   \n\nThe f=\r\nact that no one kills &quot;without a reason&quot; unless they are \nschizophrenic and=\r\n can&#39;t comprehend thier actions (even serial \nkillers kill &quot;for a reason&quot; -=\r\n they enjoy it) aside, you are spoutng \nmodern Samurai bullshido drivel.
