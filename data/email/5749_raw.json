You don&#39;t have any more\ndetails? The main thing that bothers me is that geisha\ndidn&#39;t really exist, as such, until later in the\nTokugawa. There were courtesans, but they weren&#39;t\ncalled geisha at the time. \n\nNate\n\n--- &quot;Tenshi, Rose, and Toni&quot;\n&lt;madmadotakuchick@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     I do realize I might not find the answer for\n&gt; this, but I&#39;m \n&gt; looking for a specific samurai. He was involved with\n&gt; Sekigahara, and \n&gt; left his lord to protect and be with a geisha he\n&gt; loved. He might \n&gt; have been hunted for it, but I&#39;m absolutely sure he\n&gt; was ronin after \n&gt; he left. What else would he have been?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
