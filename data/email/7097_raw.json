Being a moderator does NOT prevent me\nfrom having or giving my opinion. If you can&#39;t handle\nhearing someone else&#39;s opinion and take offense,\nthat&#39;s your issue, not mine. I didn&#39;t personally\ninsult you, despite your insults to me. Crap is crap\nand bunk is bunk and a hack historian is a hack\nhistorian, and as far as history goes Hayes is all of\nthe above, and immediately puts anything he&#39;s in\ncontact with into question. As you and Paul and others\nhave said the same things about Hayes as I have, for\ncrying out loud why is this such an issue for you? \n\nAs for English, I wasn&#39;t criticizing you for not\nspeaking fluent English. Your English is obviously\nbetter than my Spanish. However, several places in\nyour post to me I couldn&#39;t understand what you are\nsaying. Is that my fault for not understanding? No. \n\n&quot;&gt; This is like the guy who run for the world saying\n&gt; &quot;I&#65396;m a IO!... I&#65396;m IO!!!&quot;  the same\nthing.&quot;\n\nDoes &quot;IO&quot; stand for Intelligence Officer? I didn&#39;t\nbring that up--YOU DID. You also insulted me by\ntalking about training dogs, and not the martial arts.\n\n\nTHIS ISN&#39;T A MARTIAL ARTS LIST. IT&#39;S A JAPANESE\nHISTORY LIST, FOCUSED ON THE TIME FRAME FROM 1100 TO\n1868, WITH SOME VARIANCE ALLOWED. If Hayes or anyone\nelse is going to be brought up, most of us here will\nreact from that standpoint, and judge accordingly. \n\n\n\n--- Helly Angel &lt;ahelly69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#65396;m from Venezuela, not USA.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I never met Hayes and he is nothing to me.  I agree\n&gt; with Paul in the reference about Hayes. The think\n&gt; that I can&#65396;t understand is how an offensive\nforist\n&gt; like Ledbetter could be &quot;moderator&quot;.  The function\n&gt; of the moderator is the &quot;moderation&quot;! he must be the\n&gt; equilibrium in the relation of several people who\n&gt; share the same interests in a forum, ins&#65396;t?\n&gt;  \n&gt; And by the way I&#65396;m not guilty for not speak\nenglish.\n&gt;  Is the spanish a easy idiom to you?\n&gt; In the Bujinkan the idiom is not really important\n&gt; (Thank&#65396;s God!)\n&gt;  \n&gt; Really which is the problem with the black pijamas?\n&gt; ( I dislike guys in black pijamas) is because they\n&gt; are for the world running and saying &quot;I&#65396;m a\nninja...\n&gt; I&#65396;m a ninja!&quot; is for that?\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is like the guy who run for the world saying\n&gt; &quot;I&#65396;m a IO!... I&#65396;m IO!!!&quot;  the same\nthing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#65396;m don&#65396;t know how are the things in\nyour country\n&gt; but in my country if you say &quot;I&#65396;m a IO&quot; the\n&gt; consecuences coul be bad... here the situation is\n&gt; real.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Helly Angel.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; escribi&#12539;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; HI \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; if you read what we said then you would not have\n&gt; &gt; posted your critism.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did state that this was not anything like the\n&gt; &gt; hollywood version of ninja\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Paul\n&gt; \n&gt; And if you&#39;ll read my reply, it was to Helly, not to\n&gt; you--and was posted before yours was, so I couldn&#39;t\n&gt; have read yours, now could I? \n&gt; \n&gt; However, any connection with Hayes certainly\n&gt; SUGGESTS\n&gt; that the research is questionable, at best. I don&#39;t\n&gt; know Helly--and I&#39;ve seen too many ninja fanatics\n&gt; here\n&gt; to accept his say-so that this is legit. Forgive me,\n&gt; but with a connection to Hayes it&#39;s guilty until\n&gt; proven innocent. I didn&#39;t reply to you in the same\n&gt; manner, as you&#39;ve been around on the board, post\n&gt; intelligently, and don&#39;t strike me as the &quot;wannabe&quot;\n&gt; ninja type. If you&#39;re endorsing this, then\n&gt; fine--I&#39;ll\n&gt; fully admit there is a chance it&#39;s not crap, but\n&gt; again, any connection with Hayes makes it doubtful,\n&gt; at\n&gt; least until I see it. Too many documentaries simply\n&gt; try to capitalize on the hype (exhibit a-n: any\n&gt; documentary made during the &quot;Last Samurai&quot; hype)\n&gt; without doing any real research. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;             \n&gt; Yahoo!
