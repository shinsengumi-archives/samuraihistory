On enquiring its purposer, I was told it was a device for measuring time elapsed... It appears that our &quot;western&quot; day of 24hours was divided into two parts, being night and day. Nothing strange there until it was pointed out that night = sunset to sunrise and day = sunrise to sunset. Now the &quot;clever bit&quot; - of course through the year the number of hours from sunrise to sunset varies but there had to be a similar time period night and day {whatever it was say for now 6 periods!} ie varying &quot;hours&quot;. The device was so made to compensate for seasonal changes... I suppose thinking about it we had sundials (but little sun!) before chronometers came along.....\n\nWell thats a start anyway.... and if you are in the Cotswolds Area make sure you visit Snowshill (National Trust) it had a unique collection of &quot;samurai&quot; armour.\n\n          Rod Johnson\n\n\n&lt;Hi\n\nI was wondering what is the medievil Japanese method of time keeping.\n\nI have heard of it being in 2 hour segments named after animals but I am unsure if this is correct.\n\nAnd just how did they maintain the method of keeping time.\n\nIn the UK in ancient times they used to mark a candle with one hour segments. I just wondered if they did the same \n\nPaul&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
