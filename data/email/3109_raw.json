That rank \nis &#39;Jibu no Shou&#39; (confirmed against a Japanese web search -- for \nsome reason, the last Kanji is &#39;silent&#39; or something --not sure what \nis going on there). That page even breaks down the &#39;~no kami&#39; \nhierarchy. Apparently some provinces were more prestigious than \nothers to have as a title, I guess.\n\nHere is the site, it is a heck of a find:\nhttp://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Suzuran/7123/kansyoku.html\n\nAlso, www.goo.ne.jp is a great resource. Be sure to check that out, \ntoo.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Okay, update III: What can I say, the librarian is\n&gt; making a go of it--she just looked it up in some huge\n&gt; rekishi dictionary, and the kanji is incorrect--it\n&gt; should have the first radical in the first character\n&gt; with 3 water marks (sanzui) instead of the two you\n&gt; have--that makes it &quot;osamu&quot; and you&#39;d read it &quot;Jibe&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you&#39;re less confused than I am...\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Just sent an update, and the computer did something\n&gt; &gt; stupid....yurushite ne...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyways, update follows: After typing into a Google\n&gt; &gt; search, one of the librarians found it in connection\n&gt; &gt; with Ishida Mitsunari--was it his title? Anyways,\n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; of the hits had a yomikata for the first two kanji\n&gt; &gt; (INOBE), so as far as we can figure it&#39;s either\n&gt; &gt; INOBE\n&gt; &gt; or YABE. The second two, the consensus is SHOUHOU or\n&gt; &gt; SHOUSUKE, with the latter being agreed upon as\n&gt; &gt; probably correct. Maybe it&#39;s aan obscure kakikata\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; the common ~suke title?? TONY, where are you??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n\n\n\n"
