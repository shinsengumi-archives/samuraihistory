When his son pass=\r\nes. He goes outside to\n&gt; &gt; his dayimos and \n&gt; &gt; cuts off his ponytail and a=\r\nll the dayimos cut off\n&gt; &gt; theirs. They say \n&gt; &gt; it is for Hideyoshi son&#39;s =\r\nsoul. Is this an accurate\n&gt; &gt; portrayal of \n&gt; &gt; what might have happened? I=\r\nt was a very dramatic\n&gt; &gt; scene....\n&gt; \n&gt; The movie you&#39;re watching, &quot;Owl&#39;s =\r\nCastle&quot; (Fukuro no\n&gt; shiro), is a completely different case than the ones\n&gt;=\r\n explained. Hideyoshi is insane with grief--emphasis on\n&gt; insane. He cuts h=\r\nis topknot off in a fit of grief at\n&gt; his son&#39;s funeral. The daimyo gathere=\r\nd behind him then\n&gt; follow suit--not out of grief at the death, but\n&gt; becau=\r\nse Hideyoshi did it, so in order to appear loyal,\n&gt; they must two. Several =\r\nof the daimyo comment that\n&gt; Hideyoshi has gone mad, including Ishida Mitsu=\r\nnari and\n&gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu. In fact, the main reason Ieyasu\n&gt; commissions t=\r\nhe assasination of Hideyoshi is because\n&gt; he believes Hideyoshi&#39;s gone insa=\r\nne--this is the whole\n&gt; premise of the movie. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hideyoshi&#39;s not renounc=\r\ning anything--you seem him\n&gt; later in the movie, with a perfectly good topk=\r\nnot, as\n&gt; you see all the other daimyo. Had he renounced the\n&gt; world, he&#39;d =\r\nhave shaved his head, not just cut off his\n&gt; topknot. His act is the equiva=\r\nlent of someone today\n&gt; taking a baseball bat and smashing a window out of\n=\r\n&gt; rage or anger. Don&#39;t read too much into that scene in\n&gt; that particular m=\r\novie. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________________ \n&gt; Ya=\r\nhoo!
