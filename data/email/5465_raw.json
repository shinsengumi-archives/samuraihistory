I&#39;m trying to find information about the Sasaki clan, that was \nbased in Southern Omi, until the Oda restored Yoshiaki to Kyoto in \n1568. Searching on various search engines including Google has \nproven futile, and the little I have gleaned of this clan I have \nfound in Eiji Yoshikawa&#39;s excellent Taiko. Could anyone point me in \nthe right direction please?\n\nThanks,\nJP\n\n\n"
