Like with the way he presents facts or\n&gt; something? Because I have one of his books, &quot;Samurai\n&gt; Archives&quot; so I was just wondering whether there are\n&gt; flaws with his works...\n\nThe Samurai Sourcebook is pretty good. And most of his\nbooks, individually, are good. The biggest problem\nI&#39;ve seen is that most of the books are extremely\nrepetitive. The same anecdotes, the same outline, etc.\nWhile some of this can be excused by &quot;updating&quot;--his\nfirst books were published in the 1970&#39;s, so it&#39;\nunderstandable things will change somewhat--it&#39;s\nalmost like if you own one Turnbull book, you own them\nall. The fact that he keeps publishing more and more\n(Especially &#39;Samurai Warriors&#39;, &#39;Samurai Warlords&#39;,\netc.,) seems like he&#39;s just reshuffling and adding a\nnew title to make more money. The second complaint I\noften see is &quot;inaccuracies&quot;--some of his earlier\nstuff, especially, is, well, wrong on many points. He\ndoes seem to correct that in later works, at least. \n\nAll that being said, he&#39;s great because with all his\nfaults, he gets information out there. He&#39;s much\neasier to read than John Whitney Hall, etc. I just\nbought 2 more books by him, and I&#39;ll let you know what\nI think when I get them from Amazon. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
