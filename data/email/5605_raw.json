Himeji is beautiful,\nbut post-1600. If you go to Inuyama, you actually feel\nlike you&#39;re in the middle of the Sengoku. It&#39;s\noriginal, not rebuilt, and if you go on a cloudy day\nit&#39;s like being in the middle of Kurosawa&#39;s &quot;Throne of\nBlood&quot;. Aichi-ken, Inuyama-shi\n\nOkazaki-jo: birthplace of Ieyasu, neat little castle,\nbeautiful in cherry blossom season. \n\nKiyosu-jo: Small little reconstruction in North\nNagoya, nice little display of Nobunaga&#39;s stuff. \n\nGifu-jo: Way up on a mountain top, a heck of a climb,\nbut another great castle to check out to get a feel\nfor &quot;real&quot; Sengoku ambiance. \n\nFor your reference, Owari is western Aichi prefecture\n(Nagoya), Mikawa is the current eastern half of Aichi\nprefecture. \n\nLet me know more where you&#39;ll be, and I can provide\nyou some more suggestions. \n\n\nIt&#39;s more \n&gt; &#39;look n feel&#39; than anything else, although I&#39;m quite\n&gt; aware that Japan has \n&gt; changed and looking for Sengoku Mikawa might be like\n&gt; looking for \n&gt; Shakespeare&#39;s London ... gone a long time ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; All this is aid of atmosphere for my Sengoku\n&gt; blockbuster, so a view, or a \n&gt; stretch of the Tokaido as was, or anything that\n&gt; might say &#39;this is what it was \n&gt; like&#39; is the main intent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having said that, festivals are OK, demonstrations\n&gt; are better - iaido/jutsu the \n&gt; best.\n&gt; \n&gt; So any ideas for packing a lifetime&#39;s experience in\n&gt; one trip?\n&gt; \n&gt; And what time of year is best?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
