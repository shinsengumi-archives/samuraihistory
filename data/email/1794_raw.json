And from then until \n1868 with the Meiji Restoration(some records show the restoration and \nthe various rebellions post and prior that the end of the bushi came \nin 1867-9) the Samurai where the ruling class. though of course the \ncourt nobles and Emporer still had power they had been reduced to \nfigureheads.\n\nTo answer your question, and i am sorry for the long explination \nprior, people where trained as Samurai(as a prior post has said) by \nbeing born into a Samurai family. Both sexes where trained though \ndiffrently. Men where trained in horsemenship, kyudo( long bow) and \nkenjitsu(sword) amoung other unarmed techniques such as Aikido, \njujitsu, ect. Woman on the other hand where taught Niganata(long \nspear with curved blade) the use of tanto, and other small knives and \nalso horsemenship(the japanese name escapes me at the moment) and \nboth where taught Yarijitsu(spear).\n\nI hope that helps. Another point to make is that unlike medival \nknights, who where given power to an extent i.e. a lord would pay for \nthier training and armor ect, while still not giving him power in and \nof himself. the Bushi in effect, after the gempei war half took it \nand half where given it, as the nobles felt that they should still \nrun the country from kyoto but as the latter periods of unrest proved\nthe Bushi really controlled the goings on of the country(while still \npaying yearly homage to the Emporer).\n\nAtsi Kazuri \n&gt; \n&gt; Why were some people trained as samurais, and not all?  As in with \n&gt; knights, they are usally part of a nobel family and so on.  Oh were \n&gt; everybody trained as samurai?\n\n\n\n"
