In kendo we usually refer to the shorter\none as\n&quot;Kodachi&quot;. Both Bokuto and Kodachi are used in kendo kata.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Tiago de Caux&quot; &lt;tcaux@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, April 03, 2004 4:40 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] While were on the Sword subject\n\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;     I was wondering, Ive seen people refering to a bokuto as a bokken or\n&gt; vice-versa. Whats the difference between the two names? And question\n&gt; number two, does the wooden Shoto have a special name? Like the wooden\n&gt; daito is the bokuto (or bokken)?
