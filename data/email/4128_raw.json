Some more details are probably what&#39;s needed \nto help someone help you find out the history. What kind of helmet \nis it (do you know the name? Can you describe it?) About how old \nis it? What exactly is the family crest that is on the armor (do you \nknow the name? Can you describe it?)\n\nThere are several different Ando&#39;s with various different types of \nkamon.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n"
