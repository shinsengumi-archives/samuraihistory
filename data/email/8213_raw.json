I&#39;m a li=\r\nttle\nskeptical--it sounds like something out of Martial\nArts Illustrated or=\r\n something. Most images of samurai\nyou see preparing for a battle or a duel=\r\n have their\nhakama tied back with leggings to keep them out of the\nway (ass=\r\numing they aren&#39;t in armor, which would keep\nthe clothing out of the way by=\r\n definition.) Kobakama,\nor shorter, tighter hakama, were frequently worn wh=\r\nen\n&quot;expecting action&quot;. \n\nWere hakama worn exclusively by the samurai class,=\r\n\nthen maybe I could see your answer making sense. But\nhow would that explai=\r\nn nagabakama, worn by courtiers\nand samurai during court functions? I&#39;m no =\r\nclothing\nhistorian, but I know we&#39;ve got some here. Tony? Lady\nSolveig? Car=\r\ne to enlighten us further? \n\nOf course, I could just look at Tony&#39;s website=\r\n: \n\nhttp://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html\n\n&quot;Hakama worn by commoners =\r\nand laborers in Heian were\ntwo panel, and typically only reached to the mid=\r\n-calf\nor a bit lower. During the sixteenth century,\nlow-class warriors ofte=\r\nn wore a knee-length two- or\nthree-panel hakama which were sometimes called=\r\n\nkobakama, a terminology problem as regular hakama were\nalso called kobakam=\r\na in the Edo period owing to the\nformal nagabakama being the =93formal=94 n=\r\norm.&quot;\n\nIf hakama were being worn by commoners and laborers,\nthen I hardly t=\r\nhink a critical part of their design\nwould be to hide the movement of the l=\r\negs from an\nopponent. \n\nContinuing: \n\n&quot;Earlier hakama, unlike modern martia=\r\nl arts hakama,\nhad two clearly defined legs, rather than having the\npleats =\r\noverlapping left and right so that one can=92t\ntell where one leg ends and =\r\nthe other begins. Another\nmodern feature is the koshita, the solid panel at=\r\n the\nsmall of the back. This seems to have appeared\nsometime in the early E=\r\ndo period or at the earliest in\nthe very late days of the sixteenth century=\r\n, as\nearlier hakama were merely cut straight across the\nback as at the fron=\r\nt.&quot;\n\nIf these things were developed in the Edo period, and\nhakama were bein=\r\ng worn in the Heian period, then they\ncould hardly be part of the developme=\r\nnt of hakama. \n\nI&#39;d still like to see what Tony and others have to\nsay. \n\n_=\r\n_________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of s=\r\npam?
