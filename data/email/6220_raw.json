Well, that&#39;s not at all the way I&#39;d describe\n&gt; it, Nate, but I have a\n&gt; sneaking suspicion that you would regard my answer\n&gt; to that question as a\n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot;\n\nThe sword itself--not your practice of the art. \n\n\n&gt; ...Sure, my swords let me know if they haven&#39;t been\n&gt; used in too long, but\n&gt; it&#39;s not as if they have to be used _on_ somebody. \n\n*cocked eyebrow* Um, and HOW exactly do they do this?\n\n&gt; \tAnd your point would be...?\n\nYou asked me what my criteria was. Or rather, you were\noffended without knowing the criteria. So I gave it to\nyou. \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I choose Main Battle Tank. Mine&#39;s an M1A2--yours?\n&gt; \tY&#39;know, I had a strong suspicion you were going to\n&gt; take this kind of\n&gt; unsporting attitude. \n\nUnsporting? Not at all. It&#39;s only fair for each of us\nto use something we are trained with, correct? My\nbackground is with tanks. Hence, my choice of weapon.\nUse a sword if you wish. It&#39;s magical soul will\nprotect you from 120mm APFSDS-T, I&#39;m sure. \n\n  There&#39;s\n&gt; only one weapon suited for a civilised disagreement\n&gt; between gentlemen:  the\n&gt; sword.  It&#39;s the Mythically Correct solution.\n&gt; \t...Of course, if you&#39;re going to remind me that\n&gt; neither of us could in fact\n&gt; be considered a gentleman under the very definitions\n&gt; I&#39;m calling for (and it\n&gt; would be just like you to do that), then I&#39;ll have\n&gt; no more telling response\n&gt; than to run like hell (unless I can arrange to be\n&gt; closer to you than you are\n&gt; to your M1A2 when our negotiations reach this\n&gt; unhappy stage).\n\nCloser won&#39;t help you--you&#39;d have to know how to start\nthe thing. :)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
