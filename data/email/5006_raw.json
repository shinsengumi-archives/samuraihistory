The seppuku I described was, as taught to be, the \n&gt;way it would be done given the best possible situation.  High ranking \n&gt;official given the opportunity to have a kaishaku.\n&gt;  I would love to discuss the philosophy (or lack thereof) in seppuku with \n&gt;you if you feel up to it.\n\nWell, I&#39;m always up for a conversation where I&#39;m bound to learn \nsomething. :) I just feel like this subject is dangerous water to get \ninto, especially on a mailing list where noone actually knows each \nother. People have these preconceived notions that they&#39;ve learned \nfrom so many various sources (academics, movies, novels, martial arts \nteachers, etc.) that it always seems like a conversation that is bound \nto explode.\n\nAnd that in fact is one of my own points - the &#39;meaning of seppuku&#39; \nis so widely talked about and sometimes blithely thrown about that I \nthink people tend to lose sight of the actual history, physics, \nbiology, etc. of the thing. That&#39;s where I am coming from on this \ndiscussion.\n\nBut if we both promise to be gentlemen (I&#39;m not sure if I can uphold \nmy partof the promise. :) ) I&#39;d enjoy a serious and honest \ndiscussion on the matter, for sure.\n\nSo -- how to kick the conversation off?\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
