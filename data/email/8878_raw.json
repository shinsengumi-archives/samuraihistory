I&#39;m a\n&gt; figurepainter and I have just started my first set of Samurais. I&#39;m  \n&gt; not\n&gt; sure about the banners they are wearing on the back. You can see the\n&gt; set I&#39;m painting here:\n&gt; http://www.plasticsoldierreview.com/Review.asp?manu=ZVE&code=8025\n&gt; In the boxart on front af the box, they seem all different, but on the\n&gt; back of the box (not vissible on the website) there are a picture of\n&gt; some painted figures, here they are all the same ? It says in the text\n&gt; on the website, that the banner tell what army they belong to.\n&gt; Could anyone tell what is the right thing, then I would be very happy.\n\nIt all depends on what sort of relationship you want to portray. If  \nyou want to portray your figures as belonging to the same group, then  \npaint the sashimono banners (the banners on poles behind their back)  \nand the little banners on the back of their helmets more or less the  \nsame. The sashimono banners should probably have kamon on them. The  \nlittle helmet banners probably should not.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
