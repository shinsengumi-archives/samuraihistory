(No, lol, I don&#39;t mean as \nin &#39;chase&#39; them...)\n\nLizzie\nThere&#39;s some 30,000 current active members within the SCA not to mention \nassociate people (non paid) - whom I was for 5 years (currently an active &#39;paid&#39; \nmember for 2 years) - along with another couple of thousand folks who are semi \nactive but not current. Which would make the SCA one of the (if not the) \nlargest re-enactment societies with a world wide base. I would hazard to guess that \nthe UK Sealed Knot and other English Civil War Societies would be next at \n6,000 actives (including children).\n\nBeing in the SCA is similiar to most other re-enactment societies or groups \nwith an opportunity to &#39;recreate&#39; living history - in combat, day to day \nliving, etc.\nAnd I would also guess based on personal experience with others both on and \noff this list - that many people have &#39;explored&#39; one or more &#39;personas&#39; with in \nthe SCA - being myself both interested in western and eastern culture.\nAs a member of the SCA - I&#39;ve been able to actively pursue (with others of \nsimiliar interest)- blacksmithing, armoursmithing, period woodworking, heavy \ncombat, leatherworking, archery, casting, and more....\n\nIf you have some real interest in the SCA you can get some answers at \nwww.sca.org - or search for a local group in your area.\n\nKyostti,\nCompany of Rakehells\nButtlers Dragoons\nHouse of Sir Rashid\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
