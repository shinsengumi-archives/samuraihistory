Masaaki Hatsumi is in the film and this is sufficient for me.   Ea=\r\nch one is free to administer its knowledge as want.  \n \nOr =BFit is that pe=\r\nrhaps did You more than Hayes by the Budo Taijutsu?  Hayes will be wrong in=\r\n his vision,  but by him many people knew to Sensei and they went to Japon =\r\nto study true Budo.  Malstrolm as example.\n \nHow important is Hayes for the=\r\n Bujinkan?  The people who train in the Bujinkan, do that - I think- from h=\r\neart not because they have a shorter curved saber, it does not matter it of=\r\n form but it of fund.  \n \nIn my country we have a thought: &quot;when the words =\r\nare not better than the silence, is better to silence&quot;.  I recommend you se=\r\ne the film and train dogs, not martial arts. Not with a heart closed.\n \nHel=\r\nly\n\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; escribi=F3:\n\n--- ahelly69 &lt;ahelly=\r\n69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This proyect was made by Mr. Brandon Alvarez and is\n=\r\n&gt; based in a deep \n&gt; research and interviews with real ninja masters like\n&gt;=\r\n Dr. Masaaki \n&gt; Hatsumi, Stephen K.
