Just out of idle curiousity, do you have a general idea of what the heaviest armor you have worked with was? I imagine you&#39;ve seen as much armor as anyone in the west.\nThe heaviest I&#39;ve examined firsthand was an Edo period ceremonial O-Yoroi that the owner had tagged at 42.5 kg.\nBy contrast, my father-in-law&#39;s family armor is 19.6 kg (including the armor box).\n\n\n\n"
