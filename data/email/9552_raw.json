I have read a few short\n&gt; ones that I have e=\r\nnjoyed.\n\n \n\nMy favorites include:  \n\n \n\n*\tBushido, [text is online at http:=\r\n//www.sacred-texts.com/shi/bsd/index.htm &lt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/b=\r\nsd/index.htm&gt;  , other sources, or may be purchased from most any bookstore=\r\n]\n*\tHagakure,[.pdf file online at http://digilander.libero.it/Aragorn_the_D=\r\nunedan/files/miscellanea/samurai_cr.pdf &lt;http://digilander.libero.it/Aragor=\r\nn_the_Dunedan/files/miscellanea/samurai_cr.pdf&gt; , other sources, or may be =\r\npurchased from most any bookstore]\n*\tThe Life Giving Sword, [I couldn&#39;t qui=\r\nckly find an online version to post, but it may be purchased from most book=\r\nstores]\n*\tGo Rin No Sho,  [http://www.samurai.com/5rings/ &lt;http://www.samur=\r\nai.com/5rings/&gt; , other sources, or may be purchased from most bookstores]\n=\r\n*\tand others.\n\n\n&gt;      I am confused on the issue of Budo.  My understandin=\r\ng is that it is a philosophical path in Japanese martial tradition, roughly=\r\n\n&gt; meaning finding the way through martial practice.  I keep seeing people =\r\nwho say their fighting style is Budo.  Can someone explain\n&gt; this to me?\n\nA=\r\n  &quot;Budo Charter&quot; was established on April 23, 1987 by Japanese Budo Associa=\r\ntion (Nippon Budo Shingikai).  It&#39;s introduction states:\n\n \n\nBudo, rooted i=\r\nn the martial spirit of ancient Japan, is an aspect of traditional culture =\r\nthat has evolved from jyutsu to do through centuries of historical and soci=\r\nal change.\n\n \n\nFollowing the concept of unity of mind and technique, budo h=\r\nas developed and refined a discipline of austere training which promotes et=\r\niquette, skillful technique, physical strength, and the unity of mind and b=\r\nody. Modern Japanese have inherited these values and they play a prominent =\r\nrole in forming Japanese personalities. In modern Japan the budo spirit is =\r\na source of powerful energy and promotes a pleasant disposition in the indi=\r\nvidual.\n\n \n\nToday, budo has been diffused throughout the world and has attr=\r\nacted strong interest internationally. However, infatuation with mere techn=\r\nical training, and undue concern with winning is a severe threat to the ess=\r\nence of budo. To prevent this perversion of the art, we must continually ex=\r\namine ourselves and endeavor to perfect and preserve this national heritage=\r\n.\n\n \n\nIt is with this hope that we establish the BUDO CHARTER in order to u=\r\nphold the fundamental principles of traditional budo.\n\n \n\nMY paraphrase of =\r\nthis charter is:\n\n \n\nBudo, literally &quot;martial way&quot; is rooted in the warrior=\r\n spirit of ancient Japan.  It is a part of the culture of Japan that has ev=\r\nolved from Japanese &quot;traditional ways and practices&quot; (jyutsu), to become &quot;a=\r\n way to journey through life&quot;-- a calling (do), through centuries of histor=\r\nical and social change.\n\n \n\nBudo follows the idea of congruity of thought a=\r\nnd action, that is, a purposeful unification of mind and physical technique=\r\n.  Budo has developed and refined various disciplines of rigorous training =\r\nthat promote etiquette (respectful civil behavior) , skillful technique (po=\r\nlished and experienced action), physical strength and vigor, and the unity =\r\nof mind and body (a congruous melding of the body&#39;s action with the mind&#39;s =\r\nintentions). \n\n \n\nBudo has been diffused throughout the world and has attra=\r\ncted strong international interest. Infatuation with mere technical prowess=\r\n and undue concern with winning however poses a severe threat to the basic =\r\nnature of budo. To prevent this misuse of the art we must continually exami=\r\nne ourselves and endeavor to perfect and preserve the purposes of budo, Jap=\r\nan&#39;s national heritage.\n\n \n\nIt is with this hope that we establish the Prin=\r\nciples of Budo in order to uphold the fundamental purposes of traditional b=\r\nudo.\n\n \n\nPrinciples of Budo\n\n \n\nARTICLE 1: OBJECTIVE\n\n \n\nThe objective of b=\r\nudo is to cultivate character.  To improve the ability of the individual to=\r\n make value judgments and to foster a well disciplined and capable individu=\r\nal, budo makes use of physical and mental training utilizing ancient and mo=\r\ndern martial techniques.\n\n \n\nARTICLE 2: KEIKO\n\n \n\nThe meaning of keiko incl=\r\nudes &quot;to think and to practice old subjects&quot; and implies that one must ment=\r\nally purpose and physically emulate the teachings of the rigorous training =\r\nundertaken.  When practicing daily one must constantly follow respectful de=\r\ncorum, adhere to the fundamentals of technique, and resist the temptation t=\r\no merely pursue physical technical skill rather than the purposeful unifica=\r\ntion of mind and physical technique.\n\n \n\nARTICLE 3: SHIAI\n\n \n\nIn competitio=\r\nn (shiai), and in the performance of basic forms training (kata), one must =\r\nmanifest budo spirit, exert one&#39;s self to one&#39;s maximum, win with modesty, =\r\naccept defeat gracefully, and constantly exhibit temperate, self-restrained=\r\n attitudes.\n\n \n\nARTICLE 4: DOJO\n\n \n\nThe &quot;way place&quot; (dojo) is a place ordai=\r\nned for training one&#39;s mind and body. Here one must maintain discipline, pr=\r\noper etiquette, and respectful formality. The training area must be a solem=\r\nn, clean, safe and dignified environment.\n\n \n\nARTICLE 5: TEACHING\n\n \n\nIn or=\r\nder to be an effective teacher budo instructors should always strive to cul=\r\ntivate the instructor&#39;s personal character, and further the instructor&#39;s ow=\r\nn skill and discipline of mind and body. The instructor should not be swaye=\r\nd by winning or losing or display arrogance about possessing any superior s=\r\nkill.  Rather, the instructor should retain the attitudes suitable for a bu=\r\ndo role model.\n\n \n\nARTICLE 6: PRESENTATION\n\n \n\nWhen presenting budo, one sh=\r\nould follow traditional values, seek substantial training, contribute to re=\r\nsearch, and give one&#39;s total effort to perfect and preserve this traditiona=\r\nl art.  One should also have an understanding and be mindful of varying int=\r\nernational points of view.\n\n \n\n&gt; &quot;Finding the way&quot; is also a bit off the ma=\r\nrk of MOST martial philosophies as it is not the path one is after but the =\r\ndestination; the paths can be many roads/ways leading to the same goal (eg.=\r\n mastery of the self).\n\n&quot;Popular budo&quot; may not seek the &quot;way&quot; of Budo, it m=\r\nay seek only the destination or acquisition of rank or technique; but a tru=\r\ne &quot;do&quot; or &quot;Way&quot; is a life&#39;s purpose or path.  To use a western concept...&quot;s=\r\nuccess is a journey not a destination.&quot;\n\n \n\nIs Budo merely &quot;a philosophical=\r\n path in a Japanese martial tradition&quot;?  It may be.  It may be just another=\r\n technique to learn.  It may be being able to defend one&#39;s self.  It may be=\r\n becoming the best at a technique.  It may be winning at all costs.  It may=\r\n be seeking enlightenment through the application of the martial arts to on=\r\ne&#39;s daily life.  One&#39;s martial &quot;Way&quot; will be different for each individual.=\r\n  BUT the &quot;martial way&quot;--budo--is a journey of discovery and not merely the=\r\n acquisition of technique.  That is more properly termed a jyutsu.  One get=\r\ns to determine for one&#39;s self what his &quot;martial way&quot; will become and what j=\r\nyutsu one will study and make use of.\n\n \n\nBut that&#39;s just MY understanding =\r\nof it.\n\n \n\nChristopher\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n\n\n"
