Any idea\n&gt; as to\n&gt; &gt; the Shokaku, Zuikaku, Shoho, Zuiho, Soryu, Hiryu,\n&gt; &gt; Akagi?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t recognize any of the words...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate:\n&gt; \n&gt; The Kaga was originally launched as a battleship in\n&gt; 1926, and so was named\n&gt; after a province like the other battleships. She\n&gt; wasn&#39;t modified into a\n&gt; carrier till 1935. The Akagi was also originally\n&gt; built as a battle cruiser\n&gt; and converted to a CV, so her name isn&#39;t consistent\n&gt; with Japanese CV names.\n&gt; \n&gt; The &quot;ry�&quot; was common in CVs; it means &quot;dragon.&quot;\n&gt; Other common elements in CV\n&gt; names were &quot;kaku&quot; (crane), &quot;h�&quot; (phoenix), and &quot;sh�&quot;\n&gt; (soar).\n&gt; \n&gt; S�ryu is &quot;blue dragon&quot;; Hiry� is &quot;flying dragon&quot;;\n&gt; Sh�kaku is &quot;soaring\n&gt; crane&quot;; Sh�h� is &quot;soaring phoenix&quot;; Zuikaku is\n&gt; &quot;felicitous crane.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
