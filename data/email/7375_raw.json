There are &quot;some&quot; \nchinese, mongol and japanese groups (as there are groups based in \nfantasy) within the SCA but these are a small percentage.\n\nI have been in the SCA on and off since 1981 and have had people \nactually talk me out of a samurai persona because they really are a \nstretch according to the definition of the SCA.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ninjabattle&quot; &lt;ninjabattle@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; i asked a question a while back and i dont think anyone got what i \nwas \n&gt; asking.... &quot; I would like to know if there are any organizations that \n&gt; support the samurai way of life and are somewhat like a clan&quot; I \nlooked \n&gt; at the S.C.A but it was some european thing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
