Okay, let us in on the joke - my Chinese is even more limited\nthan my Japanese.  (Which is essentially nonexistent, aside from some\nmartial & historical terminology.)\nOn the other hand - as a clever segue into my quick note to James Wilson -\nmy English is pretty good.  And as the son and grandson of elementary school\nteachers, I feel obliged - compelled, even - to add another condemnation of\nthe kind of spelling and sentence structure you&#39;ve been exhibiting.  I\nthought it was stupid before I found out your chosen occupation (assuming\nyou were serious about that).  Now I think it&#39;s plain criminal.  Do you mind\ntelling us where you&#39;re working on your credential, so we can send them\ncopies of your correspondence to be used as evidence against you?  This is\nserious abuse of your native tongue, sir.  No joke.  It&#39;s hard not to see it\nas an insult to your intended profession.  And, likewise, it&#39;s hard not to\nsee it as an insult to any literate people you happen to be addressing...\nand there&#39;s a certain number of us out here.\n\tGereg\n\n   Date: Thu, 02 Dec 2004 18:36:05 -0600\n   From: Anthony Bryant &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Samurai wannabees and influences Re: new subject\n\nNate Ledbetter wrote:\n\n&gt; God, the\n&gt; look on their faces is priceless when you tell them\n&gt; &quot;Bu hao, wo bu xiang ni&quot; :)\n\n*snip*\n&gt; I&#39;m not\n&gt; a teacher.
