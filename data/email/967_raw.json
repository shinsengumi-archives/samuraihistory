There is a non-fictional book about his\n&gt;life entitled HIDEYOSHI by Mary Elizabeth Berry.  It is not too bad.\n&gt;I used it for a history term paper last year.  About how he died.  I\n&gt;do not know the details of it, but I believe he died of natural\n&gt;causes at a fairly old age.  If I am wrong someone please correct\n&gt;me.  I would like to know the details of his death as well if any\n&gt;knows.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;---\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
