I appreciate the clarifications.  I \nstarted\n&gt; training in the Bujinkan in the early/mid 80&#39;s.  I have no \nillusions about\n&gt; Stephen Hayes.  While I would certainly agree that he had his own\n&gt; interpretation of Ninjutsu, he did bring the art to the United \nStates in a\n&gt; big way.  So let&#39;s give him some credit.  One can certainly see \nhim going\n&gt; his own direction in &quot;Ninja Realms of Power&quot;.  While I stop short \nof calling\n&gt; him a fraud, I do think it wise that any information from him be \ncross\n&gt; checked.  I had a long gap in trianing and came back a few years \nago.  When\n&gt; I did, I found that there were many holes in my knowledge and many \npeices of\n&gt; infomrtion I found to be incorrect.  Some of that, I suppose could \nbe\n&gt; attributed to Hayes.  However, I think that at the time a good \nportion of it\n&gt; was that we just plain do not live in Japan and get impressions \n(not just\n&gt; from Hayes) and 2nd and 3rd hand information.\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being an excellent martial artist and a \nmiserable, hack historian.  He&#39;s probably a great guy, and probably \nan excellent martial artist. I have no issues with that part of his \nlife, and I doubt anyone here does either. But he is most definately \nnot only not a historian, but he invents fiction to suit his needs. \nI think the issue over the past 24 hours might be that people were \noffended that Hayes was insulted. Well, like I said, he might very \nwell be an excellent martial artist and instructor, but as far as \nscholarship goes, he is a fiction writer at best.\n\n\n\n"
