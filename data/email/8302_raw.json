He was a Japanese director who took some of his\n&gt;inspiration from Western sources.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhy not? If some random American director closely followed the style and \nplots of  Mizoguchi or Ozu even if he made the settings American he \nwould probably be known as a &#39;Japanese&#39; director. Kurosawa films are \ngreat as films but weak on history and place many times.\n\n&gt;You are absolutely correct that film are not really good guides to actual\n&gt;history. Both films, in many ways, deal with mythologies. But the\n&gt;mythologies come from different cultures, different sources. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIn the case of several of the Kurosawa chanbara films the myths are \nwestern, King Lear, MacBeth and Red Harvest. So your watching western \nmyths in this case. Once again not good for studying historic Japan.\n\n&gt;SEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the noble ronin who helps\n&gt;peasants. When in fact, most Japanese ronin were mostly interested in\n&gt;connecting with a clan. And they saw themselves as being apart from and\n&gt;superior to the farmers. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSince I&#39;m actually not sure of Kurosawa&#39;s source for the plot for this \none, I won&#39;t make any definitive statements.  The noble ronin who helps \npeasants doesn&#39;t play much of a role in traditional stories, why would \nyou think its Japanese in this case?\n\n&gt;However, the realities from which these mythologies spring from are quite\n&gt;different. Once again: 19th century Western gunfighters were not the same at\n&gt;all as 17th century Japanese ronin.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNever said they were. Just that Kurosawa&#39;s chanbara films are more \ngrounded in Western roots than in Japanese roots on the average. His \nfilms about modern subject are more distinctly Japanese with plot \nresolutions that most Americans won&#39;t enjoy. A good example would be \n&#39;The Bad Sleep Well&quot;.\n\nJim Eckman\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
