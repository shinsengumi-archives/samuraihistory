But\nthat is what they are :\nreplicas.   Our swords are mostly made for Iaido and\nKendo practice, usually to practice tameshigiri.  \nThis, because a real sword is considered as a master\npiece and in their time they were tested, so it is not\nnecesary to test them again.\nBesides, it is unthinkable that a regualar Iaido or\nKendo Sensei will employ a real blade for this kind of\npractice. ( Although I have heard that some japanese\nSensei use real blades, mostly beacause they are from\nSamurai families, so a real sword is part of their\nheritage ).\nAlso keep in mind that; is very hard that a now days\nblade is very hard to be considered as made as in the\nold days, even if it is hand made.   Perhaps Mr.\nSinclaire can help us here.  There are many things to\nconsider here :  Kinds of steel, techniques employed\nin the forge process and even the enviroment\ntemperature and humidity plays an important role.  \nAnd just to say someones.\n\nBest regards. \n   \n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n"
