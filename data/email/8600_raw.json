When someone says the =\r\n&quot;sword just isn&#39;t that important&quot; and that &quot;its more of a weapon of last re=\r\nsort&quot;. And if you had read the post &quot;meaning&quot; you would have seen I was say=\r\ning that in the &quot;waring states&quot; era you didn&#39;t know what your opponent woul=\r\nd be armed with or if he&#39;d be on foot and there could have been more then o=\r\nne, there could have been 3 or 5. And if you thought the sword was a last r=\r\nesort, you&#39;d better had a gun or your one dead dumdass.   Musashi and Ito I=\r\nttosai knew this and thy&#39;re famous! And kendo was formed around Ito&#39;s techi=\r\nngs, but when poeple got worried about their &quot;moneybags&quot; they softed it up.=\r\n\n       So thanks you for pissing me off day!\n  \n\nBarbara Nostrand &lt;nostran=\r\nd@...&gt; wrote:\n  Hi again\n\n&gt;  &gt;anything! You didn&#39;t even opponent would =\r\nbe on foot he could have\n&gt;  &gt;came at you on horseback! How effective would =\r\nany of our fancy\n&gt;  &gt;modern sword styles have been, back then? While we wer=\r\ne still edging\n&gt;  &gt;our toes forward gauging the distance between our swords=\r\n... some\n&gt;  &gt;armored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with his spear!&quot;=\r\n\n\nWhile some of the footwork techniques of kend=F4 do not work particularly=\r\n \nwell in some of the conditions described, I think that the analysis \nimpl=\r\nicit above is based on modern ideas about warfare. In a LOT of \npre-modern =\r\nwarfare you didn&#39;t just go around willy nilly killing \neverybody in sight. =\r\nIn Western Europe, a man at arms could get himself \nhung by his own lord fo=\r\nr killing an enemy knight! In Japan, it was \noften important to identify yo=\r\nur opponent before killing him or to even \ncapture him alive so that he or =\r\nhis head could be exhibited for the \nreward. Also, despite anything that ke=\r\nnd=F4 instructors might tell you, \nswords just were not that important. The=\r\ny were seldom the primary \nweapon. Rather, they were generally a weapon of =\r\nlast resort. The \nbusiness about toe edging and maintaining distance does m=\r\nake sense in \nthe context of dueling during the Edo period.\n\n\n[Non-text por=\r\ntions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Ficti=\r\non contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives=\r\n: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafesh=\r\nops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAH=\r\nOO!
