The \n&gt; caption reads &quot;Scene of Nagamasa&#39;s seppuku, directly\n&gt; outside Odani&#39;s Apartment.&quot; \n&gt;  Two questions: is it the site of Asai&#39;s seppuku and\n&gt; what exactly IS &quot;Odani&#39;s \n&gt; Apartment&quot;?  The picture is here...\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.sho-shin.com/oda1.htm\n&gt; \n&gt;        It requires some scrolling to get to, though.\n&gt;  Thanx in advance for \n&gt; any info.  8-D\n&gt; \n&gt; L8r.\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
