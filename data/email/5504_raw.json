For over a thousand years\n&gt;  the sword w=\r\nas revered as the very soul of the samurai warriors who\n&gt;  wielded it, comm=\r\nanding awe, respect, and an almost religious\n&gt;  devotion.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The tumultuo=\r\nus events of modern Japanese history and the nation&#39;s\n&gt;  relentless drive t=\r\noward technological advancement, however,\n&gt;  irrevocably sealed the sword&#39;s=\r\n fate, and, along with the samurai\n&gt;  class, the sword became an anachronis=\r\nm, both culturally and\n&gt;  militarily.\n&gt;\n&gt;  As Japan entered a period of unp=\r\nrecedented Imperial expansion in the\n&gt;  early twentieth century, the Japane=\r\nse sword, despite its limited\n&gt;  practical effect, became a feature of the =\r\nsoldier&#39;s arsenal =97 an\n&gt;  echo of the mythical status it enjoyed in feuda=\r\nl times. The Yasukuni\n&gt;  swords emerged during the build-up to World War II=\r\n, in part to help\n&gt;  meet the huge demands of the Imperial Army, but more i=\r\nmportantly out\n&gt;  of a desire to preserve time-honored forging methods, and=\r\n to revive\n&gt;  the spirit of the samurai. For these reasons, they were notab=\r\nly\n&gt;  distinct from so-called &quot;Showa-to,&quot; which were mass-produced and\n&gt;  i=\r\nnferior in quality and artistry.\n&gt;\n&gt;  All swords were banned in the immedia=\r\nte aftermath of World War II,\n&gt;  and the decades that followed have seen a =\r\ndecline in the popularity\n&gt;  of Yasukuni swords, largely because of their a=\r\nssociations with that\n&gt;  war and the military. Another factor has been the =\r\nstigma attached to\n&gt;  Showa-to, which has helped to stereotype wartime swor=\r\nds in general.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Recent years, however, have seen a renewed interest in =\r\nthe surviving\n&gt;  Yasukuni swords. Many collectors and appraisers have ackno=\r\nwledged\n&gt;  the workmanship of these swords as displaying a perfect blend of=\r\n\n&gt;  technology and tradition, and a quality that can rival even that of\n&gt;  =\r\nthe great classical smiths.\n&gt;\n&gt;  In his tribute to the Yasukuni smiths, acc=\r\nlaimed photographer and\n&gt;  sword enthusiast Tom Kishida has compiled an ext=\r\nensive study of\n&gt;  these rare and exceptional swords, drawing on a variety =\r\nof sources\n&gt;  to shed light on this often little-understood chapter of Japa=\r\nnese\n&gt;  sword history.\n&gt;\n&gt;  With his unique eye for capturing the beauty of=\r\n the blades in his\n&gt;  photographs, he has provided the reader with the most=\r\n lavishly\n&gt;  detailed book on Yasukuni swords to date. This will be an impo=\r\nrtant\n&gt;  addition to the libraries of specialists and connoisseurs, and to\n=\r\n&gt;  those who wish to deepen their understanding of these fascinating\n&gt;  war=\r\ntime weapons.\n&gt;\n&gt;  September 9, 2004\n&gt;\n&gt;  The Yasukuni Swords by Tom Kishid=\r\na (Translated by Kenji Mishina)\n&gt;  Published by Kodansha International\n&gt;  $=\r\n45\n&gt;  4-7700-2754-0\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=3Dbook&id=3D17=\r\n7\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;  S=\r\namurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;  ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
