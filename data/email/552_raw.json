Since he was assassinated \nunexpectedly, an heir to the Oda family had yet to be chosen. After \nHideyoshi (then a general of the Oda) rushed to avenge Nobunaga&#39;s \ndeath, there was a big dispute about who would succeed him. \nNobunaga&#39;s eldest son Nobutada was killed during the attempt on his \nfather&#39;s life, so he was out of the question. The second and third \nsons (Nobukatsu and Nobutaka) were left to quarrel over who was \nworthy of succeeding Nobunaga. Hideyoshi&#39;s solution to this was to \nsuggest that Nobutada&#39;s son Samboshi should succeed him, since \nSamboshi was the eldest son of Nobunaga&#39;s eldest son, and thus had \nthe most direct lineage. (Hmm, did that sentence make sense? I hope \nso.) The problem was that Samboshi was still an infant, so he would \nneed regents to rule in his place until he grew old enough to take \nover. Hideyoshi&#39;s opinion eventually won out, and Hideyoshi himself \nended up as one of the regents ruling in Samboshi&#39;s place. Hideyoshi \ntook up the reins where Nobunaga left off, and through that position \nof power ended up playing a big role in the unification of Japan. So \nI guess that once Hideyoshi rose to power in his own right, the issue \nof who became head of the Oda family kind of just faded into the \nbackground. \n\nThat&#39;s all I know, and I doubt it&#39;s helpful, but I&#39;m sure the smarter \npeople here can clarify things (and tell me where I&#39;m wrong! -_^)\n\nSally\n\n\n\n"
