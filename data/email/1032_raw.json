However, for those of you \nwho didn&#39;t know, the fiction novel by James Clavell &#39;Shogun&#39; is based on actual \nhistory and characters.  (this was my introduction into the world of the \nsamurai, actually)  The main characters are all based on Tokugawa, Ieyasu, \nNobunaga, and the actual first Dutch ship to land in the Japans in 1598.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope I don&#39;t sound hopelessly out of touch with this information, but if \nyou would like to immerse yourself in the life that exsisted for the samurai \nduring this time, you might want to check this book out.  Also the mini-series \n(if you go to your local video store) although the book is better.  And if you \ndo please feel free to write me about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Enjoy!\n&gt; \n&gt; ***Also for all of your Japanese-English translation needs go to \nhttp://www.solon.org/cgi-bin/j-e\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Eagles may soar, but weasles don&#39;t get caught in jet engines.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
