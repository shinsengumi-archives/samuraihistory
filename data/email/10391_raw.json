Some of the &quot;translations&quot; look like the=\r\ny are either historical or glossary-like descriptions.\n\nThis FAQ:\nQ: I foun=\r\nd an error in your translation/scanlation/research. What do I do?\nA: Good f=\r\nor you! Please email me. \n\nThis makes me think that some of the translation=\r\ns are historical, and the Otate no Ran article is written in a way that sug=\r\ngests looking at historical sources.\nAdditionally, the glossary has an &quot;his=\r\ntorical/real people&quot; section.  And while not every entry completely matches=\r\n what the equivalent entry at Samurai Archives says, they appear to align w=\r\nell.\n\nThere are also &quot;sources&quot; at the bottom of many/most articles.  For Ot=\r\nate no Ran:\nhttp://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BE%A1%E9%A4%A8%E3%81%AE%E4%B9%=\r\nB1\nhttp://www.m-network.com/sengoku/uesugi/serious02.html\nhttp://www.asahi-=\r\nnet.or.jp/~ju8t-hnm/Shiro/Hokuriku/Niigata/Otate/index.htm\n\nI translated th=\r\ne wikipedia article (via google translate) and it was a pretty funny read. =\r\n \nThoughts?  Comments?\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kitsuno&quot; =\r\n&lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t done much more than click a fe=\r\nw links in there, but are these translations from a manga story or novel?  =\r\nI get the impression that it might be:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.asphodelshaven.com/t=\r\nranslations/faq\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zenblade=\r\n12&quot; &lt;dennis.mishler@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was digging around some mo=\r\nre, and happened upon this website:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.asphodelshaven.com/=\r\ntranslations/glossary/entry/otate_no_ran\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyone know if the inform=\r\nation contained within is accurate, or if this website is trustworthy?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; It has a lot of information regarding the Otate no ran that I had not =\r\nheard of before, but the Takeda aspects match with what I have heard about =\r\nKatsuyori deciding to support Kagekatsu.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; cheers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
