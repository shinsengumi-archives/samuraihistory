Sorry about that.\n       However, thanks to you and other American friends in this community, I&#39;m glad to learn and find more unknown word of English and increase the vocaburary.)\n   \n      In fact,  lastly, Buke,  Samurai were forced to become Governer, Policeman, Farmer, Businessmen, Teacher, etc , due to  the fact that New Meiji government formed and issued new constitution , resulted in non existence of occupation of Buke.  \n   \n     Before Meiji revolution ,  Buke  was the top rank of class next to Emperor, then Farmers, Merchants, etc.   However, after Meiji revolution, Buke class evolved to others like above mentioned.\n   \n     Now,  my next question is then  , does Emperor exist from now on ?\n      After Buke took over the power of reign firstly about 1,200 years ago, Emperor continued to alive , exist without doing  things but just doing the things related to religion  in somewhere in Kyoto.   And,  after WW II,  Emperor keep doing just smiling , eating with visiters from overseas\n sometimes  without the right to vote, because he was  appointed as the symbol \n   \n       In fact,  Japanese needed something like symbol , mercy , for the time being after collapse by WW II , however,   Japan recovered completely and now , most of Japanese don&#39;t need mercy, symbol any more.    So, one day, there will be no reason to exist .    Maybe, one day,  they are foreced\n to become just civilian and take some job to alive.\n   \n       How do you think ?\n   \n    Eddie\n\nTom Dowling &lt;vaevictis@...&gt; wrote:\n          \nThings tend not to vanish, rather evolve, or they are assimulated into something else. Roman Legions did not vanish: the quality of the army was diluted until the Western Empire fell to the barbarian tribes; the Vikings enjoyed much power until the black death arrived in Norway in 13th century,\n only for the few to survive to be conquered by Danes and Swedes. The class of &quot;Knights&quot; continued, but ceased to be a major force on the battlefield (perhaps think of the samurai after the Tokogawa shogunite). Longbows are weaponary, and would have become obsolete when there was something better,\n cheaper and easier to train mass infantry, i.e powder and lead to use Marx&#39;s terms. Same with cavalry. when armoured vehicles could be produced more reliably, quicker and cheaply, horses, cavalry ceased to be an important force on the battlefield. Just look at the first great war, most nations\n use cavalry (think of Lawerence of Arabia), but the second great war, scarcly a horse is photographed in the entire campaign. Soldiers and ruins? I think poor leadership leads to ruins - not soldiers per se.\n\nRegards T.

After that, Buke had been growing and increasing power\n gradualy. Buke did have stronger power than Emperor since Heisi ( Kiyomori Taira ) and followed by Genji ( Yoritomo ) , then Asikaga, warriors days to Nobunaga, Hideyosi, and Yeyasu Tokugawa ( Shogun ) for over 260 years, ruining Japan . Even under Buke, Emperor has been still aliving.However, at\n the end of Tokugawa , Edo era, Buke had been vanished completely and disappeared . Then, under new government , MEIJI, Emperor returned and started to ruin Japan again .Why did Buke vanish in Japanese history after 1,000 years since birth ?\n __________________________________________________________Ota nyt k\u001b$B&gt;-!W\u001b(Bytt\u001b$B&gt;-%b&gt;-%b\u001b(Bsi uuden sukupolven Windows Live palvelut!http://get.live.com[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] \n\n__________________________________________________________\nSee the most popular videos on the web \nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/115454061/direct/01/\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n                           \n \n\n \n---------------------------------\nPower up the Internet with Yahoo!
