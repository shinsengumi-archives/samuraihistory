I&#39;ve read the first five of them (Shinju, Bundori, The Way of the \nTraitor, The Concubine&#39;s Tattoo and The Samurai&#39;s Wife) and they&#39;re all great \nbooks from a story perspective.  (Someone like Tony could verify their historicity \nbetter than I.)\n       They&#39;re set during the reign of shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (Shinju set \nin approximately 1689 through to 1691 as of Samurai&#39;s Wife).  About the \nbiggest deviation from history -- and the biggest delight from a fiction standpoint \n-- is Sano&#39;s wife, Reiko, who is very much an ATYPICAL Japanese wife for the \ntime period, although their marriage is the traditional arranged one and \ndoesn&#39;t come until early in The Concubine&#39;s Tattoo.  The rest of the series is \nBlack Lotus, The Pillow Book of Lady Wisteria, The Dragon King&#39;s Palace and, \ncoming out I believe in March, is the so-far-titled ninth book, The Perfumed \nSleeve.  And yes, I plan to read them.  Rowland is of Japanese (I believe) and \nKorean descent.\n       Hope this helps!!!!!  8-D\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
