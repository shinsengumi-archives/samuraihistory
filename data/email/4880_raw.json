He&#39;s got an agenda, as\ndoes everyone. His Sun Zi Ping Fa (&quot;Art of War&quot;) is\nHORRIBLE, in my opinion. He attempts to take out all\nsense that it&#39;s a military strategy guide, and make it\ninto some pithy philosophical gobbledygook. Yes, it\nreflects the taoist and confucian philosophy of the\ntime Sun Zi wrote, but it&#39;s a book of strategy on how\nto defeat an enemy, not a morality play. His\ntranslation really turned me off--his actual\ntranslations may be okay (the word for word\ntranslation), but when he &quot;explains&quot; the text, it\ncomes out as philosphical hogwash. \n\nHaven&#39;t gone through his &quot;Japanese Art of War&quot;, etc.,\nbecause after reading his Sun Zi I&#39;m simply not\ninterested. It seems he&#39;s less concerned with any art\nof war, more concerned with contemplating his navel\nand becoming one with the Tao. I&#39;ve got no problem\nwith philosophers, but I do have a problem with\noverinjecting philosophy where it isn&#39;t. \n\n The one I have of the\n&gt; _Tao Te Ching_ in that style is by far the most\n&gt; illuminating I&#39;ve seen, as\n&gt; it makes sense of all the variations one finds in\n&gt; the other translations.\n&gt; (One English word beneath this character, seven\n&gt; words beneath the next - it\n&gt; captures the nuances in a way that makes a good deal\n&gt; of sense, and helps me\n&gt; to understand the logic patterns in the parent\n&gt; language.)\n\nWhich translation is that? I think I&#39;ve seen it, and\nyou&#39;re right, you catch a lot more that way. \n\nI can&#39;t help you too much with your Musashi\nquestions--I&#39;m not a Musashi officianado at all. But\nsomeone here will be able to aid, I&#39;m sure. \n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
