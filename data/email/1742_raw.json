I am working on a \nway to do that and think that I will within a couple of weeks.\n\nScott\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Carlo Tacchini&quot; \n&lt;TSUBAME1@T...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; So much time passed... I suggest this :\n&gt; - Do not make anything to the blade or the tang in order to discover\n&gt; better details or, worst, in order to let it sharper. Do not touch \nthe\n&gt; blade, clean it with paper nose tissue, maintain it in the scabbard\n&gt; cutting edge up. \n&gt; - Search for easy and near To-ken fun club, give it personally \n(without\n&gt; leaving them alone in their hands) for a first, direct kantei if \nthey\n&gt; agree to make it free. If they agree the blade is a traditional\n&gt; hand-made and is in recoverable conditions, ask for a qualified \ntogishi\n&gt; (polisher).\n&gt; -Get in touch with the togishi, asking for polish prices, usually \nXY U$\n&gt; at inch (both sides included) of the sharp part of the blade. At the\n&gt; finish of the work all the mystery of the blade will be unveiled.\n&gt; Personally, I gave to polisher also a blade that is not at present \nday\n&gt; an investment. The price paid and the polish was superior to the \nmarket\n&gt; price.\n&gt; But is a personal thought. To give back a blade to their dignity is \nfor\n&gt; me enough for the price paid...\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Messaggio originale-----\n&gt; Da: Scott Moore [mailto:sgmoore@e...] \n&gt; Inviato: domenica 11 maggio 2003 19.29\n&gt; A: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Oggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thank you for your information and thoughts. My mother-in-law \ntold me\n&gt; yesterday that her late husband was in New Guinea at the end of the \nwar,\n&gt; but\n&gt; travelled to Japan before returning to the states. She doesn&#39;t \nremember\n&gt; if\n&gt; he ever said where he obtained the swords.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;M. R.

In most cases the \nofficers\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; charge of the local military units would allow the soldiers to \npick\n&gt; through\n&gt; &gt; the piles and take what they wanted.  That is how my grandfather \ngot\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; rifle and sword.\n&gt; &gt;   Very rarely did a soldier kill an officer on the battlefield and\n&gt; take\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; sword then.  For two reasons.  One, killing an officer would \nrequire\n&gt; getting\n&gt; &gt; close enough to have killed all the other soldiers around him.  \nTwo,\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; were in the middle of a war, they would not have had time to bend \ndown\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; pick up a sword while avoiding flying bullets.\n&gt; &gt;   I hope that this helps you determine how the weapons were \nacquired.\n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt; more posts I read about it the more I believe that you have a very\n&gt; nice\n&gt; &gt; find.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peace,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Matt Williams\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; STOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*\n&gt; &gt; http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
