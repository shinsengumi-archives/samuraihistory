A daimyo ruled over a province \nand reported to the shogun, the military leader in Japan during the \nEdo period. During the Meiji restauration, the institution of the \ndaimyo was abolished and the provinces were replaced by prefectures. \nWhile The shogun was the highest Japanese military ruler during the \nKamakura and Edo period. Although the emperor was officially the head \nof the state, the shogun rulers had the actual power until the end of \nthe Edo period\n\n\n"
