To be frank Martial Arts as some one to day practices is now where near to what they where doing then. What most practice now is called sport art. It looks very simular but there is very lil simulatrities. I know this may hurt some of you MA buffs but do some research on the practices of ancient MA and then the governments. When looking at where a country came from you hear very little about MA. Like if you reviewed Japan or even China their histories where not shaped by MA but the best political moves or the best thought political moves by the leaders of the day. MA is a very deep part of these countries cultures but not what shaped their political views and moves.\n\n@...&gt; wrote:  \n\n--- Mateusz Ostrowski &lt;ostrowski75@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; But the politics were shaped by the martial arts.\n\nNo, they weren&#39;t--at least not nearly as much as by\nexpediency, a desire to secure and remain in power,\nsocioeconomic factors, etc. Tokugawa Ieyasu was not\nsome mystical warrior-monk who ran out and did a sword\nkata every time he had to make some critical political\ndecision. If anything, he was the ultimate pragmatist.\n\n\n&gt; The way they were thinking and planning was a\n&gt; &quot;fruit&quot; of their&#39;s commitment to martial arts. By\n&gt; the way, it wasn&#39;t only a martial art but the way of\n&gt; thinking. \n&gt;   Matt\n\nSpoken like you subscribe to &quot;Martial Arts\nIllustrated&quot;. Look, I&#39;m not saying that martial arts\nexperience wouldn&#39;t have aided a decision or two, but\nit&#39;s ridiculous to say that Shinkage-ryu, or any\nmartial art, was the basis of the Tokugawa political\nconstruct. Inspired politician, great leader, and good\ngeneral--Tokugawa was all of these. Mystical martial\narts warrior king? Not so much. Considering at the end\nof his life he was fairly fat, I&#39;m not sure he did\nmuch training beyond the &quot;tempura-do&quot; school. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
