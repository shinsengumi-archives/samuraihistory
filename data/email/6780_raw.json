Were\nthey essentially interchangable? Why has samurai become the most\ncommonly used term these days, when most of the history books I have use\nthe term bushi, and you&#39;d think with all the nonsense out there about\nbushido that bushi would be the one people would be most familiar with?\nDoes samurai simply sound &quot;cooler&quot; and more Japanese?\n\nThanks, \nAngus\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
