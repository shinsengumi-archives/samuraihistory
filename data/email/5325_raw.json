They flash up and disappear, I\nsuspect its a conflict of some sort, probably with the special text\nenlarging and speech out package, that&#39;s what normally mucks everything\nup on this machine.\n\nAs I think I&#39;ve taken up enough band width with this one for the time\nbeing, I&#39;m going to try to get some one in to look at my config, to see\nif it can be sorted out. Meanwhile, back to things Japanese and\nhistorical:-)\n\nMuch thanks for all your help.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\nSounds of man throwing large rocks at computer grrr....\n\n\n"
