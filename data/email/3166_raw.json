Think that if Kenshin had a blade\nable to cut a Teppo, most likely Shingen&#39;s fan would be cut in their\nfamous fight, changing Japan&#39;s history, hehehe...     \n\n ----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: Barry Thomas [mailto:warlord@...] \nInviato: sabato 17 gennaio 2004 12.46\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Slicing rifle barrels\n\nTom, Carlo,\nThanks for your comments.  With 40 years of reading under my belt heaven\nknows\nwhere I read that snippet, but it IS stuck in my memory.  Often I find\nit better\nto comment while something is current, rather than wait the x months it\ntakes\nfor me to find it in my archives and give the reference long after the\nthread is\nas cold as rigor mortis!!  I could have read it in the English To-ken\nSociety&#39;s\n&quot;Programme&quot;, but I will keep an eye out for it as I trawl my books and\njournals.\n\nJust before sending this I did a google search using &quot;uesugi kenshin&quot;\nthinking I\nmight find the gun-slicing story - but, alas - I found instead some\n1,530 hits\nand gave up almost before I&#39;d started.  However, this might be\ninteresting\nstaright off for those with a particular interest in kenshin:\n\nhttp://www.nbz.or.jp/eng/uesugibio.htm\n\nBest regards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\nCarlo wrote:\n&gt; O-Kanehira at the times of Kenshin most likely was\n&gt; in possess of the Ikeda family, accordingly to their records.\n\n Tom Helm wrote:\n&gt; Barry et al-\n&gt; You know I have a number of books focused on famous generals and their\n&gt; swords. I tend to focus my studies on the Historical aspects of\n&gt; Nihonto. I have heard some tall tales but never this one. I have a\nlong\n&gt; to-do list but will try to look into it. If you do find a reference I\n&gt; should be very interested to hear it.\n&gt; -t\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\nYahoo!
