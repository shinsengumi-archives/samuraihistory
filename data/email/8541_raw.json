I believe the sword used in Mishima&#39;s seppuku was a Magoroku \n&gt;Kanemoto, the nidai - second generation - of the Muromachi period ca 1500 \n&gt;[He produced swords from Meio (1492) to the end of  Daie (1528)].  While \n&gt;searching for confirmation for this I came across the following link which \n&gt;may be an interesting read about katana for non-sword readers:\n&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/japanese-sword\n&gt;\n&gt;I came across this link which seems to be similar to the above but with a \n&gt;slightly different layout.  It mentions Yukio Mishima in a list of famous \n&gt;users of katana, the list also being in the above reference but without \n&gt;Mishima&#39;s name:\n&gt;http://www.search.com/reference/Katana\n&gt;\n&gt;Here is the list of famous katana users:\n&gt;\n&gt;Famous historic katana users\n&gt;---------------------------------------------\n&gt;  Ashikaga Yoshiteru\n&gt;Tsukahara Bokuden\n&gt;Iizasa Ienao\n&gt;Miyamoto Musashi\n&gt;Sasaki Kojiro\n&gt;Okita Soji\n&gt;Saito Hajime\n&gt;Yukio Mishima\n&gt;\n&gt;Very interesting that Yukio Mishima should be included in a list of famous \n&gt;sword users when Hakudo Nakayama in the early-mid 20th century was a far \n&gt;more famous swordsman.  But then, he didn&#39;t to my knowledge cut anyone!!\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Simon&quot; at \n&gt;http://www.vill.yamanakako.yamanashi.jp/cgi-bin/ekbc/kb.cgi/~vdocs/vill/docs/bbs?b=que_e&c=l&num=15 \n&gt;asks (30 August 2005):\n&gt; &gt;Does anyone know what became of Mishima Yukio&#39;s katana which was made\n&gt; &gt;by the famous swordmaker Kanemoto II (known as &quot;seki no Magoroku&quot;)?\n&gt; &gt;This was, of course, the sword used to decapitate both Mishima and\n&gt; &gt;Morita during their seppuku rituals and, as such, was probably\n&gt; &gt;immediately confiscated by the Tokyo police as evidence. I wonder if\n&gt; &gt;it was subsequently destroyed or returned to Mishima&#39;s widow?\n&gt;\n&gt;So, having reasonably established it was the 2nd generation Kanemoto and \n&gt;not the 27th, I leave the list to follow its course...\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;Barry Thomas\n&gt;(Melbourne, Australia)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Paul Martin&quot; &lt;pmartin6@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, March 15, 2006 1:25 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Yukio Mishima\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I heard that the sword used in Mishima&#39;s suicide was a 27th generation\n&gt;Kanemoto.
