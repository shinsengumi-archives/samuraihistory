If true can anyone provide \nenlightenment?\n&gt; Who was their lord and why did they become Ronin? Who was their \n&gt; target? Is it true the only 48 were given a samurai&#39;s death? Where \n&gt; are they buried? I&#39;d be grateful for any relevant information.\n&gt; \n&gt; Keyoke.\n\nYes it is true and not a myth,but there was only 47 Ronin and not 49\nTheir lord was Asano Takumi no Kami he was the lord of the castle of \nako in the province of harima,he was at the shoguns palace,and was \nto be instructed on court ceremonies,by Kotsuke no suke, who wanted \npayment for his services when they should be free,one day kotsuke \ninsulted Asano Takumi to the point that asano drew his sword and \nstruck kotsuke wounding him,asano was arrested and later sentanced \nto commit seppuku his castle was confiscated and his men were told \nto disband which for a samurai ment to become a ronin,they are \nburied at a temple called Sengakuji in the suburb of Takanawa, there \nis a lot more to this story such as more details than i have listed \nbut there are several books out there on the subject,\n1 is called The 47 ronin by John Allyn,\nand another is Tales of old japan by A.B.Mitford(Lord redesdale),i \nhope that helps out ..........Dave\n\n\n"
