As they draw they swing up and \n  back until the right angle is arrived at to rain arrows on \n  their foe. \n\n  They do not hold the arrow at full draw, but release at the top \n  of the arc.\n\n  There are some studies of exhumed bones from the period (when I \n  think all able-bodied men were obliged to do archery practice) \n  that suggest they suffered back injuries from the way they \n  trained and handled the bow.\n\n  Apart from Robin Hood (?) I don&#39;t think the bow ever became an \n  heroic weapon, or rather I don&#39;t know of an English hero who \n  was an archer.\n\n  The samurai were, of course, followers of the &#39;Way of Horse and \n  Bow&#39;. They can hold the arrow at full draw, and they developed \n  techniques that worked with the physiology rather than against \n  it.\n\n  [Even though the bow was rapidly superceded by firearms in the \n  West, there was still strong support and even after Waterloo \n  (1815) it was proposed that companies of archers could support \n  the muskets by continuing to fire whilst there was a pause in \n  the firing to reload after a volley.\n\n  The Brits however mastered the art of rapid load and fire, \n  achieving (I believe) the fastest rate of fire in its day, and \n  even up to WWI, the traditional &#39;five rounds rapid&#39; from bolt-action \n  rifles convinced the Germans that the Brits were using light \n  machine guns.]\n\n  Thomas\n\n\n        Yahoo!
