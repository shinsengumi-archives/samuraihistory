I&#39;ve published several short storie=\r\ns in the fantasy/SF field, but never a novel. I&#39;ve switched from writing fa=\r\nntasy/SF to writing historical fiction about Japan. Or as I sometimes call =\r\nit, &quot;my little corner of chambara-land&quot; because much of what I write is ins=\r\npired by some of the samurai &quot;chambara&quot; movies that I love. I try to do res=\r\nearch when I can to make my writing reasonably accurate i.e. no black-robed=\r\n ninjas carying &quot;ninja swords.&quot; But it is fiction and I reserve the right t=\r\no use a bit of artistic license, should I so choose.\n \nJust a question to M=\r\ns. Swanson: I believe that you explained that one of your female characters=\r\n tries to pass as a male in order to inherit her domain. I wonder if that w=\r\nould be necessary, actually trying to pose as a man. Because I know that, i=\r\nf a family has no son, then the daughter will inherit -- however a man of a=\r\nppropriate bloodlines will be married into the daughter&#39;s family, he will t=\r\nake on her surname, etc. In most cases, he would be named as the lord or ac=\r\ntual inheritor -- but sometimes in actual practice, if she were a strong wo=\r\nman, she would actually co-rule or even rule, at least &quot;behind the throne&quot; =\r\nso to speak. \n \nAlso, I have my doubts that a woman could actually pull thi=\r\ns off, trying to pass as a man or whether she and her family would see this=\r\n as being necessary. What I understand is that women with martial skills wo=\r\nuld study the martial arts in her own right and thus passing as a man would=\r\n not be necessary. I just got through watching a film about Tsuru-hime, the=\r\n &quot;Crane Princess&quot;, a legendary (not sure if actually historical) female war=\r\nrior in the Sengoku era who led an army that contained other women warriors=\r\n in attempting to defend her homeland. As in many Japanese tales about samu=\r\nrai, these brave women warriors and their male colleagues all wound up dyin=\r\ng in battle.  \n \nIn the Samurai Archives forum -- and also on this list, we=\r\n&#39;ve had long, involved, sometimes contentious discussions about Japanese wo=\r\nmen samurai/warriors/members of the buke class (a lot of this contentious d=\r\niscussion revolved around terminology, both in using Japanese and in using =\r\nEnglish). I believe that a consensus emerged from these discussion that the=\r\n vast majority of samurai fighting on the battlefield were men. Women of th=\r\ne buke class were usually trained and expected to defend their castle home,=\r\n using naginata and sometimes swords or bows and arrows. \n \nI really do NOT=\r\n want to open up that old can of worms about Japanese women warriors here. =\r\nBut if anyone has any comments about the liklihood and/or feasibility of wo=\r\nmen actually passing as men (as opposed to being women who occasionally wea=\r\nr what normally would be male accoutrements in certain situations) in Japan=\r\nese history -- I&#39;d like to see them.\n \nNina aka &quot;Wave Tossed&quot; \n\n  _____  \n\n=\r\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com=\r\n] \nSent: Thursday, September 28, 2006 6:05 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Newbie seeks info\n\n\n\nAmazing Swanson-Sa=\r\nn you&#39;re already a full-fledge author!!!!
