I wanted\nto backhand half of the idiots standing outside the\nmovie afterwards talking about how &quot;accurate&quot; this\nfictional event was, and I likewise DID backhand a\nfriend of mine for answering a question directed about\nme incorrectly with information based off of the\nmovie.\n\nThe movie was a good movie, just like other people\nhave mentioned, Glory, Bravehart, Gladiator, hell, I\neven like The Patriot.  If you didn&#39;t like the movie\ncause you just didn&#39;t think it was good, then that&#39;s a\nwhole different thing, but don&#39;t down it cause it\nwasn&#39;t accurate.  This movie is getting heat from the\ngeneral public, people who don&#39;t sympathize with a\nforeign &quot;epic&quot; like this because they&#39;re not familiar\nwith the culture, and people like yourselves, who\nconversly seem to know a little bit too much about the\nculture to be able to enjoy the middle ground that the\nfilm maker was probably trying to obtain for both\nsides to be able to enjoy.\n\nI don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but I became\ninterested in romantic visions of honor back when I\nwas a child.  I think it&#39;s important to know the truth\nabout things, but not to let it destroy your sense of\nromance.\n\n--- &quot;Anthony J.
