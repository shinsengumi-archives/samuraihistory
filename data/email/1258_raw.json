As \n&gt; someone else as said, I doubt if samurai were in the\n&gt; habit of \n&gt; showing swords to each other. In the Civil War era\n&gt; you were \n&gt; never sure who you could trust, and in the Edo\n&gt; period you were \n&gt; never sure how someone might react from what you\n&gt; say.\n&gt; \n&gt; To offer a quick paraphrase, one man offered a\n&gt; compliment \n&gt; regarding the other&#39;s blade, but the other guy took\n&gt; it as a \n&gt; veiled jibe, &quot;are you implying that I am not man\n&gt; enough for\n&gt; this blade!&quot; The next moment they&#39;re killing each\n&gt; other.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are strict rules of ettiquette with regard to\n&gt; the \n&gt; handling of swords taught in the martial ryu, not\n&gt; the least \n&gt; because there&#39;s always the chance that when you show\n&gt; someone \n&gt; your sword he then kills you with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; An example:\n&gt; \n&gt; The two men are kneeling opposite each other. The\n&gt; man passing \n&gt; the sword holds it horizontally, blade towards\n&gt; himself, one \n&gt; hand on the scabbard and one on the hilt.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he passes it, the receiver also takes a grip of\n&gt; both \n&gt; scabbard and hilt, and rolls the blade edge inward\n&gt; towards \n&gt; himself as he takes it.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; This is founded on the principle that:\n&gt; a - if you hand a sword over holding just the\n&gt; scabbard, the \n&gt; receiver can grab the hilt, draw the blade and cut\n&gt; you. You can \n&gt; do likewise to him as he receives it.\n&gt; \n&gt; b - if you hold just the hilt, the scabbard might\n&gt; slip off \n&gt; (although the fit should be sufficient to prevent\n&gt; this \n&gt; happening - they do wear in time, and worse things\n&gt; have \n&gt; happened).\n&gt; \n&gt; Likewise turning the blade edge towards oneself\n&gt; means it is \n&gt; harder to draw (because of the curve), and the blade\n&gt; edge is \n&gt; not pointing at the other guy (plain good manners).\n&gt; \n&gt; Apart from that, it&#39;s purely a matter of politeness.\n&gt; It&#39;s \n&gt; impolite to point a drawn blade at someone, or its\n&gt; edge, in any \n&gt; country. Swords are sharp and can cut, and for this\n&gt; reason \n&gt; alone should be treated with respect. Imagine\n&gt; someone \n&gt; showing you his gun by pointing it at your face!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
