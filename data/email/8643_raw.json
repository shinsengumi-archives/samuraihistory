I have done alot of writing and revising,  but Im still searching for that one sentence that puts everything  together for me. I know what I want to say, but sometimes it&#39;s hard to  put those things into writing. I think asking this question will spark  something for me, as I know there are several informed and educated  people in this group who know far more than I.\n  \n  In your opinion, were there differences in the philosophy of seppuku  during the reign of the Tokugawa as opposed to the period of time  leading up to the Tokugawa period? If so, what were they? \n  \n  For me, the first thing that comes to mind is the lack of widespread  warfare during the Tokugawa reign. This alters the significance of  seppuku during this period, in my opinion.\n  \n  Your ideas and input would be grately appreciated.\n  \n  Jonathan \n  \n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nTalk is cheap.
