Not a bad place \nto spend a holiday (when it&#39;s not crowded, that is).\n\n&gt; It was a great\n&gt; time--nothing beats a nice hot onsen after tramping\n&gt; around the mountains all day. No castles this time,\n&gt; but I did go to the Hakone Tokaido Sekisho--cool\n&gt; stuff. The first day we couldn&#39;t see Fuji at all, the\n&gt; second day we could see the top, the clouds obscured\n&gt; the bottom, and the third day we could see the bottom,\n&gt; but clouds were at the top. So between the days, we\n&gt; might have a decent picture. I&#39;ll send you the link\n&gt; once I get around to posting them. \n\nWhat, you didn&#39;t do The Climb? :)\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
