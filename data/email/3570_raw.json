Addressin=\r\ng negative traits are as important as addressing positive ones in a sincere=\r\n discussion about any topic.\nPerhaps another interesting aspect may be retr=\r\nieved from the &quot;Last Samurai&quot; motion picture. It is clear that the movie su=\r\nggests the rebellion were being lead in order to preserve tradition and hon=\r\nor (the Emperor=B4s counselours are portraied as greedy and selfish, wherea=\r\ns the &quot;Samurai&quot; are only honour bound). However, how absurd is conceiving t=\r\nhe rebellion as a device to attempt return to the &quot;status quo&quot;? Certainly, =\r\nthe &quot;Samurai&quot;, as a class, knew they would lose their prestige and power wi=\r\nth the Restoration and the open trade (before the Emperor, the Tokugawa Baf=\r\nuku agreed on trade terms). Would they be fighting for their status rather =\r\nby just simple plain honour?\n\nThese are just considerations and questions, =\r\nplease do not take them as offensive. I bear deep respect for the subject a=\r\nt hand.\n\nCheers,\n\nThiago   \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Yama Kam=\r\ninari no Date Saburou Yukiie \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent:=\r\n Monday, February 02, 2004 11:57 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: hello a=\r\ngain\n\n\n  Konnichi wa, tomodachi\n  This is going to seem as if I am against =\r\nsamurai, which I am not. I am\n  rather intrigued by them, in their day. Fol=\r\nlow me on this for a moment\n  if you will...\n\n  When Slavery was abolished =\r\nin the United States, there were people who\n  still thought slavery was a g=\r\nood idea, and people who didn&#39;t. After\n  the abolishment of slavery, for th=\r\ne most part, former slave owners\n  rarely went about saying they were membe=\r\nrs of a class that proudly\n  owned other human beings and had the right to =\r\nlife or death over them.\n  The law didn&#39;t allow that any more, and for the =\r\nmost part, and the\n  general populace would not stand for that. The abolish=\r\nment was drilled\n  into the public psyche, as was the concept that slave ow=\r\nners were not\n  needed in a changed society, and that all races and classes=\r\n should be\n  free and theoretically equal. Owning slaves was made not-noble=\r\n.\n\n  Samurai had an equal right of life or death over those of lesser\n  cla=\r\nss, held all of the benefits of the current society, and when\n  Samurai wer=\r\ne abolished, the general psyche of the public thought they\n  were as un-nee=\r\nded as slave owners were in the U.S.\n\n  So I suppose one could say they wer=\r\ne still slave owners if they were\n  the descendants of slave owners...but t=\r\nhe public would not look kindly\n  on that, nor would I suspect the public w=\r\nould look kindly on Samurai.\n\n  There were good samurai, and the parts of s=\r\namurai life that were noble\n  should be celebrated but lets not forget it w=\r\nas a package deal. - just\n  like there were, I suppose, some good slave own=\r\ners, but the society\n  evolved around them.\n\n\n  Just other thoughts...\n  Ch=\r\nristopher \n  (who celebrates the good parts of samurai life, but is aware t=\r\nhere are\n  bad ones...)\n\n  &gt; So theoretically the descendants of the samura=\r\ni class could\n  therefore still consider themselves to be samurai, although=\r\n not with a\n  legal foundation, with the laws enacted during the Meiji Rest=\r\noration\n  being formulated by the winners, if not nessarily/hypothetically =\r\nthose\n  in the &#39;right&#39; ??\n  &gt; Just a thought\n  &gt; M.Lorimer\n  &gt; \n\n\n\n  ---\n  =\r\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store:=\r\n http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
