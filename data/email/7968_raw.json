It is \nnot a documentary and does not pretend to be one. =\r\nIt does not even pretend to be a \nfictionalization of a historical event su=\r\nch as Samurai Banners and Kagemusha are. That \nsaid, they serve the same so=\r\nrt of function as say The Patriot does for understanding the \nU.S. Revoluti=\r\nonary War. \n\nIs it a historical source? By in large, no. Is it purely &quot;ente=\r\nrtainment&quot;, I think that this is too \nharsh. Chanbara films are much more o=\r\nf the entertainment variety, but even here the well \nmade chanbara film, su=\r\nch as Yojimbo, can expose the novice to the atmosphere of the \nperiond in w=\r\nhich it is set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
