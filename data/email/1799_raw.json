Why not then tell the \ntrue story of the actual American Arms dealer, Thomas Glover, who \nsold Civil war surplus to the anti-Tokugawa forces?(this may be the \none and only time American arms dealers were supplying the forces of \ngood) One of my favorite photographs from the period shows him in \nNagasaki I believe, surrounded by Satsuma shishi, at his side is his \nvery young son. I always wished I could be that kid.\n    If one must create fiction from history imagine all that \ncould be done, telling the tale of that young mans life...\n-t &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
