The guy I was talking to\n&gt; insisted on the idea, that they were forbidden by law to draw their swords,\n&gt; unless told to by their superiors.\n&gt; My point was that there were only resctrictions to the drawing of swords on\n&gt; certain occasions like being at the shoguns palace or in the court. I guess\n&gt; there are many more times when it was forbidden but those are the points\n&gt; that instantly came to my mind. I think that apart from that, there were no\n&gt; laws that restricted the drawing or the use of the sword. One example here\n&gt; would be kirisute gomen.\n&gt; My request to the members of this list would be to name any kind of source\n&gt; that proves my point as I donï¿½t want to rely only on one or two sources I\n&gt; have at hand right now. I can use english, german, french or japanese texts.\n&gt; Especially original sources or their modern day transcriptions would be\n&gt; great (i.e. osadamegaki, buke shohatto). Any help will be appreciated.\n\nIt&#39;s hard to find that sort of thing; you&#39;re looking for a negative. (e.g., \n&quot;prove that UFOs don&#39;t exist&quot;). Tell your friend to find citations for his point.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
