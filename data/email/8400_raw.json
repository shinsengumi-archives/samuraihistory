If I am not\nmistaken, was\n &gt; the event of Benkei&#39;s collecting swords at Gojo bridge after Heike\nclan\n &gt; defeated Genji clan? And Yoshitsune was from Genji clan, and Benkei\nonly\n &gt; confiscated swords from the members of Heike clan.\n \nYoshitsune went by the adult name of Kuro (9th son) no Yoshitsune. His\nbirth name was Ushiwakamaru (dear young ox) and his coming of age name\nwas Shanao.\n \nBenkei&#39;s collection of the Heike swords was, according to legend, prior\nto the outbreak of the Gempei war, but some years after the defeat of\nYoshitomo (Yoshitsune&#39;s father) by the Taira.\n \n--AngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
