This was done in\norder to clean his mind and spirit from all the deaths\nand suffer he provide in his service life.\nAnd some other samurai follow this road in order to\nexplore a religios path.\n\nBest regards. \n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n"
