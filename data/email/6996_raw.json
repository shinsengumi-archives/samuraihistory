I figured but he did get for a good price.  I figure \nY60000 isn&#39;t bad, even for a replica.  He was very concerned with \n&quot;restoring&quot; it to original condition.  Although I thought he was a \nlittle silly at first, I think it&#39;s added some value as a project for \nhim.  It&#39;s kind of like when I used to dig for dinosaur bones in the \nbackyard.  I&#39;d find a dogbone and get excited.  It was fun and had \nsome entertainment value.  His project is just a little cooler than \nmine was. ;p\n\nBrandon\n&gt; \n&gt; YEs, it&#39;s a replica. It&#39;s a copy (more or less) of one of Ieyasu&#39;s \ntwo &quot;gold&quot; \n&gt; armours.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n\n\n\n"
