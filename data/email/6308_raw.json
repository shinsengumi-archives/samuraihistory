Prior to the Tokugawa period, they\nmostly consisted of survival and victory, at least at\nthe top. No one has said, ever, I think, that loyalty,\nhonor, etc. are BAD things. However, it gets pretty\ntiresome explaining to nimrods (that&#39;s not a jab at\nyou, it&#39;s something we have to do often) that all\nSamurai didn&#39;t have some &quot;Bushido Handbook&quot; and had to\nfollow the Code or they were deprived of their Samurai\nmembership cards. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nDress up your holiday email, Hollywood style.
