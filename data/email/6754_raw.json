If you had a link to a picture or\n&gt; something,\n&gt; it would be extremely helpful. \n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone wants help translating something from\n&gt; Japanese, there are several of us (probably more\n&gt; than\n&gt; that) that can help. But you&#39;ve got to set yourself\n&gt; up\n&gt; for success--by just throwing the question out\n&gt; there,\n&gt; not only do I now have to translate said banner,\n&gt; I&#39;ve\n&gt; got to go looking for it, confirm it&#39;s the CORRECT\n&gt; banner this person wants to know about, and then\n&gt; translate it. It may be as simple as me going to\n&gt; google, typing in &quot;Ieyasu Banner&quot; and getting a\n&gt; picture. But if you really want your questions\n&gt; answered, then you should do the legwork. This board\n&gt; isn&#39;t here to compensate for your laziness/lack of\n&gt; effort. There&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t go to Google,\n&gt; find\n&gt; what you&#39;re looking for, and then provide us the\n&gt; link\n&gt; to look at so we can help. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; The Assistant Management.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
