Raises some very unigue questions.   Sadly they still apply \ntoday..  I wil have to sehck into both of these Films..   Recently I watched with \nmy son.  Twightlight Samuria..  I enjoyed it; but always seem as though \nJapanese films have to end in traggicly.\n\n I wold  like to raise two qestion if I may..  First there was a post \nearlier;  Loyalty to Bushido; what does that mean.   and Secondly.  who are the \nmodern day Samurai?\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
