Another poster didn&#39;t seem to see an answer I\nhad given him, so maybe there is an issue. Like I said\nI got your original post, but short of telling you to\nread Bottomley and Hopson (and as far as I can tell,\nyou already know everything they&#39;d be able to tell\nyou), there&#39;s nothing I can contribute. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
