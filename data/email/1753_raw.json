He hoped that an invasion should be\n&gt; possible to gain Korea as a satellite state. The government refused his\n&gt; request because of  fear of European intervention. These are the only\n&gt; thing the rebellion have to share with another nation.\n\nThe late prof. Hiraizumi Kiyoshi says very differently.\n\n&quot;The Korean government rejected the Meiji notification [end of shogunate, new\ngovernment announced] and committed many untoward acts. Therefore, Kido\nTakayoshi and others thought it necessary to respond militarily to chastise\nKorea for her rude behavior toward Japan. ... With that, discussions began on\nthe 12th day of the 6th month of Meiji 6 (1873).... Itagaki advocated a swift\nmilitary response. Saigo suppressed this intent, maintaining that diplomatic\nmissions should instead be sent to deal calmly but firmly with Korea. He\nproposed himself for the mission, and ultimately it was agreed that he would go.\n... [then Okubo and Kido and other goverment officials returned to Japan from a\nworld-crossing fact-finding mission.] .... heated word were exchanged at a\ncouncil on the 14th day of the 10th month. Concerned, the chancellor Sanjo\nbecame ill and Iwakura took his place as the chancellor&#39;s proxy. On the 22nd of\nthe 10th month, they resolutely rejected the previous council decision. As a\nresult, that same day, Saigo resigned his position as Councilor, and the next\nday Itagaki, Soejima Taneomi, Goto, and Eto followed suit. This was the\nbeginning of the Saga Rebellion.&quot;\nThe Story of Japan, vol iii.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
