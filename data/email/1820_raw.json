It is an excellent and comprehensive\nwork, although I am sure there will be some who\ndisagree!!     Currently selling at a reasonable ï¿½7.95\non Amazon.....\n\n                            Rod Johnson\n\nSynopsis on Amazon site\nThis is a true and revealing account of the Ninja, the\nJapanese clandestine warrior cult of assassins and\nspies that has acquired a legendary status among\nmartial arts enthusiasts and military historians. From\nmaterial previously unpublished in the West, Stephen\nTurnbull recounts the history, battles, science,\nmysticism and even the modern aspects of the Ninja.\nMany of the sources for this book are his own\ntranslations from Japanese archives. Myths about the\nNinja are exploded but the truth emerges here as far\nstronger than any fiction, making this work destined\nto become the standard work. \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
