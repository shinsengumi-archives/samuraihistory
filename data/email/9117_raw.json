Toshiro Mifune as Tokugawa (Toronaga? Somebody=\r\n could explain me this changes in the names). I found that the TV version i=\r\ns pretty faithfull to the Clavell&#39;s story. By the same, both of them has th=\r\ne same merits and problems. \nI also recommend Yoshikawa&#39;s works, but be pre=\r\npaired. I do not if it is the original or the transaltion, but the narrativ=\r\ne style is pretty hard and rude. Not like Clavell&#39;s (I am not saying that C=\r\nlavell was superb in that terms). On the other hand, is a real japanese who=\r\n writes, so there is a pretty much trustfull characterization of the japane=\r\nse ways.\nThere are two ways to be be shogun. One is to be appointed by the =\r\nemperor on such position, understanding that no other Shogun is in office. =\r\nOf course, a warlord supported by large posessions and being far over any o=\r\nther lord in terms of power, could get such appointment without problem, if=\r\n he wanted it. But also, tradition tells that only the members of two ancie=\r\nnt families, the Fujiwara and Minamoto, could become Shogun.Tokugawa claime=\r\nd blood links to this families, although evidence is questionable.\nThe seco=\r\nnd is to be heir of a previous Shogun.\nThe Shogun is intended to be the mil=\r\nitary governor of Japan. So, in the practice, his power is absolute. The Em=\r\nperor was only a symbolic figure, just like today more or less.\nSo far, her=\r\ne there are lots of people that knows a lot more about this than me, so for=\r\ngive me if I made a mistake.\n\nriskxd &lt;riskxd@...&gt; wrote:           =\r\n                       Hi, just signed up\n \n I&#39;m into Japanese History and =\r\nhave been reading a book called &#39;Shogun&#39; \n by James Clavel.\n \n It made me w=\r\nonder how exactly a daiymo became a shogun, what power he \n had and how he =\r\nwas in relation to the Emperor.\n \n Thanks, Please give me some information.=\r\n A few links maybe and could \n anyone recommend any other Ancient Japanese =\r\nbooks?\n \n \n     \n                       \n\n\n________________________________=\r\n_\n\n&quot;And the light shineth in darkness, \n\nand the darkness did not comprehen=\r\nd it&quot;\n\n_________________________________\n \t\t\n------------------------------=\r\n---\nTalk is cheap.
