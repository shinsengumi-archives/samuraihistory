But a nation is not guilty; that&#39;s a failure of our politics \nto pretend so, as innocents will pay on both sides be they children, wives, \nunwilling conscripts, etc.\n\nClausewitz famous sentense (please excuse my approximate translation): &quot;War \nis the extension of Politic by other means&quot; still apply. The rest is pure \nsementic; in the end, only the victor&#39;s claim to be on the side of justice \nwill remain.\n\nWas Takeda Shingen justified in his invasion of Shinano province? \nConsidering his ambitions, yes.

I think it is\n&gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; the death of one can prevent the suffering of many.  Sometimes you\n&gt; &gt; have to cut the cancer out to save the patient.  If you don&#39;t, it\n&gt; &gt; will spread until its evil pollutes all of mankind.\n&gt;\n&gt;And here opens the philosophical can of worms.  In this group, it\n&gt;would be assumed we should define &#39;justifiable homocide&#39; by the\n&gt;historical application of Japan&#39;s internal and external conflicts.\n&gt;It would probably be the best way to answer, especially in the face\n&gt;of solipsistic and existential mindsets (to name two out of dozens).\n&gt;\n&gt;Albeit, we all have our own opinions.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I think\n&gt; &gt; the leaders of that time wanted justice for the Russo-Japanese war\n&gt; &gt; treaties that America had mediated.\n&gt;\n&gt;In part, Japan&#39;s assault on Pearl Harbor was motivated the United\n&gt;States&#39; discontinuation of oil exports to Japan.  In effect, you\n&gt;could postulate America was responsible for the attack on Pearl\n&gt;Harbor by practicing aggressive isolationism (I define aggressive\n&gt;isolationism as the act of maintaining a neutral stance in a war\n&gt;while providing the war-time equipment and supply requirements of the\n&gt;warring nations).  We provided for England, to a degree.  We allowed\n&gt;our soldiers to volunteer for service in a European front in\n&gt;unofficial capacities.  We decreased or ceased importing and\n&gt;exporting with nations in order to preserve our stockpiles, for the\n&gt;most part, though, in agreement with you, there were probably more\n&gt;intricate politics involved.\n&gt;\n&gt;For Japan, loss of oil imports from us wasn&#39;t immediately crippling,\n&gt;but it was a potential blow to their economic future.  Japan was, by\n&gt;all rights, defending their interests by engaging in war.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m babbling a bit and slipping off-topic, but the main point deals\n&gt;with a comment made on the &#39;justness&#39; or &#39;unjustness&#39; of war.\n&gt;A &#39;just war&#39;, by definition, is one in which the people of a\n&gt;particular nation feel they were ethically correct in taking\n&gt;aggressive action.  This can apply to both the victorious and the\n&gt;defeated, depending on the perspective you want to defend.  When you\n&gt;said a war to take out a single individual to preserve the safety of\n&gt;others was morally just, which view point were you taking?  While I\n&gt;don&#39;t agree with their values or politics, the terrorists and their\n&gt;supporters feel they are right in the eyes of God (Allah, God,\n&gt;Jehovah, Yahweh, the Kami...however you need to define it.  They feel\n&gt;they are right in the eyes of the/a higher power).\n&gt;\n&gt;Who determines which side is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;just&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;Er, and I apologize for going a bit OT in this post.  Some of the\n&gt;lines from your original post were stuck in my head and I hadn&#39;t\n&gt;initially intended to reply to them.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Messenger : discutez en direct avec vos amis !  \nhttp://messenger.fr.msn.ca/\n\n\n"
