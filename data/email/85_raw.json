That&#39;s why I liked Nobunaga - \nKing of Zipangu.  \n\n\nAlso the faces of the actors and the make\n&gt; up on the actresses defies ones suspension of disbelief. They all \nlook like\n&gt; salarymen and office ladies, seems a good Edo or Muromachi \nperiod &quot;kao&quot; is\n&gt; impossible to find these days.\n\nI was thinking the same thing re-watching &#39;Motonari&#39; - the army \nseemed to be made up of 35 year old salaryment, huffing and puffing \nthier way to battle.\n\nCEWest\n\n\n"
