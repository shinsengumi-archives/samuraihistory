As I\nwas certain that Dux was a fraud (a very fast,\nlegitimately deadly fraud,\nwith some frighteningly effective moves, but still\nnothing like the adopted\nson of an Old Ninja Family that he pretended to be), I\ncalled up Hayes at\nhis studio and asked him something about research.  I\nwas thinking about\ngetting the store to stock some of his books.  I have\nrarely made anyone so\nnervous in a first conversation.  It set off my\ninternal alarms, and I never\ndid order the books.\n      Gereg\nP.S.  Ooh.  Ah.
