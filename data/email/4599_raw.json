It is taken from on\n&gt; top of the \n&gt; modern Uji Bridge. You can get a sense of how wide\n&gt; the river is \n&gt; today (although again I don&#39;t know how wide it was\n&gt; in 1180). The \n&gt; Byou-dou-in is one of the buildings in the right of\n&gt; the picture. \n&gt; Personally I can&#39;t figure out which of the buildings\n&gt; it is -- but it \n&gt; gives you a sense of the closeness of the building\n&gt; to the bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Jay Kelly\n&gt; oyakata@...\n\n\nJay--\n\nTHe link didn&#39;t work for me, but if you look at the\nback of a 10 yen coin, you&#39;ll see the Byodo-in. It&#39;s\ngot a central building, flanked by two wings--at the\nend of the wings are raised &quot;turret&quot;-like rooftops.\nThe whole structure is on, for lack of a better term,\nstilts--it&#39;s on the water. Been a decade since I was\nthere, so I don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s on the river or\nnear it on another body of water. \n\nI&#39;ll try to hit that link again later.\n\nNate\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
