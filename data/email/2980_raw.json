Kumite is also designed\nto sharpen the real battle skill. \nSo, both of them are training methods to prepare for\nreal fight.\n\nI doubt that we can judge the efficacy of either\nmethod by quoting mere street fights although I admit\nthat there are some in street naturally born to be\ngood fighters. However, a better judgement can be made\nif we consider who possible oppenents are for various\nsituations.\n\nFor example, if someone needs to fight with Tyson, I\nwould recommend strenuous and rigorous training\ncombining both Kata and Kumite.\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n--- Michael Peters &lt;shdwstel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Octavio,\n&gt; \n&gt;   You merely prove my point. It is technique. Your\n&gt; technique and training \n&gt; allowed you to rout the &quot;thugs&quot;.\n&gt;   As I&#39;ve studied various martial arts  for over 20\n&gt; years and unfortunately \n&gt; needed to use them on occasion, I don&#39;t REALLY need\n&gt; an explanation of kata. \n&gt; :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In Karate, there is a several of standardized\n&gt; movements called Kata, and\n&gt; &gt;sparring trainning called Kumite, however there is\n&gt; also a meditation to be\n&gt; &gt;performed before do all of this. The effect of it\n&gt; was that, in time of \n&gt; &gt;need,\n&gt; &gt;when some thugs attempted to assault me and take my\n&gt; money late at night, it\n&gt; &gt;was just instinctive. I was not thinking in what do\n&gt; do if the thief do this\n&gt; &gt;or that, or in technical therms when fighting for\n&gt; my life. Things just went\n&gt; &gt;naturally before I even knew what was really\n&gt; happening and the thugs got \n&gt; &gt;out\n&gt; &gt;of there, and I was no black belt, much less any\n&gt; kind of &quot;super martial \n&gt; &gt;arts\n&gt; &gt;master&quot; to do anything in special.\n&gt; &gt;Just an standard trainner as any other student.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;So, I know it is very far than what those of\n&gt; ancient called as &quot;sharpness \n&gt; &gt;in\n&gt; &gt;soul&quot;, but it is a pratical example, and one does\n&gt; not need to believe in\n&gt; &gt;&quot;magick&quot; to perform that.
