These symbols \nar=\r\ne also used as general &#39;good luck signs&#39; in many Asian cultures as well.\n\nI=\r\n believe that the &quot;manji&quot; is a depiction of the &quot;wheel of life&quot; hence its s=\r\nignificance as a \nBuddhist symbol. Actually, you will find the swastika of =\r\nboth orientations used in this sort \nof context in quite a few places acros=\r\ns Asia over a remarkably long period. Or so I recall. \nWhile orientation is=\r\n significant in Japanese kamon, it does not make the opposite \norientation =\r\nin any way impossible for use as a kamon. First time visitors to Nara may b=\r\ne \ntaken back to find a swastika on all of the manhole covers in the city. =\r\nThis has no political \nsignificance beyond the manji being the traditional =\r\ncivic symbol for Nara.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
