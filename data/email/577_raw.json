When I worked at the\n&gt; Borders bookstores in Hawaii, I made it a point to pick them out when\n&gt; customers were looking for info on the samurai. I hope you&#39;ll write us\n&gt; lots more, both scholarly books and popular books.\n&gt;\n\nI hope to. &lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;   I wasn&#39;t trying to slur popular writings on Japan,\n\nOh, no problem. I didn&#39;t think you were. I have to make the difference\nbetween histories like mine and those of Karl Friday, for example, though.\nIt&#39;s been my experience that most people read my books and Turnbull&#39;s, and\nnever want to get to the deeper backgrounds that mean academic works like\n&quot;Gates of Power: Monks, Courtiers, and Warriors in Premodern Japan&quot; or\n&quot;Yoritomo and the Founding of the Kamakura Shogunate&quot;, both of which are\nreplete with quotations and translated source material from primary sources.\nThat is something that disappoints me.\n\n&gt; I have a\n&gt; shelfload of such works, and every professor I studied under did too\n&gt; (where else can you find the cool pictures and stories that will\n&gt; enliven a lecture?)\n&gt;\n\nGood point. Heck, I had one professor *quote me* BACK to me (and the rest of\nthe class) in a lecture about Sekigahara. You know how good that feels? &lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;   Thanks again for writing them, I hope your studies go well (I ended\n&gt; up sliding sideways out of Japanese History into Nautical Archaeology\n&gt; myself...)\n\nThis is a cool thing. When you have time, e-mail me, and I&#39;ll tell you about\na long-held dream of mine that is right up our mutual alleys. &lt;G&gt;\n\n\nTony\n\n\n"
