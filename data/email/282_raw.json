Leiden: Hotei Publishing, 2000. 280 pp.\n| Tables, maps, notes, bibliography, and index. $65.00 (cloth),\n| ISBN 90-74822-22-3.\n|\n| Reviewed for H-Japan by Suzanne Gay &lt;suzanne.gay@...&gt;,\n| East Asian Studies Program, Oberlin College\n|\n| A New Biography of Oda Nobunaga\n|\n| Jeroen Lamers has written a biography of Oda Nobunaga, the\n| sixteenth century warrior who was the first of the so-called\n| three great unifiers of early modern Japan.  The study focuses\n| particularly on the policies and actions of Nobunaga during the\n| years of his national ascendancy, 1568-82.  Mr. Lamers has\n| consulted a wide range of contemporary sources: in addition to\n| numerous official documents, these include the Shincho Kyou-ki\n| by Oota Gyuuichi, Nobunaga&#39;s first chronicler, the Jesuit\n| records, and diaries like the Kanemi Kyou-ki and Tokitsugu\n| Kyou-ki.  Mr.  Lamers has also taken full measure of the works\n| of Japanese and western historians in his treatment of this\n| important figure.\n|\n| This monograph contributes in several important ways to the\n| literature on Nobunaga and sixteenth century Japan.  First, it\n| is the only thorough treatment of Nobunaga&#39;s career and\n| achievements in a western language.  Although we have read about\n| Nobunaga, or at least Nobunaga&#39;s policies, in the context of the\n| Sengoku period and are aware of his main achievements, it tends\n| to be mainly as a forerunner to Hideyoshi and Ieyasu that he is\n| remembered.  In a full treatment of his life his achievements\n| are better appreciated not only for what came after him but for\n| what he achieved in his own times.  Second, we can better\n| appreciate Nobunaga&#39;s genius as a military and especially\n| political tactician when we see the tremendous odds against\n| which he struggled all his adult life, besieged by enemies on\n| all sides.  Although the Japanese political scene fell into\n| disarray once Nobunaga was assassinated, his policies and\n| campaigns had indeed unified great portions of the country by\n| the time Hideyoshi took control.  In his drive to take Kyoto and\n| in his decision to settle in Azuchi, near but not in the ancient\n| capital, Nobunaga defined himself as a national leader and not\n| simply as the head of a coalition of warriors.  Finally, by\n| giving close attention to the years 1568 through 1573, Mr.\n| Lamers shows the Muromachi shogunate under the active leadership\n| of the last shogun, Yoshiaki, to have been much more vital and\n| politically significant even immediately prior to its demise\n| than is usually thought.\n|\n| Mr. Lamers approaches the story of Nobunaga&#39;s life primarily as\n| a series of scholarly debates which he presents, analyzes and,\n| often, dismisses in whole or in part.  He then puts forth his\n| own revisionist conclusions, some of which are persuasive and\n| carefully considered, and certainly demonstrate familiarity with\n| both Japanese and western scholarship.  Nevertheless, this\n| approach, however valid it may be in a dissertation, imparts a\n| pedantic quality to a biography and detracts from what should be\n| the narrative thrust of Nobunaga&#39;s life.  Some of the scholarly\n| judgments, moreover, come across as excessively dismissive. Asao\n| Naohiro&#39;s thinking on the concept of tenka, for instance, should\n| not be dismissed out of hand (p. 128) simply because the author\n| is determined to refute the theory of Nobunaga&#39;s\n| self-deification.  It is quite possible, it seems to me, that\n| Nobunaga had the intellectual capacity, not to mention political\n| shrewdness, to apply concepts of statehood to his rule.  Mr.\n| Lamers, however, seems determined to portray him at all costs as\n| a pragmatist.\n|\n| Mr. Lamers has extensively mined contemporary Jesuit writings in\n| his study.  These are valuable if biased sources, as he reminds\n| the reader frequently: they record events that corroborate\n| Japanese sources and they contain some descriptions of Japanese\n| life not found elsewhere, but their interpretation of events is\n| often self-interested.  Unfortunately, Mr. Lamers too frequently\n| gets sidetracked into a determination to undermine these\n| sources, and in the process the narrative of Nobunaga&#39;s life is\n| relegated to the wings: for instance, the author attacks at\n| length the Jesuits&#39; portrayal of Nobunaga as a supporter of\n| Christianity, and later refutes Luis Frois&#39; assertion of\n| Nobunaga&#39;s self-deification.  Nobunaga&#39;s relationship with the\n| Jesuits was indeed one part of his consolidation of power and\n| isolation of certain enemies.  The author might have analyzed it\n| to explicate aspects of Nobunaga&#39;s character germane to his hold\n| on power: his shrewdness, his fascination with the unknown and\n| the exotic, and at the same time his prudence.  Instead, Mr.\n| Lamers gets caught up in showing the Jesuits to be vain and\n| misguided in their belief that Nobunaga supported them.  (This\n| argument, incidentally, turns out to be a non-starter: some of\n| the sources cited show in fact a very accurate and sober Jesuit\n| understanding of Nobunaga&#39;s motives in granting them favorable\n| treatment.)  Ultimately, the space devoted to critiquing the\n| Jesuit sources is disproportionate to this relatively minor\n| aspect of Nobunaga&#39;s life.\n|\n| As the subtitle suggests, Mr. Lamers is at pains to challenge\n| the standard view of Nobunaga as a cruel and brutal tyrant.\n| Again, he implicates the Jesuits as the original culprits, with\n| the label sticking even in the most recent scholarship on\n| Nobunaga.  To refute this, Mr.  Lamers presents events as they\n| may have appeared to Nobunaga and argues, often persuasively,\n| that the actions he took were (simply) those of a pragmatic,\n| decisive, non-ideological, and extremely ambitious warrior.\n| Perhaps so, but in the end there are enough cases of massive\n| slaughter, deliberate disgrace and humiliation of less worthy\n| vassals, ruthless treatment of enemies, and, to put it mildly,\n| iconoclastic treatment of Buddhist groups that the original\n| label remains quite apt.  But after all, brutality was\n| widespread in the sixteenth century, and not only in Japan.  Yet\n| is this the best yardstick by which to assess Nobunaga?  By\n| focusing so heavily on brutality Mr. Lamers places central\n| emphasis on a moral evaluation of Nobunaga&#39;s character, in the\n| process missing other standards by which to consider his place\n| in history.  In his conclusion, which is too mild considering\n| the weight of the story he has just told, Lamers ends by merely\n| saying that &quot;the best adjectives to characterise Nobunaga&#39;s rule\n| and personality are not &quot;callous and brutal&quot; but &quot;pragmatic and\n| ruthless&quot; (p. 232).  Surely there is more that could be said of\n| the career and contributions of this brilliant military and\n| political tactician.  Mr. Lamers points out that the treatment\n| of Nobunaga by early modern Japanese chroniclers and historians\n| in the early modern period is a huge topic requiring a separate\n| study.  Nonetheless, a summary, at least, of the early modern\n| Japanese writings on Nobunaga would have balanced the attention\n| given to Jesuit writings, and perhaps helped better define a\n| historical niche for Nobunaga.\n|\n| Nobunaga&#39;s reputation as a cruel and ruthless warrior rests in\n| part on his treatment, audacious for its times, of institutional\n| Buddhism.  In 1571 his forces attacked and burned Enryakuji, the\n| great Tendai monastery on Mt. Hiei, and slaughtered its\n| thousands of monks.  This study portrays the event as payback\n| for Enryakuji&#39;s monks joining forces opposed to Nobunaga in\n| earlier conflicts--&quot;a matter of restoring his military\n| credibility and saving his personal honor&quot; (p. 76).  While\n| allowing that this was an unprecedented act of sacrilege,\n| however, Mr.  Lamers does not convey Enryakuji&#39;s powerful\n| position in the medieval economy and religion, and thus somewhat\n| underrates the importance of the event.  Quite simply, no\n| earlier ruler could have even contemplated such a move.  By\n| sacking Enryakuji, Nobunaga obliterated one of the foundations\n| of the medieval order.  His other &quot;encounter&quot; with Buddhism was\n| his long struggle against the well-organized and persistent\n| forces of the Honganji.  It is true that these forces lacked the\n| monastic character of the monks at Hiei, but ascribing\n| Nobunaga&#39;s motives in this campaign partly to a loathing for\n| &quot;farmers&quot; is less than satisfying, especially given the carnage\n| at Nagashima.  Nobunaga had a clear vision of the religious\n| obstacles that stood in his way, and he pursued them\n| relentlessly.\n|\n| Finally, one comes away from this study with a much greater\n| appreciation for Nobunaga&#39;s achievements, but without much of a\n| sense of Nobunaga as a person.  Premodern sources are, of\n| course, notoriously intractable about shedding light on\n| individuals, and Mr. Lamers eschews at the outset a\n| psychohistorical approach.  Nevertheless, more discussion of\n| Nobunaga&#39;s character and times would have yielded a fuller\n| portrait of him without requiring a foray into psychoanalysis.\n| For instance, one wonders about the sixteenth century warrior\n| family and its ethos: was it unusual for a younger brother to\n| overshadow the eldest son, as Nobunaga did?  And was Nobunaga\n| unusual in sometimes favoring collateral relatives over his own\n| sons?  The case of Nobunaga&#39;s first marriage, dissolved over\n| inter-familial politics, cries out for some discussion of\n| marriage practices.  The role in the Araki Crisis of the\n| Christian daimyo with their high regard for loyalty offers an\n| opportunity to discuss this virtue in the context of late\n| sixteenth century Japanese warrior society.  Despite some missed\n| opportunities, however, Mr. Lamers has produced a comprehensive\n| and illuminating account of Nobunaga&#39;s career and policies.\n|\n| Copyright 2001 by H-Net, all rights reserved.
