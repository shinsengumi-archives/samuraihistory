This was followed by =\r\nthe Kofun period, where Japan began to slowly consolidate and unify into a =\r\nconfederacy. The name of the Kofun period comes from the huge keyhole shape=\r\nd burial mounds known as &quot;Kofun&quot;.\n\nPart 3: Asuka-Nara period (Part 1) http:=\r\n//bit.ly/ozFahT\nContinuing our Introduction to Japanese History podcast ser=\r\nies, we will examine the Asuka-Nara period over two episodes. The Asuka-Nar=\r\na period (538AD-794AD) is known for it&#39;s classic art and architecture, the =\r\nintroduction of Buddhism, and the Taika reforms and Ritsuryo system. Japan =\r\nadopted many Chinese style institutions, began to form a national governmen=\r\nt, and started to assert itself internationally in East Asia.\n\nPart 4: Asuk=\r\na-Nara Period (Part 2) http://bit.ly/nOMqVt\nContinuing our Introduction to =\r\nJapanese History series is part 2 of our Asuka-Nara podcast. \nThe Asuka-Nar=\r\na period (538AD-794AD) is known for it&#39;s classic art and architecture, the =\r\nintroduction of Buddhism, and the Taika reforms and Ritsuryo system. Japan =\r\nadopted many Chinese style institutions, began to form a national governmen=\r\nt, and started to assert itself internationally in East Asia.\n\nPart 5: Heia=\r\nn period http://bit.ly/pmW7RQ\nPart five of our Introduction to Japanese His=\r\ntory series covers the Heian period. \nThe Heian period (794AD-1185AD) is na=\r\nmed after Heian-kyo (present day Kyoto). The Heian period is known for it&#39;s=\r\n art, literature, and poetry, as well as the spread of Tendai and Shingon B=\r\nuddhism.\n\nComing up next week - the rise of the warrior class.\n\n\n\n"
