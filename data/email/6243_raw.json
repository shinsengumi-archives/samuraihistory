Swords were in fact tested on corpses and ranked by how well they cut, the results of the test was sometimes inscribed on the tang of the blade. http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/sharp.htm \n\nDave\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Thomas Davidson \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, December 11, 2004 3:56 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] On naming swords\n\n\n\n  There is an excerpt from &#39;My Father&#39; by Arai Hasuseki, in Legends of\n  the Samurai&#39; and it relates a story:\n\n  Hasuseki&#39;s father Masanori, lived from 1601-82,  &#39;not far removed\n  from the Sengoku Jidai&#39;, as his son describes it.\n\n  &#39;You should never say ... that you carry a sharp blade ... someone\n  heard someone else say his sword cuts exceptionally well, so said \n  &quot;By Heaven, you act rudely as if no-one else was around you. \n  Do you suppose anyone would carry a sword that does not cut? \n  Come on, man, see for yourself whether my sword cuts or not!&quot; \n  and drew his sword.&#39;\n\n  Apparently, bystanders intervened before blood was spilt.\n\n  It would appear from other details related to named swords, here and\n  elsewhere, that names usually derived from an incident to do with\n  the sword, rather than from any inherent quality of the blade. \n\n  The risk in attributing qualities to the sword itself implies that\n  other swords lack that quality, or rather this sword is superior \n  in that quality to all others, and thus an insult to the owner, \n  and an invitation to a duel.\n\n  They were touchy chaps, in those days.\n\n  Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
