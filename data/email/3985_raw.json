It&#39;s just the few elitists\ngetting their say. On one hand, I can&#39;t blame them, because they&#39;re\nconstantly having to deal with misconceptions about samurai and feudal Japan\nthat pop culture has taught people, especially *outside* of Japan. I don&#39;t\nknow all that much about Musashi, but I do know that my boyfriend is greatly\ninspired by The Book of Five Rings, and I find there&#39;s nothing wrong with\nthat. That book has inspired many people and I think it&#39;s healthy, to be\nhonest.\n\nI do, however, get annoyed when people make assumptions about history or\nhistorical figures without doing their own research by looking at more\nreliable sources. I can&#39;t believe how many people have come by here asking\nwhether Himura Kenshin really existed and whether the events of the anime\nare real. Geez. &gt;_&gt; A lot of the &quot;common&quot; information about Musashi  is most\nlikely legends embellished by time (and perhaps by himself and/or his own\nadmirers), too. I&#39;m no expert on Japanese history, but I&#39;m assuming the\nannoyance is coming from people interpreting legends as fact. Nonetheless,\nMiyamoto Musashi&#39;s Book of Five Rings has inspired a wide range of people,\nand I think that&#39;s a wonderful thing. The words themselves, I think, are\ntimeless and don&#39;t necessarily have to relate to a particular period of\nhistory.\n\nI must say, though, that the reaction of certain individuals on this list to\nnewbies asking uninformed questions is quite childish and unbecoming to my\neyes. Perhaps the admin(s) of this list should consider splitting Samurai\nHistory up into two lists, one more pop culture oriented and another more\nhistory oriented. That way, the elitist historian types are less likely to\nbe faced with questions that make them roll their eyes and act so rudely.\nAfter all, it seems they&#39;ve pretty much given up on trying to educate people\nby correcting their mistakes... so why not just seperate the historians from\nthe casual fans?\n\nSally\n\n\n"
