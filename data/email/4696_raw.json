Though I am sure that they were \nextreme cases since weilding 3+ shaku katana is a muchly different \nexperience than the more typical 2.0 - 2.5 shaku katana.\n  As a matter of general court procedures during the Edo (Tokugawa) period \nthe daito was removed when entering someone elses house and the visitor was \nleft with the shoto (wakizashi) and their tanto.\n  There are two other &quot;blades&quot; that are often overlooked as being part of \nthe common accoutrements of the samurai, the kogai and the kozuka.  The \nkogai is, for the most part, the stick that you often see in the topknot of \nthe Edo period men.  It is adorned with the kamon of the carrier and, \naccording to what I have been told by my Iaido sensei, it was used to mark a \nslain opponent by sticking it into their Achilles&#39; tendon.  Also, if the tip \nhad enough of an edge, it could be used as a shuriken since the original \nshuriken were merely short knives, not throwing stars.\n  The kozuka is basically a 3 or 4 inch blade that was stored in the saya \n(sheath) and could be pulled out through the tsuba (hand guard).  This knife \nwas often used as a utility knife for cutting rope, fruit, etc.  Though in \nthe hands of a skilled samurai it could be used as a close quarters weapon \nor as a shuriken.\n  Hopefully this has helped in some way.  If anyone knows something that I \nhave mis-stated please do correct me.  I do not yet have the wealth of \nknowledge that some on this list have.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMake the most of your family vacation with tips from the MSN Family Travel \nGuide! http://dollar.msn.com\n\n\n\n"
