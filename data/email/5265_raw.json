I presume that many of\nthem studied in the United States, Great Britain,\nFrance, and Germany so that their language skills will\nbe much better. (at least in writing)\nHopefully, you can find a few of them who are\ninterested in helping you.\n\nAnother option is to check the following website:\nhttp://www.prkorea.com/\nThey are a civilian group who are interested in\nteaching their history to foreigner.\n\nThe last tip is to instigate their patriotism for\nbetter responses. Although disorganized, they have\nproved to become solid in times of crisis.\nPlease, let me know if there are any other things I\ncan do for you in my capacity.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n                       Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                       Changsub Lee\n\n\n--- burker1@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks.  I think I have both Turnbull books (I&#39;m\n&gt; still unpacking after moving \n&gt; so I can&#39;t be 100% sure).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve tried contacting the War Museum in Seoul, but\n&gt; never heard back from them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 8/15/04 8:42:01 PM,\n&gt; ltdomer98@... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt; \n&gt; --- burker1@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve recently gotten interested in the Japanese\n&gt; &gt; invasion of Korea in the \n&gt; &gt; 1590s.  Does anyone know of a good source for\n&gt; Korean\n&gt; &gt; uniforms?  I plan on buying \n&gt; &gt; some 15mm Korean miniatures from Eureka Miniatures\n&gt; &gt; in Australia and it would be \n&gt; &gt; nice if I could find some colour illustrations of\n&gt; &gt; the Korean soldiers so I \n&gt; &gt; know what the miniatures should look like.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob--\n&gt; \n&gt; 2 sources I&#39;d check, both by Turnbull--his &quot;Samurai\n&gt; Invasion&quot; is exclusively about Hideyoshi&#39;s invasion\n&gt; in\n&gt; the 1590&#39;s, and &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; has a great color\n&gt; plate depicting Kato Kiyomasa in action against the\n&gt; Koreans. If you can find it online, the War Museum\n&gt; in\n&gt; Seoul has some great exhibits, but not sure if it\n&gt; has\n&gt; a website. I just tried a quick google, but you may\n&gt; have better luck. It&#39;s worth looking.  &gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
