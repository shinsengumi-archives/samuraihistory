Thus, you will see a lot of units being known by \ntheir commander. In such a system, you will see comparatively little \nsystematic organization by military ranks. That is usually a feature of \nnon-feudal armies such as the Roman army or modern armies where the \nmilitary is divorced from the land. There is a Japanese drive to form \n&quot;ranks and levels&quot;, but this is expressed through a system of \nappointments to office both in several different kinds of institution \nwhich could and did exist at the same time.\n\n1) The ancient uji offices which by the time you are interested in were \npretty much ceremonial. These titles are called kabane and there is a \nmonograph on them which you can find by a Worldcat search. In the time \nyou are probably interested in, these were the cap-ranks of the kuge \n(courtier) class. The number of kabane was changed a couple of times.\n\n2) The the ancient court ranks and offices. These are of interest to \nthe samurai and includes the title Sei-i-tai-shougun. All high-ranking \nsamurai aspired to court rank and office.\n\n3) The kuge household offices.\n\n4) The offices of the Kamakura bakufu, the Muromachi bakufu, and the \nTokugawa bakufu. Ones which are of particular interest are jitou and \nthe shugo. The jitou were basically local tax collectors and estate \nmanagers. Their appointment was absorbed by the Kamakura bakufu. The \nshugo were provincial constables whose office roughly paralleled the \nimperial provincial governors. The shuo, and most especially after the \nOnin-Ran evolved into the daimyou which you are probably familiar with \nfrom the Sengoku period.\n\n5) Buke (samurai) household officials. You frequently see these people \nin movies set in the Edo period.\n\n6) Buddhist temples could and did function as the equivalent of either \nkuge estates or buke fiefdoms. They of course had their own \nadministrative structures.\n\nRegardless these different systems co-existed and each of them provided \nrevenue streams or &quot;pay grades&quot; for the various people entitled to \nthem. According to the war stories, when meeting on the battlefield, \nwarriors of high rank would declare their names and various \nentitlements to each other when they believed that their opponent was \nof adequately comparable rank. These declarations are called &quot;nanori&quot;. \nThis term also refers to one component of the names born by Japanese of \nsufficient rank.\n\n\n"
