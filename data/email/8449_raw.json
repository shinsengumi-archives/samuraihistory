Being a man who admits when he is \nwro=\r\nng I concede to the fact that squid may be written in katakana \nalthough I =\r\nhave not seen this in any of the sushiya I frequent. \nHowever I beg you ple=\r\nase tell me how ika may be written in kanji. \nWith all these messages for t=\r\nhis one small matter I certainly hope \nthe original asking member has been =\r\nsatisfied.\n\nI may be expelled from this group for saying this and that woul=\r\nd be \ntruly a shame as I have enjoyed the various conversations immensely. =\r\n\nFar too often the conversations turn away from a pleasant learning \nexperi=\r\nence into an aggressive &quot;my stick is bigger than your stick&quot; \nbanter. It is=\r\n understood that many of the writers hold degrees in \nJapanese history. Tha=\r\nt being said it is also true that many of us \ndon&#39;t. Does that make us some=\r\nhow unworthy of comment or do you \nsimply derive pleasure in the belittleme=\r\nnt of others? \n\nWe are all here because we share an interest in the history=\r\n, lives \nand values of the samurai. It is wonderful to have a group of peop=\r\nle \nwho share this common interest and can both teach as well as learn \nfro=\r\nm one another. To that end I would say this, &quot;Serve the group and \nnot one&#39;=\r\ns self interest of greatness, for all will be the better for \nit.&quot;\n\nHirai \n=\r\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Phil &lt;ptourigny@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ro=\r\nb wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ika is written only in hiragana. Katakana is usually reserv=\r\ned \nfor \n&gt; &gt; words that did not originate in Japan or what we call borrowed=\r\n \nwords.\n&gt; \n&gt;    &lt;sigh&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;    No. I see &quot;ika&quot; written in katakana much mo=\r\nre often than in \nhiragana, \n&gt; though both (and kanji, for that matter) are=\r\n possible. Japanese \nhas \n&gt; tendencies and preferences (one of which is the=\r\n use of katakana \nfor \n&gt; animals and plants) in terms of which script is mo=\r\nst often used to \nwrite \n&gt; certain words, but few strict rules; which scrip=\r\nt gets used often \n&gt; depends partly on the context the word is used in, and=\r\n partly on \nthe \n&gt; writer&#39;s preference.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Phil\n&gt; Men with sharpnes=\r\ns of mind are to be found only among those with a \n&gt; penchant for thought. =\r\n-- Shiba Yoshimasa\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
