And one of the\n&gt; other ronin in the group point out that he would\n&gt; have to have been born 100\n&gt; or so years ago. &lt;g&gt;\n\nActually, it&#39;s not that he&#39;d be too old, it&#39;s that\nhe&#39;d be too young. The date read off showed\n&quot;Kikuchiyo&quot; to be 7, IIRC. \n\n\n&gt; Musashi&#39;s early life is sketchy, so I drew my own\n&gt; conclusions, which may be\n&gt; way off base. I didn&#39;t draw the conclusion purely on\n&gt; Musashi&#39;s outlining of\n&gt; his own pedigree; I had other sources I consulted as\n&gt; well. According to\n&gt; these sources, it has seemed logical to conclude\n&gt; that Miyamoto Musashi was\n&gt; born the son of a ronin in a farming village. Like I\n&gt; said, I may be wrong,\n&gt; but I feel more confident to say this rather than to\n&gt; say simply &quot;I don&#39;t\n&gt; know.&quot; \n\nFair enough--the commonly held idea is that he was a\nronin himself, and therefore samurai, but honestly, it\ndoesn&#39;t really matter. I just find it slightly ironic\nthat some hold him up as this &quot;samurai paragon&quot; (tm)\nand yet there is some doubt about his origins, but in\nthe end, the importance of Musashi is in the stories\nof his life and his art and writing, not his birth.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
