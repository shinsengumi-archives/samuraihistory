It reminded me how \nwell-informed so many people in this forum are, and how \ngenerous they are with their time and knowledge. I&#39;m going \ninto Yamaguchi tomorrow and will have a look for video \nrentals. The nearest from here is about 40 ks,( or maybe I \nshould say 10 ri as I&#39;m livng the life of a Yamaguchi \nobaachan and going everywhere on foot or on a bicycle.) \nAnd I&#39;m going back to Australia on Sunday so won&#39;t be able \nto watch the NHK dramas over New Year. I did see the \nexcerpts from the one on Oguri on Sono Toki last month, also \none on Omura (can&#39;t remember his given name. )\n\nAnother couple of questions. I&#39;m reading a biography of \nInoue Kaoru by Monma Koudou. Does anyone know of him \nas a historian?\n\nAnd he mentions &quot;jirai&quot;  - landmines?? (that&#39;s what the kanji \nread) What sort of landmines would Choshu have had in \n1864 and where would they have got them?\n\nThanks again.\n\nGillian\n\n"
