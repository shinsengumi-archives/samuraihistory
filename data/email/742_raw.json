The tacticians and strategists I definitely want to talk\nto. But how could you *not* talk to the guys in the trenches?  The greatest\ntactician is nothing if the only army he commands is a chessboard, and his\nsoldiers can&#39;t or won&#39;t fight.\n\nI think of it this way: The generals write the titles and chapter headings,\nwhile the soldiers actually fill in the individual paragraphs.\n\nThe trouble is, *most* people don&#39;t want to read stories about the little\nguy; they want sweeping tales of battle where the &quot;little guy&quot; is a\nregiment.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
