It conducts research and \nholds lectures relating to the loyal retainers of Ako, and has \nproduced several publications. About 300 people belong to the \norganization.\n\nIn the past, the group held a &quot;Chushingura doctoral test&quot; for its \nmembers, but the latest test marks the first time the doors have \nbeen opened to the public. The exam consists of 50 multiple choice \nand written questions, testing people on their general knowledge of \nthe 47 masterless samurai and the historical events surrounding the \nincident. Applicants need to correctly answer 40 of the questions \ncorrectly during the 90-minute test period to pass.\n\nResults will be posted to applicants within a month of the test. \nThose who pass will receive a certificate from the organization and \nthe qualification of &quot;Chushingura instructor.&quot; The organization will \nreportedly introduce those who pass to teaching jobs if they are \ninterested. The cost of sitting the test is 10,000 yen.\n\n&quot;We want as many people as possible to take the test and deepen \ntheir knowledge,&quot; a Chuo Gishikai official said.\n\nThe Chushingura is based on an incident in the early 1700s, in which \na group of masterless samurai who had served under Asano Naganori \nbanded together to kill Kira Yoshinaka, a retainer of the Tokugawa \nShogunate, in retaliation for actions that resulted in Asano being \nordered to commit suicide. The incident has been repeated in \nnumerous plays and stories, and the Chuo Gishikai has described the \nChushingura as &quot;an asset of Japan&#39;s spiritual culture.&quot; (Mainichi)\n\nhttp://mdn.mainichi-\nmsn.co.jp/entertainment/news/20050822p2a00m0et012000c.html\n\n\n\n"
