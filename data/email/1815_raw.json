There\n&gt;must have been some method of time keeping so that\n&gt;occassions and events could start at a set time.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nCertainly nothing mechanical. Maybe sundials, stars or candles but no \nmechanical clocks. Why start anything at an exact time after all? That&#39;s \na Western obsession of that period after all.\n\n&gt;   From: Eponymous13@...\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey there.  Me again.\n&gt;  Maybe I can be of some help.
