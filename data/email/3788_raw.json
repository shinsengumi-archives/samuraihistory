Probably, I&#39;ll stay there until I feel I \nhave something to contribute, but I wanted to introduce myself. \n\nI am very interested in the late Heian - early Kamakura periods, \nspecifically the Gempei War.  I have recently acquired a fine yumi, \noptimistically named Benkei, and am currently learning technique.  I \nhave enjoyed your discussions so far, especially the passionate \nones, and I look forward to learning from them.  \n\nThank you.\n\n~ Amy\n\nPS:  Is it kosher to post a background I created in the Files area?\n\n\n"
