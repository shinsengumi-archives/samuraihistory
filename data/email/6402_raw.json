I&#39;ve got one\ntranslation, but being as I haven&#39;t finished reading\nit, and certainly haven&#39;t compared it, I can&#39;t help\nyou. \n\n\n&gt; Secondly, I am wondering if anyone has read Thomas\n&gt; Cleary&#39;s &#39;The Art of Japanese War&#39; (1992), and would\n&gt; like to hear your thoughts \n&gt; on it.\n\nNot surprisingly, I&#39;ve got strong feelings about\nCleary. I haven&#39;t read his &quot;Art of Japanese War&quot;,\nbecause his &quot;translation&quot; of Sun Zi Ping Fa (THE Art\nof War) is hideous. He&#39;s a philosophy nut, and if\nyou&#39;re looking for goofy easternish mystic\ngobbledygook, then he&#39;s your man. Unfortunately, I\ntend to think when an ancient Chinese strategist is\nwriting about war, when he writes about how to defeat\nan enemy, that&#39;s what he&#39;s talking about. Cleary takes\nit all as metaphor, expressing Taoist essence, blah\nblah blah. When the man talks about killing people,\nTom, he&#39;s talking about killing people--not moon\nviewing. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nAll your favorites on one personal page ï¿½ Try My Yahoo!\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
