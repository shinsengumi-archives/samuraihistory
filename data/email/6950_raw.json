Takasugi is a very romantic figure from the Bakumatsu, \nand like many others from the time he died early which adds a lot to \nhis enduring popularity in Japan.\n\tIto on the other hand survived the violence of the \nrestoration, tsumannai, and had a long career as a politician in the \nnewly formed Meiji government. As one of those Meiji Oligarchs he was \npart of the &quot;new Bakufu&quot; that Saigo wound up fighting against and so \nis not seen as a romantic figure like Takasugi and all the young \ndudes whose early death meant their &quot;pure spirits&quot; were not tainted \nby the money and corruption within the new order.\n\tIn the west scholars place much more importance on the new \ngovernment and the choices made by it&#39;s leaders than on the popular \nrevolutionaries who died in it&#39;s creation. Look for info on Ito under \n&quot;Meiji&quot; and not &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; and I think you&#39;ll find enough \ninformation for your paper...\n-t\n\n"
