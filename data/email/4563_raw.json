She supposedly invaded Korea around \n200AD (I have no idea if this date is myth or reality), although I&#39;ve also \nseen 366AD cited as a date for her invasion of Silla, and 200AD cited as \nthe date around which Himiko/Pimiko ruled. I have absolutely no idea \nwhich of these two sets of dates is correct though.\n\nShane.\n\n\n"
