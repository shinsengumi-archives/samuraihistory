The impression it made was &quot;hey, cool,\nTom Cruise made a movie about Japan, and Ken Watanabe\ngot nominated for an Oscar...yay, Japan is in the\nnews!&quot; No one is going off to seek their samurai roots\nin the hills of Satsuma because of it. \n\nThe article is full of it. \n\n but I don�t see any\n&gt; evidence presented for an impression left on\n&gt; Westerners by �Last Samurai�E\n&gt; The responses to the group suicide seem nothing more\n&gt; than the same clich�d\n&gt; responces to Japanese suicide that Westerners have\n&gt; been giving for\n&gt; centuries.\n\nI highly doubt the group suicide had anything to do\nwith a Western movie set in Japan. To suggest\notherwise is hogwash. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nTake Yahoo! Mail with you! Get it on your mobile phone.\nhttp://mobile.yahoo.com/maildemo \n\n"
