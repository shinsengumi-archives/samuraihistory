From the point of the Crusaders and\n&gt; those sending them -- at \n&gt; least the ones with the power -- they were\n&gt; definitely honourable.  However, \n&gt; it must not go unsaid that there were probably\n&gt; people with cooler heads that \n&gt; definitely disagreed with them, which, in 20-20\n&gt; retrospect, would have been a \n&gt; Good Thing.  (Genocide is ALWAYS a Bad Thing anyway,\n&gt; but that goes without \n&gt; saying.)  If news of such atrocities had reached\n&gt; Japan, the Crusades and \n&gt; Crusaders, rightly, probably would have been seen as\n&gt; barbaric and inhuman.\n&gt;   Conversely, the warriors in Japan -- both the\n&gt; Samurai and the peasant \n&gt; soldiers used by generals such as ODA Nobunaga --\n&gt; were acting in ways that \n&gt; THEY deemed honourable, and in the &quot;more\n&gt; enlightened&quot; west, were seen, if my \n&gt; memoury serves me correctly, as &quot;heathen savages.&quot;\n&gt;   Anyway, that&#39;s my take.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later,\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; ni hao.\nthis is tim heaton,\ni am curios does anyone know were i can get the book\non the art of nerve blocking,i have tried searching\nthe internet but it gives you a bunch of weird shit\nand still not what ive been looking for and the book\non accupunture on its own accord? i realy would\nappreciate it if anyone can tell me or if by chance if\nanyone has one would you sell it? i have studied many\nof the arts but this is one i know little ,in tai chi\ni have learned a few nerve blocking techniques as part\nof sustaining energy within my arms.please let me know\ni am grateful to anyone who can help.xiexie.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
