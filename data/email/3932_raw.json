If you were dishonorable this would effect\n&gt; not only you but it would tarnish the names of your\n&gt; sons and their familys too. The peasants followed\n&gt; the same code of honor as well so it was not\n&gt; something just to keep the troops loyal.\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: jonathan lee \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 4:02 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hello Vladilen,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Out of interest, what does this word &quot;honor&quot; mean\n&gt; to you? I believe this concept is a sort of fake\n&gt; conciencnesse created created by the people at the\n&gt; top to make loyal soldiers to die for their battles\n&gt; battle. And in fact this &quot;honor&quot; is the most\n&gt; dishounarble thing to follow.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I believe the only honor is the honor to all of\n&gt; mankind and our fellow human beings. This honor\n&gt; includes not to kill another.\n&gt;   What does everybody else think?\n&gt;   Thanks for listening\n&gt;   Jonny\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Vladilen Blackthorne\n&gt; &lt;vladilen_blackthorne@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   I&#39;m new to this site and I do not know much about\n&gt; samurai. But I \n&gt;   hope I have found a group that does know. From\n&gt; what I know fromt \n&gt;   hesite and others is it is the perfect life. at\n&gt; least for me  to die \n&gt;   for the word honor. I only wish I had been born\n&gt; about 250 years \n&gt;   ago.. So maybe I could have fought int he battle\n&gt; of Shiroyama.. and \n&gt;   died with the one thing I understand well I joined\n&gt; to learn  more.. \n&gt;   So I guess.. hi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ---\n&gt;   Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;   Samurai Archives store:\n&gt; http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;   --- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Yahoo!
