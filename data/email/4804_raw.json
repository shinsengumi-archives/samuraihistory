Here&#39;s some summarised \ninformation about him:\n\nSanada Nobushige (Yukimura) was born in 1567, the second son of \nSanada Masayuki. Takeda Shingen died in 1573, and the Takeda clan \nfell to a Toyotomi/Tokugawa invasion in 1582.\n\nOne of the (many) errors in the game has Yukimura fighting at \nNagashino (1575), which seems unlikely, given that he was eight \nyears old at the time.\n\nAfter the fall of the Takeda clan, Sanada Masayuki allied with the \nHojo and became daimyo of Ueda. They later submitted to the \nToyotomi, taking part in the seige of the Hojo&#39;s Odawara castle in \n1590.\n\nIn 1600 during the Sekigahara campaign, Masayuki and Yukimura were \nbeseiged in Ueda by Tokugawa Hidetada. 38,000 Tokugawa beseiged 3000 \nSanada in the castle, but failed to take it, resulting in Hidetada \nmissing the battle of Sekigahara itself (much to Ieyasu&#39;s fury). \nBoth were exiled to Kudoyama, from where Yukimura made his way to \nOsaka to take part in both the Winter and Summer campaigns. During \nall of this, Yukimura&#39;s elder brother Nobuyuki (who had earlier been \nsent as a hostage to the Tokugawa) fought for Ieyasu at the battle \nof Sekigahara itself.\n\nIn the Winter campaign, Yukimura led his men at the Sanada-maru (or \nthe Sanada barbican) which saw some of the fiercest fighting of the \nbattle, where they held off the &quot;Red Devils&quot; (the aka-oni) of the \nIi, with the help of Kimura Shigenari.\n\nIn the Summer campaign, Yukimura was again one of the leading \ndefenders along with Mori Katsunaga, Goto Matabei, Kimura and \nothers. After a lot of heavy fighting (Yukimura&#39;s troops were on the \nfront line) Yukimura sat down to rest (some say he slumped down on a \ncampstool in despair, knowing that his cause was lost) and was \nconfronted by an enemy samurai, Nishio Nizaemon. Too tired to fight, \nhe took off his helmet, and was beheaded.\n\n\n"
