He was a child prodigy who was considered\nmastering in ancient strategy, astrology, mathematics,\nlaw structure, Taoism, Confucianism, music and\nliterature by the time he was recruited by his boss,\nYu-Bang, the descendent of the royal family of the Han\nempire. He did not even have an actual field\nexperience before his first command.\nHe fought with most famouse stratetists including Cho\nCho, the founder of the Wei empire, the great\nstrategist and tactician at that time on numerous\noccassions often in scales of over 400,000 force size,\nnever lost the war and battles.\n\nI would feel trembled by the roaring of a lion, but\nprobabiliy not by that of a jackal.\n\n\n\n  \n                          Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Changsub Lee\n\n\n--- James Eckman &lt;ronin_engineer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   From: &quot;Kyle Segall&quot; &lt;klancesegall@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: War without fighting\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;There&#39;s actually a perfect Japanese example. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Thanks!

Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll tell you this: they were\n&gt; fighting a war with a very \n&gt; &gt;different concept of values than these days. Can\n&gt; you imagine Rommel and Patton \n&gt; &gt;having gotten together for such a confab? &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; No. Nor can I imagine Lee and Grant doing the same!\n&gt; \n&gt; In the West from time to time, there has been\n&gt; efforts to limit the \n&gt; damage to civilians and each other. In most of Asia\n&gt; this is a foreign \n&gt; concept for the most part even today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
