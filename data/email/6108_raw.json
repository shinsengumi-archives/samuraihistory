I guess I worded \n&gt; it wrong, I was looking for something a little more illustrated in \n&gt; the making process. Unfortunatly I am not able to read well. I have \n&gt; a strong dyslexia that makes your instructions text look like \n&gt; Einsteins theory of relitivity. I have made 3 sets of armor from \n&gt; barrel plastic just from your patterns as well as others just by \n&gt; looking at the pictures. I would just like to make a more genuine \n&gt; looking armor now. \n\nAh, I get you -- more an &quot;illustrated step by step&quot; thing. Fraid not -- the \nthing would be HUGE. Plus, for the record, there&#39;s nothing REMOTELY like the \nmanual even in Japanese. Some folks are less than pleased that I did what I did \n(being secrets of the craft and all).\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
