One good effect that Marx and others had on the study of \nhistory is that numbers are important as well, adding to the study of \nhistory a different perspective from the lifestyles of the rich and \nfamous. Fernand Braudel&#39;s books are a good example of this. I hope that \none day there is the equivalent type of book for Asian studies.\n\n&gt;I am glad to say that my own study of Japan and from an SCA perspective is having a positive effect on my own martial training, and daily life.  It&#39;s a very curious process to me, and I am also curious how others approach history and how, if at all, it affects how they live out their daily lives.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSometimes it depresses me, as along the lines of not this **** again.\n\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Mackerel like\n&gt;\n&gt;James,\n&gt;\n&gt;Maybe &#39;sea snake&#39; for a name instead of mackerel, though.  I get images of swinging a mackerel around by it&#39;s tail.  :{\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSo do I, that&#39;s why I like it! I have a chop I made with EKI-MAN on \nit... 10,000 train stations. I have a bizarre sense of humor ;)\n\nhttp://home.comcast.net/~ronin_engineer/railroad.html\n\n&gt;Mackerel tastes pretty good wrapped in green onions on the grill.  \n&gt;\n&lt;Snip food torture message&gt;\n\nLucky I ate dinner, otherwise I would be gnawing my keyboard, I love \ngrilled mackerel!\n\nJim Eckman\n\n"
