In a classic\ncase of gekokujo they took the shiba land and made it\ntheir own.  Within the mess of paper work and fighting\nthey did claim a descent from the taira.  Whether this\nis true is up for debate.\n\nI also wanted to point out that although I knew the\nMinamoto were not destroyed because they were the\nvictors.  I did find out after my last response that\nsome small factions of the taira did survive.  An\nexample of this is the hojo.  This correction was give\nto me by Mr. Bryant(thanks alot).  I also wanted to\npoint ot that the ieyasu&#39;s family claimed descent from\nthe minamoto long bfore he had enough power to\nthreaten the emperor.  However, whether he threatened\nhim to back up the families past claims is unknown to\nme.  \n\nOf course their are many stories in japanese history\nthat are made up as well as family&#39;s with no real\naristocratic past that took names of famous families\nto add prestige to their rule.  But history that has\nno material backing can only be debated an questioned.\n Thats why I write this response.  How do some of the\nother members of this list feel.\n\nThank you for listening to my words.\n\nMusashi\n--- The Dragon of Eternal Rain\n&lt;Shourinou@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;      Thank you for writing back to me. It is said\n&gt; that\n&gt; Nobunaga is of Taira descent. Something I was told\n&gt; that may or may not be true. I felt I should mention\n&gt; it but it may not be true. What I CAN tell you is\n&gt; the\n&gt; following:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) The Minamoto and Taira were NOT destroyed after\n&gt; the\n&gt; Genji-Heike wars. One thing that must be understood\n&gt; is\n&gt; that with almost EVERY Japanese name, there are\n&gt; relatives that took on other names similar to the\n&gt; original names...& sometimes, took on whole new\n&gt; names.\n&gt; There are people still even today of the descent of\n&gt; these two families, as there are existing people of\n&gt; various other families.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Tokugawa DID threaten the emperor with changing\n&gt; his\n&gt; lineage. Its not like the emperor really had a\n&gt; choice\n&gt; anyway: at that time (like many other periods in\n&gt; history) the emperor had no true power so therefore\n&gt; not only was Tokugawa Ieyasu SHOGUN by default, but,\n&gt; had the lineage to defend it (not that many were\n&gt; foolish enough to challenge HIM). Perhaps Ieyasu\n&gt; wished to save face with the people by allowing\n&gt; their\n&gt; ultimate religious leader (the &#39;divine&#39; emperor) to\n&gt; exist as a figurehead.\n&gt; \n&gt;      My point to you is there are many stories that\n&gt; abound even today about these men. Some are true,\n&gt; others are not. I leave to you what you shall\n&gt; decide.\n&gt; But from what I have learned and what I truly KNOW,\n&gt; is\n&gt; true. These were not friendly men, nor friendly\n&gt; times.\n&gt; The sad fact is they acted in ways that people today\n&gt; still do, so is it really so hard to imagine the\n&gt; chosen behavior(s) that were taken to such lengths,\n&gt; really hard to believe?\n&gt; \n&gt; I ask you to ponder this and reply...\n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; &quot;I am Mikhal no Shourinou, son of Toshiro of the\n&gt; village of Rin, and loyal retainer of the Maeda\n&gt; clan.
