I agree with a lot\nof what&#39;s been said. My own complaint about him is that most of his books\nare essentially the same e.g a survey history of the samurai. To stand up\nfor him at least he writes about the samurai in a clear and interesting way.\nYes his books have some errors and sloppy research. However most of the\nmaterial seems accurate enough. I also have the rekishi gunzo series (about\n40 of them), plus the Visual Nihon Rekishi series, Saigen Nihonshi, Sengoku\nHao, and the Sengoku Chronicle, all of these confirm most of what&#39;s in\nTurnbulls books. Unfortunately most other &#39;scholars&#39; in Japanese history are\nmore interested in &#39;fractal spatiality in the provincial rice fields of the\nbakufu&#39; and don&#39;t want to dirty their hands by writing something, heaven\nforbid, for  the average reader. If  more did so and Turnbull had more\ncompetition to deal with then perhaps his books would be better.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: kitsuno &lt;cewest@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, August 13, 2002 7:43 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Turnbull (Was Sekigahara)\n\n\n&gt; ...And what was the &#39;furjimura&#39; issue?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;Mark E.

Stanley Ambrose and Michael\n&gt; Besailles\n&gt; &gt; are two that have come under intense media scrutiny for plagiarism\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; falsification/errors.  And then there was the whole Fujimura scandal\n&gt; &gt; here in Japan.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Later, MEH\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
