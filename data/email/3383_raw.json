Their crack down on\nchristianity wasn&#39;t so much hatred toward christains\nas much as eliminating a disruptive force. The\nsamurai(Oda Nobunaga) also cracked down on the Buddist\nIkko Sect for the same reasons.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nJake\n--- Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Carmen et al-\n&gt; \tIf christians have lots to learn from Samurai, then\n&gt; I would suggest \n&gt; they could learn it ALL from Christian Samurai.
