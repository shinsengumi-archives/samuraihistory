Did you enjoy during you stayed in Japan ?\n   \n    I appreciate you a lot if you could let me know the names of Temples or Shrines  who became interwoven  each other in Japan ?\n    \n   Shrines have no monks at all whatsoever  as Temples have .  Temples in Japan ,or in China, Korea, Thailand ----  have monks always.\n   \n  Please remember that Shinto has nothing to do with Buddhism  , since the begging and untill now. \n   \n   Please remember  the God of Shinto and  Buddhism  is totally different.  \n   \n  So,  the different Gods of the two  cannot stay in the same building. Can you understand ?   \n   \n  The religion of Yuda  and the one of Christ is different.  Same thing.\n  Who is the God of Yuda,  Mose\u001b$B!)!!!!\u001b(BWho is the God of Christ ?\n   \n  My final answer about religion is that you can believe your own God in your heart as you like , and you don&#39;t deny any religion whatsoever.  \n  Any way,  humanbeing is so weak finally and , which being resulted in that you cannot do anything but rely on some God or, the more stronger sprit , or thing than you to get relief and happiness to keep living.\n   \n  Japanese Emperors  were nothing to do with Buddhism  and they were from the God of Shinto.\n   \n  As I mentioned before,  Japanese people , unfortunately, believed The Emperor is God  and the desendants of Japanese Gods.  So Japanese Imperials used this concept leading to Banzai, going to death for Emperor  ,  Kamikaze.  That was tragedy for Japanese.     Meiji Ishin, restoration was wrong\n for that point.  Meiji Emperor was used by low class Bushi like Sathuma,  Choshu,  Tosa, etc  to get upset Japan with some kind of help to succeed the revolution , so called, the fake revolution though I say.  It was not like the real revolution triggered by civilians in France.   \n  Which means, even now Japanese government have limitted power to govern Japanese people and lead to the best performance politically , which resulting in maybe changing the government again in the near future untill Japanese people realize what is the real democracy which almost all European ,\n and Americans enjoy now, whic I predict.\n   \n  However, I still believe  that  Japanese people are forwarding to the same destination as the European  and Americans , so do all Asians ,  Africans,  South Americans,   and  in the future,  all human being s  will get together to live and exist to enjoy mutual understanding , co- prospering,\n and pease  like Mr. Obama aims now.\n   \n  Eddie \n   \n  Thanks\n   \n  Eddie\n\nCearb@... wrote:\n            Eddie--\n\nMy understanding of the history is that Shinto is an animistic religion \nindigenous to Japan, and that there was a certain degree of tension between \nBuddhism and Shinto when Buddhism was first introduced (as you said) from \nChina, but that the two religions became, if not precisely syncretic, then at \nleast interwoven -- that it was to a large extent held that the kami of \nShinto were genuine entities who, like all others, could benefit from the \nBuddha&#39;s enlightenment. (Hence the fact that Shinto shrines are such a common \nfixture in so many Buddhist temples).\n\nI got the impression that this changed substantially during the Meiji \nrestoration and into WWII, when the government pressed the notion of the \nImperial lineage (the descent from Amaterasu-o-Mikami) as evidence that Japan was \nunder the unique protection of the gods / kami, as a result of which a very \nstrict separation of church and state was written into the post-war \nconstitution...\n\nAm I missing anything substantial here? My personal experience of Japan \nwas that the temples and shrines were largely appreciated for their historic \nnature; I seldom saw religious ceremonies going on (apart from New Year&#39;s \nDay, when people arrived, made their offerings, and departed) the way I did \nin Korea, for example. (BTW -- I don&#39;t mean this as any sort of judgment, \nmerely an observation...)\n\n--RMB\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n            \n \n\n \n---------------------------------\nVANCOUVER 2010 Olympic News [Yahoo!
