It was famous\nfor its use of 3000 matchlock guns (muskets) by the samurai led by Oda\nNobunaga to vanquish the  \n&gt; Takeda &quot;cavalry&quot;. \n \nKind of off-topic, but to me Nagashino ranks as probably the most\noverrated battle in Japanese history. The Takeda struggled on for\nanother 7 years - albeit heavily reduced in power - and the losses\nsuffered in the battle probably had a lot more to do with Katsuyori\nbeing heavily outnumbered and in a poor strategic position than the use\nof rifles by Nobunaga. The Takeda themselves had rifles, and I fancy\nthat they weren&#39;t idiotic enough to ride straight in to a wave of\ngunfire ala the Nagashino scene in &#39;Kagemusha&#39;. Katsuyori may not have\nbeen as talented as his father, but I&#39;m sure he wasn&#39;t as big a fool as\nhe tends to get credited for either.\n \nStill, it probably is the most famous battle post-Kamakura, except for\nmaybe Sekigahara, which is far more interesting in my opinion.\n \n-AngusH\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
