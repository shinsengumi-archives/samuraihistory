Subjective\nthreads like this one arouse more emotion than they\nshould, especially since there isn&#39;t a &quot;right&quot; or\n&quot;wrong&quot;. Now, if you want to start quoting Stephen\nHayes and tell me that Nobunaga&#39;s son Katsuyori\nattacked a ninja clan because his dad fell off a\nhorse...\n\n(Explanation: I&#39;m currently putting myself through the\nagony of reading his book--and I use that term only\nbecause it has pages and is bound--about the mystical\norigins of Ninjutsu--insert appropriate oohs and ahs\nhere. The endstate is a review on Amazon so that no\none every BUYS this filth--I borrowed it from my\nlibrary. Anyways, none of Nobunaga&#39;s sons, as most of\nyou know, were named Katsuyori. Takeda Katsuyori was\nthe enemy he defeated at Nagashino. Anyone doing\n&quot;research&quot; for a &quot;book&quot; might want to at least know\nTHAT much history, but I digress.)\n\n&gt; P.S.  For you other &#39;digest&#39; recipients:  _please_,\n&gt; when you&#39;re answering a\n&gt; post, delete the other irrelevant posts.  I&#39;ve been\n&gt; getting a string of five\n&gt; or six consecutive messages unrelated to current\n&gt; topics for the better part\n&gt; of a week.  I mean, sure, those are some good\n&gt; messages:  but.\n\nGood point, and a reminder on some posting etiquette:\nPlease, if you can, delete whatever in the message you\nare replying to that doesn&#39;t actually have a bearing\non your reply. This includes those annoying little\nsignatures at the bottom of emails, the Yahoo ads,\netc. And for most, it&#39;s helpful if you either\nin-context post, or bottom post. If you post at the\ntop of a reply, one has to search through the message\nat the bottom to see the message to which you are\nreplying, and that can get confusing. \n\nThanks,\n\nThe Department of Redundancy Department. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
