Just wondering something.  In some of the things I have \nread, although where escapes me, I have seen it attributed to Uesugi Kenshin \nand Takeda Shingen that they were great rivals with each other.  The evidence \ny&#39;all have presented paints a somewhat different picture.  Did they ever \nbattle each other than the Kawanakajima series of battles?  And another \nquestion: what&#39;s a Kagemusha?  (Or an &quot;onimusha&quot; for that matter -- other \nthan the incredible video game series.)  And this Arakawa Izu no Kami -- am I \ncorrect, from what I&#39;ve learned from the Samurai Archives site, in \ntranslating this to mean Arakawa, Lord of Izu?  Just wondering.  :-)  Thanks, \ny&#39;all.  Y&#39;all are a wonderful help to me to understand this fascinating \nperiod and place in history, especially since the story I&#39;m writing&#39;s set in \nit.  :-D  Thanks again.  :-D\n\nLater.\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
