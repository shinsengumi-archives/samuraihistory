Etymology is irrelevant.=A0 I&#39;m talking about the job.\n&gt;=\r\n  Would it make any difference if I said &quot;the cook outranks\n&gt;  the busboy,&quot;=\r\n or are you going to find something from the\n&gt;  dictionary for that?\n\nConsi=\r\ndering that a sous chef generally calls the chef &quot;Chef&quot; and not \n&quot;Joe&quot; sugg=\r\nests that it is more like a rank than you suppose.\nIn contrast, your garage=\r\n mechanics probably call each other by \nnicknames.\n\n&gt;  Tell that to all tho=\r\nse sengoku guys who were &quot;ashigaru\n&gt;  taicho,&quot; and &quot;teppo taicho,&quot; and &quot;yum=\r\nitori taicho&quot;...\n\nTony. I am perfectly willing to believe you, but it would=\r\n be nice to \ncite a war tale or some other source so that folks such as mys=\r\nelf can \ngo look at for themselves. However, from your examples, they sound=\r\n like \nsmall unit commanders. Incidentally, unit sizes are not universal ev=\r\nen \nin modern and Roman armies. The size of a Roman century was frequently =\r\n\nsomething other than 100. Regardless, &quot;taich=F4&quot; is not in Kodansha \nKogoj=\r\niten. Incidentally, the definition for tai in daijirin 1st edition \nsuggest=\r\ns that a tai is a fairly small unit capable of unitary movement \non the bat=\r\ntlefield. Interestingly, taich=F4 appears to be a vague term. \nSince people=\r\n appear to be generally interested in ranks, possibly one \nof the oldest ra=\r\nnks is goch=F4. The reason I am suggesting this isthat I \nrecollect seeing =\r\nthe go in goch=F4 on flags in battle paintings.\n\n&gt;  &gt;=A0 &gt;=A0 In any feudal=\r\nly structured army, ALL positions and=A0 duties are \n&gt; held\n&gt;  &gt;=A0 &gt; at th=\r\ne pleasure of the overlord in question.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Not quite so simple. A me=\r\ndieval unit commander can &quot;own&quot; his unit \n&gt; and\n&gt;  &gt; owe service to his ove=\r\nrlord. Medieval commanders did not have quite \n&gt; the\n&gt;  &gt; personnel reassig=\r\nnment capability as that of a modern army. \n&gt; Regardless,\n&gt;  &gt; what was goi=\r\nng on in Japan can be quite complex having to do with \n&gt; shiki\n&gt;  &gt; rights,=\r\n parallel rank and appointment systems, and all sorts of \n&gt; other\n&gt;  &gt; stuf=\r\nf.\n&gt;\n&gt;  And how does ANY of that change the facts as I&#39;ve stated them?\n\nTon=\r\ny there are plenty of perfectly good books out there about \ndistinctions in=\r\n land tenure. You appear to be suggesting that all of \nthese were appointiv=\r\ne and held from above. I am pointing out that at \nleast in some feudal soci=\r\neties there is a distinction between various \nsorts of land tenure. You see=\r\n these with new fields, permanent \ncommendations, &c. If my books weren&#39;t o=\r\nff in a storage building, I \nwould cite you a specific source on this one, =\r\nbut can not at the \nmoment. Finally, taking your unit and switching sides a=\r\nnd similar \nindependence was a fairly common feature of pre-modern and spec=\r\nifically \nmedieval warfare.\n\nRegardless, one of the problems of feudally st=\r\nructured armies is that \nyou can not so easily separate Patton from his div=\r\nision or MacArthur \nfrom his army. Even fairly recently, military units mig=\r\nht be raised and \nequipped by their commanders.\n\n[Non-text portions of this=\r\n message have been removed]\n\n\n"
