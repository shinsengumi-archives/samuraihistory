I know you guys are really smart here so can you help\nme? \n &gt; I know he was born 1137 and died 1179 when taken ill,he was also the \n &gt; eldest son of Kiyomori,and a general. It&#39;s been close to no help \n &gt; online, I&#39;ve even checked the samurai archives! The library has 1\nbook \n &gt; on samurai and because Im a 14 year old who I have no license to go \n &gt; anywhere else...so if you have any suggestions or information I would\n\n &gt; eppreciate your assistance very much.\n &gt; \n &gt; Thank you!\n \nHe was, as you say, the eldest son of Kiyomori and his heir, but died at\na pretty inconvenient time for his clan. I don&#39;t know where you&#39;d find\nmuch more than a couple of paragraphs written about him in an\nEnglish-language history book though, as most of the focus on the Taira\nclan is generally centred on his father. He was, like most of the other\nTaira clan members, a nobleman more than a general.\n \nThere are a number of passages involving Shigemori in the Heike\nMonogatari (Tale of the Heike), and there&#39;s a great translation from\nHelen McCullough available from most online bookstores and probably some\nlibraries as well. The historical accuracy of the Heike Monogatri is\nquestionable to say the least, but the image it paints of Shigemori has\nbecome commonly accepted, accurate or not.\n \n-AngusH\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
