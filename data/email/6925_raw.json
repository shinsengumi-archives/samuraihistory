I read in the\n&gt; misconceptions link that ninja carried samurai\n&gt; swords since they were samurai. \n\nGood--at least someone follows the rules and reads\nthese things.\n\nBut when I read this\n&gt; email about someone saying that a samurai was the\n&gt; superior fighter because of the sword I had to ask\n&gt; exactly what they meant. Samurai vs nija is really\n&gt; samurai vs. samurai.\n\nSaid person is working in a land of misconceptions.\nThere is no difference in swords, ninja aren&#39;t\nmystical warriors who ran around in black pajamas, and\npeople need to go read some actual history books\ninstead of watching Shogun over and over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
