Akechi Mitsuhide wouldn&#39;t have been \nthought so poor had he actually succeeded in becoming Shogun (his \nalliances not fallen apart, the mori finding out about nobunaga&#39;s \ndeath before hideyoshi). Don&#39;t kid yourself into think he really did \nanything special. Just dumb.\nThe daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai \nreally believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to see \nthat. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the \npeacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.\nYou claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its true \nthat confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far \nfrom a system of honor, especially what you&#39;re thinking about. Think \nabout it; if you&#39;re a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what \nlittle time you have off, what room is there for the &quot;honor&quot; that \nyou think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do \nanything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure preaches \nabout may be true... but that wasn&#39;t really out of a sense of honor.\n\nI don&#39;t recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the noble \nones. I doubt an ashigaru wielding a spear was shouting, &quot;I am so-\nand-so, from so-and-so village! Come get some!&quot;\n\nAnd sorry about the snappy remarks... I&#39;m just SICK of all these \nkids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for every \nage, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his actions. \nOnly famous for who he killed and how dumb he was in doing it.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dave Jackson \n&lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; To Kyle Segall:\n&gt; \n&gt; What I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see \nbelow) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. \nThe point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording \nit in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai \nclass placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and \ntheir familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act \nagainst Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name \nof his family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and \nyour father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from \na bad family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your \npedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has \ndozens of acounts. I ain&#39;t no kid, I have read about this subject \nfor many years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with \nme fine but a little manners on your part would be nice.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Kyle Segall \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 8:56 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Holy crap kid, do some freaking research.

If you were \n&gt;   dishonorable this would effect not only you but it would tarnish \nthe \n&gt;   names of your sons and their familys too. The peasants followed \nthe \n&gt;   same code of honor as well so it was not something just to keep \nthe \n&gt;   troops loyal.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; best regards\n&gt;   &gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   &gt;   From: jonathan lee \n&gt;   &gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   &gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 4:02 AM\n&gt;   &gt;   Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Hello Vladilen,\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Out of interest, what does this word &quot;honor&quot; mean to you? I \n&gt;   believe this concept is a sort of fake conciencnesse created \ncreated \n&gt;   by the people at the top to make loyal soldiers to die for their \n&gt;   battles battle. And in fact this &quot;honor&quot; is the most \ndishounarble \n&gt;   thing to follow.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   I believe the only honor is the honor to all of mankind and \nour \n&gt;   fellow human beings. This honor includes not to kill another.\n&gt;   &gt;   What does everybody else think?\n&gt;   &gt;   Thanks for listening\n&gt;   &gt;   Jonny\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Vladilen Blackthorne &lt;vladilen_blackthorne@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;   I&#39;m new to this site and I do not know much about samurai. \nBut I \n&gt;   &gt;   hope I have found a group that does know. From what I know \nfromt \n&gt;   &gt;   hesite and others is it is the perfect life. at least for \nme  to \n&gt;   die \n&gt;   &gt;   for the word honor. I only wish I had been born about 250 \nyears \n&gt;   &gt;   ago.. So maybe I could have fought int he battle of \nShiroyama.. \n&gt;   and \n&gt;   &gt;   died with the one thing I understand well I joined to learn  \n&gt;   more.. \n&gt;   &gt;   So I guess.. hi\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   ---\n&gt;   &gt;   Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;   &gt;   Samurai Archives store: \nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;   &gt;   --- \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Yahoo!
