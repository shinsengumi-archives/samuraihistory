Bryant\u001b$B$5$s\u001b(B wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; This is very well said! In fact (as you and I have exchanged on this \n&gt;&gt; list before), even the title Shogun is not in essence a &quot;rank&quot;. It \n&gt;&gt; is really a job description. IN fact the title &quot;Shogun&quot; is not even \n&gt;&gt; part of the Shoku-i ranking system.\n&gt;\n&gt;Actually, IIRC, it&#39;s a fifth-court-rank position.\n\nCan you help me to improve my knowlege by pointing to any resources \nthat would confirm your recollection?\n\n&gt;The thing is, it is VERY important to divorce the concept of terminology of\n&gt;MILITARY rank from samurai -- they just don&#39;t operate on the same level. There\n&gt;is rank, yes, but that&#39;s SOCIAL rank, not military rank.\n\nI agree with this in the main - but I think the definition being \nused of &#39;rank&#39; here is a bit too narrow. I personally am not trying \nto identify a US Army-style  &#39;rank and progression&#39; system in the \nsengoku era.\n\n&gt;There&#39;s no rule. In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and duties are\n&gt;held at the pleasure of the overlord in question.\n\nOf course. But look again at how I structured my sentance. &quot;It seems \nto me that once &#39;promoted&#39; to ashigaru-gashira a person would not go \nback to being a plain ashigaru.&quot; I would be very interested in \nlearning about any cases where it did happen.\n\n&gt; There is no way to say &quot;I&#39;m a\n&gt;first sergeant, you can&#39;t make me a private without due cause and a\n&gt;court-martial.&quot;\n\nTotally agree. Of course I would agree, since I in no way implied in \nthe first place that I though any such notion might exist.\n\n&gt; Even &quot;permanent&quot; appointments (such as that of a taicho^) in a\n&gt;Japanese army were understood to be continued appointments that could be\n&gt;withdrawn at any time (or magnified with further postings) and not one&#39;s \n&gt;&quot;right&quot;\n&gt;to the position.\n\nI have no idea where these references to &#39;rights&#39; and courts martial \nare coming from. I hope not in reaction to anything that I wrote.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
