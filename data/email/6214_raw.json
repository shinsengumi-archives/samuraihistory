I don&#39;t know about this subject, so I would \n&gt; like to see your point of view, especially since you are in the \n&gt; marine, if I remember correctly.\n\nCogs and caravelles were no longer being used, I believe, by the mid 16th \ncentury. The Iberian ships traveling around Asia were typically referred to as \ngalleons, although in the 1540s they were probably fairly early types with some \ncaravelle features still in place.\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
