If that is the case, then it would make sense that the  hitokiri would be isolationists, because the Shinsengumi were pawns of  the shogunate. Also, he was originally from Kumamoto which makes sense  geographically if you follow this line of thinking. I cant remember if  Kawakami was mentioned specifically in Hillsborough&#39;s book, but his  book on the Shinsengumi was very good. Im sure most of the readings  related to this topic will be in Japanese though.\n  \n  Jonathan\n\njames wilson &lt;johntwo8@...&gt; wrote:        Izo Okada another of the imfamous 4 hitokiri and a personal  favorite. However, is it true that Kawakami would want Japan to be  closed off? Wasn&#39; t that what he was fighting aginst. Please correct me  if I am incorrect.
