They \nsaid there are four great hitokiri at that time...\n&gt; \n\n   I&#39;ve heard of a hitokiri by the name of Kawakami Gensai, he was one \nof the four great assassins of the revolutionary period. He was short \nand shinny, and could be mistaken at first glance for a woman. \nContrary to his appearance, he was clever and clear-head despite also \nbeing the most dreaded among all the hitokiri.\n   Master of an original sword-style called &quot;Shiranui-ryu&quot;, Kawakami \nis famous for felling the great idealist Sakuma Shozan in one swing, \nin mid-day. Kawakami is nevertheless a mysterious figure.\n   After the revolution he was unable to let go of the idea that Japan \nshould remain closed to the world. Kawakami found himself in frequent \nconflict with the revolutionary government. Ultimately, he was accused \nof a crime he did not commit and executed in the 4th year of Meiji. Oh \nand Kenshin Himura, from Rurouni Kenshin is based on Kawakami, and I \ndont know who the other Hitokiri&#39;s are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS \n        Samurai   Japan   Japan airline \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
