The U=\r\nS doesn&#39;t \n&gt; have\n&gt; the records that Europe or Japan has. Possibly because =\r\nin the US\n&gt; citizenship is determined by where you are born and your parent=\r\ns\n&gt; citizenship if you are born outside of the US. Unlike for example\n&gt; Ger=\r\nmany where 4th generation Turks are not citizens and people of \n&gt; German\n&gt; =\r\nancestory can become German citizens quite rapidly.
