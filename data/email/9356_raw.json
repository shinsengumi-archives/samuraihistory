First, I made the mista=\r\nke of going directly to the current Honnoji,\nbut was told that Honnoji had =\r\nbeen relocated since Nobunaga&#39;s death. The guy\nat the temple pointed me in =\r\nthe general direction to go, but I really didn&#39;t\nknow the exactly location.=\r\n So with some difficulty, I eventually figured out\nwhere the marker was loc=\r\nated so I could hike out to find it. I found the\nlocation by visiting a nea=\r\nrby museum of history that was very close to\nHonnoji. The museum had histor=\r\nical maps and tourist maps for sale, and I\nasked a woman at the museum info=\r\nrmation booth where the old Honnoji was.\nBetween the two of us, we searched=\r\n one of the maps and we figured out where\nthe old Honnoji was. If I recall =\r\ncorrectly, it was about a twenty minute\ntwenty-five minute walk from Honnoj=\r\ni. When I found it, the marker was pretty\nnon-descript. The marker was rela=\r\ntively modest grey stone, to my\nrecollection perhaps 70-80 centimeters tall=\r\n, located in a very non-descript\nresidential neighborhood. The marker itsel=\r\nf was located immediately in front\nof the commercial office of a model hous=\r\ne showroom and an elementary school.\nThe kids were laughing, playing, shout=\r\ning in the background. I don&#39;t think\nthat I have a photo of it. I&#39;m not muc=\r\nh of a photography kind of guy.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike \n\n_____ \n\nFrom: samuraihist=\r\nory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\nyahoogroups.com [mailto:samu=\r\nraihistory@\n&lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com]\nOn B=\r\nehalf Of Anthony Bryant\nSent: Friday, February 09, 2007 4:54 AM\nTo: samurai=\r\nhistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\nyahoogroups.com\nSubject:=\r\n Re: [samuraihistory] Re: death of nobunaga and jube yagyu\n\nOn Feb 7, 2007,=\r\n at 4:07 PM, Nate Ledbetter wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, theres&#39; a small marker in =\r\nfront of some\n&gt; building--I thing it&#39;s a hotel--that marks the former\n&gt; spo=\r\nt of the Honnoji.
