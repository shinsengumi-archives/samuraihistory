To save his and his family&#39;s honor! If =\r\nhe is lucky, he will have a &quot;Kaishaku&quot;.

Not failure, but death was thier way of life. They dont glori=\r\nfy death, but accept it as a part of thier duty and honor. Of course they e=\r\nxpect to be victorious in battle always! But they also accept death as a pa=\r\nrt of that victory!\n=C2=A0\nAs for medicine, if a Samurai was not mortally w=\r\nounded, I heard they used salt to stop the bleeding.
