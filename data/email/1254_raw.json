As \nsomeone else as said, I doubt if samurai were in the habit of \nshowing swords to each other. In the Civil War era you were \nnever sure who you could trust, and in the Edo period you were \nnever sure how someone might react from what you say.\n\nTo offer a quick paraphrase, one man offered a compliment \nregarding the other&#39;s blade, but the other guy took it as a \nveiled jibe, &quot;are you implying that I am not man enough for\nthis blade!&quot; The next moment they&#39;re killing each other.\n\nThere are strict rules of ettiquette with regard to the \nhandling of swords taught in the martial ryu, not the least \nbecause there&#39;s always the chance that when you show someone \nyour sword he then kills you with it.\n\nAn example:\n\nThe two men are kneeling opposite each other. The man passing \nthe sword holds it horizontally, blade towards himself, one \nhand on the scabbard and one on the hilt.\n\nAs he passes it, the receiver also takes a grip of both \nscabbard and hilt, and rolls the blade edge inward towards \nhimself as he takes it.\n\n* * *\n\nThis is founded on the principle that:\na - if you hand a sword over holding just the scabbard, the \nreceiver can grab the hilt, draw the blade and cut you. You can \ndo likewise to him as he receives it.\n\nb - if you hold just the hilt, the scabbard might slip off \n(although the fit should be sufficient to prevent this \nhappening - they do wear in time, and worse things have \nhappened).\n\nLikewise turning the blade edge towards oneself means it is \nharder to draw (because of the curve), and the blade edge is \nnot pointing at the other guy (plain good manners).\n\nApart from that, it&#39;s purely a matter of politeness. It&#39;s \nimpolite to point a drawn blade at someone, or its edge, in any \ncountry. Swords are sharp and can cut, and for this reason \nalone should be treated with respect. Imagine someone \nshowing you his gun by pointing it at your face!\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
