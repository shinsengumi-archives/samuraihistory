Will\n&gt; someone please answer \n&gt; the following questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Can you give me some information on the orgin of\n&gt; the samurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. What was the final outcome of the civil war\n&gt; between the Taira clan \n&gt; and the Minamoto clan?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. What weapons and armour were preferred by the\n&gt; samurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. How did the samurai view death?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. What eventually led to the downfall of the\n&gt; samurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!\nhttp://sbc.yahoo.com\n\n\n"
