WWII was not such a perod. \nBTW, according to an authorized biography he was not of samurai \nbloodline but was adopted by the Yamamoto family to perpetuate their \nname.  It was a great name and he was a great man.  (But I don&#39;t like \nhim because he bombed my family on Oahu).\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kentguy212002&quot; &lt;kentguy212002@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The question appears who is the most famous general known outside \nof \n&gt; japan then surely it mustbe adimiral yamamoto of pearl harbour and \n&gt; midway fame. Im not sure if his family are samurai stock but the \nmand \n&gt; deserves at least the same respect.\n\n\n"
