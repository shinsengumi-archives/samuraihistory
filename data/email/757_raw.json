I am reading James Clavell&#39;s book shogun for the \n&gt; second time. What I am wondering is why he has mixed up the names of \n&gt; the Minomoto and Fujiwara clans. In the book the names are printed \nas \n&gt; Fujimoto and Minowara. There are also other name innacurracies. Does \n&gt; anyone know if this was done because the book is a work of fiction?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff M.\n\n\n"
