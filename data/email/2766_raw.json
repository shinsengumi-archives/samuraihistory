Another couple was \ndisappointed that they would have to cross the country to see the Amish. \nWhen I arrived the first time in Japan, I was a bit sad that it was so \nWesternized. Too much chanbara ;)\n\n&gt;   From: Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, yeah, actually that was so. If you read the very informative and \n&gt;entertaining autobiography of Fukuzawa Yukichi, when he fist visits the \n&gt;US he is really puzzled at finding out how Americans do knowvery little \n&gt;about their ancestors. \n&gt;\nThat&#39;s me, with no real way of finding out either. The US doesn&#39;t have \nthe records that Europe or Japan has. Possibly because in the US \ncitizenship is determined by where you are born and your parents \ncitizenship if you are born outside of the US. Unlike for example \nGermany where 4th generation Turks are not citizens and people of German \nancestory can become German citizens quite rapidly. Same issues with \nKoreans born in Japan.\n\n&gt;Subject: Re: New Member Arrival\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for the information.  I do have a follow up question.  What is a Taiga \n&gt;drama and where could I rent the one about Saigo Takamori?  Is there any \n&gt;chance it has English subtitles?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNHK has a one year long series that usually historical in nature on \nSundays. They are high budget with famous actors. The current one that \njust ended this week on NHK and TV Japan was Musashi. if you can rent \nit, I recommend it. Hopefully they will come out with a six hour version \nlike some of the other dramas so people who missed it can see the \nhighlights.\n\nIn San Francisco JTOWN there are a couple of rental stores that have TV \nseries same with San Jose, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View.\n\nThe Santa Clara county library system has about 500 Japanese language \nvideos, a few that I&#39;ve seen deal with Meiji, I haven&#39;t seen one that \ndeals directly with Saigo yet. If you live in California, you might be \nable to get the videos via interlibrary loan. Otherwise you might have \nto mail order from Japan which means no subtitles. A bit of a problem \nfor me if they have too much of an accent.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n"
