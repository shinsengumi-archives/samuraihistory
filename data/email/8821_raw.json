Some people are extraordinarily well read.\nUnfortunately, however, some others haven&#39;t had the opportunity to read and\nlearn much Japan history. I myself am far *less* knowledgeable than many on\nthis list. I try to learn something new every day, which is why I enjoy this\nlist.\n\n \n\nWhat is the best way to respond to less knowledgeable members or various\nmisconceptions of history? How can we raise the level of discourse on this\nlist to make this list more informative for all, without becoming elitist or\ninsulting to those less knowledgeable? Currently the level of discourse on\nthe new Samurai Citadel website seems higher, but as was said, &quot;ninja can\nenter anywhere&quot; at anytime. I suspect similar problems might occur over time\non the Samurai Citadel, as numbers of members increase. \n\n \n\nSome questions for thought and discussion\n\n1)       What is it about Japan history and samurai history that seems to\nfoster over-romanticizing and wild historical inaccuracies?\n\n2)       Can we &quot;market&quot; the samurai list in such a way that the purpose of\nthe list is better communicated to list members and potential members? How\ncan we better communicate our purpose as discussion of serious (but fun)\nJapan history, as opposed to discussion of the ninja crowd, or video game\naficionados, or martial artists, or manga?  \n\n3)       What is the best approach to handing members who are less informed?\n\n\n4)       Can we create a discussion environment where we encourage more open\nfree discussion without intimidation, and yet still raise the level of\ndiscourse?\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nMike\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
