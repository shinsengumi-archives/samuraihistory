(In fact, swor=\r\nds seem to appear more \nfrequently in various mythologies than other weapon=\r\ns, but perhaps that&#39;s because \nthey were common to many cultures.)\n\nYou als=\r\no make it sound as if Buddhism and Shinto are mutually exclusive, \nbut if t=\r\nhat were true, it seems unlikely that so many Buddhist temples \nthroughout =\r\nJapan would include Shinto shrines somewhere on their grounds. It \nseems to=\r\n me -- from both study and personal experience -- that Shinto is as \ndeeply=\r\n ingrained in the national character as Conficianism is in the Chinese \ncul=\r\nture. I&#39;m saying this not only based on texts by both foreigners and \nJapan=\r\nese, but on the simple basis of how ubiquitous Shinto symbolism is \nthrough=\r\nout the country. \n\nOn another matter... Speaking of the northern Imperial l=\r\nine, can you (or \nanyone on the forum) tell me who, if any of them, might s=\r\ntill have clung to \ntheir claim to the throne around 1500?
