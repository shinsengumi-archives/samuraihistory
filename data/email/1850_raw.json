(this is\na long one...)\n\n\n&gt; Where does this social protocal come from.  My point is that social\nprotocol from you might be different then what it is from me.  So how do\ndisagreements get worked out.  If there is no moral bases for us both to\nlive by, then we both can live however we chose, and not be responsible to\nanyone or anything because we live according to our own needs, wants,\nculture, up bringing, whatever.  Your logic is flawed, you state that there\nis a social protocol we must adhere too in one statement, and then you go on\nto state that each culture has its own standard by which to live by.  So I\nguess in your logic I (being a country) can invade you (being another\ncountry) for reason that are only believed or adhered too by my country and\nbe in the right.  Or I being a thief can invade your house and still money\nand say that society did it to me, I need to steal to survive, and not get\npunished.  Thank God there is a an ultimate moral truth or there would be\ncomplete anarchy.\n&gt;\n&gt; How are the world wars an example of the moral codes being bent.  They\nwhere unjust acts that where wrong.  Simple as that, it doesnt take rocket\nscience to figure out that killing millions of people is evil.\n&gt;\n&gt; The commandment is Thou shall not murder.\n&gt;\n&gt; Its always easier to do evil then good, and people are by nature going to\ndo wrong before they do good.  But then again according to your logic there\nis no good or evil because we all have different opinions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Greg Quaresma\n&gt;\n&gt; gquaresma@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
