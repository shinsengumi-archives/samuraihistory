The Shimazu\nand Ryuzoji clans were not. They were two very\npowerfull clans that only delt with europeans for\nguns. Many of the clans that did turn to Christianity\ndid so out of desperation and attain aid from their\nenemies. A good example being the Arima clan. Now the\nOtomo Clan is a different example. But their Daimyo&#39;s\nconversion cost them many retainers and weakened them\nin the face of the Shimazu and Ryuzoji.\n\nJake\n--- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; You draw an interesting parallel with\n&gt; Christianity--maybe that &quot;self-death&quot; was what\n&gt; appealed to many samurai in the late 1500&#39;s, when\n&gt; many, especially from Kyushu, became Catholic. Also,\n&gt; submission of will to a higher lord is definitely\n&gt; something I think they could identify with. I&#39;d be\n&gt; careful, though, in getting too wrapped up in\n&gt; Bushido--Bushido is a peacetime compilation of\n&gt; ideals,\n&gt; and certainly not something every samurai ever lived\n&gt; up to, or even pretended to. It didn&#39;t come about\n&gt; until after the major civil war period was over, and\n&gt; many see it as a justification for a warrior class\n&gt; that had no wars left to fight. Not to say the\n&gt; ideals\n&gt; aren&#39;t themselves good per se, just that it tends to\n&gt; get over-romanticized.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Carmen Campo &lt;carmen_campo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Thanks, Nate/Thom.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As christians we are all called to die to\n&gt; ourselves.\n&gt; &gt; So I can relate very\n&gt; &gt; well with the death poems of the samurai. I\n&gt; believe\n&gt; &gt; just like them that\n&gt; &gt; a good death is a glorious death when your will is\n&gt; &gt; fully surrendered and\n&gt; &gt; submitted to the One who gave His son to die for\n&gt; &gt; all. Dying is not an end \n&gt; &gt; at all but a beginning. But this might be scary\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; some westerners (I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; from the east so that might explain something) so\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s okay. Sorry, to bring\n&gt; &gt; the subject up here. But that&#39;s what amazes me\n&gt; most\n&gt; &gt; with the Samurai.\n&gt; &gt; I should read the Bushido next. I do admire them\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; their bravery and art\n&gt; &gt; and nobility. And christians could learn so much\n&gt; &gt; from them. I look at\n&gt; &gt; the cherry blossoms and I am humbled...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; carmen \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
