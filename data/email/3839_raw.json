He has his his strict way to live and criticises a lot in the way men think of the today (in his time of cause) while he lives like a samurai.\nShort passages of his way gives ous a good look of something we cant completly make ourself of because to understand we have to live like him.\nhope thats something helps you to your question. More i can tell you about, if i know more precisely what you want to know about!\n \nLars\n\nsamuraionikiller@... wrote:\nHas anyone read The Way of the Samurai by Hakagure?
