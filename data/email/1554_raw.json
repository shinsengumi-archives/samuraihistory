I\nwent to to it last year to find it closed along with\nall the shops in that row. they had riped the shops\nout for reconstruction. They didnt have any relocation\ndetails which was a shame. \n\nThat shop was really cheap.\n\nThere was also the Japan centre near Soho, you would\nsometimes pay almost double the yen price there. I\nwont shop there now\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n--- &quot;shogun.uk&quot; &lt;shogun.uk@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nHi Rob\n\nI get my Japanese Publications now direst from Japan.\nThere is a Japanese Amazon but frightning for non\nJapanese readers!!\nThey must be well into the seventies now with their\n&quot;red series&quot; but there are many more similar works of\ninterest... and as I always say &quot;.. the pictures are\nin English!!&quot;.\n\nI have also obtained several of the volumes from the\nJapanese Publications Centre - I am not upto date\nregardng the location of it at present but there was a\nshop near St Paul&#39;s Cathedral (the one in Warwick St\nin central London closed) - There was also a large\nshop inthe Japanese Retail outlet Centre (forgot the\nname , sorry!!) on Edgware Road.
