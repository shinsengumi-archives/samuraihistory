So any organization that does that, whether its al quaida or the united nations, is evil.  That also goes for individuals.  \n\nThe terrorist my friend where trying to kill people, sorry to let down.  There mission was to kill as many Americans as possible.  That is what terrorist do.  Use terror as a weapon.  \n\nAnything or anyone that tries to control another person or people unjustly is wrong.  Religion, political group, whatever, its wrong.  What you seem to forget here is that the terrorist attacked the US.  \n\nAnd yes radical Islam is the problem most Muslims are not radical in nature.  But groups like al quaida that want to make all western Christendom Muslim are evil and wrong.  Again going to my point earlier that anybody that wants to control another unjustly is wrong\n\nAnd regarding Jesus Christ he was and still is for just war.\n\nRegards,\nGreg Quaresma\n&quot;There are no atheist in foxholes&quot;\ngquaresma@...\n\n\n"
