You can&#39;t say anyone was the greatest\nsamurai, because samurai were a large group of people who did different\nthings. Not all samurai were soldiers/commanders/sword instructors etc.,\neven in the 16th century and before. Some were purely administrators or\nteachers or whatever. It would be like me asking who the greatest office\ncubicle worker is. You could say that Musashi was the greatest swordsman\never, but even that would be pure speculation.\n \nWhen I think of &quot;Greatest Samurai&quot;, I think of the samurai who had the\ngreatest impact on history, so guys like Tokugawa Ieyasu, Minamoto no\nYoritomo, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, et al. spring to mind straight away.\nMusashi&#39;s accomplishments seem near non-existant when compared to the\nlikes of these figures.\n \nAngus\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
