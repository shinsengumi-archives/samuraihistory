What else would he have been?&quot;\n\nis brutally vague in the extreme.  If you cant give a single detail \nmore on this, or even where you found it, I can guarantee that no one \nwill be able to help you. This: \n\n&quot;:YOU_ think it&#39;s out of a bad romance novel, it isn&#39;t. I won&#39;t \ndisclose why It&#39;s proven, but I can guarantee it.&quot;  \n\nis absolutely worthless information, and after posting something like \nthat I seriously doubt anyone will even be interested in helping you. \nDo you want actual information on this, or are you just trying to \nplay some childish quiz game?  If you are playing some sort of quiz \ngame, I dont think anyone else is playing.  If you WANT information, \nyou are going to need to be more specific.  \n\nAnother word of friendly advice, if you get offended every time \nanyone says anything that doesnt sit well with you, you are not going \nto get far in life, or you will give yourself a heart attack.\n\nRegards,\n\nYour list owner.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tenshi, Rose, and Toni&quot; \n&lt;madmadotakuchick@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    What do you mean &quot;that explains it&quot;?
