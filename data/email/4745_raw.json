While I \n&gt; think that most of us takes pride in being capable to help with \n&gt; specific issues, I believe that users with a very BASIC question should \n&gt; do their homework first, and then come here and ask questions.\n&gt; To ask what was a daimyo is a bit like asking what was a European \n&gt; feudal lord. It&#39;s a VERY generic, broad question, and accordingly there \n&gt; is PLENTY of information about it.\n&gt; idiotkid43, use google, or GO TO THE LIBRARY of your university, and \n&gt; then come back with more specific questions, and perhaps with some \n&gt; greetings and signature at the end of your message.\n&gt; cheers,\n\nCesare, you beat me to it.
