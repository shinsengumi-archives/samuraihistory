A ko-dachi is a short tachi blade and\ntends to be slimmer and longer in sugata than most wakizashi and is properly\nmounted in tachi koshirae. In other words it is a smaller slung sword whilst\na wakizashi is worn with the cutting edge uppermost and is paired with a\nkatana to form the daisho. In modern kendo kata, as we have said before, the\nshorter bokuto is also refered to in common usage as a kodachi.\nMay I take this opportunity of wishing all the colonial members (joke!)of\nthis list a happy Independence Day.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Carlo Tacchini&quot; &lt;TSUBAME1@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, July 03, 2004 10:30 PM\nSubject: R: [samuraihistory] Re: Another sword question\n\n\n&gt; Another possible theory is that Kodachi is only an older (or another)\n&gt; name for the companion sword that changed during the times. Once, the\n&gt; companion sword wasn&#39;t regulated by length-rules and it went from\n&gt; something like a long Tanto for collecting heads or close combat in full\n&gt; armor (IoroiDoshi) till to short swords, often in hirazukuri style. The\n&gt; worldwide known ShinogiZukuri style Wakizashi as a smaller replica of\n&gt; the main blade went in fashion later, even if ShinogiZukuri wasn&#39;t an\n&gt; obligation for such blades.\n&gt; So, a matter of time and names, or how we use the words rather than\n&gt; styles and length, in my opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Messaggio originale-----\n&gt; andrea Smith wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Re: Another sword question\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the difference is that the kodachi is a bit longer than a\n&gt; wakizashi, correct me if I&#39;m wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mmupton1@... wrote:What&#39;s the difference between a Kodachi and a\n&gt; Wakasashi?\n&gt; -mattyboi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
