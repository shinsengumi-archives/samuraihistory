The characters are usually based on historical figures but \nI&#39;ve checked around and i can&#39;t find out ANYTHING about Inahime, did \nshe even actually exist? Or was she made up for the game?\n\nOn the Koei official website they give a little bio about her but I \ndon&#39;t know if thats real. On the Koei website, they mention that \nInahime actually took part in a real battle using her bow and that \nthrew me off because it wasn&#39;t a common occurence for women to take \nto the battlefield in that era, right? \n\nSo I just guessed that Koei made her up, or is she actually based on \na real life figure? Even if they did make her up, she&#39;s still the \nbest! \n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated! Thanx again!\n\nP.S. Here&#39;s what the bio Koei made of her:\n\n&quot;The daughter of Tadakatsu Honda. She was adopted by Ieyasu \nTokugawa, and married Nobuyuki Sanada (Yukimura Sanada&#39;s\nbrother). \nIna was well liked by Ieyasu Tokugawa, and she often switched \nallegiances between the Tokugawas and the Sanadas. On the eve of the \nBattle of Sekigahara, the Sanada clan was divided between Eastern \nand Western fronts. While Nobuyuki (who was allied with the \nTokugawas) was away, Masayuki and Yukimura Sanada visited Numata \nCastle. Without opening the gates, she shot at them with her bow \nfrom a turret and repelled their attempted entry. However, at the \nwar&#39;s conclusion, she asked Tadakatsu and Ieyasu to have mercy on \nboth Masayuki and Yukimura.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
