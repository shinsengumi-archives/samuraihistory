I am in the\npreparation =\r\nstages for the rules, regs, and parameters for the third\nannual Samurai Fic=\r\ntion contest.\n\nHere is some information:\n\nThis time around I will expand th=\r\ne number of genres available, however\nthis time I will make them more stric=\r\nt. Previously, the &quot;Historical\nFiction&quot; section was the only genre with any=\r\n real &quot;rules&quot; for how it\nwas to be done. This time around, to make it fair,=\r\n I will add one or\ntwo requirements per genre.\n\nAlso, this time the entry f=\r\nee will be on a sliding time scale - that\nnot might be a &quot;real&quot; English phr=\r\nase, so let me explain:\n\nIf you sign up for the contest between now and Sep=\r\ntember 15th, 2006,\nthe fee will be $7.\n\nIf you sign up for the contest betw=\r\neen September 16th and December\n31st, 2006 the fee will be $10.\n\nIf you sig=\r\nn up for the contest between January 1st and the deadline of\nMarch 31st, 20=\r\n07 the fee will be $15.\n\nSo, hopefuly it will encourage the procrastinators=\r\n to sign up and\nstart writing early. As before, the winner of the contest w=\r\nill win the\nentire pot minus 5% to cover paypal fees, and this year, if we =\r\ncan get\nover 10 entries, I will throw in some of my own money for the winne=\r\nr\n(depending if there is a strike where I work or not - so as soon as I\ndec=\r\nide how much, I&#39;ll let you know.) I am still debating how much, but\nit may =\r\nbe substantial - so if you are interested, or if you know\nsomeone who would=\r\n be interested, let people know - the more entries,\nthe higher the prize.\n\n=\r\nIf you want to join, PayPal the registration fee (currently $7) to\nwebmaste=\r\nr@... - as always, please list with your\npaypal payment al=\r\nong with your name as many as applicable: Your Yahoo\nID, your Delphi Forums=\r\n ID (even if that forum is no longer really in\nuse) and your Samurai Archiv=\r\nes Citadel ID. This is so that I can keep\neasy track of who has entered.\n\nT=\r\nhe entry fee is non-refundable unless there is no contest. But there\nwill b=\r\ne a contest.\n\nIf anyone knows they will not enter, but wants to judge, let =\r\nme know.\nIf you sign up as judge now, but eventually decide to enter, that&#39;=\r\ns\nfine, too. You&#39;ll be removed from the judges circle to enter into the\ncon=\r\ntest. Like always, I won&#39;t be judging, since I will be the one\nreceiving th=\r\ne stories. I will just moderate the proceedings.\n\nFeel free to ask any ques=\r\ntions.\n\nI will keep updating as things progress.\n\n\n\n\n"
