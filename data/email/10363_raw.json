Contrary to popular belief=\r\n, and often overlooked by historians, guns did in fact make their way into =\r\nJapan as early as the 1450&#39;s, mainly through Ryukyu or to mainland Japan vi=\r\na China and Korea. Although they remained more of an oddity or curio until =\r\nthey were mass produced beginning in the 1540&#39;s, there are accounts of them=\r\n in Japan long before the introduction by Western traders, which we present=\r\n to you in this episode. And, for anyone who has ever wondered what the dif=\r\nference is between a musket, matchlock, and arquebus, we&#39;ll give you a conc=\r\nise explanation of the types of firearms in question.&quot;\n\nSo, rather than rei=\r\nnvent the wheel here, I&#39;d recommend a listen to the above podcast, and then=\r\n follow up with questions and we&#39;ll do our best to answer them. But in a nu=\r\ntshell, yes, guns did arrive in Japan before the 16th century from China/Ko=\r\nrea - just not in sufficient numbers to build an arsenal, or they were thou=\r\nght of as &quot;curiosities&quot; and not produced in Japan.\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Dennis Sheridan &lt;ldsheridan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The Chinese d=\r\niscovered gunpowder in the 9th century.  Do I understand\n&gt; correctly that t=\r\nhe Japanese did not acquire this technology until the mid\n&gt; 16th century wi=\r\nth Portuguese guns? (The route would be from China to Arabia\n&gt; to Europe an=\r\nd from there all the way back to Japan..  This is not at all\n&gt; intuitive.) =\r\n Similarly, the Chinese had movable type and a crude printing\n&gt; press (via =\r\nIndia) by the mid 11th c., the Koreans the same 3 centuries later\n&gt; and app=\r\narently the Japanese even later than that.  Given the geographical\n&gt; juxtap=\r\nosition, the treaties, diplomatic missions, the trade, and countless\n&gt; othe=\r\nr factors, I am completely mystified that a technological advance by one\n&gt; =\r\ncountry would not be almost immediately adopted by the other two.  I demand=\r\n\n&gt; an explanation.  (But if that is impolite I meekly beg one.)\n&gt; \n&gt; -d\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Ride wanted, off planet.
