Especially so since you argue with some people who have spent\ntheir lives studying things Japanese. I would suggest some\nhistory, rather than those with a martial arts focus.\n\nYour skin might want to get less sensitive as well; you&#39;re quite twitchy and\nreactive. I wouldn&#39;t trust you around me with neither\nbokken nor blade.  Do calm down, sir. You have nothing to prove, and by\nprofessing to know much, you prevent yourself from further\nlearning.\n\nGood day,\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: luke berryman\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, December 02, 2004 6:41 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] new subject\n\n\n\nYes I do know that Karate began before this.
