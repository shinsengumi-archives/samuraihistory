I have a 2 volume copy of a book\n &gt; published in 1910 by James Seguin de Benneville on Saito Musashi Bo\n &gt; Benkei. Anyone read it? Know anything about it&#39;s historical\nauthenticity? \n &gt; Thanks, Steve\n \nFrom what I understand Benkei&#39;s entire character is considered a legend.\nI&#39;d have to look back through the introduction to McCullough&#39;s\ntranslation of the Yoshitsune legend but I&#39;m fairly certain this is the\ncase. I remember reading once that Yoshitsune did have a monk companion\nso this is probably where the legend grew from, as most of the people\n(real or not) in Yoshitsune&#39;s party had their characters fleshed out by\nlater stories.\n \n--AngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
