He was original=\r\nly born into the Takigawa clan but later was adopted by Maeda Toshihisa (Ma=\r\neda Toshiie&#39;s brother) when Toshihisa married Keijiro&#39;s mother. He was drum=\r\nmed out of the Maeda clan when Toshiie took over leadership from Toshihisa.=\r\n He resurfaced about the time of the battle of Sekigahara, fighting for the=\r\n Uesugi clan against the northeastern allies of the Eastern army (primarily=\r\n the Date, Mogami, etc) under his new name of Hyottosai Kokuzoin. He was of=\r\n course on the losing side and ended up becoming a ronin again, living out =\r\nhis final years in a small one room cottage. His travel journal, armor, and=\r\n spear are on display at one of the Uesugi castle museums-I&#39;m pretty sure i=\r\nt&#39;s Kasugayama-jo.\nDespite having a rather bland career, he has found fame =\r\nthrough kabuki performances, a popular early 90&#39;s manga series, and Koei vi=\r\ndeo games.\nAs to your other question, invasion of Aizu by who? Lots of figh=\r\nting went on there over several centuries.\n\n\n\n\n"
