It is in fact pretty much the orthodox \n  way to interpret Nobunaga&#39;s role. He was the one who broke down the \n  old barriers. At the same time he put together enough of the pieces \n  and had built up enough momentum in the unification effort to allow \n  someone else to succeed should he fail.\n\n  At the same time I&#39;ve always enjoyed wondering if Nobunaga himself \n  could have carried it off. At times I&#39;m not so sure if he had the \n  administrative and political skills to consolidate his gains. I&#39;m \n  left to believe that each of the three men - Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, \n  Ieyasu - each played the role in the &quot;unification&quot; process that they \n  were perfectly suited to.\n\n  --\n  Jay Kelly\n  oyakata@...\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
