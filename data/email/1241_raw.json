Last time I was at the local Borders they had \n_Taiko_ and not _Musashi_.  I loved _Musashi_, but had a hard time getting into \n_Taiko_.  I&#39;ve read about half of it twice.  I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s the \ntranslation or what.  \nAnyway, how the Samurai affected society is not like asking &quot;how did the \ndiscovery o gold in California affect society in the US.&quot; (weird example I know)  \nThe Samurai were not an external force shaping society, they were part of the \nsociety.  You really need to ask more specific questions. \n\nRaphael in Ten\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
