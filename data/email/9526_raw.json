People have got to remember that these films are for entertainm=\r\nent purposes only.  I for one can not stand Tom Cruse and it took every oun=\r\nce of concentration to ignore his part in the film because I was only inter=\r\nested in the Martial Arts techniques.  If one wants to know the true story =\r\nof that period, pick up a book (sometimes you can&#39;t really rely on the inte=\r\nrnet for research).  As a Civil War reenactor, I picked out several of flaw=\r\ns but that didn&#39;t stop me from learning a thing or two about sword techinqu=\r\nes.  By the way, I waited till that flick came out on AMC.  I refuse to was=\r\nte any of my hard earned money on a Tom Cruse movie ~_^\n   \n  Phil in Norfo=\r\nlk Virginia\n\nkeecurlee &lt;threekeys@...&gt; wrote:\n          Guys,Guys,Guys=\r\n, These peopls are Actors...
