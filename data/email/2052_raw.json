But eventually he rose through the ranks to become \nKampaku, the highest rank Hideyoshi could receive since he didn&#39;t \ndescended from any imperial families, like all previous Shoguns. But \nhe was pretty much the &quot;Shogun&quot;. \n\nLater on, Hideyoshi slammed the door shut on social mobility, \nabolishing the concept of the ji-zamurai, or &#39;samurai of the land&#39; \nwho tilled the soil when not at war. Even lowly ashigaru were made \nsamurai, albeit low-ranking ones, and were forbidden to do village \nwork and were eventually ordered to live in the castle town of their \nlords. The status edict guaranteed that there would not be another \nToyotomi Hideyoshi. \n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; \n&lt;the_sam_99@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I think there were former peasants that turned into samurai, \nToyotomi \n&gt; (or one of the big guys of the late 16th century) was one. It was \n&gt; hard, but it could be done if you were adopted into a samurai \nfamily, \n&gt; but after Tokugawa took power he forbade the class jumps.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Wolf of Mibu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, James Eckman &lt;FUGU@p...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J.
