How \n&gt;would a brave Samurai, endowed with the armour of tradition and hitherto \n&gt;unchallenged upper-class prerrogatives, would have taken his own defeat by \n&gt;a single blow dealt maybe by the lowest peasant, holding the unorthodox \n&gt;weapon (again, maybe riflemen were not members of the lower classes, but \n&gt;you can correct me on that - if so, how would he take defeat in face of a \n&gt;perhaps less trainned person).\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;Thiago\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Luis-Gabriel Leal\n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, June 02, 2004 2:17 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Nobunaga as a villain\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Well that explains alot then. It just seems so odd that someone who\n&gt;   had been successful in his endeavors for a united kingdom would be\n&gt;   portrayed as a half demon king with a flaming purple sword and\n&gt;   speaking in a voice that makes James Earl Jones seem like pee-wee\n&gt;   herman.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Gabriel\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   ---\n&gt;   Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;   Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;   ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yahoo!
