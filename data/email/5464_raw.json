When this joyously culminates with a bizarre \nclimactic tap-dancing routine, you know things have gone where no \nsamurai has dared go before. If this doesn&#39;t completely throw you out \nof the film, you&#39;ll be absolutely delighted.\n\nThe story, which is loosely based on the first Zatoichi movie, \nfollows the traditional-enough lines of our hero entering a town \ncaught up in a gang war. There&#39;s also a masterless ronin, Gennosuke \nHattori (the imposing Tadanobu Asano), whom we know Zatoichi will \neventually face down.\n\nBut that&#39;s as standard as matters are allowed to get. Two geisha with \nmurder on their minds (and one big secret between them), a crusty old \nwoman and her wastrel nephew whose sexuality comes into sudden \nquestion are just some of the oddballs Zatoichi has to cope with.\n\nAs he&#39;s done in some of his gangster movies (Sonatine) and \nsentimental kid comedies (Kikujiro), Takeshi juggles and juxtaposes \ncomedy with violence and burlesque with social commentary. But he&#39;s \nnever before mixed so many disparate elements as boldly, nor as \nsuccessfully, as he does in Zatoichi. It&#39;s a mad masterpiece.\n\n\n\n\n"
