It&#39;s eventually \n  up to the moderator to decide what is an ok OT or not, I believe. I \n  started this post talking about the Japanese in WWII, and it seems to \n  me pertinent with the main theme of the list. The discussion got a bit \n  out of hand, but if so many people posted about war movies, it probably \n  means quite a few of the members of this list are into such topic, \n  don&#39;t you think??\n  Cepo\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
