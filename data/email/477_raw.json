If he won 60 duels by the age of 28 and the \nfirst by the age of 13. Then I&#39;m hoping that someone knows more about him \nand his incredible life. I know he wrote\n&quot;Gorin No Sho&quot; but can you get it in the original text rather than english \ncopies which miss out much information.\n\nMany thanks,\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\n\n\n\n"
