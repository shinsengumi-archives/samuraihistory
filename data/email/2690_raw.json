Let&#39;s put it this way,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Some Samurai followed Bushido, but Bushido was not\n&gt; followed by all \n&gt; Samurai.  You follow Bushido.  That does not make\n&gt; you a Samurai.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ll even ignore the fact that &#39;Samurai&#39; was a\n&gt; social class, and \n&gt; not a product of Bushido, but Bushido was a product\n&gt; of a few Samurai \n&gt; with nothing better to do than justify their\n&gt; lecherous existence \n&gt; during the Edo period, and then gathered a following\n&gt; because it made \n&gt; them look honorable and useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m surprised that you think this way if you&#39;ve been\n&gt; to Japan, as \n&gt; you should know that any remnants of bushido are\n&gt; long, long gone in \n&gt; that society, and I Gaijin attempting to play\n&gt; Samurai would be \n&gt; thought a moron at best.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ....a great lot about samurai, weapons, and\n&gt; ancient japan. I \n&gt; myself, \n&gt; &gt; follow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real\n&gt; life Samurai, \n&gt; though \n&gt; &gt; Samurai&#39;s have been outlawed since the late\n&gt; 1800&#39;s, I still \n&gt; consider \n&gt; &gt; myself one.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
