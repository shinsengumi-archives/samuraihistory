There has been some discussion in the\npast on the this forum regarding shinobi (ninja)\nincluding comments by myself.\n\nI would like to stress that this documentary is not a\nchessy wannabe ninja film, it is a serious project. I\nhave the rough cut and I like what i have seen. Even\nthough I am a senior ranked member of the bujinkan\nwhich was famous in the 80&#39;s for its publication of\nninjutsu I am highly critical of ninjutsu wannabes.\nEven to the point where I do not mention ninjutsu to\nmy students and it is never discussed, I even\nadvertise my dojo as Jujutsu to keep away form the\nninja element of my Org.\n\nI spoke with Brandon last night on the phone, the dvd\nshould be available at the end of may.\n\nJust in case everyone quickly jumps in and starts\nshouting ninja in black suit and masks then wait, the\nfilm discusses the origin of that image and even\nstates it is not correct and that it was only used in\ntheatre for the pubic image, Brandon visited several\nsites in Japan associated with ninjutsu, even visiting\nthe home of the famous 16th century Ninja Momochi\nSandayu and meeting with the current 19th generation\nhead of that family (the fmaily no longer practises\nninjutsu lol). There he was shown items that once\nbelonged to Momochi.\n\nBrandon is going to approach the tv networks to try\nand get it aired for all to see eventually. But he\nwould prefer it if you bought it (of course)\n\nBrandon is a serious martial artist as well, and\ntogether we have discussed future projects. One of\nthese will be hopefully started this year, with the\naid of several of my friends who have lived in Japan\nfor several years and study Koryu. The first 3\nprojects we are looking at are \n\n1. Famous Samurai swordsmen there schools and items\nbelonging or rewlating tot hem\n2. Various Koryu - sort of a intro to each school and\nwhat they do and who they are - 6 old schools have\nbeen contacted and 5 have already said yes.\n3. production of a kata from start to finish including\nthe making of the koshirae and polishing. (We have\naccess to one of the most senior polishers in Japan)\n\nIf all goes well we are hoping to then do one on\narmour production. \n\nIf these projects do get off the ground I will be\nasking members of this list whom I have noticed are\ninvolved in various subjects relating to what we are\ncurrently working on for help or advise.\n\nAs for the shinobi documentary please reserve\njudgement until you have seen it. Brandon has worked\nfor 3 years to produce something that is not like the\nrest of the crap we have seen before.\n\nsamples of the film are available to be viewed at\nBrandons web page - www.shinobiwinds.com - (I say\nsamples they are still editing the film)\n\nPaul\nPS Hi Helly - thanks for mentioning Hanako for me\n\n--- ahelly69 &lt;ahelly69@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nHello all!\n\nI received today a great notice from &quot;Hanako&quot;\nnewsletter about a new \ndocumentary about the Shinobi (Ninja).\n\nThis proyect was made by Mr. Brandon Alvarez and is\nbased in a deep \nresearch and interviews with real ninja masters like\nDr. Masaaki \nHatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Bud Malmstrom, Isamu\nShiraishi between \nothers.\n\nI think will be a great and interesting material about\none of the \nmost intriguing and misterious Arts from the feudal\nJapan.\n\nThe website to inquire about the film is \nwww.shinobiwinds.com\nand the website to require the Hanako Newsletter one\nof the most \ncomprensive and complete material about the Shinobi\ntoday is:\nwww.hanako.co.uk\n\nAll the best to all,\n\nHelly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
