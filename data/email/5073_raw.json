(There I said it, I apologize for\n&gt; opening the can of worms, the gorefest begins with me I guess). When\n&gt; one suddenly separates a human head from a human body there is a great\n&gt; deal of blood pressure to be released, if you cut the head off\n&gt; completely it is likely to fly across the room, spattered in blood and\n&gt; roll to the foot of the witnesses. Hardly what I would report to my\n&gt; superiors as a &quot;tidy&quot; end.\n\nThe only time something like that would happen is in a Kurosawa movie (ref.\nKaede&#39;s death in &quot;Ran&quot;). There is not THAT much pressure in blood. I&#39;ve seen\nvideo of people being beheaded with a sword blow. The head doesn&#39;t &quot;fly&quot; -- it\ndrops.\n\nAnd, frankly, I&#39;ve never seen that &quot;sliver of flesh&quot; chestnut anywhere but in\nEnglish sources -- usually citing someone&#39;s sensei. And as evidenced by someone\nelse whose sensei seems to think that &quot;hara-kiri&quot; and &quot;seppuku&quot; are different\nthings, citing a sensei for a non-martial arts technique point of history or\nlinguistics or culture is very dubious.\n\nPersonally, I think that whole &quot;sliver of flesh&quot; thing is pure BS -- like a lot\nof the bushido myth and mysticism quoted or followed by westerners into Japanese\nmartial history, it&#39;s another small item of minutiae about how picky, precise,\nand disciplined samurai were -- and total hogwash.\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
