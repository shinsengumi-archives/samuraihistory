I think they were given to someone by one \n&gt; of the Kami or gods/goddesses, but I can&#39;t quite remember the specifics. \n&gt; Go ahead and e-mail me if you need any more specifics on the subject. I \n&gt; spent a past life during some of feudal japan, and was alive during \n&gt; Sekigahara.\n&gt;\n&gt; American Oni ^_^\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Jeff,\n&gt; there were many different laws in many different places, it would depend \n&gt; on the time period as well as the diamyo. Although not laws if I had to \n&gt; choose two things that were expected of a samurai in all places and times \n&gt; it would be, obedience and loyalty these things were core to what a \n&gt; samurai should be, the word samurai even means &quot;to serve&quot;.\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S. Even though a ronin had no lord to serve and be loyal and obiedient \n&gt; to this did not make him any less of a samurai.\n&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;  From: jeff\n&gt;  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Sent: Friday, October 01, 2004 7:37 PM\n&gt;  Subject: [samuraihistory] laws of samurai\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  hello im doing a project i need to know two laws of a samurai could\n&gt;  anyone help\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  ---\n&gt;  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;  --- \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;        Yahoo!
