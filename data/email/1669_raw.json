It most definitely is NOT a rifle, which has a gentle\nspiral of grooves in the bore of the barrel to add spin to a streamlined,\ncylindrical bullet rather than a ball.  This spin stabilises the bullet in\nflight and greatly improves accuracy to longer ranges.  A smooth bore musket is\nnot a very accurate weapon and was used in volleys rather than individual aimed\nfire - hence the famed British Red Square with their Brown Bess muskets before\nthe introduction of the Baker Rifle...\n\nI&#39;m also sorry if this seems pedantic to some, but accuracy in technical terms\nis always important as an aid to understanding the weapon, the times and the men\nwho used them.\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n"
