Mori Motonari won an impressive \nvictory over them, one of his ea=\r\nrliest victories.  They seem to have \nfallen off the map after that:\n\n&quot;Moto=\r\nnari was born Shojumaru, the second son of M=F4ri Hiromoto, a \ndaimyo who s=\r\ntruggled against the local Takeda clan (not to be \nconfused with the Kai br=\r\nanch of that family) and the encroaching \nO=FBchi. In 1499, Hiromoto found =\r\nhimself in the path of a looming \nAmako invasion from Izumo, and allied wit=\r\nh O=FBchi. At the time, O=FBchi \nYoshioki was becoming involved in the gunb=\r\noat politics of Kyoto and \nwhile he was away, the Amako grew stronger. In 1=\r\n506 Hiromoto died, \nand was succeded by his eldest son, Okimoto, who ended =\r\nup assisting \nYoshioki in Kyoto for a short period. It happened that he die=\r\nd in \n1516, and Motonari was named to act as guardian to the late lord&#39;s \ny=\r\noung son, Komatsumaru. Komatsumaru in turn was to die in 1523, after \nwhich=\r\n Motonari became the official head of he clan. Evidently, \nM=F4ri&#39;s predece=\r\nssors had died under unclear circumstances, for there \nis a legend that it =\r\nwas Motonari himself who dispatched them. At any \nrate, Motonari did not in=\r\nherit a particularly enviable position. The \nmost powerful daimyo in Aki, T=\r\nakeda Motoshige, took advantage of \nOkimoto&#39;s death to make a play for M=F4=\r\nri land, and in Izumo the Amako \nbegan to rattle their sabers. Luckily for =\r\nthe M=F4ri, however, their \nyoung lord quickly proved himself a man of acti=\r\non. Takeda had set out \nto take Koriyama Castle (the M=F4ri&#39;s chief bastion=\r\n since the early \n14th Century) but found his troops intercepted and routed=\r\n by the \nnumerically inferior M=F4ri clan. This victory carried a certain \n=\r\nprestige value for Motonari, but was quickly over-shadowed by greater \neven=\r\nts.&quot;\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re playing too much Shogun: Total War. \n&gt; \n&gt; The Taked=\r\na were a Shugo family under the Ashikaga\n&gt; Shogunate.
