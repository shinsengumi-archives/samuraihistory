In the closing years of the Heian period (794-\n1185) it evolved into an expression of the morality and spirit of \nthe classical warrior. At this time Bushido was known by the term \nKyuba-No-Michi or way of the horse and bow. In the Kokon Chomonshu \n(a study concerning the Heian period) there are mentioned &quot;seven \nCardinal Virtues&quot; of the very simple kind of moral consciousness \ndeveloped among those fighting men of ancient times. Briefly stated, \nthe seven virtues urged the warrior to shun violence, to keep his \nsword sheathed, and to live in peace and amity with his fellow men. \nLater during the Kamakura period (1185-1333) Yoritomo&#39;s Bakufu (the \nfirst military government) demanded that Loyalty be the supreme \nvirtue especially to Yoritomo the shogun himself. During the \nfollowing century the country was constant turmoil from the civil \nwars. The warrior&#39;s knights whose duty it was to fight, must have \nfelt keenly the uncertainty of life. For such an attitude is clearly \nreflected in the way in which he regards the ethics of his \nprivileged class, which were now permeated by a Zen flavour. This \ngave a trust in fate, a quite submission to the inevitable, that \nnonchalant composure in sight of danger or calamity, that distain \nfor life and friendliness with death. \n\nIn the 1603 the Tokugawa Bakufu appeared, it heralded a period of \nprolonged peace spanning practically to the 20th century Bushido \nneeded to evolve at this time to fit in this new type of warrior \nknight who was no longer constantly engaged in warfare. Bushido \nacquired a complex, highly idealistic from and the major doctrines \nof the code were committed to writing during this period in many \nfamous works. \n \nThe main tents were: \n\nLOYALTY- absolute, both to ones lord and master and in the \nperformance of duty. \n\nRECTITUDE- In the word of a well-known Samurai &quot;rectitude is the \npower of deciding upon a certain course of conduct in accordance \nwith reason, without wavering; - to die when it&#39;s right to die, to \nstrike when to strike is right&quot;. \n\nCOURAGE- doing what is morally right with no thought of losing. \n\nBENEVOLENCE- mercy, respect, love understanding, tenderness, pity. \n\nPOLITENESS- not simply to show good taste, but a sympathetic regard \nfor the feelings of others, and respect to social positions. \n\nFILIAL PIETY- not only that absolute devotion to the parents but to \nthe family line. Others tents that feature strongly in the code are \nVeracity, Sincerity, Honesty, Propriety, Valour, Righteousness, \nHonour and Self-control.\n \n\nThe code of Bushido is represented in the seven folds of the Hakama \n(5 at the front and 2 at the rear) and their meanings are: \n\n1. YUKI Courage, Valour, Bravery. \n\n2. JIN Humanity, Charity, Benevolence.\n\n3. GI Justice, Righteousness, Integrity.\n\n4. REI Etiquette, Courtesy, Civility. \n\n5. MAKOTO Sincerity, Honesty, Reality. \n\n6. CHUDGI Loyalty, Fidelity, Devotion. \n\n7. MEIYO Honour, Credit, Glory, Reputation, Dignity. \n\n*note-info from a website\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; \n&lt;the_sam_99@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The Book of Five Rings either states the most important codes of \nthe \n&gt; Way or gives what Musashi thinks as the true codes a warrior \nshould \n&gt; follow, either way it&#39;s a good insight into what the codes are.\n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking of which, I have a doubt on whether the word &quot;bushido&quot; \nwas \n&gt; used prior to the 17th century or not, anyone here knows?\n&gt; \n&gt; The Wolf of Mibu\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dave Jackson \n&lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; There isnt an actual written code but it varys depending on the \n&gt; source as to what is in it, but its main points are loyalty to \n&gt; &gt; ones lord above everything else even ones own family.
