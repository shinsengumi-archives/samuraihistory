I often here them say how much they wish they could be American... and not jsut in the citizenship-sense.. which played a bit of a role in the original post.. but I made the original post after many ppl seemed to state that they thought that Mishima was &quot;whacko&quot;.. I just was merely trying to point out that there are two sides to every coin and hopefully start a discussion based on that thought... even tho it is a bit off topic(plz excuse me).. I hope I did not offend anyone.. Thanx for the replies..\n\nWilson..\n\nP.S.\nas for moving to Japan, my fiance is a missionary and has her heart set on Japan.. Ive studied 4 other languages already.. I need them to get thru school b4 I can confuse myself w/ a 5th..  :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, golfmandan@a... wrote:\n&gt; Christopher, Mr. Wilson didn&#39;t write what you&#39;re responding to.
