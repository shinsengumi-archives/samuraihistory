Huh? You are reading WAY too much\ninto this. If I were a renowned professor or\nsomething, then maybe I could afford to be pompous or\nelitist. I&#39;m not, and I&#39;m neither. Sorry to hear you\nare offended by my lighthearted attempt at levity. It\nwas a JOKE. I didn&#39;t attack the poor boy. \n\n&gt; I admit that the &quot;story&quot; was funny, and I would have\n&gt; laughed heartily under\n&gt; different circumstances. Unfortunately, the whole\n&gt; &quot;trying to make fun of the\n&gt; ignorant without them realizing they&#39;re being\n&gt; fooled&quot; bent really gets me in\n&gt; a bad mood. It&#39;s tasteless. Sorry, but it is. \n\nThere was no intent to make fun of someone without\nthem knowing--I thought it was fairly obvious that I\nwas making fun of the QUESTION, not them, personally.\nIf people want to take things personally, so be\nit--they are perfectly free to ignore, get upset,\nwhatever my intent is. \n\nbut it&#39;s more productive to either\n&gt; answer the question as best\n&gt; you can, or just ignore it altogether.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I had the knowledge, I&#39;d be spending more time\n&gt; trying to educate those\n&gt; who seem willing and capable of understanding what\n&gt; really happened in\n&gt; history (as far as we know, anyway). Anyone who\n&gt; isn&#39;t willing or able, I&#39;d\n&gt; simply tune out.\n\nIf we can&#39;t have a little tongue in cheek fun, the\nthat is what is truly sad. However, in response to the\nprotest, I&#39;ll try to &quot;tone it down&quot;. Begin the &quot;no\nsmiling&quot; zone...\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\nhttp://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/\n\n"
