The \nassassin part, though, is more hollywood than anything.  They were more into \nespionage and were information gatherers rather than assassins, although they \nwere more than likely used for that purpose if needed.  (Reference: Fuma Kotaro \n-- b. Kazama Kotaro -- led a ninja band for the Hojo clan in the Sengoku \nperiod.  The band, if memory serves, were involved in a war, but not necessarily as \nspies as much as guerillas.  Again if memory serves, he was executed in 1603 \nas a common criminal.)  Hope this helps!  8-)\n\nLater\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
