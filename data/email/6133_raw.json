I wandered through the history \nsection of the lovely and art endowed Los Angeles County Central \nLibrary (http://www.lapl.org/central/art_architecture.html) which \nwas organized by country/region, and/or individual, and went from \nthe tumultous Koreans right into Japan.  One moment, it&#39;s all this \nnorth-south damn-those-chinese-and-americans kind of talk, the next, \nthere&#39;s twigs and blossoms and peace.  Well, that&#39;s how it started, \nbut it soon grew ugly as the section broadened into warfare.  \nWarfare, art, warfare, art... I understand you can study both, but \nit seemed a curious mixture to have them interspaced.  There was a \ntheme here, but I couldn&#39;t quite lay my finger on it. (Of course, \ngoing back a bit in the Korea section revealed that they, too, \nshared no love of the Japanese, probably due to the twice a millenia \ninvasions by those folks.  What is so wonderful about Korea that the \nJapanese kept invading it?)\n\nSo I snagged Mr. Turnbull&#39;s Osprey book and &quot;Samurai, A Military \nHistory,&quot; also by that same worthy, and found that the Osprey book \nwas meaty reading for such a thin tome.  I suspect, from Turnbull&#39;s \nmany offerings, that he is an excellent gent to start with, and then \nto branch out when my abundant free time is no longer taken up by \nthese books.  Suggestions, anyone?  (Or, if there&#39;s a reading list \ncompiled by some person, kindly direct me to it?)  \n\nAfter picking up those volumes, I wandered some more, and mused on \nthe fact that someone, somewhere, for some reason completely unknown \nto me, thinks it important that we preserve the 1964 yellow pages \nfor Des Moines, Iowa.  Else, why have it available for checkout, in \na library created ugly brown cover, with black lettering?  If only \nAndrew could see his progeny now, and think, &quot;for this, I ruthlessly \ncrushed all other steel companies?&quot;  Ah, but the rest of the place! \nIt was enough to humble your kind author.  I know so very little \nabout anything.  Soon, I will know a very little about this subject, \ntoo.  :)\n\nCheers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
