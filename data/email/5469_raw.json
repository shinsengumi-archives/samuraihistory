It took Nobunaga 10 years of fighting, had Imagawa \nYoshimoto plowed over Nobunaga and went to Kyoto, would he have had a \nchance against them? Most likely, he would have had to give up some \ncontrol or authority to please them, I dont see him being able to \ndefeat them the way Nobunaga did, and I dont see them idly sitting by \nas Yoshimoto cuts into thier power and profits.  Maybe Japan would \nhave ended up as a semi-theocracy?\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\n"
