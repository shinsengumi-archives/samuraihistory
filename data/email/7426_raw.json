I have several \ntimes visited a temple where, presumably, the 47 Samurai are buried. I \njust today watched on the history channel a feature on Samurai, and \nthey showed a videeo tape of the temple. The one I visited is just \naround the cornert from the Takanawa Prince hotel. Yet, I have read \nthat the temple is in an entirely different location. I hope someone \ncan straighten us out.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s not uncommon for Japanese to have two (or more) gravesites. Even \nWill Adams, the English ship captain that James Clavell based Shogun \nupon, has at least two gravesites. My wife&#39;s birthmother&#39;s ashes are \nburied in her family &#39;plot&#39; and also in her husband&#39;s &#39;plot&#39;. Since \ncremation was quite common, ashes could easily be buried in several \nlocations. If someone died far from home, the body would usually be \nburied or cremated where it was and sometimes only a lock of hair or \nkeepsake would make it back to their family. This would usually be \ncremated/buried as well. More than a few &#39;gravesites&#39; are purely \nsymbolic as well, particularly if they are on the grounds of a shrine.\n\n\n\n"
