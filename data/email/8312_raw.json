If some random American director closely followed the style\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;and \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;plots of  Mizoguchi or Ozu even if he made the settings American he \n&gt;&gt;would probably be known as a &#39;Japanese&#39; director. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I SERIOUSLY doubt that. No American director has ever been thought of\n&gt;as anything other than a director, at best &quot;inspired by&quot; or\n&gt;&quot;influenced by&quot; someone else. Probably Holywood pride - they think\n&gt;they are the center of the world, why relegate someone to being a\n&gt;&#39;japanese&#39; director?  The phrase doesn&#39;t even make any sense anyway.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure that relegate is the right word. Mizoguchi and Ozu were \ngreat directors in their own right and if I had to use jidai-geki films \nto get a feel for historical Japan, I think these directors do a much \nbetter job than Kurosawa getting the social feel right. Along those \nlines, something like Twilight Samurai is probably a bit better as well. \nAs for the phrase Japanese director, I would give it two meanings, the \nobvious one and the one that means a director that copies Japanese film \nstyle and plot to the extent that their movies seem more like Japanese \nfilms that would normally only be made in Japan. I doubt they would play \nwell in America since the only great imported hits from Japan seem to be \nthe violent ones, anime excepted.\n\nIf I could make films as well as Ozu or others, I would take pride in it \neven if they were copies, but I&#39;m not Hollywood.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
