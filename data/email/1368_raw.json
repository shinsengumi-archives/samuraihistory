The Dai-ei era \nlasted from\n1521-1528 and is sometimes read as Tai-ei and is written with the \ncharacters ??.  \n\nMy index of Japanese swordsmiths shows two of the name of Sukesada \nworking in\nBizen (aka Bishu) in this time frame.   A blade by either of these two \nsmiths in\ngood condition would probably be valuable, but if by the second and \nlater smith,\ncould be quite valuable and possibly qualify for designation as an \nimportant cultural\nobject.   You should get the blade examined by a knowledgeable appraiser as\nsoon as possible.\n\nHerb Lison\n\ndginn1959 wrote:\n\n&gt; I own a Japanese sword and believe it is an old police sword. I have\n&gt; the inscription on the blade which says : &quot;Bishu Osafune Sukesada\n&gt; Saku&quot;  &quot; Daiei 2 Nen 2 Gatsu &quot; Can anyone help me with the english\n&gt; translation of this inscription?
