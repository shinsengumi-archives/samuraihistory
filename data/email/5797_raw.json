Not\nsure at the\nmoment if I want a shinken or iaito as I want to\npractice kata.  Does\nanyone know about importing either of these items into\nthe UK and what\nproblems might arise with customs and/or police?\n\nCheers\n\nIan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
