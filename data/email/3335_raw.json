It seems to capture a strength that not many other statues \nof\n&gt; this type reveal.  I&#39;d like to see it myself but I don&#39;t know where\n&gt; it is at.  I&#39;m living in Tokyo, and I know it&#39;s somewhere around\n&gt; here.  Anyone know exactly where it is?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cepo was correct. Its in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The \narea is\n&gt; called &quot;Kogo Mae Hiroba&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t have any pics of it myself but there are some in Kodansha&#39;s \nSaigen\n&gt; Nihonshi # 78. You probably can find a copy in Maruzen or \nKinokuniya.\n\n\n\n"
