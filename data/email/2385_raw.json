This seems like an interesting story!!\n&gt; How many swords are there??\n&gt; I imagine the Japanese soldiers were trapped and\n&gt; preferred to hide the \n&gt; swords rather than have them taken away. they might\n&gt; have thought to go \n&gt; back get them later on, but looks like they never\n&gt; did... Sure we can \n&gt; find out more by reading the letters!!\n&gt; If you can send a scan, sure I can translate it for\n&gt; you. If there is an \n&gt; address, we can try to deliver it as well.\n&gt; Alternatively, you can send via ordinary mail\n&gt; (=post) a photocopy of \n&gt; the letter to me or anyone else in this mailing list\n&gt; willing to do the \n&gt; translation. I am actually pretty good at\n&gt; translating, plus my wife is \n&gt; Japanese and I can have it double-checked at the\n&gt; Japanese Studies \n&gt; department here at University of Hawaii.\n&gt; cepo\n\nOf course I will try to send the copy letter once it\narrived in sorong.\nTalking about the number of swords; In north sulawesi,\npeople there found 3 swords according to my friend. \nHe give me some metal bar where found along with the\nswords. I dont know whether this metal bar has\nconnection to the swords. \nI have checked that this metal is made from brass.\nI&#39;ll send the picture of the metal bar.\nThere is another 9 swords found in Fak-Fak (west\npapua), and they say that these sword on average has 2\nm length. \n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
