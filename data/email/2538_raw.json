I&#39;ve got no disrespect at all for someone else\nwho does it for fun. \n\nThe point of my post is that in studying Japanese\nhistory, you do not use the term &quot;renaissance&quot; to\ndescribe any particular period of JAPANESE history.\nThe &quot;Renaissance&quot; was a Western European phenomenon,\nby no means a world-wide event, and the use of it in\nconnection with Japanese history smacks of cultural\nbias. Japan didn&#39;t HAVE a &quot;Renaissance&quot;, at least not\nin the same sense Europe did, so you can hopefully see\nmy confusion as to the use of the word. \n\nWhen you mentioned you used it because it&#39;s a term\nused to describe that period in your wargaming, I\ndismissed the question. I certainly didn&#39;t mean to\ndismiss you--you answered my question for me. You were\nusing the term in a familiar application to you--and\nnow I understand that. If you had argued that it was a\nvalid HISTORICAL period of Japan, I would have still\nbeen confused--would you mean the Azuchi-Momoyama\nperiod, because there was a flourishing of the arts?\nor would you mean the early Tokugawa, because of the\nwatershed political changes? Very confusing. \n\nAgain, nothing meant against wargaming--I was thinking\nin terms of a historical definition of the word. You\nmerely were using it in a context unfamiliar to me,\nand I thank you for clearing it up. \n\nNate\n\n--- burker1@... wrote:\n&gt; Do I detect a hint of condescension?  The key to\n&gt; successful wargaming is a thorough knowledge and\n&gt; understanding of history.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 11/17/2003 4:08:11 AM Eastern\n&gt; Standard Time, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n&gt; writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Ah ha. Wargaming. Not history. Hence my confusion. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s generally not a term used to describe Japanese\n&gt; &gt;history. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Nate\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- burker1@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been a wargamer for over 30 years and we\n&gt; talk\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about &quot;Renaissance \n&gt; &gt;&gt; wargaming&quot; all the time. &#63728;It usually\nrefers to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; period when armies used artillery \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and firearms (handguns, arquebusses, and early\n&gt; &gt;&gt; muskets).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; In a message dated 11/16/03 6:04:50 PM,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cepo@... writes:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; I agree with Nate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In particular, the term Renaissance is normally\n&gt; used\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in a cultural \n&gt; &gt;&gt; context, so I do not understand the connection\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; warring...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; If we should select a historical period in\n&gt; medieval\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Japan we could \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;compare&quot; (oowwww, here we go again??) with the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Renaissance, it would \n&gt; &gt;&gt; probably be the very late\n&gt; Muromachi+Azuchi-Momoyama\n&gt; &gt;&gt; period of &quot;Gold and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Red,&quot; coming after the austere, heavily Zen\n&gt; &gt;&gt; influenced arts of the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kamakura/Muromachi periods. Nobunaga and\n&gt; Hideyoshi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; castles were perfect \n&gt; &gt;&gt; example of the artistic abundance and\n&gt; extravagance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the period.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Bye,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cepo, Honolulu.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; PS=I have a couple of very nice shots of\n&gt; Hideyoshi&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; castle in Momoyama \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (Fushimi), is there any way I can share them with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you? It will be \n&gt; &gt;&gt; finally re-opened to the public in 2005. &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;__________________________________\n&gt; &gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt;Protect your identity with Yahoo!
