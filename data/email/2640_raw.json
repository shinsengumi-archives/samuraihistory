It is a lot easier to say what it is not rather than what it is.... There are a few native birds represented in various mon - Crane, Sparrow, Wild Goose, Crow, Mandarin Duck, Dove, Hawk and the domestic Chicken (I suppose we should also add the Pheonix!) - non of these are similar to the ones represented in the &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; crest. The best description of which I would say Swan or Goose.  Having said all this I know I have in my collection a crest design of a bird in flight similar in nature to the birds in your crest... I believe it came from a modern japanese design book but cannot as yet remember!!\n\nBest wishes with the investigations...        \n\n                                            Rod Johnson\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: megatjockis \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2003 12:38 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Hagakure crest\n\n\n\n  Hello!\n\n  I was hoping someone might be able to help me. I would like to know \n  to which family the crest used in the movie ghost dog and on some \n  editions of the hagakure belongs. The crest, made up of three birds, \n  can be seen here for example:\n\n  http://www.diamondcomics.com/news/2000/03_27_00/ghost_dog.htm\n\n  Best regards!\n\n  Gustav\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
