Twice durin=\r\ng the 13th century he sent massive fleets to \ninvade Japan, possibly trying=\r\n to seize its storied gold. Each time, \nthough, the khan&#39;s aggression was r=\r\nepelled not by the Japanese \nmilitary but by sudden storms that killed most=\r\n of the invaders and \ndestroyed their ships. The Japanese dubbed these stor=\r\nms kamikaze, or \ndivine wind.\n\nThat&#39;s the myth, but what exactly happened i=\r\nn the high seas more than \n700 years ago? Archeologists have been trying fo=\r\nr decades to nail \ndown the specifics. From which direction did the kamikaz=\r\ne blow? How \nstrong was it? For that matter, how big were the Mongolian shi=\r\nps? And \nhow did they manage to sink? Now, more than seven centuries after =\r\nthe \nfact, Japanese archeologists are finally getting some answers. \nArtifa=\r\ncts uncovered in an expedition that ended last week tell more \nabout the ba=\r\nttles that took place off the coast of the tiny island of \nTakashima at the=\r\n mouth of Imari Bay, 1,000 kilometers southwest of \nTokyo.\n\nDigging up the =\r\nsea bottom to salvage the pieces from the Mongols&#39; \ninvasions is a difficul=\r\nt task, to say the least. Excavations that \nstarted in the 1980s, now led b=\r\ny Kenzo Hayashida, archeologist and \npresident of the Kyushu and Okinawa So=\r\nciety for Underwater \nArchaeology, managed to uncover many ceramic jars use=\r\nd for \ncontainers. In recent years his team found Mongolian pottery-shelled=\r\n \nbombs, swords, large anchors and a bowl with Chinese characters that \nbel=\r\nonged to a 100-man unit under a commander named Wang. In July his \nteam of =\r\nscientists and divers worked on a site about 70 meters from \nthe shore and =\r\n13 meters below the surface of the sea. By pumping \nwater through a hose an=\r\nd suctioning up the sand, they found human-\nskull parts, animal bones, timb=\r\ners from the ships and an anchor rope.\n\nHayashida and his crew fell short o=\r\nf finding an intact ship. The \nreason: shipworms most likely have reduced t=\r\nhese once mighty vessels \nto shards. &quot;It is like having 4,000 different set=\r\ns of puzzles,&quot; says \nRandall Sasaki, a graduate student in the nautical-arc=\r\nheology program \nat Texas A&M University who was a member of Hayashida&#39;s te=\r\nam. &quot;Those \npieces were put in a blender of sea and were mixed together. It=\r\n is \ndifficult to figure out which piece goes to which ship.&quot; Judging by \nt=\r\nhe hundreds of wooden pieces the team turned up, as well as those \nfrom ear=\r\nlier expeditions, Hayashida thinks that some of the ships of \nthe Mongolian=\r\n fleet could have been 40 meters, and made in Chinese or \nKorean ports.\n\nTo=\r\nday the island (population: 2,800) is covered with lush green pine \nand swe=\r\net-acorn trees, and the fishermen pride themselves on their \ntasty blowfish=\r\n. It&#39;s hard to imagine that this bucolic island was the \nsite of two of the=\r\n biggest and most devastating sea battles in \nhistory. Experts say that som=\r\ne 40,000 soldiers aboard 900 wooden \nships attacked northern Kyushu in 1274=\r\n and killed virtually \nTakashima&#39;s entire population. For some unknown reas=\r\non, the fleet \nleft after two weeks and was destroyed by the divine wind on=\r\n its way \nback home. In the second invasion, in 1281, 140,000 soldiers arri=\r\nved \nin 4,400 ships. When the typhoon hit Imari Bay that summer, about \n3,0=\r\n00 ships and 100,000 soldiers are believed to have vanished under \nthe sea.=\r\n\n\nShinji Takano, archeologist with the Nagasaki Prefectural Board of \nEduca=\r\ntion, thinks that the fleet gathered in the bay to let the \ntyphoon pass. A=\r\n study of a Southern Sung dynasty military ship \nexcavated in China, which =\r\nmay have been similar in design to the \nMongolian ships, shows that a wind =\r\nof nearly 200kmh would have been \nenough to destroy the ships. Takano think=\r\ns that a mega typhoon wind \nblew from the south to the shore. &quot;The bay was =\r\npacked with their \nships. They must have tied their ships to one another to=\r\n stay \ntogether,&quot; he says. The strong wind and high waves probably crushed =\r\n\nthem, and they sank.\n\nHayashida&#39;s expedition is hardly the last word. So f=\r\nar his team has \nnot covered even 1 percent of the battleground. If he can =\r\nfind the \nmoney and manpower to continue his work, we can expect a lot more=\r\n \ndetails to unfold about the Mongolian invasion attempts.\n\n=A9 2004 Newswe=\r\nek, Inc.\n\nhttp://msnbc.msn.com/id/5635132/site/newsweek/\n\n\n"
