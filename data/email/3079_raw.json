I liked it,\n&gt; but unlike when I watch Hideyoshi or Nobunaga or Aoi\n&gt; Sandai, for example, I&#39;m not all that familiar with\n&gt; the story. Any recommendations (in English, if\n&gt; possible...I&#39;ve got my fill translating military\n&gt; documents for the moment) of books to check out that\n&gt; can give me a roadmap here? I&#39;m vaguely familiar with\n&gt; Sakamoto Ryoma from history class, but was a little\n&gt; confused with Kondo Isami and the guy he was chasing\n&gt; in the beginning of the show, but apparently was\n&gt; friends with 10 years before (when they flashed\n&gt; back--William Letham, I know you watched it last\n&gt; night, help with his name??). \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the assitance--I was surprised a little\n&gt; with Katori Shingo&#39;s performance (good, so far) and of\n&gt; course as it has Sawaguchi Yasuko in it, I&#39;m happy.\n&gt; Another question for William--is the woman playing\n&gt; Kondo Isami&#39;s mother the same woman who was\n&gt; Mitsuhide&#39;s mother in &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;?? Sokkuri but I\n&gt; couldn&#39;t catch the name. \n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking of Hideyoshi, Kitsuno, I see you&#39;ve got\n&gt; Ishikawa Goemon as the Samurai of the Month on the\n&gt; website--I just watched the episode where he gets\n&gt; boiled in oil...a little different than the\n&gt; description you&#39;ve got, eh?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks all!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mata!\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
