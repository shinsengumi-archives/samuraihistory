We\nrecently watched &#39;Ghost Dog&#39; and hubby went into a fit of spleen. It\nseems the main character puts a katana back into its sheath UPSIDE-\nDOWN- he&#39;s slice his thumb open if he tried to do that in real life.\n(Giggle. Snort. Chuckle.)\n\nGod, will it ever end?\n\nLili\n\n\tTo be sure, the sword work in &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; was the weakest part... Whittaker\nalso does a wrist-twist that&#39;s more Filipino stick than Japanese sword (the\nsame move we see Cruise execute in solo practise in &quot;Last Samurai,&quot; for that\nmatter).  But &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; wasn&#39;t really about the Way of the Sword, so much\nas the Way of the Warrior.\n\tAnd it worked quite brilliantly as that, a modern man&#39;s search for a way to\nlive out his vision of Bushido in the context of urban America.  His loyalty\nis pure, and what gives him strength is that he&#39;s the only one who\nunderstands the story he&#39;s written of his life.  His own &#39;lord&#39; doesn&#39;t get\nit, although he works with it.  One of the bosses is old-world enough to\nunderstand the kind of man who&#39;s after him, and most of the mob soldiers are\nliving essentially as samurai - that is, they&#39;re household warriors serving\na specific family, with their loyalty and their skills determining their\nstatus in the household structure - but they don&#39;t realise themselves what\nan old-world power structure they live in, and the Whittaker character does.\n\tWhat I saw in Whittaker&#39;s sword work was a man who had decided he ought to\npractise this, but had no instruction.  As I recall, his combat handgun work\nwas rather well done.  So the weak sword style seemed a flaw that was\nconsistently in character.\n\tBesides, recall that before katana, swords were sheathed in a style that\nwould look &quot;upside-down&quot; to a modern kendo practitioner.  Look at the way a\ntachi is rigged for wear.\n\n\tGereg\n\n\n\n"
