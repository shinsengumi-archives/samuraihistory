I see your point. I think I settled the thing for\nnow anyway. The thread the whole thing took place in got really quiet since\ni came up with some minor citations to prove my point.\nThat of course doens�t mean that I lost the interest in finding material to\nhave a closer look on jurisdiction and laws concerning those of samurai\nstatus in the edo-period.\nSo if anyone has further material on that (perhaps a little easier), please\ndon�t hesitate...\n\nKarsten\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 02, 2004 11:19 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Rules and restrictions for the samurai in\nedojidai\n\n\n&gt; Karsten Helmholz wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The other day I had a discussion on the rules and restrictions the\nsamurai\n&gt; &gt; faced in daily life concerning the use of swords. The guy I was talking\nto\n&gt; &gt; insisted on the idea, that they were forbidden by law to draw their\nswords,\n&gt; &gt; unless told to by their superiors.\n&gt; &gt; My point was that there were only resctrictions to the drawing of swords\non\n&gt; &gt; certain occasions like being at the shoguns palace or in the court. I\nguess\n&gt; &gt; there are many more times when it was forbidden but those are the points\n&gt; &gt; that instantly came to my mind. I think that apart from that, there were\nno\n&gt; &gt; laws that restricted the drawing or the use of the sword. One example\nhere\n&gt; &gt; would be kirisute gomen.\n&gt; &gt; My request to the members of this list would be to name any kind of\nsource\n&gt; &gt; that proves my point as I don�t want to rely only on one or two sources\nI\n&gt; &gt; have at hand right now. I can use english, german, french or japanese\ntexts.\n&gt; &gt; Especially original sources or their modern day transcriptions would be\n&gt; &gt; great (i.e. osadamegaki, buke shohatto). Any help will be appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s hard to find that sort of thing; you&#39;re looking for a negative.\n(e.g.,\n&gt; &quot;prove that UFOs don&#39;t exist&quot;). Tell your friend to find citations for his\npoint.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
