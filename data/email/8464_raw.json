I did not think this to\n&gt; be true, but another \n&gt; friend said that before Adams arrived they were\n&gt; using arquebus, and that \n&gt; Adams had introduced the flintlock. Can someone set\n&gt; me straight please?\n\nNope. The flintlock was introduced in Europe around\n1630 \n\nFrom Wiki (though I hate to use them):\n\n&quot;&quot;Flintlock&quot; is the general term for any firearm based\non the flintlock mechanism. The type is now obsolete.\nIntroduced about 1630, it rapidly replaced earlier\ntypes, such as the matchlock and wheellock, and\ncontinued in common use for over two centuries,\nreplaced by cap and cartridge-based systems. The last\nmajor use of flintlocks in the Americas occurred in\nthe first years of the American Civil War; however, a\nfew guns of this type are still manufactured for black\npowder enthusiasts.&quot;\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flintlock\n\nI&#39;ve read that some of the cannon from the ship Adams\narrived on were used at Sekigahara, but I don&#39;t recall\nif this is myth or fact. However, I&#39;ve never heard of\nthem being a decisive factor in any way. No other guns\nfrom the ship would have made a difference, as the\nJapanese had plenty themselves already. \n\nTony, any more info on the cannon, Mr. Sekigahara?\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
