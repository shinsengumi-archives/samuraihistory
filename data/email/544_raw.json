They have been\nairing them since 1963. Most of them are 50 episodes long, 45minutes a\npiece, though the opening and closing are usually a bit longer. They\ngenerally air from January to December here in Japan. A condensed version is\noften aired at the end of the year. As far as I have known only two dramas\nhave been repeated, Ruyuku no Kaze and Takeda Shingen\n&gt;\n&gt; 1963 Hana no Shogai (II Naosuke) note this one aired from April to\nDecember\n&gt; 1964 Ako Roshi (The 47 Ronin story)\n&gt; 1965 Taiko Ki (Hideyoshi)\n&gt; 1966 Minamoto Yoshitsune *\n&gt; 1967 San Shimai (A fictional story set in the Meiji Period)\n&gt; 1968 Ryoma ga Yuku (Sakamoto Ryoma)\n&gt; 1969 Ten to Chi ( Takeda Shingen vs Uesugi Kenshin)\n&gt; 1970 Mominoki wa Nokotta (Harada Kai) *\n&gt; 1971 Haru no Sakamichi (Yagyu Jubei)\n&gt; 1972 Shin Heike Monogatari *\n&gt; 1973 Kunitori Monogatari (Saito Dosan) *\n&gt; 1974 Katsu Kaishu\n&gt; 1975 Genroku Taiheiki (The 47 Ronin story again) *\n&gt; 1976 Kaze to Kumo to Niji to (Taira Masakado) *\n&gt; 1977 Kashin (Choshu han in the Bakumatsu period) *\n&gt; 1978 Ougon no Hibi ( something about Sakai traders in the Philipines in\nthe Sengoku period)*\n&gt; 1979 Kusa Moeru (Hojo Masako) *\n&gt; 1980 Shi shi no jidai (Aizu wakamatsu in the Bakamatsu/Meiji period) *\n&gt; 1981 Onna Taiko Ki (Hideyoshi & his wife Nene) *\n&gt; 1982 Toge no Gunzo (More of the 47 Ronin Story)*\n&gt; 1983 Tokugawa Ieyasu *\n&gt; 1984 Sanga Moyu (Fictional story set during WWII)\n&gt; 1985 Haru no Hato (Fictional story set in Taisho period)\n&gt; 1986 Inochi (Fictional story set in postwar period)\n&gt; 1987 Date Masamune *\n&gt; 1988 Takeda Shingen *\n&gt; 1989 Kasuga Tsubone *\n&gt; 1990 Tobu ga Gotoku (Saigo Takamori & Okubo Toshimichi) *\n&gt; 1991 Taiheiki (Nanboku cho period) *\n&gt; 1992 Nobunaga *\n&gt; 1993 Ruyuku no Kaze (Okinawa at the start of the Edo period/ This drama\nwas only for six months)\n&gt; 1993-94 Homura tatsu (Three generations of the Oshu Fujiwara) This drama\naired from July 93 to March 94*\n&gt; 1994 Hana no Ran (Onin no Ran) This drama aired from April to December*\n&gt; 1995 Hachi Dai Shogun Yoshimune *\n&gt; 1996 Hideyoshi\n&gt; 1997 Mori Motonari *\n&gt; 1998 Tokugawa Yoshinobu\n&gt; 1999 Genroku Ryoran (Yet again the 47 ronins)*\n&gt; 2000 Aoi Tokugawa Sandai (the first 3 Tokugawa Shoguns) *\n&gt; 2001 Hojo Tokimune\n&gt; 2002 Toshie to Matsu (Maeda Toshie and his wife)\n&gt;\n&gt; The ones I asterixed are available in condensed versions from NHK video\nhttp://www.ntkr.co.jp/foa/ . Mind you they are of course in Japanese and\nthey are frightfully expensive. The Takeda Shingen one for example is five\ncassettes and cost 37,800 yen (I guess about $400). I don&#39;t know where one\nwould find them for sale with english subtitles. Tokugawa Ieyasu is\navailable in its complete form 26 cassettes, astronomical price. NHK also\ndoes other historical dramas usually during new year along with many other\nstations here in Japan. Though recently they have become quite scarce. I\nhave managed to copy about 133 different titles of samurai /historical\ndramas on video. This info came from the Japanese magazine TV Guide (Gaido).\nThey publish a guide book to each series every year.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
