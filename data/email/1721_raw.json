Forgive me for my ignorance but how can I =\r\nlook\ninto the pictures posted in the yahoogroup? Can you please provide a U=\r\nRL\nto the sword pictures described below. Thanks so much guys!\n\nGerald \n\n--=\r\n---Original Message-----\nFrom: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@...] \nSe=\r\nnt: Wednesday, May 07, 2003 3:06 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubj=\r\nect: Re: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\n\nCarlo-\n\tScott has the tra=\r\nnslation so he can easily straighten us out \nand the mountings are clearly =\r\nwartime production. Without further \ninfo though, I stand by my translation=\r\n. The Nihonto Meikan lists five \nKatsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one =\r\nwho signed in this manner. \nThe shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of =\r\nSengo Masashige. \nMasashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa. Banshu =\r\nKatsuyoshi \nwas originally from the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and worked aroun=\r\nd the \nTenna era (1681-1683).\n\tOne would expect to see some characteristics=\r\n of the Sengo \nschool in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and monouchi a=\r\nre \nimportant. I agree no final determination can be made without sword \nin=\r\n hand, but I would posit that a faker or &#39;tribute&#39; sword would \nhardly choo=\r\nse to copy the work of a late generation smith from a \nlittle known line.\nT=\r\nom\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nSamurai Arch=\r\nives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, s=\r\nend an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of=\r\n Yahoo!
