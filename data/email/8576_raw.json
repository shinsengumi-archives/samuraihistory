Who wrote it?\n\nDan Cooper\n\nIjin Mibu wrote:\n\n&gt;     &quot;The sword was never more necessary in Japan&#39;s History than it \n&gt;was five hundred years ago, in that era of strife and civil war. But \n&gt;what did &quot;combat&quot; actually involve in those far-off days? It sure as \n&gt;hell wasn&#39;t like these neat roam-mat dojos we have today. They were \n&gt;fighting in the mountains, on riverbanks, tripping over tree roots \n&gt;and stones. The weapons they used, swords... spears... arrows... \n&gt;anything! You didn&#39;t even opponent would be on foot he could have \n&gt;came at you on horseback! How effective would any of our fancy \n&gt;modern sword styles have been, back then? While we were still edging \n&gt;our toes forward gauging the distance between our swords... some \n&gt;armored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with his spear!&quot; \n&gt;      &quot;And there are fools out there looking for spirityuality in \n&gt;the sword. Four hundred sword schools had opened up with a few years \n&gt;of the founding of the shogunate. Four hundred! But that didn&#39;t mean \n&gt;swordsmanship was flourishing, it just means a lot of bored samurai \n&gt;are selling their skills to buy rice. They can&#39;t offer content so \n&gt;they babble about spirit. And to keep other schools from stealing \n&gt;their students--their moneybags--they cooked up useless &quot;secret \n&gt;techniques&quot; just so they&#39;ed look different from other schools. Oh \n&gt;and god forbid those moneybags get hurt! Oh, no, it&#39;s face-guards! \n&gt;Gloves! Body Armor! Light Bamboo Swords! So what do you wind up \n&gt;with? Peacetime warriors who have never faced a naked blade; felt \n&gt;the fear of death!&quot;\n&gt;      I posted this to show one reason the samurai became weak and \n&gt;the martial art people in the group. I&#39;d like to hear what you think \n&gt;about it.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
