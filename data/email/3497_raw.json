[Jap.] In the former feudal system\n\nDo you live in a country with a feudal system?\n\n&gt; of\n&gt; Japan\n\nSo, it has to be Japan, possibly...\n\n&gt; the class or a member of the class\n\nClasses were clearly defined in Tokugawa Japan, now they aren&#39;t. Today, \neven somebody in Japan with samurai blood would never say: &quot;I am a \nsamurai.&quot;\n\n&gt; of military\n\ni.e. soldiers\n\n&gt; retainers of\n&gt; the daimios\n\nAnd here is the big point: Samurai SERVED a (Japanese) feudal lord. \nGood luck on that in 2004.\n\n&gt; constituting the gentry or lesser nobility. They\n&gt; possessed power of life and death over the commoners\n\nWhich you don&#39;t today (hopefully)\n\n&gt; and wore two\n&gt; swords as their distinguishing mark.\n\nWhich you don&#39;t today (hopefully) - 2\n\n&gt; Their special rights and\n&gt; privileges were abolished\n\nIt reads ***ABOLISHED***\n\n&gt; with the fall of feudalism in 1871.\n\nThat is 133 years ago.\n\n\nSo... If you say things like: &quot;I try to follow the Bushido code,&quot; or \nyou simply imply that you live by a certain set of rules, inspired by \nthe Samurai: that&#39;s ok.\n\nIt&#39;s when people say: &quot;I AM a Samurai&quot; that it gets hilarious.\n\nI hope I have made my point.\n\nbye!\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
