In addition to the daimyo, what specific \nofficers/ministers/apparatchiks/functionaries would such a clan have?\n\nDaimyo&#39;s bodyguard?\nCouncil of important vassal daimyo?\nTreasurer?\nOfficial bean counter?\n\nWhat sorts of positions would be found in such a clan? I understand \nthat it will differ from clan to clan somewhat, but I would like to \nget a clear picture of what sorts of offices there are and who would \ntypically fill them. \n\nRespectfully,\nAndrew Benton\nhttp://www.spearweasel.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
