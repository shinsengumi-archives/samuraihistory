As you can see there are  \nmany strong opinions here, the underlying theme being if you are  \ngoing to write about the conception of the samurai you had first  \nbetter know from real history just what a samurai really is (was).  \nWill you study only one period in Japanese History as background or  \nall of it? The samurai dominated art, culture and politics for close  \nto a thousand years. What will be your control model? How western  \nscholars view the samurai? How Japanese scholars view him? How  \nJapanese popular culture sees him today or how he was viewed in context?\n\tThere are a lot of great films out there, what is the cut off for  \n&quot;modern Hollywood film?&quot; Is &quot;Memoirs&quot; included in your list? Would  \nyou include Black Rain? or Mr Baseball? or Gung-ho? None feature a  \nman in 16th century armour but all feed the (mis-)conception. What  \nabout The Octagon, The Challenge, Red Sun, Bushido Blade or The  \nYakuza? or even The Killer Elite or Bataan and a dozen other war  \nfilms? are they too old to be &quot;modern?&quot; How are you going to sort  \nthem out and decide what to include and what to ignore? It is a big  \njob. It certainly can be done but you may need to tighten your focus  \nor you&#39;ll wind up starting off on a career rather than a dissertation...\n-t\n\nGood luck with both BTW\n\n"
