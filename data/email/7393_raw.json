For example, my name is Angus Haynes. Haynes is a\n&gt; derivitive of the German word Hain, meaning a forest or Grove, while\n&gt; Angus, as best I can tell from a quick Google search, is Gaelic for\n&gt; &#39;unique&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; So using a little creativity, as well as Tony&#39;s excellent page on\n&gt; Japanese names on his &#39;Online Japanese Miscellany&#39; website, I came up\n&gt; with my &#39;samurai name&#39; of Mori Kazumoto (Mori = forest, Kazu = first,\n&gt; Moto = origin). Of course, it&#39;s not really *your name* in kanji, as you\n&gt; can&#39;t really translate it back if you don&#39;t know the original name...\n&gt; but hey, it&#39;s a bit of fun!\n&gt;\n&gt; AngusH\n\n\n\n\n\n"
