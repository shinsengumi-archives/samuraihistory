Mr. Hyakutake trains Hyoho Niten Ichi ryu\nunder Imai Masayuki soke and has translated some of soke&#39;s writings\n(including some info about Musashi and Buddhism) here:\nhttp://www.bunbun.ne.jp/~sword/Hyoho1.html\n\nIn Koryu Bujutsu book (edited by Diane Skoss, ISBN: 1-890536-04-0,\nwww.koryu.com) there is an article by Mr. David A. Hall: Marishiten -\nBuddhist Influences on Combative Behavior.\n\nAt www.e-budo.com there are couple of people who could propably point\nyou to better sources, so you might want to try there. Mr. William\nBodiford is an associate professor in UCLA and has specialized (IIRC)\non Buddhist studies and has trained Kashima-Shinryu for a long time.\nMr. Karl Friday is a history professor in University of Georgia and\nMenkyo Kaiden in Kashima-Shinryu and might also have some thing to say\nabout the subject.\n\nA little older book: Blomberg, Catharina: Samurai Religion (1977,\nUppsala University) might also have something on the subject. The book\nmight be quite hard to get, but maybe you could try a local University\nlibrary.\n\nBtw. our iaido teacher Takada Gakudo sensei is mikkyo buddhist. At\nleast one person who has visited him in Japan has taken part of some\nof his religious practises. Takada sensei has only once briefly talked\nabout his religion, so I don&#39;t have much knowledge about it. Maybe\nnext Autumn I can find something out as I was lucky enough to get\naccepted for an exchange student program and will spend a year in\nJapan near where our sensei lives (yes, I know I&#39;m a lucky bas**** :).\n\nPlease share with us if you find something more about the subject! I\nbelieve many are familiar with the over emphasized zen buddhist\ninfluence in budo, while mikkyo buddhism (which propably has had more\ninfluence) is not very well known.\n\n--\nMikko Vilenius - co-admin:\nhttp://www.hiphop-directory.com\n&quot;As private parts to the gods are we,\n they play with us for their sport&quot;\n-Lord Melchett, Black Adder S2 EP06\n\n\n\n"
