Devoid of a master, a samurai(&#39;one who\nserves&#39;) became a ronin (&#39;wave man&#39;) and as the\nTokugawa period evolved and the state demilitarized,\nbeing a ronin often led to little more than crime,\ndebauchery, poverty, or jobs in teaching or medicine. \nGood luck whatever happens\nM.Lorimer  \n\n\n --- TIMOTHY HEATON &lt;jahladracul@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\nhi my name is timothy heaton of the email\njahladracul@...\ni have inquired this listing of samurai history on my\npersonal behalf for seeking the answers to the meaning\nof my life.i sincerly seek the way of the samurai,i am\nvery serius ,i have much to change about myself and i\nhave tried to live as a smurai would live according to\nwhat i have learned before and it makes sense to me\nbut needs get in the way especialy in america and\nsince there are few places to go for peace anymore.i\nlove the earth and i have proven that by living 25\nyears without a drivers liscense and the ownership of\na pollutting vehichle,i ride a bycycle or walk ,once\nin awhile i except rides,but i insist on standing my\nground for what i believe even when others throw it in\nmy face.i strongly believe in the way of the samurai\nand i choose to be a true samurai no matter what i\nmust do, the way of a samurai in which i have\nattempted has made me feel a like i found were i\nbelong and it means more to me than anything else in\nall of which ive learned in life.sincerly tim heaton\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
