When the dust settled after the final Tokugawa triumph\nhe ended up with substantial holdings around Sendai.   He is a very colorful\nfigure partly because of he wore eye-patch and truly flamboyant helmets. \n  He\nsponsored a mission to Europe to visit the Pope and showed some partiality\ntowards Christianity and Christians until it was clear which way the \npolitical\nwinds were blowing.\n\nNHK, the Japanese national broadcasting company, devoted a long mini-series\nto his life, called Masamune, the One-Eyed Dragon (Dokuganryu, I think), and\nreleased this mini-series on VHS and DVD some time ago.   I&#39;ve seen it \nlisted\nfor sale on various Asian media web-sites.  \n\nScott wrote:\n\n&gt; The specifing post reminded me of a question I had.  Could somene\n&gt; here tell me who Date Masamune was?
