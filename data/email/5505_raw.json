The question was &quot;what did the=\r\n \naverage Samurai have to pay for swords?&quot; As Nate has pointed out the \npri=\r\nce of rice and it&#39;s value against gold and silver fluctuated \nthroughout th=\r\ne historical period so it is very hard to say at any given \npoint in histor=\r\ny, what something cost then in real dollars today. I \nqualified my answer w=\r\nith, &quot;it depends&quot;, because early on the average \nsoldier was simply equippe=\r\nd by his lord, I haven&#39;t come across any \nexamples of the cost of an indivi=\r\ndual sword or even groups of swords \nfrom that time. (That is not to say th=\r\nat I ain&#39;t looking). Once you get \ninto the Edo period it is much easier to=\r\n find examples/anecdotes and \nthe monetary system and it&#39;s relative values =\r\nare better understood.\n\tI apologize if it wasn&#39;t clear that the smiths I us=\r\ned as examples were \nbetter known and commanded slightly higher prices, and=\r\n of course famous \nworks were out of reach for most then as now...\n-t\n\n\nOn =\r\nSep 10, 2004, at 12:53 AM, zevlord wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;  &gt; Wayne-\n&gt;  &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 It depends a great deal on what era =\r\nyou are talking about.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Well actually the value placed on most blades=\r\n is largely determined\n&gt;  by the reputation of the maker, age has little ef=\r\nfect on the worth.\n&gt;  For Example, a blade made in 1661 by Kotetsu (Musashi=\r\n Province)\n&gt;  demands several times the price of one made in 1368 by Kunimu=\r\nne\n&gt;  (Etchu Provine).

At\n&gt;  present, there are no more than on hundred thousand =\r\nswords in Japan.\n&gt;  In fact, there are more samurai swords in America today=\r\n than there\n&gt;  are in Japan.
