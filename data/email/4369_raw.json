Reality, of course, is\nthat a samurai couldn&#39;t ever be beaten by a commoner.\nIt takes a ninja, 3rd skill level, to beat a samurai.\nUnless you&#39;ve got the &quot;invincible armor&quot; power up, in\nwhich case the townsperson could win, but only if he\nhad the secret &quot;throwing star&quot; attack also.\n\n&gt; PS Nate yours is a rare talent, I laughed so hard I\n&gt; feel &quot;beated up&quot; \n&gt; myself.\n\nThank you, I try. If we can&#39;t laugh at ourselves....at\nleast we can get a cheap laugh at another&#39;s expense. \n\nTo be somewhat serious about this, I&#39;m sure if you\nlooked through &quot;police files&quot; or whatever records the\nlocal magistrates kept, there would be plenty of\ninstances where commoners beat up on samurai, and vice\nversa. It&#39;d be fairly interesting to see if they\nmachi-bugyo handled the cases any differently. Where\nyou&#39;d find any of this in Engish, I have no idea. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\nhttp://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/\n\n"
