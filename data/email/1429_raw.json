(Hirotada sent his first wife (Odai) back \nto her brother after Mizuno Nobumoto broke with the\nImagawa - did he do the same with his second wife?)\n\nSadler, in his biog. of Ieyasu, mentions Toda Yasumitsu and his \nbrother Goro (of Imarashi Castle) - other sources mention \nYasumitsu and his son, Masanao, but no mention of a brother - \nare both true?\n\nTawara and Imarashi castles were overthrown after Toda&#39;s\ndefection. Presumably they survived to live the bandit life \n(or at least at large) to kidnap Takechiyo a year or so later.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI am currently writing a peice of historical fiction (loosely) \nbased around these events - any answers or ideas would be \nwelcome.\n\nNo, I don&#39;t read Japanese, so yes, I am working under somewhat \nof a disadvantage (to put it lightly), but hey - it didn&#39;t hurt \nJames Clavell none!\n\nI also have the first chapter ready. If anyone&#39;s interested let \nme know, and I&#39;ll figure out somewhere to put it!\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
