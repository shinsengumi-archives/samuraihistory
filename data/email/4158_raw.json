Tokugawa did the\n&gt; unifying of Japan because his incursions had peace\n&gt; as a goal, unlike the\n&gt; christian Nobunaga, that only spread terrorism and\n&gt; genocide.\n\n1. Nobunaga--NOT CHRISTIAN. \n\n2. TAKEDA SHINGEN&#39;S GOAL: POWER AND CONTROL.\nTOKUGAWA IEYASU&#39;S GOAL: POWER AND CONTROL.\nODA NOBUNAGA&#39;S GOAL: POWER AND CONTROL.\n\nTakeda Shingen killed his own father. Sure, a lot of\npeople admire him, but you&#39;re mistaken if you think\nhe&#39;s perfect. \n\nTokugawa&#39;s goal wasn&#39;t peace--it was control. If it\nwas simply peace, why didn&#39;t he let Hideyori take\ncontrol? What was the need for a Sekigahara or Osaka\nCampaign?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Btw, that statements (babbling in japanese) about\n&gt; Musashi being not fammous\n&gt; to real japan dwellers is ridiculous. \n\nNo one said he wasn&#39;t famous in Japan--just that it&#39;s\nsad that he&#39;s the one samurai that most Westerners\nknow. Sure, he&#39;s famous--why else do a Taiga Drama\nbased on him? However, he&#39;s overrated. \n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
