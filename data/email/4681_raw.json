To \nbecome \n&gt; a Samurai you must have the right bloodline, is this correct? Also \n&gt; how old would a boy be before he turned Samurai. And how old would \nhe \n&gt; have to be before his first battle or was it, when he proved \nhimself \n&gt; ready.&#92;\nmy goes would be as soon asthey are ordered\n\n\n\n"
