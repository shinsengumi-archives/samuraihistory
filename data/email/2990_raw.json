He suffered \nthe loss of his Matsudaira vassals so=\r\non afterwards and managed to \nalienate many of his retainers due to his oft=\r\nen thoughtless nature. \nBetween 1561 and 1565, he felt compelled to execute=\r\n or quell a \nnumber of his men, including Ii Naochika (1562) and Ii=F4 Tsur=\r\nutatsu \n(1565). He came into conflict with the Takeda and although Ujizane =\r\n\nwas the son of Takeda Shingen&#39;s sister, the latter invaded Suruga in \n1568=\r\n while Tokugawa Ieyasu attacked T=F4t=F4mi. As Ujizane was married \nto a da=\r\nughter of H=F4j=F4 Ujiyasu, the H=F4j=F4 offered the Imagawa \nassistance bu=\r\nt to no avail. By 1570 Shingen had taken Sumpu and \nUjizane essentially sur=\r\nrendered to Tokugawa Ieyasu from Kakegawa \nCastle. He retired to Kyoto in 1=\r\n575 and had hopes that he might \nrecieve Sumpu once the Takeda were defeate=\r\nd in 1582, but Nobunaga \nrefused to allow Tokugawa to do this. He eventuall=\r\ny joined Tokugawa \nat Edo, having taken the name S=F4kan and the tonsure. H=\r\ne was \nsupported by Ieyasu until his death in 1614.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;W.
