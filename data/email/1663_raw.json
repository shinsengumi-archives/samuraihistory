The Satsuma army were samurai, and Saigo \n&gt;Takamori is often called the last samurai. Both of these battles \n&gt;have a heroic, noble failure, last stand, feel about them.\n\nGreat fights and great stories both, certainly bushi versus bushi but \nhow &quot;Western&quot; was the fighting? Tabaruzaka was lost once the rain \nstopped and cannon fire was effectively directed upon the defenders. \nI don&#39;t mean to be obtuse, simply my own teacher always argued the \ntrue bushi died at Sekigahara.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;By the way, Takasugi Shinsaku was quite a high ranking Choushuu \n&gt;samurai and seems to have been very conscious of his own rank. It \n&gt;doesn&#39;t seem accurate to see him as a democratic figure. Like most \n&gt;of the Choushuu Meiji heroes, many of whom rose from being \n&gt;commanders of the shotai (samurai-farmer militia) he was a brilliant \n&gt;opportunist.\n\nI agree completely, I never said he was a democratic figure, only \nthat it was his use of men of all social status, employing western \narms and guerilla tactics, that may disqualify the restoration \nbattles as &quot;The last Samurai battle&quot;.\n\n&gt;  Ito and Inoue were quite low-rank: Inoue&#39;s upbringing as described \n&gt;in Choushuu no Tenka was that of a farming-samurai family. Many \n&gt;samurai did not want to join the militia as the new methods of rifle \n&gt;drill and so on were considered too boring. Farmers on the other \n&gt;hand found this less boring than the hardship of their lives and \n&gt;possibly also saw it as a way to enter the samurai class.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d be interested to know if any of the Meiji leaders were \n&gt;interested in western-style democratic ideas.\n\n\tI read that Ryoma, in addition to that book on International \nlaws of the sea, had read Jean Jacque Rousseaus&#39; The Social Contract. \nA book frankly that I would never have read myself had I not believed \nthis.\n\tAs an aside, I believe democratic institutions have yet to \ntake hold in Japan, that what we think is democracy is only \n&quot;Tatemae&quot;...\n-t\n\n&gt;\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
