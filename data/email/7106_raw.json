Don&#39;t buy/pay for it! If you know it&#39;s all lies, and you think that\nthis Hayes should not be earning money from this, then don&#39;t give him your\nmoney.\n2. Encourage people not to see this documentary. But, do not simply tell\nthem &quot;It&#39;s all lies....Hayes is a fraud&quot; because they will not take so\nseriously an extreme point of view as a more moderate one.\n3. Create your own documentary. If you want this documentary to not be\ntaken seriously and you want people to know the correct information, then\ncreate a documentary with the correct information. Talking among ourselves\nabout how much of a fraud Hayes is does not solve the problem that this\ndocumentary is out there and spreading inferior information.\n\nDaniel Zollman\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
