I&#39;m on a Kurosawa \nshopping spree, so far I have Seven Samurai and Ran, I&#39;m aiming next \nat either The Hidden Fortress or Throne of Blood, both look really \ngood, after that Yojimbo, etc...\n\nAs for The Last Samurai, last week I read that it is directed by \nEdward Zwick, who was the director of Glory, an american civil war \nmovie, and even though I&#39;m sure it has many historical flaws \n(including some of the main characters being made up) it treated the \nsubject matter with respect and was very well done (it&#39;s one of my \nfavorite), so now I have a lil bit more hope with Last Samurai...\n\nSam the Miburo\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Masamori Masami&quot; \n&lt;oni_shogun@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shogun was a mini-series, 10 hours, and is coming out on DVD in \n&gt; Sept. I also believe they made a shorter tv movie of Shogun, that \n&gt; probaly isnt that good since they would have to cut out 8-7 hours \nof \n&gt; the storyline.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Kagemusha is infact about Takeda Shingen and how after he died, \ndue \n&gt; to a bullet wound, his head generals got a double to pretend to be \n&gt; him. They managed to hide his death for a year, I believe. The \nmovie \n&gt; has Nobunaga and Ieyasu in it, but its not about Nobunaga. By the \n&gt; way, this did actually happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ive seen a few Kurosawa films, and they seem very accurate. I \n&gt; recommend any Kurosawa film.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; \n&gt; &lt;the_sam_99@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Is Shogun also a movie? I thought it was only a book...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do you guys think of the Kurosawa samurai movies, are they \n&gt; &gt; historically accurate? I hear that Kagemusha is about using a \n&gt; double \n&gt; &gt; of Oda Nobunaga to hide his death. Was this fiction or are there \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; least some rumors to it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Wolf of Mibu\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&gt; &gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed....I think it will be painful. Horribly Wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And that&#39;s on top of how I feel about Tom Cruise in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; general. It will be the pain of Shogun (the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; translations, the Edo-jidai uniform kimono, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; silliness of the whole love story) on a much grander\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scale. It will hurt. It will kill me. And I will go.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- &quot;Anthony J.

But what do you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guys think of it? Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you think it has the potential to be up there with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shogun and The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crapfest to make money\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I look at going to it much as I do going to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dentist. I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t like it. I know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;ll hurt.
