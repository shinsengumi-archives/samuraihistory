Sonatine =\r\n\nwas released in 1993. Zatoichi was released in 2003. The following \nare th=\r\ne descriptions from the DVD covers:\n\n&quot;ZATOICHI: THE BLIND SWORDSMAN: In an =\r\nempire ruled by fear, the \npeople&#39;s only hope is the ultimate weapon: Zatoi=\r\nchi (Kitano) -- a \nblind, nomadic samurai whose sword has made him a hero a=\r\nnd whose \ncourage has made him a legend! Determined to help the desperate \n=\r\nresidents of a village, Zatoichi seeks justice through revenge!\n\nSONATINE: =\r\nA seasoned mobster travels to Okinawa on a &quot;peace-keeping&quot; \nmission, even t=\r\nhough he suspects that his boss is secretly trying to \neliminate him! Deter=\r\nmined to not go down without a fight, he and his \ngang know exactly what th=\r\ney have to do!&quot;\n\nZatoichi is rated R for strong stylized bloody violence. S=\r\nonatine is \nrated R for bloody shootings, language, and some sexuality.\n\nTh=\r\ne Movie:\nI had a strange revelation after watching Sonatine and Zatoichi. T=\r\nhe \nwhole time I thought the star, Takeshi Kitano (aka Beat Takeshi), \nlook=\r\ned very familiar, but I couldn&#39;t figure out where I knew him \nfrom. At the =\r\nconclusion of Sonatine, Quentin Tarantino remarks that \nhe&#39;s primarily know=\r\nn for being a comedic actor. It&#39;s then I realized \nwhere I knew him from. H=\r\ne&#39;s Vic Romano from &quot;Most Extreme \nElimination Challenge&quot; on Spike TV. I wa=\r\ns stunned and amused by the \nrevelation. It&#39;s like figuring out that dramat=\r\nic actor Robin \nWilliams was Mork from Ork. In any case, it&#39;s a testament t=\r\no the \nguy&#39;s acting ability. He goes from being a clown on a Japanese game =\r\n\nshow to being either a blind samurai or a yakuza gangster with ease. \nTo t=\r\nop it all off he wrote and directed both films. That&#39;s an \namazing accompli=\r\nshment no matter how you look at it.\n\nOf the two films included on this DVD=\r\n &quot;double feature&quot;, I liked &quot;The \nBlind Swordsman: Zatoichi&quot; the best. The f=\r\nilm is of the samurai \ngenre. Zatoichi is a blind former samurai who travel=\r\ns the country \nhelping people. In this film he gets in some very impressive=\r\n \nswordfights. They are also notable because they feature CGI blood \nspurts=\r\n. When Zatoichi slashes someone, it sprays out in graphic \ndisplays. I don&#39;=\r\nt recall seeing CGI used in swordfights like this \nbefore. The fights are a=\r\nlso notable because the battles don&#39;t last \nmore than one or two moves. Usu=\r\nally someone is slashed in short \norder and it&#39;s over with. But besides the=\r\n fights, there is some \nimpressive scenery, beautiful period costumes, and =\r\nvery detailed \nsets. It&#39;s a great looking film. The story is also good, too=\r\n. It \nbuilds up to a confrontation between Zaotichi and a ronin Samurai \nac=\r\nting as a bodyguard for the main villain of the movie. While their \nfinal c=\r\nonfrontation is a bit anticlimactic, the buildup to it is \ngood. However, a=\r\nt the very end of the movie it takes a very bizarre \ntwist. The surviving c=\r\nharacters celebrate by breaking into a tap \ndance routine. Yup. Up until th=\r\nat point it was very much a period \npiece, but then it turns into Japanese =\r\nRiverdance. It was odd, but I \nguess Japanese audiences liked it.\n\nThe seco=\r\nnd film is Sonatine. This one is quite different from \nZatoichi. It falls i=\r\nnto the gangster / yakuza genre. Takeshi Kitano \nagain impresses with a dra=\r\nmatic performance. He also handles the \naction well. This film is notable f=\r\nor its particularly vicious \ngunfights that pop up out of nowhere. They are=\r\n spontaneous and \nstunning because of their intensity. However, when the Ta=\r\nkeshi and \nhis gang hide out at a beach house from the other yakuza, it tak=\r\nes a \nparticularly boring turn. You see over an hour of these gangsters \ngo=\r\ning through male bonding. They shoot cans off of each others \nheads, dig in=\r\n the sand, sumo wrestle, and more. This gets a bit \ntedious until the actio=\r\nn starts again. \n\nIf you like Asian films, action films, samurai movies, or=\r\n gangster \nmovies, then you&#39;ll definitely want to check out this DVD. And i=\r\nf \nyou like MXC, you&#39;ll want to check out Vic Romano in full bloody \naction=\r\n.\n\nThe Extras:\nThere are a few extras included on this DVD:\n\nZATOICHI:\n\nBeh=\r\nind the Scenes Special =96 This is your standard &quot;making of&quot; video. \nIt fol=\r\nlows the production from the initial press conference all the \nway up to it=\r\ns premiere. You see them rehearse the swordfights, \npractice the tap dancin=\r\ng number, filming on location, and more. It&#39;s \na very in-depth look at the =\r\nmaking of the movie.\n\nVideo Interview with the crew (cinematographer, produ=\r\nction designer, \ncostume designer, master swordsman) =96 These short interv=\r\niews feature \na number of the key crew from the film. My favorite was with =\r\nthe \nmaster swordsman. He talked about the style of sword fighting used \nin=\r\n the film, how he worked with Takeshi, and more.\n\nSONATINE:\n\nBeat Takeshi I=\r\nnterview =96 For a man that does everything, Takeshi \nseems awfully camera =\r\nshy. Despite this, he talks at length about \nfilming his movies, Quentin Ta=\r\nrantino, and more. Fans of his will \nenjoy this. You definitely gain greate=\r\nr appreciation for his work \nafter seeing this.\n\nPrologue and Epilogue by Q=\r\nuentin Tarantino =96 Tarantino delivers a \nsometimes rambling intro and &quot;ou=\r\ntro&quot; to the film. He talks about how \ngreat Takeshi is, how Sonatine revolu=\r\ntionized yakuza films, what \nJapanese moviegoing culture is like, and more.=\r\n It&#39;s cool to see that \nhe&#39;s such a big fan, but it definitely seems like h=\r\ne does this talk \non the fly.\n\nThe Bottom Line: \nIf you like Asian action m=\r\novies, you&#39;ll probably enjoy Zatoichi and \nSonatine. They are from two very=\r\n different genres, but they have a \nlot to offer in the way of action, exot=\r\nic setting, and drama.\n\nhttp://www.comingsoon.net/news/dvdreviewsnews.php?i=\r\nd=3D7086\n\n\n\n\n"
