What I&#39;m looking for is old scrolls of travels and\n&gt; documentation.\n&gt;\n&gt; This man interest me because I&#39;ve followed his tales starting in Greece\n&gt; and Rome, to all parts of the world, over a very LONG time. It can&#39;t all be\n&gt; the same person, offspring I&#39;m guessing. I&#39;ve lost the story in Japan. At\n&gt; least the written story. I picked it up again in Hungry during the 1500&#39;s,\n&gt; but there is still mention of him training with the Samurai and personally\n&gt; protecting the emperor for some times.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway. I&#39;ll find it. Was just wondering if anyone had heard any folk\n&gt; tales, seen any paintings or art referencing a white or silver haired\n&gt; Samurai or any thing around that time period.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; EB\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
