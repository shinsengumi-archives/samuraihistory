University of Hawaii has a very broad Asian History \nprogram that includes Japanese History, Berkeley and Princeton have  \ngood programs, there&#39;s one in Chicago that&#39;s well known, and others \naround the country. Sometimes they fall under history in college \nprograms, sometimes under East Asian culture (I think Harvard does \nthis), but there are definitely college course in Japanese history out \nthere...\n\n   It does depend on what periods of japanese history you&#39;re looking \nfor, the general breakdown seemed to be (prehistory thru Sengoku), \n(Sengoku to Meiji), (late Tokugawa to some time in the 29th Century).\nDifferent schools will have teachers who specialize in different \nperiods and aspects within those periods (Dr Mary Berry at Berkeley, \nfor example, wrote about Sengoku period Kyoto and the effects of war \non the culture of its inhabitants). \n\nAlex Hazlett\n   \n\n\n\n\n"
