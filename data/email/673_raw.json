You absolutely kick ass!\n\nI wonder what Sun Tzu would think if he knew that, 2500 years on HIS writings would help kids play video games? if he knew what a video game was.\n\nAlso, on a completely different note, have any of you ever wondered that if Sun Tzu was japanese, and a Daimyo during the sengoku period, would he have become Shogun? could he beat Nobunaga? or Iyasu (tokugawa)? \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalised at My Yahoo!.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
