Because if she were to actually disguise herself as a man at that p=\r\noint  \n&gt; -- she would have to engage in &quot;identity-theft&quot; and take over the =\r\nidentity of \n&gt; a  real, living (or recently-deceased) man. I have doubts th=\r\nat this sort of  \n&gt; identity-theft could take place. \n \n\nRemember, this is =\r\nthe Sengoku, not the computer age where you can check out someone&#39;s backgro=\r\nund easily. &#39;Naotora&#39; could simply have shown up and identified herself as =\r\none of her father&#39;s vassals or a son that had been put in a monastery-no id=\r\nentity theft needed. Having custody of Naomasa would have been all the cred=\r\nibility she needed. &#39;Naotora&#39; played the part of a man to the hilt and the =\r\nIi vassals believed her to be so (many were quite angry when the deception =\r\ncame to light when Naomasa took leadership of the clan). If they didn&#39;t, it=\r\n&#39;s unlikely they would have continued to support the clan-it was in a very =\r\nprecarious situation and most were ready to jump ship. It wouldn&#39;t have bee=\r\nn that hard to hide. &#39;Naotora&#39; could always be sick and unable to receive v=\r\nisitors, out on a trip, or otherwise unavailable-from the limited amount of=\r\n info in the Rekishi Gunzou volume, it seemed like she spent most of the ti=\r\nme in her regular identity except when &#39;Naotora&#39; needed to put in an appear=\r\nance. It wasn&#39;t like just anyone could drop in on &#39;him&#39; anytime, and &#39;Naoto=\r\nra&#39;s&#39; confederates in the temple would cover for her. Japanese women are no=\r\nt known for being big busted-that would have been easy to hide in a loose m=\r\nonk&#39;s robe. Since her head was also shaved, this is another thing that blur=\r\ns sexual identity.\nSometimes it was very difficult to tell a woman from a m=\r\nan back then-think of all the pretty-boy pages or even the legends of Yoshi=\r\ntsune dressing like a woman. Heck, I was watching a Sure Death movie the ot=\r\nher day where the bad guy had two pages-one male, one female-and I absolute=\r\nly could not tell which was which.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
