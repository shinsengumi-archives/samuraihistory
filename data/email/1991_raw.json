Offhand, i think that you could examine what sort of =\r\nproblems William Adams might have had fitting into such a different culture=\r\n, and also what the similarities might have been - the UK was also pretty f=\r\nuedal - tho not to the same extent. He might have looked for similarities b=\r\netween the cultures in order to start finding his way as it were. Hope this=\r\n helps. Email me back if you need more help.
