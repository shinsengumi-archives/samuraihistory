Worth area know there is a Japanese Armor Exhibit going on right now in Dallas.  I&#39;m sorry for not putting this out their sooner but computer use is so limited right now.  Anyway, it&#39;s on Flora St. in Dallas, but I don&#39;t know EXACTLY where it is being held.  I am sorry for not being more precise with my information.  I didn&#39;t bring my paper with the address on it with me to my local Kinko&#39;s!  HA HA... As soon as I do I will write you all and let you know.  It is only going on until the 26th of August so get moving!  I just found out about it and nearly died because I didn&#39;t know it was here.!!!  Like I said, if I find the paper with the address on it I&#39;ll pass that along for you all. \n \nEnjoy,\nChristine\n\n\n&quot;Eagles may soar, but weasles don&#39;t get caught in jet engines.&quot;\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo You Yahoo!?\nHotJobs, a Yahoo! service - Search Thousands of New Jobs\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
