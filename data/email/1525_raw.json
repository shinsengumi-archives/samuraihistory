I am not\n&gt;saying they were less honorable.  But the ideal of going off and\n&gt;killing all the bad muslim people (just a statement of the feeling of\n&gt;the time of the knights, I have nothing against muslims as a group)\n&gt;for the glory of god and holy mother church or you will burn in hell\n&gt;for all eternity does not seem any more honorable.  Just my 2 cents.\n\nAlthough your point is correct regarding some of the misdirected efforts of \nthe Crusades, the general statement should not be applied to knights in \ngeneral.\n\nIn the end, knights and samurai had the same faults as anyone else, in spite \nof their intentions simply because they were human and subject to all \ninfluences that the rest of us are exposed to.\n\nHonda\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  \nhttp://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\n\n\n"
