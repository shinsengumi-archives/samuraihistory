Yes, some samurai \n&gt;really believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to see \n&gt;that. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the \n&gt;peacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat&#39;s why it was written, during the Sengoku period offing your lord \nand taking his place wasn&#39;t considered a bad thing if you succeeded. You \ncould call Sengoku the Age of Treachery without stretching it. If Akechi \nhad succeeded, it would have gone done as a great feat and the Edo \nperiod would have been very different.\n\n&gt;   From: Eponymous13@...\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey.\n&gt;       There are such things as &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;dishonourable&quot; wars, this is true. \n&gt; One thing war always is, and that&#39;s UGLY.  There&#39;s no such thing as a \n&gt;&quot;beautiful war&quot;.  That&#39;s an oxymoron if ever I heard one.  \n&gt;\nSome of the Italian wars of manuever were beautiful since the opposing \ntroops paraded around until out manuevered and then surrendered without \nfighting. Those troops either cost money or are citizens after all. Of \ncourse this rapidly ended when some bloody minded types showed up.\n\nJim\n\n\n"
