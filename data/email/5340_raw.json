The answer is\nNO. \n\n Would you agree to the phrase,\n&gt; for instance, that \n&gt; a taisho outranks an ashigaru?\n\nYes, but I wouldn&#39;t say that &quot;taisho&quot; is a higher RANK\nthan &quot;ashigaru&quot;. Again, the difference between &quot;rank&quot;\nand &quot;ranking&quot;. \n\n&gt; I do. But then again, I think that your personal\n&gt; experience and your \n&gt; technical expertise is coloring too much the way you\n&gt; are using the \n&gt; word rank. But then again again, I don&#39;t know how\n&gt; the original \n&gt; poster really meant the question either - so I might\n&gt; be the only one \n&gt; here who sees this my way (wouldn&#39;t be the first\n&gt; time....)\n\nThe original poster specifically asked if there was a\ncorrelation to the modern military rank structure, and\nspecifically mentioned US military ranks. There&#39;s no\nother way to answer his/her question--the answer is\nno. While there was obviously gradation in the\nimportance of jobs, etc., there were no military\nranks. Pure and simple. You can&#39;t even use\ntranslations of the words the Japanese used, because\nas has been said, General (Taisho) A may command 300\ntroops, whereas General B commands 30,000. \n \n&gt; Absolutely agreed - believe me. However, the round\n&gt; modern military \n&gt; hole is not the one and only way to understand the\n&gt; word &quot;rank&quot;, \n&gt; either.\n\nIn the context of the question, yes it is. If we were\ntalking social rank, or &quot;importance&quot;, then yes, that\nchanges things. But the poster asked if there were\nmilitary ranks ala the modern system. The answer is\nno. While a taisho may &quot;outrank&quot; an ashigaru, that\nmakes neither &quot;taisho&quot; or &quot;ashigaru&quot; a rank. If you&#39;re\nan assembly line worker, someone in corporate\nmanagement obviously &quot;outranks&quot; you in the context of\nyour company. However, your &quot;rank&quot; isn&#39;t Factory\nWorker, and his isn&#39;t &quot;Middle Manager&quot;. Those are\njobs--one is &quot;higher&quot; than the other, but they aren&#39;t\nranks. \n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!
