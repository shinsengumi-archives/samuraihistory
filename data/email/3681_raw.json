I am writing yet another paper on the Meiji \nRestoration for my grad class. These papers (4-6 pages) are usually to \nbe written in 4 days, and are real killers, since there is technically \nno time to double and triple check one&#39;s sources. (we usually read \n3-400 pages per paper) I usually exchange them with some of my \nclassmates the day before they&#39;re due, but rarely get a real input.\n\nWell, since in this mailing list there are so many competent people, I \nwas thinking that maybe somebody ***MIGHT*** want to read the final \ndraft of my papers, and point out to eventual mistakes. More over, I \nsuppose I am not the only student here, so it would be cool if others \nas well would exchange papers and we could help each other, while \nlearning something new.\n\nWell, my paper is due on Tuesday... let me know here or in private if \nyou have the time and the will to check it... Or should I simply send \nit like a post, and the willing can criticize it. That would be... \nouch... but... why not??\nThanks and ban-banzai.\ncepo\n\nPS = Professor Tony and other faculty on the list... This would be \nacademically acceptable, right? I mean, I am not asking people to write \nmy papers, just to give an opinion on them...\n\n\n"
