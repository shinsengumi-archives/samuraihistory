The  rise of daimyo is associated with =\r\nthe &quot;Sengoku&quot; civil war period. Daimyo were samurai and did indeed fight, a=\r\nt least until there was a lasting peace that started in 1615.\n   \n  -Weapon=\r\ns used were primarily the bow and arrow, the spear, and the naginata-- whic=\r\nh was a curved sword blade mounted on a spear pole. Swords were used as a w=\r\neapon of last resort on the battlefield. The use of guns spread very rapidl=\r\ny in Japan during the mid 1550s and rapidly changed the way battles were fo=\r\nught as they revolutionized warfare.Training began at a young age for samur=\r\nai.\n   \n  -Confucian influence on samurai culture was not particularly stro=\r\nng until the Edo period- which was from 1600 to 1868. During this time peri=\r\nod, the Tokugawa shogunate encouraged the samurai class to study Confuciani=\r\nsm.\n   \n  These are very shallow answers to your questions. I suggest that =\r\nyou see if your school or public libraries have any books by Stephen Turnbu=\r\nll on samurai history. His books will help you.\n   \n  Good luck!\n   \n  shan=\r\nnon fenella &lt;shannon_fenella@...&gt; wrote:\n          hello,\nfor a pro=\r\nject on school I am making a survey about the samurai. I have some question=\r\ns:\n- whenn the shoguns ruled japan there was no emperor, was there?\n- can s=\r\nomeone tell me something about the training of the samurai? or information =\r\nabout the wapens they used and how?\n- who exactly were the daimyo? As far I=\r\n understand they were the lords of the samurai, but did the daymio fight al=\r\nso?\n- I would like to know something about the influence of confucius on th=\r\ne life of the samurai.\nthanks in advance.\n\nregards,\nshannon\n\n______________=\r\n____________________________________________\nLive.nl: je eigen persoonlijk =\r\nstartpagina met nieuws en feeds die JIJ belangrijk vindt!\nhttp://www.live.c=\r\nom/getstarted.aspx\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n=\r\n\n\n                         \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a=\r\n better sports nut!
