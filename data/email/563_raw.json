What?\n\n--- Todd Archer &lt;todda39@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, Folks.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking for some scholarly opinion on the\n&gt; secondary source, &quot;Secrets of \n&gt; the Samurai&quot; by Ratti and Westbrook.  A google\n&gt; search brought to my \n&gt; attention lots of positive reviews and mentions from\n&gt; bookstores and people \n&gt; who seem to be students of various martial arts, but\n&gt; not from any source I \n&gt; would consider authoritative on the subject of\n&gt; Japanese cultural history; I \n&gt; could find no academic reviews.  While the book has\n&gt; a fairly large \n&gt; bibliography as I recall, and does mention, I think,\n&gt; something called the \n&gt; Historia Nipponica in the credits, I don&#39;t remember\n&gt; seeing any footnotes, \n&gt; page references to other sources, or endnotes; this\n&gt; lack set off a warning \n&gt; bell.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, does anyone here know anything about how well\n&gt; received this work is by \n&gt; historians and scholars?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any advice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Todd\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print\n&gt; your photos: \n&gt; http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
