Modern martial arts, while having some \nsimilarities and borrowing from each other at times in terms of \norganization (belt ranking systems, etc), are all different and the \n&#39;meaning&#39; behind any particular custom is likely different depending \nupon the received tradition.\n\nShannon\n\n\n\n\n\n"
