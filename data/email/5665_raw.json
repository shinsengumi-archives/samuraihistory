This\nvery interesting.\n \nThanks, it helps a lot!\n\nRichardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\nHI\n\nhere is a brief description. I wont go into details to\nmuch as I assume you are not a member of either ryu.\n\nkukishinden Ryu (KSDR) Kodachi has only 3 kata for the\nuse of the kodachi. Once source I know may try to say\nthere are a further 7 ura gata for these 3 omote gata,\nbut i have seen a Kukishin ryu densho and no ura gata\nwere listed in it.\n\nIn each one the attacker will come at you with a\nkatana and he is trying to cut across at your torso.\nThe reason for this is you are moving around him and\nyou decide when to expose a weak point therefore\nmaking him attack the area you choose. Once he does in\nall three you rush in fast and thrust the kodachi into\nhim.\n\nIn Hon Tai Yoshin Ryu (HYR), I have not studied. I\nhave been shown the kata once and I have them on\nvideo. therefore cant describe them properly.\n\nThere are five omote kata and I am told maybe some ura\ngata (which I have not seen or know of). They like the\nKuki kodachi involve thrusting and a few slashing such\nas to the neck or torso.\n\nThe HYR tend to sink lower in kamae than the KSDR.\n\nHowever there is a historical link between the two\nryu.\n\nKukishinden Ryu is really called Kukishinden Happo\nBiken, and originates from Kukishin ryu (main branch\nof that is now Kukishinden Tenshin Hyoho) This all\noriginates from the Kuki family who are today still\nsoke of the tenshin hyoho branch, and also head\npriests of the Kuki shrine. IN the 1600s Ohkuni Onihei\nwas a shihan in the Kukishin ryu and met with Takagi\nGennoshin from Takagi Yoshin ryu. together they\nexchanged ideas etc and Takagi Yoshin ryu was changed.\nKukishin ryu Bojutsu was added to Takagi. In the early\n1900&#39;s Ishitani (Ishiya) sensei on his death bed\nhanded menkyo kaiden makimono for the Takagi Yoshin\nryu to Takamatsu Toshitsugu, they were to be passed to\nKakuno one of his students. Both Kakuno and Takamatsu\nheld menkyo Kaiden in Takagi Yoshin Ryu and kukishin\nRyu. sort time later Minaki sensei is handed menkyo\nkaiden in the kakuno takagi ryu and from him him the\nHYR is developed.\n\nfor more indepth info and lines history check out\nthese sites.\n\nhttp://www.hontaiyoshinryu.com/\nhttp://www.hyrusa.com/index2.html\nhttp://www.shinjin.co.jp/kuki/hyoho/index_e.html\nhttp://kobe.cool.ne.jp/ikkansai/takagiryu.htm\nhttp://www.hanako.co.uk/History.htm  (my web site)\n\npaul\n\n\n\n--- andrea Smith &lt;andjoysmith@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nwhat&#39;s the difference between the Kukishinden Ryu\nKodachi and the Hon Tai Yoshin Ryu Kodachi?
