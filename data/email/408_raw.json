BAKER,\n\nThank you.\n\nEven after I bite your head off, (which you apologised for provoking anyway out of a good heart, even though you were not wrong in\nthe first place), you then stand up for me.\nYou are a very kind person, and I am sorry to you for any insult that I made to you, ever.\nWhether you were wrong or not is not the case as you were not wrong to express your opinion in the first place and meant no offence\nanyway.\nTherefore I was wrong and apologise to you.\n\nKumo.\n\nNatsu-gusa ya\nTsuamono-domo ga\nyume no ato\n\n- Basho Matsuo.\n  (1644 - 1694)\n\n---------------------------\nTO: MR. FRAZIER\n\nRead between your paragraphs for responses:\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Alexander M. Frazier\n\n&gt; KUMO ...\n\n&gt; Are you ten years old?\n\n* What is wrong with ten year olds?\n\n&gt; If you disagree with someone, so be it, but that was the rudest display of adolescent behavior I have seen in a very long time.\n&gt; Show some respect.\n&gt; People from various martial arts are passed verbal transmissions of their &quot;history&quot; and the reasons for various traditions\n&gt; revolving around that art.\n&gt; As mentioned in this diatribe, I am a student of Aikido. Daito ryu more specifically. In our art, the hakama is gifted to a\n&gt; shodan. It is believed by our shihan that the hakama was worn for both ceremony and ease of movement for combat in an &quot;in-house&quot;\n&gt; circumstance. In another art there may have been different traditions or circumstances surrounding its use.\n\n* Who questioned another ryu&#39;s use of the Hakama? NO-ONE.\n\n&gt; However, regardless of any one teaching, you must consider the fact that the hakama was Japanese\n\n* Who said that the Hakama wasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t Japanese? NO-ONE.\n\n&gt; not the tool of martial arts.\n\n* And how do you then account for it&#39;s additional and specific uses in the arts?\n* It is in fact BOTH, Japanese and a TOOL of the arts.\n* You seem to have missed this.\n\n&gt; It was worn by practitioners and &quot;lay&quot; folk alike.\n\n* Who said that it wasn&#39;t worn by many kinds of people? NO-ONE.\n\n&gt; Martial arts all stemmed from India and developed into numerous styles over many generations throughout all of the orient, taking\n&gt; on various characteristics by each major clan and teacher. The hakama was just a garment that simply followed the Japanese during\n&gt; their day, and when one clan broke from another ... or one family divided and became two ... when they moved on they took their\n&gt; hakamas with them. Perhaps after the fact each determined that it had certain combative attributes. Who can truly say?\n\n* Hmmmmm, I don&#39;t know..... maybe the GRAND MASTERS?\n\n&gt; I know that YOU weren&#39;t there any more than Eric was, so certainly you can&#39;t answer the question with any more authority than he\n&gt; could.\n\n* Who questioned Mr. Baker&#39;s authority on the use of the Hakama? NO-ONE.\n\n&gt; In any case, people have different reasons for the things they think and believe, and not all of it is rootless. Unless YOU\n&gt; are the expert on all these matters, which I do not believe you are, try to have a little sensitivity in rebuking information you\n&gt; BELIEVE is incorrect.\n\n* Next time you feel the need to go on, ...and on, ...and on about things that you have no clue about, Don&#39;t. Supress the need to BE\n* WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING IN YOUR E-MAIL THAT YOU ACCUSE ME OF.\n\n* Included is a copy of my e-mail to Mr. Baker. Please re-read it, as you paid no attention to it last time, and must have been\n* looking slightly off-screen while typing, looking at the television or something.\n* THEN, when you understand what I was expressing, please e-mail me privately, because I would hope that you do not\n* enjoy embarrassing yourself any more than you have on this matter.\n\n&gt; Alex\n\n* AGAIN, THIS IS THE LAST ON THIS MATTER. YOU SEEMED TO HAVE MISSSED THAT LAST TIME.\n* AND MY INVITATION TO E-MAIL ME PRIVATELY.\n* IT IS HOPED THAT IN CAPS IT WILL BE HARDER TO OVERLOOK THIS TIME.\n\nKumo.\n\nNatsu-gusa ya\nTsuamono-domo ga\nyume no ato\n\n- Basho Matsuo.\n  (1644 - 1694)\n\nFlollowing is my e-mail to Mr. Baker.\n=========================\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: KUM0\nSubject: The ignorant\n\n* Mr. Baker,\n\n&gt; I am sorry\n\n* Do not be sorry, for you cannot change. And would not where it even for the better.\n\n&gt; but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years of my life.\n\n* A commendable time spent learning. Kudos.\n\n&gt; I have to disagree.  There are all kinds of ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise movement or position.  This is simply not\n&gt; true.\n\n* Did you invent the Hakama and devise it&#39;s uses? I believe that you didn&#39;t. You only know of it&#39;s uses inside Budo as you learn it,\n* and are in no position to comment on any other arts uses of the hakama.\n\n&gt; The Samurai when going in to combat without armor preffered to were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.\n\n* As does anybody with an ounce of common sense.\n\n&gt; This allowed full movement without tripping on the hakama itself.(anyone who practices Aikido has had this happen)\n\n* I agree. This I have seen for myself.\n\n&gt; When wearing armor they didn&#39;t even wear\n&gt; hakama so it did not apply.\n\n* However, I don&#39;t believe that this paragraph has anything atall to do with the subject matter being discussed.\n\n&gt; The Word &quot;ninja&quot; is not hstorically correct and neither is their movie incarnation.  They were usually reffered to as Shinobi and\n&gt; originally were not as specialized as the movies make them appear.\n&gt; They were used to set fire to enemy encampments and castles in order to cause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they would be employed\n&gt; to kill.  But I have heard of very few if any cases with the latter.  A good book on the subject of the origin and truths behind\nthe\n&gt; &quot;Ninja&quot; is Stephen Turnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold of and has to be ordered from Europe but is worth the\n&gt; price.\n&gt; There are alot of myths regarding the history of the Martial arts.(Ninja Especially)\n\n* Who mentioned movies? Who mentioned historically correct details regarding the ninja? How would you be an authority on the ninja?\n* You study Budo by your own admission. It is very rude by every cultures beliefs to denounce that of which you are ignorant.\n\n* And ignorant of such matters you are.\n\n* Whether the term &quot;Ninja&quot; appeared in Japan  _ever_  is no matter. Nowdays it is an accepted layman&#39;s term. Whether you like it or\n* not. And the world will use it without you.\n\n* I have respect for the way of Bu, but not for you, because you are ignorant, and have no respect for anything but your own\n* &quot;knowledge&quot;. Of which you probably know nothing outside of Budo teachings, and the odd bit of book reading here or there by\nauthors\n* who are also no authority on the subjects which they publish books on.\n\n* That is my last comment on the matter on the list, if you wish to comment youself, which you no doubt would accept to do without\n* thought, then you have my e-mail address and have my invitation to mail me personally for any reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
