So,\nthey was not betrayed their own lord, but the land, the way of their\nancestors and the way of the Samurai in itself.\n\nJust to be born with samurai ancestry and know how to handle a sword does\nnot make anyone a Samurai.\n\nMuch of the samurai &quot;way-of-thinking&quot; is from Buddhism and Shintoism (or\nShind� that means &quot;The Way of the Gods&quot;).\n\nChristians should search in history to real sources to seek for their pride\ninstead of borrowing elements of other cultures and put in them the seal of\ntheir god. Unfortunatelly there is so much people-like-hitler in\nChristianism, just like Hitler himself (&quot;I am now as before a Catholic and\nwill always remain so&quot; Adolph Hitler, 1941), Charles Magne (killed more than\n4000 saxons for refusal to convert to christianism), Olaf the Holy and Olaf\nTryggvarsson (of Norway, they also did thousands of sword-pointed\nconvertions and prosecuted their native religions there that have several\ncommon elements with Shinto), Oda Nobunaga Shogun (killed many buddhist\nmonks, destroyed many buddhists monasteries and entire villages and their\nrespectives villagers slaughtered just for dwelling near those monasteries)\nand very few good and coherent examples like St. Francisco of Assis (his\norder in some periods of history was even prosecuted due to that).\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP\n\n\n&gt; Message: 1\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 27 Jan 2004 11:43:09 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;    From: jacob gerhard &lt;madbearscave@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Hi!\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Carmen,\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are some prominant Christian Samurai that I know\n&gt; of:\n&gt; Otomo Sorin\n&gt; Kuroda Yoshitaka\n&gt; Arima Harunobu\n&gt;\n&gt; Also check out the Shimabara Rebelion 1637-1638\n&gt;\n&gt; Also though there may have been Christain Samurai,\n&gt; Christianity was viewed as a potential threat(foreign\n&gt; powers namely the Portuguese) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi\n&gt; and the Tokugawa Shogunate. Their crack down on\n&gt; christianity wasn&#39;t so much hatred toward christains\n&gt; as much as eliminating a disruptive force. The\n&gt; samurai(Oda Nobunaga) also cracked down on the Buddist\n&gt; Ikko Sect for the same reasons.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jake\n&gt; --- Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Carmen et al-\n&gt; &gt; If christians have lots to learn from Samurai, then\n&gt; &gt; I would suggest\n&gt; &gt; they could learn it ALL from Christian Samurai. I\n&gt; &gt; would examine the\n&gt; &gt; history of christianity in Kyushu and the lives of\n&gt; &gt; the Christian\n&gt; &gt; Daimyo, sounds like a natural subject for your\n&gt; &gt; interests...\n&gt; &gt; -t\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"
