If you&#39;re in Osaka, a visit to\nthe Osaka-jo is well worth a visit .  The castle\nitself is a twentieth reconstruction but the\nexhibitions regarding the city&#39;s medieval history, and\nin particular the camapaigns of 1615, are excellent .\nKyoto is another obvious choice as history lurks\naround most corners, and a trip to Fukuoka could\ninclude visits to sights related to the Mongols&#39;\nattempted invasions of the latter thirteenth century .\nI hope you have as good a time in Japan as I do .\nMichael Lorimer .\n\n\n"
