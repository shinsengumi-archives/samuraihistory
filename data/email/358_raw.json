So\nfar your the only one thats made sense. One guy told me that all peoples in\njapan wore them, or the variations of them. I&#39;ve seen many movies where they\ndidn&#39;t wear hakama. For instance Seven Samurai....Akira Kurisawa was a\nperfectionist he wanted everything accurate so I&#39;m inclined to think they\ndidn&#39;t all have to wear them. But I needed some second oppinions on the\nmatter. Thanks a bunch.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;erik baker&quot; &lt;musashieb@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, November 20, 2001 11:24 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Concerning Samurai clothing\n\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; Hakama were never formalized into a must wear\n&gt; necessity.  There were different forms of hakama that\n&gt; were worn  at different times.  There was even a long\n&gt; version worn in the shoguns palace during the edo\n&gt; period that were very hard to move around in.  During\n&gt; the summer some samurai would wear kimono or a shorter\n&gt; version of the hakama.  These were common to foot\n&gt; soldiers in the summer.  For very formal occassions\n&gt; during the late sengoku jidai and the tokugawa/edo\n&gt; period they would wear something called kamishimo\n&gt; which was essentially a hakama and a stiff shouldered\n&gt; top that covered there kimono or whatever particular\n&gt; shirt they were wearing.  These could be formalized\n&gt; for a particular daimyo and or family.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this is helpful\n&gt;\n&gt; Musashi\n&gt; --- oblivion@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I would like to know if samurai had to wear Hakama\n&gt; &gt; or was it by rank\n&gt; &gt; or preference? Or was it so that if they didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; follow bushido then\n&gt; &gt; they didn&#39;t wear them?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
