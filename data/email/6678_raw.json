It has the old style string binding, and the paper \nis very thin, but remarkably strong for such thin paper.  It *feels* \nold...\n\nWould anyone here who can read Japanese be willing to let me mail \nthem some color photocopies of some of the relevant pages of this \nthing and see if they can date it?  I don&#39;t have access to a scanner, \nor I would do it that way....\n\nMany thanks,\n\nTrace\n\n\n\n\n"
