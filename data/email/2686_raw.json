Let&#39;s put it this way,\n\n&quot;Some Samurai followed Bushido, but Bushido was not followed by all \nSamurai.  You follow Bushido.  That does not make you a Samurai.&quot;\n\nWe&#39;ll even ignore the fact that &#39;Samurai&#39; was a social class, and \nnot a product of Bushido, but Bushido was a product of a few Samurai \nwith nothing better to do than justify their lecherous existence \nduring the Edo period, and then gathered a following because it made \nthem look honorable and useful.\n\nI&#39;m surprised that you think this way if you&#39;ve been to Japan, as \nyou should know that any remnants of bushido are long, long gone in \nthat society, and I Gaijin attempting to play Samurai would be \nthought a moron at best.\n\n&gt; ....a great lot about samurai, weapons, and ancient japan. I \nmyself, \n&gt; follow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real life Samurai, \nthough \n&gt; Samurai&#39;s have been outlawed since the late 1800&#39;s, I still \nconsider \n&gt; myself one.\n\n\n"
