I&#39;ll admit it--you?\nIt&#39;s why I&#39;ve been killing myself putting together a\npresentation for work--actually, 2. I&#39;m tired of\nhearing soldiers say the north Koreans have x tank or\ny vehicle when they DON&#39;T. So I&#39;ve put together the\nmother of all north Korean and south Korean vehicle ID\nclasses, with about 250 slides each. It&#39;s sick. My\nlieutenant thinks I&#39;m obsessed. I probably am. But\nit&#39;s because people keep getting things WRONG...and\nI&#39;m sick of it.\n\nNate\n\n--- &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Eponymous13@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hey there.\n&gt; &gt;        This may sound like dumb question, but AS A\n&gt; WORK OF FICTION, is Shogun\n&gt; &gt; any good?  Or is it a mire of a story like I found\n&gt; Tale of the Heike to be?\n&gt; &gt; Just wondering, b/c I&#39;m thinking of reading it. \n&gt; (And yes, I am planning to\n&gt; &gt; give Tale another honest try someday, just not\n&gt; right now.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It depends on what you consider to be &quot;fiction.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; To me, it fails greatly in the historical accuracy,\n&gt; historical verisimilitude, and linguistic accuracy\n&gt; (etc.) tests.\n&gt; To some people, that&#39;s not a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me give you an example. In the current issue of\n&gt; Hitchcock Magazine, there&#39;s a &quot;Heian period&quot; murder\n&gt; mystery. It&#39;s\n&gt; set in the eleventh century. Except I recognize the\n&gt; Japanese story used as the basis for it -- a story\n&gt; that took\n&gt; place a century later (because there was a war that\n&gt; figured in the background, and one of the characters\n&gt; is\n&gt; historical). I also recognized that the author made\n&gt; some anachronisms with names (using a very late\n&gt; period name for a\n&gt; woman character in the story). I was also thrown off\n&gt; because of mentions of cotton clothing and candles,\n&gt; neither of\n&gt; which existed in Japan during the  Heian period.\n&gt; So.... is that a good story? To some, yes. To me,\n&gt; no. There was too\n&gt; much wrong with it that kept throwing me *out* of\n&gt; the story.\n&gt; \n&gt; Like some people stop reading detective fiction\n&gt; where someone puts a silencer on a revolver. Or\n&gt; removes &quot;the clip&quot;\n&gt; from a revolver. Both of which I see often -- it\n&gt; means the writer really doesn&#39;t know guns, and\n&gt; hasn&#39;t done the\n&gt; research -- it makes me wonder what else might be\n&gt; wrong that I *don&#39;t* know about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
