It really does.  It is basically a site \nselling minatures of the samurai in 54mm scale, this in itself may be \ninteresting to some, but it is the detail and depth that the \nminatures go to that makes it so good.  The armies of Tokugawa Ieyasu \nand the Mori clan are portrayed also Ii Naomasa (1561-1602) Red \ndevils (Not manchester united, but a crack cavalry unit wearing red \narmour.  All the figures have correct Monsho and Sashimono \nBackbanners, and sword positions, they even have the 47 ronin.  It is \nhowever obvious that there is a catch the catch is they are damn \nexpensive too much for the likes of me approx 30 Usd each and 60 for \na cavalry model.  So only for connosiuers really.  But the site is \nworth checking out for it&#39;s photo&#39;s of the various samurai and \nhistorical context.  Personally I used to collect minatures but gave \nit up about 12 years ago as to cost and also I was growing out of it, \nseeing this I have been severley tempted to start up this hobby \nagain, but with more of a historical sway, I would like to collect a \nfull samurai army of the Hosokawa clan, Date, Mogami, I could go on, \nbut I won&#39;t, so check out the site to see what I am talking about \nhope you lot like it, message me back with comments.  Also I agree \nwith the last comments about the royal armouries at Leeds it is \nexcellent, I met Ian Bottomly the curator of the oriental gallery and \nsaw some behind the scenes armour for a university archaelogy \nproject, he is an expert on Japan check out his book samurai arms and \narmour and he changed my view on the Bushi for ever, Turnbull has \nsuch a rosy view sometimes.  I saw a helmet with rabbit ears the \nbizzarist coolist, thing I have ever seen to do with samurai.  Anyway \ncheck out that website you won&#39;t regret anything but the price.   \n\nAll the best Mark \n\n\n"
