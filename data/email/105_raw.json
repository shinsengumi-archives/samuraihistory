It&#39;s hard to find \n&gt; anything here at Fort Knox, KY, even though it is the US home of \n&gt; Cavalry and Armor...lots about European cavalry, but nothing about \n&gt; Japan other than the Takeda &quot;cavalry charge&quot; at Nagashino, which is \n&gt; always written about too simply. As I am sure you all know, it&#39;s hard \n&gt; to find anything beyond introductory level stuff in English. Nihongo \n&gt; ga dekimasu ga, Japanese resources aren&#39;t really available in \n&gt; Kentucky. Thanks for the help.\n\n\nDid you take a look at Farris&#39; HEAVENLY WARRIORS  and the references he \ncites there?  Farris is at Univ. of Tenn. at Knoxville; they may or may not\nhave a good collection of Japanese works.  Have you also tried the University\nof Kentucky and their Japanese studies center?\n\nBest, Mark Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n"
