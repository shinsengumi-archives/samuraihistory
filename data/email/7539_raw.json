I have some of his books.  Along with many others..  but it is hard to fit \nthem all on my sailboat; lol so many are in storage.  Hope someone can \nenlighten me on this..  Maybe I am misinformed did not Mr Hayes study in Japan?  \n\n Hope to see some interesting post; yet resepctful at the same time.  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
