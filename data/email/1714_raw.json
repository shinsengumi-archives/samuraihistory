If you see there is a flap on the leather scabbard. If you raise that flap, you can see characters written inside, on the leather. I assume this is the signature of the sword owner.\n\n  Regarding the tsuka and tsuba - I do not know the answers to your doubts about whether they fit together. This sword was brought home to the US at the end of World War II and it is just as you see it. The sword has been on display or in storage all that time - almost 60 years. \n\n  Thank you for your comments and questions.\n\n  Scott  \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Atisi Kazuari \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, May 05, 2003 5:14 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\n\n  In seeing the pictures it is most difinately of the Shin gunto style. \n  Which came into heavy use in WWII when katana became mass \n  produced.Prior to this time(during the meiji era 1867-1920&#39;s) the \n  wearing of them was outlawed all togather. Also before the meiji era \n  katana and wakisashi(Daisho) where worn only by the samurai class.\n\n  Though the meiji era didn&#39;t detur the carring of swords. it was \n  durong this time that we see the rise of the tsueken cane sword. \n  Anyway back to Carlos&#39;sword.( I imagine it to be his as i think he \n  started the thread) it is an interiting peice but somethings about it \n  vex me: Are there characters on the other side of the tang? I was \n  unable to gleen such information from the photo&#39;s. Also where did the \n  tsuka come from? it seems quite athentic but the tsuba doesn&#39;t seem \n  to fit, more the elongated hand guard.\n\n  Hopefully that answered more questions than it posed\n\n  Meisei\n\n  Atsi Kazuri\n\n\n        Yahoo!
