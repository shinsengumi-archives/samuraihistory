By the time Ieyasu declared himself Shogun - \nafter Sekigahara he was in a much stronger position than \nHideyoshi ever enjoyed - there was perhaps only one family in \nJapan who could challenge him. One might ask why Ieyasu did not \nassume the title Kampaku, having emerged from the Council of \nRegents. Perhaps he wanted the whole affair put away.\n\nHad Hideyoshi&#39;s son succeeded him, perhaps the title Kampaku \nwould have eclipsed Shogun - Regent is royal commission, \nwhilst General is a military one - so perhaps Hideyoshi actually \nsaw Kampaku as being a greater appelation than Shogun.\n\nThomas\n\n(ps - like the illustrations!)\n\n\n\n\n"
