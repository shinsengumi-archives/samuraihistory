Also, please forgive my typos made in haste while trying save a \ntruly historic dojo, they are being addressed.\n\nIt is time to fight the man again. Multi million dollar Kodansha publishing \ncompany want to tear down Noma dojo (Tokyo) as it does not suit them to have \na historically important dojo on their grounds. Before the war, Noma dojo \nwas one of the four great dojo of the eastern capital. Now it is the only \nremaining one. It was the site of the last kendo competition that was \nattended by the Emperor, and the dojo of the most famous sensei of the 20th \ncentury Mochida Moriji sensei.\n\nPlease support our opposition to tearing down such a wonderful dojo and \nmemorable experience for visiting kendoka. Here is a link for our petition \nto save Noma dojo.\n\nhttp://www.petitiononline.com/savenoma/petition.html\n\nBest\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n"
