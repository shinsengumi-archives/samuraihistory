Well, anyway I also thought it was a good movie. It was \nquit touching. I went to go see it with my friends when it first came out, \nthey try to act as if they are tough, but when we walked out of the theater they \nwere balling their eyes out. We dont talk about that to this day though. Yeah \nit was a good movie.\n -Matthew Upton\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
