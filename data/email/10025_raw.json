He currently does orders in 20 some odd country&#39;s and I can honestly =\r\nsay that they are top notch. You can find his website here: www.ninedirecti=\r\nons.com tell him Luke recommended him. He will do just about any custome wo=\r\nrk.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dean Wayland &lt;dean@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I run a tiny Japanese historical re-enactment socie=\r\nty here in the UK, \n&gt; and to date all of our weapons have been custom made,=\r\n as the mass \n&gt; produced stuff has simply not been up to standard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thi=\r\ns weekend I was chatting with a chap name Hector Cole, a well known \n&gt; blad=\r\ne smith here in the UK, who is about to make us a batch of authentic \n&gt; arr=\r\nowheads (yanone), when the subject of Yari came up.\n&gt; \n&gt; My original plan w=\r\nas to contact Thom Richardson and Ian Bottomley (Royal \n&gt; Armouries) for ad=\r\nvice, diagrams and photo&#39;s for Hector to work from, but \n&gt; I decided to do =\r\na Google search first.\n&gt; \n&gt; I found that Hanwei (Paul Chen) now offer two Y=\r\nari, one with a longer \n&gt; blade, but plain fittings, and the other shorter,=\r\n but with rattan \n&gt; bindings. Can anyone advise me as to the pro&#39;s, con&#39;s a=\r\nnd quality of \n&gt; these yari? Are they worth considering or are they better =\r\navoided?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the US source:\n&gt; http://www.casiberia.com/product_deta=\r\nils.asp?id=3DSH2312\n&gt; \n&gt; In the past nothing I&#39;ve seen from these folks has=\r\n peaked my interest, \n&gt; until now. I confess that due to design and quality=\r\n issues I&#39;ve not \n&gt; looked at their stuff for years, but I&#39;d be happy to be=\r\n pleasantly \n&gt; surprised.\n&gt; \n&gt; Price wise I&#39;ve seen these Yari on sale via =\r\nUK websites from 230 - 450 \n&gt; GB pounds. So, does anyone know of a good UK =\r\nsupplier, just in case?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours\n&gt; \n&gt; Dean\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt; Head=\r\n Of The Fight School\n&gt; http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
