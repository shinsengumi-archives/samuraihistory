Apparently Kenshin not only killed the\nsoldier but\ncut his mat=\r\nchlock barrel so well that the sword was named as such.  I\nrecall the\nsword=\r\n was an O-Kanehira??  So a gun barrel has been cut in at least one\ndocument=\r\ned historical event.  If the gun was an &quot;udon-ju&quot; this is more\neasily\naccep=\r\nted than a WW2 machine gun barrel...\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n=\r\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: David Heller &lt;olasnah@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sa=\r\nmuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 14, 2004 2:36 PM\nSub=\r\nject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Slicing rifle barrels\n\n\nI actually grabbed a=\r\n screenshot of the movie at that precise moment, and\nthe\nbreakage of the ri=\r\nfle does in fact occur behind the action of the rifle,\nso no\nbarrel was sli=\r\nced.\n\nJames Eckman &lt;ronin_engineer@...&gt; wrote:I think this is the\ne=\r\nquivalent\nof an urban legend more than anything\nelse, looks cool in movies =\r\nbut may never have happened.
