I have looked at them. Look very good for practicality and looks.\n \nRobert\n\nAnthony Escobar &lt;kondo_isami@...&gt; wrote:\nI for one am a big sword collector. My opinion however on Paul Chen is that yes he makes alright practical katana, but there are swords out there a hell of alot better. I\nrecently bought a new iaito as i do study iaido, but that was about an $800 sword.\nIt really depends on what you want to do with it. You also have to consider your budget\nas they can get extremely pricey. So if you&#39;re looking for something to cut with, you&#39;ll \nwant to get a live blade. If you are intersted in Iaido or just a decorative item, you might \nget an iaito. Regardless of what purpose you&#39;re getting it for, you will be spending alot.\nAs for practical blades, yes Paul Chen has some good ones, but Pual Chen isn&#39;t very\nauthentic. I myself have had 2 Paul Chen blades for Tameshigiri (rice straw cutting) and \nI wasn&#39;t very impressed or satisfied. Not to mention that one of them came with scratches \nalready imbeded in the blade. So try to stear clear of those; to expensive for crap. But if you&#39;re looking for a good practical katana, or even an iaito, go to www.swordstore.com,\nwww.bugei.com, www.samurai-store.com, and www.tozando.com. Bottom line, you&#39;re not \ngoing to get even a decent sword for under $250. Well good luck! \n\nRobert Birker &lt;snipersergeant2000@...&gt; wrote:\nwww.888knivesrus.com The best I&#39;ve seen.  Paul Chen swords are sold there and Paul Chen is very good for quality and authenticy.  Just my opinion.\n\nRobert\n\nzevlord &lt;LordZev@...&gt; wrote:\n\nHi all,\n\nAs you all know there are quite a few sites selling sword on the net. \nI am looking at purchasing a set of swords from a reputable supplier. \nSo would like to ask you guys who have purchased your own sword/s \nwhere you got them from and if you would recommend that supplier. If \nyou could tell me what type of sword/s you purchased, the cost (using \nUS currency) and the website if they have one, that would help me \nalot. Thank you in advance   \n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
