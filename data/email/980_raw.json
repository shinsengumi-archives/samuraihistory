I&#39;ve read it a few times \nbecause its written in a way that I think is some what difficult to under \nstand the first time you read it, but each time I read it I get more and \nmore out of it. Its about the tactics of war, both small scale (fencing) and \nlarge scale (battle field) tactics, he thinks of both large and small as \nsort of the same thing, the same basic tactics are used in both aspects of \nwar.\n\nI think it�s a great book, I&#39;ve only read it as an HTML document\nHere�s the URL in case you want it...\nhttp://www.samurai.com/5rings/\n\nI have a question for you guys on the forum.\nMany people say Miyamoto Musashi �invented� the use of both Katana and \nWakizashi at the same time, but if this is true, how come we learn this \ntechnique in Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu, a Ryuha that was founded by \nIizasa Choisai Ienao in ca. 1447?\n\nAny incite are greatly appreciated.\n\n\nMarius.\n\nPS: I�m also Norwegian, where in Norway are you located? Do you study any \nform of Japanese war art? I study Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu in Oslo \nits very interesting and fun.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;From: Tobias A Heiberg &lt;tobiasaheiberg@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] (unknown)\n&gt;Date: Tue, 23 Jul 2002 08:09:32 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hello All.\n&gt;\n&gt;I am new to this group. I am reading, now for the fifth time I think, \n&gt;&quot;hagakure&quot; wich I love. Such harch poetry and wisdom of life! And a window \n&gt;ino a time and an uncompromising way of thinking wich fasinates me so.The \n&gt;historical references are important too, but I&#39;m not so much into the facts \n&gt;and the numbers themselves. I also love the &quot;Lone Wolf And Cub&quot; - series. \n&gt;And now I am looking fore something more to read.......I am not looking for \n&gt;something purely on factual history. I want something genuine, but focused \n&gt;maybe on the filosophy,ethics, ore tactics and arts of war of samuray and \n&gt;great Samuray minds. Oh..and I don&#39;t read Japanese.\n&gt;\n&gt;Demanding, no? I am Norvegian, and things like this are IMPOSSIBLE to come \n&gt;by here so I have to buy per mail or e-mail wich is fine, but It makes me \n&gt;unnable to check what I am buying before I pay.......so I hope someone has \n&gt;a good tip for me.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thank&#39;s\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
