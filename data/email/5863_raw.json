(Tony?\n&gt; Nate?  Any comments on this?)  \n\nThe Okinawans were not samurai. Until the 17th century\nthey were more closely tied to China than Japan.\nJapanese influence came mainly through the Shimazu in\nSatsuma, and I hardly think they &quot;promoted&quot; the\nOkinawans to samurai status when they made it a\ntributary state of theirs. \n\nAs for the rest of this, I&#39;m thouroughly confused as\nto who is saying what at this point. When you (not you\nGereg, but some of the other posters in this thread)\nreply to someone, make sure it&#39;s clear where the email\nyou are replying to ends and your comments begin. I\nhaven&#39;t commented for several reasons: a. I can&#39;t tell\nwho&#39;s writing what, even though I approved the\nmessages; b. it&#39;s yet ANOTHER bushido/zen/martial arts\ndiscussion, and I&#39;ve got no interest in it; c. even if\nI did, I&#39;m sure the words of some martial arts sensei\nclaiming karate was founded by Miyamoto Musashi and\nMinamoto Yoshitsune working together would weigh more\nheavily with some of our young practioners than my\npointing out that the two didn&#39;t live in the same\ncentury. \n\nI remember when I was 14, taking Shotokan karate-do as\nhas been brought up in previous posts. I respected my\nsensei as an instructor of karate technique, but even\nat age 14 I had more complete knowledge of Japanese\nhistory and culture. This isn&#39;t a dig on teenagers,\nand I don&#39;t know if the posters in this thread are or\nare not. It doesn&#39;t matter. Whether you are 14 or 40,\nyou have to invesitgate and question, even if the info\ncomes from your sensei. Shotokan Karate is JAPANESE,\nyes, as opposed to Okinawan. It was developed in Tokyo\nby Gichin Funakoshi. However, it does draw from\nOkinawan karate, and technique wise is closely\nrelated. Master Funakoshi was alive in the late 19th\nand early 20th centuries. While he may or may not have\nwished to include &quot;Zen&quot; or &quot;Bushido&quot;, it was hardly a\n&quot;samurai art&quot;. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nCheck out the new Yahoo!
