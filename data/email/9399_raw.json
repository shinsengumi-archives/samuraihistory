Im not sure if that was broken into three seperate volumes or not. I know the Japanese translation is something like 12 volumes. \n\nI have the book information from Amazon UK, but that&#39;s about as far as I got... If you translate this, you may want to publish it as it would be a very time-consuming process. However, if you want to undertake something like that, Im sure the English-speaking community would be quite impressed :)\n\n   Publisher: Presid&#234;ncia do Conselho de Ministros, Secretaria de Estado da Cultura, Direc&#231;&#227;o-Geral do Patrim&#243;nio Cultural, Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa (1976)\n   ASIN: B0000D5WCI\nJonathan P Ellgen\n\n\nThomas Schmidt &lt;largethomassails@...&gt; wrote:                                  I might be able to translate, if you found a copy.\n Cheers\n Thomas\n \n jonathan ellgen wrote:\n &gt; I have a question... Perhaps you guys can point me in the right direction. \n &gt;\n &gt; I was wondering if anyone is aware of any translations of Luis Frois&#39; Historia de Japam. I believe it was partially translated into German at one point. My German skills havent been used since college, so that doesn&#39;t help me.
