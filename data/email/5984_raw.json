I know u r not\n&gt; like the smartest people in the world but a lil\n&gt; common sense and compassion. Gee wizz if u that\n&gt; smart u should have known what i ment.\n\nHuh? What are you talking about?\n\n i dont want\n&gt; to make enimies or nothing but last i checked this\n&gt; was a fun and INFORMAL post. i mean through\n&gt; conversation there is somthing like the meaning\n&gt; being understood. if i were talking to u would i\n&gt; constantly have to say ur name over and over no. i\n&gt; really enjoy the post here and i rarely reply just\n&gt; enjoy the information being exchanged. but to see u\n&gt; pick on something as simple as that made me upset. \n\nAs simple as what? You haven&#39;t clarified what you are\ntalking about. What do you think we were picking on?\nDo you think we were picking on you? I certainly\ndidn&#39;t think so--generally when I pick on someone,\nthey know it. \n\ni\n&gt; mean if u study a bit just a lil of Karate\n&gt; truthfully u had a dojo kun. the very first of it\n&gt; was to seek perfection in character. to seek is to\n&gt; look not that u will ever trully find it. so if u\n&gt; not perfect u should not so loosely be pointing out\n&gt; others imperfections. i am not mad and i know u\n&gt; would like for me to know the correct spelling...\n&gt; hmm GOD BLESS U \n\nLook, I&#39;m not exactly sure why you&#39;re upset, but you\nshouldn&#39;t take anything personally. As far as I can\ntell nothing was directly aimed at you--unless you are\nupset about comments about spelling and grammar. And\nbeing as you still refuse to spell out the word &quot;u&quot; or\nuse capital letters, that can&#39;t be bothering you too\nmuch. \n\nIf you&#39;ve got a specific issue, please email me off\nlist (ltdomer98@...). \n\nNate\n\nManagment, 3rd Class.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
