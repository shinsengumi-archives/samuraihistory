As \nfor Japanese films, they tend to focus on individuals. Films about \nSakamoto Ryoma being in the majority,&#39;Ronin&#39; I think is one of them. \nAlso look for the film Bakumatsu(The Ambitious). In the area of Taiga \ndramas there is a lot more to choose from Ryoma ga yuku, Saigo Takamori \nand Tokugawa Keiki, being some of the recent ones worth watching.\n-t\n\nThere are a lot of great films set in this period, terrific chanbara \nbut they tend to only hint at the politcal situation...\n\n\n"
