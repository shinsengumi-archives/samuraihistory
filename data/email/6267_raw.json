That&#39;s the impression\n&gt; that&#39;s grown on me over\n&gt; the past thirty-some years of practise.  I will\n&gt; admit that it&#39;s an\n&gt; interpretation of available phenomena that is open\n&gt; to argument, but that&#39;s\n&gt; my view.\n\nIf you want to argue that a sword has &quot;spirit&quot; as any\npiece of art would, I&#39;ll buy it. If you tell me your\nsword talks to you, you&#39;re nuts. Sorry. \n\n&gt; \tUntil you&#39;ve been guilt-tripped by a sword that\n&gt; feels neglected, you&#39;ve\n&gt; never been guilt-tripped.  &quot;How&quot; is a very\n&gt; reasonable, but somewhat\n&gt; difficult, question to answer, as the most natural\n&gt; response falls into the\n&gt; &quot;If you have to ask, I can&#39;t explain it&quot; category\n\nAnd here I thought you were better than all the\nwannabe samurai, Gereg...\n\nNate - apostrophising the possessive &quot;its&quot;?  Tsk,\n&gt; tsk. \n\nHave I ONCE ever criticised someone for making one\nmistake? No. Do I consistently do this, to the point\nof sheer idiocy, while everyone pleads with me not to?\nNo. You&#39;re starting to push my buttons, Gereg. \n\n Please bear\n&gt; in mind that while I have seen considerable magic in\n&gt; my life, I do not\n&gt; believe in the supernatural. \n\nAnd yet you believe your sword has a soul. Um...?\n\nGereg, I think you&#39;re an otherwise intelligent human\nbeing. I&#39;ll agree to disagree on this--but to me it\nsounds just as bad as any of the morons who believe\nHagakure and garbage like that. \n\nA sword is a weapon; it can be a work of art. However,\nit&#39;s not born, does not go through adolescence, learn\nto drive, take dates to the prom, or have kids, age,\nand die. IT&#39;S NOT ALIVE. It&#39;s an object. It&#39;s a\nphysical entity, not a spiritual one. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo! Mail - now with 250MB free storage.
