The reason for this being that we could make a\n&gt;barrel out of iron, which for a given weight, can take much higher\n&gt;chamber pressures. So you could use a more potent gun powder mix, which\n&gt;in turn meant that a hand gun would make a far more useful military\n&gt;weapon.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis makes sense.\n\n&gt;Now the first European iron guns were not plug sealed, being fitted with\n&gt;a removable breach held in place by wedges. I&#39;ve been around when one of\n&gt;things has been used, and believe me reliable it is not! \n&gt;\nBeen there, done that, I know too many recreationists who are also gun nuts.\n\n&gt;The European genius was the ability to permanently seal an iron tube,\n&gt;which we did with the creation of the iron &quot;screw&quot; in the 15th century.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nDates about right so your memory is better than mine! Sadly while the \nolder technology history books cover the West in detail, they tend to \ngloss over the East generally with toss off sentences showing a deep \nlack of knowledge. The language barrier along with the instability of \nChina probably plays a big role in this.\n\n&gt;Now the screw has been known for thousands of years, but all previous\n&gt;examples were carved from other softer materials like wood. The early\n&gt;iron and later steel screw had to be pains takingly built up around a\n&gt;core with a &quot;V&quot; sectioned piece of wire or bar. I know a guy who has\n&gt;done it, and it isn&#39;t easy at all. But once you know how.... BOOM!\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis sounds confusing to me. Is it not one piece? Or was it cast? I know \nat a slightly later date that screws were chiseled out or filed to \nshape. Somebody wrote a book on the making the Indian trade gun which I \nbelieve were forged tubes very similar to this.\n\n&gt;Anyway, subject to the vagueries of memory, I hope this was of interest,\n&gt;or at the very least entertaining.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nVery informative, thanks!!\n\nPossible sources to dig up:\nFor &#39;thunderclap fireball&#39; in eastern warfare, S. Turnbull, &#39;Chinese \ninfluence on Japanese siege warfare&#39;, Royal Armouries Yearbook 3 (1998), \npp. 145-58\n\nVarious precursor info:\nHANDGUN - around 1128. &quot;The gun did not appear until the twelfth century \nA.D. For this three things were needed: a metal barrel, gunpowder with a \nhigh nitrate content, and a projectile that neatly filled the barrel so \nthat the powder charge could exert its full propellant effect. Until \nvery recently it was believed that the first Chinese gun ... dated to \nA.D. 1290. Continuing exploration of the Buddhist caves of western China \nhas now revealed a remarkable temple at Ta-tsu in Szechuan Province, \ncontaining evidence that revolutionizes the history of the gun. Among \nthe many reliefs in the cave are two showing gunpowder weapons. One \ndepicts a small demon with two horns cradling a handgun while a second \ndevil holds a grenade. The date of this extraordinary find, according to \nthe inscriptions in the caves, is A.D. 1128.&quot; [James, Peter and Nick \nThorpe. /Ancient Inventions/, 1994.]\n\nGunpowder is thought to have been invented by Chinese alchemists of the \n9th century during their preparation of mixtures of sulfur, charcoal, \nand saltpeter for use as an elixir for immortality. A Taoist book warned \nthat mixing three specific elixir ingredients was too dangerous for \nexperiment: �some have heated together the saltpeter, sulfur, and carbon \nof charcoal with honey; smoke and flames result, so that their hands and \nfaces have been burnt, and even the whole house burnt down.�\n\nThe use of gunpowder for military purposes was first recorded in 919, \nand the first detailed description of using a �firing cannon� in warfare \nwas in connection with a battle fought in 1126 when the Song army used \nit against the invading Nuchens. The Chinese invention of gunpowder \nnever went much beyond its crudest form, and it was abandoned as a \nmilitary weapon shortly afterwards. It reached Japan, Islam, and then \nEurope in the 13th century, and the Arabs improved gunpowder for \nmilitary use. Rockets appear in Arab literature in 1258 as a description \nof their use by Mongol invaders� on February 15 to capture the city of \nBaghdad.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
