Keiji may have been the childhood name for one of Toshiie sons or\nhe maybe complete fiction, no nephews are mentioned. Needless to say it is\nfarfetched to believe that such a character was the lover of the wife of one\nof the most powerful Daimyo ever, to the writers credit if he got caught w/\nToshiie&#39;s wife he would not have lived long and all records of his existence\nwould most certainly have been erased.\n\nKabukimono is deragatory I believe and means a &quot;dandy&quot;, a flashy dresser.\n\nTom\n\n\n"
