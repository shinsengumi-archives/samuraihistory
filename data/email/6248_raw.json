Well, that&#39;s not at all the way I&#39;d describe\n&gt; it, Nate, but I have a\n&gt; sneaking suspicion that you would regard my answer\n&gt; to that question as a\n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot;\n\nThe sword itself--not your practice of the art.\n\t\tStill have to stick with my answer, I&#39;m afraid.  I think there&#39;s a spirit\nin most swords - particularly well-made ones - and I think it becomes more\n&#39;awake&#39; with love and use.  That&#39;s the impression that&#39;s grown on me over\nthe past thirty-some years of practise.  I will admit that it&#39;s an\ninterpretation of available phenomena that is open to argument, but that&#39;s\nmy view.\n\n\n&gt; ...Sure, my swords let me know if they haven&#39;t been\n&gt; used in too long, but\n&gt; it&#39;s not as if they have to be used _on_ somebody.\n\n*cocked eyebrow* Um, and HOW exactly do they do this?\n\tUntil you&#39;ve been guilt-tripped by a sword that feels neglected, you&#39;ve\nnever been guilt-tripped.  &quot;How&quot; is a very reasonable, but somewhat\ndifficult, question to answer, as the most natural response falls into the\n&quot;If you have to ask, I can&#39;t explain it&quot; category - a category that holds so\nmuch specious crap in this world that I really hate to place another datum\ninto it.  Particularly one that I care about.  Let&#39;s just say - until I get\nmy brains back again as I kick this flu - that the spirit of the sword makes\nit very clear to my own spirit that it hasn&#39;t been out dancing in too long.\nNot, to be honest, that I believe that description will convince you:  but\nthere it is.\n\n&gt;       And your point would be...?\n\nYou asked me what my criteria was. Or rather, you were\noffended without knowing the criteria. So I gave it to\nyou.\n\tWell, truth to tell, I didn&#39;t get offended.  (Maybe I should use some of\nthose silly &#39;emoticons&#39; after all... NAAAAH.)  That was my sense of humour,\nsuch as it is, at work.  I regret that you took this aspect of what I had to\nsay even remotely seriously.  Swords have spirits?  Serious.  Offended?\nChallenge you to a duel?  Joke.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I choose Main Battle Tank. Mine&#39;s an M1A2--yours?\n&gt;       Y&#39;know, I had a strong suspicion you were going to\n&gt; take this kind of\n&gt; unsporting attitude.\n\nUnsporting? Not at all. It&#39;s only fair for each of us\nto use something we are trained with, correct? My\nbackground is with tanks. Hence, my choice of weapon.\nUse a sword if you wish. It&#39;s magical soul will\nprotect you from 120mm APFSDS-T, I&#39;m sure.\n\tNate - apostrophising the possessive &quot;its&quot;?  Tsk, tsk.  Now:  having struck\nat you on the battleground of words, allow me to answer you more directly:\nmy swords&#39; spirits I regard as no more &quot;magical&quot; than my own.  (As I recall,\nthe term &#39;kami&#39; can technically be applied to anything possessing a spirit,\nincluding humans and trees:  the idea here is not dissimilar.)  Please bear\nin mind that while I have seen considerable magic in my life, I do not\nbelieve in the supernatural.  I do, however, regard nature as a much bigger\nbox than human science has succeeded in enclosing... or ever will.\n\tAs to protecting me from whatever ammo that is (isn&#39;t it?), I repeat my\ncomplaint about the Boxer Rebellion. Likewise the Amerindians&#39; Ghost Dance.\nI tend to believe that the sheer fact of belief itself has a fair amount of\npower, so that (and I&#39;m oversimplifying grossly here) if a man with a sword\nfaces off with a man with a rifle, and they both believe in the power of\ntheir weapons, the power of each belief tends to cancel out the belief of\nthe other, leaving the functional power of certain forces that do not rely\non belief... or have been believed in for long enough to have established\nmore of a foothold in reality...  I refer here to mundane matters like the\nlaws of physics, muzzle velocity and the kinetic energy inherent in a sharp\npiece of steel swinging.\n\tThere&#39;s an equation in there that I do not fancy.\n\t&quot;Unsporting...&quot;  Well, let&#39;s put that in perspective:  that is the\nfavourite cry of the losing sides in the technology wars throughout history,\nis it not?  The French knights said it about the English longbowmen, the\nlongbowmen said it about harquebusiers (and so did the samurai, for that\nmatter)...  It&#39;s an ancient and well-worn excuse, and I think it&#39;s good for\nanother round or so yet.\n  There&#39;s\n&gt; only one weapon suited for a civilised disagreement\n&gt; between gentlemen:  the\n&gt; sword.  It&#39;s the Mythically Correct solution.\n&gt;       ...Of course, if you&#39;re going to remind me that\n&gt; neither of us could in fact\n&gt; be considered a gentleman under the very definitions\n&gt; I&#39;m calling for (and it\n&gt; would be just like you to do that), then I&#39;ll have\n&gt; no more telling response\n&gt; than to run like hell (unless I can arrange to be\n&gt; closer to you than you are\n&gt; to your M1A2 when our negotiations reach this\n&gt; unhappy stage).\n\nCloser won&#39;t help you--you&#39;d have to know how to start\nthe thing. :)\n\tUm... truth to tell, within the utterly facetious scenario I was\nenvisioning, by positioning myself closer to your chosen weapon than you, I\nhad some hopes of preventing _you_ from starting the damned thing!  Knowing\nnothing whatsoever about your hand-to-hand skills, I&#39;d still rather take you\non with no weapons aside from our bodies... than let you get inside a tank.\nCall it shallow and narrow-minded of me.\n\tUnsporting, even.\n\tGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
