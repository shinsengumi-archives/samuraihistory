The gap \n&gt; between rich and po=\r\nor has never been narrowed since occured in world wide.\n&gt; This is the real =\r\ncause of Terrorism by poorer side against richer side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now , the fello=\r\nw friends of this community must ask what you can do how to \n&gt; settling out=\r\n this terrorism problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eddie Hiramoto\n&gt; \n&gt; nohit@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; And another parallel: In the late 19th century, two different \n&gt; &quot;emanc=\r\nipation proclamations&quot; were made. In the U.S., this was Lincoln&#39;s proclamat=\r\nion to \n&gt; free African-American slaves. In Japan, it was the Meiji governme=\r\nnt&#39;s \n&gt; proclamation to end the feudal outcaste catagories of &quot;eta&quot; (extrem=\r\ne filth)\n&gt; and &quot;hinin&quot; (non-human). In both cases, there was resistance by =\r\npeople \n&gt; against these groups (freed slaves in the U.S. and &quot;new commoners=\r\n&quot; in Japan) \n&gt; that wound up in attacks and lynchings as well as continued =\r\nsegregation and \n&gt; discrimination.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmm, maybe we&#39;re not so different =\r\nafter all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Steven Matshes=\r\nhu &lt;steven_matsheshu@steven_ma&gt;\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@samuraihistosam\n&gt; Sent=\r\n: Wed, 29 Apr 2009 10:28 am\n&gt; Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Parallels i=\r\nn US and Japanese history\n&gt; \n&gt; One sad similarity between US and Japanese h=\r\nistory is the displacement and \n&gt; attempted genocide of the native people b=\r\ny the &quot;new government&quot;. I am of \n&gt; course drawing a parallel between the po=\r\nlicies and actions of the European \n&gt; settlers/US government towards Native=\r\n Americans and the Emishi/Ainu/ One sa\n&gt; \n&gt; Not just in the land-grabbing a=\r\nnd killing--- but we also saw many Emishi \n&gt; come to work for the new Emper=\r\nor(s) --- just like some natives allied with \n&gt; the new US.\n&gt; \n&gt; We also se=\r\ne that the tactics brought in from the old country (Europe for \n&gt; US, China=\r\n for Japan) were no match against the guerilla tactics of the \n&gt; natives---=\r\nand newer devices and strategies had to be made to fight them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also--t=\r\nhe idea that many Ainu hid their ethnic origins to avoid problems \n&gt; remind=\r\ns me of many native families (that can) hiding their origins to avoid \n&gt; pr=\r\noblems.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I know though...there are not any &quot;Japanese reservat=\r\nions&quot; As far \n&gt; as I know though...there are not any &quot;Japanese res\n&gt; \n&gt; Etc=\r\n.etc....\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I would say this pattern is common anytime a foreign=\r\n invader \n&gt; comes in and &quot;colonizes&quot; an area..\n&gt; \n&gt; But, still..
