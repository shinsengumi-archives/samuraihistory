As I have\nheard\n&gt; it - and this is the place for experts to correct me - he wrapped a belt\n&gt; around his knees to keep himself stationary for his second&#39;s\nfinishing cut.\n&gt; For all his discipline, focus, will and internal preparation, he\napparently\n&gt; bucked so much after he made his cut that his friend couldn&#39;t\ncorrectly hit\n&gt; the neck, and it took several strokes.  An inglorious and messy end\nfor a\n&gt; dedicated man.\n&gt; \tThis is one of those things that makes me intensely glad to be a\ngaijin, I\n&gt; fear.  I understand that the farmers and other classes took a rather\nsimilar\n&gt; view of the matter, hence the reversal of the characters spelling\n&#39;seppuku&#39;\n&gt; into the pronunciation &#39;hara-kiri&#39;.\n&gt; If anyone can confirm or refute all this, I&#39;ll be pleased.  But\nthere&#39;s my\n&gt; anecdotal history, for what it&#39;s worth.\n&gt; \tGereg\n\n\n\n"
