I tried several times but I just couldn&#39;t get into it. Being a US army brat in Japan with Japanese looks, my Dad focused my education on being American. I may still get to reading Kanji someday. But meanwhile, how about briefing me on what you read. Did the Samurai have something equivalent to the phalanx? Did the front lines hold even and try to penetrate each other&#39;s defenses or was the battle similiar to what is usually shown on tv and film where the warriors inter-penetrate each other&#39;s lines and get involved in numerous man-to-man melees all over the field with no clear demarcation of sides? I&#39;m thinking that was probably the case in Japan, that that was the reason why they needed the sashimono, so they would know who was on who&#39;s side. \n\nRichard\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
