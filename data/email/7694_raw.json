Katsumoto is a stand-in\n&gt; for Saigo Takamori,\n&gt; the real historical person, who has been described\n&gt; as &quot;the last true\n&gt; samurai&quot;. The film is nothing like the history.\n&gt; Likewise, no American\n&gt; samurai either. This was just a viewpoint character\n&gt; to enable westerners\n&gt; to glimpse Japanese culture, or at least Hollywood&#39;s\n&gt; version of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, see this short piece on Saigo Takamori:\n&gt; http://www.jref.com/glossary/saigo_takamori.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; And for more info on the samurai in general go to:\n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/index.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours\n&gt; \n&gt; Dean\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt; Head Of The Fight School\n&gt; http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
