I have a question about samurai movies.  Have \n&gt;there been any movies made about the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877?\n&gt;\n&gt;    I just saw &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; today and I enjoyed it very much, despite \n&gt;the historical liberties that were taken.  But I was wondering if anyone in \n&gt;Japan has made a more historically accurate movie about that period?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI don&#39;t know about accuracy, but there have been TV dramas and the like \nthat have been made. I think next year&#39;s NHK Taiga drama is a Meiji \npiece. Too bad, I was kind of hoping for another Musashi! What a greedy \npig I am.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
