Most of the time it&#39;s governed more by\nthe miniatures available, and less by the rules.\n\nFor a system that covers a wide time frame, I&#39;d check out DBM, and DBA.\nIt&#39;s an older system, and it&#39;s 15mm but they&#39;ve got lists for Japanese of\ndifferent time frames in their last rules set I saw.   Old Glory had a\nsamurai line which I picked up some of, both in 15mm and 25mm.    Twin\nDragons has some very detailed 15mm mini&#39;s  but last I checked they were\nbackordered.  (that may have changed, been a long time since then)\n\nAs for computer games, Shogun, Total war is one of the best games for the\nJapanese genre that I&#39;ve ever seen.    All of the others tend to be fantasy\nbased.\n\nFor a fantasy version of samurai,  Clan War isn&#39;t bad, but it suffers again\nfrom the Old Game syndrome, meaning most of the miniatures are no-longer in\nproduction and fewer people are playing it.   The mini&#39;s are gorgeous\nhowever, and are in 28mm.   It&#39;s tied very strongly to the Legend of the\nFive Rings RPG.\n\nFor a historical RPG,  I&#39;d go for Sengoku.  Though it&#39;s got a fantasy\nelement to it, it&#39;s easily stripped out and it allows you to play the\nchambara(sp) style genre fairly accurately.   Alot of actual historical\nresearch went into that game, and I&#39;ve found it to be a good down to earth\nsystem to play in. If I remember correctly, Anthony Bryant? (I apologize if\nI got his name wrong) one of the leading scholars on the time frame\ncontributed to it.  I believe his website to be sengokudaimyo.com\n\nAll of that being said, if I&#39;d have to recommend a wargame, and only one,\nI&#39;d go for Shogun: Total War.\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 5, 2009 at 12:10 PM, Evan Hodge &lt;evan_hodge@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;   To those who play wargames, by computer, tabletop or boardgame..which\n&gt; single game is to your mind the best recreation of the historical accuracy\n&gt; of Japanese warfare in the period between 600AD and 1600AD?\n&gt; Thank you\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------\nTom\nInterdum feror cupidine partium magnarum europe vincendarum\nThou shalt not refer to the Machine Spirit as &quot;Cruise Control&quot;.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
