Well, that&#39;s\nthe simple version, anyways. \n\nlast but not least i also studied some\n&gt; chinese martial arts and they have very simular\n&gt; princeples. so that lets one know just because the\n&gt; teaching is simular the two r not the same.\n\nMany martial arts and traditions have the same values.\nYou can find that all over the world. \n\n An\n&gt; Akaido proverb goes like this:  \n\nNot to be picky, but its &quot;Aikido&quot;, not &quot;Akaido&quot;. \n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nTake Yahoo!
