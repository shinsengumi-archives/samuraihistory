I&#39;m wondering if wasn&#39;t permitted\n&gt; for a foreigner \n&gt; (like a Westerner, or a someone else from another\n&gt; part of Asian)to \n&gt; become a Samurai? I have nothing against bias\n&gt; issues, but I heard a \n&gt; rumor that you have to be pure bred Japanese to\n&gt; become a Samurai, \n&gt; dispite what is portray in Hollywood movies.\n\nWell, if you&#39;re talking about now, then it doesn&#39;t\nmatter if you&#39;re Japanese, European, or Martian--the\nsamurai class was legislated out of existence in the\nlate 1800&#39;s, so no, not even Japanese can be samurai\nanymore. The samurai class doesn&#39;t exist.\n\nIf you mean back then, then that&#39;s a debatable issue.\nMany will allege that William Adams, an English ship\npilot, became samurai when he was awarded the title of\nhatamoto by Tokugawa Ieyasu. Since technically only\nsamurai could hold the title, it stands to reason that\nhe was therefore also made samurai. So there&#39;s one\ninstance. Not many others exist, if at all. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
