Most of what exists in English forms part of studies on \n&gt;  Akira Kurosawa, and for a very long time the only real publication \n&gt;  devoted to the genre remained Alain Silver&#39;s The Samurai Film, which \n&gt;  first appeared back in 1977. The situation is about to change \n&gt;  though, and not a moment too soon, what with the renewed interest in \n&gt;  the genre through the efforts of Quentin Tarantino and Tom Cruise. \n&gt;  The second half of 2005 not only sees the return of Silver&#39;s tome in \n&gt;  an updated and expanded third edition, but also the publication of a \n&gt;  brand new volume, Patrick Galloway&#39;s Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The \n&gt;  Samurai Film Handbook.\n&gt;  [snip to end]\n\nCurious, who wrote this review?\n\nI&#39;ve read the book. It was interesting and I&#39;m glad that more books are \ncoming out about samurai film. But I preferred Patrick Galloway&#39;s approach, as his \nlanguage was a lot clearer, not so much the language of a &quot;film critic&quot; in an \nobvious way. Silver&#39;s book is sometimes almost incomprehensible and incoherent \nto anyone who isn&#39;t a film student or critic, just my opinion. \n\nAnd also, I had several quibbles with his analysis of SEPPUKU, which I&#39;ll \npost later if anyone is interested. \n\nNina Boal\n\n"
