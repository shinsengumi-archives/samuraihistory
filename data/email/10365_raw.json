I probably should not have quoted this thread as I wasn&#39;t\nasking about guns per se, but specifically gunpowder and the printing press\nand generally about the development of technology in Asia.  By the time\nJapan adopted the use of flintlocks, the Chinese already had cannons,\ngrenades, and significant development in the use of gunpowder. I do not see\nwhere any development of uses for gunpowder occurred until after the arrival\nof the Portuguese.  More importantly, the arrival of the printing press\nappears to be equally disdained..  While the Chinese were printing books,\nJapan still preferred writing?  I believe there are examples in textile\nproduction and architecture as well, where significant advances were not\nreadily adopted.  Just curious if there might be an explanation or just an\noddity of history.  I can&#39;t find similar examples in Western history. In the\nWest, technology moves from country to country like wildfire, with everyone\nclaiming they invented it..\n\n-d\n\nRide wanted, off planet.

But in a nutshell, yes, guns did arrive in Japan before the\n&gt; 16th century from China/Korea - just not in sufficient numbers to build an\n&gt; arsenal, or they were thought of as &quot;curiosities&quot; and not produced in Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dennis Sheridan &lt;ldsheridan@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Chinese discovered gunpowder in the 9th century. Do I understand\n&gt; &gt; correctly that the Japanese did not acquire this technology until the mid\n&gt; &gt; 16th century with Portuguese guns? (The route would be from China to\n&gt; Arabia\n&gt; &gt; to Europe and from there all the way back to Japan.. This is not at all\n&gt; &gt; intuitive.) Similarly, the Chinese had movable type and a crude printing\n&gt; &gt; press (via India) by the mid 11th c., the Koreans the same 3 centuries\n&gt; later\n&gt; &gt; and apparently the Japanese even later than that. Given the geographical\n&gt; &gt; juxtaposition, the treaties, diplomatic missions, the trade, and\n&gt; countless\n&gt; &gt; other factors, I am completely mystified that a technological advance by\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; country would not be almost immediately adopted by the other two. I\n&gt; demand\n&gt; &gt; an explanation. (But if that is impolite I meekly beg one.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -d\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ride wanted, off planet.
