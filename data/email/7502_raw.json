Was Ox North? Thanks-K&K\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry I got carried away with my answer, but hopefully you&#39;ll find \nit\n&gt; all useful:\n&gt; \n&gt; The same 12 animals as used in the zodiac and for marking the hours \nof\n&gt; the day were used for directions as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1st direction/hour Rat = nezumi = north = 23:00-01:00 (midnight @ \n00:00)\n&gt; 2nd direction/hour = ox = ushi = 01:00-03:00\n&gt; ox/tiger = ushi tora = north east = 03:00\n&gt; 3rd hour = tiger = tora = 03:00-05:00\n&gt; 4th hour = rabbit = usagi = east = 05:00-07:00 (sunrise @ 06:00)\n&gt; 5th hour = dragon = tatsu = 07:00-09:00\n&gt; dragon/snake = tatsu hebi = south east 09:00\n&gt; 6th hour = snake = hebi = 09:00-11:00\n&gt; 7th hour = horse = uma = south = 11:00-13:00 (midday = 12:00)\n&gt; 8th hour = sheep (not goat) = hitsuji = 13:00-15:00\n&gt; sheep/monkey = hitsuji saru = south west 15:00\n&gt; 9th hour =  monkey = saru = 15:00-17:00\n&gt; 10th hour = garden bird (rooster) = niwa tori (sometimes \njust &quot;tori&quot;) =\n&gt; west = 17:00-19:00 (sunset @ 18:00)\n&gt; 11th hour = dog = inu = 19:00-21:00\n&gt; dog/boar = inu inoshishi = north west 21:00\n&gt; 12th hour = boar = inoshishi = 21:00-2300\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay when folks say &quot;at the hour of the X&quot;, what they mean is the \nmid-\n&gt; point of that time slot. So the hour of the rat is in fact \nmidnight. But\n&gt; you also get &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; rat. Its important to note that the\n&gt; times specified above only apply at the spring and summer \nequinoxes, as\n&gt; the day and the night were divided in to 6 equal &quot;hours&quot;. Which \nmeans\n&gt; that at mid-summer the daylight hours were twice as long as the \nnightime\n&gt; ones! Actually the easier way to grasp this system, is to forget the\n&gt; numbers above and simply go outside and look up at the daytime sky. \nThen\n&gt; divide the path of the sun&#39;s travel across it from sunrise to \nsunset as\n&gt; though it were super-imposed upon the top half of an old style clock\n&gt; face. Sunrise as the middle of the hour of the rabbit, midday is the\n&gt; middle of the hour of the horse, and sunset is the middle of the \nhour of\n&gt; the bird. The others just slot in between (one and two thirds up the\n&gt; curve of the sky). The hour of the rabbit actually starts with the \nfirst\n&gt; light of the day (morning twilight) and the hour of the bird ends \nwith\n&gt; the last light of the day (evening twilight).\n&gt; \n&gt; Again I hope all this stuff helps\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours\n&gt; \n&gt; Dean\n&gt; ***\n&gt; \n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt; Head Of The Fight School\n&gt; http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\nI forget but I belive each Animal was split into a younger and older \nsection to make it 24 total hours. I will have to look it up again.\n\nMaikeru\n\n\n\n"
