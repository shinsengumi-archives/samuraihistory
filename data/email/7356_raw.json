From the Armouries \nwebsite:\n&quot;Aimed at Museum professionals with Japanese arms and armour \ncollections, the sessions will include guidance on identification, \nconservation, and display. Attendees will be able to see Shogun and \nreceive an exhibition catalogue as part of their ticket price. Must be \npre-booked.&quot;\n\nIn addition, the Armouries are putting on displays of yabusame every \nWednesday and Thursday as well as demonstrations of calligraphy, \nsuiboku and ikebana, amongst other things.\n\nA family oriented sleep-over event is scheduled for August 13th.\n\nI&#39;ll be visiting the exhibition this week and I&#39;ll post with details.\n\n\n\n"
