The hakama hid whether or not they\n&gt; were seated like this in particular, or  _however_  they were seated in\nfact.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kumo.\n&gt;\n&gt; Natsu Kusa Ya\n&gt; Tsuamono Domo Ga\n&gt; Yume No Ato\n&gt;\n&gt; Basho.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;\n&gt; From: konos\n&gt;\n&gt; Besides it&#39;s ocassional apperance at the Edo Period and in the hitatare of\n12th century, hakama is not obligatory. It&#39;s not a\n&gt; daimyo&#39;s command. Nevertheless samurai were more or less obliged to follow\nthe &quot;rich and famous&quot; status of the court they were\n&gt; implicated in. First of all samurai were warriors. So even the obi was the\nright dressing only if it could carry tanto or\n&gt; wakizashi.\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings from Greece, especially to Amphipolis.\n&gt; Konstantinos\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
