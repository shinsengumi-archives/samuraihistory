Everyone is usually familiar with Nagashino\n(1575) and the rotating firing system, and it is often\nused as an example of this before it appears in\nEurope. What most people do not realize is that this\nwasn&#39;t nearly the first such instance--just the\nlargest stage for it. Rotational fire had occured as\nearly as the mid 1560&#39;s for sure (Ikko-ikki) and\nTurnbull discusses it as early as 1560 in his Samurai\nSourcebook. At Nagashino we see 3000 (though some\nrecent scholarly debate has asserted the number was\ncloser to 1000) guns used in conjunction with natural\nand man made obstacles (to me, the REAL genius of\nNobunaga at Nagashino) to create the perfect defense\nagainst a mobile attack. That&#39;s what I meant by my\nstatement.\n\nNate\n--- Pamela Grayer &lt;m.grayer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Nate\n&gt; Can you expand on your statement that Sengoku period\n&gt; armies were using\n&gt; firearms &#39;to greater effect than Europeans, and on a\n&gt; much more massive\n&gt; scale&#39;?\n&gt; What are your sources?\n&gt; I agree that Japanese armies of this period were\n&gt; generally more tactically\n&gt; sophisticated than their European counterparts\n&gt; throughout this period - at\n&gt; least until the reforms of Maurice of Nassau in the\n&gt; Dutch Army and the\n&gt; (slightly later) reforms of Gustavas Adolphus of\n&gt; Sweden.\n&gt; Where the Europeans appear to have developed a\n&gt; definite advantage is in the\n&gt; use of siege artillery, naval technology and naval\n&gt; artillery.

By\n&gt; 1575\n&gt; &gt; the Japanese were using firearms on the\n&gt; battlefield to\n&gt; &gt; greater effect than Europeans, and on a much more\n&gt; &gt; massive scale. The only reason Europeans surpassed\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Japanese by the time the two civilizations\n&gt; re-engaged\n&gt; &gt; in the 1800&#39;s is that the Japanese had 200 years\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; peace, no warfare, so no reason to adapt and\n&gt; change\n&gt; &gt; the way they did things. ONce they saw that need,\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; did, and defeated a major European power shortly\n&gt; &gt; thereafter (1904-05, Russia).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- CRAZ &lt;crazoftheages@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not deeply versed on the subject of specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; formations and the like, but I do know I have\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 8\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jpg&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  warfare spoken of in such a negative fashion\n&gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days.  It used to be left at &quot;the Japanese were\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specialized and better at personal combat\n&gt; whereas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Europeans were better at keeping order and mass\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combat&quot;, but even that is being challenged these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by people who insist in the superiorty of\n&gt; European\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fencing, unarmed combat and actually have the\n&gt; gull\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compare the european sword to the katana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I could rant on, but I&#39;ll do that some other\n&gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; New Yahoo!
