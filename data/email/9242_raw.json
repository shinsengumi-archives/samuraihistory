Whilst I may be wrong, I believe they wer=\r\ne, like the naginata, a prefered weapon of the yama-bushi or warrior monks.=\r\n I think towards the end of Edo period they were more used as ornaments in =\r\ndaimyo processions and the like. I have a Meiji period photo of an armoured=\r\n samurai with a tetsubo, so they certainly did exist. I am surprised that i=\r\nt was used from horseback and am sure that tetsubojutsu was a minor martial=\r\n way.\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: cez_72 \n  To: =\r\nsamuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, December 21, 2006 3:29 PM=\r\n\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] The tetsubo in Japanese military history\n\n\n  H=\r\ni. I have been discussing the actual existence/use of tetsubo with \n  some =\r\nfellow RPG players.\n\n  Tetsubo (&quot;iron staff&quot;?) are those big and heavy iron=\r\n studded staves \n  often seen in old samurai prints. They seem to have been=\r\n popular \n  during the Gempei war and/or Kamakura period. I have also read =\r\nthat \n  they were used as a kind of psychological weapon, to intimidate the=\r\n \n  enemies with a &quot;big fu*king club&quot;. (I seem to remember that nodachi \n  =\r\nblades were also used for a similar purpose, in later eras).\n\n  According t=\r\no another source found on the internet, the tetsubo was \n  also - and forem=\r\nost - employed from horseback (which surprised me, \n  because I would have =\r\nthought that a such a weapon would be too \n  cumbersome to be used effectiv=\r\nely from the saddle), so the wielder \n  could add the mount&#39;s momentum to h=\r\nis swing, for a truly devastating \n  blow.\n\n  I still wonder to what extent=\r\n the tetsubos were actually used on the \n  battlefield.\n  Were they a commo=\r\nn sight on the battlefield or were they limited \n  to earlier historic peri=\r\nods and/or specific tactical purposes? \n  Were there a specific martial sty=\r\nle associated with the tetsubo, such \n  as to allow something like basic pa=\r\nrries, counterattacks or &quot;called \n  shots&quot;, or their use was simple and str=\r\naightforward (a- lift weapon; \n  b- lower weapon on enemy&#39;s head; 3- repeat=\r\n from 1.)? They don&#39;t look \n  like they could be used like a naginata, a bo=\r\n staff or anything like \n  that.\n\n  Any info on the subject is appreciated.=\r\n\n  Thanks.\n\n  --\n  C E Z\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have be=\r\nen removed]\n\n\n"
