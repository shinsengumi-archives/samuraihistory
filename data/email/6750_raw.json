It&#39;s a children&#39;s &quot;educational&quot; book I recieved on my \n&gt; birthday, when I was a child. Simon and Schuster Inc. mostly make \n&gt; children&#39;s book. I&#39;m quite shocked how inaccurate the information \n&gt; is. Thank you for clearing this up. I wish to learn, not stereotype. \n&gt; That&#39;s a good philosphy.\n\n   Children&#39;s books are almost always simplified, sometimes to the point \nof being just plain dumbed down, a process which unfortunately tends to \nlead to gross overgeneralisation that turns into a distortion of the facts.\n\n   My own rule of thumb about things like this is to remain suspicious \nof a given &quot;fact&quot; until I&#39;ve seen it confirmed by at least two, and \npreferably more, independent sources.\n\n   And to more fully answer your original question: I&#39;m sure there was a \nrange of attitude towards guns among the samurai when they were first \nintroduced, and there were probably a few grognards among them who \nthough of guns as unworthy weapons for a true warrior. However, they \nwere probably a minority -- on the whole, samurai tended to be quite \npragmatic.\n\nPhil\n\n\n\n\n\n"
