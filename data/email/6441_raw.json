It was a great\ntime--nothing beats a nice hot onsen after tramping\naround the mountains all day. No castles this time,\nbut I did go to the Hakone Tokaido Sekisho--cool\nstuff. The first day we couldn&#39;t see Fuji at all, the\nsecond day we could see the top, the clouds obscured\nthe bottom, and the third day we could see the bottom,\nbut clouds were at the top. So between the days, we\nmight have a decent picture. I&#39;ll send you the link\nonce I get around to posting them. \n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
