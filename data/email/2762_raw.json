Or Amazon.com?\n\nI don&#39;t want to sound too unhelpful here, but a lot of\nus have been on this board and studying samurai\nhistory for a long time. PLEASE don&#39;t come here, all\nyou newbie Last Samurai types, and expect \n\na. that the movie is the be all end all of Samurai\nhistory.\n\nb. That you can talk intelligently without ever\npicking up a book. \n\nc. that everyone else on here has the same ideas about\nbecoming samurai/whatever. Several people on here are\npublished authors on the subject--if they tell you\nyou&#39;re wrong, you are. Take it like men. \n\nNow, about books, there is an extensive bibliography\non the www.samurai-archives.com website. Go there,\nlook at it, and start reading. If we have to explain\nthe whole history of the samurai every time someone\nnew asks, we&#39;ll never do anything but that. Again, I&#39;m\nnot trying to be unhelpful--the most helpful thing I\ncan do is tell you to start reading! It will save us\nall heartache and acrimony if you even just look at\nthe website first, rather than charging in here with\nnotions that Hollywood is History. \n\nRead the website, get some books at the library, read\nthe discussion board...\n\nThanks,\n\nNate\n\n--- marc kemp &lt;damarcyman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; i dont say im a samurai. but i know some stuf about\n&gt; them, if some one can tell me where to find some\n&gt; books about bushido please help me.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Angry Llama &lt;klancesegall@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:listen, by saying you&#39;re a samurai you&#39;ve just\n&gt; given\n&gt; most of us a HUGE headache.\n&gt; You DO know that the Bushido was an invention of the\n&gt; Edo era to keep samurai in line and give them a\n&gt; purpose in society? that the only people who EVER\n&gt; used\n&gt; bushido in combat were the Shinsen gumi, and that it\n&gt; showed a marvelous FAILURE? No, by following the\n&gt; Bushido you are NOT a samurai, you are a\n&gt; dissillusioned individual.\n&gt; The samurai were not &quot;outlawed&quot; as some people like\n&gt; to\n&gt; believe, they had their status removed. Which means\n&gt; that if you were a samurai before the bakumatsu, you\n&gt; were NOT still a samurai in the Meiji era. The only\n&gt; possible exception might be Saigo Takamori and the\n&gt; Satsuma Rebellion. Listen, no one today is a\n&gt; samurai.\n&gt; And its really sad to think of yourself as one just\n&gt; because you follow a code of ethics from the lowest\n&gt; period in the history of the samurai.\n&gt; That being said it is great that you follow martial\n&gt; arts, I do so myself. And I&#39;d be interested in\n&gt; hearing\n&gt; what all you have to know about the historical\n&gt; samurai.\n&gt; --- kyosuke_miyamoto &lt;kyosuke_miyamoto@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello Everyone, Im Kyosuke. I&#39;m new to the forum\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; all, but I know \n&gt; &gt; a great lot about samurai, weapons, and ancient\n&gt; &gt; japan. I myself, \n&gt; &gt; follow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real\n&gt; &gt; life Samurai, though \n&gt; &gt; Samurai&#39;s have been outlawed since the late\n&gt; 1800&#39;s,\n&gt; &gt; I still consider \n&gt; &gt; myself one. I&#39;ve been to Japan, and studied the\n&gt; &gt; fighting skills from \n&gt; &gt; Sensei Ichi Hayamatsu, learned the old culture and\n&gt; &gt; the respects. And \n&gt; &gt; with this, I&#39;ve become a Samurai. I want to be the\n&gt; &gt; one to say how Im \n&gt; &gt; honored in joining this forum, and expect a lot of\n&gt; &gt; great stuff from \n&gt; &gt; you all as well. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is all.\n&gt; &gt; -Kyosuke Miyamoto\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P.S. Im also A fanatic of old Samurai Movies. If\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;d like we can \n&gt; &gt; talk of them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Protect your identity with Yahoo!
