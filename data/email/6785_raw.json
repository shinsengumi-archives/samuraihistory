Now my question here is how was it destroyed was it burned to the ground? Oh yeah one more thing how did Hideyoshi die was he murdered or did he die of natural causes?&quot;\nThe buildings were bombarded by cannon and burned. When Tokugawa took control, he rebuilt the complex on top of the existing walls (so none of the walls you see there today are the Toyotomi originals, although they have excavated some of these).\nHideyoshi died of natural causes-some sort of illness. Syphillis is a popular theory, which would explain his increasingly bizarre behavior towards the end of his life-but I don&#39;t know how much stock to put in that. His notorious countless dalliances with women add more credence to the theory, though.\n\n\n\n\n"
