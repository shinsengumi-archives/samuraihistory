The comments in the post were\nspecifcally in response to Oniyama&#39;s pointed questions\nregarding my assertions against Hayes. I responded,\npoint by point. If the documentary has the correct\ninfo, then a point in it&#39;s favor; if it employes\nHayes, than that&#39;s a point against. Evens out so far. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo! Mail Mobile \nTake Yahoo! Mail with you! Check email on your mobile phone. \nhttp://mobile.yahoo.com/learn/mail \n\n"
