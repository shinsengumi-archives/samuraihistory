You best bet would be to sav=\r\ne , your uk based so if clive picks this up he maybe able to help out. but =\r\nlike all good things you get what you pay for. Personally buy a few books a=\r\nnd learn what to look for in a good blade also check out the excellent swor=\r\nd display at the british museum. To cap it off better to invest in some goo=\r\nd books on the subject and save for a better blade that way you wont get ri=\r\npped of. james\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- ma_rk1980 =\r\nwrote:\n\n&gt; HELLO EVERY ONE, REGARDING THE PREVIOUS MESSAGE\n&gt; POSTED ABOUT \n&gt;=\r\n COLLECTING SAMURAI SWORDS, I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO\n&gt; START COLLECTING \n&gt; SO=\r\nME, BUT I CAN NOT AFFORD A REAL ONE DOES ANY ONE\n&gt; KNOW A GOOD SITE \n&gt; TO B=\r\nUY GOOD REPLICA ONE, FOR DONT LAUGH =A3200-=A3300,\n&gt; AS THIS IS ALL I \n&gt; CA=\r\nN AFFORD FOR THE MOMENT, I WOULD LIKE A REAL LIVE\n&gt; ONE IF POSS, CAN \n&gt; ANY=\r\n ONE HELP \n\nMark:\n\nPlease don&#39;t post in all capital letters.
