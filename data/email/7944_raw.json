He was on the small boat and made a bokken (later \ncalled suburito) from an oar?\n\nOn the movie starring Mifune, he was actually bringing his sword but he \npicked an oar to use for the duel as he was asked by the boat-man, why \ndo you make a bokken and not use your sword? Musashi said: &quot;I like the \nsize&quot;. While other source on website saying the Musashi actually forgot \nhis sword and he had to make a bokken from an oar.\n\nHere is the excerpt from the site: &quot;Musashi Miyamoto, arguably Japan&#39;s \ngreatest swordsman, overslept one morning. He was due to meet one of his \nmany challengers and was already running late. As he bolted from his bed \nto the door, he, incredibly, forgot his sword!! Hastily, he boarded the \nsmall boat that was to take him to a small island (sandbar) where his \narmed opponent awaited him anxiously. Realizing his predicament along \nthe way, he grabbed one of the boat&#39;s oars and, with a small knife, \nbegan whittling a crudely-shaped katana from it. Arriving at his \ndestination, Musashi greeted his adversary. The man laughed and \nconfidently drew his weapon and attacked the awaiting Musashi. With a \nswift series of graceful movements, Musashi expertly defended himself \nand quickly dispatched the over-zealous opponent by crushing his \nskull!!! ... and so was born the Suburito.&quot;\n\nThe question is, did Musashi actually forget his sword and have to make \na bokken from an oar or did he actually like the size of the oar and \nprefer using it to using his sword?\n\nThanks.\n\nTotok Sudarijanto\nhttp://www.mjer.org\nemail: totok.sudarijanto@...\n\n&quot;The ultimate aim of martial arts is not having to use them.&quot;\n\n\n\n"
