I train \nin Muso Shinden Ryu and have been taught to keep the ha (cutting edge) up \nuntil the last moment.  This is partly to cut down on the noise that a \nbattou would cause and partly to cut down on any friction.  Any sand or dirt \ninside the saya would stratch up the side of the blade if it was drawn in \nany manner besides ha up.  Since blades, when properly on display, on shown \nha up with the tsuka (handle) to the left it would be displaying the side \nthat was getting scratched up.\n  This is just what I have been taught.  Out of curiosity, what style of \nIaido did you study?\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt Williams\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCell phone �switch� rules are taking effect � find out more here. \nhttp://special.msn.com/msnbc/consumeradvocate.armx\n\n\n\n"
