Our kind host has a very good set of maps at \nwww.sengoku=\r\n-archives.com For instance there is this one that shows the \nnames of the D=\r\naimyo (but not the names of the &quot;kuni&quot;) in 1545:\nhttp://www.samurai-archive=\r\ns.com/1545.html\n2. There is a great map that shows the outlines of the kuni=\r\n and \ntheir old names at http://flagspot.net/flags/jp(k.html\n3. If I new an=\r\nything about mapping software I would make for myself \na map which combines=\r\n the two, plus included modern prefecture \nboundaries and names. It&#39;s been =\r\non my mind for about a year now but \nit&#39;s one of those projects that I gues=\r\ns I&#39;ll get to &quot;one of these \ndays&quot; (like my translation of the ShinChou Kou=\r\nKi....)\n\nBut, recognize that even though the Sengoku period was rather shor=\r\nt, \nit was quite turbulent. So, the answers to your questions are all \npret=\r\nty much &quot;it depends on exactly what date you are looking at&quot;. \nAre you inte=\r\nrested in a specific time period/date, or the overall \nflow of events durin=\r\ng the entire late 15th-16th centuries?\n\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@OdaNobunaga.=\r\ncom\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archive=\r\ns store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
