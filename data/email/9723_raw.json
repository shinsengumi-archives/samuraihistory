I still contend that these will not become collectibles  \nlike some Shinsakuto surely will, if as a newbie you can afford $2k  \nfor one of these I think you could easily save for a year and find a  \ntrue nihonto that will appreciate for around $5k, and a little study  \ngoes a long way...\nstepping off my soapbox,\n-t\nTom Helm\ntoryu@...\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamas&quot;\n- Virgil\n\n\n\nOn Apr 7, 2008, at 9:46 PM, INRSTRGTH@... wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Being a specialist in Nihonto, I can recommend some places. You  \n&gt; could try\n&gt; centuryfitness.com, they have a new signature sword collection, and  \n&gt; since it\n&gt; is in dollars it would be pretty cheap in\n&gt; pounds. Also, I would give Bugei.com a try. Be warned about century\n&gt; though, their swords are not traditionally forged.\n&gt; DO NOT BUY A SWORD FROM CENTURY!!! The Signature Series is made by  \n&gt; Hanwei.\n&gt; The rest is just junk. Bugei, also gets their swords from Hanwei.  \n&gt; Check out\n&gt; _www.casiberia.com_ (http://www.casiberia.com) . If you are looking  \n&gt; for\n&gt; replica&#39;s, Hanwei is the way to go. Not cheap, but a high level of  \n&gt; quality.\n&gt;\n&gt; Greg\n&gt;\n&gt; **************Planning your summer road trip?
