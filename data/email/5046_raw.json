It helped me out a lot. I appreciated it greatly. I just have some problems with lasing the lames together. You said that this guy is on this list. Do you know what screen name he goes by? While I was on the site I e-mailed him and he still hasn&#39;t replied. Maybe you could help me with a easier way to learn how to lase the lames together. If you have any more info. it would greatly be appreciated. \n                                                                   Thank you again,\n                                                                        Mark\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- depos42300 &lt;depos42300@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello, \n&gt;   I put up a message about 3 days ago trying to get\n&gt; some help on \n&gt; making samurai armour.

This is probably the best source on the\nweb you&#39;ll find for &quot;do it yourself&quot; armor, if you\nwant to do it right. He&#39;s got other links and so forth\nto peruse, also. \n\n\n            \n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
