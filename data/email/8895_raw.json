Is what made a samurai not\n&gt; the quality of his sword, but the state of his mind and soul in\n&gt; everyday life. Sorry this question is so corny but i couldnt think of\n&gt; any better way to type it. At first this doesnt sound like history but\n&gt; i suppose it could be if you consider edo period samurai in the\n&gt; question. Also i cant ask a question straightforward.\n\nI&#39;m not sure if I understand the question, but it seems to \nsmack of Hollywood myth backgrounds.\n\nA samurai was a member of an elite social class. It was a \nsocial CASTE. A sword was a weapon. NSome non-samurai had \nswords, some samurai used weapons other than swords.\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
