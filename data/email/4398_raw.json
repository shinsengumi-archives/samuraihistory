It may be the usual &#39;hoiler than thou&#39; stuff\nbut kalari payattau of kerala is celebrated world wide\nand has a great amount of science in it. they are now\npracticing it as a medicine, nervous and orthopaedic\nproblems are treated by the kalari experts, lot of\nherbal medicine go in to it. they also know about the\nnerve centres of the body called &#39;marmam&#39;.\ntraditionally it was the warrior caste nairs who were\nleading in this, later during colonisation the Kalaris\nwere banned, for obvious reasons.\n\np r j pradeep\nwww.nairs.org\n\n Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sean-\n&gt; \tThere may be some confusion about your question.\n&gt; Are you interested in \n&gt; the most authentic martial arts practiced today or\n&gt; the most modern \n&gt; style with traditional roots?
