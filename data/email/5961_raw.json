Found over 600 messages in the inbox, mostly from this \ngroup. \n\nTom (Helm), I got quite intrigued by Keiki and went to Shizuoka on his \ntrail. I don&#39;t know how much time he could spare communing with the \nspirit of his ancestor, considering how occupied he was with his \nhobbies of photography, cycling and so on, and his three wives and \ndozens of children. It is fascinating to reflect on what a modern \npersonality Keiki seems; less than ten years after the assassination of Ii \nNaosuke by the Mito ronin (surely an archetypal feudal event!) Keiki has \nabdicated and retired to live an apparently serene and blameless life. \n\nTom (Davidson) Don&#39;t know if you have done your research trip yet, but \nif you are in or near Nagoya there are some good atmospheric places \nwithin easy reach by train.\n\nThe Kiso valley: you can walk on the old Nakasendo from Magome to \nTsumago. Gives a very good feel of travel in the Edo period ( I know it&#39;s \nlater than your era but the mountains etc are unchanged!) Narai is a \nvery unspoiled small town.\n\nKanazawa: apart from the gardens (very beautiful) lots of atmosphere. \n\nInuyama: everyone&#39;s favourite castle\n\nIn Nagoya the Tokugawa Art Museum has a good collection of \nartefacts, clothes, weapons etc, mainly from the highest ranks of \nsociety. Not much here on how the poor folk lived.\n\nIf you are in Kansai the Osaka Museum of History is excellent for an \noverview of lifestyles throughout Japanese history. And I found Hikone \ncastle and museum particularly inspiring (maybe because I was there in \na Kurosawa-esque downpour)\n\nKyoto is unparalleled - but overwhelming on a short trip. Some of the \nolder towns particularly on the Japan sea (Hagi, Matsue) are easier to \ntake in. But I found the Kyoto Musuem of Traditional Crafts again very \ngood for lifestyles.\n\nThere are many places in rural Japan (in my case Yamaguchi-ken) \nwhere an insignificant sign saying something like &quot;remains of castle&quot; \nwill take you to some stones on a hill top or the head of a valley where \na 15th c castle once stood. It gives you a good sense of the defensive \nuse of the terrain. Unforgettable. So it&#39;s a good idea to base yourself \nfor a few days in the country and hike or bike around.\n\nGillian\n\n"
