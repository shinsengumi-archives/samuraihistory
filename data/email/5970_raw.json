As you know as a scho=\r\nler of kendo, that modesty is a notable value in swordplay , calling your s=\r\nword wonderfull (or a oily fish lol kitsuno hehe funniest thing all day)\nis=\r\n, if you dont mind me saying slightly vain. Im curious at which fencing sch=\r\nool you attended, and under whom you studied i will happily give you all my=\r\n kendo details in a fair trade hehe, although i did speak to a guy whom nam=\r\ned his sword kageonimusha, shadow demon warrior i think please correct me i=\r\nf im wrong, bloody awful name. But if any one can translate (slightly sharp=\r\n) into japanese id be forever grateful\njames wilson &lt;johntwo8@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n\n\nSabarashi means wonderfull. and thats what i ment ya i know i cannot=\r\n be samurai i eie say i studied. but there was a conversation abt how those=\r\ns that trained in Japan related their training to that of a samurai. well i=\r\n can understand that and then i cant. i too studied in Japan. in Kyushu und=\r\ner a great teacher. but i never asked him much abt it. however in like the =\r\nlast year or so i have been or should i say started studing. he just though=\r\nt us the importance of karate just like Master Funakoshi. i have a few of h=\r\nis books and he never metions it in the ones i have abt his karate being li=\r\nnked with the samurai. last but not least i also studied some chinese marti=\r\nal arts and they have very simular princeples. so that lets one know just b=\r\necause the teaching is simular the two r not the same. An Akaido proverb go=\r\nes like this: There is many roads that lead to the top of the Mountain. But=\r\n once at the top the look up at the say moon. theres many ways to look at t=\r\nhis but i hope all can relate\nthis meaning. \n\npeace\nGOD BLESS U\n\n\nNate Ledb=\r\netter wrote:\n\n\n--- james wilson wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello how r u. i am not a samurai=\r\n but i train very\n&gt; hard in Japanes art and i do my studies like many\n&gt; oth=\r\ners on this forum. n e who i did name my Katana.\n&gt; i think even before i go=\r\nt it. i named it Sabarashi.\n&gt; however i have no name for my short blade. we=\r\nll as\n&gt; for help on did actual samurai name theres well i\n&gt; dont know. but =\r\ngood luck on ur searching. GOD BLESS\n&gt; U and have a nice day\n\nJames--\n\nOf c=\r\nourse you aren&#39;t a samurai. It&#39;s impossible to be\none, since the samurai cl=\r\nass was abolished in the\n1870&#39;s. Legally none exist anymore. But, on to the=\r\n\nrest of your post.\n\n&quot;Sabarashi=81h, eh? What meaning are you going for? I\n=\r\ncan think of multiple kanji combinations, but can&#39;t\nidentify immediately wh=\r\nich you might be using to give\nmeaning. \n\nAs for a name for a short sword, =\r\nI&#39;m not a sword\nexpert, so I&#39;ll leave that to them. \n\n\n\n\n\n_________________=\r\n_________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours =\r\ndo?\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archiv=\r\nes.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---=\r\n \nYahoo!
