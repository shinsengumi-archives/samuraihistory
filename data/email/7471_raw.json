Instea=\r\nd, you have\n &gt; your whole defensive line follow that one guy around,\n &gt; lea=\r\nving the rest of his team&#39;s offense open. Overkill,\n &gt; since the guy isn&#39;t =\r\nall that good, really--and you&#39;ve\n &gt; got guys missing in the areas where th=\r\ney could make plays.\n \nI&#39;ll try one that perhaps more people might be famil=\r\niar with these days?\n\nOK, so you&#39;ve got the NHL owners (Tokugawa) and the N=\r\nHL players\n(Sanada). The NHL players want a higher share of revenue (land),=\r\n while\nthe NHL owners want to limit the amount of revenue that the players =\r\ncan\nhave, in order to stop the NHL players individually taking up a large\np=\r\nercentage of the total revenue of the NHL owners.\n\nSo, rather than continui=\r\nng on with the season while devoting a portion\nof resources to deal with th=\r\ne situation, a lock-out is put in effect and\nall resources are used up to d=\r\neal with the problem, potentially having a\nfatal effect on the future of th=\r\ne NHL.\n\nHTH!\n_____________________________________________________________\n=\r\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, =\r\nand is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
