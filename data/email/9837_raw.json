The  \nother and more important accomplishment was his Senchu-Hassaku, or  \neight point plan. This later may be seen in the form of the Imperial  \nRescript of 1869 establishing the new parliamentary style of government.\n\tThere are many theories about his assassination, I tend to believe  \nthe deathbed confession of the Mimawari-gumi member. He had motive,  \nopportunity and ability. I am sorry I don&#39;t have the article at hand,  \nwill try to post some details later if our dear monitor doesn&#39;t mind  \nthat we are not really talking about Samurai...\nLet us die and jump into the thick of battle!\n-t\nTom Helm\ntoryu@...\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;\n- Vergil\n\n\n\nOn Nov 24, 2008, at 12:29 AM, &lt;eddiehiramoto@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Tom, and All,\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you like to know about Ryoma ? Sorry about my clumsy knowledge ,  \n&gt; but I try to explain as follows;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sakamoto Ryoma was one of the most important guy to change Old  \n&gt; Japan to New Japan at the end of Edo era, about 1860&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; He came from the lowest class of Samurai , Buke , located in  \n&gt; Sikoku. Facing to perfect chaos reigned in Japan , like social  \n&gt; disorder triggered by unctroll of Edo Bakufu, government due to  \n&gt; losing power and consecutive farmers riots against stupid Daimyo ,  \n&gt; king of prefecture who imposed\n&gt; heavier tax to them, etc, he was afraid that Europeans and  \n&gt; Americans aimed Japan and did military force to make Japan as their  \n&gt; colony like they did for China, India, and other Asian Countries.\n&gt;\n&gt; He tried to lead Chosu and Satsuma ( Local han , small government  \n&gt; reighned by local daimyo , king, used to be controlled completely  \n&gt; by Edo Bakufu ) to be allied each other as one strong powerful  \n&gt; union to fight and defend from colonialzation by them.\n&gt;\n&gt; He had a dream one day , Japan will change to new country to be  \n&gt; governed by new power instead of old power , Edo bakufu, and Japan  \n&gt; will become like European , or American country under the control  \n&gt; by democratic government instead of feudal power.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, he was assasinated by stupid , special group formed by old  \n&gt; power , Edo bakufu, named Sinsengumi who tried to oust the  \n&gt; progressionist like him to guard Edo bakufu, before his dream came  \n&gt; true , in the interim.\n&gt;\n&gt; After his assasination, soon, the allied force of Chosu and Satuma  \n&gt; did defend the colonicalization by Europe and America and defeted  \n&gt; old power, Edo Bakufu, without decisive collapse triggered by war  \n&gt; against Edo Bakufu , and formed new government of Meiji under the  \n&gt; reign of Emperor.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, Japan need best leader , like Ryoma, for example, because  \n&gt; current , consecutive stupid Prime Ministers losing seat within a  \n&gt; few months come out one after the other , and did nothing for us.  \n&gt; Japan is waisting big money and time. Furthermore, It is so  \n&gt; shameful , or disaster that newest\n&gt; Prime Minister can&#39;t speak correctly about Kanji , Japanese  \n&gt; character, even Elementary level quite sometime !!\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a dream , one day Japan change the election system and  \n&gt; become like American style and elect Prime Minister , or newly  \n&gt; formed President by people of Japan directly insteaed of indirect  \n&gt; way like now, through almost one year campaign. So that way, we can  \n&gt; expect excelent leader soon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eddie\n&gt;\n&gt; Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Jore remember Kumi or Gumi is a suffix that means group/unit\n&gt; Try searching under Shinsen-gumi and Mimawari-gumi.
