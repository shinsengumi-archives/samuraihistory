I was wondering if anyone has any ideas why t=\r\nhere is a lack of defencive shield in japanese military history. Ive read t=\r\nhat it maybe due to the samurai origins as a horseback archer and that they=\r\n were not devloped because ,obviously thay would be in the way of drawing a=\r\n bow. I also find it strange that in my kendo training there are no sword t=\r\nechniques like the lunge as seen in european fencing which is sometimes see=\r\nn as a way past a shield, is this why the lunge techinque wasnt devloped in=\r\n japan because there was no need for it due to a lack of shields. Anyone go=\r\nt any ideas ( i am aware there are lunging techniques in japanese swordplay=\r\n but vastly different from european forms) thanks all hope your all good\n\nN=\r\nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n--- luke berryman &lt;luke_berryman=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n\nTo all,\n&gt;      Because of recent e-mails about the\n&gt; =\r\nrelationship between Bushido and Karate, I have\n&gt; decided to write an essay=\r\n on this subject, using\n&gt; evidence from JKA masters as well as extracts fro=\r\nm\n&gt; respected books. This is my final attempt to prove\n&gt; to you all there i=\r\ns such a strong link between the\n&gt; 2.\n\nNo one has said that there was no li=\r\nnk between the\ncurrent martial art of Karate and it&#39;s philosophical\nunderpi=\r\nnnings, and the concept of bushido. What has\nbeen put forth is about its OR=\r\nIGINS, not the\ndevelopmental path it has taken as an art. Are you\ndenying t=\r\nhat it was originally developed by peasants?\nBecause if you are not, then I=\r\n have no idea why you\nare being argumentative. No one has argued against\nyo=\r\nur thesis stated above. \n\n\n            \n__________________________________ =\r\n\nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.c=\r\nom \n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archi=\r\nves store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
