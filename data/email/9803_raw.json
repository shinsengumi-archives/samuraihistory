However,  long time ago,  Taira, Genji, \nAhikaga, Oda, To=\r\nkugawa  learned  KOJIKI profoudly through erudites \nat that time and believ=\r\ned the contents written in KOJIKI.\n\n   If a person cannot understand the ab=\r\nove thing , there is no other \nway to explain.\n\n    In that case, what is t=\r\nhe answer to this question, topic ?\n\n   Eddie  Hiramoto\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n--- In samu=\r\nraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JL Badgley&quot; &lt;tatsushu@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; For som=\r\ne others out there:\n&gt; \n&gt; HEISI =3D Heishi or Heiji =3D Taira (&quot;Taira&quot; is th=\r\ne reading of the \nfirst\n&gt; character of HEISHI, or at least in this instance=\r\n)\n&gt; GENJI =3D Minamoto (Again, &quot;Minamoto&quot; is how you read the first\n&gt; chara=\r\ncter of GENJI)\n&gt; \n&gt; Everything I&#39;ve seen says that the various branches (ma=\r\nny GENJI, \nonly\n&gt; one branch of HEISHI) were disinherited (made &#39;commoners&#39;=\r\n [read\n&gt; &#39;non-imperial nobility&#39;]) meaning they and their descendants could=\r\n \nnot\n&gt; ascend to the throne mainly to help cut down on the number of\n&gt; suc=\r\ncession disputes within the Imperial family.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were several usurpa=\r\ntions/coups that appear in history, but \none\n&gt; of the requirements has alwa=\r\nys seemed to have been the rank of\n&gt; &#39;Prince&#39;.  There were actually a separ=\r\nate series of ranks for \nPrinces\n&gt; apart from the &#39;common&#39; nobility to dist=\r\ninguish these members of \nthe\n&gt; Imperial family.  The usual way around this=\r\n was to marry your\n&gt; daughters into the Imperial line, and thus govern as t=\r\nhe \ngrandfather,\n&gt; father, or uncle of the emperor.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d say one of the=\r\n first attempts to possibly replace the Emperor, \nor\n&gt; at least attain stat=\r\nus as an Imperial prince, was that of Soga no\n&gt; Emishi, who seems to have t=\r\nried to elevate his own son to such a\n&gt; position (that may be Fujiwara prop=\r\noganda, of course).  Later, the\n&gt; Fujiwara gain control by marrying their d=\r\naughters into the Imperial\n&gt; line, creating &#39;Fujiwara&#39; emperors (emperors d=\r\nescended from the\n&gt; Imperial and Fujiwara lines).  Part of their power base=\r\n came from\n&gt; being directly related with the sovereign.  In a similar vein,=\r\n the\n&gt; insei government of retired emperors was based largely on them \nbein=\r\ng\n&gt; the previous emperors and father or grandfather to the current\n&gt; empero=\r\nr.  It wasn&#39;t too far a step for Kiyomori to envision himself\n&gt; and his des=\r\ncendants in a similar position, because by his time this\n&gt; *was* the accept=\r\ned means of obtaining power.\n&gt; \n&gt; That was partly what was so remarkable ab=\r\nout Yoritomo;  he really \nset\n&gt; up a warrior government, while Kiyomori, th=\r\ne bridge between \ncourtier\n&gt; and warrior, appears to have been trying to mo=\r\ndel more on the court\n&gt; government of the day.  Yoritomo even moved most of=\r\n the real\n&gt; administration out to Kamakura, isolating himself, to an extent=\r\n, \nfrom\n&gt; the court nobility.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu is another interesti=\r\nng character.  He came the\n&gt; closest to really doing away with the Imperial=\r\n power, becoming\n&gt; recognized as &#39;King of Japan&#39; by China, but his descenda=\r\nnts ceded \nmuch\n&gt; of their power to the daimyo and the emperor.\n&gt; \n&gt; The im=\r\nperial family does seem to have remained on the throne since \nat\n&gt; least th=\r\ne 6th century, though before that I believe the Kojiki and\n&gt; Nihongi (aka N=\r\nihon Shoki) are considered less reliable from an\n&gt; historical point of view=\r\n, since dates in them don&#39;t always \ncorrespond\n&gt; to dates of their contempo=\r\nraries on the mainland, who were keeping\n&gt; more meticulous records at the t=\r\nime.  Combine that with the \nincredible\n&gt; symmetry of the early histories o=\r\nf dates of numerological \nimportance,\n&gt; and it becomes a matter of debate b=\r\nefore then.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Josh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
