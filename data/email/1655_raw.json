In the end, 37,000 \ndefenders were killed.\n\nSome people don&#39;t count Shimabara, as it involved peasants fighting as \nwell, and the structure of the defenders was a bit nebulous.\n\nIf one doesn&#39;t count Shimabara, the last samurai warfare is usually \nconsidered the Osaka Winter and Summer campaigns of 1614-1615, when the \nforces of Tokugawa Ieyasu (now the retired sh�gun), laid two sieges to \n�saka Castle to bring down the remnants of the Toyotomi family.\n\nThe really last battles, though, were in the brief B�shin War of 1868, \nwhich was the war of Imperial Restoration. It wasn&#39;t much of a war, but \nit was fought between samurai houses supporting either the shogunate or \nthe Imperial government.\n\nTony\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
