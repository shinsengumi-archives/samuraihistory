A Japanese historical\n&gt; novel called &quot;Musashi&quot; was published in the 30&#39;s and is also avilable\n&gt; in English. I believe that Inagaki&#39;s movie is based on this novel.\n&gt; Last I heard, there is relatively little authoritatively available\n&gt; about Musaashi&#39;s life. He is generally believed to have fought on the\n&gt; loosing side of Sekigaraha and both battles of Osaka Castle, but to\n&gt; have later served the Tokugawa&#39;s during the Shimabara no Ran (1637-8).\n&gt; There are a number of artifacts especially paintings and calligraphy\n&gt; which are attributed to him. Please do not try to use the traditions of\n&gt; modern martial ryuha to document Musashi. Lots of these groups claim\n&gt; descent from him, but there is often little to show that this descent\n&gt; is really authentic.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
