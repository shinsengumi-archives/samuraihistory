Could you please double check\nit?\n\n      Thanks.\n\n  Bob Burke\n\n  In a message dated 3/24/05 12:20:58 AM, knorr31@... writes:\n\n  &lt;&lt;\n\n  Dear Group:\n  Hi, I came across a battle scroll of the Japanese and\n  Korean Naval war during the Imjin War.(1592-98)\n  The picture was drawn by a Japanese painter. An exact\n  source and names could I not find it. But, I found the\n  picture at\n  http://www.dkbnews.com/img/2005/03/123/w1.jpg.\n\n  The picture is pretty accurate in a description of the\n  weaponery and battle uniforms of two countries during\n  the war.\n\n  This picture describes the battle where Admiral Lee\n  Sun-Shin defeated 136 ships with only 12 ships\n  immediately after a major defeat of the Korean Navy\n  under another Korean Admiral with Admiral Lee himself\n  imprisoned due to the political attack against him.\n\n  Although I am origianlly a Korean national and am\n  planning to become an American citizen, I personally\n  admire the Japanese culture and outstanding martial\n  tradition.\n  Japanese and Koreans are most close relative to each\n  other linguistically, culturally, and ethnically.\n  I do believe that the prosperity of two countries and\n  the stability of the North East Asia depends on how\n  Japan and Korea cooperate and support each other\n  because of their geographical proximity and ecnomic,\n  poltical, and military interdependence.\n\n  The past is the past. What lies ahead is our future\n  and the future of our next generation.\n\n\n\n\n                       Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                       Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n  __________________________________________________\n  Do You Yahoo!?\n  Tired of spam?
