I&#39;ve heard that european blades are\n&gt; difficult to come by in good condition due to oxidation from constant\n&gt; handling.\n\nWell, not really. Remember that the sword-carrying culture of the medieval\nmindset went away in the 16th century in Europe, but only about 150 years\nago in Japan. Japan also had the advantage of 250 years of peace to turn\nswords from tools into simple art. Japan also had a tradition of donating\narmour and weapons to temples and shrines, who then preserved the offerings.\nEurope had no such tradition that protected things. If things in Europe\nweren&#39;t kept in the local castle or family attic, they went away.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I had heard the similar story about the samurai sword only being\n&gt; drawn to taste blood... so I&#39;m curious, as this was the explaination\n&gt; (albiet misinformed) for the condition of samurai swords.\n\nWouldn&#39;t work. If anything, after being bloodied a sword has to be cleaned\nor it&#39;ll start rusting *really* fast. Remember, the reason for blood is to\nget oxygen through the body. Blood is a *great* oxidization agent.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I do realize that the samurai regaurded their blades more highly than\n&gt; any European blade (even x-caliber).  The famous grass cutter and\n&gt; other blades are the holy grails of Samurai Myth & Legend.  I also\n&gt; know that if a blade is inspected they have a very special method\n&gt; (almost cermonial) to preserve the blade after inspection.\n\nNot really, there are just &quot;things they do.&quot; Things like holding paper in\none&#39;s mouth to deflect one&#39;s breath away from the blade (moist breath is\ngreat for oxidizing blades, too).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you tell us exaclty why Samurai blades have survived so long with\n&gt; so little oxidation?\n\nBecause people take care of them. They clean them regularly. That&#39;s it. No\nsecrets, no tricks.\n\n&gt; Or you can tell me that I&#39;m on crack and\n&gt; everything I just said was also misinformed.  You are the expert.  I\n&gt; trust anything you would tell us more than any other western souce.\n\nI appreciate the vote of confidence, but armour is really my specialty. &lt;G&gt;\n\nTony\n\n\n"
