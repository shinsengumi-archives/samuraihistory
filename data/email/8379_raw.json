If anything, he was the ultimate\npragmatist.\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; The way they were thinking and planning was a\n&gt;&gt; &quot;fruit&quot; of their&#39;s commitment to martial arts. By\n&gt;&gt; the way, it wasn&#39;t only a martial art but the way\nof\n&gt;&gt; thinking. \n&gt;&gt;   Matt\n\n&gt;Spoken like you subscribe to &quot;Martial Arts\n&gt;Illustrated&quot;. Look, I&#39;m not saying that martial arts\n&gt;experience wouldn&#39;t have aided a decision or two, but\n&gt;it&#39;s ridiculous to say that Shinkage-ryu, or any\n&gt;martial art, was the basis of the Tokugawa political\n&gt;construct. Inspired politician, great leader, and\ngood\n&gt;general--Tokugawa was all of these. Mystical martial\n&gt;arts warrior king? Not so much. Considering at the\nend\n&gt;of his life he was fairly fat, I&#39;m not sure he did\n&gt;much training beyond the &quot;tempura-do&quot; school. \n\nI&#39;ve been lurking for the most part in this forum, but\nthis topic drove me out of the shadows :)\n\nJapan was an extremely rich country. Its many feudal\nlords could field armies greater in size than most\ngreat European powers of the time could. Also, the\nvarious religious sects had great influence and\nstrength, which could rival those all-too powerful\ndaimyos. It was importing advanced, and therefore\nexpensive, weaponry (matchlocks, cannons, breast-plate\narmour) all the way from Europe. Its lords were\nfinancing the construction of massive strongholds and\nfortifications.\n\nMy opinion is that Togukawa Ieyashu chose to counter\nthis by making everyone poor. He confiscated and took\nunder direct (appointing daikan) or indirect (through\nthe hatamoto families) bakufu control the most\nstrategically and economically important lands, he\novertaxed the rest of the daimyo, and he came up with\nan ingenious hostage system, which also strained\ngreatly the finances of the daimyo. They had to\nmaintain two residences (double expenses), travel to\nand from Edo according to a very strict and luxurious\nprotocol, etc. Plus they had two counselors (Edo- and\nKano-Karo), which were usually the actual rulers of\ntheir particular domain (Edo estate or Han), and often\nconspired against each other.\n\nIn order to cope with the above, the daimyo had in\nturn to overtax their serfs. So the economically\nstrangled daimyo were in turn doing the same to their\npopulations, thus doing the job of the bakufu\nthemselves.\n\nAlso, another important factor might have been the way\nthe bakufu was able to benefit financially from the\npricing of rice. It was paying its retainers in rice,\nthe rice merchants bought that cheap, and later on\nsold it expensive, paying adequate taxes to the\nbakufu, while at the same time samurai, peasants, and\neven jikisan retainers were strugling with poverty.\n\nAs it&#39;s been pointed out before &quot;It&#39;s the economy,\nstupid!&quot;\n\nThodoris\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
