Then 20\nyears later when some people have done serious\nresearch to fix the problem you get sites like\nwww.entertheninja.com sprouting up and sites made by\n15 year old school boy wannabe ninja&#39;s and every one\nreads these and they must be real - I mean why would\nany one make a false web page.\n\nThe truth of the matter is Iga and Koga were the main\nareas of development. some fo these &#39;clans&#39; did sell\nthesleves out per contract, then there were some\nschools that were created within a samurai domain and\nwas either made up of samurai or peasents. picked for\ncertain skills they had or were told to develop. many\nof these schools survived for several generation many\nwere only in existance for a small number of years. \n\nsome of them did have codes of ethics, some didnt.\nsome used there skills to be cat burglers, after all\nsome ninjutsu skills required the skill to enter a\nbuilding and escape unseen. Then you have the ninja\nthat were information gatherers. Kagemusha by kurosawa\nis a great film to see this. there is a scene where 3\nmen are watching the samurai army. All dressed in\ncommon every day cloths watching from a distance. all\nfrom different clans. some of these guys couldnt even\nfight properly other than the same skills of the\neveryday man or samurai. and before any one asks.\nNinja did not run around wearing black suits with\nmasks. That is a Meiji period Myth.\n\nLook at a street scene out of a kurosawa movie.\nImagine someone dressed in pure black in the middle of\nthat. he would be as moticeable as if he were naked.\nthe men in kagemusha are a good example of the way\nNinja dresssed.\n\nSome records by ninja have survived - Shoninki -\nNinpiden - Bansenshukai. Translation example are\navailable from www.ninpo.org\n\npaul\n\n\n\n--- dnastaj &lt;dnastaj@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nWeren&#39;t some ninja&#39;s (shinobi?) servants of hans?

Since\ndiscovering \nRurouni \n&gt; &gt; Kenshin we have been amazed at the attention to\nhistorical fact \n&gt; &gt; involved with this series. We have just started\nbecoming \n&gt; interested \n&gt; &gt; in the Samurai histories but can find no info on\nthis group of \n&gt; &gt; misunderstood Samurai. Any help will be\nappreciated and \n&gt; reciprocated. \n&gt; &gt; Kei and I are somewhat of an expert on anime in\ngeneral and \nLovely \n&gt; &gt; Angels/Dirty Pair in particular as well as romanji\nscript in \n&gt; Japanese \n&gt; &gt; and its English translations.
