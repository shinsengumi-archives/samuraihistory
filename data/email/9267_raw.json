Before the 1590&#39;s,\nthat would be a complete fallacy. Even during the Edo\nperiod, commoners were allowed to carry personal\nprotection weapons, to include short swords. \n\nAny samurai\n&gt; who wished to test out his new shinken or (real\n&gt; sword),for a price\n&gt; could cut down a criminal who had been caught as\n&gt; Japan had no prisons.\n\nJapan most definitely had prisons. Not sure where the\nhell you came up with that one.\n\n&gt; Death was the customary punishment for every\n&gt; offense. Sometimes\n&gt; samurai would cut down innocent people to test their\n&gt; steel if no one\n&gt; was looking but this was most likely not the norm.\n\n&quot;Me? No, I didn&#39;t cut that guy down...you didn&#39;t see\nme, did you? Nope, wasn&#39;t me...&quot;\n\n\n&gt; Samurai means to\n&gt; serve and a samurai was also called bushi being the\n&gt; plural or bujin\n&gt; for one of them. \n\n&quot;bushi&quot; isn&#39;t the plural of &quot;bujin&quot;. Japanese has no\nplural or singular--the plural of &quot;bushi&quot; is &quot;bushi&quot;,\nthe singular of &quot;bushi&quot; is &quot;bushi. Plural or singular\nis determined by context or counters. \n\n Guns were introduced by the\n&gt; first europeans\n&gt; but not given or sold to them one man made a sketch\n&gt; of one of the guns\n&gt; and within 6 months there were guns aplenty.\n\nWow, this is so wrong it&#39;s not even funny. There&#39;s no\npossible way that someone who&#39;d never seen one before\ncould make a sketch of an arquebus and then create\none. The swordmaker of the lord of Tanegashima island,\nwhere the first Portuguese landed and demonstrated\nfirearms, aquired several arquebuses, and was able to\ndo everything except figure out how to seal the\nbarrel. For the secret to this, he traded his daughter\nto a Portuguese merchant. \n\n\n The\n&gt; samurai adopted their\n&gt; use for a short time until they were considered\n&gt; dishonorable and the\n&gt; samurai abandoned there use willingly.\n\nGod, no. No, no, no, no, and no. &quot;Dishonorable&quot; had\nnothing to do with anything. \n\n The use of a\n&gt; jo or staff was\n&gt; the weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and\n&gt; the main weapon of\n&gt; the lower class to defend against the samurai.\n\nUm, no. \n\n Then\n&gt; there were the\n&gt; Ninja. \n\nStop. I can&#39;t even begin to read the idiocy you write\nhere. Go to the link I posted, go read the section on\nninja. You&#39;ve managed to post every single myth and\nHollywood fantasy possible here, congrats. \n\nThey employed many\n&gt; dishonorable tactics and\n&gt; devices including throwing venomous snakes on their\n&gt; foes. \n\nHmm...that&#39;s a new one. \n\nSamurai\n&gt; would stand and state their name and such before\n&gt; fighting in duels\n&gt; which usually lasted 30 seconds or less.\n\nYes, Samurai stated their names and lineage prior to\nbattle...a practice that died out before 1300, because\nit was completely impractical. This ended essentially\nduring the Mongol invasions, since those nasty Mongols\ndidn&#39;t play nice and simply shot the brave Samurai in\nthe middle of his introduction speech. \n\nNinja did\n&gt; not and snuk around\n&gt; and disguised themselves and such. Ninja were more\n&gt; effective in combat\n&gt; than most samurai though and usually acted alone.\n&gt; Slaying a sleeping\n&gt; army and other similar antics. \n\nSlaying a sleeping army? At once? Wow, those ninjers\nare Kool. \n\nHonor meant\n&gt; everything to the samurai\n&gt; and they would not hesitate to commit hara kiri done\n&gt; with the\n&gt; wakizashi one would stick the blade into his gut\n&gt; with the goal of\n&gt; cutting the spine from the front then another would\n&gt; end his suffering\n&gt; with a beheading. Someone the former had chosen to\n&gt; assist him in\n&gt; restoring his honor.\n\nYup, I saw in a comic book that some samurai called\nhis friend by the wrong name, so to atone he cut his\nown stomach right then and there, without even\nthinking about it. Those samurai were always\ncommitting suicide...\n\nNo. And....no. \n\n A samurai could probably take\n&gt; down a charging\n&gt; bull but I would not expect the could have tussled\n&gt; succesfully with a\n&gt; grizzly bear. \n\nActually, many samurai were successful economically,\nin both the prosperous and lean times...\n\n...or did you really mean to give your opinion vis a\nvis various animals? &#12414;&#12387;&#12383;&#12367;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
