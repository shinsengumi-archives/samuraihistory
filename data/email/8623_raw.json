It \nsure as\n&gt; &gt; hell wasn&#39;t like these neat roam-mat dojos we=\r\n have today. They \nwere\n&gt; &gt; fighting in the mountains, on riverbanks, tripp=\r\ning over tree \nroots\n&gt; &gt; and stones. The weapons they used, swords... spear=\r\ns... arrows...\n&gt; &gt; anything! You didn&#39;t even opponent would be on foot he c=\r\nould have\n&gt; &gt; came at you on horseback! How effective would any of our fanc=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; modern sword styles have been, back then? While we were still \nedging=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; our toes forward gauging the distance between our swords... some\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nrmored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with his spear!&quot;\n&gt; \tTraining i=\r\nn the sword these days, at least with Iaido, is \nprimarily  \n&gt; training for=\r\n encounters in an urban setting against one or a \nhandful  \n&gt; of attackers.=\r\n If you are perceptive enough one can winnow out the  \n&gt; core combative tec=\r\nhniques that would apply in a battlefield \nencounter.\n&gt; \tWe may train on fl=\r\nat level ground, most days, but what we \nare  \n&gt; building is a foundation f=\r\nor a proper cut delivered with all the  \n&gt; strength of the bodys&#39; musculatu=\r\nre behind it. Technique discovered \non  \n&gt; the battlefield, but refined for=\r\n generations by serious swordsmen.\n&gt; \tIt is easy enough to train in differe=\r\nnt settings, changing \nelements  \n&gt; like adding overhead obstructions, even=\r\n so the &quot;programming&quot; \nshould  \n&gt; kick in and in spite of the obstruction t=\r\nhe best possible strike \nwill  \n&gt; be delivered.\n&gt; \tThere are schools like t=\r\nhe Yagyu Shingan ryu that practice  \n&gt; battlefield technique in armour, The=\r\nir forms include strikes to \nthe  \n&gt; vulnerable areas of Japanese armour an=\r\nd grappling. I am certain \nthey  \n&gt; practice most of the time on flat level=\r\n ground and probably use \nfoam  \n&gt; mats too. Few if any would argue that th=\r\ney are not authentic.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;       &quot;And there are fools out there looking f=\r\nor spirityuality in\n&gt; &gt; the sword. Four hundred sword schools had opened up=\r\n with a few \nyears\n&gt; &gt; of the founding of the shogunate. Four hundred! But =\r\nthat didn&#39;t \nmean\n&gt; &gt; swordsmanship was flourishing, it just means a lot of=\r\n bored \nsamurai\n&gt; &gt; are selling their skills to buy rice. They can&#39;t offer =\r\ncontent so\n&gt; &gt; they babble about spirit. And to keep other schools from ste=\r\naling\n&gt; &gt; their students--their moneybags--they cooked up useless &quot;secret\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; techniques&quot; just so they&#39;ed look different from other schools. Oh\n&gt; &gt; an=\r\nd god forbid those moneybags get hurt! Oh, no, it&#39;s face-\nguards!\n&gt; &gt; Glove=\r\ns! Body Armor! Light Bamboo Swords! So what do you wind up\n&gt; &gt; with? Peacet=\r\nime warriors who have never faced a naked blade; felt\n&gt; &gt; the fear of death=\r\n!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \tI believe that schools of swordsmanship followed similar \npaths of=\r\n  \n&gt; development in other places. Combat techniques were refined and  \n&gt; st=\r\nylized and the mystique of the swordsman grew in importance. I  \n&gt; think if=\r\n you&#39;ll look deeply into the questions you raise here \nyou&#39;ll  \n&gt; see that =\r\namong the 400 and more schools you mention that many have \nno  \n&gt; spiritual=\r\n connections and teach only technique. Most place an  \n&gt; emphasis on etique=\r\ntte as a means to guarantee  safety within the  \n&gt; dojo. However there are =\r\nthose that focus deeply on the teachings \nof  \n&gt; zen buddhism or connexions=\r\n to Shinto gods. After-all many of the  \n&gt; great swordsmen at the end of th=\r\ne age of battles developed their  \n&gt; mastery in pursuit of spiritual develo=\r\npment. I am not really sure \nhow  \n&gt; it is a bad thing to wish to behave in=\r\n a gentlemanly fashion and \nto  \n&gt; seek to enrich ones spirit.\n&gt; \tThere are=\r\n good and bad teachers, and unscrupulous people in \nall  \n&gt; ages. You have =\r\nto choose your path carefully in all things. If \nyou  \n&gt; have lived in Japa=\r\nn then you will be familiar with the surprising  \n&gt; number of frauds and wa=\r\nnnabees there, samurai culture is a \ncommodity  \n&gt; to some, even in the lan=\r\nd of the samurai.\n&gt; \tIt seems that you have a poor opinion of Kendo as well=\r\n. One \ncould  \n&gt; argue that many Kendo-ka today lack the spirit and physica=\r\nl \ntoughness  \n&gt; of the swordsmen of say the rough and tumble Bakumatsu per=\r\niod.  \n&gt; However if lyou ook closely at the practice today the top Kendo-\nk=\r\na  \n&gt; demonstrate more speed, power and technique than has been seen  \n&gt; be=\r\nfore. The rules and technique have been refined, and the \nathletes  \n&gt; groo=\r\nmed from childhood, in the same way as world-class sports  \n&gt; figures. Just=\r\n as todays football players run, hit and throw \nbetter  \n&gt; than players pas=\r\nt, todays top level Kendo-ka are arguably faster,  \n&gt; keener and stronger t=\r\nhan their predecessors.\n&gt; \tOne wonders where Ijin you have faced a naked bl=\r\nade and the \nfear of  \n&gt; death? There is death everywhere even if we don&#39;t =\r\ngo about toting  \n&gt; swords any longer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;       I posted this to show o=\r\nne reason the samurai became weak \nand\n&gt; &gt; the martial art people in the gr=\r\noup. I&#39;d like to hear what you \nthink\n&gt; &gt; about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIf you know your =\r\nhistory, you will know that throughout the \nperiod  \n&gt; we suppose the samur=\r\nai as a class became weak, there were \nelements  \n&gt; within it that studied =\r\nwestern science and military technology. \nThese  \n&gt; men and their students =\r\nemerged as leaders with the strength of \nideas  \n&gt; to oppose western encroa=\r\nchment even as the upper structure of \nsamurai  \n&gt; society was collapsing.\n=\r\n&gt; \tIn the world of swordsmanship also, there were fads and \nfashions but  \n=\r\n&gt; it seems that the practical won out in the end; Jigen Ryu, \nHokushin  \n&gt; =\r\nItto Ryu and Eishin Ryu are known to us because their techniques \nwere  \n&gt; =\r\ntested in the streets of Kyoto and on the battlefields of the  \n&gt; restorati=\r\non war.\n&gt; \tMany of the restoration leaders were dojo mates or known to \neac=\r\nh  \n&gt; other from fencing cicles. So when the time came for strength, \nfor  =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;men of spirit&quot; to lead the country they were to be found among \nthe  \n&gt;=\r\n martial artists...\n&gt; -t\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction c=\r\nontest:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Samurai A=\r\nrchives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: http:/=\r\n/www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!
