They are done that way to conceal from the general public, but some will reveal the edges of their tattoos when it suits their purpose to let it be known that they are Yakuza.\n \nIt is commonly known that Yakuza will sometimes gather in just loin cloth, revealing their extensive tattoo work among themselves. Sort of a secret fraternity ritual if you will for lack of better description.\n \nTattooing in general has long been looked down upon in Japan because of it&#39;s criminal association, however today many Japanese young people are getting tattoos, but not in the traditional Japanese style of large artistic pieces, but interestingly getting small individual western style tattoos, they call this &quot;won pointo&quot;  transliteration for &quot;one point&quot; tattoo.\n \nI do have a few pictures of Yakuza in full body tattoos if anyone would care to see, email me.\n \nRegards,\nJimi Tatu\n\n\nDate: Wed, 03 Dec 2003 23:34:40 -0000\nFrom: &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; \nSubject: Re: Digest Number 652\n\nSo this yamaguchi group just roams about japan showing everyone that \nthey are part of a yakuza with their body tattoos?\n\nMiburo\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
