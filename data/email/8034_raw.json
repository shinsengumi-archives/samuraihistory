They\nare of course, very good for Iai-do and I =\r\nhear (although I have no personal\nexperience) that they are improving in qu=\r\nality. I even hear that certain\nmukansa level Japanese swordsmiths are regu=\r\nlarly visiting Shanghai and\nteaching the making of Japanese swords to local=\r\n craftsmen, presumably for\ncommercial considerations.\n\nHowever, the point t=\r\nhat I am struggling to make is that Chen swords are in\nno way comprable to =\r\nfine swords from the pre Meiji period or even the hand\nmade swords from pos=\r\nt Meiji jidai. These swords are known, because of their great beauty, as To=\r\nken Bijutsu and those of particular historical or\ncultural importance are o=\r\nf great value. There is, therefore, a world of\ndifference between the more =\r\npractical swords of Paul Chen and &quot;real&quot;\nJapanese swords. I just think that=\r\n it is importanat that those who buy\nChinese made Japanese swords, if that =\r\nis not a contradiction in terms, are\nlabouring under no illusions.\n\nI write=\r\n the above in answer to James&#39;s question But if its not the best or a top l=\r\nevel one what is?
