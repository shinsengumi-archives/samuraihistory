I\nthink the study of Iaido is very important to the deeper understanding of\n the martial arts. The selection of the proper Iaito is important. Not\nquite so important as the selection of Shinken for tamashigiri, but\nnearly so. As Mr. Helm suggested Bob Elder is a great source. He is a go\ndan in Toyama Ryu Batto Jutsu. Has his own Dojo. Holds the only Batto Tai\nKai outside Japan and owns a martial arts store. We have been friends for\nmany years and will treat you right. He has the selection and pricing\nwith the knowledge to help you very much. He can be reaced at\nwww.ecmas.com or email him at www.ecmas@....\nHope this is some help to you.\nTom Armour\n\n________________________________________________________________\nThe best thing to hit the internet in years - Juno SpeedBand!\nSurf the web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!\nOnly $14.95/ month - visit www.juno.com to sign up today!\n\n"
