Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; You really are missing the point. I *would* expect\n&gt; people to have doubts about \n&gt; the quality of that video. I WOULD expect people to\n&gt; avoid it.\n&gt; \n&gt; BECAUSE ONE OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IS *SUSPECT* it\n&gt; makes the WHOLE PROJECT one \n&gt; of &quot;no one knows how\n&gt; accurate/valuable/reliable/trustworthy it is.&quot;\n\nTony, I hate to say it, but people are going to keep\nmissing the point. It appears, with a few exceptions,\nthat on this topic we&#39;re going to stay divided into\ntwo camps: the historians, and the martial artists. As\nlong as everyone recognizes where they belong, then we\ncan move on. \n\nMe? I&#39;m a skeptic--that&#39;s my nature. If I saw a\ndocumentary on Korean/Japanese history  that listed\nWong-Tak Hong as a source, I&#39;d avoid it like the\nplague simply based on that. Of course it&#39;s entirely\npossible that he&#39;s simply the &quot;dissenting view&quot; in the\ndocumentary and that more credible historians are\ngiven the lion&#39;s share of the screen time, but even\nacknowledging him as a small source is extremely\nquestionable. Same with Hayes. \n\nThis may end up being a great documentary, with Hayes\nas a minor player--fine, and good for it. However, if\nit wants viewership in the larger history community,\nand not just in the martial arts community, then\nsources like Hayes are a detriment. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
