If this is the way to be politicians, lets go to\nnuclear disarm using the surplus for wipe out all the muslim countries\nconcerned. Is this you means as &#39;&#39;political statement&#39;&#39; ?\nIt was a massacre of innocent people. And blood call blood.\nIf terrorists do not stop themselves, nor Israeli neither USA have to\nstop bombing. The problem is to properly choose the target avoiding the\nsame atrocities. When muslim will stop to consider medieval doctrine as\na must for the today&#39;s world, we will stop to consider B2B and Merkava\nas a solution. \n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: Chris Danyael X [mailto:danyael_x@...] \nInviato: domenica 8 giugno 2003 18.42\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: [samuraihistory] Seriously OT: The concept of Evil...\n\n\nI beg to differ.\n\nThey are not evil. Just plain stupid in my view.\nI dont belive in pure/diluted evil. I think that is a figment of the\nchristian church imagination.\nHitler was insane, yes. He hurt/killed alot of people and suronded\nhimself with people of the same belief. \n\nBesides, there is no really good definition on what evil is.\nIs one Evil for wanting to kill some one?\nIs one Evil for wanting world domination?\nIs one Evil for wanting to make money at any cost?\nIs one Evil for wanting to hurt someone ?\n\nBut what about the reason of these desires?\nWhat is the cause of them? And what will be the effect of them?\n\nDuring the mideval ages, Evil was everyone who opposed the church, since\nthey were in liason with the devil. If you said something that differd\nfrom the church doctrin, say the earth is not the center of the univers,\nor the earth is not flat. Then you were evil and in liason with the\ndevil. \nIf you were an unknown coutry with black/yellow/red/blue/green skin\ncolur, with unknown kultural standards and belief. You were evil\nheretics until you accepted jesus christ savior bla bla..\nUntil then you made good slaves, and colonies. Teh concept of Evil was\nused as a method of control.\n\nOne could say that the British Empire was Evil, for using Opium to force\nchina into submission.\n\n\nSome People I know say that USA is evil for interfering with other\nstates internal buissness.\nLike getting Noriega (he was a CIA operative, but defekted after he got\nelected) elected president and then assainated. USA put Pinochet into\npower, and as such made life a living hell for alot of people. \n\nThere are always a cause and an effect. This to is important to\nremember.\n \nTake the now famous 9/11 incident. \nThe most elaborate, complex and best executed guerilla opperaiton ever\npeformed by terrorists. Now why on earth would some one want to kill off\nfive to seven thousand people in a building? \nBasically to make a point. The terrorists didnt care about the people in\nthe buildings, that only came as a bounus. It was what those buildings\nrepresented that matterd. It was an awfull act, and persoanly I was in\nchock for three days. I have relatives in the states so naturally I was\nconcernd. \n\nWas that an evil act? If you ask the americans, it was definatly the\nultimate and purest Evil. But it was nothing but a political statement\nfrom a group of people who thinks that USA should butt out of their\ninternal buissness. \nI mean come on! Do you really think that the midle east is a new\nproblem? Hell no!\nIt has been a hodgepodge of assorted violence and territorial aggression\nfor over 5000 years. And the only difference now from then is that they\nhave the capacity to wipe each other out totally.\nThey are pissed off at the americans/allied for getting involved in a\nseveral thousand year old conflict, and were telling them, and any other\nnation that might get the idea to get involved to &quot;stay the fuck away&quot;\n(pardon my language). If you dont, we will make sure that you feel the\neffects of your actions in our home, at your home. \n\nSo the cause to ther 9/11 effect was all the acumulated actions the\nUSA/Allied had done in the past concentrated in one opretaion. \nThe effect after 9/11?\nUSA bombed two countries back to the darkages, and what to continue with\nIran.\nIs USA Evil for doing so? Oh no would most people say, they are only\ndefending themself from evil.\nYeah, but you have to considerd what the other side will say about this.\n\nThey say that they were defending themself from the ultimate purest form\nof Evil. Gerorge W Bush Junior the apostel of satan. Sounds familliar?\n\nNow, we are all friendly peacefull people, arent we?\n\nI say everything is a matter of point of view. And in most cases,\neconomics and religion are the major contributers to so called &quot;evil&quot;\nevents. And in a few cases insanity with a little help from economics\nand religon can end up in disatorus events. Like the world wars,\nTogukawa regime and emperor Xiang of china. The guy who united al of\nchina and built the great wall of china. He did kill a lott of people,\nwas a cruel bastard, and probably slightly YoYo in the head. But he did\nunite china, and gave it a very stable future. Evil or not? Point of\nview. \n(BTW, I have _no_ idea how to spell Xiang&#39;s name, I&#39;m guessing this is\ncorrect)\n\nThe other question we must ask ourself is this.\nDoes the means justify the goal?\nor does the goal justify the means?\nEmperor Xiang probably thought that if he united the people of what was\nto be &quot;China&quot;, a period of peace and prosperity would come. And the\ncountry would flourish in the fields of science and economics. But it\nwould all come at a high price. He aparently thought it was worth it.\n\nMy point in all of this rambling is this.\n1. Evil is a matter of point of view. \n2. History is written by those who survive and comes out on top of\nthings.\n3. Does the goal justefy the means, and does the means justify the goal.\n4. Evil is a word used to describe &quot;the others&quot; in a way to de humanise\nthe opposit side.\n\nAnd as such I do not belive in evil, deluted or pure, it does not matter\nfor it is all a point o view.\nFor it is all just the effect of a prior event. \n\n/// Chris the agnostic realist\n\n&quot;We are friendly peacfull people. we&#39;re not the ones out there causing\ntroubble&quot;\n-The streets &quot;Irony of it all&quot; (as I was saying it is just a point of\nview -C)\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Burker1@...
