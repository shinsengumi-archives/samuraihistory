It was also called the Kotetsu when it was first acquired as a \nTokugawa ship.  I have been researching this ship for about a year now, \nthough not as well as I possibly could considering my lack of being about to \nread Japanese (yet).  If you know anything about this ship please let me \nknow.  I would love to talk with you about it and swap notes.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMake the most of your family vacation with tips from the MSN Family Travel \nGuide! http://dollar.msn.com\n\n\n\n"
