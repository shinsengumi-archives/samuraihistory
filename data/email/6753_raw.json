If you had a link to a picture or something,\nit would be extremely helpful. \n\nIf anyone wants help translating something from\nJapanese, there are several of us (probably more than\nthat) that can help. But you&#39;ve got to set yourself up\nfor success--by just throwing the question out there,\nnot only do I now have to translate said banner, I&#39;ve\ngot to go looking for it, confirm it&#39;s the CORRECT\nbanner this person wants to know about, and then\ntranslate it. It may be as simple as me going to\ngoogle, typing in &quot;Ieyasu Banner&quot; and getting a\npicture. But if you really want your questions\nanswered, then you should do the legwork. This board\nisn&#39;t here to compensate for your laziness/lack of\neffort. There&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t go to Google, find\nwhat you&#39;re looking for, and then provide us the link\nto look at so we can help. \n\nThanks,\n\nThe Assistant Management.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
