What would be interesting would be to find an explanation as to how warfare and armies were structured in the pre-Samurai periods.  I am no expert on that aspect of society during that period, but I would suspect that blood and family ties would play more than a small part in this ordering. \n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:  \n\n--- Barbara Nostrand &lt;nostrand@...&gt; wrote:\n\nThe Nara and Heian periods are\n&gt; frequently viewed as sort of \n&gt; classical and may be viewed as ancient in the\n&gt; context of Japan. \n\nEven if you do consider Nara or Heian &quot;ancient&quot;, they\nare still outside the scope of the question asked,\nwhich was regading &quot;samurai armies&quot;. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
