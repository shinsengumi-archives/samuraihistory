Here is an excerpt:\n\n---------------------\n-JAMES starts to turn away.  HIROSHI finally speaks.\n\nHIROSHI\nOn the day of battle, a champion is chosen.  He rides ahead of his \narmy, meets the challenger of the enemy.  The victor brings great \nacclaim to himself, to his clan.  A dozen times I rode out as \nchampion, a dozen men I killed.  In only one contest did I know \nfear.  Our combat seemed to last an eternity, by the grace of some \ngod I prevailed...  I had never been more proud to be samurai, to \ntake an enemy&#39;s head.  I raised it high on my pike... Learned later \nthe warrior&#39;s son, a six-year old boy, had watched it all from the \ncastle walls.  That boy was Daigo Masakado.\n----------------------\n\nThat looks to me like something that would have been pretty much \noutdated even in the 15th century, let alone the 19th, and there is \nof course the obligatory trip to the geisha house.  There are lots \nof things like that - some things that make it little better than \nthe meiji-era samurai classic &quot;the barbarian and the geisha&quot;.  \nalthough, like I said, assuming this is truly an early version of \nthe script, I HOPE they would have worked out the most obvious \nproblems.  The first scene of the movie, if they keep it as I have \nhere, should be real good, though.  The battle scenes have potential \nto say the least.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; It&#39;s one thing when something &quot;wrong&quot; is done for\n&gt; cinematic effect. We all know that the Nagashino scene\n&gt; in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; isn&#39;t the way it really happened--the\n&gt; Takeda cavalry didn&#39;t die in a 9 minute span from\n&gt; rapid-fire Oda arqubusiers mowing them down like WWI\n&gt; German machine gunners against a British &quot;Over the\n&gt; Top&quot; Charge. But it fits the cinematic effect desired,\n&gt; so none of us complain about it. (And that&#39;s ignoring\n&gt; the red sky and all that, too)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m anticipating that this will not be the case--not\n&gt; with Tom Cruise in it. They&#39;ll mess something up.\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s just my natural bias against this time\n&gt; period, and the fact that I&#39;m sure that there will be\n&gt; a gaudy amount of talk about Bushido and honor and\n&gt; stereotypical crap, and that some of the language will\n&gt; be wrong, and the costumes, and other things that\n&gt; aren&#39;t hard to get right will be wrong...\n&gt; \n&gt; But, I will go and see it, and might be surprised. And\n&gt; I might like it, despite whatever is wrong. I&#39;m just\n&gt; not getting my hopes up. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
