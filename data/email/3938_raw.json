To me &quot;Musashi&quot; is the first set of sounds of a name of \na sumo heya (Musashigawa) and part of the shikona of the last yokozuna to \nretire (Musashimaru), and that was the only thing I associated it with.\n       To me, my top two choices (although they aren&#39;t necessarily my \nfavourites) would be 1. Hideyoshi and 2. Nobunaga.  Uesugi Kenshin, Takeda Shingen, \nAkechi Mitsuhide and Tokugawa Ieyasu would round out my top six, followed \nclosely by Shibata Katsuie and (maybe) Mori Motonari and Saito Dosan, but those two \nare stretches.\n       And thanx for the business reading recommendation.  I&#39;ll have to dig \nup the copy I typed out in college.  (And yes, I actually typed out Art of War \n-- word for blasted word -- as typing practice my freshman year for the hell \nof it.)  :-)\n       Take care, y&#39;all.  :-)\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
