I\n&gt;heard it is a good place to start.\n\nYou&#39;ll probably hear mixed reviews. Turnull is kind of one of the \naccepted &quot;gurus&quot;. I kind of like his &quot;Samurai Warfare&quot;. But at the \nsame time something about his style strikes me as somewhat flakey. I \njust have the feeling that his works are as popular as they are \nbecause there are hardly any other choices in English.\n\nIn other words, he&#39;s as good a place as any to get started - but \nthat&#39;s kind of faint praise.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
