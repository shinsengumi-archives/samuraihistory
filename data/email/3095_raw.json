The\nepisodes I saw I quite enjoyed, but that&#39;s partially\nbecause I found the contrast between the events\ndepicted there and how they were in &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; quite\namusing. Only saw one episode of &quot;Musashi&quot;, it was a\nsnorer, I thought. &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; will be interesting,\nif only because I&#39;m here.&quot;\n\nRight now I am watching &quot;Nobunaga&quot;, &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;, and &quot;Toshie to Matsu&quot;, back\nto back. It is quite interesting contrasting each series and how they\ndepicted each event. From February and March I can add &quot;Onna Taiko-ki&quot; and\n&quot;Tokugawa Ieyasu&quot; and see how they fare.\n\n\n\n"
