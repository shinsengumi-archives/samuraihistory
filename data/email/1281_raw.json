Although\n&gt; many historical structures were destroyed in WWII,\n&gt; there are still\n&gt; a number of castles that are more or less &quot;original&quot;\n&gt; construction,\n&gt; with a limited amount of restoration work over the\n&gt; years.  \n&gt; The most famous to westerners is Himeji, sometimes\n&gt; called\n&gt; the &quot;White Heron&quot; castle.   However there are many\n&gt; others, including\n&gt; my personal favorite, Inuyama, a tiny jewel of a\n&gt; castle on the Kiso River,\n&gt; north of Nagoya.\n&gt; \n&gt; andrea Smith wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have seen how the Japanese castles were built, I\n&gt; &gt; would like to see some pictures of some really\n&gt; amazing\n&gt; &gt; Japanese castles, like Osaka Castle. In 1614 and\n&gt; 1615,\n&gt; &gt; that castle I mentioned was invaded by Tokugawa\n&gt; Ieyasu\n&gt; &gt; before he died in 1616.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
