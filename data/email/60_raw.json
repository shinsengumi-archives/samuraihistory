Is anyone in a position to provide me with\n&gt; info on a good source to get me started?? \n\nYou could try the journal _The East_, Volume 5, # 1, 1969, which \nran an article entitled &quot;Crime and Punishment in Japan&quot;; likewise \nVolume 10, #7, 1974, which ran an article entitled &quot;Pre-Modern \nLaw and Tokugawa Political Structure&quot; (translated by A. Mitchell, \nfrom _Nihon Kindai Ho^shi Ko^gi_ [Lectures on Modern Japanese \nLegal History], published by Seirin Shoin Shinsha.  There were \nanother two articles published in the late 1970s (no date, I&#39;m sorry, \ncheck _The East_ Index, and unfortunately I only have a photocopy \nof part 1) entitled &quot;Criminal Trials in Edo&quot; which outlines precedent \nand procedure for criminal trials from the Kan&#39;ei era (1624-43) \nonwards.\n\nHope this is of some small assistance.\n\nRegards,\nDorian\n\n \n\n\n"
