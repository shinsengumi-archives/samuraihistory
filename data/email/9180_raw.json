However, these\n&gt; contrast in some ways with the character of a warrior culture. \n\nSince Japan&#39;s samurai class was a social class with many different \nlevels, entertainment varied but associating poetry or writing with \nbeing a sissy is a silly modern American thought. Lord Byron has a \nstatue in Greece erected to him not because he was a great poet but \nbecause he helped liberate Greece from the Turks. Musashi wrote books \nand was an excellent painter. Etc. Etc.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n"
