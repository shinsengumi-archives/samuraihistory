I had wondered why\n&gt; &gt; there were so many\n&gt; &gt; Minamoto and Taira in the history books, and it was\n&gt; &gt; a Wikipedia article\n&gt; &gt; on &#39;Minamoto&#39; that I was looking at earlier that\n&gt; &gt; stated that the name\n&gt; &gt; was honorary... proving once again to take all\n&gt; &gt; Wikipedia articles with a\n&gt; &gt; grain of salt...\n&gt;\n&gt; Interestingly enough, I had to go to a Wikipedia\n&gt; article to jog my memory on the Emperor the Taira were\n&gt; primarily descended from--I couldn&#39;t remember Kammu,\n&gt; for some reason.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wikipedia is great for fast, shallow knowledge, but\n&gt; you do need to take it with a grain of salt.\n&gt; Unfortunately, like many people here who have read a\n&gt; lot for pleasure but not for research, it&#39;d hard for\n&gt; me to remember where I read what :)\n&gt;\n&gt; When in doubt, I plead with Tony to give me a source.\n&gt; Or I just use him, and the blame goes his way.\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
