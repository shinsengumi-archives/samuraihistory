Even in the 16th century (which is the period I assume you\nare referring too) not all samurai were \nwarriors. Samurai were social elites, and during the numerous wars of\nthe the century that often saw them \nleading men on battlefields, but some samurai were far more useful as\nadministrators and would have rarely \nwielded a bow or yari in combat.\n \n&gt;Unlike Rome, the samurai, in particular before the edo period, prepared\nfor war constantly and were \n&gt;measured more byprowess in combat. \n \nWhile my knowledge of Roman history isn&#39;t great, I doubt that this is\ntrue. During Rome&#39;s Golden Age their\nlegions were famously well trained and disciplined. And again, not all\nsamurai prepared for war constantly,\nnor were they all necessarily particularly good at it.\n \n&gt;Yet, they didn&#39;t relish in bloodshed as much as their Roman\ncounterparts. There has to be some other \n&gt;examples. Drinking, womanizing, and gambling: I don&#39;t view these as war\nlike  entertainment because \n&gt;all males participate. I&#39;m sure wealth merchants endulged as much if\nnot more then the samurai.\n \nThe samurai were social elites. They drank, womanized, gambled, and all\nthe rest of those &quot;base&quot; activities. \nSome practiced archery and swordsmanship, others wrote poetry, performed\nplays, painted, went hawking, \nand did whatever was expected of their social status.\n \n-AngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
