Please review the daimyos of Hizen province, including Arima \n&gt; and Omura clans in the 16th Centure. It was the daimyo Omura who \n&gt; granted the Portugese Nagasaki port. And the ties with the Portugese \n&gt; in Nagasaki and Omura. There&#39;s even a St. Omura in the Catholic faith \n&gt; who is a canonized Saint.\n&gt;\n&gt;  You misread my message (or I miswrote the intention). Nobunaga was \n&gt; the daimyo in\n&gt;  the greatest position to do good things for the Christians. Yes, \n&gt; there were\n&gt;  daimyo in Kyushu and elsewhere who converted, but they had little \n&gt; effect outside\n&gt;  their own domains. Nobunaga was quite different in his sphere of \n&gt; influence.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Tony\n\nI think Nobunaga was interested in Christianity mainly for two reasons:\n1 - Guns. The Portuguese missionaries (and the merchants that arrived \nwith them) brought some, and promised more. I have even read somewhere \n(but not sure, perhaps the experts of this list can confirm) that \nNobunaga wore a Portuguese armor, at times.\n2 - Nobunaga hated organized Buddhism, not the religion or the \nphilosophy, but the &quot;Buddhist posse&quot; (the ikki). Christianity was thus \na convenient &#39;alternative.&#39;\nI really doubt Nobunaga was interested in the Christian ideals, \nnonetheless he seemed to have an interest for things from the West, \nespecially if they could give him a political-ideological or martial \nadvantage.\n\ncepo\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
