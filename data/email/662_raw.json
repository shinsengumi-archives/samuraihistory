So\nyou may be thinking, &#39;what&#39;s two or three years?&#39;  Well, what if I told you\nthe battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!\n&gt;\nThis is from page 27 of Japonius Tyrannus the bio of Nobunaga by Jeroen\nLamers:\n\n&quot;It has been unclear for a very long time in precisely which year exactly\nNobunaga took this mountain castle [Inabayama]. Matsuda Ryo, a local\nhistorian of Gifu Prefecture has convincingly argued that Nobunaga first\ncaptured Mount Inaba in 1564, lost it again to Tatsuoki in 1565, and finally\ntook possession of the castle in June 1567.&quot;\n\nHe cites the book &#39;Nobunaga no Mino koryaku-shi kenkyu&#39; by Matsuda Ryo for\nthis info.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
