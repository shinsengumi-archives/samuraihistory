Obviously the closer you are to the centres of power, the more=\r\n up\nto date your calendar, but if you&#39;re out in the sticks/mountains/island=\r\ns\netc...?\n\nYours\n\nDean\n \n\n&gt;    Yes, there was. Genroku 1 was proclaimed on =\r\nthe 30th day of the \n&gt;    ninth month of \n&gt;    Jokyo 5. Everything up to th=\r\nat date was Jokyo 5. Everything after \n&gt;    it was Genroku 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;    When t=\r\nhe last emperor died in 1989, you know 1989 was still the \n&gt;    Sh=F4wa Era=\r\n -- and \n&gt;    a few weeks later it became Heisei 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Surely you don&#39;t=\r\n think that eras change at midnight on Dec. 31. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Tony\n\n\n\n"
