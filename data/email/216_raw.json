I have the book and to me is very\ninteresting.the book tells you about the first\nwarriors which is the first chapter down to chapter\nnine which is  the samurai legacy. the chapters in\nbetween are  chapter 2 emergence of the samurai,\nchapter 3 the rise to power chapter 4 the mongol\ninvasions, chapter 5 the age of the country at war,\nchapter 6  the path to unification, chapter 7  from\nwarriors to bureaucrats, chapter 7 the black ships, my\ninterest in the book was to read about  Tokugawa \nIeyasu to me I think he was one of the best samurai\nthat lived. \n\n          thanking you for your time\n                J.
