For example master Funakoshi who developed the Shotokan style was from a long line of Samurai, he even wore the traditional top not as a sign of his heritage. I belong to the JKAE (japan karate association of england) master Funakoshi set up the JKA the first Karate association in the world. And if you go to www.jka.or.jp it will tell you that true Karate is derived from Bushido, the Dojo Kun and the 20 Precepts all come from Bushido, so I suggest you study more in the art of Karate and it&#39;s history.\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Elizabeth Chase \nwrote:\n\n&gt; Mmmmmmm Nathan, please forgive my own impertinence, \n&gt; but my understanding is that the unarmed (no martial\n&gt; weaponry) styles of \n&gt; defense were developed as general defensive\n&gt; techniques against all comers.\n\n\nImpertinence forgiven. The point is that it was\ndeveloped by peasants, not samurai, because the\npeasants had no weapons. What works against an armed\nsamurai would be effective against an unarmed\nassailant also, no? The original poster was asking\nabout samurai influence on unarmed martial arts forms.\nRather than being primary developers, they were\nprimary antagonists. (And now some &quot;expert&quot; will come\nin and assail me because unarmed techniques that were\nthe forerunners of Juujitsu, etc., were developed way\nback when for use if you lost your sword, or\nsomething. True. But the point is not the\ndetails--it&#39;s that for the most part, the samurai\nweren&#39;t injecting some mystical bushido into karate.)\n\n&gt; I realize it is fairly easy to take pot-shots at\n&gt; those who seem --- less literate--- than ourselves.\n&gt; I also grow impatient with \n&gt; people who wish to declare themselves, or seek, to\n&gt; be, samurai. However, it is possible to develop\n&gt; within ourselves the best of \n&gt; the samurai traits. It is far easier to be critical,\n&gt; but a challenge to our character to be educators and\n&gt; compassionate.\n\nI find myself being &quot;compassionate&quot; almost hourly on\nthis list. I&#39;ve never, ever questioned that you can\ndevelop traits consistent with the teachings of\nBushido, if you want. However, I also don&#39;t question\npeople who proclaim that &quot;all samurai followed\nbushido&quot; or &quot;all samurai were good&quot; or &quot;ninja and\nsamurai were mortal enemies&quot; or any crap like that. I\nsimply tell them they&#39;re wrong. And if they can&#39;t\nhandle their misconceptions being challenged, that&#39;s\nwhen the compassion tends to slip.\n\n&gt; Lastly, I find myself curious as to Mr. Wilson&#39;s age\n&gt; and educational level, whether he is dyslexic, and\n&gt; if English is a second or \n&gt; third language.\n\nMyself also. The Lord High Listmaster and myself (I am\nonly his trusty minion, with a very minor fief in an\noutlying area of the list) are working on a new rules\nlist, and one of those is a request that everyone, oh,\nI don&#39;t know, USE PUNCTUATION? It&#39;s one thing if\nEnglish is not your primary language--I can make\nallowances for that. However there are many posters on\nthis list who are not native English speakers and\nstill can make themselves intelligible. They use\npunctuation in most other languages, and it varies\nlittle. \n\n&gt; Just for the h-e-double-hockey-sticks of it..... how\n&gt; many of you &#39;play&#39; in the Society for Creative\n&gt; Anachronism...... if you do, do \n&gt; you pursue &#39;European&#39; or &#39;Asian/Japanese personas?\n&gt; (No, lol, I don&#39;t mean as in &#39;chase&#39; them...)\n\nI think many do, and many do both Asian and European\npersonae. Talk to Tony--he&#39;s the grand Poobah when it\ncomes to Japanese SCA. \n\nNate\n\n\n\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nMeet the all-new My Yahoo! - Try it today! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
