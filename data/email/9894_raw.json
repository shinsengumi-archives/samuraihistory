I&#39;ve thought of that parallel too.  In particular, there\nis=\r\n a similar type of &quot;lost cause&quot; romanticism about the Confederate Army\nand =\r\nSaigo&#39;s army.  Both Saigo and Lee revolted against the central\ngovernment, =\r\nbut both are now revered in prominent statues.  Both of them\nare thought of=\r\n as having high moral character, worthy of emulation.  And\nboth rebellions =\r\nfigure prominently in films and TV shows.  The Boshin\nWar is like the War o=\r\nf Independence, and the Satsuma Rebellion is like\nthe Civil War.  Saigo pla=\r\nyed both Washington and Lee, who were both from\nVirginia.\n\nJoe\n\n--- In samu=\r\nraihistory@yahoogroups.com, burker1@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve always seen paralle=\r\nls between the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877 and\nthe US\n&gt; Civil War, with Saigo=\r\n Takamori playing the role of the Japanese Robert\nE.\n&gt; Lee.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both wars r=\r\nesulted in each country having a strong central government.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; In a message dated 4/17/09 9:55:04 PM, joemaps@... writes:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am often struck by a number of parallels between US and Japane=\r\nse\n&gt; &gt; history. For example, the role of the Meiji Restoration leaders\nseem=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; analogous to the founding fathers of the US. Toshimichi Okubo\nstrikes=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; me as a Thomas Jefferson type of character. Saigo Takamori reminds\nme\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; of George Washington.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The analogies are not, of course, perfect=\r\n. But they are strong\nenough\n&gt; &gt; to be interesting. This evening I was comp=\r\naring the Battle of\n&gt; &gt; Sekigahara (East vs West) with the Battle of Gettys=\r\nburg (North vs\n&gt; &gt; South). These are the two key large domestic battles in =\r\nboth\ncountries&#39;\n&gt; &gt; histories. I was surprised to learn how close the troop=\r\n numbers\nwere.\n&gt; &gt; At Gettysburg, it was 93K (north) vs 71K (south). At Sek=\r\nigahara, it\nwas\n&gt; &gt; 88K (east) vs 81K (west). How coincidental that such an=\r\nalogous\nbattles\n&gt; &gt; had troop numbers that were so comparable!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **************\n&gt; Access 350+ FREE radio stations anytime from=\r\n anywhere on the\n&gt; web.
