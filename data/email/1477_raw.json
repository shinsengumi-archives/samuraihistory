Though you \n&gt; get points for not owning a car.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;i strongly believe in the way of the samurai\n&gt; &gt;and i choose to be a true samurai no matter what i\n&gt; &gt;must do, the way of a samurai in which i have\n&gt; &gt;attempted has made me feel a like i found were i\n&gt; &gt;belong and it means more to me than anything else\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;all of which ive learned in life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; You do realize that for most of history that samurai\n&gt; were \n&gt; warrior/soldiers that basically killed for their\n&gt; lords and later on were \n&gt; used to oppress the commoners. If that&#39;s something\n&gt; you think is cool, \n&gt; well hmmmmm. You may want to study up on\n&gt; Confucius/Zen/etc. Otherwise I \n&gt; suspect you will find this list of little use since\n&gt; we are interested in \n&gt; history and except for a few weekend play samurai I\n&gt; doubt that anybody \n&gt; here has your goal of being a samurai.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; this is tim heaton from jahladracul@...\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
