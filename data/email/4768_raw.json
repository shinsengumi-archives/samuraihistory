I&#39;m unsure about the level of stipend received by \npoorer samurai, but there are many stories of samurai being forced \nto literally sell their swords through poverty.\n\nI&#39;ve seen some claim of certain hatamoto being classified according \nto their income, but this would seem to vary from clan to clan, \nrather than being fixed across the board.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dean Wayland &lt;dean@t...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;ve just been reading my back messages, and I feel that \nalthough I\n&gt; understand why some folks feel the way they do about what they \nconsider\n&gt; as simplistic questions, that they were unduly harsh on the chap \nasking\n&gt; about daimyo. Remember, that sometimes it takes a little courage \nto post\n&gt; in a field where you know nothing, and receiving such a hostile\n&gt; reception can kill a budding interest in a subject stone dead. I \nwould\n&gt; suggest that if you feel a questioner&#39;s enquiry is not worthy of \nyour\n&gt; time and efforts to reply to, then, simply don&#39;t. Leave it to \nsomeone\n&gt; else, and if no one wishes to reply, so be it. Sometimes I find \ndealing\n&gt; with so-called &quot;simple&quot; questions makes me rethink my own \nassumptions\n&gt; about the knowledge that I &quot;think&quot; I have in the subject being\n&gt; considered, and thus helps me to master it:-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally to add a piece to Nate&#39;s answer re daimyo: the required \nincome\n&gt; during the Tokugawa shogunate or Edo era (1600-1868) to be \nconsidered as\n&gt; a daimyo was 10,000 koku. One koku was the amount of rice required \nto\n&gt; feed one person for one year, and served as a measure of wealth \nfor what\n&gt; was fundamentally an agricultural society. A koku is a fraction \nover 180\n&gt; litres of rice or about 300 pounds in weight. Will Adams, the first\n&gt; Englishman in Japan, in a letter dated 1611 recounted that he and \nhis\n&gt; crew were each given an income of &quot;2 pounds of rice a day&quot;, which \nis 2.4\n&gt; koku a year. IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income \nexceeding\n&gt; 1,000 koku, while the richest daimyo in the land Tokugawa Ieyasu, \nthe\n&gt; first of the Edo era shogun&#39;s had an income of over 4 million koku \na\n&gt; year!.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope the chap who posted has hung around to read this, if so I \nhope\n&gt; you find this stuff useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours\n&gt; \n&gt; Dean\n\n\n\n"
