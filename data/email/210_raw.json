Was there any elder brothers \nthat died in the insurrection/disturbance?\n\nAlso - in my readings i have found that it states that yoshitsune and \nyoritomo are half brothers. Is this fact? If so - does this make \nNoriyori Yoshitsunes half brother also?\n\nAny help would be appreciated! Thanx\n\n\n\n"
