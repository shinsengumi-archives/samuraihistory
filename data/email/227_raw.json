Although I am \ncertainly not sure about this...Perhaps &#39;Samurai&#39; should be applied to the \nwarriors of the Muromachi era onwards as their role here was clearly defined \nas being &#39;Vassal&#39; members of various clans, thus &#39;serving&#39; rather than \n&#39;uprising&#39; to control...But the point is uncertain. For me anyway! Sorry that \nI could not be more help!\n\n"
