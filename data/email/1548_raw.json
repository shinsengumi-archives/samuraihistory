The books show up in about a \nweek, and it is 1500 yen for shipping (to the USA).  Never had a \nproblem with them.  If you can read Japanese, it is no problem, if \nyou can&#39;t, it might take a few minutes to figure it out, but there is \nan english version of the page, it is just a matter of finding the \nlink.  It works just like amazon.com, but you have to create \nan &#39;identity&#39; for the amazon.co.jp - your amazon.com id doesn&#39;t \ntransfer.  but it has all the exact same functions as amazon.com - \npackage tracking, etc. The only possible problem you might come \naccross is that you need to be able to type the japanese into the \nsearch engine to find the japanese books you want.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Rob Broom &lt;robb@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Any suggestions for getting hold of any of these infamous Nihon \nGunzo\n&gt; Rekishi or copies, or a loan, I have asked various people but so \nfar no\n&gt; luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks and kind regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob Broom\n&gt; Warhammer Historical General Manager\n&gt; robb@g...\n&gt; www.warhammer-historical.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; \n&gt; Message: 1\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2003 09:56:09 -0000\n&gt;    From: &quot;shogun.uk&quot; &lt;shogun.uk@n...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Biography of Takeda Shingen\n&gt; \n&gt; The &quot;definitive&quot; bit may be a problem, I am not aware of one at \npresent (but\n&gt; then my Japanese is almost negligible!)!\n&gt; \n&gt; However the &quot;red&quot; series Nihon Gunzo Rekishi Series by Gakken have \nseveral\n&gt; volumes covering the two personalities.
