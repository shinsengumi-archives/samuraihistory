With \npride and reverence, he gripped the sharkskin handle and hel=\r\nd up the \nweapon capable of beheading a man in a swift motion.\n\nMacLardy is=\r\n the owner of Arise, an Asian antiques store that \nrecently moved to Colleg=\r\ne Park. The store houses thousands of relics \nfrom a culture MacLardy has g=\r\nrown to love.\n\nThe cluttered warehouse =97 hidden by an innocent-looking, b=\r\nuilding =97 \nhas everything from $5 silk candleholders to $6,000 seventeent=\r\nh-\ncentury Buddha statues, from a $20 small, ribbetting wood frog to \nthe s=\r\nword, which is worth $10,000.\n\nArise, which MacLardy has run for more than =\r\n20 years, mainly sells \nwholesale to museums, catalogues and antique shops,=\r\n but also boasts \nan impressive list of celebrity customers.\n\nHilary Duff, =\r\nafter noticing Madonna wear a kimono to the Grammys, \nfell in the love with=\r\n the Material Girl&#39;s dress and ordered her \npeople to contact Arise, said M=\r\nacLardy. Duff then purchased a \ndecorative blue-and-white kimono from Arise=\r\n, which she donned for \nthe Nickelodeon&#39;s Kid&#39;s Choice Awards in 2002.\n\nAri=\r\nse has also supplied furniture for sets of motion pictures and \nlocal plays=\r\n. The Harrison Ford movie Random Hearts exhibited a few \nfurniture pieces f=\r\nrom his warehouse, and MacLardy provided most of \nthe kimonos for the Arena=\r\n Stage&#39;s production of M. Butterfly.\n\nAll the kimonos are designed by MacLa=\r\nrdy and produced by his \nbusiness partner in India.\n\nHe purchases the other=\r\n rare and avant-garde merchandise through \nconnections in Japan, China and =\r\nIndonesia, and has it shipped back \nto his warehouse in 20- to 40-foot-long=\r\n containers.\n\n&quot;I like the fact that we provide a lot of jobs overseas. That=\r\n&#39;s \nimportant to us,&quot; said MacLardy, who has a background in public \nintere=\r\nst work. &quot;It&#39;s creative. We do a lot of different things, so \nit doesn&#39;t ge=\r\nt boring, and that&#39;s my personality. If I had wanted to \nget rich, I would =\r\nhave just done one thing.&quot;\n\nMacLardy first dabbled in the Asian antique bus=\r\niness as part of a \nfund-raising kimono sale for a food co-op he owned. His=\r\n interest in \nAsian culture began with books and television shows.\n\n&quot;I got =\r\ninto it from the James Clavell novel Shogun. I couldn&#39;t \nbelieve seeing the=\r\n samurai and stuff,&quot; said MacLardy. &quot;When I was in \ncollege I would go to t=\r\nhe Metropolitan Museum and I would see the \nChinese and Japanese art and I =\r\nkind of fell in love with it.&quot;\n\nNow not only does he speak fluent Japanese,=\r\n but he also co-wrote a \nbook about kimonos three years ago that sold 9,000=\r\n copies nationwide.\n\nMacLardy plans to reopen his store, which was previous=\r\nly in Takoma \nPark, by hosting a university-only pre-sale on Feb. 21, and s=\r\nell \nitems at wholesale prices with a 50 percent discount.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.=\r\ncom/3jcf4\n\n\n\n\n"
