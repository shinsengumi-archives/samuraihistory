And had been=\r\n for centuries before his time, the origins of true Karate are shrouded in =\r\nmistery therefore who is to say Samurai as well as the techniques of the Sh=\r\naolin temple have an influence in Karate. I am just saying after e-mailing =\r\ntop masters from JKA honbu, our  own master Ohta and my own research has co=\r\nncluded with very good explanations from Japanese masters that the Samurai =\r\nhad such a big impact!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThe following is from the JKA website=\r\n:\n Karate is not a game of points, weight classes or showy demonstrations. =\r\nIt is a martial art and way of life that trains a practitioner to be peacef=\r\nul; but if conflict is unavoidable, true karate dictates taking down an opp=\r\nonent with a single blow. \n\nSuch an action requires strength, speed, focus,=\r\n control. But these physical aspects are only part of the practice; they ar=\r\ne just the vehicle, not the journey itself.\n\nTrue karate is based on Bushid=\r\no. In true karate, the body, mind and\nspirit=97the whole person=97must be d=\r\neveloped simultaneously. Through kihon, kumite and kata we learn to control=\r\n our movements. But more im-\nportantly, we learn to give up con-\ntrol too. =\r\nWe can perform the tech-\nniques without thinking about them, and remain foc=\r\nused without having\nto concentrate on any one thing. In essence, the body r=\r\nemembers how\nto move and the mind remembers\nhow to be still.\n\nThis harmonio=\r\nus unity of mind and body is intensely powerful. Even the greatest physical=\r\n strength and skill are no match for the power of wholeness.\n\nThe result of=\r\n true karate is natural, effortless action, and the confidence, humility, o=\r\npenness and peace only possible through perfect unity of mind and body. Thi=\r\ns is the core teaching of Zen, the basis of Bushido, and the  of the JKA=92=\r\ns karate philosophy.\n Karate is not a game of points, weight classes or sho=\r\nwy demonstrations.

This is the core teaching of Zen, the basis of Bushido, and=\r\n the  of the JKA=92s karate philosophy.\nTherefore I suggest we all get on w=\r\nith our lives and accept the word of the head of the JKA.\nSilk Road School =\r\n&lt;silk.road.school@...&gt; wrote:\n\nZev, I&#39;d turn that suggestion back=\r\n on you and &quot;strongly suggest&quot; that you\nyourself do quite a bit more resear=\r\nch into the samurai and martial arts,\nbefore you take so condescending a to=\r\nne - especially with someone like that\npolite Australian, who&#39;s gone to suc=\r\nh trouble to avoid insulting another\nparty on the list. The available histo=\r\nries of the samurai class - and there\nare a number of them available, if yo=\r\nu&#39;re willing to take the trouble to\nread them - do not readily support your=\r\n view. In fact, as Paul pointed out,\nthe best indications are that the only=\r\n link between the Okinawans (who\noriginated karate) and the Japanese bushi =\r\n(or samurai)... were that they\nfought against each other.\nDojo traditions a=\r\nre frequently not very good history, and this one you&#39;ve\ncited sounds like =\r\na classic of the type. To be sure, modern karate stylists\nmay have chosen t=\r\no be influenced by classical samurai traditions of bushido,\nbut that does n=\r\not mean that these traditions had anything to do with the\nearly development=\r\n of the art of karate itself. I don&#39;t doubt that your\nsenseis are telling y=\r\nou the truth as they believe it: but as I say, dojo\ntraditions are not very=\r\n reliable as history. Where did your teachers get\nthis information? How far=\r\n back does it really go? And can they prove it?\nIf their evidence stands ou=\r\nt in contradiction to all the documented sources\nfrom history, then I&#39;d hav=\r\ne to say they&#39;re only carrying on what they were\ntold themselves. That does=\r\nn&#39;t make it history.\nCertainly there is evidence that many bushi practised =\r\nempty-hand grappling\nas an adjunct art to the weapon styles that were their=\r\n mainstay - but karate\n(which in its earliest form, as I recall, simply mea=\r\nns &#39;Okinawan hand&#39;) is\nvery distinct from the aiki-jutsu which we have evid=\r\nence of bushi\npractising. Aikido could lay a more direct and more convincin=\r\ng claim to the\nancestral influence you describe. Really - study some more; =\r\nlearn some more\nabout what you&#39;re talking about: you won&#39;t find support for=\r\n your argument\nin reputable history. And you will be less likely to insult =\r\nsomeone the way\nyou&#39;ve done here - someone whose manners are rather better =\r\nthan yours, based\non the evidence at hand. Is rudeness part of your dojo tr=\r\nadition too? Does\nit show respect for your art to insult a fellow practitio=\r\nner when he\ndisagrees politely with you? Because that is clearly what you h=\r\nave done.\nAnd that is not the Way.\n\nAnd to the fellow who said that &quot;The Ok=\r\ninawans... were samurai,&quot; I&#39;m pretty\nsure that claim can&#39;t be backed up wit=\r\nh reliable history either. (Tony?\nNate? Any comments on this?) As you noted=\r\n, the Okinawans did regard\nthemselves as a separate nation: so to claim tha=\r\nt they were samurai is a\ndirect contradiction of that idea, since the samur=\r\nai were a distinctly\nJapanese phenomenon. This is like saying that the Shao=\r\nlin monks were\nsamurai. I agree that you should never take the martial arts=\r\n at face value\n(I&#39;ve got thirty-odd years of practise and study behind me a=\r\nt this stage).\nBut that includes the oral traditions that are passed down: =\r\nyou can&#39;t take\nthose at face value either. At least, not if you hope to hav=\r\ne any real\ngrasp of history.\nGereg\n\nzevlord wrote:\n\n\n*snip* Then perhaps yo=\r\nu have not studied true JKA Karate, there is such a\nstrong influence from B=\r\nushido it is so plain. I suggest you study for a\nlonger length of time. Try=\r\n reading some of the books by Funakoshi, Demura\nand Nakayama. Or you could =\r\ne-mail the mother association in Tokyo the JKA.\nThe web site is www.jka.or.=\r\njp\n\nI strongly suggest you do more research into the Samurai and martial ar=\r\nts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nALL-NEW Yahoo!

As a formalise=\r\nd code it makes a\nvery\nlate appearance - I would view it as a code based on=\r\n how previous\ngenerations had\nlived, rather than a particular code on which=\r\n the samurai modelled his life.\n\nI might go so far as to say that the &#39;appe=\r\narance&#39; of the code - as someone\nwriting\n&#39;The Way of the Warrior&#39; or whatev=\r\ner, signifies that way was already\nslipping into\nhistory...\n\nZen, similarly=\r\n, although around since the 12th century, had a relatively\nunimportant\ninfl=\r\nuence on the development of the samurai, and almost none on the\ndevelopment=\r\n of\nswordsmanship, compared to Shingon, Shinto and Taoism.\n\nZen as a &#39;major=\r\n player&#39; or major influence begins in the Edo period, with\ntraces visible\ni=\r\nn the end of the Sengoku. Whilst one might cite Musashi, or better Yagyu\nMu=\r\nnenori\nand Kamiizuni Nobutsuna, these men knew of Zen as a training regime,=\r\n but\ntheir\nmartial philosophy was founded on Shingon, Shinto and Tao.\n\nNota=\r\nbly Takuan Soho, the Zen master, friend and &#39;spiritual director&#39; of some\nno=\r\ntable\nswordsmen, employed elements of mikkyo - esoteric Buddhism - in his\nt=\r\neachings.\n\nThe appeal of Zen to the warrior is primarily because of its nea=\r\nr silence on\nissues of\nmorality and its focus on the &#39;act&#39; and the &#39;now&#39; et=\r\nc. It suited a warrior\nethic, especially\none that for long periods of histo=\r\nry would not bear examination in light of\nthe so-called\n&#39;code&#39; it professed=\r\n to live by.\n\nIn short, if bushido was the code, in any real sense, how com=\r\ne the history\nis so full of\ndeceits, deceptions and betrayals?\n\nThomas\n\n--\n=\r\n\nWhatever you Wanadoo:\nhttp://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/\n\nThis email has been =\r\nchecked for most known viruses - find out more at:\nhttp://www.wanadoo.co.uk=\r\n/help/id/7098.htm\n\n\n_______________________________________________________=\r\n_________________\n_________________________________________________________=\r\n_______________\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSam=\r\nurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n---------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nYahoo!
