This would involve presenting your claim for vendetta to \n  the government and getting the OK to proceed. Such &quot;revenge&quot; killings \n  were accepted and pretty much considered a duty. After the samurai \n  had received the OK, tracked down the son, and killed him, he would \n  have to report his act to the local authorities along with presenting \n  his documentation. Also, in pursuing your vendetta, you could not \n  create a riotous situation or (in theory at least) risk the safety of \n  uninvolved parties. Then the samurai would go his merry way without \n  any negative legal consequences at all, having fulfilled his duty. Of \n  course, this could invite a vendetta from the just killed son&#39;s \n  family/retainers....\n  If the samurai just killed the son without following the rules, it \n  was up to the authorities to decide his fate based on the situation\n  (in your case, since the son had staged a coup and the father&#39;s \n  retainer killed him, the retainer might get off with a &#39;slap on the \n  wrist&#39;). \n  Before the Edo period, revenge killings were expected but not codifed \n  as during the Shogunate (at least not on a national level) so the \n  local reaction to a revenge or duty killing varied greatly. \n  In either case, the son in question is dead meat during the Edo \n  period-even if the samurai didn&#39;t get him the government would \n  (crucifixtion). \n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com&lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/&gt;\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt;\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
