There is a club listed in my\narea, Houston, Texas, and several weeks ago I sent an e-mail to the contact\nlisted on the Japanese Sword Index web site, but it was returned as\nundeliverable. Now, I am e-mailing again in case the e-mail address has been\nupdated. (I can&#39;t remember if it is the same address.)\n\n  Also, there is a Japanese Sword & Art Show in San Antonio on Memorial Day\nweekend. The show&#39;s organizer seemed helpful when I talked to him on the\nphone and I am trying to work it out to attend it at least one day. So,\nmaybe, one way or the other I will get some &quot;hands on&quot; look at the sword and\ncan quit bugging you and the other gracious members of this group. If I get\nto the show, I will be able to see a variety of swords and other art items.\n\nScott\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;tom helm&quot; &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, May 12, 2003 10:10 PM\nSubject: Re: R: R: R: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\n\n&gt; Scott-\n&gt; The new pics unfortunately don&#39;t help, though it is clear you\n&gt; have a healthy boshi not much else is apparent. Don&#39;t feel bad lots\n&gt; of people have trouble capturing the details in photos. I can tell\n&gt; you the name in side the combat cover is Morimoto. Not enough info to\n&gt; do much with but I suspect it is the owners name. Look for Fuller and\n&gt; Gregorys&#39; book on swprds of Imperial Japan for more on your koshirae.\n&gt; For more on the sword and the smith I suggest attending a\n&gt; sword club meeting iof there is one in your area. If not you could\n&gt; mail a rubbing of the nakago to a knowledgeable person, though with\n&gt; the info you have you could do a lot on your own. I would look for\n&gt; info on Muramasa and Masashige and if you can find them pictures and\n&gt; oshigata of their work. Let me know if I can help.\n&gt; -t\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
