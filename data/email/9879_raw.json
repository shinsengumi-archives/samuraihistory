Th=\r\nere are more very accurate wargames produced in Japanese-more than I can wr=\r\nite about here, but you can read about some of them on the Samurai Archives=\r\n forum.\nFor computer games, the Takeda series by Magitech (with Takeda 3 ha=\r\nving just been released) is far better than Shogun: Total War as far as acc=\r\nuracy of gameplay and simulating historical situations. Shogun: Total War (=\r\nin my opinion) has far too many abstractions, ahistorical units, and unreal=\r\nistic gameplay. Shogun, however, does tend to have a higher fun factor. The=\r\n Takeda series is brutal and unforgiving in its depiction of warfare.\n\n\n"
