I&#39;ve known how to play \n&gt;chess since I was about three years old, and agree on that topic.  :-)  If you can \n&gt;get the enemy to surrender without a fight, that&#39;s always good.  :-)   But \n&gt;war, as a whole itself, to call that beautiful is the oxymoron.  \n&gt;\nI admit these Flower? wars were a very rare exception of wars without \nviolence. There are a few famous Chinese examples of this as well with a \nChinese general with far too few troops throwing open the gates of a \ncity to scare off the opposing general who thought that there must be \nsome clever trap involved. I&#39;m trying to think of a Japanese example but \nI can&#39;t, though the Japanese must have certainly read about it since the \nChinese classics involved were required reading in certain periods for \nthe cultured man.\n\nNormally war is a nasty affair and to paraphrase Eisenhower, the only \nthing I hate worse than war is the people who make it necessary.\n\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re: loyalty and honour\n&gt;\n&gt;Eponymous13@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;Fair enough but how do you define a &quot;right&quot;side in a war. Surely that is just a matter of oppinion and if so then there is no correct honour, just how you percieve it?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe winners are usually the right side ;) Just ask em!\n\nJim\n\n\n"
