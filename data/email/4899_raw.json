Possibly made of stone. \n&gt; I believe that the\n&gt; &gt; figurines represented either ancestorial or\n&gt; spiritual significance. \n&gt; &gt; If anyone knows of these figurines, could you\n&gt; please let me know the\n&gt; &gt; name of them.  Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; This doesn&#39;t sound like anything I&#39;ve ever heard of.\n&gt; I think someone must have \n&gt; been pulling your leg.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\nHe&#39;s got to be talking about netsuke. Rather than\nhaving any practical use, or them being &quot;fashionable&quot;,\nsome &quot;expert&quot; he read probably attributed some kind of\nspiritual significance, since isn&#39;t everything the\nsamurai ever did straight out of Zen and the Hagakure?\n\n\nSodes77--\n\nnetsuke are toggles, fasteners, etc, fashionable in\nthe Edo period. They were purely decorative. Possibly\nsomeone attributed some kind of sentimental value, if\nsomeone&#39;s father, mother, etc. had owned it before,\nbut Japanese didn&#39;t go around trusting their netsuke\nto save their lives or whatever. They weren&#39;t\ntalismans. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo! Mail - 100MB free storage!\nhttp://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail \n\n"
