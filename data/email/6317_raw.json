There are plenty of\nmediï¿½val works to support that.  As to the Japanese aspect - which is, after\nall, what counts most here... well, I&#39;d be very interested in the opinions\nof some of the experts here on that score.\nFor my own part, well... back in college I was young and stupid enough to\nfight in a duel.  (I wrote the girl a sonnet, her boyfriend challenged me\n&quot;in the name of her honour and the honour of the English language&quot; ... well,\nin retrospect he might have been right about the sonnet, gods know I&#39;ve done\nbetter since.)  It had a tremendous effect on my sense of appropriate\nfighting range, but no appreciable effect on my sense of the mystique.\nThat, I&#39;ve been hooked on since childhood.  I got pretty close to the\neffects of the sword during that duel at dawn (and no, it was not to the\ndeath, just blood); I&#39;ve also taken a rapier thrust in the palm, and I once\nhad to sew up a friend&#39;s hand after some foolish horseplay because he\nrefused to go into a hospital.  Admittedly, I have not seen any\nlife-threatening or maiming injuries (at least from swordplay - as regards\nbare-hand arts, that&#39;s another matter), but no:  none of it has reduced my\nsense of the mystique of the sword.\nI am certain that there are those who would say that I don&#39;t &quot;know enough\nabout the object to appreciate it properly&quot;...  but if you are using that as\na yardstick for this issue, then you would have to say also that pretty\nnearly all the serious sworders I&#39;ve encountered over the past thirty-odd\nyears don&#39;t know enough to appreciate swords properly either, since they all\nseem to be subject to a view similar to mine (and in some cases, rather more\nextreme)... at which point I have to ask, exactly who is in a position to\nappreciate the thing properly, if not its serious practitioners?\nI freely admit that my worldview leaves me subject to a fair bit of mystique\nof one variety or another.  Suits me just fine.  There is ample mystery in\nthe world, and it pleases me to honour and respect that.\nGereg\n\n\n   Date: Tue, 14 Dec 2004 12:26:26 -0000\n   From: &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot; &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: swords (was ...Eras)\n\n\nThere is a significant difference between appreciation and mystique.\n\nOne can appreciate the craftsmanship of a sword, a piece of\ncalligraphy, a poem, a blossom, a tank, and F1 racing car ...\nin fact just about anything.\n\nOne of my favourite sights, when working in an office overlooking\nS London (low skyline) was Conorde on the Heathrow approach.\n\nBut that does not mean I am subject to the mystique of the thing.\n\nI have often wondered whether the mystique - the mystery - of the\nsword stands in some way as a marker of man&#39;s removal, or distance,\nfrom that which the sword represents.\n\nI don&#39;t think the sword carried quite as much &#39;spiritual\nsignificance&#39; to the Sengoku and earlier samurai. Their approach was\nsomewhat more pragmatic. The sword represents them, rather than\nthey being symbolised by the sword. The names of sword, as discussed,\nowe nothing to mystique, more to about how someone came into\npossession of the blade.\n\nThere was probably one called &#39;the shop on the corner&#39;.\n\nMystique - I don&#39;t think so - just the sepia-tinted voice of\nignorance, sentimentality and nostalgia.\n\n(If one hand to examine the effect of the sword close up, I bet that\ngoes some way to dispelling the mystique)\n\nIn fact, I wonder whether &#39;mystique&#39; occurs when one doesn&#39;t know\nenough about the object to appreciate it properly?\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
