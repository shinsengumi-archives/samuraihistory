Firs=\r\nt, I understand that the Japanese matchlock is refered \nto as a Teppo.  How=\r\never, matchlocks don&#39;t have brand names or \nmakers.  There manufacturing pr=\r\nedates mass production.  It should \nalso be noted that they are of Tanegash=\r\nima pattern.  Matchlocks are \nknown by pattern names.  English pattern or F=\r\nrench pattern, this is \njust how they are named and identified.  \n\n     The=\r\n main reason I wanted to post, however, is the reason that \nmakes a Tanegas=\r\nhima pattern so interesting.  There was a very small \nbut at the same time =\r\nbig change that people seem to miss.  These \nmatchlocks were the first in w=\r\nhich the serpentine fell forward.  \nThis was a big improvement.  Older matc=\r\nhlocks the serpentine fell \ntowards the shooter, this could result in some =\r\nserious problems.  \nBurns, blindness, etc. were not uncommon results from t=\r\nhis setup.  \nAs of now, since all firearms have a hammer that falls forward=\r\n in \nthe direction of the muzzle, these should be noted as the genesis of \n=\r\nvirtually all modern firearms design.  Also, they have very fine \nlines and=\r\n are nice to shoot.  Reproductions, to be exact, are what I \nhave fired.  I=\r\n&#39;m not a matchlock fan but if I was going to have one \nit would be of Taneg=\r\nashima pattern.  \n\n     Furthermore, I think there was someone who posted a=\r\nbout Chinese \nweapons.  It was not until Europeans came that they showed As=\r\nian \ncultures, that if you harnessed the power of gunpowder you could \nmake=\r\n nasty weapons.  Also, it should be noted that Japanese guns are \nof compar=\r\nable quality to European guns of this period.  Most others \nfrom Asia were =\r\nconsidered of poor quality or overly ornate, not \nconsidered worth general =\r\nuse.  \n\n     Anyway, I&#39;m a firearms guy.  The gun is such a curious and \nel=\r\nusive thing especially in these early days.  I thought I should \nadd, I bel=\r\nieve someone earlier in this thread mentioned cannons, \nthat they were firs=\r\nt produced by bell makers.  Fun little trivial \nfact, I always found that o=\r\nne a good surprise for those who don&#39;t \nunderstand the reason why.\n\n\n\n\n"
