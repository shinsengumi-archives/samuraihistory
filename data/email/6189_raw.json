Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you&#39;re not a &quot;ringer&quot; posting from middle Ohio?  You made me look up &quot;concatenates.&quot;  I think I heard the word used ONCE back in 1992.  \n\n  To the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be wrong, but my ex-wife&#39;s aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have no idea how it is spelled, since I have never ever seen it in print) told me that the great sword makers had stopped making katanas and moved into making kitchen knives, since that&#39;s where the money is.  Now, I can see perhaps where it would be extra handy to have a ginsu knife for chopping garlic instead of your trusty katana, but maybe that&#39;s just me.  Some of you might enjoy the garlic chopping with a larger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged if you do, since that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there any truth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there, just making steak knives for Williams Sonoma?  (Incidentally, the ex and myself are on excellent terms, so no need to fear for my safety.  Thank you for your concern.)\n\n  Your most obedient,\n\n  Matt\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
