This is who I am.  It seemed relevant \nalthough the  topic has wandered a bit.  I have to admit that I am \nproud, but I am not campaigning or recruiting.  I&#39;m just saying that \nwar doesn&#39;t have to be so ugly anymore.  If it is fought the right \nway.  Battles like Nagashino are no longer standard warfare.  War \ndoesn&#39;t have to be a slaughter.  It can be executed and finished in a \nproportional manner.  \nIn fact, I&#39;m not even sure that I&#39;ll vote for Bush in the election.  \nI am sure I have the right to share my thoughts.  Just as much as you \nhave the right to tell me that you don&#39;t like what I&#39;ve said.  And \nalthough there may not be an absolutely clear link to medieval Japan \nlet me make the indirect link evident.  This group discusses the \nhistory of a military class and the wars they fought.  I think it is \nimportant to be able to relate history into terms that I can \nunderstand.  In my case I don&#39;t have any SCA experience or anything \nof that nature.  The way that I relate to the samurai is through our \nmodern military and wars in recent history.  Being able to comprehend \nthe links that history may have to our present makes history even \nmore powerful in terms of revelance.  Some people don&#39;t like history \nbecause they don&#39;t think it has any bearing on who they are.  I&#39;m not \none of them and neither are you.\nI&#39;m just trying to tie things in so they make sense to me, and maybe \nhelp others make the same link.  The topic of conversation was War.  \nIs it bad, evil, ugly?  I guess I could have kept the conversation \nabstract, like many others have.  I didn&#39;t want to be accused of \nmaking statements &quot;that sound good but have no substance&quot;.  \nI really didn&#39;t mean to offend you but I won&#39;t apologize.  It is what \nI believe.  I hope you don&#39;t hate me now.  I know that some of what I \nbrought up is probably closer to you than anyone else on the group.  \nI do respect your opinions Cepo and I am actually flattered that you \nread all the way through my message.  Thanks.\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@d...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you please stop campaigning?\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a mailing lists on medieval Japan.\n&gt; I suppose it&#39;s ok to go a bit OT, but please leave your flag home.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; cepo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
