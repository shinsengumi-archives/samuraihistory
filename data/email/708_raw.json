You should have never gotten yourself into \nthat mess.  Takeda jr. should have been happy with what he had \nand made the fight come to him.  Spread himself to thin without \nthinking of the consequences.  Consequenses that the shrewd \nNobunaga and Tokugawa would make him pay.  Of course there \nwas no expecting the slaughter that was about to occur but the \nreason for having great military advice is to use it.  \n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; In hindsight, it&#39;s obvious...you retreat. You have\n&gt; 15,000, the combined Oda-Tokugawa army has\n&gt; 38,000...you don&#39;t fight with that force ratio. I know\n&gt; the Takeda cavalry corps was superior, etc., etc. It\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter. You have half your army engaged in the\n&gt; North against Kenshin, why lose the other half against\n&gt; Nobunaga? Retreat.\n&gt; \n&gt; His generals were right\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Edwin Angulo &lt;mayalan@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I got a question, if you were Takeda Katsuyori,\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; would you do at the battle of Nagashino?, at this\n&gt; &gt; moment, i cant find the way to fight that battle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Edwin.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n__________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
