He steered Japan on a liberal course toward a \nparliamentary democracy.  His armed forces in the  Russo-Japanese War earned renown \nfrom all foreign correspondents and war observers, like our Black Jack \nPershing,  for the chivalrous way they handled Russian prisoners.   His death in \n1912 and the suicide of the general Nogi and his wife heralded the true end of \nthe Age of the Samurai.  Had Hirohito had an ounce of the courage and character \nthat Meiji had,  there would have been no invasion of China nor war  in the \nPacific.  Of course my opinion is clouded a bit here by the fact that Hirohito&#39;s \nminions tried to kill my dad twice, at Leyte Gulf and Okinawa.
