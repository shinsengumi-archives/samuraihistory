These are the people that \nmade thngs happen.  lwts just put into perspective if there were no samuira, no \nbattles.. and no shogun.  How interested would webe at this time  in this \nhistory.  so I am thinking that is the Samuria who compell us to look at the \nhistory of Japan.  What was thier real purpose in this.  \n\n  Just wondering did Tosugawa want to be shogun for the good of Japan to \nunifiy it or did he want to become Shogun for some ohter reason.   and once he was \nin power was Japan better off then it was before this period.   \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
