I&#39;ve only seen one episode of Rurouni Kenshin, and I&#39;ve got no idea how accurate it is historically, but the background all seemed pretty accurate to me, though I am not an expert, and certainly the Choshu samurai that I&#39;ve read more about (Takasugi Shinsaku - he who dies of tb before the Restoration happens, - Inoue Kaoru, Kido Koin and Ito Hirobumi,) did lead dramatic and colourful lives. And of course especially Sakamoto Ryoma.\n\nsamurai is a description of a class. At the end of the bakumatsu period the samurai class made up 10 percent of the population. Most of them were bureaucrats and officials and were disliked if not hated by everyone else. They were also usually impoverished. The Tokugawa period was brought to an end by famine and poverty as much as by foreign pressure. The scene in Kyoto was chaotic as young underemployed samaurai from different han got together to ferment new ideas. (They also travelled to Edo to attend sword training schools, and sometimes to learn foreign languages.) When the bakufu regime clamped down on them as during the Ansei purges under Ii Naosuke opposition was quelled quite quickly, but the baku/han stucture of government meant the shogun was too weak to continue this policy after Ii&#39;s assassination. \n\nCan&#39;t possibly write more now about this period but it is one of the most fascinating in Japanese history. You&#39;ll enjoy researching it.\n\nGillian\n\n"
