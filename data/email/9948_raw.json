I am a researcher in South  \n&gt; Africa working in a museum. I have a samurai suite that I will be  \n&gt; putting on exhibition soon. I was wondering if one is able to date  \n&gt; the armor just by looking at it and is one able to say who it might  \n&gt; have belonged to? It also has a katana with an inscription on the  \n&gt; hilt, could someone translate it for me, if possible?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you kindly\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
