He was the youngest son in the rich family, whose fath=\r\ner\n&gt; ran a big shop. In those days, there was a class distinctions called,\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;shi-nou-kou-sho&quot; (samurai, farmer, artisan and merchant in descending or=\r\nder\n&gt; of rank). In Tosa, the samurai divided into two class, joshi and gosh=\r\ni(Upper\n&gt; and lower). The Sakamoto family belonged to the merchant class, l=\r\nowest in\n&gt; the class distinctions. Ryoma&#39;s father bought the right to be a =\r\ngoshi, a\n&gt; lower class samurai. The difference between joshi and goshi were=\r\n strict\n&gt; rules. For example, joshi can have an umbrella when it rains, but=\r\n goshi\n&gt; can&#39;t. Joshi can wear &quot;tabi&quot; a kind of socks, but goshi can&#39;t. Ryo=\r\nma was\n&gt; born under this circumstance.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone know any other rule=\r\ns that differentiated between Goshi and\n&gt; Joshi?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Totok Sudar=\r\nijanto\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
