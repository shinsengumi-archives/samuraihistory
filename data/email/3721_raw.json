But only a handful\nof\n&gt; soldiers joined him. Everyone else=\r\n shouted him down as a crazy man. He\n&gt; committed Sepeku as a result of his =\r\nfailure.\n\nThat was hardly an uprising, and it wasn&#39;t a general. It was nove=\r\nlist\nMishima \nYukio, card carrying whacko, who harrangued the army at Japan=\r\n&#39;s military\nHQ. No \none joined him -- they all laughed.
