And, it is a bit of a tricky one. The answer has often \nbeen misunde=\r\nrstood, in the West epecially, with many writings that \ntalk about Zen as T=\r\nHE religion of the samurai. There really is no \ndoubt that Zen did have an =\r\ninfluence,to what degree is debateable, \non the medieval samurai class and =\r\nJapanese society that still exists \nto this day. HOWEVER, one should not pa=\r\nint with too broad of a brush \nand say that Zen was the religion of the sam=\r\nurai. The samurai class \nwas a very religiously diverse group which include=\r\nd almost all \nschools of Buddhism as well as some that for the most part re=\r\njected \nBuddhism and relied more on Shinto beliefs. The most common \nreligi=\r\nous belief would be, like Japanese society as a whole, some \nform of Pure L=\r\nand Buddhism. Pure Land Buddhism is a faith that \nentrusts future salvation=\r\n to the Buddha Amida. The belief is that by \nbelieving in and chanting the =\r\nname of Amida Buddha one would be \nreborn in his Pure Land and be able to l=\r\nearn from the Amida Buddha \ndirectly in order to obtain enlightenment. Now =\r\nto be fair this is a \na very simplified exaplination. But, in it we can fin=\r\nd why it is so \npopular. Faith in Amida&#39;s compassion for all senient beings=\r\n allows \nfor a much easier path for the average farmer or warrior that migh=\r\nt \ndie any moment on the battlefield. In secord place of common \nreligion w=\r\nould proabably be the Nichiren sect. The BASIC teaching of \nthe Nichiren se=\r\nct is that having faith in the Lotus Sutra and \nchanting the name of the Lo=\r\ntus Sutra would lead to salvation. In an \nattempt to keep it simple I may h=\r\nave glossed over some things, but \nbasically I am trying to show that when =\r\nyou engage in deadly combat \nas an occupation these schools  would provide =\r\na more attractive \npath. One must also remember that medieval Zen was prima=\r\nrily a \nmonastic order, although there certainly were some devout lay \nprac=\r\ntitioners... Also there is generally not the one way mentality \nas in the W=\r\nest. In Japan, then and nowm it would not be wrong for a \nbeliever in the P=\r\nure Land or some other school participating in Zen \nmeditation, or Zen infl=\r\nuenced arts. While the Nichiren school \nrejected the practices of other rel=\r\nigious faith there was generally \nnothing wrong with practicing aspects of =\r\nmore than one school of \nBuddhism as well as practicing Shinto. I am not be=\r\nliever though in \nthe theory that samurai practiced Zen ONLY for a way to c=\r\nulturaly \nlegitimate their power. While I think this is true in some, perha=\r\nps \nmany, cases there were also samurai that did follow Zen religiously. \nA=\r\ns far as Zen in samurai history I think we need to look somewhere \nin the m=\r\niddle between the two extremes to get closer to the truth. \nIn an attempt t=\r\no save some space I have left out a ton of stuff that \ncould be written, an=\r\nd at times I feel I went on more then needed. \nBut, my basic point is that =\r\none should not think of Zen as THE \nreligion of the samurai, but rather one=\r\n of many practices that were \na part warrior culture during the medieval pe=\r\nriod. \n\n\n\n"
