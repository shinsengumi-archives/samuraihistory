I mean, what is the\n&gt; rank of BRIGADIER general, \n&gt; afterall? The CSA Army had that one right -- and we\n&gt; used to have bird colonels \n&gt; doing it all the time (and still do).\n\nwell, we could digress on this for days...I&#39;m still\nnot entirely sure what happened--the Union army had\nBG&#39;s as BDE commanders too. Where the split was, I\ndon&#39;t know--I think it was when we ballooned in WWI,\nand you simply couldn&#39;t have that many generals\nwaltzing around. \n\nIt&#39;s always bothered me that a Major General is lower\nthan a Lieutenant General--then I learned that it used\nto be &quot;Sergeant-Major General&quot;, and the first part\njust got dropped, eventually. \n\n&gt; &gt; There WAS no rank system in a sengoku army. Don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; confuse ranks with &quot;ranking&quot;. Obviously some\n&gt; people\n&gt; &gt; were more important than others, and some jobs\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; more prestigious, etc. But you didn&#39;t start as\n&gt; &gt; Ashigaru 2nd Class, work up to Ashigaru 1st Class,\n&gt; &gt; then Gunsou, then 2nd Samurai, then 1st Samurai,\n&gt; etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; You put it better than I do. I like that perspective\n&gt; of working through \n&gt; &quot;Ashigaru 2nd class&quot; to &quot;1st Samurai.&quot; :)\n\nYou get to eat in a better mess hall starting at 2nd\nSamurai. And the girls like it so much better, too!\n\n&gt; &gt; You simply can&#39;t fit the square Sengoku army peg\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; the round modern military hole. \n&gt; \n&gt; Which is a chorus I find myself repeating too\n&gt; often....\n\n*sings along*\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!
