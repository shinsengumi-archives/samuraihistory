This clearly demonstrates many percepts\n&gt; contained in the book of five rings from knowing\n&gt; your opponent to knowing the lay of the land to\n&gt; applying strategy and more .Unfortunately I cannot\n&gt; quote any sources with any veracity.Hope this helps\n&gt; any way.\n&gt;   Yours in bu do\n&gt;                       Rob\n\nI saw the mini-series on him.
