The Ii took the\n&gt; idea, I believe, from the troops of Yamagata\n&gt; Masakage--I could be wrong on the name. The Ii then\n&gt; made the wearing of uniform armor their thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; When did this sort of thing start? Does anyone\n&gt; &gt; really know?\n&gt; \n&gt; Essentially, when the Yamagata and Ii started doing\n&gt; it. Prior to that, it was mainly only a concern to\n&gt; equip your men with whatever you could--buying\n&gt; matching sets of armor gets expensive. Earlier in the\n&gt; 16th cent daimyo would mark the armor they issued to\n&gt; their ashigaru with their mon; that was probably the\n&gt; beginning.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is it conceivable that a Shimazu daimyo of the 14thC\n&gt; &gt; might have\n&gt; &gt; equipped his men with black armour, if similar\n&gt; &gt; things were occurring\n&gt; &gt; in the 16thC?\n&gt; \n&gt; Conceivable? I suppose. Not likely--at that point,\n&gt; it&#39;d be enough just to make sure they all had armor of\n&gt; some sort. Usually the retainer himself was\n&gt; responsible for his own armor. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; The all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \n&gt; http://my.yahoo.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
