No person can d=\r\no that. Again, I am \nvery sorry. \n\nSecondly, to those who were eager to hel=\r\np me with such beautiful\nmaterial (eg top 10 misconceptions, Christian samu=\r\nrais) I am extremely\ngrateful.  Thank you so much! I&#39;m learning a lot from =\r\nyou guys. I will\ncheck out the sites and the info you&#39;ve given me and will =\r\nhope to share\nwhat I think of them in the  near future.\n\nThirdly, I was abl=\r\ne to get hold of a copy of the book &quot;A Higher Honor&quot; by\nRobert Boardman. I&#39;=\r\nve just read through the preface and it looks like a highly\nenjoyable read!=\r\n The author used to fight against the Japanese army until\nhe was sent back =\r\nto the land of the rising sun in a different capacity and he\nwrote about th=\r\ne honor and commtiment of the people who used to be his enemy \nbut whom he =\r\nhas now come to love.\n\nDomo arigato!\n\nCarmen\n\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nYeah,christians could learn a lot from Bushido.=\r\nThey could be braver.....Edy\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nHi Carmen.\n=\r\n\nIf you&#39;re new to this subject (as I also am) I would sugest &quot;The top 10\nmi=\r\nsconceptions of the samurai&quot; -\nhttp://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.h=\r\ntm\n\nThat certainly cleared some things up, like the bushido code for\nexampl=\r\ne.   ;)\n\n\nLuis\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nBrave men and coward=\r\ns alike, exist in all religions.

I would examine the \nhistory of c=\r\nhristianity in Kyushu and the lives of the Christian \nDaimyo, sounds like a=\r\n natural subject for your interests...\n-t\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D\n\nHi Carmen,\nplease keep in mind that bushido was only what people made =\r\nout of it. First\nof all its a rather hollow shell and it depends on what yo=\r\nu do with it.\nOtherwise it=B4s just an ideal that some reached and some did=\r\nn=B4t.\nRemember also all the bad things that happened when certain people c=\r\nalled on\nthe bushido &gt; WWII is only one example...\n\nKarsten Helmholz\nGerman=\r\ny\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nHey.\n       I was thinking ab=\r\nout this as I read some of the posts on this topic.  \nIt seems that there a=\r\nre at least one or two very large similarities between \nChristianity (which=\r\n I am by no means an expert on) and Bushido (99.9999% of my \nknowledge of w=\r\nhich came from this list).  Both call for unquestioned service to \na (L)ord=\r\n and both have followers very willingly giving their lives for that \n(L)ord=\r\n if and when the need arises.  It&#39;s just a matter of the direction.  \nBushi=\r\ndo, the lord is a human one.  Christianity, a spiritual One.  I do agree th=\r\nat \nmany (most?!) Christians could learn to be braver through studying Bush=\r\nido, \nthough, myself included.  That Christian samurai were willing to give=\r\n their \nlives for either (or both) of their (L)ords is testament to how dev=\r\noted they were \nto their religion and to their code, and there&#39;s nothing wr=\r\nong with that.\n       Take care.\n\nL8r.\nTim\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D\nHey Carmen,\n\nHere are some prominant Christian Samurai that I =\r\nknow\nof:\nOtomo Sorin\nKuroda Yoshitaka\nArima Harunobu\n\nAlso check out the Sh=\r\nimabara Rebelion 1637-1638\n\nAlso though there may have been Christain Samur=\r\nai,\nChristianity was viewed as a potential threat(foreign\npowers namely the=\r\n Portuguese) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi\nand the Tokugawa Shogunate. Their crack =\r\ndown on\nchristianity wasn&#39;t so much hatred toward christains\nas much as eli=\r\nminating a disruptive force. The\nsamurai(Oda Nobunaga) also cracked down on=\r\n the Buddist\nIkko Sect for the same reasons.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nJake\n\n\n\n\n\n-=\r\n--\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store=\r\n: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n------------------------=\r\n---------\nYahoo!
