But I still find it a\nrather boring period when compared to everything  that happened before and\nafter. Of course, the revolution itself was  quite exciting in my mind. The\ninformation about this period is not  only sparse on this board, but in\nscholarship in general (for the  reasons you mentioned). There are more\nbooks on WWII than I care to  know about, and the same could be said of\npre-Meiji Japan. However, I  do wish my local university had a class on the\nRusso-Japanese War--a  very under-rated war in terms of significance.\n\n  Jonathan Ellgen\n\ntokyo dog &lt;tokyodog@...&gt; wrote:I’m  no expert in Japan history, but\nI’ve noticed quite a few historical  inaccuracies posted on this list\nrecently. This is my attempt to  respond to these comments and questions. I\nthought it might be helpful  if I posted some comments, and some history\nbooks for people to read,  for those who might be interested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
