I mistakenly sent before I was done. Sorry about that. :/)\n \nI&#39;m wanting to run a Sengoku RPG campaign, and am looking for some information about the Shimazu clan during Sengoku Jidai. Specifically, I&#39;m wondering whether anyone has access to or could help me piece together a &quot;complete as possible&quot; family tree of the Shimazu clan in that era. I&#39;ve had an easy enough time finding out the path of succession from generation to generation in the clan, and at least mention of the names of other sons. What I&#39;m REALLY looking for, though, is information about the wives and daughters in the clan, since one of the key characters in my campaign is going to be a woman married to a Shimazu daimyo.\n \nIf this seems too broad a question to begin with, I am particularly interested in the wife of Shimazu Yoshihiro -- her name, the family and region she was born to, her immediate family members, anything of significance she may have accomplished. Honestly, though, her name would be more than enough at this point because it&#39;s hard enough finding even THAT. *sighs*\n \nMaybe I&#39;m just looking in the wrong places and need to be nudged in the right direction. In any case, any help you can provide would be appreciated!\n \nSally \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
