On one\nhand I&#39;d think that it would be very effective against laquered\nbamboo armour due to the crushing wieght of the axe blade, however I\nwouldn&#39;t want to fight someone who is carrying a sword with an axe -\na heavy unbalanced (and slow) weapon like an axe couldn&#39;t stand up to\na well balanced katana, could it?\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
