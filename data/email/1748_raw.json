The show&#39;s organizer seemed helpful when I talked to him on the\n&gt;phone and I am trying to work it out to attend it at least one day. So,\n&gt;maybe, one way or the other I will get some &quot;hands on&quot; look at the sword \n&gt;and\n&gt;can quit bugging you and the other gracious members of this group. If I get\n&gt;to the show, I will be able to see a variety of swords and other art items.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n\n"
