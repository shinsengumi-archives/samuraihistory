I can remember that, but I can&#39;t remember to\n&gt; bring home toilet paper from the store. I suppose\n&gt; that&#39;s why my wife gets frustrated. *sigh*\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s important to keep in mind that it was a feudal\n&gt; master-retainer relationship. I would take you into my\n&gt; service, give you land or a stipend, etc. In return,\n&gt; you&#39;d provide military service--and that included\n&gt; providing your own equipment, horse, weapons, armor,\n&gt; and sub-retainers (your attendants, etc., depending on\n&gt; your station) and their equipment. Since it&#39;s all\n&gt; coming out of different pockets, it&#39;s highly unlikely\n&gt; I would be able to tell all my retainers &quot;You must all\n&gt; be the same&quot;. You could standardize your band of 5\n&gt; guys or so, but at that time, why? Even the sashimono\n&gt; didn&#39;t really come into being prior to the end of the\n&gt; Onin War, when armies got bigger and bigger and needed\n&gt; clearer ways of identifying. Uniforms seem natural to\n&gt; us today, but even in European armies, you didn&#39;t\n&gt; really see uniforms until the late 17th/early 18th\n&gt; centuries. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
