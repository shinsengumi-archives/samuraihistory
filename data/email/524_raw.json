He claims to be \na Koga Ninja even though he is of Chinese decent.\n\ni have this on Hanzo \n\nHATTORI RYU\n\nThe Hattori Ryu, Momochi Ryu, and Fujibayashi Ryu, were all descended \nfrom Otomo no Saijin, who himself was a leading member of one of \nJapans highest ranked families. As the Hattori, and Momochi families \nwere all commoners they used the same Mon (coat of arms).\n\nIga Heinaizaemon no jo Ienaga one time, the head of the Hattori \nfamily, gave permission for his sons to start their own lineage. \nThese three were called Hattori Heitaro Koreyuki, Hattori Heijiro \nYasuyori, and Hattori Heijiro Yasunori. The eldest son Koreyuki, \ncalled his family &#39;Kamihattori&#39;, the middle son Yasuyori named \nhis &#39;Nakahattori&#39;, and the youngest Yasunori, called his \nfamily &#39;Shimohattori&#39;. The descendants of the Hattori family \noriginated many centuries early from China, and were at that time the \nwarlords of many provinces. For this reason they were known by many \nnames, amongst which they were known as &quot;Kan Kuni no Kami&quot; (Hattori \nlords of Kan). \n\nHeitaro Koreyuki was the oldest son of Iga no jo Ienaga, and as such \non his fathers death became the head of the Kamihattori. The \nKamihattori mon (crest) was known as Yahazu Nihon, or, &quot;The two arrow \nheads&quot;. \n\nHeijiro Yasuyori, of the Nakahattori, had ties with the Chinese Go \nprovince, their Mon was called Ichitomoe, or, &quot;an arc&quot;. \n\nHeijiro Yasunori, of the Shimohattori, was also called &quot;Ae Kuni no \nHattori&quot;, (The Hattori of Ae). The Shimohattori Mon was called \nYaguruma, &quot;The eight arrowheads in a circle&quot;. \n\nHanzo Hattori came from the Kamihattori branch of the Hattori family. \nIt is not fully known if he came from the Heitaro or the Chigachi \nline (another branch of the Kamihattori family).\n\nAs well as the Hattori family, the Momochi, and Fujibayashi were also \nvery prominent within the Ninja schools of Iga.\n\nIn 1567, Oda Nobunaga ordered his Samurai to attack the Iga province. \nThe three Hattori families Kami, Naka, and Shimo were almost \ndestroyed. Only 80 members of these three powerful families survived.\n\nAs Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the three branches of \nthe Hattori family dispersed to different area&#39;s of Japan. The \nKamihattori fled to Nagaoka in Echigo. The Nakahattori split into two \ngroups. One group went to went to Mikawa, to the protection of, and \nwork in the service of the  Tokugawa family, the other half of the \ngroup went to the Oichi family in Takatori, in Yamato. The \nShimohattori escaped to the safety of the mountains of Takano in \nKishu.\n\nHattori Masanari, and his son  Hattori Hanzo (both from the \nKamihattori), swore allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while \nworking for the Tokugawa held the rank of &#39;Shinobi Metsuke&#39;, and he \nhad served Ieyasu&#39;s grandfather Matsudaira Kiyoyasu. Hanzo later, \nwith a friend, Shiro Tarao who was a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa \nIeyasu flee across Japan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely, \nutilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting up special \ndefensive formations along the road, and by using Ninja methods of \nrunning. This all helped the Tokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. \nThe Hattori were not &quot;Watari Ninja&quot; (Ninja who moved around from one \nDaimyo to another), they were loyal to the Tokugawa, and remained in \ntheir service for many generations.\n\nMasanari Hanzo, head of the Hattori family, received his training in \nthe martial arts, and Ninjutsu, from his father Hattori Hanzo \nYasunaga, when he was a child. He virtually grew up in the practice, \nand tradition of the martial arts. \n\nWhen Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at night, Hanzo was \nyoung man of 16 years. For the skills that he used during the battle, \nhe earned himself a commendation. He was given the name &quot;Hanzo the \nGhost&quot;. Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the province of \nKawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in use. In his later years \nHanzo was also known as &quot;Hanzo the great lancer&quot; (Yari no Hanzo).\n\nHanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai, and then came \nto be known as &quot;Hattori Hanzo Iwami no Kami&quot;.\n\nAt one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him, each held the \nrank of Doshin. He developed problems with these Ninja and he found \nit difficult to control them, and he relieved them of their services. \nHe then employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in his \nlife, he became a Monk.\n\nHanzo Hattori (above) was so famous that in the province of Mikawa \nsongs were written about him. One contained these lines:\n\n&quot;Lord Tokugawa has the finest warriors\nHanzo Hattori is Demon\nHanzo is Hanzo the Yari&quot;\n\nSome say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th December 1596, while \ntrying to bring the Ninja of the Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must \nbe wrong as Hanzo helped Ieyasu in the early 1600&quot;s. The story of his \ndeath says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding teeth), and \nhis Fuma Ryu originally came from Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and \nhis men chased the Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf \nof Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of water, and \nseveral swam under water, and began dismantling the rudders of the \nboats belonging to Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo&#39;s \nmen decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by shore. When \nthey entered the water, they discovered that the water was covered \nwith oil. To which the Fuma Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the \nTokugawa Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.\n\n\n\nHope this helps\n\n\n\n\n"
