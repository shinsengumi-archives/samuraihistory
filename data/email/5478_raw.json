As has been \nmentioned, the Emperor was (&quot;is&quot; if you were to read some nationalist \nwriters or some of nationalist elements you bump into around \nHiroshima) an incarnate descendant of the kami. During the \nHeian/Kamakura/Muromachi jidai, the Kenmon temples (see Kuroda Toshio \nor Adolphson &quot;Gates of Power&quot;) played a huge role in the formulation \nof government methods and activities, and the &#39;goso&#39; were seen as \nan &#39;acceptable&#39;, if unwelcome, disturbance to the streets of the \ncapital, in terms of expression of aims and objections.  Their \nobjections were listened to, not just because Kyoto was so poorly \npoliced, but because the authorities feared the presence on the \nstreets of the mikoshi (portable shrines). Of course, this didn&#39;t \nmake for a theocracy (or &quot;semi-theocracy&quot;; can one have a state that \nis\n&gt;  &#39;semi-communist&#39; or &#39;semi-fascist&#39;?), but the religious \ninstitutions held a large sway, and \nBuddhist/Shinto/Taoist/Confucian/Shamanist religiousity permeated \nsociety from the rituals of the court to the  matsuri in the fields. \nWhen the Ikko-Ikki erupted in the 1480s (until the destruction of \nNagashima and the Ishiyama Honganji, the Hokke-Ikko overwhelmed in \nthe capital (1532-36), and Enryakui assisted the enemies of Nobunaga, \nthey were then destroyed. Nobunaga undertook measures not witnessed \nsince the Taira destruction of Nara, and for similar reasons; the \nsects had overstepped the mark and become too embroiled in the \nsecular world, and interferred in their plans. This said, other than \nthe Hokke-ikko of the 1530s, none of the sects marched on the capital \nwith an eye to its capture and the installation of a national regime \nbased upon any particular sect&#39;s beliefs. Even Nichiren in the 13th \ncentury did not oppose the Shogun because of his authority, but \nobjected to the bakufu&#39;s\n&gt;  alleged slander of the Dharma. Opposition was one thing; outright \ntheocracy (in terms of Iran, or at a push the Vatican City State) was \na step the sects didn&#39;t (at least openly) contemplate.\n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt;  \n\nAlthough they never marched on the capital or pushed theocracy, and \nmaybe never intended to - anyone who wanted to unify the country \nwould have to deal with them in one way or another, and I suspect Oda \nNobunaga was one of the few who would have been so iron-fisted. \nOthers might have tried to compromise with them, which might have led \nto concessions for them, or even in a few theoretical instances, led \nto political concessions that added to their political power base.\n\n\n"
