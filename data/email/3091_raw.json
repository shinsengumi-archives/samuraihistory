Anyways,\n&gt; one\n&gt; of the hits had a yomikata for the first two kanji\n&gt; (INOBE), so as far as we can figure it&#39;s either\n&gt; INOBE\n&gt; or YABE. The second two, the consensus is SHOUHOU or\n&gt; SHOUSUKE, with the latter being agreed upon as\n&gt; probably correct. Maybe it&#39;s aan obscure kakikata\n&gt; for\n&gt; the common ~suke title?? TONY, where are you??\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got three Japanese librarians working on it\n&gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; now...the best they&#39;ve come up with is \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yabe Shousuke  assuming it&#39;s a name. If the first\n&gt; &gt; character&#39;s first bunsho was written with a sanzui\n&gt; &gt; instead of only two, it would be Jibu or Jibe, but\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s only two water marks. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Needless to say, it&#39;s perplexing them too. Hope\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; helps, or at least makes you feel better. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Kitsuno\n&gt; &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn&#39;t look like that came out, so take a\n&gt; look\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here at the .jpg:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/NEW.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;samurai-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listowner@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to figure out the reading for this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; title given to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai during the Sengoku:\n&gt; &gt; &#27835;&#12539;#34;&#23569;&#36628;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m pretty sure it is &#39;Jibu Shouyuu&#39;, but I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be sure. and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone could give me specifics on what it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; signifies, that would be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great, too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
