I find it curious that,=\r\n assuming you are a \nChinese emperor, you are so insistent upon using an ar=\r\nticle.  If \nanything, most Chinese who are not native speakers of English t=\r\nend \nto omit articles, flinging them on the ash heap of lingual \nmisunderst=\r\nanding (as I am sure that English speakers similarly \nbutcher Chinese, or J=\r\napanese).  But, because of your exalted \nposition, I will endeavor to not b=\r\necome too familiar and slip and \nuse your first name, &quot;The.&quot;  \n\nPerhaps I w=\r\nas misunderstood: I meant, a movie treating the subject \nthat was less than=\r\n two hours, in English, not subtitled.  You know, \nthe way a serious resear=\r\ncher would go about things.  (I seriously \ndoubt there&#39;s anything out there=\r\n.)\n\nWhich would drag me to the OT subject of THE Ming Dynasty, and the \nthi=\r\nng that has me curious as to its meaning and why in the world the \nMings we=\r\nre so short-sighted that they completely failed to \nunderstand and utilize =\r\ntrade:\n\n&quot;Although merchants and trade in general were looked down upon, \nCh=\r\nina had established sea routes that were used for trade with Japan \nand sou=\r\nth Asia. Starting in 1405 A.D., Zheng He began a series of \nseven naval exp=\r\neditions that went as far as the east coast of \nAfrica. These trips followe=\r\nd established routes and were mainly \ndiplomatic. The last of these voyages=\r\n was completed in 1433 A.D. At \nthis point, China was far ahead of the rest=\r\n of the world in naval \ncapabilities. Their ships could carry as many as 50=\r\n0 men. However, \nafter the last voyage was completed none were ever again a=\r\nttempted. \nIn fact, records of the trips were destroyed and shipbuilding wa=\r\ns \nrestricted to small-size vessels. As a result, China&#39;s coast was \nfreque=\r\nntly attacked by pirates.&quot;  -- \nhttp://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/chin=\r\na/later_imperial_china/min\ng.html\n\nNow, paint me with purple dog excrement =\r\nsideways, but doesn&#39;t that \nseem to be a bit, well, insular?  And, even mor=\r\ne to the point, \nfoolish?  Bah, peasants, always thinking of peasant things=\r\n, and not \nthinking of the big picture.  I think they managed to screw thin=\r\ngs \nup pretty royally, so to speak.\n\nI&#39;m going to extrapolate that the end =\r\nof the Ming Dynasty&#39;s ability \nto extend themselves through naval power pro=\r\nbably coincided with a \nrise in Japanese fortunes?  Any evidence to this ef=\r\nfect in Japanese \nhistory, from 1433-1470 or so?\n\nMy apologies for dragging=\r\n the discussion into the neighbor state and \noutside the confines of the Sa=\r\nmurai (&quot;u&quot;, not &quot;a&quot;), but I suspect \nthis group will probably have some ins=\r\night into this particular \nevent in history, even if colored by a heavy emp=\r\nhasis on the \nJapanese history of the time.\n\nAh, but this isn&#39;t researching=\r\n papers for the youth of America (or \nanywhere else).  As a side note, I re=\r\ncall a webpage with an idea oft-\nduplicated which presented history=85 ALMO=\r\nST as it was, but with a few \nfacts twisted around so that anyone who faile=\r\nd to read the \nintroduction at the top ended up with something that would p=\r\nrobably \nget them an &quot;F&quot; on their paper.  It would have things like, &quot;Abrah=\r\nam \nLincoln freed the slaves, then invented the microwavable burrito \nwith =\r\nhot sauce, but not too hot because the newly freed slaves had \nsensitive st=\r\nomachs.&quot;  And it serves the little bastards right, since \nI had to go to a =\r\nbrick and mortar library to look things up, and so \nshould they if they wan=\r\nt to get credit for doing some work.  Er, \nexcuse me, was I musing out loud=\r\n again?  \n\nI&#39;m off to lunch, and to start Ch. 1 of Mr. Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai,=\r\n a \nMilitary History.&quot;  Wish me luck.\n\n-- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Matt &lt;yeomanforbes@y...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Ming (can I call you Ming?):\n&gt; \n&gt; No, no.

If you can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nock badly \n&gt; &gt; compiled history, what can you mock? \n&gt; \n&gt; Not much, I suppo=\r\nse. Japanese popstars are always good\n&gt; for a laugh, though. \n&gt; \n&gt;  &quot;readin=\r\ng is so boring... is there a video I\n&gt; &gt; can watch to get \n&gt; &gt; all this inf=\r\normation in a two hour or less setting?\n&gt; &gt; Without \n&gt; &gt; subtitles in Engli=\r\nsh?&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m kidding about that last.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can suggest a few thing=\r\ns without subtitles in\n&gt; English.
