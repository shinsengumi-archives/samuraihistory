Only two hours by train from Tokyo, it houses Ieyasu&#39;s mausoleum, located in the forest above the very impressive Toshogu Shrine(which also houses a Kendo dojo where you can view training).  \nIf in Tokyo, a trip to Kamakura is a must.  Despite the electricity and telephone cables that dog any modern Japanese townscape, Kamakura can be a treat with its temples and shrines, at one which (the Engakuji) you can often see practitioners of Kyudo at work. \nThen if you&#39;re going to Kyoto you could stop at Hamamatsu and see the site of Ieyasu&#39;s Shussejyo (although it is again a post-War reproduction. Hamamatsu is more of interest if you like Japanese motorbikes though I found.  \nHave a good time. \n\nThomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; wrote:\nI&#39;m about to start planning (again) a 3-week trip to Japan.\n\nI&#39;m interested primarily in Tokugawa Ieyasu (pre-Edo), and Mikawa (as was) \nin general - say between Sumpu and Gifu (sorry for the old names). It&#39;s more \n&#39;look n feel&#39; than anything else, although I&#39;m quite aware that Japan has \nchanged and looking for Sengoku Mikawa might be like looking for \nShakespeare&#39;s London ... gone a long time ago.\n\nAll this is aid of atmosphere for my Sengoku blockbuster, so a view, or a \nstretch of the Tokaido as was, or anything that might say &#39;this is what it was \nlike&#39; is the main intent.\n\nHaving said that, festivals are OK, demonstrations are better - iaido/jutsu the \nbest.\n\nSo any ideas for packing a lifetime&#39;s experience in one trip?\n\nAnd what time of year is best?\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
