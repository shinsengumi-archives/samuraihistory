I&#39;ve seen some here and there so far.\n&gt; As for ID&#39;s, you hit the nail on the head--I was 19 my\n&gt; whole year here as a ryuugakusei, and only got carded\n&gt; once--and that wasn&#39;t for age, but to check what\n&gt; country I was from! The bar only made gaijin show ID!\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n\n\n\n"
