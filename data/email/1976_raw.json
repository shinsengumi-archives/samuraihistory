It would be best to put your trust in\n&gt;your teacher, follow his advice as to what suits your body style and\n&gt;the style of swordsmanship you intend to practice.\n&gt;\tStay away from swords with plastic handles, anything made in\n&gt;Spain or with a &quot;chromed&quot; hamon. I like the folks at Meirin Sangyo,\n&gt;they are a bit cheaper but basically have the same things available\n&gt;all over Japan.Bob Elder at East Coast Martial Arts is another good\n&gt;guy, I recommend you contact him first. Noshu-Iaido and Bugei are a\n&gt;bit pricey but have a selection to choose from. I have seen Gunto and\n&gt;Showa-to converted to use as Iaito with good results but would\n&gt;strongly urge against using anything older for martial arts practice.\n&gt;\tThe San Francisco Sword show is coming up and can&#39;t say\n&gt;enough good things about it. Many of the dealers have swords\n&gt;outfitted for iai and or fixer uppers ready for use. It is THE best\n&gt;place to nail a bargain. Hope to see some of you all there...\n&gt;Tom\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
