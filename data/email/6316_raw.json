Their approach was &lt;BR&gt;\nsomew=\r\nhat more pragmatic. The sword represents them, rather than &lt;BR&gt;\nthey being =\r\nsymbolised by the sword.&quot;\n\nI think you&#39;ll find that in addition to being to=\r\nugh and pragmatic the \nSengoku warrior was also very superstitious. It was =\r\nduring this period that \nwe see the greatest number of carvings on sword bl=\r\nades and the majority of \nthese were religeous in nature. The sword in addi=\r\ntion to being a weapon was \na talisman. At the time the signature, carvings=\r\n, fittings and even temper-\nline were seen to carry good or bad fortune. No=\r\nt just the sword but his \narmour as well often carried symbols of his belie=\r\nf in certain deities or \nsects. Yes they stood in the line and saw for them=\r\nselves the awesome power \nof the sword and for that reason they fervently s=\r\naid their prayers and were \nconvinced a good sword was more than just good =\r\nsteel. The swords passed\ndown \nto us today were preserved because they were=\r\n of better make but also\nbecause \nthey saved Great-Granpas rear on some lon=\r\ng ago battlefield.\n\n &quot;The names of sword, as discussed,&lt;BR&gt;\nowe nothing to =\r\nmystique, more to about how someone came into&lt;BR&gt;\npossession of the blade.&quot;=\r\n\n\nThe great swords of old were appreciated from the time of the first Shogu=\r\nn \nand before. Onimaru Kunitsuna and Dojigiri Yasutsuna to name two, were\nf=\r\named \nfor their cutting ability. The Hi no Moto cherished spear of Kuroda B=\r\nushi \nfame proved it&#39;s worth in battle and recieved it&#39;s name and fame befo=\r\nre the \n&quot;poofy&quot; days of the Tokugawa. Yes there are the Matsui Go and Ikeda=\r\n\nMasamune \nbut also the Dragon-fly cutter and the Devil&#39;s Butcher knife!\n\n&quot;=\r\nMystique - I don&#39;t think so - just the sepia-tinted voice of\nignorance, sen=\r\ntimentality and nostalgia.&quot;\n\nAgain, I would point out that the famed swords=\r\n which we know today, were \nfamous BEFORE the Tokugawa and recieved their n=\r\names from the\nbattle-hardened \nSengoku samurai we like to hold-up as the id=\r\neal.\n\n&quot;If one hand to examine the effect of the sword close up, I bet that&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;\ngoes some way to dispelling the mystique)&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\nIn fact, I wonder wh=\r\nether &#39;mystique&#39; occurs when one doesn&#39;t know&lt;BR&gt;\nenough about the object t=\r\no appreciate it properly?&quot;\n\nI would agree with this last bit especially as =\r\nit concerns modern man\nmaking \na show of naming his newly acquired &quot;samurai=\r\n sword.&quot; However it is a matter \nof historical fact that Tokugawa Ieyasu (a=\r\n very practical fellow by all \naccounts) forbid anyone to carry a Muramasa =\r\nblade in his presence because\nhe \nwas convinced that they were especially u=\r\nnlucky for members of his family.\n\n-t\n\n\n-----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\nmail2web - Check your email from the web =\r\nat\nhttp://mail2web.com/ .\n\n\n\n"
