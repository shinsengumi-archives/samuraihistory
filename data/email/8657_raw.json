Yes, I am quite familiar  with the process of seppuk=\r\nu. I have been researching seppuku for the  past 3-4 years for this project=\r\n, specifically its social and political  significance during the Tokugawa P=\r\neriod. My argument is that the  significance of seppuku changed during the =\r\nTokugawa due to several  factors... The greatest of of these being the abse=\r\nnce of widespread  warfare to the extent in which it occured during the Sen=\r\ngoku Jidai. \n  \n  I just wanted to see if anyone had a strong opinion about=\r\n the changes  in the philosophy of seppuku since the time of its inception.=\r\n \n  \n  Jonathan\n\nfederico trejos &lt;federicotrejos@...&gt; wrote:        G=\r\nood monrning.\n  \n  As I understand, seppuku was the way a samurai redemes\n =\r\n his honor from a mistake he commited.\n  Then as I see this; there must be =\r\nno difference at\n  all.\n  Do you know the formal process and the significan=\r\nce of\n  each part of the ritual ???   If not I will be glad to\n  help you.\n=\r\n  \n  Bye. \n  \n  __________________________________________________\n  Correo=\r\n Yahoo!\n  Espacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam =A1gratis! =\r\n\n  Reg=EDstrate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n  \n  \n          \n\n  =\r\n  ---\n  Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n  http://www.samurai-archive=\r\ns.com/writcon2.html\n  \n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n=\r\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---  \n=\r\n\n                    \n        \n---------------------------------\n    YAHOO!=\r\n GROUPS LINKS  \n  \n      \n    Visit your group &quot;samuraihistory&quot; on the web.=\r\n\n     \n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n samuraihistor=\r\ny-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n     \n    Your use of Yahoo!
