Even christians was killed\nthere, between jews, homosexuals, and protestants.\n\nNow, as ye said: we now just go &quot;get back on topic&quot;!\n\n\nAbout Oda Nobunaga &quot;just fighting military threats&quot;, what secluded monks\nwith nenjus and hunting-bows, and weaponless villagers could do to be a\n&quot;Military Threat&quot; is totally unknow to me.\n\nPe. Francisco Xavier entered in Japan through LIES and THREASON from the\nbeggining. I&#39;ve read a copy of the original message of him to the pope with\na translation to portuguese, and he admited that, to introduce christianity\nto japan, they would deliberatelly LIE and ACT WITH FALSEHOOD, disguissing\nchristian religious practices with the buddhist ones...\n\nThey had a conspiratory behaviour since the begining, and Tokugawa just did\nwhat is right for the Japan national security, avoiding the terror that\nhappened in the hands of Nobunaga, and in Europe to the native religions\nthere.\n\nThey even attempted to kill Tokugawa himself.\n\nAbout the PC discourse that &quot;many religions did something reprobable in\ntheir history&quot;, no one did so much bloodshed than christianism, inclusive in\nJapan, and after the end of the Vietnan War, the catholic administrator put\n(again in recent history) several buddhist monks in concentration champs\n(fields), under the excuse to &quot;fight the communism&quot;. Unlike certain other\nreligions who have the habit to burn others when something they don&#39;t like\nhappens, the buddhist monks had burned their own bodies!!!!!\n\nBushido is a way of Honour and LOYALTY! and again, those christians should\nnot be called Samurai!\n\nStop the lies. Where is all that compassion and love?\n\nSincerely\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\nMessage: 8\n   Date: Fri, 30 Jan 2004 00:44:24 EST\n   From: burker1@...\nSubject: Re: Samurai is not christian\n\nHilter was a not a Catholic and can we please get back on topic.
