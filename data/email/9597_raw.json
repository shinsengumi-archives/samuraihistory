These are two =\r\nmanga that deal with the bakumatsu period. From\n&gt; the Ebay description:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; These are two Japanese Bakumatsu era themed manga - &quot;Sono Toki Rekishi\n&gt; =\r\nga Ugoita - Bakumatsu Edition&quot;, which covers seven historical events\n&gt; from=\r\n the Bakumatsu era of Japanese history, including the now\n&gt; legendary Ikeda=\r\nya Incident, in which the Shinsengumi killed and\n&gt; captured Choshu loyalist=\r\ns at the Ikedaya inn, the assassination of\n&gt; Sakamoto Ryoma, and &quot;The Last =\r\nBattle of Hijikata Toshizo&quot;. The &quot;Sono\n&gt; Toki&quot; manga series is based on the=\r\n NHK television series of the same\n&gt; name which dramatically examines semin=\r\nal moments in Japanese history\n&gt; from a purely historical perspective. This=\r\n manga was published in\n&gt; 2003, and is 504 pages.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Second manga is =\r\n&quot;Hidamari no Ki&quot;, a fictionalized account of\n&gt; events during the Bakumatsu =\r\nperiod by Tezuka Osamu, with stories about\n&gt; Henry Heusken, Townsend Harris=\r\n, and other notable Bakumatsu era\n&gt; figures. This manga was published in 20=\r\n02, and has 336 pages. There\n&gt; are some minor stains on the outside edge, b=\r\nut it is in good\n&gt; condition. Both manga have colorful dust jackets which a=\r\nre in good\n&gt; condition, and are Japanese imports.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the Ebay =\r\nlink to the auction:\n&gt; http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=\r\n=3D190123948646\n&gt; \n&gt; I will be selling off at least one more Japanese histo=\r\nry related batch\n&gt; after this auction finishes. Help support the Journal!\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"
