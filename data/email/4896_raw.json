O. SCOTT\n\nPublished: July 23, 2004\n\n=\r\nThe hero of &quot;The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi&quot; is a sightless fighter \nwho wan=\r\nders through feudal Japan in the guise of an itinerant \nmasseur. Though he =\r\nmay be unfamiliar to most American audiences, \nZatoichi is a fixture in the=\r\n pop culture of his native land, having \nbeen the subject, from 1962 to 198=\r\n9, of 26 movies and scores of \ntelevision episodes. (An ample selection of =\r\nthe movies is available \nin subtitled DVD versions from Home Vision Enterta=\r\ninment.)\n\nIn all of them =E2=80&quot; including &quot;Zatoichi at the Blood Fest,&quot; &quot;Z=\r\natoichi \nMeets Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;Zatoichi Meets the One-Armed Swordsman&quot; =E2=80=\r\n&quot; \nZatoichi was played by Shintaro Katsu, who died in 1997. Now Takeshi \nKi=\r\ntano, a monument of Japanese popular culture in his own right, has \ntaken u=\r\np Katsu&#39;s sword in an act of brutal, loving homage.\n\nMr. Kitano, also known=\r\n as Beat Takeshi, is a genre director who has, \nwith movies like &quot;Sonatine,=\r\n&quot; &quot;Kikujiro&quot; and &quot;Brother,&quot; acquired the \ncachet of an international art-ho=\r\nuse star. He has specialized in \nvariations on the yakuza gangster film, wh=\r\nich makes &quot;The Blind \nSwordsman&quot; something of a departure because Mr. Kitan=\r\no has traded in \nthe yakuza&#39;s big pistols and dark suits for samurai swords=\r\n and \ntraditional kimonos. But his new film, which opens today in New York =\r\n\nafter winning prizes at festivals in Venice, Toronto, Marrakesh and \nCatal=\r\nonia (as well as five Japanese Academy Awards), retains many of \nthe hallma=\r\nrks of his directing style. The grisly mayhem is balanced \nby a quiet, prec=\r\nise sense of formal decorum, and a brutal, vengeful \nworldview coexists wit=\r\nh a disarmingly sentimental moralism.\n\nAbove all, there is Mr. Kitano himse=\r\nlf, with his heavily lined, \nimpassive countenance and his bowlegged, stoop=\r\n-shouldered grace. He \nuses Zatoichi&#39;s blindness to emphasize the rocklike =\r\nstillness that \nmakes him scary and charismatic. His natural grimace occasi=\r\nonally \ntwitches into a grin as he anticipates the next fight.\n\nAnd there a=\r\nre plenty of those, because Zatoichi inhabits a world \noverrun with corrupt=\r\n gang bosses and their mercenary minions, most of \nwhom he dispatches with =\r\ngeysers of bright blood and overdubbed grunts \nand moans. He is aided by a =\r\nhapless, good-hearted gambler and by a \npair of geishas, one of them a tran=\r\nsvestite, who are determined to \navenge the murder of their parents many ye=\r\nars earlier.\n\nThe swordfighting sequences are more a matter of efficient ca=\r\nrpentry \n(or butchery, if you prefer) than inspired choreography, but there=\r\n is \nnonetheless a certain elegance to Mr. Kitano&#39;s methods. For all his \ng=\r\nlowering deadpan, he is not without wit, in his Keatonesque acting \nand in =\r\nhis direction. At several points, as if subliminally riffing \non the signif=\r\nicance of the nickname Beat, he mischievously \nsynchronizes onscreen noises=\r\n with Keiichi Suzuki&#39;s score, turning \noffhand moments into self-contained =\r\nmusical numbers that foreshadow \nthe full-scale song-and-dance explosion th=\r\nat comes as soon as the \nlast bad guy has been killed.\n\nLike many musicals,=\r\n &quot;The Blind Swordsman&quot; works better in individual \nscenes than as a whole. =\r\nMr. Kitano is not the most disciplined \nstoryteller, and the plot meanders =\r\nalong tangents and stumbles into \nflashbacks, losing momentum for long stre=\r\ntches in the middle. It \noften feels like many episodes of a serial compres=\r\nsed into a single \nfeature. This may, in the end, be easier to digest than =\r\n25 sequels \nand a hundred hours of television. It may also whet your appeti=\r\nte for \nmore.\n\n&quot;The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi&quot; is rated R (Under 17 require=\r\ns \naccompanying parent or adult guardian) for many bloody fight scenes.\n\nTH=\r\nE BLIND SWORDSMAN\nZatoichi\n\nDirected and edited by Takeshi Kitano; written =\r\n(in Japanese, with \nEnglish subtitles) by Mr. Kitano, based on a short stor=\r\ny by Kan \nShimozawa; director of photography, Katsumi Yanagijima; music by =\r\n\nKeiichi Suzuki; production designer, Norihiro Isoda; produced by \nMasayuki=\r\n Mori and Tsunehisa Saito; released by Miramax Films. Running \ntime: 116 mi=\r\nnutes. This film is rated R.\n\nWITH: Beat Takeshi (Zatoichi), Tadanobu Asano=\r\n (Gennosuke Hattori), \nYui Natsukawa (O-Shino), Michiyo Ookusu (Aunt O-Ume)=\r\n, Gadarukanaru \nTaka (Shinkichi) and Yuuko Daike (O-Kinu).\n\n\n\n\n"
