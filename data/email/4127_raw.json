It is in fact pretty much the orthodox \nway to interpret Nobunaga&#39;s role. He was the one who broke down the \nold barriers. At the same time he put together enough of the pieces \nand had built up enough momentum in the unification effort to allow \nsomeone else to succeed should he fail.\n\nAt the same time I&#39;ve always enjoyed wondering if Nobunaga himself \ncould have carried it off. At times I&#39;m not so sure if he had the \nadministrative and political skills to consolidate his gains. I&#39;m \nleft to believe that each of the three men - Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, \nIeyasu - each played the role in the &quot;unification&quot; process that they \nwere perfectly suited to.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n"
