I agree with one of these points.\n\n&gt;Whether Gothic or Maximilian,  German or Italian \n&gt;or French, the armourers seemed to take more care in what we would call the \n&gt;ergonomics of armor than did their contemporaries in Japan.  \n&gt;\nSince Japanese armor seems highly flexible, with a large amount of \nadjustment, they obviously thought that fit was important. I think that \nany of the reenacting types that have used reproductions of both \nprobably don&#39;t feel much difference in that. Also I don&#39;t think it would \nbe possible in summer to fight in Japan using European armor. You would \ndie from the heat.\n\n&gt;If one studies \n&gt;merely the arm defenses of both knight and samurai...not getting into the \n&gt;technical terms French or Japanese..it seems apparent (at least to me)  that there \n&gt;was more technical sophistication, including armpit armor,  in the armor shops \n&gt;of Augsburg than in Sakai.\n&gt;\nI really doubt that, I suspect the craftsmen built the best of what was \nwanted. The Japanese were fine workers of metal in period.\n\n&gt;  Of course, the question arises also did Japan have \n&gt;the mineral resources to produce all the steel armor  that Europe had?  \n&gt;\nNo, but I don&#39;t think they would have ever used full plate because of \nthier climate. Trained knights swooned and died in armor in 60-70 degree \nweather, what would happen at 95+?\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Josh Wilson&quot; &lt;lordwilson@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Of course, the question arises also did Japan have \n&gt;the mineral resources to produce all the steel armor  that Europe had?  Jack&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Nope.. thats why they used iron sparingly in their armour and for the most part it was made out of leather.. the iron they had went towards swords...\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhile leather was used in armor, one hell of a lot of iron was used as \nwell. Why not look at Anthony Bryant&#39;s site on the subject? It will \nserve as a great intro to the subject, actually more than intro! and you \ncan find out how it&#39;s really made.\n\nhttp://www.sengokudaimyo.com/katchu/0.Katchu.html\n\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Actually, that&#39;s not true. The vast majority of armours -- especially post 1500 \n&gt;-- were made entirely of metal. Armour-grade leather was more problematic than \n&gt;armour-grade iron.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe guru speaks but does not pass on the site of all wisdom ;)\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
