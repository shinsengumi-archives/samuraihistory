From what I know he \nwas, in essence, knighted by the Japanese government.  This was back in the \nlate 50s or early 60s I believe.  He was also given the surname of \n&quot;Hanokami&quot; with his knighting-esque award.  I hope that this made some kind \nof sense and I appologize if anyone finds it hard to believe.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCheck out the new MSN 9 Dial-up ï¿½ fast & reliable Internet access with prime \nfeatures! http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=dialup/home&ST=1\n\n\n\n"
