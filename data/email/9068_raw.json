I am just north of Charlotte NC and I can help you with =\r\nall kinds of things. I know enough Nihongo to help you speak it and if I ca=\r\nn I know someone who can. And the sword issue we got you covered there too.=\r\n I have seen the corrections that the scholars give in this site and I feel=\r\n that if you need to know something just ask and some one will get the corr=\r\nect answer to you as soon as possible. However, for any of those things I m=\r\nentioned earlier just contact me off of the group and I would be way more t=\r\nhan happy to help you.

I thank you for \nletting me join this group. I =\r\nonly discovered the Samurai in 2003, \nofcourse I had heard of them before, =\r\nbut I didnt really know anything \nabout them. As corney as it may sound, th=\r\ne film The Last Samurai got \nme intrested, after that I discovered my calli=\r\nng. I started to read \nany book I could find on the Samurai and their code =\r\nof moral conduct, \nBushido. The more I read, the more they fascinated me. H=\r\now, with a \nfew exceptions, these brave men (and sometimes even women to) l=\r\nived \nby a strict moral code, from the time they woke up in the moring to \n=\r\nthe time they went to sleep. The trained in the art of the sword, and \nhelp=\r\n honor above all. I felt alonging to become like this, but \nofcourse I thou=\r\nght the Samurai were gone, just like most warriors of \nold. But then I disc=\r\norverd that people were still practicing their \nways, and tring to live as =\r\nmuch like a Samurai as one could in this \nday and age. This is a goal in wh=\r\nich I would like to strive for. I am \ndoing my best to study the philosophy=\r\n of Bushido and to learn the Art \nof the Sword on my own, unfortunatly ther=\r\ne are no dojos in columbia \nSouth Carolina that teach such things. If there=\r\n is anyone on this \ngroup that could help me I would be greatly honored.
