The amount of translating involved, as well as school, \nfamily and work obligations takes away from any real time to make any \nmajor updates to the page.  We are looking at a publishing date of \nsometime in the future within the last 4 - 5 months of this year, but \ndon&#39;t have a solid timetable down.  Anyway, the one publisher we have \nbeen looking at has a [hopefully] temporary hold on new manuscripts \nuntil they catch up on an apparently large backlog of books that are \nwaiting to be published.  At the very least, we intend to keep \nthe &#39;Samurai of the Week&#39;  changed each week, and keep this list \nmoderated (so don&#39;t worry if it takes a day or two for one of us to \napprove a message).  Anyway, somewhat on topic - since updates from \nus may not be too forthcoming on the page for a while, if there is \nanyone out there who wants to put together some &#39;samurai desktop \nwallpaper&#39; for us to put on the &#39;downloads&#39; page, or even create \nsome &#39;samurai&#39; related &#39;skins&#39; for games such as &quot;the sims&quot;, &quot;half-\nlife&quot;, etc.,  email me off the list (especially the sims!)  at \nkitsuno@... and we&#39;ll see about adding them to \nour &#39;downloads&#39; section.\n\nC.West\n\n\n"
