Many Japanese  \nwarlords hastened to master the tec=\r\nhniques for producing them. As  \nearly as 1549 Oda Nobunaga bought 500 matc=\r\nhlocks from gunsmiths in  \nKunitomo in Omi (now Shiga Prefecture) and estab=\r\nlished a firearms  \nbrigade in his army. In the 1550s Takeda Shingen, lord =\r\nof the  \nprovince of Kai (now Yamanashi Prefecture), also organized a firea=\r\nrms  \nunit.\nBy the late 16th century firearms (teppo) had become the most  =\r\n\nimportant offensive weapon; perhaps a third of the daimyo armies of  \nthe =\r\n1570s carried guns. Oda Nobunaga used his firearms units to  \nadvantage in =\r\nthe Battle of Anegawa in 1570 and in the Battle of  \nNagashino in 1575. Toy=\r\notomi Hideyoshi also supplied his troops with  \nfirearms, which he used dur=\r\ning his campaigns against the Shimazu  \nfamily of Kyushu in 1586 and agains=\r\nt the Later Hojo family in the  \nOdawara Campaign in 1590.\nThe spread of fi=\r\nrearms helped to stimulate industrial and commercial  \nactivities by creati=\r\nng an increased demand for muskets, ammunition,  \nand other mat=E9riel. Als=\r\no, the popularization of firearms, together  \nwith the establishment of an =\r\narmed infantry, largely recruited from  \nthe peasantry, promoted social mob=\r\nility.
