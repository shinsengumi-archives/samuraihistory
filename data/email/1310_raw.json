If you are still in Yamaguchi Ken I am sure\nyou can find most of them at any big video rental shop.\n\nTaiga Drama has been around since 1962. of the forty plus drams the ones you\nmight be interested in are;\n\nKashin (1977) this was about Choshu in the Bakumatsu period\n\nTobu ga yuku (1990) Saigo Takamori\n\nShishi no Jidai (1980) Aizu-Wakamatsu\n\nSome other bakumatsu Taiga dramas not available on video are Hana no shogai\n(II Naosuke) Ryoma ga Yuku (Sakamoto Ryoma) Katsu Kaishu, and Tokugawa\nYoshinobu.\n\nIn addition to the year long Taiga drama NHK also does a 2 hourspecial for\nshogatsu. 2000 was Tenkoku no Yume about Yoshida Shoin and Takasugi\nShinsaku.\n\nOn other channels there have been a plethora of jidai gekis about the\nbakumatsu period. I have about 130 titles courtesy mostly Seimon Jidai Geki\nChannel. There have been many dramas about Takasugi Shinsaku, Yoshida Shoin,\nKiheitai, as well as the shinsengumi, Sakamoto Ryoma, Goryo kaku etc etc.\nCurrently the Family Channel has been airing Tenno no Seki from 1970. This\nis all about the period the Black ships on.\n\n\n\n\n"
