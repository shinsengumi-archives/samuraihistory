Currently selling at a reasonable =A37.95 on Amazo=\r\nn.....\n\n                            Rod Johnson\n\nSynopsis on Amazon site\nTh=\r\nis is a true and revealing account of the Ninja, the Japanese clandestine w=\r\narrior cult of assassins and spies that has acquired a legendary status amo=\r\nng martial arts enthusiasts and military historians. From material previous=\r\nly unpublished in the West, Stephen Turnbull recounts the history, battles,=\r\n science, mysticism and even the modern aspects of the Ninja. Many of the s=\r\nources for this book are his own translations from Japanese archives. Myths=\r\n about the Ninja are exploded but the truth emerges here as far stronger th=\r\nan any fiction, making this work destined to become the standard work. \n\n\n[=\r\nNon-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
