When the daimyos took \nthis name for them, or whoever that chose it, they were thinking in \nthat figure of the 11th century? Or was just the &quot;great name&quot; thing?\n(Sorry if that thing was discussed earlier).\n\nRodrigo Juri A.\n\nPS: I erased the former messages in order to limit the extension of \nthe post. If someone thinks that this is not right, please tell me.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Michael Lorimer \n&lt;mijalo_jp@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well, there were daimyo as far back as the 11th Century, although \nthey were very different from the daimyo of the Sengoku or Edo jidai. \nThe wealthier member of the rural peasantry were called &#39;myoshu&#39; \n(literally &#39;head of a named rice paddy&#39;). When the myoshu moved on to \nacquire more fields they became &#39;daimyo&#39; (literally &#39;great name&#39;). \nTheir duties included collecting dues for their lord, but by the late \n11th Century, many were making the rural situation even more \ncomplicated by placing their land under the indirect supervision of a \ndistant lord (eg; a Fujiwara noble or one of the larger Kenmon \ntemples).  These myoshu/daimyo were the foundations of the latter \njizamurai/ kokujin (basically the lower echelons of the military \nclass). \n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; \nhave been removed]\n\n\n\n"
