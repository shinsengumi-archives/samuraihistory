I was wondering if anyone\n&gt; could answer my following questions. If you can&#39;t, do you know about\n&gt; any websites where I can email someone about it?\n&gt; Here is the questions\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. How old were the boys when they were recruited as samurais?\n&gt; 2. Did you have to be of the the upper class to be become one?\n&gt; 3. Did they got to war against each other?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m afraid you&#39;re missing a few key points.\n\nSamurai were a social class. This answers your first two questions.\n\nOne was BORN into it. No one was &quot;recruited&quot; as a samurai.\n\nAnd as to three: of COURSE. They were the warrior class, of course  \nthey did.\n\nTo write an essay, you really should READ some material rather than  \njust asking questions. Let the material you read produce the questions  \nas they answer others. Just about any cursory reading of ANYTHING on  \nsamurai (for example, the wikipedia article) would have had the  \nanswers to these questions.\n\nTony\n\n"
