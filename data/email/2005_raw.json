A latch very much like that on Gunto was \noccasionally seen on tanto especially ones with metal saya. Satsuma \ndandies liked to flaunt their &quot;manly hot-headedness&quot; by sporting \ncords that tied the tsuka to the saya. These prevented the sword from \nbeing drawn except with the most deliberate effort. Suggesting to \nsome that you better not get the man angry...\n\tThe koiguchi or opening on a proper saya should be airtight, \nto prevent moisture getting in the scabbard and keep ones sword from \nfalling out. In the movies there is often an audible &quot;Click&quot; when \nthis seal is broken. I imagined this is what the writer meant and it \nhelped keep my mental images &quot;honest.&quot;\n\tI believe the writer went to great pains to make his book \nENGLISH. Thus he used English terms whereever possible, even in cases \nwhere the Japanese term is widely used. While I applaud his efforts, \nI found this one of the most annoying aspects of his style and it \ndetracted greatly from the book for me.\n\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
