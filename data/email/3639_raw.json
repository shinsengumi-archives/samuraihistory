A few years back at the beginning \nof my graduate study I was doing a report on something samurai-related and \ncontacted Prof. Karl Friday.  I had reached what I believed to be an \nimpasse and my poor level of Japanese did not seem to be up to the task of \nporing over scads of kamakura-era texts in the time allotted for the \nproject.  In any event, after a few VERY helpful exchanges with Prof. \nFriday pointing me in some interesting directions I made reference to a \nhistory channel thing that he (and Cameron Hurst and Turnbull) appeared on \nin support of something that I believed, and he said in no uncertain terms \nthat they had taken his comments out of context and edited the interview in \nsuch a way that it appeared that he was espousing a viewpoint that was \nactually nearly the opposite of what he actually believes.\n\nThe Moral?  Don&#39;t believe everything you see on t.v....\n\n-Shannon\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\u001b$BM&#39;C#$H\u001b(B24\u001b$B;~4V%[%C%H%i%$%s!V\u001b(BMSN \u001b$B%a%C%;%s%8%c!&lt;!W!&quot;:#$9$0%@%&%s%m!&lt;%I!*\u001b(B  \nhttp://messenger.msn.co.jp \n\n\n"
