Plz Explain... Was: Tokugawa Evil?\n&gt; \n&gt; I forgot the nickname for Gustav, &quot;Lion of the North&quot;? God protect us \n&gt; from Vikings and Irish (old English prayer) It would be hard \n&gt; to point to \n&gt; a culture on earth that didn&#39;t have wars. May be I should us the term \n&gt; civilization (city folk) since there were a few hunter \n&gt; gatherer tribes \n&gt; that weren&#39;t very warlike.\n\n\nLion of the North?  No thats more like Karl the 12th.\n\n\n \n&gt; Time to crack the books again ;) I know from personal experience that \n&gt; NONE of the juicy bits of history are taught in most grade schools.\n\nNot in Sweden, they teach it with a fair deal of gore and slaying to\nkeep the class intrested.\nBut in Highschool, they calm down with the slaying bit, and actually\ntell you about the society in a historical perspective.\n\n\n&gt; To keep this on topic, I would contrast and compare the \n&gt; armies of the 30 \n&gt; years war with the Sengoku period armies. I would consider \n&gt; Japan to be a \n&gt; decent military power until Gustavus introduced fast and mobile \n&gt; artillery after which Europe keeps developing its military and Japan \n&gt; lies stagnant.\n\nI still think you are misstaking him for Karl the 12th.\n\nFantastic Fact: Sweden is the only country in the world (to my\nknowledge) that has actually managed to conqer Russia, and Moscow. The\nrussians were kinda cool about and said that If you put the Crownprins\nin Moscow, we will let you stay, and you have two weeks to comply. We\ndidnt. They threw us out. So for two weeks, the russian emoire was a\npart of Sweden.\n\nThe Japanese military didnt evolv at all untill the meji revolution.\nKinda stagnant for 400 years...\n\n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
