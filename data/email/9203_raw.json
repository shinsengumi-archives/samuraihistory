Th=\r\nis also means that you do not have to create an\naccount to do searches and =\r\nread the information, etc.  Here is the\nmain page:\n\nhttp://wiki.samurai-arc=\r\nhives.com/\n\nYou only need to sign up if you want to edit or add articles.  =\r\nThat&#39;s\nthe only reason one would really need or want to sign up.  If you\nha=\r\nven&#39;t taken a look at the SamuraiWiki yet, it is worth poking\naround. Some =\r\ncategories have hundreds of entries, others only 3 or 4.\nIt&#39;s only been onl=\r\nine for 2 months, so there is still a lot of work to\ngo. Some categories th=\r\nat people here might find interesting could be\nthe &quot;Samurai&quot; Category:\n\nhtt=\r\np://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=3DCategory:Samurai\n\nThe &quot;Buju=\r\ntsu&quot; Category:\n\nhttp://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=3DCategory=\r\n:Bujutsu\n\n&quot;Battles&quot;:\n\nhttp://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=3DCa=\r\ntegory:Battles\n\nAnd so on. There are about 1100 articles up so far.  If you=\r\n want to\ncontribute, there are only 2 rules:\n\n1. Cite your sources.\n2. If y=\r\nou plagarize from other sources, you will probably be banned\nwithout a warn=\r\ning.\n\n\n\n"
