I \n&gt; only have one Japanese source which isn&#39;t very\n&gt; clear, and no english \n&gt; sources available to me.\n\n7 pages of hits on Yahoo (English), but 50% of them\nwere about the anime &quot;Ranma 1/2&quot;, which apparently has\none character named Soun and one named Hojo. Who knew?\n\nThe other range from, well, SAMURAI-ARCHIVES.COM (I\nwas really tempted to post THAT for you, he he) to\nsome pages claiming Hojo Soun was a model samurai and\na textbook practitioner of Bushido (this from the same\nsite that COMPLETELY butchers the Chushingura\nstory--did you know the 47 ronin killed the Shogun?\nIt&#39;s true--I saw it on the web). One excerpt I found\nfollows:\n\n&quot; 1507-51 \n \nA typical Sengoku daimyo, who rose by his wits \n\nSoun founded the &#39;later&#39; Hojo. This clan is to be\ndistinguished from the Hojo of the Kamukura Period.\nHis original name was Ise Shinkurï¿½, but he took the\ntonsure and assumed a monk&#39;s name, Soun. He was\nprobably born into the Ise family of Kyoto, although\nthis is not certain and details are unclear. In the\nSengoku Period there were many who rose to prominence\nfrom humble beginnings, and so whose early life is not\nrecorded. Skill in war assured such men a place among\nthe &#39;upstart&#39; daimyo class. \nSoun won the trust of the Imagawa when he interceded\nin their internal familial disputes. He was given\ncharge of Kokokuji Castle, which had a strategic\nlocation guarding the Kanto. In 1491, he built\nNirayama Castle to reside in. Soun gained control of\nIzu, and took Odawara Castle in Sagami, thus mounting\nthe first step in the unification of the Kanto. He\norganised the development of towns around his castles,\nconducted land surveys, and laying the foundations of\nlong-lasting rule. \nIn 1518, control of his house was usurped by Hojo\nUjitsuna. Soun died the following year at Nirayama\naged 88. He was regarded as a calm and honest man who\nwould rather govern in peace than attack, and he is\nsaid to have been love by his people. He rose from\nbeing a nameless wanderer to being the master of the\nentire states of Izu and Sagami through his wits, and\nhis efforts ensured Hojo rule for five generations and\nover a century. He was also a man of great physical\nbeauty, without which none of this might have been\npossible.&quot;\n\nhttp://www.sengoku-expo.net/text/person/E/172.html\n\nI wasn&#39;t aware that Soun&#39;s son, Ujitsuna, &quot;usurped&quot;\npower. Takeda Shingen, yeah, he usurped power from his\nfather. My recollection is that Soun retired while he\ncould &quot;mentor&quot; his son, and that became a practice in\nthe Go-Hojo family. \n\nI&#39;m next going to hit Japanese Google, but I think you\nmay be out of luck when YOUR website is the best\nsource on the web in English--fabulous accomplishment,\nbut it&#39;s not going to help YOUR knowledge that much!\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
