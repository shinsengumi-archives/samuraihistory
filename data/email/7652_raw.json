Anyway, regarding the Will Adams Festival. \n\nThis is a one day event run by Medway Council in Gillingham, Kent on\nSaturday the 17th September 2005. It starts at 10:45 and goes on until\ncirca 17:00. Activities are centred upon the Black Lion Leisure Centre\nand Gillingham&#39;s High Street (just to the south).\n\nSorry to say that the folks at Medway still haven&#39;t set up a dedicated\nwebsite for the event. And even if you Google, you still tend only to\nget references to just past events created by attendees. It is so badly\npromoted that outside of its local area, no one has ever heard of it,\nneither Stephen Turnbull, or Ian Bottomley or the rest of the crew at\nLeeds were aware of the event when I mentioned it during the recent\nShogun exhibition, and it&#39;s been going for five years! Indeed I didn&#39;t\nfind out about it myself until last year, and it was I who had first\napproached them back in &#39;99 to suggest it for the year 2000 and the\n400th anniversary of Adam&#39;s arrival in Japan. Incidentally I&#39;ve just\nfound out that even the Japanese Embassy now has it listed as a &quot;new&quot;\nevent for 2005.\n\nThere&#39;s numerous demonstrations and displays, food, music etc. both in\nand out of doors. I and a handful of my group will be putting on a small\ndisplay, so if you manage to get along to it, come and say hi at the\nFight School&#39;s &quot;SHOGUN&quot; stand, just look for a JINMAKU (camp curtain)\nand a collection of banners near the Leisure Centre.\n\nFor further information contact either: \n\nMedway Visitor Centre, 95 High Street, Rochester, Kent, ME1 1LX.\nEmail: visitor.centre@... \nTelephone: 01634 843666\nFax: 01634 847891\nMinicom: 01634 333111 \n\nOR\n\nThe Black Lion Leisure Centre, Mill Road, Gillingham, Kent, ME7 1HF.\nEmail: blacklion@... \nTelephone: 01634 283700\n Minicom: 01634 333111\n\nTo find the Centre via Multimap.com go here:\n\nhttp://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&search_result=&db=p\nc&cidr_client=none&lang=&pc=ME71HF&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicks\nearch=ME7+1HF&addr3=&addr1=\n\n\nI hope some of you find this useful and fun.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
