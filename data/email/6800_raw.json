Can anyone tell me what Kiyomori&#39;s \nparents address him as? It sounds like Heita: is this a title (eldest son??) \nor a family name?\n\nIncidentally, with reference to a couple of other threads, the word used \nin this film for clan is &quot;ichimon&quot; and what is translated in the subtitles \nas &quot;samurai&quot; seems to be invariably &quot;bushi.&quot;\n\nI thought Kurosawa might have been responsible for popularising \nsamurai as a word in the West, but in fact the early writers like Satow \nand Mitford (1870s) all use it as a term for the daimyo&#39;s retainers, and \nalready seem to invest it with a great deal of romantic feeling (see \nTales of Old Japan and A Diplomat in Japan) which they presumably \npicked up from contemporary Japanese. I don&#39;t know enough about \nEdo period to know how the two words were used then and what \ndifference there was. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nThanks,\n\nGillian \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Celebrate Yahoo!&#39;s 10th Birthday! \n&gt; Yahoo!
