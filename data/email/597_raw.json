Basically I&#39;m not a historian just a\nguy who\n&gt; loves reading history so the type of history books I would prefer to\nread\n&gt; are &#39;popular&#39;. I guess trained historians are interested in such\nacademic\n&gt; books, but I&#39;m just looking for a good story. \n\nI am in no means belittling your taste in books by my comments.  It&#39;s\njust that there is a big gulf, and it&#39;s probably widening with the\nscholarly book market and the academic book market.\n\n&gt;So in reply to Mr. Byants\n&gt; comment that people don&#39;t delve farther into the feild my feeling is\nthose\n&gt; books arn&#39;t very interesting to an amatuer historian. As for Massie,\nJames\n&gt; Mcpherson who wrote the Civil War history &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; said\nthat\n&gt; there was proffesional envy that his book sold well. Maybe this is the\ncase\n&gt; with Massie (maybe not). In any event I&#39;m not that interested in what\nthe\n&gt; AHA thinks about an author, I liked his books and will read him again.\n\n\nProfessional historians do have to worry about the AHA and what it says.\nLike any profession or professionals....\n\nMassie incidentally also got into deep trouble in the publishing world\nsince he was given a very large advance, produced nothing, and was\nthreatened with legal action (or maybe taken to court) over the Peter\nthe Great volume.  Stunts like this do not endear you with publishers no\nmatter how good your sales...\n\n&gt;As\n&gt; for Ambrose well I live in Japan (for some 8 years) so I haven&#39;t seen\n&gt; anything about his case. If true its sad because he is a good writer. \n\nWell, I live in Japan too, but I make sure I daily go through the\nelectronic edition of the NYTIMES and a few other foreign based papers\nevery so many days.  The NYTIMES has given it coverage, but not sure if\nthey are still free.  The issue has been discussed at length on the\nH-WAR list.  They have public archives at www.h-net.msu.edu (click the\nappropriate buttons to find H-WAR, and then just search the H-WAR list.\n\n\n&gt;So\n&gt; what I want to say is that I wish there were more popoular histories\nwritten\n&gt; about Japan. Imagine if someone wrote a book on the Meiji Restoration\nthe\n&gt; way Simon Schama wrote about the French Revolution, or a biography of\nOda\n&gt; Nobunaga on the scale of Massies Peter the Great.  Wishful thinking.\n\nProbably so for a variety of reasons.\n\nLater, MEH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
