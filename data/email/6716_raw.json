Hideyoshi was a great general, but his \n&gt;c=\r\nountry-bumpkin nature came out and he became a megalomaniac (=3Dfailure \n&gt;i=\r\nn Korea... or was it China??), Ieyasu was an intelligent man but had \n&gt;it &#39;=\r\nrelatively&#39; easy.\n&gt;\n&gt;One thing about Nobunaga that people do not discuss mu=\r\nch: a few years \n&gt;before being killed, he had adopted an Imperial Prince...=\r\n who knows \n&gt;what he was planning...\n&gt;\n&gt;cepo\n\nI disagree. Nobunaga was a fe=\r\narsome man, but he lacked Hideyoshi&#39;s\ngoverning ability, which in my opinio=\r\nn makes Hideyoshi the greater of\nthe three. If Nobunaga had not been murder=\r\ned, I don&#39;t think the\nunification would have gone nearly as smoothly. Nobun=\r\naga rubbed people\nthe wrong way, and out of fear I think you would have see=\r\nn the powerful\nclans rise against him in an effort to protect their autonom=\r\ny, as\nNobunaga showed that he expected all the land to be directly under th=\r\ne\ncontrol of himself and his close retainers.\n\nHideyoshi on the other hand =\r\nknew that the way to govern in the 16th\ncentury was not to destroy everybod=\r\ny in your way, but to reward and\ngarauntee the lands of the powerful daimyo=\r\n. Sure, the memory of\nNobunaga&#39;s ruthless actions earlier in the 16th centu=\r\nry probably gave\nthe daimyo a reason to want peace, but still...\n\nThe marks=\r\n against Hideyoshi were the two attempted invasions of Korea\nand the fact t=\r\nhat he did not have a realistic succession plan, thanks to\nthe forced suici=\r\nde of his previous heir, who from the sounds of things,\nmay have deserved i=\r\nt... It&#39;s hard to forgive the Korean invasion, but if\nhe had lived for awhi=\r\nle longer we may not have seen a Sekigahara, and\nperhaps a Toyotomi Bakufu?=\r\n\n\nAngus\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis=\r\n email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and i=\r\ns sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
