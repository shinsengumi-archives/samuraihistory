Will talk to my senses though and see if he\n&gt; knows anything about \n&gt; it. Thing is though, there was a large workshop on\n&gt; Sunday the 4th \n&gt; hear in Australia and no one mentioned anything\n&gt; about it\n\nApparently there are no techniques to recognize\nsarcasm, irony, or satire. \n\nI&#39;ll spell it out for everyone: THE WEBSITE IS A BOGUS\nJOKE! AS IS THE ULTIMATE POWER WEBSITE. ANY OF YOU WHO\nCANNOT RECOGNIZE THAT AND TAKE IT AT ALL SERIOUSLY\nNEED EITHER MENTAL COUNSELING, REMEDIAL LOGIC, OR A\nGOOD SWIFT BASEBALL BAT TO THE HEAD!\n\nThere IS NO NINJA DAY. STOP IT. NOW!\n\n(Zev: this last part isn&#39;t directly at you--it&#39;s at\neveryone.
