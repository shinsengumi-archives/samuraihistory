A friend showed me how.\nThere is a signature =\r\non the tang, quite long - a large number of\ncharacters. My friend had someo=\r\nne translate the signature and was told\nthat the smith who forged the blade=\r\n worked as a smith during the 1680&#39;s.\n\n  So, now I am intrigued by the hist=\r\nory of the sword and would like to\nsee if I can find information about the =\r\nsmith.\n\n  If I can figure out how to do it, and if the moderators of the gr=\r\noup\nsay it is okay, I will be glad to add a few photos to the album for thi=\r\ns\ngroup.\n\n  Thank you for your response and interest.\n\n  Scott\n  ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n  From: Carlo Tacchini \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com \n  Sent: Sunday, May 04, 2003 12:20 PM\n  Subject: R: [samuraihistory]=\r\n History of a Sword\n\n\n  Thanks Mr. Moore.\n  I&#39;m interested to the blade as =\r\nI read the reply of mr.

You truly have a treasure in your \n    possession.  The =\r\nfirst thing that could suggest is to have it\n    professionally \n    cleane=\r\nd and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the\n  blade\n\n    m=\r\nean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to\n  get\n  =\r\n  it \n    cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasa=\r\nya.\n      Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.\nProfession=\r\nal\n\n    polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take tw=\r\no\n    years \n    and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it=\r\n.  It will\n    keep \n    any rust currently on the blade from causing any m=\r\nore damage.\n      I hope this helped you.\n\n\n    Peace,\n\n    Matt\n\n    _____=\r\n____________________________________________________________\n    The new MS=\r\nN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \n    http://join.msn.com/?pa=\r\nge=3Dfeatures/junkmail\n\n\n\n    Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives=\r\n.com\n    ---\n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    samu=\r\nraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n    Your use of Yahoo!
