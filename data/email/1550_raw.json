L. Sadler and one \n&gt;by someone who&#39;s name I can&#39;t think of off the top of my head (conrad \n&gt;totman??).  At least one on Hideyoshi, by Mary Berry (it also has a \n&gt;lot of info on Nobunaga - this is one of my favorite books), and only \n&gt;one on Nobunaga that I know of by Jeroen Lamers, which I haven&#39;t read \n&gt;(and probably won&#39;t until the price drops way below its current $60 \n&gt;mark).  \n&gt;\n&gt;You should be able to find any of them on Amazon.com.  Then there is \n&gt;the sort of outdated overview of the 16th century by Sansom, but it \n&gt;is well written and an interesting read.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hi there.\n&gt;&gt;  Are there any biographies of Nobunaga, Toyotomi, Tokugawa or \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;Takeda in \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;English?
