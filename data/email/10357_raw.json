That&#39;s fine I=\r\n guess- I&#39;m a budding writer\n&gt; &gt; and you need to know the good things to, b=\r\nut for the life of me I\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t find the appropriate list of matching Sin=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Christianity as a whole has Sins and Virtues, as do most rel=\r\nigions\n&gt; &gt; and cultures in the world. They always come as a matching pair. =\r\nSo if\n&gt; &gt; Samurai have Virtues based on Bushido and the like, it would stan=\r\nd to\n&gt; &gt; reason they have Sins, too. But I can&#39;t find them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So.=\r\n..do they exist, and I&#39;m just missing them?

I don&#39;t think &quot;sin&quot; i=\r\nn a secular\n&gt; &gt; medieval Japanese context is the right word though - not to=\r\n mention,\n&gt; &gt; Bushido is definitely not a religion, although the impression=\r\n I get is\n&gt; &gt; that some modern Western martial artists will little knowledg=\r\ne of\n&gt; &gt; Japanese history treat it like it is.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text porti=\r\nons of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
