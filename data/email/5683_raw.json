It just came to my mind because in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (the DVD\n&gt; menu of the second disc) it says that &quot;for 1100 years the samurai \nhave\n&gt; lived by seven principles...&quot; or whatever, and I seem to remember \nthat\n&gt; the &quot;code&quot; was established after the samurai stopped serving a true\n&gt; military purpose with the peace of the Tokugawa era.\n&gt; \n&gt; Miburo Saitou\n\n\nI agree with Miburo. Bushido, literally translated &quot;Way of the \nWarrior,&quot; developed in Japan between the Heian and Tokugawa Ages (9th-\n12th century). It was a code and way of life for Samurai, a class of \nwarriors similar to the medieval knights of Europe. It puts emphasis \non loyalty, self-sacrifice, justice, sense of shame, refined manners, \npurity, modesty, frugality, martial spirit, honour and affection. \nHowever before there was bushido I am not sure what laws were part of \nthe samurai culture, will check resource marital.   \n\n\n\n\n"
