It tells a \nstory about Otori Clan. Was there really a clan called  Otori? It also tells \nabout people with extraordinary skills (such as  duplicating himself, jump as \nhigh as 10 metres an so on) called the tribe. Is  that true? or it&#39;s just the \nauthor&#39;s imagination?\n\nwell, i guess that&#39;s  all for this moment. thank you!\n\n\n\nI&#39;ve read a few of these books. They are pure fiction and are meant to be.  \nThe author wrote about &quot;the Three Islands&quot; rather than &quot;Japan.&quot; I&#39;ve found them \n enjoyable. But never, ever think that they were intended to history. The \nseries  is fantasy, fiction.\n \nNina aka Wave Tossed\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
