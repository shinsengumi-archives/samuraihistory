Hall&quot; &lt;markhall@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a few Rekishi Gunzo books, and even though Turnbull cites \nthem\n&gt; &gt; in his books, I HIGHLY DOUBT he actually reads them, or uses \nthem, in\n&gt; &gt; fact, most of what he has comes from Papinot&#39;s book, including the\n&gt; &gt; errors (as stated by kitsuno at the above link - including the \nfact\n&gt; &gt; that Turnbull doesn&#39;t CITE the book in his bibliography, which to \nme\n&gt; &gt; is outright plaigiarism) - and after 20 years of &#39;research&#39;, \nTurnbull\n&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t corrected any of his errors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, unlike the world of ancient Roman scholarship \nwhere if\n&gt; &gt; someone like Turnbull tried to pass himself off as a scholar he \nwould\n&gt; &gt; be hung, then after his corpse is burned at the stake, his remains\n&gt; &gt; would fed to lions, there is apparently no similar &#39;peer review&#39; \nin\n&gt; &gt; Japanese history scholarship in &quot;the West&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, for what it is worth, he is not the only shoddy and inaccurate\n&gt; historian out there these days.  Stanley Ambrose and Michael \nBesailles\n&gt; are two that have come under intense media scrutiny for plagiarism \nand\n&gt; falsification/errors.  And then there was the whole Fujimura scandal\n&gt; here in Japan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later, MEH\n\n\n"
