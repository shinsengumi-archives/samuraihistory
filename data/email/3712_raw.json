In order to get an idea of what was \ngoing on in the literary circles of the later 20th century one really cant \nget away without reading some Mishima (and Kawabata and Oe the Murakamis, \netc.)  On another side, it was an interesting side course for my study as I \nam interested in the ways that the samurai/bushido/martial tradition in \nJapan has been co-opted by people for their specific ends.  As such, \nMishima is very important.  He wrote a comment on Hagakure, he started to \nlift weights and study Kendo in his 30s (as a way to exemplify bunbu \nryodou), and wrote a book called wakaki samurai no tame ni.  Insane or not, \nthere is much to mine their for material for research and such.  Besides \nmany great writers were &quot;whacko.&quot;  Flaubert and Akutagawa come to mind.\n\nAs for the play, it was called _Patriotism_ and a film was made of it that \nhad such a graphic and realistic (as far as one would guess) depiction of \nseppuku that Mishima&#39;s widow had all extant copies of it (that she could \nget her hands on) destroyed.  My former University has one of the few \nsurviving copies.   \n\n-Shannon\n\n\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n\nExactly. He was a whacko writer (how can you read his\nbooks? The only one I could finish was Kinkakuji, and\nthat was for a class) who acted more in a moral and\nartistic protest than an attempt to really overthrow\nthe government or anything. That&#39;s very interesting\nabout the seppuku...how it was botched and so forth.\nThe movie about his live is very interesting, and he\nwas actually acting in a play at one point where his\ncharacter committed seppuku--I wonder how much he came\nto associate with that character. He was clearly\nmental, to say the least.\n\nNate\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
