I appreciate it.  I&#39;m sorry if I was too quick to take offense.  I suspect that there are &quot;serious historians&quot; out there who look down on wargaming.  Of course, I would argue that wargaming has done more to teach history to the masses that all the serious historians put together (or at least most of them).  :)\n\n  You are correct, I was using the term &quot;Renaissance&quot; to identify a particular period of time and not to identify a particular period in Japanese history.  Or, at the most, a particular time in Japanese warfare involving the use of artillery and firearms.\n\n  If you don&#39;t mind sharing, I would be interested in hearing more about your job.  How does one make a living involving wargames?\n\n  Thanks again.\n\n\nBob Burke\n\nIn a message dated 11/17/2003 11:44:12 AM Eastern Standard Time, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt;Not at all, and I apologize if that&#39;s how it came out.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Wargaming, in a fashion, is an integral part of my\n&gt;job. I&#39;ve got no disrespect at all for someone else\n&gt;who does it for fun. \n&gt;\n&gt;The point of my post is that in studying Japanese\n&gt;history, you do not use the term &quot;renaissance&quot; to\n&gt;describe any particular period of JAPANESE history.\n&gt;The &quot;Renaissance&quot; was a Western European phenomenon,\n&gt;by no means a world-wide event, and the use of it in\n&gt;connection with Japanese history smacks of cultural\n&gt;bias. Japan didn&#39;t HAVE a &quot;Renaissance&quot;, at least not\n&gt;in the same sense Europe did, so you can hopefully see\n&gt;my confusion as to the use of the word. \n&gt;\n&gt;When you mentioned you used it because it&#39;s a term\n&gt;used to describe that period in your wargaming, I\n&gt;dismissed the question. I certainly didn&#39;t mean to\n&gt;dismiss you--you answered my question for me. You were\n&gt;using the term in a familiar application to you--and\n&gt;now I understand that. If you had argued that it was a\n&gt;valid HISTORICAL period of Japan, I would have still\n&gt;been confused--would you mean the Azuchi-Momoyama\n&gt;period, because there was a flourishing of the arts?\n&gt;or would you mean the early Tokugawa, because of the\n&gt;watershed political changes? Very confusing. \n&gt;\n&gt;Again, nothing meant against wargaming--I was thinking\n&gt;in terms of a historical definition of the word. You\n&gt;merely were using it in a context unfamiliar to me,\n&gt;and I thank you for clearing it up. \n&gt;\n&gt;Nate\n&gt;\n&gt;--- burker1@... wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Do I detect a hint of condescension? ï¿½The key to\n&gt;&gt; successful wargaming is a thorough knowledge and\n&gt;&gt; understanding of history.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; In a message dated 11/17/2003 4:08:11 AM Eastern\n&gt;&gt; Standard Time, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; writes:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;Ah ha.

Nobunaga and\n&gt;&gt; Hideyoshi\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; castles were perfect \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; example of the artistic abundance and\n&gt;&gt; extravagance\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the period.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Bye,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cepo, Honolulu.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; PS=I have a couple of very nice shots of\n&gt;&gt; Hideyoshi&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; castle in Momoyama \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (Fushimi), is there any way I can share them with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you?
