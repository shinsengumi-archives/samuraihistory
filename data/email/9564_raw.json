Secondly, as with \nKen Watanabe in the mov=\r\nie, Saigo Takamori did indeed have deep \nrespect for the emperor.  Finally,=\r\n the failure of Saigo&#39;s rebellion \nwas partially due to the fact that he wa=\r\ns fighting in an old Japanese \nstyle, while the Meiji government had wester=\r\nnized their methods.  \nHowever, it was not really western weapons versus Ja=\r\npanese weapons on \nthe battlefields of the Satsuma rebellion, since both si=\r\ndes used \nguns.  Rather, the Meiji government made much better use of weste=\r\nrn-\nstyle logistics (reinforcements) and communications (the telegraph).  \n=\r\nThe Meiji government was able to get Saigo bogged down in Kumamoto, \nwhile =\r\nthey sent in reinforcements and eventually overwhelmed him at \nTabaru-zaka.=\r\n\n\nJoe\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, jonathan ellgen &lt;jpellgen@...=\r\n&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree there were historical mistakes, but it was a movie an=\r\nd not \nintended to be a documentary or re-enactment. I was actually quite \n=\r\npleased with the film despite its short-comings. I felt that it \ncaptured s=\r\neveral powerful emotions which may have been present at \nthose last moments=\r\n of samurai existence. \n&gt; \n&gt; But some of the things you mentioned really do=\r\nn&#39;t bother me. For \nexample, the suggestion that an outsider would be taken=\r\n in the way \nTom Cruise&#39;s character was... That is obviously part of what m=\r\nakes \nthe story interesting, not particularly anything historical. We know =\r\n\nthat William Adams was taken in, as you alluded too, but that hardly \nwoul=\r\nd make it a common thing. As far as seppuku is concerned, there \nwas really=\r\n no end to what type of bladed instrument a samurai might \nhave used. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n So, while I agree that it isn&#39;t the best source of historical \ninformation=\r\n, I still found it to be acceptable from an entertainment \npoint of view. F=\r\nilm is a much more widely accepted form of media than \nanime, and I am fair=\r\nly confident that more English-speaking people \nwere willing to watch Tom C=\r\nruise than watch Japanimation. Cruise&#39;s \ncharacter was, afterall, a civil w=\r\nar captain... Not necessarily a \nsamurai. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jonathan P. Ellgen\n\n\n\n"
