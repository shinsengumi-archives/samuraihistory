What appeared at the time to set them off was the\narrival of Commodore Perry&#39;s American naval squadron in\n1853. After many attempts by several Western powers to open\nup Japan to trade, Perry finally succeeded in ending\ncenturies of Japan&#39;s self-imposed isolation. His success\ntriggered a crisis of legitimacy. For more than six\ncenturies the chief military leaders of Japan, the shoguns,\nhad ruled the nation. Since 1603 the hereditary shoguns\nwere members of the powerful Tokugawa family, who, while\nthey claimed authority in the name of the emperors in\nKyoto, in fact ran the government as they wanted, from\ntheir capital in Edo (Tokyo). The regime had become\nossified through the years, and its inability to resist the\nWestern incursion exposed its weakness. Eventually a civil\nwar broke out, the feudal shogun system collapsed, and\nimperial rule was restored in 1868. \n\nIn 1852, a year before Perry&#39;s arrival, a new crown prince,\nMutsuhito, was born. No one could have foreseen the\nsignificance this child would assume as a symbol of Japan&#39;s\nmodernization. As Donald Keene, with muted amusement,\nreveals in &#39;&#39;Emperor of Japan,&#39;&#39; Mutsuhito&#39;s upbringing was\nsheltered from the turmoil overtaking his country; it was\ntraditional, steeped in the ancient protocol and customs of\nthe court. Yet by the time he ascended the throne at 15 he\nwas the focus of national aspirations. Traditionally an\nemperor might have several names during his reign and a\ndifferent one after death. This emperor was called Meiji\n(Enlightened Rule) from the beginning, and he, and the\nentire historical era he embodied, have been called Meiji\never since. \n\nIn practical terms the Meiji Restoration of 1868 did not\nbring about direct rule by the emperor. The new government\nwas an oligarchy made up of the senior members of the\nloyalist faction that had overthrown the shogunate. Even\nthough the loyalists gained support for their cause by\npromising to expel all foreigners, pragmatism quickly\ndisplaced impractical idealism. A total makeover of the\ngovernment began promptly, on the model of a modern\nconstitutional monarchy. As his first major act, the Meiji\nemperor promulgated the Charter Oath -- five promises to\nthe people of Japan to bring fundamental change to the\npolitical system. Although the promises were general and\nvague, the Charter Oath became the foundational document\nthat effectively set the government&#39;s course for the rest\nof the Meiji period (1868-1912). \n\nIn those 44 years the Meiji state instituted radical\neconomic, military and legal reforms. With the tacit\nsupport of the emperor, the oligarchy ruthlessly swept\naside old bureaucratic institutions and the feudal class\nstructure. It set up new banking and educational systems,\nbrought the legal code into line with Western standards and\nestablished a constitution in 1889 that created a\nparliamentary form of government. Perhaps most important,\nthe Meiji oligarchy initiated a march to great-power status\nthrough policies that encouraged rapid industrialization at\nhome and colonialist expansion abroad -- expansion that led\nJapan into war with China in 1894 and with Russia a decade\nlater. \n\nThe decision to resist the power and hegemony of the West\nby consciously emulating Western cultural forms lies at the\nheart of all of these changes. Some members of the original\noligarchy, among them Takamori Saigo, once commander of the\nimperial army, disagreed vehemently with this policy, and\nin the early years of the Meiji period the government\nexperienced some resistance, most notably in what is known\nas the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. \n\nOnce the young Meiji state had weathered its early crisis\nof legitimacy, however, it did not limit Japan&#39;s embrace of\nmodernity to the importation of Western institutions and\nmaterial culture. The oligarchy extended its mandate by\nbeginning to build an empire in Asia. This mission demanded\nacquiescence in the racial ideologies that sustained\ncolonial power, and only the construction of a myth of\nJapanese cultural uniqueness made this situation palatable.\nThe result was a strange cultural synthesis, a hybrid of\nWestern modernity and a newly created imperial ideology\nthat promoted the concept of an essential Japanese culture\nrendered timeless by the unbroken succession of the royal\nline. The fundamental legacy of the Meiji period is thus\nthe very idea of a modern Japanese state possessing a\nnationally shared cultural tradition. \n\nGiven the eventful nature of his reign, the lack of\nEnglish-language scholarship on this emperor&#39;s life is\nsurprising. There are many fine books on aspects of the\nhistory and culture of the Meiji period; and in recent\nyears distinguished studies by John Dower and Herbert Bix\nhave explored the workings of the modern imperial system\nthrough an examination of the life of Meiji&#39;s grandson,\nHirohito. The Meiji emperor, however, remains an aloof and\nenigmatic presence whose personal life is largely\ninaccessible even to most modern-day Japanese. \n\nDonald Keene attempts to address this gap in the record --\n&#39;&#39;to find Emperor Meiji,&#39;&#39; as he puts it. Few scholars are\nas well qualified to undertake this tremendous project. He\nbegan his scholarly career in Japanese studies a few years\nafter World War II, and he continues to be one of the\nforemost critics and translators of Japanese culture.\nAlthough he is best known for his extensive writings on\nliterature, he is a cultural historian with an encyclopedic\nknowledge of Japan. His special gifts are on display in\n&#39;&#39;Emperor of Japan,&#39;&#39; which approaches Meiji&#39;s life by\ninterweaving two separate but related narratives. Drawing\non a wide range of sources, including the huge compilation,\n&#39;&#39;Records of the Meiji Emperor&#39;&#39; (Meiji tenno ki), Keene\nconstructs a year-by-year biography of Meiji&#39;s life. A\nsecond narrative outlining the significant events of the\nMeiji period frames the daily details of the emperor&#39;s\npersonal affairs. The result is a biography that serves as\npolitical history. \n\nThe appeal of this work lies in the skill with which these\ntwo narratives are tied together. Although Keene&#39;s\ninterpretation of the period does not depart radically from\nstandard histories, he constantly puts Meiji&#39;s life in a\nrich context, and his account is informed by a literary\nsensibility that lets us see major events in a new light.\nKeene maintains a critical balance between his role as a\nhistorian and his intimate engagement with his subject. His\nbook is a history that revels in detail but remains\naccessible, leading us through the complex intricacies of\ncourt life, political intrigue and international affairs. \n\nIt brings us as close to the inner life of the Meiji\nemperor as we are ever likely to get. Does it succeed in\nhelping us to find Meiji? Yes and no. And the reservation\nhere should remind us of how difficult it is even now for\nus to fit Hirohito into the history of World War II. There\nare personal reasons for what seems to be a mystery about\nthe emperors, but cultural reasons as well. Keene&#39;s book\ngives a fuller picture of the man Meiji, but a sense of\ndistance stubbornly remains. Perhaps this is due to the\nlack of direct commentary on his life by the emperor\nhimself. There is a huge archive in Japan about him, but\nscant documentation that reveals how he regarded even the\nmost crucial events of his time. Keene provides helpful\nspeculations about Meiji&#39;s feelings and opinions at\nimportant moments; but, being a meticulous scholar, he also\ndraws attention to the maddening gaps in the record. \n\nIn the end, he concludes that perhaps Meiji&#39;s greatest\nachievement was the longevity of his reign. But to put the\nstress on that brings the reader back to the problem that\nmotivated this study in the first place. Meiji is\nremembered more as a representative figure of an era than\nas an individual because his personal identity largely\nderives from the symbolic nature of emperorship in Japan.\nFor the better part of the millennium preceding Meiji&#39;s\nreign the primary functions of the emperor were ritual, or\npriestly. By the the middle of the 19th century the\npolitical ground of imperial legitimacy had become\nroutinely symbolic -- a situation in which power flowed\nfrom the charisma of an institution rather than an\nindividual. Meiji remains just beyond the biographer&#39;s\ngrasp because his life was lived at that vanishing point\nwhere the public image of the emperor and the private life\nof the man become indistinguishable. \n\n\n\nDennis Washburn is a professor of Japanese studies at\nDartmouth College. His most recent book is a translation of\nRiichi Yokomitsu&#39;s novel &#39;&#39;Shanghai.&#39;&#39;\n\n\n\n"
