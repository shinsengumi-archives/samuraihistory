I am a life long martial artist. I thank you for =\r\n\nletting me join this group. I only discovered the Samurai in 2003, \nofcour=\r\nse I had heard of them before, but I didnt really know anything \nabout them=\r\n. As corney as it may sound, the film The Last Samurai got \nme intrested, a=\r\nfter that I discovered my calling. I started to read \nany book I could find=\r\n on the Samurai and their code of moral conduct, \nBushido. The more I read,=\r\n the more they fascinated me. How, with a \nfew exceptions, these brave men =\r\n(and sometimes even women to) lived \nby a strict moral code, from the time =\r\nthey woke up in the moring to \nthe time they went to sleep. The trained in =\r\nthe art of the sword, and \nhelp honor above all. I felt alonging to become =\r\nlike this, but \nofcourse I thought the Samurai were gone, just like most wa=\r\nrriors of \nold. But then I discorverd that people were still practicing the=\r\nir \nways, and tring to live as much like a Samurai as one could in this \nda=\r\ny and age. This is a goal in which I would like to strive for. I am \ndoing =\r\nmy best to study the philosophy of Bushido and to learn the Art \nof the Swo=\r\nrd on my own, unfortunatly there are no dojos in columbia \nSouth Carolina t=\r\nhat teach such things. If there is anyone on this \ngroup that could help me=\r\n I would be greatly honored. Thank you.\n\nJacob Ross\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
