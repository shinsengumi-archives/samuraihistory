Gakken, the\npublishers of the rekishi gunzo series, has come out witha new volume that\nis a compliation of old screens depicting several sengoku battles. It has\nfull color fold reproductions as well as closeups. It numbers and identifies\nall the major samurai. Besides Sekigahara it includes Kawanakajima,\nNagashino, Yamazaki, and Shimabara.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: JJ &lt;DarkJJ@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 5:27 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Sekigahara\n\n\n&gt; Konbanwa,\n&gt;\n&gt;     I was wondering if anyone out there knows of any complete guides to\nthe\n&gt; battle of Sekigahara.
