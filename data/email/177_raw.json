He explains the importance of their conclusions not only\n| for historical studies but also for the understanding the demography of\n| contemporary Japan and its foreseeable future.\n|\n| Beginning in 1638, under orders from the central government, town and\n| village officials in Tokugawa Japan collected data annually on their\n| residents. Although the government original purpose was to ferret out\n| adherents to the forbidden religion of Christianity, the information\n| collected in the census books known as SAC (Shumon Aratame Cho) has\nenabled\n| researchers to trace the life histories of individuals and familes for\n| several generations, looking at their migration and employment patterns,\n| family size  and composition, education, and other aspects of community\nand\n| family life.\n|\n| Contents:\n| Chapter 1  Introduction to historical demography: history and population\n| Chapter 2  The establishment and development of historical demography\n| Chapter 3  Population trends based on macro-data\n| Chapter 4  A demographic overview of early modern Japan based on\n| micro-data: population, family reconstitution, and households in Suwa gun,\n| Shinano province\n| Chapter 5  Demographic aspects of Tokugawa Japan based on micro-data:\n| Nishijo mura, Ampachi gun, Mino province\n| Chapter 6  Historical demography and family history: a conclusion\n| Appendix\n| Notes\n| Index\n| ---\n| The author can be reached at\n| ahayami@...\n| ---\n\n\n\n"
