Acquaintences, you could say. \n\nAnswer 3, sans sarcasm: Asking this question is even\nworse than asking &quot;Who&#39;s the best quarterback to have\nplayed in the NFL?&quot; or &quot;Who&#39;s the best NBA player of\nall time?&quot; or even &quot;Who&#39;s the dumbest French soccer\nplayer ever to head butt an Italian and get thrown out\nof the World Cup Final?&quot;\n\nThe answer that 90% of the world will give you is\nMiyamoto Musashi, because that&#39;s who they&#39;ve heard of.\nI would also encourage you to do some research and\nlook up Tsukahara Bokuden and Kamiizumi Nobutsuna (or\nKamiizumi Hidetsuna, as he was also known), who\npreceeded Musashi. The Yagyuu family also developed\nsome quite excellent swordsmen. \n\nWho was best? Well, unlike sports we can&#39;t really\ncompare statistics--there are no passing yards or\npoints per game numbers that we can use. Read up about\nthem and decide for yourself. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
