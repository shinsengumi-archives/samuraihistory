The\ntrouble was that he decided to take Ueda-jo, and\nmissed the battle at Sekigahara altogether.\n\n\n&gt; So he was supposed to pass by, but keep Sanada in\n&gt; check (like a fake pass in football)?\n\nUm, yeah, though not sure I agree with that football\nreference. It wasn&#39;t a misdirection kind of thing--he\ndidn&#39;t fake one way, and go another. It&#39;s more like \nhe was supposed to send the fullback to block the\nlinebacker (Sanada), but sent the whole offensive\nline.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Michael &lt;takayama_hara@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am having trouble with the exact meaning of a\n&gt; &gt; term\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; book &quot;Sekigahara 1600 - The final struggle for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power&quot;.  In the section \n&gt; &gt; &gt; called &quot;Ueda Castle&quot;, on page 43 the sentence\n&gt; &gt; reads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;He was under \n&gt; &gt; &gt; orders to &quot;mask&quot; the loyalist stronghold of Ueda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; castle...&quot;.  I have an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; idea what is meant by bask but could anyone\n&gt; &gt; (author\n&gt; &gt; &gt; included) clarify \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that term for me?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, the Sanada Masayuki is the same as the\n&gt; &gt; Takeda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; general... correct?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Masking&quot; is the same as &quot;guarding&quot; or &quot;covering&quot;\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; modern military doctrinal context--the idea was to\n&gt; &gt; leave a force strong enough to prevent the Sanada\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; leaving Ueda Castle and attacking the the Tokugawa\n&gt; &gt; main bottle in the rear.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
