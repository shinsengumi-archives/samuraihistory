Another route for shinken was from visiting sensei with \na shinken for sale.\n\nI never gave my iaito a name, but if I did it would be &#39;the whistler&#39; \nor something close. When it arrived we had an informal dojo \nunwrapping, admiration of iaito blade and fittings, etc - and then \neveryone had to have a go, at which point it was generally agreed \nit made a most pleasing whistle as it sang through the air.\n\nWe then had a &#39;whistling shiai&#39; which involved everyone trying to \noutwhistle my iaito, which even involved me using sensei&#39;s shinken \nto see if I could outwhistle my iaito - but no joy.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
