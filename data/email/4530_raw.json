Just like Hitler...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think making analogies of this kind can be tricky, different\n&gt;  circumstances. That said, I&#39;d look for a less extreme analogy-For\n&gt;  instance Julius Caesar: Someone who is seen as ambitious and\n&gt;  ruthless, but known as both as a destroyer of an old order(republican\n&gt;  rome) as well as a pioneer of a new order(roman empire). Also, like\n&gt;  Nobunaga, Caesar&#39;s ambitions were fully realized by another not long\n&gt;  after his demise.\n&gt;\n&gt;  C.\n\nThis would be a much better analogy, especially if you think of the way \nthey both died....\nBut more than this, to return at the beginning of the discussion, \nCaesar is generally seen as a great conqueror, and a brave, fearless \nman. (He was probably more cultivated than Nobunaga as well ;o). Thus, \nthe opinions we have in the West about Caesar might somehow \n***resemble*** the ones the Japanese have on Nobunaga.\nOf course, -as you have said- these analogies are always tricky. After \nall, even here the scenario is different, and the temporal difference \nis greater (even thou life and warfare in Nobunaga&#39;s times probably \nresembles more Ceasar&#39;s Rome than Hitler&#39;s Europe...).\n\nAnyway... phew... just mention Nobunaga, and see what happens... :oD\ncepo\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
