I have been discussing the actual existence/use of tetsubo with\n  &gt; some fellow RPG players.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Tetsubo (&quot;iron staff&quot;?) are those big and heavy iron studded staves\n  &gt; often seen in old samurai prints. They seem to have been popular\n  &gt; during the Gempei war and/or Kamakura period. I have also read that\n  &gt; they were used as a kind of psychological weapon, to intimidate the\n  &gt; enemies with a &quot;big fu*king club&quot;. (I seem to remember that nodachi\n  &gt; blades were also used for a similar purpose, in later eras).\n  &gt;\n  &gt; According to another source found on the internet, the tetsubo was\n  &gt; also - and foremost - employed from horseback (which surprised me,\n  &gt; because I would have thought that a such a weapon would be too\n  &gt; cumbersome to be used effectively from the saddle), so the wielder\n  &gt; could add the mount&#39;s momentum to his swing, for a truly devastating\n  &gt; blow.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I still wonder to what extent the tetsubos were actually used on the\n  &gt; battlefield.\n  &gt; Were they a common sight on the battlefield or were they limited\n  &gt; to earlier historic periods and/or specific tactical purposes?\n  &gt; Were there a specific martial style associated with the tetsubo, such\n  &gt; as to allow something like basic parries, counterattacks or &quot;called\n  &gt; shots&quot;, or their use was simple and straightforward (a- lift weapon;\n  &gt; b- lower weapon on enemy&#39;s head; 3- repeat from 1.)? They don&#39;t look\n  &gt; like they could be used like a naginata, a bo staff or anything like\n  &gt; that.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Any info on the subject is appreciated.\n  &gt; Thanks.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; --\n  &gt; C E Z\n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
