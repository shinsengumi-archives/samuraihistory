Some say 1877 in Kysushu,  \nwhen Saigo Takamori and forces loyal to him fought a losing series of  \nskirmishes against the new Imperial army.\n\tOthers would say Hakodate 1869 where the last of the samurai loyal  \nto the Tokugawa house fought against those trying to create a new  \nmodern state, that would spell the end of the samurai as a class.\n\tStill others would say Shimabara 1637 where battlefield tactics of  \nthe Sengoku period were last employed by large samurai armies.\n\tThe purists will say the winter battle of Osaka 1615 or Sekigahara  \n1600 where Tokugawa Ieyasu secured his hold on the nation and sealed  \nthe fate of samurai as warrior, ushering in 250 years of Samurai as  \nadministrator.\n\tThere are indeed monuments and shrines at many of these spots, which  \nyou choose to recognize as the &quot;last battle&quot; will be dependant on  \nwhether it is samurai technology, samurai as a class or samurai as an  \nideal that you are after...\n-t\n\nOn May 27, 2006, at 9:20 AM, brettbronson wrote:\n\n&gt; Can somebody tell me exactly where in Japan was the last known samurai\n&gt; battle and is there a shrine etc. to honour this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Bushidoforever.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Japanese samurais\tJapan airline\tJapan airline flight schedule\n&gt; Japan airline reservation\n&gt;\n&gt; YAHOO!
