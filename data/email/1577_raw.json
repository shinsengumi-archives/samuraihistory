It tells about the attack, how the rider \nwas driven off by Hara Osumi, etc.  But NOWHERE in that passage does \nit mention that the rider was Kenshin!  After the passage, there is a \nsingle line-- It says something to the effect of &#39;later, it was said \nthis was Terutora&#39; (my reading of Kobun is not very advanced, but \nit&#39;s a short sentence that looks something like &#39;Ato Kikeba&#39; the \nwarrior terutora (followed by the Kanji for &#39;mousu&#39; combined with the \nkanji for kou/sourou (10 strokes, ninben).  So it looks to me like \nthe Koyo Gunkan doesn&#39;t even really claim it was Kenshin at all, only \nthat later it was said it was.  I guess some playwrite for some Noh \ndrama about 4th Kawanakajima in the 18th century must have decided it \nwould be nice and epic if he had kenshin and shingen fight it out \nonstage, and that is how it got started that shingen and \nkenshin &#39;definately fought&#39; at that battle....? anyone have any \ninsight?  I know someone mentioned another source that said it was \nthier Kagemusha fighting each other....\n\n\n"
