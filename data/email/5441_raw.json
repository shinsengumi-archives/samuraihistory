A few may go, God help them, \n&gt; &gt;because they liked Tom Cruise&#39;s tired exercise in emotional \n&gt; &gt;manipulation, The Last Samurai. These people do not know what \nthey&#39;re \n&gt; &gt;in for.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;They&#39;ll get their swooshing swords and their copious blood. But \n&gt; &gt;they&#39;ll be scratching their heads at Zatoichi&#39;s sudden bursts of \n&gt; &gt;slapstick humor, or when the entire cast partakes in a thunderous \ntap \n&gt; &gt;dance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Could be that only those folks going to see a film by the awesome \n&gt; &gt;Japanese talent &quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi Kitano will be content with this \nnew \n&gt; &gt;version of the famous Japanese hero. Kitano audaciously takes on \nthe \n&gt; &gt;celluloid persona of the blind, justice-seeking swordsman created \nin \n&gt; &gt;the 1960s and played for decades by Shintaro Katsu.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Zatoichi&#39;s story is taken from the very first Katsu film in the \n&gt; &gt;1960s, about warring factions in a small town. The blind swordsman \n&gt; &gt;(played by Kitano) comes to town as a humble masseur and gambler, \n&gt; &gt;biding his time with the dice-playing nephew of the woman who \ntakes \n&gt; &gt;him in. Soon, he&#39;s in the middle of a gang war.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In Kitano&#39;s samurai universe we&#39;re given wonderfully flawed and \n&gt; &gt;dimensional characters. The film is populated with bums and \n&gt; &gt;prostitutes, guys who hurt themselves because they don&#39;t know how \nto \n&gt; &gt;hold a sword, put-upon working-class folks, and an idiot or two.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Kitano has the odd ability to appeal to both the art-film lover \nand \n&gt; &gt;the action-film fan (though not all of his films are gangster \n&gt; &gt;flicks). He allows bullets to fly and blood to spurt in the midst \nof \n&gt; &gt;silly humor, solid storytelling and stunningly beautiful visuals. \n&gt; &gt;Like blind Zatoichi&#39;s sword sheathed in a rickety old cane, Kitano \n&gt; &gt;shows us the extraordinary hidden within the ordinary. His \nZatoichi \n&gt; &gt;is no ordinary samurai story. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/custom/showtime/sfl-\n&gt; &gt;shzatoiaug20,0,251117.story?coll=sfla-features-showtime\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt;--- \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
