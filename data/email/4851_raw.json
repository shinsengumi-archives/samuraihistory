The other was headed by Honda Masanobu, \n&gt; who wasn&#39;t known as a great warrior (due to an illness he suffered \n&gt; during his youth, I vaguely recall reading that this might have \nbeen \n&gt; polio, but I might be confusing that with Date Masamune), but \n&gt; Masanobu acted in a diplomatic and administrative role for the \n&gt; Tokugawa. He was also known as a political schemer, but was very \n&gt; close to Ieyasu, and later Hidetada. Another fairly vague \n&gt; recollection I have is that the founder of Honda Motor Corp. was \n&gt; descended from this branch of the family.\n\n\n"
