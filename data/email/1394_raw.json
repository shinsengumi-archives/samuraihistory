After working on this off \nand on (mostly off) for the past few weeks, it is starting to look \nlike every major Daimyo had some sort of relation to every other \ndaimyo in the sengoku period. Instead of playing the &#39;Kevin Bacon&#39; \ngame, you could play the &#39;Takeda Shingen&#39; game. (for anyone who \ndoesn&#39;t know what that is, the theory is that every actor in \nexistence can be traced back to Kevin Bacon with 5 or less movies.)\nSo far I have 55 samurai and &#39;Onna&#39;.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;William letham&quot; \n&lt;mickey.letham@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I wish I could help. I&#39;ve looked at all the genealogies that I \nhave, in\n&gt; Rekishi Gunzo, Saigen Nihonshi, Visual  Nihonshi. While they give \nextensive\n&gt; info on children they almost never give any info on who was the \nmother. I\n&gt; have the names of all the sons of Nobunaga but the daughters are \njust listed\n&gt; as &#39;onna&#39;. Even more frustrating is that  even when they do they \noften\n&gt; identify the mother as simply the daughter of some family without \ngiving her\n&gt; personal name.However in issue #20 of the rekishi gunzo series \nthere is a\n&gt; discussion of Nobunaga and Nohime (Saitos daughter). It says there \nare\n&gt; different and conflicting records as to the matrilineal of some of \nnobunagas\n&gt; children. It does say that Nobutata and Nobuo were the sons of &#39;a \ndaughter\n&gt; of the Ikoma&#39;. Interesting to note Nohime&#39;s mother was the daughter \nof\n&gt; Akechi Mitsustugu (not sure of the pronunciation) who was Akechi \nMitsuhides\n&gt; grandfather.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it helps I have this info about Nobunagas children;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fuyuhime married Gamo Ujisato\n&gt; Gotoku m. Matsudaira nobuyasu\n&gt; Hidekastu adopted by Hideyoshi\n&gt; Kastunaga adopted by Takeda Shingen\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; married Takigawa Kazumasa\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; m. Tsutsui Sadatsugu\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; m. Maeda Toshinaga (Taiga drama had her as Nobunagas 4th \ndaughter and\n&gt; by the name of Eihime)\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; m. Niwa Nagashige\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; m. Hideyoshi\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; Mizuno Tadatane\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; m. Sanjo Akizane\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; m. Madenokouji Mitsufusa\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; m. Tokudaiji Sanefuyu\n&gt; &#39;onna&#39; m. Takeda Kastuyori\n&gt; \n&gt; as for Takeda I have 7 boys and five girls\n&gt; \n&gt; Yoshinobu (this is the only one i am sure was born from Sanjo)\n&gt; Nobuchika (who became the priest Ryobo)\n&gt; Noboyuki\n&gt; Kastuyuri\n&gt; Morinobu (?)\n&gt; Nobuzane\n&gt; Nobukiyo\n&gt; The girls names I have as their nuns name\n&gt; Obouin m. Hojo Ujimasa\n&gt; Kenboin (?) m. Anayama Umeyuki (?)\n&gt; Mayuhime (?) m. Kiso Yoshiaki (?)\n&gt; Ahime (?) m. Uesugi Kagekastu\n&gt; Matsuhime m. Oda Nobutada\n&gt; \n&gt; The ? indicate where I am not sur of the pronunciation. I don&#39;t \nhave to tell\n&gt; you that when I state &#39;married&#39; it doesn&#39;t nescesarily mean &#39;wife&#39; \nIts just\n&gt; for convenience\n\n\n"
