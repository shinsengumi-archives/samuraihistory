Oda Nobunaga undert=\r\nook no such actions. He eradicated threats, admittedly ruthlessly and with =\r\nlittle consideration for the status of those he deemed to be threats. Of co=\r\nurse women and children were casualties, which is never right, but simply t=\r\nhe way it was, and still is. \nHe held little regard for Buddhism, shown by =\r\nhis allegedly debaucherous formative years and lack of respect shown at his=\r\n father&#39;s funeral, but he was no Christian hoping to destroy Buddhism, but =\r\nonly to destroy those who stood in his way. This may have lead to large los=\r\ns of life but this wasn&#39;t genocide, and it struck terror into his opponents=\r\n but was not what we now call terrorism. \nThe meas suited the objective, an=\r\n objective that is hard to sum up in much of the language we are so used to=\r\n today.\nM.Lorimer \n\nCesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\nOn Apr 6=\r\n, 2004, at 6:29 PM, Me=F0al Mikit St=F3r-ljon Oddhinsson wrote:\n\n&gt; Are you =\r\nkidding, Mr Alexander?\n&gt;\n&gt;  The one who did a real admirable work on this s=\r\nubject was Takeda \n&gt; Shingen!\n&gt;  One of the most admirable persons in the J=\r\napan History!
