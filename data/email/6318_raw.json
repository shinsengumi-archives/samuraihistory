And I don&#39;t believe &quot;Hidden\nFortress&quot; is on that list as yet...\nIf we weren&#39;t talking fiction, I&#39;d add Musashi&#39;s own _Book of Five Rings (or\nSpheres)_, the Tengu-Geijutsu-Ron of Chozan Shissai (Shissai Chozan?) and\nthe Heiho Kaden Sho of the Yagyu, Soho&#39;s _The Unfettered Mind_... but it was\nfiction you specified, Thomas, so I won&#39;t.  For your purposes, however,\nDavid, some of those might be of considerable interest.\nAnd Thomas, as well as Kitsuno, thanks again for that &quot;...Last Sword...&quot;\nrecommendation.  I&#39;m very much looking forward to that.  Sounds splendid.\n\tGereg\n\n\nDate: Tue, 14 Dec 2004 05:54:40 -0800 (PST)\n   From: David Sigler &lt;fiat_dux_das@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Films, books, etc.\n\n\nA RESPONSE; the only &#39;real&#39; books on the subject I have are the following,\n&quot;Bushido&quot; by Inazo, &quot;Hagakure;The Book of the Samurai,&quot; by Yamamoto\nTsunetomo. I don&#39;t think my &quot;Zen&quot; books count but I have a few of them as\nwell. As for the tc movie, I liked the scenery, some of the history was\naccurate, the final battle scene was very well done even if tc survived. I\nlove Japanese history and love their literature. I was just hoping for a\nbetter movie that showed Japan and it&#39;s history; its a fascinating country\nand people; lived on Okinawa, Japan for two years.\n\ndavid a sigler\n\nThomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; wrote:\n\nI suggest a file with a list of films and comments from members of the list,\nas well as a list\nof samurai fiction - available in English.\n\nFurthermore I volunteer to keep such a document if that suits everyone.\n\npost suggestions here, or email me.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
