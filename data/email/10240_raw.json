In a=\r\n book I was recently reading, &quot;Young Japan: Yokohama and Yedo&quot; by John R. B=\r\nlack, the author writes about witnessing an execution sometime in the 1860`=\r\ns in the Tobe area of Yokohama. Also a journalist in Japan in 1880 wrote a =\r\nstory about the execution ground. You can see the story here: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://=\r\nquery.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=3DFB0B10FA3F551A7493C0A81782D85F448=\r\n784F9 \n&gt; \n&gt; I have been living in Yokohama for 4 years and was quite surpri=\r\nsed to hear about this bleak part of Yokohama`s past. I figure there must b=\r\ne some kind of memorial, shrine or, at least a sign marking the site - but,=\r\n thus far, no luck at all in finding it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
