I am still working out just how much of the \nbook is supposed to be &#39;fantasy&#39; and how much is supposed to be &#39;real \nand accurate&#39;, so this is TREMENDOUSLY helpful.\n\nI am heading to San Francisco for a week and when I come back will \nprobably have a clearer picture. As I said, I&#39;m only 10,000 words in, \nso now&#39;s the time to do all the work, LOL.\n\nThank you all for your kind help- I will no doubt be bothering you \nwith more questions when I come back. You can relax, though- I won&#39;t \npost any more of the book. (You&#39;ll be spared that much, at least.)\n\nThanks to all, and especially Nate,\n\nLili\n\n\n\n"
