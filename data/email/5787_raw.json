Such maps hopefully show \nmajor (and minor) settlements, fortresses and castles, rivers and \nother prominent topography. The map(s) provided with the game system \nare in my view, while helpful as a start, rather lacking in detail. \nI&#39;ve found some maps along the lines of what I&#39;m looking for in some \nof the Osprey books (i.e. Sekigahara, Kawanakajima, Nagashino, etc.), \nbut I was really hoping to find yet more detail over a larger area if \npossible. I&#39;m even open to primary sources in the original Japanese \nif anyone knows of such books by name. Thanks,\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n"
