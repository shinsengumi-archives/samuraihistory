Who knew?\n&gt; \n&gt; The other range from, well, SAMURAI-ARCHIVES.COM (I\n&gt; was really tempted to post THAT for you, he he) to\n&gt; some pages claiming Hojo Soun was a model samurai and\n&gt; a textbook practitioner of Bushido (this from the same\n&gt; site that COMPLETELY butchers the Chushingura\n&gt; story--did you know the 47 ronin killed the Shogun?\n&gt; It&#39;s true--I saw it on the web). One excerpt I found\n&gt; follows:\n\nGood, but it fails to say anything other than &quot;he took Izu&quot;  :P\nThanks for the hand, though.
