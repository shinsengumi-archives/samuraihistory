Thank you Scott. I&#39;m starting to get=\r\n curious about references. I think I read somewhere that a majority of the =\r\ndaimyo art (or just Japanese) was from 17th or 18th century artists.\n \nWhat=\r\n about those with shorter hair?\n \nAlso, hairstyles of youths?\n \nWhat was th=\r\ne hairstyle before late 16th century/Edo peroid?\n \nWas it illegal to have m=\r\nen wear their hair long? \n \n\n\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nFrom: scot=\r\ntc_4@...\nDate: Sun, 22 Aug 2010 12:24:58 +0000\nSubject: [samuraihis=\r\ntory] Re: Samurai Hairstyles\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFrom what I know the shaving of the to=\r\np of the head was not a real set in cultural norm for samurai until the Edo=\r\n Period. There were some before, and it was starting to become popular in t=\r\nhe late 16th century, however it was not the &quot;set&quot; hairstyle until later. T=\r\nhere were a number of ways in which to fashion the top knot. From descripti=\r\nons the most popular in the pre-Edo period was the &quot;tea whisk&quot; which was na=\r\nmed that because that is what it looked like. I have a picture of a portrai=\r\nt that a friend sent me of Oda Nobunaga. It was done by an Italian Jesuit w=\r\nho was commissioned by Nobunaga to do a realistic picture of him, which was=\r\n something that Japanese art was lacking. While we of course cannot say for=\r\n sure that it is 100% accurate, it is safe to say, since it was done under =\r\nNobunaga&#39;s orders and probably his approval, that it is more than likely th=\r\ne closest that we will have of an accurate picture of him. The portrait sho=\r\nws him with his typical mustache, and even though he is wearing a top knot,=\r\n the top of his head is not shaved. \n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;konohawolfie&quot; &lt;Greywolf456@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Sam Archives!\n&gt; \n&gt; This wa=\r\ns something I meant to ask a long long time ago, but I luckily came across =\r\na sticky note that made me remember. What I&#39;m trying to figure out is the d=\r\nistinctive hairstyles of samurai.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apparently, I read that samurai shav=\r\ne their hair in a &quot;half moon style&quot; when they reach a particular age or ran=\r\nk? This is also very noticed in Feudal Japan art.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this the only hai=\r\nrstyle or are there others? I am also especially curious in youths hair (li=\r\nke teen samurai).\n&gt; Also, why decide on shaving their head?\n&gt; \n&gt; If they ha=\r\nve very short hair, can they keep it?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n \t\t \t   \t\t  \n\n[Non-text portions=\r\n of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
