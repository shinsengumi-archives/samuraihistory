Now, the Rokkaku, I \nunderstand, being the daimyo in southern Omi.  Would the Asai not have been too far \nwest?  And the Saito all but out of the way completely?  Or was it just that they \nwere other power-broking clans that would have to have been dealt with?  Or \nwould the Asai have been trouble for them by virtue of being a Nobunaga ally?\n       And as far as the Ikko Ikki needing to be dealt with, it wasn&#39;t a \nchoice of cooperation.  Either you wipe them out or they wipe YOU out.  So in that \nrespect, I agree with what Nobunaga did.\n       Just my own thoughts.  :-)  Take care.\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
