Many swordsmiths\nincorporate Fujiwara, as well as Minamoto and occasionaly Taira into their\nsignatures when signing swords even in modern times. For instance I have a\nsword signed Minamoto Yoshimune dated 1941 but Yoshimune&#39;s actual family\nname was Takahashi. There seems no connection with the original families of\nthese prestigious names.\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Haynes, A (Angus)&quot; &lt;angus.haynes@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, April 29, 2005 1:53 AM\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Minamoto & Taira\n\n\n&gt; *Nate&#39;s excellent reply snipped*\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for that great response! I had wondered why there were so many\n&gt; Minamoto and Taira in the history books, and it was a Wikipedia article\n&gt; on &#39;Minamoto&#39; that I was looking at earlier that stated that the name\n&gt; was honorary... proving once again to take all Wikipedia articles with a\n&gt; grain of salt...\n&gt;\n&gt; _____________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; This email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged,\nand is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
