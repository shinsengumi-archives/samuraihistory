I take &#39;blade down&#39; to mean that the cutting edge is facing the ground, \nand is basically parallel to the ground.  if you draw with your right hand, it \nresults in a fairly natural grip. If on the other hand, the sword is &#39;blade up&#39;, \nthat would mean to me that the cutting edge is &#39;up&#39; and therefore facing the sky.  \nif that was the case, drawing with your right hand would force you to turn your \nwrist up so that your fist is perpendicular to the ground, and your knuckles \nare &#39;up&#39; facing the sky.  I think that would be very hard to draw that way, and to \ndo a cut off the draw like that would mean that you are slashing out in a circular \nmotion up-out-down, which would seem to me difficult to control due to the \nposition your wrist is in and the fact that the sword would be almost slingshotted \nout of the sheath, whereas drawing the sword blade down (as I&#39;ve described an \npictured it) results is an easily controlled and aimable strike.  Would someone \nlike to describe the mechanics of katana-drawing for me?  The way I was taught was \npurely blade down.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Anthony J.

Try it.\n\nBlade UP makes for a more immediate draw & slice. \n\nThe tachi is worn edge down because that&#39;s the way they *always* have\nbeen worn, since the fifth century, before cavalry was an issue.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
