I shook the Saya out as much as possible but the blade is a whole different story. I don&#39;t want to try to clean it untill i know what i&#39;m doing. It came with a cleaning kit but i don&#39;t know what is for what. anyone who has any knowledge on basic sword cleaning kits and would like to give me a short explanation of how it all works please do so.\n                                       thanks a bundle,\n                                         mark\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n Yahoo!
