I am curious about that time period in Japanese history but for lear=\r\nning the actual history, I pick up a book.  As for learning Martial Arts, I=\r\n study Aikido at the Aikido of Virginia Beach Dojo www.aikido-of-virginia-b=\r\neach.com and my sensei is very outstanding in his weapons training.  During=\r\n the one sceen where they were training in the field, I noticed a few famil=\r\nar bokken suburi techniques I have learned in the dojo.  It is very importa=\r\nnt not to rely on movies to learn.  They are for entertainment only and the=\r\nre is two reasons I can think of for not using movies for research regardin=\r\ng Martial Arts, one is you will look like an fool and two, you can do yours=\r\nelf and others serious injury by showing off your &quot;moves&quot; you learned from =\r\nthe Karate Kid.\n   \n  Phil in Norfolk\n\n&quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n          I studied kendo for ten years (until my health took me out). =\r\nI&#39;m not sure that watching films is the best place to learn sword skills or=\r\n any other martial arts skills. Do you practice in a school with a sensei? =\r\nIf so, you can ask your sensei about &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; and whatever sword =\r\ntactics might be included within. If you don&#39;t practice in a school with a =\r\nsensei, I would try and find a well-reputed school and sign up. This is a m=\r\nuch better place to learn sword techniques rather than try and pick them up=\r\n from films -- which after all are choreographed. \n\nNina aka Wave Tossed\n\n_=\r\n_______________________________\n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mail=\r\nto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Phillip Michael\nSent: Tuesd=\r\nay, April 17, 2007 11:49 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re:=\r\n [samuraihistory] Re: Fwd: History vs The Last Samurai?\n\n\n\nWell said.
