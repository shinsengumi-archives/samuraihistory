Can anyone advise me as to the pro&#39;s, con&#39;s and quality of \nthese yari? Are they worth considering or are they better avoided?\n\nHere&#39;s the US source:\nhttp://www.casiberia.com/product_details.asp?id=SH2312\n\nIn the past nothing I&#39;ve seen from these folks has peaked my interest, \nuntil now. I confess that due to design and quality issues I&#39;ve not \nlooked at their stuff for years, but I&#39;d be happy to be pleasantly \nsurprised.\n\nPrice wise I&#39;ve seen these Yari on sale via UK websites from 230 - 450 \nGB pounds. So, does anyone know of a good UK supplier, just in case?\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n-- \nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
