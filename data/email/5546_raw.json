One of the things I&#39;ve only recently learnt is that whilst the sword is \nlethally (and almost mythically) strong in the cut, it is prey to lateral pressures and can \noften bend in the clash of blade on blade.\n\nSo when you see Hollywood swordplay with blades hitting each other almost at right \nangles, it&#39;s unlikely the owner would ever be able to get the sword back in the saya.\n\nIf you ever get a chance to see &#39;Gohatto&#39; there are three fencing session with bokken \nat the very start. If you listen to the sound of bokken on bokken, the main character&#39;s \nswordplay is a lot more subtle, the angle of deflection is a lot less (more acute) and \nthe &#39;clash&#39; sound is noticably softer - his sword would survive the encounter whereas \nthe others might bend their blades.\n\nIn kenjutsu the technique is to &#39;catch and deflect&#39; - to slide the incoming blade along \nyour own, rather than clash and stop it.\n\nLastly, if you look at the poster for the film &#39;Blade&#39; the hero is employing a classic \ndeflection for an overhead blow, however as his left shoulder is visible beyond his \nblade, the deflected blow would have taken his arm off!\n\nHopefully the blade experts online will add or correct my assumptions.\n\nThomas\n \n\n-- \n\nWhatever you Wanadoo:\nhttp://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/\n\nThis email has been checked for most known viruses - find out more at: http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm\n\n"
