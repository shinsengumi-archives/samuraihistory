Swords are classified into catego=\r\nries by the length of \nits blade if i&#39;m correct, for example a katana is a =\r\nkatana due to its \nblade being over two SHAKU. But what about the style and=\r\n shape of the \nblade, can a Katana be a Torii Sori style with a Unokubi =96=\r\n zukuri \nshape.  Also could you help my with this: \n&quot;Koa Isshin Mantetsu wi=\r\nth Buke Zukuri Koshirae&quot; \nI think the Buke Zukuri Koshirae is some sort of =\r\nmounting style. And \nI guess the Koa Isshin Mantetsu is the shape of the bl=\r\nade maybe? Any \nhelp would be great.\n\n\n\n\n"
