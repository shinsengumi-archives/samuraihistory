This has been well documented \nand is withou=\r\nt argument. Rather my change of subject conversation was \nhow modern Japan =\r\nhas developed, no, rather profitted from 200 years of \nTokugawa control. I =\r\nbeleive the beauty that is Japan would not be so if \nwere not for the 200 y=\r\nears of isolation mandated by the Tokugawas. \nStarting with Ueyesu the Toku=\r\ngawas ruled unlike any other leaders. Of \ncourse those who enjoy the battle=\r\n will say life was better under \nHideyoshi or even Noubanaga. That exciting=\r\n timeframe was not the topic \nin the least. My thoughts were directed more =\r\nto the enforcement of non \nmilitaristic training for all Tokugawa senior wa=\r\nrriors such as the \narts, his mircomanagement of all aspects of daily life =\r\nfrom the only \napproved design and measurement of building houses to how a =\r\nbucket of \nrice was to be sold and on to even what could and could not be s=\r\npoken \nof in public. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
