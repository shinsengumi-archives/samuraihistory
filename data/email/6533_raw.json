A low-ranking office worker in a late-19th-century Japanese \nvillage, the widowed Seibei spends his spare time caring for his \nbeloved young daughters and elderly mother. Potential romance enters \nthe picture when recently divorced former childhood friend Tomoe \n(Rie Miyazawa) seeks to reconnect with Seibei. The only problem is \nTomoe&#39;s abusive, hard-drinking ex, a high-ranking samurai who&#39;s \ndetermined to challenge Seibei to a duel.\n\nWhile his film concludes with an intense action sequence, director \nYamada lavishes far greater attention on the rhythms of daily life \nduring a period of dramatic sociopolitical upheaval. Star Sanada, \nwho followed &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot; with a prominent supporting role \nin the Tom Cruise epic &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; gives a particularly \nwrenching, textured performance as the decent family man torn \nbetween his personal wishes and professional obligations. \nInteresting interviews with actor Sanada and director Yamada \ncomprise the disc&#39;s only extras, but the film supplies sufficient \nrewards in its own right to justify its purchase price. \n\n\n\n\n"
