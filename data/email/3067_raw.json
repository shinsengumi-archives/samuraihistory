Nah, I&#39;m here, I&#39;m broke,I&#39;m in the shop, I&#39;m to busy to \n&gt; do anything but armour. Same old, same old. I go back tomorrow and greatly \n&gt; look forward to it although I hate being away from my family.\n\nYeah, I can understand that. If I had a family someplace I&#39;d miss &#39;em in japan. \nAs it was, I only had my friends in Japan and no family &quot;back home.&quot; (I had a \nlot of friends in my neighborhood bar who kept threatening to &quot;fix me up&quot; with a \ndaughter or a niece. I don&#39;t know if I should have taken one of &#39;em up on it. &lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt;   BTW, you might consider changing your pattern for a nodowa. What you have \n&gt; on the website is great as a visual for what the finished product should \n&gt; look like. As a pattern, with the way metal moves (even hot worked) it \n&gt; doesn&#39;t work. It closes up too much in the back. I was going to make one for \n&gt; Evil-Merlin but that pattern closes up so much my 5 year-old can&#39;t get it \n&gt; on. I&#39;ve made another pattern but run out of time to make another. (sigh)\n\nOops, you&#39;re right. That pattern is off. Sigh. I&#39;ll try to fix it as soon as I \ncan. Sigh....\n\n&gt;   Well anyway, good luck on the job hunt. Talk to you later.\n\nCiao!!!\n\nTony\n\n\n"
