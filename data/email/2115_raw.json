Many samurais, especially those of lower ranks, began to \n&gt; &gt; doubt the power of the Shogunate in defending the country against \n&gt; &gt; foreign powers, especially when they had seen the armed \n&gt; blackships. \n&gt; &gt; The slogan &quot;Sonno-Joi&quot; (Rever the emperor, dispel the barbarians) \n&gt; &gt; was winning more and more support, such that samurais desert their \n&gt; &gt; hans to come to Kyoto to join the revolutionary movements. (In \n&gt; those \n&gt; &gt; days deserting your han can be one of the most condemned sins - \n&gt; once \n&gt; &gt; you desert, you can never return to it, on pain of death.) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Such roshis (masterless samurais, but not ronins and definitely \n&gt; not \n&gt; &gt; rurounis) increased in Kyoto, causing more and more disturbances \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; the capital. In those early days of unsatisfied feelings, most of \n&gt; &gt; the roshis still did not have a clear idea of what movement or who \n&gt; &gt; they should follow. All they knew was that they were impatient and \n&gt; &gt; eager to do something to defend Japan. There were myriads of \n&gt; schools \n&gt; &gt; of thought - Sonno-joi, open up the country to learn from the \n&gt; gaijin \n&gt; &gt; and in turn attact them using the same technologies, support the \n&gt; &gt; Bakufu - as Watsuki once remarked, it was an era where 100 people \n&gt; &gt; may hold 100 different arguments and you can&#39;t say who&#39;s wrong. \n&gt; It&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; one factor which makes this era as tumultuous and interesting as \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; is. The Bakufu decided that it would be to their advantage if they \n&gt; &gt; took such roshis without any stand yet into their service, rather \n&gt; &gt; than letting them roam about the capital. Hence, Roshi-tais (bands \n&gt; &gt; of wave samurais) were formed and roshis enlisted under respective \n&gt; &gt; Bakufu samurais, where the &quot;entry requirements&quot; were one&#39;s sword \n&gt; &gt; skills (kenjutsu matches, something like an exam, were held.) This \n&gt; &gt; happened in 1863 or 3rd Year of Bunkyuu, one year after Kaoru&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; birth. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *note direct from a website\n\n\n"
