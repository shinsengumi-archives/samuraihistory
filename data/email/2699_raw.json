If you&#39;d like, I can try and\nsend them to you personally.\n\nAlso, in the book &quot;samurai warfare&quot; there&#39;s a good\ndeal of paintings and plates of large Japanese armies\neither going into or in the midsts of battle.  The\nbook as well as several others also tell how battles\nwere generally fought, usually with the highest\nranking general (shokun, daimyo, whatever word you\nwant to use) watching from a nearby hill or some other\nplace to get a good overview of the field.  Each\ndaimyo, and possibly highly celebrated warriors of\nlesser rank, had a standard bearer to show where his\nforce was on the field, and the head general from high\natop his hill would send specifically chosen runners\n(I forget what book it was but I did read a great deal\non the importance, training and ability of these\nchosen message carriers) to relay messages/orders\nbetween himself and each standard worthy leader. \nBelow that I think each leader was pretty much\nresponsible for his own type of organization amongst\nhis troops.\n\nWearing sashimono was obviously one way of keeping\norder and telling who was who on the battlefield, and\nthe previously mentioned standards also helped.  I\nbeleive I read that one of the reasons that there&#39;s\nnot much written on Japanese mass warfare is that the\nJapanese never had any great literary generals like\nthe west did.  Generals were too busy warring most of\nthe time so most of the accounts we have of battles\nbefore the end of Sengoku Jidai are accounts written\nby people not in the military.  And this is not even\ntaking into the account the possible number of lost\nrecords during such an unsteady time as the Sengoku\nperiod.\n\nI beleive Japanese warfare was very highly regulated\nmuch like their wastern counterparts, I think it&#39;s\nnearly impossible for a country with a history of so\nmuch war to have gotten by just sort of &quot;winging it&quot;,\nand reading of genius minds like Hideyoshi Toyotomi, a\nman who once had the perspective to use the seasonal\nmonsoons of Japanese to submerge a castle he was\nbeseiging, I just can&#39;t see the Japanese being so\ninept at mass warfare as nearly everyone insists that\nthey are.\n\nI am a full blooded american with nothing but\nanglo-saxon roots, but it offends me to hear Japanese\nwarfare spoken of in such a negative fashion these\ndays.  It used to be left at &quot;the Japanese were more\nspecialized and better at personal combat whereas the\nEuropeans were better at keeping order and mass\ncombat&quot;, but even that is being challenged these days\nby people who insist in the superiorty of European\nfencing, unarmed combat and actually have the gull to\ncompare the european sword to the katana.\n\nI could rant on, but I&#39;ll do that some other time.\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
