Hmm  \n\nGet a chance torent it, have been seeing it at most Major Movie rental \nstores.  I have a copy on VHS  which I will be transfering to DVD.\n\nI have not seen Hiri kiri; will have to check this one out.   \n\nBlesing to all and Thanks for all the post I find them infomative and \nintersting.  Although I was a little concern when I spoke with my daughter she told \nme that she is afraid to post on here.  She  feels that there are some in here \nthat wold treat her as if she were hmm interesting that she feels that way.  I \nam saddden by this news..  But I have seen some post on here that I can \nunderstand why she would feel that way.  She wants to ask question but feels like \nif she ask then people will be kinda like ;  How can you not know this?    I \nhoep that we can all be resepectful and a little more humble about how we Make \nare psot to help others that are interested in Samuria History.
