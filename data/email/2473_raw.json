The 4th Battle of\nKawanakajima, usually the one considered THE battle,\ntook place in 1561. Great battle to study, with lots\nof tactical point-counterpoint, at one point allegedly\nUesugi Kenshin led a charge into the Takeda\nheadquarters and swung at Shingen, who parried with\nhis war-fan (whether this happened or not, it&#39;s been\nthe subject of much artwork). \n\ngo to the Samurai Archives website, I know a better\ndescription is in there. As to &quot;medieval&quot; versus\n&quot;pre-modern&quot;, do you mean &quot;chusei&quot; versus &quot;kinsei&quot;?\nI&#39;m not familiar with the use of medieval and\npre-modern with the exception of in translation of\nthose two terms. Kawanakajima wasn&#39;t a watershed\nbattle like Nagashino or Sekigahara, just a really\ngood one to study from a military history standpoint. \n\nNate\n\n--- burker1@... wrote:\n&gt; That&#39;s what I&#39;ve always thought.  But then again,\n&gt; I&#39;ve never heard of \n&gt; Kawanakajima before.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 11/16/03 1:48:26 AM,\n&gt; cepo@... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think the watershed between medieval and\n&gt; pre-modern warfare was \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagashino (1575), because of the systematic use of\n&gt; firearms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cepo\n&gt; \n&gt; Honolulu &gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
