My current question is basically=A0&quot;How successf=\r\nul was Oda Nobunaga at reunifying Japan&quot;.\n=A0\nNow the obvious answer and pr=\r\nossibly the right one is &quot;very successful only &quot;failed&quot; because Nobunaga wa=\r\ns overenthusiastic and Akechi made his famous cheap shot at power. However,=\r\n this essay needs to be coached in terms historiographical arguement and co=\r\nmplaining. That just leaves me with just=A0Berry in english with her whole =\r\nHideyoshi-coaltion/Federalism arguement.\n=A0\nI would like to know if anyone=\r\n can link me to other arguments that Nobunaga was not so sucessful or that =\r\nhis success lacked the depth=A0or structures=A0needed to forge a long-lasti=\r\nng reunification settlement of the kind the Tokugawa achieved; even if he h=\r\nad lived longer. I&#39;ve been looking at the usual suspects Berry, Lamers, Cam=\r\nbridge History, etc. Recommendations or opinions of historians outside the =\r\nEnglish corpus of literature would be most appreciated.\n=A0\nPS: are any of =\r\nthe samurai archives forum admins out there, erm...your site is not=A0sendi=\r\nng me the confirmation email so I can post there. Please help!\n-----------b=\r\nye bye------\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n\n\n"
