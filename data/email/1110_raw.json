Am I correct that it was the Shimabara rebellion? If not,\n&gt; please help me find the right event.\n&gt;\n&gt; I need specific names and dates and locations. Any info or links or\n&gt; book recommendations would be great.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; Doug C.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
