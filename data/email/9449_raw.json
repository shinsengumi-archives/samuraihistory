And the lines that are in the beginning o=\r\nr a little on the hokey side.  Although the art work is very good.  I am no=\r\nt sure about the monster thing.

She also has a screen name for th=\r\nis forum; but I have never scene her post on here.  Could be a first.   Kee=\r\np at it.  I am certainly not saying that you do not have potential and the =\r\nart work as I said before is very good.   I am thinking that there may be a=\r\n market for a Historical Japanese comic book.  Sure would save alot of post=\r\n on here LOL.   What a novel idea someone actually doing history.  \n \n  Be =\r\nwell and many blessing   Seikei\n \n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: bandit=\r\nt_adams@...\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Fri, 16 Mar 2007=\r\n 3:08 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] doing something fun...\n\n\nALERT!
