A japanese demon or demon spirt. Hmmmm I know that in some myths that a kitune was like a japanese sumbumss. Sorry for the misspelling. Kitune is a fox spirt. In japanese culture their was good kitunes and their was bad ones. The bad ones would turn into women with fox features and lure men to their deaths.\n\nRod Pavez &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n\nHi there:\nI really hate to be a pain but I have to ask one last question \nregarding the subject of vampires in Japan. I was informed by some \nof you that the one form of vampire is the ghost woman who sucks the \nblood of children during the night. \n\nI remember hearing or reading I think about female vampires who \nstalked lords and dranktheir blood. The only guise they had was cat  \nand when in it you could tell them apart from an ordinary cat by the \ntwo tails they had instead of just one.\n\nDoes anybody know about this? I&#39;ve looked and looked around but \nhaven&#39;t found this information again. Help.\n\nThanks,\nRod\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
