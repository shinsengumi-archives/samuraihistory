The character was \ncreated based, supposedly, off of three different swordsmen during the \nbakumatsu.\n  As Ms. Frison said Battoujutsu and Iaidou are connected.  Allow me to \nexplain in greater detail.  Battoujutsu means this: &quot;sword drawing \ntechinque.&quot;  Therefore all Iaidou schools contain battoujutsu since that is \nwhat separates Iaidou from Kenjutsu.  However, once the second hand is \nplaced on the tsuka (handle of the sword) the focus then becomes kenjutsu.  \nIaidou schools are a combative mixture of battoujutsu and kenjutsu usually \ndealing with the element of surprise, either on the side of the attacker or \ndefender since no one would go into battle with their katana sheathed.\n  The other main difference is more philosophical.  A Dou school focuses as \nmuch on the mental and spiritual development and the physical development, \nwhich is why it uses Dou - &quot;the way.&quot;  A Jutsu school, for the most part, \nfocuses primarily on the physical, the technique, thusly Jutsu - \n&quot;technique.&quot;\n  I hope this was helpful.  Do not hesitate to ask any questions.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nOptimize your Internet experience to the max with the new MSN Premium \nInternet Software. http://click.atdmt.com/AVE/go/onm00200359ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n"
