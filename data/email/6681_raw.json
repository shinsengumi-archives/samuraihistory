It has the old style string binding, and the \npaper \n&gt; is very thin, but remarkably strong for such thin paper.  It \n*feels* \n&gt; old...\n&gt; \n&gt; Would anyone here who can read Japanese be willing to let me mail \n&gt; them some color photocopies of some of the relevant pages of this \n&gt; thing and see if they can date it?  I don&#39;t have access to a \nscanner, \n&gt; or I would do it that way....\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Trace\n\nHow about a digital camera, or many camera stores could probably \nconvert a copy into a digital image for you. You could post it to \nthe &#39;files&#39; section of this group - and then i&#39;m sure someone could \ntell you what it is.\n\n\n\n\n"
