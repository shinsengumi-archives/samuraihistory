Do you have a list of good books for some one who \n&gt; whant&#39;s to research Samurai armies and warfare? \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m also curious to know if the Portuguese ever employed christian \n&gt; Samurai mercenaries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Nuno\n\n   There were Japanese overseas in the sixteenth century, and I did \nsee references to Japanese in Macao (or maybe Goa) when I was writing \nmy masters thesis, but I didn&#39;t keep the reference (I was looking at \nJapanese trade and piracy at the time). \n   The shortish answer -- there were Japanese warriors overseas during \nthe sixteenth and early seventeenth century, who gradually died off or \nintermarried with the locals after the Tokugawa Shogunate enacted \ntheir Ban on overseas travel. They were active in the Phillipines and \nsiam for sure, often as mercenaries. Whether they were Christian I&#39;d \nhave to re-research, but some of them WERE Christians who left when \nChristianity was forbidden by the Tokugawa. My favorite Christian \ndaimyo, Konishi Yukinaga (one of the 3 lead generals in Hideyoshi&#39;s \ninvasion of Korea) picked the wrong side at the battle of Sekigahara \nin 1600 (he fought against the Tokugawa) and was killed.\n   I can look through my notes if you want more details.\n\nAlex Hazlett\n(I was a Japanese History student, now I&#39;m studying Nautical \nArchaeology -- currently researching Portuguese shipping in the \nsisxteenth century - I&#39;m researching how the Naos that went to Japan \nwere built)\n\n\n\n"
