Consequently I talked like a woman would and most of the guys I worked with in Japan thought I was gay.    Nothing like being pulled away by your boss and being told that the company doesnï¿½t like to employ perverts.\n&gt;\nItai!\n\nMy second teacher was a little old lady type. One student brought in a \npirated copy of the then just released in Japan &#39;Akira&#39;. She ran it for \nabout 5 minutes, mostly because I think she was shocked silly. I didn&#39;t \nunderstand a single bit! It did inspire several lectures on polite \nspeech and men&#39;s and women&#39;s language.\n\nWhen in doubt... mumble ;)\n\nJim Eckman\n\n"
