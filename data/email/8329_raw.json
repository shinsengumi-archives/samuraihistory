The series seems to \nreflect this, it was hard for me to empathize with the main characters. \nOn top of that, I don&#39;t think the acting was that good. I hope the VCDs \nwere cheap.\n\nDepending on what period of Japanese history you like, I might recommend \neither the more recent Yoshitsune, or the older one about Hideyoshi.\n\n&gt; From: &quot;Michael Peters&quot; &lt;shdwstel@...&gt; Totok, While NHK&#39;s saigo \n&gt; dramas\n&gt;\nTaiga?\n\n&gt; are well known for accuracy, Shinsengumi was a departure from their \n&gt; usual high standards.\n&gt;\nI agree, it was terrible.\n\nEven the best of the Taiga drams will take liberties with history if it \nmakes a better story or add details that are not documented. So enjoy \nthem as entertainment and not as history.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
