See I&#39;m an ABC (Australian Born Chinese). Thing \nis, I know more about Japanese history then I do my own. I know very \nlittle about Chinese history and what I do know about Australian \nhistory is what I have learnt from school. To me Australian history \nis very hmm how would you say? &quot;Mind-numbing&quot;, we only have around \ntwo hundred years of history so it isn&#39;t as impressive as other \ncultures. I do have an interest in Chinese history, however is not a \npriority for me at the moment. One day, sometime in the near future I \ndo plan on correcting this. So I guess what I&#39;m asking is, are there \nothers that know more about a specific culture then they do their own.\n\nZev\n\n\n\n\n"
