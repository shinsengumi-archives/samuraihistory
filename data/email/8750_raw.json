All japanese swords are called &quot;To&quot;, so\njapanese swords are called &quot;NihonTo&quot;, the tipical\nsword as people know it; is called &quot;Katana&quot;.\n   The evolution of &quot;To&quot; is marked by eras or periods.\n   So you have Muromachi swords or Shinto swords or\nShishinto swords, etc.\n   Since I am a Iaido student, I really like discusing\nthis matters, but right now I should be working.
