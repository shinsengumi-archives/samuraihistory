You are better off with either: a matchlock, a \nb=\r\now, a naginata, or a yari as your primary weapon. Also, free-for-alls \nare =\r\nnot something that classical and medieval strategists were \nparticularly fo=\r\nnd of. Free-for-all approaches came about largely after \nthe development of=\r\n modern firearms when tacticians realized that they \ndid not have to mass t=\r\nroops in order to mass strength. If you look at \nbattle paintings from Japa=\r\nn you will notice that unless a route is in \nprogress that you generally se=\r\ne troops on both sides drawn up in some \nsort of skirmish line or other. In=\r\ncidentally, battle paintings from the \nSengogku period pretty clearly show =\r\nmassed formations using similar \nweapons. Think the battle scenes in Kagemu=\r\nsha except in 400 year old \npaintings. \n\n[Non-text portions of this message=\r\n have been removed]\n\n\n"
