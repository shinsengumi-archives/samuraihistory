I saw it in September. If you have not seen it try and \ncatch it. It&#39;s really terrific on the interaction between East and West \n1500-1800. Lots on Japan, and very enlightening.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; If Ieyasu can have a sword called &#39;oil seller&#39; then I am not sure we\n&gt; should discount the humble mackerel as a source (or is that sauce) \n&gt; of inspiration?\n&gt; \n&gt; I can see a possible correspondence between the markings on the \nfish\n&gt; and the pattern of the temper of the blade? We have &#39;mackerel cloud&#39; \n&gt; and the like. Or parhaps the decoration of the saya? \n&gt; \n&gt; Is not koiguchi - &#39;carp&#39;s mouth&#39;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully off to the exhibition of blades at the British Museum in\n&gt; the next day or so - if I find one there I&#39;ll let you know!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
