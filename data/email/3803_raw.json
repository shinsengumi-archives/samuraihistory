In a town in Andalucia called Coria del  \nRio where the Keicho mission arrived, many people bear the surname  \n&quot;Japon&quot; from the Spanish word for Japan. They claim that they are the  \ndescendants of samurai. Their children have a clear Mongolian spot  \n(MOKOHAN) which no Spanish children have. In a park in the town, there  \nis a statue of Hasekura in haori, hakama, with two swords.\n\nlinks (the first one is in Spanish, but has a photograph of the statue):\nhttp://www.coriadelrio.com/coriadelrio/historia/apellidojapon.html\nhttp://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20031211b4.htm\nhttp://academy2.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/history/1069209016/\nhttp://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/esp/tpl/mag3/art20030201/htm/ \nitw_samurai.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
