Some of them were &quot;legal country samurai&quot;... but some of =\r\nthem had, in the weird workings of Toyotomi, lost their &quot;legal status&quot; as s=\r\namurai..\n=C2=A0However, in the backwoods... &quot;legal status&quot; means very littl=\r\ne. They maintained their samurai lifestyle, married farmer&#39;s daughters if t=\r\nhey wanted, and continue to train and amass weapons. Large areas of land al=\r\nso belonged to them. In a way, these domains made excellent hide-outs for c=\r\nertain groups. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Kinda like how the ro=\r\nnin rules led to all the drama at Kyoto in the early 1620s, these samurai s=\r\ntatus and &quot;you can&#39;t do this&quot; decrees passed by Toyotomi actually created a=\r\n blackmarket of samurai activity, as it were.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Bec=\r\nause of the family ties between Ji-samurai who legally had status and Ji-Sa=\r\nmurai who had lost their status....

I am very impressed with the knowledge of samurai and feudal histor=\r\ny in the Archives, so I have a few questions pertaining to Ji-samurai, the =\r\nIkki (the rebellions?) and Sousen.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think Wikipedia provides en=\r\nough detail and I may be confused with the samurai society in particular. I=\r\n am too familiar with the popular samurai that go to the capital, and it se=\r\nems that samurai are both the rulers of the provinces and the soldiers unde=\r\nrneath the rulers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why/how were there lower-ranked rural samurai [Zi-s=\r\namurai] ? And Ikki are like those who rebel against the Capital forces and =\r\nlive in rural villages (I think called Sousen?)? \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I find it a li=\r\nttle hard to believe that few people became samurai and I read about large =\r\narmies ;) What was samurai life like? What did they do in an average day?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Thank you\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this=\r\n message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been=\r\n removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n\n\n"
