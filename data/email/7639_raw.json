Henry H. Hong, who spent 15 years \nworking on the book, hopes his book will call Westerners&#39; attention \nto Korea and challenge them to rethink their views on the matter. \n\nThe author, both a Christian minister and a professor, has a \nreputation for promoting cross-cultural understanding and friendship \nbetween Korean-Americans and African-Americans while he lived in the \nUnited States. \n\nThe novel is based on a true story of Ahn Yong-bok, a Korean \nfisherman in the 17th century, who controlled Ulleung Island in the \nEast Sea and drove out all Japanese fishermen and pirates from the \narea. The author depicts vividly the loyalty and love of characters \nsuch as Ahn and Okio who later becomes the wife of the seventh \nshogun of Japan. One day, Yong-bok&#39;s love, Yooyoo, is kidnapped by \nJapanese pirates. To save her, Yongbok sails to Japan and sneaks \ninto Edo. However, due to a trivial incident, he is accused of two \ncrimes and thrown in jail. However, Okio, whom he had previously \nrescued from her hardships, helps Yongbok and falls in love with \nhim. Through her, he manages to see Tsunayoshi, the fifth shogun of \nJapan&#39;s Tokugawa feudal government. In front of the shogun, Yong-bok \nasserts that the Ulleung Island and the nearby Dokdo have belonged \nto Joseon since the Shilla Kingdom period and finally succeeds in \npersuading the shogun to admit that the two islands are part of \nJoseon. \n\nHong plans to have his novel translated into several other \nlanguages. The Korean edition is scheduled to be released in \nSeptember, followed by Japanese and Chinese versions. \n\n(davidpooh@...) \n\n\nBy Jin Dae-woong \n\n\n2005.08.31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
