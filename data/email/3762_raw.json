It&#39;s a huge blunder, if\nya ask me. Makes no sense, specially when in a scene from the movie\nthey showed the importance that samurai place on their hair style when\nKatsumoto&#39;s son&#39;s hair was cut down by the soldiers to disgrace and\nhumiliate him. Yet his father&#39;s head&#39;s completely shaved!\n\nMiburo\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Saitoh Hajime &lt;the_sam_99@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi, I haven&#39;t checked this group in a while so I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know if this\n&gt; &gt; question has been address or not. It&#39;s about the\n&gt; &gt; movie The Last\n&gt; &gt; Samurai, the lead samurai Katsumoto&#39;s head&#39;s shaven.\n&gt; &gt; I though that\n&gt; &gt; this was a sign of disgrace among samurai, or that\n&gt; &gt; they had\n&gt; &gt; relinquished to a priest&#39;s life...why did he have\n&gt; &gt; his head shaved?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Miburo\n&gt; \n&gt; That bothered me too (and I notice these things,\n&gt; having no hair and all that). It usually was shaved if\n&gt; the person took religious vows. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
