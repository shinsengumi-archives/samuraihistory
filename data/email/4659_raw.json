To become \na Samurai you must have the right bloodline, is this correct? Also \nhow old would a boy be before he turned Samurai. And how old would he \nhave to be before his first battle or was it, when he proved himself \nready.    \n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
