Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc: \n&gt; \n&gt; Josh Wilson wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, the tachi can be used in fights.. it was\n&gt; originally developed as a\n&gt; &gt; cavalry sword.. the longer blade and more\n&gt; pronounced curve were designed to\n&gt; &gt; be used form horseback.. much like the western\n&gt; examples of a saber in\n&gt; &gt; comparisson to the rapier.. the tachi was worn\n&gt; blade down whereas the katana\n&gt; &gt; was worn blade up.. the difference was that when\n&gt; you drew the tachi from\n&gt; &gt; horseback, the first draw would be a slice.. and\n&gt; the katana&#39;s first draw\n&gt; &gt; would be a slice as well, if worn blade down.. as\n&gt; far as dates, it seems that\n&gt; &gt; the tachi may be a predeccessor to the katana, but\n&gt; I am NOT sure..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s much more to it that this.\n&gt; \n&gt; The old court swords were tachi. For a long time,\n&gt; &quot;tachi&quot; seems to have been the \n&gt; generic word for sword. It wasn&#39;t until much later\n&gt; (probably no earlier than the \n&gt; 15th C.) that the samaurai began to wear upside-down\n&gt; swords thrust through their \n&gt; sashes like they occasionally did with shorter\n&gt; weapons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
