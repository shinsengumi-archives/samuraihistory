During his long feud with Uesugi \nKenshin,  Shingen had developed his clan&#39;s cavalry,  which benefited from \nliving adjacent to fine horse-breeding grounds,  into perhaps the best Asiatic \ncavalry force seen since the Mongols of Genghiz Khan.  Also,  Shingen realized \nthe military revolution that was wrought by the introduction of firearms by the \nPortuguese in 1543 at Tanegashima.  However,  this was a lesson fatally \nignored by Takeda Katsuyori at Nagashino in 1575.  There, he attacked the firearms \ncorps,  the Teppu Shu,  of Oda Nobunaga and his ally  Tokugawa Ieyasu, who were \nwaiting behind prepared positions.  The Takeda cavalry was smashed forever.  \nIn 1582,  Katsuyori committed  seppuku rather than be captured by Nobunaga and \nIeyasu.
