I&#39;m in the process of building a 62 metre jin-maku\n(a &quot;camp curtain&quot; for those not in the know). It&#39;s in six parts (4x13m\nand 2x5m)and we&#39;ve gone for the more authentic structure, that is each\ncurtain is made of five narrow horizontal strips of linen fabric with\nmatching loops for its 6mm hemp suspension rope. Top and bottom panels\nare dark blue, the middle three are sky blue, as will be the loops.\nBlack painted kamon, to be applied later.\n\nNow, the question is in regard to the poles. On your site, you say that\nthe authentic material for these would be iron/steel rather than wood.\nFair enough, the pictures I&#39;ve been looking at would support that, as\nthey are quite thin and have a hook about a shaku from the top finial,\nwhich seems to be a sphere or the like in shape. How thick do you reckon\nthese poles are? Half inch maybe? They can&#39;t be too thick as this would\nmake them very heavy to transport. Any ideas? \n\nWhat concerns me is that at around seven and a half feet above the deck,\nplus I guess one and a half to two and a half in the deck, there is some\nrisk of bending? I don&#39;t yet know if I can get such a long length of\nmetal hardened and tempered to resist this, but I&#39;m still looking in to\nit, assuming that it is necessary.\n\nOf course there is the issue of just how many we need to get made, I was\nworking on one pole every 5 metres or so.\n\nAny input, or other suggestions on their design etc. would also be much\nappreciated.\n\nIf anyone else has a view, feel free to dive in, ninja not\nwithstanding:-)\n\nBTW Kitsuno-dono, the &quot;Ultimate Power&quot; link is a true killer LOL\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
