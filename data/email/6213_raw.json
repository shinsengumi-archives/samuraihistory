Anyway, although his reign was bloody \n&gt; (not really as bloody as the westerners think), we cherish his memory \n&gt; because he was able to deal with the many corrupted nobles and common \n&gt; thieves of the time (on a more lay approach, of course). Nice \n&gt; metaphor, Mr. Bryant :) I think you already are aware of the fact \n&gt; that Vlad Tepes remained orthodox and built some monasteries and \n&gt; churches, and the exagerations of his cruelty were dued to the \n&gt; benedictine and capucin monk orders, which refused to obey the \n&gt; country rules and fled to german lands, where they spred legends of \n&gt; horror. It seems that a monk named Jacob is the author of the \n&gt; manuscript found in 1462 in the Saint Galin monastery in Switzerland, \n&gt; which was the first of the many that formed the &quot;Anti-Dracula&quot; \n&gt; campaign, with major impact on ther german world.\n\nAllow me to offer you this URL to the Fred Saberhagen &quot;Dracula&quot; series: \nhttp://www.berserker.com/FredsDracula.html\n\nThe book &quot;Dracula Tape&quot; is detailed on one of the links on that page.\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
