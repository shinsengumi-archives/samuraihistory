I checked the listings\nfor both Denmark and the United States in Conway&#39;s and found no listings for\nher what so ever. This is one of the great things that interest me so in\nnautical/naval history and in the samurai for that matter. I love when the\nplot thickens. This has tweaked my interest and I will keep you posted as to\nwhat I am able to uncover. Give me a few days as I have tons of material to\ngo through but I hope to turn up further information that will allow us to\nnail this baby down.\n\nCheers\nBill\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: M.

It is\na rather interesting first hand account.  I also have a dozen or so pictures\nand etchings on my computer of the ship.  It is a particular favorite of\nmine since it ties in two of my most favorite parts of history, the US War\nBetween the States and Tokugawa/Bakumatsu Japan.\n  Thank you again for the wonderful information.  I shall have to get my\nhands on a copy of the books you mentioned.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIs your PC infected?
