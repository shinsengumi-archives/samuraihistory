During the warring\nstates period (&quot;Sengoku Jidai&quot;), japanese politics (understood as the\nrelationship between the social entities) could be traced back to constant\narmed conflict. I seem to have lost track of the source, but I remember\ncoming across a statement claiming that &quot;during the Sengoku era, specially\nunder Oda Nobunaga?s blossoming period, the internal diplomatic relations in\nJapan almost ceased to be, as the driving force for change were war&quot;.\n\nIn short, war was a way of life, a basis for assigning meaning to reality.\nAs such, the concepts of &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;loyalty&quot; were deeply woven amongst\nthe fabric of war. Perhaps before today?s standarts, &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;loyalty&quot;\nhave different meanings from what they used to have on those days. Even the\nwarlords and warmongers were subject to suffering the effects of defeat on\nsuch era.\n\nAlso, lack of honour which can be ascribed to a warlord or warmonger does\nnot entail lack of honour which can be ascribed to soldiers,\nbrothers-in-arms bound by something far greater than the conflict itself. I\nbeesech Shakespeare knowledge to make this point: &quot;Those who shed their\nblood with me today, on this field, shall be my brother - we, a band of\nbrothers&quot;.\n\nI hope this adds in a positive way to this discussion.\n\nCheers,\n\nThiago\n\n-----Mensagem original-----\nDe: Nate Ledbetter [mailto:ltdomer98@...]\nEnviada em: terca-feira, 23 de marco de 2004 20:50\nPara: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nAssunto: Re: [samuraihistory] loyalty and honour\n\n\n\nThanks, Tony.\n\nThere is no honor in wanting to start a war. There&#39;s\nplenty of honor shown by many of those who fight it.\nNot every soldier is honorable, just like not every\nsamurai was honorable. But usually it&#39;s not the\nsoldiers who want to go fight the war. Anyone who\ndoesn&#39;t believe that, I&#39;ll take a poll of my friends\nand colleagues, and get back to you--I&#39;ll ask how many\nof them in Iraq and Afghanistan right now are enjoying\nthemselves, how many wanted to go and be separated\nfrom their families, etc. I doubt I&#39;ll get many\npositive responses.\n\nNate Ledbetter\nCPT, US Army\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
