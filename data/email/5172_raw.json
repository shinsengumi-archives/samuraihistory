And as far as MI\ngoes, I resemble that remark!\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Reading &#39;between the lines&#39;, did not the run-up to\n&gt; Nagashino \n&gt; involve a plot to betray the Tokugawa from within?\n&gt; Presumably \n&gt; Takeda &#39;ninja&#39; were working the subversion\n&gt; operation, and \n&gt; Tokugawa &#39;ninja&#39; were working counter-insurgency? Or\n&gt; am I \n&gt; being over-romantic?\n\nThere may have been intel/counterintell involved (GOD\nI would love to find data on that...drool) but\nessentially it wasn&#39;t a &quot;ninja&quot;, but a well placed\nTokugawa administrator who had agreed to set a fire\nand open the gates to the Takeda army. \n\n&gt; Such being the case, the Tokugawa managed to\n&gt; manouvre the \n&gt; Takeda into overplaying their hand, as it were,\n&gt; which might be \n&gt; counted as a highly successful ninja operation,\n&gt; based on sound \n&gt; intelligence rather than assassinations,\n&gt; wall-climbings, etc.\n\nNot really. The Takeda executed a tactical withdrawal,\nonce they saw they couldn&#39;t take Okazaki like they had\nhoped. Katsuyori simply didn&#39;t want to leave empty\nhanded, so they attacked Yoshida-jo first, then\nNagashino. At Yoshida-jo, it was too well defended for\na quick siege, and Katsuyori was afraid of the\nreinforcements coming up from Nobunaga. Nagashino,\nhowever, was too good to pass up, with the personal\nhistory between the Takeda and the keeper of the\ncastle for the Tokugawa. Katsuyori could have simply\nretreated back into Kai--he wasn&#39;t &quot;maneuvered&quot; into\nfighting at Nagashino by Ieyasu, per se. \n\n&gt; Again, as Paul pointed out an age ago (hi Paul)\n&gt; there&#39;s a scene \n&gt; in Kagemusha where 3 peasants (in the employ of the\n&gt; Oda and \n&gt; the Tokugawa) are watching &#39;Shingen&#39; review his\n&gt; troops and are \n&gt; convinced it is he, which is the report that goes\n&gt; back to HQ.\n\n2 peasants and a monk, actually. THESE are true\n&quot;shinobi no mono&quot; or &quot;kusa&quot;. I&#39;d LOVE to do research\non the intell techniques of the sengoku, but man,\nwould I have to dig for resources...maybe this new\nRekishi Gunzo K is talking about...\n\n&gt; No doubt Hollywood would have them attempt to\n&gt; assassinate \n&gt; Shingen with blow darts, exploding geisha, or\n&gt; something of that \n&gt; ilk.\n\nExploding Geisha? I&#39;d pay Y1500 for that ticket!\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo! Mail - Send 10MB messages!\nhttp://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail \n\n"
