Obstreperous peasants were compelled to wear straw raincoats w/c were then set alight.  Others were hauled off to Mt.Unzen and then tossed into the sulfur springs to be scalded to death.\n&gt;\n&gt;The rebellion had a strong religious flavor to it because of a \n&gt;charismatic Christian youth,\n&gt;Amakusa Shiro, who became its de facto leader.   The rebels inflicted a \n&gt;series\n&gt;of ignominious defeats on the besieging samurai armies and so alarmed \n&gt;the Shogunate that\n&gt;help was requested from the Dutch, who obliged by attacking the rebels \n&gt;from the sea\n&gt;with naval cannon.\n\nSo the Dutch War of Independence, that lasted for 80 years b/w the Spain and the Low Countries, the latter aided and abetted by England, was being played out in Kyushu, where the Calvinist Protestants hurled shot after shot at the Shimabara rebels who were most likely papists under the influence of the Iberian Jesuits and Dominicans.  The shogunate played off the Protestants against the Catholics in this episode.\n&gt;\n&gt;Matsudaira Nobutsuna, the commander sent by the Shogunate to end\n&gt;the uprising, opted for a lengthy siege, only concluding with a final \n&gt;assault when\n&gt;the rebels supplies had been exhausted and starvation had set in.\n&gt;\n&gt;There is a good description of the Shimabara rebellion in Ivan Morris&#39; book\n&gt;&quot;The Nobility of Failure&quot; in the chapter entitled, &quot;Amakusa Shiro - \n&gt;Japanese Messiah.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;gabriel d gabaya wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does anybody here have indepth knowledge about the Shimabara rebellion \n&gt;&gt; of 1637-38?  All I know is that Japanese Christians got fed up w/ the \n&gt;&gt; local tax collectors.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Gabs\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; _______________________________________\n&gt;&gt; EDSAMAIL.
