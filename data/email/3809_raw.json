MAJOR Spoilers in here. If ya intend to watch Ep \n25(final one) of Gasaraki DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!! OK Gasaraki is the name \nof an ancient race of aliens who came to this planet millions of years ago, \nmonkeyed around with life and discovered the secrets of eternity! Problem is \nuntil someone discovered what they already knew they could not pass on to \nthe next level! The third son of the GOWAs discovered and wanted to exploit \nthis secret. Problem was Papa was against it. So he had to go. No 3 shoots \nhim as he is using the youngest GOWA the daughter as a Kai to awaken \nGasaraki. Then a lot of junk about the end of civilization a la &quot;Dr \nStrangelove&#39;s&quot; final scenes. Then Yugi rescues his sister and Miharu but No. \n3 is taken! Want more? Watch it.

We just froze the screen there.\n&gt; &gt; Ga=desire/sa=people/ra=net/ki=spirit. Spoiler if we tell you the full\n&gt; &gt; meaning of who or what gasaraki is. Gomen.
