Apparently Kenshin not only killed the soldier but\ncut his matchlock barrel so well that the sword was named as such.  I recall the\nsword was an O-Kanehira??  So a gun barrel has been cut in at least one\ndocumented historical event.  If the gun was an &quot;udon-ju&quot; this is more easily\naccepted than a WW2 machine gun barrel...\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: David Heller &lt;olasnah@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 14, 2004 2:36 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Slicing rifle barrels\n\n\nI actually grabbed a screenshot of the movie at that precise moment, and the\nbreakage of the rifle does in fact occur behind the action of the rifle, so no\nbarrel was sliced.\n\nJames Eckman &lt;ronin_engineer@...&gt; wrote:I think this is the equivalent\nof an urban legend more than anything\nelse, looks cool in movies but may never have happened.
