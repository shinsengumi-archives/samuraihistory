And the new power defeated the other one to establish New Government , Meiji Government.\n   \n  By the way ,  do you know who did open Japan&#39;s door which used be closed against foreign countries ?\n   \n    Since then,  Japan really were forced to be changed, to be revoluted to face with barbarians through The pacific Ocean&#39;s war.\n   \n    Japan got  the tiny bud   of destiny to fight against them later at that time.\n   \n    Your comment on the above will be highly appreciated.\n   \n    Eddie\n  \n\n&quot;Haynes, A (Angus)&quot; &lt;angus.haynes@...&gt; wrote:\n        \n\n  &gt;The movie The Last Samurai... is it a real part of history or not?\n\nThe movie itself is, yes. It was released in 2003 and as such, is now part of our history.\n\nThe events in the movie? No. Some of the characters and events are VERY LOOSELY based on real history, but 99% of it is Holywood fantasy. Read the book &#39;The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori&#39; by Mark Ravina for the real history behind the character Katsumoto was based on.\n\n-AngusH\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
