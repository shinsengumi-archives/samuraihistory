There never were any plans to\n&gt; cover it in silver, much to the contrary of what\n&gt; guidebooks and Mr. Turnbull will tell you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n\nI agree. The ginkaku-ji wasn&#39;t meant to be covered in silver. The \nname merely alludes to the Kinkaku-ji, that might explain the \nmisconception. Keene writes in his book about the personality of \nYoshimasa and the way it probably differed from Yoshimitsu&#39;s. The \nlatter wanted a building, the kinkaku-ji, that would perpetuate his \nlegacy through the centuries to come. Yoshimasa on the other hand, \nabove all, wanted a building that reflected his personal taste. He \nplanned it thoroughly and had special rocks and plants removed from \ntemples and palace gardens in order to enhance the beauty of his \ngardens at Higashiyama. He had certain features and even whole \nbuildings deconstructed and reconstructed because he didn&#39;t like it.\nThere is only one known account, according to Keene (sounds like a \nbroken record :), that Yoshimasa expressed sadness and wonder about \nthe poverty of the commoners or the famines that plagued Japan \nduring his reign. In any case, it didn&#39;t stop him from building very \nexpensive palaces (if I remember correctly the Hana no gosho and \nothers) or organising Sakura (cherry tree) viewings. Above all, \nGinkaku-ji was his retreat to where he retired from his position as \nshogun and only returned to politics (not as shogun but acting as \none) when his son the ninth Ashikaga shogun, Yoshihisa, died and he \nhad no heir. Yoshimasa was very much into &#39;karamono&#39; (Chinese things \nand objects of art). In my humble opinion this probably was a reason \nthat he didn&#39;t mind being a vassal of or paying tribute to the \nChinese emperor. The other reason was (again my opinion) that he \nrevered his grandfather Yoshimitsu and his father Yoshinori, who \nboth were &#39;King of Japan&#39; and vassals of the Middle Kingdom. \n\nMaybe off-topic;\n\nA curious event happened in 1863 when: &quot;Hatred of Yoshimitsu was \nespecially strong during the years immediately before the Meiji \nrestoration of 1868, which had as one of it&#39;s professed goals the \nreturn of secular authority to the emperor. In the second month of \nthe third year of Bunkyu (1863), nine men, followers of the Shinto \nzealot Hirata Atsutane, broke into the Toji-in [a temple in Kyoto] \nand removed the heads of the statues of the first three Ashikaga \nshoguns: Takauji, Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu. They then exposed the \nheads on a bank of the Kamo river, following the common practice at \nthis time of &#39;patriots&#39; exposing for all to see the heads of men \naccused of being traitors. Beside the heads of the three shogun, \nplacards were set up enumerating the crimes of each. Yoshimitsu&#39;s \nacceptance of the title of King of Japan made him the worst traitor \nof all.&quot; \n\nNow i&#39;m tired\n\nNahless\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Make Yahoo! your home page \n&gt; http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
