I would kill for a chance \nto go back and rewrite huge swaths of my first book or two.\n&gt; \n&gt; And, yes, he speaks Japanese. You&#39;ve never seen his history of the \n&quot;kakure kirishitan.&quot; Don&#39;t forget, he does have a Ph.D.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of \nInabayama took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in \nJapanese, including a few he lists in his bibliography state it \nhappened in 1567.  So you may be thinking, &#39;what&#39;s two or three \nyears?&#39;  Well, what if I told you the battle of Gettysburg took place \nin 1866?  Oops!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The difference is, there was one war around from 1861 to 1865. There \nwas pretty much constant warfare during the 1560s, so any date would \nbe plausable. Of course, that is odd, since my sources all say 1567, \ntoo... &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You could write a treatise on just the errors and uncited Papinot \nsources alone.  Not to mention a picture listed as an &#39;authors \nrepresentation&#39; of something that actually looks suspiciously like a \ntracing of a picture in a Rekishi gunzo book. (Dont have his book or \nthe Gunzo book on hand right now to cite which one)\n&gt; &gt; Guess because he&#39;s the only game in town he thinks he doesn&#39;t have \nto work at it anymore...?  I&#39;ve seen him mentioned as Stephen &quot;buy my \nbooks&quot; Turnbull in some post before, and I can see why.  Just take a \nlook at his website.  You can&#39;t help but get the impression \nscholarship takes a definate backseat to profit.  guess I can&#39;t really \nblame the guy, though.  Gotta put food on the table somehow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Heck, I&#39;m envious. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;d rather read &#39;dry&#39; histories if they are more accurate \nthan &#39;popular&#39; histories, although I&#39;d prefer to read an accurate \npopular history! (like A.J. Bryant&#39;s stuff!  At least you get the \nimpression that he has a real interest in the subject, and can \nactually read japanese, and actually puts in the research!)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; LOL! Thanks, but I&#39;m just this guy. &lt;g&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n"
