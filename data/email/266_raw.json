There are\nrecords with the word shinobi and someother word which\nI can not remember right now.  Shinobi is the word\nused for ninja sometimes.  But keep in mind the\nshinobi talked about in records is not part of some\nsecret clan but could be nothing more than a warrior\nor chugun (peasant style worker that cleans and works\nwith horses) sent in to an enemy camp to steal\nsomething or cause a disturbance.  \n\nMusashi\n--- Tom�s Aira &lt;tomasaira@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; there are also woodblocks prints(is it ukyo-e?)\n&gt; showing armoured and\n&gt; unarmoured samurai training and fighting in styles\n&gt; known now as martial\n&gt; arts.\n&gt; \n&gt; although you (fred) are not the first I hear on that\n&gt; matter. a few years\n&gt; ago I heard from my kendo sensei that there were not\n&gt; a single record of\n&gt; the word ninja nor their activity, even in tales or\n&gt; whatsoever,\n&gt; regarding the ninja.\n&gt; \n&gt; if this proves to be false (I have not found the\n&gt; evidences on the\n&gt; contrary up to now), considering some serious\n&gt; publication or original\n&gt; art, let me know, I am eager to believe in something\n&gt; :-o\n&gt; \n&gt; and please, excuse my poor english,\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom�s\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; escribi�:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; fredjnsn@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Indirectly on topic, but a question/comment\n&gt; nonetheless. . . In all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my years of reading and studying Japanese\n&gt; Samurai history, I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NEVER come accross anything even remotely\n&gt; resembling &#39;a group of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samurai practicing karate together in a dojo&#39;\n&gt; (quote is my own).  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have never seen any references to unarmed combat\n&gt; training, and don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see much use for it anyway.  The samurai studied\n&gt; weapons, which is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; common sense, of course.  I don&#39;t believe (and\n&gt; this is opinion) that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even &#39;powerful samurai families&#39; employed\n&gt; &#39;martial artists&#39; to teach\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them unarmed combat.  from my limited (6 years\n&gt; of martial arts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; training about 10 years ago or so - and my\n&gt; studying of martial arts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; history) is that unarmed combat originated in\n&gt; Okinawa, and at best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 200 - 300 years ago.  I&#39;m sure that judo or\n&gt; jujitsu-like &#39;wrestling&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably existed, but I doubt that Takeda\n&gt; Shingen or Oda Nobunaga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hired martial arts experts to train there armies\n&gt; in the way of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unarmed combat.  I would hazzard to guess based\n&gt; on what I&#39;ve read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and thus on what I &#39;haven&#39;t&#39; come accross) that\n&gt; mass training for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the armies wasn&#39;t too common - even weapons\n&gt; training.  most ashigaru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably went out and cut themselves a bamboo\n&gt; spear and just charged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into battle hoping for the best.  I would assume\n&gt; that any martial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; training with weapons was done on one&#39;s own, and\n&gt; not through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or\n&gt; closest to the lord,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who would receive sword training.  Anyway, my\n&gt; point is that I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts\n&gt; training in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the &#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books.  At best\n&gt; the subject comes\n&gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the VERY questionable &#39;martial arts history\n&gt; books&#39;.  If someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has info on martial arts training from a\n&gt; &#39;reputable source&#39; PLEASE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; respond to this post.  I am curious about this\n&gt; simply because it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not something covered by Hall, Varley, Sansom,\n&gt; Berry, or the others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You&#39;d be surprised. There is an old martial art\n&gt; (the name of which\n&gt; &gt; escapes\n&gt; &gt; me for the moment) which is, essentially,\n&gt; &quot;wrestling in armour.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a very practical thing to learn to do, if\n&gt; you&#39;re an armoured\n&gt; &gt; warrior\n&gt; &gt; who periodically has to fight in close quarters.\n&gt; You learn how to grab\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; secure people wearing armour (where to grab, etc.)\n&gt; and how to avoid\n&gt; &gt; being\n&gt; &gt; grabbed while in armour.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tony\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives:\n&gt; http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
