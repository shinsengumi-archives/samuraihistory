There was a \nstanding reward out in the 70&#39;s if anybody could prove that a Hoolywood \nstyle Western shootout ever occured. I don&#39;t know if it was ever payed \nout. Same type of nonesense. A rifle barrel is much thicker than any \nconceivable armor that could be warn plus it often has a nice hardwood \nstock to go along with it. What crazy bushi would risk his sword on that \nas opposed to chopping something more sensible? If somebody videotapes a \nbarrel being chopped by a katana, then maybe I will believe. Considering \nthe number of times I&#39;ve heard this silliness from people, you&#39;d figure \nthe WWII museums or books would have at least one or two rifles that had \nbeen chopped in half!\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
