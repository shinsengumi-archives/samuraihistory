Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll tell you this: they were fighting a war with a very \n&gt; &gt;different concept of values than these days. Can you imagine Rommel and Patton \n&gt; &gt;having gotten together for such a confab? &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; No. Nor can I imagine Lee and Grant doing the same!\n&gt; \n&gt; In the West from time to time, there has been efforts to limit the \n&gt; damage to civilians and each other. In most of Asia this is a foreign \n&gt; concept for the most part even today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
