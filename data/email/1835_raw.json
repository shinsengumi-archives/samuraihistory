And se exactlu witch king you are refering to.\nWe hav=\r\ne many Kings named Gustav in our history.\n\nHowever, the Swedish history cla=\r\nsss are very biased. I live in southern\nparts of Sweden, called Sk=E5ne or =\r\nScania in latin. We used to belong to\nDenmark a few undred years bak, then =\r\nsweden waged war against denmark\nand took scania. We vere swedish for a few=\r\n years and then danish and\nthen swedish. Untill around 1640 i think, whne w=\r\ne became permanetely\nswedish. I happen to live in a town called Kristiansta=\r\nd. an old military\ncity founded by King Kristian II (the second). In denmar=\r\nk and Scania, He\nis refered to as &quot;Kristian den gode&quot; (Kristian the good) f=\r\nor the\nliberation of skane from sweden. In sweden they call him &quot;Kristian\nT=\r\nyrann&quot; (Kristian the oppressor/tyrant).\nSo I was taught that he was a mean =\r\nevil man, in grammar school and in\nintermediat school, but in junior high I=\r\n got a teacher who studied\nscania history in the university, and he told me=\r\n the opposit version of\nwhat I had ben taught before. Thats when i realised=\r\n that the winners\nwrite history. USA and Russia fought the Nazis and won er=\r\ngo they fought\nfor freedom. It is really just a matter of ponit of view. Ne=\r\nver trust\nhistory to tellyou what really happend.\n\nI stand corrected again.=\r\n I really ought to go mideval on my old history\nteacher, he told us that sw=\r\neden was the only coutry to beat the russians\nand to take moscow. I should =\r\nhave known better...\n\n\nThis is not to piss anyone off, just a mere observat=\r\nion okay.\nTogukawa versus Mideval Sweden is kind of like \nThe Taliban facei=\r\nng USA, Old khalashinkov against\n&quot;missiles-that-can-be-directed-up-your-ass=\r\n&quot;\nlol...\n\nNow lets get back to the good old days of Togukawa and foxy ladys=\r\n in\nkimonos... \n\n\n/// Chris \n\n&quot;God&#39;s in his heaven.

I \n&gt; don&#39;t know anything about Karl the 12=\r\nth, but Gustavus was king in the \n&gt; 1630&#39;s during the 30 years war.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\nTime to crack the books again ;) I know from personal \n&gt; experience that\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;NONE of the juicy bits of history are taught in most grade schools.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n   \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Not in Sweden, they teach it with a fair deal of gore and s=\r\nlaying to \n&gt; &gt;keep the class intrested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Lucky dogs! American schools =\r\nfrankly teach very little \n&gt; history and don&#39;t \n&gt; do a very good job about =\r\nwhat little they teach.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Fantastic Fact: Sweden is the only country in=\r\n the world (to my\n&gt; &gt;knowledge) that has actually managed to conqer Russia,=\r\n and Moscow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; The French did the same, with the same results.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Th=\r\ne Japanese military didnt evolv at all untill the meji revolution. \n&gt; &gt;Kind=\r\na stagnant for 400 years...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Kind of my point with comparing the=\r\n Tokugawa forces with \n&gt; armies of the \n&gt; 30 years war in Europe. Mobile ar=\r\ntillery would be a very bad \n&gt; surprise. \n&gt; Of course it gets even worse as=\r\n time passes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Matthew E. Hoyle&quot; &lt;matthewhoyle@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Does anyone know why the Mongols tried to invade Japan ? \n&gt; They must h=\r\nave \n&gt; &gt;had a good reason as they tried twice in the late 13th cent ?\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I know the jidai-geki answer (historical soap opera). They refused t=\r\no \n&gt; submit to the Khan and I think the Khan wanted to kill off \n&gt; some Kor=\r\nean \n&gt; conscripts as well as drain Korea of money so Korea (Korai \n&gt; sp?) w=\r\nould be \n&gt; less troublesome to rule. I&#39;m not really sure if Japan really ha=\r\nd any \n&gt; other importance other than as a method to drain subject states of=\r\n \n&gt; excessive manpower.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n Yahoo!
