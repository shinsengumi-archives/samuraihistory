If you&#39;re more specific with time =\r\nI can help you further, but to quickly give you the simple answer:\n\n1. If s=\r\nomeone was hired at 1500 koku (a koku wasn&#39;t a bushel, by the way, but the =\r\namount generally calculated to feed 1 man for 1 year--can&#39;t pull the estima=\r\nted bushel total out of my wheelhouse at the moment, and my resources aren&#39;=\r\nt close at hand), then he was hired at 1500 koku. You can&#39;t calculate the d=\r\nollar amount without knowing a VERY specific time, because rice prices chan=\r\nged so often, and even then you&#39;re calculating into contemporary currency, =\r\nnot today&#39;s figures. \n\n2. Generally speaking if the kokudaka system was use=\r\nd, the retainer was paid in rice. During the mid to late-1500s many daimyo =\r\ninstituted the kandaka system, where taxes were collected in kan (coin) and=\r\n it was the taxpayer&#39;s responsibility to convert their produce (not just ri=\r\nce, but whatever they had) into coin. Under that system, a retainer would h=\r\nave been paid in coin. Hideyoshi and then Ieyasu reverted back to a koku of=\r\n rice being the standardized taxation unit, and therefore what retainers we=\r\nre paid in. \n\n3. Lump sum, yes. This is why you hear so many tales of the w=\r\nomen of the house having to shave their heads and sell their hair, or do ot=\r\nher things to make ends meet--call it poor budgeting. \n\n\n\n\n________________=\r\n________________\nFrom: ldsheridan &lt;ldsheridan@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thu, December 24, 2009 6:42:44 PM\nSubject: [samuraih=\r\nistory] Koku\n\n  \nHello. I have a question about koku. If someone was retain=\r\ned at 1500 bushels of rice, what exactly does that mean? Is it equivalent t=\r\no being hired at $15,000 a year? In other words the retainer would be given=\r\n coin to the value of 1500 bushels or rice..  Was that amount given in one =\r\nlump sum, or was it parceled out during the year?\n\nWhat I&#39;m after is to und=\r\nerstand how koku actually worked within Japan at the time.\n\nThank you\n\n\n \n\n=\r\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
