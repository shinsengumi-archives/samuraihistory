So many people here are saying it isn&#39;t even theoretically \npossible, but actually, it is theoretically possible. Didn&#39;t say probable. Didn&#39;t say likely. Didn&#39;t \nsay I want it to happen or anything of the sort. Just that it was theoretically possible.\n&gt; On Feb 2, 2004, at 7:19 AM, golfmandan@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is theoretically possible, though, that the class could be \n&gt; &gt; restored, either through a legal\n&gt; &gt; decision, or through a collective revolt by samurai descendents. I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; trying to think of an\n&gt; &gt; historical illustration of this... Can&#39;t. Does anyone else know of a \n&gt; &gt; restoration of a class through\n&gt; &gt; revolt or law? In The Three Musketeers, this happens with the \n&gt; &gt; Musketeers. But that&#39;s fiction,\n&gt; &gt; and the Musketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there might be some \n&gt; &gt; parallels). Lookin&#39; for a real\n&gt; &gt; historical example...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a different idea...\n&gt; &gt; In India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real \n&gt; &gt; everyday life, the caste\n&gt; &gt; system is just as real as it was before the laws. The law only serves \n&gt; &gt; its purpose if people obey\n&gt; &gt; it, or if it is enforced. So it is theoretically possible, also, that \n&gt; &gt; descendents of samurai could\n&gt; &gt; claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would \n&gt; &gt; for all intents and\n&gt; &gt; purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished. Of \n&gt; &gt; course, what a samurai\n&gt; &gt; today would do or be is ... well... difficult to imagine. Maybe they \n&gt; &gt; would carry two guns instead\n&gt; &gt; of two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police \n&gt; &gt; force.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Theoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the \n&gt; &gt; abolishment of the\n&gt; &gt; samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public \n&gt; &gt; still regarded them as\n&gt; &gt; samurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. \n&gt; &gt; (Governments often act in an\n&gt; &gt; inconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, \n&gt; &gt; would that group of\n&gt; &gt; people still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think they would.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This has some parallel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man \n&gt; &gt; and woman &quot;shack up&quot;\n&gt; &gt; for an extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though \n&gt; &gt; they have never\n&gt; &gt; exchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man \n&gt; &gt; and wife. That was\n&gt; &gt; common practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eventually \n&gt; &gt; recognized this and would\n&gt; &gt; after said elapse of time pronounce them legally man and wife (so the \n&gt; &gt; government could get\n&gt; &gt; additional taxes out of them).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the \n&gt; &gt; government acknowledged\n&gt; &gt; them to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one man and wife. \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many\n&gt; &gt; cultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of paper&quot; from the government to confirm \n&gt; &gt; or legitimize the marriage.\n&gt; &gt; Public practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal \n&gt; &gt; action.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public \n&gt; &gt; acceptance, apart from\n&gt; &gt; law, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw \n&gt; &gt; marriage or the Indian caste\n&gt; &gt; system), how much of the public would it take to justify that claim? \n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s the critical mass\n&gt; &gt; required for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in \n&gt; &gt; the samurai&#39;s heyday,\n&gt; &gt; there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as it was. \n&gt; &gt; Maybe 51%? A simple\n&gt; &gt; majority? Who decides what the percentage would be?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today... but theoretically, \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Honestly, I do not understand the meaning of the whole discussion. \n&gt; Theoretically, you can speculate, but it makes no sense at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Modern Japan is a democracy, and classes have nothing to do with it. \n&gt; There is no way the government is going to pay a salary to samurai \n&gt; descendants, no way people could go around the country carrying \n&gt; weapons, and once again I remind you that to be a samurai means to \n&gt; ***SERVE*** a lord.\n&gt; So, who will they serve? Shogun Koizumi?\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, the comparison with India does not hold up. India is a 75% \n&gt; rural country, a pseudo-democracy, and a country where the great \n&gt; majority of people are Hindu: classes are defined by religion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, unlike in Japan, Indian society is still structured on a vertical \n&gt; axis, especially at the village level. Japan has vertical relationships \n&gt; in schools, companies, etc. but NOT in its constitution. The vertical \n&gt; relationships in Japan are of a microcosmic nature, and do not permeate \n&gt; society as a whole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not yet mollified by Western \n&gt; influences and got rid of  Buddhism.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are the reasons why Hindu ideology can still continue. (And of \n&gt; course -as usual- there are economic reasons as well.)\n&gt; \n&gt; And talking about economy, being the second wealthiest country in the \n&gt; world, having schools, hospitals, Panasonics and Toyotas, do you think \n&gt; the Japanese would care a bit about restoring a medieval social class?\n&gt; \n&gt; Guys: give up.\n&gt; Let&#39;s stop confounding history with reactionary science fiction.\n&gt; \n&gt; cepo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
