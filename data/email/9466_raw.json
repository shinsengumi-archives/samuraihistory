I am considering\n&gt;(seriously considering) publishing a quarterly Japanese history\n&gt;journal. The main issue to address, aside from wondering if anyone\n&gt;would even want to buy it, is, I would need to gather enough articles\n&gt;to constitute a bi-yearly or quarterly journal.  So these are the\n&gt;initial questions:\n&gt;\n&gt;1. If the S-A published a history journal (actual paperback high\n&gt;quality books), with 4-6 articles, probably totalling 80-120 pages,\n&gt;would you consider buying/subscribing?\n&gt;2. Is there anyone who would be interested in actually contributing\n&gt;articles? (I would have a set of requirements TBD)\n&gt;\n&gt;All of the details are TBD (To Be Decided), I&#39;m just testing the\n&gt;waters here. I would aim for between 8-16 articles a year (the number\n&gt;of articles would determine the number of issues) and would set an\n&gt;estimated target of between 25-60 pages per article, and an assortment\n&gt;of other requirements. Basically it would be in official book form,\n&gt;with issues available to purchase online via amazon.com,\n&gt;barnesandnoble.com etc., or if I decide to offer a subscription, it\n&gt;would be available for a discount.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, thoughts?\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWindows Live Messenger - kivuttoman viestinn�n puolestapuhuja. \nhttp://www.communicationevolved.com/fi-fi/\n\n\n"
