I&#39;v been out of town awhile and haven&#39;t checked my \n&gt; email recently. Now that you mention its a parody I still wonder why \n&gt; anyone would waste their time on creating a site that pokes fun at the \n&gt; perspective most Americans have of ninja. I mean will it change the \n&gt; attitude? Somebody&#39;s wasting their time I think. And definitely \n&gt; sarcasm is not something you spare Nate.\n&gt; Later.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!!! Who in God&#39;s name\n&gt; &gt; created that site. It reads like a child wrote it.\n&gt; &gt; Ninja just flip out and kill people? Ha, ha, ha!!!!\n&gt; &gt; Somebody put the author out of his misery, please!\n&gt;\n&gt; And once again we have to explain that it`s a PARODY\n&gt; site...\n&gt;\n&gt; Sarcasm, Irony....a lost art, it seems.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
