And sometimes disasgreeing\n&gt; with them. That&#39;s not an\n&gt; &quot;attack.&quot;  \n\n*sigh* Haven&#39;t said *YOU* were, Nina...see last\nmessage...\n\n\n&gt; Okay, a point of disagreement: Saying &quot;but also&quot;\n&gt; concerning Part B is NOT a\n&gt; dividing line between the two statements, and wasn&#39;t\n&gt; intended to be.\n&gt; Instead, I&#39;m trying to say (perhaps not so clearly,\n&gt; though I&#39;m trying) that\n&gt; the line between fiction and history books is not\n&gt; ALWAYS so clear as far as\n&gt; using them to study history. It looks like that it&#39;s\n&gt; in this one area where\n&gt; we disagree.\n\nIt&#39;s a connector, connecting two seperate thoughts. If\nthey weren&#39;t two seperate thoughts, there would be no\nneed to connect them. Regardless, I had thought A. You\n*MAY* have thoughts A and B, and may have them\nconnected. No problem--good for you. However, our\nintrepid Onna had thought B, and used thought B to try\nto contradict my thought A. I don&#39;t see how that\nworks. \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nStart your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page! \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n"
