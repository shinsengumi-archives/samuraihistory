It seems to me that the urge to collect Japanese swords shoul=\r\nd be\ncurbed until a decent sword may be obtained. I think to collect anythi=\r\nng,\nyou must buy the best quality you can with the money available. Therefo=\r\nre if\nyou only have =A3200-=A3300 you might be better advised to buy a reas=\r\nonable\nkogai or tsuba rather than a repro sword which really is not a Japan=\r\nese\nsword at all, only a pale facsimile. Early collectors are rather vulner=\r\nable\nin this respect and should curb their enthusiasm until they can make\ni=\r\nnformed judgements. Now, although I am a lifetime collector of Japanese\nswo=\r\nrds, I know that the swords that I really would like to have, are way\nbeyon=\r\nd my reach unless a miracle involving the national lottery occurs and\nproba=\r\nbly even then, they are unobtainable. However, this by no means\nprevents me=\r\n seeing, handling, studying and appreciating these objects and\nthe need to =\r\npossess them becomes less of an issue. As has been said many\ntimes before, =\r\nas the swords will outlast our lifetimes, we never really own\nthem and are =\r\nsimply caretakers for a certain time. Further, I would advise,\nonly look at=\r\n good swords and do not waste your time on poor quality swords\nsuch as Show=\r\na-to. Looking at poor quality swords will effect your judgement\nin a negati=\r\nve way.\nThere is no short cut to learning about swords, even with the help =\r\nof the\ninternet. The internet will provide vast amounts of information but =\r\nthis\nwill not give you knowledge. For instance, you may read that there is =\r\na\nfeature in swords by certain Rai school swordsmiths known as Nie-utsuri a=\r\nnd\nyou will know this fact but until you see this on a sword, you will neve=\r\nr\nreally know what Nie-usturi is or be able to recognise it.\nReading the ab=\r\nove it sounds rather pompous and I don&#39;t mean it to be. Many\nthese days, in=\r\nfluenced by films and other things, glimpse the fascination of\nthe Japanese=\r\n sword but are not prepared for the long and hard study involved\nin the sub=\r\nject. My concern is that they get their hands onto swords and\nunintentional=\r\ny but through ignorance, impart ireperable damage on these\nartistic and cul=\r\ntural icons. Ignorance is the greatest enemy of the Japanese\nsword in the 2=\r\n1st centuruy.\nTime to get off my soap box\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n\n\n\n\n----=\r\n- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Elizabeth Chase&quot; &lt;lizzirrd@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;s=\r\namuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, January 21, 2005 6:55 AM\nSubje=\r\nct: Patience --- Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai Swords\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d have to vote=\r\n along Mr. Wallis&#39; line of reasoning....  learning all you\ncan by reading, =\r\n going to museums, and politely pestering\n&gt; your sword-owning friends for p=\r\nroper viewings.....   and remember... you\nasked:  you buy dinner and refres=\r\nhments.  Sword handling\n&gt; etiquette would help.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the meantime, tithe =\r\nyourself each payday and hide that money.

Personally buy a f=\r\new books and learn what to look for in a good blade\nalso check out the exce=\r\nllent sword display at the british\n&gt; museum. To cap it off better to invest=\r\n in some good books on the subject\nand save for a better blade that way you=\r\n wont get ripped\n&gt; of. james\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message hav=\r\ne been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives=\r\n.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; -=\r\n-- \n&gt; Yahoo!
