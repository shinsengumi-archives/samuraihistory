While\n&gt; the Habu is probably\n&gt; the most infamous \n&gt; \n&gt; snake in Japan there are quite a few poisonous\n&gt; snakes throughout Japan, all\n&gt; the way to Hokkaido.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a link to a web page I found about snakes in\n&gt; Japan and if you scroll\n&gt; down you will find a family \n&gt; \n&gt; of poisonous snakes and a brief description of there\n&gt; geographic\n&gt; distribution.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; http://homepage3.nifty.com/japrep/snake/ejaphebi.htm\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for my first post to be a bit off topic but I\n&gt; though it might be\n&gt; relevant to this current discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; John\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 09, 2007 7:24 AM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: CLASS PAPER.

They simply don&#39;t exist, so\n&gt; apparently ninja were able to breed poisonous snakes\n&gt; as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
