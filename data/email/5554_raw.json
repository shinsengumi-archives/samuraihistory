One is a pair of 17th-century \n=\r\nJapanese six-panel screens that depict the Portuguese on their ships \nas th=\r\ney are approaching Japan. The Japanese found the foreigners \nstrange; they =\r\nare depicted with red hair, bulging eyes and huge \nnoses. This cross-cultur=\r\nal art, known as Namban in Japan, is always \nworth a look, if only to see h=\r\now Westerners were viewed when first \nencountered.\n\nChristie&#39;s is also sell=\r\ning an entire set of Noh theater masks and \nrobes from an Edo-period (1615-=\r\n1868) collection. They belonged to a \nlord from Yamanouchi Province. Any wo=\r\nuld-be producers could pick up \nenough masks and costumes at this sale to s=\r\nupply an entire Noh \ntroupe. \n\nMany galleries plan exhibitions to coincide =\r\nwith the auctions, and \nthe most astonishing show of Japanese work may be t=\r\nhe elaborate \nJapanese sword fittings at Sebastian Izzard Asian Fine Art, a=\r\nt 17 \nEast 76th Street in Manhattan, from Tuesday through Sept. 30. The \npr=\r\notectors are beaten, patinated, lacquered and adorned with golden \nfigures =\r\nfrom famous Japanese war stories. The workmanship makes \nFaberg=E9 look alm=\r\nost amateur.\n\nThe sword fittings are from the collection of Alexander G. Mo=\r\nsl=E9, a \nGerman businessman who worked in Japan from 1884 to 1907. As the =\r\n\nrepresentative of the Gruson Company, a subsidiary of Krupp Steel, \nMosl=\r\n=E9 was able to persuade the Japanese government to switch from \nFrench to =\r\nGerman arms just as Japan was asserting itself as a \nmilitary power. (The f=\r\nirst Sino-Japanese War was in 1894-95 and the \nRusso-Japanese War in 1904-0=\r\n5.)\n\nThe arms trade made Mosl=E9 wealthy; at one point he had 2,249 \nJapane=\r\nse swords, armor, more than 1,600 sword fittings, Japanese \npaintings, prin=\r\nts, sculptures, ceramics, lacquer and textiles. Mosl=E9 \nretired in 1907 an=\r\nd returned to Germany, working with scholars and \ndealers to learn more abo=\r\nut his collection. In 1909 he exhibited it \nat the K=F6nigliches Kunstgewer=\r\nbe Museum in Berlin. It was published \nin two catalogs in 1914, which are s=\r\ntill considered important \nreference works.\n\nIn the late 1920&#39;s, Mosl=E9 tr=\r\naveled to the United States to try to \nsell his collection to public instit=\r\nutions. He did sell some prints \nto the Art Institute of Chicago and some l=\r\nacquers to the Freer \nGallery of Art in Washington, but, apparently, little=\r\n more. He was \nin the United States in 1941, when America went to war, and =\r\nwas \nstranded here. Sometime before his death in 1949, he entered a \nmental=\r\n institution.\n\nHis bank organized a sale of his Japanese works at Parke-Ber=\r\nnet in \nNew York in 1948, including the fittings in this sale. These 170 \nw=\r\norks have been in private hands since that earlier sale. They \ninclude simp=\r\nle designs made of iron and ceremonial sets embellished \nwith gold, silver =\r\nand copper. They range in price from a few \nthousand to a few hundred thous=\r\nand dollars apiece.\n\nIt is not easy for Americans to appreciate the importa=\r\nnce of swords \nin pre-20th-century Japan. Beginning in feudal times, Japane=\r\nse \nwarlords equipped their armies with razor-sharp swords and fancy \nsword=\r\n fittings.\n\n&quot;During the Edo period, a time of peace, swords were worn as st=\r\natus \nsymbols,&quot; said Mr. Izzard, who was the head of the Japanese and \nKore=\r\nan art department at Christie&#39;s from 1980 to 1997. &quot;Craft \nschools speciali=\r\nzing in sword fittings emerged, each with its own \ntraditions and styles.&quot;\n=\r\n\nSamurai wore their swords in public, a symbol of class and honor. A \nsamur=\r\nai might choose quiet, subdued fittings to wear at a high \ngovernmental occ=\r\nasion or something more flamboyant for a more casual \nevent, much as women =\r\nwear their jewels today. In 1876 the emperor \nMeiji banned the wearing of s=\r\nwords in public as part of his \nmodernization campaign.\n\n&quot;What were once we=\r\narable symbols of wealth, prestige or entitlement \nbecame relics that illus=\r\ntrated 600 years of designs by some of the \nworld&#39;s finest metalworkers,&quot; M=\r\nr. Izzard said. &quot;Collecting swords \nand their fittings quickly became popul=\r\nar in Japan and the West. Mosl\n=E9&#39;s tenure in Japan coincided with the wav=\r\ne of interest in Japanese \nart among Westerners, who were intrigued by the =\r\nrecently opened \ncountry and its culture.&quot; \n\nJaponisme swept over Europe an=\r\nd America, influencing artists, \nfurniture and textile designers and metalw=\r\norkers. Mr. Mosl=E9 was in \nthe right place at the right time. The Metropol=\r\nitan Museum of Art, \nthe Brooklyn Museum and the Cooper-Hewitt National Des=\r\nign Museum all \nhave Japanese metalwork in their collections, some from the=\r\n same \nperiod. \n\nMany of Mr. Izzard&#39;s sword fittings come in beautifully la=\r\ncquered \nboxes that may have been commissioned by Mr. Mosl=E9; they are wor=\r\nks \nof art in themselves. Sword fittings are ardently collected by \nconnois=\r\nseurs of Japanese art, so it is worth seeing Mr. Mosl=E9&#39;s \ncollection befo=\r\nre it is dispersed.\n\nDoyle New York will not have its Chinese porcelain auc=\r\ntion until \nOct. 27, but from Monday through next Friday the auction house =\r\nis \nscheduling previews by appointment for 60 lots of Chinese blue and \nwhi=\r\nte porcelain from the Kangxi period (1662-1722) from the Ralph \nSpencer Col=\r\nlection. (Information: Andrea Blunck Frost, Doyle&#39;s Asian \nart expert, 212-=\r\n427-4141.)\n\nMr. Spencer assembled his collection in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s on =\r\ntrips \nto London and at prominent Manhattan galleries like Chait. He was a =\r\n\ncontemporary, and collecting rival, of \n\nF. Gordon Morrill, whose Chinese =\r\nporcelain collection Doyle sold \nlast September for $12 million. (Morrill&#39;s=\r\n rare Yuan dynasty pilgrim \nflask, circa 1345, sold for $5.8 million, a wor=\r\nld auction record for \na piece of Chinese porcelain.)\n\nThe Spencer Collecti=\r\non, which is later in date, is expected to earn \nabout $300,000. \n\nPhiladel=\r\nphia Curator\n\nAnne d&#39;Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum o=\r\nf Art, \nhas announced the appointment of David L. Barquist as curator of \nA=\r\nmerican decorative arts, beginning in January. Mr. Barquist has \nbeen actin=\r\ng curator of American decorative arts at the Yale \nUniversity Art Gallery, =\r\nwhere he began his career as an intern in \n1981.\n\nAn authority on American =\r\nsilver, Mr. Barquist is the author of &quot;Myer \nMyers: Jewish Silversmith in C=\r\nolonial New York&quot; and &quot;American and \nEnglish Pewter at the Yale University =\r\nArt Gallery.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Philadelphia collections are extraordinary, but the mus=\r\neum is \nregionally focused,&quot; Mr. Barquist said in an interview. &quot;In trying =\r\n\nto present the story of American decorative arts, there are a few \nholes o=\r\nne would try to fill judiciously. We need a few carefully \nchosen examples =\r\nof works from places like Boston to play off of the \nmuseum&#39;s collections.&quot;=\r\n\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/17/arts/design/17ANTI.html\n\n\n\n\n\n"
