I am no expert, but I did do a little\nsearchin on the net and found out this about oniwabanshu (can someone\nplz tell me what that means?)\n\n&quot;The Oniwabanshuu were a group of ninjas/onmitsus established by the 8th\nTokugawa shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune (1684-1751), who is considered to be\none of Japan&#39;s greatest rulers. His far-reaching reforms totally\nreshaped the central administration structure and temporarily halted the\ndecline of the shogunate. He was originally the head of Kii, one of the\nthree hereditary Japanese feudal fiefs ruled by descendants of the\noriginal Tokugawa ruler not in the main line of succession to the\nShogunate. (The other two fiefs/hans were Owari and Mito - together, the\n3 hans were known as the 3 Houses, or Sanke.) A lack of sons in the main\nbranch of the family, though, resulted in Yoshimune&#39;s succession to the\nposition of Shogun in 1716. \n\nYoshimune established the Oniwabanshuu for security, information\ngathering and spying activities. Originally, members of the Oniwabanshuu\nwere chosen from the Kii clan, and was passed down in the families - in\nother words, the posts of the Oniwabanshuu were hereditary. They acted\nas security guards in the Edo castle, besides spying on other clans of\ntheir policies and actions. It was also believed that in Bakumatsu\ntimes, Oniwabanshuu members were placed among the missions sent to\nAmerica.&quot;\n\nI have no knowledge in this area so I cannot verify nor deni its\nauthentisity.\nThis is the link were i found the info.\nhttp://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/history.htm\n\n/// Chris \n\n&quot;God&#39;s in his heaven.

There has probablu \n&gt; been something in the general function of the oniwabanshu in \n&gt; Kyoto. As said in an other mail on sthe subject of &quot;ninjas&quot; \n&gt; and Shinobu. They have with out a doubt existed. We just dont \n&gt; know very much about them, and their activites. But then \n&gt; again, they were sceret spies and guerillas so it would have \n&gt; been counterproductive to be known.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a modern paralell, There are 120 suspected spy academies \n&gt; around the world. But only two publicly known. CIA&#39;s The Farm \n&gt; outside Washinton DC and i think the other one is in UK or \n&gt; Russia. Not sure there. Do we know what and who are training \n&gt; there? Nope. Not a clue. Why? sore wa himitsu des! (as Xellos \n&gt; would have said)\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; /// Chris \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;God&#39;s in his heaven.
