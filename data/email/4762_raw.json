The name kodachi literally means &quot;short \nlongsword.&quot;  Or at least something similar to that.  It is still classified \nas a long sword, and often weilded as such since it is possible to use both \nhands on the tsuka (handle) whereas the wakizashi can only be used with one \nhand due to the short tsuka.\n  The advantage to a kodachi over a daito is that it is slightly faster to \nmove with, however it is shorter which means you have to get that much \ncloser to be effective with it.  All depends on what you want focus on, \nspeed or range.\n  On a side note, the odachi that I mentioned before literally translates to \ngreat longsword.  Just something else to add to the &quot;prefix + dachi&quot; thing.\n  My appologies if my translations are off, I am still in the process of \nteaching myself.  I will be taking more formal nihonga classes this fall.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 9 Dial-up Internet Access helps fight spam and pop-ups ï¿½ now 2 months \nFREE! http://join.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
