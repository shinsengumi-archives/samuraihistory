And se exactlu witch king you are refering to.\n\nWe have many Kings na=\r\nmed Gustav in our history.\n\n\nHowever, the Swedish history classs are very b=\r\niased. I live in southern\n\nparts of Sweden, called Sk=E5ne or Scania in lat=\r\nin. We used to belong to\n\nDenmark a few undred years bak, then sweden waged=\r\n war against denmark\n\nand took scania. We vere swedish for a few years and =\r\nthen danish and\n\nthen swedish. Untill around 1640 i think, whne we became p=\r\nermanetely\n\nswedish. I happen to live in a town called Kristianstad. an old=\r\n military\n\ncity founded by King Kristian II (the second). In denmark and Sc=\r\nania, He\n\nis refered to as &quot;Kristian den gode&quot; (Kristian the good) for the\n=\r\n\nliberation of skane from sweden. In sweden they call him &quot;Kristian\n\nTyrann=\r\n&quot; (Kristian the oppressor/tyrant).\n\nSo I was taught that he was a mean evil=\r\n man, in grammar school and in\n\nintermediat school, but in junior high I go=\r\nt a teacher who studied\n\nscania history in the university, and he told me t=\r\nhe opposit version of\n\nwhat I had ben taught before. Thats when i realised =\r\nthat the winners\n\nwrite history. USA and Russia fought the Nazis and won er=\r\ngo they fought\n\nfor freedom. It is really just a matter of ponit of view. N=\r\never trust\n\nhistory to tellyou what really happend.\n\n\nI stand corrected aga=\r\nin. I really ought to go mideval on my old history\n\nteacher, he told us tha=\r\nt sweden was the only coutry to beat the russians\n\nand to take moscow. I sh=\r\nould have known better...\n\n\n\nThis is not to piss anyone off, just a mere ob=\r\nservation okay.\n\nTogukawa versus Mideval Sweden is kind of like \n\nThe Talib=\r\nan faceing USA, Old khalashinkov against\n\n&quot;missiles-that-can-be-directed-up=\r\n-your-ass&quot;\n\nlol...\n\n\nNow lets get back to the good old days of Togukawa and=\r\n foxy ladys in\n\nkimonos... \n\n\n\n/// Chris \n\n\n&quot;God&#39;s in his heaven.

I \n\n&gt; don&#39;t=\r\n know anything about Karl the 12th, but Gustavus was king in the \n\n&gt; 1630&#39;s=\r\n during the 30 years war.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Time to crack the books again ;) I know =\r\nfrom personal \n\n&gt; experience that\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;NONE of the juicy bits of history ar=\r\ne taught in most grade schools.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;Not in Sweden, the=\r\ny teach it with a fair deal of gore and slaying to \n\n&gt; &gt;keep the class intr=\r\nested.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; Lucky dogs!

They refused to \n\n&gt;=\r\n submit to the Khan and I think the Khan wanted to kill off \n\n&gt; some Korean=\r\n \n\n&gt; conscripts as well as drain Korea of money so Korea (Korai \n\n&gt; sp?) wo=\r\nuld be \n\n&gt; less troublesome to rule.
