I can&#39;t believe how p=\r\nhenomenally \n&gt; difficult it is to piece together all this information...  C=\r\nlearly, \n&gt; record-keeping was not a priority for Samurai or Peasants during=\r\n the \n&gt; turbulent 1620&#39;s...  \n&gt; \n&gt; Can you recommend any well-organized boo=\r\nks, periodicals, and/or \n&gt; websites that provides comprehensive lists of Da=\r\nimyos per regions?  \n&gt; i.e. I am looking for a list Daimyos on Kyushu only.=\r\n  \n\nRecord-keeping has always been an obsession throughout Japanese\nhistory=\r\n. Every clan has detailed genealogies and detailed clan\nhistories. If you c=\r\nan&#39;t read Japanese, you are more limited, but I&#39;d\njust be creative - I woul=\r\nd first find a map something like this one:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com=\r\n/maphome.html\nThen I would write down the names of all of the daimyo I see =\r\non\nKyushu, and then I would get various library books that deal with\nJapane=\r\nse history, flip to the index, and try to find out who was in\ncharge of the=\r\n clan during the 1620s - off the top of my head, George\nSansom&#39;s 2nd and/or=\r\n 3rd book (History of Japan) would be one place to\nlook. It&#39;s pretty basic =\r\nresearch. If you read Japanese, the Japanese\nwikipedia and harimaya.com has=\r\n detailed family trees for almost every\nmajor clan, and the Sengoku Jinmei =\r\nJiten edited by Abe would be\nanother resource. I&#39;d help out, but I don&#39;t ha=\r\nve the time. Maybe\nsomeone else around here?\n\nAlso, I&#39;m curious - what &quot;tur=\r\nbulence&quot; are you talking about during the\n1620s? I can&#39;t think of much of a=\r\nnything overly turbulent happening in\nthe 1620s aside from the non-event of=\r\n Iemitsu becoming shogun, and the\nstart of Sakoku.\n\n\n"
