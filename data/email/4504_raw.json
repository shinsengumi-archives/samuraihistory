History is quite a different \nmatter from speculation.  Speculating, though, is still fun to do, and as a(n \nunpublished) fiction writer, I do it ALL the time with various situations that I \nwrite about.  Pertaining to history, I used to do it all the time with the end \nof the Tsars when I was a more concentrated student of Russian history, and my \nquery to Tony some time ago about the alt-history novel about Nobunaga&#39;s \nsister, O-ichi.  But in order to speculate, it helps to know the history anyway.  \n:-)  And history is, IMHO, a fascinating subject anyway.  :-)\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
