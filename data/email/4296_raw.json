I&#39;d=\r\n like to try to do something else for \na change of pace.\n\nIn 1877 Saig=F6 T=\r\nakamori led his remaining 40 samurai (which once \nnumbered over 12,000) aga=\r\ninst the new Japanese Imperial army and \ninto the movies in 2003.\n\nThe Japa=\r\nnese Imperial army of that period was dressed in French \nGarde Mobile style=\r\n uniforms. Japanese infantrymen wore a dark blue \nkepi, a short jacket with=\r\n French style field pack, and dark blue \npants. The cavalry wore red kepis =\r\nwith a small white plume in the \nfront, dark blue jackets, red pants with a=\r\n yellow stripe, and black \nboots. Their lance pennants were red over white.=\r\n\n\nWhat would you recommend for 28mm figures to represent the Japanese \nImpe=\r\nrial army? I&#39;d like to build this army to fight against my \nexisting samura=\r\ni army. It would be an interesting game.\n\n\n\n\n--&gt; My first thought would be =\r\nto suggest some of the foundry ranges, to see\nif anything can be converted =\r\nbut Old Glory would also be well worth checking\nout. I am sure its possible=\r\n to convert the miniatures if no range is aleady\navailable.\n\nThere has been=\r\n &quot;talk&quot; from several companies of them doing a range and there\nmay be other=\r\n companies who have something more suitable availalbe already,\ncheck the in=\r\nternet or wargames press.\n\nI have a book on the period at home which is exc=\r\nellant and contains a lot of\ndetail so the reference material is available =\r\nif a company decided to do a\nrange, and I am sure someone will, movies tend=\r\n to have that knock on effect!\n\nApologies that the information is not that =\r\nhelpful but I will do some more\ninvestigation as I get time during the week=\r\n, and see if I can find out if a\nspecific range is out there.\n\nWhat manufac=\r\nturers do you use for your existing Samurai army?\n\nCheers\n\nRob\n\nRob Broom\nW=\r\narhammer Historical General Manager\nrobb@...\nwww.warhammer=\r\n-historical.com\n\n\n\n"
