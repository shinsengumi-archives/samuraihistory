I certainly didn&#39;t see him as any more insane than \nanybody else\n&gt; engaged in that line of work.  (That is to say, a soldier for a mob \nfamily.)\n&gt; Which, being a line of work with ancient and honourable feudal \nantecedents,\n&gt; would scarcely seem to indicate insanity within the context of \nbushido -\n&gt; ancient or modern.\n&gt; \tWhat&#39;s your reasoning on this?  By what measure is the \nWhittaker character\n&gt; insane that would not find, say, the average highly-dedicated \nhanshi of the\n&gt; Edo period equally schizophrenic?\n&gt; \tMyself, I found admirable the clear-sighted honesty with \nwhich he\n&gt; recognised the growing outcome of the whole little war, and the \ncourage and\n&gt; integrity with which he faced his own end.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tNote that I do not say I find his profession admirable - \nonly the qualities\n&gt; I specified.  I don&#39;t choose to be put in the position of defending \nthe\n&gt; profession of hit-men, but I am always interested in people in the \nmodern\n&gt; world who are trying to live out the ancient codes.  I thought, and \nthink,\n&gt; that &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; presented that idea far better than most attempts \nmade at\n&gt; that theme.  In a cinematic climate of special effects, gimmicky \nninja, bad\n&gt; swordplay presented as essential martial art, and a very imperfect \ngrasp of\n&gt; the difference between personal glory and personal honour, &quot;Ghost \nDog&quot; stood\n&gt; out with well-drawn characters who remained true to themselves (for \nbetter\n&gt; or worse) throughout.\n&gt; \tSo I am most interested in your reasoning on the question \nof the\n&gt; character&#39;s insanity.\n&gt; \t\tGereg\n\nIt just seemed painfully obvious that the main character was \nsuffering from some form of mental illness and was dillusional.  It \nhas been over a year since I have seen it, but he displayed all sorts \nof signs of mental illness.  He was solitary and obsessive, incapable \nof fitting in to society.  &quot;Normal&quot; assassins tend to be sociopaths \nwho can function in society - watch any Mafia movie. Ghost Dog was \ndelusional - he structured his reality around the notion \nof &quot;Bushido&quot;, not as a philosophy of life like any normal person, but \nas an obsession. He was not even close to &quot;normal&quot;.  I liked the \nmovie as far as movies go, it just seemed to me that he was playing \nthe part of an insane character.\n\n\n"
