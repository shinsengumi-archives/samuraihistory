The Takeda\n&gt; struggled on for\n&gt; another 7 years - albeit heavily reduced in power -\n&gt; and the losses\n&gt; suffered in the battle probably had a lot more to do\n&gt; with Katsuyori\n&gt; being heavily outnumbered and in a poor strategic\n&gt; position than the use\n&gt; of rifles by Nobunaga. \n\nPoor operational and tactical position, actually.\nLooking at the battle in the terms of long term\neffects isn&#39;t where the importance of this battle\nlies; the beauty (speaking as a military officer) is\nthe design of the Oda plan, integrating terrain and\nman-made obstacles with the firearms to defeat the\nstrength of the opponent. Taking into account recent\nresearch which indicates that the Oda had 1,000, not\n3,000, arquebuses, and that at most 3 ranks could have\nshot in the time it took the Takeda to move from the\nwoodline, across the Rengogawa, and up to the Oda\npalisades (thus nullifying the common image of\n&quot;rotating&quot; fire mowing down the Takeda, since it\nwouldn&#39;t have actually done more than one &quot;rotation&quot;),\nNobunaga&#39;s use of terrain is that much more\nimpressive. \n\nThe Takeda themselves had\n&gt; rifles, and I fancy\n&gt; that they weren&#39;t idiotic enough to ride straight in\n&gt; to a wave of\n&gt; gunfire ala the Nagashino scene in &#39;Kagemusha&#39;.\n\nNo one at this time had &quot;rifles&quot;, as they hadn&#39;t been\ninvented yet. The arquebus was a smoothbore weapon.\nAnd while the Nagashino scene in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; is\ncompletely ridiculous, do not discount the effect of a\ncavalry charge against unprotected arquebusiers. These\nweren&#39;t machine guns, or even, as I said, rifles--one\nshot, then you&#39;ve got to take a significant amount of\ntime to reload. The distances involved clearly show\nthat even with 3 ranks firing &quot;in rotation&quot;, at most\neach rank got one shot off before the Takeda closed\nthe distance. Hardly a British gun square from the\nZulu Wars. Ordinarily, arquebus ashigaru weren&#39;t\nbehind palisades--at best they had nagaeyari (long\nspears) protecting them, similiar to a European pike\nand shot formation, but in 1575 this wasn&#39;t\nnecessarily standard yet. Add in the aura of the\nTakeda Cavalry, and the fact that most ashigaru\n(before Nobunaga made them a major factor in battle,\nanyways) were poorly trained and disciplined, and\nthere was no real reason for the Takeda to expect they\ncouldn&#39;t succeed. \n\n&gt; Katsuyori may not have\n&gt; been as talented as his father, but I&#39;m sure he\n&gt; wasn&#39;t as big a fool as\n&gt; he tends to get credited for either.\n\nSee above. Correct. \n\n&gt; Still, it probably is the most famous battle\n&gt; post-Kamakura, except for\n&gt; maybe Sekigahara, which is far more interesting in\n&gt; my opinion.\n\nIf what you want is political repercussions, see\nSekigahara. Tactically, it bores me, while Nagashino\nfascinates me. No one ever talks about the Sakai\nTadatsugu raid behind the Takeda, or the actual siege\nof Nagashino itself--fascinating maneuvers. The Takeda\noperation was sound, actually, had the traitor in\nOkazaki Castle not been uncovered. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
