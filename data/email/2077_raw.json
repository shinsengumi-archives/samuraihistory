Mizuage did \nNOT become a common practice until the early 20th century. While it \nmay have happened earlier it was when nationalism swept Japan that \nthe Geisha were seen as one of the symbols of old Japan, and were \nseen as the quintesential Japanese.  This popularity of the Geisha \ncaused a boom of 80,000 women in their ranks.  It also caused the \nwide spread practice of mizuage by the women that owned the geisha to \ncash in even more on the patriotism of their patrons.  And, I have \nnot heard of it happening since the end of WWII.  So to say that \nevery Geisha *SELLS* her virginity it might give the impression that \nit is still a wide spread practice that continues to this day.\n\n\n\n"
