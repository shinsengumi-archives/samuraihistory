Of course,\nthis is true only when we secure a certain level of\nleniency from serious historians and Japanese studies\nscholars on their standard of rigor on the historical\nresearch as a science.\n\nI think that this new trend would benefit all of us as\nlong as we do not bog ourselves with frivolous mocking\nand offenses.(personal, racial, and cultural) \nAs someone told probabily about two month ago, I came\nto this group to &#39;LEARN&#39; from experts. In that sense,\ndon&#39;t you think that it would be a good idea not to\nbring up this &#39;death&#39; subject for the time being for\nall of us?\n\nps. I liked an argument using the concept of English\ncommon law(whoever wrote this) and Cesare&#39;s\ncounter-argument. \n\n\n\n        \n                            Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n     \n                            Changsub Lee\n\n\n--- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Feb 2, 2004, at 7:19 AM, golfmandan@...\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is theoretically possible, though, that the\n&gt; class could be \n&gt; &gt; restored, either through a legal\n&gt; &gt; decision, or through a collective revolt by\n&gt; samurai descendents. I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; trying to think of an\n&gt; &gt; historical illustration of this... Can&#39;t. Does\n&gt; anyone else know of a \n&gt; &gt; restoration of a class through\n&gt; &gt; revolt or law? In The Three Musketeers, this\n&gt; happens with the \n&gt; &gt; Musketeers. But that&#39;s fiction,\n&gt; &gt; and the Musketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there\n&gt; might be some \n&gt; &gt; parallels). Lookin&#39; for a real\n&gt; &gt; historical example...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a different idea...\n&gt; &gt; In India, the law has abolished the caste system.\n&gt; However, in real \n&gt; &gt; everyday life, the caste\n&gt; &gt; system is just as real as it was before the laws.\n&gt; The law only serves \n&gt; &gt; its purpose if people obey\n&gt; &gt; it, or if it is enforced. So it is theoretically\n&gt; possible, also, that \n&gt; &gt; descendents of samurai could\n&gt; &gt; claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the\n&gt; general public, they would \n&gt; &gt; for all intents and\n&gt; &gt; purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has\n&gt; been abolished. Of \n&gt; &gt; course, what a samurai\n&gt; &gt; today would do or be is ... well... difficult to\n&gt; imagine. Maybe they \n&gt; &gt; would carry two guns instead\n&gt; &gt; of two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the\n&gt; Japanese police \n&gt; &gt; force.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Theoretically, suppose that history had happened\n&gt; this way: Upon the \n&gt; &gt; abolishment of the\n&gt; &gt; samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai,\n&gt; and the public \n&gt; &gt; still regarded them as\n&gt; &gt; samurai. The government still gave them their\n&gt; stipend, too. \n&gt; &gt; (Governments often act in an\n&gt; &gt; inconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history\n&gt; had happened this way, \n&gt; &gt; would that group of\n&gt; &gt; people still be samurai, even though legally the\n&gt; class was abolished?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think they would.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This has some parallel to the idea of common-law\n&gt; marriages. If a man \n&gt; &gt; and woman &quot;shack up&quot;\n&gt; &gt; for an extended period of time, and live as man\n&gt; and wife, even though \n&gt; &gt; they have never\n&gt; &gt; exchanged vows or rings... they are for all\n&gt; intents and purposes man \n&gt; &gt; and wife. That was\n&gt; &gt; common practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government\n&gt; eventually \n&gt; &gt; recognized this and would\n&gt; &gt; after said elapse of time pronounce them legally\n&gt; man and wife (so the \n&gt; &gt; government could get\n&gt; &gt; additional taxes out of them).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife\n&gt; BEFORE the \n&gt; &gt; government acknowledged\n&gt; &gt; them to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that\n&gt; makes one man and wife. \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many\n&gt; &gt; cultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of paper&quot; from the\n&gt; government to confirm \n&gt; &gt; or legitimize the marriage.\n&gt; &gt; Public practice or public acceptance takes\n&gt; presidence over legal \n&gt; &gt; action.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So what if someone today claimed to be a samurai?\n&gt; If general public \n&gt; &gt; acceptance, apart from\n&gt; &gt; law, would in all practicality make one a samurai\n&gt; (like commonlaw \n&gt; &gt; marriage or the Indian caste\n&gt; &gt; system), how much of the public would it take to\n&gt; justify that claim? \n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s the critical mass\n&gt; &gt; required for acceptance? Certainly not 100\n&gt; percent, because even in \n&gt; &gt; the samurai&#39;s heyday,\n&gt; &gt; there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class\n&gt; system as it was. \n&gt; &gt; Maybe 51%? A simple\n&gt; &gt; majority? Who decides what the percentage would\n&gt; be?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist\n&gt; today... but theoretically, \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Honestly, I do not understand the meaning of the\n&gt; whole discussion. \n&gt; Theoretically, you can speculate, but it makes no\n&gt; sense at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Modern Japan is a democracy, and classes have\n&gt; nothing to do with it. \n&gt; There is no way the government is going to pay a\n&gt; salary to samurai \n&gt; descendants, no way people could go around the\n&gt; country carrying \n&gt; weapons, and once again I remind you that to be a\n&gt; samurai means to \n&gt; ***SERVE*** a lord.\n&gt; So, who will they serve? Shogun Koizumi?\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, the comparison with India does not hold\n&gt; up. India is a 75% \n&gt; rural country, a pseudo-democracy, and a country\n&gt; where the great \n&gt; majority of people are Hindu: classes are defined by\n&gt; religion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, unlike in Japan, Indian society is still\n&gt; structured on a vertical \n&gt; axis, especially at the village level. Japan has\n&gt; vertical relationships \n&gt; in schools, companies, etc. but NOT in its\n&gt; constitution. The vertical \n&gt; relationships in Japan are of a microcosmic nature,\n&gt; and do not permeate \n&gt; society as a whole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not yet\n&gt; mollified by Western \n&gt; influences and got rid of  Buddhism.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are the reasons why Hindu ideology can still\n&gt; continue. (And of \n&gt; course -as usual- there are economic reasons as\n&gt; well.)\n&gt; \n&gt; And talking about economy, being the second\n&gt; wealthiest country in the \n&gt; world, having schools, hospitals, Panasonics and\n&gt; Toyotas, do you think \n&gt; the Japanese would care a bit about restoring a\n&gt; medieval social class?\n&gt; \n&gt; Guys: give up.\n&gt; Let&#39;s stop confounding history with reactionary\n&gt; science fiction.\n&gt; \n&gt; cepo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
