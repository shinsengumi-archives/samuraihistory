But as we&#39;re actually interested in the etiquette of the bushi\nof the Sengoku-jidai, I think he&#39;ll let us off! Alternatively, at least\nhe&#39;ll give us a head start:-)\n\nNow, thanks very much for the information it is invaluable. Arising out\nof your email, I have some additional questions:\n\n&gt;    Basically if sitting in seiza opposite another, it was customary to \n&gt;    remove\n&gt;    the katana from the obi and place it at your side, although, on \n&gt;    entering\n&gt;    another residence, the sword might be given to a page or servant \n&gt;    for safe\n&gt;    storage to be collected when leaving. \n\nWhen entering a public building, was the practise much the same, i.e.\ninns, drinking establishments etc.?  I have read that in some places a\nrack for this purpose was kept by the entrance, is this correct?\n\n&gt;    Rules of sword etiquette \n&gt;    still\n&gt;    applies today although the bloody consequences of poor etiquette \n&gt;    are less\n&gt;    likely, however, good etiquette shows the difference between the \n&gt;    educated\n&gt;    gentlemen and the less well educated. It is unlikely that you will \n&gt;    be able\n&gt;    to view important swords in Japan (on a hands-on basis) such as \n&gt;    National\n&gt;    Treasures etc.unless you have already shown that you fall into the \n&gt;    &quot;educated\n&gt;    gentleman&quot; catagory.\n\nH&#39;mm, sadly, in my case, regardless of how well I become educated, it\nwould not be possible for me to study any weapon that closely. My\neyesight is so poor that I would need to be so near as to damage the\nsurface with my breath. Oh wll...\n\n&gt;    As for No-dachi, I guess they can do whatever they want!! \n\nLikewise their owner!\n\n&gt;although \n&gt;    more\n&gt;    seriously, I prefer a katana-kake as oversized swords are less well \n&gt;    balanced\n&gt;    on a tachi-kake.\n\nSounds like a sensible policy. I&#39;ve seen modern katana-kake designed for\na single sword, but did such things exist earlier? You sometimes see\nlarge calibre teppou displayed on stands like this.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\n\n\n"
