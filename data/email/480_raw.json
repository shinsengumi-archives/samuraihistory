Hanzo, as he is commonly known, had been born in 1541 as the son=\r\n of Hattori Yasunaga, a hereditary retainer of the tokugawa (or Matsudaira =\r\nas they were then named).  He fought his first battle at the age of  16 yea=\r\nrs in the form of a night attack on the castle of Udo in 1557, and went on =\r\nto serve with distinction at the battles of Anegawa (1570) and Mikata ga ha=\r\nra (1572).  His nickname was Devil Hanzo, to distinguish him from another p=\r\nrominent Mikawa Samurai, Watanabe Hanzo.  As noted by Yamaguchi from Mikawa=\r\n Monagatori: &quot;Lord Tokugawa&#39;s best samurai were hattori Hanzo, (Devil Hanzo=\r\n); Watanabe Hanzo, (Spear hanzo) and Atsumi Gengo (Headslicer Gengo).\n\nHatt=\r\nori Hanzo died in 1596 aged 55, and was succeeded by his son Hattori Iwami-=\r\nno-kami Masanari.&quot;\n\nThe text goes on to talk about Tokugawa Ieyasu also emp=\r\nlying Koga men but does not discuss whether they were under the command of =\r\nHattori Hanzo.  Also of interest is the fact that Hanzo&#39;s men became the gu=\r\nards of Edo castle and the Hanzo Gate still bears his name.\n\nHope this is h=\r\nelpful,\n\nMusashi\n\n \n\nHi everyone,\nI&#39;m also trying to find out more about Ha=\r\nttori Hanzo (1541-1596).\nI know that he was a Tokugawa retainer and was als=\r\no a famous leader of \nninja. But were they just Iga ninja or a mixture of I=\r\nga and Koga ninja?\nAlso what was his duties as a retainer? Did he decide ba=\r\nttle strategies or \ndid they know that he was a leader of ninja and used hi=\r\nm because of that? \nand how did he die, I have come across many different s=\r\ntories but I&#39;m trying \nto find the truth if possible.\n\nThe Sanada family we=\r\nre also part of a ninja group around this period of time \nwith a mixture of=\r\n ninja&#39;s from Iga, Koga and even other schools.\nI was told that they were k=\r\nnown as, &quot;The 10 ninja brave&quot; but does anyone \nknow of any tasks they compl=\r\neted and any of their names and did Takeda \nShingen know of them and their =\r\nuse.\n\nThankyou for any information,\n\n______________________________________=\r\n___________________________\nJoin the world=92s largest e-mail service with =\r\nMSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samur=\r\nai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamur=\r\naihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
