Do you mean Takeda\n&gt; &gt; Katsuyori? Getting the name wrong is probably 99%\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; your problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe he means Takeda Nobukado from the sounds\n&gt; of things. I&#39;ve\n&gt; always thought he died in 1582, though I don&#39;t\n&gt; remember where I read\n&gt; this.
