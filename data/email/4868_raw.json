We&#39;ve got one\npublished author that I know of, and a few others who\nhave academic credentials that can weigh in--is that\nwhat you&#39;re looking for? If you plan on using them for\na source, make sure whomever you use can establish\ntheir expertise--otherwise, you get a bunch of wannabe\nhacks (like me, I&#39;ll admit) answering your question,\nand you quoting them without knowing they aren&#39;t\nformally educated in the matter. Just want to make\nsure you&#39;re careful :)\n\n&gt; 1) how do accounts of bushido/samurai differ inside\n&gt; and outside \n&gt; Japan?\n\nOutside Japan, too many people only understand it from\neither movies and television, or from Hagakure, or\nfrom study of pre-WWII Japan, and think it&#39;s an\nall-encompassing lifestyle still followed today, or\nthey think it&#39;s a religion, or that all samurai were\nparagons of bushido. \n\nJapanese have a much better grasp of the reality, I\nthink--that it is a vague set of warrior ideals\ncreated throughout samurai history, codified in the\nEdo period by those who felt a need to explain the\nexistence of a warrior class with no wars to fight, \nthen coopted by the political elite to speed the\nbuildup of military and industry to catch up and\nsurpass the West. While it&#39;s by no means completely\nirrelevant to modern Japan, it&#39;s not any more invoked\nby Japanese than any Western virtues are invoked by\nEuropeans or Americans. \n\n&gt; 2) Where do public conceptions of bushido originate\n&gt; (i.e., How do \n&gt; most people learn about bushido?), and is this\n&gt; different for Japan \n&gt; and the West?\n\nThe West: Movies, anime, and reading bad Cleary\ntranslations. Seriously, part of it is because the\nimage is more interesting than the reality--so the\nimage gets perpetuated, and the reality gets\nforgotten. \n\nJapan: History class? Of course it&#39;s much more\nprevalent in their pop culture, but there&#39;s a\nhistorical understanding of it that tempers it a bit. \n\n&gt; 3) How has the useage/meaning of the terms bushido\n&gt; and samurai \n&gt; changed over the years since Nitobe Inazo\n&gt; popularized them in 1900?  \n\nUm, well, both words existed before 1900. Samurai\nceased to exist about 25 years before 1900, so I&#39;d\nhardly say the word was popularized then. In the West,\nI&#39;d say, Bushido is either mentioned in the context of\nthe &quot;wonderful&quot; martial virtues of the Samurai, or the\nsame &quot;horrific&quot; values of the WWII era Japanese\nmilitary. \n\n&gt; 4) Why do samurai retain such a hold on the popular\n&gt; imagination?\n\nBecause they&#39;re freaking cool! As we&#39;ve discussed on\nthe Archives board before, just about everyone has a\ndifferent reason they are interested in the\nsubject...some because they collect swords, others\nbecause they are history buffs, some because they read\na certain book or movie (if you took a poll, about 40%\nwould say &quot;Shogun&quot;, in book or movie format, was the\nkey for them), etc. \n\nBut to attempt to really answer the question, for much\nthe same reason that gunfighters of the Old West or\nknights in shining armor do--because the ideal image\nof a brave warrior fighting for &quot;right&quot; against the\nodds is a common human ideal archetype. \n\nInteresting questions!\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!\nhttp://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/\n\n"
