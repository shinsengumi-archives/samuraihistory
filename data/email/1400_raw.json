Oda Nobunaga had at least -- at LEAST -- two sisters.  (My \nguess is that there were more.)  One was Oichi-no-kata, married to Shibata \nKatsuie (twice) and Asai Nagamasa.  The other was married to Takeda \nKatsuyori.  Does anybody know what HER name was?  If she had one?  As I said, \njust wondering.  I&#39;ve never seen a name or lifedates for her, only that her \nhusband died with the last of his clan at the hands of her brother and his \narmies.  Or was she another of the unnamed women who were tragically used \nsolely for strategic purposes?  Thanks again!  (-:\n\nLater,\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
