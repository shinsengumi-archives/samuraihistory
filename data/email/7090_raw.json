Traditional Ninja were supposedly SECRET agents and HIDDEN assassins. \nThat means we don&#39;t know much about the real thing, it was all secret.\n2. Since there were no open and aboveboard schools, there is no way to \nprove descent from a real school.\n3. Ninja = money, either for Hollywood or for martial arts schools. \nMotive for fraud.\n4. I can&#39;t imagine a group of assassins allowing people to spread their \nREAL information freely, so the group is either dead or non-existent.\n5. The burden of proof is not on us, it&#39;s on the so-called Ninja masters \nwho have never presented sufficient proof any anything. When I was much \nyounger I looked at some of that, I don&#39;t need to hurt my eyes anymore.\n\nOf course these questions are all screening questions for the REAL NINJA \nSCHOOL tm. If you want to join please send $50,000 to 1600 Pennsylvania \nAve, Washington DC. Mark it National Debt Reduction.\n\nWe will know why it was sent, we are ninja after all.\n\nLegal Disclaimer:\nP.S. This is a joke.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
