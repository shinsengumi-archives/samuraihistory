While he is not associated with any \ngreat University, his \n&gt; work seems to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is not an amazing \nwriter ( imean; his \n&gt; style), but he seems to be truly in love with the subject, and I \nreally like the way he \n&gt; fills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind of (perhaps?) \nself-made scholarship \n&gt; is available.\n&gt; Since this is the first time I write, I was wondering what \nyou &quot;samurai-maniacs&quot; public \n&gt; think of Turnbull in general.\n&gt; Any book you would suggest in particular?\n&gt; Thanx,\n&gt; cepo\n\n\n"
