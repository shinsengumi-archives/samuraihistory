Someone else did, not me. \n\nWhat I was saying is that statements about facing death are a lot more\nmeaningful when coming from someone who has the experience of actually\nfacing imminent death in battle or facing an enemy. Of course we all will\ndie eventually. \n\nI just happen to think that Yamamoto&#39;s statements in &quot;Hagakure&quot; about how\n&quot;death is the way of the warrior&quot; and his writings about how too many\nsamurai &quot;act like women&quot; and his criticisms of the 47 Ako ronin were not\nvery meaningful in light of the fact that he had never faced an\nimminent-death situation.\n\nHere is a meaningful statement about facing death, written by Oishi\nKuranosuke and his colleagues in 1702. I found the statement within the\nfollowing link:\n\nhttp://www.blackmask.com/thatway/books162c/taja.htm#1_0_3\n\n   The 15th year of Genroku, the 12th month, and 15th day. We \n   have come this day to do homage here, forty-seven men in all, \n   from Oishi Kuranosuke down to the foot-soldier, Terasaka \n   Kichiyemon, all cheerfully about to lay down our lives on your \n   behalf. We reverently announce this to the honoured spirit of \n   our dead master. On the 14th day of the third month of last \n   year our honoured master was pleased to attack Kira Kotsuke no \n   Suke, for what reason we know not. Our honoured master put an \n   end to his own life, but Kira Kotsuke no Suke lived. Although \n   we fear that after the decree issued by the Government this \n   plot of ours will be displeasing to our honoured master, still \n   we, who have eaten of your food, could not without blushing \n   repeat the verse, &#39;Thou shalt not live under the same heaven \n   nor tread the same earth with the enemy of thy father or lord,&#39; \n   nor could we have dared to leave hell and present ourselves \n   before you in paradise, unless we had carried out the vengeance \n   which you began. Every day that we waited seemed as three \n   autumns to us. Verily, we have trodden the snow for one day, \n   nay, for two days, and have tasted food but once. The old and \n   decrepit, the sick and ailing, have come forth gladly to lay \n   down their lives. Men might laugh at us, as at grasshoppers \n   trusting in the strength of their arms, and thus shame our \n   honoured lord; but we could not halt in our deed of vengeance. \n   Having taken counsel together last night, we have escorted my \n   Lord Kotsuke no Suke hither to your tomb. This dirk,[7] by \n   which our honoured lord set great store last year, and \n   entrusted to our care, we now bring back. If your noble spirit \n   be now present before this tomb, we pray you, as a sign, to \n   take the dirk, and, striking the head of your enemy with it a \n   second time, to dispel your hatred for ever. This is the \n   respectful statement of forty-seven men.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of james wilson\nSent: Thursday, October 06, 2005 8:22 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: hitokiri kawakami gensai?\n\nYes you are correct but what is empty psuedo-philosophical platitude though.\n \nLove, Grace, and Peace\n\n&quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\nHello, Mr. James\n\nIn some ways, yes. But facing death from a comfortable castle  -- which is\nwhere Yamamoto was situated when he wrote &quot;Hagakure&quot; is not the same as\nfacing death under direct attack, such as in a battle against an enemy who\nis using swords, spears, guns, other weapons against you. Or facing death\nwhen your castle has been confiscated, your lord has died via seppuku at the\nShogun&#39;s order, and you are on the outside without clan or master -- and it\nis your duty to avenge him.  \n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of james wilson\nSent: Thursday, October 06, 2005 11:14 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: hitokiri kawakami gensai?\n\nHello Ms. Nina but isnt everyday to live is to face death?

There would be plenty of\nargument\n&gt; here over the issue of what makes a &quot;good&quot; samurai. Is it skill in\nweaponry?\n&gt; Is it courage? Is it loyalty? Is it general character? \n&gt; \n&gt; Nina Boal\n\nAs long as it doesn&#39;t involve &quot;who followed Bushido the best&quot;...\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAaaah, don&#39;t get me started on &quot;bushido.&quot; I may raise a few hackles with the\nfollowing, but one of my pet, pet peeves is someone quoting from &quot;Hagakure&quot;\nby Yamamoto Tsunetomo as if this were THE definitive manual on &quot;bushido.&quot; I\nkeep hearing people quote from this work, especially the famous line, &quot;the\nway of the samurai is facing death.&quot;\n\nIn the first place, Yamamoto wrote this treatise as a private correspondence\nto members of his clan. It never was intended to be read by the general\npublic in feudal Japan, much less by people all over the world in many\nlanguages.\n\nBut more importantly, in my humble(?) opinion, Yamamoto had never been in a\nbattle and thus knew nothing first-hand about facing death. He lived in a\npeaceful castle during the 18th centurey, some of the most peaceful times in\nJapanese history. It&#39;s not that difficult to write stuff about how a samurai\nshould face death when ensconced in a place where facing death doesn&#39;t come\ninto the equation of one&#39;s existence at all.  \n\nIf anyone wants to know about facing death, read some of the accounts by the\n47 Asano retainers who avenged their lord (whom Yamamoto had the temerity to\ncriticize from his own relatively comfortable spot). Or else read any\naccount from any common battlefield soldier in history, one from Japan or\nfrom any other country.\n\nNina\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com Samurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS\nJapanese translation Japanese incense Japanese print Japanese business\nJapanese yen Samurai swords \n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
