Generally, military engineers\ndug tunnels, or &quot;mines&quot; underneath enemy\nfortificattions, filled them with explosives, and blew\nthem up, with the intent of breaching walls, etc.\nExplosives with proximity fuses or trip wires, set in\nthe ground, to destroy moving enemy troops or vehicles\nlike we see today did not make a common appearance\nuntil WWI, as far as I know. \n\nDoesn&#39;t exactly answer your question, but that&#39;s the\nbest I&#39;ve got.\n\nregards,\n\nNate Ledbetter\n\n---\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
