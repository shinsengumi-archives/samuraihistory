They are making mistakes, they are struggling (not in a \nmartial way), they have their bad sides and good sides and thus are \ntruly interesting. Their doubts make them real.\nThe way Mizoguchi uses female characters in his movies is also very \ninteresting.\n\nI do think they are real masterpieces, but anybody about to watch them \nshould be aware they are not some kind of  samurai or fighter \nworshipping-movie.\n\nJerome\n\n&gt; I think list members would enjoy them both.\n&gt;\n&gt;In many ways the Kurosawa films are very Western, most of them have a \n&gt;happy ending, or it was intended as a tragedy. Mizoguchi and the other \n&gt;directors are more mainstream, their films at best are usually bittersweet.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jim Eckman\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________________________ \nAppel audio GRATUIT partout dans le monde avec le nouveau Yahoo!
