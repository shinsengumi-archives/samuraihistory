I just could never keep up before! Anyway, I had the sere=\r\nndipitous occurrence this morning of randomly picking up a book as I was se=\r\narching for my lost checkbook (happens a lot), and I opened said book (Wome=\r\nn of the Mito Domain by Yamakawa Kikue) to the index area and there before =\r\nme is the technical equivalence of a koku: it is 5.1 bushels or 180 liters =\r\nof rice. \n\nUpon checking the index of this work (which was my initial inten=\r\ntion anyway), I found a passage concerning the &quot;real&quot; value of koku grants:=\r\n\n\nfrom page 150, a quote internally from An Oral Record of Mito History, pu=\r\nb. by Takase Shinkyo in the early 1900&#39;s:\n\n&quot;According to what an old man to=\r\nld me when I was fourteen or fifteen about bushi income, a family with a st=\r\nipend of less than 100 koku could just make do if the household was limited=\r\n to the man, his wife, and his parents. If, in addition, there were two or =\r\nthree children, they could not make ends meet unless the couple engaged in =\r\nside jobs. Without such additional income, they would go deeper and deeper =\r\nin debt. To lead a decent life, a samurai, the old man said, had to have a =\r\nstipend of at least 300 koku. Asking further about this, I learned that unt=\r\nil the time of Lords Harumori and Harutoshi (reigned 1766-1805 and 1805-16,=\r\n respectively), a retainer with a stipend of 100 koku received as his actua=\r\nl income 72 bales of unhulled rice. This rate for stipends paid from the do=\r\nmain storehouses was better than that obtained by fief holders who collecte=\r\nd their income directly from the peasants working their holdings. During th=\r\ne time of Lord Nariaki however, the\n domain withheld 4 bales under the pret=\r\next of &quot;borrowing back,&quot; leaving the retainer with 68 bales. This &quot;borrowin=\r\ng back&quot; was not limited to just one year but continued for three or even=C2=\r\n=A0 five years at a time. Thus the sale of the actual amount of rice receiv=\r\ned from a stipend of 100 koku would not bring even twenty ryo. ...And out o=\r\nf this one had to pay the domain a military levy of one-half ryo for every =\r\n100 koku of one&#39;s stipend. Although at the time prices were very low, a bus=\r\nhi had to keep up a certain lifestyle and couldn&#39;t neglect training in the =\r\ncivil and martial arts. What with these pressures on his budget he had diff=\r\niculties making ends meet.&quot;\n\nI also remember reading about the pitiful trav=\r\nails of the Tosa retainer Tani Tannai, as he wrangled with his merchant mon=\r\neylender in an attempt to pay down his debt. Somehow, the debt kept getting=\r\n larger. This chronicle appears in Constantine Vaporis&#39; excellent Tour of D=\r\nuty book. I felt sorry for poor old Tani, as he really had no clue about bu=\r\ndgeting. One need only look at how Tani spent money to realize the irony of=\r\n the term &quot;samurai economics.&quot; \n\nCheers to all!\n\nOnnamusha\n\n--- On Fri, 12/=\r\n25/09, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;l=\r\ntdomer98@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku\nTo: samuraihistory@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, December 25, 2009, 1:37 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  =\r\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      The key phrase is &quot;at the time&quot;--it varied wild=\r\nly from period to period and even place to place within that period. If you=\r\n&#39;re more specific with time I can help you further, but to quickly give you=\r\n the simple answer:\n\n\n\n1. If someone was hired at 1500 koku (a koku wasn&#39;t =\r\na bushel, by the way, but the amount generally calculated to feed 1 man for=\r\n 1 year--can&#39;t pull the estimated bushel total out of my wheelhouse at the =\r\nmoment, and my resources aren&#39;t close at hand), then he was hired at 1500 k=\r\noku. You can&#39;t calculate the dollar amount without knowing a VERY specific =\r\ntime, because rice prices changed so often, and even then you&#39;re calculatin=\r\ng into contemporary currency, not today&#39;s figures. \n\n\n\n2. Generally speakin=\r\ng if the kokudaka system was used, the retainer was paid in rice. During th=\r\ne mid to late-1500s many daimyo instituted the kandaka system, where taxes =\r\nwere collected in kan (coin) and it was the taxpayer&#39;s responsibility to co=\r\nnvert their produce (not just rice, but whatever they had) into coin. Under=\r\n that system, a retainer would have been paid in coin. Hideyoshi and then I=\r\neyasu reverted back to a koku of rice being the standardized taxation unit,=\r\n and therefore what retainers were paid in. \n\n\n\n3. Lump sum, yes. This is w=\r\nhy you hear so many tales of the women of the house having to shave their h=\r\neads and sell their hair, or do other things to make ends meet--call it poo=\r\nr budgeting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-      \n\n\n    \n            \n\n                         =\r\n \n                        Going Green: Your Yahoo!
