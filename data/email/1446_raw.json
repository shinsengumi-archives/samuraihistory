Basically, and breifly it is a fairly recent samurai \n&gt; movie that is in part based on the struggles between Takeda \n&gt; Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin.  I taped it, and really enjoy it.  I \nam \n&gt; now looking for it on DVD, but cannot find it under Heaven and \n&gt; Earth, all I get is the Oliver Stone one.  I remeber a while back \non \n&gt; here someone metioning it by a different title.  If anyone knows \nit \n&gt; please help.  Thanks\n\n\n\n"
