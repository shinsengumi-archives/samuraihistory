It seems consistent\nwith what I&#39;ve read in Bottomley & Hopson, which I\nprefer as my source for info about weapons. The only\npart I have a major issue with is:\n\n&quot;The original warfare of the Bushi was not a thing for\n&#39;commoners&#39;; it was a ritualized combat usually\nbetween two warriors who would challenge each other\nvia horseback archery and sword duels. However the\ninvasions of Mongols in 1274 and 1281 changed Japanese\nwarfare and weaponry.&quot;\n\nThis is a pretty simplistic view of things, and the\nstatement about warfare not being a thing for\n&quot;commoners&quot; is a fallacy. &quot;Commoners&quot; simply aren&#39;t\nmentioned in the chronicles and histories, because who\nwants to read about Kichibei the grunt? Certainly no\none who wrote or read said chronicles. Footsoldiers\ncertainly did exist, and carried a variety of\npolearms--notably before the mid-1400&#39;s they carried\nthe naginata. It&#39;s true that warfare changed after the\nMongol invasions, but it&#39;s not like in 1281 they\nchallenged each other to archery duels, and January\n1st 1282 all of a sudden they started using yari. \n\nI highly recommend finding a copy of &quot;Arms and Armour\nof the Samurai&quot; by Ian Bottomley and Anthony P.\nHopson, who I mentioned above. It&#39;s a bit of a coffee\ntable book, but it does give a great outline of the\ndevelopment and timeline of Japanese weapons, and\nwould tell you likely all you want to know about yari. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
