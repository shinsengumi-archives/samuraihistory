Though based strongly\non events of history (and I myself use it a lot to remind myself of events\nthat I&#39;ve read about extensively elsewhere), it is still *fiction*, and as\nthus it presents a very idealized version of Hideyoshi and those involved in\nhis cause. You may notice upon completing the novel that it ends after\nHideyoshi negotiates peace with Ieyasu, thus leaving out later events such\nas Hideyoshi&#39;s two disasterous attempts at invading Korea, his obsessive and\neven irrational affection for his heir Hideyori, and his condemnation of the\nfamous tea master Sen no Rikyu, among other things.\n\nThis is no criticism of &quot;Taiko&quot;, though. I absolutely love the book, it&#39;s\none of my favorite reads of all time! But take it for what it is... an\nenjoyable novel based on, but not necessarily accurately representing, the\nfacts.\n\nSally\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Eponymous13@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, November 17, 2002 11:42 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] How the Samurai effected society\n\n\n&gt; I know it&#39;s a novel, but you may want to try to get a hold of a copy of a\n&gt; book called &quot;Taiko&quot; by Eiji Yoshikawa.  The copy I have is from the\n&gt; University of Massachusetts Library and it&#39;s about 30 years old, so it may\nbe\n&gt; rather difficult to come by.  From what little I&#39;ve perused it, it was\ngood\n&gt; -- good reading and good in terms of background info -- and may offer some\n&gt; ground-level insight to how (some) people lived during that time period,\nbut\n&gt; I haven&#39;t read it all, even though I intend to at some point real soon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Later.\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
