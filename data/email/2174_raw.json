Or is it a mire of a story like I found Tale of the Heike to be?\n&gt; Just wondering, b/c I&#39;m thinking of reading it.  (And yes, I am planning to\n&gt; give Tale another honest try someday, just not right now.)\n&gt;\n\nIt depends on what you consider to be &quot;fiction.&quot;\n\nTo me, it fails greatly in the historical accuracy, historical verisimilitude, and linguistic accuracy (etc.) tests.\nTo some people, that&#39;s not a problem.\n\nLet me give you an example. In the current issue of Hitchcock Magazine, there&#39;s a &quot;Heian period&quot; murder mystery. It&#39;s\nset in the eleventh century. Except I recognize the Japanese story used as the basis for it -- a story that took\nplace a century later (because there was a war that figured in the background, and one of the characters is\nhistorical). I also recognized that the author made some anachronisms with names (using a very late period name for a\nwoman character in the story). I was also thrown off because of mentions of cotton clothing and candles, neither of\nwhich existed in Japan during the  Heian period. So.... is that a good story? To some, yes. To me, no. There was too\nmuch wrong with it that kept throwing me *out* of the story.\n\nLike some people stop reading detective fiction where someone puts a silencer on a revolver. Or removes &quot;the clip&quot;\nfrom a revolver. Both of which I see often -- it means the writer really doesn&#39;t know guns, and hasn&#39;t done the\nresearch -- it makes me wonder what else might be wrong that I *don&#39;t* know about.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
