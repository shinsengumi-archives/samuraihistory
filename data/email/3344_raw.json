Don&#39;t apologize for your English. You write English better\nthan most native English\n&gt; speakers (I&#39;m an american)\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry I can&#39;t help you with your sword question...\n&gt; &gt; Dear members of the list,\n&gt; &gt; please excuse my bad english. As you will see it is not my native\nlanguage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am new to your group and I would like to ask for your support on the\nfollowing\n&gt; &gt; matter.\n&gt; &gt; The other day I had a discussion on the rules and restrictions the\nsamurai faced\n&gt; &gt; in daily life concerning the use of swords. The guy I was talking to\ninsisted on\n&gt; &gt; the idea, that they were forbidden by law to draw their swords, unless\ntold to\n&gt; &gt; by their superiors.\n&gt; &gt; My point was that there were only resctrictions to the drawing of swords\non\n&gt; &gt; certain occasions like being at the shoguns palace or in the court. I\nguess\n&gt; &gt; there are many more times when it was forbidden but those are the points\nthat\n&gt; &gt; instantly came to my mind. I think that apart from that, there were no\nlaws that\n&gt; &gt; restricted the drawing or the use of the sword. One example here would\nbe\n&gt; &gt; kirisute gomen.\n&gt; &gt; My request to the members of this list would be to name any kind of\nsource that\n&gt; &gt; proves my point as I donï¿½t want to rely only on one or two sources I\nhave at\n&gt; &gt; hand right now. I can use english, german, french or japanese texts.\nEspecially\n&gt; &gt; original sources or their modern day transcriptions would be great (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; osadamegaki, buke shohatto). Any help will be appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; Thank you very much for your time\n&gt; &gt; Karsten Helmholz\n&gt; &gt; Germany\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
