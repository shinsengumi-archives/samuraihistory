I&#39;ve read a lot of \ndifferent stuff about ninja. Although if you think about it a shorter \nsword would be lighter to carry. I read somewhere (don&#39;t know if its \ntrue or not) that ninja would carry a short sword with a longer saya. \nNinja would fill the bottom of the saya with blinding powders or \nsomethings like that. Or the bottom of the saya could detach and be \nused as a snorkel. Again I say I do not know if that is fact or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
