Bryant&#39;s books\n&gt;Date: Thu, 21 Feb 2002 20:54:55 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;Not to attack the sacred cow, but Turnbull can definately not be accused of \n&gt;being an acedemic, or a &#39;true&#39; historian.  Many of his books are filled \n&gt;with small errors and innaccuracies that he very obviously took verbatim \n&gt;from Papinot - although he NEVER mentions Papinot in his sources...  \n&gt;Looking at his books, his information, and his sources together, one has to \n&gt;wonder if he can even read Japanese at all...\n&gt;\n&gt;*ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of Inabayama \n&gt;took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in Japanese, \n&gt;including a few he lists in his bibliography state it happened in 1567.  So \n&gt;you may be thinking, &#39;what&#39;s two or three years?&#39;  Well, what if I told you \n&gt;the battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!\n&gt;\n&gt;You could write a treatise on just the errors and uncited Papinot sources \n&gt;alone.  Not to mention a picture listed as an &#39;authors representation&#39; of \n&gt;something that actually looks suspiciously like a tracing of a picture in a \n&gt;Rekishi gunzo book. (Dont have his book or the Gunzo book on hand right now \n&gt;to cite which one)\n&gt;Guess because he&#39;s the only game in town he thinks he doesn&#39;t have to work \n&gt;at it anymore...?  I&#39;ve seen him mentioned as Stephen &quot;buy my books&quot; \n&gt;Turnbull in some post before, and I can see why.  Just take a look at his \n&gt;website.  You can&#39;t help but get the impression scholarship takes a \n&gt;definate backseat to profit.  guess I can&#39;t really blame the guy, though.  \n&gt;Gotta put food on the table somehow.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, I&#39;d rather read &#39;dry&#39; histories if they are more accurate than \n&gt;&#39;popular&#39; histories, although I&#39;d prefer to read an accurate popular \n&gt;history! (like A.J. Bryant&#39;s stuff!  At least you get the impression that \n&gt;he has a real interest in the subject, and can actually read japanese, and \n&gt;actually puts in the research!)\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh well, just a rant on my part, and I could very well be totally wrong.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\nMarshMan6423 is writing to u!!\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\n\n\n"
