Masaaki\nHatsumi is in the film and this is sufficient for me. \n Each one is free to administer its knowledge as want.\n \n \nOr �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by the\nBudo Taijutsu?  Hayes will be wrong in his vision, \nbut by him many people knew to Sensei and they went to\nJapon to study true Budo.  Malstrolm as example.\n \nHow important is Hayes for the Bujinkan?  The people\nwho train in the Bujinkan, do that - I think- from\nheart not because they have a shorter curved saber, it\ndoes not matter it of form but it of fund.  \n \nIn my country we have a thought: &quot;when the words are\nnot better than the silence, is better to silence&quot;.  I\nrecommend you see the film and train dogs, not martial\narts. Not with a heart closed.\n \nHelly\n\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; escribi�:\n\n--- ahelly69 &lt;ahelly69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This proyect was made by Mr. Brandon Alvarez and is\n&gt; based in a deep \n&gt; research and interviews with real ninja masters like\n&gt; Dr. Masaaki \n&gt; Hatsumi, Stephen K.

Hayes&quot; in the\nsame sentence doesn&#39;t raise flags with ANYONE else? \n\nSo, I&#39;m assuming we&#39;re talking about straight sword\nnonsense and idiots running around in black pajamas,\naren&#39;t we? I think I&#39;ll stick to watching Owl&#39;s\nCastle--at least it admits to being fictional. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
