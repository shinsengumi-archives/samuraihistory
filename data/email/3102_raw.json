I plan on him being there\nfrom 1840 till roughly 1854. &quot;\n\nHave you ever heard of Ranald MacDonald? He was an American/Canadian/native\nAmerican who came to Japan in the 1840&#39;s. Somehow he managed to traverse\nJapan from north to south winding up in Nagasaki. There is a new book on\nhim. I can&#39;t recall the author or title of hand. What I read about him from\nother books his adventures sound quite interesting.\n\nThere was also a British doctor who lived in Okinawa for some time prior to\n1853. His name was Bernard Bettlehiem. You can find his story as well as\nMacDonalds in &quot;Yankees in the Land of Gods&quot; by Peter Booth Wiley.\n\n1) arrive in the country and not be immediately executed\n\nAs far as I recall no intruders into 19th (pre 1853) Japan were executed.\nMost were incarcerated and later repatriated through Nagasaki.\n\n2) endear himself to someone who would teach him the ways of the\nsamurai\n\nDoubt it. Most of the people that befriended the two mentioned above were\npeasants and fisherman. Besides at this time many &quot;samurai&quot; were starting to\nquestion the need for the samurai class and the so-called ways of the\nsamurai. Read Toward Restoration by Harry Harootunian and The Western World\nand Japan by George Sansom.\n\n3) Perhaps be involved in the battle of battle of Tonegawa (1844)\n\nWell if its a work of fiction why not. However any such act by a foreigner\nin Japan at that time would be considered very serious.\n\n4) perhaps meet Tokugawa Iesada\n\nMost unlikely. By this time the Shogun lived a fairly secluded life in Edo\ncastle. permission to see him was limited to a few senior advisors.\n\n\n\n"
