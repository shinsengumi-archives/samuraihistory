Shinchogumi was also \nderived from the \n&gt; Roshitai, just like the Shinsengumi, but the Shinsengumi \nmembers \n&gt; stayed in Kyoto while the Shinchogumi ones retreated back to \nEdo.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe you have already got this book, but if not perhaps you \ncan \n&gt; give a look at &quot;Samurai Sketches&quot;, by Romulus Hillsborough. It \nis a \n&gt; bit novelized, but still a very interesting depiction (and very well \n&gt; researched) of some Shinsengumi members, including Isami \nKondo and \n&gt; Kamo Serizawa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that helped...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new. Hope I&#39;m in the right place to ask this. I&#39;m \nresearching \n&gt; &gt; key figures of the Shinsengumi, particularly Isami Kondo and \n&gt; &gt; Kamo Serizawa. They were of course members of the \n&gt; &gt; Shinsengumi, but I&#39;ve also run accross something called the \n&gt; &gt; Shinchogumi. It that the same thing? If not, what is it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any help much appreciated,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; St. John Lord Merridewe\n\n\n\n"
