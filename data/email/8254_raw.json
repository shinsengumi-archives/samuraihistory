I like the the fact that even though there in the higher class (depending on the time period), that they will always lend a helping hand. They honestly fascinate me to! For instance, (I dont know if youve read Hakaure:The Book of the Samurai,you should check it out) but the loyalty the retainers have for there master is absolutly incomprehensible! Seppuku if the master does not like something, the master dies (I think its called something other than Seppuku), or if the retainer has done something wrong. Theres many other aspects of the samurai that i greatly admire and love. But thats for another time. I hope this answers youre question!
