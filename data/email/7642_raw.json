Benning Wentworth, as a leadi=\r\nng member of early Portsmouth high \nsociety, no doubt exulted in the luxuri=\r\nous 52-room splendor of his \nsprawling mansion perched on Portsmouth&#39;s Litt=\r\nle Harbor in the 18th \ncentury. \n\nMeanwhile, a world away in Japan, the pop=\r\nulace were in the midst of \na new, pleasure-driven Edo period (1598 =BF 185=\r\n4), sparked by the rule \nof a new Shogun who closed the borders of the here=\r\ntofore war-ravaged \nnation that soon became prosperous and peaceful.\n\nTying=\r\n these two far-flung, 18th century societies together =97 the new \ncolony i=\r\nn New Hampshire and the ancient one in Asia, came swiftly to \nDody Kolb, th=\r\ne director of the Coolidge Center for the Arts, located \nsteps away from Be=\r\nnning&#39;s homestead, now called the Wentworth-\nCoolidge mansion.\n\n&quot;I thought =\r\nabout the Portsmouth Peace Treaty and then quickly linked \nthat to the peac=\r\neful era of Japan that unfolded during the time Gov. \nWentworth lived here,=\r\n&quot; recalled the North Hampton art historian, \ncollector and curator. &quot;I thou=\r\nght of peace evolving across the \nwaters; the 1905 peace treaty itself here=\r\n in Portsmouth and the \npeace that took hold of a warrior nation. As the pr=\r\nints were \nevolving in Japan from the 1600 to 1800s, the Wentworth mansion =\r\nwent \nup here. It seemed a good fit; the show is about peace and what \npeop=\r\nle do in a time of peace.&quot;\n\nThe result of Kolb&#39;s brainstorm is an ambitious=\r\n exhibit of 50 to 60 \nprints rendered by as many as 20 artists called &quot;Peac=\r\ne and the \nPursuit of Pleasure&quot; which opens Sunday, August 21 through Septe=\r\nmber \n5. Additionally, Kolb has added several informational panels to \nsupp=\r\nlement the prints. These panels will inform viewers about \nprintmaking tech=\r\nniques of the period and specific artists \nrepresented in the exhibit.\n\nSur=\r\nviving artifacts of this age in the form of Japanese woodblock \nprints =BF =\r\ncalled Ukiyo-e =97 depict figures such as sumo wrestlers, \nkabuki actors an=\r\nd courtesans, surface as rare and distinct \nexpressions of art &quot;showing the=\r\n many pleasures enjoyed by this \nsociety during the 18th and 19th centuries=\r\n, a time of peace.&quot; \n\nCreated through the &quot;concerted effort of artist, wood=\r\nblock carver, \nprinter and publisher,&quot; said Kolb, &quot;these prints reflect a f=\r\nleeting \nworld when the emerging middle class pursued harmonious and festiv=\r\ne \nactivities.&quot; During this peaceful period of time, samurai were still \nth=\r\ne prevailing class, though merchants suddenly came into view as \nthe leadin=\r\ng edge in a new wave of middle class professions.\n\nHow Kolb came to know ab=\r\nout this particular era speaks to her long \nassociation with Japanese art. =\r\nThe daughter of English parents, Kolb \nstudied art history and painting at =\r\nthree colleges, including King&#39;s \nCollege in Cambridge. In the 1970s, she f=\r\nell in love with Edo period \nJapanese woodblock prints when her son, workin=\r\ng at the antiques show \nat Brimfield, spotted them in the adjacent booth.\n\n=\r\n&quot;I bought two prints at that time by famed artist, Ando Hiroshige \n(1707 =\r\n=BF 1858). This immediately opened my eyes to this wondrous \nworld. I was e=\r\nnthralled with the colors, forms and images of \nanother, more exotic life. =\r\nEventually, I researched the UNH \ncollection of Japanese prints in the mid-=\r\n1980s as they have a \nfabulous collection with a strong theatre or kabuki c=\r\nomponent.&quot;\n\nA whopping 80 percent of the Coolidge show is taken from Kolb&#39;s=\r\n own \ncollection of Edo prints; the remainder were loaned by collectors \nsh=\r\ne met over the decades. \n\nThe avid collector has long been a presence in th=\r\ne Seacoast and \nstate, serving 10-year terms on the UNH Art Gallery Board o=\r\nf \nAdvisors and on the Advisory Council for the Currier Museum of Art \nin M=\r\nanchester.\n\nSitting in her office at the Coolidge Center, Kolb enjoys a goo=\r\nd \nlaugh remembering her one month of retirement before taking the role \nas=\r\n director of the art gallery.\n\n&quot;I had worked for years as the art consultan=\r\nt to the Home Center and \nRye and had retired for 30 days,&quot; she reminisced.=\r\n &quot;Then four years \nago, Sumner Weinbaum came looking for me. This gallery h=\r\nad served as \nthe carriage house to the Wentworth mansion but when I arrive=\r\nd it \nsported a dirty, cement garage floor.&quot; The spacious gallery where \nKo=\r\nlb presides is home to several exhibits each year, featuring most \nprominen=\r\ntly the works of noted painters.\n\nExtolling the beauty of Ukiyo-e prints ma=\r\nde possible by Tokugawa \nShogun Iayasu, Kolb enthuses: &quot;These prints repres=\r\nent art made for \nmasses, art that was sold on street corners.&quot; She added t=\r\nhat when \nCommodore Perry arrived in Japan in 1854, after the ports had re-=\r\n\nopened, the unified style of the Edo period came to an end. &quot;Once he \narri=\r\nved, the prints and many other Japanese art forms \nwere &#39;discovered&#39; in the=\r\n West and so began the great exporting of \ngoods, changed often to suit wes=\r\ntern tastes.&quot; \n\nHer particular fondness for the works of Hiroshige are evid=\r\nent. &quot;I \nlike the quiet eye and the solace you find in his work. He reveals=\r\n \nan insightful, quiet nature in his prints while the others are much \nmore=\r\n ebullient.&quot; \n\nThis rare, 15-day showing of Edo prints at the Coolidge Cent=\r\ner for \nthe Arts, taken together with the display of lithographs (War and \n=\r\nPeace: Images from the Russo-Japanese War, 1904-05) at the \nPortsmouth Athe=\r\nnaeum and the Peace Show at the Levy Gallery, will \ngive art lovers a broad=\r\n spectrum of displays to ogle during the \nPeaceful Month of August, designa=\r\nted as such to honor the Treaty of \nPortsmouth, which ended the war between=\r\n Japan and Russia.&quot; \n\nKolb is following up the Japanese print exhibit with =\r\none \nentitled &quot;The Power of the Print&quot; which will display all formats in \np=\r\nrintmaking from block and etching to mixed media.\n\n\nThe Coolidge Center for=\r\n the Arts opens daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. \nand welcomes the public to at=\r\ntend, free of charge. There are guided \ntours of the displays on Wednesdays=\r\n at 1 p.m. and by appointment for \nlarge groups. The Coolidge Center for th=\r\ne Arts is located at 375 \nLittle Harbor Road in Portsmouth, 436-6607.\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"
