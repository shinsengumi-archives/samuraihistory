It is not a documentary and does not pretend to be one. It \ndoes not\n&gt;even pretend to be a fictionalization of a historical event such as Samurai \nBanners\n&gt;and Kagemusha are. That said, they serve the same sort of function as say The\n&gt;Patriot does for understanding the U.S. Revolutionary War. \n&gt;  \n\nYou have a great point here. I also saw (and really enjoyed) THE PATRIOT. On \none hand, it used a historical background. But it was a fictional account set \nagainst this historical background. I think that SEPPUKU had a similar format \nand intent. \n\n&gt;  Is it a historical source? By in large, no. Is it purely &quot;entertainment&quot;, \nI think that\n&gt;this is too harsh. Chanbara films are much more of the entertainment \nvariety, but\n&gt;even here the well made chanbara film, such as Yojimbo, can expose the \nnovice to\n&gt;the atmosphere of the periond in which it is set.\n&gt;  \n\nI think that films like SEPPUKU, SEVEN SAMURAI, and YOJIMBO raise issues \nrather than intending to be depictions of actual history. SEVEN SAMURAI raises the \nissue of class differences and YOJIMBO raises the issue of the ending of an \nera. \n\nIn my opinion, SEPPUKU raises more issues than the other two do. It&#39;s such a \nmulti-level film, which is why it is a masterpiece. Just in my opinion, and \nI&#39;m neither a crendentialed historian nor a film expert, but I believe that \nSEPPUKU outdoes either YOJIMBO and SEVEN SAMURAI. But all these films are \nmasterpieces.  \n\nFilms like these were not intended to be accounts of actual history. Instead, \nthey pose a &quot;jumping-off&quot; point for researching actual history.\n\nNina\n\n"
