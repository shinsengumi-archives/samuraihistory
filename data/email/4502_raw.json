All things that the Japanese shared. Actually few places in \nthe world were (and are) as homogeneous as Japan.\n\n&gt; So, he did exactly the same, including genocide against people who \n&gt; disagreed\n&gt; with him or hated religions... Just like Hitler...\n\nWait a minute, wait a minute... Do you have an idea of what the \nHolocaust was? Hitler killed 5.7 million people simply because they \nbelonged to a race, or because he considered them inferiors. They were \nnot people on his path, he sent out over half of Europe his Gestapo and \nspecial extermination squads to get them, and to murder them. Hitler&#39;s \n&quot;final solution,&quot; the ultimate decision of killing ALL Jewish, is \nsomething you can not compare with Nobunaga&#39;s will to unify Japan at \nall costs. Nobunaga did not build concentration camps where thousands \nof people were killed every day after they were exploited as slaves.\nAnd besides that, Nobunaga was born in the middle of a civil war, while \nHitler started a World War... How can you compare them? Hitler lived \n400 years later than Nobunaga, in a different continent, and in a \ntotally different contest.\nSure, you can speculate that, given the chance, Nobunaga would have \ndone as bad as Hitler, but... ***speculate*** that&#39;s it.\nHistory is a different matter. IMHO.\ncepo\n\n\n"
