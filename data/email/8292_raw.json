Not sure, please anyone feel free to correct me.&quot;\n\nI think that&#39;s about=\r\n right. &#39;Samurai&#39; status covered the richest to\nthe poorest, and many samur=\r\nai were dirt poor, working alongside their\nfarmers in the fields if they wa=\r\nnted to eat.\n\nStories of early Tokugawa (Matsudaira) retainers tell of samu=\r\nrai\nlining the rice field with sandals hung from the shafts of their\nspears=\r\n, and in one case a samurai covered himself in mud in the hope\nthat a 15-ye=\r\nar-old Ieyasu might not recognise him, and how low he had\nfallen.\n\nAnother =\r\nof the era tell of a samurai who lost his Takeda &#39;castle&#39; (not\nmuch more th=\r\nan a stockade) when the land fell to Tokugawa. The\nstructure was burned dow=\r\nn and he became an inn-keeper.\n\nOf the same era are stories of peasants ele=\r\nvated in status at the whim\nof the Shogun.\n\nThe situation grows even more c=\r\nomplex if you look at Shikoku after\nSekigahara, when it was ruled that samu=\r\nrai must be attached to the\ncastle, any farmer must therefore surrender his=\r\n samurai status. This\nwas a move to stop rebellion, by making the samurai a=\r\nbsolutely\ndependent upon the bakafu for their survival. It reintroduced the=\r\n\n&#39;goshi&#39; - a gentleman farmer who might well be richer than his samurai\nnei=\r\nghbour (and better skilled in the carriage of arms).\n\nIn fact the Shikoku g=\r\noshi was closer to the original samurai than his\nEdo counterpart, who becam=\r\ne more and more a time-serving bureaucrat,\nand one might say the mantle of =\r\nmost of what people think of as\nsamurai passed to him. Certainly the Tosa s=\r\nwordsmen (of whom Ryoma was\none) kept the classical arts of the warrior ver=\r\ny much alive and &#39;real&#39;\nas opposed to the artificiality that was creeping i=\r\nnto the\nprofessional Edo dojo. \n\n&quot;But definitely after Hideyoshi&#39;s &quot;sword-h=\r\nunt,&quot; a samurai was\ndefinitely born, not made.&quot;\nThat was the rule, but I th=\r\nink at the time it was hard to enforce -\nand of course was at the whim of w=\r\nhoever was in charge. Hideyoshi\nhimself &#39;elevated&#39; commoners to samurai - K=\r\nato Kiyomasa was the son of\na blacksmith. So did Ieyasu after him.\n\nCertain=\r\nly post-Edo it was the case.\n\nI think basically the rule was not made to pr=\r\notect or preserve samurai\nstatus, but as a means of social control and rest=\r\nraint.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n"
