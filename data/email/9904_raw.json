I=\r\n refer the members to Karl Marx, Communist Manifesto; Kieth Hopkins, Conque=\r\nr&#39;s and slaves; and Fredich Nietzche, On Competivism and Aggression for gen=\r\neral reading.\n\n \n\nSlaves did not simply become so because they were weak. S=\r\nome were brought, traded, became indebted to the state, and yes trophies of=\r\n war. The earliest slaves I can think of is the enslavement of Messina by t=\r\nhe Sparta in 8th century BC, but Homer talks about slaves in the Illiad whi=\r\nch could be talking about the 1300&#39;s bc. And slaves were not always barbari=\r\nans. The Greek slaves of the Ancient world were often tutors, doctors and s=\r\npecialists.\n \n\nAslo, rice an asian suppliment, not a European. The first se=\r\nttled people were in what was know as the Fertile Cresent, subsisting on Em=\r\nmer and Eincorn.\n\n \n\nTerrorism: the clue is in the title. One doesnt have t=\r\no be rich or poor. The idea is too terrorise the enemy. I refer you to the =\r\npirates attack on Rome in 70&#39;s bc; the Spanish during the Napoleonic war, t=\r\nhe Vietcong, and more recently the terrorists in Iraq, Afganistan and Pakis=\r\ntan.\n\n \n\nT.D\n\n\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nFrom: eddiehiramoto@yahoo=\r\n.co.jp\nDate: Fri, 1 May 2009 23:18:35 +0900\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] R=\r\ne: Parallels in US and Japanese history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as slaves are concern=\r\ned, this is the parallel not only in US and Japanese history, but in world =\r\nwide of human history since ancient world.\n\nUntil Humans invented so called=\r\n civilizational tools, or rice crop, they used to live under helping each o=\r\nther concept and equally.\n\nSince then, they formed strong powered people vs=\r\n weak people gradually, resulting in coming out slaves from weak people. \n\n=\r\nEven now, the rich people and poor people exist in world wide. The gap betw=\r\neen rich and poor has never been narrowed since occured in world wide. \nThi=\r\ns is the real cause of Terrorism by poorer side against richer side.\n\nNow ,=\r\n the fellow friends of this community must ask what you can do how to settl=\r\ning out this terrorism problem.\n\nEddie Hiramoto \n\nnohit@... wrote:\n\n\nAn=\r\nd another parallel: In the late 19th century, two different &quot;emancipation p=\r\nroclamations&quot; were made. In the U.S., this was Lincoln&#39;s proclamation to fr=\r\nee African-American slaves. In Japan, it was the Meiji government&#39;s proclam=\r\nation to end the feudal outcaste catagories of &quot;eta&quot; (extreme filth)\nand &quot;h=\r\ninin&quot; (non-human). In both cases, there was resistance by people against th=\r\nese groups (freed slaves in the U.S. and &quot;new commoners&quot; in Japan) that wou=\r\nnd up in attacks and lynchings as well as continued segregation and discrim=\r\nination. \n\nHmmm, maybe we&#39;re not so different after all. \n\nNina\n\n-----Origi=\r\nnal Message-----\nFrom: Steven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@...&gt;\nTo: sa=\r\nmuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wed, 29 Apr 2009 10:28 am\nSubject: RE: [=\r\nsamuraihistory] Re: Parallels in US and Japanese history\n\nOne sad similarit=\r\ny between US and Japanese history is the displacement and attempted genocid=\r\ne of the native people by the &quot;new government&quot;. I am of course drawing a pa=\r\nrallel between the policies and actions of the European settlers/US governm=\r\nent towards Native Americans and the Emishi/Ainu/etc....\n\nNot just in the l=\r\nand-grabbing and killing--- but we also saw many Emishi come to work for th=\r\ne new Emperor(s) --- just like some natives allied with the new US.\n\nWe als=\r\no see that the tactics brought in from the old country (Europe for US, Chin=\r\na for Japan) were no match against the guerilla tactics of the natives---an=\r\nd newer devices and strategies had to be made to fight them.\n\nAlso--the ide=\r\na that many Ainu hid their ethnic origins to avoid problems reminds me of m=\r\nany native families (that can) hiding their origins to avoid problems.\n\nAs =\r\nfar as I know though...there are not any &quot;Japanese reservations&quot;.. but both=\r\n groups still fight over &quot;indigenous rights&quot;...\n\nEtc.etc....\n\nHowever, I wo=\r\nuld say this pattern is common anytime a foreign invader comes in and &quot;colo=\r\nnizes&quot; an area..\n\nBut, still.. I would say that is applies. \n\nThoughts? \n\n[=\r\nNon-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n---------------------=\r\n------------\nPower up the Internet with Yahoo!
