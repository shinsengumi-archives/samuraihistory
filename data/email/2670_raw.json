I \nglanced at the history section while I was there and found a brand new book.  It&#39;s \ncalled &quot;The Last Samurai, The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori&quot;, by Mark \nRavina ($24.95 US).\n\nThe copyright is 2004.  Naturally, I bought it.  I was slightly disappointed \nto see that the Satsuma Rebellion is covered in only 10 pages in the last \nchapter, but I will collect anything in English written about this period.\n\nThe book also contains a 15 page bibliography, which I am looking forward to \nreading in great detail.\n\nI don&#39;t know if the author planned the book&#39;s release to coincide with the \nmovie of the same name, but if he did, he&#39;s brilliant.  If he didn&#39;t, then he&#39;s \nvery lucky.\n\n\nBob Burke\n\n"
