I don&#39;t \nthink anyone is &quot;pissed off&quot;.  Some people just feel the \nneed to correct perceived misinformation - some through \neducating, some more directly through less diplomatic \nmeans.  I tend to rely on the first method, but do enjoy \nthe second method as well.  And I think I have at least a \nsemi-valid point in my comparing a westerner saying &quot;I \nwant to be a Samurai&quot; to a Japanese person saying &quot;I want \nto be a Confederate&quot;....  I also do think that the \n&#39;lifestyle&#39; is great, but it isn&#39;t a &quot;Samurai&quot; lifestyle. \n If anything it is a Zen or Buddhist lifestyle; calling it \na &quot;Samurai lifestyle&quot; is a fallacy and a bit farcical.\nSome people don&#39;t realize how odd they sound until they \nare shown things from another perspective, so I like to \nthink I was facilitating that while only being marginally \ninsulting  ;-)\nGroups are for learning and debate - if one takes offense \nto everything said to them, they won&#39;t learn anything - \nthey will spend too much time getting hurt or angry.  If \nyou are going to post your convictions to a group - any \ngroup - you should be able to take the replies with a \ngrain of salt.  (sometimes a real big grain).  I welcome \nflame posts, it at least shows me where everyone else \nstands.\n_____________________________\nFor the best comics, toys, movies, and more,\nplease visit &lt;http://www.tfaw.com/?qt=wmf&gt;\n\n\n"
