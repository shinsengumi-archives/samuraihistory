Also, if Stephen Hayes\nis so poorly \n&gt; regarded, then I suspect that his &quot;Master&quot; Masaaki\nHatsumi is equally \n&gt; vilified.  I ask because I bought a Sojutsu DVD that\nwas made by him \n&gt; because there is very little material available on\nthat martial art \nin \n&gt; English.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you\n\nI picked it up in a bookshop, glanced at the numerous\npictures of black \npyjama clad warriors with throwing stars and put it\nback down again. \nAnd went home and took a shower.\n\nSeriously though, having briefly leafed through it, it\ndoes seem to \ncontradict itself in that it tries to debunk some of\nthe myths and ends \nup perpetuating those very same myths.\n\n\n\nHi\n\nconsidering 10 years ago Yurnbull wrote a bigger book\non the Ninja this one was a seriously pathetic attempt\nat just making money\n\nHe has taken comic book principles bits of hollywood\nand tried to pass it off as Ninja related material.\n\nI was shocked to see that he states that Ninja carried\nstraight bladed swords. He obviously has done no\nresearch whatsoever into anything regarding ninja\nweapons, and he definately has not had any timeon his\nhands to read forums etc. \nThe straight ninja sword was 100% debunked by members\nof the Ninjutsu training community 15 years ago, with\nthe source of that creation going back to Steve Hayes.\n\nI was given the book as a gift and I wish I could have\ngiven it back. \n\nI wouldnt waste my money on it\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n\n\n"
