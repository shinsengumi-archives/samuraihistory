Either allow such st=\r\nories, as long as the prequel/sequel can stand completely as an independent=\r\n story. Or else make a rule that a writer cannot write a story about any ch=\r\naracter who was in any of his/her previous years&#39; entries.\n\nGood point. Com=\r\nmon sense says it is fine as long as it is a complete short story on its ow=\r\nn, but since I didn&#39;t clarify that this time around (didn&#39;t even think abou=\r\nt it) it of course popped up.  I&#39;ll clarify it this next time, same charact=\r\ners - fine as long as it is a complete short story and doesn&#39;t read like a =\r\nchapter in a larger story.\n\n \n&gt; 2) You might want to allow a writer to ente=\r\nr more than one story,\nas long as each of an entrant&#39;s stories are in a dif=\r\nferent category.  \n\n\nIsn&#39;t that sort of like stuffing the balot box?  Altho=\r\nugh if I did \nallow this, I would also have to require a seperate fee for e=\r\nach \nstory, which might make it interesting, story wise and money wise.\n\n&gt; =\r\n3) I would make at least a suggestion that, as this is \nthe &quot;SAMURAI Fictio=\r\nn Contest&quot;, that the main character of any story \nactually be a samurai. Or=\r\n else, if the POV character isn&#39;t a \nsamurai, that the story centers on som=\r\ne sort of samurai character. I \nrealize that in earlier eras of Japanese hi=\r\nstory, that samurai \ndidn&#39;t exist as a distinct, separate class. So for the=\r\nse stories, it \nshould center on a person who would perform a role that a s=\r\namurai \nwould perform i.e. fight in battles or studies a martial art.\n\n\nTha=\r\nt is a tough one.  The first contest was very strict, and there \nwere good =\r\nresults. This one was less strict, and had a larger \nvariety. I&#39;ll have to =\r\nthink about this one, but I am taking it under \nadvisement. Technically spe=\r\naking, the &quot;historical fiction&quot; option \ncovered this. So I&#39;m drawn between =\r\nthe two - I don&#39;t want to \nactively discourage anyone from entering by maki=\r\nng it too strict, \nbut at the same time the more focused stories tend to be=\r\n more \ninterestng, because the people with the knowledge and interest are \n=\r\nthe ones who write them.\n\nThanks for the thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Arch=\r\nives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.ca=\r\nfeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
