I actually \nsaw the\n&gt; book in a book store and I peeked into it for a bit, and laughed \nat it.\n&gt; there is not one speck of real Ninpo in the entire book. now I \nread that he\n&gt; was found not guilty he hugged the woman that was suing him, and \nthen pulled\n&gt; down his pants and defecated on the floor on the way out of court \nsaying \n&gt; that is real ultimate power&quot; and vanished. Now I do not know if \nthat is true\n&gt; or not but it seems to be in news sites including CNN..\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt;  \n\n\nYou can get the book on amazon.com:\n\nReal Ultimate Power: The Official Ninja Book\nby Robert Hamburger \n$9.95  \n\n\nIt went into my &#39;wish list&#39; immediately.\n\n\n\n\n"
