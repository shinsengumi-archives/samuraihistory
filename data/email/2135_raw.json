Unfortunately the article is\nbased on myth and is very biased towards those who are\nhardcore Koryu. Most of the references made directly\nor indrirectly towards modern ninjutsu and the\nbujinkan have been dispelled.\n\nI personally would not use that article as a reference\n\npaul\n\n\n\n--- Scott &lt;scottc_4@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nI have been lurking durring this ninja discusion ans\nkept my mouth \nclosed about the subject but I decided to say\nsomethign about what \nthey wore.  9 times out of 10 an agent doing ninja\ntype assingments \nwould dress as a normal person.  Not only that they\nwould assume the \nentire identity with false papers and other items that\nwould be \nneeded to get through checkpoints, and other such\nthings, when there \nwas time to make them.  When a ninja would wear\nsomething similar to \nwhat we now consider a ninja uniform it was almost\nnever black.  The \npoint was to conceal oneself so moving through the\nforrest in the \ndaytime in a back outfit doesn&#39;t make sence.  Even at\nnight time they \nwould rarely wear black.  Unless it was a night of a\nnew moon or the \nclouds completely coverefd the moon jet balck clothes\nwould stand out \nif there was a little bit of light from the moon.  So\nusually for \nnight missons when the &quot;ninja uniform&quot; was worn it\nwork be a dark \ngray, dark blue, a darn brown, or other dark colors. \nOne more thing \nbut not about garb.  There is a good article at\nwww.koryu.com written \nby Dr. Karl Friday called &quot;Is Ninjutsu a Koryu&quot;.  Dr.\nFriday holds a \nMenkyo Kaiden in Kashima Shinto Ryu (one of the oldest\nsamurai styles \nstill around), and a PhD in History.  \n\n\nYahoo!
