I knew that the dailect was very old and has=\r\n \n&gt; changed in meaning or is forgotten. Also people said that it could \n&gt; b=\r\ne Chinese. I have a answer to your question (probaly with some \n&gt; embelishm=\r\nent) about the pull strength. It was problay about 20 \n&gt; pounds stronger th=\r\nan when the yumi was refined and made with the \nsame \n&gt; care as a sword i.e=\r\n weight and balance to the person and the like. \n&gt; But &quot;history&quot; shows of a=\r\n samurai named Minamoto no Tametomo. He was \n&gt; a very large and powerful ma=\r\nn. They said that He ultimately \nprovoked \n&gt; the central government into se=\r\nnding an armada of twenty small \n&gt; warships in an attempt to force him to p=\r\nay. As a gesture of \n&gt; defience, Tametomo decided to shoot a large, bulbed =\r\narrow over the \n&gt; bow of one of the ships, but it struck the wooden hull a =\r\nfew inches \n&gt; above the waterline instead. The shot was so powerful that th=\r\ne \narrow \n&gt; penetrated both sides of the vessel, creating two gaping holes.=\r\n Sea \n&gt; water poured in and the ship began to sink. The sight of the \nwarsh=\r\nip \n&gt; being sunk by a single arrow so frightened the other ships&#39; \ncaptains=\r\n \n&gt; that they retreated. That was what Japanese history said anyway. \n&gt; Aga=\r\nin thank you for helping me.
