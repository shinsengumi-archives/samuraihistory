The other was headed\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; Honda Masanobu.\n\nOkay--actually, it appears there were THREE branches. \n\nhttp://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/h_ohta/rekisi/kamei/honda.htm\n\nAll seem to come from a common Honda Sukemasa\n(�{������), but branch off at various points.\nTadakatsu is the first famous person in one of the\nbranches, Masanobu is the start of branch 3, and\nbranch two is started by Honda Tadatsugu (����), the\ngrandfather of out Toshitsugu. His father&#39;s name was\nYasutsugu (�N��). Toshitsugu was born in 1595 as the\noldest son. In 1621 he inherited Yasutsugu&#39;s 35,000\nkoku fief in Mikawa. In 1636 he moved to Kameyama-jo\nin Ise, and his fief increased to 50,000 koku. In 1651\nhe moved to Omi province, and increased to 70,000\nkoku. In 1664 he relinquished head of the family to\nhis 2nd son, Yasu(?) �i�N��) (Someone help me with the\nreading...&quot;sho&quot; is the only one I know), and died in\n1668.\n\nAnd that settles my question about the different &quot;da&quot;\nkanji also--both Masanobu and Tadakatsu used ��. �{�c,\nwith the &quot;field&quot; character, however, is the Motor\nCompany (I checked), so it&#39;s doubtful that it&#39;s\nconnected with the Honda family above. Unless, of\ncourse, as is possible, someone changed the character.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
