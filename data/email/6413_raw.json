This is the way I read your post with regard to the \nsword having a soul of its own. I&#39;m not saying that religion is \nsuperstition, but rather their response to the arbitary nature \nof death in battle shaped their superstitions.\n\nThe great swordsmen had to rise above superstition - their \ntraining of the great swordsmen was jiriki - self-power. \nThey realised that a Musashi or a Nobutsuna could be undone \nby a moment of psycholigical weakness, and all their training \nwas towards a state of constant readiness.\n\nIn the same way as the smith forges a blade, the swordsman \nforges himself, or rather his &#39;self&#39;, and all the literature \nof the martial ryu reflect this notion as the foundation of the \nway of the warrior. If we introduce the notion of the sword \nhaving its own soul, which it imparts to the swordsman, then we \nstand in danger of confusing the disciplines and rendering the \nwhole thing a nonsense.\n\nHowever, I do agree that swordsmen could appreciate the \nqualities of a blade that do not lend themselves to physical \nobservation.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
