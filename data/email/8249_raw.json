I found a book at my local library that explains a lot about the fires in the Yoshiwara throughout its history. the title is Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan by Cecilia Segawa Siegle. Its by University of Hawai&#39;i press. Some of you might want to look it up it. Anyway thank you to all who lent me their precious time and patience in this matter. \n  Rod\n   \n  Barbara Nostrand &lt;nostrand@...&gt; wrote:\n  Hi.\n\nWhy not write the Tokyo fire department and ask them?\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS \n        Samurai   Japan   Japan airline \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
