Swords are very cool indeed, and\n&gt; since they&#39;ve kept me\n&gt; fascinated and actively growing for the past\n&gt; forty-odd years, I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; whether I resemble that &quot;all freaky&quot; remark or not.\n&gt; ...I feel so insulted.\n\nDo you imbue your sword with some kind of mystic\ndogma?\n\tHmm.  Well, that&#39;s not at all the way I&#39;d describe it, Nate, but I have a\nsneaking suspicion that you would regard my answer to that question as a\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\nDo you believe that once drawn a sword has to\nbe used, or it will implode?\n\tHeh.  I&#39;ve met a couple of guys like that.  &quot;Sure you can see my sword:&quot;\n(here you get the benefit of the best Dark Smouldering Glance he can\nmanage:)  &quot;but it must taste blood before it is sheathed again...&quot;   Good\nmanners only require you to get out of earshot before you start laughing.\nNo, unless the person is known to come out of an unbroken cultural tradition\n(and I think the Ghurkas are the about only ones this still applies to\ntoday... and at that, I&#39;m not sure the oral tradition is true regarding them\neither), then I&#39;ve found this view to be one of the surest signs of an ego\non legs rather than a martial artist.  Almost without exception, there&#39;s a\nlot less skill than mouth wearing that blade.\n...Sure, my swords let me know if they haven&#39;t been used in too long, but\nit&#39;s not as if they have to be used _on_ somebody.  What _is_ the proper use\nof a sword, indeed?  The Heiho Kaden Sho of the Yagyu discusses the idea of\nthe &quot;Life-Giving Sword&quot; - and I think Munenori (wasn&#39;t it he?) was working\ntoward an idea that is still worth developing today.  If the sword is\nimportant still - and I am not alone in a profound conviction that it is -\nthen it&#39;s important that the idea of using a sword should continue to\nevolve.  This is the line of thinking that has led to every &quot;michi&quot; (or\n&quot;do&quot;) approach growing out of the old &quot;jutsu&quot; forms of the Japanese weapon\narts.  Yes, a good sword should be used.  It&#39;s an insult to the sword not to\ndo so.  But the best use of the sword is not - with blessed few exceptions -\nto cut down a life.  That, as the Yagyu book suggests, ought properly to be\nreserved for those times when one person&#39;s evil has come to a peak.  And\nmodern law generally puts it in rather similar, if less poetic, terms.\nDo you really think that\npiece of steel is your soul?\n\tMine?  No, my soul is complicated enough without having to incorporate a\ndozen or so good pieces of steel.  A decent sword tends to develop its own\nsoul, or something suspiciously like one, if used with respect.  It could be\nsomething of an awakening process rather than development, I&#39;m not honestly\nsure.  I only know that I get a sense when someone&#39;s &quot;home&quot; in a blade, and\nit leaves me with a very clear understanding of why the tradition might\narise of the sword being the soul of the bushi.\nAs long as you answered &quot;no&quot; to these, you&#39;re not a\nfreak.\n\tAnd your point would be...?\n&gt; How to handle this sense of wounded dignity in a\n&gt; mature and rational\n&gt; manner - ha!  Got it!\n&gt; Nate, we&#39;re going to have to have a duel.\n&gt;       Gereg\n\nOnly if I get to choose weapons.\n\nI choose Main Battle Tank. Mine&#39;s an M1A2--yours?\n\tY&#39;know, I had a strong suspicion you were going to take this kind of\nunsporting attitude.  Nah, I figure, we&#39;re on a Japanese history list, so\nthose Euro-centric, &quot;I-challenge-so-you-choose&quot; rules don&#39;t apply.  There&#39;s\nonly one weapon suited for a civilised disagreement between gentlemen:  the\nsword.  It&#39;s the Mythically Correct solution.\n\t...Of course, if you&#39;re going to remind me that neither of us could in fact\nbe considered a gentleman under the very definitions I&#39;m calling for (and it\nwould be just like you to do that), then I&#39;ll have no more telling response\nthan to run like hell (unless I can arrange to be closer to you than you are\nto your M1A2 when our negotiations reach this unhappy stage).\n\tThis is what I hated about the Boxer Rebellion, too.\n\t\tGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
