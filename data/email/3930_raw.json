If you were dishonorable this would effect not only you but it would tarnish the names of your sons and their familys too. The peasants followed the same code of honor as well so it was not something just to keep the troops loyal.\n\nbest regards\nDave Jackson\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: jonathan lee \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 4:02 AM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai\n\n\n\n  Hello Vladilen,\n\n  Out of interest, what does this word &quot;honor&quot; mean to you? I believe this concept is a sort of fake conciencnesse created created by the people at the top to make loyal soldiers to die for their battles battle. And in fact this &quot;honor&quot; is the most dishounarble thing to follow.\n\n  I believe the only honor is the honor to all of mankind and our fellow human beings. This honor includes not to kill another.\n  What does everybody else think?\n  Thanks for listening\n  Jonny\n\n\n\n\n  Vladilen Blackthorne &lt;vladilen_blackthorne@...&gt; wrote:\n  I&#39;m new to this site and I do not know much about samurai. But I \n  hope I have found a group that does know. From what I know fromt \n  hesite and others is it is the perfect life. at least for me  to die \n  for the word honor. I only wish I had been born about 250 years \n  ago.. So maybe I could have fought int he battle of Shiroyama.. and \n  died with the one thing I understand well I joined to learn  more.. \n  So I guess.. hi\n\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n  Yahoo!
