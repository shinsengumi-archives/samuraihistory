Patrick didn&#39;t seem \nthe type to listen to reason, really.\n\nAlso, I will be glad to see a thinning out of the martial arts posts -- \nnot because I have no appreciation for it, but because as you say, they \nare more often than not, off-topic. It&#39;s especially frustrating when \nthose people insist that their budo, whatever it is, is ALL about how \nsamurai used to live, all the while spewing half the misconceptions on \nthat list of eleven posted not so long ago.\n\nI&#39;ve been a crusader for newbie-friendliness in the past, but when \ncorrect information is given and people just don&#39;t bother to read it \neven when pointed to it... the time for patience and tolerance starts \ndrawing to a close. It&#39;s also terribly embarrassing for me to read other \npeople cluelessly putting themselves in situations that are just setting \nthemselves up for ridicule or swift banning. Not fun.\n\nThanks to the moderators for keeping a chin up through all this, though, \nyou&#39;ve been handling it like good sports despite all the flak.\n\nSally\n\nKitsuno wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; He has been banned, as will anyone else who can&#39;t control themselves \n&gt; here.  Things have been getting pretty ridiculous and out of hand \n&gt; lately, and it is about time that the moderators start tightening \n&gt; the chains again for a while until things get back to status quo.  \n&gt; The moderators have the right to ban anyone they feel necessary, and \n&gt; will do so without hesitation or warning. Let&#39;s keep everything on \n&gt; track - this is a &quot;Samurai HISTORY Forum&quot;, and flames will not be \n&gt; tolerated.  Furthermore, unless directly applicable to the Samurai, \n&gt; or Samurai history from the heian period on to the end of the 19th \n&gt; century, the purely martial arts posts need to stop.  Iaido, etc. is \n&gt; admissable for conversation as that has direct roots in the topic at \n&gt; hand, but random martial arts conversations most definately don&#39;t.  \n&gt; Let&#39;s all try to get along and stay on track.  We look forward to \n&gt; more questions and conversation relating to the Samurai and Japanese \n&gt; history.\n&gt; \n&gt; Carry on, \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai History Moderators\n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
