We&#39;ll study the influency of the japanese philosophy\nat the artisan work and the swordsmiths at the moment of the sword\nconstruction, looking for their own philosophical merits, the beauty and the\nfunctionality. The sword wasn&#39;t just an object of cut for the Samurai but\nsomething that had a philosophy, simbols, an interior essence or how it&#39;s\nsaid, it has an soul. The peculiar and different way, that it was necessary\nto get the ideal sword, made the artisan use cultural and religious aspects\nin a symmetry with the Nature. The parallel universe of the oriental\ncreation is something mystic and philosophic, wich the objective is to\ncreate\nin a way to sensitize because of the beauty and the utility.\n\n\n\n"
