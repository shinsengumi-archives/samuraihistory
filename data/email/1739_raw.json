When the\n&gt; Japanese surrendered they stockpiled the weapons (firearms, blades, etc)\n&gt; usually at harbors, airfields, or some other major location so that the\n&gt; American forces could easily collect them.  In most cases the officers in\n&gt; charge of the local military units would allow the soldiers to pick\nthrough\n&gt; the piles and take what they wanted.  That is how my grandfather got his\n&gt; rifle and sword.\n&gt;   Very rarely did a soldier kill an officer on the battlefield and take\nhis\n&gt; sword then.  For two reasons.  One, killing an officer would require\ngetting\n&gt; close enough to have killed all the other soldiers around him.  Two, they\n&gt; were in the middle of a war, they would not have had time to bend down and\n&gt; pick up a sword while avoiding flying bullets.\n&gt;   I hope that this helps you determine how the weapons were acquired.  The\n&gt; more posts I read about it the more I believe that you have a very nice\n&gt; find.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Peace,\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt Williams\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; STOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*\n&gt; http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
