I appreciate that the re-establishment=\r\n of the samurai as a functioning class is next to impossible, but it was ju=\r\nst a thought to try and stimulate a debate, if a little semantic.\nHowever, =\r\nupon your point about the restoration of a class, an example springs to min=\r\nd, the restoration of the aristocracy along with Louis XVIII, in France aft=\r\ner the allied monarchies had removed the Bonapartists from government in 18=\r\n14. Not a good role model  though as they returned even more pompous and ex=\r\nisted only until the Revolution in 1830.\nM.Lorimer\n \n\nan@... wrote:\nIt =\r\nis theoretically possible, though, that the class could be restored, either=\r\n through a legal \ndecision, or through a collective revolt by samurai desce=\r\nndents. I&#39;m trying to think of an \nhistorical illustration of this... Can&#39;t=\r\n. Does anyone else know of a restoration of a class through \nrevolt or law?=\r\n In The Three Musketeers, this happens with the Musketeers. But that&#39;s fict=\r\nion, \nand the Musketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there might be some para=\r\nllels). Lookin&#39; for a real \nhistorical example...\n\nHere&#39;s a different idea.=\r\n..\nIn India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real every=\r\nday life, the caste \nsystem is just as real as it was before the laws. The =\r\nlaw only serves its purpose if people obey \nit, or if it is enforced. So it=\r\n is theoretically possible, also, that descendents of samurai could \nclaim =\r\nto be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would for all in=\r\ntents and \npurposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished=\r\n. Of course, what a samurai \ntoday would do or be is ... well... difficult =\r\nto imagine. Maybe they would carry two guns instead \nof two swords, LOL, an=\r\nd collectively comprise the Japanese police force.\n\nTheoretically, suppose =\r\nthat history had happened this way: Upon the abolishment of the \nsamurai cl=\r\nass, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public still regarded them=\r\n as \nsamurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. (Governmen=\r\nts often act in an \ninconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had hap=\r\npened this way, would that group of \npeople still be samurai, even though l=\r\negally the class was abolished?\n\nI think they would. \n\nThis has some parall=\r\nel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man and woman &quot;shack up&quot; \nfor =\r\nan extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though they have=\r\n never \nexchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes ma=\r\nn and wife. That was \ncommon practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eve=\r\nntually recognized this and would \nafter said elapse of time pronounce them=\r\n legally man and wife (so the government could get \nadditional taxes out of=\r\n them).\n\nAnyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the gover=\r\nnment acknowledged \nthem to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one=\r\n man and wife. It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many \ncultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of pap=\r\ner&quot; from the government to confirm or legitimize the marriage. \nPublic prac=\r\ntice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal action. \n\nSo what if =\r\nsomeone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public acceptance, apart =\r\nfrom \nlaw, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw mar=\r\nriage or the Indian caste \nsystem), how much of the public would it take to=\r\n justify that claim? What&#39;s the critical mass \nrequired for acceptance? Cer=\r\ntainly not 100 percent, because even in the samurai&#39;s heyday, \nthere were p=\r\neople who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as it was. Maybe 51%? A simple=\r\n \nmajority? Who decides what the percentage would be?\n\nAll this to say, &quot;NO=\r\n!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today... but theoretically, it&#39;s possible.\n\n\n&gt; Konni=\r\nchi wa, tomodachi\n&gt; This is going to seem as if I am against samurai, which=\r\n I am not. I am\n&gt; rather intrigued by them, in their day. Follow me on this=\r\n for a moment\n&gt; if you will...\n&gt; \n&gt; When Slavery was abolished in the Unite=\r\nd States, there were people who\n&gt; still thought slavery was a good idea, an=\r\nd people who didn&#39;t. After\n&gt; the abolishment of slavery, for the most part,=\r\n former slave owners\n&gt; rarely went about saying they were members of a clas=\r\ns that proudly\n&gt; owned other human beings and had the right to life or deat=\r\nh over them.\n&gt; The law didn&#39;t allow that any more, and for the most part, a=\r\nnd the\n&gt; general populace would not stand for that. The abolishment was dri=\r\nlled\n&gt; into the public psyche, as was the concept that slave owners were no=\r\nt\n&gt; needed in a changed society, and that all races and classes should be\n&gt;=\r\n free and theoretically equal. Owning slaves was made not-noble.\n&gt; \n&gt; Samur=\r\nai had an equal right of life or death over those of lesser\n&gt; class, held a=\r\nll of the benefits of the current society, and when\n&gt; Samurai were abolishe=\r\nd, the general psyche of the public thought they\n&gt; were as un-needed as sla=\r\nve owners were in the U.S.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I suppose one could say they were still =\r\nslave owners if they were\n&gt; the descendants of slave owners...but the publi=\r\nc would not look kindly\n&gt; on that, nor would I suspect the public would loo=\r\nk kindly on Samurai.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were good samurai, and the parts of samurai=\r\n life that were noble\n&gt; should be celebrated but lets not forget it was a p=\r\nackage deal. - just\n&gt; like there were, I suppose, some good slave owners, b=\r\nut the society\n&gt; evolved around them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just other thoughts...\n&gt; Chri=\r\nstopher \n&gt; (who celebrates the good parts of samurai life, but is aware the=\r\nre are\n&gt; bad ones...)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So theoretically the descendants of the samura=\r\ni class could\n&gt; therefore still consider themselves to be samurai, although=\r\n not with a\n&gt; legal foundation, with the laws enacted during the Meiji Rest=\r\noration\n&gt; being formulated by the winners, if not nessarily/hypothetically =\r\nthose\n&gt; in the &#39;right&#39; ??\n&gt; &gt; Just a thought\n&gt; &gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives sto=\r\nre: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
