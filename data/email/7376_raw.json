I think the SCA group he (the \noffender) was talking about was the Genji, they are a lot of fun but \nin no way are the a battle recreation group.  They mostly have fun \nand dress (sorta) like samurai.\n\nIs this group a good resource for finding information on hard to \ntrack down events and people in japanese history?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nMichael\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Anthony J.
