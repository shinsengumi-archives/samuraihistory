One person would hoist the banner up to the top of the building to\nshow that his brigade was fighting the flames, until either the fire was put\nout, or the fire consumed him...  Or at least, this is what I was taught in\nJapanese culture class..\n&gt;\n&gt; Wilson\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; --------- Original Message ---------\n&gt; DATE: Sat, 29 Nov 2003 16:56:41\n&gt; From: Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt;\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering about the origins of the yakuza, I have herd that they\noriginated from porters, (a group\n&gt; that were easily recognized by their extensive body art). Or were they\nsimply a mixed group of rufians\n&gt; and wayward ronin? All this is assumeing that they originated in the 18th\nor 19th centurys, or are they\n&gt; a much more recent development?\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
