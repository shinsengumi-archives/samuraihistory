Put most simply, they were armed. Durin=\r\ng the Do-ikki of the later 15th Century, they were still agriculturalists (=\r\neither as minor owners or cultivators), but had the advantage of being arme=\r\nd (perhaps not to the level of samurai retained by local daimyo), placing t=\r\nhem slightly higher up the scale to the average peasant with mud on his fee=\r\nt. This was undoubtedly one of the reasons ashigaru and samurai were not pe=\r\nrmitted to return to their home villages by the statutes of Toyotomi Hideyo=\r\nshi, since they gave an element of martial skill to rural discontent. \n\n\n--=\r\n- On Tue, 16/2/10, konohawolfie &lt;Greywolf456@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: ko=\r\nnohawolfie &lt;Greywolf456@...&gt;\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Ji-samur=\r\nai, Ikki, and Sousen?

Re=\r\nal name&#39;s Sara) and I am a new member to the Samurai History Group. I am ve=\r\nry impressed with the knowledge of samurai and feudal history in the Archiv=\r\nes, so I have a few questions pertaining to Ji-samurai, the Ikki (the rebel=\r\nlions?) and Sousen.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think Wikipedia provides enough detail and=\r\n I may be confused with the samurai society in particular. I am too familia=\r\nr with the popular samurai that go to the capital, and it seems that samura=\r\ni are both the rulers of the provinces and the soldiers underneath the rule=\r\nrs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why/how were there lower-ranked rural samurai [Zi-samurai] ? And I=\r\nkki are like those who rebel against the Capital forces and live in rural v=\r\nillages (I think called Sousen?)? \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I find it a little hard to be=\r\nlieve that few people became samurai and I read about large armies ;) What =\r\nwas samurai life like? What did they do in an average day?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have b=\r\neen removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have bee=\r\nn removed]\n\n\n"
