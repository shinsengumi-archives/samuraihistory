As the usual reference says, the movement of the wings of a  butterfly in the brazilian rainforest can start a typhoon in Hong Kong.\nSo, should be an infinite number of single situations, not only every single decision of every samurai, but every single breath of every farmer, that indeed could have affected the samurai history. How many single unrecorded events were neccesary to produce the final output in Okehazama battle, as an example?\nScale of the event even is not a worthy reference. An individual action could be so decisive like the performance of an entire army. \nIn that point of view, of course, should be lots of unrecorded critical situations that may have changed history. As impressive events like a battle?\nAt one point the event is so impressive that is recorded independently of their influence in history. So probably, as has been said before, main battles probably not. Small skirmishes, almost for sure.\nOf course, probably all this is obvious, but I think that is neccesay to establish my arguments in order to say that, yes, to the the question.\n\njonboy_2233 &lt;jonboy_2233@...&gt; wrote:                                  do you believe that there are untold truths in the samurai history, \n such as unrecorded battles that may have changed history?\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________\n\n&quot;And the light shineth in darkness, \n\nand the darkness did not comprehend it&quot;\n\n_________________________________\n \n---------------------------------\nAccess over 1 million songs - Yahoo!
