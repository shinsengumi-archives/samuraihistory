Also, I&#39;ve yet \nto read every last response, so pls also bear with me.\n\nThe question was if there are still samurai.  The discussion quickly \nestablished that the legal title of &quot;samurai&quot; was disestablished in \n1870s legislation as part of both the Meiji Restoration and Japanese \nmodernization/westernization.  I agree w/the others&#39; in their \ninterpretation of the question as not addressing legal status, but as \nan inquiry into the vitality of a concept of &quot;samurai&quot; embodied in \nthe way ppl lead their lives.\n\nTo me, in this light, asking if there are still samurai is a lot like \nasking if there are still trees. (But how else does one learn?)  I \nsuppose it does all depend on how you define a tree, but the point \nremains and is even translingual: a rose is a rose, ne?\n\nPpl who wail about there &quot;not being samurai&quot; simply because some law \nthat is over a century old said so; when history, and the passage of \ntime, and sociology, and psychology, and simple reason tells us there \nstill are samurai have become far too attached to titles, and, I dare \nsay, it is good they don&#39;t call themselves samurai.\n\nEven after that bit of legal history was put down, ppl still carried \ntheir weaponry, they still applied themselves to a certain philosophy \nof life, they still served masters, they still embraced death as a \npart of life, they still pursued learning in many areas, both \nconcrete and abstract, in other words: the law did not &quot;un-samurai&quot; \nthem.  Therefore, there are still samurai.\n\nGiri\n\n\n"
