And I didn&#39;t mean to paint a \npicture that ALL Samurai were honorable and followed Bushido, many \nwere &quot;dirty&quot; samurai, whether they were ronin-criminals, or high \nranking corrupt officials. But most samurai followed Bushido and \nwere the &quot;ideal&quot; samurai most think of today. I also didn&#39;t mean to \nsay ALL ninjas were underhanded, deceitful, and un-honorable. But \nmost samurai thought this, hence most were &quot;bitter enemies&quot; with \nninjas.  Now we all know that ninjas were employed by samurai, and \nif they did have some kind of code they followed (anyone know the \nname?) they were still cast in a negative light by samurai, for \ninstance if a ninja was sent to assassinate someone, they would \ncertainly seek up on the victim and quietly dispose of him, which is \nquite understandable. However this goes against Bushido, you should \ndeclare your presence, challenge your opponent, then fight him in \none-on-one combat.  \n\nI am also sure ninjas casted samurai in a negative light as well. \nGenerally ninjas were not of samurai class, (anyone know any \nexceptions?) they were made up of the other classes, since they \ncouldn&#39;t become samurai, they trained and became ninjas instead, and \nI&#39;m sure being oppressed by the samurai class led to animosity \ntowards them, therefore once again, &quot;bitter enemies.&quot;\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dnastaj&quot; &lt;dnastaj@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Weren&#39;t some ninja&#39;s (shinobi?) servants of hans? And they weren&#39;t \n&gt; all bad were they? They had a code of ethics, I mean, not \nengagment-\n&gt; wise, but they&#39;re based around a type of militia/guerilla tactics. \n&gt; Generally speaking, I don&#39;t think all samurai were honorable \neither. \n&gt; I&#39;m sure there must have been a handful of &quot;dirty&quot; samurai.\n&gt; ;) Dustin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Masamori Masami&quot; \n&gt; &lt;oni_shogun@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Generally samurai looked down on ninjas. They considered ninjas \n&gt; &gt; underhanded, deceitful, and un-honorable. Basically everything \n&gt; &gt; Bushido was not.  But where a samurai&#39;s goal in life was to \n&gt; maintain \n&gt; &gt; his honor, a ninja&#39;s goal was to get the job done, honorable or \n&gt; not. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; by the way a great site for ninja facts and anything ninja \nrelated \n&gt; &gt; is http://www.entertheninja.com/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, eric johnson \n&gt; &gt; &lt;ronin121293@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hey-i love the dirty pair and am also relatively new to this \n&gt; &gt; particular group. i am also looking for samurai sites and sites \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; are HISTORICALLY accurate concerning &quot;the men in the shadows&quot; \n&gt; &gt; or &quot;men of shadows&quot;- the ninja. i have learned a little of the \n&gt; &gt; history of a samurai called, i believe, &quot;the demon hanso&quot; (?) \n&gt; hatori \n&gt; &gt; hanso(?) who started a subversive group dedicated to \nintelligence, \n&gt; &gt; infiltration and guerrilla warfare.Apparently he used men (& \nwomen) \n&gt; &gt; who were willing to leave honor at home and do whatever it took \nto \n&gt; &gt; get an advantage over the enemy.Anybody with info on the ninja \nin \n&gt; &gt; relation to the samurai?

Since discovering \n&gt; Rurouni \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kenshin we have been amazed at the attention to historical \nfact \n&gt; &gt; &gt; involved with this series. We have just started becoming \n&gt; &gt; interested \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the Samurai histories but can find no info on this group of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; misunderstood Samurai. Any help will be appreciated and \n&gt; &gt; reciprocated. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kei and I are somewhat of an expert on anime in general and \n&gt; Lovely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Angels/Dirty Pair in particular as well as romanji script in \n&gt; &gt; Japanese \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and its English translations. We also collect lyrics in both \n&gt; &gt; &gt; languages and download music and video for animes too. Domo \n&gt; &gt; arigato \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for your assistances.
