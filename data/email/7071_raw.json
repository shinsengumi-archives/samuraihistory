His book Ninja secrets is fine (not good just\nfine) but in that he implies he lived in Japan, his\nfirst trip I believe was for 2 weeks.\n\nI have the discovery program on Ninja. biggest load of\ncrap I have seen, its a disgrace.\n\nIn english there is little to be read on Ninja and\nwhat they really were. Turnbulls first book was fine,\nbuthe concentrated on writing about samurai who did\none feet of ninja behavior once in there life, he did\nnot explore the history properly. Then his 2nd book on\nninja was a joke, even he after all these years of\npeople in and out of the martial arts saying no\nstraight swords - went and printed just that.\n\nOne person has for the first tiem tried to gain a\nlittle info for us all, it is mainly directed towards\nthe (supposed) history within the bujinkan but covers\ngeneral ninja info, including that black suit thing as\ncomplete crap and stating what it really is.\n\nLook what happens - people who havent seen it attack\nit.\n\nVery unfair.\n\npaul\n\n\n--- &quot;Haynes, A (Angus)&quot; &lt;angus.haynes@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n---------------------------------\n-- Paul wrote:\n\n &gt; I havent seen it, I know nothing about it, so I\nwill\n &gt; slam it as much as I can.\n\nYou&#39;ve got to understand that the mere mention of\nHayes in a samurai\nhistory mailing list is going to ruffle some feathers.\nThe &quot;history&quot; (a\nword used very lightly in this case) in his books is\nso incorrect that\nit&#39;d be laughable if it weren&#39;t for the fact that\nthere are people out\nthere who buy in to it.\n \n &gt; My I suggest if you already think its a load of\ncrap\n &gt; before its been released that you go and produce\n &gt; something better.\n &gt; \n &gt; i await your future project on the ninja so we can\nall\n &gt; insult it\n \nI would *love* to make a documentary that pointed out\nthe myths behind\nthese mystical &quot;ninja&quot; guys, but really who would\nwatch it? The idea of\na black-clad ninja dropping 40-feet from a tree while\nraining ninja\nstars down at the unsuspecting Uesugi Kenshin before\nremoving his head\nwith a swift blade of his straight Ninja-To and then\nquickly\ndisappearing in a puff of smoke in a hell of a lot\nmore exciting than\nsaying he died of stomach cancer.\n \nIf this documentary does indeed dispel the rumours,\ngreat. But surely\nyou can see why we might be sceptical...\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be\nconfidential or privileged, and is sent for the\npersonal attention of the intended recipient.
