I believe that apart from the obvious problems (Ura-Yagyu? And the \nwhole corruption theme.) that L.W.and C. is one of the best Samurai era manga \nseries out there ( If you like Lone wolf then also check out Blade of the \nImmortal, Dark Horse pub.) The films themselves were close enough to the \ncomic to allow me to get into them easily (Not Shogun Assassin...the original \nstoryline...) and were as much fun to watch. The comics are still the best \ndrawn and have the most original and well thought out storyline that I have \nread yet, although &#39;Blade&#39; may come close to it.\nBen Sharples.\n Try asking the question on www.e-budo.com for a  larger response...\n\n"
