Draeger..&#39;Classical Bujutsu&#39;, &#39;Classical \nBudo&#39;, and &#39;Modern Budo and Bujutsu&#39;...They can explain the issue with far \nmore accuracy than I can here..It is VERY complex and people will be unlikely \nto agree easily on exact definitions...\n Hope that this starts to help you though..\n Abayo..\n Ben Sharples.\n\n"
