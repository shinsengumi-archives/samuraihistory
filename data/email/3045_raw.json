This is a different situation, but not terribly so. I have also seen video demonstrations of custom made Katanas being used to break clean through rapiers/broadswords of top quality European manufacture. It&#39;s not above such a sword&#39;s capability to do something like that given enough force, like you said. (The rifles these guys were carrying could also have been cheaply made)\n \nI think that from the film&#39;s perspective, and for that of the public viewing it, this was almost a necessary scene. The Samurai sword has always had a reputation for hardness and cutting power, but most of the Western world doesn&#39;t know about it, no matter how many episodes of &#39;Highlander&#39; they might have watched. It was a nice example of one of Japan&#39;s main contributions to military technology. \n\nJosh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:\nI still dont think it could happen, it looked to me as if it sliced thru the action.. true, it probably was the best on the field that day (well except for after about the first 15 minutes that Tom had been fighting), but how hard Tom could swing that sword, momentum and downward force and strength have a lot to do w/ that as well..\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Sat, 10 Jan 2004 15:22:02\nFrom: David Heller &lt;olasnah@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nCutting through a rifle is not an unknown event. As for the movie, if the blade impacted just behind the action of the rifle, I would say that it&#39;s almost easy. Maybe we can see that on the DVD. The sword that Algren carried was freshly forged and probably had the sharpest and strongest blade on the field of battle that day. \n\nJosh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:I know the movie was inaccurate, and I tried to put that past it, and judge it as a movie..even then it still sucked.. like when Tom cruise sliced thru a rifle w/ a sword?? or all the sword fights striking the blades edge on edge repeatedly.. that was all crap.. there was lots of other stuff too.. \n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Sat, 10 Jan 2004 13:23:17\nFrom: Mmupton1@...\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nI do not think &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is historically accurate, but I think the \nbattle at the very end of the movie actually did take place, something like the \ngun powder rebellion. Well, anyway I also thought it was a good movie. It was \nquit touching. I went to go see it with my friends when it first came out, \nthey try to act as if they are tough, but when we walked out of the theater they \nwere balling their eyes out. We dont talk about that to this day though. Yeah \nit was a good movie.\n-Matthew Upton\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
