My experiments with this technique and Tameshigiri \n&gt; were conducted in Japan. The idea was first taught to me in English \n&gt; yes, but was confirmed again and again by my teachers in Japan. The \n&gt; language used for the most part was Japanese and the people involved \n&gt; Eishin Ryu swordsmen. I know it won&#39;t change your mind but may allow \n&gt; others to view on balance the two sides...\n\nInteresting -- but it still sounds like something that wasn&#39;t much of a \nhistorical practise. It might have been an Edo thing when they were able to deal \nwith specialist swordsmen, but I really doubt that sort of thing was part of the \noriginal idea, when a kaishaku was just a guy helping the process along.\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
