I found the Samurai pages through my Sensei&#39;s web page link, and \nbefore this, I didn&#39;t know people studied the Samurai and Japanese \nhistory with such enthusiasm. It&#39;s an eye opener for me. :-) Good to \nhave one&#39;s eyes opened. \nMy name is Sharon Hayakawa, aka Shuri Hayakawa. I live in Missouri, \nUSA. My Sensei is Doshu Shiro Shintaku from Wakayama Japan. \nBefore studying with him, I studied with Seiyu Oyata. About 17 years \nor so. \nHajimemashite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
