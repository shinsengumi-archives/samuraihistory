I shou=\r\nld have given further amplification. The \noriginal conversation between a f=\r\nriend and I was mainly concerning \nart and architecture. I am a carpenter s=\r\ntudying traditional \nfarmhouse restoration. My friend in speaking of unrepa=\r\nirable damage \nwas referring to restrictions in advancement enforced by the=\r\n \nTokugawas. Our joke was that had Japan advanced at the same level as \nthe=\r\n west they would have central heating by now! In my view however \nmuch of J=\r\napans beauty lies in the lasting results of those \nenforcements. \n\n\n&gt; &gt; Fro=\r\nm: Thodoris Dimaras &lt;thdimaras@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;As it&#39;s been pointed out before =\r\n&quot;It&#39;s the economy,\n&gt; &gt;stupid!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent summary.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   From: &quot;Rob&quot;=\r\n &lt;capt_bochan@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Tokugawa\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;It was from the beginning a =\r\nsolid understanding and practice of \n&gt; &gt;Confucian political beleifs and stu=\r\ndies. \n&gt; \n&gt; ???? More like &#39;The Prince&#39; I would say. The other baggage was =\r\n\nbrought in later as a method to bolster the regime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;This has been we=\r\nll documented and is without argument. \n&gt; \n&gt; Please list sources then.\n&gt; \n\n=\r\nI could write a book of references here but I think these will \nsuffice. Ts=\r\nukahira -The sankin kotai system of Tokugawa Japan\nTotman- Politics in the =\r\nTokugawa bakufu.\nNakamura- Ieyasuden\nHall- Government and Local power in Ja=\r\npan.\n\nIt was highly enjoyable and very interesting reading all the great \nr=\r\nesponses. Thank you all!! \n\nHirai\n\n&gt; &gt;Rather my change of subject conversat=\r\nion was how modern Japan has \ndeveloped, no, rather profitted from 200 year=\r\ns of \n&gt; &gt;Tokugawa control. \n \n&gt; \n&gt; Since my wayback machine with the God at=\r\ntachment is broken I will \nspin some postulates.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Japan has been thr=\r\nough several periods of wildly importing \nforeign cultures and ideas, this =\r\none will end in the 1650s and not \nthe early 1600&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Japan figures =\r\nout that &#39;our ships really suck, let&#39;s copy even \nmore Western ships&#39;. Also=\r\n guns are good but cannons are sweet!\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Hey there&#39;s lots of money, la=\r\nnd and power up for grabs locally \nif you have a good navy and army! \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere starts 300 years early. \nJapan contr=\r\nols the Far East for all intents and purpose in the mid \n1850s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of cou=\r\nrse I don&#39;t know if that would really be a benefit or not. I \nsuspect the r=\r\nest of Asia would not think so.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Starting with Ueyesu the Tokugawas=\r\n ruled unlike any other \nleaders. \n&gt; \n&gt; You will have to be far more specif=\r\nic about this one. Name one \nunique attribute or action.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;My thoughts =\r\nwere directed more to the enforcement of non \n&gt; &gt;militaristic training for =\r\nall Tokugawa senior warriors such as \nthe \n&gt; &gt;arts, his mircomanagement of =\r\nall aspects of daily life from the \nonly \n&gt; &gt;approved design and measuremen=\r\nt of building houses to how a \nbucket of \n&gt; &gt;rice was to be sold and on to =\r\neven what could and could not be \nspoken \n&gt; &gt;of in public. \n&gt; \n&gt; Many of th=\r\ne regulations came long after Ieyasu, its in the nature \nof bureacrats to c=\r\nreate more rules as time goes by.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
