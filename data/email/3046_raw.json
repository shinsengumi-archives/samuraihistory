The samurai were gunned down nearly to the last man, and Saigo (Katsumoto) died early in the battle after being injured in the groin by a bullet and his aide assited him with committing hara-kiri, and then charged off into the battle only to be killed himself later on. \n \nThe battle in the forest was almost &#39;scary&#39; to me. The sight of the armoured Samurai was awe inspiring. I would have run myself if I were one of those conscript soldiers. \n \nAlgren&#39;s integration with the Japanese was interesting. Here is a guy who apparently cannot be killed in battle (this kind of thing has been written about before) who wants terribly to die and be rid of his guilt over killing innocents. He finds comfort in the religious lifestyle of the samurai and finds that he can redeem himself by fighting for them. The end was perfect to me. The battle could have been better (I agree with others that it was too similar to Braveheart&#39;s battle of Falkirk, although it did not detract from the film at all). Algren&#39;s appearance before Emperor Meiji (nice touch with him struggling to walk from all his injuries) and begging the Emperor to hear Katsumoto&#39;s voice in the form of the rebellion and slow down the modernization of Japan was great. (Look at what it got them into later on)\n\nCesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\nHistorically it was as accurate as... Gladiator: not much. The setting \nis historically sound, the events are pure Hollywood fiction, but why \nnot? People loved it!! I think all over it was a good movie, even with \nall its inconsistencies. I especially enjoyed the part when Algren is \n&quot;prisoner&#39; in the Japanese village, and &quot;learns&quot; to be Japanese. The \nfirst battle (in the forest) was EXCELLENT as well. The scene with the \nsamurai coming out of the mist... Kurosawa himself would have loved \nthat.\n\n*** SPOILER DOWN HERE ***\n\nThe lamest part was at the end, when the Emperor refused to sign a deal \nwith the Americans just because of Algren bringing back Katsumoto&#39;s \nsword. That was a bit like... mmmmhhhh... I was happy thou that Algren \nwent back to his girlfriend (Ok, ok, I know I&#39;m cheesy...)\n\nAnyway, good movie, and I&#39;ll buy the DVD as soon as it comes out.\ncepo\n\nOn Jan 10, 2004, at 7:48 AM, spud10000 wrote:\n\n&gt; I have just seen The Last Samurai. Anyone else seen it, and if so\n&gt; what did you think? I found it very emotional, which is strange,\n&gt; because I am not an emotional person.\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S How historically accurate was it?\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
