Also,\nsubmission of will to a higher lord is definitely\nsomething I think they could identify with. I&#39;d be\ncareful, though, in getting too wrapped up in\nBushido--Bushido is a peacetime compilation of ideals,\nand certainly not something every samurai ever lived\nup to, or even pretended to. It didn&#39;t come about\nuntil after the major civil war period was over, and\nmany see it as a justification for a warrior class\nthat had no wars left to fight. Not to say the ideals\naren&#39;t themselves good per se, just that it tends to\nget over-romanticized.\n\nNate\n\n--- Carmen Campo &lt;carmen_campo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Thanks, Nate/Thom.\n&gt; \n&gt; As christians we are all called to die to ourselves.\n&gt; So I can relate very\n&gt; well with the death poems of the samurai. I believe\n&gt; just like them that\n&gt; a good death is a glorious death when your will is\n&gt; fully surrendered and\n&gt; submitted to the One who gave His son to die for\n&gt; all. Dying is not an end \n&gt; at all but a beginning. But this might be scary for\n&gt; some westerners (I&#39;m\n&gt; from the east so that might explain something) so\n&gt; that&#39;s okay. Sorry, to bring\n&gt; the subject up here. But that&#39;s what amazes me most\n&gt; with the Samurai.\n&gt; I should read the Bushido next. I do admire them for\n&gt; their bravery and art\n&gt; and nobility. And christians could learn so much\n&gt; from them. I look at\n&gt; the cherry blossoms and I am humbled...\n&gt; \n&gt; carmen \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool.
