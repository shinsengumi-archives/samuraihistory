Where the split was, I\n&gt; don&#39;t know--I think it was when we ballooned in WWI,\n&gt; and you simply couldn&#39;t have that many generals\n&gt; waltzing around. \n\nI remember when I first read about Gettysburg (mumble) years ago, and was \nsurprised to find that Col. Strong Vincent was the brigade commander of the 3rd \nBde, 1st Div, 5th Corps. He was mortally wounded on Little Round Top and was \nmade a brevet brigadier, but didn&#39;t live to wear the star.  (He also went from \nLt1 to LCol overnight :) .)\n\n&gt; It&#39;s always bothered me that a Major General is lower\n&gt; than a Lieutenant General--then I learned that it used\n&gt; to be &quot;Sergeant-Major General&quot;, and the first part\n&gt; just got dropped, eventually. \n\nYeah... for several years I had that backwards, until I saw that little bit of \ntrivia and the light went on. (I *had* wondered why there was no &quot;captain \ngeneral&quot; (outside the Elizabethan navy :) ) and I&#39;m still annoyed that the \nranking general just gets a naked &quot;general.&quot; Since LtGen and MajGen are also \naddressed as &quot;general&quot; it just struck me as unfair.\n\nI miss the title &quot;field marshall.&quot; :)\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
