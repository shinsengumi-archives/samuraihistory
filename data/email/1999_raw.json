I guess I do fall into\nthat camp that does not consider Kazu-uchi-mono true samurai swords from\nthe artistic sense. In my reply I took a rather narrow view for the sake\nof brevity. Actually Yasukuni-to was very much a factory operation also.\nI really considered these to be kind of historical anomalies. I loved the\nsuggestion of the Masamune decendant visit. I had forgotten about him.\nThe Sano is a wonderful place is&#39;nt it.\n     There are so many good places to visit. My personal favorite is to\nvisit a temple during a &quot;flea market&quot;. I think Takahada Fudo on the third\nSunday of the month to be excellent. Oh well, this could go on forever. \nThanks Tom for stimulating my mind\nTom Armour\n\n________________________________________________________________\nThe best thing to hit the internet in years - Juno SpeedBand!\nSurf the web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!\nOnly $14.95/ month - visit www.juno.com to sign up today!\n\n"
