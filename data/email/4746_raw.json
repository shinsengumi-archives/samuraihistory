If it were a grade-school assignment, or even one from middle school, OK. But *university*?\n\nI&#39;ll bet that our 14-year old friend who recently joined the group would have no trouble explaining what a daimyo is.\n\nWill O&#39;Neil\n\nAt 00:07 7/4/2004, Cesare Polenghi wrote:\n&gt;On Jul 3, 2004, at 8:22 AM, idiotkid43 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; what is a Daimyo?

While I \n&gt;think that most of us takes pride in being capable to help with \n&gt;specific issues, I believe that users with a very BASIC question should \n&gt;do their homework first, and then come here and ask questions.\n&gt;To ask what was a daimyo is a bit like asking what was a European \n&gt;feudal lord. It&#39;s a VERY generic, broad question, and accordingly there \n&gt;is PLENTY of information about it.\n&gt;idiotkid43, use google, or GO TO THE LIBRARY of your university, and \n&gt;then come back with more specific questions, and perhaps with some \n&gt;greetings and signature at the end of your message.\n&gt;cheers,\n&gt;cepo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: &lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: &lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;--- \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
