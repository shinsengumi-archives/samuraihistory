I reckon there is a great research project waiting\nhere for someone who&#39;s prepared to study Japanese sources and compare what\nwas happening in Japan with military developments in Europe.\n\n&gt; Everyone is usually familiar with Nagashino\n&gt; (1575) and the rotating firing system, and it is often\n&gt; used as an example of this before it appears in\n&gt; Europe.\n\nNo, this is just not the case. Rotation of ranks, firing by &#39;introduction&#39;,\n&#39;extraduction&#39; or whatever you want to call it was already happening in\nEurope. In fact it was the only effective way that ranks of\narquebusiers/musketeers could keep up a steady stream of fire. Volley or\n&#39;salvo&#39; (ie firing all ranks together) could be devastating if troops held\ntheir nerve, but was risky since there would now be a time lapse before they\nhad all reloaded.\n\n&gt; At Nagashino we see 3000 (though some\n&gt; recent scholarly debate has asserted the number was\n&gt; closer to 1000)\n\nEven 3000 would still be a very small percentage of Nobunaga&#39;s army (less\nthan 10%). Most European armies would have had a higher percentage of\nfirearms than that. Perhaps it was the combination of arquebusiers with\narchers plus obstacles (?).\nPerhaps the heavy rain the previous night was decisive (remember the French\nknights floundering in the mud at Agincourt?). Nobunaga&#39;s use of obstacles\nmay have been a stroke of genius, but even this has already been used in\nEurope to great effect during the Italian Wars 50 years previous.\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n"
