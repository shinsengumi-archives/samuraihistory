In his own book BOOK OF FIVE\nRINGS, he listed his ancestry, and he most definitely qualified. \n \nI&#39;ve seen the &quot;Samurai&quot; series of movies (directed by Inagaki, starring\nMifune). One of the huge inaccuracies of this series is the idea that\nMiyamoto Musashi started life out as a farmer and &quot;became&quot; a samurai. Not\ntrue. Most of the sources that I have consulted about the life of Miyamoto\nMusashi state that the details of his early life are sketchy. It seems that\nhe was born and grew up in a farming village. But he was the son of a ronin\nwho taught fencing in the village; he was not the son of a farmer. A ronin\nwasn&#39;t connected with a clan and many times had little status in the scheme\nof things. But still, he was a member of the bushi or samurai class. \n \nJust my 2 mon here. If I&#39;m wrong, feel free to correct me.\n \nNina\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Sensei J.
