Saya clashing (saya-biki? I can&#39;t remember the \nterm) was an unforgivable offence and when it happened swords \nwould be drawn instantly - effectively it was an invitation to \na duel.\n\n&#39;Gunsliger&#39; type samurai would strut round the streets with the \nsword worn almost flat across the stomach so the saya stuck out \nas far as possible to the side. More restrained samurai would \nwear their swords something over 45 degrees across the body - \nutilising the curve of the blade to keep the saya to the rear \nas much as possible, whilst a small move of the left hand on \nthe saya would move the butt of the hilt towards a potential \nenemy to the front, ready for a draw.\n\nI saw a lovely move by a venerable old iai master who showed a \nway to avoid this unfortunate occurance:\n\nLeft hand sits naturally on top of the saya just below the \nhilt, thumb next to belly, knuckles facing out. As the \n&#39;gunslinger&#39; (or should that be saya slinger?) approaches, just \nbefore the clash, the old man tightens his grip, turns the \nknuckles downward and at the same time pulls his fist up \ntowards his shoulder. This action &#39;screws&#39; in his saya and the \nsword ends up held close in and parallel to the body, thus \navoiding the clash!\n\nBad guy, who missed the move, also having missed his mark, \nstumbles uncertainly and the old boy then draws his sword and \ncuts him down with ease!\n\nIt&#39;s all in a day&#39;s work.\n\nTom\n\n\n\n"
