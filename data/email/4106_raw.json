In terms of the question itself, surely\na leader (anywhere) could be both dictator and unifier, they are not\nmutually exclusive terms.\n&gt; Sprouting from the term &#39;unifier&#39; though I have a question? When was Japan\nunified? Considering, Hokkaiko was really only geographically part of Japan\nuntil the 18th and 19th Centuries, despite incursions and expeditions into\nthe north dating back to the Asuka-jidai, and before; while the Nansei (SW)\nIslands (Okinawa, etc) were not part of Japan until the first decades of the\nEdo-jidai.\n&gt;\n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Anthony J.
