I have \nread all of your osprey Samurai titles and intend to buy the \nhistorical game &quot;Sengoku&quot;.  The inspiration for purchasing your \nbooks was the film &quot;Kagemusha&quot; by Kurosawa (probably \nalready know that).  Although I have read many historical fiction \nstories and watched a whole crapload of Samurai films, \nKagemusha made me want to know exactly what happened.  \nYour writing is clear, concise, and direct.  I deeply appreciate \nyour contribution to my education and the western knowledge of \nJapanese history.  Maybe Shadowhawke should take to reading \nsome of your books to better educate himself with the lineage of \nthe Shogun.  He&#39;s only off by a few hundred years and a few \nhundred Shogun.\nNow here&#39;s my spin on his question...  If you were playing \nSengoku which daimyo would you play as?\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@i...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; shadowhawke666 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My first choice, Ieyasu Tokugawa was the first Shogun of \nJapan; according to my research, he united Japan; I could \nelaborate but in fairness this could be a seperate e-mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Um. No. He was the first shogun of the Tokugawa line. Hardly \nthe first.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      My second choice, Erwin Rommel, known as the Desert \nFox, again according to my research, was one of Hitler&#39;s \nsmartest generals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Who had to commit suicide.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frankly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to be one of Hitler&#39;s *anything* \nregardless of his career.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        There you have my answer to the question, what&#39;s your \nanswer?\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know what to make of the question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would I want to live his life, or be myself in his position? If the \nlatter, chances are my choices and actions would be different, \nthus producing a different ultimate picture. At what point do I \n&quot;step in&quot; to someone&#39;s\n&gt; life and take over?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, these type of questions annoy me. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n\n"
