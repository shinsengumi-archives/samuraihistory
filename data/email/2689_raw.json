No, by following the\nBushido you are NOT a samurai, you are a\ndissillusioned individual.\nThe samurai were not &quot;outlawed&quot; as some people like to\nbelieve, they had their status removed. Which means\nthat if you were a samurai before the bakumatsu, you\nwere NOT still a samurai in the Meiji era. The only\npossible exception might be Saigo Takamori and the\nSatsuma Rebellion. Listen, no one today is a samurai.\nAnd its really sad to think of yourself as one just\nbecause you follow a code of ethics from the lowest\nperiod in the history of the samurai.\nThat being said it is great that you follow martial\narts, I do so myself. And I&#39;d be interested in hearing\nwhat all you have to know about the historical\nsamurai.\n--- kyosuke_miyamoto &lt;kyosuke_miyamoto@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Hello Everyone, Im Kyosuke. I&#39;m new to the forum and\n&gt; all, but I know \n&gt; a great lot about samurai, weapons, and ancient\n&gt; japan. I myself, \n&gt; follow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real\n&gt; life Samurai, though \n&gt; Samurai&#39;s have been outlawed since the late 1800&#39;s,\n&gt; I still consider \n&gt; myself one. I&#39;ve been to Japan, and studied the\n&gt; fighting skills from \n&gt; Sensei Ichi Hayamatsu, learned the old culture and\n&gt; the respects. And \n&gt; with this, I&#39;ve become a Samurai. I want to be the\n&gt; one to say how Im \n&gt; honored in joining this forum, and expect a lot of\n&gt; great stuff from \n&gt; you all as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; That is all.\n&gt; -Kyosuke Miyamoto\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. Im also A fanatic of old Samurai Movies. If\n&gt; you&#39;d like we can \n&gt; talk of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
