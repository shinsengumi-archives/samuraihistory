I&#39;m trying to think of an \n&gt;historical illustration of this... Can&#39;t. Does anyone else know of a restoration of a class through \n&gt;revolt or law? In The Three Musketeers, this happens with the Musketeers. But that&#39;s fiction, \n&gt;and the Musketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there might be some parallels). Lookin&#39; for a real \n&gt;historical example...\n&gt;\n&gt;Here&#39;s a different idea...\n&gt;In India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real everyday life, the caste \n&gt;system is just as real as it was before the laws. The law only serves its purpose if people obey \n&gt;it, or if it is enforced. So it is theoretically possible, also, that descendents of samurai could \n&gt;claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would for all intents and \n&gt;purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished. Of course, what a samurai \n&gt;today would do or be is ... well... difficult to imagine. Maybe they would carry two guns instead \n&gt;of two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police force.\n&gt;\n&gt;Theoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the abolishment of the \n&gt;samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public still regarded them as \n&gt;samurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. (Governments often act in an \n&gt;inconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, would that group of \n&gt;people still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?\n&gt;\n&gt;I think they would. \n&gt;\n&gt;This has some parallel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man and woman &quot;shack up&quot; \n&gt;for an extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though they have never \n&gt;exchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man and wife. That was \n&gt;common practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eventually recognized this and would \n&gt;after said elapse of time pronounce them legally man and wife (so the government could get \n&gt;additional taxes out of them).\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the government acknowledged \n&gt;them to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one man and wife. It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many \n&gt;cultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of paper&quot; from the government to confirm or legitimize the marriage. \n&gt;Public practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal action. \n&gt;\n&gt;So what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public acceptance, apart from \n&gt;law, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw marriage or the Indian caste \n&gt;system), how much of the public would it take to justify that claim? What&#39;s the critical mass \n&gt;required for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in the samurai&#39;s heyday, \n&gt;there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as it was. Maybe 51%? A simple \n&gt;majority? Who decides what the percentage would be?\n&gt;\n&gt;All this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today... but theoretically, it&#39;s possible.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Konnichi wa, tomodachi\n&gt;&gt; This is going to seem as if I am against samurai, which I am not. I am\n&gt;&gt; rather intrigued by them, in their day. Follow me on this for a moment\n&gt;&gt; if you will...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; When Slavery was abolished in the United States, there were people who\n&gt;&gt; still thought slavery was a good idea, and people who didn&#39;t. After\n&gt;&gt; the abolishment of slavery, for the most part, former slave owners\n&gt;&gt; rarely went about saying they were members of a class that proudly\n&gt;&gt; owned other human beings and had the right to life or death over them.\n&gt;&gt; The law didn&#39;t allow that any more, and for the most part, and the\n&gt;&gt; general populace would not stand for that. The abolishment was drilled\n&gt;&gt; into the public psyche, as was the concept that slave owners were not\n&gt;&gt; needed in a changed society, and that all races and classes should be\n&gt;&gt; free and theoretically equal. Owning slaves was made not-noble.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Samurai had an equal right of life or death over those of lesser\n&gt;&gt; class, held all of the benefits of the current society, and when\n&gt;&gt; Samurai were abolished, the general psyche of the public thought they\n&gt;&gt; were as un-needed as slave owners were in the U.S.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; So I suppose one could say they were still slave owners if they were\n&gt;&gt; the descendants of slave owners...but the public would not look kindly\n&gt;&gt; on that, nor would I suspect the public would look kindly on Samurai.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; There were good samurai, and the parts of samurai life that were noble\n&gt;&gt; should be celebrated but lets not forget it was a package deal. - just\n&gt;&gt; like there were, I suppose, some good slave owners, but the society\n&gt;&gt; evolved around them.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Just other thoughts...\n&gt;&gt; Christopher \n&gt;&gt; (who celebrates the good parts of samurai life, but is aware there are\n&gt;&gt; bad ones...)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; So theoretically the descendants of the samurai class could\n&gt;&gt; therefore still consider themselves to be samurai, although not with a\n&gt;&gt; legal foundation, with the laws enacted during the Meiji Restoration\n&gt;&gt; being formulated by the winners, if not nessarily/hypothetically those\n&gt;&gt; in the &#39;right&#39; ??\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Just a thought\n&gt;&gt; &gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;&gt; --- \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
