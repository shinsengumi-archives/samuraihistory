I have a question about koku. If someone was retained at 1500 bushel=\r\ns of rice, what exactly does that mean? Is it equivalent to being hired at =\r\n$15,000 a year? In other words the retainer would be given coin to the valu=\r\ne of 1500 bushels or rice..  Was that amount given in one lump sum, or was =\r\nit parceled out during the year?\n\nWhat I&#39;m after is to understand how koku =\r\nactually worked within Japan at the time.\n\nThank you\n\n\n"
