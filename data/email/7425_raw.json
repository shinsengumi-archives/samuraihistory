The visiting party was too late to acquire \nthe necessary firearms and blue powder certificates to allow this to \nhappen.\nSacred\nThe visitors were entertained at a reception in the Armouries before \ninspecting the exhibition of objects connected to Lord Tokugawa.\nThe Mayor of Ashikita, Kazunari Takezaki, said through an \ninterpreter: &quot;We do not have this sort of brilliant museum in Japan.&quot;\nHe is due to meet the Lord Mayor of Leeds at a reception next \nTuesday.\nAshikita is a small town of 22,000 people surrounded by mountains \nand is noted for its oranges.\nGraeme Rimer said the musket was introduced to Japan by Portuguese \ntraders in 1543 and its importance was recognised by Tokugawa.\nBut after he brought peace to his country for 200 years its use fell \naway in favour of traditional weapons.\nThe Armouries exhibition is the result of cooperation with its twin, \nthe Nikko Toshogu Shrine north of Tokyo.\nIt is the first time many of the artefacts have been allowed into \nthe west. So precious and sacred are certain works of art that a \nShinto priest from the shrine is present throughout the exhibition.\nA war fan belonging to a 16th century general has been loaned by the \nOsaka Castle Museum. It has been compared to Nelson&#39;s telescope in \nits iconic significance.\n30 July 2005\n\n\n\n"
