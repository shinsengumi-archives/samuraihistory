Hoyle&quot; &lt;matthewhoyle@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; So it was unthinkable for a samurai to fall in love\n&gt; with either a geisha\n&gt; or more likely a courtesan, and then marry her ?\n\nThe key there is the word *marry*. Yes, for the most\npart it was unthinkable. A samurai could visit a\ncourtesan, patronize her, could buy her contract and\nmake her his exclusively, but wouldn&#39;t *marry* her.\nWhy would he? Marriage was for begetting heirs and\ntying your family to other families--what advantage is\nthere in marrying someone with no family, and who&#39;s\nlack of family would be detrimental to any offspring\nyou have? DOn&#39;t make the assumption that love and\nmarriage have anything to do with each other. There\nwas absolutely no shame in a married samurai\npatronizing a prostitute. He could have his cake and\neat it too--what would he gain from marrying someone\nwho was only good at sex, and not at household\nfinances or raising children, like a samurai bride\nwould be? \n\n&gt; Besides that this does bring up an interesting\n&gt; question. What exactly is\n&gt; a &quot;samurai woman&quot;, I presume the samurai were only\n&gt; allowed to marry\n&gt; within their own class, but I would not be surprised\n&gt; if a bunch of them\n&gt; ignored that rule. \n\nAgain, why ignore that rule? No reason to. If a\nsamurai fell  in &quot;love&quot; (lust, whatever) with a\npeasant woman, a courtesan, or whatever, then he&#39;d\nhave sex with her, patronize her, whatever, but\nthere&#39;s no compulsion to marry her. It&#39;s not like\nshe&#39;d be &quot;damaged goods&quot; after having an affair with\nsomeone of a higher social class---might even improve\nher standing. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
