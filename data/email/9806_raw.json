They said SENGOKU JIDAI,  War Days, =\r\nTurbulent ages.\n  Among so many kings of warriors, they used to have Great =\r\nTwo.\n  Takeda Shingen  versus  Uesugi Kensin.\n  Great two used to make wars=\r\n , 16 times.  \n  After those those big two were dead,  Oda Nobunaga  came u=\r\np and \nthrough conjective wars agains other kings of warriors, he came to \n=\r\nruin all most  all Japan .   After he was killed by his \nsobordinate , name=\r\nd Akechi  Mitsuhide just  a few days before he is \ngoing to Emperor palace =\r\nto get SHogun status who can have power to \ncontrol all kings of warriors u=\r\nnder government,  Toyotomi Hideyoshi \nwho was another subordinate of Oda ,k=\r\nilled Akechi Mistsuhide and \nruined all Japan.   He could not become Shogun=\r\n even he ruined \ncompletely due to the facts his ancestor was farmers.\n  Du=\r\nring his ruin, he tried to conquer Korea and invaded several \ntimes for not=\r\nhing.  He failed and waisted man powers and financial \nthings.  After he di=\r\ned,  Tokugawa Ieyasu came up and succeeded \nHideyosi  and became SHOGUN  un=\r\nder the official nomination by \nEmperor because his  ancestors  were Genji =\r\ngroup which were the \ndescendants  of  Emperor  Seiwa.  He organized new Ba=\r\nkufu ,  \nGovernment in Edo and  was succeeded by 25 generations for almost =\r\n\n300 years.\n\n  Do you have any question ?\n Please feel free to ask me .\n\n  =\r\nEddie  Hiramoto\n  \n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Dowling &lt;=\r\nvaevictis@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi their history fans!\n&gt;  \n&gt; While I have bee=\r\nn a member of this group for a few months now, I \nhave been unable to find =\r\nthe time to express why I have found the \neurge to join this band of brothe=\r\nrs. Well chaps, allow me to reveal \nmy purpose like a shoji door. Next year=\r\n (Sept 09), I plan to begin \nmy Phd at the University of Bristol where I ha=\r\nve recieved a BA and \nan MA in Ancient History. My Phd will be a comparison=\r\n between the \nwarriors of Homer&#39;s Iliad (Troy etc the ancient history part)=\r\n and \nthe warriors of 16th century Japan.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Here are a few area&#39;s im pa=\r\nrticularly interested by with this \nstudy:\n&gt; \n&gt; Divine weapons, and there p=\r\nroperties which affect/alter/enhance \nthe bearer\n&gt; The interaction/ interfe=\r\nrance of gods. spirits, Kami etc to \nwarriors\n&gt; Glory, shame and honour in =\r\nboth cultures\n&gt; Warrior Cultures in general\n&gt; Who commands who? The General=\r\n&#39;s or the famous warriors?\n&gt;  \n&gt; If anyone knows of any good points, or wou=\r\nld like to offer \ndifferent suggestions of comparison of these cultures, or=\r\n feel any \nother knowledge could help in this investigation, that would be =\r\na \ngrand help.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks (domo arigato)\n&gt; Tom \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _____=\r\n____________________________________________________________\n&gt; Make a mini =\r\nyou and download it into Windows Live Messenger\n&gt; http://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/=\r\ngo/111354029/direct/01/\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been r=\r\nemoved]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
