(para \nphrasing)\n\nCharged because enemy army threatened his rear.\nBecause Katsuyori was a young man and over confident in his army.\nAll Takeda Nija scouts had been killed before reporting depth of \nenemy position.\nRainy season obscured view.\nMost interesting he refers to documentation that says there were only \n1500 gunners and not 3000, and possibly only 1000. so gunnery was NOT \ndecisive.\nHe discusses topography and excavations at the site as well as style \nof warfare at the time.\nAfter the first cavalry charge, its likely the samurai would have \ndismounted and fought in the style traditional with the times, on \nfoot, supported by retainers. (this was done to avoid guns)\nAfter all they now knew the problems in crossing the battle field on \nhorseback from the first failed charge.\n\nIf you need more info, let me know. I actually have the book with me \nhere at work.\nGood excuse to start reading it, it was only published last week I \nthink.\n\nHope that helps\n\nKind regards\n\nRob\nWarhammer Historical General Manager\nrobb@...\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; In hindsight, it&#39;s obvious...you retreat. You have\n&gt; 15,000, the combined Oda-Tokugawa army has\n&gt; 38,000...you don&#39;t fight with that force ratio. I know\n&gt; the Takeda cavalry corps was superior, etc., etc. It\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter. You have half your army engaged in the\n&gt; North against Kenshin, why lose the other half against\n&gt; Nobunaga?
