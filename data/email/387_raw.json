Daito ryu more\nspecifically.\nIn our art, the hakama is gifted to a shodan. It is believed by our shihan\nthat the hakama was worn for both ceremony and ease of movement for combat\nin an &quot;in-house&quot; circumstance.\nIn another art there may have been different traditions or circumstances\nsurrounding its use.\nHowever, regardless of any one teaching, you must consider the fact that the\nhakama was Japanese, not the tool of martial arts. It was worn by\npractitioners and &quot;lay&quot; folk alike. Martial arts all stemmed from India and\ndeveloped into numerous styles over many generations throughout all of the\norient, taking on various characteristics by each major clan and teacher.\nThe hakama was just a garment that simply followed the Japanese during their\nday, and when one clan broke from another ... or one family divided and\nbecame two ... when they moved on they took their hakamas with them. Perhaps\nafter the fact each determined that it had certain combative attributes. Who\ncan truly say?\nI know that YOU weren&#39;t there any more than Eric was, so certainly you can&#39;t\nanswer the question with any more authority than he could.\nIn any case, people have different reasons for the things they think and\nbelieve, and not all of it is rootless. Unless YOU are the expert on all\nthese matters, which I do not believe you are, try to have a little\nsensitivity in rebuking information you BELIEVE is incorrect.\n\nAlex\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;KUM0&quot; &lt;kum0@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 26, 2001 6:22 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: The ignorant\n\n\n&gt; Mr. Baker,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am sorry\n&gt;\n&gt; Do not be sorry, for you cannot change. And would not where it even for\nthe better.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years\n&gt; &gt; of my life.\n&gt;\n&gt; A commendable time spent learning. Kudos.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have to disagree.  There are all kinds\n&gt; &gt; of ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise movement\n&gt; &gt; or position.  This is simply not true.\n&gt;\n&gt; Did you invent the Hakama and devise it&#39;s uses? I believe that you didn&#39;t.\nYou only know of it&#39;s uses inside Budo as you learn it,\n&gt; and are in no position to comment on any other arts uses of the hakama.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Samurai\n&gt; &gt; when going in to combat without armor preffered to\n&gt; &gt; were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.\n&gt;\n&gt; As does anybody with an ounce of common sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This\n&gt; &gt; allowed full movement without tripping on the hakama\n&gt; &gt; itself.(anyone who practices Aikido has had this\n&gt; &gt; happen)\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree. This I have seen for myself.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; When wearing armor they didn&#39;t even wear\n&gt; &gt; hakama so it did not apply.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I don&#39;t believe that this paragraph has anything atall to do with\nthe subject matter being discussed.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Word &quot;ninja&quot; is not hstorically correct and\n&gt; &gt; neither is their movie incarnation.  They were usually\n&gt; &gt; reffered to as Shinobi and originally were not as\n&gt; &gt; specialized as the movies make them appear.  They were\n&gt; &gt; used to set fire to enemy encampments and castles in\n&gt; &gt; order to cause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they would\n&gt; &gt; be employed to kill.  But I have heard of very few if\n&gt; &gt; any cases with the latter.  A good book on the subject\n&gt; &gt; of the origin and truths behind the &quot;Ninja&quot; is Stephen\n&gt; &gt; Turnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold of and\n&gt; &gt; has to be ordered from Europe but is worth the price.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are alot of myths regarding the history of the\n&gt; &gt; Martial arts.(Ninja Especially)\n&gt;\n&gt; Who mentioned movies? Who mentioned historically correct details regarding\nthe ninja? How would you be an authority on the ninja?\n&gt; You study Budo by your own admission. It is very rude by every cultures\nbeliefs to denounce that of which you are ignorant.\n&gt;\n&gt; And ignorant of such matters you are.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether the term &quot;Ninja&quot; appeared in Japan  _ever_  is no matter. Nowdays\nit is an accepted layman&#39;s term. Whether you like it or\n&gt; not. And the world will use it without you.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have respect for the way of Bu, but not for you, because you are\nignorant, and have no respect for anything but your own\n&gt; &quot;knowledge&quot;. Of which you probably know nothing outside of Budo teachings,\nand the odd bit of book reading here or there by authors\n&gt; who are also no authority on the subjects which they publish books on.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is my last comment on the matter on the list, if you wish to comment\nyouself, which you no doubt would accept to do without\n&gt; thought, then you have my e-mail address and have my invitation to mail me\npersonally for any reason.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kumo.\n&gt;\n&gt; Natsu Kusa Ya\n&gt; Tsuamono Domo Ga\n&gt; Yume No Ato\n&gt;\n&gt; Basho Matsuo.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;\n&gt; From: erik baker\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am sorry but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years\n&gt; &gt; of my life.

Bryant, Both of\n&gt; &gt; these are good.  There was really nothing mysterious\n&gt; &gt; about it.  If you look at the clothing from the yayoi\n&gt; &gt; period forward you will see similarity&#39;s leading to\n&gt; &gt; the advent of the Hakama.  The Japanese as with every\n&gt; &gt; othr nation were very practical in the development of\n&gt; &gt; their clothing.  A good example of this is the Long\n&gt; &gt; Hakama worn in the Shoguns palace during the Tokugawa\n&gt; &gt; period which restricted movement making attacks on\n&gt; &gt; others impossible.  Also the short hakama worn in the\n&gt; &gt; Summer by some foot soldiers and attendants in the\n&gt; &gt; kamakura period.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Musashi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; P.s.

Nevertheless samurai were more or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; less obliged to follow the &quot;rich and famous&quot; status\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the court they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; implicated in.
