I think it is \n&gt; if \n&gt; the death of one can prevent the suffering of many.  Sometimes you \n&gt; have to cut the cancer out to save the patient.  If you don&#39;t, it \n&gt; will spread until its evil pollutes all of mankind.\n\nAnd here opens the philosophical can of worms.  In this group, it \nwould be assumed we should define &#39;justifiable homocide&#39; by the \nhistorical application of Japan&#39;s internal and external conflicts.  \nIt would probably be the best way to answer, especially in the face \nof solipsistic and existential mindsets (to name two out of dozens).\n\nAlbeit, we all have our own opinions.  \n\n&gt;I think \n&gt; the leaders of that time wanted justice for the Russo-Japanese war \n&gt; treaties that America had mediated.  \n\nIn part, Japan&#39;s assault on Pearl Harbor was motivated the United \nStates&#39; discontinuation of oil exports to Japan.  In effect, you \ncould postulate America was responsible for the attack on Pearl \nHarbor by practicing aggressive isolationism (I define aggressive \nisolationism as the act of maintaining a neutral stance in a war \nwhile providing the war-time equipment and supply requirements of the \nwarring nations).  We provided for England, to a degree.  We allowed \nour soldiers to volunteer for service in a European front in \nunofficial capacities.  We decreased or ceased importing and \nexporting with nations in order to preserve our stockpiles, for the \nmost part, though, in agreement with you, there were probably more \nintricate politics involved.\n\nFor Japan, loss of oil imports from us wasn&#39;t immediately crippling, \nbut it was a potential blow to their economic future.  Japan was, by \nall rights, defending their interests by engaging in war.\n\nI&#39;m babbling a bit and slipping off-topic, but the main point deals \nwith a comment made on the &#39;justness&#39; or &#39;unjustness&#39; of war.  \nA &#39;just war&#39;, by definition, is one in which the people of a \nparticular nation feel they were ethically correct in taking \naggressive action.  This can apply to both the victorious and the \ndefeated, depending on the perspective you want to defend.  When you \nsaid a war to take out a single individual to preserve the safety of \nothers was morally just, which view point were you taking?  While I \ndon&#39;t agree with their values or politics, the terrorists and their \nsupporters feel they are right in the eyes of God (Allah, God, \nJehovah, Yahweh, the Kami...however you need to define it.  They feel \nthey are right in the eyes of the/a higher power).\n\nWho determines which side is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;just&quot;?\n\nEr, and I apologize for going a bit OT in this post.  Some of the \nlines from your original post were stuck in my head and I hadn&#39;t \ninitially intended to reply to them.\n\n-Matt\n \n\n\n\n\n"
