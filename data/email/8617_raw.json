I dont own it yet, but it I would\n&gt; love to have in on  the coffee table because it\n&gt; looks impressive. Supposedly, it is a  history of\n&gt; the spear from the naginata-yari. It is really the\n&gt; only book  I have seen on just the spear class of\n&gt; weapons in Japan.\n&gt;   \n&gt;   Jonathan\n&gt; \n&gt; Wazza &lt;biz_in_japan@...&gt; wrote:        Hi\n&gt; all,\n&gt;   \n&gt;   Long time lurker here, thanks to all for all the\n&gt; info, it&#39;s\n&gt;   helped with quite a bit with some of my studies at\n&gt; uni.\n&gt;   \n&gt;   Anyway on to my question:\n&gt;   \n&gt;   I&#39;ve been doing a bit of research on samurai\n&gt; weapons and\n&gt;   came across this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yari\n&gt; \n&gt;   If anyone has the time, could they tell me how\n&gt; accurate it\n&gt;   is?  \n&gt;   \n&gt;   In most of my samurai books, they don&#39;t have much\n&gt; detail\n&gt;   about yari and I really hate to use Wikipedia\n&gt; because of\n&gt;   the amount of pure crap that&#39;s on it.\n&gt;   \n&gt;   Cheers,\n&gt;   Warren\n&gt;   \n&gt;   ------------\n&gt;   Be seeing you  (O_O)\n&gt;   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n/----------------------------------------------------------------------&#92;\n&gt;   CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER\n&gt;   \n&gt; Information in this transmission is intended only\n&gt; for the person(s)  to whom it is addressed and may\n&gt; contain privileged and/or confidential  information.\n&gt; \n&gt;   If you are not the intended recipient, any\n&gt; disclosure, copying or  dissemination of the\n&gt; information is unauthorised and you should \n&gt; delete/destroy all copies and notify the sender. \n&gt;   No liability is accepted for any unauthorised use\n&gt; of the information contained in this transmission.\n&gt;   Any breaches of the above shall render you liable\n&gt; to the judgement of Nyarlathotep.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&#92;----------------------------------------------------------------------/\n&gt;   \n&gt;   \n&gt;         \n&gt;   \n&gt;         \n&gt;               \n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt;   On Yahoo!7 \n&gt;   Messenger - Make free PC-to-PC calls to your\n&gt; friends overseas. \n&gt;   http://au.messenger.yahoo.com \n&gt;   \n&gt;           \n&gt; \n&gt;     ---\n&gt;   Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt;   http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;   \n&gt;   Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;   Samurai Archives store:\n&gt; http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;   ---  \n&gt; \n&gt;                       \n&gt; \n&gt;           SPONSORED LINKS    \n&gt;                                                     \n&gt;    Samurai                                         \n&gt; Japan                                          Japan\n&gt; airline                                             \n&gt;                                \n&gt;         \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;     YAHOO!
