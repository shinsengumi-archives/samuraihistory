He said it himself that he should have died so many times before. He obviously was shot up pretty good. He could barely walk or bow while in the Emperor&#39;s prescence. Imagine how hard it must have been for him to climb those steps to the palace with those injuries. . \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Diane \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, January 16, 2004 4:37 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: The Last Samurai\n\n\n  well, i guess you cannot have the lead character killed otherwise\n  there would have been no closure to the story\n\n\n  --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sara Cooper&quot;\n  &lt;saracooper22@h...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; He was complaining about how Algren wasn&#39;t killed by the gattling\n  gun.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt;From: &quot;whill4&quot; &lt;whill4@y...&gt;\n  &gt; &gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt; &gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt; &gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: The Last Samurai\n  &gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 13 Jan 2004 02:19:11 -0000\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;  he made me realize that the part with the gattling gun\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; was unrealistic.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;What did your friend not like about the gatling gun scene?
