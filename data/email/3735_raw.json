Rather, I&#39;m just pointing out that there are always people an organizations who eagerly manipulate people&#39;s beliefs for their own profit.\n\n-Thom \n&gt; Hey.\n&gt;         It&#39;s not necessarily a need, per se, unless you look at it that the \n&gt; missionaries were simply doing what their faith/religion commanded them to do \n&gt; in spreading their message &quot;to the ends of the earth&quot;.  From the Japanese \n&gt; standpoint, it certainly wasn&#39;t necessary.  8-)!
