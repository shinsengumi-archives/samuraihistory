But facing death from a comfortable castle  -- which is\nwhere Yamamoto was situated when he wrote &quot;Hagakure&quot; is not the same as\nfacing death under direct attack, such as in a battle against an enemy who\nis using swords, spears, guns, other weapons against you. Or facing death\nwhen your castle has been confiscated, your lord has died via seppuku at the\nShogun&#39;s order, and you are on the outside without clan or master -- and it\nis your duty to avenge him.  \n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of james wilson\nSent: Thursday, October 06, 2005 11:14 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: hitokiri kawakami gensai?\n\nHello Ms. Nina but isnt everyday to live is to face death?

There would be plenty of\nargument\n&gt; here over the issue of what makes a &quot;good&quot; samurai. Is it skill in\nweaponry?\n&gt; Is it courage? Is it loyalty? Is it general character? \n&gt; \n&gt; Nina Boal\n\nAs long as it doesn&#39;t involve &quot;who followed Bushido the best&quot;...\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAaaah, don&#39;t get me started on &quot;bushido.&quot; I may raise a few hackles with the\nfollowing, but one of my pet, pet peeves is someone quoting from &quot;Hagakure&quot;\nby Yamamoto Tsunetomo as if this were THE definitive manual on &quot;bushido.&quot; I\nkeep hearing people quote from this work, especially the famous line, &quot;the\nway of the samurai is facing death.&quot;\n\nIn the first place, Yamamoto wrote this treatise as a private correspondence\nto members of his clan. It never was intended to be read by the general\npublic in feudal Japan, much less by people all over the world in many\nlanguages.\n\nBut more importantly, in my humble(?) opinion, Yamamoto had never been in a\nbattle and thus knew nothing first-hand about facing death. He lived in a\npeaceful castle during the 18th centurey, some of the most peaceful times in\nJapanese history. It&#39;s not that difficult to write stuff about how a samurai\nshould face death when ensconced in a place where facing death doesn&#39;t come\ninto the equation of one&#39;s existence at all.  \n\nIf anyone wants to know about facing death, read some of the accounts by the\n47 Asano retainers who avenged their lord (whom Yamamoto had the temerity to\ncriticize from his own relatively comfortable spot). Or else read any\naccount from any common battlefield soldier in history, one from Japan or\nfrom any other country.\n\nNina\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com Samurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS\nJapanese translation Japanese incense Japanese print Japanese business\nJapanese yen Samurai swords \n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
