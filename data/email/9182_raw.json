Lord Byron has a \n&gt; statue in =\r\nGreece erected to him not because he was a great poet \nbut \n&gt; because he he=\r\nlped liberate Greece from the Turks. Musashi wrote \nbooks \n&gt; and was an exc=\r\nellent painter. Etc. Etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt;\n\nFirst, I don&#39;t remember saying=\r\n it was sissy.  I said it contrasted.  \nSecond, I don&#39;t recall Julius Ceasa=\r\nr&#39;s &quot;Ode to a Summer Morning&quot; or \nRichard the Lionheart&#39;s &quot;Study of Roses.&quot;=\r\n  The point I&#39;m making, it \nshows duality but not all warrior cultures high=\r\nly prize artistic \nexpression, especially among the warriors.  Lastly, samu=\r\nrais were \nwarriors.  Japan, of this time, was under a feudal system.  In a=\r\n \nfeudal society, warriors always maintain the highest rung in \nsociety.  W=\r\nith that said, I asked what was their choice of \nentertainment.  Within tha=\r\nt, I mentioned training and the playing of \nshogi.  Those can&#39;t be the only=\r\n examples of war like entertainment.  \nUnlike Rome, the samurai, in particu=\r\nalr before the edo period, \nprepared for war constantly and were measured m=\r\nore by prowess in \ncombat.  Yet, they didn&#39;t relish in bloodshed as much as=\r\n their Roman \ncounterparts.  There has to be some other examples.  Drinking=\r\n, \nwomanizing, and gambling: I don&#39;t view these as war like \nentertainment =\r\nbecause all males participate.  I&#39;m sure wealth \nmerchants endulged as much=\r\n if not more then the samurai.\n\n\n\n\n"
