SHP will focus on the history \nand culture o=\r\nf the great men of the Meiji Restoration.\n\nThe Meiji Restoration was one of=\r\n the most important events in Asian \nhistory, and one of the greatest revol=\r\nutions in the history of the \nworld. It centered around the overthrow of th=\r\ne Tokugawa Shogunate in \n1868, and the restoration of political power to th=\r\ne emperor.\n\nMid-19th-century Japan was a caldron of political upheaval and =\r\n\nintrigue, bloody inner-fighting among samurai, and the end of three \ncentu=\r\nries of feudalism under shogunal rule. This most enthralling age \nin the an=\r\nnals of Japan brought forth some of the most fascinating men \nin that natio=\r\nn&#39;s history. These samurai modernized Japan. They also \nlaid the foundation=\r\n for the militarism of WWII and the economic \npowerhouse of today. Close sc=\r\nrutiny of these two-sworded men provides \ninsight into the political, cultu=\r\nral and psychological roots of \nmodern Japan. Just as the Meiji Restoration=\r\n is considered &quot;the dawn \nof modern Japan,&quot; knowledge of this history is es=\r\nsential for \nunderstanding how and why Japan has evolved into the nation th=\r\nat it \nis today.\n\nPurpose of Samurai History Papers - the only serial publi=\r\ncation in \nEnglish focusing on the history and culture of the great men of =\r\nthe \nMeiji Restoration\n\nThe Meiji Restoration has often been neglected and/=\r\nor misrepresented \nby writers of the English language. When this history ha=\r\ns been \nrepresented seriously and accurately, it has generally been in a dr=\r\ny \nacademic format. Since the publication of his first book, RYOMA =AD Life=\r\n \nof a Renaissance Samurai, it has been the objective of Romulus \nHillsboro=\r\nugh to present this most fascinating period in Japanese \nhistory, and the h=\r\numanity of the men who made this history, \naccurately and realistically, in=\r\n a vivid literary format which will \nat once educate and entertain. Hillsbo=\r\nrough continues this objective \nin Samurai History Papers.\n\n\nTargeted Reade=\r\nrship\nEnthusiasts of Japanese history and culture, military history \nenthus=\r\niasts, students and teachers of these subjects, patrons of \npublic, univers=\r\nity and high school libraries - and anyone interested \nin history depicted =\r\nas human drama.\n\n\nFirst Issue to Be Published: September 2004\n\nFrequency: Q=\r\nuarterly (delivered by email)\n\nYearly subscription: $25\n\nMore information a=\r\nbout Samurai History Papers, including summary of \ncontents and ordering, i=\r\ns available at www.ridgebackpress.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Staff \nRidgeback Pr=\r\ness\nSpecializing in historical biography from the final years of the \nsamur=\r\nai era!\n2335 Collins Ave.\nPinole, CA  94564\nPh: (510) 758-4940\nFax: (510) 7=\r\n58-4939\nridgebackpress@...\nwww.ridgebackpress.com\n\n\n"
