To show the quality of his craft,\n&gt; Muramasa placed his blade in the streambed in such a way that the\n&gt; edge just broke the surface. As the leaves floated by, they were\n&gt; neatly cut in two, and Muramasa recovered his blade, proud of his\n&gt; craftsmanship.\n&gt;\n&gt; Masamune then placed his blade in the stream. This time, as the\n&gt; leaves floated along, the were deflected to the left and right,\n&gt; slipping past the blade, as it were, without harm.\n&gt;\n&gt; This story is used to exemplify the difference between the two\n&gt; smiths, but the tale is apocryphal, the two men lived about 200 years\n&gt; apart, but it does demonstrate the reputation of their blades.\n&gt;\n&gt; Muramasa was noted for &#39;bad luck&#39; blades, and I have read somewhere\n&gt; he might have suffered from some mental disability, perhaps\n&gt; schizophrenia (quite how this is arrived at, I have no idea).\n&gt;\n&gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu had an antipathy towards Muramasa blades, he cut\n&gt; himself with one as a child, his grandfather was killed with one and\n&gt; when his son committed seppuku, the kaishaku used a Muramasa blade.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ieyasu let it be known that his men should get rid of them if they\n&gt; owned one, and Muramasa blades became prized possessions amongst his\n&gt; enemies.\n&gt;\n&gt; My question - is the &#39;ill luck&#39; reputation of Muramasa blades founded\n&gt; on Ieyasu&#39;s antipathy, or is there evidence of this prior to the\n&gt; Tokugawa?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thomas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
