Thanks!\nI&#39;m in the midst of researching, and would like to get my facts \nright:\nFrom what I understand, the nagamaki blade may be as long and as \nshaped as a\nkatana&#39;s. the instances I have found in books and on the web \ndescribe the\nnagamaki pole shorter than the naginata&#39;s, and sometimes equals the \nlength of\nthe nagamaki blade on the other end.\nIs this true, or was there an instance of a katana blade on a \nnaginata pole?\n\nThanks!\n\nRami \n&quot;\n\n\n\n"
