The aikuchi (no tsuba)\n&gt; tanto was accepted and\n&gt; worn.  I think it is in Nobuo Ogasawara sensei&#39;s\n&gt; little book that there is a\n&gt; picture of an katana owned by Uesugi Kenshin that\n&gt; did not have a tsuba.  I\n&gt; have seen other katana in the books without tsuba,\n&gt; but in &quot;real-life&quot;\n&gt; collecting I have only seen aikuchi tanto.\n\nAnother poster also mentioned the Uesugi sword. \n\nAikuchi tanto notwithstanding (being tanto and not\nkatana, and therefore more of a knife rather than a\nsword, in which case the tsuba isn&#39;t nearly as\nfunctional), I&#39;ll change my statement from &quot;Never&quot; to\n&quot;it was so extremely rare that the wealth of knowledge\non this board has been able to come up with ONE\nexample.&quot; \n\nThe point is not &quot;was there ever even ONE example of\nthis sword&quot;, it is to inform the prospective author\nthat it&#39;s not bloody likely someone would be walking\naround with a sword with no tsuba in the late Sengoku.\nShould she wish to still include it in her story,\nwell, it&#39;s her story--more power to her. But the\nanswer to her question is no, people didn&#39;t use these,\ngenerally speaking, ever. One example doesn&#39;t disprove\nthat statement. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
