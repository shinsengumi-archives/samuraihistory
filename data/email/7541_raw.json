There are at least three of them.\n\n&gt;7)Hanzo The Razor:The Snare-a great break from the tired genre of \n&gt;noble ronin films. The Hanzo films work as drama, parody, comedy and \n&gt;chambara. \n&gt;\nThis is a truly bizarre film, I do think list members will enjoy it, \njust don&#39;t let your &#39;gaki&#39; watch it.\n\n&gt;And for best Taiga drama-Toshiie & Matsu. OK, it&#39;s a `chick&#39; Taiga \n&gt;drama, but Toshiie is such an engaging goof and Matsu is just plain \n&gt;adorable.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhat about Musashi? Still T&M was much better than Shinsengumi.\n\nOther films about historical characters that I think are fun are Onmyoji \nand one of the cheesiest ninja flicks, Sudden Death!\n\nJim Eckman\n\n"
