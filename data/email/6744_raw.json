Miura Anjin, whose Engl=\r\nish name was William \nAdams, died nearly four centuries ago, leaving no kno=\r\nwn image.\n\nIn the West, what small fame Adams retains is largely due to wri=\r\nter \nJames Clavell having loosely based the character of John Blackthorne \n=\r\nin his blockbuster novel Shogun on him. But in Japan, Adams is \nremembered =\r\nas a man who brought a wider understanding of Europeans, \nadopted Japanese =\r\nways to a degree few foreigners master even today \nand found himself adopte=\r\nd in return. Of modest education, he rose to \nbecome not only a key adviser=\r\n to the ruler of a nation vastly \ndifferent from his own, but also the lord=\r\n of his own manor and thus \nthe first foreign member of the warrior samurai=\r\n class.\n\nFinding traces of him involves travelling to remote rural location=\r\ns \nthat even today rarely see foreign visitors. Hong Kong-based Walk \nJapan=\r\n has put together an 11-day guided itinerary linking Adams&#39;s \nvarious tradi=\r\nng, advising and interpreting activities. The \norganizers, not your run-of-=\r\nthe-mill tour guides, but academics who \nhave made a thorough study of Adam=\r\ns, have set out a route south from \nTokyo to small ports on the coast of th=\r\ne main island of Honshu, then \nwestward to the smaller island of Kyushu and=\r\n then to tiny Hirado, \nonce the base for the British and Dutch traders. The=\r\nre&#39;s even a walk \non hidden remnants of the ancient Tokaido itself.\n\nAdams =\r\nwas largely brought up in London&#39;s Limehouse dock area and was \napprenticed=\r\n as a shipwright and pilot. But navigation became his \ncareer, and, after 1=\r\n0 years on ships trading with North Africa, he \nbecame the principal pilot =\r\nof a disastrous Dutch expedition to the \nSpice Islands of the East Indies.\n=\r\n\nA series of misfortunes led to the scattering or sinking of the tiny \nflee=\r\nt. The remaining two ships chose, in 1600, to cross the largely \nuncharted =\r\nand rarely sailed Pacific.\n\nOnly Adams&#39;s ship De Liefde survived, along wit=\r\nh a handful of its \ncrew. The lord of the tiny Kyushu town where the ship d=\r\nocked sent \nAdams as spokesperson for his group to the warlord Tokugawa Iey=\r\nasu, \nthen attempting to gain control of the whole of Japan.\n\nIeyasu had a =\r\nhealthy interest in foreign ideas and spent hours \ninterrogating Adams thro=\r\nugh an interpreter, then imprisoned him \nuntil he decided what to do. Subse=\r\nquent audiences improved both \nIeyasu&#39;s knowledge of Europe and his respect=\r\n for the pilot, who was \neventually released and reunited with the remainin=\r\ng crew. Seeing a \nfuture use for them, the lord had the men provided with f=\r\nunds and \nordered them to sail to his base at Edo, modern-day Tokyo, then \n=\r\nignored them while he concentrated on winning control of Japan. The \ncannon=\r\n from De Liefde proved of more immediate value, helping him \nclinch his fin=\r\nal victory at the battle of Sekigahara.\n\nAs months went by, the decrepit Du=\r\ntch ship sank and the crew \nscattered, suspecting that they would never be =\r\nallowed to return \nhome. But Ieyasu had thought of other ways in which thei=\r\nr technology \ncould help him. With his battles won, he awarded each man an =\r\nample \ndaily ration of rice and set Adams an important task.\n\nOur search fo=\r\nr Adams/\n\nMiura began at Nihon Bashi, the central Tokyo bridge that marked =\r\nthe \nstart of the Tokaido and four other ancient highways. It was \noriginal=\r\nly built in 1603, three years after Ieyasu&#39;s victory, and \nthe year he was =\r\nofficially confirmed as de facto ruler or shogun by \na powerless and impove=\r\nrished emperor.\n\nThat year the shogun, having recognized Adams&#39;s worth as a=\r\n truthful \nadviser on everything foreign, gave him a town house near the ne=\r\nw \nbridge, among the warehouses and shops of Edo&#39;s rapidly developing \ncomm=\r\nercial quarter. A short walk from the current crossing, built in \n1911, we =\r\nfound that the navigator had earned himself a place on \nmodern maps. In a n=\r\narrow turning named Anjin-dori a small, rough-\nhewn stele marked the site o=\r\nf his residence, mentioning that he had \ninstructed the shogun in gunnery, =\r\ngeography and mathematics.\n\nThe next morning we boarded a southbound commut=\r\ner train. At the \nwealthy suburb of Taura we took a taxi to a high point ov=\r\nerlooking a \nnaval base where the modern equivalents of Adams&#39;s well-armed =\r\nDe \nLiefde wallowed. Adams had a vast estate here, on the Miura \nPeninsula,=\r\n given him by Ieyasu as a reward for constructing ocean-\ngoing ships in the=\r\n Western style. A path led to a thick hedge and a \nstout fence surrounding =\r\nthe graves of Adams, his Japanese wife and \nhis two children by her. A memo=\r\nrial ceremony for Adams, held every \nApril, is &quot;one of the four magnificent=\r\n international events&quot; of the \narea, a sign claimed.\n\nA winding walk down s=\r\nteep residential backstreets led to the station \nat Anjin-zuka (Anjin&#39;s Hil=\r\nl). A few minutes&#39; ride and we disembarked \nat Hemi station. Here a track, =\r\nwith tree-root stairways, wound over \nhills, along ridge tops and down to t=\r\nhe 13th-century Great Buddha of \nKamakura, a 13-metre-high bronze of a sere=\r\nne, seated figure, hands \ntogether in its lap. In 1613 Adams came this way =\r\nin the company of \nJohn Saris, an emissary from Britain&#39;s King James, who h=\r\nad arrived \nbearing a letter requesting trade. Saris and crew were the firs=\r\nt \nEnglishmen Adams had seen since his arrival, and he brought them to \nthe=\r\n shogun to help negotiate the privileges requested.\n\nA picturesque train ri=\r\nde west around the coastline brought us to \nIto, the site of Adams&#39;s shipbu=\r\nilding efforts. The city has erected \na statue of the man: gaunt, high-chee=\r\nkboned and shovel-bearded, \ngesturing out to sea.\n\nWe spent the night at a =\r\nriverside inn of considerable antiquity, a \nlabyrinth of creaking boards, s=\r\nteep stairways and tatami-floored \nrooms with sliding screens. We changed f=\r\nor the evening into cotton \nyukata gowns, short haori jackets and slippers.=\r\n\n\nWhen the first Europeans arrived, 50 years before Adams, the \nfastidious =\r\nJapanese were struck by their gaudy doublets, but \nmarvelled that this fine=\r\nry contained men so uninterested in washing. \nAdams eventually submerged hi=\r\nmself in Japanese culture and adopted \nlocal dress. Now we did the same. We=\r\n flapped our way to a basement \nbathing area, scrubbing ourselves spotless =\r\nbefore slipping into the \ngeothermally heated waters for a soak, then heade=\r\nd for a feast of \ncolourful dishes, mixed with liberal quantities of beer a=\r\nnd local \nsake.\n\nContinuing ever west, at Hatsudenshomae, a few hops by tra=\r\nin and bus \nlater, we climbed one of the few remaining sections of the grea=\r\nt \nTokaido, the main highway to the west. It snaked up the hillside \nwith s=\r\nome of its original uneven paving still in place - perhaps the \nvery stones=\r\n Adams himself walked on many trips between the foreign \ntrading houses at =\r\nHirado and the capital at Edo.\n\nAt Kyoto we visited magnificent Nijo Castle=\r\n, begun by Ieyasu in \n1602. Its purpose was to make his dominance over the =\r\nemperor clear. \nHere he was formally installed as shogun with several days =\r\nof \nfeasting. The luxury meant to impress Japan&#39;s nobles still remains \nin =\r\nthe vast halls with their gilded walls and screens painted with \nscenes of =\r\npines, birds and tigers.\n\nWe travelled to Miya-jima, a train and boat ride =\r\nfrom Hiroshima, to \nsee the towering, orange-painted torii, or gate, which =\r\nseems to \nstride into the sea off the tiny island&#39;s coast. The torii, built=\r\n in \n1168, was ancient even when Adams passed by on his way to Kyushu. He \n=\r\nwould have gone by ship; we took the bullet train through a tunnel \nbeneath=\r\n Japan&#39;s Inland Sea.\n\nJust off Kyushu&#39;s west coast is Dejima, a fan-shaped =\r\nartificial \nisland constructed to house foreign traders. In 1639, Ieyasu&#39;s =\r\nson \nHidetada, irritated by Catholic preaching that allegiance to the \npope=\r\n took precedence over feudal allegiances, banned all foreigners. \nThe Briti=\r\nsh had already left, but the Dutch, protected because Adams \nhad made clear=\r\n the distinction between Catholic and Protestant \nteaching, were merely mov=\r\ned to this tiny enclave connected to Kyushu \nby a single, well-guarded brid=\r\nge. Some of the Dutch colony&#39;s \nbuildings have been re-created and fitted o=\r\nut as excellent museums \nexplaining foreigners&#39; impact on Japan. Adams is r=\r\nemembered in a \npicture of the departure of De Liefde from Holland in 1598.=\r\n\n\nOur final stop was Hirado, the small island off Kyushu where Dutch \nand B=\r\nritish trading houses were first set up. Adams came to this \nremote spot ma=\r\nny times. On the hillside above the sleepy little town \nand its quiet harbo=\r\nur we found a small, neat garden of bamboo, pines \nand cycads, with a monum=\r\nent to 17 British merchant-adventurers. The \nstone next to it was something=\r\n of a surprise: &quot;Miura Anjin&#39;s tomb.&quot; \nWe&#39;d already seen his grave several =\r\nhundred kilometres away, so it \nseemed that even in death Adams was a trave=\r\nller.\n\nHe died on Hirado on May 26, 1620, and given Japan&#39;s summer \ntempera=\r\ntures it seems likely that the island still has him, although \nit&#39;s impossi=\r\nble to say for certain: After the banning of foreigners \nin 1639, the remai=\r\nns of English mariners were disinterred and flung \ninto the sea. Those of A=\r\ndams may not have been among them, however: \nSuspiciously long bones were d=\r\niscovered nearby in the 1920s. Perhaps \nhe was left undisturbed because of =\r\nhis samurai status.\n\nIn a land with few foreign heroes, Beckham&#39;s billboard=\r\ns will have \ntheir day. But what greater sign of enduring respect than to h=\r\nave \nyour name carved in not one, but two tombstones?\n\n=A9 The Gazette (Mon=\r\ntreal) 2005\n\n\n\n\n"
