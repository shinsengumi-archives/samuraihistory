I would say that there is more a\nprovenience rather then a brand-name, and\nI&#39;ve been puzzled by this for years and still are. My former Senpai, now\npassed away, was making a study assuming that the\nPortugueses made those arquebuses in Goa or possibly Macau. Cannons at that\ntime had a limied lifespan. Each 100 rounds (signed on the barrel, ten\nrounds one nick) the cannon should have been re-melted and casted (we&#39;re\ntalking about bronze, not steel). Transporting such valuable items from\nIndonesia to Portugal was expensive and dangerous so the portugueses\nsettled foundries in both the above mentioned colonies. Such foundries\nprovided even metal items for the chinese and indian market.\nNow, is it belivable that the portugueses established arquebuses factories\nthere too ? Fabrizio was collecting evidences, but he passed away before to\nfinish the work and his widow lost the notes and bibliography. I&#39;ve never\nhad neither the time nor the knowledge to re-create the files. Might be, if\nhe was right, that arquebuses equipping the men that shipwrecked on\nTanegashima were made in Goa or Macau, possibly in factories managed by\nportuguese commercial company,\nbut I can&#39;t really consider this other then a possibility NOT supported by\nevidences.\nSorry.   \n      \n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nPer conto di brentbovee2\nInviato: domenica 22 ottobre 2006 2.19\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: [samuraihistory] maker???\n\nhello all... this is my first time here and i already have a question. \nThe style of gun that samurai first aquired was ,i think a matchlock but did\nit have a brand name- maker? (like winchester or anything like\nthat) thanks for your time!;)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com Samurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\nJoin the 2007 Samurai Fiction Contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\nYahoo!
