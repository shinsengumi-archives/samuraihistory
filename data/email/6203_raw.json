In our alphabet, anyway.  The sword would be an\niaito, or sword for iai practise.  Was (is) she studying iaido or an\niai-jutsu style, d&#39;you know?\nTo expand on someone else&#39;s response to this:  apparently (someone\nknowledgeable correct me if I&#39;m wrong, please) after DubyDubyaAyeAye the\nAllies prohibited the making of swords for several (&#39;seven&#39; comes to mind?)\nyears.  (Part of the prohibition on military manufacturing, probably with a\nside order of suppressing a popular national symbol of martial prowess.)\nWhen the ban was lifted, the Japanese government wanted to be sure that the\nold standards of sword quality were maintained.  (Hear, hear.)  They went\naround asking some of the surviving masters how many swords they could make\nin a month.  Consensus was &quot;Two.&quot;  So there&#39;s a limit, by law, of two katana\n(over 24&quot; as I recall) per month.  I think they can make three wakizashi in\na month instead, which are shorter.\n(This tends to raise the price of such blades through the ceiling, as a\nmoment&#39;s thought may lead you to imagine.  And that in turn has a great deal\nto do with the reason my own pair of katana were made by Chen Chao-po of\nHanwei, China, a smith for whose studio&#39;s work I hold considerable\nfondness.)\nBut I digress.  (Again.)\nNow there are probably blessed few smiths left in Japan today who still use\nentirely, completely, no-compromises-not-even-a-little-bit, traditional\nmethods for crafting a katana - from collecting the iron sand to the old\nsmelting process, etc.  Machines are available today that make some of those\nsteps produce irresistibly consistent results.  So if it doesn&#39;t take you\nall month to make those two swords... well, it&#39;s a shame to waste that nice\nforge and all that smithying skill.  Those apprentices are sitting around\nlooking mighty lazy, too.  Eat you out of house and home.  What to do to get\nthem moving...?\nGereg\n\nMessage: 3\n   Date: Wed, 8 Dec 2004 16:50:30 -0800 (PST)\n   From: Matt Bowes &lt;yeomanforbes@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Re: Japan Eras\n\n\nMr. Gabriel:\n\nImpressive.  Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you&#39;re not a &quot;ringer&quot;\nposting from middle Ohio?  You made me look up &quot;concatenates.&quot;  I think I\nheard the word used ONCE back in 1992.\n\nTo the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be wrong, but\nmy ex-wife&#39;s aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have no idea how it is\nspelled, since I have never ever seen it in print) told me that the great\nsword makers had stopped making katanas and moved into making kitchen\nknives, since that&#39;s where the money is.  Now, I can see perhaps where it\nwould be extra handy to have a ginsu knife for chopping garlic instead of\nyour trusty katana, but maybe that&#39;s just me.  Some of you might enjoy the\ngarlic chopping with a larger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged\nif you do, since that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there\nany truth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there, just\nmaking steak knives for Williams Sonoma?  (Incidentally, the ex and myself\nare on excellent terms, so no need to fear for my safety.  Thank you for\nyour concern.)\n\nYour most obedient,\n\nMatt\n\nDodu Gabriel &lt;dodu_gabriel@...&gt; wrote:\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter\n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Newbies are welcome unless they make themselves\n&gt; unwelcome.

Up to this point\nthe\noutgunned Korean defenders had suffered defeat after defeat and been forced\nto\nabandon all of Korea�(tm)s major cities and fortresses and seek refuge\nalong the\nChinese border. They requested help from Ming China, Korea�(tm)s tributary\noverlords and even though a small Ming expeditionary force was defeated in\nthe summer\nof 1592, the Ming promised to send more aid. This arrived in early 1593 and\ntogether with Korean troops and volunteers, the Ming overwhelmed the\nJapanese\nwith superior firepower and recovered the city of Pyongyang, Korea�(tm)s\nauxiliary\ncapital.

And what would be the purpose of that law, beyond\nartificially driving the price of each sword up?  It sounds like a\nprotectionist Japanese law, sort of like how DeBeers limits the sales of\ndiamonds to artifically drive up the price.\n\nMatt\n\n\n\nDodu Gabriel &lt;dodu_gabriel@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nHello Matt!\n\nFunny garlic thingy there...:)) I think there should have been a\ncross also. But leaving this aside (I hope this type of utterance is\npermitted in english), the katana stuff was only inteded as a joke,\nas I was reading a lot of &quot;bollocks&quot; (as Mr. Bryant said once) on\nother forums regarding the Samurai matter.\n\nBy the way, are you familiar with the Toledo Swordmasters (the\nspanish Toledo, because there are others)? They have some very nice\nreplicas (is that the word?) of historical swords.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGabriel\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Matt Bowes &lt;yeomanforbes@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr. Gabriel:\n&gt;\n&gt; Impressive.  Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you&#39;re not\na &quot;ringer&quot; posting from middle Ohio?  You made me look\nup &quot;concatenates.&quot;  I think I heard the word used ONCE back in 1992.\n&gt;\n&gt; To the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be\nwrong, but my ex-wife&#39;s aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have\nno idea how it is spelled, since I have never ever seen it in print)\ntold me that the great sword makers had stopped making katanas and\nmoved into making kitchen knives, since that&#39;s where the money is.\nNow, I can see perhaps where it would be extra handy to have a ginsu\nknife for chopping garlic instead of your trusty katana, but maybe\nthat&#39;s just me.  Some of you might enjoy the garlic chopping with a\nlarger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged if you do,\nsince that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there any\ntruth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there,\njust making steak knives for Williams Sonoma?  (Incidentally, the ex\nand myself are on excellent terms, so no need to fear for my safety.\nThank you for your concern.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Your most obedient,\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n&gt; Dodu Gabriel &lt;dodu_gabriel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter\n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Newbies are welcome unless they make themselves\n&gt; &gt; unwelcome.

I am from Romania, and please don&#39;t\n&gt; start with the Dracula stuff, because I hate Bram Stoker. It did\n&gt; wonders for our Travelling Industry, but it crippled our history...:\n(\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/kanji/nengo.htm\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That only begins in year 1201, but does give the kanji\n&gt; &gt; for each period, and the alternate periods. I&#39;ll see\n&gt; &gt; if I can dig up anything prior to that. As for\n&gt; &gt; changing the period name, it was the Emperor who did\n&gt; &gt; that--not the daimyo, Shogun, or any military person.\n&gt; &gt; Someone else may have &quot;suggested&quot; to the Emperor that\n&gt; &gt; it would be a good time for a name change, but it was\n&gt; &gt; the Emperor who actually did it. Reasons for changing\n&gt; &gt; included a portentous sign, a natural disaster, a\n&gt; &gt; particularly good event, or just because they&#39;d gone\n&gt; &gt; long enough.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for the information, it&#39;s good to know things as they\n&gt; were. About that site, I wish I had a sword, so that I could\nproperly\n&gt; use it by reading what is signed on it...no, no, don&#39;t fear, I\ndon&#39;t\n&gt; intend to ask for information about purchasing a katana and about\n&gt; the &quot;Samurai Way of the Sword&quot; & Stuff  :)). I like the site,\n&gt; though...\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, if you get to check out EDICT, maybe you can find out\n&gt; how to search for expressions, because I couldn&#39;t. Even if I\n&gt; select &quot;full regular expression&quot;, it concatenates my words into a\n&gt; single one, which, of course, the server can&#39;t understand. This is\n&gt; the exact link of one of the mirrors:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.df.lth.se/cgi-bin/j-e/dict\n&gt;\n&gt; Other than that, thank you for your time and I hope we get to chat\n&gt; some more.\n&gt;\n&gt; Respectfully,\n&gt;\n&gt; Gabriel\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;  Yahoo!
