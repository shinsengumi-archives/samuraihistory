But what do you\n&gt; guys think of it? Do\n&gt; &gt; you think it has the potential to be up there with\n&gt; Shogun and The\n&gt; &gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood\n&gt; crapfest to make money\n&gt; &gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n&gt; \n&gt; I look at going to it much as I do going to the\n&gt; dentist. I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t like it. I know\n&gt; it&#39;ll hurt. But I\n&gt; have to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
