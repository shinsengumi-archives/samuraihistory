Black and white sashimono only; their armour\nin the 16thC being generally black due to the lacquer and lack of\ncoloured lace compared with earlier eras - no different from other clans.\n\nThe Ii wore red armour and lace in the 16thC, instigated by Obu\nToramasa (1504-1565) and his brother Yamagata Masakage who inherited\nthis &quot;red regiment&quot; (red armour and horse harness for everyone;\nsamurai, followers and ashigaru). \n\nSo my question should really be: was there any uniformity of lace\nprior to the 16thC, or did it start with Obu Toramasa?\n\nCheers\nPaul\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;russcat9&quot; &lt;snowcat9@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In the 16thC the Shimazu were known to equip their warriors with black\n&gt; armour, much like the Ii and Sanada? with red.\n&gt; \n&gt; When did this sort of thing start? Does anyone really know?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it conceivable that a Shimazu daimyo of the 14thC might have\n&gt; equipped his men with black armour, if similar things were occurring\n&gt; in the 16thC?\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
