Pp. xxiv, 519 pages. \nIllus., notes, index. $15.95 paper. ISBN:0-8=\r\n129-6966-9.\n\n\nWhile Richard Cohen&#39;s By the Sword isn&#39;t directly related to =\r\nthe \ntopic of military history, it does provide the reader with a rare \nand=\r\n fascinating glimpse into the development of the sword, a weapon \nthat play=\r\ned a pivotal role in warfare for at least three millennia. \n\nA former Olymp=\r\nic fencer himself, the author starts off by telling us \nthat it was the anc=\r\nient Assyrian king, Nimus, who first made fencing \ninto a formal sport and =\r\nhired fencing masters to teach his troops \nswordsmanship. Cohen then tells =\r\nthe reader that the classical \nGreeks, for all their record of military suc=\r\ncess against the \nPersians and in producing brutally efficient soldiers lik=\r\ne the \nSpartans, looked down on the art of swordplay. They admired skill \nw=\r\nith the javelin more than the sword, feeling that it was a weapon \nof last =\r\nresort only. \n\nCohen devotes an entire chapter to the art of sword-making. =\r\nHe tells \nthe secret of the Damascus steel, used to make some of the most \n=\r\nhighly prized swords of the Middle Ages. The city&#39;s famous sword \nsmiths wo=\r\nuld use special steel ingots imported from India that were \na mixture of lo=\r\nw-carbon and high-carbon iron alloys that gave \nDamascus blades the combina=\r\ntion of strength and flexibility that \nmade them so highly valued in their =\r\ntime. Each culture would have \nits own unique way of testing the sharpness =\r\nof a newly forged sword. \nArab smiths would place a new blade point down in=\r\n a stream to see if \nit could cut a drifting leaf. The Japanese used what h=\r\nad to be the \nmost gruesome method of all to test a blade&#39;s quality: one me=\r\ndieval \nJapanese sword smith certified his blades through the use of the \ni=\r\nai, a special upward thrust that involved chopping a condemned \ncriminal in=\r\n two by slicing him from hip to shoulder. \n\nOne of book&#39;s charms is that Co=\r\nhen populates it with interesting \ncharacters. We learn that d&#39;Artagnan, th=\r\ne famous hero of Alexandre \nDumas&#39;s The Three Musketeers, actually existed.=\r\n Born in 1615, the \nFrench swordsman led a life just as adventurous as the =\r\none described \nin Dumas&#39;s novel, including service as a secret agent for Ca=\r\nrdinal \nMazarin, the successor to the fictional d&#39;Artagnan&#39;s nemesis, the \n=\r\nreal-life Cardinal Richelieu. \n\nOne truly strange personality was the 18th =\r\ncentury French swordsman, \nthe Chevalier d&#39;Eon. The best fencer of his day,=\r\n the Chevalier was \nalso Europe&#39;s most notorious transvestite. In 1787, whe=\r\nn he was 59, \nhe participated in a duel in London witnessed by the Prince o=\r\nf Wales \nand other members of English high society; Dressed like a \ngrandmo=\r\nther, and nearly 20 years older than his opponent, d&#39;Eon \nstill won the mat=\r\nch, outscoring his adversary by seven hits to one. \n\nAs the stories of d&#39;Ar=\r\ntagnan and the Chevalier d&#39;Eon show, it is the \nidea of the duel that ties =\r\nCohen&#39;s book together. Long after the \nsword began to lose its military uti=\r\nlity, the ability to use a blade \nremained a mark of character and skill. O=\r\ntto von Bismarck, Germany&#39;s \nIron Chancellor, was a duelist during his stud=\r\nent days. Even Karl \nMarx learned to fence. In pre-Civil War New Orleans th=\r\nere was a \ndueling ground called &quot;The Dueling Oaks&quot; where at one point up t=\r\no a \ndozen duels were held every week. \n\nAnd sometimes the art of the sword=\r\n was an aid to the imagination. \nThe duels in Alexandre Dumas&#39;s books were =\r\nmore than just the \nproducts of a vivid imagination. T he French novelist t=\r\nook fencing \nlessons three times a week. The tradition of using swordplay t=\r\no \nsettle matters of honor survived throughout the 20th century. Duels \nwer=\r\ne being held in Italy as late as the 1920s. Even modern Germany, \nthe land =\r\nof Siemens and BMW, still quietly maintains the custom of \nthe duel. Cohen =\r\nnotes that between 1500 and 2000 non-lethal duels \nare still fought in Germ=\r\nany and Austria every year. And though it&#39;s \nnever mentioned in their quart=\r\nerly reports, some German companies \nrequire a dueling background if a pers=\r\non wants to become a senior \nexecutive. Settling affairs by the sword seems=\r\n to fulfill a primal \nneed for personal combat in some very modern people. =\r\n\n\nIt&#39;s when By the Sword discusses fencing as an Olympic sport that it \nis =\r\nat its weakest. The last few chapters of the book turn into a \nlitany of fa=\r\nmous=97to a fencer at least=97fencing masters and Olympic \nduels that are o=\r\nf only mild interest to a non-fencer. But even here, \nCohen makes things li=\r\nvely by dropping in an interesting character or \ntwo, including the beautif=\r\nul Helene Mayer, a German Jew who competed \nfor the Nazis at the 1936 Berli=\r\nn Olympics. \n\nOverall, By the Sword is a gold mine of information about a w=\r\norld \nthat has generally only been available to the public through the \nlen=\r\ns of a movie camera. It&#39;s the only book you&#39;re ever going to need \nabout th=\r\ne history of the sword. Unless you plan to take up \nswashbuckling, of cours=\r\ne. \n\nReviewer: Michael G. Gallagher\n\n\n\n"
