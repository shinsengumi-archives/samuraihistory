And you make a very =\r\ngood case for it.  But I truly don&#39;t think it&#39;s projection.  (For that matt=\r\ner, I tend to think the same of feline and canine emotions:  they&#39;re not th=\r\ne same as human emotions, to be sure, but as far as I can tell, they&#39;re not=\r\n as far removed from it as a lot of folks seem to think, either.)  I could =\r\nbe mistaken, to be sure, but I&#39;ve experimented with the possibility of proj=\r\nection - it is, after all, the most culturally obvious one - and it simply =\r\ndoesn&#39;t feel right.  It doesn&#39;t seem to accurately describe the sensations =\r\nthat take place in a sword&#39;s proximity, let alone in the handling.  More cl=\r\nose to the mark might be - note I say &quot;might&quot; - the idea that we are capabl=\r\ne of endowing objects technically regarded as inanimate with a certain degr=\r\nee of self and spirit, under certain circumstances.  That&#39;s one I&#39;m not qui=\r\nte prepared to swallow, myself, but I acknowledge that it could be the case=\r\n.  If this is projection, however, it&#39;s a lasting variety well beyond the o=\r\nrdinary usage of the term.\nHowever, I appreciate the voice of moderation.\n\t=\r\nGereg\n   Date: Tue, 14 Dec 2004 11:21:00 +0700\n   From: &quot;Michael Peters&quot; &lt;s=\r\nhdwstel@...&gt;\nSubject: RE: swords (was ...Eras)\n\n\n\n&gt;If you want to a=\r\nrgue that a sword has &quot;spirit&quot; as any\n&gt;piece of art would, I&#39;ll buy it.

To: Tony Bryant\n\n\nhello tony,\n  com&#39;o=\r\nn man,...it was pretty good.?? I&#39;ve seen a handful &quot;samurai&quot; movies in the =\r\npast, (and yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but this is the=\r\n 2000&#39;s, not the 1900&#39;s (lol). People like to see cool stuff like the Last =\r\nSamurai even if it isn&#39;t all that accurate. You can&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve seen a=\r\nny better Samurai &quot;battle&quot; scenes in another movies from the past?? (if so,=\r\n please let me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great movie to b=\r\noost the Samurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of people to =\r\nrespect them for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate history stu=\r\nff & think i&#39;m a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome movie. They =\r\nwere like....&quot;Wow, those guys could really kick butt&quot; I don&#39;t know,....mayb=\r\ne i&#39;m wrong??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more insentive to =\r\npractice kendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in the making,..=\r\n..delayed temp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watch it again =\r\nand tell me that\n those battle scenes don&#39;t want to make you get up, build =\r\na time machine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hopefully a g=\r\nood one), and fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese back then wer=\r\ne only like 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(lol). Well=\r\n, my times up.
