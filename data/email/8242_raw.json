The image you&#39;ve got in\n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt;  head is from the Edo period. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is something I&#39;ve got from the &quot;Online\n&gt; dictionary of history and\n&gt; traditions&quot;\n&gt; (http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/search?\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt; Hope  some pieces of this info might be useful to\n&gt; you, guys. And it is\n&gt; interesting that I also heard soe time ago from one\n&gt; of my friends that\n&gt; hakama  was  used to camouflage your legs&#39; moves,\n&gt; but I never actually\n&gt; read about that...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; P.s.  My first post to the group. Please, do not\n&gt; take too skeptical...\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you are trying to say--you&#39;re\nproving my exact point. Rod&#39;s impression that the\nhakama were developed to hide the martial artist&#39;s\nlegs in a duel is false; that is an Edo period image,\nwhereas hakama were developed early enough to be\ndepicted on haniwa, as your nice research points out. \n\nAs for skepticism...lol. Can&#39;t help that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
