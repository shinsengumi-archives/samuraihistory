His attitude may have stemmed from an inferiority complex derived from having been from the peasant class in Japan. Perhaps he was always trying to prove himself to others of samurai birth, hence his military campaigns in Korea. So no matter how powerful he got he always felt like he wasn&#39;t good enough. \nDon&#39;t quote me on this though, others may disagree.\n \nLater,\nRod\n \n\n\nbillymalone_pi &lt;Jimmy_Culo@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nhello.
