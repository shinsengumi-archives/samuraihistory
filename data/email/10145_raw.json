As he awoke, these vows ripened.=C3=82=C2=A0 Most Buddhas =\r\nhave some kind of &quot;related power&quot;.. that upon awakening, their vow ripens i=\r\nnto that power ...so to speak.=C3=82=C2=A0 Amitabha vowed that his awakenin=\r\ng would be interconnected with the pufication of the world he was practicin=\r\ng on, and that once he attained enlightenment, his radiance would produce t=\r\nhis pure field. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 Another vow that was ripened wa=\r\ns that if you focus on Amitabha PROPERLY, you can connect with his radiance=\r\n from your concentration meeting with his ripened vow. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 O.k... many people have seemingly misunderstood how this works=\r\n. Most Amitabha practice was become really just Buddha-Christ=C3=82=C2=A0 g=\r\nod-worshiping and &quot;save me Oh Amida!&quot; kinda of methodology.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 The real idea is that you take Amita=\r\nbha, the Pure Land, His vows..etc.etc. . AS YOUR OBJECT OF CONCENTRATION. .=\r\n. and through the process of meditating and concentrating on these, you wil=\r\nl create the connection with it. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 It is actua=\r\nlly suppose to be a form of meditation.. . not salvation worship.=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 However, as most of the common folk, such as farmers and merchents, don=\r\n&#39;t have time, leisure, or training on how to properly concentrate on an obj=\r\nect or to meditate, the system of &quot;Amida&#39;s salvation if you call out to him=\r\n&quot; came into effect...\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0because, if their faith =\r\nin Amitabha can be sustain in their mind, they will KEEP Amitabha in their =\r\nthoughts constantly.. .\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0.. then this MIGHT pro=\r\nduce the same result as if you were properly meditating on Amitabha.\n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 However, this must be understood to be an alteration to the actua=\r\nl program/system of accomplishing the Pure Land. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 Amitabha was never t=\r\naught, by the Buddhas, to be a &quot;god&quot; or a &quot;savior&quot; --- He is a meditation t=\r\nechnique, actually.=C3=82=C2=A0 All four variations of the Pure Land sutra =\r\nteach this, and in the esoteric Amitabha rituals teach this as well.=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 In this case :=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 &quot;=\r\nFaith&quot; =3D &quot;Mental Concentration&quot;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 It should b=\r\ne noted that one can make contact, in theory, with ANY Buddha or Bodhisattv=\r\na via this method of mental concentration, not just Amitabha.=C3=82=C2=A0 T=\r\nhe &quot;key difference&quot; of Amitabha is the being born into the Pure Field part.=\r\n \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0I hope this puts this into proper perspective. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On =\r\nTue, 2/16/10, Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@.=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Shinto and Buddhism\n&gt; To: samuraihistor=\r\ny@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, February 16, 2010, 11:08 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Eddie--\n&gt; \n&gt; My understanding of the history is th=\r\nat Shinto is an animistic religion \n&gt; indigenous to Japan, and that there w=\r\nas a certain degree of tension between \n&gt; Buddhism and Shinto when Buddhism=\r\n was first introduced (as you said) from \n&gt; China, but that the two religio=\r\nns became, if not precisely syncretic, then at \n&gt; least interwoven -- that =\r\nit was to a large extent held that the kami of \n&gt; Shinto were genuine entit=\r\nies who, like all others, could benefit from the \n&gt; Buddha&#39;s enlightenment.=\r\n (Hence the fact that Shinto shrines are such a common \n&gt; fixture in so man=\r\ny Buddhist temples).\n&gt; \n&gt; I got the impression that this changed substantia=\r\nlly during the Meiji \n&gt; restoration and into WWII, when the government pres=\r\nsed the notion of the \n&gt; Imperial lineage (the descent from Amaterasu-o- Mi=\r\nkami) as evidence that Japan was \n&gt; under the unique protection of the gods=\r\n / kami, as a result of which a very \n&gt; strict separation of church and sta=\r\nte was written into the post-war \n&gt; constitution. ..\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I missing anyt=\r\nhing substantial here? My personal experience of Japan \n&gt; was that the temp=\r\nles and shrines were largely appreciated for their historic \n&gt; nature; I se=\r\nldom saw religious ceremonies going on (apart from New Year&#39;s \n&gt; Day, when =\r\npeople arrived, made their offerings, and departed) the way I did \n&gt; in Kor=\r\nea, for example.
