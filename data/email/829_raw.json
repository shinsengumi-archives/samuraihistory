Let me know who to look out for...\n\nTrevor Dixon (Dixon Miniatures - 25mm Samurai) may be there, I haven&#39;t\nspoken to him about the show yet. Make sure you check out the new range of\n54mm Samurai by Irregular Miniatures too.\nAs an aside I am sure that Stephen Turnbull will be there also..... any\nquestions or comments to pass on? {and be realistic!!}.....\n\n\nRod Johnson\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Ray&quot; &lt;ray@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, May 02, 2002 10:47 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] places to visit\n\n\nHi Rod,\n\n     sorry I&#39;ve taken so long to answer your helpful e-mail on samurai\narmour and\n     weapons  at the Royal Armouries and other places to visit in the U.K.\n     My computer has been down,but I am pleased to say is now back to\nnormal.\n     I plan to visit the Royal Armouries at Leeds on Sunday the 12th May\nwith a few\n     friends as there is also a model painting competition being held\nthere.The entry\n     fee is ï¿½2.50 to the show and as a wargamer hope to pick-up some usefull\nhints\n     on painting figures and there may-be some traders there.\n     I also plan to take some photos of the suits of armour and weapons of\nthe samurai.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
