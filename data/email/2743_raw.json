You are\nfollowing Christ and ascethic life styles guideded by\nBushido. Yet, you did not choose to be a samurai.\nYou did not answer a question of whether there is a\ntrue samurai in modern days...\n\n--- CRAZ &lt;crazoftheages@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Morihei Ueshiba only had 1/4 &quot;samurai&quot; blood in him\n&gt; from his mother&#39;s side, far enough removed most\n&gt; would\n&gt; say to not even mention.  Yet one of the heaviest\n&gt; parts of his philosophy was about being a samurai\n&gt; and\n&gt; about practicioners of Aikido being modern day\n&gt; samurai\n&gt; and so forth.  \n \n\n&gt; I am 19 years old, full anglo-saxon decent as I&#39;ve\n&gt; noted already.  I wake every morning and pray to MY\n&gt; lord, Christ, and everynight before bed, on my\n&gt; knees,\n&gt; seiza position.  I practice kendo, kenjutsu, jiu\n&gt; jitsu, aikido and am terribly interested in\n&gt; invovling\n&gt; myself in kyudo and the use of japanese polearms.  I\n&gt; am pursuing a career in law enforcement and find\n&gt; bushido to be an excellent basis for my career, and\n&gt; most importantly my faith, my relationship with\n&gt; Christ.  But I am not a Samurai, \n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo! Photos - easier uploading and sharing.\nhttp://photos.yahoo.com/\n\n"
