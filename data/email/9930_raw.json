And the new power  defeated the other \none to establish New Government , Meiji Government.&quot;\n \nYes and no. Many of those who rebelled were those who support the  emperor. \nBoth sides used firearms, it wasn&#39;t like the movie were they rebelled  \nbecause of the modernization. Too many times we put simple answers to complex  \nones.\n\n&quot;By the way ,  do you know who  did open Japan&#39;s door which used be closed \nagainst foreign countries ?&quot;\n \nThe Dutch had a trading post since the 1400&#39;s in Japan. The shogunate  at \nthe time of the opening had a model of a working steam engine (that they  \nbuilt), a working blast furnace and a model of wire communication. They also \nhad  access to modern (at the time) medical books. They knew what was coming, \nbut  they wanted to control the information as to keep  power.\n\nSince then,  Japan  really were forced to be changed, to be revoluted to \nface with barbarians  through The pacific Ocean&#39;s war.\n\nForced? Not really,Once again it comes down to power and the control of  \nit. The shogunate held information so they could control it and prevent the  \ndaimyo&#39;s from getting it and using it to over throw them (which they did). \nThe  best example is firearms, which the at the end other Daimyo got a hold of \nand  used them to challenge the shogunate. \n\nThere is much out there that is misunderstood about the Samurai. My  \npersonal favorite is the way Bushido was twisted to serve the daimyo so they  \ncould better control those below them. For example the myth of a &quot;Samurai would  \nrather die than face surrender or defeat&quot;. This was not at all true, many \ndiamyo  and their forces surrendered, switched sides and lost battles and \nguess  what? They live! With no shame. It was later, that this was put in. By \npeople  (Nobles) who wanted to ensure loyalty. \n \nGreg\n**************Recession-proof vacation ideas.
