Munsey&quot; &lt;robert.munsey@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks everyone on the help for the book.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have another questions, as I understand it, the\n&gt; coming of age\n&gt; ceremony involves the shaving the forehead-top of\n&gt; the head for the\n&gt; Samurai, do I have this correct or incorrect.\n\nPossibly, but not necessarily. Plenty of samurai did\nnot shave the forehead. This became a little more\nformalized in the Edo period, but it was never a\n&quot;requirement&quot; that the forehead be shaved. \n\n Also what is the significance of the top of the head\n&gt; shaved or not,\n&gt; Does this mean obedience to a particular lord?\n\nIt was a hairstyle, nothing more. Shaving the\nforelocks was a mark of an adult samurai, but not\nshaving it didn&#39;t mean the person wasn&#39;t samurai, and\nin the Edo period the lower classes also shaved their\nforelocks, but arranged the hair differently (check\nout old episodes of Abarenbou Shogun to see this). \nHaving it shaved didn&#39;t mean you were a retainer of\nLord X--it wasn;t like wearing a unit patch on your\nshoulder. \n\nTurnbull&#39;s &#39;Samurai Sourcebook&#39; I believe has a\nsection on hairstyles with a good explanation. \n\nNice to see another tanker on the board--I was a 12A\nuntil they made me go MI. If you ain&#39;t cav...\n\nNate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
