If we can&#39;t respect each others opinions, why have a group at all? EVERYONE is wrong for this, not just one person...and if I&#39;ve offended anyone, please tell me! \nLet&#39;s get back on track, folks. This is about samurai &quot;history&quot;, which I&#39;ve greatly been schooled on and it&#39;s been much appreciated. I&#39;d hate to quit this group over &quot;punk shit&quot;, and I think others would, too. I&#39;ve learned alot and I&#39;d like to continue that...\nPhil\n \n eatswithscissorsrunswithmonkeys &lt;intp@...&gt; wrote:This &#39;I wanna be a Sammy-rai&#39; conversation is analgous to \na bunch of Japanese people sitting in Japan right now \nsaying \n\n&quot;I wanna be a confederate!
