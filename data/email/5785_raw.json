Were the individual estates directly under Edo&#39;s \njurisdiction, or were each several estates clustered under, shall we say, a \nprovince or a regional lord. (example: every borough of New York City has a \nMayor of Borough, by NYC still has ONE mayor [New York being Japan). \n\nI guess the lack of mentioning of this structure hints at its non-existance, but I \nwas still wondering.\n\nthanks,\n\nRami.\n\n\n\n\n"
