Mostly for a convention, but while I&#39;m there I&#39;d like to visit a sake plant and also a katana blade forge.  Here&#39;s where y&#39;all come in...  A while ago I was reading about kendo and found out about this excellent company--Tokyo Blade Company or Japan Blade Company or something like that--that is supposed to be tops when it comes to manufacturing the multi-layer blades that made Samurai so famous, infamous, and generally reckoned.  Its also a rather large company and they offer tours of the forging premises by appointment and I&#39;d like to find out more about that cuz it&#39;d be very sad to miss a blade forge in Japan...  But I can&#39;t remember the name of the company and I haven&#39;t been able to find the page, again.\n\nDoes this ring a bell w/anybody?  What is this company?  Do you know of any similar companies?\n\nMany thnx in advance.\n\n\nLord, of your grace all that I hope is this--\nKeep the realm of my pleasure prosperous,\nAvert from me the calamity of chastity,\nAnd keep far from me the doom of repentance.\n~&#39;Ubayd-i Zaakaanii  \nhttp://www.livejournal.com/~sjcarpediem \n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
