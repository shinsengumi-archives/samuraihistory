I\nwill look through these \nlinks and see what I can discover.  As for the\nscrolls/books show by Mr. \nRichardson I think we might be on a different page. \nThe kind of scroll I am \ntalking about is the decorative one hung on the wall\nwith Shohou work done \non it.  I could be wrong and the information I seek\nmight very well be in \nyour links.
