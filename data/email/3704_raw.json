He was a whacko writer (how can you read his\nbooks? The only one I could finish was Kinkakuji, and\nthat was for a class) who acted more in a moral and\nartistic protest than an attempt to really overthrow\nthe government or anything. That&#39;s very interesting\nabout the seppuku...how it was botched and so forth.\nThe movie about his live is very interesting, and he\nwas actually acting in a play at one point where his\ncharacter committed seppuku--I wonder how much he came\nto associate with that character. He was clearly\nmental, to say the least. \n\nNate\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
