I&#39;m sure others on the list can come up with \nmore.  Otherwise, I myself have translated the beginings of two \nstories, one on the life of Takeda Shingen: \nhttp://www.techjapanese.com/samurai/shingent2.html and one one the \nlife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi: \nhttp://www.techjapanese.com/samurai/hideyoshit1.html  The \ntranslations are pretty much strait translations, I really didnt edit \nthem, just pretty much went word for word into english, so some of \nthe sentences might be a bit awkward...  Anyway, time permitting I&#39;ll \nadd to them.\n\nC. West\n\n\n"
