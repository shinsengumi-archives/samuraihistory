Perhaps the sword was given to your family when they became samurai, but it was already 100 years old at that time. Or perhaps 200 years after becoming a samurai family, the original sword broke and a new sword was made to replace it. It would be nice to have the sword as an heir-loom, but it would not have been reliable for finding out anything about your family history.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: JL Badgley \nDate: Monday, January 25, 2010 1:18 am\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] how did samurai get their last name?\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n\n&gt; On Mon, Jan 25, 2010 at 2:01 PM, &lt;tamasaka@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks Josh! Been there & done that. Meaning my parents \n&gt; already been to Japan & checked out family records. They found \n&gt; records dating back to 1700. That is the furthest they got. \n&gt; Unfortunately, many families did not tell there stories to \n&gt; future generation how the family became samurai. My mother&#39;s \n&gt; family is one of them.\n&gt; &gt; U also mentioned a lower class samurai would pass down their \n&gt; katana. My understanding it was a tradition to honor the family \n&gt; sword & if possible to pass down to the next son. Regardless of \n&gt; status. Anyone really know for sure which one is correct?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s what I know:\n&gt; \n&gt; * There was a belief that the longer inanimate objects were \n&gt; kept, the\n&gt; more likely they were to develop a soul of some sort (there is a great\n&gt; Buddhist scroll about discarded items that have become animated\n&gt; through this process). This was not necessarily desirable, \n&gt; mind you.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Especially in the Edo period, people were big into the &quot;filial\n&gt; piety&quot; aspects of Confucianism. That meant that they would \n&gt; be likely\n&gt; to honor the items belonging to a revered ancestor.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Practicality suggests that no bushi family went around with 1 sword\n&gt; to their name. If you consider that each male adult in the \n&gt; family has\n&gt; to have two swords for formal occasions, how would having a single\n&gt; family sword work? Look at the Tokugawa house: There \n&gt; are MANY\n&gt; Tokugawa family swords out there--there are quite a few that are\n&gt; attributed to being used by Ieyasu himself. There are also many\n&gt; branches of the family, so do you think a special sword was formed\n&gt; every time a new branch was formed?\n&gt; \n&gt; * Swords rust/break/etc. The family doesn&#39;t dissolve because\n&gt; great-great-great-granfather&#39;s sword was lost in a fire. \n&gt; It is a\n&gt; terrible loss, yes, but it isn&#39;t like it was irreplaceable.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The habit of passing down swords from father to son I can definitely\n&gt; see (or father to daughter or son-in-law in some cases), and we know\n&gt; that it happened. However, I don&#39;t know of an overarching \n&gt; traditionof &quot;the&quot; family sword--that sounds like modern samurai \n&gt; romanticism.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Josh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Join the 2007 Samurai Fiction Contest: http://www.samurai-\n&gt; archives.com/writcon2.htmlYahoo!
