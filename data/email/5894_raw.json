See I&#39;m an ABC (Australian Born\n&gt; Chinese). Thing \n&gt; is, I know more about Japanese history then I do my\n&gt; own. I know very \n&gt; little about Chinese history and what I do know\n&gt; about Australian \n&gt; history is what I have learnt from school. To me\n&gt; Australian history \n&gt; is very hmm how would you say? &quot;Mind-numbing&quot;, we\n&gt; only have around \n&gt; two hundred years of history so it isn&#39;t as\n&gt; impressive as other \n&gt; cultures. I do have an interest in Chinese history,\n&gt; however is not a \n&gt; priority for me at the moment. One day, sometime in\n&gt; the near future I \n&gt; do plan on correcting this. So I guess what I&#39;m\n&gt; asking is, are there \n&gt; others that know more about a specific culture then\n&gt; they do their own.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zev\n\nHi, fellow chinese.\n\nFirst off, we tend to use the term ABC for American\nBC, not Australian BC ;) (we as in Singaporeans :p)\n\nSecondly, I am of a similar situation, interested more\nin Japanese history (started by Shogun Total War) and\nculture in general (anime fan myself), than of the\nhistory of my own culture.\n\nOne good thing about living in Singapore is that we do\nget to watch historical dramas made by PRC (far more\nauthentic than what ROC and HK churns out).\n\nAs someone else said, ask your parents and\ngrandparents on they know. Likewise, libraries and the\ninternet offers quite a lot of information to begin\nwith. Of course, there are a lot of less than\nauthentic information out there. A little experience\nwill help you to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\n=====\nDon&#39;t think your swords and clothes should be as good as those of other people. Be content as long as they don&#39;t look awful. Once you start acquiring what you don&#39;t have and become even poorer, you&#39;ll become a laughingstock.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ALL-NEW Yahoo!
