Owning land has nothing to do with your race and or\nnationality. If I managed to make it through the\nconvoluted laws and buy a piece of land here in Tokyo,\nthat still does not make me Japanese. \n\n2. &quot;Japanese&quot; is a race as well as a nationality.\nJapanese are not &quot;WHITE&quot;, otherwise known as\nCaucasian. They are Japanese. If you want something\nmore general, you could say Asian, but Japanese are\ndistinct racially from other Asian groups.\n\n3. The whole Snoop Dogg thing--IT&#39;S A JOKE!
