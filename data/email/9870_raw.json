The ninja was said \nto have hid in the lavatory, more like a l=\r\natrine for three days \nwaiting for his target to come to that particular on=\r\ne, when the \ntarget did indeed arrive he was stabbed from below [yes the ni=\r\nnja was \nstood in the actual sewer stream] and killed.\n\nThis story blossome=\r\nd from the rumours that the Oda had him \nassassinated. This was mainly due =\r\nto the timely death which benefited \nthe Oda enormously.\n\nHowever, many Jap=\r\nanese scholars believe he contracted a severe \nillness, stomach cancer is m=\r\nentioned, and thereby died.\n\nThe legend of the assassination is a little mo=\r\nre colourful but a lot \nless likely - but who knows\n\n\n"
