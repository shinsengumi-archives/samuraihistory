This is my first time with this email\ngroup and I thought I would take a breif momnet to say\nhi to all the other members.\n\nNow on to my question. I have a intrest in the Shimazu\nClan of Satsuma province. I was told that Satsuma\nproduced some of the most fearsome No-dachi samurai.\nIs there any truth to this.\n\nAlso were the Shimazu invovled in putting down the\nShimabara Reblion of 1637-1638.\n\nAny help on these questions will be greatly\nappreaciated as well as any other information\nregarding the Shimazu.\n\nNote: I have read the article on Shimazu Yoshihisa and\nIriki-In Shigetomo.\n\nThank you,\n\nJake\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
