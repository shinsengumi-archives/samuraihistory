As such, they cannot=\r\n be taken as objects of refuge. However, because of their relative existenc=\r\ne as relative gods, they can be paid respect to, and thus, shrines within t=\r\nhe Temple grounds are common for such things.\n&gt; =C2=A0Even in other countri=\r\nes, like Bhutan or Thailand, you will see this respect paid in such a way.=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0Within Buddhism --- which actually is a west=\r\nern word.. the real name of the religion is simply &quot;The Teachings of Actual=\r\n Truth as expressed by the Buddhas&quot; .. a.k.a. The Dharma or Buddha Dharma..=\r\n..=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0In Buddha Dharma,=C2=A0 you can show respect to any class=\r\n of sentient being, including gods, as long as you don&#39;t worship them or ta=\r\nke them as your refuge. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 So.. paying respect and homage and even making an offering is fine. \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0In this way, &quot;Buddhism&quot; does not conflict with most religion=\r\ns, especially religions like shinto.=C2=A0 The only religions in conflicts =\r\nwith are the religions were a god demands you take him/her as your sole ref=\r\nuge (most Monotheistic religions).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0Sometimes, earthly gods=\r\n vow to protect dharma and assist the Sangha...and they become Worldly Prot=\r\nectors.=C2=A0 It is important to note that Worldly Protectors are earth god=\r\ns associated with Dharma... and that &quot;Dharma Protectors&quot; are actually proje=\r\nctions/emanations of Buddhas/Bodhisattvas.=C2=A0 Thus, sometimes you see sa=\r\nngha members treating a protector with refuge, it might look weird. However=\r\n, if you know they are not a Worldly Protector, but a Dharma Protector, the=\r\nn you understand they are paying refuge to a Buddha.=C2=A0 So you need to k=\r\nnow if that being is a worldly protector or a dharma protector. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 In the earlier letter, it sounded like he (=\r\nEddie?)=C2=A0was saying that Buddha&#39;s God was Amida ? Maybe I read that wro=\r\nng-- but let me just correct this just in case.\n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0 Buddha h=\r\nas no god. This is because Dharma teaches two realities 1.) relative and 2.=\r\n) Absolute.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0The=C2=A0 relative reality is &quot;run&quot; by Interde=\r\npendet Origination, which manifest as different types of karma (Yes.. there=\r\n are actually different types of karma, not just &quot;karma&quot;). This system is, =\r\nin a nutshell, a system of cause-and-result. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0The absolute=\r\n truth is the buddhanature a.k.a. nature of mind etc.etc... \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0 At no point in this equation is there a &quot;god&quot;.=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0Amida, better known as Amitabha or Amitayus (Infinite Light) (Infinit=\r\ne Life)... is the Buddha who radiates the &quot;western paradise&quot;..=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\nwhich, in all seriousness, is like a world that was purified due to Amitabh=\r\na&#39;s enligthenment.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0 How did this happen ?\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0 Bec=\r\nause of Interdependent Origination.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0Amitabha made a series=\r\n of vows and those vows were interdependent with his awakening. As he awoke=\r\n, these vows ripened.=C2=A0 Most Buddhas have some kind of &quot;related power&quot;.=\r\n. that upon awakening, their vow ripens into that power ...so to speak.=C2=\r\n=A0 Amitabha vowed that his awakening would be interconnected with the pufi=\r\ncation of the world he was practicing on, and that once he attained enlight=\r\nenment, his radiance would produce this pure field. \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0 Another=\r\n vow that was ripened was that if you focus on Amitabha PROPERLY, you can c=\r\nonnect with his radiance from your concentration meeting with his ripened v=\r\now. \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0 O.k... many people have seemingly misunderstood how=\r\n this works. Most Amitabha practice was become really just Buddha-Christ=C2=\r\n=A0 god-worshiping and &quot;save me Oh Amida!&quot; kinda of methodology.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The real idea is that you take Amitabha, the Pure Land,=\r\n His vows..etc.etc.. AS YOUR OBJECT OF CONCENTRATION... and through the pro=\r\ncess of meditating and concentrating on these, you will create the connecti=\r\non with it. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0 It is actually suppose to be a form of medit=\r\nation... not salvation worship.=C2=A0 However, as most of the common folk, =\r\nsuch as farmers and merchents, don&#39;t have time, leisure, or training on how=\r\n to properly concentrate on an object or to meditate, the system of &quot;Amida&#39;=\r\ns salvation if you call out to him&quot; came into effect...\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0be=\r\ncause, if their faith in Amitabha can be sustain in their mind, they will K=\r\nEEP Amitabha in their thoughts constantly...\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0.. then this =\r\nMIGHT produce the same result as if you were properly meditating on Amitabh=\r\na.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 However, this must be un=\r\nderstood to be an alteration to the actual program/system of accomplishing =\r\nthe Pure Land. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Amitabha was never taught, by the Buddhas, to be a &quot;g=\r\nod&quot; or a &quot;savior&quot; --- He is a meditation technique, actually.=C2=A0 All fou=\r\nr variations of the Pure Land sutra teach this, and in the esoteric Amitabh=\r\na rituals teach this as well.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0 In this case :=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 &quot;Faith&quot; =3D &quot;Mental Concentration&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0 It should be noted=\r\n that one can make contact, in theory, with ANY Buddha or Bodhisattva via t=\r\nhis method of mental concentration, not just Amitabha.=C2=A0 The &quot;key diffe=\r\nrence&quot; of Amitabha is the being born into the Pure Field part. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0I h=\r\nope this puts this into proper perspective. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 2/16/10, Cear=\r\nb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re:=\r\n [samuraihistory] Shinto and Buddhism\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n=\r\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, February 16, 2010, 11:08 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Edd=\r\nie--\n&gt; \n&gt; My understanding of the history is that Shinto is an animistic re=\r\nligion \n&gt; indigenous to Japan, and that there was a certain degree of tensi=\r\non between \n&gt; Buddhism and Shinto when Buddhism was first introduced (as yo=\r\nu said) from \n&gt; China, but that the two religions became, if not precisely =\r\nsyncretic, then at \n&gt; least interwoven -- that it was to a large extent hel=\r\nd that the kami of \n&gt; Shinto were genuine entities who, like all others, co=\r\nuld benefit from the \n&gt; Buddha&#39;s enlightenment. (Hence the fact that Shinto=\r\n shrines are such a common \n&gt; fixture in so many Buddhist temples).\n&gt; \n&gt; I =\r\ngot the impression that this changed substantially during the Meiji \n&gt; rest=\r\noration and into WWII, when the government pressed the notion of the \n&gt; Imp=\r\nerial lineage (the descent from Amaterasu-o- Mikami) as evidence that Japan=\r\n was \n&gt; under the unique protection of the gods / kami, as a result of whic=\r\nh a very \n&gt; strict separation of church and state was written into the post=\r\n-war \n&gt; constitution. ..\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I missing anything substantial here? My pe=\r\nrsonal experience of Japan \n&gt; was that the temples and shrines were largely=\r\n appreciated for their historic \n&gt; nature; I seldom saw religious ceremonie=\r\ns going on (apart from New Year&#39;s \n&gt; Day, when people arrived, made their o=\r\nfferings, and departed) the way I did \n&gt; in Korea, for example.
