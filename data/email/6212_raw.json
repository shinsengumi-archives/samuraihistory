You too, eh?  Well, that&#39;s sure the effect it has when you&#39;ve read it.\n&gt; But it sounds better coming from you than if I&#39;d said that.  A delightful\n&gt; book.  (The somewhat endless sequels are fun as well, but none of them hold\n&gt; a candle to the first.)\n\nAgreed. I&#39;m a particular fan of Sherlock Holmes, so I really enjoyed &quot;The \nHolmes-Dracula File&quot; -- &quot;An Old Friend of the Family&quot; was good, too. &quot;Thorn,&quot; I \nthought, was not the strongest in the series...\n\n&gt; Interesting that you did a paper on him - as soon as I wrote that about the\n&gt; quality of Saberhagen&#39;s research, I thought - &quot;O Gods - there&#39;s some Tony\n&gt; out there who&#39;s going to nail my ignorance here!&quot;  (I know more about the\n&gt; Turks than I do about the Romanians, and while _Tape_ fit into that picture\n&gt; pretty credibly, still, it was a stretch.)\n&gt; ...And people worry they can&#39;t find affirmation on this list.\n\nLOL! Well, to me as a big lover of medieval history, and as an Eastern Orthodox \nfellow, Vlad Tepes kinda has to be a standout. :)\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
