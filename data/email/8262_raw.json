In short, any information that could be useful.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; thank you very much.\n&gt;\n\nFor starters, you would want to call it the &quot;mode=\r\nrn MISCONCEPTION of\nSamurai culture in Western movies, and how Samurai cult=\r\nure is being\ncriminalized in Western movies. I don&#39;t have the time at the m=\r\noment to\naddress this fully, but the consequences is that it reinforces the=\r\n\nlong held stereotypes and does nothing to show the real history. There\nare=\r\n a lot of people here than I&#39;m sure agree with me. You&#39;ve come to\nthe right=\r\n place with  your topic. I hope others here speak up. Nate,\nTony - get to w=\r\nork! &lt;g&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
