My name is Tim and I have been studying\n&gt; Japanese history for about six years now and take the strongest interest in\n&gt; the history of feudal Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now the question: I watched a Kurosawa movie &quot;Kagemusha&quot; and then read that\n&gt; the among the scenes, where various warlords discuss whether Takeda died or\n&gt; not (and of course then, when they learn that he indeed died) there are Oda\n&gt; and Tokugawa.  I heard or read somewhere that in the version of this movie\n&gt; shown on the national Japanese TV broadcast, there was also Uesugi.  There\n&gt; also of course a legend about weeping Uesugi regretting the loss of the\n&gt; greatest enemy.  Why was this scene cut out of the version which went on\n&gt; international sale/rent?\n\nThe original Japanese version was about four minutes longer.\n\nThe scenes were cut for one reason: Nobunaga and Ieyasu had scenes together,\nso they had a sense of subplot. Uesugi didn&#39;t have scenes with the others, and\nthe people who brought it over for us (Fox) felt that *three* enemies would be\ntoo difficult to remember or keep track of.\n\nThat plus the fact that Uesugi was well known in Japan as Shingen&#39;s great\nhistoric rival, but for this story he was a side character and totally\nunnecessary. The Japanese audience would know who he was when they saw him and\nwould know back story. We wouldn&#39;t, so why confuse the issue? It&#39;s like a\nmovie in the US throwing in a reference to &quot;Babe the Blue Ox&quot; -- we&#39;d know\nthat means that Paul Bunyon was involved somehow, but people in Japan wouldn&#39;t\nknow about that because that&#39;s not part of their national\nculture/history/identity. Rather than try to figure out how to explain it, if\nit didn&#39;t matter, they&#39;d just cut it.\n\n\nTony\n\n\n"
