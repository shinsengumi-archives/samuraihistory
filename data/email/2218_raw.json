Let me introduce myself. My name is Martin, \n&gt; I&#39;m from Quebec City, Canada. I&#39;ve done a couple of different \n&gt; japanese martial arts in the last 15 years. I stopped for a while but \n&gt; I&#39;m about to return to it. I&#39;m also in the SCA ans as you probably \n&gt; suspect, my persona is japanese. My SCA name is Fukushima Masanari \n&gt; Hanzo, a late Heian imperial guard. \n&gt;    Now the question.\n&gt;    I&#39;m searching about some kind of ceremonial &quot;passing of power&quot;, or \n&gt; any info about how the samurai daimyo steps down and how daimyo were \n&gt; promoted, etc. In fact, we have a small japanese household here and \n&gt; the leader is stepping down and want to give the power to someone \n&gt; else. We would like to do it the more authentic possible. I know that \n&gt; sometimes a Daimyo takes over a household by killing the former \n&gt; ruler, but we are searching about something more peaceful. \n&gt; \n&gt;    Than you very much about your future advices.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Martin \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
