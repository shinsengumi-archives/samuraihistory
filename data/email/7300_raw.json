Not the armor or the swords but the codes they took up.  Is chivalry and ,the later code, busido simalar or are they very different?  Those are the qeustions I were wondering and never got the the chance to research and find out about.  I would be most pleased if one of you answerd my question.  I have some information on samuraies but not a lot because of my limited resources. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
