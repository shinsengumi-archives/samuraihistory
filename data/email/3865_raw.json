I love Japan and I \nreally love the culture I&#39;ve been reading about Samurai for sometime \nknow and I found out quite a bit about the whole westernised Japan \nand stuff but I want to know MORE especially after seeing the \nmovie... which I love no matter what anyone says! I think it was a \nreally good depiction... if anyone wants to bitch about a really \ncrappy movie involving Japan watch Lost In Translation! It the worst! \nAnyhoo.... hope someone can answer my question or help me out.... \nARIGATO!!!!!\n\n\n"
