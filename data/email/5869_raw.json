Perhaps this link might refresh your \n&gt; memory: http://www.ska.org/funakoshi.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; That the teachings of Master Funakoshi and a selection of those of \nbushido seem to have melded is both a somewhat serendipitous and \n&gt; also a consciously adopted modern practice.  But it was not planned \nso by Master Funakoshi, and the samurai class was long disbanded \n&gt; before his time.  I would go so far as to propose the thought that \nkarate and the samurai had a common ancestor in the precepts of \n&gt; other oriental teachings:  Shinto, Tao, Buddhism, and probably \nothers I&#39;m too tired to bring into mind after a long hard shift at \n&gt; the hospital, so I must ask forgiveness...........\n&gt; \n&gt; My sensei studied with both Masters Funakoshi & Nakayama in Japan. \nI met Master Nakayama once, and Master Nishayama several times. \n&gt; It might do you well to reread their writings and take them to \nheart as well as practice.  You do them no honor with your behavior \n&gt; on this list.  None of these esteemed men advocated anger, \nrudeness,  or ego.  All three can cloud your mind and affect your \n&gt; responses --- physically, emotionally, spiritually---- and not for \nthe better.  In fact,  I remember Master Nakayama advocating to \n&gt; keep &#39;beginner&#39;s mind&#39; with whatever one pursued, at whatever level \nof mastery, in whatever area of your life..... because then your \n&gt; mind would be prepared to learn, to see things anew, and not \nblocking off learning.  It is with this spirit that one remains \nhumble, \n&gt; peaceful, and receptive to our environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope that you receive the feedback you have gotten from me, and \nthe others in the best possible light, and choose to learn from us \n&gt; instead of rejecting our message.  It is of course, yours to \ndecide, but will you choose a path that leads to reduction of \nconflict, \n&gt; into a peaceful place within your mind, or will you fight and \npursue conflict with all that you cannot control until the light that \n&gt; is you is worn down, shriveled, and dim, so that you live in cold \nshadow, alone with your gnawing anger that will never be \n&gt; satisfied.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rest well,  and wake up to a new day, a new opportunity,\n&gt; \n&gt; LizzieC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: zevlord\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 02, 2004 6:45 PM\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai and Zen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Then perhaps you have not studied true JKA Karate, there is such a\n&gt; strong influence from Bushido it is so plain. I suggest you study \nfor\n&gt; a longer length of time. Try reading some of the books by Funakoshi,\n&gt; Demura and Nakayama. Or you could e-mail the mother association in\n&gt; Tokyo the JKA. The web site is www.jka.or.jp\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I strongly suggest you do more research into the Samurai and\n&gt; martial arts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Well if you are talking about the Japanese Karate Association then I\n&gt; have studied with the Australian branch of this affiliation and I\n&gt; don&#39;t think that now after so many years of training I would be\n&gt; exposed to bushido. It just doesn&#39;t work like that. If there was\n&gt; Bushido influences then I would have be made aware of this on the\n&gt; very first day or at least after a few weeks. I have been studying\n&gt; martial arts sine the age of 5, training in many different styles,\n&gt; majority of them being Japanese, However I have studied wing Chun\n&gt; briefly. I agree with continues researching as this broadens the \nmind\n&gt; and help you to realise that not everything you read is correct and\n&gt; you learn to take some things with a grain of salt. A trait, which I\n&gt; believe, you should inherit.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\nI agree with what you say, but may I ask too whom this is directed to?\n\nZev\n\n\n\n\n"
