And the new power defeated =\r\nthe other one to establish New Government , Meiji Government.\n\nBy the way ,=\r\n do you know who did open Japan&#39;s door which used be closed against foreign=\r\n countries ?\n\nSince then, Japan really were forced to be changed, to be rev=\r\noluted to face with barbarians through The pacific Ocean&#39;s war.\n\nJapan got =\r\nthe tiny bud of destiny to fight against them later at that time.\n\nYour com=\r\nment on the above will be highly appreciated.\n\nEddie\n\n\n&quot;Haynes, A (Angus)&quot; =\r\n&lt;angus.haynes@ rabobank. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n&gt;The movie The Last Samurai... is it=\r\n a real part of history or not?\n\nThe movie itself is, yes. It was released =\r\nin 2003 and as such, is now part of our history.\n\nThe events in the movie? =\r\nNo. Some of the characters and events are VERY LOOSELY based on real histor=\r\ny, but 99% of it is Holywood fantasy. Read the book &#39;The Last Samurai: The =\r\nLife and Battles of Saigo Takamori&#39; by Mark Ravina for the real history beh=\r\nind the character Katsumoto was based on.\n\n-AngusH\n\n____________ _________ =\r\n_________ _________ _________ _________ _\n\nThis email, including any attach=\r\nments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal atte=\r\nntion of the intended recipient.
