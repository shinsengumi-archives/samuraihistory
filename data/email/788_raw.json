It is all too often true that without\nthe kanji it is impossible to make one.\n    If you haven&#39;t access to the kanji perhaps you know your Great Grand\nMothers family name? Could yours be Tanei Kou? In your Great grandmothers time\ngirls names without the appellation -ko  were the norm for lower to middle\nclass families. In the Taisho/Showa period Tane-ko, Kinu-ko, Yuu-ko and the\nlike became popular. Could you be Okou san and your family name is Tanei? More\nspeculation from the beach.\n\npray for surf\nTom\n\n\n"
