The Japanese Art  \nSword Preservation Society NBTHK, and the Japanese Sword Preservation  \nSociety NTHK, both have monthly meetings in Tokyo, many of the  \nmembers are like minded individuals with a deep appreciation of  \nJapanese Art, History, Politics and of course Arms and Armour. New  \nmembers are always welcome and I am sure you can find other groups  \nlike this one, thru contacts there.\n\tI would also suggest keeping an eye out for museum exhibitions  \nfeaturing reenactment groups, they do exist in Japan and while some  \nare given to cardboard costumes many are serious collectors and  \nstudents of history. If you are indeed in Tokyo you are sure to find  \na world of people and things to satisfy your interest.\nin envy,\n-t\nwww.ncjsc.org\nhttp://www.touken.or.jp/\n\nOn Aug 23, 2006, at 4:39 AM, rodjuri wrote:\n\n&gt; Greetings:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am Rodrigo Juri.

I mean... not truly academic ones,\n&gt; but neither anime-like ones. Although, if a truly academic one is open\n&gt; for public, could be of help anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; And... how many of yours are in Tokyo actually? Do you do same kind of\n&gt; periodical meetings or convention? I would like to join such kind of\n&gt; effort, if it is possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ahhh... please forgive my bad english... I am not a native english\n&gt; speaker, I am chilean so far.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you everybody.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
