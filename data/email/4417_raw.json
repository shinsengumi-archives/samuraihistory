In an interview with PrimaGames for the \nPlayStation game Onimusha 2: Samurai&#39;s Destiny, executive producer Inafune \nKeiji said that one reason he (Nobunaga) was portrayed as a villain was because, \nin Japan (and I&#39;m only paraphrasing his answer, not adding my own pitiful \n&quot;expertise&quot;), Oda Nobunaga is seen as a hero, even though he was considered brutal \neven for the time he lived.  They made him the villain to show people this \nsometimes-forgotten side of him.  And I wouldn&#39;t knock these games too much, \neveryone.  It&#39;s what got ME interested in this time in Japan&#39;s history in the \nFIRST place!  :-)  L8r\n\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
