It shows a true understanding of martial \narts rather than an ego that &quot;mine&quot; is best.\n\nBack to history to prevent further derailment. People today glorify the \nsamurai the same way post warring era samurai glorified their predecessors. \nWar is a dirty business in which a few shine and most rise to the occaision. \nIt was true for the samurai, for knights of Europe, tribesmen in Africa, and \nany other warring group in history.\n\nMichael\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Jacob S.&quot; &lt;DerangedCountrySideCowboyRonin@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] What made japan a superior warrior nation?\n&gt;Date: Sat, 1 Dec 2007 12:28:02 -0800\n&gt;\n&gt;I agree with Tom Morford, there is no reason to believe that the nation of\n&gt;Japan was a superior warrior society, I think legends of ninja and such are\n&gt;the only reason westerners have this idea... if you wanted to talk martial\n&gt;arts I wouldn&#39;t say that they had the greatest fighting styles, even though\n&gt;I prefer kendo, it really depends on the individual who is enlightened in\n&gt;martial skills, not necessarily a nation..\n&gt;\n&gt;**this is the part when martial artists in this group pounce on me**\n&gt;\n&gt;On Dec 1, 2007 5:35 AM, Tom Morford &lt;tmorford@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   In all honesty, I don&#39;t think that they were a superior warrior \n&gt;nation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I believe that the warrior ethic of unquestioned loyalty that preferred\n&gt; &gt; death to failure was, however noble sounding, the undoing of the \n&gt;Japanese in\n&gt; &gt; dealing with the rest of the world.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They had long lived grand feudal societies because of their physical\n&gt; &gt; isolation, and brutal swift justice systems that maintained them. But \n&gt;these\n&gt; &gt; enabling factors did not produce a warrior class superior to any other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are many other reasons to study and admire the Samurai, and the\n&gt; &gt; culture that created them. But comparing them as individuals or as a\n&gt; &gt; national body, to those of any other nation, will only bring you to\n&gt; &gt; similarities, not superiorities.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: Chris Olson\n&gt; &gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com &lt;samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, November 26, 2007 7:46 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] What made japan a superior warrior nation?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What made japan a superior warrior nation?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Be a better pen pal.\n&gt; &gt; Text or chat with friends inside Yahoo!
