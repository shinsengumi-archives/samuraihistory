It tells about the attack, how the rider \n&gt; was driven off by Hara Osumi, etc.  But NOWHERE in that passage \ndoes \n&gt; it mention that the rider was Kenshin!  After the passage, there is \na \n&gt; single line-- It says something to the effect of &#39;later, it was \nsaid \n&gt; this was Terutora&#39; (my reading of Kobun is not very advanced, but \n&gt; it&#39;s a short sentence that looks something like &#39;Ato Kikeba&#39; the \n&gt; warrior terutora (followed by the Kanji for &#39;mousu&#39; combined with \nthe \n&gt; kanji for kou/sourou (10 strokes, ninben).  So it looks to me like \n&gt; the Koyo Gunkan doesn&#39;t even really claim it was Kenshin at all, \nonly \n&gt; that later it was said it was.  I guess some playwrite for some Noh \n&gt; drama about 4th Kawanakajima in the 18th century must have decided \nit \n&gt; would be nice and epic if he had kenshin and shingen fight it out \n&gt; onstage, and that is how it got started that shingen and \n&gt; kenshin &#39;definately fought&#39; at that battle....? anyone have any \n&gt; insight?  I know someone mentioned another source that said it was \n&gt; thier Kagemusha fighting each other....\n\n\n"
