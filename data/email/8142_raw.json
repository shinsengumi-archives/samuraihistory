You are right to say someone is  the best samurai is too broad. Can we say with his contributions to the two swords school and phlilosophy can we at lease say he is the best at that. He is not my favorite samurai or any thing I just like him. I  give up though I can not fight your point, samurai is too broad and I do not have much of any thing solid to fight his case but... hopefully those that started this are in the back with their history books just waiting to jump out at you guys with tons of knowledge ( you may already know ) from  two directions like how Musashi might have.
