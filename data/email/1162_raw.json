Samurai as a class evolved through\nJapan=\r\nese history; Samurai are unusual in that a military group became the\nupper =\r\nclass of Japanese society.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no\nanalog=\r\n to this exists in the West.  \n\nFurthermore, at whatever point in time that=\r\n you look at, the Samurai class\nis also hierarchical; there is a stratifica=\r\ntion, just like you see in any\nmodern army.  \n\nWeapons and armor should be =\r\nlooked at in this fashion.  \n\n&gt;Here are some quick answers to your question=\r\ns Dan. \n&gt;\n&gt;1. Can you give me some information on the orgin of the samurai?=\r\n\n&gt;A: They evolved out of military and house servants of the Heian \n&gt;period.=\r\n  The term samurai is the Japanese pronounciation of a sankrit \n&gt;word that =\r\nmeans &quot;to serve&quot;.  There is a book entitled HIRED SWORDS: \n&gt;THE RISE OF PRI=\r\nVATE WARRIOR POWER IN EARLY JAPAN by Karl Friday.\n\nExcellent reference.  Pr=\r\nof. Friday is also a martial artist as well as a\nprof. of Asian History.  H=\r\nis waza (techniques) are as good as his prose; I\nhave trained with him seve=\r\nral times.  \n  \n[SNIP]\n\n&gt;3. What weapons and armour were preferred by the s=\r\namurai?\n&gt;A:Durring the time of warfare the spear was the most commonly used=\r\n \n&gt;weapon.  Both foot soldiers and samurai were armed with spears as \n&gt;they=\r\n were seen as the most practical.  Durring the time of peace \n&gt;after the To=\r\nkugawa re-unification is when the sword became the main \n&gt;weapon of the sam=\r\nurai, although it had always been a symbol of the \n&gt;warrior, it was seconda=\r\nry until that time.\n\nAs in the preface, this depends on the time period and=\r\n the hierarchical\nposition of the Samurai.  \n\nDuring the civil wars that pr=\r\nedated the Tokugawa shogunate, the infantry\nused Yari (spears) and Naginata=\r\n (halberds, in this case, literally\nsaber-like blades on long poles), while=\r\n the cavalry used Yumi (Japanese\nlong bows).  Mounted warriors also wore Ta=\r\nchi (a long saber slung across\nthe back with the blade down, which had to d=\r\no with the drawing style while\nmounted, &quot;ground-to-sky&quot;) - mounted cavalry =\r\narmed with sabers persisted in\nthe West into the 20th century.  \n\nJust a no=\r\nte here: a Japanese blade is a saber blade, which is single-edged\nand curve=\r\nd, and not a sword, which is double-edged and straight.  The term\n&quot;samurai =\r\nsword&quot; referring to the Tachi or the Katana is technically a\nmisnomer.  \n\nT=\r\nhe use of firearms by the warlord Oda Nobunaga in 1582 brought an end to\nth=\r\ne mounted archers.  &quot;Giving Up the Gun: Japan&#39;s Reversion to the Sword,\n154=\r\n3-1879&quot; by Noel Perrin is an attempt to highlight this particular\nphenomeno=\r\nn; unfortunately, Perrin&#39;s scholarship is shaky at best.  \n\nAfter, the foun=\r\ndation of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603, the fighting army\nunits including=\r\n the cavalry were disbanded.  The Tachi gave way to the\nKatana, a saber of =\r\nless curvature than the Tachi, worn thrust the Obi (wide\nsash under the Hak=\r\nama) with the blade up (which had to do with the drawing\nstyle while standi=\r\nng, &quot;sky-to-ground&quot;) .  The symbol of office of the\nSamurai was the Daisho,=\r\n a Daito (long saber) and Shoto (short saber) worn\non the left hip: there w=\r\nere no left-handed swordsmen, which persists to\nthis day in Kendo and Iaido=\r\n, as well as classical styles of Kenjutsu.  In\ngeneral, the Daito was used =\r\noutdoors (it was typically removed when\nindoors), and the Shoto was used in=\r\ndoors.  No one else was permitted to\nwear arms in public.  \n\nSword lengths =\r\nwere eventually regulated by Shogunal edict as was dueling. \nEven travel be=\r\ntween the various fiefdoms was a burcratic nightmare as\ntravel was tightly =\r\nregulated.  As the ruling c;ass, Samurai became the\nbureaucrats for the Bak=\r\nufu (tent government) in Edo (Tokyo), which was\nestablished as a separate e=\r\nntity from the Imperial court in Kyoto, and\ntheir own lords.  \n\n&quot;Musashi,&quot; =\r\na historical novel by Eiji Yoshikawa (Charles S. Terry,\ntranslator) capture=\r\ns some of the spirit of the transition between civil\nwar, Sengoku Jidai, an=\r\nd the emergence of the Tokugawa shogunate.   \n\nBy the mid-1600&#39;s, most of t=\r\nhe battle-hardened warriors had died, but the\ntraining continued.  New tech=\r\nniques emerged, but most were never\nbattle-tested, and many ineffective one=\r\ns were introduced.  Bujutsu (martial\nscience) gave way to budo (martial art=\r\n), a way of building character\nthrough a martial practice (in a sense, it d=\r\nid not matter if techniques\nwere battle-proved).  Some techniques, however,=\r\n were proved effective in\ndueling, which is not really the same as being pr=\r\noven in battle.  Early\nforms of Kendo with body armor emerged as a way to s=\r\nafely train (in this\ncontext, &quot;safe&quot; meant &quot;non-fatal&quot; rather than &quot;injury-=\r\nfree&quot;).  \n\n[SNIP]\n\n&gt;5. What eventually led to the downfall of the samurai?\n=\r\n&gt;A:  In a simple way uselessness caused the fall of the samurai.  When \n&gt;th=\r\ne emporer tried to regain power the samurai class had not been in a \n&gt;major=\r\n battle in about 200 years and couldnt put up a real fight \n&gt;against the cl=\r\nans like Choshu and Satsuma that backed the Emporer.  \n&gt;But the emporer did=\r\n not want to risk the samurai becoming powerfull \n&gt;again so the clas was ab=\r\nolished in 1868.\n\nUltimately, the Samurai were superfluous.  During the Tok=\r\nugawa Shogunate, a\nmiddle class of merchants arose (commerce can thrive in =\r\na country at peace\nwith itself); the Bakufu restricted foreign trade to a s=\r\ningle port,\nNagasaki, for all of Japan.  \n\nThe appearance of the Black Ship=\r\ns lead by Commodore Perry in 1853 sent a\ndeath shutter through the ruling o=\r\nrganization as well as the class\nstructure of Japan.  The Bakufu had failed=\r\n to protect Japan (and the\nEmperor) from foreign &quot;invasion.&quot;  The Tokugawa =\r\nand related Han&#39;s\n(fiefdoms) retreated into themselves and became concerned=\r\n with\nself-preservation; they slowly capitulated to the foreign demands as =\r\na\nresult, which was met with disgust in other Han&#39;s in Japan.  As the Bakuf=\r\nu\nslowly lost its grip of control, several other Han&#39;s backed a policy of\ns=\r\nupporting the Emperor directly and expelling the foreigners.  Civil unrest\n=\r\ngrew.  Other foreign nations pressed demands on opening trade with Japan;\nt=\r\nhe Japanese feared that they would ultimately end up like China in that\nera=\r\n, becoming colonies of the western imperialistic nations.  Eventually,\nToku=\r\ngawa Yoshinobu (1837-1913), the 15th and final Tokugawa shogunate,\nrestored=\r\n power to the Emperor Meiji in 1868.  \n\n&quot;Ryoma: Life of a Renaissance Samur=\r\nai&quot; by Romulus Hillsborough highlights\nthis turbulent period at the end of =\r\nthe existence of the Samurai as a\nsocial class.  He is extremely important =\r\nto Japanese history at this\ncritical juncture, and we are only just learnin=\r\ng about it.  For example,\njust imagine ignoring Ben Franklin&#39;s role in the =\r\nfounding of the United\nStates of Ameria.  \n\nThe Emperor brought Japan out o=\r\nf its feudal era and into the industrial\nera.  As such, Japan had no Renais=\r\nsance period, no Reformation, and no\nIndustrial Revolution as in the West. =\r\n IMHO, this is the key to\nunderstanding modern Japan.  Imagine the Age of C=\r\nhivalry in Europe giving\nway to the Franco-Prussian War.  Furthermore, Japa=\r\nn distinguished itself as\na world-class fighting power in wars with China i=\r\nn 1894 and Russia in 1905,\nwhich is a huge leap from their state of conduct=\r\ning warfare in 1868.  Japan\nembraced many of the ideas and all of the techn=\r\nology of the Western\nnations.  Japanese people were sent abroad to study in=\r\n the West in order to\nbring back anything useful.  \n\nThe highly rigid class=\r\n structure that was set up during the Tokugawa\nshogunate was abolished and =\r\nwith it the Samurai as a class.  Wearing the\nDaisho in public was outlawed.=\r\n  The Cho-mage, the topknot of hair that was\nalso a distinctive characteris=\r\ntic of the Samurai, was also outlawed (it\nstill exists, however, in the upp=\r\ner ranks of professional Sumo wrestlers). \nIn the final analysis, the Samur=\r\nai, though inter-Han struggles,\nself-destructed with respect to the new soc=\r\nial order that emerged as a\nresult.  \n\nMost of the ex-Samurai did not fare =\r\nwell after the Meiji Restoration. \nThose who became merchants were mostly f=\r\nailures (as Samurai, money was not\na concern as it was beneath them to worr=\r\ny about such &quot;trivial&quot; matters). \n\nSome went into law enforcement, and some=\r\n went into government service,\nenjoying varying degrees of success.  A few =\r\nopened Dojo (practice halls)\nand taught martial arts like Japanese swordsma=\r\nnship and Jujutsu to the\npublic (which was a novelty as only Samurai were a=\r\nllowed to train with\nweapons).  \n\n&gt;Please someone correct me if I am wrong.=\r\n  I hope these answers will \n&gt;give you at least a starting point.\n\nThe Samu=\r\nrai, although they no longer exist as a class, had a profound\neffect in sha=\r\nping Japan as a nation and the Japanese as a people.  I have\npersonally met=\r\n Japanese people who will add in an introduction of\nthemselves and others t=\r\nhat they are from a Samurai family or that some\nblood relative (e.g., grand=\r\nfather or great grandfather) was a Samurai. \nThis would be like meeting a E=\r\nuropean today who would say that their\ngrandfather or great grandfather had=\r\n been a knight at the court in Camelot,\nfor example.  \n\nMost of us have hel=\r\nd some very romantic notions of Samurai and their lives\nand so-called ideal=\r\ns.  It is entirely undeserved.  &quot;Shogun&quot; by James\nClavell is a nice story b=\r\nut one seen through very thick rose-colored\nglasses (both the book [1976] a=\r\nnd the mini-series [1980] are important\nlandmarks in their respective media=\r\n) -- they are unbalanced.  \n\nHere are two counterbalancing books: \n\n&quot;Memoir=\r\ns of the Warrior Kumagai: A Historical Novel&quot; by Donald Richie\n(1999).  Don=\r\n&#39;t let the term Novel in the title through you; this is a good\nrendition of=\r\n life and times during the civil war between the Minamoto and\nTaira.  This =\r\nis the real story behind what becomes the well-loved, medieval\nepic , the &quot;=\r\nTale of the Heike&quot; (Heike is another pronunciation for Taira,\nwho were the =\r\n*losers* in this struggle).  This is analagous to Michael\nChriton&#39;s novel &quot;=\r\nEaters of the Dead&quot; (and the movie, &quot;The 13th Warrior,&quot;\nwhich is a pale ada=\r\nptation IMHO) or  John Champlin Gardner&#39;s novel\n&quot;Grendel&quot; being (hypothetic=\r\nally) plausible stories behind the Old English\nepic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; (I have =\r\na fondness for the Seamus Heaney translation,\nwhich is rendered in verse, r=\r\nather than prose, as it is in the original\nlanguage)\n\n&quot;Drunk as a Lord: Sam=\r\nurai Stories&quot; by Ryotaro Shiba (Eileen Kato,\ntranslator) (2001), as histori=\r\ncal fiction, focuses on four historical\nfigures during the late Edo period =\r\nafter the appearance of the Black Ships.\n Although the characters&#39; personal=\r\nities are somewhat fictionalized, the\npoint of this book as I see it is tha=\r\nt the Samurai were all too human, and\nthey, embedded in their culture and h=\r\nistorical events, were not really any\ndifferent in their behavior than us, =\r\nembedded within our culture and\nhistorical events.  \n\nHTH,\nRay Sosnowski\n=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n\n=3D\nRaymond Sosnowski                                 \n110742.522@compuser=\r\nve.com\n  Kaicho: Northeast Naginata Dokokai, Ashton, MD;\n  Assist.
