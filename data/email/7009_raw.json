Many swordsmiths\n&gt; incorporate Fujiwara, as well as Minamoto and\n&gt; occasionaly Taira into their\n&gt; signatures when signing swords even in modern times.\n\nIn the context of the question, it is true. The\nquestion was about awarding of the name by the\nEmperor. \n\n&gt; For instance I have a\n&gt; sword signed Minamoto Yoshimune dated 1941 but\n&gt; Yoshimune&#39;s actual family\n&gt; name was Takahashi. There seems no connection with\n&gt; the original families of\n&gt; these prestigious names.\n&gt; Clive Sinclaire\n\nThe fact that swordsmiths use the Minamoto or Fujiwara\nname doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an &quot;honorary&quot; title given to\nthem by some authoritative figure. You&#39;ll have to\nprovide more information than that--WHY do these\nswordsmiths use the names? Did they just decide to, or\ndid someone from the families lend them the name, or\nadopt them, or some such? You&#39;d have to show me some\nevidence that the Emperor &quot;granted&quot; these swordsmiths\nthe names for it to contradict my point. There are\numpteen &quot;Bizen no kami&quot; swordsmiths, but none of them\nactually governed the province--I think the topic of\nswordsmiths is ancillary to what Angus was trying to\nask. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
