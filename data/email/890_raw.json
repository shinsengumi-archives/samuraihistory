Anyhow I have found this site which has links to loads of old \nmaps http://www.lib.duke.edu/ias/eac/jpnmap.htm it is excellent the \ndetail on the maps is superb, shame I can&#39;t read Japanese as well as \nI&#39;d like.  Anyhow Edo stretts digital , from Tokyo university in \nTokyo has maps of samurai houses and daimyo residences cool I would \nsay. If anyone has any good maps I&#39;d appreciate a post ,anyhow I&#39;ll \ncontinue working on my project Later then.\n\nMark\n\n\n\n"
