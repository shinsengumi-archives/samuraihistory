Hayes is conclusively a proven\n&gt; hack, and I question anything that uses him as a source, as should\n&gt; anyone with any respect for Japanese history. In fact, there is no\n&gt; excuse for it. Let&#39;s all stop the petty griping, and accept that\n&gt; although the Ninja Documentary might be acceptable, it takes a \nserious\n&gt; hit in the credibility department due to the involvement of Hayes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Darn...and here I was hoping a dancing sword would find its way into \n&gt; the conversation...\n\nPlease don&#39;t feed the animals...\n\n\n\n"
