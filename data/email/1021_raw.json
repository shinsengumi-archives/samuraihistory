However, for those of you who didn&#39;t know, the fiction novel by James Clavell &#39;Shogun&#39; is based on actual history and characters.  (this was my introduction into the world of the samurai, actually)  The main characters are all based on Tokugawa, Ieyasu, Nobunaga, and the actual first Dutch ship to land in the Japans in 1598.\n\nI hope I don&#39;t sound hopelessly out of touch with this information, but if you would like to immerse yourself in the life that exsisted for the samurai during this time, you might want to check this book out.  Also the mini-series (if you go to your local video store) although the book is better.  And if you do please feel free to write me about it.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n***Also for all of your Japanese-English translation needs go to http://www.solon.org/cgi-bin/j-e\n\n \n\n\n&quot;Eagles may soar, but weasles don&#39;t get caught in jet engines.&quot;\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
