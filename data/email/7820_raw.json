Am I the only one that finds this=\r\n entire line\n&gt; &gt; of thought \n&gt; &gt; illogical?\n&gt; \n&gt; well samurai and knights w=\r\nere all soldiers. We still,\n&gt; unfortuneately, have a need for them. Not ill=\r\nogical\n&gt; but possible not thought out to it&#39;s conclusion.\n&gt; Looking for a m=\r\nideval (sp) relic instead of the actual\n&gt; modern version (i.e. military) I =\r\nbelieve is what the\n&gt; poster had in mind, but let&#39;s keep in mind that later=\r\n\n&gt; on in samurai history guns had an important role in\n&gt; battles so the pos=\r\nter would have to look into earlier\n&gt; samurai history\n&gt; \n\nLet&#39;s put it this=\r\n way:\n\n&quot;Samurai were all soldiers. Therefore all soldiers are Samurai.&quot;\n&quot;Sa=\r\nmurai followed Bushido. I follow Bushido. Therefore, I am a \nSamurai.&quot;\n\nNO.=\r\n NO. NO. Those are what you call a logical fallacy, and pathetic \nones at t=\r\nhat. Ideals don&#39;t make one a Samurai, carrying swords \ndoesn&#39;t make one a S=\r\namurai, being in the military most definately \ndoes not make one a Samurai =\r\n- over 100 years ago, you were born into \nit, a few hundred before that, yo=\r\nu could work your way into it.  \nNone of that is valid anymore, the class, =\r\ntitle, rank, and meaning \nis all gone, and anyone claiming to be a &#39;modern =\r\nSamurai&#39; is \nretarded.  They watched Ghost Dog and other propaganda, and \ns=\r\naid, &quot;I&#39;m gonna be like a Sammyrai&quot;.  Why doesn&#39;t anyone grasp the \nconcept=\r\n that saying &quot;I&#39;m a modern Samurai&quot; is IDENTICAL to \nsaying &quot;I&#39;m a Modern h=\r\noplite!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a modern caveman!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a modern \negyptian sword guard!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m=\r\n a modern Centurion&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a modern knight \nof the templar!&quot; Why is it that =\r\npeople can say something as inane \nand stupid as &quot;I&#39;m a modern Samurai&quot; and=\r\n get away with it?  It is \npathetic.  Just face reality and say &quot;I am a dor=\r\nk who reads the \nhagakure and acts all philosophical to justify to myself w=\r\nhy I&#39;m \nstill a virgin&quot;.  This STUPID topic comes up at least twice a year,=\r\n \narguing semantics is a terrible waste of time, and it gets more \naggrivat=\r\ning each time I see it.\n\n\n\n\n"
