If anything, he was the ultimate pragmatist.\n\n\n&gt; The way they were thinking and planning was a\n&gt; &quot;fruit&quot; of their&#39;s commitment to martial arts. By\n&gt; the way, it wasn&#39;t only a martial art but the way of\n&gt; thinking. \n&gt;   Matt\n\nSpoken like you subscribe to &quot;Martial Arts\nIllustrated&quot;. Look, I&#39;m not saying that martial arts\nexperience wouldn&#39;t have aided a decision or two, but\nit&#39;s ridiculous to say that Shinkage-ryu, or any\nmartial art, was the basis of the Tokugawa political\nconstruct. Inspired politician, great leader, and good\ngeneral--Tokugawa was all of these. Mystical martial\narts warrior king? Not so much. Considering at the end\nof his life he was fairly fat, I&#39;m not sure he did\nmuch training beyond the &quot;tempura-do&quot; school. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
