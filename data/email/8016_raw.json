Glad to find this place. I do have \na questio=\r\nn, although not really history related, hope the OT is OK - \nI&#39;m interested=\r\n in taking the Japanese language exam - not sure exactly \nwhat it is called=\r\n, but the test that has 4 levels.  I&#39;m interested in \ntaking the 1st or 2nd=\r\n level depending (I believe the lower the #, the \nharder the test). I can r=\r\nead Japanese pretty well, and deal in Japanese \nthrough my job, so I&#39;m sure=\r\n I&#39;d knock out the 3rd and 4th levels in my \nsleep. Just checking to see ac=\r\ntually when and where you can take the \ntest - I&#39;d like to take it in the s=\r\necond half of 2006 - I&#39;ll be moving \nto Oahu, Hawaii, so maybe the Universi=\r\nty of Hawaii Manoa does the \ntest?  I&#39;d do more searching around on my own,=\r\n but I&#39;m traveling for \nwork right now, and a little too burned out to go a=\r\nhead and do yet more \nresearch - and anyway, maybe there are people here in=\r\nterested in the \ntest as well, so hopefully a few people besides me will be=\r\nnefit. That \nstuff aside, I look forward to an interesting interchange on J=\r\napanese \nhistory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
