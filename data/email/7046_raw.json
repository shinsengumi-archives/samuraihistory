Actually, many Japanese soldiers who \nfought in Burma had previously campaigned in China. However, unlike in \nChina (at least until 1943) they were ordered to behave well toward the \nlocals in Southeast Asia, since there they were a &#39;liberation army.&#39; \nBut the training in China is definitely part of my research.\n\nThanks for the tip!! I hope it&#39;s good!! :oD\n\ncepo\n\n\nOn May 4, 2005, at 1:46 PM, Gillian Rubinstein wrote:\n\n&gt; Cepo, I know you said not China, but by a strange coincidence I had\n&gt; been meaning to post to ask if you or any one else knew of a book\n&gt; called Long the Imperial Way by Tasaki Hanama. A friend bought it for\n&gt; me in a second hand bookshop. This copy was printed in 1951 and\n&gt; went through several reprints immediately. I think the author must\n&gt; have been nissei from Hawai who got conscripted into the Imperial\n&gt; Army as the book was written in English.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s one of the best war books I&#39;ve ever read and the descriptions of \n&gt; the\n&gt; indoctrination and the brutality are quite detailed.  I wanted to know\n&gt; more about Tasaki and what happened to him after the war.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll see what else I can find from the Australia-Japan conflict\n&gt; perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; (and I would love to read the results)\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Gillian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
