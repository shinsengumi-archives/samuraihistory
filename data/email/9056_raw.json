I&#39;ve &quot;bought in&quot; to this thread because\nI have seen lots of photos of glorious whole-body tattoos on Japanese men (don&#39;t\nknow about women) where in some cases the person&#39;s skin is willed to be\npreserved.  In fact, I believe there is a museum in Japan where tattooed human\nskins are exhibited.  So, always wanting to expand my knowledge I turned to\ngoogle with only two search keywords - &#39;tattoo&#39; and &#39;samurai&#39; inserted without\nquotes.  I got well over 1 million hits!!!  Go here for a history of tattoo and\nsamurai in Japan:\nhttp://tattoos.com/mieko.htm\nOne passage reads &quot; Iizawa (1973) and Tamabayashi (1956) report that the custom\nof tattooing is also found among samurai warriors in the sixteenth century. In\ncertain areas, the samurai had tattoos for identification.&quot;  I venture to\nsuggest that this is a very extensive article of considerable interest to those\non our list.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 06, 2006 2:46 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai photos\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Michael Peters&quot; &lt;shdwstel@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Lacking the little emoticon image of the guy with raised eyebrows\n&gt; &gt;holding up the WFT? sign, I&#39;ll just come right out and say &quot;WTF?&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;Call me crazy, but not only do I not see a correlation between getting\n&gt; &gt;a tattoo and torturing small animals, but I also have to play the\n&gt; &gt;devil&#39;s advocate and ask why you would assume that &quot;people [he]\n&gt; &gt;respects&quot; would be horrified at a tattoo?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kitsuno,\n&gt;\n&gt;    Cite instances of Samurai (not Yakuza who Claim to be following the\n&gt; samurai tradition) wearing tattoos. Do you claim that during say, the\n&gt; momoyama period, tattoos were socially acceptable by the bushi? The\njapanese\n&gt; perception of tattoos as unclean is a modern only sensibility? The\nanalogy\n&gt; works unless of course he *is* into torturing small animals. My\npoint was\n&gt; simply something perfectly acceptable to someone in one time and\nculture\n&gt; (tattoos, now, in the West) could be taken as bizarre at the least by\n&gt; someone from another time and culture (tattoos in honor of\nsomething, then,\n&gt; Japan).\n\n\n\n"
