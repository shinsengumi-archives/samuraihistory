Enough of this \nalready.  FROM ALL SIDES.  We&#39;ve been on this topic for a week and more now, and \nquite frankly, I&#39;m getting really sick of it.  From the posts I&#39;ve read, we&#39;ve \ngotten exactly nowhere except to the point of bickering and going off-topic \n(widely!).  The question about whether Nobunaga and Hitler or Vlad Tepes \n(Dracula) or Ivan IV (the Terrible) are comparable are good for a couple days or so \nas long as they stay on topic.  But when we get to what&#39;s going around now, it \nis to the point of asking &quot;WHO CARES?!&quot;, a point we passed a long time ago.  \nI&#39;m to the point of deleting the messages simply whenever I see this subject, \nI&#39;m so sick of how this subject is turning out.\n\nPeace out.\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
