He will be playing the part of &#39;Ambrose Pemberthy - \nMaster Mesmerist&#39; \nDistribution Source : PRWeb\n \nDate : Friday, June 24, 2005\n \n \n(PRWEB) June 24, 2005 -- Ian Edwards, Pagan Chaplain for Kingston \nand Ford Prisons, will be taking part in the International Festival \nof the Sea at the end of this month. A qualified and experienced \nhypnotherapist, reflexologist, masseur and counsellor, he will be \nusing these skills in the role of the character of &quot;Ambrose \nPemberthy - Master Mesmerist&quot;.\n\nIan has trained in the martial art of Ninjutsu since 1985 and \nachieved his third degree black belt in the Bujinkan style when he \nlived in Japan from 1989 to 1990. He still trains at the Shinobikai \nclub run by Mark Lutman on Tuesdays at the Shinboku Keep Fit and \nMartial Arts Centre, in St Mary&quot;s road, Portsmouth.\n\n&quot;In the role of Ambrose Pemberthy I can bring together several of my \nskills in a unique manner&quot; Said Ian. &quot;The late Seventeenth and early \nEighteenth centuries were a time of tremendous expansion and trade \nfor the British Empire. My character joined a ship of the East India \nCompany as a surgeons mate because of his family background in the \napothecary trade. Already skilled in Witchcraft from contacts in the \nNew Forest, and Ritual Magic from a family friend, he was exposed to \nIndian and Asian magic and learned Mesmerism from a Dutch Barber-\nSurgeon. \n\nMarooned in Japan when the official line of the Tokugawa Shogunate \nwas &quot;All foreigners to be killed on sight&quot; except for those in two \ntiny trading posts. Ambrose was sheltered by local Ninja because of \nhis unique knowledge of the outside world. He shared his skills with \nthe Ninja and learned their skills of combat, bushcraft, and magic. \nOn returning home he uses his skills for healing others, and to help \nthe intelligence service of the day.&quot;\n\n&quot;During the time I was living and training in Japan I visited many \nof the areas where Ninjutsu was practiced. There are museums devoted \nto the history of the art, and restored special farmhouses - \ncalled &quot;Ninja Dera&quot; - with hidden doors, alarm floors, and concealed \nprotective devices. But just visiting the environment gave me a \ngreat insight into the roots and history of the Martial Art I \npractice.&quot;\n\nIan has been a practitioner of Paganism and magic since 1979 and is \nofficially recognised in his capacity as Pagan Chaplain to Ford and \nKingston Prison by the Home Office.\n\nIan Edwards will be part of the Anchor Lane site in the Dockyard \nthroughout IFOS\n\nContact Details\nIan Edwards: Tel 02392 6455550 Mobile 07966 459540 \ne-mail email protected from spam bots\n\nMark Lutman Tel 01256 850433 Website: http://www.ninjutsu.uk.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n"
