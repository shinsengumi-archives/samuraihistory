I&#39;ve\nbeen \n&#39;offline&#39;.\n\n \n&gt; Does this mean that your character is in the present\n&gt; time? \n\nYes.\n\n&gt; &gt; I cannot use Makoto for the forename.\n\n \n&gt; Why not? Knowing why not might help us suggest an\n&gt; alternative. \n\nI would be liable for libel :-) Need I say more?\n\n \n&gt; As Kitsuno said, the Japanese don&#39;t shorten their\n&gt; names according to &quot;English&quot; principles. If you are\n&gt; having him interact with non-Japanese characters for\n&gt; the most part, then I can see them giving him an\n&gt; &quot;English&quot; nickname, like the example you use above.&#92;\n\nYes, he interacts with non-Japanese speakers for the\nmost part. And I have to say my personal experience is\nthat many Japanese names are shortened according to\nEnglish principles. My experience being with several\nCanadian born Japanese( with Japanese names,\nshortened. Tad was one of them).\n\nAND I don&#39;t want to get into a discussion about this\naspect, it is not the important part.\n\n\n&gt; &quot;Daisuke&quot; and make it &quot;Dice&quot; (kinda cool),\n\nYes, very cool!\n\nWhat I need to know is what Daisuke means! Is it a\nsurname or forename?\n\nHelly Angel said:\n\nI recommended you the surename: Takagi and as the\nname:\n\nJintaro\nJutaro\nJingoro\n\nall &quot;sound&quot; good to me, but again I need to know why\nTakagi - what is the history here?\n\nAnd what the forenames he suggested actually mean. \n\nAnother person reccomended Reiichi as being\n&quot;Trustworthy first son&quot;. Is this correct?\n\nMany thanks for all suggestions and help!\n\nKali\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo! Mail Mobile \nTake Yahoo! Mail with you!
