I also grow impatient with \npeople who wish to declare themselves, or seek, to be, samurai.  However,  it is possible to develop within ourselves the best of \nthe samurai traits. It is far easier to be critical, but a challenge to our character to be educators and compassionate.\n\nLastly, I find myself curious as to Mr. Wilson&#39;s age and educational level,  whether he is dyslexic, and if English is a second or \nthird language.\n\nJust for the h-e-double-hockey-sticks of it..... how many of you &#39;play&#39; in the Society for Creative Anachronism......  if you do, do \nyou pursue &#39;European&#39; or &#39;Asian/Japanese personas? (No, lol, I don&#39;t mean as in &#39;chase&#39; them...)\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Nate Ledbetter\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 2004 3:34 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] new subject\n\n\n\n--- james wilson &lt;johntwo8@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Sabarashi means wonderfull.\n\nJames, hate to tell you this, but no, it doesn&#39;t.\n&quot;Subarashii&quot; means wonderful. And it&#39;s an\nadjective--most named things aren&#39;t given adjectives\nas names.\n\nhe just thought us the\n&gt; importance of karate just like Master Funakoshi. i\n&gt; have a few of his books and he never metions it in\n&gt; the ones i have abt his karate being linked with the\n&gt; samurai.\n\nThat&#39;s because karate, unarmed defense, was developed\nby peasants as self-defense against armed samurai.\nPeasants weren&#39;t allowed to have weapons. Well, that&#39;s\nthe simple version, anyways.\n\nlast but not least i also studied some\n&gt; chinese martial arts and they have very simular\n&gt; princeples. so that lets one know just because the\n&gt; teaching is simular the two r not the same.\n\nMany martial arts and traditions have the same values.\nYou can find that all over the world.\n\nAn\n&gt; Akaido proverb goes like this:\n\nNot to be picky, but its &quot;Aikido&quot;, not &quot;Akaido&quot;.\n\nNate\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nTake Yahoo!
