But leaving this aside (I hope this type of utterance is \npermitted in english), the katana stuff was only inteded as a joke, \nas I was reading a lot of &quot;bollocks&quot; (as Mr. Bryant said once) on \nother forums regarding the Samurai matter.\n\n By the way, are you familiar with the Toledo Swordmasters (the \nspanish Toledo, because there are others)? They have some very nice \nreplicas (is that the word?) of historical swords.\n\n Respectfully,\n\n Gabriel\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Matt Bowes &lt;yeomanforbes@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Gabriel:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Impressive.  Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you&#39;re not \na &quot;ringer&quot; posting from middle Ohio?  You made me look \nup &quot;concatenates.&quot;  I think I heard the word used ONCE back in 1992.  \n&gt; \n&gt; To the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be \nwrong, but my ex-wife&#39;s aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have \nno idea how it is spelled, since I have never ever seen it in print) \ntold me that the great sword makers had stopped making katanas and \nmoved into making kitchen knives, since that&#39;s where the money is.  \nNow, I can see perhaps where it would be extra handy to have a ginsu \nknife for chopping garlic instead of your trusty katana, but maybe \nthat&#39;s just me.  Some of you might enjoy the garlic chopping with a \nlarger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged if you do, \nsince that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there any \ntruth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there, \njust making steak knives for Williams Sonoma?  (Incidentally, the ex \nand myself are on excellent terms, so no need to fear for my safety.  \nThank you for your concern.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Your most obedient,\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; Dodu Gabriel &lt;dodu_gabriel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Newbies are welcome unless they make themselves\n&gt; &gt; unwelcome. As for English not being your native\n&gt; &gt; language--YOU are the one that all these other people\n&gt; &gt; must be learning to hate. Your writing skills were\n&gt; &gt; QUITE good--if it&#39;s not your native language, then\n&gt; &gt; THEY have no excuse. WELCOME!!!! (and so that we know,\n&gt; &gt; what is your native language?) \n&gt; \n&gt; My native language is romanian. I am from Romania, and please don&#39;t \n&gt; start with the Dracula stuff, because I hate Bram Stoker. It did \n&gt; wonders for our Travelling Industry, but it crippled our history...:\n(\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/kanji/nengo.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That only begins in year 1201, but does give the kanji\n&gt; &gt; for each period, and the alternate periods. I&#39;ll see\n&gt; &gt; if I can dig up anything prior to that. As for\n&gt; &gt; changing the period name, it was the Emperor who did\n&gt; &gt; that--not the daimyo, Shogun, or any military person.\n&gt; &gt; Someone else may have &quot;suggested&quot; to the Emperor that\n&gt; &gt; it would be a good time for a name change, but it was\n&gt; &gt; the Emperor who actually did it. Reasons for changing\n&gt; &gt; included a portentous sign, a natural disaster, a\n&gt; &gt; particularly good event, or just because they&#39;d gone\n&gt; &gt; long enough. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for the information, it&#39;s good to know things as they \n&gt; were. About that site, I wish I had a sword, so that I could \nproperly \n&gt; use it by reading what is signed on it...no, no, don&#39;t fear, I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; intend to ask for information about purchasing a katana and about \n&gt; the &quot;Samurai Way of the Sword&quot; & Stuff  :)). I like the site, \n&gt; though...\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, if you get to check out EDICT, maybe you can find out \n&gt; how to search for expressions, because I couldn&#39;t. Even if I \n&gt; select &quot;full regular expression&quot;, it concatenates my words into a \n&gt; single one, which, of course, the server can&#39;t understand. This is \n&gt; the exact link of one of the mirrors:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.df.lth.se/cgi-bin/j-e/dict\n&gt; \n&gt; Other than that, thank you for your time and I hope we get to chat \n&gt; some more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Respectfully,\n&gt; \n&gt; Gabriel\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;  Yahoo!
