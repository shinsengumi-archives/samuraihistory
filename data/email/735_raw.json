I&#39;m from Australia. I have an interest in the\nhistory and origins of the samurai.\n\nIn answer to the question at hand, there are several leaders of the past\nwhich I think were great military leaders, although I debate their ideals\nand philosophies, ie Adolf Hitler. I think Hitler made a crucial error in\njudgment in invading Russia. He should have learned his lesson from Napolean\nwho tried and failed. Had&#39;ve he focused more on other areas and not broken\nthe pact with Stalin, then the war would have turned in another direction.\n\nSecondly, Stalin himself was equally brutal. Yet the allies made their\nchoice in siding with the lesser of two evils when chosing Stalin as an ally\nover Hitler.\n\nThirdly, Winston Churchill made a good strategic move by involving the\nUnited States into the conflict when Britain were obviously facing\nobliteration by the Germans who would no doubt have invaded Britain had&#39;ve\nthe United States become involved. Had&#39;ve they waited until after the\nGermans occupied Britain, they would not have had a strategic place to\nlaunch an attack on Europe for D-Day.\n\nFourth, Attila the Hun. He hasn&#39;t gotten a mention at all so I thought that\nhe should. He had undoubtedly made an impact on the European continent\nbetween 950-953 AD, when the Roman Empire was falling. He would have beaten\nthe Turks to pillaging Constantinople if he didn&#39;t have the appropriate\nsiege weapons to break down the heavily fortified walls. The Turks took care\nof that a few hundred years later. However, the effort on Attila&#39;s part was\nnot wasted. It did allow him to establish his empire and therefore allow his\nefforts to be focused on the west - ie Gaul etc.\n\nFifth, Genghis Khan, who undoubtedly had invaded more land than any other\ninvader to date. No other military leader had achieved such a feat even to\nthis day. Had&#39;ve Genghis not died then it is possible that Europe would have\nhad a different destiny.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to add that there are a great many other leaders\nwho deserve a mention.\n\nBrendan\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tshadowhawke666 [mailto:shadowhawke666@...]\nSent:\tThursday, April 11, 2002 11:29 AM\nTo:\tsamuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject:\t[samuraihistory] If you could be a great Military leader how would\nyou be?\n\n  Hi fellow warriors,\n     As I was going through my mail this evening I saw a few famous military\nleaders either mentioned or referred to. A question occured to me- If you\ncould be a famous Military leader from the past who would you be?\n     I think my answer at this point would be possibly split between Ieyasu\nTokugawa and Erwin Rommel.\n     My first choice, Ieyasu Tokugawa was the first Shogun of Japan;\naccording to my research, he united Japan; I could elaborate but in fairness\nthis could be a seperate e-mail.\n     My second choice, Erwin Rommel, known as the Desert Fox, again\naccording to my research, was one of Hitler&#39;s smartest generals.\n       There you have my answer to the question, what&#39;s your answer?\n        I&#39;d be glad to answer any questions or hear any comments.\n         I closing, I just though it might be interesting or fun to see what\nanswers turned up.\n        Hope to hear from you soon,\n            Shadow\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
