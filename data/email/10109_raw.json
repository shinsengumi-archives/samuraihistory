It i=\r\ns anything that has been handed down which represents the history and the l=\r\nives of one&#39;s ancestors. For my family, this is mostly texts and charts--- =\r\nknowledge itself.=C2=A0Why? Because the tools and devices break and decay w=\r\nith time-- but the knowledge to build them is what is can really survive th=\r\ne ages.=C2=A0 For example, my family still locksmiths based on texts and tr=\r\naditions that have passed down for 400 something years. We have no ancient =\r\nlocks or keys, but the texts are considered sacred/important.=C2=A0 We also=\r\n still shoot bow and arrow, but we don&#39;t have any arrows or bows we hold sa=\r\ncred--- what we hold &quot;sacred&quot; is the ideology of HOW we shoot and particula=\r\nr techinques.=C2=A0=C2=A0 Thus, our &quot;heirloom&quot; is specific knowledge of spe=\r\ncific techinques... not an actual item. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 I suppose each famil=\r\ny has its own &quot;heirlooms&quot;, but we must understand that not all samurai fami=\r\nly&#39;s use a sword as this &quot;heirloom&quot;--- but that as sword CAN be an heirloom=\r\n -- but that it is only special because of the people who have possessed it=\r\n, and not something about the sword itself. \n=C2=A0Some families have sword=\r\ns that were presented to them by a very high person.. and this is important=\r\n. But again, not because of the sword itself, but because of the event it r=\r\nepresents.\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 So.. it depends on the family as to what &quot;thing&quot; is=\r\n passed down and considered sacred and important. \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I guess my p=\r\noint is that I would like for people to understand that bushi is about actu=\r\nal human lives and not physical objects. \n\n\n--- On Tue, 2/9/10, Takezo Gets=\r\nu &lt;getsutakezo@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Takezo Getsu &lt;getsutakezo@...=\r\nm&gt;\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] how did samurai get their last name?\nTo: s=\r\namuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Tuesday, February 9, 2010, 11:50 PM\n\n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nI think that people have lost the true meaning behind the heirlo=\r\nom swords: even with a shinto outlook that the sword itself has a soul, the=\r\n sword is definitely not the focal point of the family.=C2=A0 But at the sa=\r\nme time, it is not right to totally dismiss the sword: it&#39;s importance is t=\r\nhat it is hard to really have direct contact with ones ancestors, so the sw=\r\nord is a physical thing that someone can hold and feel close to their foref=\r\nathers. So, it is rather a symbol that promotes ones ancestors rather than =\r\nreplace them.\n\n--- On Tue, 2/9/10, Steven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@ yaho=\r\no.com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Steven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@ yahoo.com&gt;\nSubject=\r\n: RE: [samuraihistory] how did samurai get their last name?\nTo: samuraihist=\r\nory@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Tuesday, February 9, 2010, 3:46 PM\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nYe=\r\ns, this topic of the sword is interesting. .
