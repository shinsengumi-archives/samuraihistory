I think that the hanwei blades are about as good \nas you are going=\r\n to get for a katana that is made outside of japan. \nEspecially for the pri=\r\nce. I have to say I really like my tiger set. But \nnow of course by no mean=\r\ns am I an expert. But I practice iaido and have \nseen different swords thro=\r\nugh the various students of the class. I myself \nhave a custom made iaito f=\r\nrom japan... for a non live blade it is really a \ngorgeous sword. Again can=\r\n&#39;t state enough that they are very sharp! (the \nhanwei blades). I have both=\r\n the practical plus and tiger sets... (katana&#39;s \nand wakizahi). Both are ve=\r\nry, very sharp. There is a noticable difference \nin quality though from the=\r\n practical plus to the tiger. You can definitely \ntell the practical plus i=\r\ns made for cutting practice!\nWell I hope that helps. Very good deal though =\r\non the sets!\n\nRobert Burns\n\n\n&gt;From: peter martinez \n\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihist=\r\nory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [samu=\r\nraihistory] hanwei\n&gt;Date: Thu, 29 Sep 2005 11:20:44 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve bee=\r\nn thinking about getting a Hanwei Katana and Wakizashi so can you \n&gt;recomme=\r\nnd a seller?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;federico trejos wrote:\n&gt;Good afternoon to all.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;I practice Iaido with a Hanwei Practical Katana.\n&gt;The story is this : It w=\r\nas from a guy who used to\n&gt;practice Iaido in the same Dojo I do. He was pla=\r\nying\n&gt;with the Katana ( that is the best description of what\n&gt;he was doing =\r\n) and he damaged the edge. So he put\n&gt;the sword on sell and I bought it. It=\r\n is around 3\n&gt;and a half pounds heavier than a normal Iaito, but it\n&gt;is ok =\r\n( my arms are getting stronger, imagine what I\n&gt;can do with a Iaito !!! ).\n=\r\n&gt;Before I kill the sharpenes from the edge, I can tell\n&gt;you that when I pas=\r\ns a sheet of paper on the mono-\n&gt;uchi of the blade, when I was close to the=\r\n final of\n&gt;the mono- uchi I have to stop before cutting my\n&gt;fingers.\n&gt;In a =\r\nscale from 1 to 10 on sharpenes for comercial\n&gt;swords, I give Hanwei swords=\r\n a 9.\n&gt;If you have one, my advice is : do not play with it.\n&gt;It is a weapon=\r\n (or mean to replay a weapon ) and is\n&gt;primary objective is to kill people.=\r\n\n&gt;Japanese swords are beauty to see, to handle and to\n&gt;cut with it; but alw=\r\nays keep in mind that it is a\n&gt;weapon. Be respectful with it, because it wi=\r\nll remind\n&gt;you.\n&gt;About the ability of the swordsman, I can tell you\n&gt;this o=\r\nld japanese saying : &quot;An excellent Katana will\n&gt;cry in the hands of a bad s=\r\namurai&quot;...\n&gt;So if you are training, train hard. And if you are\n&gt;training ha=\r\nrd, train harder. There is always\n&gt;something new to learn.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards =\r\nto all.\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Correo Yahoo=\r\n!\n&gt;Espacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam =A1gratis!\n&gt;Reg=ED=\r\nstrate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives=\r\n: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafes=\r\nhops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;YAH=\r\nOO!
