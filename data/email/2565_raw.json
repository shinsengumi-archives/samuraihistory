I am glad that we are on the same page now.  My appologies \nfor any miscommunication.\n\n\nMr. Richardson,\n\n  It is possible to draw the blade in a battou type action and not cut.  \nDefensive battou techniques, such as intetcepting cuts or angled parrys, \ncome into play quite often in Iaido.  As a general rule of thumb, according \nto my Iaido sensei, if you are doing a single hand technique, especially one \nfrom a draw, it is Iai.  Once the second hand touches the tsuka (handle) is \nbecomes kenjutsu.  Which separates schools like Kukishin Ryu from schools \nlike Muso Shinden Ryu.\n  For offensive battou techniques that do not involve a downward cut the \nturning of the saya (sheath) is not done until the very last possible \nmoment.  Partly to keep the side of the blade from being scratched up from \nany dirt inside the saya (sheath) and also to keep the ha (cutting edge) \nfrom splitting the saya.\n  I hope that this came off more as a response and not as an arguement.\n\n\nMatt Williams\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nNeed a shot of Hank Williams or Patsy Cline?
