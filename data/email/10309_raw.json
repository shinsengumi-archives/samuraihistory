Contrary to popular belief, and often overlooked by hist=\r\norians, guns did in fact make their way into Japan as early as the 1450&#39;s, =\r\nmainly through Ryukyu or to mainland Japan via China and Korea. Although th=\r\ney remained more of an oddity or curio until they were mass produced beginn=\r\ning in the 1540&#39;s, there are accounts of them in Japan long before the intr=\r\noduction by Western traders, which we present to you in this episode. And, =\r\nfor anyone who has ever wondered what the difference is between a musket, m=\r\natchlock, and arquebus, we&#39;ll give you a concise explanation of the types o=\r\nf firearms in question.\n\nMentioned in this podcast:\n\nWeapons & Fighting Tec=\r\nhniques of the Samurai Warrior 1200-1877 AD \nBy Thomas, D Conlan, Amber Boo=\r\nks Ltd, 2008 http://bit.ly/iTAroK\n\nUezato, Takashi, Ry=FBky=FB no kaki ni t=\r\nsuite (On Ryukyu&#39;s Firearms) \nOkinawa Bunka, No. 36, pp73-92, July 2000\n\nOd=\r\na Nobunaga Rekishi Gunzo Series #1 \nGAKKEN, 1996\n\nEtheridge, Charles, Reinv=\r\nenting the Sword: A Cultural Comparison of the Development of the Sword in =\r\nResponse to the Advent of Firearms in Spain and Japan.
