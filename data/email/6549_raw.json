Did the\nMatsudaira (they weren&#39;t the Tokugawa yet) do what\nImagawa Yoshimoto told them to do? Yes. Ieyasu was a\nhostage at Sumpu, and unless they wanted him back in\npieces they didn&#39;t have a choice. Did they do it out\nof loyalty to the Imagawa? Most decidely not. They\ncaptivity of their young lord was a sore point for\nmany Mikawa bushi, from what I&#39;ve read. Loyalty, to\nme, implies a desire to serve. I doubt many Matsudaira\nfelt any desire to serve the Imagawa.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
