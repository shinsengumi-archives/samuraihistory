I wonder how Osaka Castle laid out,\nbefore the sieges in 1614 and in 1615.\n\n--- William letham &lt;mickey.letham@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well that would take some volumes to describe in\n&gt; detail the two sieges of\n&gt; Osaka jo. Basically the winter campaign ended in a\n&gt; stalemate. During the\n&gt; truce Ieyasu managed to have the Toyotomi side fill\n&gt; in the moats this\n&gt; allowed him more access during the summer campaign.\n&gt; The Toyotomi side\n&gt; realizing this lead its troops in a massive land\n&gt; battle outside the castle\n&gt; but were defeated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps the most detailed account in English would\n&gt; be in James Murdochs\n&gt; second volume of his history of Japan.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
