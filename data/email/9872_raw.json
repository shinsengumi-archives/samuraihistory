Shingen was lacking in salt always due to the reason of the circumstance arround him.   Kenshin tried to help even his long time enemy.\n  It was attributed by his thought that he believed Justice was very important   To help enemy when enemy has problem is Kenshin&#39;s motto.  Kensin was a man of man in that sense.\n   \n    Eddie \n\nSteppenWolf_260954 &lt;bob@...&gt; wrote:\n          --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, kojalMtirta@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everybody..\n&gt; I once read that kenshin died because of serious illness. But \nlately i read a ninja history book,and in that book they write that a \nninja assasinate kenshin while he&#39;s in the loo. Can anybody tell me \nthe true story behind kenshin&#39;s death.\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------\n&gt; Sent by emoze push mail\n&gt;\n\nThe ninja assassin story is indeed very popular. The ninja was said \nto have hid in the lavatory, more like a latrine for three days \nwaiting for his target to come to that particular one, when the \ntarget did indeed arrive he was stabbed from below [yes the ninja was \nstood in the actual sewer stream] and killed.\n\nThis story blossomed from the rumours that the Oda had him \nassassinated. This was mainly due to the timely death which benefited \nthe Oda enormously.\n\nHowever, many Japanese scholars believe he contracted a severe \nillness, stomach cancer is mentioned, and thereby died.\n\nThe legend of the assassination is a little more colourful but a lot \nless likely - but who knows\n\n\n\n  \n                          \n \n\n \n---------------------------------\nPower up the Internet with Yahoo!
