What Brand had to say\nwasn&#39;t at all stupid and it is very possible that he&#39;s\ncorrect. As far as my name goes, there is nothing odd\nabout it and it is very much a Japanese name that was\ngiven to me by my great-grandmother who happened to be\nJapanese, which goes to show that you&#39;re not as much\nan authority as you seem to give yourself credit for\nbeing. \n    As for everyone else who has responded, thank you\nso much for your help. It is greatly appreciated and\nif you have any other suggestions, please don&#39;t\nhesitate to let me know what they are.\n                                   Taneiko\n--- &quot;Anthony J.
