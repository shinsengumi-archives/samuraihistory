In actual Miyamoto Musashi was also named after the \nprovince so the ships I guess followed his pattern and also the thousend \nother &#39;Musashi&#39; named Japanese out there in the past.\n It was common to use the name of the province or village where you were born \nor raised as your name..But in Miyamoto Musashi his name is the province and \nMiyamoto the surname. Takezo is anouther way to pronounce the Kanji used in \nhis name and may well have been a name that he used as well as &#39;Musashi&#39;\n The ship &#39;Musashi&#39; was one of a series of great Japanese ships that were \nbuilt and named after Japanese &#39;Kuni&#39; or provinces..the &#39;Yamato&#39; was another \none. I think the names were intended to bring up feelings of the greatness of \nthe Japanese navy at the time,,Similar to calling a ship the &quot;U.S.S. George \nWashington&quot;..It was intended as inspiration.\n Hope this helps.\n Ben Sharples.\n\n"
