He installed Ashikaga Yoshiaki, brother of the murdered Shogun Ash=\r\nikaga Yoshiteru, in 1568, only to depose him in the early 1570s. Therefore =\r\nbetween then and the victory of Tokugawa Ieyasu there were no Shogun. He wa=\r\ns the leading commander in the country, and controller of the Kinai, who ye=\r\nar after year was presented with titles from the court, finally reaching da=\r\nijo daijin in 1578. Yes he never became Shogun, but equally should Ieyasu h=\r\nave become Shogun? (to follow your line of argument). Both were extremely a=\r\nmbitious, often treacherous, characters from equally obscure regional famil=\r\nies, and both raised great opposition in and around the Court during their =\r\nascendancies. Why, therefore would Nobunaga &quot;probably never&quot; have been Shog=\r\nun, when Ieyasu established a disciplined, effective Bakufu?\nM.Lorimer\n\nKyl=\r\ne Segall &lt;klancesegall@...&gt; wrote:\nWhile its a minor quibble, you sho=\r\nuld know there&#39;s no &quot;agreeing&quot; \nor &quot;disagreeing&quot; about Nobunaga being a Sho=\r\ngun. He wasn&#39;t. Only the \nTokugawa and the Ashikaga families had Shoguns du=\r\nring the Sengoku \nJidai, and, even had Nobunaga indeed conquered all of Jap=\r\nan, he \nprobably never would have been one either (probably a kempaku like =\r\n\nHideyoshi).\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Me=F0al Mikit St=F3r-=\r\nljon \nOddhinsson &lt;medhal8@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I tend to agree that Nobunaga was =\r\nnot a Shogun.
