The Ii took the\nidea, I believe, from the troops of Yamagata\nMasakage--I could be wrong on the name. The Ii then\nmade the wearing of uniform armor their thing. \n\n&gt; When did this sort of thing start? Does anyone\n&gt; really know?\n\nEssentially, when the Yamagata and Ii started doing\nit. Prior to that, it was mainly only a concern to\nequip your men with whatever you could--buying\nmatching sets of armor gets expensive. Earlier in the\n16th cent daimyo would mark the armor they issued to\ntheir ashigaru with their mon; that was probably the\nbeginning.\n\n&gt; Is it conceivable that a Shimazu daimyo of the 14thC\n&gt; might have\n&gt; equipped his men with black armour, if similar\n&gt; things were occurring\n&gt; in the 16thC?\n\nConceivable? I suppose. Not likely--at that point,\nit&#39;d be enough just to make sure they all had armor of\nsome sort. Usually the retainer himself was\nresponsible for his own armor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
