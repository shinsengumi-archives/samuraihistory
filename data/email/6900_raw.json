It seems\nthat as sori was first introduced in the nakago area(where there is no clay)\nthis must have been intentional. Of course I agree with you that a skilled\nswordsmith has control over all aspects of sword making being able to\ncontrol and dictate the kind of sori at will (saki-soroi, koshisori etc.)\nAs to Rod&#39;s original question, only very early swords were straight (Nara\nperiod and earlier) and mostly these were not thought to be of Japanese\nmanufacture but imported from the Asian mainland along with the technology.\nThe true Japanese sword as we would recognise it today, was perfected in the\nHeian period and is still made today, well after Meiji. Also both tachi and\nkatana are made basically the same way, although the shape of tachi tend to\nbe more slender and graceful than most katana (gross generalisation and\noversimplification!)\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\nwww.to-ken.com\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;tom helm&quot; &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, April 03, 2005 4:45 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] SWORD\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Rod et al-\n&gt; A skilled smith ultimately has control over all aspects of\n&gt; the finished product. Keeping that in mind the combination of hard\n&gt; edge steel and a softer spine along with differential heating\n&gt; produces curvature in the Japanese sword. Actually it is the cooling\n&gt; that does it, when the sword is heated in the fire the clay keeps the\n&gt; back of the sword relatively cool so it doesn&#39;t expand as much as the\n&gt; unprotected edge steel. The edge steel expands, the back does not and\n&gt; this produces curve, the sword is then &quot;flash frozen&quot; in this state\n&gt; by dropping it in water. The smith gives his sword more or less curve\n&gt; (before yakiire) depending on the shape he wants (more or less sori)\n&gt; in the finished piece. He can adjust the curve in other ways after\n&gt; yakiire as well.\n&gt; The combination of different steels and use of clay as\n&gt; insulation may have been an experiment at some point that\n&gt; unexpectedly produced curve  in a straight blade, so at that early\n&gt; stage at least could be said to have been a happy accident...\n&gt; -t\n&gt; www.ncjsc.org\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest:\n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
