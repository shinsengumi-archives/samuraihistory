The rebels inflicted a \nseries\nof ignominious defeats on the besieging samurai armies and so alarmed \nthe Shogunate that\nhelp was requested from the Dutch, who obliged by attacking the rebels \nfrom the sea\nwith naval cannon.\n\nMatsudaira Nobutsuna, the commander sent by the Shogunate to end\nthe uprising, opted for a lengthy siege, only concluding with a final \nassault when\nthe rebels supplies had been exhausted and starvation had set in.\n\nThere is a good description of the Shimabara rebellion in Ivan Morris&#39; book\n&quot;The Nobility of Failure&quot; in the chapter entitled, &quot;Amakusa Shiro - \nJapanese Messiah.&quot;\n\ngabriel d gabaya wrote:\n\n&gt; Does anybody here have indepth knowledge about the Shimabara rebellion \n&gt; of 1637-38?  All I know is that Japanese Christians got fed up w/ the \n&gt; local tax collectors.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gabs\n&gt;\n&gt; _______________________________________\n&gt; EDSAMAIL.
