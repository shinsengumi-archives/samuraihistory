It \n&gt; took me a while to d=\r\nig some of this up so apologies to the list for \n&gt; the gap=C5c\n\n\n\nThere&#39;s a=\r\nlso the book &quot;Samurai Sketches&quot;, by Romulus Hillsborough \n(sp?), which deal=\r\ns with many stories involving the swordsmen of the \nBakumatsu era.\n \n\n \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nKomori Genjiro, he changed his name into Kawakami \n&gt; Gensai(Hitokiri-Gensai=\r\n). He changed his name further into Takada \n&gt; Genbe...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I know three &quot;=\r\nHitokiri&quot;;=DD Hitokiri Hanzo (Nakamura Hanjiro)=DD , \n&gt; Hitokiri Izo, and a=\r\nnother Hitokiri Hanzo. \n\n\nThe ones I know, excluding Gensai, are: Hitokiri =\r\nHanjiro (Jigen \nstyle), Hitokiri Izo (Kyoshin Meichi style) and Hitokiri Sh=\r\ninbe \n(Tanaka Shinbe, forgot what his style was). Hitokiri Shinbe was the \n=\r\none who supposedly killed Anenokoji Kintomo, if I&#39;m not mistaken.\n\n\n&gt; =DD\n&gt;=\r\n =DDAnd, purportedly kendo lost its flare and popularity immediately \n&gt; aft=\r\ner the Meiji Restoration; how true is that?\n&gt; \n&gt; The short answer is it=C5f=\r\ns true. With the triumph of western tactics \n&gt; and weapons over the Bakufu,=\r\n the banning of swords as symbol of \n&gt; rank,and the suppression of the Sats=\r\numa Rebellion. \n\n\nAs far as I know, the suppression of the Satsuma Rebellio=\r\nn wasn&#39;t one \nof the factors that caused the decadence of kendo/kenjutsu. M=\r\nuch on \nthe contrary, from the sources I&#39;ve seen, it helped the Japanese \nf=\r\nencing to stay alive in the army/police, though I am unsure of how \nhelpful=\r\n it was. The &quot;Bunmei Kaika&quot; and the &quot;Haitorei&quot; were, for me, \nthe most impo=\r\nrtant factors.\n\n\n&gt; \tFukuzawa Yukichi who had once been the great reformer, =\r\nnow \n&gt; took the advice of European friends and advocated the preservation \n=\r\nof \n&gt; traditional dress and custom. Much of the damage had already been \n&gt; =\r\ndone though. Japan seems to have gone thru this phase of accepting \n&gt; and t=\r\nhen rejecting western influence several times after the \n&gt; Restoration. Kan=\r\no Jigoro and others were part of the Japanese \neffort \n&gt; to preserve and sp=\r\nread the best of traditional Japanese culture. \n\n\nThis is true enough. Only=\r\n after the Sino-Japanese and Russian-\nJapanese wars that the Japanese &quot;redi=\r\nscovered&quot; the Japanese martial \narts, especially fencing. Until then, some =\r\npeople tried to keep kendo \nalive. The &quot;Gekiken Kogyo&quot;, organized by the Ji=\r\nki Shinkage-ryu \nheadmaster, Sakakibara Kenkichi, is the most representativ=\r\ne movement \nto make Japanese fencing more well known among the Japanese \nth=\r\nemselves. Not to mention the reappearance of &quot;kenbu&quot; (sword \ndancing), help=\r\ned by people like Hibino Raifu (Shinto-ryu). \n\nBut the Japanese fencing cau=\r\nght the public&#39;s eye in the beginning of \nthe 20th century, thanks to the &quot;=\r\nTenranjiai&quot;, the &quot;tournament&quot; held \nin the Imperial Palace (actually, in a =\r\ndojo next to the palace \nitself).\n\n\n&gt; Thus \n&gt; we saw the birth of =C5gModer=\r\nn=C5h kendo after many of the teachers of \n&gt; the late Edo period had ceased=\r\n to be.\n\n\nThough modern kendo as we know now was only created in the late \n=\r\n50s/60s, if I&#39;m not mistaken, due to WWII. The pre-WWII kendo is \nsimilar, =\r\nbut a bit different, since it allowed things \nlike &quot;deashibarai&quot; and &quot;kumiu=\r\nchi&quot;. But, by then, many of the teachers \nof the late Edo period had ceased=\r\n to be indeed. And many styles were \nlost as well, including famous styles =\r\nlike Kyoshin Meichi and \nMizoguchi-ha Itto. \n\n\nSerizawa Kamo\n\n\n"
