They used some\ninteresting tools but for the most part their entire\nlegend is movie myth.\n\nSteven turnbull wrote a hard to get book called the\nninja that sets out all the myth and seperates it from\nthe truth.\n\nThe ninja were called shinobi among other things and\nit is believed that this idea came from sun tzu among\nother old chinese sources.  Usually the &quot;ninja&quot; were\nguys that would sneak in to a castle and set fire or\ncause confusion in an enemy camp.\n\nThere is more but you can get the bokk by ordering\nfrom amazon.uk\n\nMusashi\n--- Eamon Murray &lt;eamonbm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hey listka,\n&gt;                Does anyone here know the origin of\n&gt; the ninja straight sword?\n&gt; And would they share this information? Did the ninja\n&gt; actually train with or\n&gt; use the straight sword?\n&gt; \n&gt; E.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
