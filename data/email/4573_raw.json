This is just one of the things that makes researching Japanese\n&gt;history sometimes difficult. Original source material, unless you can read\n&gt;Japanese. Even then it depends on when it was written. For example, I have\n&gt;managed to get my hands on a set of the Official Japanese Naval General\n&gt;Staff Report written after the Russo-Japanese War! What a score.\n\nWhat a score indeed! I&#39;d love to see even just a page or two of \nthat. Any chance of getting even just a fraction of it scanned?\n\n&gt;Problem is, it is written in Meji era Japanese and even my Japanese friends\n&gt;and associates have a very hard time translating it. But! And this is a big\n\nThis is a fascinating thing about Japanese. Some languages can be \nread for hundreds of years.The often cited example being Italian. \nApparently Dante&#39;s Inferno is almost no problem at all to read for \nmodern Italian speakers (of which I am not one). On the other hand \nJapanese has changed very significantly over the same period of \ntime.\n\nI&#39;m not sure that Meiji Japanese should be _that_ big of a deal - \nbut maybe it&#39;s the combination of the fact that it is Military \nlanguage and the fact that it was written 100 years ago that makes \nit difficult.\n\n&gt;I will list the books that I have managed to collect covering the samurai\n&gt;and Japanese early history in another email.\n\nPlease don&#39;t go to that trouble unless you were planning to do so \notherwise. But of course I&#39;d love to share notes.\n\nWhen you say &quot;early history&quot; - how early do you mean? My own personal \nrealm of interest is currently roughly the 16th century, though I am \nbeing pulled ever further backwards. I&#39;ve recently started to get \ninterested in the Ritsuryo system which had its start in the 7th \ncentury.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
