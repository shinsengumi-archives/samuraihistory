Here is an excerpt:\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------\n&gt; -JAMES starts to turn away.  HIROSHI finally speaks.\n&gt; \n&gt; HIROSHI\n&gt; On the day of battle, a champion is chosen.  He\n&gt; rides ahead of his \n&gt; army, meets the challenger of the enemy.  The victor\n&gt; brings great \n&gt; acclaim to himself, to his clan.  A dozen times I\n&gt; rode out as \n&gt; champion, a dozen men I killed.  In only one contest\n&gt; did I know \n&gt; fear.  Our combat seemed to last an eternity, by the\n&gt; grace of some \n&gt; god I prevailed...  I had never been more proud to\n&gt; be samurai, to \n&gt; take an enemy&#39;s head.  I raised it high on my\n&gt; pike... Learned later \n&gt; the warrior&#39;s son, a six-year old boy, had watched\n&gt; it all from the \n&gt; castle walls.  That boy was Daigo Masakado.\n&gt; ----------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; That looks to me like something that would have been\n&gt; pretty much \n&gt; outdated even in the 15th century, let alone the\n&gt; 19th, and there is \n&gt; of course the obligatory trip to the geisha house. \n&gt; There are lots \n&gt; of things like that - some things that make it\n&gt; little better than \n&gt; the meiji-era samurai classic &quot;the barbarian and the\n&gt; geisha&quot;.  \n&gt; although, like I said, assuming this is truly an\n&gt; early version of \n&gt; the script, I HOPE they would have worked out the\n&gt; most obvious \n&gt; problems.  The first scene of the movie, if they\n&gt; keep it as I have \n&gt; here, should be real good, though.  The battle\n&gt; scenes have potential \n&gt; to say the least.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate\n&gt; Ledbetter \n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s one thing when something &quot;wrong&quot; is done for\n&gt; &gt; cinematic effect. We all know that the Nagashino\n&gt; scene\n&gt; &gt; in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; isn&#39;t the way it really\n&gt; happened--the\n&gt; &gt; Takeda cavalry didn&#39;t die in a 9 minute span from\n&gt; &gt; rapid-fire Oda arqubusiers mowing them down like\n&gt; WWI\n&gt; &gt; German machine gunners against a British &quot;Over the\n&gt; &gt; Top&quot; Charge. But it fits the cinematic effect\n&gt; desired,\n&gt; &gt; so none of us complain about it. (And that&#39;s\n&gt; ignoring\n&gt; &gt; the red sky and all that, too)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m anticipating that this will not be the\n&gt; case--not\n&gt; &gt; with Tom Cruise in it. They&#39;ll mess something up.\n&gt; &gt; Maybe it&#39;s just my natural bias against this time\n&gt; &gt; period, and the fact that I&#39;m sure that there will\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; a gaudy amount of talk about Bushido and honor and\n&gt; &gt; stereotypical crap, and that some of the language\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; be wrong, and the costumes, and other things that\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t hard to get right will be wrong...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, I will go and see it, and might be surprised.\n&gt; And\n&gt; &gt; I might like it, despite whatever is wrong. I&#39;m\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; not getting my hopes up. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
