I think it would also be funny if they used roughly the same  \n&gt;exact weapons as the samurai, give or take 1 or 2. I would also laugh \n&gt;too if they didn&#39;t wear black but dressed like the enemy to blend in,  \n&gt;and not be found out by a guard saying &quot;Who is that in the black \n&gt;pajamas with a sword, coming towards us?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Guard 2: &quot;I don&#39;t know, we could just kill him then ask.&quot; \n&gt;\n&gt;That would be an awesome joke.\n&gt;\n&gt;Maikeru\n\nlol actually I think would be more like...\n\nGuard 1: &quot;Who is that in the black pajamas with a sword, coming towards us?&quot;\nGuard 2: &quot;what is a pajamas?&quot; \n\nI don&#39;t think at those times they even knew what is a pajama (not making a\npun on spelling I don&#39;t know how&#39;s spelled myself) personally I don&#39;t\nreally belive ninjas even existed at all. but still it&#39;s silly consider\nsilly the way they are depicted to dress... to us with our culture sounds\nsilly.. at the time and wif a different culture might look scary who knows\n:D in japanese and chinese mythology there are alot of funny looking\ncreatures, yet japanese never considered them funny at all...\n\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.\nVersion: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 266.11.14 - Release Date: 20/05/2005\n\n\n\n\n"
