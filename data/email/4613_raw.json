Is there \n&gt; such one? Who?\n\nThink about what you&#39;re asking here--it&#39;s like asking\n&quot;Who was the most famous soldier in US History?&quot;\n\nGeorge Washington, since he was the commander, and\nlater was first President? Robert E. Lee? Grant or\nEisenhower, who ended their respective wars and went\non to be Presidents? Audie Murphy, because he was the\nmost decorated? Benedict Arnold, for being a great\ngeneral, and then betraying the US? Patton, because\nthere was a movie about him, and he was the most\nkick-ass? MacArthur? Westmoreland, for losing?\n\nThere are any number of ways to answer your question,\ndepending on what you are looking for. Do you want to\nknow about samurai who were particularly good\nduelists? Try Miyamoto Musashi, Tsukuhara Bokuden, or\nKamiizumi Nobutsuna. Great Samurai Generals? Try Oda\nNobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu,\nMinamoto Yoshitsune, Minamoto Yoshinaka, Takeda\nShingen, Uesugi Kenshin, Date Masamune, Mori Motonari,\nAshikaga Takauji, Nitta Yoshisada, Kusunoki Masashige,\nTaira Kiyomori....and on, and on...and on....\n\nSamurai who were famous for loyalty? Yamanaka\nShikanosuke, the 47 Ronin (look under &quot;Chushingura&quot;),\nHashiba/Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Benkei, Shimizu Muneharu,\nThe Tsuchiya family, etc., etc....\n\nSamurai who were famous for being inept or for not\nbeing loyal, etc: Akechi Mitsuhide, any of the\nAshikaga after Yoshinori, The Akamatsu, Matsunaga\nHisahide and Miyoshi Nagayoshi, Anayama Baisetsu...\n\nSamurai who were most often the subject of\nmovies/plays/TV shows/Manga/anime? Wow...way too many\nto list.\n\nRefine your question and you&#39;ll get plenty of\nopinions, probably all conflicting, but at least it\nwill give you an idea of where to look. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
