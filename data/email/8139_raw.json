Who\ndid a variety of things, who played a variety of roles in history. What does\nanyone mean by &quot;the greatest?&quot; Specifically, in dealing with Japanese\nsamurai, you are dealing with hundreds of years of history. How can any\nsamurai be &quot;the greatest&quot; (whatever that means)? \n\nThere is a lot more meaning in studying the lives of Miyamoto Musashi, Oishi\nKuranosuke, Minamoto no Yoritomo (or his brother Yoshitsune), or Tokugawa\nIeyasu as individuals. Without labeling any of them as &quot;the greatest samurai\never.&quot; \n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of james wilson\nSent: Wednesday, December 21, 2005 6:17 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Mushashi\n\nI was thinking about what Nate had said and it came to me take Mike Jordan\nfor instance, many stories about hime many books and if basketball was to\nend as we know it in a century or so wouldnt he go down in history as the\ngreatest ever.
