So I quoted just that one part of your post below.\n\nBack in the earlier thread, we were discussing the qualities of a &quot;good&quot;\nsamurai. Some people, including myself, brought up two films, AFTER THE RAIN\nand SEPPUKU. I remember discussing one of the characters in SEPPUKU who had\npawned his sword blades in order to try and feed his family. According to\nsome historical accounts I&#39;ve read, this seemed to have happened rather\nfrequently during the Edo period, with impoverished ronin and sometimes\nlow-ranked (low-paid) clan samurai pawning their sword blades, replacing\nthem with bamboo.  \n\nSo with the statement cited below: can it be inferred that a samurai&#39;s sword\n-- and keeping it -- would be more important to a samurai&#39;s honor than\nfeeding his family? That it was considered better if the samurai&#39;s family\nwere to starve to death rather than for the samurai to ever part with his\nsword? And thus a samurai who sells his sword blades, even to keep his\nfamily alive, is acting dishonorably?\n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of raffy yanuario\nSent: Thursday, October 13, 2005 12:35 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: hitokiri kawakami gensai?\n\n[snips.
