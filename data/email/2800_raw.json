There are plenty of \n&gt;birth/death/marriage certificates back to about the 1840&#39;s or so, as well as \n&gt;genealogical books that still hold records from even further back.\n&gt;\nFor your family, it&#39;s probably better behaved ;) I have Mormons in my \nfamily and I know what&#39;s out there.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Pamela Grayer&quot; &lt;m.grayer@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Samura battle tactics\n&gt;\n&gt;Nate\n&gt;Can you expand on your statement that Sengoku period armies were using\n&gt;firearms &#39;to greater effect than Europeans, and on a much more massive\n&gt;scale&#39;?\n&gt;What are your sources?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe battle of Lepanto involved over 200,000 people in a naval action! \nThis is the equivalent of any major Japanese battle in period. The ratio \nof guns in most of the European armies were probably fairly close to \nJapan, in recent discussions on another list, figures were around 20-30% \nfor Europe with Japan peaking around 30%. The much more massive scale I \nthink is not a justified claim. The period I&#39;m thinking of is post-1550s \nto the final Sengoku battles.\n\n&gt;I agree that Japanese armies of this period were generally more tactically\n&gt;sophisticated than their European counterparts throughout this period\n&gt;\nThat&#39;s something that&#39;s hard to measure though. I think Japan has a kick \nass army in this period, but by how much is impossible to determine \nbecause we can&#39;t steal thier armies and make them fight it out as a test.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n"
