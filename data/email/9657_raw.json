It \ndepends on in wh=\r\nat way you consider them superior, and when compared \nto who? Many of us ar=\r\ne familiar with the whole samurai v. knight \ndebate. I would like to make a=\r\n suggestion though. I suggest that you \nlook at samurai from within the pro=\r\nper historical and cultural \ncontext rather than trying to compare them to =\r\nothers. There is \nalways someone that will top who ever you think is the be=\r\nst in some \nform. Plus, a lot of what lead to the idea of the samurai being=\r\n so \nmuch greater than say their western couterparts was very very \nheavily=\r\n influenced by 19th century romaticism. Just for an example. \nA lot of peop=\r\nle talk about how dedicated and loyal samurai were. \nThat they would rather=\r\n die then give off even the slightest \nimpression of slacking in their duti=\r\nes or rebellion. Once again this \nwas influence by 19th romanticizing of th=\r\ne samurai. For much of \ntheir history most samurai were oppurtunists. They =\r\nfought for their \nlord as long as it was in their best interests to do so, =\r\nor out of \nfear of what would happen if they did not. During the Sengoku pe=\r\nriod \nthere was not the horrible stigma if a samurai changed sides that \nwo=\r\nuld later be applied during peace time. It was not uncommon for \nwarriors w=\r\nho were defeated in battle to be offered employment by the \nvictor. This is=\r\n not something horrible for the time. It is simply \nthe way most,if not all=\r\n, known feudal societies.which were \ninherantly fractured, functioned. \n\n\n"
