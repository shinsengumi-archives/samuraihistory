A few may go, G=\r\nod help them, \n&gt;because they liked Tom Cruise&#39;s tired exercise in emotional=\r\n \n&gt;manipulation, The Last Samurai. These people do not know what they&#39;re \n&gt;=\r\nin for.\n&gt;\n&gt;They&#39;ll get their swooshing swords and their copious blood. But =\r\n\n&gt;they&#39;ll be scratching their heads at Zatoichi&#39;s sudden bursts of \n&gt;slapst=\r\nick humor, or when the entire cast partakes in a thunderous tap \n&gt;dance.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;Could be that only those folks going to see a film by the awesome \n&gt;Japane=\r\nse talent &quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi Kitano will be content with this new \n&gt;version of =\r\nthe famous Japanese hero. Kitano audaciously takes on the \n&gt;celluloid perso=\r\nna of the blind, justice-seeking swordsman created in \n&gt;the 1960s and playe=\r\nd for decades by Shintaro Katsu.\n&gt;\n&gt;Zatoichi&#39;s story is taken from the very=\r\n first Katsu film in the \n&gt;1960s, about warring factions in a small town. T=\r\nhe blind swordsman \n&gt;(played by Kitano) comes to town as a humble masseur a=\r\nnd gambler, \n&gt;biding his time with the dice-playing nephew of the woman who=\r\n takes \n&gt;him in. Soon, he&#39;s in the middle of a gang war.\n&gt;\n&gt;In Kitano&#39;s sam=\r\nurai universe we&#39;re given wonderfully flawed and \n&gt;dimensional characters. =\r\nThe film is populated with bums and \n&gt;prostitutes, guys who hurt themselves=\r\n because they don&#39;t know how to \n&gt;hold a sword, put-upon working-class folk=\r\ns, and an idiot or two.\n&gt;\n&gt;Kitano has the odd ability to appeal to both the=\r\n art-film lover and \n&gt;the action-film fan (though not all of his films are =\r\ngangster \n&gt;flicks). He allows bullets to fly and blood to spurt in the mids=\r\nt of \n&gt;silly humor, solid storytelling and stunningly beautiful visuals. \n&gt;=\r\nLike blind Zatoichi&#39;s sword sheathed in a rickety old cane, Kitano \n&gt;shows =\r\nus the extraordinary hidden within the ordinary. His Zatoichi \n&gt;is no ordin=\r\nary samurai story. \n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/custom/showtime=\r\n/sfl-\n&gt;shzatoiaug20,0,251117.story?coll=3Dsfla-features-showtime\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives st=\r\nore: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;--- \n&gt;Yahoo!
