Of the officers and nco&#39;s,\n(the people who actually took swords into battle in WW2) many of them had\ntraining in iado, kendo and kenjutsu. They complained that the kyugunto, a\nwestern style saber used during the Russo-Japanese war until the mid 1930s\nwas to brittle and inflexable for combat and it also did not allow for a two\nhanded grip. Also there were strong nationalistic feelings at the time and\nmany people thought that they should be using there own swords instead of\ncopying an inferior western style. at the time of WW2 an officer could\npurchase a machine made sword, or for extra cost he could order a handmade\none. In addition many officers were decended from samurai and many family\nswords were remounted in military mounts and taken to war. I am sure there\nwas a great deal of pride in taking great grandads sword to war.(some of\nwhich had family mons on the mounts)\nI dont think they thought the were samurai, but I am sure that they saw\nthemselves in a similer light, same ideals and values anyway.(When they\nasked a group of fighter pilots if anyone would fly a plane into a ship the\nresponse was allways almost 100% YES!!) I have couple of WW2 mounted swords,\none is late war poor quality and machine made, the other dates from the mid\n1500s. And both show evidence of actual use in combat in WW2.\n\nDave Jackson\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Josh Wilson&quot; &lt;lordwilson@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, February 07, 2004 8:31 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Trying to learn\n\n\n&gt; because the katana is the typical japanese sword.. obviously the reason\nthe japanese used them... and w/ their curved blade they were very much like\na saber.. also, the japanese had some saber-type swords during WWII..\n&gt;\n&gt; Wilson\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; --------- Original Message ---------\n&gt;\n&gt; DATE: Sat, 7 Feb 2004 20:18:14\n&gt; From: Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Okay, but why a Katana instead of a calvery sword like other (US)\nmilitaries.

Over rather a\nfew tokkuri of warm sake in recent months he has been regaling me with\nstories of when he served in Manchuria, much as my grandfather did with his\nstories from North Africa, Italy, the Middle East and India. He clearly\nfound that while officers were more than often not of samurai stock, but\nconsidered themselves the successors of that class, perhaps in a similar\nmanner to which many yakuza consider themselves modern samurai.\n&gt; &gt;So why did they carry swords? Why do officers in many officers around the\nworld carry swords? If you view the photographs of the carnage on the\nWestern Front during WW1 you will still see officers leading their troops\nsword in hand. Why? Distinction.  Still, the officer has to be seen as\nsuperior to his/her men/women (not to be accused of sexism) and the sword is\nan obvious symbol universally of such a principle.  A man with a sword has\nalways ranked higher than one with a spear or musket.\n&gt; &gt;M.Lorimer\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On Feb 5, 2004, at 10:54 AM, Josh Wilson wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tony, not to dispute you, but why was your response about the officers\n&gt; &gt;&gt; considering themselves samurai incorrect?? In WWI, the cavalry still\n&gt; &gt;&gt; consisted of horses, but by WWII, the cavalry was tanks and such.. if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yor in a tank w/ a biiiiiiiiig cannon on the front, whats the point of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a sword?? hence why the sword became a dress item, it no longer had a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; functional purpose.. However I have seen many pictures in textbooks\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and on the history channel and such showing the Japanese at prison\n&gt; &gt;&gt; camps using the swords to behead POWs.. I also heard on the history\n&gt; &gt;&gt; channel that they did consider themselves samurai, even tho they knew\n&gt; &gt;&gt; they werent.. So I jsut wondered what else you had to say about the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; subject and where you got your info..
