Hmm if thats what we can call it. Oh I\n&gt; mean movie based on a samurai. If any one else has\n&gt; seen it what do you think about it. \n\nYou&#39;re going to need to be a little more specific,\nlike give us a title of the movie, or director, or\nsomething. Telling us you&#39;ve seen a movie about\nsamurai with Japanese people in it (which is what\n&quot;Nihonjin&quot; means) and then asking us what we thought\nis like a Japanese person saying &quot;I saw a Hollywood\nperson with white people in it. What did you think of\nthe movie?&quot;\n\nIn other words, we need the title of the movie to\nanswer your question. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
