You \nwould be right though to say that there was respect and real \nfriendship born of the conflict between England and Satsuma. A \nreading of the British accounts of the time I think will show how \nbonds were formed between the two out of the negotiations that \nfollowed the burning of Kagoshima. Some of this is off the top of my \nhead but is how I remember the seeds of British support for the \nwestern han were planted.\n-t\n\n"
