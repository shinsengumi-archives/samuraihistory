It is like the Virgin Mary job - someone had\n&gt; it - they were \n&gt; well\n&gt; &gt; known for it, and the job is abolished. \n&gt; &gt; I have studied various martial arts, and am still\n&gt; studying. I lived \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; Japan, enjoyed learning the ways and language,and\n&gt; I know a goodly\n&gt; &gt; chunk of japanese history. I make japanese style\n&gt; armor (note - I \n&gt; did\n&gt; &gt; not say I make Japanese armor) and I make Japanese\n&gt; style equipment \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; re-enacting a &quot;samurai&quot; lifestyle.\n&gt; &gt; Re-enacting, people...\n&gt; &gt; Anyone who has ethics of any sort lives by a\n&gt; &quot;code...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Your code may or may not resemble a &quot;code&quot;\n&gt; followed by Samurai, but\n&gt; &gt; since none are living, and none are &quot;Legal&quot; then\n&gt; we do what we can.\n&gt; &gt; If you are honest to your goals, and enjoy the\n&gt; asthetics of a\n&gt; &gt; reasonably Japanese&quot; life style, so be it. A real\n&gt; person can see \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; for what it is.\n&gt; &gt; Just because this is the &quot;samurai List&quot; does not\n&gt; mean any one of us\n&gt; &gt; are Samurai...\n&gt; &gt; Hagakure was written by well meaning people who\n&gt; either saw their \n&gt; jobs\n&gt; &gt; getting destroyed, or were sitting around wishing\n&gt; their jobs had \n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; been destroyed. Guess what - I have had my paid\n&gt; jobs destroyed\n&gt; &gt; numerous times...I survived, and my ethics are\n&gt; intact. That says\n&gt; &gt; something about me, not the jobs...\n&gt; &gt; Was Hagakure an ultimate, end all code that all\n&gt; Samurai followed?\n&gt; &gt; Hell no. It is a mish mash. One could go through\n&gt; modern corporate\n&gt; &gt; employee handbooks and find similar things...\n&gt; &gt; I hope archaeologists in three hundred years don&#39;t\n&gt; think the \n&gt; everyday\n&gt; &gt; &quot;public servant&quot; of our times followed such things\n&gt; to the letter - \n&gt; let\n&gt; &gt; alone anyone who has gotten a black belt through a\n&gt; grist mill \n&gt; martial\n&gt; &gt; arts dojo...\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Bomb Diplomacy&quot;? I could see how modern folk\n&gt; could take that the\n&gt; &gt; wrong way, and read &quot;Nagasaki...&quot; take that the\n&gt; wrong way, but \n&gt; perhaps\n&gt; &gt; the shock value of the truth is what is hinted\n&gt; at...\n&gt; &gt; That actually goes to prove my point. It is a\n&gt; politically oriented\n&gt; &gt; concept applied to something that was intended in\n&gt; an earlier, more\n&gt; &gt; pure state...referring to shock value and truth.\n&gt; &gt; I too would hire Tony - and I have very high\n&gt; clearances in the\n&gt; &gt; U.S.M.C. Ordanance Disposal department...\n&gt; &gt; I was willing to die for my country and for those\n&gt; I served....did \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; make me a samurai? No.\n&gt; &gt; It might have once...but not now...\n&gt; &gt; there are no samurai....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Date Saburou yukiie - \n&gt; &gt; Christopher Wright...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &quot;midorinotoradesu&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bkirkham@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The irony and sarcasm of this group has gone\n&gt; over the deep end.  \n&gt; I&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; &gt; try not to tell my wife (who is Japanese) about\n&gt; the theory of \n&gt; &quot;Bomb \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Diplomacy&quot;.  She probably won&#39;t appreciate it\n&gt; very much.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would however, like to say that Tony is one of\n&gt; the most \n&gt; eloquent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; writers I know.
