Who&#39;s the most\nwell-known samurai outside of Japan? When you think\n&quot;samurai&quot;, who&#39;s name first comes to mind? This is\nabout as GENERAL as you could possibly make a\nquestion. And don&#39;t put &quot;ANSWER ASAP&quot;--it makes me\nthink you&#39;re doing this for a report or something for\nyour 7th grade world history class, and don&#39;t want to\nbother to do any research yourself, but have to have\nthe paper turned in tomorrow. \n\nTo answer the way I rephrased the question, I&#39;d say\nfor the first, it&#39;s probably Miyamoto Musashi,\nunfortunately. For the second, undoubtedly I think of\nOda Nobunaga.\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance Tax Center - File online.
