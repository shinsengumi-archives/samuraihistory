If you look at the \nboard about &#39;the Last Samurai&#39; in www.imdb.com, there is a big \ndiscussion going on, with at least 5 people calling themselves \n&quot;samurai&quot; (for various reasons), and a lot more mocking them.\nNow, I have lived in Kyoto for 6 years (and I will be back in a few \nyears), and I am personally quite annoyed by the &quot;I-am-a-samurai&quot; guys \n(or &quot;I-am-a-Zen-monk,&quot; etc.), especially gaijins. And believe me, there \nare a lot of them in Japan. And after Tom Cruise&#39;s movie, expect \nmore...\nHowever, my opinion is that everybody is entitled to his/her own \nfantasies. As far as these &quot;samurai&quot; do not go around cutting people \nfor real, I believe we should tolerate them. We all have our own \ndreams, and we hate others shattering them, don&#39;t we?\nThe only alternative would be to be &quot;NORMAL.&quot; Now, there we would \nreally have a problem...\nBye!\ncepo, honolulu\n\n\n"
