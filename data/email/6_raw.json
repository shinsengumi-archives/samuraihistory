Modern _and_ Classical?\n\nBe much easier to point you in the right direction with these things \nincluded in your mail (for the newcomers at least).\n\nCheers,\n\nShannon\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@egroups.com, &quot;Alexander M.

I know that the Takeda family continued through Takeda \nKunitsugu 1551-1592. According to the information I have, he was \nnephew to Takeda Shingen. The problem I&#39;m having here is that None of \nTakeda Shingen&#39;s brothers had any children that lived, and as far as \nI can tell, none of them had any sons named Kunitsugu.\n&gt;     The best that I can figure is that Takeda Kunitsugu was from \nthe female half of the line . . . the son of one of the married \ndaughters. I don&#39;t know if that works correctly, though. He still \nbore the name Takeda, and in other societies, a woman married into \nanother family took on the name of that family.\n&gt;     If you have the information I&#39;m looking for, please email me. I \nvery much want to trace the line of the Takedas up to Takeda \nKunitsugu, going through Takeda Sokichi and finally Takeda Sakaku and \nhis son Takeda Tokemune.\n&gt;     I also would not mind it if you had some information on the \nAizu clan. The house Saigo specifically. Takeda Sakaku, according to \nthe facts I have, was sent to live with Saigo Tanomo during the wars.\n&gt;     Any info you have will be helpful. This is for a martial arts \nstudy of Daito ryu. I know that the art passed from Kunitsugu to \nSoemon, then passed to Sakaku through Saigo Tanomo who had learned it \nfrom Takeda Soemon.\n&gt;     Again, any info you have would be helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Alex Frazier\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
