Be it psychological, be it existential, be it an phisical illness.\n\nMore research on this subject can also give buddhist roots in the oriental\nand ocidental (though Hipocrates and what was before him) medicinal systems,\nbut it is beyond the topic and will not speak about this issue here.\n\nAnd disagreeing with mr goldman, Jesuits was not good to Japan and not good\nto Brazil. Non-christian for such theology of those intolerant christian\ntimes, was not barelly considered humans until their convertion that should\nbe done whatever means would be necessary, including sword-pointed\nconvertion.\n\nThe Samurai Spirit is much about Honour, Loyalty (not to a fictional god but\nto the Lord he and his ancestors gaves oath of allegiance) and also, the\nmost elevated moral values of the classical japanese culture that also\nincludes:\n\nRespect and Loyalty to the Shogun\nRespect and Loyalty to his daimyo\nRespect and reverence to ancestors\nReverence and respect to the family (Oyakoko)\nand foremost and in no way of less importance,\nreverence and devotion to the GODS of the Land.\n\n(and I can point SEVERAL verses in the Old and New testment that will\nblasphemously against such values)\n\nA TRUE Samurai NEVER would convert himself to a religion that demonizes his\nancestors spirits, the Gods of his ancestors, and if he is much into Shinto,\nspecially due to it, the Gods that makes the Imperator (Ten no Heika), a\nHoly man.\n\nThe convertion in itself is already an act of threason desserving a sepukku!\n\nIt is true that one must be, at least one time in his life, a buddhist, to\nat least understand what buddhism is. No theoric studies can make one\nunderstand even the superfitial aspects of such doctrine.\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\nMessage: 16\n   Date: Tue, 10 Feb 2004 19:19:14 +0000\n   From: golfmandan@...\nSubject: Re: Re: Samurai is not christian\n\nLet me say first off that you&#39;ve misunderstood Christianity and Buddhism and\nmost world religions if you think that the point is simply morality. Sure,\nmost religions have a system of morality, but the defining of good and bad\nis NOT the point. In Christianity the point is peace with God through faith\nin Christ. In Buddhism the point is the cessation of individual existence in\nan illusory world, to exist only in Nirvana. Christians want to propogate\ntheir religion because they believe people will be judged by God when they\ndie, and so they think people need forgiveness to enter heaven instead of\nhell. Buddhists propogate their religion because they believe people are\nblinded by the material world from their need to escape into a painless and\nselfless existence in Nirvana. It IS the root principle that matters. The\nmoral system is a reflection of the root belief. That&#39;s why Buddhist morals\nand Christian morals are so different. They DON&quot;T teach the same thing. I&#39;d\nassume from your post that you&#39;re not a very religious guy. Talk to anybody\nwho takes their religion seriously and you&#39;ll find that the beliefs are most\nimportant, not the least important.\n\nWhich, that&#39;s why the Jesuit missionaries tried to clothe Christian truth in\nthe fashion of contemporary Japanese religion. Christian beliefs with\nJapanese rituals or practice. It&#39;s the underlying  belief that is most\nimportant. So, in theory, if you make it look a little more Japanese, it\nbecomes easier for the Japanese to understand, but the core beliefs remain\nintact. This method of propogating Roman Catholic faith was used by their\nmissionaries a lot. It isn&#39;t looked at as deceitful, but simply as\ncommunicating their beliefs in such a way as to be more easily understood,\nand to some extent, in a manner more palatable to the mind of the one being\ntaught. Some of this has to do with Aristotelian distinctions between the\naccident and occident of a thing... The &quot;accident&quot; is the appearance of a\nthing. The &quot;occident&quot; is the core essence. The accident doesn&#39;t matter\nnearly as much as the occident. So, as long as the same core belief is being\ntaught, then the Catholics didn&#39;t care what it looked like. (In actual\npractice, though, the old Catholic method tends toward syncretism... mixing\nof both belief and ritual... so nothing remains in its pure form).\n\n\n\n"
