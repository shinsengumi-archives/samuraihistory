As in the Hojo commiting seppuku en masse at the \nbattle of Kamakura, =\r\nto avoid capture, and humiliation. Or for say the \nfailure to complete your=\r\n mission, saying to your lord and all your \ncomrades you gave your utmost (=\r\nliterally).\n\tSo in my mind anyway the presence or addition of a Kaishaku wa=\r\ns as the \nname in english implies &quot;Second-ary&quot;, the act is one you do by yo=\r\nurself \nto preserve your or your families position, status, face, honour if=\r\n you \nlike. The Kaishaku when present helped to make things a bit neater an=\r\nd \ncertainly less painful for the man in the hot seat but Seppuku was no \nl=\r\ness impressive, effective and honourable without him...\n-t\nOn Aug 3, 2004, =\r\nat 8:51 PM, M.
