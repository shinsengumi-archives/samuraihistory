So maybe when comparing \nthe two films they are a bit closer than one would think. Of course a \nbetter example would be to read Dashiel Hammet&#39;s &#39;Red Harvest&#39; and watch \nYojimbo knowing that Kurosawa is a fan of detective novels.\n\n&gt;You notice that, in THE SEVEN SAMURAI, when the farmers come to recruit some \n&gt;ronin, most of the ronin turn up their noses -- that last thing on this earth \n&gt;that they would want to do is defend some farmers. \n&gt;\nI think films in general are poor guides to history. Anerican westerns \nare for the most part phony as well having known people who actually \nlived in the period there. For really quick reads Anthony Bryant&#39;s books \nare pretty good and for a sloppy but readily available introduction one \nof the Turnbull books is OK. Just don&#39;t bother with the ninja one, the \nrest are pretty much rehashes of his previous ones.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
