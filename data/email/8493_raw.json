According to the account in Sir George Sansom&#39;s history of Japan (vol 2), weapons at Sekigahara were as followed:\n   \n  &quot;The firearms were called teppo and weapons under this general name were classified not by the calibre but by the weight of the shot fired, which ranged from about half an ounce to four ounces.  Cannon at the time were not efficient. The fired shot of not more than two or three pounds, their range was short and they were unreliable. After Sekigahara guns were obtained from the English and Dutch traders and used to good effect at Osaka castle.

Can anyone expand on the cannon \n&gt;theory though? Sounds interesting.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;I had looked into this several months ago (the use or lack thereof of \n&gt;Tokugawa cannon at Sekigahara).\n&gt;The Governor-general of Nagasaki (who was also in charge of Kioesjoe, where \n&gt;Adam&#39;s ship De Liefde landed) sent a Jesuit to inspect and inventory the \n&gt;ship. Among other things, they found 500 muskets and 19 (or 18, depending \n&gt;on the account) bronze guns (cannons). Ieyasu took the guns and cannon \n&gt;after his third interview with Adams. A later Jesuit account states that it \n&gt;was the 19 guns that provided the margin of victory at Sekigahara. However, \n&gt;none of Adam&#39;s letters mention the cannon being used and (aside from a \n&gt;short mention in one of Tony&#39;s Osprey samurai books) this was the only \n&gt;mention of the Tokugawa forces using cannon at Sekigahara I could find \n&gt;(although it&#39;s well documented that Ishida used several). I&#39;ve never seen \n&gt;them mentioned in a Japanese source. Since the Jesuits were known to slant \n&gt;history for their own purposes, my opinion is that the account of the \n&gt;cannon being used was fabricated to show the &#39;menace&#39; of Protestant traders \n&gt;in Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;Yahoo!
