My name is Phil and I have been  trying\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; find some good \n&gt; &gt; information on the  religion of Shinto. I am one\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; does not belong  \n&gt; &gt; to a religious faith due to personal reasons but I\n&gt;  do\n&gt; &gt; find a \n&gt; &gt; resemblence in my personal beliefs and  that of\n&gt; Shintoism.\n&gt; &gt; I have \n&gt; &gt; been surfing the  internet but I would really like\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; hard copy \n&gt;  &gt; books to research. If anyone can make any\n&gt; &gt; recommendations, I  would \n&gt; &gt; greatly appreciate it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Phil\nI found that SHINTO THE WAY HOME is available at Amazon.com. I found two  \nother Shinto books that focus on prayers, meditations, and current practice.  \nEach was written by a Westerner who is currently practicing Shinto, each having  \nbeen taught by Japanese. I ordered one of the meditation/prayer books. I am  \nactually a Christian, an Episcopalian -- unlike many current-day people of  \nvarious religions, instead of focusing on &quot;the One True Way&quot; of my particular  \nreligion, instead I find so much in common in various religions and spiritual  \nbeliefs. The pastor of my church has also led us in various spiritual paths, \nnot  just strictly in her own Christian Episcopal beliefs.\n \nI&#39;ve also found that in Japan and I believe in other Eastern societies,  that \nreligious beliefs are not nearly so clear-cut or exclusive as they are in  \nthe West. I know that many Japanese practice both Shinto and Buddhist  rites and \nfind nothing contradictory in doing so.  \n \nHope this helps, Nina aka &quot;Wave Tossed&quot;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;**************************************&lt;BR&gt; AOL now offers free \nemail to everyone.
