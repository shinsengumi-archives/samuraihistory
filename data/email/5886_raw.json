The KOTE has all of these lames, mail, and plates on it, but what kind of material are these connected to?,and How do you attach all of the plates,mail, & lames to it??? I&#39;ve been useing the website www.sengokudaimyo.com as a guide to making my own authentic samurai armour but some of the chapters don&#39;t tell me everything i need.(like what certain fabric or materials are needed) Keep in mind, it is the best website i&#39;ve found about making samurai armour yet, but some of the small important details needed arn&#39;t included. If anyone can help, please do so. Also, if anyone knows any great websites or books on THE PROCESSES & THE MATERIALS NEEDED to make samurai armour, please let me know. Thank you for your time.\n                                                        Thank you, \n                                                          MARK\n                                                           depos42300@... \n\n\t\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Check out the new Yahoo!
