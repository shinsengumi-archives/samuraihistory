These are old\n&gt; novels by James Clavell.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I find that he has been able to intertwine his\n&gt; fiction\n&gt; with historical fact (up to a certain point)in his\n&gt; work on Asian sagas.  And more importantly, the new\n&gt; movie, The Last Samurai&#39;s Character, Aldrin, is very\n&gt; similar to the lead character of Shogun, Anjin-san. \n&gt; This makes the Tom Cruise version dated in terms of\n&gt; story line for those that have read Clavell&#39;s books.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any comments?  Violent reactions?\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Protect your identity with Yahoo!
