He took \nKannabe Castle (which he had been running when the Amako wer=\r\ne \naround) from the Mori ..but they eventually took it back and he died \nla=\r\nter during the following combat. This was in the Summer of 1569.\n\n      his=\r\n brother, Fujii Taroemon... actually served the Mori from \nthe get go... he=\r\n was a Naval Captain, I think.... I am pretty sure \nhe use to fight Oda&#39;s f=\r\nleets in the waters between West Honshu and \nShikoku (from Hiroshima to Osa=\r\nka).  I believe he eventually retired \nand he and one of his sons shaved th=\r\neir heads and became \nmonks/priest.. one Shingon and the other to Pure Land=\r\n... I think.\n\n      The third brother, Fujii Saburoemon... I know nothing a=\r\nbout. I \nthink he ended up traveling from Bitchu to Hazu-gun in Nagoya.\n\n  =\r\n    The fourth brother.. I have no idea... although I think he \nmight be re=\r\nlated somehow to Kurozaemon perhaps.\n\n     Anyway..this all took place in W=\r\nest Honshu out in the Mori \nterritories (like around Hiroshima and Okayama =\r\nand Osaka)\n\n   Any info you could find/help me with.. I would appreciate it=\r\n.\n  \n Thank you !\n\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
