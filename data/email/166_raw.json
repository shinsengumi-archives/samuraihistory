It started with manga&#39;s like Lone wolf and cub and\n&gt; movies like Yojimbo, Ran etc. But as I grew older my interest in the\n&gt; history grew.\n&gt;    I am definitly an amature historian and not a scholar by any sense\n&gt; of the word. But I hope to contribute to the list as time goes on.\n&gt;\n&gt;    My question is, were peasants literate during the samurai eras or\n&gt; was it only the samurai or noble classes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Aaron\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
