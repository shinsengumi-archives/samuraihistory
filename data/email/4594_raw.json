I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get \nbetter answers, but allow me to comment=\r\n on one or two of your \nquestions.\n\n&gt;1) How long was the Uji bridge (width =\r\nand length), or the width of \n&gt;the Ujigawa at this location?\n\nI don&#39;t know =\r\nthis. I do know that today the bridge is 155 meters \nlong.\n\n&gt;2) The map on =\r\npage 26 is not very detailed. Where is the Byodo-in, in \n&gt;relation to the U=\r\nji bridge and the box representing Nara shown on the \n&gt;map? Does anybody ha=\r\nve a more detailed map of the region with the \n&gt;places marked and the topog=\r\nraphy?\n\nI don&#39;t have the book so I can&#39;t refer to what you are seeing. In \n=\r\nany event, if you can read Japanese this is a very servicable map:\nhttp://w=\r\neb.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/uji-web/map.html\n\nIf you can&#39;t read Japanese, th=\r\nen the Byoudou-in is in the lower-left \nhand corner of C4 (it&#39;s marked with=\r\n a red dot that is also a \nhyperlink). The bridge (Uji Bashi) is right in t=\r\nhe middle of C3. \n\n&gt;3) Turnbull states that the Minamoto forces at the batt=\r\nle numbered \n&gt;300. Does anybody know the composition of these forces? He do=\r\nes \n&gt;mention that some were monks. How many?\n\nAccording to the Tale of Heik=\r\ne, it was 1000. This is probably \ninflated just like most old histories are=\r\n. It might have been closer \nto 50 samurai. But I&#39;ll leave the rest to the =\r\nexperts. :)\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives:=\r\n http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafesho=\r\nps.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
