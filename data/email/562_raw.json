A google search brought to my \nattention lots of positive reviews and mentions from bookstores and people \nwho seem to be students of various martial arts, but not from any source I \nwould consider authoritative on the subject of Japanese cultural history; I \ncould find no academic reviews.  While the book has a fairly large \nbibliography as I recall, and does mention, I think, something called the \nHistoria Nipponica in the credits, I don&#39;t remember seeing any footnotes, \npage references to other sources, or endnotes; this lack set off a warning \nbell.\n\nSo, does anyone here know anything about how well received this work is by \nhistorians and scholars?\n\nThanks for any advice.\n\nTodd\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\n\n"
