I&#39;m new to the forum and all, but I know \na great lot about samurai, weapons, and ancient japan. I myself, \nfollow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real life Samurai, though \nSamurai&#39;s have been outlawed since the late 1800&#39;s, I still consider \nmyself one. I&#39;ve been to Japan, and studied the fighting skills from \nSensei Ichi Hayamatsu, learned the old culture and the respects. And \nwith this, I&#39;ve become a Samurai. I want to be the one to say how Im \nhonored in joining this forum, and expect a lot of great stuff from \nyou all as well. \n\nThat is all.\n-Kyosuke Miyamoto\n\nP.S. Im also A fanatic of old Samurai Movies. If you&#39;d like we can \ntalk of them.\n\n\n\n"
