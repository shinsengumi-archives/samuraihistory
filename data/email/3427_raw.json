I&#39;m new to the group. I&#39;ve got a favour to ask \neveryone. As most of you will probably know in Japan they produce or \ndid produce the historical tv dramas called taiga dramas. \nUnfortunately, being in the UK we don&#39;t get them here. Nor do they \nsell copies of them. There are 5 that I&#39;m after in particular. They \nare: \n\nOda Nobunaga - King of Zipangu\nHideyoshi\nTokugawa Ieyasu\nMori Motonari\nTaiko-ki (which was made in the 60s I think)\n\nI&#39;d also be interested in Takeda Shingen, or there was one about \nDate Masamune but the title isn&#39;t Date Masamune. It&#39;s something else \nI think. My question is has anyone got copies of any of these and if \nso would they be prepared to sell them to me. \n\nThey&#39;d need to be subtitled of course (if subtitled copies exist). \nRegrettably my Japanese is pretty dire!!\n\nIf anyone can help me out that&#39;d be great.\n\nThanks\n\nNeil\n\nPS - dvd or vhs is cool.\n\n\n\n\n"
