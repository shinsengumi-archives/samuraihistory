I have no idea how ashigaru address each \nother.  \n\nhopefully others here can clarify - now I&#39;m curious. But another \noption in fiction would be to scrap the Japanese titles altogether \nand use the english equivalents (Lord Hayashi) (Yes, my lord) stuff \nlike that...\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Davidson \n&lt;thomas@t...&gt;&quot; &lt;thomas@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m seeking clarification on forms of address within samurai \n&gt; circles in the late Sengoku era.\n&gt; \n&gt; Was &quot;san&quot; used in this period?\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the proper usage of the term &quot;sama&quot;? I know it&#39;s used \n&gt; following a name, but then so is &quot;dono&quot; and &quot;tono&quot; (or are they \n&gt; two spellings of the same word).\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently I&#39;ve been informed of &quot;oyakata-sama&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m working on a fiction piece, and trying to get the forms of \n&gt; address right, so a broadside of questions if anyone&#39;s got the \n&gt; time or inclination to answer:\n&gt; \n&gt; Form of address between samurai of equal status but different \n&gt; han.\n&gt; \n&gt; Form used by samurai of equal status with in same han.\n&gt; \n&gt; Form used by commoners addressing samurai.\n&gt; \n&gt; Form used by samurai referring to his lord (to his lord).\n&gt; \n&gt; Form used by samurai referring to his lord (to another samurai \n&gt; - either within or outside the han).\n&gt; \n&gt; Form used by samurai referring to another&#39;s lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you get the idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help appreciated,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n\n\n"
