However I am pretty certain that there were no members of \nthe Tokugawa clan that are named in extant sources (Dating before the Sengoku \nera anyway). This does not mean that the Matsudaira were not an old family, \nonly that they were not able to draw any direct links to the Minamoto...Back \nto my first point, it was my impression that Tokugawa Ieyasu &#39;found&#39; a line \nof his family that was linked to a Buke named &#39;Nitta&#39; (I think as vassals-not \ntoo sure..) from the Mikawa area and that he claimed his links to them in his \nefforts to convince Japan (Not least the Emperor.) of his right to rule.\n\n"
