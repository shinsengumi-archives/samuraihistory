It deals with the Yoshiwara or =\r\npleasure \nquarter of Tokyo. According to historical events the Yoshiwara bu=\r\nrnt \ndown several times since its creation in the 1600&#39;s by the Tokugawa \nr=\r\negime. I was wondering if anyone knew of a site or had the information \nabo=\r\nut the specific timeline of the fires such as months and years. I \nwould ap=\r\npreciate it. Thanks to all.\nRod\n\n\n\n\n\n"
