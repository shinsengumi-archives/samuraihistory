I mean, what is the rank of BRIGADIER general, \nafterall? The CSA Army had that one right -- and we used to have bird colonels \ndoing it all the time (and still do).\n\n\n&gt; There WAS no rank system in a sengoku army. Don&#39;t\n&gt; confuse ranks with &quot;ranking&quot;. Obviously some people\n&gt; were more important than others, and some jobs were\n&gt; more prestigious, etc. But you didn&#39;t start as\n&gt; Ashigaru 2nd Class, work up to Ashigaru 1st Class,\n&gt; then Gunsou, then 2nd Samurai, then 1st Samurai, etc. \n\nYou put it better than I do. I like that perspective of working through \n&quot;Ashigaru 2nd class&quot; to &quot;1st Samurai.&quot; :)\n\n&gt; You simply can&#39;t fit the square Sengoku army peg into\n&gt; the round modern military hole. \n\nWhich is a chorus I find myself repeating too often....\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
