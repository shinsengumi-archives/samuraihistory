It took place on =\r\nthis \n&gt; drama. I know it must have significant meaning... \n&gt; Thank you for =\r\nyour time!!!!!!!!\n&gt;Hey man im not acactlly sure what it means,but i think i=\r\nts a sigh that \nthere a samurai and that that the ponytail is a symbol of h=\r\nonor of \ntrained samurai i think im not sure ill have to look for u someime=\r\n. if \nu find out tell me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
