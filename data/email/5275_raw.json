Every source\n&gt; I&#39;ve read (including \n&gt; the Japanese ones) echoes this-the Shogunate at the\n&gt; time simply did \n&gt; not have the money to follow through. When I&#39;ve\n&gt; talked to the people \n&gt; who staff Ginkakuji they also state this (but they\n&gt; likely would even \n&gt; if it wasn&#39;t true...makes for a better sounding\n&gt; history!).\n\nOkay, must have been somewhere besides Sansom. The\nofficial website (linked off of the website Tony gave)\nmakes no mention at all of even why it&#39;s called the\nGinkakuji, or why it&#39;s not covered with silver. You&#39;d\nthink the official website would address this, at\nleast the origin of the name. \n\nI know I&#39;ve read in a reputable sources somewhere that\nthe Ginkaku was not actually supposed to be covered in\nsilver. The reasoning is that it was built in a\nsimiliar style to the Kinkaku (it&#39;s uncanny how\nsimiliar the actual pavilions themselves are), and so\nwas named such because it was just a contrast between\nthe two. \n\nWhile it seems to make sense that the reason was lack\nof funds, etc., it just for some reason sticks in my\nhead as &quot;too easy&quot;...as something that one &quot;expert&quot;\nsaid, and now everyone echoes them without really\nlooking into it. It really bothers me that the\nGinkakuji itself makes no mention of it. \n\nOh well. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
