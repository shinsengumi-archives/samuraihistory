There&#39;s several names according to the\nshape, etc., and I&#39;m sure one of our resident ninja\nmasters will pipe up and tell us, but I&#39;m not sure\nwhat all they are. I know under the heading of\n&quot;shuriken&quot;, you&#39;ve got all sorts of shapes and sizes\nof throwing knives, including the disc and star shaped\ntypes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
