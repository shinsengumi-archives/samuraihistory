The \nSamurai were a military social class.  The entire class was abolished \nin the Meiji restoration.  In order to be a Samurai, you had to be \nborn into that class.  Although, there are some examples of upward \nmobility (Toyotomi Hideyoshi being the best example).  The distinct \nline was drawn between classes by the hand of the man who benefitted \nmost from that mobility (Toyotomi Hideyoshi).  300 years later, \nEmperor removed the Samurai class from existance.  Samurai are \nhistory.  Anyone who claims to be a Samurai now, is either ignorant, \na liar, or insane.  Exactly what kind of &quot;serious jobs&quot; are there for \na Samurai anyhow?\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Yama Kaminari no Date Saburou \nYukiie&quot; &lt;kabuto@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Konban wa, tomodachi,\n&gt; &lt;begin the don&#39;t-rant-often-but-come-on-guys-rant&gt;\n&gt; I have always found it interesting that while we study the samurai, \nwe\n&gt; study martial arts, and we ebate ofer distinct and indistinct\n&gt; possibilities of what &quot;samurai&quot; were, there can be no doubt that in\n&gt; the current &quot;real&quot; world, samurai do not, and cannot exist. they \nare\n&gt; done. It is like the Virgin Mary job - someone had it - they were \nwell\n&gt; known for it, and the job is abolished. \n&gt; I have studied various martial arts, and am still studying. I lived \nin\n&gt; Japan, enjoyed learning the ways and language,and I know a goodly\n&gt; chunk of japanese history. I make japanese style armor (note - I \ndid\n&gt; not say I make Japanese armor) and I make Japanese style equipment \nfor\n&gt; re-enacting a &quot;samurai&quot; lifestyle.\n&gt; Re-enacting, people...\n&gt; Anyone who has ethics of any sort lives by a &quot;code...&quot;\n&gt; Your code may or may not resemble a &quot;code&quot; followed by Samurai, but\n&gt; since none are living, and none are &quot;Legal&quot; then we do what we can.\n&gt; If you are honest to your goals, and enjoy the asthetics of a\n&gt; reasonably Japanese&quot; life style, so be it. A real person can see \nthat\n&gt; for what it is.\n&gt; Just because this is the &quot;samurai List&quot; does not mean any one of us\n&gt; are Samurai...\n&gt; Hagakure was written by well meaning people who either saw their \njobs\n&gt; getting destroyed, or were sitting around wishing their jobs had \nnot\n&gt; been destroyed. Guess what - I have had my paid jobs destroyed\n&gt; numerous times...I survived, and my ethics are intact. That says\n&gt; something about me, not the jobs...\n&gt; Was Hagakure an ultimate, end all code that all Samurai followed?\n&gt; Hell no. It is a mish mash. One could go through modern corporate\n&gt; employee handbooks and find similar things...\n&gt; I hope archaeologists in three hundred years don&#39;t think the \neveryday\n&gt; &quot;public servant&quot; of our times followed such things to the letter - \nlet\n&gt; alone anyone who has gotten a black belt through a grist mill \nmartial\n&gt; arts dojo...\n&gt; &quot;Bomb Diplomacy&quot;? I could see how modern folk could take that the\n&gt; wrong way, and read &quot;Nagasaki...&quot; take that the wrong way, but \nperhaps\n&gt; the shock value of the truth is what is hinted at...\n&gt; That actually goes to prove my point. It is a politically oriented\n&gt; concept applied to something that was intended in an earlier, more\n&gt; pure state...referring to shock value and truth.\n&gt; I too would hire Tony - and I have very high clearances in the\n&gt; U.S.M.C. Ordanance Disposal department...\n&gt; I was willing to die for my country and for those I served....did \nthat\n&gt; make me a samurai? No.\n&gt; It might have once...but not now...\n&gt; there are no samurai....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Date Saburou yukiie - \n&gt; Christopher Wright...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;midorinotoradesu&quot;\n&gt; &lt;bkirkham@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The irony and sarcasm of this group has gone over the deep end.  \nI&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; try not to tell my wife (who is Japanese) about the theory of \n&quot;Bomb \n&gt; &gt; Diplomacy&quot;.  She probably won&#39;t appreciate it very much.  \n&gt; &gt; I would however, like to say that Tony is one of the most \neloquent \n&gt; &gt; writers I know.
