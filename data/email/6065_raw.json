Which would make the SCA one\n&gt; of the (if not the) \n&gt; largest re-enactment societies with a world wide\n&gt; base. I would hazard to guess that \n&gt; the UK Sealed Knot and other English Civil War\n&gt; Societies would be next at \n&gt; 6,000 actives (including children).\n&gt; \n&gt; Being in the SCA is similiar to most other\n&gt; re-enactment societies or groups \n&gt; with an opportunity to &#39;recreate&#39; living history -\n&gt; in combat, day to day \n&gt; living, etc.\n&gt; And I would also guess based on personal experience\n&gt; with others both on and \n&gt; off this list - that many people have &#39;explored&#39; one\n&gt; or more &#39;personas&#39; with in \n&gt; the SCA - being myself both interested in western\n&gt; and eastern culture.\n&gt; As a member of the SCA - I&#39;ve been able to actively\n&gt; pursue (with others of \n&gt; similiar interest)- blacksmithing, armoursmithing,\n&gt; period woodworking, heavy \n&gt; combat, leatherworking, archery, casting, and\n&gt; more....\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have some real interest in the SCA you can\n&gt; get some answers at \n&gt; www.sca.org - or search for a local group in your\n&gt; area.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyostti,\n&gt; Company of Rakehells\n&gt; Buttlers Dragoons\n&gt; House of Sir Rashid\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
