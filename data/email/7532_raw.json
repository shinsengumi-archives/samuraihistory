First \npublished in 1961 it was reissued by Lexington Books in 2000. Plenty \nof info on Yoshida Shoin and his pupils. Analysis of the clan structure \nand the factors that made Choshu the main clan to challenge the \nbakufu.\n\nThere is a Yoshida Shoin society in Yamaguchi prefecture which issues \ninformation about him in English and Japanese and if you want it I will \nlook out their email address.\n\nSakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration by Marius B Jensen, also \nfirst published in 1961 (when the Meiji Restoration and bakumatsu \nhistory were hot topics among US historians) and resissued in 1994 by \nColumbia U.P. A very good historical biography. Ryoma&#39;s life was \ndramatic and romantic,  he wrote very good letters and died by \nassassination too young. What a hero!\n\nIncidentally it&#39;s the 170th year anniversary of Ryoma&#39;s birth and there \nhas just been a big exhibition on his life and times in Kyoto. A friend of \nmine went to see it and is sending me the catalog.\n\nThe Making of Modern Japan (Jansen again: Harvard UP) gives a good \noverview of the bakumatsu as well as the Tokugawa state, with some \nfascinating illustrations.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
