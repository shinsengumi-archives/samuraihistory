I mean as a work of \nhistorical FICTION (you know, based on history but mostly made up).  Not \nthat I won&#39;t be bugged by all the little things too.  I know I&#39;ll be sitting \nin the theater shaking my head muttering under my breath &quot;no, no, OH \ngimmeabreak! that could NEVER happen, where did they get this information?&quot;  \nMost movies have been like that for me since I became somewhat obsessed with \nMicheal Crichton books :)  Anyways, ya&#39;ll keep saying how you&#39;ll hate it but \nstill see it.  It will hurt.  It won&#39;t kill me.

Good? Bad?\n&gt;Date: Thu, 28 Aug 2003 15:50:13 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;Agreed....I think it will be painful. Horribly Wrong.\n&gt;And that&#39;s on top of how I feel about Tom Cruise in\n&gt;general. It will be the pain of Shogun (the\n&gt;translations, the Edo-jidai uniform kimono, the\n&gt;silliness of the whole love story) on a much grander\n&gt;scale. It will hurt. It will kill me. And I will go.\n&gt;\n&gt;Nate\n&gt;\n&gt;--- &quot;Anthony J.

But what do you\n&gt; &gt; guys think of it? Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you think it has the potential to be up there with\n&gt; &gt; Shogun and The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; crapfest to make money\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I look at going to it much as I do going to the\n&gt; &gt; dentist. I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t like it. I know\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;ll hurt. But I\n&gt; &gt; have to go.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tony\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
