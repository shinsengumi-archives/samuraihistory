So, I&#39;m announcing here first that I am now\naccepting submissions.  T=\r\nhe format for articles will generally follow\nthe Monumenta Nipponica styles=\r\nheet:\n\nhttp://monumenta.cc.sophia.ac.jp/submissions.html\n\nAlthough with som=\r\ne minor changes that will be covered in the webpage.\n Also, as I mentioned =\r\nbefore, although we encourage students and\nacademic scholars of Japanese hi=\r\nstory to submit articles for the\njournal, academic affiliation is by no mea=\r\nns a requirement.   Here is\nthe preliminary (in other words, rough draft) s=\r\ntatement on the home\npage of the journal website.  Feel free to post or ema=\r\nil me with any\nquestions.  We&#39;ll also be looking for anyone willing to make=\r\n donations\nto help fund the journal, but regardless, I&#39;m moving forward wit=\r\nh it.\n Thanks to the people who are helping me along with all this.\n\n\n\nThe =\r\nSamurai Archives Journal of Japanese History is a new journal\ndevoted to th=\r\ne critical examination of the events and personalities of\npre-20th century =\r\nJapan.\n\nThe goals of the Journal are to:\n\n# Encourage new and established s=\r\ncholars to share their research, as\nwell as to give independent scholars a =\r\nforum for their work\n# To introduce readers to the wealth of material avail=\r\nable in Japanese\nand English\n# To encourage interest and informed discussio=\r\nn on the topic of\nJapanese history\n\nThe journal is tentatively scheduled fo=\r\nr publication in early 2008,\nand is currently accepting submissions.\n\nAltho=\r\nugh the general focus of the journal is on military history and\nbiography, =\r\narticles dealing with all periods and subjects of Japanese\nhistory are welc=\r\nomed; we demand only solid scholarship, clear writing\nand original ideas. W=\r\nriters may approach their subjects from whichever\nfield or discipline they =\r\nwish.\n\nFor several years the Samurai Archives has been the most comprehensi=\r\nve\nand widely recognized source of Japanese history in English on the\ninter=\r\nnet. This print journal will draw on the resources of the website\nand the t=\r\nalents of its members as well as the scholarship of other\ncontributors to p=\r\nresent an authoritative and entertaining quarterly on\nthis fascinating subj=\r\nect.\n\n\n\n"
