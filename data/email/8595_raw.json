The business about &quot;secrets&quot; is common to \npretty much all Tokugawa period art forms. You generally had to have \ncertain elements, and &quot;secrets&quot; was one of them,. to be licensed to \nopen some arts school or other in Tokugawa Japan. You were also \nsupposed to have a book of theory and here the more high minded the \nbetter. Ideally, you were also &quot;ancient&quot;. As for shinai, they were \ndeveloped so that people in schools would not actually maim and kill \neach other during practices. During the Tokugawa period, the samurai \nmostly became petty burocrats. Some of them did perform police \nfunctions, but that was about it.\n\nIt wasn&#39;t really in the interest of the Tokugawa Bakufu for 10% of the \npopulation to constitute an effective fighting force.\n\n\n"
