New to this study \nand,=\r\n a bit overwhelmed. Dou is leather, on the front are three type of \nfruit w=\r\nith leafs, connected by pipeing to center, all boardered by a \ndouble circl=\r\ne of what might be oak leaves. If someone could just point \nme in right dir=\r\nection, I would be grateful,this armor has a feeling or \npresence, that my =\r\nwife even can sense.
