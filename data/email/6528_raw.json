Not sure about their\nexploits during the Gempei war, though they did serve\nthe Minamoto and Hojo during the Kamakura shogunate.\nThe Miura family continued on into the Sengoku. I\ndon&#39;t have the source information in front of me, but\nI believe they were defeated by the Hojo (the later\nHojo) around the early 1510&#39;s or so, as Hojo Soun and\nhis son expanded their control of the Kanto. Miura\nYoshimoto supposedly committed suicide in defeat by\nslicing off his own head--a neat trick, but sadly not\none you can repeat. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
