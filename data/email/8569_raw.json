The practice has been found through East and South \nEast Asia since ancient times. He gives two anecdotes relating the \nintroduction of container gardens into Japan: in one the Empress Suiko \n(593-628) received from the land of Kudara (Korea) a representation of \na holy mountain. A natural stone surrounded by white sand was placed \nin a bowl (hachi) which in turn was placed in a large dish. It was \ndecorated with climbing plants and called a katsura-hachi. The next \nstage introduced stones. Prince Shotoku (572 621) gave a dish (bon) in \nwhich he had set up a landscape with mountains and villages, \nfashioned from stones, to the Emperor who was sick at the time. This \nwas called a katsura-bon.  (Whether the Emperor recovered on \nreceiving this gift is not related by Stein.)\n\nIn Chinese paintings tray gardens with miniature trees are often \nportrayed. The earliest examples in Japanese painting come from the \n14th century (Stein is quoting Yanagisawa&#39;s 1962 work Tray \nLandscapes). Tray gardens and bonsai it seems were imbued with the \nsame sense of philosophy as painting, calligraphy and poetry.  \nPeasants may have kept small gardens in pots and collected interesting \ntrees from the mountain (though I think yamadori means mountain \nbird rather than mountain tree, doesn&#39;t it?) as this is a natural human \nactivity, but I would think the art of bonsai was more the pursuit of \nmonks, men of letters and artists. Gardening was a highly cultured \nactivity. The gardens held to have been designed by Sesshu in \nYamaguchi were considered works of art at the time of their creation. \nInterestingly, they are also &quot;in miniature&quot; - representing full scale \nlandscapes just as bonsai do, but on a slightly larger scale.\n\nHideyoshi himself was interested in planning gardens (was this his \npeasant ancestry :)) supervising the layout of his pleasure garden, \nSamboin.\n\nCheers,\n\nG\n\n"
