Esaka Seigen  \nSensei (Hanshi Ju-dan ) from Matsudo, Japan, will be\nvisiting the San Francisco bay area from 24 Aug 2009 to 1 Sep 2009.\nIn conjunction with the San Francisco Asian Art Museum \n(www.asianart.org),  he will\nlecture on and demonstrate Iaido, the traditional Japanese martial art\nof drawing and cutting with the sword. He will also be teaching Iaido\nclasses as part of his visit. Participants of any experience level  \nand from any style will be\nwelcome at the seminar, though space may be limited. If you or any of  \nyour students are\ninterested please let us know right away (outreach@...).  \nDetails of cost, location\nand registration to follow.\n\nThank you.\n\nSensei Andrej Hendryk Diamantstein (Renshi 6th Dan Z.N.I.R.)\n\nFrankly this is a really exciting event,\n\tit will run in conjunction with the museum exhibit, &quot;Lords of the  \nSamurai&quot;, (http://www.asianart.org/Samurai.htm), a great excuse to  \ncome to San Francisco, study swords and study swordsmanship with one  \nof the preeminent teachers now active in Japan. I am not sure members  \nof your dojo will be interested but they are all welcome and I hope  \nthat you will share this with any teacher, student or group that you  \nthink will be interested. This looks to be a terrific exhibition and  \nEsaka Sensei&#39;s instruction is always worthwhile. Hope we can see you  \nthere.\nYou friend in the way,\n-t\n\nTom Helm\ntoryu@...\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;\n- Vergil\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
