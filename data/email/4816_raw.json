However, that&#39;s why I\nwasn&#39;t going to pursue the point further. The original\nreply smacked of overstatement and irony, though\nadmittedly it is difficult to tell tone on email. \n\n&gt; Plus Tony doesn&#39;t need any defenders, although I&#39;ve\n&gt; caught errors a couple \n&gt; of times ;)\n\nNo, he doesn&#39;t--but he wasn&#39;t the only one with\ncomments on the post. I had some, as did Naomasa298. \n\nThe man says he&#39;s not taking it personally, so I&#39;ll go\nwith it. He&#39;s obviously got quite a bit of knowledge,\nso I&#39;m eager to hear from Solomon some more. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
