It was filmed in its entirety in New Zealand.  A friend of mine worked on the film, and said it was a miserable process, as there was nothing but sheep and scientologists in the general area, which made for a kind of wretched night-life.\n\n\nDavid Sigler &lt;fiat_dux_das@...&gt; wrote:\n\nA RESPONSE; the only &#39;real&#39; books on the subject I have are the following, &quot;Bushido&quot; by Inazo, &quot;Hagakure;The Book of the Samurai,&quot; by Yamamoto Tsunetomo. I don&#39;t think my &quot;Zen&quot; books count but I have a few of them as well. As for the tc movie, I liked the scenery, some of the history was accurate, the final battle scene was very well done even if tc survived. I love Japanese history and love their literature. I was just hoping for a better movie that showed Japan and it&#39;s history; its a fascinating country and people; lived on Okinawa, Japan for two years. \n                                                                                       david a sigler\n\nThomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; wrote:\n\nI suggest a file with a list of films and comments from members of the list, as well as a list \nof samurai fiction - available in English.\n\nFurthermore I volunteer to keep such a document if that suits everyone.\n\npost suggestions here, or email me.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
