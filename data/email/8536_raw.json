I believe the sword used in Mishima&#39;s seppuku was a Magoroku Kanemoto, the nidai - second generation - of the Muromachi period ca 1500 [He produced swords from Meio (1492) to the end of  Daie (1528)].  While searching for confirmation for this I came across the following link which may be an interesting read about katana for non-sword readers:\nhttp://www.answers.com/topic/japanese-sword\n\nI came across this link which seems to be similar to the above but with a slightly different layout.  It mentions Yukio Mishima in a list of famous users of katana, the list also being in the above reference but without Mishima&#39;s name:\nhttp://www.search.com/reference/Katana\n\nHere is the list of famous katana users:\n\nFamous historic katana users\n---------------------------------------------\n Ashikaga Yoshiteru\nTsukahara Bokuden\nIizasa Ienao\nMiyamoto Musashi\nSasaki Kojiro\nOkita Soji\nSaito Hajime\nYukio Mishima\n\nVery interesting that Yukio Mishima should be included in a list of famous sword users when Hakudo Nakayama in the early-mid 20th century was a far more famous swordsman.  But then, he didn&#39;t to my knowledge cut anyone!!\n\n&quot;Simon&quot; at http://www.vill.yamanakako.yamanashi.jp/cgi-bin/ekbc/kb.cgi/~vdocs/vill/docs/bbs?b=que_e&c=l&num=15 asks (30 August 2005):\n&gt;Does anyone know what became of Mishima Yukio&#39;s katana which was made \n&gt;by the famous swordmaker Kanemoto II (known as &quot;seki no Magoroku&quot;)?\n&gt;This was, of course, the sword used to decapitate both Mishima and \n&gt;Morita during their seppuku rituals and, as such, was probably \n&gt;immediately confiscated by the Tokyo police as evidence. I wonder if \n&gt;it was subsequently destroyed or returned to Mishima&#39;s widow?\n\nSo, having reasonably established it was the 2nd generation Kanemoto and not the 27th, I leave the list to follow its course...\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Paul Martin&quot; &lt;pmartin6@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2006 1:25 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Yukio Mishima\n\n\n\nI heard that the sword used in Mishima&#39;s suicide was a 27th generation \nKanemoto.
