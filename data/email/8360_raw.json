I believe that the\n &gt; strategic concepts inherent in Yagyu Shinkage-ryu, the\n &gt; sword art practiced and chosen by the Shogunate as one\n &gt; of its official styles, guided them in their decision\n &gt; making. \n \nAnd I think that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. I&#39;ll admit I know\nnext to nothing about the various schools of swordsmanship--nor do I\nreally have an interest in learning--but there is an awful lot more\ninvolved in governing a country than swinging around a sharpened piece\nof steel.\n \nThe Tokugawa bakufu lasted as long as it did because of the methods\nintroduced early on in regards to controlling the clans and the\nstrategic position of lands that were under direct bakufu control. These\nwere the reasons that it lasted as long as it did despite it&#39;s many\nproblems.\n \n--AngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
