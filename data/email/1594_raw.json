In modern society, hunters use scopes and guns of different make to kill the prey, then there are some who use a bow and arrow..a sign of true skill to go about hunting on equal grounds with the animal. The secret in both these methods are &quot;The advantage of Distance&quot;. The archer would surely perish if he sould wait for a galloping animal to be within range of execution. A rifle-man have no such concern. Is there honor in ending the life of the animal in such way? No...but skill in compensation for wind direction, form and calmness to squeeze the trigger without having fear of missing...would be.\nThe outcome of any war, ancient or modern, depends upon the weapons at hand to defeat the enemy with effective means. Large scale ware-fare call for large scale advancement in artillary. Honor in such matters ly in victory or defeat. After the war, a peaceful era existed in Japan and warriors now had to re=evaluate their purpose and manner of combat...that&#39;s when the code of Bushido was cultivated and Samurai became know for their skilled swordsmanship. Most Warriors of the war taught martial arts and the skill of the battlefield relevant to the Japanese Code,Archery, Kobudo Weaponry and the Swords...the soul and essence of the samurai\nHonor had almost no place during large scale wars...only when the combat form became 1 on 1 with a blade during the Edo Period and that of the days of Miyamoto Musashi. Try not to place the Bushido Code of Samurai Honor on Pre-Modern Japan...remember..those were Feudal times..unlike what followed.\nIn todays Martial arts...the code teach one to go about any means to defeat the attacker...for the attacker use any means to defeat you. There is no Honor in the actions of an attacker...then he should be dealt with accordingly...But with a reserve sense of Respect and Harmony in Conduct to the Code. The Code by which one fight...determine the Honorable means by which one exist.\nRegards\n Atisi Kazuari &lt;broccolihead30@...&gt; wrote:As many of us are aware, with the arrival of the portuguese and guns \nin 1542 and the subsequent use of firearms in battle and the \nchristianization of some of the Pre-Tokugawa warlords.\n\nOne has to wonder if the use of guns,while a great advange in \nbattle, was considered a dishonorable on the battlefield both, to the \none employing the weapon and the one being shot at?\n\n-Atsi\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
