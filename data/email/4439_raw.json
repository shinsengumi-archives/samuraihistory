About a week \nsince joining. Im very impressed with the group so far , Thanks for \nhaving me aboard. I have a living history society called the \nM.R.S.N.E.(Military Re-neactment Society of New England) one of our \naffiliated living history groups is called Daimyo of the Samurai . It \nis dedicated to the History, religion, and the way of the Samurai and \nwill express its self during time line events in costume as Samurai \nand as the Samurai families. In the spring 2005 I plan to purchase a \nhorse and complete a mounted Samurai impression to show off during \ntime line event. Also along with the armor and weapons. I also have \nstudied martial arts for the past 20 yrs in Kendo, kung fu and Tae \nKwon Do. I am in the research phase now; to learn every thing I can \nabout every aspect of the Samurai, This Yahoo group has already been \na great help to me in so far as research. I will have many questions \nin the near future. \n\nThanks\nSamurai\nTakara Tokugawa \n\naka Dave Erickson\n\n\n"
