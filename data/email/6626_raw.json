With two warriors \ndestined to aid her, she begins a search for six more so that \ntogether they may destroy the curse and free the land of evil. \n\nReview: Legend of the Eight Samurai had previously been reviewed \nbased on the original American version that had been heavily edited \nand stuck with dreadful English dubbing, both of which turned the \nfilm into a muddled, live-action cartoon. Left unedited and with the \noriginal Japanese soundtrack, this fantasy jidai geki from yakuza \nfilm master Kinji Fukasaku becomes an epic fantasy adventure with \nSonny Chiba and his action team delivering dazzling battles \nsequences, both conventional and otherworldly. Making it even better \nare vampy villains, an early &#39;80s soft rock soundtrack, outrageous \ncostumes, and elaborate special effects, culminating in a rollicking \nmix of period samurai action by way of Flash Gordon and Zu: Warriors \nfrom the Magic Mountain. \n\nEight Samurai came out at a time when period, costumed dramas in \nJapan were in decline. Director and co-writer Kinji Fukasaku, best \nknown for revitalizing the yakuza film in the early &#39;70s with \nstylized depictions of self-destructive anti-heroes, dove into the \njidai geki arena while envisioning a new breed of samurai film that \nwasn&#39;t locked into the well-established conventions of the genre. \nSamurai Reincarnation was his first attempt, yet by his own \nadmission, Legend of the Eight Samurai came far closer to matching \nhis ambitions. According to author Patrick Macias, it was to have \nbeen the starting point for a series of films that never emerged, \ndespite the relative success of Fukasaku&#39;s previous swordplay films. \n\nEight Samurai is based in part on a series of mythic, 19th century \ntales that were originally adapted into plays, radio programs and \nearly films. Co-screenwriter Toshio Kamata stripped down the series&#39; \ninnumerable cast of characters and authored a novel that became the \nbasis for this film. \n\nOne-time pop idols Hiroko Yakushimaru and Hiroyuki Sanada (The \nTwilight Samurai) are paired up respectively as the brave Princess \nShizu and the brash footman and samurai-wannabe Shinbei, both of \nwhom become unlikely lovers caught up in a nightmarish world where \nan eyeball-devouring old witch transforms into a giant centipede and \ndemons in human form command armies of murderous samurai and vixens \nwho breath and bleed deadly poison. With her clan cursed and wiped \nout by a pair of vengeful souls reincarnated as immortal demons, \nShizu&#39;s only hope is to find eight warriors destined from birth to \naid her in destroying this evil. This includes the fighting monk \nDosetsu Inumura (Sonny Chiba) and his gun-totting companion, a \nfemale assassin for hire (Etsuko Shihomi), a musician, a cave-\ndwelling warrior, a young boy, a remorseful samurai in the demons&#39; \nemploy, and Shinbei himself. \n\nKinji Fukasaku creates a dark, yet vibrant fantasy world with \ncolorfully theatric costuming and sets and lots of magical special \neffects from giant, flying serpents that carry their victims away to \ndazzling light effects and pyrotechnics. The lead villains are made \nmemorable by scenes (mild by today&#39;s standards) of skinning the \nflesh off young women or bathing nude in a bubbling pool of blood. \n\nImplanted among this imagery is the top-notch action choreography of \nSonny Chiba and his Japan Action Club. After owning the screen in \nthe &#39;70s when it came to urban karate action, Chiba had turned his \nsights to the period drama and increasingly, sci-fi or fantasy-\noriented films like the time-traveling G.I. Samurai (1979). Legend \nof the Eight Samurai is an ambitious work with Chiba&#39;s proteges \nHiroyuki Sanada and Etsuko Shihomi both delivering excellent action \nperformances. As an assassin with a love-hate relationship with one \nof the demons and an initial rivalry with one of her peers, Shihomi \nshows off her swordplay skills on numerous occasions. With Chiba in \na supporting role, Sanada gets the lion&#39;s share of the heroic action \nand it&#39;s well deserved. Throughout the film, he&#39;s seen carrying on \ncasual conversations while on a very spirited horse, swinging from \ntree to tree like Tarzan, and deftly wallowing into a mob of \nattackers with twin kama that look like straightened sickles. \n\nThere are a number of enjoyable fights, but the heroes&#39; storming of \nthe demon castle to save the captured princess is by far the film&#39;s \nhigh point. There is a strong Conan the Barbarian feel to much of \nthe film, but particularly here where those giant snakes come into \nplay again and our explosives and sword-slinging heroes battle armed \ngrunts, traps and sorcery. \n\nThe only thing missing from Legend of the Eight Samurai is a \nsuitable soundtrack. Rather than go strictly with traditional \nJapanese music, the filmmakers opted for pop music, specifically \nsoft rock and a theme song by John O&#39;Banion that could easily fit in \non a Time-Life compilation with the likes of Foreigner and Jefferson \nStarship. Honestly, I despised it the first time through with the \nAmerican editing and English dubbing. But it works better with the \noriginal Japanese version and should evoke a sort of nostalgic feel \nfor anyone who has fond memories of watching other fantasy movies of \nthe era like The Neverending Story and Ladyhawke. \n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/47ved\n\n\n\n\n"
