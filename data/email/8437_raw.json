During \nharvesti=\r\nng only the small stems called tencha are used. Everyday \ntable tea is call=\r\ned bancha. The lowest grade generally harvested \nfrom the second or third c=\r\nutting season. The first cutting in April \nis the best and brings the major=\r\nity of the farmer&#39;s annual income. A \nstep up from Bancha is Sencha harvest=\r\ned from the top two leaves of \nthe tea bush. Here in Shizuoka Japan we grow=\r\n gyokuro tea which is \nanother fine grade of tea. Also using only the first=\r\n cutting the \nleaves are shaded two to three weeks before harvesting. This =\r\nprocess \nlocks in the flavor. Inbetween these types are many mixes to produ=\r\nce \nunique flavors. If you are interested I could explain each in \ndetail. =\r\n\n\nHirai\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, seikei7248@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\nince we are on the subject of Ocha;  I was wondering if anyone \ncould remeb=\r\ner \n&gt; the grades fo Tea...
