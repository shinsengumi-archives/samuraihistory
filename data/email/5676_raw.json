His Edo counterpart was \nfar more reactionary - although vanity, pride and sharp implements is inevitably an \nincendiary mix in whatever era!\n\nThomas\n\n-- \n\nWhatever you Wanadoo:\nhttp://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/\n\nThis email has been checked for most known viruses - find out more at: http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm\n\n"
