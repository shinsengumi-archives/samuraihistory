But the\n&gt;  answer to her question is no, people didn&#39;t use these,\n&gt;  generally speaking, ever. One example doesn&#39;t disprove\n&gt;  that statement.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nResponding late to this;\n\tand the thread has gone other places. Anyway, Nate et al, when I \nmentioned Uesugi it was with the three well publicized koshirae which \nhave good provenance to Kenshin. I said THESE are called \nUesugi-koshirae because it is a CATAGORY of sword, I think you&#39;ll find \nthat when someone as famous as Kenshin adopts this style many others \ndid as well. This is not that rare a thing to see. I refer you all to \nUchi-gatana Koshirae, a catalog from a Tokyo National Museum exhibition \ndrawn from their extensive holdings. There you will find a number of \nexamples contemporary to the age of War. And as someone much more \nknowledgeable than I said on the same subject, &quot;There was no other \nreason to own a sword in the Sengoku period but for fighting.&quot;\n\n-t\n\n\n"
