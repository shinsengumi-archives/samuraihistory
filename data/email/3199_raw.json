Is the \nvirtues that bushido taught the Japanese in 16th and 17th century is \nstill evident in the modern Japanese society? or does it instill \nsome of those teachings in the Japanese but have evolve and adopted \ninto the changes of the modern society. \nI hope you&#39;ll give me some views about it. Your ideas would be \ngreatly appreciated and especially if its coming from people who has \nknowledge about it especially if you are japanses or have relatives \nwho are japanese. Thank you very much.\n\nKaren (Phils.)\n\n\n"
