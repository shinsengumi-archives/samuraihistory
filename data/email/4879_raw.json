I&#39;ve got three translations of _Book of Five\nRings_ on my shelves, as the Harris translation I found in the &#39;70s only\nwhetted my appetite for a better understanding.  (I come from a family of\nlinguists, and I always prefer to compare translations on any work that\nreally matters to me - _Beowulf_, the _Tao Te Ching_, the _Mabinogi_, and\nMusashi, for instance - in order to penetrate a little further into a given\nsource work than one translator can ever achieve.)  If I were ever to study\nJapanese, it would mostly be so I could read Musashi in the original.\nNow Cleary&#39;s been translating some works I value - Soho&#39;s _Unfettered Mind_,\nthe Yagyu _Heiho Kaden Sho_ (although he leaves out the incredibly valuable\nillustrations, which is... weird), and - of course - _Five Rings_.  So I&#39;d\nbe very grateful if anyone could let me know if there&#39;s a problem with his\ntranslations that I ought to know about.  This one seems to me to be quite a\nbit like Harris&#39;s, a little clearer on some points and a little less so on\nothers.\nI&#39;d also be grateful if anyone can tell me of a literal,\ncharacter-by-character translation of Musashi&#39;s work.  The one I have of the\n_Tao Te Ching_ in that style is by far the most illuminating I&#39;ve seen, as\nit makes sense of all the variations one finds in the other translations.\n(One English word beneath this character, seven words beneath the next - it\ncaptures the nuances in a way that makes a good deal of sense, and helps me\nto understand the logic patterns in the parent language.)\nFor that matter, are there any books available of his artwork?  I suspect\nthat Inagaki uses one of his statues in the opening credits of &quot;Duel at\nGanryu Island,&quot; but I&#39;m not sure.  And the pictures in Harris&#39;s translation,\nof course, are only black-and-white.  If he had a serious body of artwork,\nI&#39;d be very interested to get a closer look at it.\n\nNow Harris gives a capsule biography of Musashi which is (I believe) about\nall we really know about him.  Yet Yoshikawa&#39;s melodrama of his life (and\nthe Inagaki film adaptation), expand on that to so vast a degree that I\nwonder to what extent they represent the novelist&#39;s fancy, and to what\nextent they represent legitimate folk tradition.  For example, I understand\nthat the tale of his meeting with the jo stylist - whose name escapes me at\nthe moment - is actual tradition:  but is it history?  And am I even correct\nin my understanding that it&#39;s actual tradition?\nThis list is the first place I&#39;ve come across a group of people sufficiently\ninformed that I thought I might find some answers I could trust on the\nsubject.  Thank you all for your attention.\n\tGereg\n\n\n\n\n"
