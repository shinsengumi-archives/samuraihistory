And your insights on the \nsamurai/ninja relationships are debatable but very good.  I enjoyed \nyou input and will lokk for the book.  Unfortunately, sometimes when \nyou post a message other people seem to forget that there are many of \nus who may be interested in you opinion.  Even if it doesn&#39;t serve \nthe specific purpose of an individual.\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Davidson &lt;thomas@t...&gt;\n&quot; &lt;thomas@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have just reread &quot;Sahashi Jingoro&quot; by Mori Ogai, and a \n&gt; surprising thought sprang to mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Without giving the story away, Jingoro, a samurai in the \n&gt; service of the Tokugawa, flees after an incident in which \n&gt; another samurai is killed. His brother requests an interview \n&gt; with Ieyasu and explains the details, asking forgiveness and \n&gt; that Jingoro might return.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ieyasu observes that whilst it is understandable, it cannot be \n&gt; allowed to pass. However, if Jingoro would perform a service \n&gt; for Ieyasu, then he might consider it. The service is the \n&gt; assassination of a Amari Shirasaburo, a Takeda vassal holding \n&gt; Koyama castle in Totomi Province and a thorn in Ieyasu&#39;s side. \n&gt; Ieyasu wanted possession of Koyama.\n&gt; \n&gt; A tall order, but examining the clues I have shortlisted this:\n&gt; \n&gt; Jingoro, we are told, was famous for his martial skills;\n&gt; He was an accomplished flautist;\n&gt; He was an excellent shot with the arquebus;\n&gt; His opponent in an argument drew his sword, but Jingoro struck \n&gt; and killed him with a single blow that left no visible mark \n&gt; upon the body.\n&gt; \n&gt; All in all - quite a talent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jingoro enters the service of Amari, woos him with his flute \n&gt; playing, and when they are alone together, kills him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ninja? Or simply a samurai with useful shinobi skills?\n&gt; \n&gt; Whatever, the garrison of Koyama did not surrender so the death of\n&gt; Amari achieved nothing of significance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, Jingoro returned to Hamamatsu, but did not stay \n&gt; long. When it was suggested he accompany an envoy to Kyoto, \n&gt; Ieyasu declined. &quot;I don&#39;t want him out of my sight. I have \n&gt; heard that Amari loved him like a son,&quot; Ieyasu said, &quot;yet the \n&gt; cruel fellow killed him in his sleep.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a clue to the role and relationship of the samurai to \n&gt; the ninja. I do believe that most samurai, if they possessed \n&gt; the aptitude, developed shinobi-nin training and were entirely \n&gt; capable of the exploits usually accredited to the ninja.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Ieyasu odered his son to commit seppuku, Hattori Hanzo, \n&gt; his celebrated ninja master, was sent to make sure the act was \n&gt; carried out. At the last, even Hanzo could not bring himself to \n&gt; act as kaishaku (second) knowing the man was innocent. Another \n&gt; samurai took his place and struck off Nobuyasu&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later, Ieyasu was heard to say, &quot;even that devil Hanzo could \n&gt; not bring himself to kill my son,&quot; at which point this samurai \n&gt; decided life would be safer elsewhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem being, once they have proved themselves skilled in \n&gt; the arts of deception, they themselves are never quite trusted \n&gt; again, even by their masters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, I reckon most daimyo could find willing volunteers \n&gt; from among their own ranks for suicide missions, without having \n&gt; to resort to employing untrustworthy outsiders.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ieyasu and others did employ ninja, but I reckon it was for the \n&gt; more mundane and time-consuming operations of surveillance and \n&gt; information gathering, the day-to-day donkeywork of military \n&gt; intelligence, rather than the fantastic feats of fiction we \n&gt; read about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n\n\n"
