Y=\r\nou truly have a treasure in your \n      possession.  The first thing that c=\r\nould suggest is to have it\n      professionally \n      cleaned and/or polis=\r\nhed.  The fittings that currently exist on the\n    blade\n\n      mean little=\r\n in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to\n    get\n      it \n=\r\n      cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.\n=\r\n        Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.\n  Profession=\r\nal\n\n      polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take =\r\ntwo\n      years \n      and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is wo=\r\nrth it.  It will\n      keep \n      any rust currently on the blade from cau=\r\nsing any more damage.\n        I hope this helped you.\n\n\n      Peace,\n\n     =\r\n Matt\n\n      ______________________________________________________________=\r\n___\n      The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \n      h=\r\nttp://join.msn.com/?page=3Dfeatures/junkmail\n\n\n\n      Samurai Archives: htt=\r\np://www.samurai-archives.com\n      ---\n      To unsubscribe from this group=\r\n, send an email to:\n      samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n   =\r\n   Your use of Yahoo!
