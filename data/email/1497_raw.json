I&#39;m\nwriting a samurai legend and I&#39;m still looking on the\nInternet and I can&#39;t find what I&#39;m looking for, were\nthere samurai that had legends written about them?&quot;\n\nHi Andrea\n\nThere are several excellent books and sources regarding legends. For a start try &quot;The Nobility of Failure&quot; - Ivan Morris: this work chronicles several personalities from the 4th - 20th centuries. Maybe even &quot;Musashi&quot; - Eiji Yoshikawa: An epic novel of the samurai era {so its blurb states..} Or even look at some of the Japanese Woodcuts, such as those of Kuniyoshi to find legend topics.\nGood luck with the writing....\n\n                                    Rod  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
