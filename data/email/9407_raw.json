It is a Takeda-written work, so be wary of that if you take that route.\n\n=\r\nIf you want English sources, then the easiest thing to do would be to get t=\r\nhe Osprey books on each individual battle (Kawanakajima 1553-64, for exampl=\r\ne), or the two volume set dedicated to samurai warlords. They are inexpensi=\r\nve and easy to read. Not only that but they are highly concentrated with in=\r\nformation, maps, illustrations, etc.\n\nThere are also other sources if you a=\r\nre interested in digging. There are scattered passages about Kenshin and Sh=\r\ningen in works relating to Nobunaga, such as the piece in Japan Before Toku=\r\ngawa and, of course, Japonius Tyrannus. Sansom&#39;s A History of Japan 1334-16=\r\n15 may also be of use.\n\nThose are just some ideas...\n\nJonathan P.
