I will check with Bottomley and Hopson.\n\nI just wanted to add, if the Seppuku topic is still relevant, that Paul Schrader has directed a film called &#39;Mishima&#39; (produced by Francis F. Coppola and George-star-wars-Lucas). It revolves exactly around the drama in the military base, but also re-enacts three of his novel/plays, in an attempt to give a broader sense of his character, his sexual tendencies, and vision. It is wonderfully and very artistically done, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in this writer. I would gladly discuss this more, though I don&#39;t want to veer off-topic of...Samurai History!\n\nThank you, Gillian, for your kind invitation! I read as much as my brain assimilates (never enough!) although I know in advance that as a non-Japanese, or as an outsider to any investigated culture, I must pay the outmost respect, and be aware that any attempt to encompass it in its entirety will be lacking. Therefore, I (others can differ) must address this culture from the only point of view available to me, which is the outsider&#39;s.\n\nRami\n\n&gt;Did you not see it? I approved it, and it came through\n&gt;my email, so I saw it, but if other people are having\n&gt;a problem, please let me know so I can try to figure\n&gt;it out. Another poster didn&#39;t seem to see an answer I\n&gt;had given him, so maybe there is an issue. Like I said\n&gt;I got your original post, but short of telling you to\n&gt;read Bottomley and Hopson (and as far as I can tell,\n&gt;you already know everything they&#39;d be able to tell\n&gt;you), there&#39;s nothing I can contribute. \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
