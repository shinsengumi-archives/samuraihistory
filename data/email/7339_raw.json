Since his passing in 1998, the Criterion\n&gt; Collection has \n&gt; done a superb job reissuing some of his most\n&gt; cherished works \n&gt; including those mentioned above, as well as Red\n&gt; Beard, Throne of \n&gt; Blood, Stray Dog, Sanjuro, Yojimbo and High and Low.\n&gt; Most recently \n&gt; the Criterion Collection has released a double disc\n&gt; version of \n&gt; Kurosawa&#39;s 1980 film Kagemusha. \n&gt; \n&gt; Although the film was plagued with delays during\n&gt; production, it \n&gt; still remains as one of Kurosawa&#39;s most poignant\n&gt; works and is given \n&gt; an overdue, brilliant treatment on this reissue. \n&gt; \n&gt; In 1968, Kurosawa collaborated with Japanese\n&gt; directors Masaki \n&gt; Kobayashi, Kon Ichikawa and Keisuke Kinoshita to\n&gt; form the Yonki-no-\n&gt; kai company. The company&#39;s only film, Dodes&#39;ka-Den,\n&gt; released in 1970 \n&gt; was a commercial failure. This event, in conjunction\n&gt; with his \n&gt; decision to leave the set of the disastrous Tora!\n&gt; Tora! Tora!, sent \n&gt; Kurosawa into a deep depression. His depression\n&gt; culminated in an \n&gt; attempted suicide in December of 1971. \n&gt; \n&gt; However, three years later Mosfilm (the Soviet\n&gt; national film \n&gt; production bureau) commissioned Kurosawa to make\n&gt; Dersu Uzala, which \n&gt; went on to win the 1976 Academy Award for Best\n&gt; Foreign Film. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regardless, Kurosawa still lacked the funding for he\n&gt; needed to make \n&gt; Kagemusha due to the failure of Dodes&#39;ka-Den.\n&gt; \n&gt; To relieve the frustration of this situation,\n&gt; Kurosawa began \n&gt; painting furiously again. As a young man, Kurosawa\n&gt; had originally \n&gt; been a painter within the Japan Proletariat Artists\n&gt; Group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Contemporary German Expressionism, Soviet Realism\n&gt; and French Avant-\n&gt; Garde influenced his work as a painter. His\n&gt; paintings and \n&gt; storyboards (some of which are featured in the\n&gt; 48-page booklet \n&gt; packaged with Kagemusha) have characteristic\n&gt; calligraphic lines and \n&gt; bold primary colors. Kurosawa cites political\n&gt; pressure against \n&gt; artists and liberal writers, needing to find a\n&gt; dependable livelihood \n&gt; and the suicide of his brother as the three factors\n&gt; that made him \n&gt; switch from painting to film.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kurosawa learned film under Yamamoto Kajiro, a\n&gt; relationship he \n&gt; describes more like that of an elder and younger\n&gt; brother rather than \n&gt; an apprenticeship. \n&gt; \n&gt; It was based on these brilliant storyboards for\n&gt; Kagemusha that \n&gt; Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas (huge admirers\n&gt; of Kurosawa&#39;s \n&gt; work) approached Kurosawa about helping him fund the\n&gt; project. \n&gt; \n&gt; Essentially the funding for Kagemusha was garnered\n&gt; from the success \n&gt; of Lucas&#39; first Star Wars film, as well as Coppola&#39;s\n&gt; first two \n&gt; Godfather installments and Apocalypse Now. \n&gt; \n&gt; Production for Kagemusha began in 1979 and was\n&gt; plagued by an \n&gt; argument Kurosawa had with lead actor Katsu Shintaro\n&gt; who demanded \n&gt; that his own personal camera crew be allowed on the\n&gt; set to keep a \n&gt; video record of his work. Nakadai Tatsuya replaced\n&gt; Shintaro and \n&gt; Kagemusha was ready to be transformed from static\n&gt; paintings into \n&gt; living, breathing film.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kurosawa describes Kagemusha as a medieval samurai\n&gt; drama loosely \n&gt; based on ideas in Shakespeare&#39;s King Lear. Kurosawa\n&gt; had already \n&gt; successfully translated Macbeth in his Throne of\n&gt; Blood film and \n&gt; Hamlet in The Bad Sleep Well. He would later more\n&gt; fully adapt King \n&gt; Lear in his 1985 film Ran. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kurosawa made Kagemusha about the historical\n&gt; character of Shingen \n&gt; Takeda that would have to display different faces in\n&gt; different \n&gt; situations. \n&gt; \n&gt; Historically, Shingen was known to use many\n&gt; kagemusha, or doubles, \n&gt; so that he could avoid surprise attacks. In the\n&gt; film, Shingen uses \n&gt; his brother Nobukado as a double, as well as a\n&gt; ruffian from the \n&gt; streets who looks uncannily like him. (Skip to next\n&gt; paragraph to \n&gt; avoid SPOILERS). \n&gt; \n&gt; After Shingen dies, his brother refuses to continue\n&gt; impersonating \n&gt; him. Having been so affected by Shingen as a person,\n&gt; the thief \n&gt; agrees to continue impersonating him in order to\n&gt; keep the Takeda \n&gt; clan alive. \n&gt; \n&gt; However, the family of Shingen begins to notice that\n&gt; the thief is \n&gt; not truly their warlord and expel him from the clan.\n&gt; Later in time, \n&gt; the thief is forced to watch the Takeda clan fall to\n&gt; Nobunaga and \n&gt; his Tokugawa clan as they ignore the advice of\n&gt; Shingen and \n&gt; strategist Sun Zi: &quot;Swift as the wind, as silent as\n&gt; the forest, as \n&gt; sweeping as fire, as immovable as the mountain.&quot;\n&gt; Kurosawa sees this \n&gt; as historically fascinating because Japan would have\n&gt; been a much \n&gt; different place had Shingen and the Takeda clan\n&gt; gained control of \n&gt; Kyoto. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kurosawa&#39;s writing process always involved two or\n&gt; three partners, \n&gt; but he &quot;always left the translation of prose scenes\n&gt; into images to \n&gt; himself.&quot; Since Kurosawa began losing his eyesight\n&gt; around this time, \n&gt; his use of illustrated storyboards greatly aided him\n&gt; in \n&gt; communicating how he wanted Kagemusha to look. \n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps his most visually stunning film, Kagemusha\n&gt; uses brilliantly \n&gt; colored fabrics of blood reds and fiery yellows. In\n&gt; a dream \n&gt; sequence, Kurosawa&#39;s use of black lights, Day-Glo\n&gt; paints, surreal \n&gt; terrain, otherworldly backdrops and eerie\n&gt; reflections makes for one \n&gt; of the most visually stunning scenes in film\n&gt; history.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a Tony Rayns interview with Kurosawa, the\n&gt; director shares how he \n&gt; feels about young directors in the Japanese film\n&gt; industry. \n&gt; \n&gt; He explains that although these young &quot;indie&quot;\n&gt; directors are limited \n&gt; by budget, they try to make their films abrasive to\n&gt; attract an \n&gt; audience. \n&gt; \n&gt; However, Kurosawa believes that a director should\n&gt; always make a film \n&gt; to attract as large an audience as possible, while\n&gt; sacrificing none \n&gt; of his or her artistic vision. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is in this way that Kagemusha succeeds so well.\n&gt; It is an \n&gt; accessible film with an engaging story based on true\n&gt; history and \n&gt; beautiful cinematography to boot.
