I \nhave been fascinated by Samurai history since the age of 8 and have \nbuilt a collection of books and information on Japanese history, But \nI have not as yet managed to visit Japan..\n My question is; I recently read that prior to the Kamakura era \n(around 900-1000ad) the early Samurai clans fought wars against the \nAinu (presumably) and that a weapon used was a primitive design of \nCrossbow.. Does anyone know why this method fell into disuse by the \ntime of the Gempei wars and was replaced by the Longbow?\n\n\n\n"
