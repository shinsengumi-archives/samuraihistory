And they can have their own =\r\ncastles too?\n&gt; \n&gt; What about Takeda of Kai? He had the kuni all to himself?=\r\n!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Francois BOUTRY wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; From 1336 up to about 1500/1520, each kuni had a leading daimyo : the shu=\r\ngo (see the list in Grossberg&#39;s Japan&#39;s Renaissance). \n&gt; &gt; The shugo title =\r\nappears almost up to 1570 but, in most cases, it is an empty one during the=\r\n XVIth century and a kuni belongs either to one or to several Sengoku daimy=\r\no who do not possess the shugo title i.e Mino to Sait=C3=83=C2=B4 and Izumo=\r\n to Amako but Shinano, Mikawa, Harima or Aki to several warrior families. T=\r\nhere are some exceptions : the Shimazu, shugo of Satsuma and =C3=83&quot;sumi, t=\r\nhe Takeda, shugo of Kai or the Imagawa, shugo of Suruga\n&gt; &gt; To take another=\r\n example : Etch=C3=83=C2=BB and Noto are officially under two members (shug=\r\no) of the Hatakeyama family but, in fact, the first province is splitted be=\r\ntween various vassals of the Hatakeyama among which the leading familiers a=\r\nre the Jimb=C3=83=C2=B4 and the Shiina. Similarly, in Noto, the leading fam=\r\nilies, among others, are the Ch=C3=83=C2=B4 and the Yusa.\n&gt; &gt; Hope I have b=\r\neen usefull\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message du 07/11/10 20:39\n&gt; &gt; &gt; De : &quot;kono=\r\nhawolfie&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A : samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Copie =C3=83 : \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Objet : [samuraihistory] Simple Sengoku Daimyo Question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Just a simple question about daimyo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So each province/kuni ha=\r\nd their own leading daimyo, or the kuni functioned as a family base...\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Like the Uesugi has Echigyo, Tokugawa has Mikawa, Rokkaku had Omi.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since the kuni are large and are split into districts, did th=\r\ne Samurai clans have a leader in each district to spread their influence? \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Like, Kenshin could live at his castle (not sure where) in one=\r\n distict and the others can be ruled by his loyal retainers?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nr did a province had just one single daimyo leader?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n[Non-text =\r\nportions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
