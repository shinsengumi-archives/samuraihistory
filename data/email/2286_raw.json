You therefore\ncontrol more people. Losers who don&#39;t die need someone\nto work for, why not go with the winner? Nobunaga\nabsorbed many of his enemies troops/leaders. When you\nlook at the land he controlled in 1560 vs 1575, it&#39;s\neasy to see how his army would have grown. \n\nFor instance, in 1560 he defeated Imagawa--many of\nthose Imagawa forces split and followed his ally\nTokugawa Ieyasu, who had been under Imagawa control.\nIn 1568 (?) He took Mino from the Saito, and absorbed\nmost of their retainers. As he continued, he followed\nthis pattern. In 1560 it&#39;s doubtful anyone such as\nMatsunaga Hisahide, Takayama Ukon, Bessho Nagaharu,\nAraki Murashige, Ukita Naoie, etc., would ever have\ngiven Nobunaga the time of day, but all at some time\nwere under his control (though not all stayed that\nway). \n\nNate\n\n--- Edwin Angulo &lt;mayalan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt;  \n&gt; I got a question regarding nobunaga�s army size.\n&gt;  \n&gt; We al know that in 1560 Nobunaga�s men were about\n&gt; 3,000, but in subsequent battles their numbers\n&gt; increased, (30,000 in Nagashino for example); How\n&gt; did Nobunaga managed to increase their army that\n&gt; way?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; Edwin Angulo.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; The New Yahoo!
