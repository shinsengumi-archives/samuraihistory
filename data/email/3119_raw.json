Apparently Kenshin not only killed the\nsoldi=\r\ner but\ncut his matchlock barrel so well that the sword was named as such.  =\r\nI\nrecall the\nsword was an O-Kanehira??  So a gun barrel has been cut in at =\r\nleast one\ndocumented historical event.  If the gun was an &quot;udon-ju&quot; this is=\r\n more\neasily\naccepted than a WW2 machine gun barrel...\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbo=\r\nurne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: David Heller &lt;olasnah@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 14=\r\n, 2004 2:36 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Slicing rifle barrels\n\n\nI =\r\nactually grabbed a screenshot of the movie at that precise moment, and\nthe\n=\r\nbreakage of the rifle does in fact occur behind the action of the rifle,\nso=\r\n no\nbarrel was sliced.\n\nJames Eckman &lt;ronin_engineer@...&gt; wrote:I t=\r\nhink this is the\nequivalent\nof an urban legend more than anything\nelse, loo=\r\nks cool in movies but may never have happened.
