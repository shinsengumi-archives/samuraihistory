It&#39;s a class, not a job description. I\ncould &quot;serve&quot; someone, and still not be a samurai if I\nwasn&#39;t a. born into it or b. in rare cases, promoted\ninto it (i.e. the bakufu basically gives a declaration\nthat such and such person is now a member of the\nsamurai class, and as such has all responsibilities\nand duties associated, and so and so&#39;s descendants\nshall be samurai, etc.). \n\nNate\n\n--- Michael Lorimer &lt;mijalo_jp@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Quite so.  \n&gt; The term &#39;samurai&#39; does not regard simply to those\n&gt; men (and some women) who trained with, and deployed\n&gt; their swords.  The word comes from the kanji meaning\n&gt; literally &#39;to serve&#39;, whether it was the Emperor, a\n&gt; daimyo, or even one of the equally mighty temples. \n&gt; However, upon this point of &#39;to serve&#39;, would you\n&gt; classify the likes of the Miyamoto Musashi as a\n&gt; &#39;samurai&#39; since his carrer with the sword was one\n&gt; essentially without a master?? \n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Mark Arsenault &lt;taisho@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Specifically, the term &quot;samurai&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; not synonymous with \n&gt; &gt; &quot;swordsman&quot; or &quot;one who tries to adhere to\n&gt; Bushido&quot;\n&gt; &gt; or anything similar. \n&gt; &gt; Samurai were a caste, and one that no longer\n&gt; exists.\n&gt; &gt; So in the strict \n&gt; &gt; definition of the term, one cannot &quot;become&quot; a\n&gt; &gt; samurai any more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Point of fact, if you told you&#39;re average Japanese\n&gt; person you were a &quot;samurai&quot;, you&#39;d have them\n&gt; laughing\n&gt; until next week. It just ain&#39;t possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
