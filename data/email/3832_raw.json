Don&#39;t know if\nSamurai that has sold their short sword was allowed to walk without\nWakizashi.\nI know that wood replicas of both sheath and blade actually exists. \nBeing the Edo jidai life of almost all people strictly ruled by laws\ncovering even the little details, I think that even this was in some\nmanner codified, but can&#39;t say anything for sure.\n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: Atisi Kazuari [mailto:broccolihead30@...] \nInviato: domenica 15 febbraio 2004 15.32\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: [samuraihistory] Daito in everyday(constant?) use\n\nI have been turning something over in my mind this last few bedridden \ndays and it&#39;s in reguards to the wearing of the Daisho. Now i know \nthat one was not to wear both into a house or in the presence of a \nsuperior, and they would often be kept on a rack togather.\n\nYet in my recent viewings of non historical mediums,televison, movies\n(many post Kurasawa era films), and even some computer and console \ngames. it is often seen that the Samurai is moving about in daily \nlife with his katana only. (yes i am aware that the fittings or even \nthe entire sword would be diffrent favoring the longer curved blade \nof the tachi.) Just wondering if anyone else had noticed this and if \nit had any real historical backing or just the prop people not \nknowing how to do the knots.\n\n-Atsi\n\n\n\n\n\n"
