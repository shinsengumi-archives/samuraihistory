Can you imagine, what if someone else was taking a dump, the plot would have been discovered and Nobunaga would not have the empire. Or you can just use your own imagination as to how he died. It could have been from stomach cancer or maybe he drank himself into a stupor in the loo and died from alcoholic poisoning. And furthermore, ask this question, how the heck would the ninja known what Kenshin&#39;s backside looked like? Your choice.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: kojalMtirta@... \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, March 01, 2009 10:35 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] uesugi kenshin\n\n\n  Hi everybody..\n  I once read that kenshin died because of serious illness. But lately i read a ninja history book,and in that book they write that a ninja assasinate kenshin while he&#39;s in the loo. Can anybody tell me the true story behind kenshin&#39;s death.\n  Thanks.\n\n\n  -----------------------------------------\n  Sent by emoze push mail\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
