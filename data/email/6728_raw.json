LOL. If\n&gt; you&#39;ve got Japanese fonts installed, mine should have\n&gt; shown up fine under Shift-JIS or Japanese\n&gt; (Auto-Select). Unicode is completely impractical if\n&gt; you actually type in Japanese, which I frequently do\n&gt; (not all that WELL, mind you). Try adjusting your\n&gt; encoding and you&#39;ll see it fine. There was no &quot;tried&quot;\n&gt; there--I did. \n\nI did indeed see the kanji as you typed it after switching to shift-jis \nencoding. The problem there was that I have three possible japanese \nencodings, only one of which displays correctly, plus unicode. 4 checks \njust to get one character... I haven&#39;t been getting enough sleep lately, \nso I&#39;ll just blame it on that.\n\n&gt; Of course, I can also see your entries--I have to go\n&gt; to Unicode to do so, though. And it completely messes\n&gt; up every single webpage for a while. But to answer\n&gt; your question, yes the link you provided is the one I\n&gt; typed. \n\nI copy/pasted my entries from the website. Apparently Thunderbird \nautomatically turned my entire message into utf-8 after that, probably \nbecause the site was in unicode. I have next to no experience typing \njapanese, so I don&#39;t really know what would have happened had I typed it.\n\n-- \nFalc\n\n\n\n\n"
