Again, never defended him as a paragon of\nresearch or academic virtue. \n\n I agree, it is VERY\n&gt; nice having this information in English, but I also\n&gt; DEFINITELY agree that I would be very wary of using\n&gt; any of his books as a source without corroboration\n&gt; from another source.\n&gt; \n\nYep. That&#39;s why I said it. He&#39;s a good place to\nSTART--but we should all realize that no author is\never free from mistakes 100% of the time. Just because\nyou read it in Turnbull or whomever, doesn&#39;t make it\ncorrect, necessarily. It should be cross-checked and\nverified elsewhere. \n\nI STILL stand by my point that I&#39;d rather someone\nmistake the date of a battle because they read it\nseveral times in incorrect Turnbull editions than to\ngo off reading half the crap about ninja and samurai\nthat people THINK is real. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; I can think of at least one website, too!  ;)~\n&gt; \n\nWhen did they start selling websites in B. Dalton&#39;s?\nLOL\n\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t matter, but my impression\n&gt; was at least at first he wasn&#39;t associated with any\n&gt; university and essentially was an independent.\n\nThat&#39;s my impression also. That he was an independent,\nand then got associated with some Univ as an outside\nexpert. My main problem with Turnbull is that he&#39;s\nfull of himself--I think it&#39;s great to have the info\nin English and accesible, but when he does the above\nmentioned things and tries to pass it off as his great\noriginal research...\n\nAnyways, I&#39;ll see your tuppence and raise you 10 yen.\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"
