Were females of samurai households recognized as\n&gt; members of the samurai \n&gt; &gt;class and expected and required to conduct\n&gt; themselves in distinctive and \n&gt; &gt;&quot;honorable&quot; ways? Absolutely. There was even a\n&gt; recognized female counterpart \n&gt; &gt;to seppuku, involving use of the short (shortest)\n&gt; sword to sever the jugular. \n&gt; &gt;And in certain cases female members of the samurai\n&gt; class could perform \n&gt; &gt;distinctly military functions.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this may be the same thing that you are\n&gt; talking about Will, \n&gt; but there were also women who fulfilled some of the\n&gt; administrative \n&gt; duties of samurai, in places/for jobs that men were\n&gt; not appropriate. \n&gt; For instance security for the various facilities\n&gt; where female members \n&gt; of a samurai household led their daily lives. One of\n&gt; these roles was \n&gt; the o-Hi-no-Ban. ��Ф���.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you say, this is not exactly the same as &quot;being a\n&gt; female samurai&quot; \n&gt; in the sense that the original poster probably\n&gt; meant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another possible angle for this question is &quot;did\n&gt; women engage in \n&gt; combat&quot; or &quot;were women trained to fight&quot;. The\n&gt; accepted wisdom of \n&gt; today is that women of the samurai class were\n&gt; trained to fight with \n&gt; the naginata. as a last line of defence. The notion\n&gt; being that they \n&gt; might be the only ones left to fight in case the\n&gt; enemy soldiers broke \n&gt; into the castle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally I am not familiar with whether or not\n&gt; that is reality. To \n&gt; me it has the feel of legend. I&#39;ve only ever read or\n&gt; heard about it in \n&gt; the sort of vaguely self-assured way that is usually\n&gt; the way \n&gt; &quot;common wisdom&quot; is talked about. I&#39;d love to learn\n&gt; about either \n&gt; actual training programs that existed, or actual\n&gt; cases where the women \n&gt; picked up their naginata and fought as a group.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Jay Kelly\n&gt; oyakata@...\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
