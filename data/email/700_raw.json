The classic idea of Ninja however was \na recent image that was most commonly used in the Kabuki plays of Tokugawa \nJapan from around 1700 onwards..Ninja were called by many various names, some \nof those including; Kusa (Meaning &#39;grass&#39; ...was used by the Hojo clan to \ndescribe the men), Iga no Mono meaning &#39;Men of Iga province&#39; was a general \nterm for the warriors from Iga that could perform Ninja activities, Shinobi \nmeant those using the Ninjutsu techniques either in infiltration or spying \nactivities or in battle. Indeed there are many terms for those men/women used \nas Ninja by the warlords...Further &#39;proof&#39; if you need it is the existence of \n&#39;Ninjutsu&#39; techniques still contained in the syllabus of the oldest Japanese \nMartial art school the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu which took form in \nthe 14th century and still contains the espionage teachings in its \ncurriculum...And then there are the teachings used in Ryuha like the Bujinkan \nand Genbukan Ninpo Bugei that are said to be far older than the 1600&#39;s in \ntheir history...\n There is NO doubt that men using &#39;Ninjutsu&#39; were used in Japan..The \nhistories written at the time contain mention of them also. The only real \n&#39;debate&#39; here is whether to accept the modern idea of Ninja as the black clad \nsuper magician killer spies..This is however a very recent role given the \nNinja to promote better audience attendance at Theatres in Japan and this \ntranslated well into modern film and television...Ninja are described as \nSamurai in the war tales..They wear the clothing that would help them to \nblend in and not be noticed by their enemy..They are often described as \nexpert guides to the forests they lived in and are used as such by warlords \nin the tales..They possess knowledge of infiltration tactics and battle \ntactics that were required to win the battles or sieges they helped \nwith..However they are most often called Samurai and I believe that it is \nmost likely that a majority of them were men of great prestige in their own \ncommunities...leaders of men that commanded a force large enough to be a \ngreat help to those they supported.\n Even the books written by these so-called &#39;Ninja&#39; are dated as being from \nthe 17th century and at that time the term Ninja was in use by the authors of \nsuch books as the &#39;Bansenshukai&#39;, and &#39;Ninpiden&#39; for example, This proves \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that there WERE those who accepted the name and \ntitle of Ninja.\n Hope this helps to clear you on a few points..\n websites to visit on this are; www.genbukan.com, www.ninjutsu.com, \nwww.e-budo.com, or the best one at www.ninpo.org\n Have fun.\n Abayo.\n Ben Sharples.\n\n"
