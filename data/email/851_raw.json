The ono i have is mounted on a\napprox. 5ft pole, per orional specs and it is\nprohibitively heavy. for those who dont know me,,, im\nnot exactly small at 5&#39; 11&quot; and 300 lbs and i find it\nexcedingly too heavy to use well.   it would be\nexcellent in destoying  wooden structures as your\nsource mentions. but i  personally would never take it\non an open battlefield. its only application there i\ncan think of would be to give it to relatively\nuntrained men figuring that if they do hit something\nskill, placement or knowledge will have little to do\nwith it so just do maximum damage. and you can guess\nhow well that would work.\nthe masakari ive seen seem to be more odf a standard\none handed axe with a long back spike. not my favorite\ntype of weapon but practical.\n--kiyohara\n--- Tom Helm &lt;toryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; iganokami wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never seen or heard of it, but does anyone\n&gt; know if any type of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; battle axe was utilized in Japan during the\n&gt; sengoku period?\n&gt; \n&gt; From The Katchu Bugu Jiten by Sasama Yoshihiko;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Masakari also read etsu. When used for battle it\n&gt; was called Masakari or\n&gt; fuetsu (big axe) when used for wood cutting, ono.\n&gt; \n&gt;     The name (reading) masakari some believe comes\n&gt; from the similar sounding\n&gt; &quot;ma saki wari&quot; or &quot;cuts dead straight&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; In ancient China an &quot;ono&quot; was presented by rulers to\n&gt; their lead generals as a\n&gt; symbol of their commision to subdue enemy forces...\n&gt; \n&gt; They were used to break down obstalces, bamboo\n&gt; fences and stakes, or to attack\n&gt; the walls and gates of fortifications. (He places\n&gt; them as Kamakura period\n&gt; weapons-tch)\n&gt; \n&gt; The kogata masakari had a 3 or 4 shaku handle with a\n&gt; 3 sun wide blade\n&gt; \n&gt; The Omasakari had a 1shaku blade.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are mentioned in the Taikeiki and other old\n&gt; chronicles...\n&gt; \n&gt; ( I have seen these illustrated but never seen an\n&gt; actual &quot;masakari&quot; in any\n&gt; museum. There is a book on weapons that should have\n&gt; at least one example but I\n&gt; can&#39;t seem to locate it-tch)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
