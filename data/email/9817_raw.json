I knew that the dailect was very old and has =\r\n\n&gt; changed in meaning or is forgotten. Also people said that it could \n&gt; be=\r\n Chinese. I have a answer to your question (probaly with some \n&gt; embelishme=\r\nnt) about the pull strength. It was problay about 20 \n&gt; pounds stronger tha=\r\nn when the yumi was refined and made with the \nsame \n&gt; care as a sword i.e =\r\nweight and balance to the person and the like. \n&gt; But &quot;history&quot; shows of a =\r\nsamurai named Minamoto no Tametomo. He was \n&gt; a very large and powerful man=\r\n. They said that He ultimately \nprovoked \n&gt; the central government into sen=\r\nding an armada of twenty small \n&gt; warships in an attempt to force him to pa=\r\ny. As a gesture of \n&gt; defience, Tametomo decided to shoot a large, bulbed a=\r\nrrow over the \n&gt; bow of one of the ships, but it struck the wooden hull a f=\r\new inches \n&gt; above the waterline instead. The shot was so powerful that the=\r\n \narrow \n&gt; penetrated both sides of the vessel, creating two gaping holes. =\r\nSea \n&gt; water poured in and the ship began to sink. The sight of the \nwarshi=\r\np \n&gt; being sunk by a single arrow so frightened the other ships&#39; \ncaptains =\r\n\n&gt; that they retreated. That was what Japanese history said anyway. \n&gt; Agai=\r\nn thank you for helping me.
