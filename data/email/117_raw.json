They have been airing them since 1963. Most of them are 50 episodes long, 45minutes a piece, though the opening and closing are usually a bit longer. They generally air from January to December here in Japan. A condensed version is often aired at the end of the year. As far as I have known only two dramas have been repeated, Ruyuku no Kaze and Takeda Shingen\n\n1963 Hana no Shogai (II Naosuke) note this one aired from April to December\n1964 Ako Roshi (The 47 Ronin story)\n1965 Taiko Ki (Hideyoshi)\n1966 Minamoto Yoshitsune *\n1967 San Shimai (A fictional story set in the Meiji Period)\n1968 Ryoma ga Yuku (Sakamoto Ryoma)\n1969 Ten to Chi ( Takeda Shingen vs Uesugi Kenshin)\n1970 Mominoki wa Nokotta (Harada Kai) *\n1971 Haru no Sakamichi (Yagyu Jubei)\n1972 Shin Heike Monogatari *\n1973 Kunitori Monogatari (Saito Dosan) *\n1974 Katsu Kaishu\n1975 Genroku Taiheiki (The 47 Ronin story again) *\n1976 Kaze to Kumo to Niji to (Taira Masakado) *\n1977 Kashin (Choshu han in the Bakumatsu period) *\n1978 Ougon no Hibi ( something about Sakai traders in the Philipines in the Sengoku period)*\n1979 Kusa Moeru (Hojo Masako) *\n1980 Shi shi no jidai (Aizu wakamatsu in the Bakamatsu/Meiji period) *\n1981 Onna Taiko Ki (Hideyoshi & his wife Nene) *\n1982 Toge no Gunzo (More of the 47 Ronin Story)*\n1983 Tokugawa Ieyasu *\n1984 Sanga Moyu (Fictional story set during WWII)\n1985 Haru no Hato (Fictional story set in Taisho period)\n1986 Inochi (Fictional story set in postwar period)\n1987 Date Masamune *\n1988 Takeda Shingen *\n1989 Kasuga Tsubone *\n1990 Tobu ga Gotoku (Saigo Takamori & Okubo Toshimichi) *\n1991 Taiheiki (Nanboku cho period) *\n1992 Nobunaga *\n1993 Ruyuku no Kaze (Okinawa at the start of the Edo period/ This drama was only for six months)\n1993-94 Homura tatsu (Three generations of the Oshu Fujiwara) This drama aired from July 93 to March 94\n1994 Hana no Ran (Onin no Ran) This drama aired from April to December\n1995 Hachi Dai Shogun Yoshimune *\n1996 Hideyoshi\n1997 Mori Motonari *\n1998 Tokugawa Yoshinobu\n1999 Genroku Ryoran (Yet again the 47 ronins)\n2000 Aoi Tokugawa Sandai (the first 3 Tokugawa Shoguns) * (Its actually the first episode which is a condensation of the first 15 episodes)\n2001 Hojo Tokimune\n2002 Toshie to Matsu (Maeda Toshie and his wife)\n\nThe ones I asterixed are available in condensed versions from NHK video http://www.ntkr.co.jp/foa/ . Mind you they are of course in Japanese and they are frightfully expensive. The Takeda Shingen one for example is five cassettes and cost 37,800 yen (I guess about $400). I don&#39;t know where one would find them for sale with english subtitles. Tokugawa Ieyasu is available in its complete form 26 cassettes, astronomical price. NHK also does other historical dramas usually during new year along with many other stations here in Japan. Though recently they have become quite scarce. I have managed to copy about 133 different titles of samurai /historical dramas on video. This info came from the Japanese magazine TV Guide (Gaido). They publish a guide book to each series every year.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
