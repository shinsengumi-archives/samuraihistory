I wondered if anyone knows the \ndifference between the Japanese and European versions, besides the \nlanguage. I have found this website. It is excellent \nhttp://shogun23.hypermart.net/index2.htm please click on the 2nd \nkanji from left then find the units and building pages, is it me or \nare the units different. There is a unit called the father visitor, \nbizarre. I wonder if It realtes to a Jesuit father? historically \naccurate. Plus there are 5 types of castles etc. I am confused \ngreatly. If anyone knows can you message back. I wanted to post this \nquestion on the totalwar.org board but I cant get it work, also if \nanyone knows about this? Last thing I will say I really enjoy total \nwar it is an excellent game, it has I am sure done a great service to \nJapanese history interest. It is reasonably historically accurate, \nStephen Turnbull helped on it, it is one thing I would compliment him \nfor. Now the Medieval version is out on the 30th in the UK I can&#39;t \nwait. But even though it supposedly rocks, I would have preferred \nmore on the sengoku Jidai, perhaps, all throughout Japans history. We \nshould not forget shogun, now it&#39;s European cousin is around, Me for \none will be loyal, well until the 30th anyroad! ohh well I can dream, \nit will happen one day we all know. Ok then, my next post will be \nmore historical, perhaps, possibly on Japanese mercaneries in India? \nhmmmm, \n\nAll the best then Mark \n\n\n\n\n"
