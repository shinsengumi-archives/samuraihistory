My \nassumption is that it is die-cast - it is not a hand-made work of \nAsian art ;)  but makes a good display piece nonetheless.  You&#39;ll \nfind photos of it on the auction page.  It measures 8 inches across \nat the base, and about 7 inches tall, and is fairly heavy.  It was \ngiven to me about 10 years ago, and my guess is that it may be around \n20 years old.  It is in good condition, although some tarnishing is \nvisible on the prongs.  Anyway, take a look if you&#39;re interested, or \nfeel free to ignore it, and keep in mind that Yahoo is very good at \nbreaking up html links, so will very likely have to cut and paste the \nlink into your browser: \n\nhttp://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/ts/exchange-\nglance/Y04X5643157X8457083/104-1722911-9837545\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n"
