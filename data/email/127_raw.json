It seems to\n&gt; have \n&gt; remained a frighteningly effective weapon in Europe\n&gt; right up to the mechanised era.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nHey, that&#39;s what the Cav is for...taking the glory\nwhile those poor grunts get the heck pounded out of\nthem! \n\nAs far as why the U.S. Cavalry never took up the\nlance, I&#39;m not entirely sure. I would never claim to\nbe an expert on cavalry history, though I am trying to\nlearn as much as possible (I&#39;m reading a great book\nright now, The Horse in Warfare...pretty good). I do\nknow that U.S. Cav historically has fought more as\ndragoons than as anything else...probably because in\nthe Revolutionary War that was the easiest\norganization for a militia to maintain, and warfare on\nthe North American continent has never really been\nconducive to the grand cavalry battles as in Europe.\nBy the time the U.S. embroiled itself in conflicts\n(The Mexican War, U.S. Civil War) firepower had caught\nup with mobility and charges into the guns were not\nadvisable for cavalry or infantry. Mostof the U.S.\nArmy&#39;s 19th century combat (except for 1812-14,\n1846-48, 1861-65, and 1898) consisted of Indian\n(Native American) fighting. The Native American didn&#39;t\nform orderly battle lines and march onto the field\nlike Napoleon&#39;s Grande Armee. Indians were hit-and-run\nmounted archers, and to combat them the U.S. Cavalry\nevolved into mounted riflemen and scouts. In the U.S.\nArmy today, cavalry is synonomous with scouts and\nreconnaisance. Cavalry has always been more important\nin the U.S. as a reconaissance force than as a\nstriking force (witness JEB Stuart&#39;s failure at\nGettysburg), Americans preferring to hit the enemy\nwith artillery than to charge in among them. Maybe\nthat&#39;s why we never developed &quot;Lancer&quot; units, but I\nthink it&#39;s because the U.S. Cavalry developed\nprimarily as an Indian fighting force. If we had a\nunit of &quot;Lancers&quot; charge and Indian position, they&#39;d\njust run...with as much land as we had in the 19th\ncentury, the Indians could just keep running and\nrunning...\n\nI hope this might help, though again I do not claim to\nbe an expert. Ask me about the M1A1 Tank or what a\nmodern Division Cavalry Squadron does, and I&#39;ll tell\nyou!\n\nScouts Out!\n\nNate \n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
