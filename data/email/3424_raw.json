The action is intense, excellent historical accuracy. Some of the best graphics I&#39;ve seen in a PS2 game. Controls are easy and intuitive to learn as well. \n\nMy only complaint is that it sometimes takes an unrealistic amount of cuts to kill someone, but I suppose they had to do that for game balance.\n\nANyways, I hope they translate this game and bring it out stateside.\n\nIt&#39;s A+ all around.\n\n-Thom\n\n\n"
