It was released in 2003 and as such, is now part of our history.\n\nThe events in the movie? No. Some of the characters and events are VERY LOOSELY based on real history, but 99% of it is Holywood fantasy. Read the book &#39;The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori&#39; by Mark Ravina for the real history behind the character Katsumoto was based on.\n\n-AngusH\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
