However, the point he was trying to make, if\nI&#39;m correct, is that not everything in Japanese\nculture/life is imbued with Zen, nor is everything in\nJapanese history. Zen is a part of, but not the\nentirety. Sometimes a duck is just a duck. Zen is a\nsmall percentage of active Buddhist adherents in\nJapan. Unfortunately, it receives so much print and\npress that many people believe that all Japanese sit\nand listen to the rocks grow, or harken to hear the\nsound of one hand clapping. This is far from the\ntruth. Neither must one be a strict adherent of Zen\nBuddhism to practice Kendo or Kyudo. Yes, the\nphilosophy is part of the practice, but they are not\none and the same. Do I have to renounce my\nChristianity in order to pick up a shinai? I think\nnot. \n\n&gt; This might irritate you a bit but it is intended\n&gt; with a bit of humor \n&gt; and certainly much love: You wrote &quot;bear in mind the\n&gt; agendas of \n&gt; writers&quot;. The goal in Zen is to abandon all agendas.\n\nHowever, the writers mentioned certainly have a\nZen-biased agenda. That&#39;s not a criticism, but an\nobservation. Their purpose is to promote their image\nof Zen. \n\nTo me, it is JUST as unfortunate for people to be led\nto the misperception that all Japanese practice tea\nceremony and kendo in some sort of mystical Zen quest\nas it is for them to think that all samurai followed\nbushido and committed seppuku if they coughed wrong.\nWhile Zen captures the Western imagination, even\nTokugawa Ieyasu didn&#39;t belong to the Zen sect--he was\na follower of Jodo-shuu. Most samurai didn&#39;t study\nkenjutsu in preparation for some musha-shugyo where\nthey found spiritual enlightenment, they did it so\nthey could kill and keep from being killed on the\nbattlefield. While Kyudo may have developed as a means\nto putting Zen principles into practice, kyujutsu was\ndeveloped as a means of putting an arrow into your\nenemy. \n\nRegardless, I hope the young person who started all\nthis is happy--with no effort on his part, we&#39;ve given\nhim a lot to think about.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
