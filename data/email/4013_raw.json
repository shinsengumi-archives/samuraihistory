(I think that&#39;s right -- my \n&quot;japanese lessons&quot; include watching Iron Chef on the Food Network.)\n       Did Mitsuhide not slay Nobunaga to get back at him for something or \nother, perceived or real?  Or is that part of fictional lore?  And what would \nhave happened had Mitsuhide not taken the action?  In all honesty, I ask this \nquestion: Might Hideyoshi have tired of being the right arm of Nobunaga and \nsimply turned on him and taken him out himself, ascending to where he ended up \nanyway?  Or would he have been content to wait out Nobunaga&#39;s life and risk it \nagainst the sons?\n       Why do you consider Mitsuhide&#39;s move dumb?  As opposed to just plain \nluckless?  It seems to me that the Mori not finding out about Nobunaga&#39;s demise \nand Akechi&#39;s alliances crumbling wasn&#39;t something caused by stupidity, just \nbeing in the wrong place at the right time, which can be attributed to being, \nas I said before, just plain luckless.  I mean, it seems to me that Akechi \ncouldn&#39;t win for losing.  Same goes for Shibata, the other sons of Nobunaga and \neveryone else except for Hideyoshi and Ieyasu.  And something Hideyoshi may have \ndone anyway, given the time.  Somehow, I don&#39;t think he shed any tears \nwhatsoever over Nobunaga&#39;s death.\n       Just a couple questions.  :-D  Take care, y&#39;all.  :-D\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
