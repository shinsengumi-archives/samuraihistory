Guild (BCA) , 1988, at a good \nprice and would like to know if anyone has them and if they are any \ngood. I ordered &quot;Samurai Warfare&quot; and &quot;The Samurai Source Book&quot; \nthrough Amazon and was wondering if the above complete each other or  \nare redundant.\n\nCheers,\n\nNuno \n\n\n\n"
