To me, the inherent meaning of\nChristianity and the other beliefs is the morality (of course,\nmorality is such a vague word, it can change depending on the POV of\nthe society it comes from). You are right, I&#39;m not a religious person,\nwhich is not to say I don&#39;t believe in God, or even in the grand tale\nof angels, demons, and the rise and fall from grace of mankind, etc.\nWhat I don&#39;t believe in is in religions. I strip down the Message to\nits essence: do good and be rewarded (I&#39;m making it sound simpler than\nit is, but I won&#39;t go into too much detail). And one of the main\nreasons, if not the main one, why I do not believe in religions is\nprecisely that very fervent (sp?) people do give more weight to the\nindividual and unique aspects of their religions than to what really\nmatters. Why is it that even amongst same Beliefs the different\nreligions don&#39;t agree much and make those disagreements into something\nthat matters? As if being a good person but NOT believing in God will\ntake you to Hell, but one that is evil and constantly repents and\nconfesses to the priest, and do all the things the religion requires\nwill take you to Heaven, That doesn&#39;t make sense to me. So, once\nagain, I strip it down to the core. Even the Samurai code has that\ninherent message of goodness embedded on it.\n\nMiburo\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, golfmandan@a... wrote:\n&gt; Let me say first off that you&#39;ve misunderstood Christianity and\nBuddhism and most world religions if you think that the point is\nsimply morality. Sure, most religions have a system of morality, but\nthe defining of good and bad is NOT the point. In Christianity the\npoint is peace with God through faith in Christ. In Buddhism the point\nis the cessation of individual existence in an illusory world, to\nexist only in Nirvana. Christians want to propogate their religion\nbecause they believe people will be judged by God when they die, and\nso they think people need forgiveness to enter heaven instead of hell.\nBuddhists propogate their religion because they believe people are\nblinded by the material world from their need to escape into a\npainless and selfless existence in Nirvana. It IS the root principle\nthat matters. The moral system is a reflection of the root belief.\nThat&#39;s why Buddhist morals and Christian morals are so different. They\nDON&quot;T teach the same thing. I&#39;d assume from your post that you&#39;re not\na very religious guy. Talk to anybody who takes their religion\nseriously and you&#39;ll find that the beliefs are most important, not the\nleast important.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which, that&#39;s why the Jesuit missionaries tried to clothe Christian\ntruth in the fashion of contemporary Japanese religion. Christian\nbeliefs with Japanese rituals or practice. It&#39;s the underlying  belief\nthat is most important. So, in theory, if you make it look a little\nmore Japanese, it becomes easier for the Japanese to understand, but\nthe core beliefs remain intact. This method of propogating Roman\nCatholic faith was used by their missionaries a lot. It isn&#39;t looked\nat as deceitful, but simply as communicating their beliefs in such a\nway as to be more easily understood, and to some extent, in a manner\nmore palatable to the mind of the one being taught. Some of this has\nto do with Aristotelian distinctions between the accident and occident\nof a thing... The &quot;accident&quot; is the appearance of a thing. The\n&quot;occident&quot; is the core essence. The accident doesn&#39;t matter nearly as\nmuch as the occident. So, as long as the same core belief is being\ntaught, then the Catholics didn&#39;t care what it looked like. (In actual\npractice, though, the old Catholic method tends toward syncretism...\nmixing of both belief and ritual... so nothing remains in its pure form).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yeah, but what&#39;s the need to introduce christianity? Buddism (from\n&gt; &gt; what I know of it) does a good job of teaching what&#39;s good from what&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; bad, and that&#39;s what is important, the message, not the belief. At\n&gt; &gt; least, IMHO.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Miburo\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In a message dated 2/8/2004 10:49:24 AM Eastern Standard Time, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; medhal8@i... writes:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pe. Francisco Xavier entered in Japan through LIES and THREASON\n&gt; &gt; from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beggining. I&#39;ve read a copy of the original message of him to the\n&gt; &gt; pope with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a translation to portuguese, and he admited that, to introduce\n&gt; &gt; christianity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to japan, they would deliberatelly LIE and ACT WITH FALSEHOOD,\n&gt; &gt; disguissing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; christian religious practices with the buddhist ones...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Okay, just a question here: which would have been better: for\n&gt; &gt; them to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have used deception and get in to attempt the spread of their\n&gt; &gt; message or tell \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the truth, probably get killed and never get a word in about their\n&gt; &gt; message?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To me, missionary work can take on many disguises, because it&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt; matter of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; using whatever means you have to to get your message out and if you\n&gt; &gt; believe it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that important, you die for it.  As someone said, it&#39;s a matter of\n&gt; &gt; WHICH \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (L)ord you&#39;re dying for.  In their cases, they were dying for a Lord\n&gt; &gt; Not Of This \n&gt; &gt; &gt; World.  They adhered absolutely to the tenets of bushido in that\n&gt; &gt; they served \n&gt; &gt; &gt; their highest Lord to the death.  Show me one samurai who never lied\n&gt; &gt; or used \n&gt; &gt; &gt; falsehood or murdered or committed some form of treason to protect\n&gt; &gt; his lord -- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; human or Otherwise -- and I&#39;ll show you a liar.  :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        As for Nobunaga, what about the threat of the Ikko Ikki?  Do\n&gt; &gt; you think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they wanted to party hearty?  Do you think they were going to\ntry and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; proselytize him and his army?  Hardly likely.  It is unlikely that a\n&gt; &gt; majority of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; people who stood in Nobunaga&#39;s way, even if they did congeal into a\n&gt; &gt; potent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting force, would have stood a chance against a brilliant\n&gt; &gt; general such as the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; leader of the Oda and his right hand man, Toyotomi, this is true. \n&gt; &gt; But that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t the issue.  The issue was that anyone who stood in Oda&#39;s way\n&gt; &gt; of unifying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Japan -- in WHATEVER WAY THAT WAS -- was seen as a threat.  Any\n&gt; &gt; threat -- no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; matter how great or small, or how justified or unjustified -- must\n&gt; &gt; be removed. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Therefore, the genocide, however indefencible to us, was very\n&gt; &gt; defencible to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; HIM, and quite frankly, that&#39;s the only opinion about the issue that\n&gt; &gt; really \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mattered in the end, although it is nice to bat it around and say\n&gt; &gt; &quot;what if&quot; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;what was he thinking?&quot; now with four hundred years plus of\nhindsight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        And I must throw my hat into the ring about it too -- I may\n&gt; &gt; not be a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Catholic (either belief or by church membership), but these\n&gt; &gt; anti-Catholic posts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have GOT to stop.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Anyway, that&#39;s my two &quot;not-worth-much&quot; cents.  8-)  Take\n&gt; &gt; care, y&#39;all.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 8-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tim\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; --- \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
