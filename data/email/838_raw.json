There can \nbe little doubt that without the help of Oda, Hideyoshi would NEVER have \nrisen to the postion that he finally did..From bringing him onto the stage as \na Samurai through to Hideyoshi&#39;s vengeance that lead to his achieving the \nunification of Japan, Oda Nobunaga was THE pivotal figure in Hideyoshi&#39;s rise \nupwards.\n A few good books on both men are available; I would suggest that you start \nwith &#39;Hideyoshi&#39; by Elizabeth Berry...A thorough look at the man and his \npolicies and those who helped him in his rise. Also I would read &#39;Japonius \nTyrannus-Nobunaga reconsidered&#39; By Jerome Lamarrs (?) another very good book \non Oda and his ties to the Toyotomi house.\n Another possible candidate in your question would be Tokugawa Ieyasu as the \neventual Shogun aided Hideyoshi throughout as an equal commander under \nNobunaga before finally outgrowing and out living Hideyoshi...I am sure that \nthe influence of both of these men helped Hideyoshi and his understanding of \nJapanese politics at that stage in Japanese history.\n Others? Kato Kiyomasa perhaps, Inaba Ittetsu, or any of the Samurai that \nhelped in the Osaka battles of 1615...Many of the generals there had strong \nties to the Toyotomi and gave aid there due to the debt they felt they owed \nto Hideyoshi and his family....Rather than Tokugawa.\n Long issue but the books I recommended will help you out. Also try to read \nup on the Korean invasions of the late 16th century as many of the Samurai \ninvolved there were staunch supporters of the Toyotomi.\n HTH.\n Abayo.\n Ben Sharples\n\n"
