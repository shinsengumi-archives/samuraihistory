I only\n&gt; had a minute to flip through it, but it looks like\n&gt; Oda Nobunaga had\n&gt; 26 children.  I only know about 13--\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobutada\n&gt; Nobuo\n&gt; Tokuhime (wife of Tokugawa Nobuyasu)\n&gt; Touyama-Bunin [adopted] (Wife of Takeda Katsuyori)\n&gt; Fuyuhime (Wife of Gamou Ujisato)\n&gt; Hidekatsu\n&gt; Katsunaga\n&gt; Nagatsugu\n&gt; Nobukatsu\n&gt; Nobutaka (Died 1602)\n&gt; Gyokusen-in (Wife of Maeda Toshinaga)\n&gt; Nobutaka (2 sons named Nobutaka)\n&gt; Hideko (AKA Nichiei) (Wife of Tsutsui Sadatsugu)\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know anything about the other 13\n&gt; children of Nobunaga?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Saigen Nihonshi Vol. 19 page 39 lists 23 children,\n&gt; 11 boys and 12 girls.\n&gt; Rekishi Gunzo series # 1 page says 24 kids (12 boys\n&gt; and 12 girls) but gives\n&gt; no names. It also mentions on the following page\n&gt; that Nobunaga himself was\n&gt; one of  24 children and does list his brothers and\n&gt; sisters). One thing I\n&gt; have noticed is that some books get confused between\n&gt; real children and\n&gt; adopted children hence the various numbers. Anyway\n&gt; the children listed in\n&gt; Saigen Nihonshi not on your list are:\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobuhide\n&gt; Nobuyoshi (spelled 信吉)\n&gt; Nobusada\n&gt; Nobuyoshi (spelled 信好)\n&gt; Nagatsugu\n&gt; \n&gt; the list goes on with several &#39;onna&#39;\n&gt; married to Takigawa Kazumasa\n&gt; m. Niwa Nagashige\n&gt; m. Hideyoshi\n&gt; m. Mizuno Tadatane\n&gt; m. Kanpaku Nijo Akizane\n&gt; m. Madenokouji Mitsufusa\n&gt; m. Tokudaiji Sanefuyu\n&gt; m. Takeda Shingen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
