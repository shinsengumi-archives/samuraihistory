I was &#39;pleased&#39; with the art direction, the performan=\r\nces, sets, lighting, editing, costuming, the climatic sword fight, and the =\r\nattention to period detail. Primarily I was pleased that what could have tu=\r\nrned out to be just another hack Grade B &#39;noble ronin film&#39; (although these=\r\n entertain me as well) turned out to have a solid story that raised questio=\r\nns about the conflicting duties of the samurai class and made you think. Al=\r\nthough the film was a tragedy, I found it had many moments that amused me (=\r\nlike the top-knot throwing) and it was certainly diverting-despite the long=\r\n running time, I never found myself losing interest or clock watching. Ente=\r\nrtainment is more than just watching action scenes or things getting &quot;blowe=\r\nd up real gud&quot;-it also includes enjoyment of a well done story.\nAs far as u=\r\nsing this or any film as an historical source...I don&#39;t see it. I agree wit=\r\nh one of the other posters that in this regard, films are best used as &#39;jum=\r\nping off points&#39; to inspire someone to conduct further research. Even films=\r\n that pride themselves on being &#39;historically accurate&#39; are anything but. T=\r\nhe producers and cast thought Cruise&#39;s &#39;The Last Samurai&#39; was extremely his=\r\ntorically accurate-and we all know the general consensus of how the listmem=\r\nbers see that! Even a generally well thought of &#39;historical&#39; film like &#39;Sam=\r\nurai Banners&#39; is loaded with errors. This is due to editing concerns, budge=\r\nt restrictions, story flow, etc. Yes, one may be able to glean certain fact=\r\ns from a film, but I see the &#39;research payoff table&#39; as a graduated list wi=\r\nth films and video games (both of which I love) on one end with primary sou=\r\nrce documents on the other (followed by serious historians). Both may have =\r\nerrors (even the excellent reference work the 6 volume Cambridge History Of=\r\n Japan has errors, some of them quite unexcusable), but you&#39;re far more lik=\r\nely to find solid answers among the source documents and serious historians=\r\n. I see it as films inspiring one to ask questions, but the books and docum=\r\nents providing the best and most well-informed answers. \nExcept for a handf=\r\nul of &#39;art&#39; films, the primary function of a film is to make money for the =\r\nstudio or group that financed it. For all the awards and critical acclaim K=\r\nurosawa had, when his films began to lose money, he found it almost impossi=\r\nble to get backing to make more. When it&#39;s a question of being historically=\r\n accurate or entertaining, entertaining is going to win because that is wha=\r\nt sells tickets. When it&#39;s a question of being historically accurate or com=\r\ning in under budget/on time, the money people are usually going to win. Tha=\r\nnkfully, while books do sometimes have to make certain concessions to publi=\r\nshers, this usually doesn&#39;t affect content in a non-fiction book. \n\n\n\n\n"
