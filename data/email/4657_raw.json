To become \n&gt;a Samurai you must have the right bloodline, is this correct? Also \n&gt;how old would a boy be before he turned Samurai. And how old would he \n&gt;have to be before his first battle or was it, when he proved himself \n&gt;ready.    \n\nThis strikes me as too broad a question to admit of very meaningful answer. Of what period are you speaking? Over the eight centuries or so of samurai history, routes of entry changed enormously.\n\nIn the Sengoku, with its great expansion of infantry forces, it was entirely possible for a farmboy to become first an ashigaru and then a &quot;real&quot; samurai (the ashigaru not having been altogether assimilated to samurai status at that point) based on ability. Need I mention Hideyoshi? \n\nIn the Tokugawa, of course, there was vanishingly small opportunity for assimilation to the samurai class through individual military merit (a source of much unrest early in the period), but there were a number of other accesses to the lower rungs of it.\n\nIn Japan, as in most societies, there seem always to have been rites of passage into manhood which occurred about the time of puberty. It was at this point that the youth of samurai family took adult dress and hairstyle, and began carrying the long and short. The extent to which such striplings actually fought varied, of course. But we are told that Ieyasu (then Motonobu), for instance came officially of age at 15 and first fought at 17, leading his exigent forces in a border expedition. He was by then a married man.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the youngest of the 47 ronin was a lad of 15. He alone of the plotters was not condemned, on account of his youth, but he had participated in the attack.\n\nWill O&#39;Neil\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
