But I have an =\r\narmoury yeyyy and one spear Dojo, arrgghh the \nikko-iki already. \n\n    Anyw=\r\nay now for something completly different, back to the \nquestion I would lik=\r\ne to play chess with these guys but not Shogi \n(Japanese Chess) or Chinese =\r\nchess xiangQi.  Has anyone out there \nplayed it, very complicated, you some=\r\ntimes can&#39;t move your pieces \nbackwards (Very Bushido me thinks) allthough =\r\nthe names of the pieces \nin Kanji are fantastic Drunk Elephant, Treacherous=\r\n fox, strutting \ncrow, (This is shogi historical variants quoted from many =\r\ngames  ;)  \n\n    When I saw Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon I really found th=\r\ne names \nfascinating this goes one step beyond, surely madness you might \nt=\r\nhink, but it really works.  I urge everyone to check out \nhttp://www.the-un=\r\nderdogs.org/game.php?name=3DShogi+Variants it has a \ncopy of Shogi variants=\r\n with shogi from each period, historically \nrelevant, to Japan from the \nHe=\r\nian period through Sengoku, Monoyama, Meiji, Modern.  Awesome, also \nif not=\r\n get international Karate and sumo Hoppers, both Classics, very \nold school=\r\n.  \n\n    But seriously Shogi is fantastic, and it can help you get into \nth=\r\ne mind set of a warrior of these days, as they would have played \nthis or G=\r\no as a strategic exercise.  Check out Mr A.J Bryant&#39;s cool \nsite at www.geo=\r\ncities.com/sengokudaimyo/miscellany/miscellany.html to \nfind out more.  On =\r\na last note, I personally see Nobunaga as a \nbrutish, boring, unispiring le=\r\nader, Akechi Mitsuhide on the other \nhand he sounds cool, why did he kill N=\r\nobunaga, (I think I would have \ndone the same maybe I have a ruthless strea=\r\nk??!!(^_^)*** Nobunaga \nwanted to become King so to speak Akechi he was jus=\r\nt a pawn, \nsometimes, pawns take kings, (Shogi again) Just look at Hideyosh=\r\ni now \ntheres a Maneki Neko (Lucky cat) I would have liked to have known an=\r\nd \nfought beside.\n\nAgain check out Shogi I&#39;m sure you will find it useful, =\r\nif only for \nthe history, I really enjoy it, except you sometimes can&#39;t mov=\r\ne \nbackwards, this would never work in Total war as how the ##### do I \ntak=\r\ne a bridge province using 1 unit of Spearmen without fake \nretreating.  Xia=\r\nngQi Chinese chess has a river through the middle of \nthe board maybe I sho=\r\nuld study this a bit more.  \n\nAll the best Mark\n\n\n\n\n\n"
