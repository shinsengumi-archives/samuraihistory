The Foundation&#39;s\n&gt; office here in Kyoto has a\n&gt; &gt; well stocked lending library. I am sure the Tokyo\n&gt; one would have even\n&gt; &gt; better.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the same subject, Nate, International House in\n&gt; Tokyo has a very good English language library -\n&gt; it&#39;s in between Roppongi and Azabu. Can&#39;t find the\n&gt; phone number at the moment but I do have it\n&gt; somewhere if you can&#39;t get hold of it. It also holds\n&gt; lots of translations of Japanese literature. I read\n&gt; (among other things) &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; there which\n&gt; is a fascinating novel by Shimazaki Toson giving\n&gt; lots of interesting background on the Meiji era.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store:\n&gt; http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; --- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
