(was\n&gt; RE: [samuraihistory] R\n&gt; e: h itokiri k\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;m still going to make my own point.\n&gt; \n&gt; THEN direct that point to the group, and not AT me.\n&gt; Not that you necessarily did this, but Onnagozen\n&gt; did.\n&gt; You simply followed on with his/her post, so\n&gt; therefore came across as doing\n&gt; the same thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; Onnagozen replied directly to me, but as we&#39;ve said,\n&gt; with a tangentially\n&gt; perpendicular point. If you reply directly to me,\n&gt; I&#39;m going to directly\n&gt; answer, especially when addressed in an\n&gt; argumentative and combative manner.\n&gt; I&#39;ve got no problem if you or he/she or anyone wants\n&gt; to argue the merits and\n&gt; foibles of history books, in specific, or in\n&gt; general. I DO have a problem\n&gt; when this is couched as a counterargument to my\n&gt; statement, because it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t counter my statement whatsoever. \n&gt; \n&gt; What we had was this: \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate: &quot;Tangerines are not red.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dissenter: &quot;Well, neither are all apples red! So how\n&gt; do we really know which\n&gt; ones are red and which ones aren&#39;t? Does it matter?\n&gt; What does it matter if\n&gt; your apple is red and my tangerine is blue, as long\n&gt; as it inspires me? And\n&gt; certain tangerines may be of such hues of orange\n&gt; that they may be very very\n&gt; close to red.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Simple facts: not everyone can tell that tangerines\n&gt; are not red. Many\n&gt; tangerines may be so orange they are close to being\n&gt; red, but being red is\n&gt; not the point of a tangerine. For purposes of this\n&gt; analogy, all apples\n&gt; SHOULD be red--the fact that many are green or brown\n&gt; is a warning to the\n&gt; partaker that they need to check their apples before\n&gt; they eat them, but not\n&gt; grounds for saying that a. all apples are bad, or b.\n&gt; all tangerines are\n&gt; equally red with apples. \n&gt; \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
