As I read about the role of the Japanese woman (samurai mother, specifically). \nI get a deeper appreciation for how the things I&#39;ve learned  fit into raising my sons.\n\nNow, for you:  Are you in a diplomatic slot?  Wife get to come with?  How does she feel about it? Feel lucky or left out about Iraq \n& Afghanistan? How do you feel about Reserve and National Guardsmen being in the majority of the troops and not the Regulars?  How \ndo you perceive the attitudes(in general of course) of Japanese towards Americans?   My questions are mostly to get a better picture \nof where you are, and to broaden my perspective on things not on American soil.\n\nObediently,\n\nLizzie\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Nate Ledbetter\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Saturday, December 04, 2004 4:58 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] : History/Shotokan Re: new subject\n\n\n\n--- Elizabeth Chase &lt;lizzirrd@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n&gt; I spent far too many years as an &#39;Angry Woman&#39;.
