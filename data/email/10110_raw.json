It is, as I think was said in so=\r\nmeone&#39;s earlier email, very possible for a family to be named after a regio=\r\nn... or a particular landform... but after a castle? I myself cannot think =\r\nof any instances of this (although, there may be -some- throughout history)=\r\n.. \n Usually, the name is a location or an alteration to a previous name. F=\r\nor example, many names  have &quot;Fuji-&quot; or &quot;-to-&quot; (wisteria) in them can often=\r\n be traced back to Fujiwara.. thus the wisteria in the name refers to their=\r\n descent from the Fujiwara.  (Note : Most people with the name &quot;Fujiwara&quot; t=\r\nhese days are actually non-samurai who took the name in the Meiji era.) How=\r\never, the majority of clans descended from the Fujiwara, Genji, and Heishi =\r\nusually are named after the region or landform where their branch branched =\r\noff. \n   Both of the lineages of the japanese side of my family are descend=\r\ned from Fujiwara, and one of them also as a Genji connection (like almost a=\r\nny other bushi family right? hahaha).\n   One of them contains the &quot;Fuji-&quot;, =\r\nso you could guess its descent. The other name.. you would have no idea tha=\r\nt it came from Fujiwara or Genji based on the name by itself. \n  So again--=\r\n- it is almost always the name of a location or a landform. \n\n\n     Tamasak=\r\na, you are right. I don&#39;t know who you are and if my letter sounded offensi=\r\nve, I apologize. My intention is to provided my opinion, which is to focus =\r\non the history (geneology, graves, family ideology) and not on objects such=\r\n as swords. While these objects are nice to have, they are nice solely beca=\r\nuse they were once used by your ancestors.\n\n          We often forget to vi=\r\new history as &quot;People first&quot; and rather as a &quot;objects first&quot; approach. Some=\r\n Archeologist follow this approach, but I strongly disagree with it. I woud=\r\nl advise that you keep your family history as something living, not behind =\r\nglass.\n\n               That is what I am trying to say. \n\n   Tip :   Samura=\r\ni families tend to get bigger or smaller with time... BUT they almost alway=\r\ns tend to SPREAD OUT WITH TIME... So, if you know your name and history int=\r\no the mid 1700s... then just jump back in history to find that name and you=\r\n may be able to connect the dots eventually.  The idea is that they started=\r\n in small radius around eachother and spread out over time.... going back i=\r\nn time means they will be less spread around... does this make sense ? Fami=\r\nlies WILL move over time, so don&#39;t believe you are looking for a single loc=\r\nation throughout time. \n  Try to focus on the MAIN family first and then fo=\r\ncus on branch families second. You will understand the history better this =\r\nway. \n\n--- On Wed, 2/10/10, tamasaka@... &lt;tamasaka@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n\n&gt; From: tamasaka@... &lt;tamasaka@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihis=\r\ntory] how did samurai get their last name?\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups=\r\n.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, February 10, 2010, 2:46 PM\n&gt; Wow Steve u sound up s=\r\net! Well u do\n&gt; not know who I am nor do u know what my folks have\n&gt; accomp=\r\nlished for our genealogy. My folks already mapped out\n&gt; the genealogy tree =\r\nas far as 1721. So I know where my\n&gt; family/Clan comes from but its hard to=\r\n know when the family\n&gt; became samurai since the history was never pasted o=\r\nn due to\n&gt; a lack of interest or as my folks found out humbug. It was\n&gt; my =\r\nmother that generated the interest to her older brother\n&gt; who later remembe=\r\nred stories their Grand father told him.\n&gt; Later disclosed this information=\r\n to his sister, my mother.\n&gt; Any way it is always GREAT to have something t=\r\nangible in\n&gt; hand besides the genealogy & photos. I would have to\n&gt; agree w=\r\nith Takezo.=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; Any way my interest was to see if any one knew if a sa=\r\nmurai\n&gt; that served under a daimyo in a castle was named by the\n&gt; castle. F=\r\nor example, if a samurai served @ Ueda Castle his\n&gt; name was given Ueda. So=\r\n if this samurai was called Takeshi\n&gt; he will than be called Ueda Takeshi. =\r\nSo any one know for\n&gt; sure out there!?!\n&gt; Sent from my BlackBerry=AE smartp=\r\nhone with Nextel Direct\n&gt; Connect\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: S=\r\nteven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Tue, 9 Feb 2010 07:46:=\r\n41 \n&gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] =\r\nhow did samurai get their\n&gt; last name?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, this topic of the sword is=\r\n interesting..
