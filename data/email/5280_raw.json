Korea is my past... I will serve the United\n&gt; States\n&gt; &gt;in a due time. So, please, do not misinterpret my\n&gt; &gt;email...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                        Sincerely,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                        Changsub Lee\n&gt; \n&gt; Changsub,\n&gt; \n&gt;   With all due respect. The text books they complain\n&gt; about are not books for \n&gt; *us*. They are the texts for children in Japan. As\n&gt; for most of the medeival/ \n&gt; ancient history points, I&#39;d be far more inclined to\n&gt; believe real cites \n&gt; rather than attempts to disprove through lack of\n&gt; data. Many koreans have a \n&gt; severe dislike for Japan (with good reason), but I\n&gt; am as unlikely to pay \n&gt; much attention to those who try to use history as a\n&gt; stick rather than a \n&gt; learning tool as those who complain about\n&gt; prime-ministers visiting shrines.\n&gt;   From my Korean history class, I DO remember lots\n&gt; of jockeying for \n&gt; position/intrigue/fighting between the 3 kingdoms.\n&gt; Would the kingdoms have \n&gt; banded together to face an outside threat? Possibly,\n&gt; even probably if the \n&gt; threat were great enough. Would one of the kingdoms\n&gt; use outside troops in a \n&gt; power play? Probably if they thought the cost\n&gt; benefit ratio were high \n&gt; enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; M.J.Peters\n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; MSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months\n&gt; FREE* \n&gt; http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
