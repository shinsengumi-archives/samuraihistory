The hakama hid whether or not they\nwere seated like this in particular, or  _however_  they were seated in fact.\n\nKumo.\n\nNatsu Kusa Ya\nTsuamono Domo Ga\nYume No Ato\n\nBasho.\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: konos\n\nBesides it&#39;s ocassional apperance at the Edo Period and in the hitatare of 12th century, hakama is not obligatory. It&#39;s not a\ndaimyo&#39;s command. Nevertheless samurai were more or less obliged to follow the &quot;rich and famous&quot; status of the court they were\nimplicated in. First of all samurai were warriors. So even the obi was the right dressing only if it could carry tanto or\nwakizashi.\n\nGreetings from Greece, especially to Amphipolis.\nKonstantinos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
