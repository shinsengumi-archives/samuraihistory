The title seems to have become widespread in the \nKamakura Period, when it was based in fact (often being given to shugo \nhouses). By the Ashikaga age, the title was simply a sign of esteem.\nIn a similar vein, even more ancient titles were still being used in this \nhonorific fashion - Nakatsukasa, for example, was one of the 8 offices \nestablished by the ancient Yoro revision of the Tiaho Code.  As an example, \nTokugawa retainer Honda Tadakatsu was awarded the title Nakatsukasa-taiyu in \n1586 on a visit to Toyotomi Hideyoshi.  Obviously, Tadakatsu really had \nnothing to do with the &#39;Ministry of the Central Office&#39; (Nakatsukasa), nor \ndid Shimazu retainer Hishijima Gunai-shoyu Kunisada (d.1600) have much to do \nwith the ancient &#39;Ministry of the Imperial Household&#39; (Gunai/Kunai).\nAs for who exactly handed out these titles, I actually have not read much on \nthat. My assumption is that the Court was petitioned in individual cases to \nOk the awarding of the titles in question (as opposed to the Court doing so \nof its own volition as a rule, as literally hundreds - if not thousands - of \n&#39;-no kami&#39;&#39;s were walking around at any given time, if one is to judge by \nretainer registries).  I do know of any number of specific examples, one of \nwhich involved Takeda Shingen.  At the time of his coming of age, \nrepresentatives of both the the court and shogunate were in attendance.  At \nthat time he was allowed to use the &#39;Haru&#39; from the name of the then-shogun, \nYoshiharu, as well as the title &#39;Shinano no kami&#39;.  Around 1560 the Court \nawarded Mori Motonari and his eldest son Takamoto various titles (including \n&#39;Mutsu no kami&#39; for Motonari and &#39;Daizen-daibu&#39; for Takamoto) in recognition \nof gifts and donations they had sent on the occasion of the Emperor \nOgimachi&#39;s enthronement in 1559.\nPerhaps the liberal use of titles harks back, at least in spirit, to ancient \nChina, where one saw a bewildering array of colorful titles in circulation.  \nCertainly, sai-tai-shogun seems to have a Sino-inspired basis.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"
