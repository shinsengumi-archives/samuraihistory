Also im curious when the first samurai sword was brought to europe and how it was recieved. Merry christmas all , as ever i enjoy all your help and suggestions. p.s You all should read ashida kims website, i laughed so much ( buy a balaclava and you too could be a mystic ninja !!!)       james\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours do?\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
