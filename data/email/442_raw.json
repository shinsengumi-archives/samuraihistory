Did the samurai have to\nwear warmer clothing? Did battles simply not take place when it snowed?\nAnd what about intense heat? A samurai could get very hot under all that\narmor especially after the matchlock was introduced and the armor got\nheavier.\nI am still new to the world of samurai history so please excuse my\nignorance but I would like to hear what everyone else thinks.\n \nThanks\nSheldon\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
