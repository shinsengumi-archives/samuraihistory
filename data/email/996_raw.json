I could also recommend Tony Bryant&#39;s web \npage, but do not remember the address.  It comes up often in discussions \nhere, watch for it.\n\nOf books, I can recommend Samurai History by Steven Turnbull, it is a good \nstart.  There are others, I may get you names later if you have problems \nwith this one.\n\nBy the way, there was one more Uesugi, who was a sort of &quot;friends&quot; or rather \nan ally of Western forces prior to Sekigahara.  I believe it was Uesugi \nKagekatsu who could not strike at Tokugawa&#39;s because he was tied up by Date \nMasamune from the North and, I think, Maeda Toshie from the West while \nTokugawa&#39;s army made it South to meet the main Western (Mitsunari&#39;s) army.  \nHope this helps.\n\nTim K\n\n&gt;From: &quot;kallikrates777&quot; &lt;kallikrates777@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Re:  Uesugi Kenshin\n&gt;Date: Thu, 25 Jul 2002 16:14:58 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thank you, Tim!\n&gt;\n&gt;      I&#39;m really interested.
