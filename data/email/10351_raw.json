In biblical theology, you will find a great deal of text=\r\n dealing with what one should NOT do (sin)--the greatest example being the =\r\n10 commandment which is mostly a list of &quot;thou shall nots.&quot; It is a commona=\r\nlity among Western religions, but not something that a philosophy like Zen,=\r\n for example, adheres to. In that case you dealing more with &quot;doing&quot; than w=\r\nith not doing. \n\nI am sure you could read idealistic literature like &quot;Hagak=\r\nure&quot; and pull out some admonitions of what a samurai shouldn&#39;t do, but I vi=\r\new those more as advice than anything and not widespread law/rule. Using li=\r\nterature like that for historical purposes is a slippery enough slope as is=\r\n... You may also look into clan policy or law, but as we have seen in Chris=\r\ntian countries, religion and law are often miles apart. \n\nThe only &quot;sin&quot; th=\r\nat stands out to me would be disloyalty/dishonoring ones _____. \n\nComing up=\r\n with a general list of samurai sins seems like a tall order to me, but I&#39;d=\r\n be interested in seeing what you come up with. I find it quite interesting=\r\n.\n\nSent from my iPod\nJonathan P.

They always come as a matching p=\r\nair. So if \n&gt; &gt; Samurai have Virtues based on Bushido and the like, it woul=\r\nd stand to \n&gt; &gt; reason they have Sins, too. But I can&#39;t find them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; So...do they exist, and I&#39;m just missing them? If so, does anybody \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n know what they are?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Setting aside the debate about whether S=\r\namurai ever really &quot;followed \n&gt; &gt; Bushido&quot; for a moment - take whatever vir=\r\ntues you&#39;ve found, and \n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t the opposite be the &quot;sin&quot;? I don&#39;t thi=\r\nnk &quot;sin&quot; in a secular \n&gt; &gt; medieval Japanese context is the right word thou=\r\ngh - not to mention, \n&gt; &gt; Bushido is definitely not a religion, although th=\r\ne impression I get is \n&gt; &gt; that some modern Western martial artists will li=\r\nttle knowledge of \n&gt; &gt; Japanese history treat it like it is.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text por=\r\ntions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
