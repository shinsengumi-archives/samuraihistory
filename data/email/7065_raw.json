Could you please\nprovide this specific\ninformation?  I am particularly interested in what is\nthe specific Hollywood\nmisinformation you attribute to Mr. Hayes.  If I am\nreading your post\ncorrectly, you seem to indicate that Masaaki Hatsumi\nis a fraud.  Could you\nalso present your basis for this as well? Who has Mr.\nHayes or Mr. Hatsumi\ndrefrauded and how? You also mentioned history books. \nWhat specific history\nbooks do you feel we should be reading so that &quot;this\ncrap wouldn&#39;t keep\ncoming back&quot; and while we are at it, to what specific\n&quot;crap&quot; are you\nreferring?  Your post gives the impression that you\nhave reseached Mr. Hayes\nand Mr. Hayes.  What methodolgy did you use for this\nreseach?  How much time\nwas put into it?  What qualifications do you\npersonally hold to make a valid\nassesment whether or not the activities of Mr. Hayes\nor Mr. Hatsumi are\nfraudlent?  Lastly, since you brought it up, for whom\nare you an\nintellegence officer?\n\nTake care,\nJohn\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Nate Ledbetter&quot; &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, May 08, 2005 10:33 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] New Ninja documentary\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Helly Angel &lt;ahelly69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I cannot understand as someone that supposedly is\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Intelligence Officer&quot; does not be able to check a\n&gt; &gt; website, to revise the information and to know if\nis\n&gt; &gt; spoken of someone serious or not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Who  speak of straight swords or estupids running\nin\n&gt; &gt; black pajamas?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is really important if Hayes is in the film?\nMasaaki\n&gt; &gt; Hatsumi is in the film and this is sufficient for\n&gt; &gt; me.   Each one is free to administer its knowledge\n&gt; &gt; as want.\n&gt;\n&gt; As an Intelligence Officer, I&#39;m trained to research,\n&gt; evaluate, analyze, and recommend. The first decision\n&gt; to make is &quot;Is this worth my time?&quot; Anyone in\nacademia\n&gt; will tell you that if you want to judge the quality\nof\n&gt; someone&#39;s research, check out their sources. Hayes\nis\n&gt; hardly a &quot;source&quot; of anything but Hollywood\n&gt; misinformation. If this documentary is going to use\n&gt; him as a source, then there&#39;s no reason for me to\n&gt; waste my time clicking on the link, much less\nwatching\n&gt; the dang thing. And last I checked, Hayes learned\nfrom\n&gt; Hatsumi. Ergo (That means &quot;therefore&quot;), I don&#39;t see\n&gt; much reason to be excited about him, either. Let me\n&gt; break it down: Hayes = fraud. Hatsumi taught Hayes\n&gt; everything he knows. That makes Hatsumi a.....?\n&gt;\n&gt; Criminy, if people would put down the martial arts\n&gt; magazines and pick up a history book, this crap\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t keep coming back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Or ï¿½it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by\n&gt; &gt; the Budo Taijutsu?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not a CLUE what you&#39;re saying here. I&#39;m assuming\nthat\n&gt; English isn&#39;t your first language.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my country we have a thought: &quot;when the words\nare\n&gt; &gt; not better than the silence, is better to\nsilence&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; What country are you from? I assume that research\n&gt; standards there aren&#39;t up to par with what you&#39;d\n&gt; expect from REAL historical research, and not\n&gt; Hollywood or martial arts fantasy, in the US or\nJapan.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I recommend you see the film and train dogs, not\n&gt; &gt; martial arts. Not with a heart closed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the pseudo-zen, that really makes me feel\n&gt; shamed into reading my fortune cookies next time. Go\n&gt; ahead, believe the hype--enjoy your &quot;ninjutsu&quot;.
