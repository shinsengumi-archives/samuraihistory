The book is called &quot;Everyday Things in \nPremodern Japan: The Hidden Legacy of Material Culture&quot; and it is by Susan \nB. Hanley  ISBN:  0520218124\n\n  As for the &quot;training,&quot; a very brief overview (academically speaking) can \nbe found in the book &quot;Secrets of the Samurai: A survey of the Martial Arts \nof Feudal Japan&quot; by Ratti and Westbrook  ISBN: 0785810730\n\n  I hope that this helped you in some way.
