You can put them all in a box or something if \nyou wish.  Furniture is not often all that valuable, except in rare cases.  \nIf and when you do get a small cleaning kit be VERY sure not to get any oil \non the tang.  The small kits are about $30 at any martial arts supply site.  \nIf you do manage to get one and need help with the cleaning procedure please \nfeel free to ask me, I will be more than happy to help.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  \nhttp://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\n\n\n"
