What Brand had to say\n&gt; wasn&#39;t at all stupid and it is very possible that he&#39;s\n&gt; correct. As far as my name goes, there is nothing odd\n&gt; about it and it is very much a Japanese name that was\n&gt; given to me by my great-grandmother who happened to be\n&gt; Japanese, which goes to show that you&#39;re not as much\n&gt; an authority as you seem to give yourself credit for\n&gt; being. \n&gt;     As for everyone else who has responded, thank you\n&gt; so much for your help. It is greatly appreciated and\n&gt; if you have any other suggestions, please don&#39;t\n&gt; hesitate to let me know what they are.\n&gt;                                    Taneiko\n&gt; --- &quot;Anthony J.
