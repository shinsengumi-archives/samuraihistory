I have read your book on the Samurai and it is very\n&gt; well written but seems to contradict Turnballs&#39;s books, especially on the\n&gt; basic orgin of the Samurai. Are these just conflicting views? How d you view\n&gt; this work? Thanks for you time\n\n\nFor the record, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever mocked anything Steve&#39;s written. Given \nmy own position, it would be in rather bad taste. I generally stay clear of \nconversations about his work. For myself, it was his big samurai history book \nthat was the first non-fiction book on the subject I ever read, so I owe him. &lt;G&gt;\n\nTony\n\n\n"
