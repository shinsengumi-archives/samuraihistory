Amongst other sources, English, \nJapanese, French and German, I have looked at three contemporary \nversions of the Nagashino screens - and modern japanese \nrepresentations - translating the Kanji annotations.\n&gt; Can any of you, &quot;my learned collegues&quot;, provide any information or \nsource idetifying this person?\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Rod Johnson\n\n\n\n"
