I could be\n&gt; beating a dead horse here but his title was samurai\n&gt; and he is known for his dueling capabilities. With\n&gt; this in mind doesnt that mean something toward his\n&gt; account. \n\nSure. It makes him worth study, I don&#39;t debate that.\nDoes it make him the GREATEST? No. Not until you can\nexplain WHY he&#39;s better than EVERY OTHER SAMURAI who\never lived. That&#39;s what &quot;GREATEST&quot; means. We live in\nthe age of Sportscenter, where they throw that term\naround constantly without regard to the meaning of it.\nSome Joe Schmo gets considered the &quot;greatest&quot; for\nmaking a tackle. Woo hoo. \n\nOk put it this way if you did not know abt\n&gt; Japanese history or culture but that one name that\n&gt; is a house hold name has to be Musashi. Kind of like\n&gt; Einstien and Chemestry. I hope this makes more\n&gt; sense. \n\nSo...what your saying is that because Musashi is\nfeatured in video games or martial arts magazines more\nthan other samurai, and his name is more recognizable\nto people who KNOW NOTHING about Japanese history,\nthen that makes him the greatest? \n\nIf I want to get opinions about who the greatest\nrunning back of all time in the NFL is, I&#39;m not going\nto go ask people who don&#39;t watch football. I&#39;m going\nto ask the experts--the greats who&#39;ve played the game,\nthe people who get paid to analyze, the\ncoaches...these are the people who really know what it\ntakes to be the best. \n\nSimiliarly, I&#39;m not going to accept the statement that\n&quot;Musashi is the greatest&quot; because people ignorant of\nactual Japanese history know his name. This is\nprecisely my problem with this whole topic. People who\nKNOW Japanese history can come up with many other\nexamples (as I did in the previous email) of people\nthat, depending on your criteria, could be considered\n&quot;great samurai&quot;. Why would I go ask someone who&#39;s\nknowledge of Japan and the samurai came from Onimusha\nand the 3 weeks of karate classes he took in Hoboken,\nNew Jersey?  \n\nMy dad once used this example with me: Do you know who\nChet Atkins was? I guarantee you that Eddie Van Halen,\nJimi Hendrix, and anyone else who became famous\nplaying a guitar knows. He was possibly the best\nguitarist of all time--not the most famous, but the\nbest. All the great guitarists after him know who he\nwas, and studied him. The point is that most\nfamous/widely known does NOT equal best. \n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
