I was looking also for more information on\n&gt; &gt;&gt;each warrior.... looking to link in a back piece to my\n&gt; &gt;&gt;body suit. Thank you\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; sorry i dont know about the hakkenden.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; another story you might check out is the suikoden.\n&gt; &gt; from what i remember suikoden is the original chinese title.  \njapan \n&gt; &gt; has its own, slightly personalized, version. \n&gt; \n&gt; That would be the Hakkenden. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\ni kind of thought that might be the case.\nthe eight dog samurai threw me, though.  suikoden has over a hundred \nheros.\nis it actually about 8 samurai or does the number have some other \nsignificance?\n\non the side, theres a sonny chiba film about 8(?) samurai.  wonder if \nits based on hakkenden.  would be kind of disapointing to know how \nbadly they slaughtered a story of such significance.  was happy \nbelieving it was just some good, if cheesy, chop-sockey.\n\n\n"
