Were horses reserved for military use / use as pack animals?  Would a samurai on his master&#39;s business or personal travel have ridden?  (Some of the artwork I&#39;ve seen from later ages does show both mounted samurai and walking retainers -- was this the exception?)\n\nAnd, if they did travel by horse, what sort of horses would they have ridden?  (A quick Google search shows me that a lot of people on the internet are asking these questions, but reliable answers are scarce.)\n\nAs always, any assistance would be GREATLY appreciated.\n\n--R Michael Burns  \n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
