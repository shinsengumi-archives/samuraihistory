I&#39;m a simple bugei who loves to read about\nthose warriors, & their times, who practiced their martial specialties\nsomewhat more seriously than I (due to obvious reasons), although I have\nbeen a practitioner for some twenty years.  My own Japanese is limited &\nI&#39;ve only visited Japan twice.\n\nI agree with Alex:  big novelisations, like those of Yoshikawa&#39;s, are a\ngreat way to pick-up &quot;the flavour&quot; of our subject/topic of interest.\nGeneral Studies, like those of Newman, Wiencek & Cook are also very useful\nas is Friday&#39;s &quot;Hired Swords&quot; (which I believe is quite accessible for us\namateurs).\n\nSadler&#39;s &quot;The Maker of Modern Japan&quot;, Mabire & Breheret&#39;s &quot;The Samurai&quot; are\ngood and Wilson&#39;s translations:- &quot;Ideals of the Samurai&quot; & the\n&quot;Budoshoshinshu&quot; are really great.  &quot;Musui&#39;s Story - the Autobiogaphy of a\nTokugawa Samurai by Katsu Kokichi is absolutely marvellous as a journal of\nthe first half of the nineteenth century.\n\nI&#39;d also like to concur with Scott Nicholas, who noted that the emergence of\nthe &quot;samurai&quot; militarily was during Masakado&#39;s rebellion.\nRegards,\nSteve Lofts.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Alex Hazlett&quot; &lt;arexu@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;samurai list&quot; &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 25, 2002 3:24 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Japanese historical fiction\n\n\n&gt;    For those of you who did want their history in a big novelization,\n&gt; have you seen the works of Eiji Yoshikawa? These are huge\n&gt; (many hundreds of pages) tomes (His book on Musashi was printed in 5\n&gt; volumes I believe).\n&gt;\n&gt;   I read &#39;Musashi&#39; and &#39;Taiko&#39; for sure, and perhaps another on the\n&gt; Heike,\n&gt; they are long reads but well worth the time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Alex Hazlett\n&gt;\n&gt; p.s. according to amazon.com, people who buy &#39;Taiko&#39; are likely to buy\n&gt; books by:\n&gt; Takuan Soho\n&gt; Stephen Turnbull &lt;---------------\n&gt; John Allyn\n&gt; Miyamoto Musashi\n&gt; Yagyu Munenori\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
