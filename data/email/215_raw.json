In fact at that time so many different armies\nwould join forces and then split that the armies were\nreally just coalitions of different forces.  \n\nThe sashimono was a device used buy a single samurai\nto identify his position on the field.  During this\nperiod for the most part warrior attentandts had been\ngotten rid of and the individual warrior would carry\nhis own sashimono on a ring and post on the back of\nthe armour.\n\nAnouther form of device was the o uma jirushi.  This\nwas the identifyibng device of a daimyo or high\nranking general in the army.  This device was usually\npositioned at the center of an army near were the\ngeneral was positioned.  This position was usually the\npoint of the most conflict.  The holder/holders of the\numa jirushi were considered very important and\nhonored.  \n\nEarlier in the e-mail I said that attendants were\nmostly gotten rid of.  This is true except ing the\ncase of the daimyo or some high ranking personages who\nstill had quite a few, dependant upon there income of\nkoku.\n\nThere are few books that talk about the actual\nformatio ns and positions in early samurai warfare. \nYou can find some strategy maps and battle formations\nin books like &quot;sekigahara&quot; by anthony J. Bryant. \n&quot;Nagashino&quot; by stephen turnbull and the &quot;Samurai\nsourcebook&quot; by stephen turnbull.\n\nWell I hope that this has been helpful.\nThere are more identifying devices like religous\nsayings such as namyo ho renge kyo but for the most\nsimple this is it.\n\nMusashi\n--- bnason@... wrote:\n&gt; Greets all!\n&gt; \n&gt; Just want to say that I&#39;m thrilled to have found\n&gt; this list, even \n&gt; though I&#39;m at best a pseudo-amateur historian of\n&gt; Japanese military \n&gt; history.  My main interest in this group is that I&#39;m\n&gt; an avid \n&gt; wargamer, and am putting together miniatures to\n&gt; recreate samurai \n&gt; conflicts from the feudal era (just ordered 800+\n&gt; miniatures).\n&gt; \n&gt; At first, I probably won&#39;t have a good mix of troop\n&gt; types to \n&gt; represent what would have appeared on the\n&gt; battlefield at any given \n&gt; time.  I have a small contingent of monks, lots of\n&gt; mounted troops, \n&gt; and an assortment of ashigaru spearmen, bowmen, and\n&gt; some samurai \n&gt; retainers.  While I have a couple ashigaru\n&gt; arquebusiers, my thought \n&gt; is that with all the mounted troops I&#39;d best\n&gt; represent earlier \n&gt; periods of warfare (1300-1450ish or so).\n&gt; \n&gt; My conundrum is this: I&#39;d like to paint the\n&gt; miniatures so that they \n&gt; reflect what a real army would have looked like on\n&gt; the battlefield.  \n&gt; With only a few exceptions, such as Ii&#39;s Red Devil&#39;s\n&gt; in the later \n&gt; period of samurai warfare, I&#39;ve run across almost no\n&gt; accounts of \n&gt; organized uniforms or the like.  I&#39;ve even having a\n&gt; hard time \n&gt; figuring out how sashimono&#39;s and other field\n&gt; standards would be \n&gt; used.  Anyone mind giving me some tips on how they\n&gt; would be used, and \n&gt; what a typical army might look like?  My guess is\n&gt; assorted colors, \n&gt; but I&#39;m not sure.  Like I said, I enjoy the history\n&gt; of the period but \n&gt; am not well versed in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt; Ben Nason\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
