I think if you will follow the discussion of \njust what is a samurai and what has become of the samurai class going \non now in other threads here many of your questions will be answered. \nThere are no true samurai left, there are many descendants of samurai \nstill around and many good tales from the period before the samurai \nclass was abolished. Unfortunately there is no one left alive from that \nperiod, for most people alive today they would have been their Great \nGreat Grandparents.\n\tSince you work in Radio and need a live body for your work I would \nsuggest looking for a Kendo or Iaido dojo in your area. Look for \nJapanese instructors or students born before the war and approach them \nfor an interview. Were we in Japan, I could introduce you to many \ninteresting characters but alas I am no longer there. Not having met \nyou myself I wouldn&#39;t feel right sending you to my friends homes and \nnot be present myself. I am sure you can find persons of interest right \nthere in Singapore...\n-t\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\n\n\n"
