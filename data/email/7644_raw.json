He founded its \ncapital and its political culture, influencing literature and art. \nHe was made a god, and is as honoured today as he was at the height \nof his power.\n\nA busy schedule of events and activities, in a partnership with the \nJapanese World Heritage Site, supporting the display (which runs \nuntil 30 August) will bring to life Japan, its art, culture and \ntraditions. There will be a dedicated outreach and education \nprogramme, as well as activities such as Yabusame (Japanese archery \non horseback), Kobudo and Kendo (martial arts), Japanese tea \nceremonies, calligraphy, swordsmanship, origami and Tanka poetry \nworkshops.\n\nFind out more about ancient Japan by visiting the dedicated website: \nhttp://www.shogun.org.uk/overview/overview.html\n\n\n\n\n"
