My\n&gt; friend said that samurai never used any kinds of gun\n&gt; in the battle. I\n&gt; need someone help me to clarify this. Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nYour friend watches too many movies. Guns were\nintroduced to Japan via both the Portuguese in the\n1540&#39;s and the Chinese in limited fashion prior to\nthat. By the 1550&#39;s there were gun factories in\nseveral areas in Japan, and by the 1570&#39;s they were\nproducing more guns than Europe. Tell your friend to\nlook up the Battle of Nagashino, 1575--the Oda army\nused 1,000 to 3,000 guns, depending on your source, in\na rotating volley fire, sometime before this became\nstandard practice in Europe. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
