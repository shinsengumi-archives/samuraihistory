I&#39;m hoping in that it is unusual, it would be easier to\n&gt; narrow down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; could sport all three.\n&gt; &gt;     And I would point out once we get into the Meiji period no\n&gt; rules were\n&gt; &gt; followed and any mon might be used by any family. In the end I\n&gt; think it is\n&gt; &gt; near impossible to identify a family by mon without some other\n&gt; evidence.\n&gt;\n&gt; The koshirae here do date to the 1700s though, so hopefully that\n&gt; would eliminate the Meiji stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt; And then 2/3 would hopefully narrow it down to a set of choices...\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you both for your help!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
