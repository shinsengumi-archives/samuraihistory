I&#39;m haven&#39;t heard Keigen used too much. Usually \npeople refer to that shape as Keicho.

A great read.\n&gt;\n&gt;The swordsmith in this article who made the modern tanto from the Corus\n&gt;&quot;namban tetsu&quot;, Takano Yukimitsu, was trained by Ono Yoshimitsu as the\n&gt;article says and he specialises in ayasugi hada of the Gassan school, \n&gt;though\n&gt;I have to say I could not see any evidence of that in the photos of the\n&gt;tanto on the website.\n&gt;\n&gt;I will have to leave it to other listeros to comment on the hada of the\n&gt;Yasutsugu smiths.  I believe they usually made a very tight itame, \n&gt;sometimes\n&gt;mixed with mokume, and that the shinogi ji was often masame, but I bow to\n&gt;superior knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Dunckx\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: token_kenkyu_kai-owner@...\n&gt;[mailto:token_kenkyu_kai-owner@...] On Behalf Of Maximo\n&gt;Sent: 03 September 2007 14:42\n&gt;To: token_kenkyu_kai@...\n&gt;Subject: Keigen shinto or Keygen shinto\n&gt;\n&gt;Please,\n&gt;Does anyone have info about this school? in special about Nanban-Tetsu, \n&gt;type\n&gt;of hada?\n&gt;http://www.tokensugita.com/NT.htm\n&gt;Is the Yasutsugu school a good example?\n&gt;http://www.nihonto.com/abtartyasutsugu.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Keigen-Shinto period (1596 - 1623)\n&gt;Kissaki = O-kissaki (could it have a little ikari kissaki?)\n&gt;Sori = less than half inch?\n&gt;Nagasa = 70 cm?\n&gt;Hada = Very tight itame?\n&gt;Hamon = type ko-choji?\n&gt;Nakago = ?\n&gt;Any particular thing?\n&gt;\n&gt;Is the number 11 or number 8 Keygen shinto?\n&gt;http://www.touken.or.jp/syurui/tokuchozu.html\n&gt;Which is the principal difference with last muromachi?\n&gt;Thank you in advance,\n&gt;M�ximo\n&gt;\n&gt;M�ximo D.
