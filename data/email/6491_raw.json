Two \ndifferent performances based on kabuki plays will be held during a \n10-day period ending Jan. 16 at the Benisan Pit in Koto Ward, Tokyo. \n\nThere will be 11 performances of Sakurahime Omoteura Daikitan, \nadapted by Norihiko Tsukuda. The second play, Kamikakete Sango \nTaisetsu (The Love-Crazed Samurai), adapted by Kiyokazu Yamamoto, \nwill be performed three times, with subtitles in English (Jan. 13), \nChinese (Jan. 15) and Russian (Jan. 16). Both plays are based on \nstories originally written by Tsuruya Namboku. \n\nJapan, and in particular Tokyo, boasts a large number of smaller \nexperimental theater groups and individuals who are part of a \ncreative underground. \n\nLed by avant-garde artists, these small theater movements emerged in \nthe 1960s, born out of a rebellion against overregimented postwar \nJapanese society. Ryuzanji Company shares the research-oriented and \nexperimental approach that characterize independent underground \ntheater movements. \n\nDirector Ryuzanji is an energetic theater artist who has been active \nin Japan&#39;s small theater movements since 1970. He is an accomplished \nactor, producer and director, having directed over 200 plays during \nhis career, including Educating Mad Persons, written by Shuji \nTerayama. He started Ryuzanji Company with the intention \nof &quot;facilitating a horizontal affiliation among small theater \nactivists.&quot; \n\nConsequently, Ryuzanji Company produces performances using talent \nfrom different genres: traditional and contemporary, dance and \ntheater. They are also active internationally, and in 2000 were \nawarded the grand prix &quot;Best Of Fringe&quot; for their performances of \nEducating Mad Persons at the Victoria Fringe International Theater \nFestival in Canada. \n\nSakurahime Omoteura Daikitan is the complicated story of a high-\nranking priest who, after failing to commit suicide with his male \nlover, falls in love with a beautiful young princess. Chased by the \nprincess&#39; evil rogue lover, the two escape only to meet very \ndifferent fates. The priest accidentally dies, and the princess \nbecomes a prostitute for a short time. The central appeal of the \nplay is the idea of a princess becoming a prostitute, which was met \nwith fascination by audiences when the play was first performed in \n1817. \n\nThe main character in The Love-Crazed Samurai is taken from a famous \nkabuki play, Chushingura, which is based on one of Japan&#39;s most \nfamous revenge vendetta episodes. The real-life incident took place \nin 1702, when 47 samurai avenged their master&#39;s death. \n\nThe protagonist in The Love-Crazed Samurai is one of these 47 \nsamurai. He is a ronin, or a samurai without a master, who is kicked \nout of his clan when a large sum of money is stolen while he is on \nguard duty. He sets about retrieving the money in order to regain \nhis status and lead an attack upon a rival clan that had killed his \nmaster. \n\nRyuzanji Company describes The Love-Crazed Samurai as a play about \nwrongdoers, the fate of men and a woman blinded by money and about \nmen who deceive and kill each other in the furtherance of uchiiri, a \njustified raid for a noble cause. This play is full of atrocities, \nlaughing at didactic stories where good always wins in the end. The \nNamboku world created by playwright is dry and vacant. Kamikakete \nSango Taisetsu is full of wickedness and eros, and is a very \nmodernistic play. \n\nRyuzanji and his company believe that kabuki is &quot;the fountainhead of \nJapanese stage art.&quot; They are inspired by the parallel themes \ndealing with human interaction that exist in the ancient stories of \nkabuki plays and modern-day society. Written in the language of the \ntime, kabuki plays often take many hours to perform, and therefore \nthe adaptation process requires a reduction in length of the plays \nwhile maintaining the essence of the story itself. \n\n&quot;By thoroughly modernizing the language of kabuki, we can \nreconstruct kabuki from the Edo period (1603-1868) into a \ncontemporary play,&quot; says Ryuzanji. He adds that performing a kabuki \nplay written 180 years ago in the present day poses an inviting \nchallenge as to how people today breathe life into words written so \nlong ago. \n\nIn adapting the stories, Ryuzanji has sought to create a unique \nstyle of contemporary &quot;Ryuzanji Kabuki.&quot; This he achieves first by \nsimplifying and reducing the elaborate visual spectacles often found \nin kabuki plays. Second, the play is re-created through the combined \neffort of all the members of the ensemble. The result is a unique \nand entertaining style of performance in which the actors&#39; physical \nexpression carries the story of the play. \n\n&quot;Originally in kabuki there were no directors. The actors themselves \nare largely responsible for creating their own part,&quot; explains \nRyuzanji. &quot;Our performances follow this example by a very open \nattitude to stage direction where the ideas of the actors, \nchoreographers and musicians are all given consideration in the \nrehearsal process. The actors&#39; movements and emotional expressions \nbecome more important than the story itself. Our performances are \nexperimental but at the same time very entertaining.&quot; \n\nTraditional kabuki is performed only by male actors. Obvious \nadaptations that Ryuzanji has made in The Love-Crazed Samurai \ninclude his casting a female actress, Hiroko Ito, in the lead \nsamurai role, and his conscious combination of elements from kabuki \nand the all-female Takarazuka Revue. \n\n&quot;The main theme for both plays is war and universal judgment,&quot; \nRyuzanji says. &quot;I feel that these themes can sometimes be more \naccentuated and explained by a woman.&quot; \n\nAudiences can also expect original percussion music performed on \nstage during performances in tune with the Ryuzanj Company&#39;s \nmotto: &quot;Dancing, singing and loving.&quot; \n\nThe company tells ancient stories through dynamic, sensitive \nmovements and choreographed fight scenes with contemporary relevance \nin what Ryuzanji jokingly calls &quot;Tarantino Kabuki.&quot; \n\n\n&quot;Sakurahime Omoteura Daikitan&quot; will be performed Jan. 6-12 and Jan. \n14-16, and &quot;The Love-Crazed Samurai&quot; will be performed Jan. 13, 15 \nand 16, both at Benisan Pit in Koto Ward, Tokyo, a five-minute walk \nfrom Morishita Station on the Toei Shinjuku and Oedo subway lines. \nFor more information, call (03) 5272-1785. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
