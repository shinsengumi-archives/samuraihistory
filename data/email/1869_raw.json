Then we can all join\n&gt; in, lurk or \n&gt; delete \n&gt; &gt; as we see fit.\n&gt; &gt; \tBTW I give anzen unten stickers to all my friends\n&gt; who drink \n&gt; &gt; and drive, and have omamori on all my bogu bags. I\n&gt; also think the \n&gt; &gt; Swiss are the most evil people on earth!\n&gt; &gt; -t\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
