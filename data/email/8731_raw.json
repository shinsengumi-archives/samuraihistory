Either allow such stories, as \nlong as t=\r\nhe prequel/sequel can stand completely as an independent \nstory. Or else ma=\r\nke a rule that a writer cannot write a story about \nany character who was i=\r\nn any of his/her previous years&#39; entries.\n\nGood point. Common sense says it=\r\n is fine as long as it is a complete \nshort story on its own, but since I d=\r\nidn&#39;t clarify that this time \naround (didn&#39;t even think about it) it of cou=\r\nrse popped up.  I&#39;ll \nclarify it this next time, same characters - fine as =\r\nlong as it is a \ncomplete short story and doesn&#39;t read like a chapter in a =\r\nlarger \nstory.\n\n \n&gt; 2) You might want to allow a writer to enter more than =\r\none story, \nas long as each of an entrant&#39;s stories are in a different \ncat=\r\negory.  \n\n\nIsn&#39;t that sort of like stuffing the balot box?  Although if I d=\r\nid \nallow this, I would also have to require a seperate fee for each \nstory=\r\n, which might make it interesting, story wise and money wise.\n\n&gt; 3) I would=\r\n make at least a suggestion that, as this is \nthe &quot;SAMURAI Fiction Contest&quot;=\r\n, that the main character of any story \nactually be a samurai. Or else, if =\r\nthe POV character isn&#39;t a \nsamurai, that the story centers on some sort of =\r\nsamurai character. I \nrealize that in earlier eras of Japanese history, tha=\r\nt samurai \ndidn&#39;t exist as a distinct, separate class. So for these stories=\r\n, it \nshould center on a person who would perform a role that a samurai \nwo=\r\nuld perform i.e. fight in battles or studies a martial art.\n\n\nThat is a tou=\r\ngh one.  The first contest was very strict, and there \nwere good results. T=\r\nhis one was less strict, and had a larger \nvariety. I&#39;ll have to think abou=\r\nt this one, but I am taking it under \nadvisement. Technically speaking, the=\r\n &quot;historical fiction&quot; option \ncovered this. So I&#39;m drawn between the two - =\r\nI don&#39;t want to \nactively discourage anyone from entering by making it too =\r\nstrict, \nbut at the same time the more focused stories tend to be more \nint=\r\nerestng, because the people with the knowledge and interest are \nthe ones w=\r\nho write them.\n\nThanks for the thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
