The war began with \nthe Minamoto rising again in 1=\r\n180 and ended with the crushing defeat of \nthe Taira in 1185. The tale divi=\r\ndes into roughly three parts. The \ncentral figure in the first is Taira no =\r\nKiyomori. Arrogant, evil, and \nruthless, he is above all so consumed by the=\r\n fires of hatred for the \nMinamoto that he dies in agony, his feverish body=\r\n beyond all cooling, \neven when he is immersed in water. The main figures o=\r\nf the second and \nthird parts are generals on the Minamoto side, first Mina=\r\nmoto no \nYoshinaka and then, after his death, the heroic Minamoto no Yoshit=\r\nsune, \na youthful military genius wrongly suspected of treachery by his eld=\r\ner \nbrother Minamoto no Yoritomo.\n\nHeike monogatari abounds in stirring sce=\r\nnes of battle, recounting brave \ndeeds by warriors proud of their lineage a=\r\nnd military prowess and \nprizing loyalty above life. Dealing with the catac=\r\nlysmic upheavals of \nthis time of Taira and Minamoto rivalry, it undoubtedl=\r\ny has a grand \nsweep about it that can be described as =93epic.=94 Whether =\r\nit may truly be \ntermed an epic is debatable, principally because of its ly=\r\nrical and \nemotional content. Several episodes about tragic lovers or love =\r\naffairs \nhave an atmosphere redolent of the mono no aware of Heian court \nl=\r\niterature. Also, the emphasis throughout is very much on the pathos of \nthe=\r\n situation of the Taira, a warrior family that rose to importance at \ncourt=\r\n, only to be forced out by uncouth rivals from eastern Japan. The \natmosphe=\r\nre of the whole work is permeated by the Buddhist doctrine that \nall human =\r\nactivity is ephemeral and illusory, that the mighty are soon \ncast down, an=\r\nd that nothing avails but faith in the grace of the Buddha \nAmida.\n\nSuch Bu=\r\nddhist sentiments are not uncommon in the literature of the \ntime, but the =\r\nreason for their prominence in Heike monogatari is that \nthose responsible =\r\nfor the development of this work were chanters (biwa \nhoshi), lute-playing =\r\npriests who traveled the country reciting this and \nother chronicles. They =\r\nwere blind men who used no fixed text but rather \nrecreated the work at eac=\r\nh performance on the basis of oral formulae. \nThe original Heike text, dati=\r\nng from the early 13th century, comprises \nmaterial from various sources, i=\r\nncluding oral tales about the wars, \nsome of which may have been first told=\r\n as religious rituals for the \nbenefit of the dead warriors. From the mid-1=\r\n3th century, two traditions \ndeveloped. One was a line of texts for silent =\r\nreading, culminating \ninGempei seisuiki, and the other was a line of texts =\r\nfor oral chanters, \nwhich contained many passages in the 7-5 syllable rhyth=\r\nm of classical \npoetry. The chanted tradition continued well into the Murom=\r\nachi period, \nbut of all the approximately 100 texts of theHeike, the accep=\r\nted \nstandard is the version dictated by a master Heike performer, Akashi \n=\r\nKakuichi, just before his death in 1371. Heike texts vary not only in \nword=\r\ning but also in content, revealing the development of social \nattitudes and=\r\n ideals of conduct.\n\nHeike monogatari contains so much of varied human inte=\r\nrest that it has \nbeen almost as popular a source for later Japanese writer=\r\ns as has Genji \nmonogatari (Tale of Genji). It has provided material for a =\r\nnumber of No \nplays. Some of these, such as Atsumori, are =93warrior pieces=\r\n,=94 but \nseveral are based on more lyrical episodes about tragic lovers, \n=\r\nparticularly women, such as Gio, Senju, and Kogo.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of t=\r\nhis message have been removed]\n\n\n"
