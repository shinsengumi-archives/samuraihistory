He wanted to replicate his\n&gt; &gt; greatest work but in \n&gt; &gt; keeping with the idea of not putting himself over\n&gt; &gt; his ancestors \n&gt; &gt; planned to finish it in silver instead of gold. \n&gt; &gt; As you point out though, many times it&#39;s the better\n&gt; &gt; story that ends \n&gt; &gt; up becoming the &quot;accepted history&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; The Ginkakuji website states it was because he visited\n&gt; the Rokuonji (the official name of the Kinkakuji) on\n&gt; an inspection and decided to copy the design. Mentions\n&gt; nothing about covering it in silver, which I still\n&gt; find odd. When I can get on a computer that I can\n&gt; search in Japanese, I&#39;ll look more. I&#39;d just like to\n&gt; see something besides Turnbull and &quot;every source I&#39;ve read&quot;...\n \nYou might want to read &#39;Yoshimasa and the silver pavilion&#39; by \nDonald Keene (Columbia University Press). This book is about \n(probably) the worst shogun in Japanese history, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, \nwho had a great impact on Japanese culture as it is known today. He \nwas a patron for many Japanese artists. Whether No, cha-no-yu, \ncalligraphy or Waka (for which Yoshimasa seems to have had a \ntalent). The book doesn&#39;t mention that the Ginkaku-ji was supposed \nto be decorated (or covered) with silver. The name (according to \nKeene) merely is a &#39;reference&#39; (not sure about this term) to \nAshikaga Yoshimitsu&#39;s Kinkaku-ji.\n \nNahless\n \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Read only the mail you want - Yahoo!
