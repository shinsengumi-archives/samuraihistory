Co=\r\nntrary to popular belief, and often overlooked by historians, guns did in f=\r\nact make their way into Japan as early as the 1450&#39;s, mainly through Ryukyu=\r\n or to mainland Japan via China and Korea. Although they remained more of a=\r\nn oddity or curio until they were mass produced beginning in the 1540&#39;s, th=\r\nere are accounts of them in Japan long before the introduction by Western t=\r\nraders, which we present to you in this episode. And, for anyone who has ev=\r\ner wondered what the difference is between a musket, matchlock, and arquebu=\r\ns, we&#39;ll give you a concise explanation of the types of firearms in questio=\r\nn.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;So, rather than reinvent the wheel here, I&#39;d recommend a listen to t=\r\nhe above podcast, and then follow up with questions and we&#39;ll do our best t=\r\no answer them. But in a nutshell, yes, guns did arrive in Japan before the =\r\n16th century from China/Korea - just not in sufficient numbers to build an =\r\narsenal, or they were thought of as &quot;curiosities&quot; and not produced in Japan=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dennis Sheridan &lt;ldsheridan@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The Chinese discovered gunpowder in the 9th century.  Do I u=\r\nnderstand\n&gt;&gt; correctly that the Japanese did not acquire this technology un=\r\ntil the mid\n&gt;&gt; 16th century with Portuguese guns? (The route would be from =\r\nChina to Arabia\n&gt;&gt; to Europe and from there all the way back to Japan..  Th=\r\nis is not at all\n&gt;&gt; intuitive.)  Similarly, the Chinese had movable type an=\r\nd a crude printing\n&gt;&gt; press (via India) by the mid 11th c., the Koreans the=\r\n same 3 centuries later\n&gt;&gt; and apparently the Japanese even later than that=\r\n.  Given the geographical\n&gt;&gt; juxtaposition, the treaties, diplomatic missio=\r\nns, the trade, and countless\n&gt;&gt; other factors, I am completely mystified th=\r\nat a technological advance by one\n&gt;&gt; country would not be almost immediatel=\r\ny adopted by the other two.  I demand\n&gt;&gt; an explanation.  (But if that is i=\r\nmpolite I meekly beg one.)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -d\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Ride wanted, off planet.
