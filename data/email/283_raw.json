While I*am*not a historian I do love\na\n| good book on history.\n\nBut I see a couple of reasons for this.  One, you don&#39;t have as many people\ntrained in Japanese history in the West as say European or American history.\nYour pool of potential writers is much smaller.\n\nSecond, for the authors you list above, while writing good introductory\nbooks, these would not necessarily make tenure committees or promotion\ncommittees happy.  In fact, one could advance the thesis that the more\npopular and well received a non-fiction book is by\nthe general public, the less academics will like it.\n\nThird, is there a market for books as you want on medieval Japanese history?\nPublishing is a money making enterprise and most publishers seem to shy away\nfrom books that don&#39;t sell well over 10,000 copies.\n\nLater, Mark Hall\n\n\n\n"
