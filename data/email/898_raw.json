Your email wasn&#39;t very clear to\nme, but if I decyphered it correctly, that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. Daito\nryu is the original art that became Aikido.\nThe art originally belonged to the Fujiwara family as a form of Sumo.\nIt was later altered by Minamoto Yoshimitsu and Minamoto Yoshiie to include\ncertain joint locks, pressue points, etc, as discovered by their seemingly\nsadistic interests in human anatomy during the aftermath of battle, and\nlikely also through verbal transmission by other high ranking members of\nother clans that might have been friendly to the Minamoto family, though\nthat is only speculation on my part.\nThe son of Minamoto Yoshimitsu is believed to have moved to the province of\nKai, taking on the name Takeda.\nThe Daito Ryu art has been transmitted by the Takeda family from that time\nuntil our most recent century when Takeda Sokaku charged his son to give the\nart to the world to preserve it.\nOne student of Sokaku by the name of Oueshiba (spelling? Sorry folks),\ninclined towards the spiritual aspects of martial arts, softened the\noriginal battlefield art into a 20th century version of self defense that\nonly broke bones instead outright killing people.\nReal soft.\nBut do your search on &quot;Daito Ryu&quot;. You might find what you&#39;re looking for.\n\nAlex\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Francisco Manuel Luna Zapata&quot; &lt;swarzdraken@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, June 04, 2002 11:48 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Kyudo\n\n\n&gt; HELLO ALL OF THE GROUP:\n&gt;\n&gt; I WROTE THIS MAIL IF CAN HELP ME TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ANCIENTE\n&gt; MARTIAL ART PRACTICATED BY THE SAMURAYS; MY TARGET IS CAN TO MADE MY SELF\n&gt; BOW SO THAT COULDTO PRACTICE WITH MY SENSEI OF AIKIDO.\n&gt;\n&gt; ALL THTE INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN SEND ME, I THANKS FULL YOU.\n&gt;\n&gt; THANKS\n&gt; FRANCISCO MANUEL LUNA ZAPATA\n&gt; FROM COLOMBIA\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; �nase con MSN Hotmail al servicio de correo electr�nico m�s grande del\n&gt; mundo. http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
