It has been dubed \nthe =\r\nKeeper of Karate&#39;s Highest tradition, that tradition is Bushido. \nMaster Oh=\r\nta the head of our association JKA England says that the way of \nthe samura=\r\ni has a direct influence on Karate. The Okinawan&#39;s despite \nseeing themselv=\r\nes as a seperate nation to the Japanese for a long time, \nwere Samurai. Mas=\r\nter Funakoshi developer of the Shotokan style was a son \nof a Samurai. It i=\r\ns a common misconception that Karate is nothing to do \nwith the Samurai, du=\r\ne to the more common sport Karate. However if you \nstudy Bushido, Zen and t=\r\nraditional Karate as I do then you will see the \nSamurai influence. As an A=\r\nnglo-Japanese myself this is very important \nto me, I hope you can find mor=\r\ne information on the Samurai and Zen. But \nnever take the martial arts at f=\r\nace value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n ALL-NEW Yahoo!
