I have \nstudied with some of the best professors in the US. They made me read \ndozens of books about Japanese history (especially about the &quot;medieval&quot; \nperiod) written by all the greatest japanologists of the 20th century - \nincluding the whole Cambridge History of Japan. I have read thousands \nand thousands of pages...\n\nWell, I don&#39;t remember ONE WORD about ninjas.\nMay be that they&#39;re not so important in Japanese HISTORY?\n\nCheers,\ncepo\n\nPS = Anyway, I loved the Old Ninja in Samurai Fiction... the ones in \nLast Samurai, instead,  were baaaad: they all got killed, some of them \nby Tom Cruise - what a bunch of morons!! \n\n\n"
