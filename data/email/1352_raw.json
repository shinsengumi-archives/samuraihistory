This\nincluded 2 swords by Gassan Sadakazu and Gassan\nSadakatsu. The Sadakatsu was made to commemorate the\nbirth of emperor Akihito.\n\nMy favourite was the Nagamaki Naoshi which was\nconverted to a katana. Made in around 1300, it had a\ndotanuki  style kissaki.\n\nMany of you have privately had photos from me before,\nbut to save recieving and sending laods of emails I\nhave put them all into zipped files on my web site for\nyou to download.\n\nhttp://www.hanako.co.uk/Armouries/Armouries.htm\n\nHave fun with them\n\npaul\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
