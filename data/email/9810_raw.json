I have talked to many japa=\r\nnese people while I lived there. I talked to archaeologist that I worked wi=\r\nth over there and they could not after researching for months. I even conta=\r\ncted Tokyo University. They said that it was 364 years old when they looked=\r\n it up on the imperial records of the imperial bowmaker Shibata Sensi XX. T=\r\nhey even said it was stolen about 200 years ago. But they could not even gi=\r\nve me the name or procounce it. Wether or not the story is true, I do not k=\r\nnow. But could someone please help me out in finding its name. I believe it=\r\n has a soul just like a katana and would like to honor it by calling the yu=\r\nmi by its name. thank you all very much. Also I have been researching for a=\r\nbout three years now. The Yumi pictures are in the Photos under Yumi and As=\r\nano Family Clan Kimono. Again thank you all for your help in this matter. \n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nOta =\r\nnyt k=E4ytt=F6=F6si uuden sukupolven Windows Live palvelut!\nhttp://get.live=\r\n.com\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
