Because before the\nSword Hunt, the distinction between farmers and samurai was blurred. In fact\nFumazawa Banzin refers to the period before the &quot;sword hunt&quot; in writing\nabout possible reforms; he believed that the country would be better off\nadopting the &quot;farmer-soldier&quot; model that existed before the rigid separation\nwas made. \n \nAs for &quot;buying&quot; samurai status during the Edo period. This sometimes\nhappened, particularly near the end of the period. A merchant family could\noffer their son to be married into a samurai family; the merchant son is\n&quot;adopted&quot; as the heir in marrying the samurai family&#39;s daughter. \n \nSome of Sakamoto Ryoma&#39;s ancestors acquired samurai status that way,\naccording to the biographies of his life that I&#39;ve read.\n \nNina \n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 9:26 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Our &quot;welcoming&quot; attitude\n\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Yeah, well there is also the prevailing and very\n&gt; mistaken idea that farmers\n&gt; or tradesmen could &quot;become samurai.&quot;\n  \n \nPrior to the Class seperation edicts (Sword hunt, et\nal) they COULD.  \n \n[snips]\n \nThe problem with your statement is it&#39;s very much a\nproduct of the tail end of the Sengoku and the Edo\nperiod. Especially from the Onin on, anyone with the\nright breaks and a set of iron...fists...could become\na samurai. Saito Dosan either was, or was the son of,\nan oil seller, depending on which author you read. Ise\nShinkuro (later Hojo Soun) rises up practically from\nout of nowhere. Most of Hideyoshi&#39;s close retainers\n(Kato Kiyomasa, for example) came from the same Owari\npeasant villages he did--in fact, it&#39;s celebrated in\nNagoya&#39;s Nakamura-ku, which used to be the village of\nNakamura, where Hideyoshi and Kiyomasa both were born.\n\n\nCould status be bought, like in Shogun? Not\nreally--not that way. A rich farmer could possibly\nhave been adopted into an impoverished samurai family\nand thereby &quot;made&quot; samurai, but I couldn&#39;t tell you if\nI&#39;ve ever come across that. It sounds too dramatic to\nme. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
