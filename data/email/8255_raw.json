What does it mean? I tried to research it and the only \n&gt; thing I could find was that it was a symbol of suicide??????? I am \n&gt; watching a Korean drama called Yi Soon-shin. It took place on this \n&gt; drama. I know it must have significant meaning... \n&gt; Thank you for your time!!!!!!!!\n&gt;Hey man im not acactlly sure what it means,but i think its a sigh that \nthere a samurai and that that the ponytail is a symbol of honor of \ntrained samurai i think im not sure ill have to look for u someime. if \nu find out tell me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
