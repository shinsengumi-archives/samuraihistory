I&#39;m only asking because I participate\nin my own small form of Japanese recreation and I&#39;d\nlike to look as authentic as possible, since I fall\nway short of looking even the least bit asian.\n\n\n--- Eponymous13@... wrote:\n&gt; LOL.  Question: Am I correct in assuming that the\n&gt; top knot of which we speak \n&gt; is a general part of Japan&#39;s history and not unique\n&gt; to either Samurai or Sumo? \n&gt;  Just asking.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tim\n&gt; Department of Inane, (and most likely,) Stupid\n&gt; Questions.\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
