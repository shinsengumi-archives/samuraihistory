However, I think it&#39;s\nperfectly feasible for samurai to be wearing older\npieces up until the end of the Sengoku. Reasons would\ninclude a. the ability to show off possesion of an\nantique armor or b. inability to buy something better.\nIn case a you&#39;re looking at upper level daimyo that\nmay not ever be in combat, so it&#39;s nice to look\npretty. In case b, he probably can&#39;t afford anything\nmore, so he&#39;s making due with battle spoils or cheaper\nold stuff. \n\nMake sense?\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
