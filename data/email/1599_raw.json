But as far as I know (which isn&#39;t much), the most documented\n&gt;would be any of the major warlords: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and\n&gt;Tokugawa Ieyasu certainly would be on that list, as well might be the Date,\n&gt;Takeda and Uesugi warlords and the Mori possibly.  Thats about the best I \n&gt;can\n&gt;do, but maybe someone else has more answers than I do.\n&gt;\n&gt;Later.\n&gt;T\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
