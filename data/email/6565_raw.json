Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; First:\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are going to change the subject of the\n&gt; thread, please start a new one and\n&gt; retitle the thread.\n\nThis time you beat ME to it. Please, people--change\nthe thread name if you change the subject. Here&#39;s why:\nsome people here are only interested in certain\nsubjects. If person A is an expert on Saito Dosan and\nknows everything about him, but has no interest in\nKawanakajima, he may not even open the email asking\nabout Dosan&#39;s kids since he doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s\nabout. Clarity is the key to getting the answers you\nseek.\n\n&gt; Second:\n&gt; \n&gt; His adopted son was Yoshitatsu, who rebelled against\n&gt; him.\n&gt; He also had three natural sons. They were Magoshirou\n&gt; (¹��Ϻ), Nagatatsu (Ĺζ),\n&gt; and Kiheiji (��ʿ��). Magoshirou and Kiheiji were\n&gt; younger than Yoshitatsu, and\n&gt; he killed them. Nagatatsu died with Nobunaga&#39;s son\n&gt; at Nijo in Kyoto during\n&gt; Mitsuhide&#39;s Honnoji attack.\n&gt; He had at least one daughter; his daughter (name\n&gt; unclear) married Nobunaga.\n\nWasn&#39;t his daughter&#39;s name Kitsuno? That was\nNobunaga&#39;s wife&#39;s name. \n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nAll your favorites on one personal page � Try My Yahoo!\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
