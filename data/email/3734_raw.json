Adaption is a common way of all biolagical critters...but\nselling out involves monetary or other similar compensation - \n\nKanji - yes, they found that the Chinese had a functional writing\nsystem and adopted it - but remember that they added verb ending usage\nto a Chinese system that used none...How was that a sellout? What\ncountry did your particular writing system come from?\n\nBuddhism - remember that they added a tollerance for other religions\nthat strict Buddhism from India did not espouse...\nThey had indigionous religious systems and simply added Buddhism to\nthe pile - they did not replace their religions...(I am also a\nBuddhist, but that is a side note...\n\nAirplanes - quite post-period, but if it is pertanent, I ask you off\nlist to write me and inform me of what Japanese only improvements did\nthey add to the basic idea of aircraft?\nElectronics? Again, post period and beyond this list&#39;s discussion\nprotocal...\n\n\n&gt;&gt; In a way, getting rid of the samurai was a very Japanese thing to do.\n\nI just do not get this part of your post - Getting rid of Samurai\nmight be a result of the possible history lines that Japan might have\nchosen, as any country with a cast system might have done - but I do\nnot understand your reference to it being a &quot;very Japanese&quot; thing to\ndo... Assimilating - yes, I can see that...Purging - that depended\nmore on circumstance, rather that a national requirement...\n\nYour argument seems to be self contradictory...\nPlease illuminate for us...\nNo offence - I am just curious...\nChristopher...\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, golfmandan@a... wrote:\n&gt; The Japanese have always been &quot;sellouts&quot; in a certain way. That&#39;s\npart of what makes them so uniquely, well, Japanese. What I mean is\nthat one of Japan&#39;s strong points has been their ability to take parts\nof other cultures and adapt them to their own use, usually improving\nupon them in the process. Whether it&#39;s kanji, or buddhism, or\nairplanes, or electronics... the japanese have a knack for learning\nfrom other cultures. Yeah, they might be &quot;losing&quot; something in the\nprocess, but that&#39;s just part of the inevitable evolution that all\ncultures undergo. Speaking of which, the loss of the samurai class is\npart of that process. In a way, getting rid of the samurai was a very\nJapanese thing to do. LOL. The thing that WASN&#39;T very Japanese-like\nwas their attempt at isolationism practiced before the Meiji restoration. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Anyway we should note that Mishima was not really looking for\nmilitarism, but a \n&gt; &gt; returnto Japan&#39;s past, what he felt made Japan uniquely Japanese.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; is that really such a bad thing?? Im gonna have to mve to Japan in\na few years.. \n&gt; &gt; at first I was not looking foreward to it, mostly bcos I dont\nspeak the \n&gt; &gt; language.. but many ppl have been telling me I&#39;ll do just fine\nthat they are \n&gt; &gt; very westernized and most ppl, especially the younger ones (in my\nage backet) \n&gt; &gt; speak english.. (on a side note, according to the NY times Wed.\nOct 23, \n&gt; &gt; 2002..&quot;To Grandparents english word trend isnt naissu&quot;) *hooray I\nactually have \n&gt; &gt; a refference* the Japanese are adopting English words into their\nown language.. \n&gt; &gt; History, tradition and a sense of who I am culturaly is really\nimportant to me.. \n&gt; &gt; so on one hand I was pretty relieved to hear that they are\nwesternizing and that \n&gt; &gt; I will get along fine over there, but on the other hand, I feel\nsorry bcos in a \n&gt; &gt; way they are loosing that.. it seems Mishima was in his\nown....whacko little \n&gt; &gt; way, was just trying to point this out to ppl.. does anyone else\nnot see this or \n&gt; &gt; see modern Japan as being &quot;sell outs&quot; in a way??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wilson\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Find what you are looking for with the Lycos Yellow Pages\n&gt; &gt;\nhttp://r.lycos.com/r/yp_emailfooter/http://yellowpages.lycos.com/default.asp?SRC\n&gt; &gt; =lycos10\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; --- \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
