Since discovering Rurouni \nKenshin we have been amazed at the attention to historical fact \ninvolved with this series. We have just started becoming interested \nin the Samurai histories but can find no info on this group of \nmisunderstood Samurai. Any help will be appreciated and reciprocated. \nKei and I are somewhat of an expert on anime in general and Lovely \nAngels/Dirty Pair in particular as well as romanji script in Japanese \nand its English translations. We also collect lyrics in both \nlanguages and download music and video for animes too. Domo arigato \nfor your assistances. Keiman and Kei.\n\n\n"
