He was on the small boat and =\r\nmade a bokken (later \n&gt; called suburito) from an oar?\n&gt; \n&gt; On the movie sta=\r\nrring Mifune, he was actually bringing his sword but he \n&gt; picked an oar to=\r\n use for the duel as he was asked by the boat-man, why \n&gt; do you make a bok=\r\nken and not use your sword? Musashi said: &quot;I like the \n&gt; size&quot;. While other=\r\n source on website saying the Musashi actually forgot \n&gt; his sword and he h=\r\nad to make a bokken from an oar.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the excerpt from the site: &quot;M=\r\nusashi Miyamoto, arguably Japan&#39;s \n&gt; greatest swordsman, overslept one morn=\r\ning. He was due to meet one of\nhis \n&gt; many challengers and was already runn=\r\ning late. As he bolted from his\nbed \n&gt; to the door, he, incredibly, forgot =\r\nhis sword!! Hastily, he boarded the \n&gt; small boat that was to take him to a=\r\n small island (sandbar) where his \n&gt; armed opponent awaited him anxiously. =\r\nRealizing his predicament along \n&gt; the way, he grabbed one of the boat&#39;s oa=\r\nrs and, with a small knife, \n&gt; began whittling a crudely-shaped katana from=\r\n it. Arriving at his \n&gt; destination, Musashi greeted his adversary. The man=\r\n laughed and \n&gt; confidently drew his weapon and attacked the awaiting Musas=\r\nhi. With a \n&gt; swift series of graceful movements, Musashi expertly defended=\r\n himself \n&gt; and quickly dispatched the over-zealous opponent by crushing hi=\r\ns \n&gt; skull!!! ... and so was born the Suburito.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The question is, did =\r\nMusashi actually forget his sword and have to make \n&gt; a bokken from an oar =\r\nor did he actually like the size of the oar and \n&gt; prefer using it to using=\r\n his sword?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Totok Sudarijanto\n&gt; http://www.mjer.org\n&gt; ema=\r\nil: totok.sudarijanto@m...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The ultimate aim of martial arts is not ha=\r\nving to use them.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\nI would recomend a book i just recently read, its ca=\r\nlled:\nThe Lone Samurai, The life of Miyamoto Musashi. \nWriten by WIlliam Sc=\r\nott Wilson.\n\nIt covers a lot of the aspects of Musashi&#39;s live from his duel=\r\ns to his\nskills in painting. It also mentioned conflicting informations etc=\r\n.\n\nIf you like to read more about the real man thats a place to start.\n\nQin=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
