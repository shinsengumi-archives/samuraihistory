Apparently some Imagawa records mention it.  The Koyogunkan \nbasicaly says (and I am getting this from a source that quotes it, \nnot from the source itself - my copy of the KoyoGunKan is who knows \nwhere....) that Nobutora plotted to dispose of Harunobu (shingen) and \nhave his second son Nobushige succeed him, however Harunobu found out \nabout the plot, and vassals loyal to him assisted in driving Nobutora \nout, causing him to flee to Suruga.  Obviously, it doesnt mention \nImagawa&#39;s hand in the affair, but since the KoyoGunKan was written by \nvassals of Shingen after his death, it makes sense that they would \nwant it to look like Shingen did it on his own.  The historical \nrecords are obviously not very clear, but it seems safe to assume \nthat Yoshimoto had a hand in Shingen&#39;s succession to head of the \nTakeda clan.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Edward Alexander \n&lt;edyhiphop@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yoshimoto was a big part in overthrowing Nobutora and helping \nShingen to be the head of the clan!!!!!!!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Edy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@s...&gt; wrote:To add slightly to the \nbelow, I did some minor research at the local \n&gt; library, and found that most books basically give no info other \n&gt; than &quot;Shingen overthrew his father in a bloodless coup&quot;.  I did \nfind \n&gt; one more books that went into more detail.  It almost seemed to be \na \n&gt; combination of the two theories, stating that After the attack on \n&gt; Unno Munetsuna, for some reason they went to Suruga, and \n&gt; unfortunately I couldnt read the key kanji in the key sentence, but \n&gt; it seemed to be something about Nobutora going to Yoshimoto to \n&gt; discuss the boarder between Kai and Suruga province, at which time \nhe \n&gt; is retired in favor of shingen.  So it appears that Yoshimoto had \n&gt; some hand in it, but it still is pretty inconclusive.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\n&gt; listowner@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I have been researching exactly how Shingen overthrew his father, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; actually came up with two different versions of events.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The first version goes roughly like this:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; in the 5th month of 1541, Harunobu (shingen) and his father \n&gt; Nobutora \n&gt; &gt; attack Unno Munetsuna in Shinano.  By the sixth month, the battle \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; won, and Munetsuna flees the province.  They depart for Kai on \n6/4, \n&gt; &gt; and on the journey back, on 6/14, Shingen, along with his \nAshigaru, \n&gt; &gt; drive Nobutora off, and he was forced to flee to Imagawa \nYoshimoto, \n&gt; &gt; in Suruga (Yoshimoto was married to one of Nobutora&#39;s daughters).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The second version goes like this:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the 6th month of 1541, Nobutora and Harunobu (shingen) went to \n&gt; &gt; visit Nobutora&#39;s daughter, who was married to Imagawa Yoshimoto, \nin \n&gt; &gt; Suruga province.  Little did Nobutora know, Yoshimoto and Shingen \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; plotted against him. When they got there, Nobutora was forcibly \n&gt; &gt; retired in favor of Shingen, and he was put under the &quot;patronage&quot; \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; Yoshimoto.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not sure why there are two versions, one seems to come from \na \n&gt; &gt; specific historical record, maybe the other comes from more than \n&gt; one \n&gt; &gt; sources.  does anyone know which is more likely?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
