Osprey have a\nnasty habit of reprinting old books with new covers - thus giving the\nimpression that the book is new - or combining several old Ospreys into one,\nlarger so-called &#39;new&#39; one. I mailed Stephen Turnbull twice via his web page\naddress for more information, but he hasn&#39;t bothered to reply!\nThanks for the update\nMichael\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;murphymurphyjohn@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, November 30, 2003 8:15 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: TO ALL HANDS/ TURNBULL ALERT----resp\nProfMurf: -------.TITLE\n\n\n&gt; Turnbull&#39;s new book is Samurai:  The World of the Warrior:  Uncloak the\n&gt; Mysteries of the Orient.  The book is $29.95 but is on sale at Barnes &\nNoble on\n&gt; the Web at $17.95,  40 % off the cover.  This is the first week the book\nis in\n&gt; the stores too, so it appears B & N is not suspecting high sales.
