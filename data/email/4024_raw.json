I think the problem here is the definition of honour. This word is used frequently but I think that a lot of time it is used in the wrong context. I&#39;m not sure if there is no honour in war or not. Perhaps it is the right hting to do but not honourable. It&#39;s hard to say until I have an exact definintion of the word.\nTHanks\nJonny\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nKyle Segall &lt;klancesegall@...&gt; wrote:Yeah.
