Its involvement in the transision between\nkatana and Tachi i am not sure of.\n\nwe are also aware that in the early the days the\nsamurai were men of horse and the bow, this then with\ntime and change in the way battles were fought had the\nsamuari also go to fighting on foot, theref ore the\nbow was reduced in status and corps of archers\nappeared be it samurai or ashigaru. The Yari (spear)\nthen came into favour as the primary wepaon of choice\non the battle field. Of course when the fighting got\nhand to hand the yari was of no use and then the sowrd\ncame into play.\n\nIn my martial arts training I do a lot of sword and in\nmy dojo we are currently doing Yari. I also own a suit\nof armour which I train in occasionally. here are some\npoints I discovered when i first wore the armour.\n\nthe tachi is fine but to draw downwards when in arm\nyou have to bend a bit and the draw is slow. therefore\nturning the sword cutting edge up the draw was faster\nand the bending of the body  removed.\n\nthe tachi when moving about a lot and especially when\nrunning bangs up and down against you constantly. This\nwas annoying and you had to hold it if you wanted to\nkeep control of it\n\nA katana is nice and tight to the body, much easier to\ndraw. \n\ntachi work just fine two handed for those hwo have\nnever handled one.\n\nPaul\n\n\n--- Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nPerhaps the tachi was worn edge down so as to make\nspace for the bowstring to be drawn and released?\nJust a thought I had, but I would think that a large\nkatana tsuka would get in the way especially when\nshooting to your left,\nbut then again I could be wrong. Timewise the katana\nwas replacing the tachi at the same time that the bow\nwas falling out \nof favor, thoughts anyone?\n\nDave Jackson\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Josh Wilson \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, November 19, 2003 7:31 AM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] TACHI\n\n\n  Yes, the tachi can be used in fights.. it was\noriginally developed as a cavalry sword.. the longer\nblade and more pronounced curve were designed to be\nused form horseback.. much like the western examples\nof a saber in comparisson to the rapier.. the tachi\nwas worn blade down whereas the katana was worn blade\nup.. the difference was that when you drew the tachi\nfrom horseback, the first draw would be a slice.. and\nthe katana&#39;s first draw would be a slice as well, if\nworn blade down.. as far as dates, it seems that the\ntachi may be a predeccessor to the katana, but I am\nNOT sure..\n\n  Wilson\n\n\n  --\n\n  --------- Original Message ---------\n  DATE: Tue, 18 Nov 2003 01:31:43\n  From: &quot;Syun Ukiya&quot; &lt;squartzph@...&gt;\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Cc: \n\n  I&#39;ve been wondering about the Tachi, its different\nfrom the usual \n  katana type sword. And bit elegant too in terms of\nlooks. Can Tachi \n  be used in fights? And the timeline of the tachi\nco-existed with the \n  Katana or it came after the Katana?\n\n\n\n  Yahoo!
