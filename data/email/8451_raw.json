Irish Kee\n\nPersonally, both are easy. However, I&#39;ve determined\nI&#39;ve got some rare form of dyslexia which only\nmanifests itself when I&#39;m forced to tell the diffence\nbetween the &quot;tsu&quot;, &quot;shi&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; in katakana.\nFor whatever reason, my brain goes into some sort of\n&quot;katakana brain freeze&quot; when I&#39;m confronted with a\nword I&#39;m not used to seeing in katakana/unfamiliar\nwith. For instance, if I see &quot;���肪�Ƃ�&quot; (Arigatou)\nin hiragana, I just read it, as easily as an English\nword, since it&#39;s normally written in hiragana and I\nrecognize it. It&#39;s just like you don&#39;t have to sound\nout &quot;th-a-n-k...y-ou&quot; when you read it. However if I\nsee it in katakana: �A���K�g�E, my brain locks up, and\nI have to sound it out. \n\nThis is likely just a personal issue--my wife says I&#39;m\nkatakana challenged. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
