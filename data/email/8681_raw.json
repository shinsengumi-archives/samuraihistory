I found a copy at Maruzen\n&gt; &gt;Sendai\n&gt; &gt; &gt;on my recent trip back to the land of the Rising Yen. I read it on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;return flight and was very impressed. We all MUST have this. It is\n&gt; &gt;truly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;very good, very clear and readable, and handsomely produced. In fact, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;have been meaning to post some comments about the volume on this list,\n&gt; &gt;but\n&gt; &gt; &gt;you know how best intentions are. I also am writing this without the\n&gt; &gt;book\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in front of me - since you brought it up - so I won&#39;t be able to give\n&gt; &gt; &gt;chapter and verse, but...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       The book covers the polishing process and explains the role and\n&gt; &gt;use\n&gt; &gt; &gt;of the sequence of stones etc. It also covers the design of the\n&gt; &gt;polishers\n&gt; &gt; &gt;work station - even allowing for some adjustments that OSHA might\n&gt; &gt;approve\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and traditionalists abhor! It has good treatments of the styles and\n&gt; &gt;kinds\n&gt; &gt; &gt;of polish that are the best I&#39;ve ever read. There is also a good\n&gt; &gt;section on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;how bends and twists are handled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Having said all those nice things, there are 3 issues that I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;remember\n&gt; &gt; &gt;thinking were under treated. First, I would have like more on the\n&gt; &gt;nature\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and origin of the various stones. There is not even a description of\n&gt; &gt;how\n&gt; &gt; &gt;they are marketed and where they can be bought. Second, I felt that\n&gt; &gt;shape\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is addressed too briefly. There is also nothing (really) about how the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;polisher can, should and might deal with ji-niku. This is the issue\n&gt; &gt;that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;has been claimed by experts as the variable that anyone but experts can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;screw-up. Yet in this book, it is not addressed. I think the term is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;defined, but there is no description. Finally, the whole issue of kizu\n&gt; &gt;and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;kizu control is ignored. Again, I think there might be a definition in\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;glossary, but the text says NOTHING about how a polisher deals with\n&gt; &gt;flaws.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;We all know that a polisher can enhance weak hamon and flatten fukure,\n&gt; &gt;but\n&gt; &gt; &gt;nothing is said about that kind of work or issues like hako-bori\n&gt; &gt;removal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Maybe those &quot;secrets&quot; are too valuable to publish.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       This is a book for sword collectors and we all need it. I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;see\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it as anywhere close to a &quot;how-to book&quot;. I assume that some people will\n&gt; &gt;try\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to use it in that way, but it is primarily a description of the craft\n&gt; &gt;of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;polishing. When it does show up on this side of the Pacific, you will\n&gt; &gt;find\n&gt; &gt; &gt;enjoy it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Peter Bleed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Professor of Anthropology\n&gt; &gt; &gt;810 Oldfather Hall\n&gt; &gt; &gt;University of Nebraska\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Lincoln, NE 68588-0368\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(402) 472-2439\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt; &gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
