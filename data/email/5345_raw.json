Again, the difference between &quot;rank&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;ranking&quot;. \n\nTHat&#39;s why I try to distinguish the difference between HAVING and HOLDING rank. \nUnfortunately, that&#39;s a point too fine for some people to get, unless they are \nalready familiar with the difference in concept and terminology between the two.\n\n&gt; You can&#39;t even use\n&gt; translations of the words the Japanese used, because\n&gt; as has been said, General (Taisho) A may command 300\n&gt; troops, whereas General B commands 30,000. \n\nTHat&#39;s why I like to vary terminology when talking about the same character \n(&quot;Honda Tadakatsu was one of Ieyasu&#39;s most trusted lieutenants.... Tadakatsu was \na valiant captain.... As a general, Tadakatsu was fearless and totally \nreliable....&quot;). Note that all of these uses are occupational (job terms), as \nwhile I can say &quot;the general, Tadakatsu&quot; but not once could I say &quot;General \nTadakatsu.&quot; It either removes the idea of rank right away, or confuses the hell \nout of people who don&#39;t get it.\n\n\n&gt; In the context of the question, yes it is. If we were\n&gt; talking social rank, or &quot;importance&quot;, then yes, that\n&gt; changes things. But the poster asked if there were\n&gt; military ranks ala the modern system. The answer is\n&gt; no. While a taisho may &quot;outrank&quot; an ashigaru, that\n&gt; makes neither &quot;taisho&quot; or &quot;ashigaru&quot; a rank. If you&#39;re\n&gt; an assembly line worker, someone in corporate\n&gt; management obviously &quot;outranks&quot; you in the context of\n&gt; your company. However, your &quot;rank&quot; isn&#39;t Factory\n&gt; Worker, and his isn&#39;t &quot;Middle Manager&quot;. Those are\n&gt; jobs--one is &quot;higher&quot; than the other, but they aren&#39;t\n&gt; ranks. \n\nBingo. (Bungo. Echizen...)\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
