As for a feel of the genre I have been \nwatc=\r\nhing Kurosawa films, but I&#39;m also eyeing Yoshikawa&#39;s &quot;Musashi&quot; \n(that is se=\r\nt is the same timeframe). \n\nFor references these are the ones I have come u=\r\np so far that have \ngrabbed my attention:\n\n&quot;Sekigahara 1600&quot; - also set in =\r\nthe timeframe I&#39;m looking for, and I \nwould also like some insight into sam=\r\nurai battle strategies. This \nbook apparently has this; do anyone here own =\r\nthe book?\n\n&quot;Samurai Warfare&quot; - again, a good insight into samurai....well, =\r\n\nwarfare. \n\n&quot;Samurai Warlords&quot; and other Turnbull books.\n\n&quot;Musashi&quot; - as yo=\r\nu said, a feel for the genre.\n\np.d. I wanted to know the meaning of the nam=\r\ne &quot;Iwamura&quot; in case I can \napply a metaphorical meaning to it. The meaning =\r\nturns out to be \nperfect (Rock village) for the story...in this way I would=\r\n like to \nfind out meanings on other names, to make them &quot;fit&quot; the characte=\r\nr \n(another one is Makoto, which I believe means &quot;honor&quot;).\n\nMiburo Sam \n\n\n-=\r\n-- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;William&Mikiko Letham&quot; \n&lt;mickey.leth=\r\nam@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; .&quot; In what year did Tokugawa Ieyasu pass the edict that a=\r\nllied lords\n&gt; had to spend some time in or near Edo?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Sankin Kotai=\r\n system was a gradual process that developed over \nthe reigns\n&gt; of Ieyasu, =\r\nHidetada, and Iemitsu. Most of the regulations were \nestablished\n&gt; by Iemit=\r\nsu in the 1630&#39;s. For more info you might check out a \nbook &#39;Feudal\n&gt; Contr=\r\nol in Tokugawa Japan&#39; by Toshio Tsukahira. It will give you \nthe whole\n&gt; hi=\r\nstory of the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;. How much time did they have to spend there&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; It depended on the Daimyo. Most spent one year. Some for example the\n&gt; M=\r\natsumae of Ezo, because of the distance, were exempt from \nattendance.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Where did these lords stay? A kind of &quot;guest&quot; castle, or where...?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThey had there own permanent residence (sometimes even two). \nRemember the\n=\r\n&gt; Daimyo went back and forth to his domain but his family always \nlived in =\r\nEdo.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I would like to know what does Iwamura mean (or perhaps Iwa and =\r\n\nmura\n&gt; separated, I think it has\n&gt; to do something about a hawk?)&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It=\r\n depends on what kanji you use to write it. There are two \nhistorical\n&gt; fam=\r\nilies by that name both written as =E5=B2=A9=E6=9D` which can be \ntranslate=\r\nd as &#39;rock\n&gt; village&#39;. I wouldn&#39;t however worry to much about the meaning o=\r\nf the \nname.\n&gt; Most samurai names were taken from the place they settled in=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the other questions I can&#39;t answer offhand but again check \no=\r\nur\n&gt; Tsukihiras tome.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are writing historical fiction may I sugg=\r\nest some writers \nthat may\n&gt; give you a feel for the genre. Ryotaro Shiba, =\r\nEiji Yoshikawa, Kunio \nTsuji,\n&gt; Shotaro Ikenami, Masuji Ibuse, Shusaku Endo=\r\n. All of these have some \nworks\n&gt; translated into English.\n\n\n"
