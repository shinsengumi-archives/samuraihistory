I&#39;d completely forgotten\n&gt; that.  That was the only\n&gt; Japanese poet whose name I could remember, and I\n&gt; didn&#39;t think it was he.\n\nYup, that was him. I haven&#39;t read it, so I just know\nhe wrote it, and the only other thing I remember about\nhim is that he wrote the &quot;frog/pond&quot; haiku that is so\noften quoted. That, and he seems to be the &quot;George\nWashington&quot; of Japan, in the sense that there seems to\nbe a &quot;Matsuo Basho slept here&quot; sign in every corner of\nthe country.\n\n&gt; And I\n&gt; agree, I&#39;ve got no desire to emulate Mishima.\n&gt; Personally, he was a nutjob, &gt; \t\tWell, that was\napproximately what I was trying\n&gt; _not_ to say to the party\n&gt; who admired him...\n\nWell, that party is perfectly free to disagree. But\naside from his literary talent, that&#39;s how many\nJapanese see him to, so it&#39;s not just Nate here. \n\n&gt; Murakami Haruki, OTOH...\n&gt; \t\tA name with which I am unfamiliar (one of many, as\n&gt; is obvious by now).  Do\n&gt; tell!\n\nMy favorite Japanese author--modern work, not anything\nto do with samurai or anything, though I think a\nhistorical wourk by him would be absolutely hilarious.\nRanges from absurdist (&quot;A Wild Sheep&#39;s Chase&quot;, &quot;Dance\nDance Dance&quot;, &quot;Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of\nth World&quot;) to the poignant mid-life crisis tale with\njust a touch of the absurd (The Wind-up Bird\nChronicle, Norwegian Wood, South of the Border, West\nof the Sun, Sputnik Sweetheart...) \n\n&quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot; rivals Miyabe\nMiyuki&#39;s &quot;All She was worth&quot; for my favorite book of\nall time. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
