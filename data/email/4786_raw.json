I didn&#39;t found much in the Samurai Archives, nor in other \npages in google.\nCould someone share with me information, or sources of that (pages), \nabout this man? I mean, not only that was the one that lead the \nwestern army at Sekigahara. I mean, about his family, about his \ncareer, love, battles, intrigue, etc.\nThanks in advance.\n\nRodrigo Juri A.\n\n\n"
