This fict=\r\nitious article \nwas designed to lift the moral of the Japanese army; howeve=\r\nr, the \nJapanese newspaper published this story as though it were totally \n=\r\naccurate and true.\n\nOn the 18th December 1947, the Nanking War Crimes Tribu=\r\nnal of China \nsentenced lieutenants Mukai and Noda to execution on the grou=\r\nnds of \nthis false story. The two were shot to death by a firing squad at \n=\r\nYuhuatai, Nankingon the 28th January 1948. \n=81@The family of the bereaved;=\r\n namely the younger sister of lieutenant \nNoda, Mrs. Masa Noda, the eldest =\r\ndaughter of lieutenant Mukai, Mrs. \nEmiko Cooper, and the second daughter M=\r\nrs. Chieko Tadokoro, in fear \nof the general media and press, have since le=\r\nd sad and bitter lives \nfor 50 or so years, labeled as the family of war cr=\r\niminals. However, \ntheir patience eventually wore out and on the 28th April=\r\n 2003, they \nfinally went to the Tokyo District Court having decided to tak=\r\ne their \nfirst and last piece of legal action, demanding the suspension of =\r\n\npublication of certain texts, for official apologies to be published \nin n=\r\newspapers and to claim compensation for damages.\n\n=81@The accused are:\n=81@=\r\n(i)=81@=81@=81@Mainichi Shmnbun, who repeatedly reported untrue story and \n=\r\nwho to this day have yet correct these fallacies or admitted they \nwere fal=\r\nse,\n=81@(ii)=81@ =81@Katsuichi Honda, the author of the books =81gA trip ar=\r\nound \nChina=81h, =81hThe Road to Nanking=81h and=81h Thirteen Lies by the D=\r\neniers \nof the Nanking Massacre=81h, who continues to write how the killing=\r\n, \nwhich has been shown to be false, is true;\n=81@(iii)=81@=81@Asahi Shimbu=\r\nn and Kashiwashobo Publishing Company, who \ncontinue to publish the above m=\r\nentioned in (ii) and other related \ntexts.\n\n=81@The Accuser, Mrs. Chieko Ta=\r\ndokoro and Mr. Yutaka Gohda \n(Representative of the Asian Friendship Associ=\r\nation), friend of chief \nbarrister Mrs. Tomomi Inada, initiated the appeal,=\r\n and with the \nsupport Of =81gThe Society of Answering the Spirits of the W=\r\nar \nHeroes=81h, =81gJapan Conference=81h, =81gJapan Policy Research Centre=\r\n=81h, and \n=81gThe Society of Supporting Lieutenants Mukai and Noda of the =\r\nBattle \nof Nanking=81h, The Society to support the 100- Chinese- soldiers- =\r\n\nkilling-contest case was founded on the 28th June 2003. The Society \nis ma=\r\nde up approximately 500 members.\n\nUnless we win this court case, history te=\r\nxtbooks will continue to \nstate incorrect facts, the press will go unpunish=\r\ned, Japan=81fs erratic \npolicy towards China will stay in the dark and the =\r\nfalse items on \ndisplay in the Memorial Hall of the War Resistance against =\r\nJapan in \nChina will remain on view forever.\n=81@In his article which appea=\r\nred in the Seiron column of the Sankei \nShimbun published on the 15th July,=\r\n 2003 Mr. Keiichiro Kobori, \nAdviser for the Society, writes Quote The stor=\r\ny which appeared in the \nTokyo Nichinichi Shimbun regarding =81g100 solders=\r\n killing contest=81h \nwas totally fictional and a total creation. The lack =\r\nof apology and \nadmission of fallacy from Mr. Asami, writer of the false ar=\r\nticle, \nsince the war, is a serious issue. Many books, including =81gThe \nF=\r\nallacy of the Nanking Massacre=81h written by Akira Suzuki, present \nthe ar=\r\nguments of many historians and researchers explaining how the \nkilling coul=\r\nd never have taken place. =81gKatsuichi Honda=81h, writer for \nAsahi Shimbu=\r\nn, intentionally backed up the lies presented in =81gA trip \naround China=\r\n=81h and does not admit to this.\nHowever, the fact that the Japanese army d=\r\nid not reject the article \nin the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun remains true. Th=\r\nus it is the duty of \nthe former troop members to help rectify and make dis=\r\nappear the shame \nof the whole Japanese army by supporting this case.
