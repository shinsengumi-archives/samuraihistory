A \nkodachi is many things sometimes difficult to distinguish.In \narchaeology, its earliest incarnation was a dagger and several \ndifferent forms of knife were called kodachi. Several different \ncombinations of kanji were used as well. Later kodachi was used to \ndescribe a short katana and then wakizashi as in the usage common in \nKoryu Kenjutsu schools.\n\tIn the world of ART SWORDS, a kodachi is a very specific thing or \nthings; for students of nihonto a kodachi is an early blade in classic \ntachi shape signed in tachi style on the haki-omote but half again (or \nless) smaller in overall proportions. Lacking the tachi signature a \nblade might be called kodachi if mounted in tachi koshirae. However \nsmall blades in elaborate tachi koshirae were made for and used by the \nmembers of the Emperors court, these bejewelled &quot;Kazari&quot;tachi were \nsmall but not meant for real use so there is a distinction drawn.\n\tSo if you are talking kodachi, it helps to keep your audience in mind, \nare we talkin Kofun, kantei, Koryu or Kozure Okami?\n-t\n\n\n"
