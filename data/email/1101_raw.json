Turnbull is one of the most\nACCESSIBLE authors in English, and let&#39;s face it, most\nof us don&#39;t have the Japanese level to read about\nSengoku Jidai history in Japanese. According to the\nArmy, I speak fluent Japanese; ask me to translate\npages from Rekishi Gunzo, it takes me a day per page. \n\nTurnbull definitely is NOT the most academic of\nauthors. If you&#39;ve read more than three of his books,\nyou&#39;ve read the same information at least twice. Many\nof his newer books are rehashes of the same\ninformation, repackaged to sell more titles. I believe\nthat is much of what people are complaining about.\nSome people also feel his information is &quot;dumbed\ndown&quot;. My argument is that very few people want to\nread about the effects of the change from the koku\ntaxation system to the koban taxation system on some\nobscure village in Shikoku. However, most of the\n&quot;academic&quot; authors focus on inane things like this. My\ninterest is military and political history, and aside\nfrom the &quot;classics&quot; like Sansom, Berry, and other\nmentioned, Turnbull is one of the few out there that\nis readable without a degree in Greek. \n\nBottomley & Hopson are EXCELLENT when it comes to\nArmour and weapons development. AJ Bryant is excellent\ntoo. \n\nFor those who complain about Turnbull&#39;s (lack of)\nscholarship: Have you read any nof his newer books?\nEither the Kakure-kirishtan or the one on the Korean\ninvasions? I have not yet (I want the Korean invasion\nbook) but I believe they are probably based a little\nmore on original research than his older books. Again,\nrewrites to get more copies sold, I believe. \n\nThat doesn&#39;t mean his writing is worthless or bad. All\nit means is TONY, YOU NEED TO PUBLISH MORE, to give us\nsomething else! (Tony, you know I love you!)\n\nNate Ledbetter\n\nI AGREE COMPLETELY: if you read Samurai Warriors,\nSamurai Warlords, Battles of the Samurai, Samurai\nWarfare....they all read essentially the same, even\ndown to the anecdotes! \n--- ggouveia312000 &lt;ggouveia@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have not followed this discussion regarding\n&gt; Turnbull. Why are \n&gt; people flamming Turnbull? I find his work is\n&gt; excellent and quite \n&gt; usefull. My opinion is that his work is the best I\n&gt; have seen, I have \n&gt; work from Bryant, Bottomley, Turnbull and some other\n&gt; author whose \n&gt; name I forget. Turnbull&#39;s work to me out of this\n&gt; groups is the most \n&gt; thorough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why the flaming??????? I don&#39;t want rumour I want\n&gt; facts on Turnbull. \n&gt; If someone is tarnishing a reputation based on rumor\n&gt; I do not want to \n&gt; hear about it. If there is evidence then I will\n&gt; listen.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nHotJobs - Search Thousands of New Jobs\nhttp://www.hotjobs.com\n\n"
