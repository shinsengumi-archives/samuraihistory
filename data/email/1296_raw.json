You can view one at http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1611adams-japan.html although this has been &quot;cleaned&quot; to make it readable. There are many books detailing his life based on the letters as well as Faction Novels (such as Clavell&#39;s Shogun) and more than a few fictional works. Apart from various sources for copies of his letters, I have an early &quot;Romantic Biography&quot; published 1860 - entitled &quot;Will Adams, The First Englishman in Japan&quot; by William Dalton. Dalton &quot;fills-in&quot; between the letters and with some other sources makes quite an entertaining read. Will Adams is also covered in one of the chapters in Herbert H. Gowen&#39;s work &quot;Five Foreigners in Japan&quot; which is quite a factual approach... As an aside, one of the other chapters relates to a native american (although born under the British Flag) visiting Japan in 1848, he was named - Ranald MacDonald. - worth many hours of fun on that name!!\n\nSo back to Clavell.... There was a book published on the making of the film &quot;Shogun&quot;... &quot;The Making of James Clavell&#39;s Shogun&quot; ISBN 0 340 26155 2, which gives a fascinating insight into the novel and the story.\n\nRegarding other foreigners... Papinot lists many &quot;principal foreigners&quot; in his supplement to his &quot;Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan&quot; but none appear to have been accepted into japanese society as samurai. Most appear to have lost their lives in one or other tortuous ways!! \n\nGood luck with the searching,\n\n                                            Rod Johnson\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: gabriel d gabaya \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, December 03, 2002 9:47 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] will adams...\n\n\n  Do you think that Will Adams was the real life model of John Blackthorne in James Clavell&#39;s &#39;Shogun?&#39;  The similarities are striking:  Adams came to Japan aboard a Dutch vessel, his chemistry w/ Ieyasu/Toranaga was very good and eventually both were conferrred samurai rank and were not permitted to leave Japan.\n\n  BTW, did Adams encourage Ieyasu&#39;s anti-Christian paranoia?  In Clavell&#39;s novel, Blackthorne and the Jesuits were at loggerheads.\n\n  Other than Adams, were there foreign-born adventurers who claimed samurai status after serving the shogunate for a considerable abount of time?\n\n  Gabs\n\n  _______________________________________\n  EDSAMAIL.
