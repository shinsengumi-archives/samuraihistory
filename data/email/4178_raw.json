He personally did \n  not lose nor win the long-standing campaign against Nobunaga. But his \n  sons could not match him and the Uesugi family became a non-factor \n  rather quickly.\n\n\n  Our kind host has a very nice summary of this at \n  http://www.samurai-archives.com/kenshin.html\n\n  --\n  Jay Kelly\n  oyakata@...\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
