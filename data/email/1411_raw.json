C. Hurst III \n\nIt goes into the history of the Japanese martial arts, how they \nchanged during the tokugawa period, and were &#39;sportified&#39; (to use an \nnon-scholarly term) by westernization.  and coming from Yale, I have \nto assume it will be a worthy read, and not, as some have termed, a \nbook of &quot;martial-arts mythology&quot;.  If anyone has read it, I&#39;d be \ninterested to hear about it.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Eric &lt;erikb_02809@y...&gt;&quot; \n&lt;erikb_02809@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi everybody. I&#39;m a history & anthroplogy student doing a project \non \n&gt; how the peace of the tokugawa era affected what could be \n&gt; called &quot;samurai culture&quot;. If anyone could provide me with any \n&gt; links , web addressess, info, insights, etc, please email me at \n&gt; erikb_02809@y... I&#39;ve got a martial arts background and am \n&gt; familiar with basic samurai terminolgy, so I don&#39;t need any help \n&gt; explaining to me the difference between a wakizashi and a katana, I \n&gt; need help finding info on advanced stuff like japanese culture \n&gt; during the tokugawa era, etc. thanks _ Eric\n\n\n"
