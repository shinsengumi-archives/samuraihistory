Armor :\n Depending on your status and time period, this changes---as eve=\r\nryone else has said.\n\n2. The sword was not the samurai&#39;s most prized posses=\r\nsion. My family, which is samurai descendants from 2 sides, values the life=\r\ns of the family members, the Buddhist Dharma, and the family knowledge alot=\r\n more than some sharpened piece of metal. \n The &#39;sword is the samurai soul&#39;=\r\n was an attempt to neuter the samurai during the Edo period.  Marx called i=\r\nt &quot;aienation of the species being&quot;... does that make sense? \n The samurai&#39;s=\r\n soul is the Clan... not some over-sized knife. \n\n3.) Why so much care abou=\r\nt swords? You do understand that some samurai used spears right? Some used =\r\nguns ... swords are so over-played these days. In my own experience, the co=\r\nrd of your sword seems to have more uses than the blade itself !\n\n4.) What =\r\nare all swords used for ? \n\n5.) Bushido means, when you get to the heart, g=\r\niving your life for the person whom you&#39;ve sworn your service to. It means =\r\nproving the principle of the warrior beyond your own selfish fears. \n But..=\r\n. in reality--- &quot;bushido&quot; is really a system the Tokugawa Shogunate created=\r\n to keep a country of jittery samurai in check. Let&#39;s be honest.. it was re=\r\nally a system of social control. \n So, you have TWO bushido.. the actual hi=\r\nstorical bushido, which was a social control device... and the &quot;philosophic=\r\nal bushido&quot;... which is an every-changing definition of what it means to be=\r\n a warrior. \n\n 85% of what you hear about samurai is Edo Period castration =\r\ndoctrine OR Post-Meiji bullshito.. either neutering the samurai or whoring =\r\nthe samurai out to the commoners..\n \n     I mean.. how DARE the northern im=\r\nposter dare use Kusunoki Masashige during WW2 ?  Telling all the commoners =\r\nto associate themselves with a Southern Court hero ?   Because the northern=\r\n pretenders lack virtue, the outcome of WW2 was inevitable ..\n ... there is=\r\n some real bushido for you. \n\n Now, because of this pretender.. there are n=\r\no samurai anymore.. the southern court does not sit on the throne..\n\n     .=\r\n. the country is doomed.\n\n                That is bushido.\n\n Does that make=\r\n sense?\n\n\n \n\n \n\n     \n \n\n\n--- On Fri, 4/16/10, BRIAN LAMPE &lt;blampe@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n\n&gt; From: BRIAN LAMPE &lt;blampe@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistor=\r\ny] I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SAMURAI...................\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, April =\r\n16, 2010, 8:01 AM\n&gt; 1.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0CAN YOU DESC=\r\nRIBE ARMOR ?\n&gt; To be honest, the armour varies somewhat by period.=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\nIs there a specific type of armour that you=E2=80=99re looking for\n&gt; a desc=\r\nription of?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0WHY WAS THE SWORD THE SAMURAI&#39;S MOST\n&gt;=\r\n PRIZED MOST POSSESSUIN ?\n&gt; Again this varies by period.
