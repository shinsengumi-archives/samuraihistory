Thanks! :)\n \nPhil\n\n\nCesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\nHi there - I&#39;ve finally seen it. I am not going to discuss the story \nhere yet, because I couldn&#39;t do so without spoilers, but after reading \na few comments I&#39;ve seen on IMDB and other movie website, I&#39;d like to \nsay one thing.\nThat is, do not go to see &#39;Last Samurai&#39; with the expectation to see a \nsuper-realistic, super-historically-accurate movie. I really do not \nthink that was the idea of the producers/director/Tom.\nI would really take it for what it is: historical fiction with \nbeautiful photography and cinematography, some memorable scene, a \nsimple plot, and some mainstream cliche&#39;.\nHowever, I really enjoyed it. For me, it&#39;s a 4,5/5.\ncepo, honolulu\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
