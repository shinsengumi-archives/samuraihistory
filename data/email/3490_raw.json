I wouldn&#39;t call it the &#39;be all, \nend all&#39; of biographies, because there are about 8000 names in there, \nand so it only dedicates from 1 or 2 lines to a paragraph to each one.\nFirst edition 1990 (I have the 12th edition, 2000) by Abe Takeshi.\n\nAs for the Obata Norishige / Obata Nobusada relation, I&#39;m not sure \nhow they are related.  They were both retainers of the Takeda, \nhowever unless I&#39;m missing something, they were not father and son. \nIt looks like Norishige joined the takeda in 1560, and was killed at \nNagashino.\n\nThis is all the relationships I can find in the Obata:\n\nToramori (D.1561)\nSons:\n1.Mitsumori (fled to Echigo after the 1582 fall of the Takeda)\n2.Masamori (1538-1582)\n==Kagenori (1572-1661)\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jeff_l_harris&quot; \n&lt;edenquest@j...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;      An ooki domo arigato gozaimashita to you, &quot;Kitsuno&quot;! Your \n&gt; response went a great distance in clearing up some date and \n&gt; relationship conflicts I had in my notes. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is some of what I have, let me know if you want me to \nclarify \n&gt; &gt; anything, or if you have other questions\n&gt; \n&gt; If I may, just a couple/3:\n&gt; \n&gt; First, what is the &#39;Sengoku Jinmei Jiten&#39;--from the context, it&#39;s a \n&gt; historical record, but to be able note a bit more detail about it \n&gt; would be very helpful (year written, ect.).\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, you noted that Obata Nobusada was the son of O. Shigesada--\n&gt; once source I have listed &quot;O. Norishige&quot; as Nobusada&#39;s father. \n&gt; Are &quot;Shigesada&quot; and &quot;Norishige&quot; the same person? Also, are there \nany \n&gt; dates (b/d) for him? (BTW, I noted I erroneously wrote &quot;Nobushige&quot; \nin \n&gt; my earlier post--sumimasen!). \n&gt; \n&gt; Third, and last, are the Toramori et.al. and Shigesada/Nobusada \nlines \n&gt; related at all? If so, how?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for the past assist, and in advance for any further \n&gt; insights! This is very helpful!\n&gt;    Marlene Harris\n\n\n"
