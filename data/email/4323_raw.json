If it is, I supposed it won&#39;t degrade the\n&gt; grace of Shanao Yoshitsune since what Takki will\n&gt; play is the main character in a manga, not Shanao as\n&gt; a person. Pardon me if I am wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Christin\n\nSince no one else has answered this, I will attempt.\nThe Yoshitsune Taiga drama will be about the life of\nMinamoto Yoshitsune, the younger brother of Minamoto\nYoritomo, the first Minamoto Shogun. Yoshitsune is a\nhistorical figure, though much legend clouds fact. He\nwas a Minamoto general and primary field commander,\nand after subjugating his unruly cousin Yoshinaka, he\nsucceeded in leading the Minamoto to victory against\nthe Taira clan. Once this was done, however, Yoritomo\ntook steps to eliminate all rivals for political\npower, and this included Yoshitsune. Yoshitsune was\nhunted down and killed, his wife, some followers, and\nhis sidekick Benkei at his side. \n\nI don&#39;t know the manga to which you refer, but unless\nit&#39;s about this Yoshitsune, I doubt it&#39;s the basis for\nthe drama. Past Taiga drama have used literary sources\nfor inspiration (recent example being 1996&#39;s\n&quot;Hideyoshi&quot; and 2003&#39;s &quot;Miyamoto Musashi&quot; drawing\nheavily from Yoshikawa Eiji&#39;s work, though I&#39;d\nhesitate to say they were COMPLETELY based on his\nbooks). \n\nThough with recent trends in Taiga drama, maybe Manga\nis a possible source of their inspiration--they&#39;ve\ntried everything else to increase ratings.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
