I was wondering=\r\n if one is able to date the armor just by looking at it and is one able to =\r\nsay who it might have belonged to? It also has a katana with an inscription=\r\n on the hilt, could someone translate it for me, if possible?\n\nThank you ki=\r\nndly\n\nFrank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________=\r\n___________\nMore than messages=96check out the rest of the Windows Live=99.=\r\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowslive/\n\n[Non-text portions of this =\r\nmessage have been removed]\n\n\n"
