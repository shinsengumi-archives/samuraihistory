Few days ago I stated a question and there\nwas now feedback so I&#39;ll try to ask again and in different way. I&#39;m\ndoing some research on Toyotomi Hideyoshi and I&#39;d like to write\nsomething about those men who helped him on his way. Undoubtedly he was\nthe warrior with great talent and he is the one who managed to rule the\nwhole country. But there were also some man who figured as advisors or\nhelped him or just acted in way, which gave Hideyoshi great chance to\naccomplish his mission (for example Sakuma Morimasa). I don&#39;t think that\nwithout those men, Hideyoshi won&#39;t be the ruler of Japan, but I just to\nknow something about them and for my work I&#39;d like to know opinions of\nyou on this subject. So if you could write me some names and the reason\nwhy do you think they helped him, I&#39;ll be grateful to you.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
