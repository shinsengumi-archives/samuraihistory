This mon and it&#39;s variations are\nusually seen as a block of four, or sixteen. My reference gives like 70\nfamilies that used it or a variation.\n    These mon questions come up on the sword forums often; I believe it was\nJohn Yumoto who said that to identify a family from mon you needed three\nmon. The mon of the lord and or the main house of the family, the family mon\nor variation which represented the particular branch and the mon of the\nwifes family. Thus we can see Satsuma Koshirae with the cross in circle mon,\nkiri mon and Aoi mon all in one. As a daughter of the Daimyo was adopted to\na noble family in Kyoto picked up the Kiri and then was wed to the Tokugawa\npicking up the Aoi mon and thus her sons and his cousins back in Satsuma\ncould sport all three.\n    And I would point out once we get into the Meiji period no rules were\nfollowed and any mon might be used by any family. In the end I think it is\nnear impossible to identify a family by mon without some other evidence.\n\n    Tom\n\n\n"
