Usually it\ndepended on the personal loyalties of that particular\nsoldier--if he was a personal retainer of, say,\nIehisa, he could potentially where a device specific\nto Iehisa. But more often than not it&#39;d be a general\ndevice. The Hojo are the best example of this, I\nthink--all the Hojo bigwigs used the same fish-scale\nmon, in different colors to identify their\ncontingents. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; and then there&#39;s this from the Asian War group:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Turnbull, in his Sourcebook (always handy) reports\n&gt; \n&gt; Shimazu: white mon of cross in ring on black\n&gt; \n&gt; Yoshihiro: short red fukinuki (hollow streamer\n&gt; banner) and banner of\n&gt; white &quot;ju&quot; on black\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Retainers&#39; mon vary according to the whim of the\n&gt; lord equipping them.\n&gt; My impression (just that) is that more personal\n&gt; troops (hatamoto, etc)\n&gt; would carry a particular lord&#39;s banner while more\n&gt; routine troops\n&gt; (ashigaru) the clan. But remember, samurai retainers\n&gt; often carried\n&gt; their own insignias!&quot;\n\nThe standard described by Turnbull there for Yoshihiro\nisn&#39;t what his soldiers wore--it was HIS personal\nstandard, or &quot;Uma-jirushi&quot;. An attendant carried it,\nand it marked HIS location on the battlefield, just\nlike Hideyoshi&#39;s Gourd Standard or Ieyasu&#39;s Golden\nFan. His retainers would wear the Shimazu mon on a\nsashimono, in whatever color combination. \n\nTurnbull is usually really good with heraldry--I\nhaven&#39;t checked his book specifically on that yet, but\nthe stuff in the sourcebook and others is solid. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
