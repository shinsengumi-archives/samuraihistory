British.\nAmericans taught agriculture.\n\nThe samurai who fought against the government in the rebellions that \nfollowed the restoration, were not from a single village, never controlled \nterritory or terrorized the Imperial Army as depicted, they fought with \nmodern weapons and they absolutely did not wear armour two hundred years\nout \nof date.\n\nNone of the rebellion leaders I know of spoke English.\n\nWhite men weren&#39;t left alone with Japanese women of the time unless they \nwere &quot;in the trade.&quot; A Japanese woman of the time would gouge your eyes out \nif you killed her husband, not serve you rice in a soup bowl. Japanese \nchildren wouldn&#39;t eat at the same table as &quot;the man of the house&quot; and the \nwoman probably wouldn&#39;t even eat in the house, more likely in the dirt \nfloored kitchen. The actress used would have been a giant in Meiji Japan, \nshe was far too tall and well fed to be a nineteenth century female.\n\nNo man, not even Tom Cruise, would be allowed in the presence of the \nEmperor, unanounced and carrying a sword!\n\nThe true last charge on which the films finale was based amounted to six \nmen, their leaders seppuku was conducted with a sword so dull from use that \nhis neck looked like a stair-step.\n\nWhite Tiger!?!
