The moderators hold ultimate power over this \nlist, but try to be reasonable - anyone who has been on this list \nfor more than a few months should already know this. Sometimes, \nthough, things get out of hand and the moderator(s) are forced to \nstep in and do some housecleaning.  To prevent any \nfurther &quot;misunderstandings&quot;, we again kindly request that everyone \njust takes a look at the rules, and all play nice :)\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3rmr2\n\nThank You,\n\nForum Shogun AKA Yahoo Groups no Kami\n\n\n\n\n\n"
