I operate all my Yahoo groups from two addresses, \nswitching back from one to the other. \n\nFor whatever it&#39;s worth, my own interests in both fiction and history, tend \ntoward individuals. I see history as made up of individuals facing certain \nconditions and making individual choices. I tend to shy away from broad \ngeneralizations based on sweeping tendencies based on large groups of people. \n\nWhen I wrote &quot;Stray Dogs,&quot; it was about a single individual, Fuwa Kazuemon, \nwho happened to be a real person from history. I was not interested in broad, \nsweeping sociological or political statements or conclusions about 18th century \nJapanese society or politics. I didn&#39;t intend even to discuss whether or not \nLord Asano was &quot;correct&quot; or not in drawing his sword against Kira or in any \ndiscussions as to whether the former Ako retainers should have waited to strike \n(as they did) or if they should have all commited seppuku on the spot (as \nsome, including Yamamoto -- author of &quot;Hagakure&quot; -- had said). \n\nAccording to Fuwa Kazuemon, a man loyal to his former lord, Lord Asano can do \nno wrong, so to HIM, it was obvious that Kira was the &quot;bad guy&quot; in all of \nthis. My story was clearly using Fuwa Kazuemon&#39;s own views of the world at the \ntime. \n\nAnd why choose Fuwa Kazuemon? Because I find that he had a remarkable \nhistory. He was thrown out of the Ako clan by Lord Asano 5-6 years before the events \nthat led to Lord Asano&#39;s own death. According to the sources I read, he was \nthus consigned to the life of a masterless ronin for these years, with the extra \nstigma of having offended his former lord. So it was not likely that a \ndifferent lord would take him into a clan. So he faced the hardships that most ronin \nfaced, povery and living on the edge in marginal occupations to sustain \nhimself. \n\nBut this was the life of quite a few people during that time. What made Fuwa \nKazuemon&#39;s life unique and worthy of note? It&#39;s because despite all of this, \nhe maintained his loyalty to the daimyo who had cast him out and consigned him \nto exile and poverty. This is loyalty beyond what could be expected of a man \nwho had been banished from his clan. \n\nEven during the time right after Lord Asano&#39;s death and the iminent seizure \nof the Ako castle, Kazuemon came to the castle to offer his support -- and was \nrepeatedly rebuffed by Oishi Kuranosuke (chief retainer of the Ako retainers, \nwho had taken on the duty of leadership of the Ako ex-retainers at the time). \nEven then, he remained loyal. This is true and remarkable loyalty in the face \nof such rejection. \n\nFuwa Kazuemon persisted in spite of all and finally was re-admitted among the \nAko ex-retainers and was one of the 47 (some say it was 46) who took part in \nthe final attack against Kira, to avenge his lord&#39;s death. My sources indicate \nthat he killed more of Kira&#39;s retainers during the attack than any other of \nthe Ako men.  With the other Ako ronin, he committed seppuku in February after \nthe attack. \n\nThen the question can arise. Why write historical fiction? Why not just write \na non-fictional biography? Partly because I am a fiction writer; it suits my \nstyle of wishing to concentrate on individual humans and get more &quot;into their \nminds.&quot;  There are too many gaps where available historical sources have \nfailed to record details of this man&#39;s life. So as a historical fiction writer, I \ndo research and come up with speculations that seem logical and appear &quot;right&quot; \nto fill in these important details. \n\nFuwa Kazuemon&#39;s life boggles my mind with his extraordinary loyalty. And thus \nI am drawn to him as an individual and I wanted to study him. The actions of \nindividuals do impact other individuals and the ripple can go forth to affect \nhistory in general. \n\nBy the way, for those who might be interested. It appears that my 2006 entry \nto the Samurai Archives Fiction Contest will be a further tale in the life of \nFuwa Kazuemon. \n\nNina\n\n"
