Next question: Mito Komon \nmeans the &quot;Yellow Gate of Mito&quot; is that why the character is always \ndressed in yellow?\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Brandon-\n&gt; Mito Komon Mitsukuni or Tokugawa Mitsukuni (1628-1700) was Lord of \nMito \n&gt; and a son of one of the ancillary houses of the the Tokugawa \nShogun. A \n&gt; devoted scholar he dedicated himself to the study of Japanese \nhistory, \n&gt; sponsored the writing of the Dai Nihon Shi, and &quot;discovered&quot; \nKusunoki \n&gt; Masashige making him a national hero. His Mito school of history \n&gt; favored things Japanese over Chinese, Shinto over Buddhism and the \n&gt; Emperor over the Shogun. The spread of this school of thought laid \nthe \n&gt; foundations for the national debate that arose when the Americans \ncame \n&gt; and showed the Bakufu to be lacking in leadership, and thus the \nMeiji \n&gt; Restoration.\n&gt; \tHe may have travelled in cognito ,&quot;as a commoner&quot;, once or twice \nand \n&gt; that fact has given rise to a series of books which then became a \nTV \n&gt; show and there has been a movie as well I believe. The gimmick is \nthat \n&gt; no commoner could wear or carry the Tokugawa mon, so in the \nclimactic \n&gt; scenes he whips out his inro to the shock of all, who now see that \nhe \n&gt; is a Lord and not just some meddling old man...\n&gt; -t\n\n\n\n"
