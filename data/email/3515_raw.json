I am\nrather intrigued by them, in their day. Follow me on this for a moment\nif you will...\n\nWhen Slavery was abolished in the United States, there were people who\nstill thought slavery was a good idea, and people who didn&#39;t. After\nthe abolishment of slavery, for the most part, former slave owners\nrarely went about saying they were members of a class that proudly\nowned other human beings and had the right to life or death over them.\nThe law didn&#39;t allow that any more, and for the most part, and the\ngeneral populace would not stand for that. The abolishment was drilled\ninto the public psyche, as was the concept that slave owners were not\nneeded in a changed society, and that all races and classes should be\nfree and theoretically equal. Owning slaves was made not-noble.\n\nSamurai had an equal right of life or death over those of lesser\nclass, held all of the benefits of the current society, and when\nSamurai were abolished, the general psyche of the public thought they\nwere as un-needed as slave owners were in the U.S.\n\nSo I suppose one could say they were still slave owners if they were\nthe descendants of slave owners...but the public would not look kindly\non that, nor would I suspect the public would look kindly on Samurai.\n\nThere were good samurai, and the parts of samurai life that were noble\nshould be celebrated but lets not forget it was a package deal. - just\nlike there were, I suppose, some good slave owners, but the society\nevolved around them.\n\n\nJust other thoughts...\nChristopher \n(who celebrates the good parts of samurai life, but is aware there are\nbad ones...)\n\n&gt; So theoretically the descendants of the samurai class could\ntherefore still consider themselves to be samurai, although not with a\nlegal foundation, with the laws enacted during the Meiji Restoration\nbeing formulated by the winners, if not nessarily/hypothetically those\nin the &#39;right&#39; ??\n&gt; Just a thought\n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; \n\n\n"
