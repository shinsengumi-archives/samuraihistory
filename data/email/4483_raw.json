Quite the=\r\n opposite, I&#39;d argue. He is the &quot;cool bad \nguy,&quot; eventually, somebody like =\r\nDarth Vader... and to some, a hero, \nembodying some of the highest values o=\r\nf the Japanese tradition.\n\nI would say there are few reasons for that:\n\n1 -=\r\n He was a &quot;strong man,&quot; and the Japanese revere people with strong \nwill.\n\n=\r\n2 - Asia has a tradition of men who cared about &quot;duty,&quot; rather than \nabout =\r\nindividuals. Just think of the indian Prince Krishna in the \nBhagavad-Gita,=\r\n of the Chinese first Emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di (who&#39;s \ncelebrated even in =\r\nrecent times, by Mao Tze Tung, rather than in Jet \nLi&#39;s &quot;Hero&quot;), and of cou=\r\nrse of Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Nobunaga had a \ngoal: to unify Japan. He ded=\r\nicated his life to that, and he wouldn&#39;t \nstop at nothing. Some people like=\r\n such attitude.\nAgain, careful with comparisons with people such as Hitler.=\r\n Hitler \ninvaded foreign countries, and he created a bureaucratic apparatus=\r\n to \nkill civilians (=3Dconcentration camps). Nobunaga played in his own \nc=\r\nountry and he killed simply what was on his way.\n\n3 - Finally, it can be ar=\r\ngued that Nobunaga, just as many other \nunifiers, worked for a &#39;greater goo=\r\nd.&#39; The unification was necessarily \na bloodshed, but what emerged at its e=\r\nnd (the Tokugawa Shogunate) \nformed the basis for modern Japan and guarante=\r\ned 250+ years of relative \npeace. Ultimately, if Japan would have go on &quot;se=\r\nngokuing&quot; another \n100-200 years, it would have been routed easily by the f=\r\nirst Western \nfleet arriving. So, the unification was a good thing for Japa=\r\nn, I would \nsay.\n\nIn general, our approach as historians (??) should be les=\r\ns judgmental. \nWe are here to observe, perhaps comment, but we are in no po=\r\nsition to \njudge the &quot;morality&quot; or the &quot;sense of justice&quot; of a man who live=\r\nd some \n500 years ago in a far away country, engulfed in a civil war.\n\nSure=\r\n, by our modern Enlightenment-Christian influenced standard, he was \na vill=\r\nain. But this is a biased point of view. I think.\n\ncepo\n\nPS =3D I believe N=\r\nobunaga was not killed by ninja, but by Akechi \nMitsuhide&#39;s men. Apparently=\r\n, Nobunaga was on his way to Kyoto to do \nsome tea ceremony. He stayed over=\r\n at a temple, and there he&#39;s got it. \nThere is no historical evidence of hi=\r\ns death, however. The temple \n(Honnouji) burnt down, and he probably perish=\r\ned in the fire, perhaps \nafter committing seppuku. It was 1582. Hideyoshi, =\r\nwas campaigning in \nthe West, and once he heard the news he returned to Kyo=\r\nto, and he \ndestroyed Akechi Mitsuhide, to become the new leader of Japan.\n=\r\n\n"
