I believe Donald Richie has been recently honored in just such \n    a way. However, these awards are not to be construed with knighthood or \n    samurai status.\n          The samurai (with all due respect can we use bushi or buke?) were \n    abolished as a class in the 1870&#39;s by the Emperor&#39;s own government and \n    with the stroke of the Emperor&#39;s own pen(seal). No one can convince me \n    that 8 foreigners have been given the privileges of the class while \n    legitimate descendants of buke families are denied same!\n\n\n    -t\n\n\n    Surely if the Emperor needed the help of the World Full Contact Karate \n    champion so much so that he knighted him, wouldn&#39;t he keep him close at \n    hand? If anything did happen he would be too late to help if travelling \n    from Manchester!?!\n\n\n\n    ---\n    Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n    Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n    --- \n\n\n\n\n    Yahoo!
