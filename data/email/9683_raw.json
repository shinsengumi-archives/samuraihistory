Anyways the reason why I&#39;m asking these new question=\r\ns is\n&gt; because, I need a  primary source for my essay.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. If a samurai=\r\n was to lose a battle, and  return alive, would he\n&gt; commit suicide?\n&gt; Not =\r\nnecessarily. It would depend on several circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  Were the=\r\nre any female samurai? \n&gt; Yes, though usually they were referred to as Onna=\r\n Musha. Most women\nof the  \n&gt; samurai class stayed on the homefront and use=\r\nd their naginata to\ndefend the  \n&gt; home. There were a few who went on the b=\r\nattlefield. You can do some\nwork on  \n&gt; Google to find out more details.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; 3.  What would happen if a samurai&#39;s katana was stolen?\n&gt; Well, he&#39;d eit=\r\nher find another katana or use his wakizashi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; 4. If  a samurai use=\r\nd seppuku to regain his honor, what would happen to\n&gt; his  family?\n&gt; That d=\r\nepends upon the situation. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I think that you need to visit some sites=\r\n dedicated to Japanese\nhistory to  \n&gt; answer your questions. Try Samurai Ar=\r\nchives Wiki. Also check out &quot;Ten  \n&gt; Misconceptions About Samurai&quot; (search =\r\non Google to find the exact site).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hope this helps.
