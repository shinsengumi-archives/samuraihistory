Or at least, be ready to die if\nneeded be, when the time comes, in the defense of the Honour that also,\nincludes the Lord who pay the expenses of the samurai in question.\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\n\nMessage: 3\n   Date: Tue, 05 Aug 2003 18:52:31 -0700\n   From: Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: What makes a samurai a samurai?\n\nOne was able to enlist as a foot soldier or as a page and &quot;move up through\nthe ranks&quot;,\nHidiyoshi is a good example of this. Later on though their were laws in\nplace to prevent\nthis from happening and the only way to be a samurai was through birth. One\ninteresting\nexeption to this in the late edo period, a time when many samurai were\nimpoverished\nronin, wealthy merchants would pay to have their sons adopted into a samurai\nfamily.\n\nregards\nDave Jackson\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: gokujr1\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Sunday, August 03, 2003 10:58 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] What makes a samurai a samurai?\n\n\n  Can anyone tell me a detailed list of all the specifications to being\n  a samurai?\n\n\n\n"
