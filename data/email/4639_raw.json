In particular the Sengoku daimyos. \n\n  Individual biographies are good but what I&#39;m after is a book that \n  details the history of the major Sengoku clans (ie 10-15 pages on \n  each house):\n\n  Tokugawa\n  Oda\n  Hojo\n  Shimazu\n  Otomo\n  Mori\n  Takeda\n  Uesugi\n\n  Also, if anyone knows of a biography of Mori Motonari (my favourite \n  Sengoku warlord) then could you please let me know. It&#39;d have to be \n  an English version of course as I don&#39;t read Japanese. \n\n  I&#39;ve looked on Amazon but they only seem to have biographies on \n  Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi and I&#39;ve read books on both of \n  them!\n\n  Thanks\n\n  Neil \n\n\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
