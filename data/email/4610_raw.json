In particular the Sengoku daimyos. \n\nIndividual biographies are good but what I&#39;m after is a book that \ndetails the history of the major Sengoku clans (ie 10-15 pages on \neach house):\n\nTokugawa\nOda\nHojo\nShimazu\nOtomo\nMori\nTakeda\nUesugi\n\nAlso, if anyone knows of a biography of Mori Motonari (my favourite \nSengoku warlord) then could you please let me know. It&#39;d have to be \nan English version of course as I don&#39;t read Japanese. \n\nI&#39;ve looked on Amazon but they only seem to have biographies on \nTokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi and I&#39;ve read books on both of \nthem!\n\nThanks\n\nNeil \n\n\n\n\n"
