Those who suppresed brutally other\nrebelling samurais were also samurais.\n\nA real social change did not mature to exist until\nGeneral MacArthur passed the land reform bill after\nWorld War Two...\n\n\n&gt; One more cent... :o)\n&gt; The majority of the samurai were broke. In fact, the\n&gt; salary of the \n&gt; low-ranks samurai barely sufficed to survive--that&#39;s\n&gt; wahy so many of \n&gt; them had to sell their beloved swords (sigh). How\n&gt; ironic: they were \n&gt; supposedly on top of the Tokugawa hierarchy, and by\n&gt; the 19th c. they \n&gt; were the poorest of the four medieval classes,\n&gt; making much less than \n&gt; artisans, merchants, and often even less than\n&gt; farmers.\n&gt; No surprise they were pissed off.\n&gt; Of course the samurai ideology played its role, but\n&gt; I believe economic \n&gt; reasons were important as well. They were angry, and\n&gt; hungry too.\n&gt; cepo, honolulu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
