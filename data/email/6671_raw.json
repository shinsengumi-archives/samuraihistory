Until then we see a constant striving towards \nthat &#39;ideal&#39; interruptd by the incursions of one&#39;s neighbours, but it \nwas there.\n\nTokugawa feudalism was not a product of Ieyasu, it was an \nincipient feudalism instituted on a national scale; both Hideyoshi \nand Nobunaga were working towards that end with themselves \nat the top of the tree - and every daimyo instituted and \nmaintained a feudal regime as much as he was able.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n"
