I was merely thinking of what I commonly do w=\r\nith kitchen knives, and one of them is chopping garlic for a good soffrito,=\r\n after you&#39;ve cooked the onions in oil to a nice pale transparency (because=\r\n the onions need to cook longer than the garlic).  No cross necessary for t=\r\nhat.  The whole vampire myth- vampires wouldn&#39;t last a week in Italy, would=\r\n they?\n \nNow, why would sword makers be limited in their production of fine=\r\n blades each year?  Is it a law?  And what would be the purpose of that law=\r\n, beyond artificially driving the price of each sword up?  It sounds like a=\r\n protectionist Japanese law, sort of like how DeBeers limits the sales of d=\r\niamonds to artifically drive up the price.\n \nMatt \n \n \n\nDodu Gabriel &lt;dodu_=\r\ngabriel@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nHello Matt!\n\nFunny garlic thingy there...:)) I =\r\nthink there should have been a \ncross also. But leaving this aside (I hope =\r\nthis type of utterance is \npermitted in english), the katana stuff was only=\r\n inteded as a joke, \nas I was reading a lot of &quot;bollocks&quot; (as Mr. Bryant sa=\r\nid once) on \nother forums regarding the Samurai matter.\n\nBy the way, are yo=\r\nu familiar with the Toledo Swordmasters (the \nspanish Toledo, because there=\r\n are others)? They have some very nice \nreplicas (is that the word?) of his=\r\ntorical swords.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGabriel\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Matt Bowes &lt;yeomanforbes@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Gabriel:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Impres=\r\nsive.  Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you&#39;re not \na &quot;ringer&quot; post=\r\ning from middle Ohio?  You made me look \nup &quot;concatenates.&quot;  I think I hear=\r\nd the word used ONCE back in 1992.  \n&gt; \n&gt; To the crowd at large, not just o=\r\nur erudite Romanian, I could be \nwrong, but my ex-wife&#39;s aiee (sword) teach=\r\ner (no, dear reader, I have \nno idea how it is spelled, since I have never =\r\never seen it in print) \ntold me that the great sword makers had stopped mak=\r\ning katanas and \nmoved into making kitchen knives, since that&#39;s where the m=\r\noney is.  \nNow, I can see perhaps where it would be extra handy to have a g=\r\ninsu \nknife for chopping garlic instead of your trusty katana, but maybe \nt=\r\nhat&#39;s just me.  Some of you might enjoy the garlic chopping with a \nlarger =\r\nblade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged if you do, \nsince that strik=\r\nes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there any \ntruth to this rumor th=\r\nat the great swordmakers are still out there, \njust making steak knives for=\r\n Williams Sonoma?  (Incidentally, the ex \nand myself are on excellent terms=\r\n, so no need to fear for my safety.  \nThank you for your concern.)\n&gt; \n&gt; You=\r\nr most obedient,\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; Dodu Gabriel &lt;dodu_gabriel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; -=\r\n-- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Newbies are welcome unless they make themselves\n&gt; &gt; unwelcome=\r\n.

I am from Romania, and please don&#39;t =\r\n\n&gt; start with the Dracula stuff, because I hate Bram Stoker. It did \n&gt; wond=\r\ners for our Travelling Industry, but it crippled our history...:\n(\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/kanji/nengo.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That only begins=\r\n in year 1201, but does give the kanji\n&gt; &gt; for each period, and the alterna=\r\nte periods. I&#39;ll see\n&gt; &gt; if I can dig up anything prior to that. As for\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n changing the period name, it was the Emperor who did\n&gt; &gt; that--not the dai=\r\nmyo, Shogun, or any military person.\n&gt; &gt; Someone else may have &quot;suggested&quot; =\r\nto the Emperor that\n&gt; &gt; it would be a good time for a name change, but it w=\r\nas\n&gt; &gt; the Emperor who actually did it. Reasons for changing\n&gt; &gt; included a=\r\n portentous sign, a natural disaster, a\n&gt; &gt; particularly good event, or jus=\r\nt because they&#39;d gone\n&gt; &gt; long enough. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for the information,=\r\n it&#39;s good to know things as they \n&gt; were.

I =\r\nlike the site, \n&gt; though...\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, if you get to check out EDICT,=\r\n maybe you can find out \n&gt; how to search for expressions, because I couldn&#39;=\r\nt.
