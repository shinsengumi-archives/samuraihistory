I think Hideyori was snuck out of Osaka castle\n&gt; via the elevator \n&gt; in the center before being whisked off to Kyushu to\n&gt; live out his \n&gt; remaining years in seclusion.  Bet that was the last\n&gt; place the \n&gt; attacking Samurai would have thought to look, &quot;Tono,\n&gt; Hideyori \n&gt; couldn&#39;t be in the elevator, it says &#39;in case of\n&gt; fire, use stairs&#39;!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; and besides it&#39;s better\n&gt; &gt; than Nagoya-jo (How many Daimyo had ELEVATORS\n&gt; &gt; installed????)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
