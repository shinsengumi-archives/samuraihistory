Welcome to the group. I hope you enjoy your time here. \n\n&gt;Few years ago I started a hobby by collecting swords,I haven&#39;t got \n&gt;many swords mostly Chinese and Japanese swords.My most favorite was \n&gt;the japanese katana and ever since I&#39;m interested in Japanese \n&gt;Samuar\u001b$B}\u0001\u001b(Bhistory,so here I am,this is all very new to me,but I want \n&gt;to learn everything there is to know.\n\nLeaning it all is a big task. :) I suggest starting slow. Ask a few \nspecific questions about whatever it is you&#39;re most interested in. I&#39;m \nsure you&#39;ll get a lot of information from the good folks here.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
