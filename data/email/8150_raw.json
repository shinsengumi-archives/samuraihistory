When his son passes. He goes outside to his dayimos and \nc=\r\nuts off his ponytail and all the dayimos cut off theirs. They say \nit is fo=\r\nr Hideyoshi son&#39;s soul. Is this an accurate portrayal of \nwhat might have h=\r\nappened? It was a very dramatic scene....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Moosho-\n&gt; \tA number of =\r\nthings are going on when a samurai cuts off his \ntopknot;\n&gt; \n&gt; First off it=\r\n is symbolic of a renunciation of secular life, of \nself.  \n&gt; Thus a buddhi=\r\nst shaves his or her head when entering the monastic  \n&gt; life. Conversely w=\r\ne see Sumo wrestlers cut off their topknots \nwhen  \n&gt; ending their (monk-li=\r\nke?) life in the sport and re-entering  \n&gt; pedestrian life.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the com=\r\ning of age ceremony a young samurai boy has his head \nshaved  \n&gt; and dresse=\r\nd for the first time in the style of an adult. As an \nadult  \n&gt; he accepts =\r\nall the responsibilities of his house, his life, his \nbody,  \n&gt; serve his l=\r\nord and by extension belong to him. He is expected to  \n&gt; avoid any action =\r\nwhich would bring disgrace on his lord, so he \nmust  \n&gt; always dress and ac=\r\nt properly. To fail to answer a challenge, to \ndie  \n&gt; in a fight with your=\r\n sword undrawn, to allow the name or the \nfamily- \n&gt; crest of ones lord to =\r\nbe besmirched among other crimes, would all  \n&gt; bring great shame on your h=\r\nouse and your lord.Hairstyle was a \nclear,  \n&gt; visible representation of ra=\r\nnk and position.(keep in mind these  \n&gt; customs may have had their origins =\r\nin the age of war, but found \ntheir  \n&gt; extremes in the Edo period)\n&gt; \n&gt; \tS=\r\no we can imagine the shock of the villagers in the Seven \nSamurai  \n&gt; when =\r\nthey see a seemingly sane member of the bushi class shaving \nhis  \n&gt; head a=\r\nnd removing his swords, to aid a little peasant boy. No \nwonder  \n&gt; a crowd=\r\n gathers! And Japanese filmgoers all recognize that with \nhis  \n&gt; shaved he=\r\nad and the simple sash he is given he has assumed the \nguise  \n&gt; of a pries=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIn the film Seppuku, the hero chooses to cut off the \ntopknots of =\r\nhis  \n&gt; enemies rather than their heads, knowing that if they were true  \n&gt;=\r\n samurai they would have no choice but to kill themselves rather \nthan  \n&gt; =\r\nreveal their shame to their lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \n&gt; -t\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
