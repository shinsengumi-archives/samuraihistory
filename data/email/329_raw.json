What follows is the full text of his \n&gt;trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record: \n&gt;&quot;This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the \n&gt;Americans as the most generous and possibly the least \n&gt;appreciated people on all the earth. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and \n&gt;Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the \n&gt;Americans who poured in billions of dollars and \n&gt;forgave other billions in debts. None of these \n&gt;countries is today paying even the interest on its \n&gt;remaining debts to the United States. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, \n&gt;it was the Americans who propped it up, and their \n&gt;reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets \n&gt;of Paris. I was there. I saw it. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the \n&gt;United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 \n&gt;American communities were flattened by tornadoes. \n&gt;Nobody helped. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped \n&gt;billions of dollars! into discouraged countries. Now \n&gt;newspapers in those countries are writing about the \n&gt;decadent, warmongering Americans. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;I&#39;d like to see just one of those countries that \n&gt;is gloating over the erosion of the United States \n&gt;dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country \n&gt;in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo \n&gt;Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? \n&gt;If so, why don&#39;t they fly them? Why do all the \n&gt;International lines except Russia fly American Planes? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;Why does no other land on earth even consider putting \n&gt;a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese \n&gt;technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German \n&gt;technocracy, and you get automobiles. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;You talk about American technocracy, and you find \n&gt;men on the moon -! not once, but several times - \n&gt;and safely home again. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs \n&gt;right in the store window for everybody to look at. \n&gt;Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. \n&gt;They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless \n&gt;they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American \n&gt;dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;When the railways of France, Germany and India \n&gt;were breaking down through age, it was the Americans \n&gt;who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and \n&gt;the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an \n&gt;old caboose. Both are still broke. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced \n&gt;to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name \n&gt;me even one time when someone else raced to the \n&gt;Americans in trouble? I don&#39;t think there was outside \n&gt;help even during the San Francisco earthquake. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I&#39;m one \n&gt;Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get \n&gt;kicked around. They will come out of this thing with \n&gt;their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled \n&gt;to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating \n&gt;over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of \n&gt;those.&quot; \n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; As a member of the U.S. Military, but most importantly\n&gt; as an American, Thank you.
