Omura castle in Omura, Nagasaki is amazing - all that is \nleft is the foundation and some walls, but one side of the wall is \nabout 50 feet strait up.  I didnt have my camera with me at that \npoint, but I was able to climb up the side of the wall.  The castle \nitself wasnt really on a hill, but the foundation was build up so \nhigh, it appeared that it could have been well fortified.  Castles \nlike momoyama and osaka are interesting, but something about those \nconcrete monsters just don&#39;t fly with me...  or maybe the kids \nthemepark within spitting distance of Momoyama castle turned me off.  \nOther notables such as the iceskating rink on the top of mt. hiezan \nat the enryakuji come to mind here...\n\nCEWest\n\n\n"
