One is of the blade tip and the first several \ninches. (Tom, see I am learning. I did not know what a kissaki or a \nmonouchi is, but I looked them up in a glossary.) Even though it was \ntaken outside, without flash, there is some glare in this pic. If you \ncan not see what you are looking for, tell me and I will see if I can \nget a clearer photo.\n\nThe second pic is of the inside of a flap on the leather scabbard. I \ndo not know what the characters say. I assume they identify the sword \nowner. This photo was taken inside with a flash using a friend&#39;s \ncamera that does a better job on real close shots.\n\nScott\n\n\n\n"
