This means that although the King is the \nchief of state and there are noble titles there is no social class \nsystem and the country is ruled by a government (much like in many other \nConstitutional Monarchies throughout Europe).\n\nAnd although there are noble titles that doesn&#39;t also mean that there is \na Noble class. For example, here in Portugal we have a Republic and \nobviously there is no noble class or anything like that. However, there \nare still people that use their noble titles. So, as in th Indian cast \nexample, the fact that there is no social class doesn&#39;t prevent people \nfrom acting as if there was one.\n\n\n"
