The Samurai either exacted his revenge or kept his mouth shut.\n&gt; I doubt there are many such stories recorded anywhere though...\n&gt; -t\n&gt;\n&gt; PS Nate yours is a rare talent, I laughed so hard I feel &quot;beated up&quot;\n&gt; myself.\n\nI find his pompous elitism offending, personally.\n\nI admit that the &quot;story&quot; was funny, and I would have laughed heartily under\ndifferent circumstances. Unfortunately, the whole &quot;trying to make fun of the\nignorant without them realizing they&#39;re being fooled&quot; bent really gets me in\na bad mood. It&#39;s tasteless. Sorry, but it is. I know that pop culture brings\na LOT of irritating questions to this particular list (hey, they even annoy\nme at times), but it&#39;s more productive to either answer the question as best\nyou can, or just ignore it altogether.\n\nIf I had the knowledge, I&#39;d be spending more time trying to educate those\nwho seem willing and capable of understanding what really happened in\nhistory (as far as we know, anyway). Anyone who isn&#39;t willing or able, I&#39;d\nsimply tune out.\n\nSally\n\n\n\n\n"
