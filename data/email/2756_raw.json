Omura&quot; &lt;rso@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; It seems blade up or down depends on how you wear the sword. The \npictures of tachi that I&#39;ve seen have a cord or string that makes \nthe sword dangle from the waist. That makes it lower and more \nnatural to draw with edge down. The katana is usually worn stuck \ninto a sash with the handle pointing up at a slight angle. This \nwould make it easier to be drawn with the edge up. All the samurai \nmovies as well as the old engravings and artwork I&#39;ve seen have the \nedge up on katanas, edge down with tachis.\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: samurai-listowner@s... \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, December 08, 2003 11:44 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: TACHI\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;ve drawn a katana less than 100 times in my life and that was \nyears ago, so I&#39;m \n&gt;   lost on the &#39;blade up / blade down&#39; conversation -- I am \npicturing a katana or \n&gt;   whichever type of sword you choose on your left side, basically \nparallel to the \n&gt;   ground, with the handle protruding out in front of you (the way \nI was taught to \n&gt;   wear it).  I take &#39;blade down&#39; to mean that the cutting edge is \nfacing the ground, \n&gt;   and is basically parallel to the ground.  if you draw with your \nright hand, it \n&gt;   results in a fairly natural grip. If on the other hand, the \nsword is &#39;blade up&#39;, \n&gt;   that would mean to me that the cutting edge is &#39;up&#39; and \ntherefore facing the sky.  \n&gt;   if that was the case, drawing with your right hand would force \nyou to turn your \n&gt;   wrist up so that your fist is perpendicular to the ground, and \nyour knuckles \n&gt;   are &#39;up&#39; facing the sky.  I think that would be very hard to \ndraw that way, and to \n&gt;   do a cut off the draw like that would mean that you are slashing \nout in a circular \n&gt;   motion up-out-down, which would seem to me difficult to control \ndue to the \n&gt;   position your wrist is in and the fact that the sword would be \nalmost slingshotted \n&gt;   out of the sheath, whereas drawing the sword blade down (as I&#39;ve \ndescribed an \n&gt;   pictured it) results is an easily controlled and aimable \nstrike.  Would someone \n&gt;   like to describe the mechanics of katana-drawing for me?  The \nway I was taught was \n&gt;   purely blade down.\n&gt; \n&gt;   -----Original Message-----\n&gt;   From: Anthony J.

Try it.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Blade UP makes for a more immediate draw & slice. \n&gt; \n&gt;   The tachi is worn edge down because that&#39;s the way they *always* \nhave\n&gt;   been worn, since the fifth century, before cavalry was an issue.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
