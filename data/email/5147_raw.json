My point was that it was/is a \nlong held teaching of the Eishin Ryu and not something thought up in \nthe West. This is one more item, of many, I should like to research \nfurther but it is my belief, as I stated earlier, that kaishaku were a \nlater add-on. To have a full blown Seppuku ceremony prior to the \nTokugawa period, was a rare thing, for persons of very high rank I am \nthinking (The son of Ieyasu comes to mind). Most times I imagine \nseppuku was a personal thing which took place in the heat of battle, \nwith no one around to assist...\n-t\n\n\n"
