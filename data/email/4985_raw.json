He \n&gt;says, &quot;Hara-Kiri is what you do to a fish, seppuku is what a man does \n&gt;to himself.&quot; While poetic, I thought perhaps he was joking, but he \n&gt;insists calling ritual suicide &#39;hara-kiri&#39; is a Western \n&gt;misunderstanding. According to him, the proper term is seppuku.\n\nLilith,\nUnfortunately (or fortunately) being a native speaker doesn&#39;t mean \nthat you automatically know everything about your language. I know \nthat is certainly the case for me and English.\n\nHarakiri is a perfectly legitimate (and old) word referring to ritual \nsuicide. Of course it is a bit crude, which may be where your husband \nis coming from in saying that it&#39;s better to use the word to refer to \nanimals. But it can&#39;t be denied that hara-kiri is perfectly natural \nand not a Western misunderstanding. For instance there is the \n&quot;Nagamachi Onna Harakiri&quot; \u001b$BD9D.=wJ&quot;@Z\u001b(B from 1712, but I&#39;m sure that \nothers can give you even earlier references (I can&#39;t think of a \nspecific earlier title right now, unfortunately).\n\n&gt;Can anyone tell me whether the practice of cutting the neck so as to \n&gt;leave a thin string of tissue between the body and the head (to \n&gt;differentiate the body of a man who committed seppuku from a fallen \n&gt;enemy whose head was taken) was ever extant? I&#39;ve read of it in a few \n&gt;books, but have not seen any scholarly verification.\n\nI personally have never heard of this. From a practical point of view \nit seems like it would be next to impossible to carry off. Plus it \nseems like it&#39;s confusing things a bit. If this is the seppuku done \non the battlefield, it&#39;s not always clear that there would be a \nkaishaku-nin there to cut off the head. If it is the more formal \nseppuku ceremony, then of course there would be no need to make such \na distinction -- and in fact the head viewing ceremony took place \nat a relatively far distance from the body.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
