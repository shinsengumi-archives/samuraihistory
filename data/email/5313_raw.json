They would have needed to transport  supplies by sea, no\nmean feat in those days with storms etc. Although Nate made the valid point\nthat the sailors would have been Chinese and Koreans, who were excellent\nseafarers. I still think it would have been a mammoth task. They would have\nbeen dependent on good weather and as the &quot;Divine wind&quot; proved, you cant\nrely on that.

The whole thing about the Mongols was that\n&gt; they took their infrastructure with them, no?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also: forgive my ignorance, but where was Japanese horse-archery at\n&gt; the time we&#39;re talking about? Didn&#39;t samurai start out as mounted\n&gt; archers? This sounds like an interesting discussion to have...\n&gt;\n&gt; Lili, Back from San Francisco\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
