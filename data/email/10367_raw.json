I probably should not have quoted this thread as I was=\r\nn&#39;t\r\n&gt; asking about guns per se, but specifically gunpowder and the printing pr=\r\ness\r\n&gt; and generally about the development of technology in Asia.  By the time\r\n&gt; Japan adopted the use of flintlocks, the Chinese already had cannons,\r\n&gt; grenades, and significant development in the use of gunpowder. I do not =\r\nsee\r\n&gt; where any development of uses for gunpowder occurred until after the arr=\r\nival\r\n&gt; of the Portuguese.  More importantly, the arrival of the printing press\r\n&gt; appears to be equally disdained..  While the Chinese were printing books=\r\n,\r\n&gt; Japan still preferred writing?  I believe there are examples in textile\r\n&gt; production and architecture as well, where significant advances were not\r\n&gt; readily adopted.  Just curious if there might be an explanation or just =\r\nan\r\n&gt; oddity of history.  I can&#39;t find similar examples in Western history. In=\r\n the\r\n&gt; West, technology moves from country to country like wildfire, with every=\r\none\r\n&gt; claiming they invented it..\r\n&gt;=20\r\n&gt; -d\r\n&gt;=20\r\n&gt; Ride wanted, off planet.

But in a nutshell, yes, guns did arrive in Japan before t=\r\nhe\r\n&gt; &gt; 16th century from China/Korea - just not in sufficient numbers to buil=\r\nd an\r\n&gt; &gt; arsenal, or they were thought of as &quot;curiosities&quot; and not produced in =\r\nJapan.\r\n&gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dennis Sheridan &lt;ldsheridan@&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Chinese discovered gunpowder in the 9th century. Do I understand\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correctly that the Japanese did not acquire this technology until th=\r\ne mid\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 16th century with Portuguese guns? (The route would be from China to\r\n&gt; &gt; Arabia\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Europe and from there all the way back to Japan.. This is not at =\r\nall\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intuitive.) Similarly, the Chinese had movable type and a crude prin=\r\nting\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; press (via India) by the mid 11th c., the Koreans the same 3 centuri=\r\nes\r\n&gt; &gt; later\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and apparently the Japanese even later than that. Given the geograph=\r\nical\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; juxtaposition, the treaties, diplomatic missions, the trade, and\r\n&gt; &gt; countless\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other factors, I am completely mystified that a technological advanc=\r\ne by\r\n&gt; &gt; one\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; country would not be almost immediately adopted by the other two. I\r\n&gt; &gt; demand\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an explanation. (But if that is impolite I meekly beg one.)\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -d\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ride wanted, off planet.
