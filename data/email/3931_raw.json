Was he a retainer for a\n&gt; daimyo or other lord? I\n&gt; have never come across any references about Musashi\n&gt; being enthralled by a\n&gt; retainer bound, which is an essencial part of the\n&gt; definition of ?samurai?\n&gt; from a historical point of view.\n\nNot necessarily. Being born into the class was an\nessential part of being a samurai--you didn&#39;t\nnecessarily have to &quot;serve&quot; someone, per se, though we\nall think of it as such. For instance--the highest\nmember of the samurai class, the daimyo, didn&#39;t\n&quot;SERVE&quot; anyone else, really--only himself. Is he by\ndefinition, not a samurai? Hardly.\n\nWhile I&#39;m not a Musashi fan, he was born into the\nclass, as I recall, making him by definition a\nsamurai. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
