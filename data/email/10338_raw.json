Chiefs of Mission filled in during periods when no\nambassador was appointed or accredited.\n \nThe Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series presents the\nofficial documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy\ndecisions and significant diplomatic activity. If you want to know what the\nUnited States was doing in Japan and how it viewed Japan, this is the place\nto go. Volumes appeared in various editions and under varying titles until\n1870, when the series became known as Papers Relating to the Foreign\nRelations of the United States. All volumes through 1951 are no longer in\nprint at the Government Printing Office, but they may be available in print\nor microform from publishing clearinghouses or commercial reprinting firms.\nIn addition, the Foreign Relations series is in most Federal Depository\nLibraries and major university libraries.

However, when the Samurai revolt (probably not the correct\nway of stating it) began in 1871(?), which Tom Cruise played the part of a\nYankee soldier (The Last Samurai) sent to help the ruling family change the\nmethod of fighting, criticism of the movie was mostly about the Americans\nnot being involved but the Portugese and Germans. Was their ever any attempt\nto have the Americans assist in the training? Did the United States have any\ntype of consul or ambassador in Japan during this period? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
