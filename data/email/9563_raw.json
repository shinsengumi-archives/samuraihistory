Th=\r\nis points up the value of this list, firstly, with the\nlearned scholars gen=\r\nerously giving of their knowledge, and secondly to\nrealise that most Englis=\r\nh references are not to be relied upon for\naccuracy.  Is there any recent e=\r\nquivqlent publication in English that\nupdates Papinot???\n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n\n\n=\r\nAccording to member Tatsunoshi, Jeroen Lamer&#39;s book on Oda Nobunaga\nhas the=\r\n correct info.\n\nI think it is safe to assume that any books published by a =\r\nuniversity\npress since the 60&#39;s or so should be pretty reliable. Probably s=\r\nome\nbefore that, but I&#39;m just sort of arbitrarily assigning a date. \nTurnbu=\r\nll relied(s) heavily on Papinot, at least for his early Samurai\nbooks, so i=\r\nt is generally a good idea to get a second opinion on his\nbooks.  \n\n\n"
