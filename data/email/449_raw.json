During the Edo period it was \nstill possible to be trained in these systems as the authorities clamp down \nwas not 100% successfull and could not be enforced. \n I am not too sure about this but I believe that it was only the Daisho set \nup that was the sole right of Samurai..Peasants may have been &#39;allowed&#39; one \nsword (usually the Wakizashi) if their public duties required it of them.\n Yagyu Shingan Ryu Heijutsu was a system that taught to many various classes \nof people and the ryu has slightly different techniques depending on the \n&#39;needs&#39; of the trainee...i.e Higher class members such as Daimyo or high \nretainers were taught techniques both with the Katana and also the Muto-dori \nthat would have to be used in the presence of ones senior if attacked..Lower \nclassed trainees were taught techniques that could be used by them in \ncircumstances they could be caught up in.\n The term used by the school for this is &#39;Bushi yawara&#39; or Warriors Jujutsu \nto seperate it out from, say, Suhada Jujutsu (or Jujutsu in &#39;everyday&#39; clothi\nng)\n Since the sword was also taught in the Yagyu Shingan ryu it can be assumed \nthat there were similarities there with the Jujutsu...\n So basically wether the person was allowed to wear the swords depended more \non the time he is shown in and the position he occupies..Tokugawa society was \nfar more stratified than the organization had ever been before and the \nclasses were kept quite distinct during the period..It would have been &#39;bad \nform&#39; to train students in weapons they could not be expected to carry \nopenly..so the training was probably hidden or hushed up by the trainees.\n Hope this helps ya!\n Abayo.\n Ben Sharples\n\n"
