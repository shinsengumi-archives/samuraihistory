I have saw them in LA, and even here, our &#39;Nippon Video&#39; \nin Honolulu have many. They carry Japanese versions, non subtitled, and \nthe quality is often so-so, because they use very cheap quality tapes, \nand probably make copies of copies of copies of copies.\nHowever, I have bought &#39;Matsu to Toshiie,&#39; (25 tapes!!!) and I actually \nlike it. They usually cost $3 to 5 per VHs, and every VHS carries 2 \nepisodes (and some commercial!!!).\nIf anybody needs a certain series, I might go after Christmas and see \nif they have it. Usually they carry only recent stuff, thou, say from \nthe last 3-4 years. They have a few mini-series as well, and quite a \nfew old samurai videos (illegal copies, of course, made from original \nJapanese videotapes they sell for an exorbitant $20 each!!).\nWhat I dream to do one day, is to buy a DVD-R and put the whole stuff \non DVD. Then it would be much easier to preserve the quality and to \nshare.\n\nOne question: does anybody have a &#39;chronology&#39; of the Taiga drama?? \nWhat was shown on a certain year and so on...?\n\ncepo\n\nOn Dec 9, 2003, at 4:41 AM, William&Mikiko Letham wrote:\n\n&gt; Taiga Drama is a year long historical drama (about 49 episodes; used \n&gt; to be\n&gt; 50) that airs from January to December. It started in 1963. Most of the\n&gt; dramas take place in the sengoku or bakumatsu period. They usually \n&gt; have the\n&gt; biggest stars in Japan. This years which just finished here in Japan \n&gt; was\n&gt; Musashi, next years will be Shinsengumi. A condensed version is often \n&gt; shown\n&gt; at the end of the year, and this it was is available on video and DVD \n&gt; (Tobu\n&gt; Ga Gotuku is one of them). the only full length one I have seen \n&gt; released is\n&gt; 1983s Tokugawa Ieyasu. The ones available here are of course without\n&gt; subtitles.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another miniseries about Saigo Takamori is Takarazaka with Satomi \n&gt; Kotaro.\n&gt; Its about 4hrs long and is on Video. Its also shown frequently on \n&gt; cable. The\n&gt; Family Channel here in Japan will repeat it as well as some other \n&gt; recent\n&gt; jidai geki over the shogatsu holidays.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
