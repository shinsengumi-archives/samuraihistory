Olson&quot; &lt;ShakuOhCho@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nHello Fellow Warriors,\n\nIn reference to the question of what other items does\na Samurai Warrior carry with him onto the battlefield,\nother than his weapons? I have read in several books,\nThe Five Rings & Others & I have heard from several of\nmy Jpanese friends who have studied Japanese Samurai\nHistory and who have heard many Samurai family tales\nof Olden Times passed down from generation to\ngeneration, \nThat to be a Surviving Samaruai Warrior one had to be\nand Excellant Runner, one who would Run into the\nBattles and take several well placed whacks and or\nslashes , dispatching 3 or 4 departed Warriors, and\nwould then run off from the fight just temporarily\nlong enoug to wipe the Blood from his Blades, &\nperhaps check them for knicks and sharpness & if in\nneed quickly sharpen them, he would then immediately\nrun back to the Warring Action and again Enguage his\nEnemies, repeating the afore mentioned proceedure as\noften as necessary, until the Battle was Won! If this\ninformation is accurate and I believe that it is, A\nSamurai Warrior would also have to carry into battle a\nrag to wipe the blood from his blades and some type of\nsharpening stones and perhaps Clove Oil to lubricate\nand protect his Blades!\n\nShaku-Oh-Cho, The Samurai Warrior/ Priest/Bard /Prince\nof Love\n\nMyron K.
