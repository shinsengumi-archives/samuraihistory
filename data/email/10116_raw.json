(In fact, swords seem to appear more \nfrequently  in various mythologies than other weapons, but perhaps that&#39;s because \nthey were  common to many cultures.)\n \nYou also make it sound as if Buddhism and Shinto are mutually exclusive,  \nbut if that were true, it seems unlikely that so many Buddhist temples  \nthroughout Japan would include Shinto shrines somewhere on their grounds.   It \nseems to me -- from both study and personal experience -- that Shinto is as  \ndeeply ingrained in the national character as Conficianism is in the Chinese  \nculture.  I&#39;m saying this not only based on texts by both foreigners and  \nJapanese, but on the simple basis of how ubiquitous Shinto symbolism is  \nthroughout the country. \n \nOn another matter...  Speaking of the northern Imperial line, can you  (or \nanyone on the forum) tell me who, if any of them, might still have clung to  \ntheir claim to the throne around 1500?  I know that in theory that line had \n been &quot;reabsorbed&quot; into the southern line, but I can&#39;t help thinking there \nmust  have been holdouts...\n \nAny help?\n \n--RMB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
