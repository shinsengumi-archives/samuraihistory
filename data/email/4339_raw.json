Seems to me the terms are used interchangeably.  Why?  \nJust a question.  :-)  Take care.\n\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
