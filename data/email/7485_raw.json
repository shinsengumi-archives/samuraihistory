This is known as cho-musubi (butterfly knot).\nDaimyo-musubi is a simpler knot where a knot is tied close to the kurikata\nand another is wrapped and knoted near the end of the saya. They are not\nalways easy to tie and new, stiff sageo make better and easier knots.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dean Wayland&quot; &lt;dean@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, August 15, 2005 12:32 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Significants of sageo knots.\n\n\n&gt; Hi Michael,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Do the knots tied in the sageo on a traditional katana sword sheath\n&gt; &gt;have any special meaning? I have seen some that are very intricate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not as far as I know, but they may have acquired meanings during or post\n&gt; the Edo era, as so many things have done. But I could be wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Also in some Japanese prints I see mounted samurai wearing a large\n&gt; &gt;ring over their sword. What is it for?\n&gt;\n&gt; This device is the &quot;tsurumaki&quot; or &quot;bow-string wrap&quot;. It&#39;s used for\n&gt; carrying a spare string for the bow. It is made with a deep channel\n&gt; (circa 30mm deep) around the outer edge, so the string can be wrapped\n&gt; within the trench and be protected by it. This is done because the tsuru\n&gt; is coated in resin which means that you can&#39;t just stuff it away in a\n&gt; pouch/pocket without it being possibly damaged. The resin which is to\n&gt; some degree still fluid, flows away from creases, and you have to wipe\n&gt; the crease smooth again before using it. And you really don&#39;t want to be\n&gt; doing this in the middle of a battle! Tsurumaki can be made of rattan\n&gt; (split vine), wood, or lacquered paper. They are normally suspended by a\n&gt; strip of printed leather or other textile, from the obi (when worn with\n&gt; a katana), or from the sword&#39;s waist cord (forgotten the name) in the\n&gt; case of a tachi. Go here to see a couple of modern made rattan tsurumaki\n&gt; as used in kyudo for a close up view:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.coara.or.jp/~lucyfer/kyugu/accessories/tsurumaki33-e.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this is useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean\n&gt; ***\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt; Head Of The Fight School\n&gt; http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
