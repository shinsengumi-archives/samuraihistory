Time period makes a big difference in Japanese\npersonal names. Not too many &quot;Daisuke&quot;s running around\nin the 1400s, but there are plenty now. \n\n&gt; I cannot use Makoto for the forename.\n\nWhy not? Knowing why not might help us suggest an\nalternative. \n\n I would prefer\n&gt; the forename to\n&gt; be easily shortened according to English principles\n&gt; (i.e. &quot;Tad&quot; for\n&gt; Tadaka), \n\nAs Kitsuno said, the Japanese don&#39;t shorten their\nnames according to &quot;English&quot; principles. If you are\nhaving him interact with non-Japanese characters for\nthe most part, then I can see them giving him an\n&quot;English&quot; nickname, like the example you use above.\n(Being as &quot;Tad&quot; is unpronounceable by a Japanese, it&#39;s\nnot likely to stick--it would come out &quot;Tada&quot; or\n&quot;Taddo&quot;. I&#39;m not familiar with &#39;Tadaka&#39; as a given\nname either, but I suppose it could be one...maybe.)\n\nMore and more Japanese given names ARE short\nenough--hard to shorten &quot;Shinya&quot; or &quot;Jun&quot;, though\n&quot;Jun&quot; could itself be short for &quot;Junpei&quot;,\n&quot;Junichirou&quot;, or 1000 other names. You could take\n&quot;Daisuke&quot; and make it &quot;Dice&quot; (kinda cool), or\nRyuutarou and make it &quot;Ryu&quot;, or something like that. \n\nand I would like the surname to be\n&gt; connected to any\n&gt; well-known samurai family or clan in Japanese\n&gt; history, preferably\n&gt; someone heroic. Ideally in the Shimazu family, but\n&gt; not necessarily.\n\nIn the Shimazu family? Then you&#39;ve got your\nname--Shimazu. If you mean connect ed to the Shimazu\nfamily, I&#39;m sure someone here can dig up the names of\na few of their retainer families. Something that\nrecognizable would be a little odd, but not unheard\nof, and that may be the effect you are going for. \n\n&gt; I do not read or speak Japanese.\n\nHappy to help--but I&#39;m not going to just throw random\nnames out there without getting a better idea of what\nyou are looking for. I don&#39;t know whether the others\nwho&#39;ve chimed in (sans Kitsuno, who I know speaks\nJapanese) have any knowledge or background, but for\nmyself, I live in Japan, speak Japanese, watch way too\nmuch TV, and generally am surrounded by Japanese names\nall the time. Let me know if your time period is\nmodern or historical, what meanings you&#39;re hoping to\ninclude (you did in the email, so I can go with those\nif nothing else) and clarify the &quot;nickname&quot; thing, and\nwe should be able to help.\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
