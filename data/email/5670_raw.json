I understand samurai would were the crest of\n&gt; the clan he was joined with.  I was also wondering\n&gt; about facial hair.  I have seen some traditional\n&gt; pictures of older or senior men with facial hair and\n&gt; younger men having the clean shave.  This may seem\n&gt; very stupid but was having facial hair a symbol of\n&gt; seniority or age?\n\nRobert:\n\nI take it from your email address that you might be in\nthe military? I am too--US Army. Anyways, they didn&#39;t\nreally have anything quite like we did--no rank\ninsignia or anything like sergeant&#39;s stripes or\ngeneral&#39;s stars. \n\nSeniority within a clan would be shown in various\nways--seating arrangements at a conference, for\nexample. The higher ups up front, lesser samurai at\nthe back, of course. A higher ranking samurai would\nprobably have slightly better clothing, etc, because\nof better economic status (larger fief). On the\nbattlefield, he&#39;d command more soldiers, and\ncommanders of sufficient rank would be allowed to have\ntheir own standard--kind of like a flag rank officer\nhaving his own flag in the modern military. Mostly,\nthough, it was just &quot;known&quot; who outranked whom. \n\nAs far as facial hair goes, I&#39;m not sure if there was\nany set &quot;you must be XX old to have a beard&quot;. I think\nit was just a fashion thing--some men wore beards,\nsome didn&#39;t. I know that it was thought to &quot;look\ndistinguished&quot;, which is why many of the higher ups\nwore fake facial hair (Hideyoshi supposedly wore a\nfake mustache at times). \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
