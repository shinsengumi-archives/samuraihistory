I know\n&gt; the Takeda cavalry corps was superior, etc., etc. It\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter. You have half your army engaged in the\n&gt; North against Kenshin, why lose the other half against\n&gt; Nobunaga? Retreat.\n&gt; \n&gt; His generals were right\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Edwin Angulo &lt;mayalan@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I got a question, if you were Takeda Katsuyori,\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; would you do at the battle of Nagashino?, at this\n&gt; &gt; moment, i cant find the way to fight that battle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Edwin.\n&gt; &gt; \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nI agree sorry to be pessimistic but I find winning this battle is \nalmost impossible.  Perhaps if Takeda Shingen was still around and \nhadn&#39;t carelessly been shot by a lowly arquebussier (I think)Maybe \nthe battle could have been won, One of his famous quotes is &quot;A man \nwith deep far-sightedness will survey both the beginning and the end \nof a situation and continually consider its every facet as important.&quot;\nIf Katsuyori had taken his fathers advice he would not have charged \ninto the valley of death so to speak. Although he showed great \nsamurai spirit and followed the code of (Bushido) I.e to advance and \ndie in battle.  He really was fated I am afraid to lose.  Perhaps if \nhe had taken the castle at Nagashino earlier defeated Okudaira \nSadamasa and then spent time fortifying it and courting alliances \nwith other Daimyo then he may have held ground, but in the end the \nsuperior Oda-Tokugawa army would have won out.  Also the battle could \nhave been won if alot of what-if&#39;s happened, for example if the \nmessenger Torii Suneemon hadn&#39;t warned Ieyasu and Nobunaga the battle \nwould have been over and the Takeda could have perhaps swept onto the \nkanto plain (I doubt but maybe) If accounts of the battle are true \nthen Katsuyori was in a difficult position he had a classic problem \nfacing any general How to use cavalry as defensive troops? in my \nopinion he had no option but to become the attacker as he was \noutnumbered out gunned, perhaps out planned? (Sorry all you Takeda \nLoyalists) The use of arquebussiers behind screens with pike men and \nspear men was I think innovative on a scale never seen before, (I \nhaven&#39;t found out who masterminded this scheme it seems like a \nNobunaga scheme, opinions?) Therefore in conclusion Katsuyori could \nnot have won the battle unless a number of what if&#39;s had occured and \nhe had taken the castle.  He was undoubtebly a brave soul but all to \noften in the history of the Bushi it seems that tragic heroes have a \nplace to play, they are there to be swept aside by the great warriors \nwho become myths then legends and eventually get to take the prize of \nbeing remembered as they say history is not written by the losers, (I \nwonder what Katsuyori would say if he was around, do we really have \nany right to judge him, Poor Katsuyori)\n\nBest regards Mark   \n\n\n\n\n"
