Whittaker\n&gt; also does a wrist-twist that&#39;s more Filipino stick than Japanese \nsword (the\n&gt; same move we see Cruise execute in solo practise in &quot;Last Samurai,&quot; \nfor that\n&gt; matter).  But &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; wasn&#39;t really about the Way of the Sword, \nso much\n&gt; as the Way of the Warrior.\n&gt; \tAnd it worked quite brilliantly as that, a modern man&#39;s \nsearch for a way to\n&gt; live out his vision of Bushido in the context of urban America.  \nHis loyalty\n&gt; is pure, and what gives him strength is that he&#39;s the only one who\n&gt; understands the story he&#39;s written of his life.  His own &#39;lord&#39; \ndoesn&#39;t get\n&gt; it, although he works with it.  One of the bosses is old-world \nenough to\n&gt; understand the kind of man who&#39;s after him, and most of the mob \nsoldiers are\n&gt; living essentially as samurai - that is, they&#39;re household warriors \nserving\n&gt; a specific family, with their loyalty and their skills determining \ntheir\n&gt; status in the household structure - but they don&#39;t realise \nthemselves what\n&gt; an old-world power structure they live in, and the Whittaker \ncharacter does.\n&gt; \tWhat I saw in Whittaker&#39;s sword work was a man who had \ndecided he ought to\n&gt; practise this, but had no instruction.  As I recall, his combat \nhandgun work\n&gt; was rather well done.  So the weak sword style seemed a flaw that \nwas\n&gt; consistently in character.\n&gt; \tBesides, recall that before katana, swords were sheathed in \na style that\n&gt; would look &quot;upside-down&quot; to a modern kendo practitioner.  Look at \nthe way a\n&gt; tachi is rigged for wear.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tGereg\n\n\nJust keep in mind the character he plays is INSANE, probably \nschizophrenic, and is not a &quot;modern Samurai&quot; except in his insanity.\n\n\n"
