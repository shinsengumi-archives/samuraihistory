Seeing battle lines are being drawn up I had better take up my \nposition on the defences!!\n&gt;\n&gt;Stephen Turnbull&#39;s books have done more to popularise the military history \nof the samurai and Japan in the western world than any other author.  \nWhilst I would agree with some, and I do make some critisism at times, that \nhis work is not perhaps 100% academic, contains some errors and does suffer \nfrom a degree of repetition, it has never the less provided a firm \nfoundation over the past 25 years for the &quot;samurai enthusiasts&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Stephen had an interest in Japan and the Far East from his early days and \nthis no doubt helped him in his studies at Cambridge University and \nobtaining a Doctorate from Leeds with his thesis on the Hidden Christians \nof Japan. He has ben a member of the Japan Society for many years and is \ncurrently an Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of East Asian \nStudies at the University of Leeds.  So on one point a small correction, he \nis associated with a great university..  He is also associated with the \nSamurai Gallery of the UK National Armouries and has acted as consultant to \nthe BBC, The History Channel and &quot;Shogun&quot; anmongst others...\n&gt;\n&gt;I first met Stephen in the early seventies when he and I were both members \nof the North Cheshire Military Modelling Society, there his infectious \nenthusiasm for the topic made me a convert. We still occassionally bump \ninto each other up and down the country. His first book on the samurai \npublished in 1977, &quot;The Samurai: A Military History&quot; was a mammoth task for \nthose days and ignited a thirst for knowledge on the subject in the UK .\n&gt;\n&gt;My own reasonably extensive library has over 20 Turnbull publications on \nvarious aspects of the samurai competing for space with books in japanese, \ngerman, french, italian and polish as well as many others in english.  I \nhave much respect for Stephen in that he &quot;put pen to paper&quot; and put &quot;his \nhead above the parapet!&quot; (how&#39;s that for mixed metaphors...). It is almost \na standing joke between us that my book has yet to come to fruition - but \nthen I am an engineer!\n&gt;\n&gt;I would recommend that you view his website and perhaps obtain a couple of \nthe books from a library before you decide to purchase your first... I am \npresently making my way through the two great volumes of collected papers \nin his editorial work &quot;The Samurai Tradition&quot;  {published cost over \u001b$B!W\u001b(B200}\n&gt;\n&gt;                 \nhttp://freespace.virgin.net/stephen.turnbull/publications.htm\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, as another english author did say... &quot;let loose the dogs of war!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;                         Rod Johnson  :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cepooooo&quot; &lt;cepo@e...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; After studying premodern Japanese history for a few years through the \ntexts of the\n&gt; &gt; classic American historians (Keene, Varley, Hall, etc.), I finally got \nme a couple of\n&gt; &gt; books from Stephen Turnbull. While he is not associated with any great \nUniversity, his\n&gt; &gt; work seems to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is not an amazing writer \n( imean; his\n&gt; &gt; style), but he seems to be truly in love with the subject, and I really \nlike the way he\n&gt; &gt; fills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind of (perhaps?) \nself-made scholarship\n&gt; &gt; is available.\n&gt; &gt; Since this is the first time I write, I was wondering what you \n&quot;samurai-maniacs&quot; public\n&gt; &gt; think of Turnbull in general.\n&gt; &gt; Any book you would suggest in particular?\n&gt; &gt; Thanx,\n&gt; &gt; cepo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\u001b$B$&quot;$J$?$N\u001b(BPC\u001b$B$r&lt;i$k$?$a$KDj4|E*$J%;%-%e%j%F%#BP:v$r!#%^%$%/%m%=%U%H\u001b(B \u001b$B%;%-%e%j\u001b(B\n\u001b$B%F%#&gt;pJs%;%s%?!&lt;\u001b(B http://www.microsoft.com/japan/protect/hm.asp \n\n\n"
