There are\n=\r\n  &gt; occasional acts of this type recorded even into the Sengoku, but by\n  &gt;=\r\n then it was probably so rare as to be a novelty. Yamanaka Shikanosuke\n  &gt; =\r\nwas challenged by Shinagawa Daisen during a seige of Gassan-toda\n  &gt; castle=\r\n, and were allowed to fight it out in front of the two armies.\n  &gt; This was=\r\n a little different, as they didn&#39;t march out and declare\n  &gt; names, I thin=\r\nk the challenge to Shikanosuke was specific.
