Kuji may have been a part of ninjutsu\nbut his books are ull of stuff form Tibet etc which is\nnot Japanese Ninjutsu.\n\nHe made his millions out of it so I doubt he cares\n\npaul\n\n\n--- Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nSaw the History channel or was it Discovery special on\nNinja,\n      I am not sure if this was a repeat but it\nfeatured Stephen Turbull as \nthe voice of reason and Steven Hayes as a &quot;modern day\nninja master.&quot; I \nhave to ask if any of you all saw it and what did you\nthink,\n\n-t\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
