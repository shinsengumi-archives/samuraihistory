After that, Buke had been growing and increasing power gradualy. Buke did have stronger power than Emperor since Heisi ( Kiyomori Taira ) and followed by Genji ( Yoritomo ) , then Asikaga, warriors days to Nobunaga, Hideyosi, and Yeyasu Tokugawa ( Shogun ) for over 260 years, ruining Japan . Even under Buke, Emperor has been still aliving.However, at the end of Tokugawa , Edo era, Buke had been vanished completely and disappeared . Then, under new government , MEIJI, Emperor returned and started to ruin Japan again .Why did Buke vanish in Japanese history after 1,000 years since birth ? \n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDiscover the new Windows Vista\nhttp://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=windows+vista&mkt=en-US&form=QBRE\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
