If you reply\ndirectly to me, I&#39;m going to directly answer,\nespecially when addressed in an argumentative and\ncombative manner. I&#39;ve got no problem if you or he/she\nor anyone wants to argue the merits and foibles of\nhistory books, in specific, or in general. I DO have a\nproblem when this is couched as a counterargument to\nmy statement, because it doesn&#39;t counter my statement\nwhatsoever. \n\nWhat we had was this: \n\nNate: &quot;Tangerines are not red.&quot; \n\nDissenter: &quot;Well, neither are all apples red! So how\ndo we really know which ones are red and which ones\naren&#39;t? Does it matter? What does it matter if your\napple is red and my tangerine is blue, as long as it\ninspires me? And certain tangerines may be of such\nhues of orange that they may be very very close to\nred.&quot; \n\nSimple facts: not everyone can tell that tangerines\nare not red. Many tangerines may be so orange they are\nclose to being red, but being red is not the point of\na tangerine. For purposes of this analogy, all apples\nSHOULD be red--the fact that many are green or brown\nis a warning to the partaker that they need to check\ntheir apples before they eat them, but not grounds for\nsaying that a. all apples are bad, or b. all\ntangerines are equally red with apples. \n\n\n\n That there\n&gt; is an overlap in the\n&gt; use of film or other fiction and the use of\n&gt; non-fiction historical works. I\n&gt; think that each instance of citing either film\n&gt; and/or historical works needs\n&gt; to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis rather than\n&gt; by using sweeping\n&gt; statements i.e. &quot;history books seek to tell the\n&gt; facts whereas film/fiction\n&gt; seeks to entertain.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nina \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 10:01 PM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai? (was\n&gt; RE: [samuraihistory] R\n&gt; e: h itokiri k\n&gt; \n&gt; [snips]\n&gt; \n&gt; However, that wasn&#39;t the issue I addressed. I\n&gt; addressed the issue of\n&gt; historical works versus fiction works. You can point\n&gt; out all the issues with\n&gt; various historical works you wish, the simple fact\n&gt; is that historical works,\n&gt; by definition, in a historical context, have greater\n&gt; value FOR THE PURPOSE\n&gt; OF SEARCHING OUT HISTORICAL FACTS, then fiction\n&gt; works do.\n&gt; Anybody who&#39;s more inspired by Sansom&#39;s Volume I\n&gt; than by Kurosawa&#39;s Rashomon\n&gt; has no heart--however, Rashomon is a work of\n&gt; fiction--inspiration is the\n&gt; point, not facts. Each accomplishes their goal\n&gt; admirably--and confusing the\n&gt; two is where we run into issues. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Yahoo!
