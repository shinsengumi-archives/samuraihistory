What I&#39;m looking for is old scrolls of travels and documentation. \n\nThis man interest me because I&#39;ve followed his tales starting in Greece and Rome, to all parts of the world, over a very LONG time. It can&#39;t all be the same person, offspring I&#39;m guessing. I&#39;ve lost the story in Japan. At least the written story. I picked it up again in Hungry during the 1500&#39;s, but there is still mention of him training with the Samurai and personally protecting the emperor for some times.\n\nAnyway. I&#39;ll find it. Was just wondering if anyone had heard any folk tales, seen any paintings or art referencing a white or silver haired Samurai or any thing around that time period.\n\nThanks,\nEB\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
