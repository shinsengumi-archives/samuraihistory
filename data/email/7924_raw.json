It still requires a significant amount of \nhand-formatting, putting the &#39;--------------&#39;s between each comment, typing each little &#39;-&#39; \nin one by one several times while going through the comments.   I have \nserious doubts that any of the Outlook users really have this sort of time and/or \npatience for this sort of custom-formatting.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I dunno, just a thought. I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m worrying about it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThat actually is a very good question -- really, why are you worrying about \nit? If users (using ANY email format) can be encouraged to snip out the \ncomments that are not directly relevant, then I don&#39;t see what the huge deal is about \ndoing a bit of scrolling down to see the relevant comments that a poster is \nreplying to. \n\nMany people use Outlook, with their reply format on many other lists that I \nparticipate in.  Snipping out old comments that aren&#39;t relevant does frequently \ncome up as an issue on these lists. But the &quot;top-posting&quot; thing has never \ncome up as an issue on any of these lists other than this one.\n\nAs for me, I&#39;m now at home and using AOL. So no top-posting here.  :)\n\nNina\n\n"
