I was wondering if anyone here&#39;s watching the weekly Historical \ndram=\r\nas of NHK.  I&#39;ve been watching them since my college days starting \nwith th=\r\n &quot;Aoi&quot; series.  Just a question, how accurate are they?  I&#39;ve \nbeen mostly =\r\nintrigued with the &quot;Toshiie to Matsu&quot; series back in 2002, \nand I&#39;m wonderi=\r\nng if Hideyoshi and Toshiie were really that connected \nas protrayed in the=\r\n series.  (Obviously I&#39;m a fan of the Sengoku Jidai)\nThanks...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
