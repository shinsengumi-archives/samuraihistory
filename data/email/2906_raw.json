Uchi-katana is short for &quot;kata-te uchi \nkatana&quot;, which literally means single-hand-strike sword. The tachi and \nthe katana were never limited to a two-handed grip and are just as \nagile if not more so than a claymore.\n      If Kendo is your only example BTW, you need only look at the \nKendo-kata and or the Seitei-Iai kata for single hand cuts, blocks and \nthrusts...\n-t\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com \n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
