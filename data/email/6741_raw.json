They know nothing about history, culture, and can barely \nspeak their own language. And they know very little of the people they \nrule because they all come from the upper class.\n\nThat was quite true of the Japanese &#39;feudal&#39; leader as well. Hideyoshi \nwas a good &#39;pacifier&#39; at home, and the fact that he was of lower \nextraction might have helped him to deal successful with people, but \nhis ignorance in geography and history of China and Korea costed him \ndearly.\n\nAlexander the Great did pretty well.
