I live in Sorong,\nwest-papua. I am\n&gt; interested in samurai and their history. I am a\nbeginner about\n&gt; samurai swords.\n&gt; I have a question about samurai. First of all, is\nevery samurai sword\n&gt; has a number on the sword?\n&gt; What is the meaning of this numbers?\n&gt; The samurai my friend told me have two numbers,\nfirst 1356 and the\n&gt; second numbers is 510023 are these numbers mean\nsomething?\n&gt; The samurai I talk about was found in a cave, in\nnorth sulawesi, are\n&gt; there a specific history event take place in there?\nSuppose 1356 is\n&gt; the year when the samurai was forged.\n&gt; Thanks anyway for those who willing to share their\nknowledge.\n\nHi Edhie. I do not think the sword has been brought to\nPapua by a \nsamurai. Most likely, a Japanese soldier in WWII.\nRegarding the \nnumbers, are they Arab (=roman) numbers or Chinese\nnumbers? I doubt \nJapanese swordsmiths used Arab numbers in the 14th\ncentury...\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
