Some days ago I posted a question\nhere and so far only received one answer. Although two others reacted to it,\nit was not abut the question. Maybe it was the way I asked, maybe nobody\nknows anything to help me. Just in case some of you overread it I give it\nanopther try:\n\nThe other day I had a discussion on the rules and restrictions the samurai\nfaced in daily life concerning the use of swords. The guy I was talking to\ninsisted on the idea, that they were forbidden by law to draw their swords,\nunless told to by their superiors.\nMy point was that there were only resctrictions to the drawing of swords on\ncertain occasions like being at the shoguns palace or in the court. I guess\nthere are many more times when it was forbidden but those are the points\nthat instantly came to my mind. I think that apart from that, there were no\nlaws that restricted the drawing or the use of the sword. One example here\nwould be kirisute gomen.\nMy request to the members of this list would be to name any kind of source\nthat proves my point as I donï¿½t want to rely only on one or two sources I\nhave at hand right now. I can use english, german, french or japanese texts.\nEspecially original sources or their modern day transcriptions would be\ngreat (i.e. osadamegaki, buke shohatto). Any help will be appreciated.\n\n\nThank you very much for your time\nKarsten Helmholz\nGermany\n\n\n\n"
