Conversely we see Sumo wrestlers cut off their topknots when  \nending their (monk-like?) life in the sport and re-entering  \npedestrian life.\n\nAt the coming of age ceremony a young samurai boy has his head shaved  \nand dressed for the first time in the style of an adult. As an adult  \nhe accepts all the responsibilities of his house, his life, his body,  \nserve his lord and by extension belong to him. He is expected to  \navoid any action which would bring disgrace on his lord, so he must  \nalways dress and act properly. To fail to answer a challenge, to die  \nin a fight with your sword undrawn, to allow the name or the family- \ncrest of ones lord to be besmirched among other crimes, would all  \nbring great shame on your house and your lord.Hairstyle was a clear,  \nvisible representation of rank and position.(keep in mind these  \ncustoms may have had their origins in the age of war, but found their  \nextremes in the Edo period)\n\n\tSo we can imagine the shock of the villagers in the Seven Samurai  \nwhen they see a seemingly sane member of the bushi class shaving his  \nhead and removing his swords, to aid a little peasant boy. No wonder  \na crowd gathers! And Japanese filmgoers all recognize that with his  \nshaved head and the simple sash he is given he has assumed the guise  \nof a priest.\n\n\tIn the film Seppuku, the hero chooses to cut off the topknots of his  \nenemies rather than their heads, knowing that if they were true  \nsamurai they would have no choice but to kill themselves rather than  \nreveal their shame to their lord.\n\n\t\n\n-t\n\n"
