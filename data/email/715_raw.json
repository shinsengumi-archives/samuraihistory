The first was the introductory ceremony in which he \nwas given his first sword, the mamori-gatana, &quot;a charm sword \nwith a hilt and scabbard covered with brocade, to which was \nattached to a kinchaku (purse or wallet)... worn by boys under 5 \nyears of age&quot; (Stone, 433).  The second ceremony was the \ngembuku, which signified his acceptance as a man amoung \nmen.  At this time the child recieved his first real swords and \narmor and had his hair dressed in an adult coiffure.  From this \npoint of his life onward, he would be expected to specialize in the \nfunctions typical of his rank within the heirarchy of the clan, but \nwithout ever neglecting his training in the art of using the \nweapon that had been defined in the military code as the &quot;living \nsoul of the samurai.&quot;&quot;\nJust read that the other day.  Found it interesting that the &quot;charm \nswords&quot; were called mamori-gatana.  Could almost mistake that \npheonetically for english of similar meaning.  Some bearing on \nyour boy&#39;s day sword question I think.\n\nBrandon\n --- In samuraihistory@y..., Tom Helm &lt;toryu@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Boys day being just a month away here is a newbie question;\n&gt; \n&gt; All the research (which ain&#39;t much) I have done suggests that \nboy&#39;s didn&#39;t wear swords. They had there\n&gt; Genpuku thus were\n&gt; adults and strapped on an adult sword. in the Edo period \nyoung boys may have worn a tanto if they were\n&gt; of a good family\n&gt; but didn&#39;t wear swords in public until their coming of age.\n&gt;     The swords we see in tachi mounts made by well known \nnames are actually kazari tachi. Light elegant\n&gt; sometimes flashy\n&gt; little blades for courtiers or for ceremonial. NOT for boys but for \nadults who needed to wear a sword but\n&gt; didn&#39;t need to\n&gt; lug around a 3 shaku nambokucho blade to attend some eight \nhour paper wasting ceremony (still\n&gt; popular today).\n&gt;     Does anyone have evidence or reference to how we came to \ncall these boys&#39; swords or boy&#39;s day\n&gt; swords? Is there\n&gt; somewhere definitive scholarship on what boys wore, if \nanything?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom &#39;big boy&#39; Helm\n\n\n\n"
