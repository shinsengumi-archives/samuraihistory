After moving his capital to the captured castle of Inabayama (renamed Gifu), Nobunaga allied himself in 1568 with Matsudaira Motoyasu and Takeda Shingen (both ambitious daimyo to the north). The Takeda-Oda negotiations centred around the marriage of Shingen&#39;s son to Nobunaga&#39;s daughter. By 1571, Nobunaga was treating the puppet Yoshiaki with increasing heavy-handedness, and Yoshiaki was no doubt hoping that Shingen would come to his assistance. He didn&#39;t. As the Takeda and Tokugawa clashed in the early 1570s, it brought Nobunaga the problem of either standing aside of the issue or supporting one ally against another. When the Tokugawa requested support against Shingen, little was forthcoming from Nobunaga. This indicates Nobunaga&#39;s pragmatic diplomacy. Firstly, he avoided until the last moment choosing between two allies, and secondly, their regional campaigns allowed him to\n consolidate his position in Kyoto and prevent Yoshiaki easily finding a new champion.\nM.Lorimer\n\nEdward Alexander &lt;edy@...&gt; wrote:\nWell,Shingen nor Kenshin were allied with Oda.Shingen fought with Oda all his life(apart from fighting with Kenshin and others).Takeda Katsuyori continued the battle with Oda but finally Katsuyori was defeated at Nagashino.Kenshin fought also with Oda but I don&#39;t know if he won or not.\n\nEdy\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Eponymous13@... \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 07, 2004 10:25 PM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 784\n\n\n  Another thing about Nobunaga...\n         I agree with those of you who have said he&#39;s not a terrorist.  From \n  what I&#39;ve seen and heard, a terrorist usually works outside the law, working to \n  break it and create chaos.  Oda Nobunaga did no such thing.  He had the \n  sanction of Ogimachi, I believe, from about 1562.  He deposed the last Ashikaga \n  shogun, and was the first of what I&#39;ve seen called the &quot;three unifiers.&quot;  As for \n  working outside the law, he essentially WAS the law, as seen, and noted by \n  others in the group, through his repression of real or perceived threats and the \n  aforementioned deposition of Ashikaga   Yoshiaki.  There was no bigger bully on \n  the Sengoku block than Nobunaga, from Okehazama to Honnoji.  Shingen and \n  Kenshin it seems were little more than a sidenote (even if the largest of them) to \n  the Oda drive and wasn&#39;t one in some sort of alliance or another with the Oda \n  anyway?\n\n  L8r\n  Tim\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
