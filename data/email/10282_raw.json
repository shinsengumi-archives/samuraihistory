An example to give is when I was looking up information on Om=\r\noto-no-Saijin and when I found sites that have information on him it is und=\r\ner Otomo-no-Saijin while some sites have it under Omoto-no-Saijin. I&#39;m look=\r\ning for help on information regarding the Omoto clan in Japan (not the Otom=\r\no clan but I like the information your site provides on the Otomo clan) and=\r\n any help would be appreciated in doing so and thank you for the time that =\r\nyou took to help me with my request.\n\n\n"
