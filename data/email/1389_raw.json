And immensely.  I almost figured on that as Oda Hidenobu \n(also known as Samboshi), Nobutada&#39;s son, Nobunaga&#39;s grand son, and the \nrightful heir, was under the care of his uncle, Nobuo, not Toyotomi, who was \nmarried to his (Samboshi&#39;s) cousin, Cha-cha (Oichi-no-Kata&#39;s daughter by \nAsai), and knowing that Shibata was an Oda retainer and that Asai had \nsupported Asakura at Anegawa.\n  If my memory serves me correctly, it was the protection of Samboshi that \nstarted the series of events that led -- ultimately -- to Shibata&#39;s \ndisastrous defeat at Shizugatake and his and Oichi-no-Kata&#39;s suicide at \nKita-no-Sho.  (Of course, the blame for THAT defeat goes to one Sakuma \nMorimasa, the general that disobeyed Shibata&#39;s orders to stop after his \ndefeat of Nakagawa Kiyohide.  Although I cannot say that Shibata was exactly \nhimself honourable or without blame, as he was back at Kita-no-Sho and \nnowhere NEAR the battle when it occurred.)\n  Now, when I go back to do the correction and rewriting process, I can \nrewrite with that in mind, b/c the story takes place sometime between 1570 \nand 1573 (I&#39;m not too sure right now, although as events unfold within the \nwriting, that will most certainly be determined), right during the time \nOichi-no-Kata was married to Asai.  Part of the story already written \ninvolves both Tokugawa and Toyotomi.  (As the story I am working on is \nfiction, Shibata -- who is, alas, one of my favourite figures in Japanese \nhistory -- is, unfortunately, not a living presence or factor, although he \nhas been mentioned a couple of times so far.)\n  Your help is much appreciated!!!!!  And if I have any more questions (and \nI&#39;m sure I will), I will not hesitate to ask them here!!!!!  (-:\n\nThanks a million again!\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
