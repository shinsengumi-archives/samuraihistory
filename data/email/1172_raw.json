It is a major exhibition improving on the already excellent \nOriental gallery at the Royal armouries museum Leeds. The event will \ninclude mounted horse archery which will be a real spectacle to \nbehold. I am very excited about this, is anyone else going to go \nmaybe, we could all meet up, heres the info anyhow copied from website\nwww.armouries.org/leeds/what&#39;s_on/special.html\n \n19 to 28 October   &#39;&#39;Bushido&#39;: The Way of the Warrior \nA celebration of the splendour of Japan and its many customs. Take \npart in our Samurai school, be amazed by Japanese horse archery, and \nenjoy a tour of the Oriental gallery. There will be a handling \ncollection so visitors can get a real feel for the culture and \noriental themed children&#39;s activities. \n\nAll the best Mark\n\n\n\n"
