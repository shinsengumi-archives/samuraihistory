Do you think Hisamitsu was discouraged by the \nfailure of koubu-gattai to advance Satsuma&#39;s interests and realised he \nneed Saigo&#39;s talents to represent the han? (Saigo was sent almost \nimmediately to Kyoto.)  Jansen (Sakamoto Ryouma and the Meiji \nRestoration p.191)  says that at this time toubaku was being expressed \nmuch more in Satsuma: maybe the Choushuu situation and general \nincrease in anti-bakufu feeling also influenced Hisamitsu&#39;s decision.\n\nPerhaps one of the Oukubo biographies would shed more light on this. \nDoes your university library have them?\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all.\n&gt; I&#39;m writing my graduation thesis on Saigo Takamori.\n&gt; Does anybody know why he was perdoned by Hisamitsu and recalled \nfrom \n&gt; his second exile on 1864?\n&gt; All I found is that Okubo and others asked it to the hanshu.\n&gt; Other opinions?\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS:Sorry for my English, may be my Japanese is better :P\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
