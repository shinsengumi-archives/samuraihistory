But they\n&gt;are still jobs. Not ranks. \n\nNate - again I&#39;m agreeing with you here. :) I think the issue is \nprobably more or less in how we are both coming at the (English) work \n&#39;rank&#39;.\n\n&gt;&gt; On top of that there were of course the ranks in\n&gt;&gt; terms of the \n&gt;&gt; Shoku-i \u001b$B%=%r!&lt;%U\u001b(B system.\n&gt;\n&gt;civil ranks, not military. Completely different from\n&gt;the issue being discussed.\n\nAgreed. Point withdrawn.\n\n&gt;&gt; Ah - here&#39;s what I was getting at. But beyond this,\n&gt;&gt; of course an \n&gt;&gt; ashigaru is lower than a taisho. So at some level\n&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t you be \n&gt;&gt; able to call this a &#39;rank&#39;?\n&gt;\n&gt;No. While the position is obviously higher than a\n&gt;footsoldier, it&#39;s still not a RANK. It&#39;s a job. You\n&gt;don&#39;t make &quot;Taisho 3rd Class&quot;.  \n\nHere I think is where it looks like we&#39;re just using different \nterminology. Which is what I was trying to get at by saying &quot;rank \nand promotion&quot;. We can probably agree more violently if we change \nthe terms slightly. Would you agree to the phrase, for instance, that \na taisho outranks an ashigaru?\n\n&gt;&gt; Then of course to confuse matters more we have that\n&gt;&gt; Ashigaru \n&gt;&gt; Taisho.....\n\n&gt;Who leads a larger group of ashigaru than a\n&gt;ashigaru-kashira, but is still performing a JOB. \n\n&gt;&gt; This specific example seems in my way of thinking to\n&gt;&gt; blur the lines a \n&gt;&gt; bit. It seems to me that once &#39;promoted&#39; to\n&gt;&gt; ashigaru-gashira a person \n&gt;&gt; would not go back to being a plain ashigaru. In\n&gt;&gt; other words this one \n&gt;&gt; seems more like a permanent promotion rather than\n&gt;&gt; just a \n&gt;&gt; battle-by-battle job assignment. What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt;A company commander is higher than a platoon leader,\n&gt;and once you&#39;re a company commander you&#39;re not going\n&gt;to ever go back to being a platoon leader. However,\n&gt;they&#39;re both still JOBS....descriptions of\n&gt;function...not RANKS. \n\n&gt;handle the command of a Brigade, etc. HOWEVER, they\n&gt;are not equal. I&#39;m a captain, but have not had command\n&gt;yet--I&#39;m filling a staff position. I filled a staff\n&gt;position at my last assignment also. So while my rank\n&gt;has not changed, nor will it in the next few years, my\n&gt;POSITION has, and will. I will take company command in\n&gt;a year or so--but that doesn&#39;t change my RANK. See the\n&gt;difference? \n\nI do. But then again, I think that your personal experience and your \ntechnical expertise is coloring too much the way you are using the \nword rank. But then again again, I don&#39;t know how the original \nposter really meant the question either - so I might be the only one \nhere who sees this my way (wouldn&#39;t be the first time....)\n\n&gt;There WAS no rank system in a sengoku army. Don&#39;t\n&gt;confuse ranks with &quot;ranking&quot;. Obviously some people\n&gt;were more important than others, and some jobs were\n&gt;more prestigious, etc. But you didn&#39;t start as\n&gt;Ashigaru 2nd Class, work up to Ashigaru 1st Class,\n&gt;then Gunsou, then 2nd Samurai, then 1st Samurai, etc. \n\nYes, exactly. Which is (again) what I meant by the &quot;rank and \npromotion&quot; comment - which I guess didn&#39;t really express what I \nwanted it to.\n\n&gt;You simply can&#39;t fit the square Sengoku army peg into\n&gt;the round modern military hole. \n\nAbsolutely agreed - believe me. However, the round modern military \nhole is not the one and only way to understand the word &quot;rank&quot;, \neither.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
