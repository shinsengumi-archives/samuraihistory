Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Changsub Lee\n\n--- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Finally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not yet\n&gt; mollified by Western \n&gt; influences and got rid of  Buddhism.\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
