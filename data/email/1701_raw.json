You truly have a treasure in your \npossession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it professionally \ncleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the blade \nmean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to get it \ncleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.\n  Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.  Professional \npolishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two years \nand $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will keep \nany rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.\n  I hope this helped you.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
