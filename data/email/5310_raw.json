The whole thing about the\n&gt; Mongols was that \n&gt; they took their infrastructure with them, no?\n\nTrue--which is easier when you can pack it on a horse\nas opposed to putting it on a ship, but point well\ntaken. The problem would be how much foraging would\nthey be able to do, while harassed by samurai guerrila\nfighters? Who knows. \n\n&gt; Also: forgive my ignorance, but where was Japanese\n&gt; horse-archery at \n&gt; the time we&#39;re talking about? Didn&#39;t samurai start\n&gt; out as mounted \n&gt; archers? This sounds like an interesting discussion\n&gt; to have...\n\nSamurai were mounted archers at first. But individual\nmounted archers didn&#39;t fare so well against clouds of\narrows launched by mass formations of Mongols, as the\nsamurai found out to their chagrin. Nor did the\nMongols respond to well to a samurai riding out,\nshouting his lineage, and challenging them to\nindividual combat. They had to adapt, and did so. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail is new and improved - Check it out!\nhttp://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail\n\n"
