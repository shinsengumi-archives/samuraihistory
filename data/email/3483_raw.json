I mean, to call someone on an asinine assertion is one thing, \nand should be done and gotten by.  And I admit, I&#39;ve laughed at some of the \none-liner responses, b/c they are sometimes very funny.  Unfortunately, it just \nseems like it&#39;s every other post where we get something that&#39;s jabbing at \nsomeone needlessly.\n       I can&#39;t tell y&#39;all how much I&#39;ve learned since I&#39;ve been here, much of \nit from Tony, and I&#39;ve enjoyed learning it and most of the banter back and \nforth has been nice too.  It has to a point inspired me to learn more about \npre-Meiji Restoration Japan, although I&#39;ll probably never be on a par with Tony \ncertainly, Cepo, William and others.  And yes, I agree, the Samurai do not, \ncannot exist in the 21st Century world.  They went the way of the buffalo in the \nnineteenth century.\n       Take care, y&#39;all.  8-D\n\nL8r.\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
