Dell&#39;Era &lt;dellerad@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, March 03, 2002 1:13 AM\nSubject: re: [samuraihistory] Chushingura question\n\n\n&gt; Hi, everybody.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ve been reading all your posts for months.\n&gt;  Thanks for your data (about Nobunaga&#39;s sons,\n&gt;  and a lot of bibliography, and that particularly\n&gt;  interesting bit about modern ships&#39; names...\n&gt;  and so on...).\n&gt;\n&gt;  I was wondering if you could help me with this\n&gt;  nagging question about old translations. I can&#39;t\n&gt;  remember nor find Mitford&#39;s tales right now\n&gt;  (they must be somewhere around here...) and I\n&gt;  need to check what kind of prose he used in his\n&gt;  retelling of the 47 Ronin story. Was it exotic?\n&gt;  Folkloric? Did he try to get across the meaning\n&gt;  to the anglophone audience in any special way?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Any suggestion will do. You know, this has\n&gt;  nothing to do with scholarly research. It&#39;s a\n&gt;  silly bet I want to win in the next few hours.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks again.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Saludos,\n&gt;  diego d.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
