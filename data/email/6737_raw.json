Tom has already replied \n\nwith \n\n&gt; a terrific and informative message. Btw Tom, what&#39;s the reference \n\nfor \n\n&gt; the story about Hisamitsu and his silver pipe? Is that in the \n\nYates \n\n&gt; biography? I don&#39;t own it and I&#39;m not going into the uni library \n\nfor a \n\n&gt; couple of weeks so can&#39;t check up on it.\n\n&gt; Thanks, but I&#39;m just an amateur who&#39;s fascinated by bakumatsu \n\n&gt; history, especially the complex relationships between the shishi \n\nand \n\n&gt; the han authorities - I know more about Choushuu than Satsuma \n\n&gt; though.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Good luck with your thesis\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Gillian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n\n--- \n\nYahoo!
