She is samurai after all, and this is the\n&gt;barbarian who just killed her husband.\n&gt;\n&gt;Alt.alternative is that the kids stab him to death in his sleep.\n&gt;\n&gt;Roll credits.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thomas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;--- \n&gt;Yahoo!
