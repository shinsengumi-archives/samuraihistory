I am sure several of you have an opinion on this\ntopic, and I wanted your input. It is said that  \n&gt; Sen no Rikyu committed sokotsu-shi after a command from Hideyoshi. I\nbelieve that Hideyoshi lost his temper and later regretted having\nordered this, but that is irrelevant perhaps. What  \n&gt; I want to know is what the exact reason was for ordering Sen no Ryku&#39;s\nsuicide. I read somewhere that Sen no Rikyu refused to offer his\ndaughter as a concubine, but that seems to be a  \n&gt; few years earlier. Was there one event, or was this just a build-up of\ntention after this incident?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jonathan P. Ellgen \n \nIIRC, Hideyoshi&#39;s motives are not known for sure. Hideyoshi did a number\nof horrific and irrational things during the last decade of his life,\nand this appears to fall in to that category. I imagine it would have\nbeen over something quite small or petty, and I&#39;ve read that he did\nindeed regret it afterwards.\n \n-AngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
