They=\r\n \nsaid there are four great hitokiri at that time...\n&gt; \n\n   I&#39;ve heard of a=\r\n hitokiri by the name of Kawakami Gensai, he was one \nof the four great ass=\r\nassins of the revolutionary period. He was short \nand shinny, and could be =\r\nmistaken at first glance for a woman. \nContrary to his appearance, he was c=\r\nlever and clear-head despite also \nbeing the most dreaded among all the hit=\r\nokiri.\n   Master of an original sword-style called &quot;Shiranui-ryu&quot;, Kawakami=\r\n \nis famous for felling the great idealist Sakuma Shozan in one swing, \nin =\r\nmid-day. Kawakami is nevertheless a mysterious figure.\n   After the revolut=\r\nion he was unable to let go of the idea that Japan \nshould remain closed to=\r\n the world. Kawakami found himself in frequent \nconflict with the revolutio=\r\nnary government. Ultimately, he was accused \nof a crime he did not commit a=\r\nnd executed in the 4th year of Meiji. Oh \nand Kenshin Himura, from Rurouni =\r\nKenshin is based on Kawakami, and I \ndont know who the other Hitokiri&#39;s are=\r\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
