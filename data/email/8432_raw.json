In my Sado experience, when you receive the\ntea bowl, you turn in clockwise to get to the drinking\nside (each bowl has a &quot;face&quot;, which the host presents\nto you, and you drink from the side opposite the face,\nso you have to turn it). Once done, you turn it back\ncounterclockwise. Some schools make a big deal of\nturning it 3 times (not completely around, but using 3\nmotions to turn it halfway around), some don&#39;t--it\njust depends. B ut no, I&#39;ve never ever ehard of the\ndirection indicating your hostile intentions--sounds\nlike complete bunk to me. \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
