BRYANT (TONY),\n  My question was about the lasing of the lames for all parts of the samurai armour. I would like to know if you have any more diagrams, tips, or info. on how to lase the armour together so I better understasnd it. I looked at hundreds of different suits of armour and now that i&#39;ve picked out what kind I want to make, i just need to understand the construction process better. I&#39;m trying to make a battle ready suit of samurai armour. I&#39;m not going to have it on display or anything like that. I&#39;m trying to get into the re- enactment stuff so i need it strong and very durable. Also, is titanium a good metal to use for the lames or should i stick with stainless steel? And, what thickness of steel and leather backing should i use for the backing? Do i harden the leather? Whats the best way to attach leather, cloth, and lames together. I would gladly send you money for any shipping charges if you could put together some info. and send it to me. Hope to here from you soon.\n                                                       Thanks for your time,\n                                                           Mark \n\n&quot;Anthony J.

I just have some problems with lasing the lames\n&gt; together. You said that this guy is on this list. Do you know what screen\n&gt; name he goes by? While I was on the site I e-mailed him and he still hasn&#39;t\n&gt; replied. Maybe you could help me with a easier way to learn how to lase the\n&gt; lames together. If you have any more info. it would greatly be appreciated.\n\n\nI was out of town over the week-end. If you e-mailed me over then, I probably \nkilled it accidentally when I got back and started wiping out the 300+ spam \nmessages that accumulated while I was gone.\n\nWhat was the question? There are lacing diagrams on the site... what do you want \nthat isn&#39;t there?\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
