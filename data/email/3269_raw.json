The reason for\nthis was the disbanding of many defeated clans after\nthe Battle of Sekigahara (1600) by the victorious\nTokugawa Shogunate. These Ronin would figure\nprominantly in the Osaka Campaigns of 1614-1615 on the\nToyotomi side and during the Shimabara Rebelion of\n1637-1638 on the rebel side. These Ronin took any\nchance to strike back at the those who made them Ronin\nnamely the Shogunate and their Hatamoto. The Ronin are\noften depicted as the champion of the peasant and as a\ndangerious man during the Tokugawa Period. Many of\nthese Ronin also found service in the Tozama\nClans(outside clans) such as the Shimazu and Nabeshima\nClans.\n\nRonin Samurai also figured prominantly during the\nMeiji Restoration and the downfall of the Shogunate in\n1867-1868.\n\nHope I helped ya.\n\nJake\n--- Erik Larson &lt;skippyefa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What exactly are the Ronin?  I thought that they\n&gt; where Samurai that \n&gt; had lost their lord and lands.  Is there more to\n&gt; them?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
