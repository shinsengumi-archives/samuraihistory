With that,  so does scholarship.  My revered grandpop, Joe Nolan, \nhad retired as Medical Editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer. He counted the Mayo \nBrothers,  and  Jonas Salk,  among his close friends.  When Michael de Bakey \nperformed his first open heart surgery, &quot;Byline Joe&quot; got the first telephone \ninterview.   At an age when most were collecting pensions,  my &quot;Grandpa&quot; resumed \nPhysical Therapy.  His license was Number 2 given in the state.   At 78, he \nfinally took on a younger partner!  The year he died in 1979-----before he got \nsick----he planned to attend a convention &quot;so I can learn more in my field.&quot;  \nIf I can contribute half to my field what that Grand Old Man did in his, I \nshall feel a success.  I only wish he could have lived to see how blessed I am \nwith my Significant Other,  Dolly, who  appreciates my poor efforts, as did he.  \nOnce again, kudos to Tom.
