Especially the name\n&quot;Staerkodder.&quot;  Does that come from the attempt to sell it to Denmark?  I\nwas also unaware of the sister ship.  I have been having a hard time finding\ninformation on this ship.  I can only assume it is because I do not now\nwhere to look.  Woud you be so kind as to tell me where you found this out?\nMy main source of information so far has been on the US Navy Military\nHistory site.\n  I have an account written by one of the Confederates who served on her\nduring the trans-Atlantic voyage from France to Cuba.  I will dig it up and\nsend it to you if you are interested.&quot;\n\nAll the info was from &quot;Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945&quot; by\nHansgeorg Jentschura, Dieter Jung, and Peter Mickel. USNI Press 1992.\n\nMore info: Ordered for the Confederate States&#39; Navy as the Sphinx; launched\n21 June 1864, completed 25 October 1864; bought by Denmark and renamed\nStaerkodder, after being blockaded in Corunna by Federal warships Sacramento\nand Niagara the sale was not completed, and she was renamed CSS Stonewall;\n1865 surrendered to Federal forces after which she was bought for the\nShoguns fleet. You have the rest of the info from this point. A note of\ninterest is that in Conway&#39;s All the World&#39;s Fighting Ships they state that\nthe reason for the US retaking ownership from the Japanese after the initial\npurchase was because the Japanese simply did not yet have the facilities to\ntake care of her nor enough experience to crew her. Once the Japanese were\nready they once again took possession and that is when she was renamed\nKotetsu.\n\nThe other source for the above is Conway&#39;s All the World&#39;s Fighting Ships\n1860-1905.\n\nIf you want more details as to armament and type of armor manufacture just\nlet me know. Most you have already but there are some differences between\nConway&#39;s, Jane&#39;s and Warship&#39;s.\n\nHer sister the Prussian/German Prinz Adalbert: (Source-Conway&#39;s 1860-1905\nGerman section)\n\nDis: 1535 tons\nDim: 186&#39; 8&quot; overall, 165&#39; 7&quot; at the waterline, 32&#39;6&quot; beam, 16&#39;6&quot; draft.\nMach: 2-shaft HSE, 1200ihp=10kts.\nArmor: Wrought iron, Belt 5&quot;, tower 4 ?&quot;.\nArmament: 1-120mm, 2-170mm.\nCrew: 130\n\nThis ironclad ram originally known as Cheops, was under construction at\nBordeaux for the Confederacy, to her builders design, together with a sister\nship Stonewall Jackson, later the Japanese Azuma. She was purchased for the\nPrussian Navy in June 1865, but not put into service until a year later. She\nwas not a particularly good bargain, being a bad seaboat, and the timbers of\nher composite hull rapidly fell prey to rot. Though the Prussians replaced\nher original intended armament of three 32pdrs with bigger guns in the\nfive-ported bow position and in the two-gun octagonal citadel abaft the\nfunnel, she could not be considered a particularly powerful ship. She was\nschooner rigged. She was placed in reserve because of wood rot as early as\nOctober 1871, and disarmed in 1875/6.\n\nGee, it feels good to be able to actually answer something here on this\nlist! ;-)\n\nThe first mentioned book is easily available while the older Conway&#39;s are a\nlittle harder to find. If you are looking to get them let me know and I will\npoint you in the right direction.\n\nCheers\nBill M.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: M. R.
