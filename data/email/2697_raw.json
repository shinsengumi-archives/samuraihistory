Just because it \n&gt; wasn&#39;t written down? Sure, it may have varied from\n&gt; region to region and era to era, but the \n&gt; samurai as a caste surely had a set of expectations\n&gt; or ethics - whether self-imposed or \n&gt; imposed by others. If I&#39;m way off base, let me know.\n&gt; Related to this, I&#39;d like to know: is there \n&gt; any evidence for &quot;bushido&quot; prior to the Hagakure?\n&gt; What are the other main pieces of samurai \n&gt; literature?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
