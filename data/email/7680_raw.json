It was formed by the shogun?s government, the Tokugawa \nShogunate, to combat revolutionaries who wreaked terror on the \nstreets of the Imperial Capital. The corps existed for 5 years (1863-\n1868). It disintegrated with the collapse of the shogunate.\n\nThe Shinsengumi is widely depicted in Japan. SHINSENGUMI: The Shogun?\ns Last Samurai Corps (Tuttle Publishing) is the first book about the \ncorps in English. While focusing on the Shinsengumi, Hillsborough \nhas written a history-in-brief of the Meiji Restoration, Japan?s \ngreatest revolution. The revolution centered around the overthrow of \nthe shogunate in 1868 and the restoration of power to the emperor. \nJust as the Meiji Restoration is considered ?the dawn of modern \nJapan,? knowledge of this history is essential to understanding how \nand why Japan has evolved into the nation that it is today. \n\nIn this nonfiction historical narrative of the Shinsengumi, \nHillsborough spotlights the personalities of the corps? leaders. ?\nThis book is about bloodshed and death and atrocity,? begins the \nPreface. ?It is also about courage and honor and fidelity. It \nexplores some of the darkest regions of the human soul, and some of \nits most noble parts. The underlying themes?are the extraordinary \nwill to power and sense of self-importance of the leaders of this \nmost lethal samurai corps, and the unsurpassed propensity to kill \ninstilled by them into the rank and file.? The narrative is \nembellished by numerous vivid anecdotal episodes, including sword \nfights, assassinations and personal stories to illustrate the nature \nand spirit of the Shinsengumi. Also included are numerous quotes \nfrom letters, memoirs and interviews by corpsmen, eyewitnesses of \nevents and other people directly involved with the Shinsengumi and \ntheir history.\n\nRidgeback Press, publisher of Hillsborough?s Samurai History Papers, \nan electronic quarterly, is making signed copies of SHINSENGUMI \navailable to subscribers of the Papers. For more information on this \noffer and to view the book cover visit www.ridgebackpress.com.\n\nRomulus Hillsborough is an expert in Meiji Restoration history. His \nother books include RYOMA: Life of a Renaissance Samurai (Ridgeback \nPress, 1999) and Samurai Sketches: From the Bloody Final Years of \nthe Shogun (Ridgeback Press, 2001). He has appeared on TV specials \nfocusing on this history, including broadcasts of the History \nChannel, and NHK (Japan?s national public broadcaster). Hillsborough \nlived in Japan for sixteen years. Fluent in Japanese, he has worked \nas a staff writer for a Japanese magazine in Tokyo, and as a US \ncorrespondent for the Japanese press.\n\n\n\n\n"
