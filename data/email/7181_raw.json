I even talked to him a\n&gt; couple of years back. he\n&gt; has even tried to enter a few Ninjutsu Dojos I am\n&gt; referring to Genbukan, and\n&gt; Bujinkan. I am not aware if he applied to a Jinenkan\n&gt; dojo. \n&gt; I was introduced to him through a couple of\n&gt; Independent Ninjutsu Instructors\n&gt;  at the time I talked to him he was 13. \n&gt; he was also spouting off on some forums, talking\n&gt; some twisted things. he was\n&gt; tracked down and found out his real age. he also\n&gt; asked me about a webpage I\n&gt; had on making a Sword. he wanted to use it on his\n&gt; page. but I don&#39;t think he\n&gt; ever used it though..  good thing..\n\nHmm. Okay then. I suppose accidental parody is better\nthan none at all. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
