I&#39;v been out of town awhile and haven&#39;t checked my email recently. Now that you mention its a parody I still wonder why anyone would waste their time on creating a site that pokes fun at the perspective most Americans have of ninja. I mean will it change the attitude? Somebody&#39;s wasting their time I think. And definitely sarcasm is not something you spare Nate. \nLater.\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!!! Who in God&#39;s name\n&gt; created that site. It reads like a child wrote it.\n&gt; Ninja just flip out and kill people? Ha, ha, ha!!!!\n&gt; Somebody put the author out of his misery, please!\n\nAnd once again we have to explain that it`s a PARODY\nsite...\n\nSarcasm, Irony....a lost art, it seems. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
