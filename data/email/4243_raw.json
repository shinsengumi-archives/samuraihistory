Are they the actions of a\n&gt;state that you would trust in their position?? I suppose it is little \n&gt;wonder\n&gt;that no diplomatic solution was ever reached.\n\nWhile I certainly DON&#39;T hold the US blameless on many things the gov&#39;t has \ndone over the years, note the Phillipines were a protectorate controlled by \nthe US AFTER a war with Spain. The embargoes were an attempt to stop Japan&#39;s \naggressive expansionist campaign in Asia (Korea, Manchukuo ring any bells?).\n  The Japanese of today are NOT the japanese on 70 years ago. Japan at that \ntime was controlled by a ruthless military. A military that controlled the \nschools in order to indoctrinate children. A military that was quite willing \nto sacrifice EVERYONE (crushing the jewels was the common euphemism), not to \nprotect the Emperor but to save face. The same commanders who would command \nsoldiers to fight to the death then flee the battlefield.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n\n"
