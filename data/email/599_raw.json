Basically I&#39;m not a historian just a guy who\n&gt; loves reading history so the type of history books I would prefer to read\n&gt; are &#39;popular&#39;.\n\nI think the trouble is, there&#39;s a *perception* of academic vs. popular. Most\nacademic books are no more difficult to read, they just tend to have a tighter\nfocus on a specific topic or issue. One is free to ignore the seriously\nacademic trappings (usually found in the footnotes, which publishers, fearful\nof the book being deemed &quot;too academic,&quot; tend to hide in the back of the book\nand make reading it by academics difficult due to the constant flipping back\nand forth) and just read the book. I don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s read &quot;Heavenly\nWarriors&quot; or &quot;Hired Swords&quot; -- two of the best texts on the development of the\nearly warrior culture -- who hasn&#39;t come away with a deeper understanding of\nthe material and where samurai came from and how they developed. Though\nuniversities use these in upper-level courses in J. history, they are extremely\naccessible.\n\nThe same goes for &quot;Gates of Power&quot; and any number of other books. If one is\ninterested in a specific area, one should be willing to at least take a look at\nthe books before dismissing them.\n\n&gt; I guess trained historians are interested in such academic\n&gt; books, but I&#39;m just looking for a good story.\n\nWhat do you consider a good story? &quot;Hired Swords&quot; is full of interesting\nanecdotes about the evil taxman and how they behaved (I enjoy the quoted letter\nof complaint that talks about how they ride their horses right into people&#39;s\nhouses... &lt;G&gt;).\n\n&gt; So in reply to Mr. Byants\n&gt; comment that people don&#39;t delve farther into the feild my feeling is those\n&gt; books arn&#39;t very interesting to an amatuer historian.\n\nNo book is interesting unless you crack the cover and take a look inside. I\nhave been pleasantly surprised on more than one occasion by a book which, even\nthough in my field, I was sure would bore me to tears. There are cases when I\nwas right and was bored, but I&#39;m happy to say the ratio is in favor of good.\n&lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt; As for Massie, James\n&gt; Mcpherson who wrote the Civil War history &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; said that\n&gt; there was proffesional envy that his book sold well. Maybe this is the case\n&gt; with Massie (maybe not).\n\nThis happens. In fact, I&#39;ve encountered a bit of... well, difficulty... in some\nareas because of my Osprey books. While they&#39;re nothing I&#39;m ashamed of\n(although I really want to redo some of them!), there is a certain perception\nin some areas that I&#39;m not willing to do &quot;academic&quot; work. I&#39;m currently trying\nto disabuse people of these efforts with translations of 14th. century Japanese\nliterature and records.\n\n&gt; In any event I&#39;m not that interested in what the\n&gt; AHA thinks about an author, I liked his books and will read him again. As\n&gt; for Ambrose well I live in Japan (for some 8 years) so I haven&#39;t seen\n&gt; anything about his case. If true its sad because he is a good writer. So\n&gt; what I want to say is that I wish there were more popoular histories written\n&gt; about Japan. Imagine if someone wrote a book on the Meiji Restoration the\n&gt; way Simon Schama wrote about the French Revolution, or a biography of Oda\n&gt; Nobunaga on the scale of Massies Peter the Great.  Wishful thinking.\n\nThe trouble is, there&#39;s not much of a market in English on such exotic fellows\nwho most people have never heard of; we generally have to aim for the markets\nthat exist (academia), small though they be.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
