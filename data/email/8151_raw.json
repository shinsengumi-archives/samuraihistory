When his son passes. He goes outside to\n&gt; his dayimos and \n&gt; cuts off his ponytail and all the dayimos cut off\n&gt; theirs. They say \n&gt; it is for Hideyoshi son&#39;s soul. Is this an accurate\n&gt; portrayal of \n&gt; what might have happened? It was a very dramatic\n&gt; scene....\n\nThe movie you&#39;re watching, &quot;Owl&#39;s Castle&quot; (Fukuro no\nshiro), is a completely different case than the ones\nexplained. Hideyoshi is insane with grief--emphasis on\ninsane. He cuts his topknot off in a fit of grief at\nhis son&#39;s funeral. The daimyo gathered behind him then\nfollow suit--not out of grief at the death, but\nbecause Hideyoshi did it, so in order to appear loyal,\nthey must two. Several of the daimyo comment that\nHideyoshi has gone mad, including Ishida Mitsunari and\nTokugawa Ieyasu. In fact, the main reason Ieyasu\ncommissions the assasination of Hideyoshi is because\nhe believes Hideyoshi&#39;s gone insane--this is the whole\npremise of the movie. \n\nHideyoshi&#39;s not renouncing anything--you seem him\nlater in the movie, with a perfectly good topknot, as\nyou see all the other daimyo. Had he renounced the\nworld, he&#39;d have shaved his head, not just cut off his\ntopknot. His act is the equivalent of someone today\ntaking a baseball bat and smashing a window out of\nrage or anger. Don&#39;t read too much into that scene in\nthat particular movie. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________________ \nYahoo!
