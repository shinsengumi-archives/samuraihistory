Plus that is the second cover \nthat I know of.  The other has a sword on it.  There could easily be \nmore covers considering how long it has been published, but those are \nthe 2 that I know of.  My history professor recently wrote a book on \nChinese histiry (cannot remember the exact topic), and the publishers \nwanted to put a kanji on the cover that had nothing to do with the \nsubject of the book.  So they are not always related.  It might, but \nit might not.. I dont know the symbol.  As far as books on wafare and \ntactics THE ART OF WAR(or WARFARE) by Sun Tzu, and THE BOOK OF FIVE \nRINGS by Miayamoto Musashi are given obvious choices.  If you have \nnot read these texts I would suggest you do.  I have yet to read it, \nbut I did order a new copy of THE ART OF WARFARE that includes \nrecently discovered chapters, a commentary, and the original \nclassical Chinese text so that if you can read it you can varify \nthings for yourself.  It is available on amazon.com for about $18 \nUS.  Hoping it gets delivered soon, can&#39;t wait to give it a read.\n\n\n"
