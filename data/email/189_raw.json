It is said that\nNobunaga is of Taira descent. Something I was told\nthat may or may not be true. I felt I should mention\nit but it may not be true. What I CAN tell you is the\nfollowing:\n\n1) The Minamoto and Taira were NOT destroyed after the\nGenji-Heike wars. One thing that must be understood is\nthat with almost EVERY Japanese name, there are\nrelatives that took on other names similar to the\noriginal names...& sometimes, took on whole new names.\nThere are people still even today of the descent of\nthese two families, as there are existing people of\nvarious other families.\n\n2) Tokugawa DID threaten the emperor with changing his\nlineage. Its not like the emperor really had a choice\nanyway: at that time (like many other periods in\nhistory) the emperor had no true power so therefore\nnot only was Tokugawa Ieyasu SHOGUN by default, but,\nhad the lineage to defend it (not that many were\nfoolish enough to challenge HIM). Perhaps Ieyasu\nwished to save face with the people by allowing their\nultimate religious leader (the &#39;divine&#39; emperor) to\nexist as a figurehead.\n\n     My point to you is there are many stories that\nabound even today about these men. Some are true,\nothers are not. I leave to you what you shall decide.\nBut from what I have learned and what I truly KNOW, is\ntrue. These were not friendly men, nor friendly times.\nThe sad fact is they acted in ways that people today\nstill do, so is it really so hard to imagine the\nchosen behavior(s) that were taken to such lengths,\nreally hard to believe?\n\nI ask you to ponder this and reply...\n\n=====\n&quot;I am Mikhal no Shourinou, son of Toshiro of the village of Rin, and loyal retainer of the Maeda clan. Prepared, is the great Infinite for your impending arrival. Feel thy soul render upon my blade...&quot;\n     --- The Purple Rose\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
