Still as I said, th=\r\nere are many books where the use of the afore-mentioned banners is confusin=\r\ng. \n\nAnother thing which is unclear in many secondary sources is the use of=\r\n Samurai cavalry. I have read that cavalry were actually supported by infan=\r\ntry reatiners so the tactical mobility enjoyed by say European cavalry was =\r\nnot an option, as Japanese cavalry units could not and did not want to outp=\r\nace their foot element. Now I know Kurosawa portrayed some lovely cavalry c=\r\nharges in Ran but is the former assertion correct?\n\nI hope these doubts can=\r\n be cleared.
