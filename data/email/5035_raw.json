I have a Bakamatsu period nagamaki by Yamon Naokatsu. It\nis more like a wide sword than a naginata and has a shinogi but no yokote\n(as Tom says). The blade, which is almost straight has a choji-midare hamon\nin the Bizen style and is 74cm in length, the nakago is another 51 cm and it\nwas a ploishing nightmare I am told.\nThe pole itself is 1mtr 29 cm. There is a Namabam style &quot;cupped&quot; tsuba and\nthe top part of the pole is wrapped like the tsuka of a sword over same (ray\nskin) and there is a aogai lacquered section below this. It is a fearsome\nweapon which I would think was not easy to use, in fact this is probably a\nparade rather than a battle weapon, considering its late date.\nI think some katana blades were mountd in poles but this is probably Western\ndealer adaptations.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Tom Helm&quot; &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 04, 2004 6:10 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] nagamaki/naginata\n\n\n&gt; Rami-\n&gt; While they are both &quot;swords on a stick&quot;, the naginata in general\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have a yokote line delineating the point. Nagamaki &quot;poles&quot;\n&gt; would have been as long or a little longer than the blade. The age and\n&gt; shape of the blade are big factors in assigning something the Nagamaki\n&gt; designation in the absence of a yokote and a koshirae, in which 99% of\n&gt; such blades would be classed as naginata. Not sure this helps...\n&gt; -t\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
