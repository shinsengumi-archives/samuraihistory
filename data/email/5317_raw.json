The bakufu didn&#39;t take kindly to ANY\ntype of coup or insurrection--if they allowed the son\nto revolt against his father, what&#39;s to stop someone\nfrom revolting against them? A son overthrowing a\nfather would be against the entire Confucian value\nsystem enforced. \n\nIf we&#39;re talking Sengoku, then it could go either way.\n\n\n&gt; Thanks, Nate, for your input about the crucifixion\n&gt; of the criminals! yes, I meant apprehended\n&gt; criminals. Were hangings practiced in Edo Japan at\n&gt; all, for any reason?\n\nNope.\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
