I&#39;m a little\nskeptical--it sounds like something out of Martial\nArts Illustrated or something. Most images of samurai\nyou see preparing for a battle or a duel have their\nhakama tied back with leggings to keep them out of the\nway (assuming they aren&#39;t in armor, which would keep\nthe clothing out of the way by definition.) Kobakama,\nor shorter, tighter hakama, were frequently worn when\n&quot;expecting action&quot;. \n\nWere hakama worn exclusively by the samurai class,\nthen maybe I could see your answer making sense. But\nhow would that explain nagabakama, worn by courtiers\nand samurai during court functions? I&#39;m no clothing\nhistorian, but I know we&#39;ve got some here. Tony? Lady\nSolveig? Care to enlighten us further? \n\nOf course, I could just look at Tony&#39;s website: \n\nhttp://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html\n\n&quot;Hakama worn by commoners and laborers in Heian were\ntwo panel, and typically only reached to the mid-calf\nor a bit lower. During the sixteenth century,\nlow-class warriors often wore a knee-length two- or\nthree-panel hakama which were sometimes called\nkobakama, a terminology problem as regular hakama were\nalso called kobakama in the Edo period owing to the\nformal nagabakama being the �formal� norm.&quot;\n\nIf hakama were being worn by commoners and laborers,\nthen I hardly think a critical part of their design\nwould be to hide the movement of the legs from an\nopponent. \n\nContinuing: \n\n&quot;Earlier hakama, unlike modern martial arts hakama,\nhad two clearly defined legs, rather than having the\npleats overlapping left and right so that one can�t\ntell where one leg ends and the other begins. Another\nmodern feature is the koshita, the solid panel at the\nsmall of the back. This seems to have appeared\nsometime in the early Edo period or at the earliest in\nthe very late days of the sixteenth century, as\nearlier hakama were merely cut straight across the\nback as at the front.&quot;\n\nIf these things were developed in the Edo period, and\nhakama were being worn in the Heian period, then they\ncould hardly be part of the development of hakama. \n\nI&#39;d still like to see what Tony and others have to\nsay. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
