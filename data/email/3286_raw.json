I&#39;ve been a member of the group for about \n3 years now (although I don&#39;t post many messages) and I am always \nsurprised by the members of this group.  Not only do we have the \ngreat Anthony J. Bryant, but Nate Ledbetter, Kitsuno, Tom Helm, Cepo, \nand Prof Letham are all experts that I am honored to learn from. I \nread the daily digest sent to my home email with great anticipation.   \nThank you all (there are many that I did not mention).  This is the \nbest group on the web.\n\nOn with my question.  It has 2 parts.  \nFirst, I have seen some famous statue photos of Masashige Kusunoki.  \nIt is a huge bronze statue of the man, powerfully posed, on a huge \nhorse.  It seems to capture a strength that not many other statues of \nthis type reveal.  I&#39;d like to see it myself but I don&#39;t know where \nit is at.  I&#39;m living in Tokyo, and I know it&#39;s somewhere around \nhere.  Anyone know exactly where it is?\nSecond, does anyone who has visited the statue have other pictures of \nit?  I&#39;d like to get a small collection of photos so that I can make \na painting.  The staue would be a reference for the horse mainly but \nI&#39;d like to capture the strength of the samurai in it as well.\n\nThanks again.\n\nBrandon\n\n\n\n\n"
