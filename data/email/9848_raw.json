The perio=\r\nd I have chosen to cover is the millennium, from 600 to 1600.\nI aim to prod=\r\nuce a book that explains as close as possible to known fact how the militar=\r\ny forces operated in battle, i.e. how procedures evolved, and why the battl=\r\nes meant something to participants. There are many sets of rules for this k=\r\nind of game, and for computer-aided games, but I find they usually have bee=\r\nn constructed around MYTHS not fact. This I find more than annoying. The tr=\r\nue nature of events is fascinating, but I have limited resources to continu=\r\ne research as a loner. It is simply too big=A0a task.\nIf the group members =\r\nwill bear with me, I will be putting some simple questions about distinct p=\r\neriods of time, all with relevance to my writing of=A0more authentic=A0warg=\r\name rules.\nYou may find that my questions are not of the philosophical type=\r\n, but strongly pragmatic.\nI propose to divide the time period into sections=\r\n reflecting social and tactical changes, so that eventually a coherent deve=\r\nlopment can be observed in the conduct of warfare and statecraft.\nYours sin=\r\ncerely,\nEvan Hodge\n=A0\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have be=\r\nen removed]\n\n\n"
