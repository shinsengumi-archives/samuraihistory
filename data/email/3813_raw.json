Other than that, there wasn&#39;t much of a problem. (chuckles).\n&gt; &gt; You know, in a film where (1) the Meiji government employed Americans as\n&gt; &gt; military advisors, (2) an American learns Japanese and to fight as a samurai \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; three months, (3) samurai in 16th C. armour charge 19th C. artillary \n&gt; &gt; emplacements, and (4) ninja in black pajamas attack out of nowhere on behest \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the Imperial court...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think the issue of how or why they got a haircut right matters.\n&gt; you gotta remember it&#39;s a western hollywood movie, after all. so they\n&gt; traded anachronisms for drama. i agree, i don&#39;t quite like it either,\n&gt; yet the over-all effect of the movie was nice.\n&gt; at least they got a lot of the fighting styles and all the\n&gt; circumstantial &quot;stuff&quot; (for simplicity&#39;s sake) and even some of the\n&gt; philosophy right.\n&gt; \n&gt; maybe you&#39;ll be annoyed with me, but did samurai armour change so\n&gt; dramatically during the centuries, or is it just the plain fact of\n&gt; 16th against 19th century weaponry you&#39;re pointing at in (3)?\n&gt; \n&gt; where exactly is the problem with the last part of (4)?\n&gt; \n&gt; -j\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
