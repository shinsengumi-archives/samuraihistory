I now have a paul chen armour which I use for\nbashing about in.\n\nI started to dabble in simple armour making so I could\nunderstand how the stuff worked etc. I have never\nfinished a set yet, I just have a go at bits and\npieces, never made anything yet of outstanding\nquality. For good stuff in the USA you need to speak\nwith Anthony Bryant as he has had some really training\ncompared to some of us working from his notes and\nmaking feable attempts.\n\nMilwaukee public museum has about 11 sets of which I\nhtink 7 are on display (were last time I was there)\nall of which are in excellent condition. They are\nreally good there and let me look at everything in the\nstores and photo as much as I wanted. Shame was no one\nthere knows a thing about the stuff.\n\nPaul\n\n--- mark kd &lt;depos42300@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nHello again,\n  I just want to thank you guys(Dean & Paul) for the\ngreat advice. I really appreciate you guys taking some\ntime out and explaining all of this stuff to me. I\nmight sound stupid, but, i never even thought of going\nto a museum to see armor. That&#39;s a great idea!!!\nAgain, thanks a lot for all of the advice. I&#39;ll post\nsome pics up as i go along. Hope to hear some good\nreplies about it. Thank you.\n                                                      \n     Greatfully yours,\n                                                      \n       Mark\n \nP.S.- do you guys ever go to any of the SCA events? I\nlive in Buffalo N.Y. so if you go to any in Rochester\nN.Y. or most other cities in N.Y.,i might see ya\nthere.\n \n                         Later Guys!!!!!\n\nDean Wayland &lt;dean@...&gt; wrote:\nHi Mark,\n\nOkay, to really answer your questions I&#39;d have to\nwrite a book, and a\npretty big one at that, and there is no way that I&#39;m\nadequately\nqualified to even think about it, never mind the fact\nthat as I said\ntime is short, and your right that &quot;sucks&quot;.\n\n&gt;    Thank you very much for replying. Sucks you don&#39;t\nhave time. I have \n&gt;    my first child coming in 1-2 weeks so i&#39;ll\nprobably understand what \n&gt;    you mean.\n\nOh yeah, you definitely will....\n\n&gt; Oh well, i thought i&#39;d ask anyways. (you\nsure,...???? \n\nh yeah, I&#39;m sure...\n\n&gt;    $$$$$$) Let&#39;s keep it at that for now, but if you\nchange your mind \n&gt;    u have my e-mail.\n\nI have...\n\n&gt; Back to that first e-mail u sent me about \n&gt;    stitching the armor to the fabrics...,...a couple\nmore ?&#39;s then \n&gt;    i&#39;ll stop bothering u for advice.\n\nSo folks, I&#39;m a sucker...\n\n&gt;    1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of\nclothe?\n\nNO, just 3...\n\n&gt; Outer \n&gt;    Layer(that&#39;s what you see on the outsite),\n\nYep...\n\n&gt; a layer of Cloth \n&gt;    Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can a get\nthat?what size?,\n\nYep, and don&#39;t worry about trying to get hemp, its\nexpensive, use\n&quot;linen&quot;,  which is made from the &quot;flax&quot; plant, or just\na corse weave\ncotton, almost like a sort of fine heavy sack cloth.\nGo chat with a\ncloth merchant...\n\n&gt; a \n&gt;    layer of Very Very Very Thin Leather(goes under\nhemp layer),\n\nEr... no, the thin leather is the edge trim not a\nlayer...\n\n&gt; and \n&gt;    then the Inner Shell\n\nYep..\n\n\n&gt;(goes under v v v thin leather)?\n\nno, see above..\n\n&gt;is this layer \n&gt;    leather?\n\nno, this inner shell should be a soft linen, cotton or\nrarely silk, it\nhas to be comfortable as it goes directly against your\nbear skin...\n\n&gt; do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it and then\nmold \n&gt;    it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the whole\nway down the entire \n&gt;    KOTE and stay flexable?\n\nas I said no leather layer, it goes on the edge only,\nand if you boil\nleather, you get soup..\n\n&gt;    2. I understand stitching the mail down but about\nthe plates.. How \n&gt;    do sew them down. \n\nAll the plates on kote etc, have holes around their\nedges through which\neither the links of the mail pass, or where there is\nno mail, you use\nthread to sew it down...\n\n&gt;You talked about a &quot;running stitch&quot;???what&#39;s \n&gt;    that? i&#39;m not a sewer.\n\nWell there&#39;s another skill you&#39;ll need to learn to\nbecome a &quot;Japanese&quot;\narmourer, ask someone you know who sews, or visit your\nlocal library and\nget a book on sewing for beginners...\n\n&gt; Do a sew through the metal? Do i predrill \n&gt;    little holes??\n\nYes, as I described above...\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand that part. \n\nGood point, this is why I agree with Paul, go get your\nhands on the\n&quot;real&quot; thing, it will all become clear, especially if\nyou can find\nsomeone who&#39;ll talk you through it while you have the\narmour in your\nhands...\n\n&gt;    3. How do you put a running stitch across the\nmiddle of a solid \n&gt;    panal of mail? \n\nWhen I say &quot;solid&quot; I meant, composed of just mail, no\nplates, no big\ngaps. The word &quot;Mail&quot; comes from Latin via medieval\nFrench, and it can\nbe translated as &quot;net&quot; or &quot;mesh&quot;, its full of holes\nand you simply take\nyour thread and loop it round a bit of the mail\n&quot;tying&quot; it to the cloth.\nIt&#39;ll become obvious when you see a real kote up\nclose.\n\n\n&gt;    4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions\non how to lace \n&gt;    lames together????? I just can&#39;t seem to get it\nright. My armor is \n&gt;    all flimsy and isn&#39;t very rigid. My Lames are\nabout 1.5&quot; wide x \n&gt;    2.5&quot; high 10gauge stainless steal.(free from\nwork) I need to learn \n&gt;    some better methods on lacing them together. I\ndon&#39;t think i have \n&gt;    enough hole punch in each lame? Website&#39;s don&#39;t\nreally go into \n&gt;    detail on putting more than 2 lames\ntogether.(that sucks) Anyway, \n&gt;    if you have a good technique on lacing Lame\narmor, please let me \n&gt;    know.\n\nAgain, I feel a major work coming on, sorry, go look\nat the real thing.\nAlso try getting hold of a book entitled:\n\n&quot;The Manufacture of Helmets and Armour in 16th Century\nJapan&quot; by\nSekikabara Kozan translated by H.R.Robinson, and look\nat the diagrams in\nthe back...\n\nAnd finally, re your other email, as to tools, again I\nsuggest find\nyourself a friendly local armourer and get their\nadvice. Tony&#39;s website,\nwhich Paul has given you will help you if you can&#39;t\nfind someone to talk\nto.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m off to do all the other things that I&#39;m\nsupposed to be\ndoing, good luck with your project.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
