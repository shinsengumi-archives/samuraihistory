I just had a look through one of the photoalbums \n&gt;for this forum and came across something called a whistling arrow. \n&gt;What exactly was the purpose of this?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nKaburaya (whistleing arrow) ia a sort of arrow whose tip has hollow\nwhistle made with hard stuffs like antler and a kind of magnolia.  It\nwas originally used to scare quarries by hunters and in Heian and\nKamakura era, when riding archers had tactical importance,  war was\nbegun with shout and exchange of kaburaya shooting.  Gradually\nriding archers had given its importance to infantry,  kaburaya dissaperaed\nin Muromachi era.\n\nNowadays, kaburaya is used in Yabusame that is samurai mounted\narchery rite dedicated to some shintou shrines.\n\n*Kaburaya\n  http://www2.odn.ne.jp/yabusame-fg/karimata.jpg\n\n*Yabusame\n  http://www.shonan134.com/kamakura/yabusame/yabusame.html\n\n\n\n\n"
