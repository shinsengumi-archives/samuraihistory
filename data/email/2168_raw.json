The miniseries and book started many of\nus on the path, but when you actually study the\nhistory, the whole love story et al is SOOO\ncontrived...not to mention the language errors in both\nthe book and the miniseries...\n\nNate\n\n--- Saitoh Hajime &lt;the_sam_99@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Is Shogun also a movie? I thought it was only a\n&gt; book...\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you guys think of the Kurosawa samurai\n&gt; movies, are they \n&gt; historically accurate? I hear that Kagemusha is\n&gt; about using a double \n&gt; of Oda Nobunaga to hide his death. Was this fiction\n&gt; or are there at \n&gt; least some rumors to it?\n&gt; \n&gt; The Wolf of Mibu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate\n&gt; Ledbetter \n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Agreed....I think it will be painful. Horribly\n&gt; Wrong.\n&gt; &gt; And that&#39;s on top of how I feel about Tom Cruise\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; general. It will be the pain of Shogun (the\n&gt; &gt; translations, the Edo-jidai uniform kimono, the\n&gt; &gt; silliness of the whole love story) on a much\n&gt; grander\n&gt; &gt; scale. It will hurt. It will kill me. And I will\n&gt; go.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- &quot;Anthony J.

But what do\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guys think of it? Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you think it has the potential to be up there\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shogun and The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crapfest to make money\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I look at going to it much as I do going to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dentist. I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t like it. I\n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;ll hurt.
