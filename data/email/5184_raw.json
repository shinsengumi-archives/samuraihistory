He is dead\nnow but his son Robert has all of his material amd set\nup this site http://www.robertg.com/\n\nthe book was based on masaki ryu and had a lot  in it\nabout Nawa Fumio who is still alive (in his 90&#39;s) and\nonly recently retired from teaching. He will be the\nlast soke of his ryu as he has split it into 4 shihan\nlines. At leas 2 photos in the book feature Hatsumi\nmasaaki who left the ryu and later gained fame as a\nninja dude - Bujinkan Dojo.\n\nDont worry about being a wanna be ninja - it got the\nbets of us hooked at one time or another\n\nthe spikes and the stars are all known as shuriken.\n\nthe spikes are better know as Bo-shuriken\n\nHavent we discussed Shuriken etc in the recent past -\nmaybe worth looking at the archive onthe yahoo site.\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Silk Road School &lt;silk.road.school@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nAccording to the one book I&#39;ve ever seen that\ndiscusses the matter in any\ndetail - _Spike and Chain_  (covering manriki-kusari,\nshuriken and shaken) -\n&quot;shuriken&quot; refers only to the spike, dart and knife\ntypes of throwing\nweapon - basically, those which are only bilaterally\nsymmetrical.\nThe radially symmetrical ones - discs, stars,\ntriangles, squares- are\nproperly termed &quot;shaken&quot;.  The book was out in the\nearly &#39;70s, before the\ncresting of the wave of ninja silliness, and it\nappeared to be fairly\nsolidly researched.  I shed my copy back in &#39;75, so I\ncan&#39;t cite the\nauthor&#39;s name.\nNate, don&#39;t go thinking I&#39;m one of your &quot;resident\nninja masters&quot; on account\nof this, okay?\nGereg\n\nMessage: 2\n   Date: Wed, 11 Aug 2004 15:50:08 -0700 (PDT)\n   From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: caltrops and steel bars\n\n\n--- Edward Alexander &lt;edyhiphop@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Sorry for saying a stupid question but what are\n&gt; caltrops?????And what are those small discs with\n&gt; very sharp edges?????(how are they called)\n&gt;\n&gt; Edy\n\nCaltrops are spikes placed/strewn on the ground to\nimpede/distract a pursuer, etc. The general shape of\n&quot;tetsubishi&quot; (&quot;iron diamonds&quot;) is a 4 pointed object\nwith the points such that if you throw them down,\nthere is always one point up and 3 points as a base.\nThink of jacks, from the kids game, except sharper.\n\nThe small discs with the sharp edges you refer to are\nshuriken. There&#39;s several names according to the\nshape, etc., and I&#39;m sure one of our resident ninja\nmasters will pipe up and tell us, but I&#39;m not sure\nwhat all they are. I know under the heading of\n&quot;shuriken&quot;, you&#39;ve got all sorts of shapes and sizes\nof throwing knives, including the disc and star shaped\ntypes.\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
