So far, \nI&#39;ve got Choshu in the Meiji Restoration, the Making of Modern \nJapan, a Diplomat in Japan, the Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu, and \nSamurai Sketches. The Making of Modern Japan and A Diplomat in Japan \nhave some information, but its&#39; very sparce and general. I&#39;m \nparticularly interested in why Hakodate was chosen (I suppose \nbecause at the time Ezo was very loosely controlled), the role of \nlocal peasantry in the overthrow of the Tokugawa forces there, \nYoshinobu&#39;s reaction if any, how Hijikata Toshizou got there, when, \nand how it affected the troops after his death (I noticed fighting \nkept on for almost two months afterwards); any information on \nEnomoto Takeaki (I know nothing about him except that he was in \ncharge of the navy), if any Aizu troops fled the destruction of \ntheir han and made it to Hakodate (likewise if any of the \nshogitai/shinsen gumi went as well, I know by that almost all the \nshogitai were massacared and by this time almost all the shinsen \ngumi had fled/been killed), and just exactly how stiff resistance \nwas (I know pretty there was some heavy fighting, but just how \nintense was the Meiji attack before the end).\n\n\n\n"
