The guy has a japanese\nwifde who can translate old and new ninja books and he\nstill cant get it right, Hatsumi snesei is as he\nclaims a ninja soke, so considering this and the fact\nhayes was training with Hatsumi in 75 he should have\ngot something right by now.\n\nAnything Hayes writes I would take with a pinch of\nsalt.\n\nYep I know I am slamming the man, and it may be wrong,\nbut so many people have been duped by him that he has\nmade a vast fortune from his crap\n\nPaul Richardson\n8th Dan - Bujinkan Dojo\nwww.hanako.co.uk\n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
