The throwing star is technically a\nshaken. (Would anyone care to translate the two terms literally?  I&#39;d be\nvery curious to understand the distinction between shaken and shuriken,\nlinguistically.)  I&#39;ve only seen one book discuss the matter - _Spike and\nChain_ (it&#39;s an overview of shaken, shuriken and manriki-gusari), so if\nanyone has any information to the contrary I&#39;d be interested in that as\nwell.\n        Gereg\n\n\n\n"
