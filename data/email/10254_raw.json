I was hoping that you had experienced the\n  purpose of the ceremony regarding the beautiful sound of the bowl.\n  If you have any idea or maybe know of someone who does I would love to\n  know.I can send you a photo if you&#39;d like.\n  I Thank You so very much for your time and look forward to\n  hearing from you.\n  Once again Thank You, Sincerely Holly Lange\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
