I have passed it to one of my\nstudents who is writing an article on the comparrison\nof wearing katchu compared with modern day military\n(armour)equipment\n\nI have also been in touch with a friend int he Kotroi\nshinto ryu who is also going to provide information on\nthe katchu rokugu.\n\nwhen hes finished it I will post it on my web site\nwww.hanako.co.uk for you all to see.\n\nif anyone else has anything to add please let me know\n\npaul\n\n\n--- CRAZ &lt;crazoftheages@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nA lot of things, actually.  Just to name a few, there\nwas the kubi-bukuro (A netted bag used for carrying\nthe head of a worthy enemy), the kate-bukuro which was\nessentially a provisions bag, or uchi-gae which was a\nsmaller ricebag.  Things like uchi-bukuro (money\npurses), yo-bukuro (handkerchiefs), kinchaku\n(medecine), and tenugui (cotton towels) were carried\nunder the do.  There was also a multi functional rope\ncalled a koshi-nawa, which might be used for anything\nfrom seccuring prisoners to tethering a horse, as well\nas a second rope called the kawa-nawa, which had 3\nhooks at the end and could be used for combat or\nclimbing walls.\n\nProbably the most interesting thing I&#39;ve heard of,\nthough, was a floatation device called the uki-bukuro\nmade up of several inflatible (don&#39;t ask me what\nmaterial, I never could figure it out) little balls\nthat balanced the weight of the armor while crossing a\nriver or stream.\n\nHope this helps you,\nCRAZ\n\n\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi \n&gt; \n&gt; When a samurai goes onto the battlefield, other than\n&gt; weapons, what else does he carry about his person\n&gt; (food, medicine, etc)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
