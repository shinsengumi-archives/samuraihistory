I\n&gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; think anyone is &quot;pissed off&quot;.  Some people just\n&gt; feel the \n&gt; &gt; need to correct perceived misinformation - some\n&gt; through \n&gt; &gt; educating, some more directly through less\n&gt; diplomatic \n&gt; &gt; means.  I tend to rely on the first method, but do\n&gt; enjoy \n&gt; &gt; the second method as well.  And I think I have at\n&gt; least a \n&gt; &gt; semi-valid point in my comparing a westerner\n&gt; saying &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; want to be a Samurai&quot; to a Japanese person saying\n&gt; &quot;I want \n&gt; &gt; to be a Confederate&quot;....  I also do think that the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;lifestyle&#39; is great, but it isn&#39;t a &quot;Samurai&quot;\n&gt; lifestyle. \n&gt; &gt;  If anything it is a Zen or Buddhist lifestyle;\n&gt; calling it \n&gt; &gt; a &quot;Samurai lifestyle&quot; is a fallacy and a bit\n&gt; farcical.\n&gt; &gt; Some people don&#39;t realize how odd they sound until\n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; are shown things from another perspective, so I\n&gt; like to \n&gt; &gt; think I was facilitating that while only being\n&gt; marginally \n&gt; &gt; insulting  ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt;  M.Nakazaki\n&gt; \nni hao.\nthis is tim heaton......again.\ni once learned that being a samurai meant being the\nway of the sword,in which had so much history and\nrespect as well as fear behind it.and a man to choose\nthis path was not quit yet discoved in completeness as\nthe chinese had lessoned,so many joined armies and\nsuch to try and futhermore their accomplishments in\nthe way of the sword but because it was man ruling\nmore so than teaching the lesson reamained abscent and\nman just became powerful with the sword and just a\nfragile amount of the awarness in being with the sword\nbut still the samurai became and few to be the way.the\nrespect of the blade is not just its temperment and\nthreat in being in the wrong hands.\ni learned from hopes of those who influence the\nsamurai had in mind to study these things together\nlike alchemy to term the way of the sword(iron\ndragon,tai chi,kung fu,the buddahs palm,and\nzen)stillness of the blade with man having the mind to\nobserve how dangerous he is even to himself to take up\nthe sword. in being is a method not quite tought to\nkeep the secret of masturing the sword but still many\nhave almost mastered it through years of practice,but\nthe feeling of the sword in mind of too many men\nbecame dangerous.in conclusion to ones eye your no\none,to your own you may be all or nothing as well,and\nto many you may be awsome ,to god you too cruel or a\nreal man,and again who and what was a samurai.and from\nwhat i have studied i am going to do my best at\nbecoming a true samurai someday and leave this modern\nworld behind for its own self ruining. sincerly tim heaton.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
