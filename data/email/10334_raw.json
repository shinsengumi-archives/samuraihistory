These were the struggles between various clans and=\r\n the Shogunate for control of Japan after the Perry era and leading to the =\r\nMeiji restoration.This also involved modernisation of the state and trying =\r\nto preserve Japan&#39;s independence from the colonial powers- notably Great Br=\r\nitain, France and the U.S.A., who wished to take economic control in the wa=\r\ny that was starting in China. \n\n This modernisation,however, wasn&#39;t to ever=\r\nyones taste, especially for many Samurai, hence a series of rebellions incl=\r\nuding 1877 which is basically the theme of the film. \n\n As to actual milita=\r\nry assistance, the Japanese were understandably cautious about where to get=\r\n it from. France and Britain were the main source of weapons initially as t=\r\nhey were the world&#39;s major powers.\n\n There were French military missions to=\r\n the army in the &#39;60s whilst the British provided naval training, and many =\r\nof the ships.The US had no military reputation prior to their civil war, bu=\r\nt lots of surplus weapons afterwards! They then did supply, unofficially, s=\r\nome advisors but I haven&#39;t got my file handy with fuller details.\n\n Portuga=\r\nl had once been the only country allowed to trade with Japan but were repla=\r\nced by the Dutch East Indies Company in about 1642(?), and they eventually =\r\nsupplied limited numbers of flintlock muskets which the Japanese copied and=\r\n used until the 1860s, but such trade was strictly limited- one ship a year=\r\n IIRC.  \n\n Germany did not come onto the scene until after their victory in=\r\n the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1), as the country did not previously exist =\r\nas such; they then replaced the French as their reputation had taken a beat=\r\ning.\n\n As to diplomats, all powers including America had representatives in=\r\n Japan; indeed I think Japan sent an ambassador to Washington in about 1868=\r\n?\n\n A fascinating period and much overlooked, most histories merely saying =\r\nsomething on the lines of &quot; Perry opened up Japan, the Emperor was restored=\r\n to power and Japan became a modern state&quot;!\n\nBTW, it is very doubtful if mo=\r\nre than a handful of the Samurai at this time still fought in armour or eve=\r\nn on horseback- so ideas about 16th century armies with modern firearms are=\r\n off the mark.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nNick\n  \n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;DuaneS&quot; &lt;desolley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am assuming that the American in=\r\nterest in Japan faded after the American Civil War began.  However, when th=\r\ne Samurai revolt (probably not the correct way of stating it) began in 1871=\r\n(?), which Tom Cruise played the part of a Yankee soldier (The Last Samurai=\r\n) sent to help the ruling family change the method of fighting, criticism o=\r\nf the movie was mostly about the Americans not being involved but the Portu=\r\ngese and Germans. Was their ever any attempt to have the Americans assist i=\r\nn the training? Did the United States have any type of consul or ambassador=\r\n in Japan during this period?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
