Guess I need to\n&gt; refresh myself on \n&gt; Japanese history, as I seem to be getting things\n&gt; wrong. Am from \n&gt; Australia and have limited resources on Japanese\n&gt; history. So sorry \n&gt; once again for my stuff ups. Looking at the meaning\n&gt; for both though I \n&gt; thought Warlord was a better term for Shogun as a:\n&gt; Barbarian �is  &quot;primitive or uncivilised \n&gt; 1. a crude uncouth ill-bred person lacking culture\n&gt; or refinement \n&gt; Companied to:\n&gt; War-lord � means armed fighting between countries\n&gt; 1. supreme military leader exercising civil power in\n&gt; a region \n&gt; especially one accountable to nobody when the\n&gt; central government is \n&gt; weak\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
