A simple hut hastily constructed with \nwooden \n&gt; sheilds strategically placed all around it and then enclosed with \n&gt; &quot;curtains&quot; to hide activity within from the eyes of the enemy. \n&gt; Variations of this may be seen in many a film and taiga drama. \nThese \n&gt; are called Jin-ya.\n&gt; \tA kuruwa is &quot;an enclosure&quot;, and I suppose could be used to \n&gt; describe something as simple as the above though today it is used \nto \n&gt; talk about the &quot;sections&quot; of a castle ie; Kaku, ichi no maru, ni \nno \n&gt; maru , san no maru...Perhaps they mean &quot;Jinjo&quot; another simple \n&gt; fortification but with moats and stockades?\n&gt; -t\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
