I used him only as an example.Takeda Shingen as another example, turned against his own father to take control of the Takeda clan, had he failed in this he would be thought of in the same way. As it turned out his gamble worked and today he is regarded in a much different way.You said &quot;if you&#39;re a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what little time you have off, what room is there for the &quot;honor&quot;&quot;. My response to this that there is lots of room left for &quot;honor&quot;. Honor is more than just acts of loyalty or bravery, it is also the manner in which you conduct yourself. Where I come from deals are made with a handshake, and if I give my word, I keep my word. And when I am long gone nobody can say they got screwed by me. Is there not honor in this? Certainly all samurai didn&#39;t call out challenges, this practice was dependent upon the status of the man as well as the time period you are talking about. I am guilty of generalizations and for this I am sorry.\n\nbest regards\nDave Jackson\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Kyle Segall \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, March 24, 2004 4:35 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai\n\n\n  Try a little more than Shogun. Akechi Mitsuhide wouldn&#39;t have been \n  thought so poor had he actually succeeded in becoming Shogun (his \n  alliances not fallen apart, the mori finding out about nobunaga&#39;s \n  death before hideyoshi). Don&#39;t kid yourself into think he really did \n  anything special. Just dumb.\n  The daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai \n  really believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to see \n  that. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the \n  peacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.\n  You claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its true \n  that confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far \n  from a system of honor, especially what you&#39;re thinking about. Think \n  about it; if you&#39;re a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what \n  little time you have off, what room is there for the &quot;honor&quot; that \n  you think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do \n  anything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure preaches \n  about may be true... but that wasn&#39;t really out of a sense of honor.\n\n  I don&#39;t recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the noble \n  ones. I doubt an ashigaru wielding a spear was shouting, &quot;I am so-\n  and-so, from so-and-so village! Come get some!&quot;\n\n  And sorry about the snappy remarks... I&#39;m just SICK of all these \n  kids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for every \n  age, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his actions. \n  Only famous for who he killed and how dumb he was in doing it.\n\n\n  \n\n\n"
