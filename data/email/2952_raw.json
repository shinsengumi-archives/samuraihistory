So for a farmers \nson to become a sumo-tori and wear the chon-mage let everyone know he \nwas much more than just a big country boy.\n\tCamelia oil and various kinds of &quot;mousse&quot; were employed to achieve the \nvarious styles. For a mans top-knot, the hair was wrapped in paper or \ntied with one or two strings. There is a trick to it though, it takes a \nskilled hand, that is why you don&#39;t see sumo-tori doing their own hair. \nThere was an article in the Japan Times  a couple a years back about a \ngai who wanted to wear montsuki and chon-mage to a friends wedding. \nOnce it was set he wore it for weeks all over Japan and I guess \nparlayed it into lots of free drinks...\n-t\n\n\n"
