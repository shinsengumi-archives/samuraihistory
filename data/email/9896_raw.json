The reason of cause of that war was a=\r\nttributed to the difference of thought of between Saigo and the leaders of =\r\nMeiji Government.\nOne was that Saigo proposed to send himself to Korea to n=\r\negotiate with the government of Korea at that time to open her in order her=\r\n to contact with  foreign countries instead closing , but Meiji government =\r\nrefuged his proposal.  Second was that Saigo hoped to revolute Meiji govern=\r\nment another time and creat new government formed by just regular civilians=\r\n like France&#39;s revolution  instead by ex-buke , Bushi in Meiji Government.\n=\r\n\n  How was Robert Lee ?  Did he die because of war against government of U.=\r\nS.  at that time ?  or what?     How did he die ?\n\n   Saigo was not  the ty=\r\npe of just  guy of military, but rather  a polititian.\n\n  Eddie  Hiramoto\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, burker1@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Joe,\n&gt;   =\r\n   \n&gt;      I&#39;m glad to see that someone else besides me has noticed the \n&gt; =\r\nsimilarities.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Taking it one step further,   Saigo was commander o=\r\nf Imperial \n&gt; Japaneses armed forces at one time; Lincoln offered the comma=\r\nnd of the Union armed \n&gt; forces to Lee (who turned it down).\n&gt; \n&gt;      I do=\r\nn&#39;t think Lee really wanted to rebel against the US, he just \n&gt; couldn&#39;t dr=\r\naw his sword against his native Virginia.   Similarly, I never got the \n&gt; i=\r\nmpression that Saigo wanted to rebel against the Imperial Government that \n=\r\n&gt; he had helped install, but his sense of honor would not let him abandon h=\r\nis \n&gt; followers.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Lastly, Satsuma is one of the most &quot;southern&quot; pr=\r\novinces in Japan!\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 4/18/09 1:59:53=\r\n PM, joemaps@... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, exactly. I&#39;ve t=\r\nhought of that parallel too. In particular, there\n&gt; &gt; is a similar type of =\r\n&quot;lost cause&quot; romanticism about the Confederate Army\n&gt; &gt; and Saigo&#39;s army. B=\r\noth Saigo and Lee revolted against the central\n&gt; &gt; government, but both are=\r\n now revered in prominent statues. Both of them\n&gt; &gt; are thought of as havin=\r\ng high moral character, worthy of emulation. And\n&gt; &gt; both rebellions figure=\r\n prominently in films and TV shows. The Boshin\n&gt; &gt; War is like the War of I=\r\nndependence, and the Satsuma Rebellion is like\n&gt; &gt; the Civil War. Saigo pla=\r\nyed both Washington and Lee, who were both from\n&gt; &gt; Virginia.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Joe\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@samuraihistosam, burker1@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I&#39;ve always seen parallels between the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877 and\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe US\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Civil War, with Saigo Takamori playing the role of the Japanese=\r\n Robert\n&gt; &gt; E.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lee.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both wars resulted in each country ha=\r\nving a strong central government.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In a me=\r\nssage dated 4/17/09 9:55:04 PM, joemaps@ writes:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am often struck by a number of parallels betwee=\r\nn US and Japanese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; history. For example, the role of the Meiji Resto=\r\nration leaders\n&gt; &gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analogous to the founding fathers of the U=\r\nS. Toshimichi Okubo\n&gt; &gt; strikes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me as a Thomas Jefferson type of ch=\r\naracter. Saigo Takamori reminds\n&gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of George Washington.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The analogies are not, of course, perfect. But they are strong\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be interesting. This evening I was comparing the Battle=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sekigahara (East vs West) with the Battle of Gettysburg (North =\r\nvs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; South). These are the two key large domestic battles in both\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n countries&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; histories. I was surprised to learn how close the troop=\r\n numbers\n&gt; &gt; were.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At Gettysburg, it was 93K (north) vs 71K (south)=\r\n. At Sekigahara, it\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 88K (east) vs 81K (west). How coinciden=\r\ntal that such analogous\n&gt; &gt; battles\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had troop numbers that were so =\r\ncomparable!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=\r\n*********** *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Access 350+ FREE radio stations anytime from anywhere o=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; web.
