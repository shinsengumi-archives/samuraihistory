I was wondering if anyone here&#39;s watching the weekly \nHistori=\r\ncal \n&gt; dramas of NHK.  I&#39;ve been watching them since my college days \nstart=\r\ning \n&gt; with th &quot;Aoi&quot; series.  Just a question, how accurate are they?  I&#39;ve=\r\n \n&gt; been mostly intrigued with the &quot;Toshiie to Matsu&quot; series back in \n2002,=\r\n \n&gt; and I&#39;m wondering if Hideyoshi and Toshiie were really that \nconnected =\r\n\n&gt; as protrayed in the series.  (Obviously I&#39;m a fan of the Sengoku \nJidai)=\r\n\n&gt; Thanks...\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve watched quite a few of them. Most are based on noveliz=\r\ned \nhistorical fiction, so they are a mix of history, known or accepted \nmy=\r\nth, with added modern twists to interest the next generation and \nwomen in =\r\nthem.  Such things as Mori Motonari&#39;s dedication to Mii-no-\nkata and sweari=\r\nng off concubines is pure fiction (from Mori Motonari), \nbut tossed in to m=\r\nake it more date-friendly I suppose.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
