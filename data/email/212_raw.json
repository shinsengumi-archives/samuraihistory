However \nthere were, I believe, four sons born to Yoshitomo and one Daughter, Gien. \nThe sons names were Yoshihira, Yoritomo, Noriyori, and Yoshitsune (Who was \nthe youngest). Yoshihira lived between 1141-1160 (Full name; Kamakura no \nAkugenda.) He was captured and killed after the Heiji disturbance of 1159. \nSorry not to help out more but there are plenty of books to look at in \nresearch, the best being Heike Monogatari (The tale of the \nHeike-H.C.McCullough, Stanford uni. press.). good luck on the project!!\nBen Sharples.\n\n"
