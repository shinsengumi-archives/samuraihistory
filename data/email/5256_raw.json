Being as\nit&#39;s Turnbull (and the man needs to get a decent\neditor...criminy...in one photo caption he says that\nNobunaga&#39;s competing heirs were his brothers, when\nthey were his second and third son, as we all know.\nI&#39;ll grant that he corrects himself in the text) I&#39;m\ninclined to go with Sansom, but I&#39;d heard this alleged\nbefore. \n\nAnyone?\n\n\n      \n            \n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
