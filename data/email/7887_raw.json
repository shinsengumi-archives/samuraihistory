Not Ned. \n\n\n&gt; I think that the main point of contention that I\n&gt; would have is that history\n&gt; books all have the intended purpose of being correct\n&gt; whereas fiction&#39;s\n&gt; purpose isn&#39;t to be correct, it is to entertain. \n\nThe point of all this is to slam the door on a return\nof those who use &quot;but I saw it on Ruroni Kenshin/in a\nKurosawa movie/my sensei told me&quot; as a legitimate\nargument. It is not. While we can debate every\nhistorical reference individually, as a whole, the\npoint of history works is fact, the point of fiction\nis not. Yes, history writers have agendas. Yes,\nhistory writers may get facts wrong. Yes, they may\neven distort them. However, that&#39;s still no comparison\nto a work created with a willing suspension of fact\nfor the purposes of entertainment. There is NOTHING\nwrong with entertainment. There is something wrong\nwhen people take entertainment and try to use it to\njustify fact. That&#39;s the issue here. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
