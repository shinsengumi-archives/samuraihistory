The exhibition, the first of its kind in Los Angeles for \nover 30 years, features the work of twelve award winning swordsmiths, four \nof whom have been awarded the rank of mukansa by the Agency of Cultural \nAffairs of Japan. The exhibition highlights the idea that Japanese swords \nare not merely weapons, but also spiritual objects of great artistic value. \nThe swords will be exhibited in same manner that they are displayed in \nJapanese museums and shrines, far removed from their practical use, \nillustrating the different styles of workmanship and expression of the \nindividual artist. The swords will be borrowed from collections on the West \ncoast of the United States, from collectors in Japan and from many of the \nswordsmiths themselves.\n\nThe Japanese sword is the most efficient, intrinsically beautiful, \nmeticulously handcrafted blade in the world. They are produced by methods of \nmanufacture that have remained relatively unchanged for a thousand years. \nOnce forged, they undergo a rigorous polishing procedure that involves as \nmany as 20 different grades of stones and copious amounts of water. This \npolishing process enhances the wood grain like quality of the steel and the \nhamon: a complex crystalline structure, created by the quenching process, \nthat traverses the blade�s edge. The hamon provides the blade with a tough \nresilient edge that remains sharp even with heavy use.\n\nThe sword has always been highly revered within Japanese society. It is one \nof the three objects of the Japanese imperial regalia, along with the mirror \nand the jewel. According to Japanese mythology, a sacred sword found in the \ntail of a dragon was brought down from heaven with the ancient gods to begin \nthe imperial line of Japan. Swords are often dedicated to shrines and \ntemples as gifts for the residing kami (gods) or as vessels for them to \nreside in. The changes in shape and manufacture of Japanese blades reflect \nthe periods in which they were produced, and in many cases, it was the sword \nthat wrote Japanese history. Later, during the peaceful Edo period \n(1603-1868), the sword was viewed as an instrument of direction for the \nwarrior seeking enlightenment, guiding the samurai on ethics of conduct and \nself-improvement.\n\nWith the restoration of power from the Shogun (military commander) to the \nEmperor Meiji in the latter part of the 19th century, the samurai became a \nrelic of Japan�s ancient past. The Japanese people craved modernisation and \nindustrialisation equal to that of the western powers. This caused a decline \nin the call for swords and the art of swordmaking was almost lost. In 1933, \nKurihara Hikosaburo, a keen sword enthusiast and a member of the National \ndiet, in an effort to save the craft, began a project to recruit and train \nswordsmiths from all over Japan. The first member to sign up for this \nproject was Yoshihara Katsukichi, a toolmaker. Katsukichi would later to use \nthe art name Yoshihara Kuniie and become one of the most famous swordsmiths \nof the Showa period (1926-1989). Swordmaking was once again threatened by \nthe allied occupation of Japan following WWII. All swordmaking and related \nactivities were banned during this time. Kurihara again spearheaded a \nrevival of the craft, but this time many of the smiths did not to return to \nswordmaking, including Kuniie�s brother and son. Kuniie however, became one \nof the pioneers of the post-war rebirth of Japanese swordmaking, leaving us \nseveral prominent smiths as his legacy.\n\nKuniie�s descendants continue to this day to produce Japanese swords in the \ntraditional manner. The exhibition displays examples of several generations \nof his family and their former apprentices. The current head of the \nYoshihara school Kuniie�s grandson Yoshihara Yoshindo, (recently appointed \nan Intangible Cultural Property of Tokyo) will be coming from Japan to open \nthe exhibition and give a talk on the opening day. Yoshindo�s younger \nbrother Shoji (Kuniie III), is the current deputy chairman of The All Japan \nSwordsmiths Association and in 2004 had a cameo role in the Warner Brothers \nmovie The Last Samurai. Yoshihara Yoshikazu is Yoshindo�s son and the fourth \ngeneration of Yoshihara smiths. In 2003 he became the youngest smith ever to \nbe elevated to the rank of mukansa (above competition level).\n\nThe guest curator for the exhibition is Paul Martin, a former member of the \nJapanese department of the British Museum in London - where he studied and \ncared for the arms and armour collections. The former All England Karate \nChampion currently lives in Japan where practices kendo and is furthering \nhis study of Japanese swords at national museums, shrines and at the \nworkshops of many of Japan�s top swordsmiths and sword polishers.\n\n\n\n"
