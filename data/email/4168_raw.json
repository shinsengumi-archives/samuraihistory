Tokugawa did the\n&gt; &gt; unifying of Japan because his incursions had peace\n&gt; &gt; as a goal, unlike the\n&gt; &gt; christian Nobunaga, that only spread terrorism and\n&gt; &gt; genocide.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Nobunaga--NOT CHRISTIAN.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. TAKEDA SHINGEN&#39;S GOAL: POWER AND CONTROL.\n&gt; TOKUGAWA IEYASU&#39;S GOAL: POWER AND CONTROL.\n&gt; ODA NOBUNAGA&#39;S GOAL: POWER AND CONTROL.\n&gt;\n&gt; Takeda Shingen killed his own father. Sure, a lot of\n&gt; people admire him, but you&#39;re mistaken if you think\n&gt; he&#39;s perfect.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tokugawa&#39;s goal wasn&#39;t peace--it was control. If it\n&gt; was simply peace, why didn&#39;t he let Hideyori take\n&gt; control? What was the need for a Sekigahara or Osaka\n&gt; Campaign?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Btw, that statements (babbling in japanese) about\n&gt; &gt; Musashi being not fammous\n&gt; &gt; to real japan dwellers is ridiculous.\n&gt;\n&gt; No one said he wasn&#39;t famous in Japan--just that it&#39;s\n&gt; sad that he&#39;s the one samurai that most Westerners\n&gt; know. Sure, he&#39;s famous--why else do a Taiga Drama\n&gt; based on him? However, he&#39;s overrated.\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
