The fifth \nTokugawa Shogun. I am especially concerned with the protection of dogs that \nhis mother inspired, as well as the Urban culture during, and preceeding, \nthe Genroku Era (as well as any other information on this area, of which i \nam particularly ignorant). Lastly, i would like to look into the Shohei \nacademy, of which Tsunayoshi was apparently the patron. Although, again, i \nhave no idea how long he remained appointed to this position.\n    Secondly, and less specific;- Can anyone inform me as to whether ancient \nAssyria would have contained modern Baghdad.\n\n  Any, and all help would be accepted with my full thanks\nMiles R Dewey\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nBe the first to hear what&#39;s new at MSN - sign up to our free newsletters! \nhttp://www.msn.co.uk/newsletters\n\n\n\n\n"
