Mayhaps I am misunderstand \nwhat was meant by rejecting the purchase.  Would I be logical then to assume \nthat Denmark took the ship, re-christened her, and then said, &quot;Nope, not up \nto our quality, take her back&quot; as a means of adding legitimacy to the trick?\n  When I get home from work I will send you the article that I have.  It is \na rather interesting first hand account.  I also have a dozen or so pictures \nand etchings on my computer of the ship.  It is a particular favorite of \nmine since it ties in two of my most favorite parts of history, the US War \nBetween the States and Tokugawa/Bakumatsu Japan.\n  Thank you again for the wonderful information.  I shall have to get my \nhands on a copy of the books you mentioned.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIs your PC infected?
