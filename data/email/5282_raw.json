There\nare martial artists on this site with considerable\nknolwledge.\n\nso please dont argue and attempt to correct some\nmembers when they answer and try to help.\n\nI for one joined the Bujinkan in 1985 during the ninja\nboom, I was like you wanted ot be a ninja. I gre up\ndid my research and know what i do now by  listening\nto others. I have been in the bujinkan longer than you\nhave been alive.\n\nso just listen when we try to help you or no one will\ntake any notice of you in the future\n\npaul\n\nPS Ninja did not run around in black suits kiling\npeople\n\n\n\n--- Edward Alexander &lt;edyhiphop@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nShinobi were also counterspies.And I doubt they were\nlike ninjas(I mean killing people).OK,this time I give\nup.Might be the blue costumes(for God&#39;s sake,I&#39;m only\n13!!!).\nWhat do you mean by &quot;they didn&#39;t wear any\nuniform&quot;??????What were they wearing if not\nuniform???/\n \nEdy\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Edward Alexander &lt;edyhiphop@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; What&#39;s with the riiiiiight?????Ok or not????Sorry\n&gt; for asking.I think it&#39;s OK\n&gt;  \n&gt; Edy\n\nWhile on the rare occaisions that spies needed to act\non night missions they did wear BLUE (as has been said\nmultiple times here, not the black that you\nmentioned), for the most part, they didn&#39;t wear any\n&quot;uniform&quot; at all. I think Tony&#39;s comment was about\nyour statement that shinobi lurked in the shadows,\nfinding enemy shinobi and pointing them out to guards.\nThat&#39;s just simply not true. As Tony said, for the\nmost part the black outfits are a convention of\nfictional theater. \n\n\n            \n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
