It purports to be a letter \n&quot;home&quot; by an Italian adventurer in the suite of Fr. Organtino, who gets involved \nwith Nobunaga (&#39;the signore&#39;) who is never actually named. It was an award-\nwinnning novel in Japan, and predated Shogun by several years as a &quot;European \nin Japan&quot; story. \n\nIf you want some good samurai fiction, why not read some originals, like &quot;The \nTale of the Heike&quot;? There are a few good translations out there.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
