If I\n&gt; remember correctly \n&gt; George Patton redesigned it in the early 20th\n&gt; century so that it was a \n&gt; better weapon!\n\nHe did. God, I love Georgie!\n\nBeing in England it&#39;s\n&gt; considered \n&gt; prestigious, while for a long time in the US it was\n&gt; the province of \n&gt; runaways, neer-do-wells and criminals.\n\nAs was the ARMY in general...same for England. Other\nthan your officer ranks, generally ALL soldiers in the\nEnglish Army, whether infantry or cavalry or whatever,\nwere from the &quot;bottom&quot; of society. It&#39;s just that the\nones who could ride became cavalry. As a &quot;current&quot;\ncavalry officer, I STILL think it&#39;s the PREMIER place\nto be. \n\n(My\n&gt; grandfather and granduncle \n&gt; were in the US horse cavalry prior to WW1)\n\nAs the saying goes...if you ain&#39;t CAV...you ain&#39;t\nsh#t!\n\n Was there\n&gt; ever this split \n&gt; between foot and horse in the various Japanese\n&gt; periods? Or was it just a \n&gt; matter of money and usage when you used a horse?\n\nJust like in Europe, I would assume, in the feudal\nperiod, if you had money, you rode. If you were poor,\nyou couldn&#39;t afford a horse, so you didn&#39;t. If you\nlook at the breakdown of what samurai were expected to\nprovide based on stipend, the more money, the more\nhorses they were supposed to provide. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
