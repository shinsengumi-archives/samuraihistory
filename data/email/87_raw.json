One series worth \nmentioning is the &quot;Rekishi Gunzo&quot; series, which is a series of \nJapanese history books. Each book covers a particular person, or \nbattle, with full color maps, pictures, and especially Genealogies.  \nI found a treasure trove of Mori genealogy in the &#39;Mori Motonari&#39; \nRekishi Gunzo book - It had information on not only the Mori \ngenealogy but on the Amako and Ouchi as well.  We actually have some \ngenealogies which we have translated on the Samurai Archives page: \n\nhttp://samurai.bigsitecity.com/clanindex.html\n\nMost of these only cover the &#39;sengoku&#39; timeframe, and the &quot;offline&quot; \nversions go farther back, and some are far more complete than others.\nI have some in depth genealogy from (if I remember correctly) the \n10th - 12th century on a few clans that a friend was able to get for \nme, I believe they covered the Minamoto and Taira, but I don&#39;t have \nthem with me right now, (I&#39;m at work).  I&#39;d have to scan them into my \ncomputer to make them available.\n\nCEWest\n\n\n"
