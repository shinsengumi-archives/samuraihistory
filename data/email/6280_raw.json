Let&#39;s take a different\n&gt; approach. You pick up \n&gt; *something* that you are trained to handle. The\n&gt; weight, balance and feel are \n&gt; perfect for *you*, not in any way you can express.\n&gt; Something subliminal. \n&gt; Then that object *speaks* to you. I know I felt that\n&gt; way the first time I \n&gt; picked up a Glock 19 (and proceeded to put an\n&gt; extended clip in a silver \n&gt; dollar sized circle at 30 yards. Some of my best\n&gt; shooting ever). Sure a \n&gt; standard issue M1911A1 will do the job, but it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t feel the same. For \n&gt; the same reason I haven&#39;t bought a takeyumi at\n&gt; Asahi. Nothing there *spoke* \n&gt; to me. As a craftsman, lots of things *speak* to me\n&gt; on some level. I expect \n&gt; it&#39;s projection, like people ascribing human\n&gt; emotions to thier pets.\n\nI understand *THIS* perfectly. I&#39;ve got no problem\nwith *THIS*. You appreciate the weapon as a fine piece\nof machinery, or as a superb instrument for putting\nlead on target--agree completely. The M1 Main battle\ntank is a BEAUTIFUL thing, and there&#39;s nothing quite\nlike the feel of launching 120mm downrange and nailing\na moving target centermass from 3 km away. \n\nThe difference is that when you say something *speaks*\nto you, you are using asterisks around the word. I\nunderstand you don&#39;t literally mean it has a mouth and\nwords come out. I don&#39;t really thing Gereg means that,\nquite, but with some people I wonder. And I find it\nhighly troubling. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo! Mail - now with 250MB free storage. Learn more.\nhttp://info.mail.yahoo.com/mail_250\n\n"
