She is samurai after all, and this is the\nbarbarian who just killed her husband.\n\nAlt.alternative is that the kids stab him to death in his sleep.\n\nRoll credits.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
