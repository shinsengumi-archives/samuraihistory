Most of what exists in En=\r\nglish forms part of studies on \nAkira Kurosawa, and for a very long time th=\r\ne only real publication \ndevoted to the genre remained Alain Silver&#39;s The S=\r\namurai Film, which \nfirst appeared back in 1977. The situation is about to =\r\nchange \nthough, and not a moment too soon, what with the renewed interest i=\r\nn \nthe genre through the efforts of Quentin Tarantino and Tom Cruise. \nThe =\r\nsecond half of 2005 not only sees the return of Silver&#39;s tome in \nan update=\r\nd and expanded third edition, but also the publication of a \nbrand new volu=\r\nme, Patrick Galloway&#39;s Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The \nSamurai Film Handbook=\r\n.\n\nYou could easily construe the lack of coverage of the genre as a \ntestam=\r\nent to the thorough work Silver put into his tome. The Samurai \nFilm has al=\r\nways been one of the standard publications on Japanese \ncinema in English, =\r\ncovering the genre with great erudition and \nperceptiveness. With so many o=\r\nf the standard works on Japanese film \ndisappearing from the shelves due to=\r\n a publishing industry \nincreasingly obsessed with bestseller rankings and =\r\nOprah&#39;s reading \nlist, Overlook Press deserves a big round of applause for =\r\n\nresurrecting Silver&#39;s study for a new generation. Granted, they \nprobably =\r\nwouldn&#39;t have taken the chance if Kill Bill and The Last \nSamurai had flopp=\r\ned. The author obliges by adding an entirely new \nchapter in which both fil=\r\nms feature prominently, but, characteristic \nof the book&#39;s approach as a wh=\r\nole, he places these foreign tributes \ninto the proper context of the chanb=\r\nara genre&#39;s evolution over the \npast twenty-odd years.\n\nThe Samurai Film is=\r\n still every bit as thorough as it ever was. \nSilver takes the time to defi=\r\nne everything from narrative and \ncharacter types, via the use and function=\r\n of violence, to the roots \nof the celluloid samurai in fact, art and ficti=\r\non - all before the \nfirst film is even mentioned. Key directors (Kurosawa,=\r\n Gosha, \nOkamoto, Shinoda), series (including perennial fan favourites \nZat=\r\noichi - expanded to include the Kitano version - and The Sleepy \nEyes of De=\r\nath), characters (like Musashi Miyamoto) and individual \nfilms are scrutini=\r\nsed and discussed in great depth. The chapter on \nHideo Gosha (he and Kuros=\r\nawa the only directors to have an entire \nchapter dedicated to them) still =\r\nstands as the single most important \nand authoritative piece of writing on =\r\nthis great director (but what \na shame that almost no one has followed suit=\r\n and actually released a \nfew of his films...).\n\nThe author&#39;s approach regu=\r\nlarly results in close textual analysis, \nbut he always works from the larg=\r\ner framework of demonstrating, by \nway of his various test cases, how the g=\r\nenre functions and to what \nends. The results never cross the line into bec=\r\noming ham-fisted or \nbogged down in jargon. A great example are the few par=\r\nagraphs \ndevoted to Throne of Blood, in which Silver very succinctly tells =\r\nus \nexactly why Kurosawa is a great filmmaker - without ever resorting \nto =\r\nhackneyed talk of humanism and rousing epics.\n\nSilver&#39;s point of departure =\r\nfor his analyses is always the film \nitself. He never attempts to hammer hi=\r\ns subjects into any kind of \ntheoretical mould, which is exactly why The Sa=\r\nmurai Film is still \nevery bit as pertinent as it was thirty years ago. Had=\r\n the author \nplaced his labours within any of the critical frameworks popul=\r\nar at \nthe time of its original publication, the text would by now have \nfe=\r\nlt badly dated and the book would have become a relic. Instead, it \nachieve=\r\ns what all great film analysis does: it helps you understand \nthe genre and=\r\n the films better, and thereby enjoy them all the more \nas a result. With t=\r\nhe updated text it&#39;s destined to hold up for \nprobably quite a few decades =\r\nto come. Like many of the movies it \ndiscusses, The Samurai Film is a bona =\r\nfide classic. Mandatory \nreading for anyone interested in Japanese film.\n\n\n=\r\nhttp://www.midnighteye.com/books/samurai-film_stray-dogs-lone-\nwolves.shtml=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"
