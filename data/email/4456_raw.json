Please review the daimyos of Hizen province, including Arima and Omura clans in the 16th Centure. It was the daimyo Omura who granted the Portugese Nagasaki port. And the ties with the Portugese in Nagasaki and Omura. There&#39;s even a St. Omura in the Catholic faith who is a canonized Saint.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
