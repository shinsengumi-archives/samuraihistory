Most \nespecially, people did not sleep in them. And even more especially, \nthere is little evidence that they were taken to battles. The Japanese \nhad panelized wooden houses and other buildings which were at times \nmoved from one place to another.\n\nAs for carports. I understand the allure of using carports. However, \nyou should probably come up with simple box beam type posts to enclose \nthe aluminium poles. Covering them with wood grain contact paper does \nlittle to disguise their essential wrongness.j Another problem with \ncarport construction is that the vertical supports may not really be in \nthe right places to replicate what we know of akunoya from iconographic \nevidence.\n\nIf you are more industrious, why not buy lumber and make the frame \nyourself?\n\n\n\n\n"
