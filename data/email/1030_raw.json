Wow  those are really nice. They would look great on my self here at home, among my smaller pices. I too would like to buy some if possible. I will pay what they cost and the shipping upfront(via money order), and pay you something for your time and effort. If this can be done please contact me. I would probley buy 10 of them at a time, (don&#39;t care if I get doubles) That way it would be cheaper on the shipping and your time. Can we do this?? Thank you\nNagamori\n sinseism wrote:Hello JJ\n\nThose little kabuto are higly detailed.The quality is beyond that of \nprize because they are made by Kaiyodo,known as one of the Japanese \ngreatest model makers. \nOne problem is that we can&#39;t tell which kabuto is included until we \nopen the box.So It is a little hard to get a whole series even for \nme.I have already doubled some kabuto.It costs $2.5 or so each,but I \nwill have to spend much more money to complete.\n\nIf you really want them,I might be some help.Contact me.\n\nBut I can&#39;t eat the candies up.LOL\n\nRegards\n\nShinsei\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;JJ&quot; &lt;DarkJJ@w...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Konnichiwa,\n&gt; \n&gt;     I know this may be an outlandish request, but I was wondering \nif anyone who has access to buying those mini kabuto would be willing \nto buy the whole series for me, and I would pay them back in full. I \ndo not live in Japan, unfortunately, and I have fallen in love with \nthose kabuto. If anyone would be willing to help me out, I would \nappreciate it very much and be forever in your debt.
