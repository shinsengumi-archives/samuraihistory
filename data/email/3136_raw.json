The amount of training they go through is amazing, one \nwho&#39;s book I read started training at age 5 or 6! Now they have to \nfinish junior high before they can start training full time. If your \nrunning a very late Sengoku period scenario you could have onna Kabuki, \nclosest you will get to a geisha!\n\n&gt;cepo\n&gt;(4) Finally, I believe is a good idea to point out how today&#39;s geisha \n&gt;(and maiko) are NOT prostitutes, but high-class entertainers. While \n&gt;sexual services were a part of their work in the past, they had always \n&gt;been different from ordinary prostitutes, for the simple reason that \n&gt;geisha are trained in the traditional arts - prostitutes are not. \n&gt;Today&#39;s geisha are professional musicians and dancers, and testimonial \n&gt;of a disappearing past. I know a few of them personally, and I can \n&gt;guarantee they&#39;re fantastic women, whose lives are dedicated to art - \n&gt;not to selling their bodies.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat&#39;s awesome! I&#39;ve only possibly saw one in the old section of Kyoto \nin traditional dress.\n\nJim\n\n\n"
