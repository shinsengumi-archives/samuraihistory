Two rivers=\r\n, now known \nas the Kamogawa and the Katsuragawa, flowed down from the moun=\r\ntains, \nbisecting the basin before joining the Yodogawa (Yodo River), which=\r\n \nemptied into Osaka Bay.\n\nWith the rivers providing easy access to the mer=\r\nchants and markets \nof Osaka, The Hatas gradually amassed great wealth thro=\r\nugh commerce \nin silk goods. Their success attracted the powerful Kamo, Izu=\r\nmo and \nOno families who built imposing residences in the northern district=\r\ns \nof the basin.\n\nThe population of the basin and the wealth of the familie=\r\ns living \nthere continued to grow. In the late 700s the reigning emperor an=\r\nd \nhis ministers decided to move the Imperial capital from nearby Nara \nto =\r\nthe Kyoto basin. They chose to pattern the layout of the new \ncapital after=\r\n the Tang dynasty Chinese capital of Chang&#39;an (modern \nXi&#39;an or Sian), whic=\r\nh at that time was one of the largest and \ngrandest cities in the world. \n\n=\r\nThe new capital, christened Heiankyo (literally, Peace Capital), was \nlaid =\r\nout in the shape of a rectangle, measuring 4.5 kilometers (2.8 \nmiles) from=\r\n east to west, and 5.2 kilometers (3.2 miles) from north \nto south. The emp=\r\neror and his entourage moved to the new city in \n794, beginning a golden ag=\r\ne in Japan that later came to be known as \nthe Heian Jidai (Hay-ee-on Jee-d=\r\nie) or the Age of Peace.\n\nLeaders of the powerful Fujiwara and Taira clans,=\r\n which vied for \ncontrol of the Imperial Court by providing Imperial consor=\r\nts and \nministers, built their residences in the Shirakawa and Rokuhara \ndi=\r\nstricts of central Kyoto. \n\nOther palatial residences and landscaped garden=\r\ns proliferated. The \narts and crafts achieved new heights of sophistication=\r\n. For the next \nfour centuries, Kyoto flourished as one of the brightest st=\r\nars in \nthe civilized world. \n\nIn 1185 clan leader Yoritomo Minamoto defeat=\r\ned his rivals in battle, \nhad himself named Shogun by the emperor, took com=\r\nplete control of \nthe country, and moved the administrative functions of th=\r\ne \ngovernment from Kyoto to Kamakura, a tiny seaside village 45 km (28 \nmi.=\r\n) southwest of present-day Tokyo. Although no longer the seat of \nadministr=\r\native power, Kyoto continued to play a major role in the \ncultural life of =\r\nthe country.\n\nWhen the Kamakura government was replaced by the Muromachi Sh=\r\nogunate \nin 1333, the administration of the country was returned to Kyoto. =\r\n\nOne of the first things the new government did was to break the hold \nthat=\r\n Buddhist organizations in Nara had on the building of new \ntemples, and sp=\r\nonsor the building of dozens of temples, many of them \nhuge complexes, with=\r\nin the new city and on the surrounding \nmountains. \n     \nThe Muromachi per=\r\niod ended in 1568 after a long civil war that \ndevastated much of the splen=\r\ndid capital. In 1590, Hideyoshi \nToyotomi, the winner in this new clan stru=\r\nggle, began a major \nrebuilding program in Kyoto that included the beautifu=\r\nl Fushimi \nCastle and the lavishly decorated Jurakudai Mansion.\n\nIeyasu Tok=\r\nugawa, Toyotomi&#39;s successor, who founded the Tokugawa \nShogunate in Edo (no=\r\nw Tokyo) in 1603, continued to support Kyoto as \nthe Imperial as well as th=\r\ne cultural capital of Japan. To \naccommodate himself on his regular trips t=\r\no the city, Ieyasu \ncommissioned the building of the famous Nijo Castle, wh=\r\nich remains \ntoday as one of Kyoto&#39;s great treasures.\n     \nThe arts, craft=\r\ns and commerce in general flourished in Kyoto during \nthe Tokugawa period, =\r\nbut after the Shogunate fell and the Emperor \nwas restored to power in 1868=\r\n, the new central government moved the \nImperial Court to Tokyo, once again=\r\n leaving Kyoto on the sidelines \nof history.\n     \nBut being shunted aside =\r\nwas to turn out to be a major advantage for \nKyoto as the new government in=\r\n Tokyo led the rest of the country in \na rapid industrial revolution betwee=\r\nn 1870 and 1890. During these \ntwo frenetic and subsequent decades, Kyoto r=\r\nemained very much like \nit had been for generations=97its castles, palaces,=\r\n shrines, temples \nand traditional homes and shops intact.\n\nAt the beginnin=\r\ng of the U.S.-Japan war in 1941, Kyoto&#39;s reputation \nfor its cultural and h=\r\nistorical significance was such that American \nscholars and others who were=\r\n intimately familiar with the city \npersuaded the U.S. government to put it=\r\n off-limits to Allied bombers \nduring the conflict.\n\nStill today, despite i=\r\nts postwar industrialization, Kyoto has 202 of \nthe country&#39;s National Trea=\r\nsures (20 percent of the total) and 1,596 \nof its Important Cultural Assets=\r\n (15 percent of the total). \n\nAmong these treasures from the past: Kyoto Im=\r\nperial Palace, Nijo \nCastle, Katsura Detached Palace, Shugakuin Detached Pa=\r\nlace, Nishi \nHonganji Temple, Higashi Honganji Temple, Kiyomizu Temple, Yas=\r\naka \nShrine, Heian Shrine, and the beautiful Kinkakuji (Temple of the \nGold=\r\nen Pavilion). \n\nIn addition to these historical treasures, Kyoto has three =\r\nof the \ncountry&#39;s largest annual festivals (Gion, Heian and Aoi), along wit=\r\nh \na number of other major annual and monthly events that, combined, \nattra=\r\nct millions of visitors each year.\n\nKyoto is also the birthplace of No, Kyo=\r\ngen and Kabuki, and is the \nnational center for Chado (the Tea Ceremony) an=\r\nd Ikebana (Flower \nArranging), two of Japan&#39;s most important cultural pract=\r\nices.\n\nWhile examples of Japan&#39;s traditional culture can be found in \nabund=\r\nance throughout the islands, Kyoto has retained its role as the \nprimary re=\r\npository of the glories of old Japan, and no one can say \nthey have &quot;done J=\r\napan&quot; without a visit to the ancient capital. \n\nJohn Erskine Banta is Gener=\r\nal Manager and Director of Radisson \nMiyako Hotel Tokyo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
