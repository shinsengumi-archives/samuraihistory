What I&#39;m looking for is a set of Armour from the Edo Period or just before, that I can use during a living history display. It looks good, functions well and will not fall apart, will last for a long time to be passed on. What has cough my eye is the set that Tom Cruise wore during the movie The Last Samurai. Either Black or in Ox blood color. This Armour will be used on horse and in training. It needs to be good quality.\n \nTakara\n\nMichael Peters &lt;shdwstel@...&gt; wrote:\nPaul,\n  Matsushita-san (Kozando-sensei) is a friend of mine. While I would \nclassify his and Marutake-san&#39;s as the easiest choice, we really should find \nout exactly what the person wants.\n\nTakara,\n\n  What exactly do you want? Boy&#39;s day armour? Display sets? Museum quality \nreproductions? Antiques? More specifics can get you better results.\n\n\nMJPeters\n\n&quot;\n&gt;If you want good quality samurai armour thes eare the\n&gt;two places I recommend\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.yoroi.co.jp/english/eindex.html\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.kozando.co.jp/english/index_e.html\n&gt;\n&gt;It will cst you but these are the ones to get it from\n&gt;if you want the closest tot he rwal thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;other than that i suggest the paul chen armour\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Paul&quot;\n\n\n&quot;&gt;Another question I have is where can I purchase a full\n&gt;set of Samurai\n&gt;Armour of good quality ?\n&gt;\n&gt;Takara&quot;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTired of spam?
