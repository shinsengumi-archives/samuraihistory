Anyways the reason why I&#39;m asking these new questions is\nbecause, I need a  primary source for my essay.\n\n1. If a samurai was to lose a battle, and  return alive, would he\ncommit suicide?\nNot necessarily. It would depend on several circumstances.\n\n\n2.  Were there any female samurai? \nYes, though usually they were referred to as Onna Musha. Most women of the  \nsamurai class stayed on the homefront and used their naginata to defend the  \nhome. There were a few who went on the battlefield. You can do some work on  \nGoogle to find out more details.\n\n3.  What would happen if a samurai&#39;s katana was stolen?\nWell, he&#39;d either find another katana or use his wakizashi.\n \n\n4. If  a samurai used seppuku to regain his honor, what would happen to\nhis  family?\nThat depends upon the situation. \n \nI think that you need to visit some sites dedicated to Japanese history to  \nanswer your questions. Try Samurai Archives Wiki. Also check out &quot;Ten  \nMisconceptions About Samurai&quot; (search on Google to find the exact site).\n \nHope this helps.
