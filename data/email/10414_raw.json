I know that isn&#39;t a very satisfying answer, but there are plenty of =\r\nexamples where how someone looks doesn&#39;t correlate with their ancestry. \n\nA=\r\nlso, remember that the people of central asia have a lot of the &quot;east asian=\r\n look&quot; in them.  All I mean by that is a lot of the populations just north =\r\nof Iran have ethnic groups that &quot;look&quot; chinese or korean or japanese.  And =\r\ndepending on where she is from in Iran, there are different ethnic groups.\n=\r\n\nIf you don&#39;t have any actual documentation (names, writing, jewelry, etc..=\r\n.), then your best bet [at some point in the future] would be to do genome =\r\nsequencing, and see how you (or your parent descended from her) compare.  I=\r\nn particular, if this is a maternal grandmother AND you assume that her mot=\r\nher was of Japanese descent, then you could compare the mitochondrial DNA i=\r\nn her child (your mom or dad) to that of a japanese population (or other po=\r\npulations), and see if there are significant matches.  This isn&#39;t my field =\r\nof expertise, and I don&#39;t know how distinct the Japanese population&#39;s mitoc=\r\nhondrial DNA (as a whole) is relative to the rest of eastern asia, but this=\r\n could be a future avenue of exploration.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t trust the companies t=\r\nhat perform human genome sequencing just yet, but in the not too distant fu=\r\nture they should be fairly reliable.\n\nIf you are looking for documentation,=\r\n then you should probably consider the Japanese government.  They had very =\r\ntight population (entering/leaving) controls all the way through WWII.  So,=\r\n she (or her parents) would almost certainly have to have registered their =\r\nintent to leave the country and then receive permission.\n\n-dennis\n\n\n\n--- In=\r\n samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Chad Janzemini &lt;chadjanzemini@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; i have attached a photo of her, tell me what you think. also if i was t=\r\no tell you her name or maiden name it=C2=A0wouldn&#39;t=C2=A0help=C2=A0because=\r\n=C2=A0i think she might be half or less=C2=A0Japanese, from her mother and =\r\ni=C2=A0don&#39;t=C2=A0know her mothers name.=C2=A0that&#39;s=C2=A0why im researchin=\r\ng=C2=A0Japanese=C2=A0migrations to=C2=A0Iran=C2=A0to narrow the search down=\r\n. my family members have always said she could have it in her and judging f=\r\nrom the photo you could see its a good chance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________________=\r\n____________\n&gt;  From: Oyakata &lt;oyakata@...&gt;\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com \n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 30, 2012 12:11 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihisto=\r\nry] info on japanese settlement in iran\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; I am no=\r\nt aware of any large-scale migration from Japan to Persia / Iran.
