I have seen some that are very \nintricate. \n&gt; \n&gt; Not as far as I know, but they may have acquired meanings during or \npost\n&gt; the Edo era, as so many things have done. But I could be wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Also in some Japanese prints I see mounted samurai wearing a large \n&gt; &gt;ring over their sword. What is it for?\n&gt; \n&gt; This device is the &quot;tsurumaki&quot; or &quot;bow-string wrap&quot;. It&#39;s used for\n&gt; carrying a spare string for the bow. It is made with a deep channel\n&gt; (circa 30mm deep) around the outer edge, so the string can be \nwrapped\n&gt; within the trench and be protected by it. This is done because the \ntsuru\n&gt; is coated in resin which means that you can&#39;t just stuff it away in \na\n&gt; pouch/pocket without it being possibly damaged. The resin which is \nto\n&gt; some degree still fluid, flows away from creases, and you have to \nwipe\n&gt; the crease smooth again before using it. And you really don&#39;t want \nto be\n&gt; doing this in the middle of a battle! Tsurumaki can be made of \nrattan\n&gt; (split vine), wood, or lacquered paper. They are normally suspended \nby a\n&gt; strip of printed leather or other textile, from the obi (when worn \nwith\n&gt; a katana), or from the sword&#39;s waist cord (forgotten the name) in \nthe\n&gt; case of a tachi. Go here to see a couple of modern made rattan \ntsurumaki\n&gt; as used in kyudo for a close up view:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.coara.or.jp/~lucyfer/kyugu/accessories/tsurumaki33-e.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this is useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours\n&gt; \n&gt; Dean\n&gt; ***\n&gt; \n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt; Head Of The Fight School\n&gt; http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
