Were\nthey essentially interchangable? Why has samurai become the most\ncommonly used term these days, when most of the history books I have use\nthe term bushi, and you&#39;d think with all the nonsense out there about\nbushido that bushi would be the one people would be most familiar with?\nDoes samurai simply sound &quot;cooler&quot; and more Japanese?\n\nThanks, \nAngus\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.

I know that after Hideyoshi Toyotomi died in \n1598 his son took command but then quickly lost it to Ieyasu \nTokugawa. I&#39;ve learned that Osaka castle, which was Hideyoshi&#39;s \nheadquarters, was destroyed by Tokugawa. Now my question here is how \nwas it destroyed was it burned to the ground? Oh yeah one more thing \nhow did Hideyoshi die was he murdered or did he die of natural \ncauses?\n\nThanks everybody,\nG3mneye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYahoo!
