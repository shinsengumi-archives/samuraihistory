Sort of a Buddhist version of \na Catholic rosary, but with sacramental leanings. That is, the way you described it as &quot;an \noutward and visible symbol of an inward and spiritual bond&quot; is the same way a knowledgeable \nChristian would describe baptism or communion/eucharist. I&#39;ve studied Buddhism a bit, but \nwasn&#39;t aware that Buddhists believed in a &quot;spiritual bond with Buddha,&quot; at least in any more \nthan a pantheistic sense, (believing they are in a sense bonded with everything). I know that \nalmost all religions have various &quot;sacramental&quot; symbols; I just wasn&#39;t aware of that one. I&#39;d be \ninterested to learn of any other such symbols in Buddhism...\n\nDan\n\n\n"
