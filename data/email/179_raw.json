The obvious answer is \nthat Hideyoshi did not come from the Genji lineage that would have \nallowed him to hold the title...But I also read that Ieyasu&#39;s own \nlineage was never too clear cut in a line from the Minamoto. (a \nsuspect link to a clan called &#39;Nitta&#39; was his claim to power)\n In Berry&#39;s book the idea is presented that Hideyoshi was not \nconcerned with the position of Shogun because that of Kampaku would \npermit him the power but without the trouble of upsetting the \ndelicate balance that he had achieved with the Daimyo. \n If Ieyasu could &#39;alter&#39; his lineage what other reasons can you all \nsuggest for why Hideyoshi decided not to follow the same route?\n Something to think over for a while maybe...\n (Off topic please try to check out the pictures that I&#39;ve drawn of \nSamurai in a series at; www.dickyjjamison.homestead.com/artwork.html\nand please tell me what you think...Shameless plug I know but oh \nwell...)\n\n\n\n"
