For=\r\n over a thousand years \nthe sword was revered as the very soul of the samur=\r\nai warriors who \nwielded it, commanding awe, respect, and an almost religio=\r\nus \ndevotion.\n\nThe tumultuous events of modern Japanese history and the nat=\r\nion&#39;s \nrelentless drive toward technological advancement, however, \nirrevoc=\r\nably sealed the sword&#39;s fate, and, along with the samurai \nclass, the sword=\r\n became an anachronism, both culturally and \nmilitarily.\n\nAs Japan entered =\r\na period of unprecedented Imperial expansion in the \nearly twentieth centur=\r\ny, the Japanese sword, despite its limited \npractical effect, became a feat=\r\nure of the soldier&#39;s arsenal =97 an \necho of the mythical status it enjoyed=\r\n in feudal times. The Yasukuni \nswords emerged during the build-up to World=\r\n War II, in part to help \nmeet the huge demands of the Imperial Army, but m=\r\nore importantly out \nof a desire to preserve time-honored forging methods, =\r\nand to revive \nthe spirit of the samurai. For these reasons, they were nota=\r\nbly \ndistinct from so-called &quot;Showa-to,&quot; which were mass-produced and \ninfe=\r\nrior in quality and artistry.\n\nAll swords were banned in the immediate afte=\r\nrmath of World War II, \nand the decades that followed have seen a decline i=\r\nn the popularity \nof Yasukuni swords, largely because of their associations=\r\n with that \nwar and the military. Another factor has been the stigma attach=\r\ned to \nShowa-to, which has helped to stereotype wartime swords in general.\n=\r\n\nRecent years, however, have seen a renewed interest in the surviving \nYasu=\r\nkuni swords. Many collectors and appraisers have acknowledged \nthe workmans=\r\nhip of these swords as displaying a perfect blend of \ntechnology and tradit=\r\nion, and a quality that can rival even that of \nthe great classical smiths.=\r\n\n\nIn his tribute to the Yasukuni smiths, acclaimed photographer and \nsword =\r\nenthusiast Tom Kishida has compiled an extensive study of \nthese rare and e=\r\nxceptional swords, drawing on a variety of sources \nto shed light on this o=\r\nften little-understood chapter of Japanese \nsword history.\n\nWith his unique=\r\n eye for capturing the beauty of the blades in his \nphotographs, he has pro=\r\nvided the reader with the most lavishly \ndetailed book on Yasukuni swords t=\r\no date. This will be an important \naddition to the libraries of specialists=\r\n and connoisseurs, and to \nthose who wish to deepen their understanding of =\r\nthese fascinating \nwartime weapons.\n\nSeptember 9, 2004\n\nThe Yasukuni Swords=\r\n by Tom Kishida (Translated by Kenji Mishina)\nPublished by Kodansha Interna=\r\ntional\n$45\n4-7700-2754-0\n\nhttp://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=3Dbook&id=3D=\r\n177\n\n\n\n\n"
