As I have heard\nit - and this is the place for experts to correct me - he wrapped a belt\naround his knees to keep himself stationary for his second&#39;s finishing cut.\nFor all his discipline, focus, will and internal preparation, he apparently\nbucked so much after he made his cut that his friend couldn&#39;t correctly hit\nthe neck, and it took several strokes.  An inglorious and messy end for a\ndedicated man.\n\tThis is one of those things that makes me intensely glad to be a gaijin, I\nfear.  I understand that the farmers and other classes took a rather similar\nview of the matter, hence the reversal of the characters spelling &#39;seppuku&#39;\ninto the pronunciation &#39;hara-kiri&#39;.\nIf anyone can confirm or refute all this, I&#39;ll be pleased.  But there&#39;s my\nanecdotal history, for what it&#39;s worth.\n\tGereg\n\n\n\n"
