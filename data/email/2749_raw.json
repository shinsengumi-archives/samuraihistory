My take, as I have said, is that I am against \nviolence and the killing of innocents. Said that, I think we should not \nenter in the merit of being pro or against war in Iraq and so on in \nthis mailing list.\n\nWhat I wanted to say is only that I do believe that there still are \npeople who live their life mainly as warriors. That  was my point, and \nI wanted to make without taking any political position.\n\nRegarding the para-militias and the Waco guys, I do not know them \nenough to judge. I believe they have never been in a real battle, and \nprobably they do not fancy to - otherwise they would sign up for the \nreal army.\nBye!\ncepo\n\nOn Dec 8, 2003, at 12:49 PM, Lee Changsub wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Cesare:\n&gt; Hi, again. If you MEANT sorts of insanity that I saw\n&gt; from either militia groups in Michael Moore&#39;s movie\n&gt; &#39;Bowling For Colubine&#39; or from Davidians in Waco,\n&gt; Texas, you did open a can of worm...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do believe there are a lot of people practicing\n&gt; &gt; bushido today - in\n&gt; &gt; their own way. The Muslim fundamentalist, for\n&gt; &gt; example. I DO NOT MEAN to\n&gt; &gt; open a can of worm here, I am against violence and\n&gt; &gt; the killing of\n&gt; &gt; innocents, but the Mujadeens live a spartan life,\n&gt; &gt; practice martial\n&gt; &gt; arts, believe in religion and are not afraid to die.\n&gt; &gt; Quite a few things\n&gt; &gt; in common with the Samurai.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, this is a completely differet story. For your\n&gt; information, I did support Bush&#39;s war in Iraq\n&gt; personally.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the same time, some of the UN/US soldiers\n&gt; &gt; probably live a very\n&gt; &gt; similar experience.\n&gt; &gt; So, I won&#39;t call bushido out as anachronistic, and\n&gt; &gt; -even when I will\n&gt; &gt; NOT suggest it- I suppose that joining the army is\n&gt; &gt; the best way to\n&gt; &gt; practice the &#39;way of the warrior&#39; today.\n&gt; &gt; cep\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New Yahoo!
