It&#39;s hard to find \nanything here at Fort Knox, KY, even though it is the US home of \nCavalry and Armor...lots about European cavalry, but nothing about \nJapan other than the Takeda &quot;cavalry charge&quot; at Nagashino, which is \nalways written about too simply. As I am sure you all know, it&#39;s hard \nto find anything beyond introductory level stuff in English. Nihongo \nga dekimasu ga, Japanese resources aren&#39;t really available in \nKentucky. Thanks for the help.\n\nNathan Ledbetter\n\n\n\n"
