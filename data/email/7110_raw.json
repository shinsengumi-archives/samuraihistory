Create your own documentary. If you want this documentary to not be\n&gt;taken seriously and you want people to know the correct information, then\n&gt;create a documentary with the correct information. Talking among ourselves\n&gt;about how much of a fraud Hayes is does not solve the problem that this\n&gt;documentary is out there and spreading inferior information.\n\ncreate your own documentary on ninja?, I apologize but it would be..\ncompletely stupid. if anyone knows ANYTHING true on ninjas and understood\nthe philosophy of being one would never make a documentary on them if he\nreally understood anything about it. the way of ninja has nothing similar\nto truth, and to know really what is ninja history and philosophy means\neventually become one and this is incompatible to the.. information\nspreading of documentaries. \n\nand to all kids that wants to be ninjas to be &#39;cool&#39; know that be a ninja\nmeans tell to nobody, act normally, give completely NO clue being a ninja,\nsuicide if you give any slight clue (or kill anyone suspecting), laugh\nheartely at people saying anything on ninja beliving firmly that ninjas\ndoes NOT exist and are simply an invention of hyped childs, officially\nderespect ninjas and anything related, and finally do NOT do anything\nninja-like in public for any reason or purpose, and repeating to yourself\n100 times per day at the mirror &#39;ninja doesn&#39;t exist they are fraud and\nthey aren&#39;t cool, they suck&#39;. if you meet all this you made the first step\nof be a ninja :P\n\nsecond step is talk of ninjas ever again!\n\ntrird step... nothing because of course ninja doesn&#39;t exist :)\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.\nVersion: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.11.8 - Release Date: 10/05/2005\n\n\n"
