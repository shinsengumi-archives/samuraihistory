I would like to know if there is \nanyone who can assist me in researching my family name.I come from a \nlong line of samurai and my ancestors come from the Hiroshima \nPrefecture, and Kamakura, I believe. My father had the opportunity \nto be in Japan while he was in the Army after the Second World War \nand visit our distant relatives. And had the privelige to see the \nfamily tree in Hiroshima Prefecture.  I know that my name can be \ntraced back to about 800 years, and that they were samurai. My last \nname is Kodama.  And from what my pop and grandparents have told me, \nthat it is indeed a very well respected name. Also, that my direct \nancestors were over 5feet 11 to 6 feet tall. Which is very unusual \nfor Japanese men.  ( I am 5&#39;11 and 3/4 &quot; tall.) That&#39;s about all for \nnow, but I look forward to hearing from you folk.\n\nTake care and God Bless\n\nYoshio Kodama, Sergeant, US Army\n\n\n\n\n"
