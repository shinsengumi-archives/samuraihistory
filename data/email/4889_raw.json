You know, there are times, w=\r\nhen\nbeing of the western culture has its definite positive points, I shall\n=\r\ngive my calendar a tad more respect in future:-)\n\nDean\n\n&gt;    That wouldn&#39;t =\r\nsurprise me at all -- It took how many days for the \n&gt;    US as a whole \n&gt; =\r\n   to find out about Lincoln&#39;s assassination? -- but at the heart of \n&gt;    =\r\nthat issue was \n&gt;    a more basic question -- that there was, indeed, a Jok=\r\ny=F4 5 -- for \n&gt;    almost ten \n&gt;    months.\n&gt;\n&gt;    It was the same questio=\r\nn that was driving everyone crazy in Japan \n&gt;    in 1989, when \n&gt;    Sh=F4w=\r\na died (and before, when he was failing and people knew he \n&gt;    would be d=\r\nead \n&gt;    soon). The government nearly ground to a halt as people were \n&gt;  =\r\n  putting off \n&gt;    ordering (and designing!) all new government forms that=\r\n would have \n&gt;    to have a NEW \n&gt;    era name in a checkbox (for birthdate=\r\ns, registrations, etc.), and \n&gt;    had no idea \n&gt;    what the name was goin=\r\ng to be, or when it was actually going to \n&gt;    happen. New \n&gt;    calendars=\r\n needed to be printed, etc. Yeah, it was still Sh=F4wa 65, \n&gt;    but it was=\r\n \n&gt;    about to become something else, too. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;    Tony\n\n\n\n\n"
