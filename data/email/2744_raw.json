But, let me\ntell you one story...\n\nOne of American professors I used to know personally\nstayed for only a few days in Japan when he was in his\nearly thirties. Yet, he met the Japanese prime\nminister for a talk.\nStaying 5 years in Japan and interrogating &#39;a\ngazillion of&#39; young Japanese friends sounds indeed\nscholastic.\nBut I wonder if it would be the same experience for\nyou if you also could visit Japan 5 days and meet a\nJapanese prime minister and other noble families.\n\nMaybe, you have to expand your Japanese network with\nmore emphasis on quality instead on quantity.\n\n\n\n\n                            Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Changsub Lee\n\n\n&gt; Interestingly, I have asked a gazillion of young\n&gt; Japanese friends what \n&gt; was their family doing in the Tokugawa period, and\n&gt; only TWO could \n&gt; answer. My wife comes from\n&gt; a noble family of \n&gt; scholars from Kyoto, but she did not know!! I had to\n&gt; do the research \n&gt; for her!!!! Phew.\n&gt; cepo\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo! Photos - easier uploading and sharing.\nhttp://photos.yahoo.com/\n\n"
