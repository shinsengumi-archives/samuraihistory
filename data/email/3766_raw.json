I haven&#39;t seen the movie yet, but is that a possibility?   The \nonly other film that I can think of with a shaven samurai is the \nSeven Samurai.  But he shaved his head to disguise himeslef as a \nmonk.  Plus, he was ronin which could change his attitude entirely.  \nLong out of service with a lord, he didn&#39;t seem to think like the \naverage samurai.  To him, at that moment it was more important to \nsave the child in danger.\nIs it possible that Saitoh Hajime could have shaved his head in a vow \nor rebellion against some samurai traditions?  Perhaps, refuting one \nof the more &quot;important&quot; samurai trademarks could emphasize his own \nconviction to a greater degree.  A simple statement, &quot;My commitment \nto the Emperor and the Samurai class are more important than the \nsymbol of my rank in society.&quot;  \n\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; &lt;\nthe_sam_99@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; So this was just a blunder by the filmmakers? It&#39;s a huge blunder, \nif\n&gt; ya ask me. Makes no sense, specially when in a scene from the movie\n&gt; they showed the importance that samurai place on their hair style \nwhen\n&gt; Katsumoto&#39;s son&#39;s hair was cut down by the soldiers to disgrace and\n&gt; humiliate him. Yet his father&#39;s head&#39;s completely shaved!\n&gt; \n&gt; Miburo\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter &lt;\nltdomer98@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Saitoh Hajime &lt;the_sam_99@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, I haven&#39;t checked this group in a while so I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know if this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question has been address or not. It&#39;s about the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; movie The Last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai, the lead samurai Katsumoto&#39;s head&#39;s shaven.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I though that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this was a sign of disgrace among samurai, or that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relinquished to a priest&#39;s life...why did he have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his head shaved?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Miburo\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That bothered me too (and I notice these things,\n&gt; &gt; having no hair and all that). It usually was shaved if\n&gt; &gt; the person took religious vows. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
