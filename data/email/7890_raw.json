But a prime example of this is the famous revenge of the 47\nformer Ako retainers. Mainly, they conducted a vendetta without official\npermission. There were provisions in bakufu law where a person who sought to\navenge the death of someone else could seek a permit from the government.\nHowever, these permits would put the enemy on notice that a vendeta was\nbeing sought. The 47 ronin realized that by seeking a permit, they would\nalert Kira, their enemy, who had far superior manpower. They depended upon\nthe element of surprise so they planned and carried out their vendetta\nwithout the lawful permit. \n\nAfter the attack, there was a rather heated debate about what their fate\nshould be. Some argued for executing them as common criminals because of\nconducting a vendetta without government sanction. Others thought that,\nbecause they avenged their lord&#39;s death following cherished Confucian\nprinciples, that they should be exonerated completely. A compromise was\nstruck and they were ordered to die, but could die by seppuku rather than\nbeing executed as common criminals.\n\nNina \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of seikei7248@...\nSent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 3:46 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] The &#39;Image&#39; of the Samurai\n\nIn a message dated 10/20/2005 1:02:34 PM Eastern Daylight Time,\ntom.davidson@... writes:\nThus the occasions when samurai were brought before the court for acting\n&#39;properly&#39; - the instant redress of perceived offence - always put the\nbakafu in a difficult position - they wanted a samurai bound by his code of\nhonour, but they were stuck then when he acted without asking their\npermission first.\nThomas!   Can you are do you have some historic examples of Samrai do these \nacts  with ot seeking permission first.  I would be very interested in\nhearing \nthem.   I am thinking that there would be others new to this; who wold also \nlike to hear.  So looking forward to another great post...  although this\none \nwas interesting;  hmm it raises questions.
