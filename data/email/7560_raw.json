History books can be rife with inaccuracies,\nno matter how many years the author may have studied in Japan or even if the\nauthor is a native Japanese. Believe me, as an American, I&#39;ve read plenty of\nbooks on American history. If simply having the author being an American\nwere automatic proof of accuracy in historical research: I think that most\nof the American people on this list know that there are scores of inaccurate\nbooks written about the U.S. by native-born Americans. So the same with\nJapanese history works or the works about the history of any country or\nculture. \n \nIndividual movies, comics, etc. taken at face value would seem to be tenuous\nsources of history. But sometimes a pattern can emerge from popular works\nthat can indicate some truths, or which at least, we can draw or speculate\non conclusions. So I don&#39;t think that movies, comics, etc. can be entirely\ndiscounted either. \n \nI&#39;m a writer who is engaged in writing historical fiction that takes place\nin Japan. I&#39;m NOT a historian and would never claim to be so. I do depend on\nvarious sources to research the background for my writings. I am unable to\nread Japanese so I&#39;m limited to translated works for my research. I find\nthat I have to consult several sources and then use my logic to decide upon\nthe reasonable accuracy of any of them. And also realize that my own works\nare works of fiction, not definite statements on what actually has happened\nin history. \n \nIn my short story &quot;Stray Dogs, &quot; I certainly cannot claim that this is a\nproven, complete historical rendition of events in Fuwa Kazuemon&#39;s life.\nThat is because we simply don&#39;t know a whole lot about his life. He was a\nronin for the last 5-6 years of his life and there really weren&#39;t a whole\nlot of historical records kept on the lives of ronin; most people of the\ntime considered them to be inconsequential. So in order to produce a\nsatisfactory work of fiction, I have to do my research on what is available\nabout his life. But then, I have to use my logic in researching the general\nliving conditions for ronin of that era, and put in my speculations as to\nhow Fuwa Kazuemon&#39;s life might have occurred within that context. \n \nTo try and sum up, in studying history, one must consult many sources. And\nthen use logic to decide the weight to be put on each source that is\nconsulted.\n \nI don&#39;t know if any of this makes sense or is just ramblings.   \n \nNina Boal \n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Wednesday, August 31, 2005 10:26 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Our &quot;welcoming&quot; attitude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- seikei7248@... wrote:\n \n[snips]\n \nAdditionally, &quot;I read in a comic\nbook&quot;, &quot;my sensei told me so&quot;, and &quot;I saw in a\nmovie/anime/tv show&quot; aren&#39;t considered accurate\nhistorical references, and anyone who uses these as\ndocumentation for supposed facts deserves whatever\nrebuttal with historical sources they get.
