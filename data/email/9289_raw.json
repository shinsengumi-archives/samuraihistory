While the Habu is pr=\r\nobably\nthe most infamous \n\nsnake in Japan there are quite a few poisonous s=\r\nnakes throughout Japan, all\nthe way to Hokkaido.\n\nThis is a link to a web p=\r\nage I found about snakes in Japan and if you scroll\ndown you will find a fa=\r\nmily \n\nof poisonous snakes and a brief description of there geographic\ndist=\r\nribution.\n\n \n\nhttp://homepage3.nifty.com/japrep/snake/ejaphebi.htm\n\n \n\nSorr=\r\ny for my first post to be a bit off topic but I though it might be\nrelevant=\r\n to this current discussion.\n\n \n\nCheers,\n\n \n\nJohn\n\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samu=\r\nraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behal=\r\nf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Tuesday, January 09, 2007 7:24 AM\nTo: samuraihist=\r\nory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: CLASS PAPER.
