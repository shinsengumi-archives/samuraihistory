I teach the competitive  use of\nhistorical reproduction arms and armour, I&#39;ve done archery and used to\nshoot full bore pistol when it was legal over here in the UK. And now\njust for fun I run a tiny group of historical re-enactors recreating\nmomoyama Japan, as well as running an airsoft campaign from an ex-\ngovernment nuclear bunker (now a museum), and my good lady is a science\nfiction author. Life can take you down truely unexpected and strange\npaths when it wants to, would you not agree?:-)\n\nYours\n\nDean\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
