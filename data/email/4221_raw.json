Plus in nearby Phillipines they had seen the Americans\ninvade the islands and then keep it as a colony. Are they the actions of a\nstate that you would trust in their position?? I suppose it is little wonder\nthat no diplomatic solution was ever reached.\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Michael Lorimer [mailto:mijalo_jp@...]\n  Sent: 12 April 2004 12:33\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] WWII... why?\n\n\n  I feel in terms of diplomacy Japan couldn&#39;t back down. It had shown its\nmilitary capability, both naval and on land, during the Russo-Japanese War,\nbut effectively ganged-up upon by the more mature diploatic powers, Japan\nreceived nothing from the War other than, in many poltical and military\ncircles, a revanchist attitude not too dissimilar to the French Right and\nLeft of the Third Republic between 1871-1914. Driven as much by this\nattitude of pride and a stubborn willingness to ignore the obvious, Japan&#39;s\nleadership willingly blundered into the War, succeeding in antagonizing the\nUSA, the UK, and a host of other colonizers and dominions, aswell China. The\nsame lack of forethought that drove them against the NT of Australia (were\nthey going to march to Adelaide down The Track??) was what kept them going.\n  And at this stage of tragic proceedings, would the Allies have negotiated\na settlement if the Japanese had appeared willing. American attitudes were\nakin to those of more recent years; an attack on the American nation, state,\nand way of life. Roosevelt was in little doubt that revenge had to be taken,\nan attitude willingly shared by Churchill. And the Nationalists or\nCommunists in China?\n  Perhaps by comparing this to the samurai spirit is degrading the samurai.\nWhile samurai armies were composed of a corps of trusted retainers and\n&#39;captains&#39;, the majority, whether ashigaru were samurai, were\nagriculturalists.  Wars were generally fought around the agricultural\ncalendar. Their loyalty ran to what was at stake; their property. There were\nfew mass suicides or massive &#39;bloodbath&#39; battles, the daimyo and their\ntroops had more sense; more often than not a daimyo surrendered and in\nreturn was confirmed in his estates, upon condition of loyalty. Perhaps in\nthe Japanese High Command in 1943/44 should have done the same to save\nthemselves, rather than pursuing an impossible dream in the remodelled\nspirit of the samurai.That&#39;s just my opinion anyways.\n  M.Lorimer\n\n\n  Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n  According to Mass (the former Japanese historian at Stanford), the\n  samurai spirit was alive and kicking until the forties. Thus I hope I\n  am not going off-topic here. Ok, once I am done with my excuse, here is\n  my question: the Japanese campaign in East Asia and in the Pacific was\n  clearly a hopeless hyperbole. There was NO WAY the Japanese could\n  control and man such a vast area. After Guadalcanal, then, it was clear\n  that the wind had changed, still there was room for diplomacy, either\n  with the US and perhaps with what was left of China and the Soviets.\n  But the Japanese kept fighting and dying until August 1945.\n  Why?\n  I have my own theories, but before throwing them on the table, I&#39;d love\n  to hear from some of you.\n  Thanks\n  cepo\n  PS= subquestion; is the &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; a good movie? Worth 3 hours of\n  my life and the $3,99 at block buster?\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---\n\n\n\n  ---------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
