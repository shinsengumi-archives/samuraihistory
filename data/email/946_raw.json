It&#39;s a \ncaptivating work of historical fiction that allows Westerners a peek \ninside a foreign world and provides an opportunity to learn about the \nsamurai, a group often portrayed onscreen but seldom understood. What \nI enjoyed most was the story&#39;s (rather overt) parallels to \ncontemporary issues as it recounts America&#39;s first foray into \nSoutheast Asian affairs. Allusions to World War II, America&#39;s \ninvolvement in Vietnam, and the influx of Japanese businesses into \nthe U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s are clearly evident in this draft.\n\nI had worried that these harbingers of things to come might become \noverbearing but they just lent further tragedy and poignancy to the \nstory. The spectator knows what the characters&#39; actions will \nultimately lead to and the horrible toll it will have on both Japan \nand the U.S.\n\nThe Last Samurai is a rousing adventure yarn, an intriguing \ncommentary on a key turning point in the history of Japan and its \nrelationship with the United States, as well as an enlightening \nlesson on Japanese culture and the titular samurai. I simply can&#39;t \nwait to see this film.&quot;\n\nCheck out the entire article at the link at the top of the email.\n\n\n"
