Also a\ncrossbow which has a Tokugawa mon on it.\n\nOne of the armours is the one given to King James 1st\nby one of the Tokugawa shogun, nad another which they\nbelieve was given to the UK Ambasador who was sent to\ncollect this armour. This ambassador was met by\nWilliam Adams.\n\nI took over 300 photos of the collection during the\nseveral visits I made last year and this year. If you\nwant I can email a few of the different armour on\ndisplay. I think they also have a temp display on \narmour making.\n\nThe best part is the Royal Armouries is now free to\nvisit. Check out in advance what they have each day\nfor public displays. They sometimes have someone\nshowing how to put on Japanese.\n\nNottingham castle museum has a collection of armour\nbut this is still boxed up.they have told me they\nindetn on cataloging it later this year and may put up\na temp display of the several sets that they have\n\npaul\n\n\n\n"
