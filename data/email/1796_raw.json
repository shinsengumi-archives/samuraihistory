At the time Shogun first was shown on television, I was \nstudying Japanese language at a Berliotz school. I thought watching \nthe show would help me with my language studies. I quickly learned \nthat I did not recognize any of the Japanese words used on the show. \nSomewhat disappointed, I mentioned it to my instructor, a Japanese \nwoman. She told me the reason I did not know any words was because \nthey actually spoke the Japanese language used during that period. \nThis amazed me. It seems to me that that is going above and beyond \nnormal efforts to make a show authentic. \n\nShortly after this experience on a visit to Japan I actual saw pilots \nhills. This brought me the realization, like nothing else could have \ndone, that the show was based upon real events.\n\nP.S. Shogun is my all time favorite mini series and I checked it out \nof the library to watch tonight, again.\n\n\n\n"
