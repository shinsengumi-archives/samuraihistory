My family has numerous adoptions, and they \nmake no  difference whatsoever in the descent.  The survival of the clan/name  \noutweighs any sense of genetic descent.  Even on lineage charts, those  \nadopted ones appear just as if they were blood .. sometimes there may be a  \nsmall footnote... sometimes not. \n\n\nAn excellent point, and I didn&#39;t mean to suggest that adoptions were  \nsomehow less valid as familial relationships.  My point was only that if  you \nmean to trace your genetic ancestry -- which can sometimes be informative as  \nto medical history, for example -- you might get hung up by that  tradition.  \nObviously adoption was seen as a fully legitimate means by  which to pass \non the family name, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t have been such a common  practice.\n \nAs to heirlooms and swords...  Various writers do talk about the sword  as \nbeing an extension of a samurai&#39;s soul, and certainly the idea that swords  \nhave spirits would be completely in keeping with Shinto beliefs, in which  \neverything has a kami spirit.  And no doubt there were families who passed  \nalong swords along with other family treasures, just as families will pass \ndown  jewelry.  And while I&#39;m sure that a family&#39;s identity wasn&#39;t exactly  \ndependant upon keeping &quot;the family sword&quot;, it IS worth noting that a sword is  \namong the sacred objects of the Japanese Imperial Regalia.  \n \n--RMB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
