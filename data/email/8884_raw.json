A daisho on a katana-kake is normally\nwith the katana on the top and the wakizashi at the bottom, to make it\neasier to pick up the katana in an emergency, in those days when these\nthings mattered. Sometimes the shoto of a daisho is a tanto and this is more\nusual if the daito is a tachi, but it can be a tanto with a katana. How\nswords were displayed on their racks in a samurai household would indicate\nto any visitor the state of preparedness of the occupants and so it was an\nimportant part of sword etiquette. Also I would certainly not describe a\ntanto as &quot;a small utilitarian knife more of a tool than a weapon&quot;. Tanto are\nmade in the same manner as other swords and are as magnificent as any other\nblades, just smaller. They are certainly classed as a weapon and count\nNational Treasures amongst their number, some of which date back to the\nKamakura period and even earlier.\nI may be misunderstanding the original question, but I have never, as far as\nI can remember seen, 3 matching swords other than in the realm of cheap\nmodern reproductions.\nI hope this does not contradict the samurai history subject of this list,\nbut I felt the points worth noting.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;federico trejos&quot; &lt;federicotrejos@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2006 3:03 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] SWORD SETS\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Good morning.\n&gt; In a kake in that fashion usually the first blade from\n&gt; up to down is the shortest one and is called &quot;Tanto&quot;.\n&gt; A small utilitarian knife, more a tool than a weapon.\n&gt; But it does not mean that it could not be used as the\n&gt; second.   The second blade a medium sized one, was\n&gt; called &quot;Wakisashi&quot;, it was a small katana made as\n&gt; companion for the &quot;Katana&quot; which is the third one and\n&gt; the longest in this fashion.\n&gt; A double sword kake: whit a Wakisashi and a Katana, is\n&gt; called a &quot;Daisho&quot; ( also when a person is using this,\n&gt; it is said he is wearing a daisho ) in a Daisho\n&gt; swords are called Daito and Shoto respectively.\n&gt; Best regards.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Correo Yahoo!\n&gt; Espacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis!\n&gt; Reg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
