AJ Bryant is excellent\ntoo. \n\nFor those who complain about Turnbull&#39;s (lack of)\nscholarship: Have you read any nof his newer books?\nEither the Kakure-kirishtan or the one on the Korean\ninvasions? I have not yet (I want the Korean invasion\nbook) but I believe they are probably based a little\nmore on original research than his older books. Again,\nrewrites to get more copies sold, I believe. \n\n--&gt; Nate, without double checking sources and dates, the Korean Invasion\nbook is in my opinion an excellant read, and worth every penny spent.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t mean his writing is worthless or bad. All\nit means is TONY, YOU NEED TO PUBLISH MORE, to give us\nsomething else! (Tony, you know I love you!)\n\nNate Ledbetter\n\n\n---&gt; Nate, I also agree with this, and Tony, as part of a publishing\nbusiness, if you have any interest in getting back into print in a small way\ndrop me a note offline and we can discuss more.\n\nAnd sorry everyone else for a blanant plug here, and taking advantage of an\nopportunity, buts its Nates fault, he lead me on &lt;grin&gt;\n\nKind regards\n\nRob\n\nRob Broom\nWarhammer Historical General Manager\nrobb@...\nwww.warhammer-historical.com\n\n\n"
