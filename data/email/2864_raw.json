A the battle of \nToba--Fushimi ,which happened by accident, the Shinsen-gumi lead the \nTokugawa forces. They fought a bitter argument to be first in line \ncause they thought so highly of themselves. Carrying sword and spear \nthey the first to encounter the Satsuma-Choshu troops and the first to \nbe cut down. Their retreat prevented the western trained Tokugawa \ntroops behind them to organize properly thus the advantage was given to \nthe loyalist army with the first shots. After this I beleive it was \nHijikata who said &quot;swords are useless, the age of the gun is here..&quot; or \nsomething to that effect.\n\tSurely though you are thinking of Tabaruzaka, 17 days of slaughter on \nthe outskirts of Kumamoto. In a small pass in the hills, covered by \nthick bamboo grove, in the pouring rain (it rained for 15 days!) the \n&quot;samurai&quot; army from Satsuma repeatedly attacked and repelled the \nGovernment troops. Their guns were nearly useles in the constant \ndownpour, they couldn&#39;t maneuver as they had been trained and they had \nno covering artillery.\n\tOn the 16th day the farmers were replaced by Aizu samurai, who carried \na burning hatred for Satsuma, artillery was finally in place nearby on \na commanding hilltop and the rain stopped. It was all she wrote after \nthat...\n-t\n\nKosu ni kosarenu Tabaruzaka!!\n\n\n"
