Again, off the \n&gt; top of my head - I think the entries ranged from\n&gt; historical fiction, \n&gt; pulp fiction, what if, and ghost stories, but Ive\n&gt; probably missed one \n&gt; or two genres. The judging will start within 24\n&gt; hours.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
