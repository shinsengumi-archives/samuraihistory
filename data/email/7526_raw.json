I just joined the email \ngroup though\n&gt; I&#39;ve been posting on the Delphi message board under the tag line\n&gt; &quot;Nevermore...&quot; (which is a NFL football reference, as I \nparticipate in some\n&gt; other Delphi forums and we discuss football. But needless to say, \nI won&#39;t\n&gt; discuss football here). I also participate (I&#39;m a moderator) in \nthe Ninja\n&gt; Dojo Samurai Film message board on EZBoard and there, I&#39;m known \nas &quot;Wave\n&gt; Tossed&quot; (which I use for Amazon.com book and movie reviews and \nIMDB movie\n&gt; reviews). Email me if you want more information on the Ninja Dojo \nsite.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So just a little introduction: My name is Nina Boal, I&#39;m female, \nAmerican\n&gt; (live in the Baltimore, Maryland region), in my late fifties. I \nbecame\n&gt; interested in Japanese history many years ago when I was studying \nkendo. I\n&gt; studied kendo for around ten years, achieving the rank of shodan. \nA severe\n&gt; back injury has taken me out of kendo study. Now I have severe \narthritis of\n&gt; the knees and am wondering if I could ever take up the study of \niaido at\n&gt; this late stage, even with crippled knees. I do participate in \nswimming\n&gt; exercise and physical therapy to try and make my knees stronger \nbut I still\n&gt; cannot sit in the seiza position because of my knees. \n&gt;  \n&gt; In the meantime, I became a fan of Japanese cinema, particularly \nperiod\n&gt; dramas, jidai-geki and chambara films. The swordfighting in \nchambara films\n&gt; is not usually related to real kenjutsu or kendo; one of my kendo \nsenseis\n&gt; used to admonish his students by telling us, &quot;that&#39;s not kendo, \nthat&#39;s\n&gt; chambara!!&quot; Still, I like watching these films. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Which have inspired me to begin writing period pieces. I started \nout writing\n&gt; in fantasy/science fiction and have had several short stories \npublished in\n&gt; anthologies that have been available on the mass market. But my \ndirection in\n&gt; writing has shifted to writing historical pieces, particularly \nabout\n&gt; Japanese samurai. One of my efforts is &quot;Stray Dogs,&quot; which you can \nread on\n&gt; the Samurai Archives web site. It won the First Samurai Fiction \nShort Story\n&gt; contest. It is about a man whom I&#39;ve been interested in for years, \nFuwa\n&gt; Kazuemon, one of the Forty Seven Ronin. I&#39;m currently working on a \nnovel\n&gt; involving completely fictional characters that takes place in 18th \ncentury\n&gt; Japan. \n&gt;  \n&gt; So, finally to get to the topic here. I&#39;m a huge film buff. So \nhere are my\n&gt; Top Ten Samurai Movies. The order is not static, though SEPPUKU \n(&quot;Hara\n&gt; Kiri&quot;) always remains on the top:\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. Seppuku (aka &quot;Hara Kiri&quot;): The best movie made, period, on any \nsubject\n&gt; from any country. Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshiro) and Ishihama \n(Chijiiwa Motome)\n&gt; were both stunning, as was Tamba (Onodaka Hikokuro) playing a real\n&gt; slimeball. A study of false &quot;bushido&quot; versus the real way of the \nwarrior. A\n&gt; film made in 1962 about some 17th century Japanese people, and \nwe&#39;re still\n&gt; avidly discussing it in 2005 all over the world. Illustrates the \nstaying\n&gt; power of a true classic.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. The Seven Samurai: Another real classic and deservedly so. The \nfirst\n&gt; samurai film I had ever seen. \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. The Last Samurai directed by Misumi, not the one by Zwick with \nCruise in\n&gt; it (don&#39;t get me started on that one... ) A truly epic film that \ncaptures\n&gt; the end of the feudal era and the beginning of a more modern era \nin Japan. \n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Three Outlaw Samurai: I believe that this was Gosha&#39;s first \nfilm. This\n&gt; time, Tamba Tetsuro plays the oppressed good guy who comes to the \naid of\n&gt; those even more oppressed than he is. \n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Tange Sazen: I&#39;m just listing the character&#39;s name because all \nof the\n&gt; versions I&#39;ve seen of this tale are tied for this position: \nGosha&#39;s two\n&gt; films (with Yorozuya Kinnosuke and also with Nakadai Tatsuya), the \nolder\n&gt; films with Otomo Ryutaro plus another with Tamba Tetsuro; and the \nnew one\n&gt; with Toyokawa: all are quality films about this fascinating one-\neyed,\n&gt; one-armed swordsman.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Goyokin: Nakadai again, playing a man haunted by his role in the\n&gt; slaughter of a fishing village, and how he makes amends for what \nhe has done\n&gt; as he saves another fishing village from slaughter.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. Samurai Wolf: Natsuyagi Isao is great as a scroungy, hungry \nronin named\n&gt; Kiba Okaminosuke (&quot;Fangs of the Wolf&quot;) who comes into town working \nfor food.\n&gt; He wants to be a fierce &quot;wolf&quot; but in many ways, is more like a \nsweet,\n&gt; wistful puppy dog. Though he does wield a really mean sword. \nNatsuyagi also\n&gt; plays Fuwa Kazuemon in the TV special DAI CHUSHINGURA and does an \nexcellent\n&gt; job there as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; 8. Shogun&#39;s Samurai: The Yagyu Conspiracy: Grand tragedy with a \nbig cast of\n&gt; stellar performers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tied for ninth/tenth place:\n&gt; Hidden Blade: A recent film about a man who must decide between \nloyalty and\n&gt; doing the right thing according to his beliefs. \n&gt; After The Rain: A ronin and his wife find that there are more \nimportant\n&gt; things than fame or position. \n&gt; Twilight Samurai: Sanada is magnificent as a low-ranked, \nimpoverished\n&gt; samurai (who is an excellent swordsman) who must deal with raising \nhis\n&gt; family as a single parent, and also must deal with a difficult \ntask given to\n&gt; him by his lord. \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n[mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of bellaireroad\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 30, 2005 12:58 AM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Top Ten Samurai Movies\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s your pick 1-10?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt; \n&gt; --- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; YAHOO!
