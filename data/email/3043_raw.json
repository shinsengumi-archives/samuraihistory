As for the movie, if the blade impacted just behind the action of the rifle, I would say that it&#39;s almost easy. Maybe we can see that on the DVD. The sword that Algren carried was freshly forged and probably had the sharpest and strongest blade on the field of battle that day. \n\n  Josh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:I know the movie was inaccurate, and I tried to put that past it, and judge it as a movie..even then it still sucked.. like when Tom cruise sliced thru a rifle w/ a sword?? or all the sword fights striking the blades edge on edge repeatedly.. that was all crap.. there was lots of other stuff too.. \n\n\n  --\n\n  --------- Original Message ---------\n  DATE: Sat, 10 Jan 2004 13:23:17\n  From: Mmupton1@...\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Cc: \n\n  I do not think &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is historically accurate, but I think the \n  battle at the very end of the movie actually did take place, something like the \n  gun powder rebellion. Well, anyway I also thought it was a good movie. It was \n  quit touching. I went to go see it with my friends when it first came out, \n  they try to act as if they are tough, but when we walked out of the theater they \n  were balling their eyes out. We dont talk about that to this day though. Yeah \n  it was a good movie.\n  -Matthew Upton\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n\n\n  Yahoo!
