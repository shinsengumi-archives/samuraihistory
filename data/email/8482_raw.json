Can anyone expand on the cannon \n&gt;theory though? Sounds interesting.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;I had looked into this several months ago (the use or lack thereof of \n&gt;Tokugawa cannon at Sekigahara).\n&gt;The Governor-general of Nagasaki (who was also in charge of Kioesjoe, where \n&gt;Adam&#39;s ship De Liefde landed) sent a Jesuit to inspect and inventory the \n&gt;ship. Among other things, they found 500 muskets and 19 (or 18, depending \n&gt;on the account) bronze guns (cannons). Ieyasu took the guns and cannon \n&gt;after his third interview with Adams. A later Jesuit account states that it \n&gt;was the 19 guns that provided the margin of victory at Sekigahara. However, \n&gt;none of Adam&#39;s letters mention the cannon being used and (aside from a \n&gt;short mention in one of Tony&#39;s Osprey samurai books) this was the only \n&gt;mention of the Tokugawa forces using cannon at Sekigahara I could find \n&gt;(although it&#39;s well documented that Ishida used several). I&#39;ve never seen \n&gt;them mentioned in a Japanese source. Since the Jesuits were known to slant \n&gt;history for their own purposes, my opinion is that the account of the \n&gt;cannon being used was fabricated to show the &#39;menace&#39; of Protestant traders \n&gt;in Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;Yahoo!
