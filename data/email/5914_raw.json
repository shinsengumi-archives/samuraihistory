But from what I gathered from the \nliterature the practice was a inherited from Korea and or China and \nwas all but forgotten by the rise samurai class.   Other then that \nthe only shield I have seen was an over sized round disk in place of \nthe  kekko on the left  kote that was about the size of a small \nbuckler that could be used as a shield.   But my guess is it was a \none of a kind piece and not at all common.   \n\nAmbrose\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;slleestakk&quot; &lt;toonakan@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Did samurai warriors use any type of shield? If so could I please \nget \n&gt; a description of it if at all possible? Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n"
