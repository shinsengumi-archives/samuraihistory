The\nepisodes I saw I quite enjoyed, but that&#39;s partially\nbecause I found the contrast between the events\ndepicted there and how they were in &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; quite\namusing. Only saw one episode of &quot;Musashi&quot;, it was a\nsnorer, I thought. &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; will be interesting,\nif only because I&#39;m here.\n\nNate\n\n--- Kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; So does it look like the Shinsengumi drama will be\n&gt; worth watching?  \n&gt; It will probably start coming into the Japanese vid\n&gt; store here in a \n&gt; few weeks, but I don&#39;t know, I had no interest in\n&gt; Musashi, and I \n&gt; couldn&#39;t bear &#39;Toshie to Matsu&#39; and didn&#39;t get\n&gt; beyond the first \n&gt; episode, so I don&#39;t know...  I haven&#39;t really liked\n&gt; a Taiga drama \n&gt; since Tokugawa Yoshinobu.  But much like William and\n&gt; &#39;The Last \n&gt; Samurai&#39;, I had to listen to my wife talk about how\n&gt; Kokkoii &quot;Mok-kun&quot; \n&gt; was the whole time. Motoki Masahiro usually comes\n&gt; across as too \n&gt; effeminate in a lot of his other shows and movies\n&gt; (like, say, as the \n&gt; gay nightclub partyboy in &#39;Gonin&#39;, for example), but\n&gt; I thought he was \n&gt; real good in Tokugawa Yoshinobu.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
