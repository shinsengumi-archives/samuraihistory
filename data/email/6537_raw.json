It \nfeatured a \n&gt; left handed samurai who wore his swords on the right. Are there any \nfamous \n&gt; historical figures who done this? I have never seen anyone in kendo \nor Iai \n&gt; practice left handed, so I was just wondering?\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul\n\nAlmost 99.99% of swordsman were right handed. Since Japan belived in \nsome form of conformity at the time, left handedness was not well \nrecived and often left handed people were forced to be right handed. \nAlso they way samurai walked on roads forced them to be right handed, \nsince the sword was on the left side, they often walked on the left \nside of the road, as not to bang their sword on someone. \n\nThere is no disadvantage for being left handed and using a sword with \nthe right, aside from a minor discomfort at first, you grow out of \nit. In some sword styles the left hand controlled the power of the \nsword, the right controlled direction. \n\nAs for left handed styles, I do not know completely, maybe it was a \nstory arch to make the character look odd compared to the rest of \nsociety. There are some styles of iaido though that teach left handed \ndraws, the saya still on the left side though. Such a draw can be \nseen at the end of Sanjuro.\n\nMaikeru\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
