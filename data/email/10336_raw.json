These were the struggles between various clans and the Shogunate for co=\r\nntrol of Japan after the Perry era and leading to the Meiji restoration.Thi=\r\ns also involved modernisation of the state and trying to preserve Japan&#39;s i=\r\nndependence from the colonial powers- notably Great Britain, France and the=\r\n U.S.A., who wished to take economic control in the way that was starting i=\r\nn China. \n\nThis modernisation,however, wasn&#39;t to everyones taste, especiall=\r\ny for many Samurai, hence a series of rebellions including 1877 which is ba=\r\nsically the theme of the film. \n\nAs to actual military assistance, the Japa=\r\nnese were understandably cautious about where to get it from. France and Br=\r\nitain were the main source of weapons initially as they were the world&#39;s ma=\r\njor powers.\n\nThere were French military missions to the army in the &#39;60s wh=\r\nilst the British provided naval training, and many of the ships.The US had =\r\nno military reputation prior to their civil war, but lots of surplus weapon=\r\ns afterwards! They then did supply, unofficially, some advisors but I haven=\r\n&#39;t got my file handy with fuller details.\n\nPortugal had once been the only =\r\ncountry allowed to trade with Japan but were replaced by the Dutch East Ind=\r\nies Company in about 1642(?), and they eventually supplied limited numbers =\r\nof flintlock muskets which the Japanese copied and used until the 1860s, bu=\r\nt such trade was strictly limited- one ship a year IIRC. \n\nGermany did not =\r\ncome onto the scene until after their victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1=\r\n870-1), as the country did not previously exist as such; they then replaced=\r\n the French as their reputation had taken a beating.\n\nAs to diplomats, all =\r\npowers including America had representatives in Japan; indeed I think Japan=\r\n sent an ambassador to Washington in about 1868?\n\nA fascinating period and =\r\nmuch overlooked, most histories merely saying something on the lines of &quot; P=\r\nerry opened up Japan, the Emperor was restored to power and Japan became a =\r\nmodern state&quot;!\n\nBTW, it is very doubtful if more than a handful of the Samu=\r\nrai at this time still fought in armour or even on horseback- so ideas abou=\r\nt 16th century armies with modern firearms are off the mark.\n\nHope this hel=\r\nps.\n\nNick\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;DuaneS&quot; &lt;desolley@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am assuming that the American interest in Japan faded after the=\r\n American Civil War began. However, when the Samurai revolt (probably not t=\r\nhe correct way of stating it) began in 1871(?), which Tom Cruise played the=\r\n part of a Yankee soldier (The Last Samurai) sent to help the ruling family=\r\n change the method of fighting, criticism of the movie was mostly about the=\r\n Americans not being involved but the Portugese and Germans. Was their ever=\r\n any attempt to have the Americans assist in the training? Did the United S=\r\ntates have any type of consul or ambassador in Japan during this period?\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
