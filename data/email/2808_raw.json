I do not believe they are \n&gt; &quot;inaccurate.&quot; Inaccurate would be something that wants to be \n&gt; historically accurate but it&#39;s not. Here we talk about plain historical \n&gt; FICTION. The two main characters of &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; are NOT \n&gt; historical characters, so, to expect accuracy is a paradox. This is a \n&gt; major Hollywood production that entertains for a couple of hours, and \n&gt; that&#39;s it. It has been done to make $$$, and features one of the most \n&gt; popular actors in the world. It&#39;s not a cult-movie for a bunch of \n&gt; scholars of the samurai. So, take it or leave it, but if we criticize \n&gt; the movie, we should do so thinking of what the movie IS, not what we \n&gt; would like the movie TO BE.\n\nI take a much harder view. &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; is historical fiction, but it \ndoesn&#39;t pretend to present a &quot;real&quot; historical event. I have no problems with it \n(although I can&#39;t stand it for other reasons).\n\n&quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; likewise, as a comedy doesn&#39;t pretend to be history. I \nhave no problem with it. &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; on the other hand, plays fast and loose \nwith history and historical characters and events and fails the test.\n\nNo one thinks &quot;Robin Hood&quot; is history. No one thinks &quot;Lion in Winter&quot; is \nhistory, but a fictive &quot;slice of life&quot; look at the family of Henry II.\n\n&quot;Braveheart&quot; masquerades as history, as does &quot;Last Samurai.&quot;\n\nIck.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
