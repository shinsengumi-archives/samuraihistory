Another croaching tiger hidden \ndragon. But with out the life points.The movie was to focused with \ncable antics and not enough truth.Popular culture will suck it up \njust like the poor remake of the old Zatoichi.Jump around and dance \nthrough Scenes that would have had a message in the past.I guess I&#39;m \nasking to much. More fact and less 21st century fiction.--- In \nsamuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, James Eckman &lt;ronin_engineer@c...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Subject: Article: Quirky comedy, brutal violence in \nKitano&#39;s &#39;Zatoichi&#39;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Quirky comedy, brutal violence in Kitano&#39;s &#39;Zatoichi&#39;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;By Jason Wallis\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Recently, I expressed my distaste for director Zhang Yimou&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;critically lauded swordplay film &quot;Hero,&quot; which for all its pretty \n&gt; &gt;colors and elaborate fight scenes failed to represent anything \n&gt; &gt;meaningful, or even entertaining. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Not related to a half hour cut out by Miramax... See:\n&gt; http://www.monkeypeaches.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw it uncut, but I was not that impressed either, but since it \nwas a \n&gt; Chinese version without subtitles, I was pretty lost. &quot;Legend of Zu \n&gt; Mountain&quot; was similar, great special effects, famous actors, poor \nplot. \n&gt; Sounds like a Lucas film.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot;The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi&quot; \n&gt; &gt;serves as a fine antidote. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Dr. Jim recommends taking it even if you don&#39;t see Hero.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Carlo Tacchini&quot; &lt;TSUBAME1@T...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I highly recommend this movie. The final Matsuri-style ballet is a \ngem\n&gt; &gt;in itself. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; The tap dancing was just wonderfully silly. Of course if you get \ntoo \n&gt; happy after seeing this, you can see the &quot;Twilight Samurai&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n\n\n"
