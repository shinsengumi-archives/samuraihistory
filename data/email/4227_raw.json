Do you have any further information? What&#39;s the title?\n\n&gt;you will see that most are listed with one primary and two \n&gt;minor mon. usually these represent the main house, the mothers house \n&gt;and the fathers house. In the case of direct lineage within the main \n&gt;house, one might represent the generation in question. Any one might  \n&gt;be given to retainers as reward further confusing the issue.\n\nYes, this is the situation I&#39;m more familiar with and referred to \nearlier. It&#39;s the situation where one family (or one person) has \nseveral different mon, including some that are given as gifts from \nsomeone else. But these are not necessarily used in combinations of \nthree.\n\n&gt;\tWhen one looks at sword furniture,armour and other items we often see \n&gt;a single mon applied, depending on age and quality the assumption is \n&gt;these are made for retainers and only with convincing provenance said \n&gt;to be those of some lord. for example;\n&gt;\tA daughter of the house of Shimazu, is adopted into the Kuge (court \n&gt;families) and then married to the Tokugawa Shogun. Thus as a wedding \n&gt;gift to her Shimazu father we see a koshirae with Shimazu, Aoi and Kiku \n&gt;mon all applied to the saya and fittings. Based on late-Edo history one \n&gt;wouldn&#39;t expect to see these three in combination..\n\nThat must be an amazing piece of work. I guess this must be the story \nof Atsuhime?\n\nIn your experience would these three mon then be used by the family \n(I guess Tokugawa) to represent the famil?. For instance would the \nthree mon be used on mon-tsuki or other personal items by the children \nof the marriage?\n\nOr is it more likely that these three mon, used in combination, were \nbasically symbols of the marriage - the coming together of the \nfamilies. Therefore they were symbols used to represent a particular \nevent but they were not really used to represent the families per se.\n\nDoes that distinction make sense?\n\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
