The name of the work apparently refers to a collec=\r\ntion (=E9=9B=86) of writing written for the benefit of =E5=88=9D=E5=BF=83=\r\n=E8=80=85, beginners or novices in Bushido. What was the reason for needing=\r\n to write down the code of Bushido in Bushido Shoshinshu at that particular=\r\n moment in Japan history? Was it because there was suddenly a bunch of novi=\r\nce samurai around that needed instruction in how to behave properly as a go=\r\nod samurai? Was it because conservatives lamented that young samurai were n=\r\no longer following the old traditional Bushido ways, and Bushido Shoshinshu=\r\n was an attempt to re-establish the older traditional behavioral standards =\r\nof the good ol=E2=80=99 days? Were there simply too many rude, uncouth samu=\r\nrai acting anti-socially? Or was there a political motive? \n\n \n\nMy own spec=\r\nulation is this. Instead of looking backward to try to re-establish older s=\r\namurai traditions, the Tokugawa shogunate was trying to establish a brand n=\r\new innovative model for samurai: to rein in these unruly samurai and conver=\r\nt them from bloodthirsty sengoku-jidai marauders into nice Tokugawa bureauc=\r\nrats. That is just my own uneducated guess, as I have not read Bushido Shos=\r\nhinshu.\n\n \n\nDoes anyone know the motivation for the writing of Bushido Shos=\r\nhinshu? Anyone agree or disagree with my speculation?\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nMike\n\n =\r\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com] On Behalf Of jonathan ellgen\nSent: Saturday, May 06, 2006 11=\r\n:10 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] bus=\r\nhido\n\n \n\nThe actual formalization of the Bushido code  occurred in the Edo =\r\nperiod, but various forms of this code existed as  early as the Heian Perio=\r\nd. I am not an expert on the subject of  bushido, but it is my observation =\r\nthat the bushi class followed a code  of ethics/behaviors from the point in=\r\n which they established themselves  as a definable group in the late 12th c=\r\nentury. \n  \n  According to Minoru Kiyota from the University of Wisconsin, =\r\nthere were  4 types of codes based on the time period (Heian, Kamakura, Sen=\r\ngoku,  Tokugawa). The Heian code was based on loyalty and benevolence. The =\r\n code of the Kamakura period was called &#39;bando musha no narai&#39; and  similar=\r\n to the previous code. The Sengoku code is also based on  loyalty, but in t=\r\nhe context of extreme violence. Of course, the  Tokugawa period is when we =\r\nsee the Bushido that most people would  recognize.\n  \n  Bushido Shoshinshu =\r\nwas written  sometime between 1639 and 1730--I do not have a specific date.=\r\n It is  just my opinion, but I feel that it was just an off-shoot of the  s=\r\namurai rules created by Ieyasu and written by Suden. If that is the  case, =\r\nyou could argue that the date you are looking for is August 30,  1615.\n  \n =\r\n After all that, I really dont have a specific date for Bushido... I  guess=\r\n it depends on what you want to recongnize as the true Way.  Regional codes=\r\n existed as well, so Im sure someone has more specific  info than I do. It =\r\nis a good topic though.\n  \n  Jonathan Ellgen\n  \n  Ijin Mibu &lt;ijinmibu@yahoo=\r\n.com&gt; wrote:          When did samurai start fallowing bushido?
