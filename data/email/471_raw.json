That is part of a buddhist prayer inviting the gods to put the problems or suffering of the amako family on him.  He said this as a loyal retainer vowing to help his lords family.\n\nIn buddhism they often list things in groups for easy memorization.  Such as the eightfold path or the 4 noble truths.  Perhaps these are part of a list, but I could not find these lists in the short search I did.
