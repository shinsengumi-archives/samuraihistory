Then click emulaators, and then pick the genesis \none.  Sfter you download the emulator, click on roms on the right \nhand side and pick Genesis.  THe games are arranged in alphabetical \norder.  They have a lot of games for genesis, and they do not take up \nmuch space on the hard drive.   To play you open your genesis \nemulators, and then click file, open rom, and then pick the game that \nyou have saved to your computer.  Kind of a round about way to get it \nI guess, but it is free.  \n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
