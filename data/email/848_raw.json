This \nwas a bonus to him because the Oda families strength was in using a select \ncore of men from Owari (Nobunaga&#39;s home province) as captains of Oda&#39;s armies \nand Horse guards.\n He was given the fief of Fuchu in Echizen (33,000 Koku) and was one third of \nthe group called the &#39;Fuchu Sanninshu&#39; or Fuchu triumvate, a group of strong \nvassals serving under the Oda house.\n As one of Nobunaga&#39;s retainers from the years around his (Oda&#39;s) fathers \ndeath Maeda was a trusted and reliable part of the Oda clan and was one of a \ngroup of samurai entrusted with the running of the armies for Nobunaga...As \nsuch you could presume that their relationship was based on a high degree of \nboth trust and reliability. \n Toshiie was moved from Fuchu to Noto province in 1581 but the evidence on \nthe move seems not to show that he was moved because of distrust but rather \nmoved to support the group of Maeda&#39;s vassals as one unit and allow the group \nto expand. This again supports the strong picture of a deep trust between the \ntwo.\n The picture that emerges is of a relationship of both trust and dependance \non Maeda from Nobunaga...How far this went is unclear although it is probable \nthat the TV series has invented much of the relationship to promote \nstoryline. They were close, trusting and friendly and as a Captain of the Oda \nforces Maeda would need to have been!\n Good books to read on the two of them are &quot;The Samurai sorcebook&quot; by Stephen \nTurnbull which provides a very basic overview and a little information on \nthem both. Another one to read is &quot;Japonius Tyrranus&quot; by Jerome Lamers...Both \navailable through Amazon I think...\n HTH.\n Abayo.\n Ben Sharples\n\n"
