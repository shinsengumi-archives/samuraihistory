It is on the Military History channel.\n\nThere&#39;s a brief review I did of the final production and some  \nscreenshots of it on the Tosando board. It might whet your appetite  \nfor it:  http://military.discovery.com/tv/warriors/episode-guide/episode-guide.html \n  )\n\nThe series itself is about several great historical military leaders  \nat their crossroads: Attila, Cortes, Napoleon, Richard the  \nLionhearted, Spartacus, and Ieyasu. It&#39;s showing this week (starting  \nFriday night with Attila), and my ep on Tokugawa Ieyasu is on this  \nSunday. (Ironically, the Japanese drama is on Sunday, Dec. 7. Gotta  \nlove it.)\n\nAbout this episode (from their webpage): &quot;Tokugawa Leyasu is a  \ntowering figure in Japanese history. He is Oliver Cromwell, Richard  \nThe Lionheart and Alfred The Great combined - the man who overthrew  \nthe governing dynasty of Japan and established a regime that would  \nlast for centuries.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;ll be shown several times.\n\nMore about the Warriors series and show times: http://military.discovery.com/tv/warriors/about/about.html\n\nHistorically speaking, it&#39;s not perfect -- we had to conflate months  \nof political machinations and maneuvering and conflict into one hour,  \nso some historical personages got rolled into one, and others just  \naren&#39;t there, and there&#39;s more reliance on the &quot;bushido&quot; thing than I  \nwould have preferred (and there&#39;s even a ninja attack that I BEGGED  \nthem not to do) but it&#39;s still a stunning production, and all things  \nconsidered I&#39;m pleased and proud to have been attached to it. I don&#39;t  \nknow what is going to have to be cut out for the US release to make  \nroom for commercials, and I really worry about that -- there is NO fat  \nin the show that can easily be trimmed. The UK version was 59 minutes  \nlong, and that was barely enough to do some semblance of justice to  \nthe story.\n\nWatch the episode, and then tell yourself &quot;they did this with only 75  \nextras and 25 horses&quot; and be amazed. Even Japanese TV had spots about  \nit on their news programs expressing surprise and admiration for the  \nquality and scale of the production given what the budget was. (Heck,  \njust look at the screen shots!)\n\nCheck out the show, and let me know you what you think.\n\nEffingham\n\n"
