The historian &quot;expert&quot; was Stephen \nTurnbull and the &quot;Ninja Master expert&quot; was Stephen Hayes.  I would like to \nknow what everyone thought of it.  Personally, it hurt me inside.\n\n\nTony,\n\n  On a totally unrelated note, I have always liked the term &quot;Second American \nRevolution&quot;  :-)\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDonï¿½t just search.
