No doubt he was a great swordsman,writer, artist, gardner etc etc.\n   \n  yet when you take it all in context what was his overall impact on the times, no doubt he was well respected but his life must have been a somewhat empty one, there have been many equally skilled swordmen and to be honest far greater samurai who&#39;s impact was far greater in a historical context, if musashi had&#39;nt wrote his teachings down , would he be as revered as he is today, and as mentioned before look at how he is used in video games, comics etc and is given a pop icon status, this only gives him a mythic like status that simply was&#39;nt true.\n   \n  Personally I find the the campaigns of someone like Kato Kiyomasa or others far more important and equally heroic then that of musashi, whos hermit like lifestyle I find somewhat tragic.\n   \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
