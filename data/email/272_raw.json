Lyle Parker&quot; &lt;rntihg@...&gt;\r\n\r\nHi All,\n\nWent home and looked at what resources I have desk-side.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous post, Hideyoshi did indeed study under the \nChikurin style of archery.  What is more, so did Nobunaga and Hidetsugu.\n\nStill did not find much in the way of information about samurai practising \nunarmed combat, except for the following short mention by John Rogers:\n\np. 416 &quot;Most of the martial traditions of the [late Muromachi] period were \ncomposite arts that taught the use of a number of bladed weapons as wells as \narmed and unarmed combat.&quot;\n\n&quot;Arts of War in Times of Peace&quot; _Monumenta Nipponica_, Vol. 45, no. 4\n\nAnother interesting article is by Hurst and may (for some) be a little more \naccessible than his book:\n\n&quot;Ryuha in the Martial and Other Japanese Arts&quot;. _Journal of Asian Martial \nArts_, Vol. 4, no. 4, 1995.\n\nThis article likely is like an abstract of the information on ryuha in the \nbook (_Armed Martial Arts of Japan_), and is good supplementary info if a \nbit off-thread.\n\nCheers,\n\nShannon\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\nThere is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there \nis a Catskill eagle in some souls that can dive alike down into the blackest \ngorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. \nAnd even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the \nmountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still \nhigher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.\n-- Herman Melville, _Moby Dick_, &quot;The Try-works&quot;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n\n"
