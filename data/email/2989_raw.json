He suffered \nthe loss of his Matsudaira vassals soon=\r\n afterwards and managed to \nalienate many of his retainers due to his often=\r\n thoughtless nature. \nBetween 1561 and 1565, he felt compelled to execute o=\r\nr quell a \nnumber of his men, including Ii Naochika (1562) and Ii=F4 Tsurut=\r\natsu \n(1565). He came into conflict with the Takeda and although Ujizane \nw=\r\nas the son of Takeda Shingen&#39;s sister, the latter invaded Suruga in \n1568 w=\r\nhile Tokugawa Ieyasu attacked T=F4t=F4mi. As Ujizane was married \nto a daug=\r\nhter of H=F4j=F4 Ujiyasu, the H=F4j=F4 offered the Imagawa \nassistance but =\r\nto no avail. By 1570 Shingen had taken Sumpu and \nUjizane essentially surre=\r\nndered to Tokugawa Ieyasu from Kakegawa \nCastle. He retired to Kyoto in 157=\r\n5 and had hopes that he might \nrecieve Sumpu once the Takeda were defeated =\r\nin 1582, but Nobunaga \nrefused to allow Tokugawa to do this. He eventually =\r\njoined Tokugawa \nat Edo, having taken the name S=F4kan and the tonsure. He =\r\nwas \nsupported by Ieyasu until his death in 1614.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;W.
