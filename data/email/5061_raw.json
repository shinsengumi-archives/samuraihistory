Whoa.\n\nIn the first place, this is the seventh chapter of a book in the \nrough draft, so by this time, the showing has already done and a \nlittle bit of telling is in order. I just wanted a critique of the \n_chain of events_.\n\nAs for names, if I&#39;m not writing a book set in historical Japan, I \nthink the fantasy names are probably a better idea. Hear me out: \nlook, if this was a remake of Shogun I would certainly try to use \nJapanese names. It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a fantasy world very much like a \ncertain period in Japanese history, and I think trying to use real \nJapanese names would actually cloud the issue.\n\nFor example, if I write a fantasy novel that uses the term &quot;Shogun&quot; I \nam reprimanded for having fantasy aspects in what should be a work of \nhistorical fiction. If I write with the term &quot;Jogun&quot; (which I thought \nwas a fair fantasy bastardization, if one exists) I&#39;m slammed for it \nbeing a knockoff. Help me win, guys. Help me find the right thing to \ndo here.\n\nAgain, this is the seventh chapter, in rough draft, taken out of \ncontext, and a fantasy novel. I appreciate the critiques, and \napologize for not being clearer in defining my terms. It&#39;s great that \nyou guys are tkaing the time to set me straight on such important \nissues, I love this sort of stuff.\n\nGrateful,\n\nLili\n\n\n"
