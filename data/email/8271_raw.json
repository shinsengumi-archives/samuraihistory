The rules are called Killer Katanas 2.  \n\nThe origi=\r\nnal edition was published back in 1995 and I have just \nrecently published =\r\nan improved second version of the book.  The rules \nwere developed using th=\r\ne latest information at my disposal with the \nassistance of samurai authors=\r\n Terje Solumn and Dr. Stephen Turnbull.  \nSo popular was the first edition =\r\nof the rules that they were used as \na reference for the Electronic Arts PC=\r\n game &quot;Shogun: Total War&quot;.\n\nThe goal of KK2 is to allow larger battles of t=\r\nhe samurai to be \nfought.  Included in the 120+ page book is army lists and=\r\n rules for \nclans so that a player can recreate their favorite Daimyo&#39;s arm=\r\ny on \nthe tabletop, game uses for 22 tactical battle formations, ability \nr=\r\natings for over 500 Daimyo, siege rules, a points system for \ndesigning arm=\r\nies and battles, a scenario generator and 10 historical \nbattle scenarios: =\r\n4th Kawanakajima, 2nd Konodai, Mimasetoge, \nNunobeyama, Anegawa, Mikatagaha=\r\nra, Nagashino, Okitanawate, Hitotori \nBridge and Sekigahara.\n\nThe rules are=\r\n laser printed on high-quality paper and are spiral \nbound with a glossy co=\r\nver depicting a scene from the Battle of \nTennoji.  Even if you are not a g=\r\namer the book is full of information \nand contains many items never before =\r\nprinted in the English language.\n\nIf you are interested in a copy you can g=\r\net one at Amazon.com by \ndoing a search for &quot;Killer Katanas,&quot; or you can or=\r\nder it direct from \nme by sending an email to BBradford1973@....  The c=\r\nost of each \nbook is $35 plus postage.  I can accept paypal.\n\nArrigato!\n\nBr=\r\nian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
