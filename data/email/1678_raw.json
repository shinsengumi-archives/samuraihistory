I&#39;m \nreally interested in some pretty specific information, any references \nwould be much appreciated: \n\nThe town of Hagi: Anyone know of a good resource on this town before the \nMori clan took over the area? I know a castle was built there after Mori \ntook control and that it was a center for fine pottery much later. I&#39;ve \nparsed all the official websites concerning Hagi, I think, but what I&#39;m \nreally looking for is a detailed map, preferably topographical, and \ninformation on the minor daimyo that controlled that area and any of the \noutlying areas of Nagato. \n\nAny information on Yamaguchi while Yoshitaka kept court there. Maps \npreferably. I found a great resource detailing Francis Xavier&#39;s time in \nYamaguchi (he actually left only a few weeks before Yoshitaka was \noverthrown). It had some specific info on Yamaguchi, but really need more \ndetail on the city in that era. \n\nI am aware of the work by Arnesen concerning the Ouchi rule of Nagato and \nSuo, but I haven&#39;t trucked down to the library to peruse that. I&#39;ve gotten \nsome information from that work through a third party, however. I have a \nfew of the Turnbull samurai books that shed a little light on that \nsituation as well. I also have parsed websites detailing the Mori clans \nactivities before and after Yoshitaka&#39;s fall, the few sites concerning \nHarukata and some other general information. I guess I&#39;m really looking \nmostly for obscure political information on that area and physical \ninformation on the land and towns. \n\nAnyway. Anything you have, online preferably. Much appreciated. \n\n-- \nRgB\n\n&quot;To become the enemy&quot; is to think yourself into into the enemy&#39;s position. \n-- Miyamoto Musashi\n\n\n"
