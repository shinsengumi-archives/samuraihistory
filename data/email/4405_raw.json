I have been part of the members for a year but this is the first time i post an email. I have a question about the samurai. In pc games like Age of Empires and Empires: Dawn of the modern world they show samurai as infantry troops. But in the Code of Bushido (which I own) they say that the samurai must put importance in horsemaship. Here is my question:\n \nAre the samurai horsemen that can shoot arrows and use swords from horses or infantry, or both?????\n \n                                                                        Quauhtli (eagle in Nahuatl language)\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
