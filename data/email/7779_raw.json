The\n&gt; best samurai I ever seen is the one reflected on\n&gt; that\n&gt; movie, although the movie is fictional.   It is\n&gt; imposible not to fall in love with that carachter.\n&gt; His mood, the way he behaves, what he does for\n&gt; others... even when he is in Sanchin ( martial\n&gt; attitude ).   I think he covers all the aspects of\n&gt; been a samurai and yet reflect a human side.\n&gt; Thatï¿½s a very interesting movie, I recomend it to\n&gt; all\n&gt; of you who have not seen it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards to all.\n\nI love this movie, but the main character only\nreflects what a western view of a samurai should be.\n\nAs for Bushido, like Chivalry of European warriors, it\nwas something talked about and practiced by young and\npeace time samurai and probably joked about by older\nsamurai.\n\nThe 47 Ronin sacrificed their honor and reputations to\ngive themselves the opportunity to avenge their\nMaster.  Then instead of taking matters into their own\nhands, they allowed judgment to be passed on them and\nas ronin they could not have HOPED to be allowed to\ncommit seppuku.  They must have expected to be\nexecuted (ronin do not have the right to seppuku) and\nthey must have been grateful for the privilege of\nseppuku.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
