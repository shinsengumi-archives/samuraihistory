But as a Manual of\nBushido (whatever that is) it falls far short. I&#39;m not sure how this book\ngot into the general public -- as far as I know, Yamamoto intended this to\nbe a private correspondance with members of his clan.\n\nThat being said: Yamamoto never fought in any battles in his life. He knew\nnothing at all about what it was like to actually face the concept of death;\nhe had never experienced this, never fought in a battle, never faced\ngrinding poverty or hunger. It was relatively easy for him to rant and rave\nabout how samurai &quot;act like women&quot; (what did he know about being a woman?\nNothing at all  &gt;:  ) from the comfort of his peaceful quarters. \n\nWhy did he excortiate the 47 Ako Ronin who avenged their lord? He claimed\nthat the Ako ronin should have commited mass seppuku rather than wait and\nplan to actually avenge their lord. It&#39;s quite easy to advocate mass seppuku\nwhen it is someone else -- never yourself -- facing such a situation. When\nyou have never have faced watching your lord be sentenced to seppuku, never\nfaced the prospects of being forced to leave your castle and fief behind to\nbe &quot;tossed by the waves&quot; (the literal meaning of &quot;ronin&quot;).\n\nThe world has been filled with various politicians and philosophers who talk\nabout facing death and being brave in battle -- when they have never faced\nthe situation themselves. HAGAKURE is one of the most over-rated,\nover-wrought works of alleged philosophy that exists. I&#39;d much rather read\nthe accounts of common soldiers or activists who actually know about what it\nis truly like to face death.\n\nJust my two mon here about this. \n \n\nNina            \n\n"
