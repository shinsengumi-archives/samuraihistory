It&#39;s based on \nmodern/western sensibilities to reach the conclusion that &quot;Nobunaga \nwas a villain&quot;. This philosophy really is not that popular \nin Japan.\n\nAs several people have noted, including the original poster, \n&quot;Nobunaga as villain&quot; is something you might see in computer or \nvideo cames coming out of Japan. It also exists in some other \n&quot;pop&quot; kinds of entertainment. \n\nBut in most Japanese sources, Nobunaga is not seen as a villain. His \nmore over-the-top things that in our day and age are quite shocking, \nwere even shocking when they happened. But the overall impression \nis not Nobunaga as villain, but for the most part, Nobunaga as \nheroic figure.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
