Today, however, about 40 employees at \nthe Fujinami Properties Co. handle them. Many of these props are \ngenuine articles - real swords, netsuke, tobacco pouches, hibachi \nand so forth. They are priceless not only because of their intrinsic \nvalue, but also because they have histories of being used by famous \nactors such as Danjuro, Kikugoro and Kichiemon.&quot;\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matthew E.
