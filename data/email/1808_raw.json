Bajutsu was \nthe art of horsemanship.  I believe it included riding, mounted \narchery, using horses in water, and a variety of other skills with \nhorses.  The other term is Yabusame.  It is the modern ,competative\n(it thik) form of mounted archery in which the participants are to \nfire blunted arrows at 3 consecutive targets at a full gallop.\n\n\n"
