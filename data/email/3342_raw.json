As you will see it =\r\nis not my native language.\n\nI am new to your group and I would like to ask =\r\nfor your support on the following matter.\nThe other day I had a discussion =\r\non the rules and restrictions the samurai faced in daily life concerning th=\r\ne use of swords. The guy I was talking to insisted on the idea, that they w=\r\nere forbidden by law to draw their swords, unless told to by their superior=\r\ns.\nMy point was that there were only resctrictions to the drawing of swords=\r\n on certain occasions like being at the shoguns palace or in the court. I g=\r\nuess there are many more times when it was forbidden but those are the poin=\r\nts that instantly came to my mind. I think that apart from that, there were=\r\n no laws that restricted the drawing or the use of the sword. One example h=\r\nere would be kirisute gomen. \nMy request to the members of this list would =\r\nbe to name any kind of source that proves my point as I don=B4t want to rel=\r\ny only on one or two sources I have at hand right now. I can use english, g=\r\nerman, french or japanese texts. Especially original sources or their moder=\r\nn day transcriptions would be great (i.e. osadamegaki, buke shohatto). Any =\r\nhelp will be appreciated. \nThank you very much for your time\nKarsten Helmho=\r\nlz\nGermany\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
