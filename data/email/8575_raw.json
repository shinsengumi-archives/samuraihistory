(Just thought I&#39;d get that in before Tony)\n\nThat aside, I=\r\n&#39;ve noticed that Japanese families have this concept of \na &quot;family curse&quot; t=\r\nhat I&#39;ve never seen in the US (except in movies), \nand have obsessions that=\r\n they are afflicted by it, and have thier \nlittle &quot;put the salt on the door=\r\n&quot; rituals to keep the evil spirits at \nbay. I&#39;ve seen it firsthand (the obs=\r\nessions, not the results).  Not \nmuch more to say, other than I don&#39;t think=\r\n family curses are real... \nat all, but that is my own possibly eccentric a=\r\nnd idiosyncratic \nopinion. To be cliche, the more you believe in it, the mo=\r\nre real it \nbecomes.\n\nI don&#39;t think John Edwards posts to the list, but som=\r\neone here more \nattuned to the supernatural might be able to help you out m=\r\nore than I.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Natalie&quot; &lt;robbins.s@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was born in Japan, Japanese mother, caucasian father.  My =\r\nmother \ntold \n&gt; me that her family history was samurai.  She also told me a=\r\nbout a \ncurse \n&gt; placed on her/our family for the many deaths caused by the=\r\nm.  I am \n&gt; curious to know if this was indeed true and if it was just our =\r\n\nfamily \n&gt; that was cursed or all samurai that was cursed.  I will be hones=\r\nt to \n&gt; say that the curse is still intact and still affects us.  I do not =\r\n\nwant \n&gt; to go into detail, but is it possible to end this suffering on our=\r\n \n&gt; family or is this something that will plague us forever?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
