There are several different plants \n=\r\nused to make one sort of tea or another. There are several different \ntea c=\r\neremonies before you even start talking about tea schools. The \nearliest ty=\r\npe of tea introduced to Japan was called dancha and is \npractically undrink=\r\nable. Or at least, it never became particularly \npopular. I suggest that yo=\r\nu read one of the introductory tea books. For \nexample, there is one in Eng=\r\nlish by Sen Shoshitsu. I believe that \nHerbert Plutschow has also written a=\r\n book about tea.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
