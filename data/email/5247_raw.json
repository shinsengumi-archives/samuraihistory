Japan history\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=156538833\r\n\r\n\n*Disclaimer* It&#39;s been 13 years since I studied Korean history.\n\n  The website seems to have 3 purposes. 1 to promote 1 person&#39;s (or small \ngroup&#39;s) interpretation of history. Lots of nit-picks on different \ninterpretations of events. Getting 2 historians from the same culture (much \nless historically hostile ones) to agree on anything historical is kind of \nlike herding cats anyway. 2 an attempt to denigrate all Japanese history \ntexts because Japan, while having owned up to some of the very negative \naspects of the Pacific war, has refused to simply roll over and paint \nthemselves as the demons many Koreans and Chinese believe they are. 3 Japan \nbashing in general.\n\n  I am not defending the revisionist tendencies that DO occur in Japan \ntextbooks. The Korean page is so obviously slanted in such an anti-japanese \nmanner it is hard to take any of it seriously. Most Japanese are very \ncognizant (sp?) of the many attrocities perpetrated by thier military in the \nPacific War. Teaching children that grandpa was a raping murdering demon is \nunacceptable regardless of the wishes of Korea and China.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
