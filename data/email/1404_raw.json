Oda Nobunaga had at least -- at LEAST -- two \n&gt; sisters.  (My \n&gt; &gt; guess is that there were more.)  One was Oichi-no-kata, married \nto \n&gt; Shibata \n&gt; &gt; Katsuie (twice) and Asai Nagamasa.  The other was married to \nTakeda \n&gt; &gt; Katsuyori.  Does anybody know what HER name was?  If she had \none?  \n&gt; As I said, \n&gt; &gt; just wondering.  I&#39;ve never seen a name or lifedates for her, \nonly \n&gt; that her \n&gt; &gt; husband died with the last of his clan at the hands of her \nbrother \n&gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; armies.  Or was she another of the unnamed women who were \n&gt; tragically used \n&gt; &gt; solely for strategic purposes?  Thanks again!
