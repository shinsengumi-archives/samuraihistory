Again, the ruthless Nobunaga is an exemplar:\n&gt; http://www2.aia.pref.a=\r\nichi.jp/voice/no11/11_time_travelar.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nWell, in=\r\ntoning a scene from &quot;Atsumori&quot; really doesn&#39;t fit any real\nconcept of &quot;danc=\r\ning&quot;, it&#39;s sort of &quot;poetic drama&quot;, and he was probably\nusing the theme of a=\r\ntsumori to admit his mortality (lots of discussion\nbetween a priest and dea=\r\nd warriors). And so it wouldn&#39;t have been for\n&quot;entertainment&quot;. Probably mor=\r\ne of an &quot;eat, drink, and be merry, for\ntomorrow we all shall die&quot; type stat=\r\nement, minus the drinking and\nmerryment.\n\n\n\n"
