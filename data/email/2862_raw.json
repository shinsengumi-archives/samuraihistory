I distinctly remember learning of a battle between samurai \nusing swords and samurai/soldiers using guns.  The point was clear \nthat the army using guns won the battle.  Does anyone know the name \nof this battle?  I think it is the basis and thus loosely related to \nthe Last Samurai movie.\n\nChuck\n\n\n\n"
