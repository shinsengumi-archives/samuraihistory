I probably should not have quoted =\r\nthis thread as I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; asking about guns per se, but specifically gunpow=\r\nder and the printing press\n&gt; and generally about the development of technol=\r\nogy in Asia.  By the time\n&gt; Japan adopted the use of flintlocks, the Chines=\r\ne already had cannons,\n&gt; grenades, and significant development in the use o=\r\nf gunpowder. I do not see\n&gt; where any development of uses for gunpowder occ=\r\nurred until after the arrival\n&gt; of the Portuguese.  More importantly, the a=\r\nrrival of the printing press\n&gt; appears to be equally disdained..  While the=\r\n Chinese were printing books,\n&gt; Japan still preferred writing?  I believe t=\r\nhere are examples in textile\n&gt; production and architecture as well, where s=\r\nignificant advances were not\n&gt; readily adopted.  Just curious if there migh=\r\nt be an explanation or just an\n&gt; oddity of history.  I can&#39;t find similar e=\r\nxamples in Western history. In the\n&gt; West, technology moves from country to=\r\n country like wildfire, with everyone\n&gt; claiming they invented it..\n&gt; \n&gt; -d=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Ride wanted, off planet.

But in a nutshell, yes, guns did a=\r\nrrive in Japan before the\n&gt; &gt; 16th century from China/Korea - just not in s=\r\nufficient numbers to build an\n&gt; &gt; arsenal, or they were thought of as &quot;curi=\r\nosities&quot; and not produced in Japan.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Dennis Sheridan &lt;ldsheridan@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Chinese di=\r\nscovered gunpowder in the 9th century. Do I understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correctly that=\r\n the Japanese did not acquire this technology until the mid\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 16th cent=\r\nury with Portuguese guns? (The route would be from China to\n&gt; &gt; Arabia\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; to Europe and from there all the way back to Japan.. This is not at all\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; intuitive.) Similarly, the Chinese had movable type and a crude printi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; press (via India) by the mid 11th c., the Koreans the same 3 centu=\r\nries\n&gt; &gt; later\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and apparently the Japanese even later than that. Give=\r\nn the geographical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; juxtaposition, the treaties, diplomatic missions, =\r\nthe trade, and\n&gt; &gt; countless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other factors, I am completely mystified=\r\n that a technological advance by\n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; country would not be almost =\r\nimmediately adopted by the other two.
