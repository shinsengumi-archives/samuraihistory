I was hoping that you had experienced the\npurpose of the ceremony regarding the beautiful sound of the bowl.\n    If you have any idea or maybe know of someone who does I would love to\nknow.I can send you a photo if you&#39;d like.\n            I Thank You so very much for your time and look forward to\nhearing from you.\n                         Once again Thank You,     Sincerely  Holly Lange\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
