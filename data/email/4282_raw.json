He was \nunavailable and a friend of his was asked to confirm the name that \nshould be used on the certificate. The friend misremembered the name \nand gave the father&#39;s name instead: &quot;Saigo Takamori&quot;. This was \nprobably due to the fact that given names were hardly used. If a \n&quot;name&quot; was used at all (instead of a title) it was probably a \nnickname. Saigo&#39;s nickname was &quot;Kichi-no-suke&quot;.\n\nWhen Saigo got the (incorrect) certificate, he apparently just went \nwith the flow and from then on used &quot;Takamori&quot; instead of his given \nname, Takanaga.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
