Although the story=\r\n in the film is significantly different from \nwhat actually transpired in 1=\r\n877, I found a few themes to be common. \nFirst, the origin of the Satsuma r=\r\nebellion was in the dissatisfaction \nof the samurai at the ending of their =\r\nway of life. Secondly, as with \nKen Watanabe in the movie, Saigo Takamori d=\r\nid indeed have deep \nrespect for the emperor. Finally, the failure of Saigo=\r\n&#39;s rebellion \nwas partially due to the fact that he was fighting in an old =\r\nJapanese \nstyle, while the Meiji government had westernized their methods. =\r\n\nHowever, it was not really western weapons versus Japanese weapons on \nthe=\r\n battlefields of the Satsuma rebellion, since both sides used \nguns. Rather=\r\n, the Meiji government made much better use of western-\nstyle logistics (re=\r\ninforcements) and communications (the telegraph). \nThe Meiji government was=\r\n able to get Saigo bogged down in Kumamoto, \nwhile they sent in reinforceme=\r\nnts and eventually overwhelmed him at \nTabaru-zaka.\n\nJoe\n\n--- In samuraihis=\r\ntory@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , jonathan e=\r\nllgen &lt;jpellgen@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree there were historical mistakes, bu=\r\nt it was a movie and not \nintended to be a documentary or re-enactment. I w=\r\nas actually quite \npleased with the film despite its short-comings. I felt =\r\nthat it \ncaptured several powerful emotions which may have been present at =\r\n\nthose last moments of samurai existence. \n&gt; \n&gt; But some of the things you =\r\nmentioned really don&#39;t bother me. For \nexample, the suggestion that an outs=\r\nider would be taken in the way \nTom Cruise&#39;s character was... That is obvio=\r\nusly part of what makes \nthe story interesting, not particularly anything h=\r\nistorical. We know \nthat William Adams was taken in, as you alluded too, bu=\r\nt that hardly \nwould make it a common thing. As far as seppuku is concerned=\r\n, there \nwas really no end to what type of bladed instrument a samurai migh=\r\nt \nhave used. \n&gt; \n&gt; So, while I agree that it isn&#39;t the best source of hist=\r\norical \ninformation, I still found it to be acceptable from an entertainmen=\r\nt \npoint of view. Film is a much more widely accepted form of media than \na=\r\nnime, and I am fairly confident that more English-speaking people \nwere wil=\r\nling to watch Tom Cruise than watch Japanimation. Cruise&#39;s \ncharacter was, =\r\nafterall, a civil war captain... Not necessarily a \nsamurai. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jonathan=\r\n P.
