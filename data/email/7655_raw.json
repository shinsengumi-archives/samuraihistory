Anyway, regarding the Will Adams\nFestival.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a one day event run by Medway Council in\nGillingham, Kent on\n&gt; Saturday the 17th September 2005. It starts at 10:45\nand goes on until\n&gt; circa 17:00. Activities are centred upon the Black\nLion Leisure Centre\n&gt; and Gillingham&#39;s High Street (just to the south).\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry to say that the folks at Medway still haven&#39;t\nset up a dedicated\n&gt; website for the event. And even if you Google, you\nstill tend only to\n&gt; get references to just past events created by\nattendees. It is so badly\n&gt; promoted that outside of its local area, no one has\never heard of it,\n&gt; neither Stephen Turnbull, or Ian Bottomley or the\nrest of the crew at\n&gt; Leeds were aware of the event when I mentioned it\nduring the recent\n&gt; Shogun exhibition, and it&#39;s been going for five\nyears! Indeed I didn&#39;t\n&gt; find out about it myself until last year, and it was\nI who had first\n&gt; approached them back in &#39;99 to suggest it for the\nyear 2000 and the\n&gt; 400th anniversary of Adam&#39;s arrival in Japan.\nIncidentally I&#39;ve just\n&gt; found out that even the Japanese Embassy now has it\nlisted as a &quot;new&quot;\n&gt; event for 2005.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s numerous demonstrations and displays, food,\nmusic etc. both in\n&gt; and out of doors. I and a handful of my group will\nbe putting on a small\n&gt; display, so if you manage to get along to it, come\nand say hi at the\n&gt; Fight School&#39;s &quot;SHOGUN&quot; stand, just look for a\nJINMAKU (camp curtain)\n&gt; and a collection of banners near the Leisure Centre.\n&gt;\n&gt; For further information contact either:\n&gt;\n&gt; Medway Visitor Centre, 95 High Street, Rochester,\nKent, ME1 1LX.\n&gt; Email: visitor.centre@...\n&gt; Telephone: 01634 843666\n&gt; Fax: 01634 847891\n&gt; Minicom: 01634 333111\n&gt;\n&gt; OR\n&gt;\n&gt; The Black Lion Leisure Centre, Mill Road,\nGillingham, Kent, ME7 1HF.\n&gt; Email: blacklion@...\n&gt; Telephone: 01634 283700\n&gt;  Minicom: 01634 333111\n&gt;\n&gt; To find the Centre via Multimap.com go here:\n&gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&search_result=&db=p\n&gt;\nc&cidr_client=none&lang=&pc=ME71HF&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicks\n&gt; earch=ME7+1HF&addr3=&addr1=\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope some of you find this useful and fun.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt; Head Of The Fight School\n&gt; http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
