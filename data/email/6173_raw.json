As for English not being your native\n&gt; language--YOU are the one that all these other people\n&gt; must be learning to hate. Your writing skills were\n&gt; QUITE good--if it&#39;s not your native language, then\n&gt; THEY have no excuse. WELCOME!!!! (and so that we know,\n&gt; what is your native language?) \n\n My native language is romanian. I am from Romania, and please don&#39;t \nstart with the Dracula stuff, because I hate Bram Stoker. It did \nwonders for our Travelling Industry, but it crippled our history...:(\n\n&gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/kanji/nengo.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; That only begins in year 1201, but does give the kanji\n&gt; for each period, and the alternate periods. I&#39;ll see\n&gt; if I can dig up anything prior to that. As for\n&gt; changing the period name, it was the Emperor who did\n&gt; that--not the daimyo, Shogun, or any military person.\n&gt; Someone else may have &quot;suggested&quot; to the Emperor that\n&gt; it would be a good time for a name change, but it was\n&gt; the Emperor who actually did it. Reasons for changing\n&gt; included a portentous sign, a natural disaster, a\n&gt; particularly good event, or just because they&#39;d gone\n&gt; long enough. \n\n Thank you for the information, it&#39;s good to know things as they \nwere. About that site, I wish I had a sword, so that I could properly \nuse it by reading what is signed on it...no, no, don&#39;t fear, I don&#39;t \nintend to ask for information about purchasing a katana and about \nthe &quot;Samurai Way of the Sword&quot; & Stuff  :)). I like the site, \nthough...\n\n By the way, if you get to check out EDICT, maybe you can find out \nhow to search for expressions, because I couldn&#39;t. Even if I \nselect &quot;full regular expression&quot;, it concatenates my words into a \nsingle one, which, of course, the server can&#39;t understand. This is \nthe exact link of one of the mirrors:\n\n http://www.df.lth.se/cgi-bin/j-e/dict\n\n Other than that, thank you for your time and I hope we get to chat \nsome more.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGabriel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
