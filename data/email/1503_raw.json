I can tell that guy didn&#39;t \nlike it, and I think he sees Kurasawa as god, at least he acts like \nit.  One thing I can see that shows that he didnt give it chance when \nhe mentions that Kagetora is waiting or 6 days for troops from a \ncastle that is a 2 day ride.  It doesn&#39;t seem to take much thought to \nme to see this as possible.  2 days for meengers to arrive, time to \nmobilize the garrison, and then 2 days back, and the almost \ninvetiable delays in the actual travel.  Just something that has been \non my mind and wanted to speak my peace. \n\n\n\n"
