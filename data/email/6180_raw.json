Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you&#39;re not a &quot;ringer&quot; posting from middle Ohio?  You made me look up &quot;concatenates.&quot;  I think I heard the word used ONCE back in 1992.  \n\nTo the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be wrong, but my ex-wife&#39;s aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have no idea how it is spelled, since I have never ever seen it in print) told me that the great sword makers had stopped making katanas and moved into making kitchen knives, since that&#39;s where the money is.  Now, I can see perhaps where it would be extra handy to have a ginsu knife for chopping garlic instead of your trusty katana, but maybe that&#39;s just me.  Some of you might enjoy the garlic chopping with a larger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged if you do, since that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there any truth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there, just making steak knives for Williams Sonoma?  (Incidentally, the ex and myself are on excellent terms, so no need to fear for my safety.  Thank you for your concern.)\n\nYour most obedient,\n\nMatt\n\nDodu Gabriel &lt;dodu_gabriel@...&gt; wrote:\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Newbies are welcome unless they make themselves\n&gt; unwelcome. As for English not being your native\n&gt; language--YOU are the one that all these other people\n&gt; must be learning to hate. Your writing skills were\n&gt; QUITE good--if it&#39;s not your native language, then\n&gt; THEY have no excuse. WELCOME!!!! (and so that we know,\n&gt; what is your native language?) \n\nMy native language is romanian. I am from Romania, and please don&#39;t \nstart with the Dracula stuff, because I hate Bram Stoker. It did \nwonders for our Travelling Industry, but it crippled our history...:(\n\n&gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/kanji/nengo.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; That only begins in year 1201, but does give the kanji\n&gt; for each period, and the alternate periods. I&#39;ll see\n&gt; if I can dig up anything prior to that. As for\n&gt; changing the period name, it was the Emperor who did\n&gt; that--not the daimyo, Shogun, or any military person.\n&gt; Someone else may have &quot;suggested&quot; to the Emperor that\n&gt; it would be a good time for a name change, but it was\n&gt; the Emperor who actually did it. Reasons for changing\n&gt; included a portentous sign, a natural disaster, a\n&gt; particularly good event, or just because they&#39;d gone\n&gt; long enough. \n\nThank you for the information, it&#39;s good to know things as they \nwere. About that site, I wish I had a sword, so that I could properly \nuse it by reading what is signed on it...no, no, don&#39;t fear, I don&#39;t \nintend to ask for information about purchasing a katana and about \nthe &quot;Samurai Way of the Sword&quot; & Stuff  :)). I like the site, \nthough...\n\nBy the way, if you get to check out EDICT, maybe you can find out \nhow to search for expressions, because I couldn&#39;t. Even if I \nselect &quot;full regular expression&quot;, it concatenates my words into a \nsingle one, which, of course, the server can&#39;t understand. This is \nthe exact link of one of the mirrors:\n\nhttp://www.df.lth.se/cgi-bin/j-e/dict\n\nOther than that, thank you for your time and I hope we get to chat \nsome more.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGabriel\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
