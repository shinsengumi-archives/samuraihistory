I guess  the tri=\r\nck is never to see any particular version as being &quot;gospel&quot;, because  altho=\r\nugh facts are incontrovertible, the ability to discern facts from slightly =\r\naltered facts, from fiction, from propaganda (and disinformation) is way ou=\r\nt of my field of expertise!  Looking at the story of just one of the 47 ron=\r\nin, for example, compared to huge story of the Tokugawa shogunate, how coul=\r\nd I insist that one episode is more important than another, or more interes=\r\nting, or offers the world more in either sociological education or simple e=\r\nntertainment?  Personally, I love all of it, although some eras fascinate m=\r\ne more than others. I think it&#39;s important to see chambara films for what t=\r\nhey are: magnificent pieces of entertainment about fascinating periods in h=\r\nistory, tempered by the personal opinions and experiences of the writers an=\r\nd directors.  If we do that, though, shouldn&#39;t we also do the same for a gr=\r\neat deal of accepted history which may have been written by one or other si=\r\nde&#39;s faction?  Is it so important to &quot;know&quot; something for an absolute certa=\r\ninty, or is it better to FEEl somthing for a pretty close bet?\n\nI&#39;d love to=\r\n know your opinion on this!\n Do we study\n&gt; history as grand themes and tend=\r\nencies? Or study the lives of\n&gt; individuals?\n&gt; Do we study just the lives o=\r\nf influential individuals (i.e.Nobunaga,\n&gt; Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu)? Or =\r\ntry and look at the lives of ordinary\n&gt; people, in whatever ways we may? Or=\r\n all of the above?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina\n&gt; _____\n&gt; \n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\n&gt; [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of onnagozen\n&gt; Se=\r\nnt: Friday, September 02, 2005 8:50 AM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com=\r\n\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Our &quot;welcoming&quot; attitude\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [snips=\r\n in a very incisive, interesting post]\n&gt; \n&gt; By the time the film was made t=\r\nhere were no samurai, yet\n&gt; it almost feels like the film-maker was making =\r\na propaganda movie\n&gt; against the feudal era and its practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Sa=\r\nmurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: h=\r\nttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; =\r\nSamurai swords Samurai part\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; YAHOO!
