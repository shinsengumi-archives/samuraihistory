Several years after the \n&gt; death of Musashi was wrote a compilation with the testimonies of the \n&gt; witnesses of this event. The book was called &quot;Niten-Ki&quot;, the first \n&gt; biography of Musashi. In the book one of the chapters had a info about \n&gt; Musashi, accord this text he had both swords in the duel.\n&gt; \n&gt; He left the Daito in the boat and took the Shoto and the Suburito with \n&gt; him.  In the fight he just used the Suburito.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a resume of  this book but in spanish and my english is bad.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Helly\n\nDid Musashi invent the suburito or it already existed long before \nmusashi was born?\n\nTotok Sudarijanto\nhttp://www.mjer.org\nemail: totok.sudarijanto@...\n\n&quot;The ultimate aim of martial arts is not having to use them.&quot;\n\n\n\n"
