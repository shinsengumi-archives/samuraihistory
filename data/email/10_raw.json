The ladied of daimyo were compelled to stay in Edo as a kind \nof hostages. The Edo shogunate was very nervous of the tendency of the western counries and paid close \nattention to taking guns for rebelling against it into Edo and to leaking out secret information of the shogunate \nthrough forge women travellers of the western daimyo.\n  \nThe Ooi River waited for those travellers who successfully passed through the checkpoint of Hakone.\n\nThe shogunate intentionally didn&#39;t construct any bridge across the Ooi River in order to prevent the western \narmies from advancing into Edo. The melting snow on the Mt. Fuji or heavy rains sometimes caused a sudden \nrise in the River. At that time, travellers inevitably put up at inns in Mishima (in Shizuoka prefecture at present) \nalong the River.\n\nIn those days, as a post town, very prosperous was Mishima where there were many &quot;geisha&quot; who came from \nEdo or other districts.&quot;\n\nFor your delectation - Tom\n\n\n\n\n"
