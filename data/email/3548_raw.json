Do you think it would \n&gt; be possible to do, and is there enough information out there to make \n&gt; credible, an ALTERNATE-HISTORY romance from the Sengoku period involving Oda&#39;s sister \n&gt; that was married to Shibata and Asai?  Thanks for the info on Toyotomi, Oda \n&gt; and Tokugawa, too!!!!!!  8-D  Take care.\n\nHm.\n\nI don&#39;t see why not. Given the theory of the &quot;butterfly effect&quot; you can take off \nhistory at almost any given point and see where you can go. That one certainly \nwould work.\n\nI used to toy with writing an alternate history wherein Perry&#39;s flagship sank on \nthe way to Japan, and it was a few decades before a formal opening. By then, the \nshogunate was in a different place (structurally) and not as weak, thus it never \nfell; and since Japan opened to the west later, it developed armies and navies \nlater and thus never fought the Russo Japanese war (thus Nikolas II&#39;s position \nwasn&#39;t as weakened, and the Bolshevik revolution failed) and...\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
