I&#39;m a little\n&gt; skeptical--it sounds like something out of Martial\n&gt; Arts=\r\n Illustrated or something. Most images of samurai\n&gt; you see preparing for a=\r\n battle or a duel have their\n&gt; hakama tied back with leggings to keep them =\r\nout of the\n&gt; way (assuming they aren&#39;t in armor, which would keep\n&gt; the clo=\r\nthing out of the way by definition.) Kobakama,\n&gt; or shorter, tighter hakama=\r\n, were frequently worn when\n&gt; &quot;expecting action&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Were hakama worn excl=\r\nusively by the samurai class,\n&gt; then maybe I could see your answer making s=\r\nense. But\n&gt; how would that explain nagabakama, worn by courtiers\n&gt; and samu=\r\nrai during court functions? I&#39;m no clothing\n&gt; historian, but I know we&#39;ve g=\r\not some here. Tony? Lady\n&gt; Solveig? Care to enlighten us further?\n&gt;\n&gt; Of co=\r\nurse, I could just look at Tony&#39;s website:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.sengokudaimyo.com=\r\n/garb/garb.html\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hakama worn by commoners and laborers in Heian were\n&gt; =\r\ntwo panel, and typically only reached to the mid-calf\n&gt; or a bit lower. Dur=\r\ning the sixteenth century,\n&gt; low-class warriors often wore a knee-length tw=\r\no- or\n&gt; three-panel hakama which were sometimes called\n&gt; kobakama, a termin=\r\nology problem as regular hakama were\n&gt; also called kobakama in the Edo peri=\r\nod owing to the\n&gt; formal nagabakama being the =93formal=94 norm.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If ha=\r\nkama were being worn by commoners and laborers,\n&gt; then I hardly think a cri=\r\ntical part of their design\n&gt; would be to hide the movement of the legs from=\r\n an\n&gt; opponent.\n&gt;\n&gt; Continuing:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Earlier hakama, unlike modern martial =\r\narts hakama,\n&gt; had two clearly defined legs, rather than having the\n&gt; pleat=\r\ns overlapping left and right so that one can=92t\n&gt; tell where one leg ends =\r\nand the other begins. Another\n&gt; modern feature is the koshita, the solid pa=\r\nnel at the\n&gt; small of the back. This seems to have appeared\n&gt; sometime in t=\r\nhe early Edo period or at the earliest in\n&gt; the very late days of the sixte=\r\nenth century, as\n&gt; earlier hakama were merely cut straight across the\n&gt; bac=\r\nk as at the front.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If these things were developed in the Edo period, a=\r\nnd\n&gt; hakama were being worn in the Heian period, then they\n&gt; could hardly b=\r\ne part of the development of hakama.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d still like to see what Tony an=\r\nd others have to\n&gt; say.\n\n\nThanks Nate, thats a lot of info it will really h=\r\nelp.\n\n\n"
