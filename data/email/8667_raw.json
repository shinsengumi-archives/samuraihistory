I found a copy at Maruzen Sendai\n&gt;on my recent trip back to the land of the Rising Yen. I read it on the\n&gt;return flight and was very impressed. We all MUST have this. It is truly\n&gt;very good, very clear and readable, and handsomely produced. In fact, I\n&gt;have been meaning to post some comments about the volume on this list, but\n&gt;you know how best intentions are. I also am writing this without the book\n&gt;in front of me - since you brought it up - so I won&#39;t be able to give\n&gt;chapter and verse, but...\n&gt;       The book covers the polishing process and explains the role and use\n&gt;of the sequence of stones etc. It also covers the design of the polishers\n&gt;work station - even allowing for some adjustments that OSHA might approve\n&gt;and traditionalists abhor! It has good treatments of the styles and kinds\n&gt;of polish that are the best I&#39;ve ever read. There is also a good section on\n&gt;how bends and twists are handled.\n&gt;       Having said all those nice things, there are 3 issues that I \n&gt;remember\n&gt;thinking were under treated. First, I would have like more on the nature\n&gt;and origin of the various stones. There is not even a description of how\n&gt;they are marketed and where they can be bought. Second, I felt that shape\n&gt;is addressed too briefly. There is also nothing (really) about how the\n&gt;polisher can, should and might deal with ji-niku. This is the issue that\n&gt;has been claimed by experts as the variable that anyone but experts can\n&gt;screw-up. Yet in this book, it is not addressed. I think the term is\n&gt;defined, but there is no description. Finally, the whole issue of kizu and\n&gt;kizu control is ignored. Again, I think there might be a definition in the\n&gt;glossary, but the text says NOTHING about how a polisher deals with flaws.\n&gt;We all know that a polisher can enhance weak hamon and flatten fukure, but\n&gt;nothing is said about that kind of work or issues like hako-bori removal.\n&gt;Maybe those &quot;secrets&quot; are too valuable to publish.\n&gt;       This is a book for sword collectors and we all need it. I don&#39;t see\n&gt;it as anywhere close to a &quot;how-to book&quot;. I assume that some people will try\n&gt;to use it in that way, but it is primarily a description of the craft of\n&gt;polishing. When it does show up on this side of the Pacific, you will find\n&gt;enjoy it.\n&gt;Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Peter Bleed\n&gt;Professor of Anthropology\n&gt;810 Oldfather Hall\n&gt;University of Nebraska\n&gt;Lincoln, NE 68588-0368\n&gt;(402) 472-2439\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
