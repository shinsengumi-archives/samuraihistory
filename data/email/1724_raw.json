And why so slight curvature in a 17th\n&gt;century blade ?=\r\n\n\nNo but it would if the sword were suriage,\nwhich is how it appears to my =\r\neye, this would reduce\nthe sori as well. Remembering that in the 1660&#39;s\na s=\r\nhallow curve was en vogue.\n\n&gt;It resemble to me no &#39;&#39;black color&#39;&#39; rust in t=\r\nhe tang but it may be due\n&gt;to the flash light surely used to take the photo=\r\ns. The handle is rather\n&gt;long, suggesting a possible ancestral blade, but..=\r\n. also the signature\n&gt;seems to me too much well preserved for having 300 ye=\r\nars,\n\nI have seen older blades that looked new,\nwith surprisingly little ru=\r\nst for all their years.\nA custom handle may indicate an older blade or just=\r\n the preference of \nthe swordsman..\n\n&gt;as the sharp\n&gt;angles of the tang and =\r\nmekugi-ana. Sharpness may be explained with a\n&gt;borders re-shaping (saving t=\r\nhe signature) to fit with the kyugunto\n&gt;mounting\n\nmay have been altered to =\r\nfit the gunto mounts true\n\n&gt;but I am still not able to see filemarks, wheth=\r\ner the kanji are\n&gt;rather good visible. Without jihada, boshi and a closer i=\r\nmage of at\n&gt;least little part of the hamon is hard to determine the school.=\r\n If this\n&gt;patterns do not match with the signature ?\n\nYes correct kantei di=\r\nctates that the signature confirms what you see \nin the blade. This is why =\r\nI asked for pics of the kissaki and \nmonouchi.\n\n&gt;May be a new swordsmith si=\r\ngnature of later time? Because effectively, if\n&gt;old, is hard to think of a =\r\nfake with such a signature, but nowadays some\n&gt;fakers make the same reasoni=\r\nng.\n\nGranted but fakers want to sell swords, faking an obscure signature \nm=\r\nay throw off the wary but would hardly bring enough money to be \nworth the =\r\ntrouble. The Meikan is a listing of over 20,000 smiths \nincluding gendai, i=\r\nf there is a later smith with this signature he \nwould turn up here. Althou=\r\ngh Banshu (Harima) did not exist after 1870 \nor so, thus it would be very u=\r\nnlikely to turn up in a gendai sig.\n\tAgain I ask Scott, what does his trans=\r\nlation say, and can he \nbe so kind as to provide more pics. As you say we n=\r\need to kantei the \nsword and not the koshirae.\n  -t\n\n&gt;Honestly, signature i=\r\ns the last thing I see to, while here we have to\n&gt;work with it as the first=\r\n step. And to be sincere, I was not able to\n&gt;read it as good as you have ma=\r\nde. I have thinked about the little label\n&gt;:\n&gt;surrenders swords had such a =\r\nlebel to make it easy to give back\n&gt;(eventually...) the blade to the former=\r\nly owner, and this may suggest\n&gt;the blade was of a certain interest.\n&gt;But t=\r\nhis is not a rule in kantei (fakes of surrenders blade with\n&gt;&#39;&#39;dedications&#39;=\r\n&#39; have a their own market...). If Scott would see at the\n&gt;back of the handl=\r\ne and other details comparing it to the description\n&gt;shown in the part of t=\r\nhe article I have posted, may be we can argue if\n&gt;the mounting was intended=\r\n for a High officer, enforcing the &#39;&#39;ancestral\n&gt;blade&#39;&#39; theory.\n&gt;By the way=\r\n, Gen. Yamashita&#39;s sword was of the same period...\n&gt;Please have no trouble =\r\nto refute my suggestions as I&#39;m taking this as a\n&gt;learning session, with a =\r\nlot of fun.  \n&gt;Thanks for your time.\n&gt;Carlo\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Messaggio originale----=\r\n-\n&gt;Da: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@...]\n&gt;Inviato: mercoled=EC 7 mag=\r\ngio 2003 9.06\n&gt;A: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Oggetto: Re: R: [samuraih=\r\nistory] History of a Sword\n&gt;\n&gt;Carlo-\n&gt;       Scott has the translation so h=\r\ne can easily straighten us out\n&gt;and the mountings are clearly wartime produ=\r\nction. Without further\n&gt;info though, I stand by my translation. The Nihonto=\r\n Meikan lists five\n&gt;Katsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one who signed in=\r\n this manner.\n&gt;The shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sengo Masashi=\r\nge.\n&gt;Masashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa. Banshu Katsuyoshi\n&gt;w=\r\nas originally from the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and worked around the\n&gt;Tenna =\r\nera (1681-1683).\n&gt;       One would expect to see some characteristics of th=\r\ne Sengo\n&gt;school in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and monouchi are\n&gt;im=\r\nportant. I agree no final determination can be made without sword\n&gt;in hand,=\r\n but I would posit that a faker or &#39;tribute&#39; sword would\n&gt;hardly choose to =\r\ncopy the work of a late generation smith from a\n&gt;little known line.\n&gt;Tom\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai A=\r\nrchives: \n&gt;&lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com=\r\n\n&gt;---\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;samuraihistory-un=\r\nsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
