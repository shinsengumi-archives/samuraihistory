It wasn&#39;t until the Edo\nperiod that you see people walking around in public in their underwear\n(kosode/kimono). People of breeding or just desirous of not coming across as\na total scum wore something OVER their kimono until the 1600s, whether a\nkataginu (a sideless vest) or a dobuku (the forerunner of the haori).\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n"
