I feel like its a part of me that needs attention just like a close realative. I believe that my sword is as strong as me and it can match my capabilities if need be. It may not be all that to any one else but it smells good and mackeral or wonderfull I view my swords as a lot more than just tools.

Swords can be cool as long as\n&gt; you don&#39;t get all freaky.\n&gt;       Nate\n&gt;             Hey now, Nate.  Swords are very cool indeed, and\n&gt; since they&#39;ve kept me\n&gt; fascinated and actively growing for the past\n&gt; forty-odd years, I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; whether I resemble that &quot;all freaky&quot; remark or not. \n&gt; ...I feel so insulted.\n\nDo you imbue your sword with some kind of mystic\ndogma? Do you believe that once drawn a sword has to\nbe used, or it will implode? Do you really think that\npiece of steel is your soul? \n\nAs long as you answered &quot;no&quot; to these, you&#39;re not a\nfreak. \n\n&gt; How to handle this sense of wounded dignity in a\n&gt; mature and rational\n&gt; manner - ha!  Got it!\n&gt; Nate, we&#39;re going to have to have a duel.\n&gt;       Gereg\n\nOnly if I get to choose weapons. \n\nI choose Main Battle Tank. Mine&#39;s an M1A2--yours?\n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
