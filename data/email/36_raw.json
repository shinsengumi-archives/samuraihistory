I am a new member of this \ngroup, so I would like to say nice to meet you to all the members and wish a \nmerry christmas and happy new year. I am a brazilian lawyer who love Samurai \nCulture and history and along my 61 years of age I have been reading about \nsuch involving culture that I love.\nIt is a pleasure to be in touch with other people that enjoy getting to know \nmore and more about the Samurais and their history! There is a very \ninteresting book about Bushido that I would like to recommend you highly. It \nis published in Spain and its title is &quot; Zen y Artes Marciales&quot; (Zen and \nMarcial Arts) The writer is Taisen Deshimaru a master in Zen. Luiz Cï¿½rcamo \nEditor. San Raimundo, 58 - Madrid. This is one of the books I like the most \nabout Zen and Marcial Arts. I know that there is a french edition, but I am \nnot quite sure if there is an english edition yet.\nI have just read the new biography written about Miyamoto Musashi that has \nsome information about &quot;Bo-jutsu&quot;.\nI like Bo-jutsu and I would like to receive some information about the \nwooden bastons, its size and interesting information about this art!\nso, once more nice to meet you!\nI am sorry for my poor english\nbest wishes.\nAntenor C. Penteado\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"
