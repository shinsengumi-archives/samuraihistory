Williams&quot; &lt;amacobra@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nMr. Wilson,\n\n  The katana does not need to be worn ha (blade) down in order to cut on the \ndraw, this would actually be a bad thing to do.  The sword styles that fall \nunder the influence of Iaido/jutsu and battoudo/jutsu wear the katana ha up \nand base their main premise on a simultaneous draw and cut, called battou.  \nThe construction of the saya (sheath) for most katana is of wood and if the \nkatana was drawn ha down it would split the saya and cut open the users \nhand.  The metalic construction and/or reinforcement of the tachi saya \nallowed for that blade to be drawn ha downward.\n  I hope this was helped somehow.\n\n\nMatt Williams\n\n\n&gt;Message: 7\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 19 Nov 2003 10:31:08 -0500\n&gt;    From: &quot;Josh Wilson&quot; &lt;lordwilson@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: TACHI\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, the tachi can be used in fights.. it was originally developed as a \n&gt;cavalry sword.. the longer blade and more pronounced curve were designed to \n&gt;be used form horseback.. much like the western examples of a saber in \n&gt;comparisson to the rapier.. the tachi was worn blade down whereas the \n&gt;katana was worn blade up.. the difference was that when you drew the tachi \n&gt;from horseback, the first draw would be a slice.. and the katana&#39;s first \n&gt;draw would be a slice as well, if worn blade down.. as far as dates, it \n&gt;seems that the tachi may be a predeccessor to the katana, but I am NOT \n&gt;sure..\n&gt;\n&gt;Wilson\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIs there a gadget-lover on your gift list?
