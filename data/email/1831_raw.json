No thats more like Karl the 12th.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nPossibly this is a nickname that only appears in English sources, see \n&quot;The Dawn of Modern Warfare&quot;, West Point Military History Series. I \ndon&#39;t know anything about Karl the 12th, but Gustavus was king in the \n1630&#39;s during the 30 years war.\n\n&gt;&gt;Time to crack the books again ;) I know from personal experience that \n&gt;&gt;NONE of the juicy bits of history are taught in most grade schools.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Not in Sweden, they teach it with a fair deal of gore and slaying to\n&gt;keep the class intrested.\n&gt;\nLucky dogs! American schools frankly teach very little history and don&#39;t \ndo a very good job about what little they teach.\n\n&gt;Fantastic Fact: Sweden is the only country in the world (to my\n&gt;knowledge) that has actually managed to conqer Russia, and Moscow. \n&gt;\nThe French did the same, with the same results.\n\n&gt;The Japanese military didnt evolv at all untill the meji revolution.\n&gt;Kinda stagnant for 400 years...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nKind of my point with comparing the Tokugawa forces with armies of the \n30 years war in Europe. Mobile artillery would be a very bad surprise. \nOf course it gets even worse as time passes.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Matthew E. Hoyle&quot; &lt;matthewhoyle@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Does anyone know why the Mongols tried to invade Japan ? They must have\n&gt;had a good reason as they tried twice in the late 13th cent ? \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI know the jidai-geki answer (historical soap opera). They refused to \nsubmit to the Khan and I think the Khan wanted to kill off some Korean \nconscripts as well as drain Korea of money so Korea (Korai sp?) would be \nless troublesome to rule. I&#39;m not really sure if Japan really had any \nother importance other than as a method to drain subject states of \nexcessive manpower.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
