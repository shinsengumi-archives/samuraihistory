It was recently updated, and has some  nice photographs as well. Although it cover many Japanese samurai  films, it also deals with some western films. \n  \n  I would also recommend the Akira Kurosawa documentary which can be  found on DVD. No worries for non-Japanese speakers--it is done in  English. \n  \n  You may also want to look into adaptations of Kurosawa movies which  were mostly &#39;western&#39; western films. For example... &#39;The Magnificent  Seven.&#39; I&#39;m not sure it would fit into what you are trying to do, but  it might be a unique angle.\n  \n  Jonathan\n\nKitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:          --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;foxfoil&quot; &lt;foxfoil@g...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; hello there.\n  &gt; im new to this forum.\n  &gt; im currently a student in mordern japanese studies, and being a big\n  fan of movies, i have \n  &gt; decided to write my dissertaiton on how samurai culture is beeing\n  depicted in hollywood \n  &gt; cinema. concentrating on film as history, which elements are left\n  out, why and what are the \n  &gt; concequences.\n  &gt; film wise i plan to look at ghostdog, kill bill, and the last\n  samurai but any other films are very \n  &gt; welcome.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; my question is, what are your opinion on the subject?, do you have\n  any books you can \n  &gt; recommend. In short, any information that could be useful.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; thank you very much.\n  &gt;\n  \n  For starters, you would want to call it the &quot;modern MISCONCEPTION of\n  Samurai culture in Western movies, and how Samurai culture is being\n  criminalized in Western movies. I don&#39;t have the time at the moment to\n  address this fully, but the consequences is that it reinforces the\n  long held stereotypes and does nothing to show the real history. There\n  are a lot of people here than I&#39;m sure agree with me. You&#39;ve come to\n  the right place with  your topic. I hope others here speak up.
