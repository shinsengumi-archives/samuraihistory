All things that the Japanese shared. Actually few place=\r\ns in\n&gt;&gt; the world were (and are) as homogeneous as Japan.\n&gt; That is wrong! =\r\nAll small portions of Japan was small countries with \n&gt; their\n&gt; independenc=\r\ne and own emperator as well.\n\nUh? The only native minority in Japan were th=\r\ne Ainu, who were tamed \nwell before Nobunaga came on the scene.\n\n&gt; The firs=\r\nt one who dreamt to have one nation and perhaps one world (for \n&gt; these\n&gt; p=\r\neople, Japan was the entire world) was the Emperator Yamato, that \n&gt; unlike=\r\n\n&gt; Nobunaga, had peaceful goals and intentions in his heart.\n&gt;\n&gt; To quote h=\r\nim (Yamato Emperor, NOT Nobunaga)\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;On the earth there ins=B4t earth por=\r\ntions marked with lines and \n&gt; different\n&gt; colours like a map. Why people o=\r\nf these earth portions had to fight \n&gt; each\n&gt; others when the earth is only=\r\n one?&quot;\n\nWhere is this citation from, and what is the date?\nAnd more than th=\r\nis, who is this &quot;Yamato Emperor&quot; ?\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So, he did exactly the same, inc=\r\nluding genocide against people who\n&gt;&gt;&gt; disagreed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with him or hated reli=\r\ngions... Just like Hitler...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, wait a minute... Do you h=\r\nave an idea of what the\n&gt;&gt; Holocaust was? Hitler killed 5.7 million people =\r\nsimply because they\n&gt;&gt; belonged to a race, or because he considered them in=\r\nferiors. They were\n&gt;&gt; not people on his path, he sent out over half of Euro=\r\npe his Gestapo \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; special extermination squads to get them, and to =\r\nmurder them. Hitler&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &quot;final solution,&quot; the ultimate decision of killing=\r\n ALL Jewish, is\n&gt;&gt; something you can not compare with Nobunaga&#39;s will to un=\r\nify Japan at\n&gt;&gt; all costs. Nobunaga did not build concentration camps where=\r\n thousands\n&gt;&gt; of people were killed every day after they were exploited as =\r\nslaves.\n&gt;&gt; And besides that, Nobunaga was born in the middle of a civil war=\r\n, \n&gt;&gt; while\n&gt;&gt; Hitler started a World War... How can you compare them? Hitl=\r\ner lived\n&gt;&gt; 400 years later than Nobunaga, in a different continent, and in=\r\n a\n&gt;&gt; totally different contest.\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you can speculate that, given the=\r\n chance, Nobunaga would have\n&gt;&gt; done as bad as Hitler, but... ***speculate*=\r\n** that&#39;s it.\n&gt;&gt; History is a different matter. IMHO.\n&gt;&gt; cepo\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Oooooo..=\r\n.. Very different contest...\n&gt;\n&gt; Hitler attempted to reunify the &quot;old Sacre=\r\nd German Empire&quot; that never\n&gt; existed in history. Always when certain porti=\r\nons of his ideal map are \n&gt; in the\n&gt; hands of germans, other portions was i=\r\nndependent. Some would say that \n&gt; he did\n&gt; attempted to do with the entire=\r\n world what the bastard of Nobunaga \n&gt; attempted\n&gt; with Japan.\n\nExactly. Th=\r\ne world and Japan are two different entities, and thus the \ncontexts are in=\r\ndeed different.\nNot to mention (again) that there were some 400 years of be=\r\ntween \nNobunaga and Hitler, and that to start a war and to continue it is n=\r\not \nthe same, like it is not the same to raze a few villages and to build \n=\r\nconcentration camps for systematic extermination.\n\n&gt; Hitler killed jews not=\r\n due to racist motivations only, but also \n&gt; religious,\n&gt; he also prosecute=\r\nd gypsies, homosexuals and even germans who didn=B4t \n&gt; agreed\n&gt; with his p=\r\nolicy.\n\nSo...?\n\n&gt; And... Although this is offtopic, Cesar, you may criticis=\r\ne my History \n&gt; View\n&gt; Points as much as ye want, but was not any non-chris=\r\ntian religion who \n&gt; always\n&gt; was conspiring to change history logs, doing =\r\nadulteration and \n&gt; falsification\n&gt; on the documents, such as what whas don=\r\ne with certain doccuments by \n&gt; Taccitus\n&gt; and others to &quot;prove&quot; that Jesus=\r\n existed. As well, to accuse several \n&gt; others\n&gt; religions (including judai=\r\nsm) of &quot;human sacrifice&quot; and all the same \n&gt; rant as\n&gt; aways.\n&gt;\n&gt; The japan=\r\nese remember very well their history. Thanks to Tokugawa \n&gt; again.\n\n.......=\r\n........\n\n&gt; And although I am not a communist...\n&gt; &quot;the people who don=B4t =\r\nknow their true history deeply, are fated to \n&gt; repeat it\n&gt; in circles&quot;\n&gt; M=\r\nao Tse Tung\n&gt;\n&gt; and again...\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Don=B4t go around spreading\n&gt; that I am t=\r\nelling lies.\n&gt; Stand up and PROVE I am wrong.\n&gt; The History of the Church\n&gt;=\r\n is full of conspirations of ambition and power&quot;\n&gt; Goetche\n&gt;\n&gt; that=B4s all=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\n&gt; S=E3o Paulo - SP Brasil\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; _________________________________________________________\n\nSorry, I have =\r\nNO IDEA of what are you trying to prove with these \ncitations above and the=\r\n discourse on Tacitus etc. Actually, -again, I \napologize- I have no idea o=\r\nf what you are talking about.
