Mitsuhide got the holders of some castle to come out to negotiate by giving over his mother to them as a hostage.  Nobunaga promptly had them all exectued.  Of course, Mitsuhide&#39;s mother was then killed in retaliation.  Mitsuhide probably justifiably held Nobunaga at fault for that.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;squrpio_prince&quot; &lt;squrpio_prince@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;      What exactly happened to make Akechi Mitshuhide want to kill \n&gt; him? I read once that it was rumored that Nobunaga beat him while \n&gt; drunk and used something that left a tatoo or a wierd scar upon his \n&gt; face . Does anyone know what happened?\n\n\n"
