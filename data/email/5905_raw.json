We were lucky eno=\r\nugh to\nhave access to the Wade collection (Snowshill Manor) several years a=\r\ngo\n(&#39;95-&#39;96), and we&#39;d stay over in the Manor for week-ends on the trot,\nst=\r\nudying, sketching and pulling our hair out, but it was worth it. Plus\nIan s=\r\npent a day with us there explaining everything, in collaboration\nwith Mike =\r\nJessop the then curator. Sadly the collection is currently not\non display a=\r\ns they are doing a lot of refurbishment to the building and\nno one has any =\r\nidea what&#39;s going to happen to the arms and armour. \n\nBTW for those of you =\r\nwho have a copy of Ian and Jock&#39;s book &quot;Arms and\nArmour of the Samurai&quot;, th=\r\ne two-page picture just before the title page\nwas taken in the then &quot;Green&quot;=\r\n room at Snowshill, an amazing collection.\n\nMark, to re-enforce what Paul s=\r\nays, there is NO substitute for getting\nyour hands on real armour, so get y=\r\nourself off to a museum with a\ncollection, contact the curator and tell him=\r\n/her what you&#39;re doing and\nask to have a hands on introduction. Don&#39;t be to=\r\no disappointed if you\nhave to try several, or if they restrict what you can=\r\n see or handle.\nThis is only to be expected with stuff that is quite often =\r\ndelicate. The\nother places to visit include arms fairs, where this stuff is=\r\n up for\nsale, I spent many a happy hour or six wandering around learning as=\r\n I\nwent. Finally if you can afford it, one technique is to buy bits of the\n=\r\nreal thing, study it, then sell it on and buy something else, repeat\nuntil =\r\nhappy, broke or both.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\n\nIn message &lt;20041110082850.9019.qm=\r\nail@...&gt;,\nRichardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; writ=\r\nes\n&gt;    HI\n&gt;\n&gt;    some of the info you need is on www.sengokudaimyo.com\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n    this site is one for making toy version a (full size)\n&gt;    out of cardb=\r\noard.\n&gt;    http://www.fsinet.or.jp/~usa/indexus.html\n&gt;\n&gt;    The template fo=\r\nr the koe is quite good but you may\n&gt;    need to alter it.

You are\n&gt;    going =\r\nto have to do what anyoe else has done, thats\n&gt;    get to a museum and view=\r\n as many sets as possible. If\n&gt;    you write in advance and talk with the m=\r\nuesum they\n&gt;    wiill take you into the displays and also to the store\n&gt;   =\r\n rooms where I bet that have extra pieces. I handled at\n&gt;    least 20 sets =\r\nof kote before I attempted mine. the\n&gt;    first sleeve took me one month do=\r\ning an hour or so\n&gt;    every day. that included making all my own rings etc=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;    start with these mail sites.\n&gt;    http://www.caradoc.org/~iain/gus=\r\nari.html\n&gt;    http://www.artofchainmail.com/patterns/\n&gt;    http://www.draky=\r\nl.com/japanese.php\n&gt;\n&gt;    you need to handle the mail and the plates to see=\r\n how\n&gt;    its constructed.\n&gt;\n&gt;    I was very lucky to have Ian Bottomley sh=\r\now me mail\n&gt;    and also draw diagrams for me on how to make it.\n&gt;\n&gt;    go =\r\nfor it its great fun, but you must handle the real\n&gt;    things first\n&gt;\n&gt;   =\r\n Paul\n&gt;\n&gt;    --- mark kd &lt;depos42300@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    -----------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt;    Hi Dean,\n&gt;    Thank you very much for replying.=\r\n Sucks you don&#39;t\n&gt;    have time. I have my first child coming in 1-2 weeks\n=\r\n&gt;    so i&#39;ll probably understand what you mean. Oh well, i\n&gt;    thought i&#39;d=\r\n ask anyways. (you sure,...???? $$$$$$)\n&gt;    Let&#39;s keep it at that for now,=\r\n but if you change your\n&gt;    mind u have my e-mail. Back to that first e-ma=\r\nil u\n&gt;    sent me about stitching the armor to the\n&gt;    fabrics...,...a cou=\r\nple more ?&#39;s then i&#39;ll stop\n&gt;    bothering u for advice.\n&gt;\n&gt;    1. So in ac=\r\ntuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe?\n&gt;    Outer Layer(that&#39;s what you se=\r\ne on the outsite), a\n&gt;    layer of Cloth Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where=\r\n can\n&gt;    a get that?what size?, a layer of Very Very Very Thin\n&gt;    Leathe=\r\nr(goes under hemp layer), and then the Inner\n&gt;    Shell(goes under v v v th=\r\nin leather)?is this layer\n&gt;    leather? do i harden the leather?if so do i =\r\nboil it\n&gt;    and then mold it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the\n&gt;    wh=\r\nole way down the entire KOTE and stay flexable?\n&gt;\n&gt;    2. I understand stit=\r\nching the mail down but about the\n&gt;    plates.. How do sew them down. You t=\r\nalked about a\n&gt;    &quot;running stitch&quot;???what&#39;s that? i&#39;m not a sewer. Do a\n&gt; =\r\n   sew through the metal? Do i predrill little holes?? I\n&gt;    don&#39;t underst=\r\nand that part. \n&gt;\n&gt;    3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle=\r\n\n&gt;    of a solid panal of mail? \n&gt;\n&gt;    4. Different topic. Do you have any=\r\n instructions on\n&gt;    how to lace lames together????? I just can&#39;t seem to\n=\r\n&gt;    get it right. My armor is all flimsy and isn&#39;t very\n&gt;    rigid. My Lam=\r\nes are about 1.5&quot; wide x 2.5&quot; high\n&gt;    10gauge stainless steal.(free from =\r\nwork) I need to\n&gt;    learn some better methods on lacing them together. I\n&gt;=\r\n    don&#39;t think i have enough hole punch in each lame?\n&gt;    Website&#39;s don&#39;t=\r\n really go into detail on putting more\n&gt;    than 2 lames together.(that suc=\r\nks) Anyway, if you have\n&gt;    a good technique on lacing Lame armor, please =\r\nlet me\n&gt;    know.\n&gt;\n&gt;    =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Thanks for everything\n&gt;    Dean,=\r\n\n&gt;    =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Mark\n&gt;    =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 \n&gt;    depos42300@...\n&gt;\n&gt;    Dean Wayland &lt;dean@thefights=\r\nchool.demon.co.uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt;    Hi Mark\n&gt;\n&gt;    Eep!\n&gt;\n&gt;    I&#39;m so sorry, if =\r\nI had the time I certainly would\n&gt;    help, but sadly I&#39;m\n&gt;    not that luc=\r\nky. I haven&#39;t done much building myself,\n&gt;    my eyesight is\n&gt;    really ba=\r\nd but I did lead a project to make an armour,\n&gt;    for one of my\n&gt;    frien=\r\nds. As I said in my reply, I was taking the\n&gt;    opportunity to get some\n&gt; =\r\n   of the data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a\n&gt;    few of the\n&gt;=\r\n    pictures of our &quot;work in progress&quot; posted to my web\n&gt;    site, with a s=\r\nhort\n&gt;    explanation. When I do I&#39;ll post the news here.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Meanwhile,=\r\n to give you an idea of what you could be\n&gt;    letting yourself in\n&gt;    for=\r\n: I started researching back in 1986, started\n&gt;    seriously sorting out\n&gt; =\r\n   the building in 1994 and we still haven&#39;t finished the\n&gt;    dam thing ye=\r\nt! In\n&gt;    the end we more or less gave up, until last year, when\n&gt;    we g=\r\not our butts\n&gt;    off the deck and knuckled down to doing some more\n&gt;    re=\r\nsearch and work\n&gt;    (that awful little four letter word). All the parts we=\r\n\n&gt;    had half done\n&gt;    were finished, and we started to look around for a=\r\n\n&gt;    decent smith who\n&gt;    could make the other parts for us instead, othe=\r\nrwise\n&gt;    Andrew, the friend\n&gt;    in question will be long in his grave by=\r\n the time we\n&gt;    actually finish it! \n&gt;\n&gt;    For myself, earlier this year=\r\n I gave in and bought a\n&gt;    Japanese festival\n&gt;    armour as a sort of sto=\r\np-gap, I was sick of the great\n&gt;    theoretical\n&gt;    armour, I wanted the r=\r\neal thing, well I got it, er..\n&gt;    sort of. The\n&gt;    replica in question i=\r\ns way under weight and needs a\n&gt;    lot of work, just to\n&gt;    make it servi=\r\nceable, but a whole lot less than\n&gt;    starting from scratch.\n&gt;    But I do=\r\n intend to replace it with something much\n&gt;    better.\n&gt;\n&gt;    The problem w=\r\nas we started with the idea of doing it\n&gt;    as right as\n&gt;    possible, but=\r\n of necessity we had to make compromises\n&gt;    as we went along,\n&gt;    which =\r\nno doubt you will probably have to do as well.\n&gt;    For example we\n&gt;    did=\r\nn&#39;t use urushi (Japanese lacquer), due to its cost\n&gt;    and toxicity. And\n&gt;=\r\n    when we did the kote (armoured sleeve), kohire\n&gt;    (&quot;little-fin&quot; brige=\r\nndine\n&gt;    shoulder guards) and the tate-eri (&quot;shield-collar&quot;) we\n&gt;    had =\r\nto use\n&gt;    American doe skin as we couldn&#39;t get the right thing\n&gt;    from =\r\nJapan. Now, we\n&gt;    can and the guys who did the sewing are cursing a lot\n&gt;=\r\n    as they know that\n&gt;    I&#39;m going to &quot;persuade&quot; them to replace it. The =\r\ndou\n&gt;    (body armour) we had\n&gt;    made is in russet 2mm steel and does loo=\r\nk amazing, but\n&gt;    it doesn&#39;t have\n&gt;    any gessan yet, but I hope to have=\r\n that sorted out\n&gt;    sometime soon, as\n&gt;    Michael who answered your firs=\r\nt email does make armour\n&gt;    in his spare time\n&gt;    (spare time? a misnome=\r\nr I think, would you not agree\n&gt;    Michael?).\n&gt;\n&gt;    Anyway I wish you the=\r\n best of luck, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t\n&gt;    currently be of\n&gt;    more help, but a=\r\ns soon as I&#39;ve got the stuff up on the\n&gt;    net I&#39;ll let you\n&gt;    know.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n    All the best\n&gt;\n&gt;    Yours\n&gt;\n&gt;    Dean\n&gt;\n&gt;    ***\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    In message\n&gt; =\r\n   &lt;20041109030428.71697.qmail@...&gt;,\n&gt;    mark kd\n&gt;    =\r\n&lt;depos42300@...&gt; writes\n&gt;    &gt;=A0=A0=A0 hi,\n&gt;    &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Tha=\r\nnk you very much for this info.

I&#39;m not asking you\n&gt;    to do it for me \n&gt;    &gt;=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 for free if that&#39;s what your thinking. I&#39;ll\n&gt;    gladly $pay$ you fo=\r\nr \n&gt;    &gt;=A0=A0=A0 your time.(for the pics & notes). I know it might\n&gt;    b=\r\ne asking a bit \n&gt;    &gt;=A0=A0=A0 much but if your interested please let me k=\r\nnow. I\n&gt;    really want to \n&gt;    &gt;=A0=A0=A0 make samurai armor but i&#39;m affr=\r\naid of screwing it\n&gt;    all up cause i \n&gt;    &gt;=A0=A0=A0 don&#39;t have a lot of=\r\n info on how to make it.
