I have not aligned myself with any\npart=\r\nisan candidate or party. I simply feel obligigated to defend the\nU.S. milit=\r\nary against speculation. Mostly because I want to believe\nthat the military=\r\n is doing right. I brought up President Bush only\nbecause he is the head of=\r\n the military. Commander in Chief. I\nbelieve that his motivations for the w=\r\nar were just. Congress thought\nso. Congress declared war.\n\nUnlike the samur=\r\nai, the U.S. military citizens do need to have a\nplace in the hearts of the=\r\n public. The military and the public are\nthe same people. The U.S. does not=\r\n have a military class. Since\ncitizen soldiers are no different than other =\r\ncitizens there is a\ndesire to be accepted. America learned that the militar=\r\ny needs the\npublic as a result of the Vietnam conflict.\n\nBrandon\n--- In sam=\r\nuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;midorinotoradesu&quot; &lt;\nbkirkham@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I=\r\n&#39;m running for Shogun of the free world.
