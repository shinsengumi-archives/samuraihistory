I found a company in Austrialia, Eureka Miniatures, \nthat makes 15mm Koreans for this period.  I&#39;ve also found a website that has \npictures from the Korean War Memorial Museum.  Interestingly enough, the \ncavalry pictures show the cavalry wearing armour.\n\nGood luck with your paper.\n\nBob Burke\n\nIn a message dated 11/15/03 3:36:00 PM, knorr31@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; Dear Bob:\nWith regard to the uniforms of Korean infantry\nfigures, I presume that the manufacturer did not make\ninfantry soldire figures on purpose because regular\ninfantry during the Yi dynasty did not have any\narmors. They did not look any warrior figures.\nAlso, as far as I know, the reular cavalry did not\nhave armors and their uniforms were probabily same as\nthose of the infantry.\n\nThe reason for not having armors except for commanders\nduring the Yi dynasty was that the main tactical units\nof soldiers were archers with complementary cannon\nunits but mostly in the Navy. If you had seen movie\n&quot;Brave Heart&quot;, you may recall the efficacy of the\nEnlish archers against tough Scottish soldiers armed\nwith swords and spears.\n\nKoreans were originally related to Mongols and\nManchurian at the ancient times. Tradionally, the\narchery had been an important part of arts for the\nnobility. I remember that the Japanese at the ancient\ntimes also put more emphasis on the archery than on\nthe  swordmanship.\n\nBack to your question, if you want to have more\nprecise information, you may check the Korean websites\nof Museums. I wish I could give more input. But, as\nyou know from my earlier message to you, I am pretty\ntight with finishing my paper, now. Good luck on your\nresearch.\n &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
