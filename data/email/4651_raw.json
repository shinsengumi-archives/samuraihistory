To \nbecome \n&gt; a Samurai you must have the right bloodline, is this correct? Also \n&gt; how old would a boy be before he turned Samurai. And how old would \nhe \n&gt; have to be before his first battle or was it, when he proved \nhimself \n&gt; ready.\n\nIt depends on the time period. Prior to Hideyoshi&#39;s edict on social \nmobility, one could be raised to samurai status by demonstrating \ncourage and ability in battle. Hideyoshi himself for example, was \nborn a commoner.\n\nYou didn&#39;t &quot;turn Samurai&quot; as such. You became an adult at around the \nage of 14, but there are certainly a few instances of people being \nin battle and taking their first heads at younger ages - but you \ndidn&#39;t need to prove yourself in battle to become a samurai. Several \nsamurai became the heads of their clans at very early ages. \nMatsudaira Hirotada (Ieyasu&#39;s father) was only 10 when his own \nfather died. Ieyasu became head of the Matsudaira at the age of 13 \nand was involved in the seige of Terabe at the age of 15.\n\n\n"
