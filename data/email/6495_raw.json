Assuming that the unit of land area\nis derived by squaring this we get: 11898.446 metres, or call it 1.19\nhectares, not eight. A hectare being a lump of turf measuring 100 x 100\nmetres. And for those of us who don&#39;t know their hectares from their\nHectors, the above translates to a smidgen under 3 acres, okay for the\npedants amongst us 2.975 (a hectare being 2.5 acres) :-)\n\nAs a guide, traditional rice production generates between 1 to 5 tonnes\nof rice per hectare per annum, depending upon the quality of the land\nand upon how many growing seasons per year you can get, which varies\nbetween one and three. A koku, is 180 litres of rice, which is about 135\nkg (ish) in the sack. Which means that roughly 1 cho of land should\nproduce somewhere between 8.8 and 44 koku per year, which is more or\nless the same figure of 30 koku that some one else suggested.\n\nAnd the idea of three functioning farms per chou makes my brain go\nsproing!\n\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
