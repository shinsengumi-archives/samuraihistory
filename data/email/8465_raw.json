I did not think this to be true, but another \n&gt; friend said that before Adams arrived they were using arquebus, and that \n&gt; Adams had introduced the flintlock. Can someone set me straight please?\n\n\nFirst of all, that TV program sounds like it was getting its\nhistory from James Clavell&#39;s Shogun. That is a bad thing. &lt;G&gt;\n\nBy 1600, there were thousands of matchlocks in use in Japan.\nAdams ship probably didn&#39;t have more than a few dozen.\n\nSecondarily, the flintlock was not introduced until sometime\naround 1625-30. That&#39;s basic research that looking at any\nencyclopedia article will show.\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
