I don&#39;t know much yet about identifying armor, so I cannot tell what was wrong about the armor in TLS.   And \nremember, that production had it&#39;s own technical advisor, and none of us know what went on between that/those person/s and the \ndirector.  What I need to do is get my arse over to a good library and set some books out side by side....\n\nAnyway, time to move on.....    I have to go study medieval history by watching &#39;Return of the King&#39;.....\n\nEvil old woman,\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Nate Ledbetter\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n\n&gt; Armor: I don&#39;t know from squat, and would love to\n&gt; learn.  Yes, I&#39;ve read Tony&#39;s pages. My questions\n&gt; are these, so far:  how\n&gt; impoverished was the samurai class by the Meiji\n&gt; period; hadn&#39;t the shogunate been defunct by around\n&gt; twenty years by the time frame\n&gt; of the movie; and how many generations might a suit\n&gt; of armor last?\n\nTaken care of, it could last quite a long time. As for\nhow impoverished were they? Well, there were rich\nsamurai, and poor ones. The Shogunate doesn&#39;t enter\ninto this, since as you point out it was defunct for 2\ndecades, so I&#39;m not sure where you are going with that\nquestion.\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.813 / Virus Database: 553 - Release Date: 12/13/2004 \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
