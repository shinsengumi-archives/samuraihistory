I do read a lot of\nthe posts as there are some real experts lurking in the shadows here.\n\nI&#39;ve been a Martial Arts aficionado and amateur historian, as well as a\npublished author since my teens which is a while ago now, and normally\nthere&#39;s very little in this mailing group than makes me shake my head in\ndismay.\n\nThis week has been different, it would be nice if before posting for the\nfirst time, second time, or at all, newcomers would take themselves to the\nhistory books or even a well respected website and actually learn a little\nabout the subject they are posting on.\n\nAs a separate point, if you learnt what you *believe* you know from anything\nproduced by Hollywood, think again.\n\nThere is nothing worse than appearing to be a fool and an imbecile in front\nof your peers.\n\nBest regards.\n\n- G.McMaster\nhttp://www.combative-arts.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
