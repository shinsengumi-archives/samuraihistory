I was thinking: since a\n&gt; &gt; few of this list are in Japan, wouldn&#39;t be nice to get together for\n&gt; &gt; some serious historical sightseeing, to be completed with an historical\n&gt; &gt; food+booze session at an izakaya in the old capital?? If there are a\n&gt; &gt; few of us (and we&#39;re willing to invest a little) I can try to get a\n&gt; &gt; couple of my maiko friends to come around for a reasonable price - no\n&gt; &gt; kidding!!! :oO\n&gt; &gt; I know some of you are in Kanto, but....c&#39;mon... I am flying 7 hours\n&gt; &gt; from Honolulu; can&#39;t you hop on a shinkansen??\n&gt; &gt; cepo&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; March 19 to the 26 you say. I have some days off from my school on\n&gt; &gt; 20-21 and\n&gt; &gt; 25-31. However its a busy season with the new school year starting in\n&gt; &gt; April.\n&gt; &gt; The best time for me might be Sunday the 21st. Getting to Kyoto is no\n&gt; &gt; problem; its only a 30 minute train ride.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; William\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online \nhttp://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\n\n\n\n"
