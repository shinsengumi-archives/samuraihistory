I&#39;ll keep it simple.(or at least i&#39;ll try)\n \n1.) Mimi ito(edge lacing) - does it have to be a different color than the rest of the primary lacing to be considered authentic? or can it be the same color?\n \n2.) What is the reasoning behind the odoshi being slightly wider than the dehaba? &,...How far should each scale overlap the other?(for a very narrow hon kozan,3/8&quot; wide 2&1/4&quot; height ,one set a vertical holes(though i&#39;m still working out how many holes,...my first try was a disaster,...lol)\n \n3.) I&#39;ve heard that Kohire are only found on Tosei Gusoku. Would it be correct if I put Kohire on a Dangae Do? How are the winglets attached to the watagami?\n \nWell,...that should do for now. I have a lot more ?&#39;s to ask but these will keep me busy for a while. Thank you very much for your time.\n                                                                  Thank you,\n                                                                  Mark DePasquale\n                                                                   depos42300@...\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n Start your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
