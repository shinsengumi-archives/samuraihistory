It sounds like your farmer was \npulling your leg. The whole story sounds pretty much wrong. The way to \nreally get on someone&#39;s nerves is to be excessively polite, not turning \na tea bowl backwards. The really big problem with turning a tea bowl \nbackwards is it makes yourself look bad. Not an all an acceptable \napproach for displaying pique. Incidentally, tea bowls are descended \nfrom Chinese herbal medicine bowls as are several other tea implements. \nIn theory, and occasionally in practice, every bowl has a spout for \nadministering medicine. Since you are not ill, you turn the bowl so \nthat spout points away from you. Also, Urasenke is one of the tea \nschools which is into threes.\n\n\n"
