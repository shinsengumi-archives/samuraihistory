At the time, the \nthen-Tokichiro was a low servant of Nobunaga, and doubtful would have been a \nfull samurai (if such ranks existed), while Samanosuke was a ronin.  Now, how \nthis helps, and how much, I don&#39;t know, but I thought I&#39;d mention it anyway.  \n(-:\n\nLater,\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
