There&#39;s\nplenty of honor shown by many of those who fight it.\nNot every soldier is honorable, just like not every\nsamurai was honorable. But usually it&#39;s not the\nsoldiers who want to go fight the war. Anyone who\ndoesn&#39;t believe that, I&#39;ll take a poll of my friends\nand colleagues, and get back to you--I&#39;ll ask how many\nof them in Iraq and Afghanistan right now are enjoying\nthemselves, how many wanted to go and be separated\nfrom their families, etc. I doubt I&#39;ll get many\npositive responses. \n\nNate Ledbetter\nCPT, US Army\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
