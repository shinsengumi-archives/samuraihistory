I am considering\n&gt; (ser=\r\niously considering) publishing a quarterly Japanese history\n&gt; journal. The =\r\nmain issue to address, aside from wondering if anyone\n&gt; would even want to =\r\nbuy it, is, I would need to gather enough articles\n&gt; to constitute a bi-yea=\r\nrly or quarterly journal.  So these are the\n&gt; initial questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. If=\r\n the S-A published a history journal (actual paperback high\n&gt; quality books=\r\n), with 4-6 articles, probably totalling 80-120 pages,\n&gt; would you consider=\r\n buying/subscribing?\n&gt; 2. Is there anyone who would be interested in actual=\r\nly contributing\n&gt; articles? (I would have a set of requirements TBD)\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nll of the details are TBD (To Be Decided), I&#39;m just testing the\n&gt; waters he=\r\nre. I would aim for between 8-16 articles a year (the number\n&gt; of articles =\r\nwould determine the number of issues) and would set an\n&gt; estimated target o=\r\nf between 25-60 pages per article, and an assortment\n&gt; of other requirement=\r\ns. Basically it would be in official book form,\n&gt; with issues available to =\r\npurchase online via amazon.com,\n&gt; barnesandnoble.com etc., or if I decide t=\r\no offer a subscription, it\n&gt; would be available for a discount.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, th=\r\noughts?\n&gt;\nYeah i would consider buying depending on my financial situation =\r\nis at\nthe time.  \n\n\n"
