Tokugawa did the\nunifying of Japan because his incursions had peace as a goal, unlike the\nchristian Nobunaga, that only spread terrorism and genocide.\n\nAnd yes, I admire him as well Musashi. Of course I am speaking about\nTakeda...\n\nBtw, that statements (babbling in japanese) about Musashi being not fammous\nto real japan dwellers is ridiculous. Sorry if I offend anyone, but I have\nsome basis to call the attention of all.\n\nFirst of all, his book Go Rin No Shou is obrigatory reading to several japan\nexecutive staff people.\n\nSecond, There was a Japanese TV Series Drama about Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s\nbiography and it was very popular in Japan.\n\nThird, there was TONS of manga and gekiga that was in homnage of Musashi,\nmentioned him somewhere or used a version of him like an popular comic manga\nof the 80s that had a kind of Musashi-Kid as its principal character.\n\nI remember a joke very well inside such manga...\n\nThere was a duel between musashi-kid and another little samurai about who\nwould be a better samurai.\n\nMusashi glared to him and he glared to Musashi, and no one lost this face\ndown. Then the little samurai told Musashi this:\n\n&quot;Bushido&#39;s way is to not be afraid of Death, in fact is to live in death&quot;,\nthen suddendly he killed himself in front of Musashi just to prove him that\nhe is better than Musashi.\n\nWith tears on his face, Musashi said that this is correct, but NOT NECESSARY\nin this WAY!!!\n\n(this was supposed to be a joke in such a dark humour typical of such comics\nserie and of course, was not published in english)\n\nAlso, I&#39;ve heard about Musashi much time before all this NIPON-Modism, and\nit was around the 80&#39;s as well!\n\nSincerelly\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\nMessage: 1\n   Date: Mon, 5 Apr 2004 11:29:47 +0300\n   From: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;edy@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Digest Number 768\n\nNo,Tokugawa and Hideyoshi would never have ended like they did.If Nobunaga\ndidn&#39;t take all that territory,Hideyoshi would have never been to\nKorea.....and perhaps the Tokugawa dinasty would&#39;t have existed....\n\nEdy\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: Thiago Buschinelli Sorrentino\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Monday, April 05, 2004 12:27 AM\n  Subject: RES: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 768\n\n\n\n  Anyways, would Hideiyoshi and Tokugawa have gotten that far without\n  Nobunaga�s incursions? Specially Tokuwaga, who seemed to be at the right\n  time, at the right place? Whilst I do not intend to set myself as an\nexpert\n  on the field (an enthusiast, rather - please bear this in mind), would it\nbe\n  too far from feasible bounds to hold that Tokugawa won by default (lack of\n  capable opponents)?\n\n  Thiago\n    -----\n\n    &gt; Message: 1\n    &gt;    Date: Fri, 19 Mar 2004 10:26:01 +0000 (GMT)\n    &gt;    From: Michael Lorimer &lt;mijalo_jp@...&gt;\n    &gt; Subject: Re: oda nobunaga\n    &gt;\n    &gt; I tend to agree, Nobunaga was neither the unifier, or the first\n    &#39;dictator&#39;, he wasn&#39;t even shogun.  In terms of the question itself,\n  surely\n    a leader (anywhere) could be both dictator and unifier, they are not\n    mutually exclusive terms.\n    &gt; Sprouting from the term &#39;unifier&#39; though I have a question? When was\n  Japan\n    unified? Considering, Hokkaiko was really only geographically part of\n  Japan\n    until the 18th and 19th Centuries, despite incursions and expeditions\ninto\n    the north dating back to the Asuka-jidai, and before; while the Nansei\n  (SW)\n    Islands (Okinawa, etc) were not part of Japan until the first decades of\n  the\n    Edo-jidai.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; M.Lorimer\n    &gt;\n    &gt; &quot;Anthony J.
