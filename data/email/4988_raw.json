But the edict banning seppuku \nwas published in 1663 by the 4th Tokugawa Shogun, Ietsuna. To be \nprecise it is actually all ritual suicide (junshi) that was outlawed, \nnot seppuku only.\n\nObviously, there were numerous exceptions to this edict, but as far \nas I can tell it was never formally repealed.\n\nMight it be that in 1868 - after the formal close of the Bakufu - the \nlaws established by the Bakufu were now obsolete and seppuku was now b\nack in play, or at least the status was now unclear?\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
