I said it contrasted.\n\nIn other words, arts = non-warrior, like I said a Western hangup.\n\n&gt;     Second, I don&#39;t recall Julius Ceasar&#39;s &quot;Ode to a Summer Morning&quot; or\n\nThe Romans as a culture did not write literature, they wrote histories. \nHave you read his &#39;Gallic Wars&#39;?\n\n&gt;     Richard the Lionheart&#39;s &quot;Study of Roses.&quot; \n\nI don&#39;t know if Richard had any artistic accomplishments though there \nwere famous poets of the period who were knights.\n\n&gt; The point I&#39;m making, it shows duality but not all warrior cultures highly prize artistic\n&gt; expression, especially among the warriors. \n\nDoes being a warrior mean you cannot appreciate or perform art? Or as I \nthink is it more of an overall cultural bias that permeates all parts of \na society?\n\n&gt;     With that said, I asked what was their choice of\n&gt;     entertainment. \n\nI think I gave answers to that, most of them liked women, drinking and \nsometimes gambling.\n\n &gt; Those can&#39;t be the only examples of war like entertainment.\n\nThere&#39;s also archery contests and dueling.\n\n&gt;     Unlike Rome, the samurai, in particualr before the edo period,\n&gt;     prepared for war constantly and were measured more by prowess in\n&gt;     combat. \n\n??? The Republican Romans trained far more than the Samurai ever did in \n  and frankly in a melee of 100 Romans versus 100 Samurai, I would bet \non the Romans. The Romans for a long time were a soldier culture which \nbasically kicked butt on most of the surrounding warrior cultures.\n\n&gt; Yet, they didn&#39;t relish in bloodshed as much as their Roman counterparts. \n\nNice sword looking Ichitaro, how does it cut? I don&#39;t know, here comes a \npeasant, lets try it on him. Oh, another peasant rebellion, just kill \nthem all.\n\n&gt; There has to be some other examples. Drinking,\n&gt; womanizing, and gambling: I don&#39;t view these as war like\n&gt; entertainment because all males participate. \n\nMysteriously until the Edo period, war was a sport that all males could \nparticipate in if they wanted to advance their class. Who&#39;s that monkey guy?\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n"
