I have not heard of such words\nin my entire life. How old was Shingen when he led his\ncampaign  and was invincible against &#39;young&#39; Tokugawa\nIeyasu and Oda Nobunaga? How old was Yamamoto Kansuke\nwhen he joined Singen?\n\nAdmiral Lee, Sun-Shin who was commanding the Korean\nNavy during the Japanese invasion in the 16 century\nbecame either a second Lieutenant or a capatian in the\nmodern military rank when he was 32 years old because\nhe hurt his left leg during the military officer\nselection exam 4 years before. But, he became one of\nthe greatest warrior or samurai in history.\n\nI am sure that we can find a lot of similar examples\nin the western history such as Sir William who\ndefeated Napoleon. \n\nAlthough I wish a success in your search for the\nJapanese word for the retired or aging(how old?), I do\nnot think that a samurai can retire even if he tries\nhard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n               Changsub Lee, BA.,MPA., MSST.,\nMA(soon).\n\n\n\n                            \n--- northdog42 &lt;northdog42@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have been trying to find out if there is a\n&gt; specific term applied to\n&gt; an aging or &quot;retired&quot; samurai.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
