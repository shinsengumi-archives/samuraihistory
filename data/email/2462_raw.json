However, a =\r\nbook with a similar title and format already exists. I bought it this year =\r\non my trip to the bi-annual Kulmbach Zinnfigur Boerse in Germany. Unfortuna=\r\ntely it is in Polish!! Polish is as unintelligible to me as japanese - but =\r\nthen I enjoy the challenge.. but for polish readers worth a look.  Here is =\r\na review I put together:\n\n\nKAWANAKAJIMA 1561\n\nby : Witold Nowakowski illust=\r\nrations: Piotr Prominski cost : apx 14 euro\n\n1561 was the year of the fourt=\r\nh battle at Kawanakajima between the two rivals, Takeda Shingen and Uesugi =\r\nKenshin, and one of the most bloodiest, in terms of casualties, of the 16th=\r\n century. What makes this battle more of interest is that Shingen drew up h=\r\nis battle lines after nightfall and completed manouvers before first light.=\r\n However, what should have been a surprise attack on the unwarry Uesugi was=\r\n thwarted and instead the Takeda were subjected to the focus of attacks fro=\r\nm a well practised tactical development by Kenshin.  Kenshin had been made =\r\naware of Shingens night movements and had undertaken his own placements und=\r\ner cover of the same darkness. The Takeda forces came under great presssure=\r\n but held firm to &quot;win&quot; the day with a loss of around 14000, including many=\r\n important family members and generals. The Uesugi losses were similar but =\r\naccounted for a higher proportion of troops engaged.\n\nThe book is one of a =\r\nseries of books, produced by Bellona [ http://ksiegarnia.bellona.pl]and pub=\r\nlished in Poland - in polish, discussing the background and the events lead=\r\ning up to the warfare. &quot;Kawanakajima 1561&quot; is well illustrated with colour =\r\nartwork, maps and prints in a format similar to Osprey but slightly smaller=\r\n [160x235] - cosisting of 48 pages of which 8 are in full colour. The new a=\r\nrtwork is reminiscient of Angus McBride&#39;s style [almost identical] with the=\r\n figures represented being rather squat and short. The work relies heavily =\r\non previously work published in Osprey - Turnbull and Bryant - and the red =\r\nbook Rekishi Series. An ideal book for readers who would find reading Polis=\r\nh easier than English. However, Stephen Turnbull is due to publish an Ospre=\r\ny Campaign Series later this year tittled &quot;Kawanakajima 1553-64&quot;. {truely S=\r\nRT has been very busy with the pen this last year!}\n\n{Here is the AMAZON pr=\r\ne publication notes on this.}\n\nTURNBULL Paperback; November 25 2003; 96 pag=\r\nes; ISBN: 1841765627 =A312.99\n\nKawanakajima is unique in history. In the sp=\r\nace of 12 years, between 1553 and 1564, this valley deep in the mountains o=\r\nf central Japan witnessed no less than five battles between two of Japan&#39;s =\r\ngreatest warlords. Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin were both descended fr=\r\nom great families and were highly skilled tacticians. Both had taken the to=\r\nnsure and risen to high rank in their respective Buddhist sects. When Shing=\r\nen attempted to seize control of Shinano province they were set on a collis=\r\nion course. Stephen Turnbull chronicles the see-saw struggle between two me=\r\nn who epitomize the warrior daimyo from Japan&#39;s &#39;Warring States&#39; period. \n\n=\r\n\nContents \n\nOrigins of the campaigns; Chronology; Opposing Commanders; Oppo=\r\nsing Armies; Opposing Plans; The Kawanakajima campaigns (1553, 1555, 1557, =\r\n1561, 1564) ; Aftermath; The Battlefield Today; Bibliography ; Index\n\n\n\n[No=\r\nn-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
