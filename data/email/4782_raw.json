A daimyo\n&gt; ruled over a province \n&gt; and reported to the shogun, the military leader in\n&gt; Japan during the \n&gt; Edo period. \n\nSort of, but not really--it&#39;s not like the colonel\nreporting to a general or anything as formal as that.\nSome daimyo (fudai daimyo) were hereditary retainers\nof the Tokugawa house, and as such yes, they\n&quot;reported&quot; to the Shogunate. Some had no allegiance to\nthe Tokugawa at all (the Tozai daimyo) and paid the\nshogunate nominal due, but ruled their province like\nthey saw fit. \n\nIt&#39;s not like the daimyo was the appointed governor,\nreally, and was responsible for the province to the\nShogun, necessarily--more like he owned the province,\nand had to listen to the Shogunate and uphold it&#39;s\ndecrees, but more or less could do what he wanted\n(within limits) in his own domains. \n\nMake any sense?\n\n\nDuring the Meiji restauration, the\n&gt; institution of the \n&gt; daimyo was abolished and the provinces were replaced\n&gt; by prefectures. \n\nEssentially, yes.\n\n&gt; While The shogun was the highest Japanese military\n&gt; ruler during the \n&gt; Kamakura and Edo period. Although the emperor was\n&gt; officially the head \n&gt; of the state, the shogun rulers had the actual power\n&gt; until the end of \n&gt; the Edo period\n\nUm, yeah, sort of--though often times whoever the\nShogun&#39;s ADVISER was had the real power...in some ways\n(later Ashikaga, later Tokugawa, and the entire Hojo\nShikken period) the Shogunate was just as much a\npuppet framework as the Imperial system.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
