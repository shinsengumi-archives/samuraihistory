He has just enforced a law against obesity. (All \n&gt; overweight kids in Singapore need to exercise for 15 minutes during \n&gt; recess, and their calories intake at school is severely controlled). He \n&gt; would have been a dream Shogun (or Philosopher king).\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers, sorry again for the OT\n&gt; cepo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
