I know it&#39;s not technically samurai history, but it&#39;s a\n&gt; great illustration of how the term &#39;samurai&#39; is being bandied about\n&gt; nowadays.\n&gt;\n&gt; BERLIN (Reuters) - A camouflage-clad German man wielding a samurai\n&gt; sword attacked at least seven hikers in forests west of Berlin,\n&gt; performing sword tricks before ordering them to leave the woods,\n&gt; police said Friday.\n&gt; They suspect a 46-year-old local man who trained in martial arts and\n&gt; survival skills in camps in Papua New Guinea and Vietnam to be the\n&gt; attacker.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s dangerous and has been hard to find because he wears\n&gt; camouflage,&quot; said Catrin Feistauer, spokeswoman for the Nauen police\n&gt; department. Police have used infrared cameras mounted on helicopters\n&gt; to try and track him down.\n&gt;\n&gt; The man pushed two elderly people off their bikes and, flashing his\n&gt; sword, shouted at them to leave the forest. He later tried to drive a\n&gt; young couple out of the woods. No one was seriously hurt.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s frightening because the violence level has increased each\n&gt; time,&quot; Feistauer said.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Yahoo!
