Oops!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is from page 27 of Japonius Tyrannus the bio of Nobunaga by\nJeroen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lamers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It has been unclear for a very long time in precisely which year\n&gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobunaga took this mountain castle [Inabayama]. Matsuda Ryo, a local\n&gt; &gt; &gt; historian of Gifu Prefecture has convincingly argued that Nobunaga\nfirst\n&gt; &gt; &gt; captured Mount Inaba in 1564, lost it again to Tatsuoki in 1565, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; took possession of the castle in June 1567.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He cites the book &#39;Nobunaga no Mino koryaku-shi kenkyu&#39; by Matsuda Ryo\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this info.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
