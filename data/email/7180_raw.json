I even talked to him a couple of years back. he\nhas even tried to enter a few Ninjutsu Dojos I am referring to Genbukan, and\nBujinkan. I am not aware if he applied to a Jinenkan dojo. \r\nI was introduced to him through a couple of Independent Ninjutsu Instructors\n at the time I talked to him he was 13. \r\nhe was also spouting off on some forums, talking some twisted things. he was\ntracked down and found out his real age. he also asked me about a webpage I\nhad on making a Sword. he wanted to use it on his page. but I don&#39;t think he\never used it though..  good thing..\r\n-------Original Message-------\r\n \r\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter\r\nDate: 05/31/05 00:28:56\r\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\r\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Ninja Masters of America\r\n \r\n\r\n--- Michael Youngblood &lt;warrior02@...&gt; wrote:\r\n\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I was merely answering the question that he was a\r\n&gt; child. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Mike\r\n\r\nIs he?
