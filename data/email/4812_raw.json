I suggest you not take things\npersonally. \n\nIf I had said Hideyoshi was born in Totomi, and he was\nactually born in Owari, I&#39;d want someone to tell me.\nBut I suppose that may just be me. \n\n \n\nSorry if I sound upset in my message.Dont really want to be self-defensive; but how can you be very sure that I&#39;m really upset.Though I&#39;ll take note that you&#39;ve said that I sound upset & you&#39;re not really implying that I am really so but still you drag me to become upset.I was not upset while composing my previous message.\n\nI am new to this group and enjoy reading the discussions offered by those who answer the questions presented.I want to enhance my knowledge about the subject that&#39;s being discussed here and so I give further issues to tackle with regard to the topic that&#39;s being discussed.\n\nI gladly take your suggestion not to take things personally;for in the first place I do not.Then why are we called a discussion group if after giving a reaction to the issues that had been touched recently someone will react in turn that I sound upset because someone took issue with what I&#39;ve said? \n\nAm I not corteous enough to admit my mistakes and acknowledge the person who pointed me out all of those?I&#39;ve repeatedly said that I appreciate it and thankful for it and I hope that the words that I type and send to be posted for our group to read will just convey that.\n\nIt so happen that people send their corrections to your mistakes before you get any chance to correct it yourself.\n\nDon&#39;t reaaly want to take this personally & I&#39;ll never will.I just want friendly exchanges of knowledge and information and even opinions.And I believe that the people with interests to things connected to the samurai must have enough ethical sensibilty to respect that.\n\n-Solomon \n            \n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
