That&#39;s\nunderstandable, we all make mistakes. \n\nConsistent mistakes in spelling, punctuation,\ncapitalization, etc., is a different matter. The\nmoderators reserve the right to delete any posts we\nsee fit--you agree to that by joining this group, as\nit&#39;s in the rules you are supposed to read. \n\nAgain, this is simply a reminder to the group that\nthis is not a teen chat board. We expect our posters\nto be respectful and to make attempts to post as\nintelligently as possible. The occaisional mistake is\nno problem, and of course we make allowances for those\nposters who are not posting in their native language.\nEveryone else must make an attempt. If you\nconsistently can&#39;t spell the MAIN SUBJECT of this\nforum, then you should be prepared not to be taken\nseriously. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
