Did the Sanada *rule* shinano or just exi=\r\nst there?  In Turnbulls\nbook on daimyo he has some EXCELLENT shots of the S=\r\nanada mansion and\nIm uber happy there :)  They must have been very prominen=\r\nt.\n\n2).  Did all soldiers have a sashimono of red with 6 black coins?  Are\n=\r\nthere any variants?\n\n3).  On the flags, are the black coins with circular h=\r\noles, square or\nrectangle?  Ive seen all in illustrations, but IVe seen no =\r\noriginal\nflags :( \n\n4).  Are there any museums with original Sanda artifact=\r\ns?  I found a\nwebsite that seems to have a lot of Takeda and some Sanda stu=\r\nff...\nhttp://www.yamamotokansuke.com/shiro/tenzan/index.htm\n\n5).  What city=\r\n were the Sanada from? \n\n6).   What castles did the Sanada hold?\n\n7).  How =\r\nwell did the Sanada get along with the other retainer\nfamilies?  Any rivalr=\r\nies?  I know the Akiyama held a castle in\nShainano for a while.\n\n8).  Toish=\r\ni castle (1550) is supposed to be &quot;well documented&quot;\nhttp://folk.uio.no/arns=\r\nteio/samurai/sanada/SanadaYukitaka.shtml  where\ncan I find recounts of this=\r\n siege?\n\n9).  Im looking for specific numbers of troop types at any one tim=\r\ne. \nI have seen a couple Takeda battle lists, but it concentrated mostly\non=\r\n horses.  \n\n10).  Any clan-specific facts; more than just the Bio of certai=\r\nn people.\n\nthanks,\n-Jason\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot;=\r\n\n&lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m curious what it is you think you&#39;re =\r\nmissing, seems like you&#39;ve hit\n&gt; all the major places to look, read the bio=\r\ngraphies - can you come up\n&gt; with any specific questions?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"
