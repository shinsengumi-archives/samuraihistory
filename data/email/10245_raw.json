In a book I was recently reading, &quot;Young Japan: Yokohama and Yedo&quot; by Jo=\r\nhn R. Black, the author writes about witnessing an execution sometime in th=\r\ne 1860`s in the Tobe area of Yokohama. Also a journalist in Japan in 1880 w=\r\nrote a story about the execution ground. You can see the story here: \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nhttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=3DFB0B10FA3F551A7493C0A81782=\r\nD85F448784F9 \n&gt; \n&gt; I have been living in Yokohama for 4 years and was quite=\r\n surprised to hear about this bleak part of Yokohama`s past. I figure there=\r\n must be some kind of memorial, shrine or, at least a sign marking the site=\r\n - but, thus far, no luck at all in finding it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
