Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nDate: Mon, 09 May 2005 02:23:53 \nTo:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] New Ninja documentary\n\nRichardson Paul wrote:\n\n&gt; Until you have seen it you havent a lcue what your\n&gt; talking about. I also think that when you have seen it\n&gt; you will be so wound up by what I have said that you\n&gt; will still hate it.\n\nIf I hear someone has made a documentary about Auschwitz and a key publicized \ncontributor to the documentary was a famous Holocaust-debunker, I wouldn&#39;t have \nto see the video to know that it&#39;s likely crap. Or, at least, it contains more \ncrap (in this case, any unit over &quot;one&quot;) than I care to see.\n\nDon&#39;t you get it? In anything that claims to be a *real* documentary or history \nof ninja, *mentioning* Hayes can be done -- in the context of fraud and total \nbogusness. But to use him as one of the sources and actually present him as one \nautomatically makes the film suspect.\n\nIt&#39;s the job of the producers to make people want to see it, and as a historian \nspecializing in Japan&#39;s military history, I find the inclusion of Hayes in *any* \ndocumentary suspect. I have no interest in seeing it. It&#39;s not *my* fault I \ndon&#39;t trust him or anything connected with him. It&#39;s the producers who made that \nchoice.\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
