The psychology is more interesting than the \npyrotechnics (although the technique/technical stuff is fun). \nAhh ... the manipulation of human weakness! Our anonymous \nTokugawa Administrator - was it greed? blackmail? jealousy? \n\nIn fact my interest in the samurai as such is to strip away the \n&#39;warrior myth&#39; - the reality IS far more fantastic, in its way, \nthan the legend. The development of swordsmanship becomes \nmeaningless (to me) when those involved are demigods. When \nthey are simply men ... then that&#39;s something else.\n\nNate:\nI&#39;d rather read about how someone bribed the maid of Lord\nso-and-so ...\n\nTom:\nI&#39;m a sucker for the Le Carre style myself ... the steady \ncollation of snippets of info, the &#39;necessary pressure&#39; applied \nto find out that last piece of the jigsaw ... (sorry, I&#39;m \nwaxing lyrical again)\n\nTom:\nAnd Tom Cruise could play Shingen!\n\nNate:\nYou&#39;re trying to give me a heart attack, aren&#39;t you? \n\nTom:\nRats! Have I blown my cover? Can you see my pajamas?\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
