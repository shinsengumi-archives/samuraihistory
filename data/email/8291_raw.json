It plays in=\r\nto \n&gt; &gt;  the notion of the &quot;cowboy with a conscience&quot; that forms the backbo=\r\nne \n&gt; &gt;  of most westerns, a character with a clear sense of &quot;right and\nwro=\r\nng&quot;, \n&gt; &gt;  risking his life for &quot;right&quot;.  This is a mythic sort of characte=\r\nr, \n&gt; &gt;  which was blended with the &quot;high concept&quot; of professionals\nhelping=\r\n the \n&gt; &gt;  helpless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong. I really liked THE MAGNIFICEN=\r\nT SEVEN. I saw it as a \n&gt; teenager (which was a long, long, LONG time ago  =\r\n:)\n&gt; \n&gt; But the idea of a &quot;cowboy with a conscience&quot; who has a clear sense\n=\r\nof &quot;right \n&gt; and wrong&quot; isn&#39;t at all like a 17th century Japanese ronin. Th=\r\ne\ncowboys with a \n&gt; conscience and a clear sense of right and wrong weren&#39;t=\r\n thrust into\ntheir \n&gt; roles as hired gunfighters. They were American, with =\r\nthe unique\nAmerican culture \n&gt; of having freely chosen this path. \n\nYou&#39;ll =\r\nalso notice the culture difference where in Magnificent Seven,\nthe protagon=\r\nists stand at the gates of the town and confront the\nbandits, whereas in Se=\r\nven Samurai the Samurai hide out and ambush\nthem, never once confronting th=\r\nem before the battle.\n\n\n\n\n"
