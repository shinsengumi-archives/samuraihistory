I hear that Kagemusha is about using a double \nof Oda Nobunaga to hide his death. Was this fiction or are there at \nleast some rumors to it?\n\nThe Wolf of Mibu\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Agreed....I think it will be painful. Horribly Wrong.\n&gt; And that&#39;s on top of how I feel about Tom Cruise in\n&gt; general. It will be the pain of Shogun (the\n&gt; translations, the Edo-jidai uniform kimono, the\n&gt; silliness of the whole love story) on a much grander\n&gt; scale. It will hurt. It will kill me. And I will go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Anthony J.

But what do you\n&gt; &gt; guys think of it? Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you think it has the potential to be up there with\n&gt; &gt; Shogun and The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; crapfest to make money\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I look at going to it much as I do going to the\n&gt; &gt; dentist. I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t like it. I know\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;ll hurt.
