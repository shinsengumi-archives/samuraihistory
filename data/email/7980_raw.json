You will find interesting interpretations for gasho as \nwell. However, as someone already pointed out, the symbol itself is old \nand, as I recall, can be found in Iran before the historical buddha was \nborn. That said, its incorporation into Buddhism is probably rather \nmore straightforward than being suggested by some here. While sun \nsymbolism could link the maji with Amaterasu in Japan, the symbol \nitself appears to have come across from the continent.\n\n\n\n\n"
