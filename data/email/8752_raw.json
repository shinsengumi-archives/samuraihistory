It was adapted\nand changed to suit Japanese tastes and fighting techniques by the middle of\nthe Heian period (AD 794-1185) it was more or less the fully developed sword\nthat we see today.\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;jonathan ellgen&quot; &lt;jpellgen@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, May 11, 2006 2:05 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] samurai swords\n\n\nPerhaps you should think about doing a comparsion style peice instead\n(Japanese sword styles/European styles). I just think that might be alot\neasier.
