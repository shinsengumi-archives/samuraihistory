I have upl=\r\noaded two photos to my photobucket account of a spread from Life Magazine f=\r\nrom January 21, 1946 (electronic photos snapped of the actual magazines, wh=\r\nich are sitting here next to my very cluttered workspace). The article is o=\r\nn &quot;Emperor&quot; Hiromichi and his claim to the throne. It must have made good c=\r\nopy in the immediate postwar days!\n\nBTW, these photos are large (first is a=\r\nbout 175K and the second around 760K). I tried to make the second one large=\r\n enough so that whoever wishes can also read the article. If you&#39;re unable =\r\nto read it and wish me to send or post a larger or cropped version, email m=\r\ne and I&#39;ll be glad to modify the picture til I can get the text to show up =\r\nmore sharply.\n\nSmaller photo: http://i42.photobucket.com/albums/e328/Fuchsi=\r\nasBucket/JapanCollection/emperorhiromichism.jpg\n\nLarger photo: http://i42.p=\r\nhotobucket.com/albums/e328/FuchsiasBucket/JapanCollection/emperorhiromichi.=\r\njpg\n\nCheers, and I have been enjoying reading everyone&#39;s posts on these sub=\r\njects lately. I just cannot keep up with it.\n\nBest wishes,\nOnnamusha\n\n--- I=\r\nn samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Steven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, the most immediate one that comes to mind are the Kumazawa.=\r\n=C2=A0 That was the family that attempted to peacefully reinstate themselve=\r\ns during WW2.=C2=A0 That family is authorized and legitimized as being vali=\r\nd heirs of the southern court. \n&gt; =C2=A0As for supporters ?=C2=A0 Most of t=\r\nhe supporters would go on to serve the Hatakeyama officially, but held a &quot;t=\r\nhe south will rise again&quot; mentality, even to the point of supporting and in=\r\n some cases, intermarrying with legit southern court bloodlines.=C2=A0And t=\r\nhen, as we all know, all of these families would eventually end up serving =\r\nOda and Toyotomi in some capacity..etc.etc. \n\n\n\n\n"
