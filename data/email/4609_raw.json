You go down a tube, travel,\nand come out another one. It throws off all perception\nof distance. When I actually started riding my bike to\nwork, it was amazing to see how close everything was. \n\n&gt;  &gt; The cool thing\n&gt; &gt; was, I saw my house!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thou suckest. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\nPerks of the job...sorry man.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
