If Hirotada had \nexchanged Okazaki for his son, he would have lost control of Mikawa \naltogether (I would guess), so perhaps Hirotada thought he either \nloses his son, or he loses everything.\n\nNobuhide might have decided it was worth hanging on to the child to\nuse as a pawn in other bargains.\n\nInteresting that fate later decreed that it was Ieyasu who would\nsacrifice his firstborn son to preserve the alliance with Nobunaga.\n\nKarma, as they say?\n\nI&#39;d be interested to know the novel, too - I assume it&#39;s in Japanese?\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
