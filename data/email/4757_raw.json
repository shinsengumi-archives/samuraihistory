I&#39;ve been searching around, but cant really find any info on \n&gt; Fusaie or why he also held the title.  anyone know?\n\nKanpaku is not a unique title. It&#39;s like asking about Benjamin Harrison having \nheld the title of president, which Abraham Lincoln is known to have had. Lincoln \nwasn&#39;t the only one, and neither was Hideyoshi -- not by a long shot.\n\nA kanpaku the regent for an adult emperor (some translate it as Chancellor). \nSince the office was instituted the late 9th century, there have been  over 200 \nkanpaku appointmemnts (I was counting, and stopped at 100 when there was at \nleast another page of small typed names).\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
