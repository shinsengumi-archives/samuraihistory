The answer to that question is not clear cut.  Depending on the time period it did happen but the owners of land were not really warriors persay, but aristocrats who put the care of their land in the hands of warrior families.  This period is known as &quot;the low overcoming the high&quot; this did not happen to all families as some took care of their land themselves or had very loyal &quot;retainers&quot; (Iknow its not the best word for the period but its simple).  This was early on in samurai history and like Tom said would take alot of study to understand and to much space to explain but it is possible, depending.  I know this is simplified but hopefully it will help you to get a simple picture.\nMusashi\n  Tom Helm &lt;toryu@...&gt; wrote: The best answer to your questions is &quot;yes but...&quot;\n\n    There are many examples of retainers usurping power from their lords, depending on the period, the circumstance and the result we view them as honorable or dishonorable. It isn&#39;t cut and dried. The &quot;but&quot; is a big one and what is needed is a good deal of study, a simple answer really isn&#39;t possible.\nTom\n\n\nYahoo!
