What?\n\nIt&#39;s good practice, with good reason, to be suspicious of secondary sources \nwhich don&#39;t list specific references, such as notes.  This book doesn&#39;t have \nany notes, so far as I can remember.  It has a bibliography, but I saw no \ndocumentation notes.  That by itself doesn&#39;t make it a poor work, but it&#39;s a \nwarning sign I&#39;ve learned to heed in my own academic career.\n\nTodd\n\n\n\n&gt;From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 206\n&gt;Date: 11 Feb 2002 12:02:45 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;---\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;There is 1 message in this issue.\n&gt;\n&gt;Topics in this digest:\n&gt;\n&gt;       1.

What?\n&gt;\n&gt;--- Todd Archer &lt;todda39@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi, Folks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m looking for some scholarly opinion on the\n&gt; &gt; secondary source, &quot;Secrets of\n&gt; &gt; the Samurai&quot; by Ratti and Westbrook.  A google\n&gt; &gt; search brought to my\n&gt; &gt; attention lots of positive reviews and mentions from\n&gt; &gt; bookstores and people\n&gt; &gt; who seem to be students of various martial arts, but\n&gt; &gt; not from any source I\n&gt; &gt; would consider authoritative on the subject of\n&gt; &gt; Japanese cultural history; I\n&gt; &gt; could find no academic reviews.  While the book has\n&gt; &gt; a fairly large\n&gt; &gt; bibliography as I recall, and does mention, I think,\n&gt; &gt; something called the\n&gt; &gt; Historia Nipponica in the credits, I don&#39;t remember\n&gt; &gt; seeing any footnotes,\n&gt; &gt; page references to other sources, or endnotes; this\n&gt; &gt; lack set off a warning\n&gt; &gt; bell.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, does anyone here know anything about how well\n&gt; &gt; received this work is by\n&gt; &gt; historians and scholars?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any advice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Todd\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print\n&gt; &gt; your photos:\n&gt; &gt; http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
