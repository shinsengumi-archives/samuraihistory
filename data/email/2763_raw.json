By 1575\nthe Japanese were using firearms on the battlefield to\ngreater effect than Europeans, and on a much more\nmassive scale. The only reason Europeans surpassed the\nJapanese by the time the two civilizations re-engaged\nin the 1800&#39;s is that the Japanese had 200 years of\npeace, no warfare, so no reason to adapt and change\nthe way they did things. ONce they saw that need, they\ndid, and defeated a major European power shortly\nthereafter (1904-05, Russia). \n\n--- CRAZ &lt;crazoftheages@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m not deeply versed on the subject of specific\n&gt; formations and the like, but I do know I have about\n&gt; 8\n&gt; jpg&#39;s\n\n warfare spoken of in such a negative fashion these\n&gt; days.  It used to be left at &quot;the Japanese were more\n&gt; specialized and better at personal combat whereas\n&gt; the\n&gt; Europeans were better at keeping order and mass\n&gt; combat&quot;, but even that is being challenged these\n&gt; days\n&gt; by people who insist in the superiorty of European\n&gt; fencing, unarmed combat and actually have the gull\n&gt; to\n&gt; compare the european sword to the katana.\n&gt; \n&gt; I could rant on, but I&#39;ll do that some other time.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New Yahoo!
