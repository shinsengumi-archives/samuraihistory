The effect of it was that, in time of need, \nwhen some thugs attempted to assault me and take my money late at night, it \nwas just instinctive. I was not thinking in what do do if the thief do this \nor that, or in technical therms when fighting for my life. Things just went \nnaturally before I even knew what was really happening and the thugs got out \nof there, and I was no black belt, much less any kind of &quot;super martial arts \nmaster&quot; to do anything in special. \nJust an standard trainner as any other student. \n\nSo, I know it is very far than what those of ancient called as &quot;sharpness in \nsoul&quot;, but it is a pratical example, and one does not need to believe in \n&quot;magick&quot; to perform that.

That said \n&gt;there is MORE of a tendency to take pride in your work simply for the sake \n&gt;of doing your job well than you encounter in the West. There is more \nrespect \n&gt;for the craftsman. But a TRUE craftsman, whether it&#39;s swords, armour, \n&gt;weaving, cooking, carpentry, even chadou FOCUSES. It is the MIND not the \n&gt;soul. If you believe Robert Mcpherson or J.D. Hrosilous (sp?) don&#39;t focus \nat \n&gt;the same level of armourers and swordsmiths in Japan you are sorely \n&gt;mistaken. Also if you think the average Japanese focuses well you should \nsee \n&gt;all the idiots trying to ride bicycles while reading e-mail on thier keitai \n&gt; Perhaps this is because we DO tend to over-intellectualize things in the \n&gt;West. My poor Japanese HAS forced me to use ishin denshin while studying \n&gt;Kyuudo, but my focus is the same it has been for years while armouring or \n&gt;training in different martial art systems. \n&gt; Side observation. It often seems that the people who believe (key word \n&gt;believe) in the &quot;Mystical East&quot; are people who would LIKE to believe in \n&gt;magic but have too much sense yet are too much of the romantic to give up \n&gt;the idea that there is SOMETHING more so they transfer that desire to a far \n&gt;distant and strange land. I undestand that hope. I shared it when I was \nmuch \n&gt;younger, but I have travelled too much and seen too much to give it any \n&gt;credence. \n&gt; \n&gt;M.J.Peters \n\n_________________________________________________________\nVoce quer um iGMail protegido contra v�rus e spams? \nClique aqui: http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\nOfertas imperd�veis!
