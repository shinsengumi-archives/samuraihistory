Ieyasu and Hideyoshi were clearly in \nvassalage positions to Nobunaga (allies and vassals are very different things); \nand Ieyasu chose to put himself in a vassalage relationship to Hideyoshi rather \nthan keep fighting him. The choice was vassalage or enmity; there was no \nalliance option.\n\n&gt; It signalled the ending of the &#39;sengoku&#39;.These three were Oda\n&gt; Nobunaga,Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Ieasu Tokugawa;all of them were great\n&gt; generals in their own right.They formed alliance to bring Japan to gradual\n&gt; unification.\n\nNot really accurate, I&#39;m afraid.\n\n&gt; Nobunaga was assasinated by one of his generals but Hideyoshi\n&gt; continued what Nobunaga began.After he avenged the death of  Nobunaga he\n&gt; worked to establish firm control of his rein in power.Though a brillant\n&gt; military genius Hideyoshi could not claim the title of shogun because of his\n&gt; humble origins.\n\nIronically, the title of Kanpaku -- which he did take -- is vastly more exalted \nthan Shogun. At least in terms of imperial connection and relationship with the \nthrone.\n\n&gt; Actually he is a peasant from Totomi,also the province of\n&gt; Nobunaga;and became foot soldier in Nobunaga&#39;s army.He was promoted to become\n&gt; a military commander because of his spectacular brillance.Before his death he\n&gt; appointed Ieasu as one of the! regents to his young son Hideyori.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Hideyoshi died it marked another beginning in the fortune of the office\n&gt; of the Shogun.The Tokugawa Ieasu did not keep up to the promise of becoming a\n&gt; protector to the heir of Hideyoshi.Ieasu being too concerned of the supremacy\n&gt; of his family against all the other daimyos when he led an army with a\n&gt; coalition of western daimyo, attacked the eastern daimyo under another regent\n&gt; appointed by Hideyoshi for his son named Ishida.\n\nAgain, not quite. Ieyasu was the leader of the EASTERN alliance. Mitsunari was \ncalling the shots (although the nominal leader was M�ri Motonari) of the Western \nalliance. And Mitsunari had never been one of the regents.\n\nHideyoshi appointed a council of five elders (the go-tair�) to run things and \ntake care of Hideyori and see to his later rule. These five were the most \npowerful daimy� in Japan. He also appointed a council of five officials (the \ngo-bugy�) to deal with other matters. These were people Hideyoshi generally \ntrusted, but didn&#39;t have the political or financial sway than the elders did. \nMitsunari was one of the latter.\n\n&gt; This took place in the battle\n&gt; of Sekigahara.After this battle where he emerged as the victor,Ieasu took for\n&gt; himself the tiltle of shogun.\n\nNo, he didn&#39;t. The emperor appointed him sh�gun in 1603 (three years after the \nbattle). You can&#39;t TAKE the title of sh�gun any more than any other \nimperially-awarded office or rank.\n\n&gt; This did not pose any difficulty for him since\n&gt; he is of a Minamoto lineage.\n\nWell, maybe. The fact of his multiple genealogies -- with different backgrounds \n(Taira, Minamoto, Fujiwara, what have you) is well documented. In this case, the \nMinamoto one was more useful, and became the &quot;official&quot; one. :)\n\nHe obliged the court to sanction his claim.The\n&gt; title was later passed to his son and down to his descendants until the late\n&gt; 19th century.The offfice of the Shogun was later abolished under the Meiji\n&gt; restoration.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was during the Tokugawa period that the daimyo were classified into two\n&gt; categories: the &#39;fudai-daimyo&#39; & the &#39;to-zama daimyo&#39;.\n\nIf I&#39;m not mistaken, Hideyoshi also used that distinction to identify those who \nwere his vassals and those who were his Vassals -- people who&#39;d been with him \nsince day one vs. those who joined up later.\n\n&gt; The former literally\n&gt; means &#39;heridetary-vassal lords&#39; which implies that they were a family of\n&gt; former Tokugawa vassals and more trusted daimyo while the latter literally\n&gt; means &#39;outside lords&#39; which implies that they belong to a class of daimyo who\n&gt; have not yet gained the complete trust of the Tokugawa.\n\nSpecifically, fudai were those who were vassals *before* Sekigahara, and \neveryone else -- even those who had been allies then but not vassals -- were \ntozama. There&#39;s also a third category of daimy�: shinpan. These were daimyo who \nwere related by blood to the Tokugawa/Matsudaira house. A small, but very \ninfluential, group, the shinpan.\n\nThe Tokugawa house itself was broken into three branches: the Kii, Owari, and \nMito Tokugawa (the &quot;go-sanke&quot;), which were set to provide an heir for the \nshogunal seat if the main line of Ieyasu&#39;s son Hidetada failed to produce an \nheir. A few times (including the last sh�gun), the heir came from one of the \nbranches. (In fact, one branch itself branched off to form a further three \nsub-houses.)\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
