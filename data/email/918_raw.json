Silly me \nnot\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; seeing in first place.  The site is in Japanese but the links \nare \n&gt; &gt; clear and there is english Language, it is part of the Yasaki \nInari \n&gt; &gt; shrine, and it has many excellent pictures. Link is \n&gt; &gt; www.tctv.ne.jp/uma490/ I hope it works this time.  Anyhow I am \nglad\n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; found this topic as I am finding out loads of interesting \nstuff.  \n&gt; &gt; Soon I want to create a website focusing on the samurai hats and \n&gt; &gt; their history and function, it is a bit off the wall but if \nanyone \n&gt; &gt; has pics of samurai hats, can be helmets but mostly civilian and \n&gt; &gt; military head wear.  So if any one has any pi ctures I would \n&gt; &gt; appreciate them very much.  I have found lots in Ukiyo-e. This\n&gt; should \n&gt; &gt; also help Melvin and everyone else for that matter.  Japaense \nHats \n&gt; &gt; rock ^^^^^^^^. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Go to http://www.sengokudaimyo.com and follow the clothing link.\n&gt; There&#39;s a page (in the works) on headgear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\nTony, \nGreetings and Thank you for going out of your way to refer me to \nAnthony Bryant&#39;s website on Japanese medieval information. I have \nstarted going through it and it is very amazing. I hve never seen a \nwebsite like what he got. That greatly helped me. I have always been \nan afficionado on anything about Japanese medieval history since my \nyounger days. This start surely rekindle my interest on this matter.\nAgain, &quot;Salamat&quot; the filipino word of Thank You and &quot;Mabuhay&quot;(long \nlive to all guys and girls like you who share this unique interest.\nMelvin\n\n\n"
