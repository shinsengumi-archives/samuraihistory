Under the Tokugawa and \nearlier Shoguns they were privileged members of the Bakufu and their \nstatus as &quot;Bushi&quot;, unquestioned. Today they still carry on the family \ntraditions and live lives little changed from those earlier times. \nThere are other people who live austere lifestyles unchanged from \nbefore the days of Ieyasu.\n\tI am convinced that even though these people have the pedigree and \nwalk the walk ( and talk the talk...) they would never call themselves \n&quot;samurai&quot; or more properly &quot;Bushi&quot;.  Were I to say &quot;you ARE samurai&quot;, \nthey would politely laugh and correct me. There are no more &quot;Samurai&quot;.\n\tKeeping in mind the harsh reality that was pre-Modern Japan, I would \nsay that they are something much better...\n-t\n\n\n"
