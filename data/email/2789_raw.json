It bugs me too when people take stuff like Highlander\n&gt; and the Last Samurai and Glory and are suddendly historical experts.\n&gt; But there&#39;s something to fantasy and fiction, and I mean, Braveheart\n&gt; and The Last Samurai, while being historically innaccurate, are\n&gt; pretty good movies.\n\nI would push it even a bit further. I do not believe they are \n&quot;inaccurate.&quot; Inaccurate would be something that wants to be \nhistorically accurate but it&#39;s not. Here we talk about plain historical \nFICTION. The two main characters of &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; are NOT \nhistorical characters, so, to expect accuracy is a paradox. This is a \nmajor Hollywood production that entertains for a couple of hours, and \nthat&#39;s it. It has been done to make $$$, and features one of the most \npopular actors in the world. It&#39;s not a cult-movie for a bunch of \nscholars of the samurai. So, take it or leave it, but if we criticize \nthe movie, we should do so thinking of what the movie IS, not what we \nwould like the movie TO BE.\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
