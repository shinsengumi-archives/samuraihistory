It&#39;s based on \n&gt;modern/western sensibilities to reach the conclusion that &quot;Nobunaga \n&gt;was a villain&quot;. This philosophy really is not that popular \n&gt;in Japan. \n&gt; \n&gt;As several people have noted, including the original poster, \n&gt;&quot;Nobunaga as villain&quot; is something you might see in computer or \n&gt;video cames coming out of Japan. It also exists in some other \n&gt;&quot;pop&quot; kinds of entertainment. \n&gt; \n&gt;But in most Japanese sources, Nobunaga is not seen as a villain. His \n&gt;more over-the-top things that in our day and age are quite shocking, \n&gt;were even shocking when they happened. But the overall impression \n&gt;is not Nobunaga as villain, but for the most part, Nobunaga as \n&gt;heroic figure. \n&gt; \n&gt;-- \n&gt;Jay Kelly \n&gt;oyakata@... \n&gt; \n\n_________________________________________________________\nVoce quer um iGMail protegido contra v�rus e spams? \nClique aqui: http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\nOfertas imperd�veis!
