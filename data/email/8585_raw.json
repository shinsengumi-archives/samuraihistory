The Japanese culture is ridden with many\n&gt; strange concepts, my mother believes some really strange things. \n&gt; But if I wasn&#39;t affected, I wouldn&#39;t be asking.  I do not believe in\n&gt; most things, but this is not a joke.I also have 2 grown daughters\n&gt; that are affected by this curse.  Also my brother and 2 sisters. \n&gt; It&#39;s not possible for all of us to have common ailments, all\n&gt; obtained in different manners.  I still have family in Japan, they\n&gt; have come her to the states and the language barrier is a true\n&gt; obstacle.  The ways of life that they have is so different than what\n&gt; we have here.  So don&#39;t make light of it, it just shows your\n&gt; ignorance.  \n\nNo, it shows that I live in the real world where the sky is \nBLUE.\n\n&gt; All I want is to know if it&#39;s possible to reverse it. \n\nI&#39;d recommend contacting that Crossing Over guy. He&#39;s more \nlikely not to make funny faces and roll his eyes, is \nprobably more than happy to take a consulting fee, and might \neven come up with something (the old &quot;egg in a sock under \nyour pillow&quot; is a good traditional one) that might work for you.\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
