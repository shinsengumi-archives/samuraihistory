And a lot (all?) is written in non cursive characters and \ntherefore should be fairly easily translated into English.\n\nEdy suggested I should do some translation However as I have very limited spare time due \nto our heavy &quot;Japanese style&quot; workload. I do not want to have the responsibility . Maybe \nsome other member with more time could acquire this item and do a more in depth study? \n\nThe bid is only $ 80 (a major bargain!) so I think nearly anybody can afford it? I would love \nto own the manuscript and add it to my collection, but due to time constraints I could not \nshare the info contained therein with other people. I feel somebody who would be more \nserious about doing the research would be the proper custodian of this artwork.\n\nAnybody have an idea of who the author /samurai Teijo could be? \n\nDoes anybody know about similar manuscripts in any of the major museums or libraries? I \nhave checked the most obvious references, such as British Museum, British Library aso., \nbut I haven&#39;t been able to find anything similar.\n\nAnders Rikardson\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Edward Alexander &lt;edyhiphop@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; It&#39;s a gold mine.I think you should buy it.It&#39;&#39;s very old but it&#39;s worth it.If you can give us \nsome paragraphs from it I think we could solve some of our problems here related to \nsamurai warfare.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Edy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Anders Rikardson &lt;japaneseart@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I am considering bidding on a samurai manuscript up for auction at \n&gt; www.auctionukiyoe.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can somebody give further information about this kind of manuscript. I live in Tokyo \nand \n&gt; usually go to the antiquarian booksellers district at least once a week and I have never \n&gt; seen anything similar.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anders R\n&gt; Tokyo\n&gt; PS. Auction description:\n&gt; *Artist: Teijo\n&gt; *Format: Ehon: 9.75&quot; x 6.5&quot;\n&gt; *Subject: This type of book was never printed, but always hand written and copied from \n&gt; generation to generation as the information therein was considered strategically \nsensitive \n&gt; and secret not to be disseminated outside the Samurai class. Also the books often \n&gt; contained details of family secrets in warfare. Few complete copies have survived.\n&gt; *Date: c. 1820\n&gt; *Condition: Full size. Some light creases and wear. Generally very good state.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
