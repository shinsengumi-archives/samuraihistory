By the sixth month, the battle is \nwon, and Munetsuna flees the province.  They depart for Kai on 6/4, \nand on the journey back, on 6/14, Shingen, along with his Ashigaru, \ndrive Nobutora off, and he was forced to flee to Imagawa Yoshimoto, \nin Suruga (Yoshimoto was married to one of Nobutora&#39;s daughters).\n\nThe second version goes like this:\n\nIn the 6th month of 1541, Nobutora and Harunobu (shingen) went to \nvisit Nobutora&#39;s daughter, who was married to Imagawa Yoshimoto, in \nSuruga province.  Little did Nobutora know, Yoshimoto and Shingen had \nplotted against him. When they got there, Nobutora was forcibly \nretired in favor of Shingen, and he was put under the &quot;patronage&quot; of \nYoshimoto.\n\nI am not sure why there are two versions, one seems to come from a \nspecific historical record, maybe the other comes from more than one \nsources.  does anyone know which is more likely?\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\nYahoo!
