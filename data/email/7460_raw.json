In the section \n&gt; &gt; called &quot;Ueda Castle&quot;, on page 43 the sentence\n&gt; reads\n&gt; &gt; &quot;He was under \n&gt; &gt; orders to &quot;mask&quot; the loyalist stronghold of Ueda\n&gt; &gt; castle...&quot;.  I have an \n&gt; &gt; idea what is meant by bask but could anyone\n&gt; (author\n&gt; &gt; included) clarify \n&gt; &gt; that term for me?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, the Sanada Masayuki is the same as the\n&gt; Takeda\n&gt; &gt; general... correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Masking&quot; is the same as &quot;guarding&quot; or &quot;covering&quot; in\n&gt; a\n&gt; modern military doctrinal context--the idea was to\n&gt; leave a force strong enough to prevent the Sanada\n&gt; from\n&gt; leaving Ueda Castle and attacking the the Tokugawa\n&gt; main bottle in the rear.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
