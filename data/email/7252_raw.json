I dont know If i should laugh or cry, I own an apple tree do you\nthink im at risk from a 47 ronin style attack?\n\n  Kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:Way of the samurai\ncan be anywhere\n  Jerry Greene\n  KISSIMMEE -- What can you do?\n\n  You got some unique skill? I used to know some folks who got\n  together every year and clucked the William Tell Overture. You know,\n  just like chickens. But I lost track of them, hard as that might\n  seem.\n\n  The clucking always seemed a little silly, but this is not. Sensei\n  Bradley Knight just returned from Japan, where he set a record by\n  slicing 21 apples in midair with his sword in 60 seconds. That&#39;s\n  toss an apple, draw his sword, slice the apple, sheath his sword and\n  toss again. The Guinness World Records people are processing it now.\n\n  &quot;In a way, it is a stunt,&quot; Knight said, &quot;but it displays the\n  training needed to target an object accurately and quickly.&quot;\n\n  Trust me, there&#39;s no need to travel to distant corners of the globe\n  to find exotic events and alternative lifestyles. Look around us.\n  The unusual is everywhere.\n\n  Try 980 E. Carroll Street, the location of the Tiger&#39;s Den school of\n  karate training led by sensei Knight. The day we visited, he was\n  working with children of various ages. They don&#39;t work with swords,\n  but it was a special treat for them to watch Knight demonstrate his\n  skill for our photographer.\n\n  Besides, who doesn&#39;t like a slice of apple?\n\n  Knight, a youthful-looking 35, took eight of his adult students with\n  him to Japan, where the apple slicing was a part of an enriching\n  trip.\n\n  &quot;The whole thing was amazing,&quot; said Phil Powell, a student who was\n  the first to slice and dice, cutting 14. &quot;I was in heaven for a\n  couple of minutes.&quot;\n\n  The demonstration was covered by seven Japanese camera crews and\n  three newspapers. Another TV crew followed Knight and his students\n  for the rest of their trip to document &quot;the American samurai.&quot;\n\n  The students went for the overall experience, but Knight went for\n  additional training from his 76-year-old teacher, who sliced 18\n  apples in 60 seconds to prove he&#39;s hardly lost it.\n\n  &quot;It&#39;s a shame in our culture that there isn&#39;t more respect shown for\n  our elders,&quot; Knight said. &quot;So often, it&#39;s just &#39;Get out of here, old\n  man,&#39; when we can learn so much.&quot;\n\n  I like this man.\n\n  Another topic had to be broached -- the movies. What does someone\n  think about the popular martial arts films if he really knows what\n  can and cannot be done?\n\n  &quot;My wife gets upset when I start to complain during the movie,&quot;\n  Knight admitted. &quot;It&#39;s not magic. Like Crouching Tiger, Hidden\n  Dragon, all the flying through the air. They&#39;d have to be\n  superhuman.&quot;\n\n  He did like the Kill Bill flicks, pointing out that most of the\n  stunts were possible. &quot;The only thing is that if the girl in the\n  lead did all those things, she would be really tired.&quot;\n\n  Knight, meanwhile, seems at peace with his life. His parents live in\n  Kissimmee, and he finds nothing strange about teaching his skills on\n  a quiet street in Central Florida to classes that include about one\n  woman for every two men.\n\n  &quot;We try to learn how to avoid altercation but be prepared if it\n  happens,&quot; Knight said.\n\n  As for the impending Guinness record for apple slicing?\n\n  &quot;Before I had the record, it seemed like a big thing. Now, not so\n  much. It&#39;s a steppingstone,&quot; he said.\n\n  Footnote: When you enter the Tiger&#39;s Den, you must remove your\n  shoes. I do the same thing at home, mainly because I hate to wear\n  shoes. But it&#39;s nice to know that the American samurai and I are\n  actually so much alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest:\n  http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---\n\n\n\n  ---------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
