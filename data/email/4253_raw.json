I don&#39;t even \n&gt;think annexing Hawaii was a US decision.  \n&gt;\nYep, it was a coup that the US backed.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Michael Peters&quot; &lt;shdwstel@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;  The Japanese of today are NOT the japanese on 70 years ago. \n&gt;\nThis is so true, we are also not the Americans of the period as well. \nJapanese tenant farmers were still little better than slaves. Their \nlifestyle had not changed since the Tokugawa bakafu decided to squeeze \nthem. In many ways all but the urban elite and the military were still \nfairly bad off. In many ways it was a continuation of the fuedal state \nwith technology thrown in. It&#39;s the ugly ending of the military classes \nas rulers of Japan.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"
