I love his early\n&gt; books like Dance, \n&gt; Dance, Dance and The Hardboiled Wonderland and the\n&gt; End of the \n&gt; World. \n\nYou&#39;re right, he&#39;s a great writer. I read some of his\nworks in italian.\n\n\n\n&gt; I think it&#39;s really important in coming to\n&gt; understand a culture to read \n&gt; widely in its literature - especially if you want to\n&gt; write about it. I was \n&gt; reminded again last night, watching Aoyama&#39;s film\n&gt; Eureka, how \n&gt; different Japanese narrative style is from Western -\n&gt; which is why some \n&gt; people find Japanese novels hard going. \n\nIt is so. I think it&#39;s very interesting to compare the\ncultures, and to understand the differences, the\ncommon points, or the affinity.\n\n\nIt&#39;s worth\n&gt; thinking yourself \n&gt; into the necessary different mindset. And just to\n&gt; try reading in kanji is \n&gt; worth it too, to realise the vividness and graphic\n&gt; nature of this way of \n&gt; writing.\n\nI&#39;ve never try that, but I think that is very\ndifficult. \n\n\n&gt; Lili and the other writers, I&#39;ve had a sort of\n&gt; historical fantasy published \n&gt; recently set in an alternative mediaeval world based\n&gt; on Japan. It&#39;s \n&gt; under the pseudonym Lian Hearn and is called Tales\n&gt; of the Otori. Our \n&gt; excellent moderator was kind enough to post the\n&gt; first chapter of the \n&gt; first book some time ago. If there&#39;s anything I can\n&gt; help you with in \n&gt; discussing some of the issues involved in writing\n&gt; this sort of novel \n&gt; perhaps you would like to contact me off board. I&#39;m\n&gt; going away in 10 \n&gt; days but will try to reply before then.\n\nThanks. I&#39;m not here to long time, so I haven&#39;t read\nthis novel. I hope to find it in passed mails. \n\n\n\n=====\nElisa\n\n&quot;L&#39;esuberanza ï¿½ bellezza&quot; (W.Blake)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
