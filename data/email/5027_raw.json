I&#39;d like to\n&gt;  make it as real and accurate as possible, even though it is a fantasy\n&gt;  world, and some of the questions I have might have instructive\n&gt;  answers for the list people.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The questions I&#39;d like to start off with are:\n&gt;\n&gt;  1. What were the penalties (if any, social or otherwise) of women\n&gt;  dressing like men, and men dressing like women, in Japanese culture\n&gt;  of that time?\nIzumo no Okuni (a woman)became famous for doing just that, at the very \nend of the Azuchi-momoyama period. Dressed as a man sporting a \ncrucifix, and a pair of gaudy swords, she was a huge hit. She founded a \nvery famous theatre tradition. I suggest that you do a search for her, \nI am sure you will get lots of wonderful info as well as the answer you \nseek.\n&gt;\n&gt;  2. When did revenge killing become illegal, and what were the\n&gt;  penalties?\n\tNot sure it was outlawed but was highly &quot;legislated&quot; in the Tokugawa \nperiod. Under the right circumstances you could be rewarded for it. The \nAko-roshi are an excellent example, they did everything right but \nbecause at the very heart of their action was rebellion against the \nBakufu they were sentenced to death.\n\tSee &quot;Tales of Samurai Honour&quot; (by Callaghan I think it is) for some \ninteresting background and stories dealing with Adauchi.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  3. What would be the penalties for killing a shogun, and likely\n&gt;  repercussions politically of a shogun&#39;s murder?\nSee Nate&#39;s excellent post...\n&gt;\n&gt;  4. When did a sword without a tsuba (yes, I&#39;ll say it, like Lucy\n&gt;  Liu&#39;s sword in Kill Bill) become acceptable, if it ever did?\n&gt;\n\n(Never say never) One of the most gifted and interesting of the Sengoku \nDaimyo was Uesugi Kenshin. He is known to have cherished the work of \nBizen smiths and the great swordsmith Nagamitsu especially, he had \nseveral bona-fide blades. All mounted as tachi, all mounted WITHOUT \ntsuba. This style is not called aikuchi-koshirae which is used for \ntanto but rather Uesugi-koshirae. It was unusual but not unheard of. I \nthink one finds it easier to draw and return a sword of greater length \nwithout the tsuba and some have pointed to his example as evidence that \na tsuba is a &quot;hand stop and not a hand guard...&quot;\n-t\n\nI have also heard it said that many soldiers removed their guards \nbefore going into battle.\n\n\n"
