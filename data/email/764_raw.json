Would I want to fight a battle with them?  Hell\n&gt;NO!!!\n&gt;Being a genius at a strategic game would simply make one\n&gt;overconfident and that would be your downfall.  The marks of a\n&gt;great military mind, include the abilities to; read the motivations\n&gt;of others, to be able to manipulate them to your will, and if they\n&gt;choose not to bend to your will, force them into another pit that\n&gt;you have made for them.  Can I do any of that?\n&gt;The answer is no again.  I&#39;d have to lie, cheat, and steal (E.G.\n&gt;Modern Military assets at my disposal but not at thiers).  Then\n&gt;and only then would I even stand a glimmer of hope.  Maybe I&#39;m\n&gt;just a retard but I wouldn&#39;t even be able to keep my cool ..I&#39;d\n&gt;probably pull a Katsuyori. :P\n&gt;\n&gt;Brandon\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@y..., lee thompson &lt;cmotdibbleruk@y...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Who else here would like to challenge Nobunaga or Sun tzu to\n&gt;a game of chess? or a multiplayer on Total War?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Who thinks they would win?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lee\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Get personalised at My Yahoo!.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n\n"
