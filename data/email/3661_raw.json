And - to make things clearer, Ako had 380 samurai:\nonly 47 sacrificed their lives...&lt;&lt;\n\nActually no. The Bito article mentioned below lists four other similar\ninstances before the Ako story. Albeit the Ako one is the most elaborate and\nthe most famous.\n\n&gt; Is it true the only 48 were given a samurai&#39;s death?\n\n&gt;&gt;As far as I know, they were 47+one who gave up the night before (to\nbonk repeatedly his girlfriend). The 47 committed ritual seppuku, the\nbonker just killed himself in a backstreet of Edo.&lt;&lt;\n\nActually it was 46. One member Terasaka Kichiemon was missing. What happened\nto him is a matter of great debate; some argue he ran away at the last\nmoment, others say he was ordered away by Oishi to report either to Asano&#39;s\nbrother or widow.\n\n.&gt; I&#39;d be grateful for any relevant information.\n&gt;\n&gt; Keyoke.\n\nI would strongly recommend a series of articles in last years Monumenta\nNipponica starting with issue 58:1. The first by Henry Smith was a general\noverview, the second by Bito Masahide is a history of the incident. More\narticles on other aspects of the story are promised.\n\n\n"
