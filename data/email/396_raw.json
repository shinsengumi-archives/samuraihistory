Then you have the\nnerve to say that they should be &quot;sensitivity&quot; when\nrebuking responses.  I am not even sure who you are\nresponding to but just chill out man.  No one here has\never said that there info was more valid.  This is a\ndiscussion group anyway right.  People put stuff up\nand others respond.  the only one getting all upset is\nyou...  If you are going to put up a response that has\nto do with your side of a argument please do so. \nHowever if you are going to critisize how others\nrespond and what they respond with please just join\nanother group.  You asked the question whether the\nperson you are responding to is ten years old.  You\nare the one obviously offended and not able to control\nyourself.  Are You ten years old????  Please if you\nhave some response to a question someone sends or a\ndisagreement with info that is sent feel free to\nrespond but stop insulting and sending responses that\nhave no value to the group as a whole.\n\nMusashi\n\n\n--- &quot;Alexander M. Frazier&quot; &lt;punish10@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; KUMO ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you ten years old?\n&gt; If you disagree with someone, so be it, but that was\n&gt; the rudest display of\n&gt; adolescent behavior I have seen in a very long time.\n&gt; Show some respect.\n&gt; People from various martial arts are passed verbal\n&gt; transmissions of their\n&gt; &quot;history&quot; and the reasons for various traditions\n&gt; revolving around that art.\n&gt; As mentioned in this diatribe, I am a student of\n&gt; Aikido. Daito ryu more\n&gt; specifically.\n&gt; In our art, the hakama is gifted to a shodan. It is\n&gt; believed by our shihan\n&gt; that the hakama was worn for both ceremony and ease\n&gt; of movement for combat\n&gt; in an &quot;in-house&quot; circumstance.\n&gt; In another art there may have been different\n&gt; traditions or circumstances\n&gt; surrounding its use.\n&gt; However, regardless of any one teaching, you must\n&gt; consider the fact that the\n&gt; hakama was Japanese, not the tool of martial arts.\n&gt; It was worn by\n&gt; practitioners and &quot;lay&quot; folk alike. Martial arts all\n&gt; stemmed from India and\n&gt; developed into numerous styles over many generations\n&gt; throughout all of the\n&gt; orient, taking on various characteristics by each\n&gt; major clan and teacher.\n&gt; The hakama was just a garment that simply followed\n&gt; the Japanese during their\n&gt; day, and when one clan broke from another ... or one\n&gt; family divided and\n&gt; became two ... when they moved on they took their\n&gt; hakamas with them. Perhaps\n&gt; after the fact each determined that it had certain\n&gt; combative attributes. Who\n&gt; can truly say?\n&gt; I know that YOU weren&#39;t there any more than Eric\n&gt; was, so certainly you can&#39;t\n&gt; answer the question with any more authority than he\n&gt; could.\n&gt; In any case, people have different reasons for the\n&gt; things they think and\n&gt; believe, and not all of it is rootless. Unless YOU\n&gt; are the expert on all\n&gt; these matters, which I do not believe you are, try\n&gt; to have a little\n&gt; sensitivity in rebuking information you BELIEVE is\n&gt; incorrect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alex\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;KUM0&quot; &lt;kum0@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 6:22 PM\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: The ignorant\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mr. Baker,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am sorry\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do not be sorry, for you cannot change. And would\n&gt; not where it even for\n&gt; the better.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of my life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A commendable time spent learning. Kudos.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have to disagree.  There are all kinds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise\n&gt; movement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or position.  This is simply not true.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Did you invent the Hakama and devise it&#39;s uses? I\n&gt; believe that you didn&#39;t.\n&gt; You only know of it&#39;s uses inside Budo as you learn\n&gt; it,\n&gt; &gt; and are in no position to comment on any other\n&gt; arts uses of the hakama.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when going in to combat without armor preffered\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As does anybody with an ounce of common sense.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed full movement without tripping on the\n&gt; hakama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; itself.(anyone who practices Aikido has had this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree. This I have seen for myself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When wearing armor they didn&#39;t even wear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hakama so it did not apply.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, I don&#39;t believe that this paragraph has\n&gt; anything atall to do with\n&gt; the subject matter being discussed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Word &quot;ninja&quot; is not hstorically correct and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neither is their movie incarnation.  They were\n&gt; usually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reffered to as Shinobi and originally were not\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specialized as the movies make them appear. \n&gt; They were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used to set fire to enemy encampments and\n&gt; castles in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; order to cause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be employed to kill.  But I have heard of very\n&gt; few if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any cases with the latter.  A good book on the\n&gt; subject\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the origin and truths behind the &quot;Ninja&quot; is\n&gt; Stephen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold\n&gt; of and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has to be ordered from Europe but is worth the\n&gt; price.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are alot of myths regarding the history of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Martial arts.(Ninja Especially)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Who mentioned movies? Who mentioned historically\n&gt; correct details regarding\n&gt; the ninja? How would you be an authority on the\n&gt; ninja?\n&gt; &gt; You study Budo by your own admission. It is very\n&gt; rude by every cultures\n&gt; beliefs to denounce that of which you are ignorant.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And ignorant of such matters you are.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether the term &quot;Ninja&quot; appeared in Japan  _ever_\n&gt;  is no matter. Nowdays\n&gt; it is an accepted layman&#39;s term. Whether you like it\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; not. And the world will use it without you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have respect for the way of Bu, but not for you,\n&gt; because you are\n&gt; ignorant, and have no respect for anything but your\n&gt; own\n&gt; &gt; &quot;knowledge&quot;. Of which you probably know nothing\n&gt; outside of Budo teachings,\n&gt; and the odd bit of book reading here or there by\n&gt; authors\n&gt; &gt; who are also no authority on the subjects which\n&gt; they publish books on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is my last comment on the matter on the list,\n&gt; if you wish to comment\n&gt; youself, which you no doubt would accept to do\n&gt; without\n&gt; &gt; thought, then you have my e-mail address and have\n&gt; my invitation to mail me\n&gt; personally for any reason.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kumo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Natsu Kusa Ya\n&gt; &gt; Tsuamono Domo Ga\n&gt; &gt; Yume No Ato\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Basho Matsuo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: erik baker\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am sorry but I have practiced Budo for over 12\n&gt; years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of my life.
