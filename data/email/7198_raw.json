I&#39;v been out of town awhile and haven&#39;t checked my\n&gt; &gt; email recently. Now that you mention its a parody I still wonder why\n&gt; &gt; anyone would waste their time on creating a site that pokes fun at the\n&gt; &gt; perspective most Americans have of ninja. I mean will it change the\n&gt; &gt; attitude? Somebody&#39;s wasting their time I think.
