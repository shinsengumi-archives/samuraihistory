In response:\n\n1. Japanese-American History Archives - I&#39;ll c=\r\nheck it out.  My mother \nimmigrated to the US in 1958 (as my father&#39;s wife)=\r\n, and is the only \nJapanese born member of my family in the US.  Both have =\r\npassed, so \ngathering info is difficult.\n\n2.  Shimada kanji - My aunt write=\r\ns it as shima(island)-da(rice \npaddy).  The shima is &quot;=87, and the da(ta) i=\r\ns &quot;c.  They were living in \nthe Honjo area of Tokyo (Old Edo), at least in =\r\n1858 - I can&#39;t go back \nfurther yet.  I know they were/are Buddhist, but do=\r\nn&#39;t know what \nsect.  I can study that to see how to ask my aunt that quest=\r\nion, \nthough.  As a Christian, I have a general knowledge of Buddhism, but =\r\n\nnot a specific knowledge of its history in Japan.\n\n3. Mon - Thanks for exp=\r\nlaining the variations in how kamon have \ndeveloped- I will need to ask my =\r\naunt or other surviving family \nmembers if a family mon still exists.\n\n4. &quot;=\r\nOfficial&quot; Names - Thanks!\n\n5. Hatamoto - I knew who they were as a group, b=\r\nut I&#39;ll work with my \naunt to get more family information.  I have one gene=\r\nration of \nofficial Japanese family registry - perhaps there is a way to ge=\r\nt \nother older ones (they are quite delicate and elegant pieces of \npaper!)=\r\n.  I will also start working with and looking up some Japanese \ngeneology s=\r\nites and groups.\n\nYou have been very helpful!\n\nDoomo arigato,\n\nDave\n\n--- In=\r\n samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave, =\r\nI&#39;ll take a shot at this...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
