I ran across a page that listed the names of all 47 ronin and the specs on the weapons they carried.. hope this helps..\n&gt;\n\nUmmm... Josh?\n\nA shaku is almost *exactly* a foot. In fact, it&#39;s 11.93 inches. There are ten sun in a shaku, each about 1.19 inches. A bu is 3 milimeters... a miniscule length.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n"
