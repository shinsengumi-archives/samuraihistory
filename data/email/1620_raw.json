But even with that the first person to draw often wins. Also \ndue to the crossing of bodies lefty drawing from right and righty \nfrom left. Though there is one attack that it difficult drawing from \nsaya in R is the strike down to the left, as it is hard to get the \nblade all the way clear of the body. Where as the L doesn&#39;t have that \ntrouble.\n\nBut within something like Kendo, where the sword, shinai is already \ndrawn such thing would perhaps be an advantage( at the moment I am \nblanking on weither or not one puts the dominant hand closest to \nTsuba or not). There is also the question of phycological aspect, \noften, at least within styles of European fencing with both live and \npratice weapons, one&#39;s adversary often goes for the hand they would \nuse to fight with. As there are more rightys fighting rightys the \nobvious thing would be go for that hand/Arm.\n\nI also wonder if it is considered dishonorable to have the left be \nthe domainant hand( though I think Deo-san already covered that) I am \ngrateful for your advise and words.\n\nAtsi \n\n\n"
