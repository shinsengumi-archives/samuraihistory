When used for battle it was called Masakari or\nfuetsu (big axe) when used for wood cutting, ono.\n\n    The name (reading) masakari some believe comes from the similar sounding\n&quot;ma saki wari&quot; or &quot;cuts dead straight&quot;.\n\nIn ancient China an &quot;ono&quot; was presented by rulers to their lead generals as a\nsymbol of their commision to subdue enemy forces...\n\nThey were used to break down obstalces, bamboo fences and stakes, or to attack\nthe walls and gates of fortifications. (He places them as Kamakura period\nweapons-tch)\n\nThe kogata masakari had a 3 or 4 shaku handle with a 3 sun wide blade\n\nThe Omasakari had a 1shaku blade.\n\nThese are mentioned in the Taikeiki and other old chronicles...\n\n( I have seen these illustrated but never seen an actual &quot;masakari&quot; in any\nmuseum. There is a book on weapons that should have at least one example but I\ncan&#39;t seem to locate it-tch)\n\n\n\n\n"
