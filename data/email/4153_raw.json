Un=\r\nless, of course, peace is defined as the absence of opposition, by which an=\r\ny warlord and any warmonger may be shielded by the flag of peace. I can=B4t=\r\n recall to whom it is ascribed, but a very interesting quotation sums it up=\r\n: &quot;diplomacy is the art of saying =B4nice doggie, nice doggie=B4 until one =\r\nfinds a stick big enough&quot;.\n\nI believe one of the most important conclusions=\r\n we can harness from the Nobunaga-Akechi incident concerns the value of loy=\r\nalty. It doesn=B4t matter how powerful and accomplished an enitity is, for =\r\nthe lack of loyal retainers may cause the collapse of any structure.\n\nI ten=\r\nd to agree with Edy pertaining to the outcome of the Sengoku Jidai. Both Hi=\r\ndeiyoshi=B4s and Tokugawa=B4s achievements laid heavily on the road paved b=\r\ny Nobunaga.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that the Tokugawa clan was not a=\r\nbove employing social control measures in order to maintain power. The clas=\r\ns restrictions and the creation of a &quot;political police&quot; (like the shinsengu=\r\nmmi) are examples of that.\n\nCheers,\n\nThiago\n\np.s.: Octavio, would you atten=\r\nd classes at the Niten Institute?\n\n\nA presente mensagem cont=E9m informa=E7=\r\n=F5es e/ou anexos confidenciais, protegidos pelas leis de sigilo de corresp=\r\nond=EAncia e profissional.

Tokugawa did the\n  unifying of Japan because his incursions had pe=\r\nace as a goal, unlike the\n  christian Nobunaga, that only spread terrorism =\r\nand genocide.\n\n  And yes, I admire him as well Musashi. Of course I am spea=\r\nking about\n  Takeda...\n\n  Btw, that statements (babbling in japanese) about=\r\n Musashi being not fammous\n  to real japan dwellers is ridiculous. Sorry if=\r\n I offend anyone, but I have\n  some basis to call the attention of all.\n\n  =\r\nFirst of all, his book Go Rin No Shou is obrigatory reading to several japa=\r\nn\n  executive staff people.\n\n  Second, There was a Japanese TV Series Drama=\r\n about Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s\n  biography and it was very popular in Japan.\n\n  =\r\nThird, there was TONS of manga and gekiga that was in homnage of Musashi,\n =\r\n mentioned him somewhere or used a version of him like an popular comic man=\r\nga\n  of the 80s that had a kind of Musashi-Kid as its principal character.\n=\r\n\n  I remember a joke very well inside such manga...\n\n  There was a duel bet=\r\nween musashi-kid and another little samurai about who\n  would be a better s=\r\namurai.\n\n  Musashi glared to him and he glared to Musashi, and no one lost =\r\nthis face\n  down. Then the little samurai told Musashi this:\n\n  &quot;Bushido&#39;s =\r\nway is to not be afraid of Death, in fact is to live in death&quot;,\n  then sudd=\r\nendly he killed himself in front of Musashi just to prove him that\n  he is =\r\nbetter than Musashi.\n\n  With tears on his face, Musashi said that this is c=\r\norrect, but NOT NECESSARY\n  in this WAY!!!\n\n  (this was supposed to be a jo=\r\nke in such a dark humour typical of such comics\n  serie and of course, was =\r\nnot published in english)\n\n  Also, I&#39;ve heard about Musashi much time befor=\r\ne all this NIPON-Modism, and\n  it was around the 80&#39;s as well!\n\n  Sincerell=\r\ny\n\n  Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\n  S=E3o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\n=\r\n  Message: 1\n     Date: Mon, 5 Apr 2004 11:29:47 +0300\n     From: &quot;Edward A=\r\nlexander&quot; &lt;edy@...&gt;\n  Subject: Re: Digest Number 768\n\n  No,Tokugawa and=\r\n Hideyoshi would never have ended like they did.If Nobunaga\n  didn&#39;t take a=\r\nll that territory,Hideyoshi would have never been to\n  Korea.....and perhap=\r\ns the Tokugawa dinasty would&#39;t have existed....\n\n  Edy\n    ----- Original M=\r\nessage -----\n    From: Thiago Buschinelli Sorrentino\n    To: samuraihistory=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\n    Sent: Monday, April 05, 2004 12:27 AM\n    Subject: RES=\r\n: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 768\n\n\n\n    Anyways, would Hideiyoshi and T=\r\nokugawa have gotten that far without\n    Nobunaga=B4s incursions?
