An even at that time the written down codes were more of\ncertain persons oppinions than concensus of how all the members of the\nbushi class thought. In Hakagure for example Tsunetomo critisizes the\n47 r�nin, who usually are considered the shining examples of bushid�.\nHagakure also didn&#39;t seem to be widely read during the time of it&#39;s\nwriting, but was mostly used during the earlier part of 1900s, several\ndecades after the &quot;samurai&quot; ceased to exist, to promote &quot;yamato\ndamashii&quot; and was very popular with the right wing politicians and the\nmilitary.\nI like Hakagure very much. For me it gives an interesting window to\ncertain period in Japanese history through one persons eyes. The best\nthing for me that it has to offer are the &quot;news&quot; (more like rumours)\nthat were circulating around and that Tsunetomo wrote down.\n\nWell enough of ranting from me... there are more knowledgeable people\nwho have written on the subject:\nhttp://www.koryu.com/library/kfriday2.html\n\n-Mikko Vilenius\n\n\n\n"
