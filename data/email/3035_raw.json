Nah, I&#39;m here, I&#39;m broke,I&#39;m in the shop, I&#39;m to busy to \ndo anything but armour. Same old, same old. I go back tomorrow and greatly \nlook forward to it although I hate being away from my family.\n  BTW, you might consider changing your pattern for a nodowa. What you have \non the website is great as a visual for what the finished product should \nlook like. As a pattern, with the way metal moves (even hot worked) it \ndoesn&#39;t work. It closes up too much in the back. I was going to make one for \nEvil-Merlin but that pattern closes up so much my 5 year-old can&#39;t get it \non. I&#39;ve made another pattern but run out of time to make another. (sigh)\n  Well anyway, good luck on the job hunt. Talk to you later.\n\nMykaru/ M.J.Peters\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTired of spam?
