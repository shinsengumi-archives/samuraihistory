It&#39;a all stuff taken from the \nKodansha Ency=\r\nclopedia of Japan Online. (http://www.ency-japan.com - \npaysite)\nHope it he=\r\nlps\ncepo, honolulu.\n\nSatsuma Rebellion\nSeinan Senso\nThe last major armed up=\r\nrising against the new Meiji government and its \nreforms. Carried out by fo=\r\nrmer samurai of the Satsuma domain (now \nKagoshima Prefecture) under the le=\r\nadership of Saigo Takamori, the \nrebellion lasted from 29 January to 24 Sep=\r\ntember 1877. Its suppression \nproved the effectiveness of the government&#39;s =\r\nnew conscript army in \nmodern warfare.\n\nThe reform program of the governmen=\r\nt had caused the disestablishment of \nthe samurai class, the abolition of t=\r\nheir social privileges, a drastic \nreduction of their income, and the destr=\r\nuction of their traditional way \nof life. When their hero, Saigo Takamori, =\r\nwas politically discredited \nand resigned from the government in October 18=\r\n73 as a result of a \ndebate over whether to wage war on Korea , a number of=\r\n former Satsuma \nsamurai left their posts in the army and police force en m=\r\nasse to \nreturn to Kagoshima with Saigo.\n\nSeizure of arms and ammunition fr=\r\nom a naval yard and army munitions \ndepot by some of Saigo&#39;s followers was =\r\nthe spark that touched off open \nrebellion. Presented with thisfait accompl=\r\ni, Saigo saw no choice but to \ncome out of semiretirement to lead a hastily=\r\n organized and poorly \nequipped rebel army of about 40,000 men.\n\nAfter a ba=\r\nttle between the rebels and the local garrison at Kumamoto \nlasting about 5=\r\n0 days, the arrival of government reinforcements turned \nthe tide and force=\r\nd Saigo&#39;s retreat. For the next few months the \nremnants of the Satsuma arm=\r\ny fought their way through the mountains of \nsouthern Kyushu, arriving in K=\r\nagoshima with about 400 troops. The \nrebellion came to an end with a last c=\r\nharge by Saigo and his men, \nfollowed by Saigo&#39;s suicide.\n\n\n--- and here&#39;s =\r\nsomething about the end of the Samurai...\n\nThe Tokugawa Shogunate (1603=961=\r\n867) brought peace, which posed problems \nfor the ruling samurai class. Som=\r\ne samurai were employed in government, \nbut many more became idle stipendar=\r\nies. In response to these problems \nof the samurai during the peaceful Edo =\r\nperiod (1600=961868), \nintellectuals formulated the code of bushido, or the=\r\n =93Way of the \nwarrior.=94 Bushido romanticized the Japanese warrior tradi=\r\ntion and \nenjoined samurai to maintain military preparedness.\n\nThe visit to=\r\n Japan in 1853 of a squadron of ships commanded by \nCommodore Matthew Perry=\r\n of the United States brought Japan&#39;s National \nseclusion policy to an end.=\r\n During the next decade and a half, owing to \nits inability to deal effecti=\r\nvely with foreign relations, the shogunate \nwas increasingly criticized and=\r\n attacked, especially by samurai \nopponents within those domains, including=\r\n Satsuma (now Kagoshima \nPrefecture) and Choshu (now Yamaguchi Prefecture),=\r\n that had never been \npermitted to participate directly in central governme=\r\nnt affairs. \nUltimately there arose in the mid-1860s an imperial-loyalist m=\r\novement, \nled by lower-level samurai from Satsuma, Choshu, and other domain=\r\ns, \nwhich branded the shogunate an unworthy government and led to the Meiji=\r\n \nRestoration of 1868.\n\nThe Meiji government, however, could ill afford to =\r\ncontinue payment of \nthe hereditary samurai stipends; moreover, continuance=\r\n of the samurai&#39;s \nelite warrior status was incompatible with the building =\r\nof a modern \nconscript army. Dissolution of the samurai class was carried o=\r\nut \nbetween 1873 and 1876 in a series of measures collectively called \nchit=\r\nsuroku shobun. Some samurai leaders undertook armed rebellions, the \nlast o=\r\nf which=97the Satsuma Rebellion=97was put down in 1877; others \nfounded Wes=\r\ntern-style political parties and launched a movement for \nrepresentative go=\r\nvernment.\n\n--- finally...\n\nchitsuroku shobun\nMeasures (shobun) adopted by t=\r\nhe government in the 1870s to abolish the \nhereditary stipends (chitsuroku)=\r\n granted to the nobility and members of \nthe samurai class immediately afte=\r\nr the Meiji Restoration of 1868. In \n1869 the court aristocracy and former =\r\ndaimyo had been classified as \nkazoku, while the former samurai were divide=\r\nd into shizoku or sotsu; \nthese status distinctions became the basis for co=\r\nmputing the stipends \nto be paid to members of these groups.\n\nBy 1871, howe=\r\nver, the government began to reconsider the whole stipend \nsystem. The cost=\r\n of rice stipends alone constituted 30 percent of total \ngovernment expense=\r\ns and was diverting essential resources from other \ncrucial tasks such as t=\r\nhe development of a modern army and navy. As a \nresult, the government bega=\r\nn to tax the stipends in 1873, and in 1876 \ndecreed that all stipends be co=\r\nnverted into government bonds called \nkinroku kosai that would not be redee=\r\nmable for a five-year period. \nThese measures were a blow to the former sam=\r\nurai and, together with the \nloss of other feudal privileges, led to a wave=\r\n of samurai revolts \nculminating in the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. By 1880 =\r\nmore than half of \nthe poorer samurai had sold off their bonds; the nobilit=\r\ny and former \ndaimyo fared better, many using the bonds as investment capit=\r\nal in the \nnewly formed national bank system.\n\n[Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n"
