I have \ntalked=\r\n to many japanese people while I lived there.  I talked to \narchaeologist t=\r\nhat I worked with over there and they could not after \nresearching for mont=\r\nhs.  I even contacted Tokyo University.  They said \nthat it was 364 years o=\r\nld when they looked it up on the imperial \nrecords of the imperial bowmaker=\r\n Shibata Sensi XX.  They even said it \nwas stolen about 200 years ago.  But=\r\n they could not even give me the \nname or procounce it.  Wether or not the =\r\nstory is true, I do not know.  \nBut could someone please help me out in fin=\r\nding its name.  I believe it \nhas a soul just like a katana and would like =\r\nto honor it by calling the \nyumi by its name.  thank you all very much.  Al=\r\nso I have been \nresearching for about three years now.  The Yumi pictures a=\r\nre in the \nPhotos under Yumi and Asano Family Clan Kimono.  Again thank you=\r\n all \nfor your help in this matter.\n\n\n"
