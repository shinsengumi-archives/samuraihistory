I do have a follow up question.  What is a Taiga \ndrama and where could I rent the one about Saigo Takamori?  Is there any \nchance it has English subtitles?\n\nThere was a 50-part Japanese TV show that was shown on the San Francisco \nAsian station several years ago.  It was called TOBU GA GOTUKU and was about the \nMeji Restoration and went up through the Satsuma Rebellion.  Fortunately, I \nlearned about it somewhere around episode 32.  I was able to watch the episodes \non the Satsuma Rebellion.  Thank God they had English subtitles.\n\nBob Burke\n\n\nIn a message dated 12/8/03 7:25:16 PM, junkmail@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; Bob et al\n    Look for the film &quot;Bushido Blade&quot;, which has at least as many \nscreamers in it but to me was more entertaining and more accurate. As \nfor Japanese films, they tend to focus on individuals. Films about \nSakamoto Ryoma being in the majority,&#39;Ronin&#39; I think is one of them. \nAlso look for the film Bakumatsu(The Ambitious). In the area of Taiga \ndramas there is a lot more to choose from Ryoma ga yuku, Saigo Takamori \nand Tokugawa Keiki, being some of the recent ones worth watching.\n-t\n\nThere are a lot of great films set in this period, terrific chanbara \nbut they tend to only hint at the politcal situation...\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
