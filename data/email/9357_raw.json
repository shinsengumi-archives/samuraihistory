The stone marker is bigger than I had recollected. Funny how memory\n can play tricks. But the brick columns of the building behind it looks just\n like the commercial office building I remember.

First, I made the mistake of going directly to the current Honnoji,\n but was told that Honnoji had been relocated since Nobunaga&#39;s death. The guy\n at the temple pointed me in the general direction to go, but I really didn&#39;t\n know the exactly location. So with some difficulty, I eventually figured out\n where the marker was located so I could hike out to find it. I found the\n location by visiting a nearby museum of history that was very close to\n Honnoji. The museum had historical maps and tourist maps for sale, and I\n asked a woman at the museum information booth where the old Honnoji was.\n Between the two of us, we searched one of the maps and we figured out where\n the old Honnoji was. If I recall correctly, it was about a twenty minute\n twenty-five minute walk from Honnoji. When I found it, the marker was pretty\n non-descript. The marker was relatively modest grey stone, to my\n recollection perhaps 70-80 centimeters tall, located in a very non-descript\n residential neighborhood. The marker itself was located immediately in front\n of the commercial office of a model house showroom and an elementary school.\n The kids were laughing, playing, shouting in the background. I don&#39;t think\n that I have a photo of it. I&#39;m not much of a photography kind of guy.\n \n Regards,\n \n Mike \n \n _____ \n \n From: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@\n &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com]\n On Behalf Of Anthony Bryant\n Sent: Friday, February 09, 2007 4:54 AM\n To: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n yahoogroups.com\n Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: death of nobunaga and jube yagyu\n \n On Feb 7, 2007, at 4:07 PM, Nate Ledbetter wrote:\n &gt;\n &gt; Actually, theres&#39; a small marker in front of some\n &gt; building--I thing it&#39;s a hotel--that marks the former\n &gt; spot of the Honnoji.
