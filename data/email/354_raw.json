There were different forms of hakama that\nwere worn  at different times.  There was even a long\nversion worn in the shoguns palace during the edo\nperiod that were very hard to move around in.  During\nthe summer some samurai would wear kimono or a shorter\nversion of the hakama.  These were common to foot\nsoldiers in the summer.  For very formal occassions\nduring the late sengoku jidai and the tokugawa/edo\nperiod they would wear something called kamishimo\nwhich was essentially a hakama and a stiff shouldered\ntop that covered there kimono or whatever particular\nshirt they were wearing.  These could be formalized\nfor a particular daimyo and or family.\n\nHope this is helpful\n\nMusashi\n--- oblivion@... wrote:\n&gt; I would like to know if samurai had to wear Hakama\n&gt; or was it by rank \n&gt; or preference? Or was it so that if they didn&#39;t\n&gt; follow bushido then \n&gt; they didn&#39;t wear them?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
