It wasn&#39;t\na feint to divert enemy forces--he was to leave enough\nforces to physically prevent the Sanada from affecting\nthe battle, and hurry with his main body. He didn&#39;t do\nthat--he kept his entire force there at Ueda, causing\nall of his soldiers (50,000, IIRC) to miss the main\nbattle at Sekigahara. The important effect was that it\nkept a lot of Tokugawa forces out of the battle. Being\nas Tokugawa won, it&#39;s merely a footnote. Had he lost,\nit could have been devastating.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
