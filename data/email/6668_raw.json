He knew there would be strikes and \ndemonstrations, and military strategists have noticed that his \nbuilding fulfilled all the requirements of a fort built to withstand\na siege - not only walls and fences, but lines of approach, \neverything - it was quickly dubbed &quot;Fortress Wapping&quot; and was \nthe site of the last stand of those particular unions.\n\nIn short Despotic regimes, however benign, serve only one \npurpose, themselves.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
