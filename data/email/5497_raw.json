While coin \nwas exchanged for rice for many years there was no standard really \nuntil the late Muromachi, when powerful lords began minting their own \ncurrency. It is at the time of Hideyoshi that something like a national \nstandard starts to take shape. It is also at this time that the idea of \nswords as &quot;treasure&quot; starts to become widespread; Hideyoshi used them \nin place of land, castles and rice as reward.\n      Prior to say 1500, the average samurai was probably provided swords by \nhis lord or master. Custom swords by well known smiths would have been \nout of reach for most. Famous blades with long histories were well \nrecognized and usually already in the hands of privileged families. \nSince the rice to gold or copper equivalents of these early times does \nnot seem to be well known it is hard to say how much a Sengoku period \nMid-level Bushi might have paid for his sword. It is a terribly \ninteresting question though, and one I want to look into further.\n      Once you get into the Edo period it is quite easy to see the costs for \nan average sword represented about the same percentage of the average \nannual income of the average Japanese then as it does now. For example \nTamiya Shigemasa is said to have ordered a sword from Hizen Tadayoshi, \na well known Keicho era smith. It took him four years to pay off the \nsword which cost him 100 Kan which equals 25 Ryo or 25 Koku of rice or \n200 man-en in todays money. This is the cost of a custom sword by smith \nwith  quite a reputation so the average guy is paying anywhere between \n10 to 25 Ryo for his sword, (my estimate). There aren&#39;t alot of \nexamples of what the &quot;average&quot; guy paid , but I am still looking.\n      If we look at the Hon&#39;Ami family of appraisers we see that they did \nnot issue papers for anything valued at less than 5 Ryo as a rule but \nthe records that survive show that 30, 50, 100 and 150 Ryo blades were \nthe norm. There were 200 and 300 Ryo blades very rarely and only one \n1000 Ryo blade; the famous Wakasa Masamune. At the end of the Edo \nperiod a custom sword by Kurihara Nobuhide cost 38 Ryo 3bu, Ishido \nKorekazu 31 Ryo and Koyama Munetsugu 27 Ryo. Thats 310 man-en, 248 \nman-en and 216 man-en respectively in todays money. Considerable sums \nyes, but less than you&#39;d pay for their works today and about what you&#39;d \npay for work by someone like Yoshihara Yoshindo currently.\n      I am not so sure I made my case but if you extrapolate a bit, I think \nyou can argue that the everyday Edo Samurai wasn&#39;t investing in works \nby the most popular smiths of his day, but was likely getting the best \nthe smith in his Han offered and that he could afford so 10 to 20 Ryo \nor about a years salary...\nIMHO,\n-t\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
