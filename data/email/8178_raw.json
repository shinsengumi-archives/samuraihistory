I&#39;m doing family genealogy research and \n  will be glad to share any relevant findings.  I recently had a 30-\n  year old family letter translated between my Japanese aunt and her \n  sister (my deceased mother).  I only speak English.  My great-great-\n  grandfather was a Hatamoto Samurai who had a rank/reward/status of \n  1500 koku.  The family name is Shimada.  His given name is Sugo.  \n  His other name(perhaps imani?) is Naoaki.  I have independently \n  confirmed all the kanji characters in the name translation \n  except &quot;Sugo&quot;.  The first kanji is &quot;su&quot;, but the second one (&quot;go&quot;) \n  is the best guess of the translator.  Sugo Shimada served in the \n  early 1800&#39;s in the Edo (Tokyo) area, likely in/near Honjo.  He had \n  a son (Nobushi Naoharu Shimada) born in 1858, who served under \n  General Nogi.\n  \n  My questions are:\n  1.  What additional resources (beyond this very helpful site) are \n  recommended for this type of researching?  I&#39;ve done extensive web \n  browsing and have begun to get some books.\n  2.  Today, Shimada is a relatively common surname in Japan.  In the \n  Samurai days, was there only one Shimada clan, or perhaps one \n  Shimada clan per city/area?  I don&#39;t know how unique the name was \n  during the Samaurai period.  I have read that this surname is \n  contained in ancient Japanese family name records.  If there is any \n  Samurai history about the Shimada family, and if there is some sort \n  of connection between &quot;those&quot; Shimada&#39;s and my family, I would love \n  to learn about it.\n  3.  Is there a kamon associated with the Shimada family/clan?  Where \n  might I look for a copy of it?  I have not found it among the \n  samurai-archives and other helpful web sites.\n  4.  Can someone confirm what the second names (Naoaki and Naoharu) \n  typically represent for Samurai, especially in a society where many \n  had only one or two names at that time?  Were their names associated \n  with the Samurai coming of age ceremony, or perhaps names given to \n  them after their deaths?  I&#39;m just not clear about that.\n  5.  Can a tell anything about the status in society (or other \n  things) of Sugo Shimada as a Hatamoto in the Edo area with 1500 \n  koku?  Whatever they possessed (and it appeared to have been much), \n  survived the Meiji restoration, but did not survive the US strategic \n  bombing campaign during WWII.  The surviving family members were \n  back to &quot;ground zero&quot; in 1945.\n  \n  Any perspectives would be greatly appreciated,\n  \n  Dave Cain\n  Cincinnati, Ohio, USA\n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n            \n\n    ---\n  Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n  http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n  \n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---  \n\n                      \n\n          SPONSORED LINKS    \n                                                        Samurai                                          Japan                                          Japan airline                                                                             \n        \n---------------------------------\n    YAHOO!
