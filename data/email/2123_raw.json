Ninja that did their job well were never heard about or\ndiscovered.\n\nThere&#39;s also this big misconception that Ninja clans were organized and out\nin the open. While one can point to the historical existence of the Iga and\nKaga, the majority of what we call ninja today often learned their skills\nfrom other family members, passing them down from generation to generation.\n\nThere&#39;s also the terms themselves &quot;Ninja&quot; and &quot;Shinobi&quot; in reality both were\nreally generic terms that meant pretty much the same thing - Spy.\n\nThere&#39;s nothing mystical or magical about ninja. They simply were everyday\npeople who acted as scouts and spies. Some had formal training, some didn&#39;t.\n\nIn fact the last known historically accurate account of a &quot;Ninja&quot; mission\ninvolved a ninja trying sneaking onto a portugese ship in order to steal\nwhat were thought to be invasion or battle plans. While the ninja was\nsuccessful in sneaking in and off the ship, when he presented the &quot;battle\nplans&quot; to his lord, it turned out that he had swiped the galley menu for the\nweek...\n\n*Back to Lurk Mode*\n\n-Thom\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Masamori Masami&quot; &lt;oni_shogun@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, August 26, 2003 6:39 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Actual Oniwabanshuu history facts\n\n\n&gt; well this is new to me, i thought peasents made up the majority of\n&gt; ninja clans, i personally dont know that much about ninjas, im a\n&gt; samurai guy. So it seems the info i got on ninja-samurai relations\n&gt; was the steriotipical hollywood crap, thanks for clearing that up.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, cabbit10@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; *Comes out of lurk mode*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No, No, No!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This again is a fiction!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re a spy, you don&#39;t exactly go around carrying a sign that\n&gt; says &quot;Ninja&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and then complain to the &quot;Ninja Union&quot; when the samurai make fun\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; your &quot;pajamas&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Samurai and Ninja were co-workers, both doing the work of their\n&gt; lords.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ninja were often from samurai families and there was little if any\n&gt; animosity\n&gt; &gt; because most of the time the samurai, and in some cases even\n&gt; individual ninja,\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know who else in their lord&#39;s employ were actually ninja!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Most Samurai knew that their lords employed ninjas, but they\n&gt; rarely if ever\n&gt; &gt; knew who the ninja(s) were. They could be anyone from a lowly\n&gt; kitchen worker,\n&gt; &gt; to a fully ranked and privleged Samurai.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For a historical example of how ninja and samurai worked, read the\n&gt; book &quot;Taiko&quot;\n&gt; &gt; it contains fairly accurate accounts of how ninja and samurai\n&gt; worked together.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; FYI: Ninja rarely if ever wore outfits like the movies show them\n&gt; wearing.
