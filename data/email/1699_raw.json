My \n  teacher told me to study swords, easy thought I, now half a lifetime \n  later I am still studying. It is a fascinating subject with something \n  for every interest. If you follow the above link you&#39;ll be taken to \n  probably the most comprehensive site on the web.\n        Depending on where you live there are clubs and collectors \n  who will be willing to help you research your swords. There is a \n  &quot;Nihontostudy&quot; group on Yahoo like this one and I of course would be \n  happy to help if I can.\n  Tom Helm\n  member NCJSC\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
