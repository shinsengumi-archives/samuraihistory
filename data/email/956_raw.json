I&#39;m hoping in that it is unusual, it would be easier to \nnarrow down.\n\n&gt; could sport all three.\n&gt;     And I would point out once we get into the Meiji period no \nrules were\n&gt; followed and any mon might be used by any family. In the end I \nthink it is\n&gt; near impossible to identify a family by mon without some other \nevidence.\n\nThe koshirae here do date to the 1700s though, so hopefully that \nwould eliminate the Meiji stuff.\n\nAnd then 2/3 would hopefully narrow it down to a set of choices...\n\nThank you both for your help!\n\n\n\n"
