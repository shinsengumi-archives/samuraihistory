For all we really know the \ntachi was drawn blade up. What we know for sure is, it was worn blade \ndown. I believe they were edge down because the Chinese models they \nwere based on were all also worn edge down.\n\tWith the change to the katana the idea of &quot;batto&quot; has more credence. \nTry walking ten or fifteen miles a day in Oyoroi with a sword banging \non your hip. Lash that same sword to your side with a wide sash, edge \nup, and it carries itself. The katana can effectively draw and cut, \nground to sky as well as overhand when worn edge up. Still the single \nhand &quot;overhand&quot; draw is common in many sword schools and it&#39;s speed and \neffectiveness may indeed have been the main reason for the rise of the \nUchi-katana.\n-t\n\n\n"
