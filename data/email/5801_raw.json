I posted onthis list, as questions\nin the past had been about obtaining swords from Tozando, so assumed\nprior knowledge by people.  Please feel free to suggest a more\nsuitable list.\n\nBarry, thanks for your email, I am looking into the To-ken society.\n\nI teach jiu-jitsu, we have sword kata in there for which we use a\nbokken.  I have been fascinated by the Samurai for ages (martial arts\nfor 21 years!!), especially the sword and archery forms. \n\nUntil today, I didn&#39;t know there were kyudo clubs in the UK! I have\nfound one in London which is close to me :) so will give that a try.\n\nCheers\n\nIan\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@i...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Ian,\n&gt; I think you may on the wrong list for this particular kind of question.\n&gt; Let&#39;s see...\n&gt; \n&gt; Otherwise, please reply to me offline and I&#39;ll steer you elsewhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Ian Key &lt;ian@b...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 21, 2004 11:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Tozando and importing to the UK\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been listening in for about a month now and have obtained some\n&gt; really useful information, but this is my first time post, so please\n&gt; be gentle on me ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; I am interested in getting both a sword and a bow. Not sure at the\n&gt; moment if I want a shinken or iaito as I want to practice kata.  Does\n&gt; anyone know about importing either of these items into the UK and what\n&gt; problems might arise with customs and/or police?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Yahoo!
