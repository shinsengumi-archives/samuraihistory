That said \nthere is MORE of a tendency to take pride in your work simply for the sake \nof doing your job well than you encounter in the West. There is more respect \nfor the craftsman. But a TRUE craftsman, whether it&#39;s swords, armour, \nweaving, cooking, carpentry, even chadou FOCUSES. It is the MIND not the \nsoul. If you believe Robert Mcpherson or J.D. Hrosilous (sp?) don&#39;t focus at \nthe same level of armourers and swordsmiths in Japan you are sorely \nmistaken. Also if you think the average Japanese focuses well you should see \nall the idiots trying to ride bicycles while reading e-mail on thier keitai\n  Perhaps this is because we DO tend to over-intellectualize things in the \nWest. My poor Japanese HAS forced me to use ishin denshin while studying \nKyuudo, but my focus is the same it has been for years while armouring or \ntraining in different martial art systems.\n  Side observation. It often seems that the people who believe (key word \nbelieve) in the &quot;Mystical East&quot; are people who would LIKE to believe in \nmagic but have too much sense yet are too much of the romantic to give up \nthe idea that there is SOMETHING more so they transfer that desire to a far \ndistant and strange land. I undestand that hope. I shared it when I was much \nyounger, but I have travelled too much and seen too much to give it any \ncredence.\n\nM.J.Peters\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
