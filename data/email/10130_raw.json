That is much more congruent with my  \nunderstanding of Buddhism and its relationship with Shinto (and other  \nreligions).  \n \nI do have a question about one thing you said -- that there is no &quot;god&quot; in  \nBuddhism.  Aren&#39;t there numerous gods and goddesses (largely adopted /  \nadapted from Hinduism, Shakyamuni having been Hindu, much as Christ was  \nJewish)?  My understanding is that these gods are not &quot;ultimate&quot; beings,  but \nrather beings of a different sort of existence than humans, but still in  need \nof the Buddha&#39;s enlightenment...\n \nTo bring this back around to the central topic of the forum -- how did this \n all play into the ideologies of the Christian daimyo?  Did they hold onto  \nany Buddhist / Shinto beliefs, or were they completely converted?  Any  \ninsights?\n \n--RMB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
