I&#39;ve=\r\n \nenjoyed the knowledgeable discussions and even the not so \nknowledgeable =\r\ndiscussions as well, lol.\n\nAnyway, before I start explaining what this post=\r\n is about, keep in \nmind that I&#39;m at university majoring in Asian Studies a=\r\nnd \nPhilosophy, with my major interest being anything to do with East \nAsia=\r\n, and especially Japan.  I&#39;m quite widely read on Japanese \nculture, histor=\r\ny and language.  \n\nMy university&#39;s anime society is holding its second conv=\r\nention in a \ncouple of weeks and I&#39;m presenting two lectures/discussions in=\r\n a \nmore serious, educational and factual nature then what is usually \npres=\r\nented at such events.  One is titled &quot;Shinto, its origins and \nwhat it mean=\r\ns to modern Japan&quot; (being of major importance to my \npotential post-graduat=\r\ne studies/research) and the other is \ntitled &quot;Samurai, Ninja and Mythconcep=\r\ntions&quot;.  Now the purpose of \nthis post is to ask the samurai history commun=\r\nity about any good \nresources/links related to the second topic, well anyth=\r\ning relating \nto the first is quite welcome too.  I&#39;ve come across quite a =\r\nlot of \ninfo already, the uni library has a very large collection of books =\r\n\nabout Japan, in fact too much, because I can&#39;t possibly look at it \nall be=\r\nfore the con =85 I&#39;m also doing a summer school unit which takes \npriority.=\r\n \n\nIf it&#39;s ok with Nate, I would like to quote extensively from \nhis &quot;Commo=\r\nn Misconceptions Concerning those Kewl Ninja&quot; as well \nas &quot;The Top Eleven W=\r\nestern, Modern Day Common Misconceptions About \nThe Samurai&quot;, is that yours=\r\n as well Nate?  Also do you have any \nreferences for these articles?  \n\nChe=\r\ners,\nWarren\n\n\n\n"
