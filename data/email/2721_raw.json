Still, the legislation abolishing the \nexistence of the monarchy doesn&#39;t stop people from claiming to be royal.\n\nIn the same way, I suppose that someone with the proper ancestry could still \nclaim to be samurai, even if the law does not recognize his or her claim.\n\nBob Burke\n\n\nIn a message dated 12/7/03 7:05:44 PM, ajbryant@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; longhunter1748 wrote:\n\n&gt; i jsut saw the last samurai and was wondering how much of it was \n&gt; fact and are there still samurai today thanks \n\n\nAnd people ask me why I curse whenever someone mentions that damned film in \nmy \npresence. Sigh.\n\nIt is complete unmitigated fiction. And no, there are no more samurai; they \nceased to exist with the stroke of a legislative pen (okay, a brush) in the \n1870s.\n\nTony\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
