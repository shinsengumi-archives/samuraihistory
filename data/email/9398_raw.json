My name is Phil and I have been trying to find some good \ninfor=\r\nmation on the religion of Shinto.  I am one that does not belong \nto a reli=\r\ngious faith due to personal reasons but I do find a \nresemblence in my pers=\r\nonal beliefs and that of Shintoism.  I have \nbeen surfing the internet but =\r\nI would really like some hard copy \nbooks to research.  If anyone can make =\r\nany recommendations, I would \ngreatly appreciate it.\n\nPhil\n\n\n"
