I have read &quot;Gates of power&quot; and might read the book on\nYoritomo. I\n&gt; saw it in the bookstore and the apprehension I have is that it&#39;s not\nreally\n&gt; a flesh and blood biography of him. I would much rather prefer to read\na\n&gt; book on him written say in the style Amy Kelly wrote on Eleonor of\nAquitane.\n&gt; If she could write that kind of book on a famous person in the 12th\ncentury\n&gt; somebody could write one on Yoritomo. The other apprehension is that\n&gt; Yoritomo book is 8000 yen. For me a least its not a question of not\nwanting\n&gt; to delve deeper into more serious works. Its that the feild of\nJapanese\n&gt; historigraphy is lacking in truly talented writers that can be found\nin\n&gt; other fields eg Robert Massie, Simon Schama, Stephan Ambrose. That is\n&gt; something that disappoints me.\n\nYou either want popular history or an academic history; you\nunfortunately can&#39;t get both.  Out of the list you give above, Schama is\nthe only exception to the generalization.  While Ambrose was trained as\na historian, you need to be checking the newspapers more, he is under\nheavy fire for plagiarism and getting his facts screwed up.  I have yet\nto meet any AHA members who liked Massie&#39;s books as an ACADEMIC book.\nMaybe they are out there, but I haven&#39;t seen them come forward.  The\nsame criticisms are leveled at Tuchman and Cantor&#39;s recent works.  \n\nBest, Mark Hall\n\n\n\n"
