In terms of the question itself, surely a leader (anywhere) could be both dictator and unifier, they are not mutually exclusive terms.\n&gt;Sprouting from the term &#39;unifier&#39; though I have a question? When was Japan unified? \n&gt;\nI agree that&#39;s a tough question, it wouldn&#39;t be irrational to claim that \nJapan wasn&#39;t a nation until Meiji forced it to become one. It had no \nnational army or many of the other characteristics of the nations of \nEurope or later on of the Americas You could look at the Edo jidai as \none long occupation by an invading force for half of the country.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;edy@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;He tried to conquerKorea but he was forced out because the Koreanswere helped by the Chinese\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think the Korean navy might disagree with that. The Japanese did great \non land, but failed horribly at sea against Korean naval forces. I \nsuspect the Korean peasants and commoners didn&#39;t welcome them either.     \n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;And, sadly, Musashi is probably the one.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhy sadly? He was definitely an interesting character and he left some \ngood paintings behind! I have to ask my freshly arrived who the most \nfamous American historic character in Japan, I think the answer will be \na bit scary. Of course some of my favorite Americans are among the \nfounding fathers, the wierdest group ever assembled I think in part \nbecause America was the first place in the West that ordinary people \ncould rise to the top without any form of nobility baggage. So all the \nnuts and flakes came and then continued west ;)\n\n&gt;   From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If the question is &quot;best known&quot;, then I would go\n&gt;&gt;with Musashi, at \n&gt;&gt;least in the USA.  No one knows who Uesugi Kenshin\n&gt;&gt;is here...\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;And more is the pity...\n&gt;\n&gt;If he had written a best selling business tactics\n&gt;book, we&#39;d know him, wouldn&#39;t we? \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m grateful that it&#39;s published as that in English since it means cheap \ncopies everywhere, but I always laugh at the though of it as a business \nmanual. Prabably better than anything coming out of Harvard though.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Basically that there are many, many samurai who should be famous for their \n&gt;achievements, but all the samuraifanboys are in love with Musashi because he \n&gt;wrote a book.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhat&#39;s more important, it was translated into English!  You can&#39;t say is \nunpopular in Japan, so he appeals to a wide range of people. Besides do \nfanboys read ^_^ Though in some ways he&#39;s more like Billy the Kid or \nsome Hollywood cowboy hero in some ways.\n\n&gt;   From: Eponymous13@...\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey.\n&gt;       At the risk of being branded heretical, I personally wouldn&#39;t have \n&gt;even thought of Musashi.  To me &quot;Musashi&quot; is the first set of sounds of a name of \n&gt;a sumo heya (Musashigawa) and part of the shikona of the last yokozuna to \n&gt;retire (Musashimaru), and that was the only thing I associated it with.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHow about Takezo?\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Nate Ledbetter wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Oh come on, he&#39;s so cool! I used his business strategy\n&gt;&gt;to build my dot.com! \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;And here I am, in the Army now....lol\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I rest my case. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nProbably why the dumb Westerners were told that :)\n\nJim Eckman\n\n"
