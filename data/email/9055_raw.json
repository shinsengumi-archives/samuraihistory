Do you claim that during say, the \n&gt; momoyama period, tattoos =\r\nwere socially acceptable by the bushi? The\njapanese \n&gt; perception of tattoo=\r\ns as unclean is a modern only sensibility? The\nanalogy \n&gt; works unless of c=\r\nourse he *is* into torturing small animals. My\npoint was \n&gt; simply somethin=\r\ng perfectly acceptable to someone in one time and\nculture \n&gt; (tattoos, now,=\r\n in the West) could be taken as bizarre at the least by \n&gt; someone from ano=\r\nther time and culture (tattoos in honor of\nsomething, then, \n&gt; Japan).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; To further play Satan&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;Lawyer, are you saying that &quot;respectable&quot; peop=\r\nle don&#39;t get tattoos?\n&gt; &gt;You&#39;ve dug yourself a bit of a hole, can you get o=\r\nut? ;)\n&gt; \n&gt;   Whether *I* feel respectable people don&#39;t get tattoos isn&#39;t t=\r\nhe\nissue. The \n&gt; issue is how tattoos are percieved in Japan. Note *I* have=\r\n a tat and\neven \n&gt; though most rules Japanese apply to themselves are ignor=\r\ned as baka\ngaijin \n&gt; things when foreigners are concerned, there aren&#39;t man=\r\ny onsen I can\nvisit \n&gt; due to 1 small tat. Can you cite any &quot;respectable&quot; j=\r\napanese who have\ntats \n&gt; (entertainers excluded of course)? Note: respectab=\r\nle as it would be\napplied \n&gt; in Japan. I have some japanese friends who hav=\r\ne tats and they are great \n&gt; people, but none are politicians, CEOs etc.\n&gt; =\r\n\n\n\nSince the original email was from (presumably) an american in america\nwh=\r\no wanted to get body art that reflected his interest in martial arts\nand th=\r\ne Samurai as a personal (maybe even relatively private depending\non the loc=\r\nation) symbol of his own interests, I didn&#39;t even consider\nor see any relat=\r\nionship to Japan or the Samurai, which is why I had\ntrouble making sense ou=\r\nt of what you meant.  I would agree with you if\nhe was in/going to Japan an=\r\nd/or wanted to show off his tattoos to\nJapanese people to show how much of =\r\na Samurai he is, but I didn&#39;t\nreally get that impression. It seemed pretty =\r\ninnocent, actually. So\nsince it seemed to me that it was an innocent reques=\r\nt by an american\nin america, it was easy for me to take your statement as a=\r\n statement\nof your personal feelings for tattoos.  And I&#39;ve seen plenty of =\r\npeople\nin Japan with tattoos, it isn&#39;t as bad as it used to be.  I even kne=\r\nw\na Japanese highschool teacher with tattoos around his collarbone,\nwhere h=\r\ne could hide it.  Schoolteachers are &quot;supposed&quot; to be\nrespectable. Anyway, =\r\nyou really can&#39;t make a blanket statement that\n&quot;NO &#39;respectable&#39; Japanese p=\r\nerson would get a tattoo&quot;, because it\nwould only take one person to get one=\r\n to make your entire statement\nfalse. I just percieved a subjective argumen=\r\nt and played devil&#39;s\nadvocate and tried to poke holes in it.  That&#39;s all.\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n"
