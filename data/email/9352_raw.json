Can anyone tell me the\n&gt; exact location of the \n&gt; original Honnoji? I have been to the re-built site\n&gt; on several \n&gt; occassions, but it would be nice to see the\n&gt; landscape of where the \n&gt; original actually rested.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One of the times I was in Kyoto and I asked about\n&gt; it, the general \n&gt; consensus seemed to be &quot;nobody really knows&quot;.\n\n\nActually, theres&#39; a small marker in front of some\nbuilding--I thing it&#39;s a hotel--that marks the former\nspot of the Honnoji. I&#39;ve seen it on documentaries\nabout Nobunaga, but last time I was in Kyoto wasn&#39;t\nable to find it myself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nIt&#39;s here!
