However,  there seems little (if anything) \n  on the use of match lock pistols or hand guns by the samurai officers who \n  captained Teppu-shu, the firearms corps of commanders like Oda Nobunaga at \n  Nagashino in 1575.  Can anyone enlighten me here?  Prof.  John F.  Murphy Jr.,  The \n  Japan Foundation\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
