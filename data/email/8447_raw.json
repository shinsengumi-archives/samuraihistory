Katakana is usually\n&gt; reserved for \n&gt; words that did not originate in Japan or what we\n&gt; call borrowed words.\n\nThat&#39;s not true at all, judging by what I see in the\nseafood section of my grocery store, and the sushiya I\ngo to regularly. Both write ika in katakana usually.\n\nWhat Hirai says is &quot;generally&quot; correct, katakana is\nusually reserved for words originating outside of the\nJapanese language in modern usage. However, this isn&#39;t\na hard and fast rule by any means, and frequently in\nadvertising, price tags, signs, etc. you will see\nthings written in kanji, hiragana, katakana, and\nromaji with no rhyme or reason. There&#39;s nothing wrong\nwith writing Ika in katakana as opposed to hiragana. I\nsuppose you could use the kanji, too, though I think\neven most Japanese would be surprised to see it. If\nyou were writing in a letter to your aunt that you ate\nsome fine yari-ika at the local sushiya, you&#39;d likely\nuse hiragana; however, there&#39;s no requirement for you\nto do so. \n\nFunnily enough, the sushiya I go to usually has the\nspecials up on the blackboard. Being katakana impaired\nlike I am (I simply DESPISE it), I spent 10 minutes\ntrying to figure out what &quot;kashio&quot; was...until it\ndawned on me that one of the specials was hon-katsuo.\nD&#39;oh!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
