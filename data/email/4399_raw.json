But, I&#39;m not sure that this assumption really \nholds up. And of course it depends on what you mean by things like \n&quot;modern&quot; and &quot;lost&quot;. By modern I&#39;ll guess you mean the Meiji \nRestoration. \n\nBut - that was only roughly 150 years ago - the same timeframe as the \nUS civil war. Many of us personally may know an elderly person who, wh\nen they were young, knew people who were alive during this period.\n\nI personally don&#39;t think that so many customs and stories have been \nlost to the mists of time during this period of two living memories.\n\nRather, the situation with Shingen seems less poetic and much more \npedestrian. He himself didn&#39;t have a roster of 24 of his top generals.\n The notion came up many many years later. So, there&#39;s just different \nversions of who the 24 really are that were created over time.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
