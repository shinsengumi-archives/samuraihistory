They were maintained by King Ekathotsarot of Ayutthaya (the kingdom in place prior to present-day Thailand), when Ayutthaya attracted a number of foreign merchants from ming China and the Netherlands, but in 1620 they were forced into flight after Ekathotsarot was defeated during a palace coup led by Songdhamrna.\nThe leader of this group of Yamada Nagamasa (1590-1630), who became lord of Nakhon Si Thammarat (in present-day southern Thailand), but he died after being wounded fighting supporters of King Songtham.  \n\n\njames wallis &lt;kentguy212002@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\nHi all, hope your christmas was fun and fullfilling, and that you all got the lego sets you wanted.
