Information about that\ntime period is hard to come by, especially detailed\ninformation. If you mean the &quot;samurai&quot; period--from,\nsay, 1000 AD to the 1860&#39;s--then &quot;ancient&quot; isn&#39;t the\nword you are looking for, but someone may be able to\nfind something for you.\n\n&gt; Would you (listmembers, that is) be so kind as to\n&gt; point out if there were\n&gt; any formal or constant &quot;jobs&quot; within the japanese\n&gt; feudal military structure?\n\nHere&#39;s where your question gets confusing--&quot;feudal&quot;\nJapan wasn&#39;t &quot;ancient&quot;. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
