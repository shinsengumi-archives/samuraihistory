It&#39;ll probably transfer the old &quot;Super-Human Ninja&quot; character to the &quot;Super-Human Samurai&quot;- without the entertainment value of &quot;Crouching Tiger-Hidden Dragon&quot;--(which I really enjoyed-& I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it) Of course I might not have any idea what I&#39;m talking about and it may turn out to be one helluva great flik.....Ronin\n\nMasamori Masami &lt;oni_shogun@...&gt; wrote:Bob Burke recently brought up the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877 in one \nof his posts, and this got me thinking of &quot;The Last Samurai.&quot; This \nmovie is scheduled to come out in December and from what I&#39;ve seen \nit seems to be kind of accurate and very much like a James Clavell \nbook (names changed and such).  But what do you guys think of it? Do \nyou think it has the potential to be up there with Shogun and The \nSeven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood crapfest to make money \nand draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
