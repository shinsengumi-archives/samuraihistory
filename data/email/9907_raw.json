Earliest records are in the Akkiadian around 4000 bc. This was a time of turmoil and expansion for the sedentary cities of the region. There is no evidence as far as I am aware of humans helping one another, but the is nothing to the contrary. I refer you to a\n theory a few years ago which stipulated that the mongoloid race that came across the Bearing strait around 30,000 bc, may have exterminated the indigonius population around 12,000. the evidence for this is a pink layer (evidence of burning) and arrows heads and primitive weapons sealed within the\n layer.\n\n\n\nT.D\n\n\n\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nFrom: burker1@...\nDate: Sat, 2 May 2009 00:43:49 -0400\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Parallels in US and Japanese history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there are no written records that predate the &quot;so called \ncivilizational tools&quot;, I would like to know what you based your conclusion on regarding \nhow humans once lived in equality and helping each other?\n\nBob Burke\n\nIn a message dated 5/1/09 8:59:25 PM, eddiehiramoto@... writes:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As far as slaves are concerned, this is the parallel not only in US and \n&gt; Japanese history, but in world wide of human history since ancient world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Until Humans invented so called civilizational tools, or rice crop, they \n&gt; used to live under helping each other concept and equally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then, they formed strong powered people vs weak people gradually, \n&gt; resulting in coming out slaves from weak people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even now, the rich people and poor people exist in world wide. The gap \n&gt; between rich and poor has never been narrowed since occured in world wide.\n&gt; This is the real cause of Terrorism by poorer side against richer side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now , the fellow friends of this community must ask what you can do how to \n&gt; settling out this terrorism problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eddie Hiramoto\n&gt; \n&gt; nohit@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And another parallel: In the late 19th century, two different \n&gt; &quot;emancipation proclamations&quot; were made. In the U.S., this was Lincoln&#39;s proclamation to \n&gt; free African-American slaves. In Japan, it was the Meiji government&#39;s \n&gt; proclamation to end the feudal outcaste catagories of &quot;eta&quot; (extreme filth)\n&gt; and &quot;hinin&quot; (non-human). In both cases, there was resistance by people \n&gt; against these groups (freed slaves in the U.S. and &quot;new commoners&quot; in Japan) \n&gt; that wound up in attacks and lynchings as well as continued segregation and \n&gt; discrimination.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmm, maybe we&#39;re not so different after all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Steven Matsheshu \n&gt; To: samuraihistory@samuraihistosam\n&gt; Sent: Wed, 29 Apr 2009 10:28 am\n&gt; Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Parallels in US and Japanese history\n&gt; \n&gt; One sad similarity between US and Japanese history is the displacement and \n&gt; attempted genocide of the native people by the &quot;new government&quot;. I am of \n&gt; course drawing a parallel between the policies and actions of the European \n&gt; settlers/US government towards Native Americans and the Emishi/Ainu/ One sa\n&gt; \n&gt; Not just in the land-grabbing and killing--- but we also saw many Emishi \n&gt; come to work for the new Emperor(s) --- just like some natives allied with \n&gt; the new US.\n&gt; \n&gt; We also see that the tactics brought in from the old country (Europe for \n&gt; US, China for Japan) were no match against the guerilla tactics of the \n&gt; natives---and newer devices and strategies had to be made to fight them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also--the idea that many Ainu hid their ethnic origins to avoid problems \n&gt; reminds me of many native families (that can) hiding their origins to avoid \n&gt; problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I know though...there are not any &quot;Japanese reservations&quot; As far \n&gt; as I know though...there are not any &quot;Japanese res\n&gt; \n&gt; Etc.etc....\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I would say this pattern is common anytime a foreign invader \n&gt; comes in and &quot;colonizes&quot; an area..\n&gt; \n&gt; But, still.. I would say that is applies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------ -------- -------- --\n&gt; Power up the Internet with Yahoo!
