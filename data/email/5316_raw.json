I meant in an instance in which: \n\nA samurai serves a Daimyo. \nThe Daimyo&#39;s son kills his own father in a coup. \nThe samurai attempts to assassinate the son out of loyalty to his dead master. \nThe samurai is apprehended. \nWould he be forced to commit seppuku, or be inflicted a different kind of death?\n\nThanks, Nate, for your input about the crucifixion of the criminals! yes, I meant apprehended criminals. Were hangings practiced in Edo Japan at all, for any reason?\n\nI am sorry for not contributing much of my own to the topics suggested in the group. I have only been researching about samurai history for the past few months, and respect people who are much more knowledgeable than I am! This all goes a novel I am writing. I am doing a lot of reading on my own, and my questions usually come up from conflicting information I gather, or topics to which I haven&#39;t found a solid answer. \n\nTime will be my teacher (and books... and you guys...) Thank you!\n  Hi Rami, Can you clarify &quot;renegade ronin&quot; for me. Do you mean ex samurai who\n  became brigands, or ex samurai who betrayed there masters, or...? Sorry, I&#39;m\n  probly just being thick.  Denny.\n\n\n  &gt; Hi all! Regarding the previous discussion about Seppuku, I have another\n  question. As we understand Seppuku, it was a dignified act of inflicting\n  death, a privilege. does this mean that criminals and renegade ronin were\n  depraved of this kind of reconciliatory option, and were, for example,\n  hanged?\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
