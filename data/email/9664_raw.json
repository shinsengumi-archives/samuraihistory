But these =\r\nenabling factors did not produce a warrior class superior to any other.\n\n  =\r\nThere are many other reasons to study and admire the Samurai, and the cultu=\r\nre that created them. But comparing them as individuals or as a national bo=\r\ndy, to those of any other nation, will only bring you to similarities, not =\r\nsuperiorities.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Chris Olson \n  To: =\r\nsamuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, November 26, 2007 7:46 PM\n =\r\n Subject: [samuraihistory] What made japan a superior warrior nation?\n\n  Wh=\r\nat made japan a superior warrior nation?\n\n  _______________________________=\r\n___________________________\n  Be a better pen pal. \n  Text or chat with fri=\r\nends inside Yahoo!
