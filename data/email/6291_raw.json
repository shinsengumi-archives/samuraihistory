I saw &#39;Legend&#39; about a \nhundred years ago, but I digress...\n\nI&#39;d very much like to read a post that enumerates the inaccuracies of the movie as is, not as you wish it to be, and reveals what is \nthe true history instead.  I have read a great deal of slamming (and elsewhere in other forums), but have yet to come across any \npost that educates....\n\nFor example:  the seppuku of General Hasagawa was not accurate from a &#39;formal seppuku&#39; reference point, but what was the historical \nritual during/after battle?\n\nThere would be no poems, white robes,  the cut did not go all the way through, and I forget the name of that piece of furniture \ndirectly in front of the individual so that his shoulders & head landed on that, and thus avoided having the head bounce around on \nthe ground and his corpse avoided the indignity of having his butt in the air.  I assume the final expulsion of body fluids was \nprovided for by careful fundoshi wrapping.\n\nTo me, the cut made by Katsumoto seemed inaccurate because it not went all the way through and allowed the head to roll away,  with \nthe indignities to the corpse and all, and the kiai.  I think that traditionally  the ritual was performed in silence.\n\nArmor: I don&#39;t know from squat, and would love to learn.  Yes, I&#39;ve read Tony&#39;s pages. My questions are these, so far:  how \nimpoverished was the samurai class by the Meiji period; hadn&#39;t the shogunate been defunct by around twenty years by the time frame \nof the movie; and how many generations might a suit of armor last?\n\nWhether or not the widow or kids wanted to off TC, they would do as they were told by K,  the widow&#39;s brother.   Same thing with \nUjio.  Same thing in the capture scene in the fog.\n\nThe battle sequences, one must remember, were western tactics, not Japanese.\n\nI am not trying to rationalize the movie,  I want to know the specific differences between history, tradition, and &#39;dramatic \nlicense.  That being said, I find it difficult to &#39;suspend disbelief&#39; in medical shows, because of my profession.  I also know that \nsome portrayals of medical procedures/information are deliberately inaccurate.\n\nIf the producers had wanted to make a more accurate film,  would it not have been more appropriate for &#39;the History Channel&#39;, itself \na bit inaccurate in it&#39;s re-enactments?\n\nLastly, a challenge:   I know it is easy to be an armchair jockey or quarterback.....    and it is possible to gain a position on a \nfilm production crew as a technical advisor.....    instead of complaining,  how about being pro-active and get involved in the \nprocess?\n\nAlways willing to learn,\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Nate Ledbetter\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Tuesday, December 14, 2004 2:36 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai, the movie.

I&#39;ve seen tons better. Shoot, even Kurosawa&#39;s\nworst battle scenes (melodramatic Kagemusha, anyone?)\nwere better than that.\n\nNate\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
