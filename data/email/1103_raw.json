I&#39;ll\nalso be in Tokyo,  Osaka, Nagoya and Kagoshima for short periods. I&#39;ve\nbeen to the area I&#39;m staying in before and know Hagi and Yamaguchi quite\nwell. I&#39;ve been reading Craig, Jansen, Wilson etc. Has anyone got any\nsuggestions for:\n1)further reading, especially social and women&#39;s history, or historical\nnovels (Japanese is a bit of the one page a day variety, but it&#39;s not\nimpossible - I&#39;ll have plenty of time for reading in rural Japan, and\ncan either buy books in Tokyo or get friends to order them for me)\n2) places to visit that give a sense of everyday life in pre-Meiji and\nMeiji times. museums, samurai houses, villages etc.\n3) historians or writers who&#39;d have time to talk to me (preferably in\nEnglish, but again, Japanese is not impossible.)\n\n\nbtw I&#39;ve got a second hand copy of a book called Secrets of the Samurai\nby Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook, published by Tuttle in 1973. Does\nanyone know this book and what&#39;s your opinion of its accuracy?\n\nThanks,\n\nGillian\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
