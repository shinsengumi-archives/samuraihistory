Its fantastic.\n\nJust wish people would accept this as fact and not\njust some guys in a movie scene watching some\nsoldiers. These were real ninja dressed as real ninja.\n\nOhh well off to watch Ninja 3 the domination for my\nsins (the sakura killers)\n\npaul\n\n\n\n--- Thomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nAgain, as Paul pointed out an age ago (hi Paul)\nthere&#39;s a scene \nin Kagemusha where 3 peasants (in the employ of the\nOda and \nthe Tokugawa) are watching &#39;Shingen&#39; review his troops\nand are \nconvinced it is he, which is the report that goes back\nto HQ.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
