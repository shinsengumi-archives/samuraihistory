Especially so since you argue with some people who have spent their lives studying things Japanese. I would suggest some \nhistory, rather than those with a martial arts focus.\n\nYour skin might want to get less sensitive as well; you&#39;re quite twitchy and reactive. I wouldn&#39;t trust you around me with neither \nbokken nor blade.  Do calm down, sir. You have nothing to prove, and by professing to know much, you prevent yourself from further \nlearning.\n\nGood day,\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: luke berryman\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, December 02, 2004 6:41 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] new subject\n\n\n\nYes I do know that Karate began before this. But what I am saying is that master Funakoshi&#39;s style is derived directly from the old \nways of Okinawa. Just because JKA was formed in the 20th century does not mean that it has lost the old ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.803 / Virus Database: 546 - Release Date: 11/30/2004 \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
