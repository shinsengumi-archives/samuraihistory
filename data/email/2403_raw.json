In the Middle East,  bronze was used as a metal for \nswords in the early Dynasties of Egypt.  But it was the introduction of iron as \nthe cutting edge---sorry about that !!!!!!-----in warfare technology that  \nallowed what could be called the Military Revolution of ancient times,  the \nbringing of Rome and Greece to prominence in the Mediterranean region.  Brass, to \nthe best of my knowledge,  was never a metal used in the making of swords,  \nbut has always been used in the makings of fittings for the swords and their \nscabbards.  All the best,  Professor Murphy,  The Japan Foundation\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
