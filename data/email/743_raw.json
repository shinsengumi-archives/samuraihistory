I&#39;d even bring the\n&gt; brandy and cigars!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tony, I think you&#39;d also want to talk with Jiro\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; ashigaru gunner! I&#39;d just want to hang out and\n&gt; listen\n&gt; &gt; to the master speak, hoping I could catch enough\n&gt; &gt; &quot;bungo&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; LOL! Frankly, yes. The tacticians and strategists I\n&gt; definitely want to talk\n&gt; to. But how could you *not* talk to the guys in the\n&gt; trenches?  The greatest\n&gt; tactician is nothing if the only army he commands is\n&gt; a chessboard, and his\n&gt; soldiers can&#39;t or won&#39;t fight.\n\nThis is giving me much needed relief from diagraming\nKrasnovian Mech Inf BN&#39;s defending in sector...\n\nYeah, I find I learn more from &quot;Joe&quot; than from anybody\nwho outranks me. &quot;Joe&quot; has as much to give to a\nleader/commander as the leader/commander has to give\nto him, and if the commander gives of himself, &quot;Joe&quot;\nwill do anything for him. You could have the best\nPLAN, but if you don&#39;t have the tools to execute...\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I think of it this way: The generals write the\n&gt; titles and chapter headings,\n&gt; while the soldiers actually fill in the individual\n&gt; paragraphs.\n\nOr for you football fans, the general diagrams the\nplays, the &quot;Joes&quot; run the ball.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The trouble is, *most* people don&#39;t want to read\n&gt; stories about the little\n&gt; guy; they want sweeping tales of battle where the\n&gt; &quot;little guy&quot; is a\n&gt; regiment.\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s too bad, because a. some of the most\ninteresting stories of war are at the battalion level\nand below...usually down in the companies and squads.\nb. Small unit actions are what wins wars...you don&#39;t\nwin house to house, you never take the key objectives\nthat accomplish the general&#39;s operational goals. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
