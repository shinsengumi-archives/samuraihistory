I sa=\r\nid TO BE CONTINUED.\n\nSince then, Buke power became stronger and stronger as=\r\n time \nwent by. And the chief of many of the Buke groupes came out. That \ni=\r\ns Heike. Kanmu Emperor had so many wives and so many children as a \nresult =\r\nof it, and finaly he couln&#39;t feed whole of his big family , \nso he decided =\r\nto seperate his fourth son, named price Kajiwara as \nHEISI and sentenced hi=\r\nm to become the chief of Buke group to gard \nEmperor family and his desenda=\r\nnts inherited HEISI name . One of \nthe groupes of HEISI was ISE HEISI follo=\r\nwed by Taira no Kiyomori who \nwas the first chief of BUKE having the power =\r\na little bit stronger \nthan Emperor and control the political administrativ=\r\ne business \nsupervising Emperor. \nHowever, the emperor at that time, aiming=\r\n to get back power over \nHEISI and utilize Genji group to upset HEISI.\nGenj=\r\ni was another chief of BUKE groupes . Emperor SEIWA got so \nmany wives and =\r\nso many children like Emperor Kanmu before and \nnominated number sixth prin=\r\ne , named SADASUMI as to become the Chief \nof BUKE as GENJI group. the dese=\r\nndants of SADASUMI inherited \nGenji group and did the job of gardman for En=\r\nmperor.\nYoritomo defeatd HEISI and became the first chief of Genji who \nfou=\r\nnded and was nominated the SHOGUN and formed government to \ncontrol The pol=\r\nitical administrative business.\nSince then, the chief of BUKE controled the=\r\n political \nadministrative business , pushed Emperor far a way aside untill=\r\n the \nend of TOKUGAWA era.\n\nThe Emperor who used to control policy with the=\r\n strongest power \nin Japan have to stay in small place in somewhere in KYOT=\r\nO without \nno political power , but just religious related power for a long=\r\n \ntime.\n\nNow at this point , here comes very famous question.\nWhy Emperor o=\r\nf Japan was not destroyed . Why many chieves of \nBUKE such as NOBUNAGA, ASH=\r\nIKAGA, TOKUGAWA didn&#39;t wipe out \nEmperor ? Only Japanese Emperor has been c=\r\nontinuing to exist in \nthis world since the begining , inheriting only one =\r\nsame blood. \nThe present Emperor ( HEISEI Emperor ) is the number 125th.\n\nL=\r\nooking forward to hearing your any comments about above \nquestion.\n\nEddie H=\r\niramoto\n&gt;\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have =\r\nbeen removed]\n\n\n"
