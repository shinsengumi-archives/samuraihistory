The grip is covered with an ivory colored pebbly material which I believe is the skin of a ray fish.\n\n  To show you how new I am to this, until a few weeks ago I did not know the blade could be removed from the handle. A friend showed me how. There is a signature on the tang, quite long - a large number of characters. My friend had someone translate the signature and was told that the smith who forged the blade worked as a smith during the 1680&#39;s.\n\n  So, now I am intrigued by the history of the sword and would like to see if I can find information about the smith.\n\n  If I can figure out how to do it, and if the moderators of the group say it is okay, I will be glad to add a few photos to the album for this group.\n\n  Thank you for your response and interest.\n\n  Scott\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Carlo Tacchini \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, May 04, 2003 12:20 PM\n  Subject: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\n\n  Thanks Mr. Moore.\n  I&#39;m interested to the blade as I read the reply of mr.

Williams [mailto:amacobra@...] \n    Inviato: domenica 4 maggio 2003 5.52\n    A: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n    Oggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\n    Mr. Moore,\n\n      Congratulations on your finds.  You truly have a treasure in your \n    possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it\n    professionally \n    cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the\n  blade\n\n    mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to\n  get\n    it \n    cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.\n      Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.  Professional\n\n    polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two\n    years \n    and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will\n    keep \n    any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.\n      I hope this helped you.\n\n\n    Peace,\n\n    Matt\n\n    _________________________________________________________________\n    The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \n    http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n\n    Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n    ---\n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n    Your use of Yahoo!
