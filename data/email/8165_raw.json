As I&#39;ve seen\nfor last two years this group is populated with a lot\nof people that have a very good knwoledge about Japan\nand about its history, so I throw you a question that\nmay be some of you can answer. Recently I&#39;ve listened\nabout the compund japanese term Yamato Damashii, I&#39;ve\ntried to find some information about but haven&#39;t\nsucceed too much, I think that is somtehing about\njapanese patriotic, ethics, feelings, ...\n\n�could you explain briefly what does Yamato Damashii\nmean?\n\n�can you recomend me some reading or book about this?\n\nThanks in advance and happy 2006 to everybody\n\nMiguel A.
