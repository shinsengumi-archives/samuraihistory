Eric \n&quot;M. R. Williams&quot; &lt;amacobra@...&gt; wrote:\nGreetings,\n\n  From what I have gathered from various readings and the teachings of my \nsensei the concept of a left-handed kenshi is against the mentality of the \nJapanese during the pre-Meiji periods.\n  Nearly everything in Japanese life was uniform, including the manner in \nwhich people wore their kimono and walked down the street.  People always \nwalked to the left, much in the manner that European people drive.  If there \nwas a left-handed kenshi, his saya would be hitting everyone that he walked \nby which would, in essence, be insulting and challenging to any other kenshi \nhe happened to meet.\n  Now I am not saying that there were no kenshi that were left hand \ndominant, but they were trained to use the daito as if they were \nright-handed.  Left hand dominant kenshi would have an advantage in the use \nof the wakizashi as a secondary weapon, since it could be drawn left-handed \nif the right hand was occupied.\n  I hope that this has helped in some way.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
