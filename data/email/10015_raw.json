I also think Nobunaga was successful. Since I believe the Maen=\r\no scrolls are legit (as does Konan city itself), I believe a large part of =\r\nNobunaga&#39;s success was due to his ability to utilize spies and sabotage wit=\r\nh both brutal and surgical results. \n   I do think that Nobunaga made a key=\r\n error (it does not take away from his success, but speaks to his story bei=\r\nng cut short) :\n                                               - He pushed =\r\nSakuma away and let Akechi too close\n                       I really believ=\r\ne that if he had not banished Sakuma --and with him the dismantling of Saku=\r\nma&#39;s intelligence network ( I know this factoid is controversial, but I hav=\r\ne enough evidence that I believe it) --- he would have been able to anticip=\r\nate Akechi&#39;s move. I think that Oda&#39;s banishment of Sakuma and his son was =\r\na BAD idea..just bad. He pushed away those who were truly loyal and concern=\r\ned for him and kept people who &quot;performed better&quot;, but really didn&#39;t care f=\r\nor him.\n    This is a classic mistake... He traded loyalty for effeciency..=\r\n. and as almost always happens, it destroys him.\n \n  * I want to note that =\r\nthe Hachisuka/Maeno network was, obviously, still present-- but do not forg=\r\net... that network belong to Oda THROUGH Hideyoshi...The Hachisuka and Maen=\r\no served Hideyoshi first and foremost...   Oda used then THROUGH Hideyoshi.=\r\n.. .. Sakuma&#39;s network was Sakuma&#39;s network, of course, but evidence sugges=\r\nt Oda had more influence over it due to Sakuma&#39;s ties to Nobunaga since chi=\r\nldhood..etc.etc.etc.\n \n        \n           \n\n--- On Sun, 10/25/09, jore ten=\r\ngu &lt;tengu64@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: jore tengu &lt;tengu64@...&gt;\nSub=\r\nject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Nobunaga-how successful was he?\nTo: samuraih=\r\nistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Sunday, October 25, 2009, 5:29 PM\n\n  \n\nthat wa=\r\ns not the point.even that he perished he accomplis a lot.but his dead makes=\r\n it difficult to value..anyway compare to yoritomo or takauji or hideyoshi =\r\nor ieyasu,nobunaga with his small start ,still make his mark in very diffic=\r\nult times.and alone...i think he is the man...\n\nTo: samuraihistory@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com\nFrom: steven_matsheshu@ yahoo.com\nDate: Sun, 25 Oct 2009 12:51:20=\r\n -0700\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Nobunaga-how successful was he?\n\nE=\r\nvery daimyo in history perished.
