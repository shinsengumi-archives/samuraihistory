If you tell me your\n&gt;sword talks to you, you&#39;re nuts. Sorry.\n&gt;\n\nNate,\n\n  A little strong I&#39;d say. Let&#39;s take a different approach. You pick up \n*something* that you are trained to handle. The weight, balance and feel are \nperfect for *you*, not in any way you can express. Something subliminal. \nThen that object *speaks* to you. I know I felt that way the first time I \npicked up a Glock 19 (and proceeded to put an extended clip in a silver \ndollar sized circle at 30 yards. Some of my best shooting ever). Sure a \nstandard issue M1911A1 will do the job, but it doesn&#39;t feel the same. For \nthe same reason I haven&#39;t bought a takeyumi at Asahi. Nothing there *spoke* \nto me. As a craftsman, lots of things *speak* to me on some level. I expect \nit&#39;s projection, like people ascribing human emotions to thier pets.\n\n  I wouldn&#39;t worry about it unless the gollum conversations begin. ;)\n\nM.J.Peters\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
