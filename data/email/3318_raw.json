I&#39;ll to keep it short as well.\n\tIn 1853 the American intrusion forced the Bakufu to call on all it&#39;s \nresources for an answer to the &quot;foreign question.&quot; One of the things \nthey chose to do was to petition the Court and the Tozama Daimyo, \nhoping that some brilliant solution or at least some consensus might \nresult. Instead it was a message to the entire country that the Bakufu \nwas crippled and powerless. The Court took a decisive albeit short \nsighted stand against foreign intercourse, which much of the country \nsupported, starting a shift of power from Edo to Kyoto.\n\tPrior to the 1850&#39;s Mito was a hotbed of Kokugaku, &quot;Japanese History&quot;, \nand where in their scheme of things greater loyalty was owed the \nEmperor than the Shogun, even though they were a house in line for the \nShogunate. In fact it was Mito Komon who &quot;discovered&quot; Kusunoki \nMasashige, located his grave and made him a national hero.\n\tIn Choshu Yoshida Shoin was preaching an anti-foreign and pro-Court \nmessage that took hold among the young men of his Han. In Han all over \nthe Japan of the time politically active young men had two choices, \nstay within their han and advocate for reform or leave and head to \nKyoto or Edo and try their hand there. In some cases out of deference \nto their lords they became ronin, or they had no other choice if they \nwere to travel to the capitol and take part in the action.\n\tSome Daimyo were unable or unwilling to act, others maintained a level \nof &quot;plausible deniability&quot; by fostering opposing factions within their \nhan. Thus if their advocates failed they could disown them, or swing \nthe whole han over to the successful policy. Therefore the Lord could \nbe seen to be acting thru his more radical subordinates, while assuring \nhis old guard that nothing would change. Of course this was a policy \nthat put extraordinary power in the hands of mid-level samurai. Beyond \nthat I&#39;ll be spoiling the story so, enjoy...\n-t\n\n\n"
