Farmers, artisans and even \nmerchants had a say in village life and an evolving culture.\n\nThe emerging daimyo, however, crushed this appearance wherever they\nfound it, and instituted an autocratic hierarchy which often stifled \ndevelopments across the social spectrum. Under the emperor all \nthat mattered was that the samurai rule. Any flowering of samurai \nculture happened with daimyo patronage and primarily with the \naim of boosting the patron&#39;s esteem, and whilst there was social\ndevelopment, the samurai made sure they were &#39;top of the tree&#39; as it \nwere and nothing happened without their approval. The lowly farmer, \non whose crops the whole edifice relied, was reduced to nothing, with \nno voice and no representation.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n"
