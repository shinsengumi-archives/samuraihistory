It was OK to keep the shoto in the obi\nas a samurai would never be totally unarmed. Dependant on which side the\nlong  sword was placed indicated the state of preparedness. Basically, if\nremoved from the obi and placed on your right-hand side, this was taken as\nbeing relaxed and no threat. If on the left hand side, then a greater level\nof preparedness was indicated, but precisely how it was placed, upped the\nlevel. For instance if the back of the sword was closest to your left side,\nthis was less intimidating than if the curve was away from you as, in this\ncircumstance, it would be unnecessary to turn the sword before drawing it.\nThis could seem quite a threatening position. Further, if the left thumb had\npushed the tsuba so that the habaki (collar) was clear of the koi-guchi\n(scabbard mouth), then this was most threatening and meant that the owner\nwas fully anticipating that he would need to draw his sword! If he then\nraised up onto his toes, coming out of the &quot;safe&quot; seiza position, he was\nabout to fight.\nSword etiquette was very important to the samurai as usually nobody wanted\naccidentally to become involved in situations where blood was shed. It is\nprobable that the rules of etiquette were refined and structured in the\nTogugawa period where the only action likely to occur was in a one-on-one\nsituation, but here I speculate somewhat. Rules of sword etiquette  still\napplies today although the bloody consequences of poor etiquette are less\nlikely, however, good etiquette shows the difference between the educated\ngentlemen and the less well educated. It is unlikely that you will be able\nto view important swords in Japan (on a hands-on basis) such as National\nTreasures etc.unless you have already shown that you fall into the &quot;educated\ngentleman&quot; catagory.\nAs for No-dachi, I guess they can do whatever they want!! although more\nseriously, I prefer a katana-kake as oversized swords are less well balanced\non a tachi-kake.\nClive Sinclaire\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dean Wayland&quot; &lt;dean@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 17, 2006 6:12 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] SWORD SETS\n\n\n&gt; Hi Clive,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the feedback. You also wrote:\n&gt; &gt;    Also interesting are the various positions in which a katana is\n&gt; &gt;    placed on\n&gt; &gt;    the floor at one&#39;s side when kneeling in front of another.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can hazard a few guesses at what would be involved, but I would be\n&gt; very interested to hear what would have been the correct practise in\n&gt; this circumstance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also on the topic of mounting tachi on a tachi-kake, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt; It is\n&gt; &gt;    incorrect\n&gt; &gt;    as is often seen, for the tsuka to be at the top when placed on a\n&gt; &gt;    proper\n&gt; &gt;    tachi stand.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I owned but one sword, my other half bought me a tachi-kake to\n&gt; display it. I was aware at the time of how to correctly use it, but out\n&gt; of curiosity I experimented with mounting it the wrong way round, to see\n&gt; if I could deduce the reasoning behind the practise. I found two things,\n&gt; (a) the end of the saya (kojiri?) would try to escape from the small\n&gt; indentation in the base, and (b) due to the point of balance being\n&gt; somewhat higher than it should be, the sword was easily dislodged.\n&gt; Needless to say ever since, I&#39;ve always done as you previously outlined.\n&gt;\n&gt; Incidentally would I be right in thinking that a large weapon like a no-\n&gt; dachi/ou-dachi would also be displayed on a tachi-kake?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean\n&gt;\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
