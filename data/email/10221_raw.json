The city itself really experien=\r\nced a dark period. Think kind of like the image of the wild west, but set i=\r\nn medieval Japan. Murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping for ransom, famine were=\r\n all common place in the immediate aftermath. In addition to the books alre=\r\nady mentioned I would also suggest Kyoto in the Momoyama Period by Wendell =\r\nCole to see the long term effects of city being devastated. It might be tou=\r\ngh to find, I got a used copy through Amazon, but if you can get it for a d=\r\nescent price it is worth reading to see how long lasting the effects of the=\r\n Onin War itself, and the wide spread civil war that followed affected Kyot=\r\no.  \n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Cearb@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All=\r\n--\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know (or can anyone point me to a good source) what spe=\r\ncific buildings were destroyed in Kyoto during the Onin war?
