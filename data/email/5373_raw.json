The story chronicles a young\n&gt; girl&#39;s rise from \n&gt; poverty in a Japanese fishing village to life in\n&gt; high society.\n&gt; \n&gt; The lead role of Sayuri will go to Zhang Ziyi, the\n&gt; Chinese actress \n&gt; who starred in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and\n&gt; appeared in the \n&gt; comedy &quot;Rush Hour 2,&quot; her publicist said Thursday.\n&gt; \n&gt; For those unfamiliar with the story, a geisha is a\n&gt; Japanese woman \n&gt; schooled in the art of dance, singing and\n&gt; conversation to be a \n&gt; companion for wealthy men.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zhang, 25, has been working to perfect her English\n&gt; for several years \n&gt; and now speaks the language with little difficulty.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is the first time that I will play the lead in\n&gt; an English-\n&gt; language movie. It will be a big challenge, but the\n&gt; studios, \n&gt; producers and director have shown great confidence\n&gt; in me. I will \n&gt; continue to do my utmost to make this the best role\n&gt; I&#39;ve ever \n&gt; played,&quot; she told The Associated Press.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken Watanabe, an Oscar nominee for &quot;The Last\n&gt; Samurai,&quot; will portray \n&gt; the Chairman, a high-powered executive with whom\n&gt; Sayuri falls in love.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; co-star,\n&gt; Michelle Yeoh, has \n&gt; signed to portray Mameha, the elegant and\n&gt; experienced geisha who \n&gt; becomes Sayuri&#39;s mentor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Geisha&quot; will be directed by Rob Marshall, the\n&gt; Oscar-nominated \n&gt; director of &quot;Chicago.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Marshall has long wanted to make this his next\n&gt; project, but was \n&gt; locked into a contract with Miramax Films, while\n&gt; Columbia Pictures \n&gt; and DreamWorks SKG held the rights to &quot;Geisha.&quot;\n&gt; After lengthy \n&gt; negotiations that threatened to block his\n&gt; participation, a deal was \n&gt; eventually reached among the studios.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We could not be more excited about the\n&gt; extraordinary cast that we \n&gt; have in place for &#39;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot;&#39; said\n&gt; Marshall, who&#39;s also a \n&gt; Tony-winning director and choreographer. &quot;We are\n&gt; adapting a beloved \n&gt; piece of literature that has become a worldwide\n&gt; sensation, which made \n&gt; it important to me to assemble a cast with a\n&gt; prestigious \n&gt; international profile.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; For many years, Steven Spielberg was interested in\n&gt; directing the \n&gt; film. He will now serve as a producer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;From the time I first read Arthur Golden&#39;s novel, I\n&gt; wanted to see \n&gt; this as a film,&quot; Spielberg said. &quot;It&#39;s a uniquely\n&gt; compelling story \n&gt; rich with characters who take you into a world you\n&gt; have never \n&gt; experienced before.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Production is set to begin in the fall, but the\n&gt; release date has not \n&gt; yet been specified.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
