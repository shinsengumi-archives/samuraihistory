It gets talked about often like it was\na breakthrough in military tactics--and I think it\nwas. But not because of the rotating firing\nlines--that had been done before. \n\nTo me, Nagashino confirms Nobunaga&#39;s military genius.\nNot because he used rotating firing lines, but because\nhe analyzed his enemy and came up with a perfect plan\nto defeat him. The way he combined the natural\nterrain, the obstacles, and the fires is exactly like\nthey teach us as military officers. Unfortunately,\nTakeda Katsuyori didn&#39;t listen to his officers, like\nmodern S-2&#39;s, who would have told him no way they\nshould go in there. Oh well. \n\nNate\n\n--- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Thanks!
