Safer place to have it.\n&gt; The left hand was used for a shield to protect the heart.\n&gt;\n\nSorry, this is horribly false.\n\nThe sword was in the dominant hand. I&#39;ve fenced with many a lefty.\n\nFor the record, sword-and-shield  combat is the opposite of fencing. In the\nformer, the shield side is in FRONT (because the shield is BETWEEN you and\nthe opponent) and if you&#39;re left handed that puts your &quot;heart&quot; closer to the\nopponent, and the sword farther back. In fencing, your sword is out in front\nbecause you want the maximum distance between you and the opponent. If you&#39;re\na lefty, your left side faces; if a righty, your right side faces.\n\nThere have been left-handed rapiers and so on, so it&#39;s pretty clear that\nthere were lefties fighting in Europe.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
