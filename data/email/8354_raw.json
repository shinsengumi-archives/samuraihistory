My contention is that no other man has\n&gt; influenced the beauty and indeed personality of Japan more. His micro\n&gt; management of everything from the basic design of a farmhouse to the\n&gt; distance between road stations and his insistance that all warriors\n&gt; practice the peacful pastime of the arts is still felt in everyday\n&gt; Japan. My companion beleives that the Tokugawa Shuguns by shuting off\n&gt; Japan for 200 years created unrepairable damage to the Japanese\n&gt; society. I am interested in the thoughts of this group.\n\nIt may come as no surprise, but I think that the both of you \nare both right and wrong, and for a whole slew of reasons. &lt;G&gt;\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
