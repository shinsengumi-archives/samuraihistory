My contention is that no other man has \ninfluenced t=\r\nhe beauty and indeed personality of Japan more. His micro \nmanagement of ev=\r\nerything from the basic design of a farmhouse to the \ndistance between road=\r\n stations and his insistance that all warriors \npractice the peacful pastim=\r\ne of the arts is still felt in everyday \nJapan. My companion beleives that =\r\nthe Tokugawa Shuguns by shuting off \nJapan for 200 years created unrepairab=\r\nle damage to the Japanese \nsociety. I am interested in the thoughts of this=\r\n group.\n\nRob Hirai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
