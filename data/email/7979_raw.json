The book from where you take all those informations are only in japanese? I was able to find something interesting but nothing else...I mean something like the poems you help me to translate it is very hard to find!\n\n\nGillian Rubinstein &lt;gillian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; You will be thanked on the first page of my thesis! Not only you gave \nme interesting books and web site where to find some stuff about \nTakasugi, you also help me with the translation!\n\nNo problem. In fact the last question you raised was of great interest to \nme as it introduced me to Nomura Motoni, about whom I knew \nabsolutely nothing, but now I am very interested in her and her life. I&#39;m \nreading an article about her at the moment in a book I bought a few \nyears ago called Shiro to Onna, but which I hadn&#39;t got around to \nreading before. One of the other women in this book, from the \nbakumatsu period, is the mother of Yoshida Shoin. Can&#39;t wait to get to \nknow more about her too.\n\n&gt; Maybe I will send you something about Takasugi written by myself!\n\nI&#39;d love to read your thesis: maybe you could send it to me off-list as \nan attachment some time. It&#39;s okay if it&#39;s in Italian as I can probably \nread it. (Italian from many years ago, very rusty but still there \nsomewhere)\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
