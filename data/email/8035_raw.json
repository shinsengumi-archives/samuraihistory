They\nare =\r\nof course, very good for Iai-do and I hear (although I have no personal\nexp=\r\nerience) that they are improving in quality. I even hear that certain\nmukan=\r\nsa level Japanese swordsmiths are regularly visiting Shanghai and\nteaching =\r\nthe making of Japanese swords to local craftsmen, presumably for\ncommercial=\r\n considerations.\n\nHowever, the point that I am struggling to make is that C=\r\nhen swords are in\nno way comprable to fine swords from the pre Meiji period=\r\n or even the hand\nmade swords from post Meiji jidai. These swords are known=\r\n, because of their great beauty, as Token Bijutsu and those of particular h=\r\nistorical or\ncultural importance are of great value. There is, therefore, a=\r\n world of\ndifference between the more practical swords of Paul Chen and &quot;re=\r\nal&quot;\nJapanese swords. I just think that it is importanat that those who buy\n=\r\nChinese made Japanese swords, if that is not a contradiction in terms, are\n=\r\nlabouring under no illusions.\n\nI write the above in answer to James&#39;s quest=\r\nion But if its not the best or a top level one what is? Who can I look for.=\r\n \nIf I have the wrong end of the stick on this discussion, please forgive m=\r\ne.\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;james wilson&quot; &lt;joh=\r\nntwo8@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, Novem=\r\nber 24, 2005 5:48 AM\nSubject: Re: R: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new katana=\r\n HELP PLEASE!!!! ok\nquick question\n\n\nI am not a sword guru but I have seen =\r\na sword by Paul Chen and its the best\nyou can get where I am from.
