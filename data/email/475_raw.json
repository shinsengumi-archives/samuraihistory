The samurai sourcebook has some good basic stuff as well as someone mentioned earlier the book Samurai Warfare both by stphen turnbull.\n\nIf you want an ok online source check:\n\nhttp://www.obershawonline.com/castle/index.html\n\nIt has some good info and pics.\n\nMusashi\n\n \n\nAfter a couple of off line requests, heres a bit more detail on the\nKiller Katana series of clan booklets for every body.\n\nThe KK booklets have around 24 pages.\nSeveral pages gives clan details and history.\n\nYou then have orders of battle for two battles, plus where possible\ninformation on Samurai in service at the time (a list of names).\nThen information on the battles including some maps, and some Mon and\nheraldry details.\nI think they cost around 6 dollars US or 6 pounds UK sterling.\n\nThe bibliography also lists Rekishi Gunzo as a source for some of the\nbooklets.\n\nHope that helps\n\nKind regards\n\nRob\n-- \nrob broom\n\n\nYahoo!
