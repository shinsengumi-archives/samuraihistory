Especially the name \n&quot;Staerkodder.&quot;  Does that come from the attempt to sell it to Denmark?  I \nwas also unaware of the sister ship.  I have been having a hard time finding \ninformation on this ship.  I can only assume it is because I do not now \nwhere to look.  Woud you be so kind as to tell me where you found this out?  \nMy main source of information so far has been on the US Navy Military \nHistory site.\n  I have an account written by one of the Confederates who served on her \nduring the trans-Atlantic voyage from France to Cuba.  I will dig it up and \nsend it to you if you are interested.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWatch the online reality show Mixed Messages with a friend and enter to win \na trip to NY \nhttp://www.msnmessenger-download.click-url.com/go/onm00200497ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n"
