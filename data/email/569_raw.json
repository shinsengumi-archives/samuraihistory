Its the kind of book that\nabsorbs you into the world it is set in. It is truly\namazing how much detail was in it.\n\nClavell got the samurai&#39;s way of life perfect. The\nonly complaint I have, is that I wish he wrote the\nlast battle in first person perspective. There was\nsuch a build up to it. It doesn&#39;t spoil the book\nthough, not even close.\n\nI get shivers up my spine every time I read it.\n\nA great book,\n\nLee\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you&#39;ll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n"
