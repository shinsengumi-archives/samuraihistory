This\nmethod was widely used in thes West as well until fairly recently. I\nknew some much older machinists who would let you watch them perform an\noperation but sure as hell wouldn&#39;t explain it. Nowadays students expect\nmore explanations.\n\nG:  A contrasting perspective on this idea is that the people who do things\nbest are not always the ones who are capable of explaining it best.  I think\nit highly probable that the original teachers of martial arts fell into this\ncategory, and that this became the accepted model for such teaching.  ...I\nalso confess to a sneaking suspicion that this served to cover a great deal\nof poor teaching over the generations.  And that&#39;s not necessarily an insult\nto any of the teachers, in my mind, because what other model for the art of\nteaching did they have themselves?  Here&#39;s a case where I think mystique\nserved no good purpose.  Teaching is an art unto itself, and can be applied\nwith good results to pretty much any external discipline.  (Internal\ndisciplines are more tricky.)  Myself, I come from a teaching background,\nand I find that if I can explain a concept clearly, I can get the student to\nlearn faster.  (In many cases, this means less of a straightforward verbal\nexplanation and more of a method of evoking the correct kinesthetic\nsensation:  I don&#39;t want to suggest that anyone can simply be talked through\nlearning - say - to cut correctly.)  I find that this approach involves far\nless frustration for me and the student both.  So my experience, at least,\nJames, is that most skills involving physical co-ordination can be taught\nwith good results, using a very different method than the one you&#39;ve\ndescribed here.\n\n&gt;Well, not quite, but the assimilation of knowledge\n&gt;through training and kata is not &#39;head knowledge&#39;\n&gt;but &#39;heart&#39; or &#39;body knowledge&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;but once the hands understand what they&#39;re supposed to do,\n&gt;best leave it up to them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nCorrect practice makes perfect. A slightly improved saying.\nG:  I&#39;d say both of those have merit; I don&#39;t think they&#39;re quite the same.\nThe former speaks more to me of training the intuition, the latter of\ntraining the form.  The art would be incomplete without both.\n\tGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
