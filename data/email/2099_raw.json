Just asking!\n\n\nThe Wolf of Mibu\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Masamori Masami&quot; \n&lt;oni_shogun@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; After the arrival of Commodore Perry, Japan was thrown into chaos \n&gt; and fear. Many samurais, especially those of lower ranks, began to \n&gt; doubt the power of the Shogunate in defending the country against \n&gt; foreign powers, especially when they had seen the armed blackships. \n&gt; The slogan &quot;Sonno-Joi&quot; (Rever the emperor, dispel the barbarians) \n&gt; was winning more and more support, such that samurais desert their \n&gt; hans to come to Kyoto to join the revolutionary movements. (In \nthose \n&gt; days deserting your han can be one of the most condemned sins - \nonce \n&gt; you desert, you can never return to it, on pain of death.) \n&gt; \n&gt; Such roshis (masterless samurais, but not ronins and definitely not \n&gt; rurounis) increased in Kyoto, causing more and more disturbances at \n&gt; the capital. In those early days of unsatisfied feelings, most of \n&gt; the roshis still did not have a clear idea of what movement or who \n&gt; they should follow. All they knew was that they were impatient and \n&gt; eager to do something to defend Japan. There were myriads of \nschools \n&gt; of thought - Sonno-joi, open up the country to learn from the \ngaijin \n&gt; and in turn attact them using the same technologies, support the \n&gt; Bakufu - as Watsuki once remarked, it was an era where 100 people \n&gt; may hold 100 different arguments and you can&#39;t say who&#39;s wrong. \nIt&#39;s \n&gt; one factor which makes this era as tumultuous and interesting as it \n&gt; is. The Bakufu decided that it would be to their advantage if they \n&gt; took such roshis without any stand yet into their service, rather \n&gt; than letting them roam about the capital. Hence, Roshi-tais (bands \n&gt; of wave samurais) were formed and roshis enlisted under respective \n&gt; Bakufu samurais, where the &quot;entry requirements&quot; were one&#39;s sword \n&gt; skills (kenjutsu matches, something like an exam, were held.) This \n&gt; happened in 1863 or 3rd Year of Bunkyuu, one year after Kaoru&#39;s \n&gt; birth. \n&gt; \n&gt; *note direct from a website\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;merridewe&quot; &lt;merridewe@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for this.

It \n&gt; &gt; is a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit novelized, but still a very interesting depiction (and very \n&gt; well \n&gt; &gt; &gt; researched) of some Shinsengumi members, including Isami \n&gt; &gt; Kondo and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kamo Serizawa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope that helped...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new. Hope I&#39;m in the right place to ask this. I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; researching \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; key figures of the Shinsengumi, particularly Isami Kondo and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kamo Serizawa. They were of course members of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shinsengumi, but I&#39;ve also run accross something called the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shinchogumi. It that the same thing? If not, what is it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any help much appreciated,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; St. John Lord Merridewe\n\n\n\n"
