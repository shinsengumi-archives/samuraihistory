I&#39;ve been away. I had simultaneously huge problems with \nboth of my families: in Japan (a divorce - not mine!!!) and in Europe \n(my mom was sick, and my sister was on a train in Madrid the day of the \nbombs - no BS!! She&#39;s ok, luckily). I used my spring-break to fix all \nthe mess, but sadly I wasn&#39;t able to go to Kyoto and to participate to \nthe discussions on this mailing list. Now I have 395 messages to \nread... hihihi.\nI missed you guys.\nciao\nCepo, from Honolulu\nPS=I&#39;ll be in japan in the summer, so the gathering is still up, uh?\n\n\n"
