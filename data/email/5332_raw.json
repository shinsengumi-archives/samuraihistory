In that sense it can be \n&gt; said that there were &#39;ranks&#39;.\n\nBut those aren&#39;t ranks. They&#39;re JOBS. There&#39;s a difference, and it&#39;s a fairly\ncritical one. Ranks tend to have a consistency. A lieutenant always has X-number\nof people under him, a major X-number of people, a general X-number and so on. A\ntaisho can have 50, 500, or 5,000.\n\nThe most basic &quot;rank&quot; -- that of kashira or taicho^, doesn&#39;t even have a number.\nA taicho^ (lit. &quot;group-chief&quot;) can have five people or 50 under him, depending on\nthe job and the specific assignment.\n\n&gt; On top of that there were of course the ranks in terms of the \n&gt; Shoku-i \u001b$B?&0L\u001b(B system.\n\nYes, but the Ritsuryo^ Code has nothing to do with this. :)\n\n\n&gt; This is very well said! In fact (as you and I have exchanged on this \n&gt; list before), even the title Shogun is not in essence a &quot;rank&quot;. It \n&gt; is really a job description. IN fact the title &quot;Shogun&quot; is not even \n&gt; part of the Shoku-i ranking system.\n\nActually, IIRC, it&#39;s a fifth-court-rank position.\n\n&gt;&gt;It refers to someone who leads a large body of troops.\n&gt;&gt;That could be 10,000 troops, or 300. Obviously if you\n&gt;&gt;lead 10,000 you are probably more important, and of\n&gt;&gt;higher &quot;rank&quot; than the guy with only 300, but you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt;still both &quot;Taisho&quot;. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Ah - here&#39;s what I was getting at. But beyond this, of course an \n&gt; ashigaru is lower than a taisho. So at some level wouldn&#39;t you be \n&gt; able to call this a &#39;rank&#39;?\n\nNo, again, due to the big difference between the concept of &quot;rank&quot; and &quot;job&quot;.\nYou could call ashigaru a *class* of samurai, perhaps, but it&#39;s not a rank per\nse. Ashigaru had different functions. Some might be section or squad leaders\n(taicho^ or kashira) or what have you; sometimes &quot;full-fledged samurai&quot; might\nhold those positions.\n\nThe thing is, it is VERY important to divorce the concept of terminology of\nMILITARY rank from samurai -- they just don&#39;t operate on the same level. There\nis rank, yes, but that&#39;s SOCIAL rank, not military rank.\n\n&gt; Then of course to confuse matters more we have that Ashigaru \n&gt; Taisho.....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Similiarly, you&#39;ll see things like &quot;Ashigaru-gashira&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;etc., but again, these are job titles, not ranks. A\n&gt;&gt;&quot;Kashira&quot; is the head of a particular unit, so the\n&gt;&gt;ashigaru-kashira would be the leader of a small unit\n&gt;&gt;of ashigaru, kind of like a platoon leader in the\n&gt;&gt;modern army. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This specific example seems in my way of thinking to blur the lines a \n&gt; bit. It seems to me that once &#39;promoted&#39; to ashigaru-gashira a person \n&gt; would not go back to being a plain ashigaru. In other words this one \n&gt; seems more like a permanent promotion rather than just a \n&gt; battle-by-battle job assignment. What do you think?\n\nThere&#39;s no rule. In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and duties are\nheld at the pleasure of the overlord in question. There is no way to say &quot;I&#39;m a\nfirst sergeant, you can&#39;t make me a private without due cause and a\ncourt-martial.&quot; Even &quot;permanent&quot; appointments (such as that of a taicho^) in a\nJapanese army were understood to be continued appointments that could be\nwithdrawn at any time (or magnified with further postings) and not one&#39;s &quot;right&quot;\nto the position.\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
