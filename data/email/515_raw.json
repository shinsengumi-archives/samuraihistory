My suggestion to Scott would be to attack\nthe subject one topic at a time, for example if you\nwant to start with military history then you can pick\nup one of Osprey?s men at arms books. Good primers,\nwhich is what it sounds like you are interested in.\nThe book that got me into the military history of\nJapan is ?Arms and Armor of the Samurai?. \nIf, however you just want a general overview of the\nentire history of Japan then ?Japan, its history and\nculture,? by W. Scott Morton is reasonable.    \n\n\n=====\n&quot;I do not think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday.&quot;\n-Abraham Lincoln\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
