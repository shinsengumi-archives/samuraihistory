The sequel is better, and the =\r\nsetting is the Three Kingdoms period in China, but it is arguably a similar=\r\n time period with the samurai in Japan.  The games is somewhat abstract, tu=\r\nrn based, and involves armies lead by officers who convey special movements=\r\n and tactics.  It is turn based and on tiles almost like a chessboard excep=\r\nt with different terrains and fortresses and things. Armies are made up of =\r\nunits like archers, swordsmen, pike men, crossbows, catapults, cavalry, eng=\r\nineers, etc.  Also there are different goals like taking specific castles, =\r\ncapturing specific enemy officers, and more.\n\nThese games are both very fun=\r\n and easy to get into games, and both are probably very cheap on the web as=\r\n they are older titles.\n\nKoei who publishes these games does make other sam=\r\nurai related video games, and I always wanted this type of game made with S=\r\namurai involved.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nBryan B. \n\n\n"
