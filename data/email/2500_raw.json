I forgot) or\n&gt; Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Nagashino 1575&quot;. These will help dispel\n&gt; some of the more common misperceptions of this battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@e...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Sure, guns were used since the 1550s, but it was at\n&gt; &gt; Nagashino,  that \n&gt; &gt; for the first time the &quot;volley firing&quot; was used. By\n&gt; &gt; having shooters \n&gt; &gt; rotating behind a palisade, Nobunaga used for the\n&gt; &gt; first time firearms \n&gt; &gt; in an effective way. The rotation of shooters meant\n&gt; &gt; no gap between one \n&gt; &gt; bullet and the next, and the palisade defended them\n&gt; &gt; from the charging \n&gt; &gt; opponent. No army fighting with medieval weapons and\n&gt; &gt; tactics could have \n&gt; &gt; ever won against that, in fact in Nagashino some\n&gt; &gt; 10,000 of the Takeda&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; men died, two third of the entire army.\n&gt; &gt; Regarding firearms, the Japanese started to make\n&gt; &gt; their own in the \n&gt; &gt; 1550s, copying from the Portuguese models. One of\n&gt; &gt; the main foundries \n&gt; &gt; was in Sakai (today South Osaka), and that&#39;s why\n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga really wanted \n&gt; &gt; to take that town - which, of course, he did.\n&gt; &gt; Cepo,\n&gt; &gt; Honolulu\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Nov 16, 2003, at 8:55 AM,\n&gt; &gt; murphymurphyjohn@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; With the reliance on firearms by Kenshin and\n&gt; &gt; Takeda, I believe that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kawanakajima ought to be considered a Renaissance\n&gt; &gt; era battle.&#63728; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed,&#63728; I would submit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that, although a middle point in the Age of the\n&gt; &gt; Country at War,&#63728; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; introduction at Tanegashima in 1543 of Portuguese\n&gt; &gt; firearms ought to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; considered the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning of Modern War in Japan,&#63728; as the\n&gt; large\n&gt; &gt; use of cannon in Italy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in 1494\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by the French is often considered the beginning of\n&gt; &gt; the epoch of modern \n&gt; &gt; &gt; war in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Europe.&#63728; I know Chinese firearms were there\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; approximately 1511 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [pace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turnbull],&#63728; but they were not nearly as\n&gt; &gt; sophisticated as the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Portuguese,&#63728; and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; large contracts vetted for Oda Nobunaga after\n&gt; &gt; their introduction seems \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to bear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out my point.&#63728; I hope Tony Bryant has some\n&gt; &gt; thoughts he can share here?&#63728;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&#63728; Profmurf\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
