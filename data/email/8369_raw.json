Consequently, they \nhad no problems (aside from a few minor hicups early on from a few \nmalcontents early on, when folks were still adjusting to the new order).\n\nI would argue that the Tokugawas&#39; longevity was due to isolation, which \ninsulated Japan from change. The minute Commodore Perry hit land, the \nTokugawa were doomed (well, maybe not doomed. But they obviously weren&#39;t \nable to keep up.).\n\nDavid Kocot\n\nJan Versoza wrote:\n&gt; I think one of the main reasons why the Tokugawa\n&gt; regime lasted so long was because of the style of\n&gt; swordsmanship they studied. I believe that the\n&gt; strategic concepts inherent in Yagyu Shinkage-ryu, the\n&gt; sword art practiced and chosen by the Shogunate as one\n&gt; of its official styles, guided them in their decision\n&gt; making. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;The Tokugawa regime was amazing. Probably the\n&gt;&gt;longest-surviving\n&gt;&gt;authoritarian regime that I can think of off-hand.\n&gt;&gt;It&#39;s interesting to study\n&gt;&gt;to find out about the nature of authoritarian\n&gt;&gt;regimes, especially ones as\n&gt;&gt;successful in its longetivity as this one.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hopefully there will be more discussion on this.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Nina \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;[mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt;&gt;On Behalf Of Anthony Bryant\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Wednesday, February 08, 2006 8:31 PM\n&gt;&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Change of subject\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Rob wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;A friend and I were recently having a debate over\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;enduring results of \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the Ieyesu Tokugawa reign. My contention is that\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;no other man has \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;influenced the beauty and indeed personality of\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Japan more. His micro \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;management of everything from the basic design of\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;a farmhouse to the \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;distance between road stations and his insistance\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;that all warriors \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;practice the peacful pastime of the arts is still\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;felt in everyday \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Japan. My companion beleives that the Tokugawa\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Shuguns by shuting off \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Japan for 200 years created unrepairable damage to\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;the Japanese \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;society. I am interested in the thoughts of this\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;group.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;It may come as no surprise, but I think that the\n&gt;&gt;both of you are both right\n&gt;&gt;and wrong, and for a whole slew of reasons. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Tony\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-- \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Anthony J.
