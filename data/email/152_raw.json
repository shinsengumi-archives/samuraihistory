I&#39;m not a fan of the book\nmyself, I disagree with a lot of his conclusions. \n\nCould a samurai warrior\n&gt; use firearms on the field of battle in any time in\n&gt; their history,\n&gt; without loss of honor?\n\nWell, guns were really only introduced in the\nmid-1500&#39;s, 1542 for portuguese firearms and somewhat\nearlier for chinese models. Rather than &quot;losing\nhonor&quot;, they were quickly used to &quot;win battles&quot; by\nmost daimyo. Granted, the use was mainly relegated to\nashigaru troops, but many important daimyo also\npractised with arquebuses, including Oda Nobunaga and\nTokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu was considered a better shot\nthan most of his retainers. \n\n As Perrin&#39;s book will tell you, the gun was phased\nout and the samurai sword mystique was\ncreated...whether it was part of a Tokugawa bakufu\nplot or not, I&#39;ll leave up to you. Keep in mind that\nthere was no open warfare for over 200 years, so what\nwas the use of guns? Samurai did not hesitate to use\nthem during the civil war. \n\nNate Ledbetter\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
