I mean was this the start of \n&gt; the  series of events that lead to the strat of Japan as we know it\ntoday. Like how long where those that where  \n&gt; so totally aginst the shogun around like that. I hope i am making\nsense. Look forwanrd to your   response. \n&gt; Thank  You.\n \nBy the time the black ships arrived the shogunate was already in\ndecline. What the black ships did more than anything else was reveal how\nweak the shogunate actually was, which came as a real shock to many. The\nenemies of the shogunate and the Imperial court were quick to seize on\nthis discovery and kick-start what was likely inevitable anyway, black\nships or no black ships - the bakumatsu, or &#39;last days of the\nshogunate&#39;.\n \nThe tozama clans, such as the Shimazu of Satsuma for example, had held a\ngrudge of sorts ever since the formation of the shogunate due to their\nexclusion from national politics & the many other predjudices shown to\nthem due to their tozama status despite being one of the oldest and most\npowerful of all the clans.\n \nThe shogunate became a very corrupt body, and as soon as it began to\nlose it&#39;s true military nature (after the first three shoguns) it began\nto lose it&#39;s effectiveness and really struggled to deal with the rapidly\nchanging conditions in Japan during the 18th and 19th centuries. The\nstructure of the shogunate - a ruling body loosely overseeing largely\nautonomous states who each have their own military power - was long\noutdated by the mid-19th century, especially when compared with the\nEngland&#92;Russia&#92;France&#39;s of the world. If the shogunate had not fallen\nwhen it did it could have been disastrous for Japan, because the lack of\na national military and true national government would have invited\ntrouble had the other world powers, Russia perhaps most especially,\nattacked.\n \n---\nAngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
