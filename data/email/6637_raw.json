Have been thinking more about anti-western \nfeeling in Satsuma and think I  need to look into it more. In 1864 \npermission was sought to send young Satsuma samurai to London (as \nChoshu did in 1863) to study Western technology and government. 16 \nor more went to University College in 1865 (There are 16 in the photos \nbut I can&#39;t remember how many went.) I guess after the attack on \nKagoshima anti-western feeling would increase,  along with the \nrealisation that Japan could not defeat the West with contemporary \nweapons and forces. So admiration of the west and a desire to know \nmore about them would also have been there. \n\nThis was the position Katsura, Inoue and Takasugi had reached in \nChoshu by 1862/3, a position not shared by the conservatives in the \nhan or the more radical loyalists. But what were Saigo&#39;s thoughts at this \ntime? I&#39;d really like to know.\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"
