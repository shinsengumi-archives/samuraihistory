Mr. Clive Sinclaire is by far the ultimate authority on NihonTo\nth=\r\nat post here. But I want to say my opinion.\nIn another Forum in which I&#39;m i=\r\nn, Sword Forum International, a lot of\ntopics are on Paul Chen or Last Lege=\r\nnd, Bugei or Cicada Forge or\nDGuertin modern REPLICAS.\nThey are made in sev=\r\neral different types of carbon steel, almost all in\nMarugitae, the best one=\r\ns in the line even folded, a very few in\nKobusegitae but NOONE with Tamagah=\r\nane. Some have Koshirae quiet good,\nand tight enough for the purpose they a=\r\nre made : TAMESHIGIRI.\nThey are made to be used, scretched, ruined, bended,=\r\n chipped and all the\nbad nightmare&#39;s things you really wantn&#39;t to happen to=\r\n your beautiful 5k\nShinsakuto, or to any other REAL (and beautiful) NihonTo=\r\n. I&#39;m planning\nto buy a DGuertin for training, too.\nBut I found there that =\r\nexists a collector market for these items too.\nSome people elaborate and cu=\r\nstomize so much their pieces reaching\nconsiderable amounts of bucks. Others=\r\n orders the blades to American\nTosho (far from the japanese standard in my =\r\nopinion) and than ask for\ncustomized mounts and koshirae, made sometimes in=\r\n a more &quot;modern&quot; way.\nHere too the amount of bucks requested is high, reach=\r\ning (ormore) the\namount for a good ShinsakuTo. But these are much higher in=\r\n quality and\ndeserve an higher respect as they are uniques. De Gustibus Non=\r\n Est\nDisputandum but in my opinion the above mentioned Paul Chen etc etc ar=\r\ne\nmerely something better than a Bokken.  \n           \n\n-----Messaggio orig=\r\ninale-----\nDa: Nate Ledbetter [mailto:ltdomer98@...] \nInviato: gioved=\r\n=EC 7 ottobre 2004 0.49\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: [sam=\r\nuraihistory] Swords\n\n\nCarlo, where are you? Please enlighten us with your\nv=\r\nast knowledge, and lead us from the dark path of Paul\nChen! \n\nThink about i=\r\nt people: you want a SAMURAI sword. If\nyou&#39;re looking for swords that resem=\r\nble samurai\nswords, fine, go with these 3rd class reproductions.\nIf you don=\r\n&#39;t have the cash to put up for the real\nthing, and don&#39;t care that it&#39;s not=\r\n the real thing, go\nfor it. But I know for a fact you can get decent real\ns=\r\nwords for under $5000 through various dealers.\nCarlo&#39;s probably the expert-=\r\n-where are you????\n\nNate\n\n--- Anthony Escobar &lt;kondo_isami@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n\n&gt; I for one am a big sword collector. My opinion\n&gt; however on Paul C=\r\nhen is that yes he makes alright\n&gt; practical katana, but there are swords o=\r\nut there a\n&gt; hell of alot better. I\n&gt; recently bought a new iaito as i do s=\r\ntudy iaido, but\n&gt; that was about an $800 sword.\n&gt; It really depends on what=\r\n you want to do with it.\n&gt; You also have to consider your budget\n&gt; as they =\r\ncan get extremely pricey. So if you&#39;re\n&gt; looking for something to cut with,=\r\n you&#39;ll \n&gt; want to get a live blade. If you are intersted in\n&gt; Iaido or jus=\r\nt a decorative item, you might \n&gt; get an iaito. Regardless of what purpose =\r\nyou&#39;re\n&gt; getting it for, you will be spending alot.\n&gt; As for practical blad=\r\nes, yes Paul Chen has some good\n&gt; ones, but Pual Chen isn&#39;t very\n&gt; authenti=\r\nc. I myself have had 2 Paul Chen blades for\n&gt; Tameshigiri (rice straw cutti=\r\nng) and \n&gt; I wasn&#39;t very impressed or satisfied. Not to mention\n&gt; that one =\r\nof them came with scratches \n&gt; already imbeded in the blade. So try to stea=\r\nr clear\n&gt; of those; to expensive for crap. But if you&#39;re\n&gt; looking for a go=\r\nod practical katana, or even an\n&gt; iaito, go to www.swordstore.com,\n&gt; www.bu=\r\ngei.com, www.samurai-store.com, and\n&gt; www.tozando.com. Bottom line, you&#39;re =\r\nnot \n&gt; going to get even a decent sword for under $250.\n&gt; Well good luck! \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Robert Birker &lt;snipersergeant2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; www.888knivesrus=\r\n.com The best I&#39;ve seen.  Paul Chen\n&gt; swords are sold there and Paul Chen i=\r\ns very good for\n&gt; quality and authenticy.  Just my opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robert\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; zevlord &lt;LordZev@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; As you all know th=\r\nere are quite a few sites selling\n&gt; sword on the net. \n&gt; I am looking at pu=\r\nrchasing a set of swords from a\n&gt; reputable supplier. \n&gt; So would like to a=\r\nsk you guys who have purchased\n&gt; your own sword/s \n&gt; where you got them fro=\r\nm and if you would recommend\n&gt; that supplier. If \n&gt; you could tell me what =\r\ntype of sword/s you\n&gt; purchased, the cost (using \n&gt; US currency) and the we=\r\nbsite if they have one, that\n&gt; would help me \n&gt; alot.
