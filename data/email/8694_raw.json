This is the first in a series discussing the\nhistory o=\r\nf Kyushu and Okinawa and featuring major academic contributors.\n\nTitle: Gat=\r\neway or Gatekeeper?\nCentral participants:  Bruce Batten, Obirin University,=\r\n Japan and Wang\nZhenping, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\nSubj=\r\nect:  Medieval communication between Kyushu and the Asian continent.\nDate: =\r\n May 1st to May 7th, 2006.\nParticipation: The forum is open to anyone who w=\r\nished to register and\nparticipate: specialist, student or amateur.\nLocation=\r\n: www.kostudies.com/forum\n\nIntroduction: Two myths dominate the story of Ja=\r\npan&#39;s relationship\nwith the outside world. The first and most common is tha=\r\nt Japan was an\nisolated country, opened by the arrival of Commodore Perry. =\r\nThe second\ncompares Japan to an oyster, because the foreign influence that =\r\nit\naccepted was no bigger than a grain of sand.\n\nIn recent years, those myt=\r\nhs have come under attack from researchers\nstudying medieval communication =\r\nbetween Kyushu and the Asian\ncontinent. We are delighted to announce the pa=\r\nrticipation of two\nauthors whose work details a far richer and more complex=\r\n environment.\nProfessors Batten and Wang describe a time in which pirates,\n=\r\ndiplomats, traders, monks and soldiers sailed to and from Japan.\n\nMuch of t=\r\nhis scholarship is new. For example, Professor Batten\nexamines the K=F4roka=\r\nn, the official guest-house for foreign visitors,\nwhich was located in Haka=\r\nta, now located inside the modern-day city of\nFukuoka. A thousand years ago=\r\n, most visitors to Japan would have\narrived by ship at Hakata Bay, the one =\r\nand only authorized gateway to\nJapan.  For years the site was buried undern=\r\neath the city&#39;s baseball\nstadium and only in recent years, after the demoli=\r\ntion of the stadium,\nhas the evidence been unearthed. Professor Wang also u=\r\ntilizes recent\narchaeological findings and little-known archival material t=\r\no come to\nnew conclusions about relations between Japan and the outside wor=\r\nld.\n\nProfessor Batten approaches the topic by covering the history of\nHakat=\r\na from 500 C.E. into the medieval period. He has chapters\nfocusing on war, =\r\ndiplomacy, piracy, and trade. Professor Batten has\nspent his professional c=\r\nareer focusing on Kyushu and has had access to\nthe latest archaeological di=\r\nscoveries in the area. Chapter 4 of this\nbook, &quot;Gateway to Japan&quot;, availabl=\r\ne to visitors of this symposium,\nfocuses on a single case study. By focusin=\r\ng on the particularly\nwell-documented case of a Chinese junk that arrived i=\r\nn Hakata in 945,\nProfessor Batten showcases many of his findings, including=\r\n those on\nimmigration, trade and official attitudes toward the outside worl=\r\nd.\n\nProfessor Wang&#39;s focus is on diplomatic relations and a series of\nimpor=\r\ntant embassies sent from the Japanese islands to Sui and Tang\nChina. Wang e=\r\nxplains in detail the rigorous criteria of the Chinese\nand Japanese courts =\r\nin the selection of diplomats and how the two\nprepared for missions abroad.=\r\n He journeys with a party of Japanese\ndiplomats from their tearful farewell=\r\n party to hardship on the high\nseas to their arrival amidst the splendors o=\r\nf Yangzhou and Changan and\nthe Sui-Tang court. One of his central ideas, ou=\r\ntlined in the\nintroduction is that the traditional view of China&#39;s tributar=\r\ny system\nis oversimplistic. He argues that it was not a unilateral tool of\n=\r\nhegemony but a more complex situation in which multiple partners were\nable =\r\nto modify the rules depending on the times and circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
