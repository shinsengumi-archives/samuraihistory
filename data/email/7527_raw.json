Native japanese \nhorses have become extremely rare (one breed is down to 1 remaining \nstallion). Almost all yabusame today is practiced with retired thoroghbreds \nas they are more readily avaiable. The thoroughbreds being bigger (and \nfaster) while the course has been maintained at the traditional length is , \nIMO, the reason one rarely sees multiple hits at yabusame demos.\n\nM.J.Peters\n\n\n&gt;the takedaï¿½s are related to the genji and still today they have many\n&gt;schools where you can practice their old traditional war\n&gt;diciplines.one speciality is the riding bowman.at full speed they\n&gt;fire their bows on targets while they are riding on special equal\n&gt;stepping horses.\n&gt;these horses are being mentioned in european historybooks on the\n&gt;reason why the european knights where unable to stop the mongolian\n&gt;invasion.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
