Being a man who admits when he is \n&gt; w=\r\nrong I concede to the fact that squid may be written in katakana \n&gt; althoug=\r\nh I have not seen this in any of the sushiya I frequent. \n\n&gt; However I beg =\r\nyou please tell me how ika may be written in kanji. \n&gt; With all these messa=\r\nges for this one small matter I certainly hope \n&gt; the original asking membe=\r\nr has been satisfied.\n&gt; \n&gt; I may be expelled from this group for saying thi=\r\ns and that would be \n&gt; truly a shame as I have enjoyed the various conversa=\r\ntions immensely. \n&gt; Far too often the conversations turn away from a pleasa=\r\nnt learning \n&gt; experience into an aggressive &quot;my stick is bigger than your =\r\nstick&quot; \n&gt; banter. It is understood that many of the writers hold degrees in=\r\n \n&gt; Japanese history. That being said it is also true that many of us \n&gt; do=\r\nn&#39;t. Does that make us somehow unworthy of comment or do you \n&gt; simply deri=\r\nve pleasure in the belittlement of others? \n\n\nAs the moderator and owner, l=\r\net it be known right now that I don&#39;t\ncare about &quot;feelings&quot;. Anyone who wan=\r\nts warm fuzzies and emotional\ncoddling can feel free to join this group:\n\nh=\r\nttp://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/oprah/\n\nAs far as I can tell, there are a f=\r\new things at work here on this\nlist. First, the people who have been here t=\r\nhe longest and still post\nfrequently all have known eachother for a few yea=\r\nrs now. Some of us\nhave even met in real life. Since we are the &quot;in&quot; crowd =\r\n(being\nmoderators and/or people who are in with the moderator crowd) we ten=\r\nd\nto not feel the need to &quot;self-edit&quot; our posts for the emotional\nsecurity =\r\nof others. We play rough. Another thing at play here is that\nmost of the ol=\r\ndbies here are 1. guys, 2. guys who don&#39;t particularly\nworry about offendin=\r\ng others, and 3. Quite independent, fairly\ncynical, and don&#39;t mince words. =\r\n Some people take this as being\ninsulting or being an outright attack on th=\r\nem. It isn&#39;t.  We are a\nsarcastic bunch, but a pretty cool group once you g=\r\net to know us,\nunless you are the sensitive type that feels that sarcasm is=\r\n always\nmean and nasty. Don&#39;t expect us to put on velvet kid gloves when we=\r\n\npost. I can&#39;t type with gloves anyway. \n\nRemember rule #4, which should ha=\r\nve been read when anyone joins the list:\n\n4. Have a thick skin and do not t=\r\nake things\npersonally. While we won&#39;t allow personal insults, you\nmust be a=\r\nble to handle being told you are wrong,\nespecially if you are wrong. No one=\r\n on this email list\nis infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle\nsa=\r\nrcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you\nwhine. The easiest thing =\r\nto do is just not take things\npersonally. If you post a theory that does no=\r\nt fit with \nwhat is commonly known and accepted as history, \nthen back up y=\r\nour ideas with sources OR face the wrath \nof the more knowledgeable. Save y=\r\nour tears.\n\nSome people may be insulted by this post and leave. Oh well. Do=\r\nn&#39;t let\n the door hit you on the way out, or strain your finger clicking th=\r\ne\n&#39;leave this group&#39; button, or whatever. For the rest of you who aren&#39;t\nto=\r\no sensitive to the written word, keep on posting, keep on asking\nquestions,=\r\n and keep in mind that sarcasm is just because it is funny,\nit isn&#39;t an att=\r\nack, and a lot of the time, you may think you are being\nattacked when all i=\r\nt is is just a straight answer. People here don&#39;t\ntend to wrap the truth in=\r\n a warm silk blanket, with perfume and roses.\nSometimes we hit bludgeon you=\r\n with it. I understand that some people\nare touchy feely, and I have to put=\r\n up with that in the real world.\nBut this isn&#39;t the real world, this is MY =\r\nworld. That&#39;s what us\nin-group people have the perrogative to do. Consider =\r\nit some minor\nhazing in order to get into the fraternity (although there ar=\r\ne women\ntoo). I am not PC, and I could give a rat&#39;s ass about being PC. Put=\r\n up\nwith the hazing long enough, and you might find you accidentaly\nlearned=\r\n something. And after a while, you too may end up in the in\ncrowd, and sit =\r\nwith us at the cool table in the cafeteria.\nYou have been warned, fortunate=\r\nly or unfortunately (depending on your\nlevel of moral indignation) this is =\r\nthe way this place is run, so if\nyou can handle it, you are super kewl. If =\r\nnot, Ted Nugent is\ndissapointed in you. And maybe I am too.\n\nAnd, for the r=\r\necord: I have only banned one person EVER for being\ncombatitive, and that w=\r\nas because they were emotionaly erratic.\n\nAnd maybe most importantly, don&#39;t=\r\n forget who you are dealing with:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/e2fck\n\n\n\n\n\n"
