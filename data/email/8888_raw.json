Normally when swords are &quot;at rest&quot; on a\nkatana-kake they would be placed with the omote (front) side of the blade\nfacing out, this means the kurikata is visible. Were it to be placed the\nother way, ie easier to pick up as you describe, it would indicate a state\nof high alert.\nAlso interesting are the various positions in which a katana is placed on\nthe floor at one&#39;s side when  kneeling in front of another.\nYou mention tachi, which are slightly different. A tachi, if on an ordinary\nkatana-kake is place with the cutting edge downwards so that it also\nsimulates the position when worn. More often and more correctly, a tachi is\nplaced on a different type of rack so that it can stand vertically, with the\ntsuka (handle) resting in a small indentation on the base. It is incorrect\nas is often seen, for the tsuka to be at the top when placed on a proper\ntachi stand.\nRegards\nClive\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dean Wayland&quot; &lt;dean@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, June 16, 2006 2:59 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] SWORD SETS\n\n\n&gt; Hi Clive,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; A daisho on a katana-kake is\n&gt; &gt;    normally\n&gt; &gt;    with the katana on the top and the wakizashi at the bottom, to make\n&gt; &gt;    it\n&gt; &gt;    easier to pick up the katana in an emergency, in those days when\n&gt; &gt;    these\n&gt; &gt;    things mattered.\n&gt;\n&gt; Was there any customary significance to the weapons orientation when\n&gt; displayed on a kake? I was under the impression that the tsuka was\n&gt; placed at the left, so as to be seen in the same orientation as when\n&gt; worn?\n&gt;\n&gt; It occurred to me that if a katana/tachi were mounted the other way\n&gt; around, it could again in an emergency be more easily taken up with the\n&gt; left hand while being drawn with the right, or is this just being\n&gt; fanciful?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt; http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
