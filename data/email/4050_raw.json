In the battle of \nMikatagahara, after suffering a serious defeat, Tokugawa Ieyasu had \nthe gates of his castle left open, bonfires lit, and drums sounded \nso that his army could easily retreat. The Takeda general Baba \nNobufasa hesitated seeing this, expecting a trap.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, James Eckman \n&lt;ronin_engineer@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   From: Eponymous13@a...\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Re: Re: Samurai\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hey.\n&gt; &gt;       I agree, Jim, maneuvers can be beautiful.  I&#39;ve known how \nto play \n&gt; &gt;chess since I was about three years old, and agree on that \ntopic.  :-)  If you can \n&gt; &gt;get the enemy to surrender without a fight, that&#39;s always \ngood.  :-)   But \n&gt; &gt;war, as a whole itself, to call that beautiful is the oxymoron.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I admit these Flower? wars were a very rare exception of wars \nwithout \n&gt; violence. There are a few famous Chinese examples of this as well \nwith a \n&gt; Chinese general with far too few troops throwing open the gates of \na \n&gt; city to scare off the opposing general who thought that there must \nbe \n&gt; some clever trap involved. I&#39;m trying to think of a Japanese \nexample but \n&gt; I can&#39;t, though the Japanese must have certainly read about it \nsince the \n&gt; Chinese classics involved were required reading in certain periods \nfor \n&gt; the cultured man.\n&gt; \n&gt; Normally war is a nasty affair and to paraphrase Eisenhower, the \nonly \n&gt; thing I hate worse than war is the people who make it necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Re: loyalty and honour\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Fair enough but how do you define a &quot;right&quot;side in a war. Surely \nthat is just a matter of oppinion and if so then there is no correct \nhonour, just how you percieve it?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; The winners are usually the right side ;) Just ask em!\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n\n\n"
