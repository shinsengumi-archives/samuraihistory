Thankfully this\n&gt; one is done in hiragana, better to read.\n\nI also just bought the rekishi manga series on the\nBakumatsu, with the Shinsengumi in it--I can&#39;t\nremember right now the name of the series, but it&#39;s\nthe one I was reading here as a student suu-nen mae. I\nfigure it&#39;s as good a way as any, and i might actually\nunderstand some of it.\n\n \n&gt; Yes that&#39;s right. Her name is Nogiwa Yoko\n\nShe&#39;s SOOOO good at playing Onibaba!\n\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way do you have access to cable or skyperfect\n&gt; yet. The first episode\n&gt; of Nobunaga was repeated on Saturday; Onna Taiko-ki\n&gt; will be in February and\n&gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu will start in march!!!!!\n\nI&#39;ll be getting SkyPerfect at my house in Yoyogi...I\nwon&#39;t move in for another week or so, but that&#39;s\nnegotiated into my lease. I&#39;ve got the first episode\nof Nobunaga, King of Zipangu on tape, watched part of\nit last night--the rest I&#39;l have to catch once I&#39;m in\nthe house...\n\nso does the jidai geki channel come with Sky Perfect,\nor is it something seperate I have to order??\n\nNate\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
