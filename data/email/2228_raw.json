Most of the regulations were established\nby Iemitsu in the 1630&#39;s. For more info you might check out a book &#39;Feudal\nControl in Tokugawa Japan&#39; by Toshio Tsukahira. It will give you the whole\nhistory of the system.\n\n&quot;. How much time did they have to spend there&quot;\n\nIt depended on the Daimyo. Most spent one year. Some for example the\nMatsumae of Ezo, because of the distance, were exempt from attendance.\n\n&quot;Where did these lords stay? A kind of &quot;guest&quot; castle, or where...?&quot;\n\nThey had there own permanent residence (sometimes even two). Remember the\nDaimyo went back and forth to his domain but his family always lived in Edo.\n\n&quot;I would like to know what does Iwamura mean (or perhaps Iwa and mura\nseparated, I think it has\nto do something about a hawk?)&quot;\n\nIt depends on what kanji you use to write it. There are two historical\nfamilies by that name both written as 岩村 which can be translated as &#39;rock\nvillage&#39;. I wouldn&#39;t however worry to much about the meaning of the name.\nMost samurai names were taken from the place they settled in.\n\nAs for the other questions I can&#39;t answer offhand but again check our\nTsukihiras tome.\n\nIf you are writing historical fiction may I suggest some writers that may\ngive you a feel for the genre. Ryotaro Shiba, Eiji Yoshikawa, Kunio Tsuji,\nShotaro Ikenami, Masuji Ibuse, Shusaku Endo. All of these have some works\ntranslated into English.\n\n\n\n"
