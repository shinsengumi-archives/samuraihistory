They&#39;ll be \nreading a more outspoke=\r\nn movie while seeing an eyeful of heroic \nconflict and sacrifice. \n\n    I f=\r\nirst saw &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; in its original 160-minute import \nversion when I =\r\nwas in high school. By this time, more than four years \nafter its Japanese =\r\npremiere, the movie already was a revival \nattraction, one of several forei=\r\ngn-language landmarks that came to my \nattention while frequenting the long=\r\n-gone Berkeley, Calif., \nstorefront theaters the Cinema Guild & Studio, man=\r\naged at that time \nby Pauline Kael. \n\n    Both the auditoriums and the scre=\r\nen sizes were cramped, to put it \nkindly, so quite a few years went by befo=\r\nre I saw a suitably \nmagnified &quot;Samurai.&quot; \n\n    Columbia, the U.S. importer=\r\n, also had renamed it &quot;The Magnificent \nSeven,&quot; the title of 1960&#39;s durably=\r\n appealing John Sturges-directed \nWestern homage to Mr. Kurosawa&#39;s prototyp=\r\ne, which co-starred Yul \nBrynner and Steve McQueen. \n\n    Film historian Do=\r\nnald Richie prepared the groundwork for an \neventual restoration of the com=\r\nplete &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; in his 1965 \ncritical study, &quot;The Films of Akira Kuro=\r\nsawa.&quot; His appreciation was \nshadowed by a provocative caveat: &quot;Nevertheles=\r\ns, &#39;Seven Samurai&#39; has, \noutside Japan in 1954, never really been seen. Thi=\r\ns is one of the \nmajor cinematic tragedies.&quot; \n\n    Americans weren&#39;t the on=\r\nly ones who had been shortchanged. A \nlater historian, Stuart Galbraith IV,=\r\n chronicled the careers of Mr. \nKurosawa and his pre-eminent leading man, T=\r\noshiro Mifune, in a volume \ntitled &quot;The Emperor and the Wolf.&quot; Mr. Galbrait=\r\nh wrote: &quot;Because of \nits extreme length, the complete &#39;Seven Samurai&#39; ... =\r\nwas limited to \nits first few weeks [of release], and only in Japan&#39;s bigge=\r\nst cities. \nIn rural areas and in subsequent runs it was cut to a more \nman=\r\nageable, if compromised length.&quot; \n\n    Evidently, the shortened Japanese ve=\r\nrsions corresponded to the \n160-minute export edition, which betrayed littl=\r\ne slack and dazzled \nits first generation of U.S. admirers. A complete reis=\r\nsue began \ncreeping up on the public eager to discover it. There were \nscat=\r\ntered &quot;special event&quot; bookings toward the end of the 1960s and a \nPBS telec=\r\nast in 1972. However, another decade passed before the \nJapanese distributo=\r\nr, Toho, mounted a full-blown theatrical revival \nof the whole show, which =\r\nreached Washington in spring 1983 and \nclinched the case for greatness. \n\n =\r\n   The cuts had shaved certain episodes to the bone. The \nrestorations disc=\r\nlosed how methodical, straightforward and detailed \nthe complete scenario h=\r\nad been. All the subplots, the private little \ndramas played out against th=\r\ne larger crisis of defending and saving \nthe village, were systematic and a=\r\nbsorbing rather than fleeting. \n\n    The cumulative effect added thematic w=\r\neight and dignity to what \nalways had seemed a nobly envisioned and realize=\r\nd movie. \n\nIncredibly, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is still demonstrating room for \nimp=\r\nrovement in the first decade of a new century. The video editions \nof the m=\r\novie have yet to reflect the recent changes to the subtitles, \nso for the t=\r\nime being, the most complete &quot;Samurai&quot; is an exclusive at \nrepertory theate=\r\nrs. \n\n    Who says things are always going from bad to worse? In this case,=\r\n \na great movie keeps getting better than you realized. \n     \n\n    TITLE: =\r\n&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (&quot;Shichinin no Samurai&quot;) \n\n    RATING: No MPAA rating (Made=\r\n in 1954, decades before the advent \nof a rating system; adult subject matt=\r\ner, with occasional violent \nepisodes, including extended battle scenes; oc=\r\ncasional profanity, \ncomic vulgarity and fleeting sexual allusions) \n\n    C=\r\nREDITS: Directed by Akira Kurosawa.
