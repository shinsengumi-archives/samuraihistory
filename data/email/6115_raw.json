Yes, I chuckled and shared it with a couple of friends; they&#39;re \nwondering what the words were.  I told them to check out Babelfish if they wanted to know; it&#39;d likely be close enough.  I wonder if \nthe visiting sensei was one who abhorred Westerners.  I cannot presume to accord the &#39;traditional/legendary&#39; traits of detachment \nand courtesy to all sensei.\n\nI shall be very careful about my learning any Japanese.  And from whom.\n\nAlways happy to laugh,\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Thomas Davidson\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, December 02, 2004 6:46 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: How not to learn Japanese\n\n\n\nHi Lizzie -\n\nMany years ago someone told me his dojo were being good little\naikidoka and saying &#39;thank you&#39; to a visiting sensei from Japan\nat the end of an evening&#39;s workout.\n\nEach time he muttered something in reply, which later none of\nthem could make out.\n\nOne of their number had a Japanes woman working at his company,\nand at the water cooler he asked her if she might help him with\ntranslation. She agreed and he repeated what had happened. She\nwent bright red and walked away.\n\nSome time later she appeared at his desk, and apologised for\nher reaction, but explained that it was locker-room talk and\ntranslated roughly as &#39;up your arse.&#39; (This is England,\nremember.)\n\nSo I&#39;m thinking you&#39;re probably right.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n      Yahoo!
