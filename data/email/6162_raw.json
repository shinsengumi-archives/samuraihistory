Owl&#39;s Castle\n(Fukuro no shiro) is nice. I&#39;m sure some of our movie\nbuffs will have more. \n\nIt can be amusing...\n&gt; for a few minutes, if\n&gt; &quot;Desperate housewives&quot; isn&#39;t on at the moment.  \n\nMost of the time I don&#39;t feel as if I&#39;m missing\nAmerican TV...then there are times...\n \n&gt; See? Pull out not-very-useful fact and wave it\n&gt; around to distract people\n&gt; while you slip the other direction. \n\nWhatever works for you. \n\n&gt; In the meantime, then, I shall be chastened to\n&gt; return to the pearl isle to\n&gt; learn more about how many soldiers you have to\n&gt; provide for every cho of\n&gt; riceland you own (and here I thought, all along,\n&gt; Koko was the name of the\n&gt; gorilla who did the sign language with a cat.  With\n&gt; a CAT! The cat can&#39;t do\n&gt; sign language.  It was a doomed experiment).\n\nI must say, your style, though bizarre, is refreshing.\nKind of like Tolkein on acid. \n\n What did the sandal-bearer and the\n&gt; rain-hat carriers do?  Rain-hat\n&gt; carrier?  This, from a list on page 9 of Mr.\n&gt; Turnbull&#39;s Samurai (&quot;u&quot; not &quot;a&quot;)\n&gt; Armies: 1550-1615 Osprey book.\n\nWell, the job titles are pretty self-descriptive, I\nshould think. Care to elaborate on your question?\n\n&gt; You&#39;ve got all these ashigaro carrying all sorts of\n&gt; things, but to have a guy\n&gt; to carry rain hats?  Interesting.  And sandals?\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t people carry their\n&gt; own? Maybe they were artisans to make/create new\n&gt; ones when old ones wore out\n&gt; or damaged.  Still... \n\nAs in Europe, the more people at your beck and call\nfor utterly mundane things, the better off you must\nhave been. But sandal bearer, though it DOES relate to\nsetting the masters sandals out for him to step into\nwhen he steps down from the veranda, is also a bit of\na personal attendant position. Toyotomi Hideyoshi (aka\nHashiba Hideyoshi, aka Kinoshita Tokichiro, depending\non what stage of life you want) started out as a\nsandal bearer to Oda Nobunaga. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
