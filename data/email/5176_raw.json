I&#39;d pay Y1500 for that ticket!\n\n\nDuring WWII the Brits wanted to take out some lock gates in \nFrance. The lock was too close to a civilian site to bomb, too \nheavily defended for the Resistance to attack.\n\nAt the Royal College of Art in London, a special department was \nworking on disguises - timers that looked like pens, and, I kid \nyou not, anti-personnel mines that looked and smelled like \ncowpats.\n\nMI attained drawings of the locks, and the guys at the RC saw \nthat the canal was topped up by a river, the overflow sluiced \nthrough a tunnel beneath the lock itself.\n\nSolution: A dead dog was packed with explosives and a \npressure switch, and parachuted to the resistance, who dumped \nit in the canel above the lock. The dog floated down, under the \nnose of the guards, was sucked into the sluice where the water \npressure triggered the switch and bang! Success!\n\n(Not sure about the exploding cowpats, though)\n\nThomas.\n\n\n"
