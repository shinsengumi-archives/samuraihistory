I have to disagree.  There are all kinds\n&gt; of . . . . . \n\nHow does practicing a martial art relate to Japan, Japanese history, \nand samurai in such a way that you would &#39;know&#39; the answer? Being a \nmartial artist alone doesn&#39;t qualify one to answer on matters of \nJapan. (although I will concede it will give you the ability to infer \nwhat types of clothing will be fitting for defending yourself while \nsitting, etc.)  I spent 6 years as a dedicated martial artist before \nspending two years living in Japan as a student and was utterly \nshocked about how warped martial artists in the USA view japan and \nthe beliefs they hold of it (for the record, I was one of them). I am \nqualified to say this because I was, as I mentioned, a dedicated \nmartial artist, who before moving to japan listened to and believed \nall that I heard about Japan from fellow martial artists - who also \nhad never been there.  If you have lived in Japan, then forgive me.. \nif not, don&#39;t believe everything that you hear from the martial arts \ncommunity. There is no other way to say it but to say that it is for \nthe most part wrong (inane arguments about how to pronounce &#39;ryu&#39;, or \nthe etiquette of bowing &#39;like they do in Japan&#39;, or most importantly \nwestern views on how the martial arts are percieved in Japan -- most \nJapanese either don&#39;t care at all, or view it as a &#39;sport&#39; - \nsomething like wrestling or hockey).  From what I &#39;knew&#39; before \nliving in Japan, all Japanese take martial arts, and the samurai \npracticed in karate dojos all day... Japan is a country like any \nother, life does not revolve around nature and buddhism and the \nmartial arts, etc.  I&#39;m not saying that your argument is invalid, \nhowever the way you phrased your response struck a chord with me.\n\n\n"
