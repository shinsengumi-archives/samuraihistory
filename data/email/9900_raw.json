In the U.S., this was Lincoln&#39;s proclamation to free African-American slaves. In Japan, it was the Meiji government&#39;s proclamation to end the feudal outcaste catagories of &quot;eta&quot; (extreme filth) and &quot;hinin&quot; (non-human). In both cases, there was resistance by people against these groups (freed slaves in the U.S. and &quot;new commoners&quot; in Japan) that wound up in attacks and lynchings as well as continued segregation and discrimination. \n\nHmmm, maybe we&#39;re not so different after all. \n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Steven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wed, 29 Apr 2009 10:28 am\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Parallels in US and Japanese history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne sad similarity between US and Japanese history is the displacement and attempted genocide of the native people by the &quot;new government&quot;. I am of course drawing a parallel between the policies and actions of the European settlers/US government towards Native Americans and the Emishi/Ainu/etc....\n\nNot just in the land-grabbing and killing--- but we also saw many Emishi come to work for the new Emperor(s) --- just like some natives allied with the new US.\n\nWe also see that the tactics brought in from the old country (Europe for US, China for Japan) were no match against the guerilla tactics of the natives---and newer devices and strategies had to be made to fight them.\n\nAlso--the idea that many Ainu hid their ethnic origins to avoid problems reminds me of many native families (that can) hiding their origins to avoid problems.\n\nAs far as I know though...there are not any &quot;Japanese reservations&quot;.. but both groups still fight over &quot;indigenous rights&quot;...\n\nEtc.etc....\n\nHowever, I would say this pattern is common anytime a foreign invader comes in and &quot;colonizes&quot; an area..\n\nBut, still.. I would say that is applies. \n\nThoughts? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
