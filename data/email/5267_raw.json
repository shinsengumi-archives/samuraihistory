I don&#39;t expect to be able to contribute very much as, quite frankly, most of you guys seem WAY out of my league. But I am very interested and very keen. My main interest is the military side of Japanese history.And I would like to pose a purely hypothetical question, I do hope no one objects. If Kublai Khans invasion force had not been destroyed by the &quot;Divine wind&quot; in 1281. Who and why do you think would have emerged victorious, the Mongols or the Japanese ? I have thought about this a good deal and I think It would have been the Japanese, mainly because of the Mongols not being able to maintain a supply line. On the other hand, apart from a relatively minor clash in 1221, there had been no real warfare in Japan since the Gempei war. Where as the Mongols were battle hardened. However, I am sure this is all very open to debate. Any takers? \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
