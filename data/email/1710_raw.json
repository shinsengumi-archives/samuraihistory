Also before the meiji era \nkatana and wakisashi(Daisho) where worn only by the samurai class.\n\nThough the meiji era didn&#39;t detur the carring of swords. it was \ndurong this time that we see the rise of the tsueken cane sword. \nAnyway back to Carlos&#39;sword.( I imagine it to be his as i think he \nstarted the thread) it is an interiting peice but somethings about it \nvex me: Are there characters on the other side of the tang? I was \nunable to gleen such information from the photo&#39;s. Also where did the \ntsuka come from? it seems quite athentic but the tsuba doesn&#39;t seem \nto fit, more the elongated hand guard.\n\nHopefully that answered more questions than it posed\n\nMeisei\n\nAtsi Kazuri\n\n\n"
