There were many small groups of Samurai who\ndid what Ken Watanabe`s character did. It really was a wide scale\nyet disorganized rebellion against turning their backs on traditional\nJapanese values.\n\nAlthough I live here, I realized how little I had known about the\nSamurai and their value system. I study yoga and Buddhism, and both\nreminded me of the values of the Samurai. Maybe that is surprising,\nyet all three value a quieting of the mind, and spirtual study it \nwould seem.\n\nKevin\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Pamela Grayer&quot; \n&lt;m.grayer@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Konnichi wa, sensei,\n&gt; &gt; Well, the film was at least as entertaining as &quot;Excaliber&quot; \nwas...and\n&gt; &gt; the armor looked a damn sight better!\n&gt; &gt; ;-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed, though The Last Samurai was *supposed* to be based on a \nactual\n&gt; historical period, whereas Excalibur was based entirely on a book: \nMalory&#39;s\n&gt; &#39;Morte d&#39;Arthur&#39;.\n&gt; Michael\n\n\n\n"
