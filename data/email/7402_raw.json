While it does have quite a \nfew pictures of &quot;black PJ clad assassins&quot; and other ahistorical ninja \nlore like the straight sword, this is done to illustrate how the ninja \nmyth wormed its way into popular culture. No book on ninja would be \ncomplete without addressing the wild stories that have sprung up around \nthem.\n\n\n\n\n"
