Pur=\r\ne iron with 0.8% carbon added is tool steel, comparable to the edge steel o=\r\nf a katana. The hardness of iron/steel is manipulated by varying the carbon=\r\n content and heat treating appropriately. Modern steels are alloys with ele=\r\nments other than carbon also added.\n  - Katana have never weighed 50 lbs!!!=\r\n I have just gone and got out a ca 1700 katana. It weighed 1 1/2 lbs (700 g=\r\nrams). It is about an average size. In a temple in Japan there is a katana =\r\n6 foot or more long. It might weight 5 lbs, but it is a votive offering to =\r\nthe Gods and not a serious combat sword.\n  - Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s sword?? No =\r\nidea...\n\n  Best regards,\n  Barry Thomas\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  =\r\nFrom: MNcoffey@... \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sen=\r\nt: Saturday, January 20, 2007 7:16 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Nihonto\n\n=\r\n  I have been doing research on real Japanese katana and have only ended \n =\r\n up confusing myself even more, so I thought I would ask everybody here \n  =\r\nmy two questions.
