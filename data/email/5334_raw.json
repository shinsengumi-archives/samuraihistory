In\n&gt; that sense it can be \n&gt; said that there were &#39;ranks&#39;.\n\nThere were &quot;JOBS&quot; that were more important. But they\nare still jobs. Not ranks. \n\n&gt; On top of that there were of course the ranks in\n&gt; terms of the \n&gt; Shoku-i ���� system.\n\ncivil ranks, not military. Completely different from\nthe issue being discussed.\n\n\n&gt; Ah - here&#39;s what I was getting at. But beyond this,\n&gt; of course an \n&gt; ashigaru is lower than a taisho. So at some level\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t you be \n&gt; able to call this a &#39;rank&#39;?\n\nNo. While the position is obviously higher than a\nfootsoldier, it&#39;s still not a RANK. It&#39;s a job. You\ndon&#39;t make &quot;Taisho 3rd Class&quot;.  \n\n&gt; Then of course to confuse matters more we have that\n&gt; Ashigaru \n&gt; Taisho.....\n\nWho leads a larger group of ashigaru than a\nashigaru-kashira, but is still performing a JOB. \n\n&gt; This specific example seems in my way of thinking to\n&gt; blur the lines a \n&gt; bit. It seems to me that once &#39;promoted&#39; to\n&gt; ashigaru-gashira a person \n&gt; would not go back to being a plain ashigaru. In\n&gt; other words this one \n&gt; seems more like a permanent promotion rather than\n&gt; just a \n&gt; battle-by-battle job assignment. What do you think?\n\nA company commander is higher than a platoon leader,\nand once you&#39;re a company commander you&#39;re not going\nto ever go back to being a platoon leader. However,\nthey&#39;re both still JOBS....descriptions of\nfunction...not RANKS. \n\nPut it this way: in the modern military, ranks\ngenerally coincide with certain job positions. A squad\nleader is usually a Staff Sergeant, a platoon sergeant\nusually a Sergeant First Class. A platoon leader is\nusually a lieutenant (normally 2nd LT), a company XO\nis a 1st LT, a company commander is a Captain, majors\nhold the main battalion staff positions, such as XO, a\nbattalion commander is a lieutanant colonel, a brigade\ncommander is a colonel, etc. Why is it this way?\nBecause the US Army says that those are the ranks that\ngo with those positions--someone with the experience\nand skill to get promoted to COL should be able to\nhandle the command of a Brigade, etc. HOWEVER, they\nare not equal. I&#39;m a captain, but have not had command\nyet--I&#39;m filling a staff position. I filled a staff\nposition at my last assignment also. So while my rank\nhas not changed, nor will it in the next few years, my\nPOSITION has, and will. I will take company command in\na year or so--but that doesn&#39;t change my RANK. See the\ndifference? \n\nThere WAS no rank system in a sengoku army. Don&#39;t\nconfuse ranks with &quot;ranking&quot;. Obviously some people\nwere more important than others, and some jobs were\nmore prestigious, etc. But you didn&#39;t start as\nAshigaru 2nd Class, work up to Ashigaru 1st Class,\nthen Gunsou, then 2nd Samurai, then 1st Samurai, etc. \n\nYou simply can&#39;t fit the square Sengoku army peg into\nthe round modern military hole. \n\nEven today, at work I take advantage of the difference\nbetween rank and job title. Our office liaisons with\nJapanese 3 and 4 star level officers (generals,\nadmirals, etc) regularly. I&#39;m a nobody as a simple\ncaptain. But I use my job title, not my rank--Deputy\nOperations Officer sounds much better to them then\nusing my rank, which is the lower than the guy who\ngets their coffee in the morning. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
