But were they just Iga ninja or a mixture of Iga and Koga ninja?\nAlso what was his duties as a retainer? Did he decide battle strategies or \ndid they know that he was a leader of ninja and used him because of that? \nand how did he die, I have come across many different stories but I&#39;m trying \nto find the truth if possible.\n\nThe Sanada family were also part of a ninja group around this period of time \nwith a mixture of ninja&#39;s from Iga, Koga and even other schools.\nI was told that they were known as, &quot;The 10 ninja brave&quot; but does anyone \nknow of any tasks they completed and any of their names and did Takeda \nShingen know of them and their use.\n\nThankyou for any information,\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n\n"
