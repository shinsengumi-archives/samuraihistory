I suggest this :\n- Do not make anything to the blade or the tang in order to discover\nbetter details or, worst, in order to let it sharper. Do not touch the\nblade, clean it with paper nose tissue, maintain it in the scabbard\ncutting edge up. \n- Search for easy and near To-ken fun club, give it personally (without\nleaving them alone in their hands) for a first, direct kantei if they\nagree to make it free. If they agree the blade is a traditional\nhand-made and is in recoverable conditions, ask for a qualified togishi\n(polisher).\n-Get in touch with the togishi, asking for polish prices, usually XY U$\nat inch (both sides included) of the sharp part of the blade. At the\nfinish of the work all the mystery of the blade will be unveiled.\nPersonally, I gave to polisher also a blade that is not at present day\nan investment. The price paid and the polish was superior to the market\nprice.\nBut is a personal thought. To give back a blade to their dignity is for\nme enough for the price paid...\n \n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: Scott Moore [mailto:sgmoore@...] \nInviato: domenica 11 maggio 2003 19.29\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\nMatt,\n\n  Thank you for your information and thoughts. My mother-in-law told me\nyesterday that her late husband was in New Guinea at the end of the war,\nbut\ntravelled to Japan before returning to the states. She doesn&#39;t remember\nif\nhe ever said where he obtained the swords.\n\nScott\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;M. R.

When the\n&gt; Japanese surrendered they stockpiled the weapons (firearms, blades,\netc)\n&gt; usually at harbors, airfields, or some other major location so that\nthe\n&gt; American forces could easily collect them.  In most cases the officers\nin\n&gt; charge of the local military units would allow the soldiers to pick\nthrough\n&gt; the piles and take what they wanted.  That is how my grandfather got\nhis\n&gt; rifle and sword.\n&gt;   Very rarely did a soldier kill an officer on the battlefield and\ntake\nhis\n&gt; sword then.  For two reasons.  One, killing an officer would require\ngetting\n&gt; close enough to have killed all the other soldiers around him.  Two,\nthey\n&gt; were in the middle of a war, they would not have had time to bend down\nand\n&gt; pick up a sword while avoiding flying bullets.\n&gt;   I hope that this helps you determine how the weapons were acquired.\nThe\n&gt; more posts I read about it the more I believe that you have a very\nnice\n&gt; find.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Peace,\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt Williams\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; STOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*\n&gt; http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
