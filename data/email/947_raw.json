It&#39;s a \n&gt; captivating work of historical fiction that allows\n&gt; Westerners a peek \n&gt; inside a foreign world and provides an opportunity\n&gt; to learn about the \n&gt; samurai, a group often portrayed onscreen but seldom\n&gt; understood. What \n&gt; I enjoyed most was the story&#39;s (rather overt)\n&gt; parallels to \n&gt; contemporary issues as it recounts America&#39;s first\n&gt; foray into \n&gt; Southeast Asian affairs. Allusions to World War II,\n&gt; America&#39;s \n&gt; involvement in Vietnam, and the influx of Japanese\n&gt; businesses into \n&gt; the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s are clearly\n&gt; evident in this draft.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had worried that these harbingers of things to\n&gt; come might become \n&gt; overbearing but they just lent further tragedy and\n&gt; poignancy to the \n&gt; story. The spectator knows what the characters&#39;\n&gt; actions will \n&gt; ultimately lead to and the horrible toll it will\n&gt; have on both Japan \n&gt; and the U.S.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Last Samurai is a rousing adventure yarn, an\n&gt; intriguing \n&gt; commentary on a key turning point in the history of\n&gt; Japan and its \n&gt; relationship with the United States, as well as an\n&gt; enlightening \n&gt; lesson on Japanese culture and the titular samurai.\n&gt; I simply can&#39;t \n&gt; wait to see this film.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Check out the entire article at the link at the top\n&gt; of the email.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
