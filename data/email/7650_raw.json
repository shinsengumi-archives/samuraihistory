But leave it at the \nbottom rather \n&gt; than cut-and-paste to put it on the top. Would that be acceptable? \nOr are you \n&gt; saying that the part being responded to MUST be on the top and the \nresponse \n&gt; MUST be on the bottom.\n&gt; \n\nBy the way, I use outlook sometimes - all you have to do is \nhit &quot;reply&quot;, then when you get to the email you can respond to, just \n*SIMPLY* scroll to the bottom, and start typing. (of course first \ndelete the extra stuff you don&#39;t need.  Just because the cursor \ndefaults to the top of the screen doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t just scroll \nto the bottom of all the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; marked lines, and start typing there. \nMicrosoft may be hated by the tech-savvy, but it is EASY to use.  \nThere is NO NEED for any cutting and pasting.  Again, top post or \nbottom post, but just please everyone, let&#39;s leave the relevant info \nfrom the prior post, and delete the irrelevant.\n\nThanks!  :D\n\n\n\n"
