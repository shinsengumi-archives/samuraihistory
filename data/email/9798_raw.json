I  said  TO BE CONTINUED.\n\n   Since then, Buke power became  st=\r\nronger  and stronger as time\nwent by.  And  the chief of many of the Buke g=\r\nroupes came out.  That\nis Heike.  Kanmu Emperor had so many wives and so ma=\r\nny children as a\nresult of it, and finaly  he couln&#39;t feed whole of his big=\r\n family ,\nso he decided to seperate his fourth son, named price Kajiwara as=\r\n\nHEISI and sentenced  him to become  the chief of Buke group to gard\nEmpero=\r\nr family  and his desendants inherited  HEISI name .  One of\nthe groupes of=\r\n HEISI was ISE HEISI followed by Taira no Kiyomori who\nwas the first chief =\r\nof BUKE  having the power a little bit stronger\nthan Emperor and control th=\r\ne political administrative business\nsupervising Emperor.\n   However, the em=\r\nperor at that time, aiming to get back power over\nHEISI  and utilize  Genji=\r\n group to upset HEISI.\n   Genji was another chief of BUKE groupes .  Empero=\r\nr SEIWA got so\nmany wives and so many children  like Emperor Kanmu before a=\r\nnd\nnominated number sixth prine , named SADASUMI as to become the Chief\nof =\r\nBUKE  as  GENJI  group.  the desendants of SADASUMI  inherited\nGenji group =\r\nand did the job of gardman for Enmperor.\n   Yoritomo defeatd HEISI and beca=\r\nme  the first chief of Genji who\nfounded  and was nominated the SHOGUN  and=\r\n formed government to\ncontrol The political administrative business.\n   Sin=\r\nce then,  the chief of BUKE  controled the political\nadministrative busines=\r\ns , pushed Emperor far a way aside untill the\nend of TOKUGAWA  era.\n\n   The=\r\n Emperor who used to control policy with the strongest power\nin Japan  have=\r\n to stay in small place in somewhere in KYOTO without\nno political power , =\r\nbut just religious related power for a long\ntime.\n\n    Now at this point , =\r\n here comes very famous question.\n    Why  Emperor  of Japan  was not destr=\r\noyed .  Why many chieves of\nBUKE  such as  NOBUNAGA,   ASHIKAGA,  TOKUGAWA =\r\n didn&#39;t wipe out\nEmperor ?    Only Japanese Emperor has been continuing to =\r\nexist in\nthis world since the begining , inheriting only one same blood.\n  =\r\nThe present Emperor (  HEISEI  Emperor ) is the number  125th.\n\n   Looking =\r\nforward to  hearing your any comments about above\nquestion.\n\n   Eddie  Hira=\r\nmoto\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
