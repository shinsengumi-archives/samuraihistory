What is\nequally obvious is that he didn&#39;t do nearly as much\nresearch about Japan itself, especially the background\nof what was going on in the country during the time\nAdams, et al were there. Several places he obviously\ntakes what was written in the letters by Europeans as\nthe facts about Japanese politics of the time, when\nreally they were not accurate at all--kind of like me\ntrying to describe the politics of South Korea, in\nwhich I live, but don&#39;t speak the language, etc. \n\nObservation #2: MUST he refer to things as if he&#39;s a\n16th century European himself? I thought I was going\nto puke if I read &quot;scimitar&quot; describing a katana one\nmore time. &quot;Scimitar&quot;? We couldn&#39;t just say &quot;sword&quot;?\nIt didn&#39;t have enough &quot;period&quot; flavor, I suppose. And\nhow hard would it have been to use the JAPANESE names\n(since, in actuality, they were their names) for\nJapanese historical figures, and not the stupid &quot;King\nFoyne&quot;, &quot;Matinga&quot;, etc.? Beyond the fact that I have\nno idea how phonetically challenged the English must\nhave been at this time for them to come up with those,\nit just HURT reading that. Like when people pronounce\nmy favorite restaurant in Sierra Vista, AZ, which is\nTanuki, as &quot;Ta NOOOO ki&quot;. AARRGH.\n\nOkay, enough of that--overall I thought it was very\ninformative, and fairly well done except for my petty\ngripes above. Worth reading as long as one understands\nnot to take what Milton writes as a history of Japan\nduring that time, but a history of the Europeans in\nJapan, told COMPLETELY through their eyes. \n\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo!
