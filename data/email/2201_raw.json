Amongst other sources, English, Japanese, French and German, I have looked at three contemporary versions of the Nagashino screens - and modern japanese representations - translating the Kanji annotations.\nCan any of you, &quot;my learned collegues&quot;, provide any information or source idetifying this person?\n\n                Rod Johnson\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
