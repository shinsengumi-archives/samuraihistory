Towards the end of the Heian Period, two military clans, the Minamoto and Taira, had grown so powerful that they seized control over the country and fought wars for supremacy against each other. \nKamakura Period (1192-1333) \nIn 1185, the Minamoto defeated the Taira, and Minamoto Yoritomo established a new military government in Kamakura in 1192. As shogun, the highest military officer, he became the ruler of Japan. \nMuromachi Period (1333 - 1573) \nDuring the chaotic Era of Warring States (sengoku jidai, 1467-1573), Japan consisted of dozens of independent states which were constantly fighting each other. Consequently, the demand for samurai was very high. Between the wars, many samurai were working on farms. Many of the famous samurai movies by Kurosawa take place during this era. \nAzuchi-Momoyama Period (1573 - 1603) \nWhen Toyotomi Hideyoshi reunited Japan, he started to introduce a rigid social caste system which was later completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors. Hideyoshi forced all samurai to decide between a life on the farm and a warrior life in castle towns. Furthermore, he forbade anyone but the samurai to arm themselves with a sword. \nEdo Period (1603 - 1868) \nAccording to the Edo Period&#39;s official hierarchy of social castes, the samurai stood at the top, followed by the farmers, artisans and merchants. Furthermore, there were hierarchies within each caste. All samurai were forced to live in castle towns and received income from their lords in form of rice. Masterless samurai were called ronin and caused minor troubles during the early Edo Period. \nWith the fall of Osaka Castle in 1615, the Tokugawa&#39;s last potential rival was eliminated, and relative peace prevailed in Japan for about 250 years. As a result, the importance of martial skills declined, and most samurai became bureaucrats, teachers or artists.\n\nP.S.: this is from japan-guide.com, a site which I have just discovered.\n\nThank you\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGabriel\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Take Yahoo!
