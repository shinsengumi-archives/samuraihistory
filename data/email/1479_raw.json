Out there in SAMURAI WORLD? In Korea another dumb war, our unit \nor at least some of us in a B.J.U.were trained and worked with two \nSamurai in mind control and mental img. as we got to know each other \nwe learned these men for the last few 100years came from people who \nwere brought up from birth to do a job like most of us, they loved  \neach other and ladys also could control there minds to sit in winter \ncold water in nothing on but undergarments for an hour or more. They \nwere probably good fighting men in the close arts of killing. but \nthey were men like all of us no more no less do not make somthing out \nof them they were not? Kind of tunnel vis. like a monk with out being \nlimited to a monk&#39;s life style.\n 2003 WOW! the guy that lives with out a car prob. lives inner city i \nhave lot&#39;s on N.Y. friend&#39;s who have not had a car for 30 years do \nyou think a Samurai would not ride a horse because it poops on the \nroad? Or not get in a Jeep to go some were, or use some of our winter \ngear when cold? You sound like the people that went back to mother \nearth in the late 50 & 60 to live with out elec, grow, and kill there \nown food i was there what a joke that was.Most lasted about 2to3 \nweeks and a few 4to6months and back to MOM & DAD and $$$$.I work out \nwith some people that you might call 2003 Samurai they make a liveing \nas body guards and teaching murk&#39;s. but when the go home they have a \ncomp, car, lights, and mybe a Big Mack WOW! You should do what my son \ndid when he was young, GO to CHINA and live at a monestery for a year \nto learn healing with herbal healing and understaning life. OR for \nthe real SAMURAI out there go around the world as a pit fighter as \nsome of my friends have. [Live the good life with honor and careing  \nand be true to your self we are not and can never be Samurai!  \nRemember reading is not doing it&#39;s the problem in the U.S. to much \nreading and liveing in ones mind, life is short go out and enjoy it.I \nlived in Hong K.for 2 years in the 50&#39;s never saw any of the \nHollywood stuff that&#39;s out there.and very few have.In 50 Hong K. was \nchina today it&#39;s a shopping mall how sad.      Cheers Joseph\n\n\n"
