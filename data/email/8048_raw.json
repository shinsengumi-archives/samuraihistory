Eac=\r\nh school of swordsmiths shaped\ntheir nakago in different and individual way=\r\ns. Also the file marks\n(yasurime) are often an indication of school, swords=\r\nmith and age. Of course,\nany inscription is important as well as the natura=\r\nl patination of the nakago\nwhich can indicate the age as well as wether the=\r\n nakago has been interfered\nwith. All these things may be damaged by cleani=\r\nng.\n\nFurther, although a polished blade should never be touched with the ba=\r\nre\nskin, for reasons that have already been given, it is quite acceptable t=\r\no\nhold the nakago in the naked hand. In this case the natural oils and swea=\r\nt\nin the skin will actually (over many years) aid the patination.\nFor your =\r\nown peace of mind, I cannot believe you will have done any damage\nin the sh=\r\nort time you seem to have had your sword.\n\nAs for your other question, I am=\r\n afraid I cannot comment on Paul Chen swords\nwhich I do not really class as=\r\n Japanese swords. However, I can say that\nswords made in the immediate pre =\r\nMeiji period, the Bakamatsu period, and\nwhich we call shinshinto (new new s=\r\nwords) were made to be used and that some\nvery fine blades were made by suc=\r\nh swordsmiths as Masahide, Kiyomaro,\nNaotane and Munetsugu. These swords we=\r\nre often of sturdy proportions and\nattempts to opy the styles of  blades of=\r\n the Kamakura and Yoshino\n(Nambokucho) periods.\nThey had true hamon having =\r\ngone through the quenching process and I am\nunsure even if swords from Chin=\r\na are hand made and water quenched or, in\nother words, made in the traditio=\r\nnal manner. Today, there are some 350\nlicensed swordsmiths making swords in=\r\n Japan and they are quite strictly\ncontrolled but all use traditional metho=\r\nds in order to keep the craft alive.\n\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;mark kd&quot; &lt;depos42300@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 25, 2005 5:48 PM\nSubject: Re: [sam=\r\nuraihistory] cleaning a new katana HELP PLEASE!!!!\n\n\nhi federico,\n     so..=\r\n...i should never clean the tang again? will it effect the rest of\nthe blad=\r\ne? b/c i already tried to clean it will it now ruin the blade?\n            =\r\n                           Thanks,\n                                        =\r\n Mark\n\nfederico trejos &lt;federicotrejos@...&gt; wrote:\n  Good morning.\n\nO=\r\nk.
