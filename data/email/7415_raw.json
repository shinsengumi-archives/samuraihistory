While the Osprey book is not nearly \nas good as the earlier Firebird book, remember that Turnbull is doing a \ncomplete overview of the Ninja, both the historical and fictional \nversions. It examines the myths, fallacies, misconceptions, and the \nrole of the ninja in popular culture (hence the &#39;comic book principles) \nas well as historical accounts. If someone is looking for a \nstraightforward historical study, then the book is probably not for \nthem.  \nHowever, if someone is looking for a straightforward historical study \nof ninja, good luck. Most of what could be put in it could just as \neasily be covered by a book dealing with samurai.\n\n\n\n\n"
