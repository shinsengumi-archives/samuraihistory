Go to Nikko as well but keep in mind that is where his \nsons moved him so that he could be more easily venerated just a short \nride from Edo. The Sunpu Toshogu has a must see museum that houses many \nof the treasures of the Tokugawa house. It is expensive but I recommend \nthe catalog of the Toshogu&#39;s Armour collection.\n      You can visit the remains of Sunpu castle where I believe you can now \nsee a scale mock up of the castle and town in Ieyasu&#39;s time in an \noutdoor park within the old castle walls. Also you&#39;ll find the \nretirement mansion of Tokugawa Keiki, The last Shogun, who chose to \nspend his last year&#39;s communing with the spirit of his great \nancestor...\n-t\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
