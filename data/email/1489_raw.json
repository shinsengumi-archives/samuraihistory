Would that be the true reality of \nliving a militaristic style of life based upon the\nsubjugation of the rest of society, Confucian ideals\n(hardly the core of liberal ideas and understanding),\nwarfare, and exploitation. So why do we study them?\nSur they&#39;re are truly remarkable in their feats and\neffects, but so were the Nazis, Communists, the\nMongols. Does anyone out there fancy being a\ngauleiter? a nomadic horseman? a KGB official? But of\ncourse they don&#39;t have the appeal od Japan and the\nJapanese. Sure, we are all part of the academic\nChrysanthenum club, but academia is where it stays in\nregard to the samurai. \n\n --- TIMOTHY HEATON &lt;jahladracul@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\n\n--- &quot;Anthony J.
