The fir=\r\nst pair of glasses was said to have \n&gt;    been \n&gt;    given to Ieyasu at the=\r\n turn of the 16th c.=A0 In 1636 spectacles \n&gt;    accounted \n&gt;    for one pe=\r\nrcent of Dutch-Japanese trade: 19,425 pairs. They may not \n&gt;    have been v=\r\nery comfortable to wear. An encyclopaedia in 1732 \n&gt;    describes them: &quot;gl=\r\nasses are about 3mm thick and look like the \n&gt;    slices \n&gt;    of giant rad=\r\nish.&quot; Mainly it seems these were heavy ones put on by \n&gt;    seal \n&gt;    carv=\r\ners, inlayers etc to look closely at things. In former times \n&gt;    they \n&gt; =\r\n   came from China. Light glass lensed sort came from Europe.=A0 This \n&gt;   =\r\n book has various illustrations of=A0 people wearing glasses.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Profes=\r\nsor Screech is in London, at the School of Oriental and \n&gt;    African \n&gt;   =\r\n studies, and everything I&#39;ve ever written by him is marvellous, \n&gt;    full=\r\n of \n&gt;    insights. If you are in England you might be able to find out mor=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Hope this is of some help.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Gillian&gt; \nDean Wayland\nHead Of =\r\nThe Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
