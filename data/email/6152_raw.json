You did make an effort.\n\nSigh.\n\nI came home from work extra tired and cranky.  I spent the day taking care of a couple of newborn infants whose stupid drug-infested \nmothers do stupid things to them.  Like one of them putting methadone in her infant&#39;s formula to shut him up.....  and it almost \nworked permanently.  Mom tried to pin it on her 7 year old.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t justify my being rude, though. I should have taken my nap before I checked my email.\n\nI&#39;m sorry for taking a potshot at you in my frustration, Mr. Wilson.  I will try to play nice again.\n\nBad puddy-tat,\n\nLizzie\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Nate Ledbetter\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Tuesday, December 07, 2004 6:31 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Ronin\n\n\n\n--- Elizabeth Chase &lt;lizzirrd@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  Develop some\n&gt; independent thinking skills, as well as your grammar\n&gt; and spelling.\n\nNow, now, let&#39;s all be nice.
