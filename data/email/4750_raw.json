Granted, these were\nemotional childish outbursts laced with the &quot;f&quot; word,\nbut the underlying issue is that we weren&#39;t kind\nenough to answer what a &quot;daimyo&quot; is for the young man.\n\n\nYes, I understand that if you do a google search you\nshould find an answer in about .03 nanoseconds. Yes, I\nalso understand that we are not a crutch for people\nwho don&#39;t want to do research. That being said, here&#39;s\na short answer that hopefully will suffice:\n\nDaimo: &quot;Great Name&quot; a feudal lord of the samurai class\nin pre-Meiji Japan. Daimyo were generally considered\nthe pre-eminent ruler in their fief, and controlled\neverything that happened therein. Prior to the\nTokugawa Shogunate, the Daimyo were essentially\n&quot;warlords&quot; controlling territory by force of arms,\nenlarging it as they could. Subsequently, they held\ntheir fiefs either by being granted them by the\nShogunate, or with the Shogunate&#39;s permission,\nanyways. Daimyo had an army of samurai retainers,\ngenerally speaking, to maintain order in their domains\nand to fight wars when necessary. Once the Tokugawa\nperiod began, there was a minimum income to be\nconsidered a &quot;daimyo&quot;--I don&#39;t know off hand what it\nwas, but I&#39;m sure you can look it up somewhere.\n\nThere&#39;s a basic answer. \n\n\n            \n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
