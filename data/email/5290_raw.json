I then tried pasting Jay&#39;s email with\n&gt; its sample text in to\n&gt; Outlook Express just in case it was an issue with\n&gt; Turnpike, again no\n&gt; joy, however...\n\nThat&#39;s odd. Turnpike is your email program? I&#39;m not\nfamiliar with it. This works with yahoo, hotmail,\nOutlook...and everything else I&#39;ve ever used. \n \n&gt; I noticed that when Turnpike displayed Jay&#39;s\n&gt; message, it offered me the\n&gt; option of selecting a different mode of &quot;Viewer&quot;.\n&gt; The default option was\n&gt; Internet Exploder, so off I went, and hey presto, a\n&gt; little line of\n&gt; hiragana. I assume Jay that&#39;s what you actually sent\n&gt; me?\n\nOkay, sounds like it worked. I don&#39;t remember what Jay\nsent, though.\n\nI then had to undo it as some very\n&gt; strange things happened\n&gt; to all my other programs. For example on the address\n&gt; bar of &quot;My\n&gt; Documents&quot;, the back slashes were replaced with the\n&gt; symbol for yen! Of\n&gt; course this could be perfectly normal, but being a\n&gt; bit twitchy where\n&gt; computing is concerned, I went in to reverse gear.\n\nNo, this is what you want. When that happens, just\nchange the encoding back to &quot;western european&quot; and it\nwill switch back. As to why no little sidebar menu\npopped up, it may depend on &quot;where&quot; you are clicking.\nDon&#39;t click on text you are typing--and make sure it&#39;s\na RIGHT click--I may have said left click, not\nthinking. Now that I actually look at the mouse, it&#39;s\na right click. \n\n&gt; Anyway, everything is now back to what passes for\n&gt; normal around here,\n&gt; and with a stroke of a key I can read kana. Jay or\n&gt; Nate, could you send\n&gt; me some kanji so I can confirm that the system can\n&gt; in fact cope.\n\nI&#39;ll try when I get home--much to my chagrin, I can\nread but can&#39;t type fonts yet on my work computer\nhere, and last night my home connection went down, so\nwe&#39;ll see. I should get the disk for the fonts (I&#39;m on\na Win 2000 comp--cheap govt--and can&#39;t download it)\nnext week. \n\n&gt; H&#39;mm, now what about writing in Japanese..?\n&gt; Arghhh....:-)\n\nGo back to the control panel; go to regional options,\nand then Input Locales. Click &quot;Change&quot;, then it will\ntake you to Text Services. Click &quot;Add&quot; and highlight\nJapanese, then it should come up with a language bar\nyou can switch back and forth. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
