Some armour\n&gt; study, all of which means one must study history. If you are interested in\n&gt; swords I can recommend both groups below. The first if like the name says\n&gt; for Yahoos! lots of good natured joking and fun, several knowledgeable\n&gt; people and often some otherwise hard to find info.\n&gt;     The second is focused on art swords and while not snobbish is a bit more\n&gt; serious about it. The list master is an avowed expert on modern blades so\n&gt; this is often a subject there. I invite anyone who is interested to drop in\n&gt; or is that on?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; To manage your options for this group:\n&gt; \n&gt; Post message: nihonto@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subscribe:  nihonto-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Unsubscribe:  nihonto-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Nihonto group website: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nihonto\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember: Honor is your most important attribute!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To subscribe or unsubscribe, to the token_kenkyu_kai discussion list,\n&gt; send the following 1-line message to:\n&gt; &lt;listproc@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; SUBSCRIBE TOKEN_KENKYU_KAI\n&gt; or\n&gt; UNSUBSCRIBE TOKEN_KENKYU_KAI\n&gt; \n&gt; To submit a message to the list, send to:\n&gt; &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;\n&gt; ******\n\n\n\n"
