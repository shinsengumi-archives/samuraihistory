I don&#39;t\nknow Helly--and I&#39;ve seen too many ninja fanatics here\nto accept his say-so that this is legit. Forgive me,\nbut with a connection to Hayes it&#39;s guilty until\nproven innocent. I didn&#39;t reply to you in the same\nmanner, as you&#39;ve been around on the board, post\nintelligently, and don&#39;t strike me as the &quot;wannabe&quot;\nninja type. If you&#39;re endorsing this, then fine--I&#39;ll\nfully admit there is a chance it&#39;s not crap, but\nagain, any connection with Hayes makes it doubtful, at\nleast until I see it. Too many documentaries simply\ntry to capitalize on the hype (exhibit a-n: any\ndocumentary made during the &quot;Last Samurai&quot; hype)\nwithout doing any real research. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\nYahoo!
