Tell you the truth, I have met a sword or two that =\r\nfelt a little bloodthirsty; they make me nervous.  But the only real reason=\r\n I&#39;m answering this note is that I think it gives a good portrait of how si=\r\nlly the idea can get.  Please note that I never claimed that swords speak i=\r\nn human language - or indeed, that they literally speak at all.  But - for =\r\ninstance - just as a cat can communicate without speech, or a glance betwee=\r\nn humans can communicate volumes, just so (I still maintain) a sword can le=\r\nt you know a thing or two.  I&#39;m not suggesting that it comes through in cle=\r\nar sentences, or even Gollumical (Gollumatic?) ones.\nI must admit that I di=\r\ndn&#39;t expect this tone of response from this group.  Are there any aspects o=\r\nf traditional bushi values that _are_ regarded as deserving of respect arou=\r\nnd here?\nGereg\n\n   Date: Mon, 13 Dec 2004 20:17:53 -0600\n   From: Anthony B=\r\nryant &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: swords (was ...Eras)\n\nNate =\r\nLedbetter wrote:\n\n\n&gt; If you want to argue that a sword has &quot;spirit&quot; as any\n=\r\n&gt; piece of art would, I&#39;ll buy it.
