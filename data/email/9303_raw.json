The head of this regime was the Shogun, the suprem=\r\ne ruler. Under him where his regional =91daimyo=92 or =91dukes=92. Under ea=\r\nch =91daimyo=92 served the Japanese samurai. When a samurai stepped out of =\r\nline, became too unruly or displeased his =91daimyo=92, the samurai would o=\r\nften have to go through a procedure known as yubizume. This procedure is a =\r\nvery barbaric punishment in which the first joint of the little finger on t=\r\nhe sword hand would be amputated.\n  \n  Not only would this be a very painfu=\r\nl punishment, but it served a much cleverer purpose. When holding a samurai=\r\n sword the finger which has the strongest grip is the little finger. Each f=\r\ninger right up to the index has a weaker gripping strength. You can test th=\r\nis yourself. Make a tight fist with what would of been your sword hand, and=\r\n take a slim object of equal circumference throughout such as a pencil or p=\r\nen. Now, without causing you harm, take the non-sharp/drawing end and start=\r\ning with the index finger end of the hand, while retaining a fist, slowly w=\r\nork the pencil/pen into the grip.\n  You will see the further into the grip =\r\nthe pencil goes, the more resistance there is. You now can see how importan=\r\nt the little finger and ring finger would be for gripping samurai swords. T=\r\no make matters worse, if the samurai further disgraced himself he would be =\r\nrequired to take the next joint of his little finger off, and this could ev=\r\nen extend onto the other fingers. But what was the use in handicapping the =\r\nsamurai in such a way? Well, not only did it serve as a constant and shamef=\r\nul reminder, but made the samurai more vulnerable than he had been before, =\r\ntherefore more reliant upon his immediate superior, his =91daimyo=92 for pr=\r\notection.\n  This brutal practice of yubizume is still used today by the Yak=\r\nuza / Japanese organised crime families as a means of punishing their unrul=\r\ny members.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n8:00? 8:25? 8:40?
