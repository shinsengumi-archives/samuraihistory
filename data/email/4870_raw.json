You might like to do a search on him and have a \nlook at his forum.\n\nMy own experience in Japan (purely anectdotal, I&#39;m afraid) is that most \nof my friends my age find foreigners&#39; interest in &quot;samurai&quot; (mine \nincluded) rather strange. For a start, they never call them &quot;samurai&quot;, \nalways &quot;bushi&quot;. But the same people (mostly women) love kabuki drama \nand watch taiga (the NHK many episode period drama). The young \nactors I was working with last year (in their 20s) thought bushi heroes \nvery cool, and were especially keen on the shinsengumi - the plays for \nchildren in this theatre company&#39;s repertoire often include samurai \nstories in all sorts of forms, Boys&#39; festival keeps alive the interest in \nswords, helmets etc, thousands of manga and anime have historical \nthemes, which can be comic, heroic, ghostly, whatever. So perhaps the \nreal, ongoing cultural history of the country should be seen separately \nfrom the admiration of bushido which is more common among \nforeigners than among Japanese where, I suspect, it is seen as verging \ntowards fascism. (This was definitely the view of the occupying forces \nafter the war when samurai drama and films were banned.)\n\nMy own interest came from Kurosawa movies!\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
