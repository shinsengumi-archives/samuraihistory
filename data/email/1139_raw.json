If there were more then one retired emporer which was\nfrequent they were distinguished by the ranks Ichi-in, Hon-in, Chu-in,\nShin-in.  The books in Japanese that I have refer to Gotoba as Jo-ko from\nhis retirement at the age of 19 in 1198 until the period of the Shokyu no\nran which would indicate that he didn&#39;t become a monk. If he had he would\nhave been refered to as Ho-o, but then again there were many titles bandied\nabout in those days. The idea of the emporer as divine is a little sketchy,\nwhile many people in Japanese revered the throne as divine they quite often\ntreated the occupant like trash. As for the term Ji-Kyu I can&#39;t seem to find\nthis in my resources. I hope this helps.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: thorpe75 &lt;oldcars4u@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, August 30, 2002 8:56 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] (unknown)\n\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I read that Emperor Gotoba became a priest/monk when he turned 23\n&gt; years old.  I also understand that the Emperor was seen as a &quot;divine\n&gt; man.&quot;\n&gt; The name or title of Ji-Kyu seems to apply to priests in Gotoba&#39;s day\n&gt; and even today.\n&gt; Is it possible that Emperor Gotoba could have gone by the title of\n&gt; Ji-Kyu Ichi?  (Meaning &quot;Number one Priest&quot;?)\n&gt;  Thank you for your help, Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
