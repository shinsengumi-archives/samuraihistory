The \n&gt; exhibition is on until 27th February 2005.\n&gt; &quot;The exhibition features about 100 blades and mountings which were \n&gt; polished and otherwise conserved in Japan during 1998, with guidance \n&gt; from the government of Japan and the Society for the Preservation of \n&gt; Japanese Art Swords (the NBTHK) in Tokyo.&quot;\n&gt; To find out more about the exhibition, visit \n&gt; www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/japaneseswords\n&gt; The cattalogue still proves to be elusive. I have heard it will be \n&gt; available about 2nd week in October. I sincerley recommend a visit if \n&gt; you are in London over the next few months.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Clive Sinclaire\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
