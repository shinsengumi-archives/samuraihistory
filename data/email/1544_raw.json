L. Sadler and one\n&gt; by someone who&#39;s name I can&#39;t think of off the top of my head (conrad\n&gt; totman??).  At least one on Hideyoshi, by Mary Berry (it also has a\n&gt; lot of info on Nobunaga - this is one of my favorite books), and only\n&gt; one on Nobunaga that I know of by Jeroen Lamers, which I haven&#39;t read\n&gt; (and probably won&#39;t until the price drops way below its current $60\n&gt; mark).\n&gt;\n&gt; You should be able to find any of them on Amazon.com.  Then there is\n&gt; the sort of outdated overview of the 16th century by Sansom, but it\n&gt; is well written and an interesting read.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi there.\n&gt; &gt;   Are there any biographies of Nobunaga, Toyotomi, Tokugawa or\n&gt; Takeda in\n&gt; &gt; English?
