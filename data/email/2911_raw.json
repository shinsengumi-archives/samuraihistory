The fact that he fought on the losing side\nand survived should at least speak of his ability to\nsurvive.  Beyond that, I&#39;ve read that he participated\nin a few of Ieyasu&#39;s &quot;closing&quot; battles so to speak.  I\nbeleive Sekigahara was the battle to decide the rule\nof the country, of course, but there&#39;s always a bit of\ncleaning up to do after such battles.  Rebel factions,\nthe decimation of the Toyotomi family line, etc.\n\nThis is nevermind the fact that being a great\nswordsman and a great warrior do not always go hand in\nhand.  To duel with a single or even multiple\nopponents is something very differt from soldiering. \nIn personal duels you have many more options and more\noppertunities to make precision cuts than in a large\nscale battle (reference: 45 year old opponent who\nkicked a rock in my face before rushing me with a\nkama-gusari!  You&#39;d be hard pressed to do that in\nbattle!).\n\n--- murphymurphyjohn@... wrote:\n&gt; Musashi has perhaps a greater reputation as a\n&gt; swordsman than deserved.  As \n&gt; you know, he was the most famous warrior of  &quot;The\n&gt; Age of the Country at Peace,&quot;  \n&gt; the Tokugawa Era, when the age of the great samurai\n&gt; battles like Nagashino,  \n&gt; Sekigahara,  and Tenno-ji,  outside Osaka Castle in\n&gt; 1615, were past.  In many \n&gt; respects,  he seems a Japanese version of Cervantes&#39;\n&gt;  Don Quijote.
