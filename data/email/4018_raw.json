Duty is however you \npersonally feel u will do what is expected and demanded of you in a \ntime of need.Loyalty to have a cause thatt your loyal to that is true \nhonour. To many people think samurai are super human honourable \ndashing chracters and that just doesnt exist. akira kurosawas films \naimed at showing this. True honour comes from within the fight for \nwhat you feel is right not some rich war lord that sends you to war \nto inrich his estates. Anyway im in kyoto in two months ne one got ne \ngood sites to see \n\n\n\n"
