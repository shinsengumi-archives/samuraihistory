Or just a villain in general.  \n\nNagashino was a t=\r\nactical brilliance that revolutionized warfare, but a\n*lot* of folks didnt =\r\nthink it was to honorable.  Plus he was a little\ntaken with being eccentric=\r\n and anything foreign.  Many saw him as the\ndownfall of society if he had r=\r\nuled Japan.  \n\nMadman, Genius, same thing :)  \n-Jason\n\n\n--- In samuraihisto=\r\nry@yahoogroups.com, &quot;keiman0&quot; &lt;KeimanZero@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have just finis=\r\nhed reading all about the great Oda Nobunaga of the \n&gt; Toshogowa Clan (hope=\r\n I spelt that correctly) and then I was watching \n&gt; Samurai Deeper Kyo the =\r\nother evening and wowie- The noble Nobunaga has \n&gt; been cast as the main vi=\r\nllain of the piece (Spoilers)\n&gt; \n&gt; He is supposedly a demon king who came t=\r\no earth four years ago at the \n&gt; Battle of Sekigahara (which I now know was=\r\n in 1600) and is seeking his \n&gt; body as is Kyo or Demon Eyes Kyo as they ca=\r\nll him. Why? So he can be \n&gt; resurrected as a terrible monster and take ove=\r\nr Earth. \n&gt; \n&gt; I was saddened to see such a noble hero thus portrayed. More=\r\n later \n&gt; perhaps. Have a glorious day. Toodles-K&K\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
