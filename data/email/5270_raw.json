What operating system are you using? That\n&gt; is, Windows 2000, \n&gt; &gt;    Windows \n&gt; &gt;    98, Windows XP, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Windows XP Pro\n&gt; \n\nOkay, if you&#39;ve got Windows XP, try this: \n\nWhen viewing the email with Japanese in it, left click\n\nand go to &quot;Encoding&quot; on the menu that pops up. Click\non it, and see if anything that says Japanese is on\nthere...&quot;Japanese(AutoSelect)&quot;, &quot;Japanese(ShiftJIS)&quot;,\nor &quot;Japanese(EUC)&quot;. These are all encoding systems\nthat read the characters on your screen. Switching to\nthem generally does not affect most English text. Half\nthe time I forget which encoding I&#39;m in. \n\nIf they aren&#39;t there, click &quot;more&quot;. See if they are\nthere. If they are, click one--preferably Japanese\n(AutoSelect). \n\nIf they aren&#39;t on the &quot;more&quot; window, then you&#39;ll have\nto go to your control panel. \n\nAs I&#39;m currently on a Win 2000 machine at work, I\ncan&#39;t help further for now--when I get home to my XP\nmachine, I&#39;ll hunt down what exactly you are supposed\nto do there. But if you&#39;re running XP, it&#39;s already on\nyour machine to READ Japanese--you may or may not have\nto load something to get to write Japanese, but you\nshould be able to download that--alternately, it&#39;s on\nyour windows startup disk. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. just as I was attempting to post the above, my\n&gt; package through this\n&gt; message up:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The message you are posting contains characters\n&gt; which are not included\n&gt; in the MIME character set being used (ISO 8859-1)&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Curiously when I tried to look this up via the Help\n&gt; function, there was\n&gt; no entry:-( And so no immediately obvious (well to\n&gt; me at least) way of\n&gt; changing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
