Is this what you are referring to ???  If so,\nin Japanese it is called an O&#39;juzu which literally means a string of beads.\nThere is also a half  O&#39;juzu that is more common in Japanese Buddhist\nChurches, and usually has 27 beads, but there is no real set number of beads\nfor this O&#39;juzu.  The use of the O&#39;juzu when in Gas&#39;sho (placing our hands\ntogether in prayer) is a symbol of our bond with Amida Buddha.  An outward\nand visible symbol of an inward and spiritual bond with Buddha .  I hope\nthis is of some help for you in your journey ???   Peace and love ...\ntsukiyo :)\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;onibawanshuu&quot; &lt;onibawanshuu@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, December 05, 2003 13:26\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Sacred symbol in Buddhism\n\n\nHello,\n\nPlease received my greetings.\n\nIï¿½m looking for the name and info of a sacred symbol of Buddhism.
