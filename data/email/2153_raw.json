He just perfected it and used\nit to best effect at Nagashino. I&#39;m convinced that the\nREAL innovation at Nagashino was not so much the\nvolley fire but the conjuction of missile weapons and\nnatural and man-made obstacles. He integrated fires\nand obstacles as well as any modern commander would. \n\nAs to your history prof, I agree with the last\npost--sounds to me like someone was trying to play\ndown the importance of Japanese innovation. His\nreasoning makes NO military tactical sense whatsoever.\nShoot, even with a tank platoon today you have\nsimiliar thinking in the way you&#39;d divide the\nbattlefield between sections and individual\ntanks--similiar concepts, so that not everyone is\nshooting at the same target and there is a constant\nrate of fire. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
