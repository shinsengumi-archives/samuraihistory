The term \nitself comes from a man named Nakayama Hakudo who was one of the greatest \nswordsmen of the early 20th century.  Prior to that, schools of \nswordsmanship were loosely called Kenjutsu (sword technique) schools.  Not \nto be confused with Kendo, the &quot;fencing&quot; style identified by the armor and \nthe bamboo shinai (fencing sword).\n  And Iaito is the training blade used by Iaidoka (practicioners of Iaido).  \nIt is, in these modern times, made out of a zinc/aluminum composite and does \nnot have a sharp edge.  These swords are made to equal the weight of an \nactual combat blade but without the danger of losing a body part to a \nmistake.\n  A katana is the easily identifiable Japanese sword with the single edge \nand the gentle curve.\n  As for the double edged sakabatou...I know not of such a thing.  Though I \nhave, in my studies, seen a description of one katana with a short cutting \nedge on the back of the kissaki (last few inches of the blade).\n  The similarities and differences between the Iaido/Kenjutsu schools could \nfill many, many books.  My knowledge only goes as far as Muso Shinden Ryu \n(which I have trained in) and what few other styles I have witnessed.\n  I hope this was helpful in some way.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nKeep up with high-tech trends here at &quot;Hook&#39;d on Technology.&quot; \nhttp://special.msn.com/msnbc/hookedontech.armx\n\n\n\n"
