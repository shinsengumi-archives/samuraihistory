More \nimportantly though is the hairstyle. The Nihon Rekishi Zuroku shows \nsome 60 hairstyles for men and over 100 for women. Each is for a \nparticular caste or occupation. Edo residents would instantly \nrecognize a persons status and even occupation by their hairstyle. \nFor them it would be easy to see and remember even in the dark.\n\tBy covering your hair you could enter and a house and even if \nseen slip back into the crowd just by uncovering your head!\n\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
