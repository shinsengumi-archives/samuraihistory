Heh,=\r\n heh, heh.&quot;\n----------\n\nI have a few Rekishi Gunzo books, and even though T=\r\nurnbull cites them \nin his books, I HIGHLY DOUBT he actually reads them, or=\r\n uses them, in \nfact, most of what he has comes from Papinot&#39;s book, includ=\r\ning the \nerrors (as stated by kitsuno at the above link - including the fac=\r\nt \nthat Turnbull doesn&#39;t CITE the book in his bibliography, which to me \nis=\r\n outright plaigiarism) - and after 20 years of &#39;research&#39;, Turnbull \nhasn&#39;t=\r\n corrected any of his errors.\n\nUnfortunately, unlike the world of ancient R=\r\noman scholarship where if \nsomeone like Turnbull tried to pass himself off =\r\nas a scholar he would \nbe hung, then after his corpse is burned at the stak=\r\ne, his remains \nwould fed to lions, there is apparently no similar &#39;peer re=\r\nview&#39; in \nJapanese history scholarship in &quot;the West&quot;.\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihist=\r\nory@y..., &quot;brand&quot; &lt;pitibrand@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; hi,\n&gt; I am a french guy interes=\r\nting about history of japan.
