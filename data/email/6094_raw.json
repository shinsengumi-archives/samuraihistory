Okay, let us in on the joke - my\n&gt; Chinese is even more limited\n&gt; than my Japanese.  (Which is essentially\n&gt; nonexistent, aside from some\n&gt; martial & historical terminology.)\n\n&quot;Bu hao&quot; literally means &quot;not good&quot;, but in usage it&#39;s\nlike &quot;no thanks&quot; in that situation. The rest I\nsaid--&quot;Wo bu xiang ni&quot;--means &quot;I don&#39;t want you&quot;. \n\n&gt; On the other hand - as a clever segue into my quick\n&gt; note to James Wilson -\n&gt; my English is pretty good. \n\nMr. Wilson has been notified that his posts will not\nbe let through unless he changes his opinion of\ncapital letters, punctuation, and proper spelling.\nThree of his posts have been rejected with the\nappropriate warnings. \n\nPlease, people--it is not hard to hit the &quot;shift&quot; key.\nUse it. Unless you are not a native English speaker or\nare under the age of 10, there is no excuse. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nAll your favorites on one personal page ï¿½ Try My Yahoo!\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
