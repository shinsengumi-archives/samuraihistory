There are kamon dictionaries which list family names  \nasso=\r\nciated with individual kamon, but that is as close as you can  \nget. If you=\r\n are able to do detailed geneological research and you  \nhappen to be parti=\r\ncularly lucky, you may be able to trace an  \nindividual back to a premodern=\r\n kamon used during the Sengoku period  \nor earlier. However, this is a dist=\r\ninct minority of cases. A lot of  \nJapanese families which claim ownership =\r\nof some kamon or other can  \nonly trace this use back to the late 19th cent=\r\nury when all Japanese  \nwere given permission to adopt kamon.\n\nAccording to=\r\n Shintoh Kenjiro in =E5=A7=93=E6=B0=8F=E5=AE=B6=E7=B4=8B=E3=81=AE=E8=BE=9E=\r\n=E5=85=B8 there is a  \nShijoh =E5=9B=9B=E6=9D=A1 family descended from the =\r\nNorthern Fujiwara in the third  \ngeneration. However, this line is not comm=\r\non enough for the kamon in  \nquestion to appear in the book.\n\nRegardless. T=\r\nhe following web page claims to have an entry for the  \nShijoh family.\n\nhtt=\r\np://www.f2.dion.ne.jp/~a-tom/newpage11.htm\n\nIt is called the =E7=94=B0=E5=\r\n=AD=97=E8=8D=89=E7=B4=8B (denjis=C3=B4mon).\n\nIt is the second kamon from th=\r\ne left on the top row on the following  \nweb page.\n\nhttp://www.harimaya.com=\r\n/o_kamon1/zukan/syokubt.html\n\nOr more specifically:\n\n=EF=BF=BC\nYou can chec=\r\nk out the actual plant at the following web page:\n\nhttp://aoki2.si.gunma-u.=\r\nac.jp/BotanicalGarden/HTMLs/denjisou.html\n\nAgain, there is no particular re=\r\nason to believe that the family in  \nquestion has any historical use of thi=\r\ns kamon.\n\nBest Wishes.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remo=\r\nved]\n\n\n"
