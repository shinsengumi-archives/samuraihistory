Also, I find Hi=\r\ndeyoshi a far more diligent character, and generally devoid of dishonour (d=\r\nespite the mental failings and brutality of the 1590s).\nIn regard though to=\r\n what Tim mentioned about the Mother of Akechi Mitsuhide, because he had pr=\r\nomised safe passage to the besieged parties, an agreement then overturned b=\r\ny Nobunaga, other retainers took it upon themselves to punish the &quot;liar&quot; Mi=\r\ntsuhide, and in the process killed his mother. There were other factors, su=\r\nch as his excellent poetry, which the lesser poet Nobunaga continuously abu=\r\nsed, but the murder of his mother was probably a far more serious cause of =\r\nthe attack on Nobunaga at the Honno-ji.\nMichael\n\nMasamori Masami &lt;oni_shogu=\r\nn@...&gt; wrote:\nHey Tim, \n\nIf you could clear some things up I would =\r\nappreciate it.  For \ninstance, why would Nobunaga want to replace the Emper=\r\nor, if he \nconquered Japan he would have gotten the title of Shogun, which =\r\n\ncarries all the power. The Emperor is just a figure head. It would \nseem t=\r\no make more sense to be Shogun than to try and over throw the \nEmperor, whe=\r\nre everyones ultimate loyalty laid.\n\nSecond, Nobunaga is betrayed twice by =\r\ntwo brothers. In 1556, \nNobuhiro, Nobunaga&#39;s elder brother, plotted with th=\r\ne new (and \nhostile) lord of Mino, Sait=F4 Yoshitatsu, an act Nobunaga woul=\r\nd later \npardon him for. In 1557, Oda Nobuyuki and Shibata Katsuie plot \nag=\r\nainst Oda Nobunaga in Owari. Though Shibata is spared, Nobuyuki is \nkilled.=\r\n Back in feudal japan its more surprising that Nobuhiro was \nspared, rather=\r\n than Nobuyuki being killed.\n\nThirdly, why trust his sister (O-ichi) to som=\r\ne one who betrayed his \ntrust (Katsuie) when he could marry her off to Asai=\r\n Nagamasa to \nsolitify an allaince (which was a very common practice). Then=\r\n when \nAsai back an enemy of Nobunaga, he became an enemy and by that time =\r\n\nKatsuie had earned back Nobunaga&#39;s trust, so why not reunite them?\n\nForthl=\r\ny, you say Toyotomi Hideyoshi used dishonorable techniques to \nclimb to his=\r\n right hand position. I was just wondering if you could \ngive some examples=\r\n?\n\nLastly, you say, &quot;He needlessly had the captives that Akechi had \nspared=\r\n to effect a surrender put to death -- including a mother, \nwhich was the m=\r\notivator that cost Akechi his own mother.&quot;\n\nIf you could elaborate on how t=\r\nhe death of a mother was \nthe &quot;motivator that cost Akechi his own mother.&quot; =\r\nI would appreciate \nit.\n\nNow I am not saying everything Nobunaga did was mo=\r\nrally right. Its \ntrue he used burtal tactics, but when the country has bee=\r\nn at war \nfor 250 years, &quot;death is necessary if you want peace.&quot;\n\n--- In sa=\r\nmuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt; Hi there.\n&gt;        =\r\nI agree with you to a point.  But only to a point.  If \nAkechi \n&gt; Mitsuhide=\r\n had not intervened, there might have been peace earlier, \ncertainly -- and=\r\n \n&gt; the key word is MIGHT, because it might NOT have -- but, come \nearlier =\r\nor come \n&gt; later, the cost of it would have been so much higher, starting \n=\r\nwith Nobunaga&#39;s \n&gt; order for Akechi to reinforce Toyotomi.  I read somewher=\r\ne -- and I \ndo not \n&gt; remember where -- that Nobunaga&#39;s ultimate goal was t=\r\no conquer all \nof Japan and \n&gt; then replace the Emperor with himself.  (Any=\r\n truth to this, \nanybody?)\n&gt;        According to the readings I&#39;ve done, as=\r\n for Nobunaga \nhimself, he was a \n&gt; brutal man, one of the two most brutal =\r\nmen alive at the time.  \n(The other was \n&gt; Tsar Ivan IV of Russia, whose li=\r\nfespan nearly mirrored that of \nNobunaga, the \n&gt; former barely outliving th=\r\ne latter, Ivan living 1530-1584 to \nNobunaga&#39;s \n&gt; 1534-1582.)  He killed hi=\r\ns own brother because of a failed revolt \nin 1557 (sparing \n&gt; his then-twic=\r\ne-future brother-in-law Shibata Katsuie), forced a \nsister (O-ichi) \n&gt; to d=\r\nivorce Shibata, whom he had forced to MARRY (I believe around \nthe age of \n=\r\n&gt; 11!!!!!) to solidify an alliance, so he could marry her off to \nANOTHER w=\r\narlord \n&gt; (Asai Nagamasa) to solidify THAT alliance, killed that brother-in=\r\n-\nlaw when he \n&gt; backed an (I believe) ages-old ally (the Asakura at Anegaw=\r\na, \n1570), remarried \n&gt; the sister to her first husband, and rewarded a man=\r\n (Toyotomi \nHideyoshi) who \n&gt; used dishonorable techniques to climb to his =\r\nright hand position.  \nHe \n&gt; needlessly had the captives that Akechi had sp=\r\nared to effect a \nsurrender put to death \n&gt; -- including a mother, which wa=\r\ns the motivator that cost Akechi \nhis own \n&gt; mother, and in effect started =\r\nthe wheels turning which brought \nNobunaga to his \n&gt; seppuku at Honno-ji.\n&gt;=\r\n        For the good he did, which there was certainly at least \nsome -- \n&gt;=\r\n including the invention of the sumo dohyo ring and the start of \nthe unifi=\r\ncation \n&gt; process -- it was better in my humble estimation that he not be \n=\r\nthe one to finish \n&gt; the unification process.  It was accomplished much mor=\r\ne peacefully \nwith \n&gt; Hideyoshi and Tokugawa.  (BTW, I have my thoughts abo=\r\nut that 1591 \nedict, too, but I \n&gt; don&#39;t want to get into them here.)\n&gt;    =\r\n    Hope this helps.  :-D\n&gt; \n&gt; Later\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
