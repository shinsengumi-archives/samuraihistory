If you can offer m=\r\ne a better translation - or better yet, a literal translation - of bunbu ic=\r\nhi, I&#39;d be grateful, because &quot;good as anything, I guess&quot; is not really enou=\r\ngh to satisfy me.  This shows up in the way you apply the term in your fina=\r\nl paragraph:  my translation makes no grammatical sense in the way you use =\r\nit, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because your grammar&#39;s bad.  There&#39;s something I=\r\n don&#39;t understand there, and I&#39;d like to.\nAnd while it does not entirely su=\r\nrprise me that some houses despised that ideal, for my own part I think it =\r\none of the redeeming features of any warrior ethic; and of the sundry value=\r\ns held by sundry warrior societies, it&#39;s one of those I think most importan=\r\nt to pursue today.  All fighting and no artistry makes Jack a dull boy, so =\r\nto speak.  I&#39;ve seen enough of Musashi&#39;s artwork to recognise real art in i=\r\nt, and those who regard Musashi as &quot;soft and poofy&quot; seem to be few and far =\r\nbetween.\nThis is not to dispute your history - I&#39;m not such a fool as that =\r\n- but to reiterate the importance I feel that bunbu ichi carries through to=\r\n the present day.\nThanks again.\n      Gereg\n\n   Date: Mon, 13 Dec 2004 19:1=\r\n7:31 -0600\n   From: Anthony Bryant &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nSubject: Re=\r\n: Japan eras - bunbu ichi/bunbu no ichi\n\nSilk Road School wrote:\n\n&gt; James, =\r\nthis is not all that amazing.  One of the ideals of the samurai was\n&gt; _bunb=\r\nu ichi_ (I&#39;ve also seen that transliterated as _bunbu no ichi_,\n\nYou should=\r\nn&#39;t. That makes no sense in Japanese, where it is, strictly, &quot;bunbu\nichi.&quot;\n=\r\n\n&gt; This has been translated as &quot;pen and sword\n&gt; in harmony.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s as goo=\r\nd as anything, I guess.\n\n&gt; You see, it is not enough to know how to swing a=\r\n sword.  Even if you regard\n&gt; your blade with the deepest respect, even if =\r\nyou practise endlessly, that is\n&gt; only a beginning.  You must also attain s=\r\nome cultural accomplishments:  to\n&gt; be able to compose poetry, say, or to d=\r\nraw well.  A samurai who couldn&#39;t\n&gt; exhibit basic literacy would not have b=\r\neen well regarded in polite society.\n\nAh, but that&#39;s the whole point. &quot;Bunb=\r\nu ichi&quot; was not a set rule. It was a\ncontroversy. There were many houses th=\r\nat openly eschewed any appearance of the\n&quot;soft, poofy stuff&quot; -- Some houses=\r\n even maintained draconian punishments like\nbanishment or forced seppuku fo=\r\nr those caught studying literature or playing\ngames or musical instruments;=\r\n they deemed these pastimes as &quot;unworthy&quot; of the\nwarrior.\n\nOther houses fel=\r\nt that, well, &quot;bunbu ichi.&quot;\n\n\n\nTony\n--\n\nAnthony J.

To: Tony Bryant\n\n\nhello to=\r\nny,\n  com&#39;on man,...it was pretty good.?? I&#39;ve seen a handful &quot;samurai&quot; mov=\r\nies in the past, (and yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but =\r\nthis is the 2000&#39;s, not the 1900&#39;s (lol). People like to see cool stuff lik=\r\ne the Last Samurai even if it isn&#39;t all that accurate. You can&#39;t tell me yo=\r\nu&#39;ve seen any better Samurai &quot;battle&quot; scenes in another movies from the pas=\r\nt?? (if so, please let me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great=\r\n movie to boost the Samurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of=\r\n people to respect them for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate =\r\nhistory stuff & think i&#39;m a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome m=\r\novie. They were like....&quot;Wow, those guys could really kick butt&quot; I don&#39;t kn=\r\now,....maybe i&#39;m wrong??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more in=\r\nsentive to practice kendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in th=\r\ne making,....delayed temp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watc=\r\nh it again and tell me that\nthose battle scenes don&#39;t want to make you get =\r\nup, build a time machine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hop=\r\nefully a good one), and fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese bac=\r\nk then were only like 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(=\r\nlol). Well, my times up. Have a good one.\n                                 =\r\n                            Yours,\n                                        =\r\n                        Mark\n\nAnthony Bryant &lt;ajbryant@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\nmark kd wrote:\n\n&gt; if you buy the movie book(or just go to your local =\r\nbook store and look at\n&gt; it), it will tell you what is accurate and what is=\r\n not(to some extent).
