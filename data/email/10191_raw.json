But as a practical matter,=\r\n men wounded in battle had to be treated.  Willingness to die notwithstandi=\r\nng, a dead samurai (or ashigaru) is worth less to his master than a living =\r\none.  As I understand it, seppuku was reserved for hopeless situations, whe=\r\nre the only other option was capture or abject failure (the death of one&#39;s =\r\ndaimyo, say).  \n\nI imagine that battlefield medicine was very catch-as-catc=\r\nh-can and based as much on Chinese medicine as was practical, but still, th=\r\ne more specifics I can get, the better off I&#39;ll be.

A Samurai who knows that he may not survive it=\r\n shall be victorious.&quot; Something along those lines.\n \nA true Samurai does n=\r\not fear death but embraces it in the face of his opponent! For it is an hon=\r\nor to die in battle than to run like a coward! Those who have shamed his cl=\r\nan are expected to commit Harikiri or sepuku! Suicide by his own Tanto. To =\r\nsave his and his family&#39;s honor! If he is lucky, he will have a &quot;Kaishaku&quot;.=\r\n A close friend or family member to cut off his head with a Katana to end t=\r\nhe painful death by disembowelment. It was considered &quot;humane&quot; ironically!\n=\r\n \nFor the Samurai, death is expected of him. Not failure, but death was thi=\r\ner way of life. They dont glorify death, but accept it as a part of thier d=\r\nuty and honor. Of course they expect to be victorious in battle always! But=\r\n they also accept death as a part of that victory!\n \nAs for medicine, if a =\r\nSamurai was not mortally wounded, I heard they used salt to stop the bleedi=\r\nng. A very painful but effective method.

My Aunt in Japan says my Samurai bl=\r\noodlines go back to a clan called the Harubiyuna. Our Kamon is two arrow fe=\r\nathers inside a circle one pointing upward, one pointing downward. Can anyo=\r\nne helpe me with learning more about my Samurai bloodlines?? My mother&#39;s ma=\r\niden name is Fukase. I am half Japanese, half American.\n\nBTW, my favorite s=\r\namurai is Miyamoto Musashi.
