Sorry about my clumsy knowledge , but I try to explain as follows;\n   \n    Sakamoto Ryoma was one of the most important guy to change Old Japan to New Japan at the end of Edo era, about 1860&#39;s.\n   \n    He came from the lowest class of Samurai , Buke , located in Sikoku.  Facing to perfect chaos reigned in Japan , like social disorder triggered by unctroll of Edo Bakufu, government  due to losing power and consecutive farmers riots against stupid Daimyo , king of prefecture who imposed\n heavier tax to them, etc,  he was afraid that Europeans and Americans  aimed Japan and did military force to make Japan as their colony like they did for China, India, and other Asian Countries.\n   \n   He tried to lead Chosu and Satsuma  (  Local han ,  small government reighned by local daimyo , king, used to be controlled completely  by  Edo  Bakufu  ) to be allied each other as one strong powerful union to fight and defend from colonialzation by them. \n    \n  He had a dream one day , Japan will change to new country to be governed by new power instead of old power ,  Edo bakufu,  and Japan  will become like European , or American  country under the control by democratic government instead of feudal power.   \n   \n    However,  he was assasinated by stupid , special group formed by old power , Edo bakufu, named Sinsengumi who tried to oust the progressionist like him to guard Edo bakufu, before his dream came true , in the interim.\n   \n    After his assasination,  soon,  the allied force of Chosu and Satuma did defend the colonicalization by Europe and America and defeted old power, Edo Bakufu, without decisive collapse triggered by war against Edo Bakufu  ,  and formed new government of Meiji  under the reign of Emperor. \n   \n     Now, Japan need best leader , like Ryoma, for example, because current , consecutive stupid Prime Ministers losing seat within a few months come out one after the other , and did nothing for us.  Japan is waisting big money and time.  Furthermore,  It is so shameful , or disaster that newest\n Prime Minister can&#39;t speak correctly about Kanji , Japanese character, even Elementary level quite sometime !!\n   \n    I have a dream , one day Japan change the election system and become like American  style and elect  Prime Minister , or newly  formed  President by people of Japan directly insteaed of indirect way like now, through almost one year campaign.  So that way, we can expect excelent leader soon.\n   \n    Eddie \n\nTom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n          Jore remember Kumi or Gumi is a suffix that means group/unit\nTry searching under Shinsen-gumi and Mimawari-gumi.
