It is in the files section in \n&gt;a folder called Bill M. Creative ain&#39;t I! :-)\n\nA wonderful piece of brainstorming. :)\n\n&gt;If anybody can mark on the map where the Byodo-in is I wouls be \n&gt;greatly pleased. Any other details you can add would be great as well!\n\nI think I see one potential problem. The Turnbull map is a much larger \nscale than the maps I&#39;ve been linking to. The map from the book is \nindeed oriented the same way - North is up. But the scal is so much \nlarger, that Uji appears as just a dot. The maps that I&#39;ve linked to \nrecently basically show &quot;inside the dot&quot;.\n\nIf a person were to mark where the Byou-dou-in is on that Turnbull \nmap, it would just be a tiny dot inside the circle that is marked \nUji.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nBy the way thanks for going to the effort to scan the map. It makes \nthe conversation much easier!\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
