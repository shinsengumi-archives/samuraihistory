I have some of his books.  Along with many\n&gt; others..  but it is hard to fit \n&gt; them all on my sailboat; lol so many are in storage.\n&gt;  Hope someone can \n&gt; enlighten me on this..  Maybe I am misinformed did\n&gt; not Mr Hayes study in Japan?  \n&gt; \n&gt;  Hope to see some interesting post; yet resepctful\n&gt; at the same time.  \n\nWell, for starters, his books contain mistakes in\nhistory so great that your average Japanese 2nd grader\nwould laugh at them. Sure, he studied in Japan--that\ndoesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s publishing correct information.\nOpinions will vary--what cannot be denied is that his\ngrasp of history is EXTREMELY flawed, if you want to\nbe kind, or dead flat wrong in myriad ways, if you\nwant to be blunt. As I&#39;ve said when discussing Hayes\nbefore: He may be a wonderful martial artist, and no\ndoubt he could take me in a streetfight. However, I\nwill not respect anyone who blatantly prints such\ninaccurate historical information. And I&#39;m not talking\nabout his &quot;ninja clan&quot; stuff--simple well-known facts\nabout Oda Nobunaga and so forth, things EVERY Japanese\nschoolkid would know, are completely garbled and spit\nout as useless trash. \n\nKitsuno&#39;s been on my case to finish a review of one of\nhis books and publish it--unfortunately, his books are\nsuch unpalatable trash that I have difficulty going\nback and doing so. \n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n"
