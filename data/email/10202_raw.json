The first rundown is available - Takashi Miike&#39;s 2002=\r\n &quot;Graveyard of Honor&quot;, as well as a post detailing the AnimEigo release and=\r\n Extras DVD.  Rather than keeping it a straight review, I try to mix it up,=\r\n keep it conversational, and add as many pertinent and entertaining links a=\r\nnd images into the text as I can find, trying to give it a more &quot;multimedia=\r\n&quot; feel. \n\nLook for the &quot;Like a Dragon&quot; rundown soon.  I hope you enjoy the =\r\nblog.\n\n\n"
