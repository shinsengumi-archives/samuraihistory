I am presently in search of the sansom text you suggested, yet, I coul=\r\ndn&#39;t get the volume set nearby. I can get some of his other works though, a=\r\nnd will secure them promptly. I am hoping to set the simulation during the =\r\n1614 edict occasion rather than the later ban on all nationals which as you=\r\n said is by the 3rd shogun of the Tokugawa. I realize the meeting never rea=\r\nlly took place where European officials would be allowed to &quot;make their cas=\r\ne&quot;, but the simulation should be an excellent occasion to see some key cult=\r\nural and economic issues come to a head.I suppose my most difficult task is=\r\n to find basically about 8 prominent daimyo that the students can represent=\r\n as Iyeysu&#39;s &quot;court&quot;obenjokusanosuke &lt;obenjokusanosuke@...&gt; wrote: --=\r\n- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Wade&quot; &lt;peterruhan@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Hel=\r\nlo, I am a history teacher in California, and I am attempting to&gt; create a =\r\nhistorical simulation regarding Iyeysu and the closing off of&gt; Japan to Eur=\r\nopeans. I am attempting to find out some histories or&gt; records of the event=\r\ns. I would particularly like to know some of the&gt; prominent families/person=\r\nas of the Tokugawa period alive in the early&gt; 1600&#39;s. &gt; &gt; I have the follow=\r\ning list&gt; &gt; Iyeysu Tokugawa&gt; Mori Terumoto&gt; Uyesugi&gt; Date Masamune&gt; Yamnano=\r\nuchi&gt; Ukita&gt; Satake&gt; &gt; I need 2 more and/or comments on the families listed=\r\n. I already have&gt; hit the Samurai Archives for family history. More help an=\r\nd direction&gt; would be, well....helpful.&gt; &gt; Many thanks,&gt; &gt; Wade Ness&gt; Socia=\r\nl Studies&gt; Oak Ridge High School&gt;There is just one fundamental problem with=\r\n all of this, although your idea sounds like a lot of fun. Ieyasu did not c=\r\nlose-off Japan. It was his grandson, the third Tokugawa Shogun, Iemitsu, wh=\r\no ultimately closed Japan to all but the Dutch, Chinese and Koreans.There a=\r\nre numerous books that touch upon this subject. I would recommend one of th=\r\ne general survey-type history books that George Sansom wrote on Japan for s=\r\ntarters. Volume 3 of his trilogy should do the trick.______________________=\r\n____________________________Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam? Yahoo!
