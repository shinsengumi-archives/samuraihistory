I \n&gt; don&#39;t really know what that means in &#39;movie talk&#39; but I guess \n&gt; essentially what it means is that the movie was not made for \n&gt; widescreen.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Howard Beasley &lt;howard@b...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks, I&#39;ve taken a look, this one seems to be a 1.33:1 screen \n&gt; format, \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve also seen one being advertised 2.35:1 is that right...or has \n&gt; some got \n&gt; &gt; things a little awry?  The version below also seems to be on \n&gt; www.cd-wow.com \n&gt; &gt; and a little cheaper too ($7-8?).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Howard\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Snip   &quot;...Message: 7\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Thu, 03 Jul 2003 04:05:31 -0000\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@s...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Seven Samurai DVD\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You NEED to get the &#39;Criterion Collection&#39; version - it is one of\n&gt; &gt; the best done DVDs I&#39;ve ever seen.  It has English subtitles\n&gt; &gt; (optional) and the best commentary track I&#39;ve ever heard.  It has\n&gt; &gt; also been remastered, and looks far more crisp than any prior\n&gt; &gt; version.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0780020685/104-\n&gt; 4493474-318  \n&gt; &gt; 3960?vi=glance\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ...&quot;  snip\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n&gt; &gt; Version: 6.0.495 / Virus Database: 294 - Release Date: 30/06/03\n\n\n\n"
