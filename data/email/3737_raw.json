All I know about him is that he  accompanied Enomoto to Hokkaido (at that time just beginning to be opened up and developed by the Japanese.) \n\nEnomoto Takeaki (born 1836) studied Dutch learning and seamanship, and studied in Holland 1862 to 67 before becoming deputy head of the Bakufu&#39;s naval department. Refused to surrender to imperial forces in 1868 and fled with warships to Hokkaido where he resisted the new government in the fortress of Goryoukaku (shaped like a star with five points according to a picturein my illustrated history and described as the defence of the north.) He surrendered in 1869, was imprisoned but then pardoned and joined the Hokkaido Colonisation Board. Then became navy minister,special envoy to Russia and China and served the Meiji govt in many ministerial positions. Died in 1908. Was made a Viscount in 1887.\n\n\nThe dictionary gives a bit more under the Boshin War heading and lists Daniels G The Japanese Civil War - a British View (MAS 1 July 1967) the Satow book you already have and Sheldon CD The Politics of the Civil War of 1868 in WG Beasley (ed) Modern Japan: Aspects of History, Literature and Society 1975. But there must be some more recent stuff in Asian academic journals. Did the websites given recently by William show anything?\n\nG\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n"
