There seem to be several different \nversions available although that may be the add ons rather than cuts for \nthe different licencing regimes.\n\nI was blown away the first time I saw this film...I have other films where \nthere are clear cuts for violence which annoy me because they&#39;re so obvious \nand I don&#39;t recall them having been there before...eg in one film a rider \nbeing toppled off a fallen horse is missing because they thought the UK \npublic would find it distressing....(it wasn&#39;t hurt apparently).  He&#39;s \nshown getting up but the incident is missing here...but not in the US.\n\nI don&#39;t want my memory of this film to be tainted in a similar way...I&#39;m in \nthe UK but have a Multi Region player.\n\nThanks\n\nHoward\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.495 / Virus Database: 294 - Release Date: 30/06/03\n\n\n\n"
