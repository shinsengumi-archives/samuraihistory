It&#39;s not that it was great drama,\nbut when he told his recruiter that he&#39;d gladly kill him for free, I\nbelieved him - and I&#39;d never believed Cruise delivering a single line before\nthat.  But I hope I don&#39;t start a dialogue with that, as it&#39;s a throwaway\nnote.   I flatly refuse to be put in the position of defending Tom Cruise.\nHistorically... aside from the colours of the grasses and skies that someone\nelse mentioned, I think the first street scene in Japan was beautiful, and\nas far as I could tell it was pretty accurate.  Somebody seemed to have gone\nto considerable trouble to establish that nicely juxtaposed set of images.\nI remain vastly amused, however, at the prospect of a foreign national who\nhas fought in a losing rebellion being permitted to carry a sword into the\nEmperor&#39;s presence.  Sure, no problem, gaijin-san, go right  in.\n\tGereg\nMessage: 5\n   Date: Mon, 13 Dec 2004 03:43:51 -0000\n   From: &quot;david a. sigler&quot; &lt;fiat_dux_das@...&gt;\nSubject: The Last Samurai, the movie.\n\n\n\n\n   I just got done finally watching the movie the &quot;Last Samurai.&quot; I\nfound it so tediously dull it isn&#39;t funny; Tom Cruz cannot act and I\ndon&#39;t care who tries to convince me otherwise. The battle scenes were\ngreat, the scenery was fairly good, but the movie was bad. My\nquestion is a simple one, what, if any of it, was historically\naccurate?\n                                             david a sigler\n\n\n\n\n\n"
