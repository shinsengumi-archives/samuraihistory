I believe\n&gt; hakamas were used during duels thus adding more\n&gt; difficulty. Obviously on the battlefield this would\n&gt; have been a detriment but in a situation like a duel\n&gt; it would have been more proper. \n\nYes, but as stated, the hakama was invented Heian\nperiod or before. Our common image of samurai dueling\nis from the Edo period. Therefore, this cannot be part\nof the CREATION of the hakama. \n\nAlso, as I stated, the vast majority of images I see\nwhere samurai are preparing for action, they have\ntheir kosode sleeves and hakama tied up. This\nstatement was meant to include dueling. Watch some\njidai-geki. If someone knows they are getting into a\nfight, they&#39;re prepared for it. The flowing hakama are\nusually on people not expecting to throw down. \n\nHere&#39;s a statue of Miyamoto Musashi, illustrating what\nI mean:\n\nhttp://www.city.mimasaka.lg.jp/kankou/musasi/kensei.files/kensei.jpg\n\nNotice the leggings holding in the hakama, and the\ntied sleeves. This is a fairly common sight in\ncontemporary prints, and the standard jidaigeki\nindication of someone about to get in a fight. Here&#39;s\nanother pic, just the top half, unfortunately:\n\nhttp://www.mifuneproductions.co.jp/film/image/film_56_a.gif\n\nRegardless, the original question was about the\norigins of the hakama. The image you&#39;ve got in your\nhead is from the Edo period. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
