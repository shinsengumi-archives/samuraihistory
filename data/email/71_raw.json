I hope this helps. \n\nhttp://members.fortunecity.com/serizawa\n\nThe site is a translation site for the Rurouni Kenshin manga(comic),\nbut it has a section which deals with the Shinsengumi, a famous group\nof swordmen who protected the citizens of Kyoto from the Isshinshishi(Pro-emperor radicals) during the mid-19th century. The owner of the site is very knowledgable with the said group, and you can ask him for more info should you find the content of his site insufficient.\n\nFor my question, can anyone here provide me with more info about the Miura family? All I know about them is that they were of great help in putting the Minamoto family into power and that they were from the Kinugasa region(somewhere near Kamakura?).\n\nBack to lurker mode.\n\n__________________________________\nwww.edsamail.com\n\n\n"
