Mostly its a brief history of the\n&gt; Matsudaira clan, Ieyasu&#39;s\n&gt; early battles before Okehazama, and the condition\n&gt; Mikawa Bushi. Some maps\n&gt; and charts but no specific order of battle. Also its\n&gt; all in Japanese.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
