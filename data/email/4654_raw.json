After reading that book, I say bring it on! I\n  fear you not! ;-)\n\n  Cheers\n  Bill M.\n\n  Original Message:\n  -----------------\n  From:  Eponymous13@...\n  Date: Wed, 23 Jun 2004 23:23:41 EDT\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Tale of the Heike (was Re: [samuraihistory] Uji-kawa)\n\n\n  Hey\n         I know, it&#39;s a stylistic difference and the people who read the book \n  at the time saw them as enhancements, but when I read &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot;,\n  I \n  ended up not finishing it, the main reason having to stop for all of the\n  titles, \n  which took away from the enjoyment of the story.  But read it for yourself, \n  and make up your own mind.  I will at some point go back to it and wade my \n  painful way through it.  :-)  Take care.
