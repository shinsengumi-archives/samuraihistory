That has \nmeant, among other things, that the amount of hits per day has \ntripled and the number of hits per month is approaching 50,000!\nWhat does this mean? It means that we have had to increase traffic \nlimits yet further, which has increased the fees (Delphi forum fees \nare also included), so we&#39;ve instated something we hope everyone will \nfind interesting:\n\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/donate.html\n\nFor anyone interested in helping with the cost of the server, we&#39;ve \nimplemented donations via PayPal.  All donations are tracked on the \nabove &#39;donations&#39; page, and rank and Sengoku biographies are bestowed \non all who donate.  Any amount at all helps.  We&#39;re still in the \nprocess of tweaking the ranks, titles, and bios, but I think you see \nthe basic idea.  \n\nFor anyone who can&#39;t part with any actual cash, we highly encourage \nsubmissions to assist us in constantly upgrading the page.  Anything \nfrom desktop wallpapers to research projects are accepted - take a \nlook at the &#39;featured articles&#39; section to see past submissions.  \n\nAlso, don&#39;t forget to check the Samurai Archives store as well. There \nmight be something there worth picking up as well.\n\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n\nThanks to those who have contributed both donations and submissions, \nand KOTOSHI MO YOROSHIKU ONEGAI SHIMASU!\n\nC.West & F.Seal\n\n\n\n"
