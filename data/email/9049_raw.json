Your devotion to budo does you honor. \nThose whom you respect would however be horrified at you showing your \nrespect by getting a tattoo. If you have students consider them &quot;showing&quot; \ntheir respect for you by torturing small animals. Something they may be \n&quot;into&quot; that you most definately wouldn&#39;t support. What would *your* reaction \nbe?\n\n  In addition, a small note. A lack of correct punctuation is not the way to \ngarner respect on this board. If you wish to be taken seriously, you have to \nshow appropriate seriousness in your posts. That includes taking the time \nfor capitalization and punctuation.\n\nM.J.
