Remember that all the responses are by different people, so\nthere=\r\n might be some overlap. \n \nQ: Gang, suppose that a Portuguese soldier encou=\r\nntered a Samurai and\nthey\nhad a duel / fight back in the 16th cent, which w=\r\nould be more likely to\nwin ? \n  \nDid anything like this ever happen ? Is it=\r\n documented ?\n \n \nA: \nI have seen this documented somewhere many years back=\r\n, but can&#39;t recall\nwhere.  The author felt that a European would win, becau=\r\nse the Samurai\nwas constrained to use certain traditional slashing cuts to =\r\ncertain\ntraditional striking points, while the European would tend towards\n=\r\nthrusts to the chest.  The European fighting style had a far, far\ngreater r=\r\neach than the traditional Samurai slashing motion cuts. \n \nI recall that Mu=\r\nsashi Miyamato was said to take advantage of the\ntraditional limitations of=\r\n  striking cuts used by his opponents, and\nslip in a blow to the groin or t=\r\nwo to soften them up.  Definitely in any\nEuropean&#39;s bag of tricks.\n \n \nA: \n=\r\nMy friend Akio related to me a story passed on to him by his\ngrandfather.  =\r\nAccording to the story, at the battle of Shimonoseki, a\nJapanese and an Eng=\r\nlishman were fighting.  The Englishman kept jabbing\nthe Japanese, and the J=\r\napanese just stood there.  Suddenly, the\nEnglishman got in closer, and the =\r\nJapanese swung his sword one time,\nending the fight.  \nI do not know whethe=\r\nr this actually happened, just relaying what I was\ntold, and I am not open =\r\nto any arguments on this story.\nGanbatte!\n\n \nA:\na  German guy nailed the ja=\r\npanese officer in  Tsingtao ( spelling ? )\nduring the ww1..................=\r\n..\n \nA:\nThe person who was better trained would likely win.  Each weapon ha=\r\ns\nadvantages and disadvantages.  Also, don&#39;t discount the thrusting\npotenti=\r\nal of the Japanese blade.  Most will handle more axial loading (\nfor thrust=\r\ning) without buckling than the European weapons.  The major\nadvantage of th=\r\ne European blade is weight and reach, which can be\ncountered by a parry and=\r\n rapidly closing the distance between opponents.\n \nA: \nHello All,\nThere was=\r\n an emergency room doctor a few years ago who was interested in\nfencing. he=\r\n researched injuries that were documented in European duels\nand found that =\r\nmost ended with both dying due to infection. I would\nwager that the Samurai=\r\n Afu spoke of died as well, just a bit later then\nthe Englishman.\n \nI would=\r\n think that the better warrior would prevail, but as this would\nchange from=\r\n one fight to the next there is really no one answer.\n \nA:\nSwords, swordsme=\r\nn, armour, period, school, strategy, experience...  Any\nother variables you=\r\n can think to plug into the equation?  It&#39;s kind of\nlike asking if throwing=\r\n a coin off of a building will hurt much.  Well,\nthrowing a 5p coin off a w=\r\nater shed will make you wonder if an acorn\nhasn&#39;t just hit you, throwing a =\r\n5 ruble coin off of the Parthenon is\ngoing to hurt a lot more, and a US 1/2=\r\n dollar off of the Empire State\nbuilding would kill just about anything... =\r\n \n \nNow, back to swords ;-)\n \nA:\nThe short answer: The fellow with the most=\r\n confidence irrespective of \n\nweapon. It is not, and never will be, the wea=\r\npon that makes the\ndifference. \n\nI would be a lot more attentive to combat =\r\nwith someone who had mastered \n\ntheir art and was armed with a rusty lawnmo=\r\nwer blade than someone with \n\nlesser experience and the best damned sword i=\r\nn the world. Please see the\n\n\nstory of the tea master in D.T. Suzuki, Zen a=\r\nnd the Art of Japanese\nculture, \n\nchapters on sword. That is another story =\r\nthat illustrates the concept.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMike Blue\n\nPS I do not have t=\r\nhe references, but someone on this list may have them.\n\n\nBut there are repo=\r\nrts to the effect that a Frenchman, a master of the\npointy \n\nschool of swor=\r\nd, faced off against a nihonto practitioner in the early\n20th \n\ncentury. Th=\r\ne fight ended in about two seconds after the Frenchperson\nlost \n\nhis sword =\r\narm and it was all the referee could do to stop the nihonto\nfellow \n\nfrom t=\r\nrimming away other nonessential body parts (or something like\nthat, \n\npardo=\r\nn my paraphrase).\n\n \n\nA:\n\nHellow all,\n\n\n\n I would think the Samurai blade s=\r\ntriking a european blade could easily\nbreak his oppnents sword and I could =\r\nsee the samurai being much quicker.\nIf this was indeed the case and both ma=\r\nn went to hand to hand combat, I\ncould easily see the samurai with the uppe=\r\nr hand. Just a thought \n\n\n\nA: \n\nNever forget Miyamoto Musashi and his boat =\r\noar!!!\n\n-P\n\n \n\nA: \n\nDon&#39;t forget about a rock in a sox!\n\nI agree that it is=\r\n mental training of the person using the sword or \n\nwhatever, Having been t=\r\nrained by some very sever Japanese and Okinawan \n\nSensei I would give the n=\r\nod to the Japanese trained samurai.\n\nNow,also is it my imagination or do Ko=\r\nto just naturally cut well? Is it \n\nthat they were designed for just one pu=\r\nrpose (fighting) and this is the \n\nreason they cut so well. I have a almost=\r\n worn out 29 3/4 inch koto \n\nblade that just cuts anything. It handles like=\r\n it is a part of me. So \n\nthe question is do Koto blades just naturally han=\r\ndle well because they \n\nwere designed for only purpose. Is this why the Jap=\r\nanese prize them? \n\nDid the Shinshinto blades give up usage for beauty?\n\n \n=\r\n\nA: \n\nRick,\n\nSome sword scholars feel that the shinshinto blades became not=\r\nhing more\nthan a canvas on which to display the sword smiths art.
