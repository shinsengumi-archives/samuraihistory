(I&#39;m also iterested\n&gt; in battle paintings or \n&gt; prints from this time frame)\n\nSomeone may have already mentioned it, but Varley&#39;s\n&quot;The Onin War&quot; is THE source in English. I reread it a\nfew months back. \n\nFor armor, etc., try Stephen Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai\nWarriors&quot;. For all of Turnbull&#39;s faults, that&#39;s a real\ngood one as far as showing the particular armor of\neach time period, and how it adapted and evolved.\nGreat color prints. \n\nAlso for weapons/armor I&#39;d try Bottomley and Hopson&#39;s\n&quot;Arms and Armour of the Samurai&quot;, as that does a good\njob of showing time periods also. \n\nFor tactics, there isn&#39;t a whole lot out there for\nthis time period--mainly because there wasn&#39;t a whole\nlot documented about the actual tactics of the time\nperiod. Of course, most of the fighting at the\nbeginning of the Onin War as house to house street\nfighting in the capital, which doesn&#39;t take much\ntactical genius--circle a house, light it on fire, and\nkill the enemy as he comes out seems to be a common\nversion. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
