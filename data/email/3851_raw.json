I \n&gt;wonder if you have read this? In it he remarks on Oshio&#39;s influence \n&gt;on Saigo Takamori and his unique role in Japanese history in seeking \n&gt;justice for the common people.\n\nI hadn&#39;t read it, actually ... I&#39;d come across the review, and wanted \nto read the book for Oshio and the chapter on Amakusa Shiro, but I&#39;d \nforgotten. Once you reminded me, I went to the library and checked \nout the book. It was quite helpful, thank you - and thank you again, \nsince Amakusa Shiro is a personal interest of mine. I learned quite a \nbit. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nNatasha Compagnon\n\n\n\n"
