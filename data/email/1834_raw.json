There has probablu been something in the\ngeneral function of the oniwabanshu in Kyoto. As said in an other mail\non sthe subject of &quot;ninjas&quot; and Shinobu. They have with out a doubt\nexisted. We just dont know very much about them, and their activites.\nBut then again, they were sceret spies and guerillas so it would have\nbeen counterproductive to be known.\n\nAs a modern paralell, There are 120 suspected spy academies around the\nworld. But only two publicly known. CIA&#39;s The Farm outside Washinton DC\nand i think the other one is in UK or Russia. Not sure there.\nDo we know what and who are training there? Nope. Not a clue. Why? sore\nwa himitsu des! (as Xellos would have said)\n \n\n\n\n/// Chris \n\n&quot;God&#39;s in his heaven.

My name is Daniele.\n&gt; &#39;til today I kept reading your discussions because i&#39;m a \n&gt; student of japanese literature and language. I would like to \n&gt; know if oniwabanshu existed for real or they are fantasy? \n&gt; thanks a lot\n&gt; Daniele\n&gt; \n\n\n"
