It is quite\neasy to spend two/three hours in the oriental gallery on its own let alone\nthe rest of the building - so allocate the full day to a visit.  Another\nplace well worth the visit, although not in the same league, is Snowshill\nManor in Broadway. They have a room with twenty or so suits of samurai\narmour in display/diorama. I was there several years ago about the time it\nwas going through a refurbishment. It is a National Trust building so you\ncan obtain more info there.\n\nI visited the Museum in Glasgow in 2000, they have four suits of Samurai\nArmour if memory serves!  It may be that several other provincial museums\nhave some bits so its worth dropping in when passing!! I caught a great\nexhibition a few years back at the Rochester Museum in Kent (which was so\nout of the way).\n\nThe London collections I believe have all gone to make up the Leeds\nArmouries.\n\nIf I think of others I will mail again..\n\nRegards,\n                    Rod Johnson\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Ray&quot; &lt;ray@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, April 20, 2002 12:23 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] places to visit\n\n\n&gt; Sirs,\n&gt;\n&gt;        Could anyone e-mail me with information on collections of samurai\n&gt;        armour and weapons that I can visit in the U.K.\n&gt;        I have surfed the internet and believe the Royal Armouries at Leeds\n&gt;        to be the best, unless you know any better?\n&gt;        From the Northeast of England.\n&gt;        My personel favorite period of samurai history is the mid to late\n&gt;        16th century and especially Oda Nobunaga and the battle of\n&gt;        Nagashino.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
