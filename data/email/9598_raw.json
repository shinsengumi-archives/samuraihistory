This is an auction for 3 Sengoku Daimyo related\nmanga - Oda Nobunaga, Hojo Soun, and Takeda Shingen.\n\nThe Oda Nobunaga manga is the first issue of a series and is also a\nfirst edition, in great condition.  Takeda Shingen is issue #5, and is\n20 years old, but in good condition, with some signs of wear and age. \nHojo Soun is probably the most impressive (to me at least), it is a\nstand-alone issue (and first edition), which covers Hojo Soun&#39;s life\nfrom the Onin war onward.  It has great artwork, and is from the series\n&quot;Sengoku Busho Retsuden&quot;.\n\nAll three are imported from Japan and in Japanese.  Here is the auction\nURL for more info and for bidding:\n\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=190125691876\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
