Many of the\nbest stories and most interesting historical info were never translated in\nthe English editions.\n    I love the series, it is an excellent window on the ideals of the time\nand how we percieve what is just and unjust today.\n    I reccomend Kubikiri Asa, the stories are shorter and self contained and\nvery easy to follow even if one doesn&#39;t read Japanese.\n    pray for surf,\n\nTom\n\n\n\n"
