Whether Gothic or Maximilian,  German or Italian \nor French, the armourers seemed to take more care in what we would call the \nergonomics of armor than did their contemporaries in Japan.  If one studies \nmerely the arm defenses of both knight and samurai...not getting into the \ntechnical terms French or Japanese..it seems apparent (at least to me)  that there \nwas more technical sophistication, including armpit armor,  in the armor shops \nof Augsburg than in Sakai.  Of course, the question arises also did Japan have \nthe mineral resources to produce all the steel armor  that Europe had?  Jack\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
