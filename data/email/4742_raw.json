In \nTurnbull&#39;s\n&quot;samurai sourcebook&quot;, there is no en=\r\ntry for magoichi but shigehide is\nrefered as gunnery expert for hideyoshi w=\r\nhose birth and death dates \nare\nunknow and who fought in Komaki and Nagakut=\r\ne.\n\nIf you find any more info (like the origin of suzuki clan), I am \ninter=\r\nested.\n\nJ=E9r=F4me.\n\n\n\n\n"
