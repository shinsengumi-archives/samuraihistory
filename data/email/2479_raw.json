Nobunaga and Hideyoshi\n&gt; castles were perfect \n&gt; example of the artistic abundance and extravagance\n&gt; of the period.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bye,\n&gt; Cepo, Honolulu.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS=I have a couple of very nice shots of Hideyoshi&#39;s\n&gt; castle in Momoyama \n&gt; (Fushimi), is there any way I can share them with\n&gt; you?
