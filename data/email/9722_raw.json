You could try  \ncenturyfitness.com, they have a new signature sword collection, and since it  \nis in dollars it would be pretty cheap in \npounds.  Also, I would give  Bugei.com a try.  Be warned about century \nthough, their swords are not  traditionally forged.\nDO NOT BUY A SWORD FROM CENTURY!!! The Signature Series is made by Hanwei.  \nThe rest is just junk. Bugei, also gets their swords from Hanwei. Check out \n_www.casiberia.com_ (http://www.casiberia.com)  . If you are looking for  \nreplica&#39;s, Hanwei is the way to go. Not cheap, but a high level of  quality.\n \nGreg\n\n\n\n**************Planning your summer road trip?
