Apparently the Nishina clan\nwere initially enemies of the Takeda, but eventualy became allied with\nthem, or at least fell under thier influence.  That might explain why\nMorinobu was adopted by them.  Thats about all I have on the\nNishina....

Does anyone else \n&gt; have any information on the Nishina clan? Mon? Other Descendents? It \n&gt; is part of my family heritage and I am having great difficulty \n&gt; finding anything out. Any help would be appreciated. Please do not \n&gt; respond to the above email address.
