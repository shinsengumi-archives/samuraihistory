He hoped that an invasion should be\n&gt; possible to gain Korea as a sa=\r\ntellite state. The government refused\nhis\n&gt; request because of  fear of Eur=\r\nopean intervention. These are the only\n&gt; thing the rebellion have to share =\r\nwith another nation.\n\nThe late prof. Hiraizumi Kiyoshi says very differentl=\r\ny.\n\n&quot;The Korean government rejected the Meiji notification [end of\nshogunat=\r\ne, new\ngovernment announced] and committed many untoward acts. Therefore, K=\r\nido\nTakayoshi and others thought it necessary to respond militarily to\nchas=\r\ntise\nKorea for her rude behavior toward Japan. ... With that, discussions\nb=\r\negan on\nthe 12th day of the 6th month of Meiji 6 (1873).... Itagaki advocat=\r\ned a\nswift\nmilitary response. Saigo suppressed this intent, maintaining tha=\r\nt\ndiplomatic\nmissions should instead be sent to deal calmly but firmly with=\r\n Korea. He\nproposed himself for the mission, and ultimately it was agreed t=\r\nhat he\nwould go.\n... [then Okubo and Kido and other goverment officials ret=\r\nurned to Japan\nfrom a\nworld-crossing fact-finding mission.] .... heated wor=\r\nd were exchanged at\na\ncouncil on the 14th day of the 10th month. Concerned,=\r\n the chancellor\nSanjo\nbecame ill and Iwakura took his place as the chancell=\r\nor&#39;s proxy. On the\n22nd of\nthe 10th month, they resolutely rejected the pre=\r\nvious council decision.\nAs a\nresult, that same day, Saigo resigned his posi=\r\ntion as Councilor, and the\nnext\nday Itagaki, Soejima Taneomi, Goto, and Eto=\r\n followed suit.
