However, I trust\nthat the following might be relevant.\n\nSir:\nYour name rings a distinct bell, and I find myself wondering if you were\nover in northern California a couple of years back teaching at a European\nMartial Arts Symposium.\nBut be that as it may:  more to the point in this context:  aside from the\npotential misunderstanding and ridicule, there&#39;s the satisfaction of\nspeaking up on a subject that matters to one... and likewise, the shame of\nsitting silently by while someone speaks ill of an article of one&#39;s faith.\n\n\nAs a student of Japanese swords for many years and having handled and\nclosely studied thousands in this time, this is what I think.\n\nIn the Shinto religion, many things are credited with having a spirit and\nthe sword is not an exception. However, this was then and now is now. When\none picks up a sword of great antiquity and of historical importance, a\nsensitive and sympathetic person cannot help but be greatly impressed. The\nsugata, texture of the steel and the activities in the hamon will convey the\nbeauty and grace of the sword if the viewer has the necessary expertise to\nunderstand and appreciate it. It is possible in some cases to see and begin\nto understand the spirit the maker has imbued in the sword and maybe his\ncharacter also. For instance, a sword from the often flamboyant Osaka Shinto\nschool quite obviously reflects the somewhat brash nature of that city at\nthe time. However, I think in many ways this is similar to seeing the\ntortured emotions of Van Gogh in one of his paintings. But to attribute this\nto a mystical force is probably ill-advised in this day and age.\n\nNow simple honesty requires me (in such a context) to state that my own\npersonal theology has a great deal in common with Shinto - so much so that\nit came as a great delight for me to discover that rich tradition of faith a\ncouple of decades back - and as such it only seems reasonable, to me at\nleast, for us still to recognise the spirit in certain objects not currently\nwidely regarded as possessing the same.  I envy you the experience of\nhandling those fine old swords.  I&#39;ve only handled two blades older than a\ncentury or so, myself, so I can&#39;t say much on that score.  To attribute any\nsuch thing to a &quot;mystical force&quot; could definitely be regarded as\nill-advised, as subsequent evidence has indeed indicated.  But to shrink\nfrom a truth simply because it&#39;s unpopular could be regarded as worse - as\ncowardice - and I&#39;d far rather be ill-advised than cowardly.\n\nIt\nsurprises me that martial arts people feel that a &quot;sword is talking to them&quot;\nwhen this does not seem to be the case with those more familiar with swords\nunless being able to learn when, and where it was made and maybe its\nhistorical context by close scrutiny, may be considered as communication\nwith the sword.\n\nI must ask you if it seems to you that &quot;those more familiar with swords&quot;\npossess the same variety and intensity of familiarity as those who live with\nthem and work with them daily.  My own thought is that these are two very\ndifferent species of familiarity; and that those who study the blades may\nnot always be as &quot;sensitive and sympathetic&quot; to the nature of swords as\nthose who handle them constantly.  Teaching a variety of international sword\nstyles provides me with my livelihood, and while I admit that I&#39;ve only been\nteaching for thirty-odd years, and practising on a more-or-less daily basis\nfor a mere forty years or so, still I can&#39;t help feeling that in that time\nI&#39;ve developed just a little bit of familiarity with swords myself.  I\nfreely acknowledge the practitioner&#39;s bias against the academic here, and I\nhope that my caution in stating all this does not come across as sarcasm.\n\nI have always considered that in Japanese sword study, kendo\n(or Iai-do) is the practical side of the academic study of Japanese swords,\nbut that it is all kendo in the final analysis and both are equally\nimportant and need to be undertaken together. In other words, kendo people\nare missing a great deal by having no understanding of the Japanese sword\nand the reverse also applies.\n\nHear, hear.  Indeed, it is my own experience that kendo does not accurately\nrepresent the martial swordplay of Japan, any more than fencing represents\nEuropean rapier or small-sword combat, with the result that (even though our\nfull-speed sparring is carried out with shinai) I term mine a kenjutsu\nstyle - including iai-jutsu, cutting practise, regarding the entire body as\ntarget, attempting to block blows with the ridge when possible, and concerns\nover the breaking of a sword due to abuse or carelessness in combat.\n\nWe are taught to view swords calmly and in a relaxed and unexcited manner\nwhether we are looking at a National Treasure or a kazu-uichi-mono. In this\nway we will see everything that the sword has to offer. It may not talk to\nus, but the educated and informed viewer will know the sword intimately.\n\nI hope I&#39;ve not bored you to death with the above and that it at least makes\na modicum of sense.\n\nNot a bit of it, and a great deal:  in that order.  And may I say that I\nboth respect and greatly envy your formal education in these matters.  I\nthink you&#39;ve made some important points, whether or not I find myself in\nentire agreement.\n\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\nIn honour,\n        Gereg Jones Muller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
