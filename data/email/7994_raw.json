Although I have great respect for \nSasama-sensei (and four of his books), I was not fortunate enough to have \nmet him personally. I had hoped for an opportunity at Soma next year. His \ncontributions to field of japanese armouring are enormous. He will be \ngreatly missed.\n\n  I will contact you off list.\n\nM J Peters\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
