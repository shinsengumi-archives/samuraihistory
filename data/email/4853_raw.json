Is it not quite\n&gt; strange that the date and place of his birth is\n&gt; unknown but a flag or a banner that usually\n&gt; represent a group or a tribe, a clan and even a\n&gt; national identity is attached to this single\n&gt; person(perhaps a head of the family I�fm not really\n&gt; sure), yet nothing is recorded of him? We are\n&gt; familiar that banners or flags are used as a\n&gt; rallying point in a military charge or as a symbol\n&gt; of unity and solidarity. But the identity of the man\n&gt; linked with a flag had been neglected. Quite\n&gt; strange, isn�ft it?  \n\nWell, if it was the person&#39;s personal standard\n(uma-jirushi), then there is nothing odd about it at\nall. Personal standards were used by most well-known\ngenerals as a big &quot;I AM HERE&quot; marker, for both friend\nand foe to see. Hideyoshi used the golden gourd (be it\n1 or 1,000 is up to which version you read), Ieyasu\nused a golden fan, Nobunaga used an umbrella...but we\nalso have examples where generals used flags. Takeda\nKatsuyori used a big square flag with the character ��\n&quot;Dai&quot; on it. It&#39;s quite possible that this Toshitsugu\nhad a similiar uma-jirushi to identify his location to\nhis troops in battle. Of course, the flag description\n(Can the original person who asked the question post\nthe description of the flag, as it may help ID him)\nmay be a description of the sashimono his retainers\nwore, or of a personal sashimono he wore. \n\n&gt; Now I wonder if this Toshiaki is the same as\n&gt; Toshitugu, (I just hope so. Still I�fm aware that\nI�fm\n&gt; standing on a shaky ground.) But the Japanese\n&gt; already had a custom of changing their names so it\n&gt; might be probable that with some sleight of\n&gt; circumstance Toshiaki had been changed to Toshitogu.\n\nWell, it&#39;s possible, but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s probable.\nYou could conjecture, with some certainty (51%\nanyways), that being as they both had the surname\nHonda, and the character &quot;Toshi&quot; in their given names,\nthat they were related. Beyond that, it&#39;s simply\nconjecture to say he was the same person, or the son,\nor father, or brother, or whomever. You can&#39;t get that\nout of the names. \n\n&gt; (Still I�fm not very sure). I�fm not an expert of\nthe\n&gt; Japanese language but I came to observe that\n&gt; Japanese words especially verbs changes their\n&gt; suffixes to change the form of tenses, sometimes to\n&gt; negate the affirmative word that are used in\n&gt; negative sentences. \n\nThis doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Japanese naming\nconventions. You don&#39;t &quot;conjugate&quot; names. While it was\ncommon for Japanese of the period to change their\nnames (Kinoshita Tokichiro -- Kinoshita Hideyoshi --\nHashiba Hideyoshi --Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Matsudaira\nMotonobu -- Motoyasu -- Tokugawa Motoyasu -- Tokugawa\nIeyasu being the two most commonly known cases), it\nhad nothing to do with conjugating or negating prior\nmeanings. \n\nFor a good introduction to naming, try here:\n\nhttp://www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany/miscellany.html\n\nNow I went to the Japanese google, and tried a few\ndifferent combinations of Honda Toshitsugu. Nothing\ncame up for �{�c�����@or �{������. \n\nGot 81 links for �{���r��, 6 sites for �{�c�r��.\n\nNo sites for �{�c�q�� or �{���q��. \n\n�{�c�r�� (Honda Toshitsugu, with the &quot;da&quot; kanji\nmeaning field):\n\nHeld Kameyama Castle in Ise province (Mie Prefecture)\nfrom 1636-1651\nhttp://www.kameyama-mie.jp/~nisi/tiiki2/osiro/osiro1.htm\n\nIt looks like he paid for renovations to the Zenkou-ji\ntemple in Shinano (Nagano) in 1661. Funnily enough,\nthe background on this site is the Honda mon, but I\nthought that was only the Tadakatsu branch. \n\nhttp://www.mediawars.ne.jp/~zenkouji/histry.html\n\nThat seems to be all for him. \n\nLet me wade through the descriptions for the other\nHonda (&quot;da&quot; being the character for much, &quot;ooi&quot;), and\nI&#39;ll post them.
