Tony, Nate, I know you \ntwo will tear=\r\n it apart best as possible so I won&#39;t bother asking. &lt;g&gt;\n\nBTW, this is the =\r\nvery begining of the book, its just kind of meant \nto set up the time and i=\r\nntroduce the people to (basically) what the \ntime and place was like.\n\n--\nM=\r\narch 15, 1854, Edo=85\n\n\tThe American sailor walked into the restaurant, his=\r\n \ntranslator trailing quietly behind.\n\t&quot;Order me a drink,&quot; he told his tran=\r\nslator, sitting down at \na table. &quot;Whiskey.&quot;\n\t&quot;No whiskey,&quot; the translator =\r\nsaid, shaking his head. &quot;Sake. \nRice wine.&quot;\n\t&quot;Rice wine?!&quot; the sailor asked=\r\n incredulously. &quot;Don&#39;t you \npeople eat enough of that stuff? Now you&#39;ve got=\r\n me drinking it, too! \nYeah, sure, order me some of that. It&#39;s good, right?=\r\n&quot;\n\t&quot;Very good,&quot; the translator nodded. He turned to the waiting \nwaitress, =\r\nordering some of the wine. Turning back to the sailor, he \nsaid, &quot;Bathroom,=\r\n&quot; and then walked off.\n\tThe waitress came over, putting the wine and two cu=\r\nps down. \nThe sailor glanced up, saying, &quot;Thank you.&quot; When the waitress gav=\r\ne \nhim a blank, confused look, he quickly realized his error. &quot;Ah=85 sheh \n=\r\nsheh?&quot;\n\t&quot;That is Chinese,&quot; a gruff voice came from behind the \nsailor. An i=\r\nmportant looking man with a long and short sword tied to \nhis waist came up=\r\n and sat down across from him. He wore odd pants, \nalmost a cross between t=\r\nrousers and a skirt, along with a flowing \nrobe covered by a simple, stiff-=\r\nsleeved jacket. His hair was shaved \nfrom his forehead to the top, and the =\r\nback was tied into an odd-\nlooking ponytail that sat atop his head. &quot;Say, `=\r\nArigato&#39;,&quot; he \ninstructed the sailor.\n\t&quot;Oh.&quot; The sailor turned to the waitr=\r\ness. &quot;Arigato,&quot; he said \nto her.\n\tSmiling at the sailor with the realizatio=\r\nn of what he&#39;d been \ntrying to say, she bowed, saying &quot;Do itashimashite,&quot; a=\r\nnd walked off.\n\t&quot;You are American,&quot; the Japanese man said.\n\t&quot;And you&#39;re Nip=\r\nponese,&quot; the sailor commented dryly.\n\t&quot;I am samurai,&quot; the Japanese replied,=\r\n a slight indignation \nin his voice. &quot;You are with the black ships.&quot;\n\t&quot;Blac=\r\nk ships?&quot; the sailor asked. &quot;Oh, yeah. I&#39;m with the \nblack ships.&quot;\n\t&quot;May I =\r\nask you a question?&quot; The samurai asked.\n\t&quot;Sure, shoot,&quot; the sailor said, po=\r\nuring some sake into a cup.\n\t&quot;Why is it so important to America that Japan =\r\nopen up?&quot; the \nsamurai asked. &quot;I spoke to a Chinese man. He claimed that Am=\r\nerica is \nthe land of gold.&quot;\n\t&quot;Yeah, we got gold,&quot; the sailor said. He swal=\r\nlowed the sake \nhard. A split second passed, and his eyes went wide and he =\r\ngagged.\n\t&quot;You drink sake too fast,&quot; the samurai said, slight \namusement sho=\r\nwing in his eyes. &quot;Sip sake.&quot;\n\t&quot;Sip it, right=85&quot; the sailor said, nodding =\r\nhis head, his face \nstill red with discomfort.\n\t&quot;So, if America is a land o=\r\nf gold, why does America care \nabout Japan? What do we have that you could =\r\nwant?&quot; the samurai asked.\n\t&quot;Well, this sake isn&#39;t all that bad,&quot; the sailor=\r\n said, \nsipping a little.\n\t&quot;You want sake?&quot; the samurai said, bewildered.\n\t=\r\n&quot;Sorry, that was a joke,&quot; the sailor said. &quot;You Nipponese \nneed to get out =\r\nmore.&quot;\n\t&quot;We like how we are,&quot; the samurai said. &quot;We do not want to \nget out=\r\n more.&quot;\n\t&quot;But don&#39;t you want to trade? China opened its borders and \nnow it=\r\n trades a lot,&quot; the sailor said.\n\t&quot;What good is trade?&quot; the samurai asked. =\r\n&quot;China belongs to \nBarbarians now. They are ruined by Opium; they have lost=\r\n everything \nfor trade.&quot;\n\tThe sailor stopped and thought. &quot;To be honest, I =\r\ncan&#39;t give \nyou a straight answer. I&#39;m just a sailor.&quot;\n\t&quot;I see.&quot; Samurai no=\r\ndded. &quot;Here in Japan, men like you are in \ncharge.&quot;\n\t&quot;Men like me?&quot; the sai=\r\nlor asked, daring to take another sip \nof his sake.\n\t&quot;Warriors,&quot; the samura=\r\ni said. &quot;Bushi.&quot;\n\t&quot;We chose who&#39;s in charge,&quot; the sailor said, pausing to t=\r\nake \nanother sip, &quot;in America. All the people, that is,&quot; he added.\n\t&quot;All=85=\r\n the people?&quot; the samurai asked, confused.\n\t&quot;Every four years, we all vote =\r\non some people who want to \nrun our country, and whoever gets the most vote=\r\ns, they run it for \nfour years until we vote again,&quot; the sailor said. &quot;At l=\r\neast, I think \nthat&#39;s how it works.&quot;\n\t&quot;Here, in Japan, a member of the Toku=\r\ngawa house runs the \ncountry,&quot; the samurai explained.\n\t&quot;Like a king,&quot; the s=\r\nailor nodded. &quot;We used to be like that. \nBut then we had a revolution.&quot;\n\t&quot;A=\r\n revolution?&quot; the samurai asked, confused.\n\t&quot;Yeah,&quot; the sailor said. He pau=\r\nsed, sighed, and took another \nsip of the sake. It was quickly becoming app=\r\narent that this would \nnever be his drink of choice. &quot;A bunch of farmers go=\r\nt together and \nbeat back the British.&quot;\n\t&quot;That happened here,&quot; the samurai =\r\nsaid. &quot;But the farmers \nlost.&quot;\n\t&quot;Well,&quot; the sailor shrugged, not sure what =\r\nto say. He took \nanother sip of his sake, and refilled his cup.\n\t&quot;Do you th=\r\nink we will have a revolution here?&quot; the samurai \nasked the sailor. &quot;It has=\r\n been peaceful for so long.&quot;\n\tThe sailor shrugged. &quot;Up to you Nipponese, I =\r\nguess.&quot;\n\tThe samurai nodded. &quot;My son, he has two children. They were \nborn =\r\nthree years ago. I hope that there will be no revolution, or \nelse they wil=\r\nl have to fight it.&quot;\n\t&quot;So you&#39;re a grandfather, huh?&quot; the sailor asked, gla=\r\nncing \nat him, a little surprised. &quot;You sure look young.&quot;\n\t&quot;Samurai are war=\r\nriors meant for war, but my family has been \nhappy farming in Okinawa for t=\r\nhe last one hundred and seventy five \nyears. I do not think that should cha=\r\nnge for my grandchildren,&quot; the \nsamurai continued.\n\t&quot;So you guys have done =\r\nnothing but fight for the last couple \nhundred years?&quot; the sailor asked, co=\r\nnfused. &quot;Who do you fight?&quot;\n\t&quot;Rival daimyo used to fight,&quot; the samurai expl=\r\nained. &quot;Long \nago. But since the Tokugawa clan came out on top, there has b=\r\neen \npeace for over two hundred and fifty years.&quot;\n\t&quot;Daimyo?&quot; the sailor ask=\r\ned. &quot;I don&#39;t know what that means.&quot;\n\t&quot;They are the generals, the lords of t=\r\nhe land,&quot; the samurai \nexplained. &quot;We samurai would swear allegiance to the=\r\nm in battle.&quot;\n\t&quot;Well, if you haven&#39;t been fighting for so long, what have \n=\r\nyou been doing?&quot; the sailor wondered.\n\t&quot;We have been many things,&quot; the samu=\r\nrai said. &quot;Mostly we \nhave been keeping the peace. The Shogunate rewards us=\r\n for that.&quot;\n\t&quot;Shogunate? You mean your king?&quot; the sailor questioned.\n\t&quot;The =\r\nperson who runs our country is called Seii tai shogun, \nor just Shogun,&quot; th=\r\ne samurai replied. &quot;His government is called the \nShogunate, or the Bakufu.=\r\n&quot;\n\t&quot;Too many names,&quot; the sailor said, shaking his head. He \nglanced at the =\r\nswords tied to the samurai&#39;s waist. &quot;What about \nthose? Why do you still ha=\r\nve swords? And why two?&quot;\n\t&quot;This is called a daisho,&quot; the samurai said, reac=\r\nhing down \nand gripping the longer of the two swords. &quot;It is our right, our=\r\n \nduty to wear these swords. No one else may wear them.&quot;\n\t&quot;But don&#39;t you ha=\r\nve guns?&quot; the sailor continued. &quot;We stopped \nusing swords=85 I think before=\r\n we even made my country.&quot;\n\t&quot;We have guns,&quot; the samurai said. &quot;My sons and =\r\nI are good \nmarksmen. But our swords and spears are still useful.&quot;\n\t&quot;Spears=\r\n, too?&quot; the sailor gave him an inquisitive look. &quot;You \nguys are behind on t=\r\nhe times a little.&quot;\n\t&quot;We use swords as a symbol more than as a weapon,&quot; the=\r\n \nsamurai explained. &quot;They are our soul. Our guns are saved for the \nfields=\r\n, and the spears are good for cavalry.&quot;\n\t&quot;Ever seen a gun like this?&quot; the s=\r\nailor asked, reaching \nbehind him. However, he was interrupted as his inter=\r\npreter returned. \nThe man paid his respects to the samurai, then turned to =\r\nthe sailor.\n\t&quot;We must go,&quot; he said.\n\tThe sailor sighed, getting up and payi=\r\nng for the sake.\n\t&quot;Have the rest, if you like,&quot; he offered the samurai, \npu=\r\nshing the unused cup towards him.\n\t&quot;Wait,&quot; the samurai said, getting up. &quot;T=\r\nimes are about to \nchange, I know it.&quot; He took the short sword from his sid=\r\ne, handing \nit to the sailor. &quot;When you go back to America, to trade with u=\r\ns, \nkeep this. It will be our first trade.&quot;\n\tThe sailor blinked in surprise=\r\n at the short sword. &quot;This for \nsome bad wine? Well, I don&#39;t know anything =\r\nabout this thing, but I \ncan guess it&#39;s not a fair trade.&quot; He reached behin=\r\nd him, pulling out \na brand new level action pistol Smith and Wesson. &quot;Here=\r\n,&quot; he said, \nhanding it to the samurai. &quot;No offense to your swords and all =\r\nthat, \nbut I bet you&#39;ll find this more useful.&quot;\n\tThe samurai took it and lo=\r\noked it over. He bowed deeply. &quot;My \nname is Mono Kenshu, from Okinawa, in S=\r\natsuma.&quot;\n\tThe sailor gave an awkward return bow. &quot;I&#39;m Joe Lewis, from \nLoui=\r\nsiana,&quot; he said, turning and walking out with his interpreter.\n--\n\n\n\n"
