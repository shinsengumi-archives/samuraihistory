These are two m=\r\nanga that deal with the bakumatsu period. From\nthe Ebay description:\n\nThese=\r\n are two Japanese Bakumatsu era themed manga - &quot;Sono Toki Rekishi\nga Ugoita=\r\n - Bakumatsu Edition&quot;, which covers seven historical events\nfrom the Bakuma=\r\ntsu era of Japanese history, including the now\nlegendary Ikedaya Incident, =\r\nin which the Shinsengumi killed and\ncaptured Choshu loyalists at the Ikeday=\r\na inn, the assassination of\nSakamoto Ryoma, and &quot;The Last Battle of Hijikat=\r\na Toshizo&quot;. The &quot;Sono\nToki&quot; manga series is based on the NHK television ser=\r\nies of the same\nname which dramatically examines seminal moments in Japanes=\r\ne history\nfrom a purely historical perspective. This manga was published in=\r\n\n2003, and is 504 pages.\n\nThe Second manga is &quot;Hidamari no Ki&quot;, a fictional=\r\nized account of\nevents during the Bakumatsu period by Tezuka Osamu, with st=\r\nories about\nHenry Heusken, Townsend Harris, and other notable Bakumatsu era=\r\n\nfigures. This manga was published in 2002, and has 336 pages. There\nare so=\r\nme minor stains on the outside edge, but it is in good\ncondition. Both mang=\r\na have colorful dust jackets which are in good\ncondition, and are Japanese =\r\nimports.\n\n\nHere is the Ebay link to the auction:\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBa=\r\nyISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3D190123948646\n\nI will be selling off at least one=\r\n more Japanese history related batch\nafter this auction finishes. Help supp=\r\nort the Journal!\n\n\n"
