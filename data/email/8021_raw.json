Any other tips will be\ngreatful.\n                                   thanks again,\n                                    Mark\n\nClive Sinclaire &lt;CSinclaire@...&gt; wrote:\n  Mark\nTo clean a blade, first strip the blade of all fittings including the\nhabaki. The cleaning kit should contain a &quot;powder puffer&quot;, probably on a\nstick. This is called uchiko and is basically for removing oil. If the blade\nis heavilly coated, take a soft cloth or tissue and remove the excess by\nwiping, from the habaki area to the kissaki in one stroke. Do not make a\nbackwards and forwards type of motion. When most of the oil is off, tap out\nthe uichiko liberally onto the blade, including the mune or back edge. With\na fresh piece of cloth or paper (nugui-game may be supplied in your cleaning\nkit in which case it will need crumpling up to soften it) wipe from habaki\narea to kissaki, again using one stroke. Eventually this should remove all\nthe oil although several applications may be necessary. After studying the\nnow clean blade you may wish to re-oil the blade with the choji-abura that\nshould be supplied in the cleaning kit.\nAs the uichiko comes in many grades and qualities and is slightly abraisive,\nbe sure not to grip the blade too tightly when wiping it and always use the\nsingle stroke method to avoid unsightly scratches. Do not apply any paper or\ncloth that has touched the nakago to the rest of the blade as you may\nintroduce grit onto the polished surface. Never clean the nakago.\nI would emphasise that this is how to use a cleaning kit on a real Japanese\nsword. I have no knowledge of  Paul Chen swords but assume the same method\napplies.You should always clean the sword in this way after use in Iai-do as\ncontact with your hands will quickly rust if not cleaned. Of course, this\ndoes not apply to stainless steel blades.\nIt is a matter of personal taste as to whether a blade is kept permanently\noiled or dry. Personnely, in the UK where there is generally a moderate\nclimate I prefer to keep my swords dry although, I have started oiling them\nfor the summer months in recent years. I know that many derive great\npleasure from cleaning and oiling their swords in an almost ritualistic way.\nThe smell of the choji-abura (clove oil) is quite pleasant but avoid getting\ninto any open wounds, scratches etc as it may have an unpleasant reaction.\nI hope this is of some interest.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;mark kd&quot; &lt;depos42300@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, November 23, 2005 2:51 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new katana HELP PLEASE!!!!\n\n\n&gt; hello,\n&gt;      i just purchased a paul chen wind & thunder katana off ebay. it came\nnew in the box. when i opened it, the factory had heavily oiled it up plus\nthere are little woodchips from the Saya(scabbard) all over it. I shook the\nSaya out as much as possible but the blade is a whole different story. I\ndon&#39;t want to try to clean it untill i know what i&#39;m doing. It came with a\ncleaning kit but i don&#39;t know what is for what. anyone who has any knowledge\non basic sword cleaning kits and would like to give me a short explanation\nof how it all works please do so.\n&gt;                                        thanks a bundle,\n&gt;                                          mark\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;  Yahoo!
