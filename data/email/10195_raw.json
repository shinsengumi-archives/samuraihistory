Most wounds were deep cuts. Some were bullet wounds by the rif=\r\nles\n&gt; provided by the Portuguese. Not much was written about that as far as=\r\n I\n&gt; know. As for the dead bodies, they were burned to stop the spread of d=\r\nisease\n&gt; and as an act of respect for the fallen warriors. For those who we=\r\nre highly\n&gt; sought after, a reward for that certain Samurai&#39;s head was offe=\r\nred by the\n&gt; Diamyo of his enemy. It had to be a fresh kill. Decomposition =\r\nmade\n&gt; identifying the face difficult.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have studied the history of th=\r\ne Samurai not only because it is\n&gt; fascinating but because I am from Samura=\r\ni bloodlines. Specifically the\n&gt; Harubiyuna. Thier kamon is two arrow feath=\r\ners inside a circle. One pointing\n&gt; upwards, and one downwards. I find myse=\r\nlf both lucky and honored to be the\n&gt; descendant of Samurai. It&#39;s truly som=\r\nething to be proud of. Not for anything\n&gt; I have done but to be linked to s=\r\nuch a rich history as the Samurai. I am\n&gt; half American, half Japanese.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Good luck in your writing!
