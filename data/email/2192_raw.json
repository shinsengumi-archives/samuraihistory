If you&#39;re going to the trouble to make a\nmovie, how hard is it to get facts correct? It&#39;s not\nthe FICTION part that&#39;s painful--it&#39;s the details that\ncould EASILY be made correctly, but aren&#39;t.\n\n\n--- Sara Cooper &lt;saracooper22@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have a feeling I&#39;m about to be stoned for heresy,\n&gt; but despite all the \n&gt; historical inaccurasies can&#39;t you still enjoy the\n&gt; movie? I mean as a work of \n&gt; historical FICTION (you know, based on history but\n&gt; mostly made up).  Not \n&gt; that I won&#39;t be bugged by all the little things too.\n&gt;  I know I&#39;ll be sitting \n&gt; in the theater shaking my head muttering under my\n&gt; breath &quot;no, no, OH \n&gt; gimmeabreak! that could NEVER happen, where did they\n&gt; get this information?&quot;  \n&gt; Most movies have been like that for me since I\n&gt; became somewhat obsessed with \n&gt; Micheal Crichton books :)  Anyways, ya&#39;ll keep\n&gt; saying how you&#39;ll hate it but \n&gt; still see it.  It will hurt.  It won&#39;t kill me. I&#39;ll\n&gt; still go.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai?\n&gt; Good? Bad?\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 28 Aug 2003 15:50:13 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Agreed....I think it will be painful. Horribly\n&gt; Wrong.\n&gt; &gt;And that&#39;s on top of how I feel about Tom Cruise in\n&gt; &gt;general. It will be the pain of Shogun (the\n&gt; &gt;translations, the Edo-jidai uniform kimono, the\n&gt; &gt;silliness of the whole love story) on a much\n&gt; grander\n&gt; &gt;scale. It will hurt. It will kill me. And I will\n&gt; go.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Nate\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- &quot;Anthony J.

But what do\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guys think of it? Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you think it has the potential to be up there\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shogun and The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crapfest to make money\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I look at going to it much as I do going to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dentist. I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t like it. I\n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;ll hurt.
