Since the ashigaru class had \nessentially been abolished, basically becoming lower-&quot;ranking&quot; \nsamurai, there was no opportunity at all for advancement through \nmartial prowess.\n\nAt that stage, you were either born a samurai or you weren&#39;t, but \nI&#39;m sure there were exceptions. I&#39;m not sure what status Will Adams \nachieved, but if anyone has any examples of people promoted to \nsamurai status (and what they did to achieve it), I&#39;d be interested \nto hear.\n\nAdoption springs to mind - could an Edo period samurai adopt a non-\nsamurai? With all of the economic hardships that many families \nsuffered later in the period, it seems like adopting a rich \nmerchant&#39;s son might have been a good way out of debt - or, since \nmerchants were officially the lowest rung of society, was this a \nsocial no-no?\n\n\n"
