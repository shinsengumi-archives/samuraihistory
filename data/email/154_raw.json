Could\n&gt; a samurai warrior \n&gt; use firearms on the field of battle in any time in\n&gt; their history, \n&gt; without loss of honor? I know that armies of that\n&gt; used ashigaru en \n&gt; masse with these weapons , the issue for me is if\n&gt; the warriors \n&gt; themselves would use them under certain conditions\n&gt; at all.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
