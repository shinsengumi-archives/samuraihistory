Were the surnames passed\n&gt; down to their\n&gt; children automatically, or did their children still\n&gt; require to be\n&gt; awarded the name by the Emperor?\n\nThey weren&#39;t *honorary* surnames. The Minamoto family\nwas descended from a son of the Emperor Suwa who took\nthe name &quot;Minamoto&quot;. Hence them also being referred to\nas the &quot;Suwa Genji&quot;, Genji being how you read the\ncharacters for &quot;Minamoto family&quot;.  \n\nThe Taira clan was descended from a grandson of\nEmperor Kammu, who took the name. &quot;Taira&quot; can also be\nread &quot;Hei&quot;, and you often see them referred to as the\n&quot;Heike&quot; (Taira House) or the &quot;Heishi&quot; (Taira Family).\nThe most influential branch of the Taira originated in\nIse, so you see them referred to as the Ise Heike\noften. \n\nBottom line, the Emperor didn&#39;t just go out and say\n&quot;Poof, you&#39;re now a Minamoto&quot; or &quot;Shazzam, you&#39;re now\na Taira&quot;. You weren&#39;t given these names like titles,\nfor a &quot;job well done&quot;. These were hereditary family\nnames--you simply didn&#39;t just &quot;become&quot; a Minamoto or a\nTaira. Same with the Fujiwara--Toyotomi Hideyoshi had\nto arrange to be adopted by a Fujiwara nobleman, to\ngive legitimacy to his title of Kampaku. Tokugawa\nIeyasu had several family tree charts drawn up to\nsupport claims of descent from either the Minamoto,\nTaira, or Fujiwara, as the situation\ndictated--everyone is taught that the Tokugawa were\ndescended from the Minamoto because that was state\northodoxy for 200 years, to legitamize the Tokugawa\nbakufu. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
