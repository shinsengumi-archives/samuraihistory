Anybody with more than a cursory knowledge of the field knows \nthat th=\r\ne Tokugawa at no time &quot;banned&quot; guns any more than they banned other \nweapon=\r\ns, and as Kitsuno said extensive armories were kept all around Japan for \nt=\r\nhe purposes of maintaining defense stockpiles. Efforts were made at procuri=\r\nng \nnew weapons, but as Japan was without external threat until the 1800&#39;s,=\r\n there \nreally wasn&#39;t any reason to pursue it with vigor. People who think =\r\nJapan \n&quot;abandoned&quot; guns need to stop watching Tom Cruise movies. Noel Perri=\r\nn was a \nliterature professor with no knowledge of Japanese or Japanese his=\r\ntory, writing \nwhat he wanted in order to bolster an argument for gun contr=\r\nol in the US. \nJapanese historians thought his work was a joke--I mean, the=\r\ny literally thought \nit was an attempt at humor. It shows just how stupid p=\r\neople can be that his work \n\nhas had the unfortunate negative influence it =\r\nhas had in creating this idealized \n\nyet completely incorrect image of Japa=\r\nn, and personally he should have been shot \n\nwith a replica tanegashima and=\r\n all copies of his books burned as an affront to \nscholarship. \n\n__________=\r\n______________________\nFrom: kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...=\r\nm&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sat, July 30, 2011 2:14:37 PM\nS=\r\nubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Japanese and American relations after Admiral =\r\n\nPerry landed in Japan in 1854.\n\nThere was definitely not any sort of &quot;Baku=\r\nfu renunciation of firearms&quot;.  That&#39;s \na myth that we tackled in a prior po=\r\ndcast in fact:\n\nhttp://samuraiarchives.podbean.com/2011/05/29/ep05-the-myth=\r\n-of-samurai-giving-up-the-gun/\n\n\nMost han had gunnery instructors, villages=\r\n were licensed to use firearms to \nscare off or kill threatening animals, a=\r\nnd guns were a necessity in various \nlocations due to intrusions from Russi=\r\nans in the far North and defense of ports \nin the South.  To put it simply =\r\n- there were no active wars, so technological \nadvancement of guns in Japan=\r\n wasn&#39;t necessary, but guns weren&#39;t thrown away. \nThe book &quot;Giving Up the G=\r\nun&quot; by Perrin is a joke, and has been ridiculed and \nlambasted in the Weste=\r\nrn and Japanese scholarship for decades, but his book is \nstill around beca=\r\nuse non-Japanese history experts still quote it.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Robert McArthur&quot; &lt;rmcarthur@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Go here for info=\r\n on a Japanese flintlock musket circa 1650, recently sold at\n&gt; auction:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; http://www.proxibid.com/asp/LotDetail.asp?ahid=3D1923\n&gt; &lt;http://www.proxi=\r\nbid.com/asp/LotDetail.asp?ahid=3D1923&aid=3D10979&lid=3D2938009&gt;\n&gt; &aid=3D1=\r\n0979&lid=3D2938009\n&gt; \n&gt; Given the Tokugawa Bakufu&#39;s renunciation of firearm=\r\ns, my guess is that\n&gt; Flintlocks of any kind were more on the order of a cu=\r\nriosity here or a\n&gt; presentation piece there, than an attempt to acquire st=\r\nocks of these weapons\n&gt; or to advance the science of firearms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robert\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____ \n&gt; \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n =\r\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
