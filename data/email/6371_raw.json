(I cite Yoshitsune&#39;s name\nwith trepidation; I&#39;m not 100% sure I&#39;ve identified him right, which is a\ntrifle embarrassing when I&#39;m sitting right under a print of him training\nwith the Tengu.)  What I recall of the two-book novel matches reasonably\nwell with what I&#39;ve read of the Taira-Minamoto wars since then, but it was\nmy first exposure to the period, so I make no promises.\nShea is generally focussed on what one might call the &#39;underside of\nhistory&#39; - secret societies, etc. (he was the better-informed co-author of\nthe _Illuminastus!_ satire back in the&#39;70s).   I have my reservations, for\nexample, regarding his order of Zinja monks... he relates them to a\nCh&#39;in-cha sect in China.  Does anybody better-informed than I am happen to\nrecall these books, and have any views on their historical value?  Might be\none for your list, Thomas, and on the other hand, it might be one to teach\nme the limitations of my knowledge.  Either one&#39;s good.\n        Gereg\n   Date: Fri, 17 Dec 2004 18:36:34 -0000\n   From: &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot; &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt;\nSubject: Lists, lists\n\n\nI have posted 2 lists in the files section -\n\nOne is of films, the other is of &#39;samurai fiction&#39; - set in the\n&#39;samurai era&#39; by which I mean I have not bothered with\nLustbader&#39;s Ninja, or such like - nor with stuff like Hayes&#39;\n&#39;Wisdom from the Ninja Village&#39; lest I incur the wrath of\nP Richardson of this list - I&#39;ve met him and he&#39;s a big bloke!\n\nIn both I have avoided anime/manga stuff, cos I don&#39;t know\nanything about it!\n\nEmail me any additions/comments, and I&#39;ll update.\n\nIf we should do a list of factual/reference books, which will be\nquite lengthy, i think, let me know.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n"
