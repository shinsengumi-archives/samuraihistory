I think of it as a &#39;time machine&#39;\nwith which I can go to my favourite era in Japanese\nhistory: The Sengoku Jiddai (The Era of Warring\nStates).\n   I fell in love with it the first time I saw the\nscreen shots in a magazine and many tales of glorious\nbattles from a few of my fellow Daimyo at school. Too\nbad you just can&#39;t simulate a battle as EPIC as the\nBattle of Sekigahara or the Battle of Dan no Ura.\nAlthough that would be cool...\n   In reply to the comment on using Sun Tzu&#39;s Art of\nWar during the game, I agree that using the &quot;Holy\nTome&quot; is very useful. Note that in the modern day,\nChinese and Japanese businessmen has used the Art of\nWar for business strategy. Too bad you can&#39;t use it\nfor &quot;conquering&quot; your friends... (&quot;Bow to me, slave!&quot;)\n   Try using other books based on East Asian warfare,\nespescially ones written by Dr. Stephen Turnbull.\n   Oh, one final thing. If Sun Tzu was a Japanese\ndaimyo during the Sengoku Jiddai, the war would&#39;ve\nended much sooner than we know it now. He&#39;d probably\nexploit the uses of Ninjas, Shinobi and Arquebuses\nmore than the other daimyo would!!\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
