Convenient too! What\n&gt; &gt; about naginata - did\n&gt; &gt; they largely disappear amongst retainers and\n&gt; &gt; ashigaru after the Gempei\n&gt; &gt; Wars, to be replaced by yari?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure when the naginata was replaced--I&#39;d have to\n&gt; check with Bottomley. I&#39;d think it was a fairly good\n&gt; weapon in the street fighting of the Onin. Perhaps it\n&gt; was replaced when the fighting moved out to the\n&gt; provinces and took place more often on horseback?\n&gt; anyone?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Take Yahoo!
