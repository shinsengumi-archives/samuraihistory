When in fact, most Japan=\r\nese ronin \nwere mostly interested in connecting with a clan. And they saw \n=\r\nthemselves as being apart from and superior to the farmers.&quot;\n\nJim wrote &quot;Si=\r\nnce I&#39;m actually not sure of Kurosawa&#39;s source for the \nplot for this one, =\r\nI won&#39;t make any definitive statements.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s been my understanding that K=\r\nurosawa did not have a direct source \nfor Seven Samurai. One of the reasons=\r\n for the success of the film was \nthat it took the novel approach of having=\r\n farmers hiring and being \nprotected by samurai, which was unheard of in Ja=\r\npanese cinema and \nliterature at the time. While Nina wrote that &quot;...SEVEN =\r\nSAMURAI come \nfrom Japanese mythology of the noble ronin who helps peasants=\r\n.&quot;, \nthere was not any sort of tradition or mythology in literature or \ncin=\r\nema that I am aware of to that point-Seven Samurai was the first \nof its ty=\r\npe (although there likely is some example of it, \nsomewhere...just not one =\r\nI&#39;ve encountered). Up to then, the plots \nwould be &#39;ronin helps himself out=\r\n&#39;, &#39;samurai helps himself \nout&#39;, &#39;samurai helps out other samurai&#39;, &#39;ronin =\r\nor samurai screws \nover peasants/townspeople while helping themselves out&#39;,=\r\n etc. The \nchanging face of relative status in post-war Japan helped Seven =\r\n\nSamurai introduce the &#39;noble samurai/ronin who helped the downtrodden \nmas=\r\nses&#39; genre to Japan.\n\n\n\n\n"
