The \nfifth \n&gt; Tokugawa Shogun. \n\nHave been waiting to see if anyone else would answer this as I also find \nTsunayoshi a fascinating character and would like to know more about \nhim. Marius Jansen writes a bit about him in The Making of Modern \nJapan (Harvard UP 2002) &quot;in this case, birth from a plebeian (but highly \nintelligent and famously beautiful) mother and an independent \nupbringing that was not geared for heading the bakufu produced a \nstrong-willed and intelligent, albeit idiosyncratic, shogun.&quot;\n\nJansen&#39;s sources are: Donald Shively &quot;Tokugawa Tsuyanoshi, the \nGenroku Shogun&#39; in Craig and Shively &quot;Personality in Japanese History \nand\nBeatrice Bodart-Bailey &quot;The Laws of Compassion&quot; in Mon Nip 40/2\n\nJansen is very good, in the same book, on the Genroku period, and has \nsome information on the Shoheiko Academy, the bakufu school, \nthough he does not indicate that this was founded by Tsunayoshi.\n\nI guess for insights into contemporary culture the plays of Chikamatsu \nwould be invaluable. Donald Shively has written on this too.\n\nThere is also a very good book called Edo Culture by Nishiyama \nMatsunosuke (U of Hawaii Press 1997). It has all sorts of interesting \ninformation on food, cooking, travel, theatre and music, and so on. Not \nmany references to Tsunayoshi but one of them tells of the Kashima \nOracle&#39;s denunciation of the dog kennels and bad policies of the Dog \nShogun.\n\nThere must be lots of Japanese biographies of him - maybe even a \ntaiga :)\n\nplease post any other information that you&#39;ve discovered.\n\nThanks,\n\nGillian\n\n"
