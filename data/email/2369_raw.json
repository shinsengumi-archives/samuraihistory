I live in Sorong, west-papua. I am \ninterested in samurai and their history. I am a beginner about \nsamurai swords. \nI have a question about samurai. First of all, is every samurai sword \nhas a number on the sword?\nWhat is the meaning of this numbers? \nThe samurai my friend told me have two numbers, first 1356 and the \nsecond numbers is 510023 are these numbers mean something?\nThe samurai I talk about was found in a cave, in north sulawesi, are \nthere a specific history event take place in there? Suppose 1356 is \nthe year when the samurai was forged.\nThanks anyway for those who willing to share their knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
