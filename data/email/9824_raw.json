This group is probably not the proper place for is. That being said though I have to mention some of the faluts in the arguement presented agasint Zen as a religion. There are teachings. A follower of religious Zen takes part in such rituals as the Boddhisatva vow and seeking refuge in the three jewels. There are books. Just to list a few: Shobogenzo, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, Perfection of Wisdom is also used sometimes, some times even the Lotus Sutra. I will ignore the argument about gods because that is complex and I want to keep this short, other than saying you are correct that generally gods are not represented. If you have the 27 years of experience you claim to have, I would think you would have heard of at least a few books written by Chinese and Japanese Zen masters. Such masters also do write about past and future lifetimes and karma and duhka and samsara and many other core Buddhist concepts. One thing Zen strongly rejects that is often common in Chinese/Japanese Buddhism is the comcept of mappo.  \n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLiity nyt uuteen Windows Live Messenger perheeseen\nhttp://get.live.com\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
