As a \nmatter of fact, each party tried to do whatever possi=\r\nble for its own \nconvenience.\n\nConsidering the convulsion of the period, an=\r\nd the fact that there is no \naccepted theory on KK-MM institutional history=\r\n, I would stay away from \nit. Tokugawa period seems much more approachable,=\r\n because of the \nConfucian ideology layer, and the police-state that manage=\r\nd more or \nless to control people at least fro two centuries.\n\ncepo\n\n"
