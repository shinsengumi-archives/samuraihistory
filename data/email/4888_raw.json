An excellent read and res=\r\nource \nif you can find it.\n\n&gt;  If he had a serious body of artwork,\n&gt;  I&#39;d =\r\nbe very interested to get a closer look at it.\n\nThere were exhibitions of h=\r\nis art and swords and writings.( small \nmunicipal museums) I have seen the =\r\ncatalogs in old book shops,  but \nnever bought one. Being from thirty years=\r\n or so ago, the photos were \nall black and white(and there weren&#39;t many swo=\r\nrds).\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  Now Harris gives a capsule biography of Musashi which is (I bel=\r\nieve) \n&gt; about\n&gt;  all we really know about him.=A0 Yet Yoshikawa&#39;s melodram=\r\na of his life \n&gt; (and\n&gt;  the Inagaki film adaptation), expand on that to so=\r\n vast a degree that \n&gt; I\n&gt;  wonder to what extent they represent the noveli=\r\nst&#39;s fancy, and to what\n&gt;  extent they represent legitimate folk tradition.=\r\n=A0 For example, I \n&gt; understand\n&gt;  that the tale of his meeting with the j=\r\no stylist - whose name escapes \n&gt; me at\n&gt;  the moment - is actual tradition=\r\n:=A0 but is it history?=A0 And am I even \n&gt; correct\n&gt;  in my understanding =\r\nthat it&#39;s actual tradition?\n&gt;  This list is the first place I&#39;ve come acros=\r\ns a group of people \n&gt; sufficiently\n&gt;  informed that I thought I might find=\r\n some answers I could trust on the\n&gt;  subject.=A0 Thank you all for your at=\r\ntention.\n&gt;  =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Gereg\n\n\tmy understanding is that nearly everyth=\r\ning we know about him comes \nfrom the little he reveals in his writing and =\r\nfrom the biography \nwritten well after his death by his students. It has to=\r\n be considered \ncarefully as it would have been written to promote the trad=\r\nition he \nfounded.
