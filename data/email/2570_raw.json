The only really available book is  \nJohn M.  Yumoto,  The Japanese Sword:  A Handbook, Tuttle,  1958,  which has \nundergone many reprintings.  Unfortunately,  Yumoto&#39;s  book is very \nshort---191 pages.  His terminology is obscure.  The only explicit mention of  tachi is \nin the Glossary on page 184:  well at least he got it in somewhere,  right?   \nQuote is &quot;a tachi  [is]  an ancient slung sword housed in a jindachi \nmounting.&quot;  Now that is like saying Julius Caesar lived in Rome, nothing else!  If you \ndelve into the text [!],  you find mention of the Koto [Old Sword]  period on \npage 27;  Yumoto says the period lasted from 900 to 1530 [AD].  On page 28,  \n&quot;swords which had a cutting edge of four feet or more were often employed.&quot;  I \nassume that,  based on what Tom Helm has written, this is our friend Mr. \nTachi-san.  On page 47-8,  Yumoto writes: &quot;in this period the sword was worn \nsuspended from the hip by cords which passed through two rings on the scabbard \n(Plates 7 and 8).  The best part of The Japanese Sword is the extensive number of \nplates.  The prettiest of the illustrations are those of the tsuba, the \nelegantly wrought hand guards that adorned the swords.  That reminds me of the pal \nwho used to play the tsuba in my high school band--he didn&#39;t get much music out \nof it, but it was pretty to look at.   As My Ichiban, My Significant Other \n[SO],  would proclaim now,  &quot;self slap!&quot;  And I would deserve it,  too,  Ollie.  \nLater and greater,  Prof.  Murphy,  The Japan Foundation\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
