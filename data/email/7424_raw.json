I have several \ntimes visited a temple where, presumably, the 47 Samurai are buried. I \njust today watched on the history channel a feature on Samurai, and \nthey showed a videeo tape of the temple. The one I visited is just \naround the cornert from the Takanawa Prince hotel. Yet, I have read \nthat the temple is in an entirely different location.\n\nI hope someone can straighten us out.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;andre_guelmann&quot; &lt;andre@g...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Reading about the 47 Ronin story, I came about Sengaku-ji Temple and\n&gt; Kagaku-ji Temple..are these different temples?!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
