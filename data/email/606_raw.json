For example Imagawa Yoshimoto was a mamas boy and\nhis mother practically ran his domain. The Visual Nihon Rekishi Series put\nout by DeAogustini or the similiar Nihonshi by Kodansha or the the Sengoku\nChronicle give an almost month by month chronicle of the period. I do see\nthe arguement that such works wouldn&#39;t sell, but even a tenth of this would\nbe nice.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Anthony J.

Bryant&#39;s books\n\n\n&gt; William Letham wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes you raise some good points. Basically I&#39;m not a historian just a guy\nwho\n&gt; &gt; loves reading history so the type of history books I would prefer to\nread\n&gt; &gt; are &#39;popular&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the trouble is, there&#39;s a *perception* of academic vs. popular.\nMost\n&gt; academic books are no more difficult to read, they just tend to have a\ntighter\n&gt; focus on a specific topic or issue. One is free to ignore the seriously\n&gt; academic trappings (usually found in the footnotes, which publishers,\nfearful\n&gt; of the book being deemed &quot;too academic,&quot; tend to hide in the back of the\nbook\n&gt; and make reading it by academics difficult due to the constant flipping\nback\n&gt; and forth) and just read the book. I don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s read\n&quot;Heavenly\n&gt; Warriors&quot; or &quot;Hired Swords&quot; -- two of the best texts on the development of\nthe\n&gt; early warrior culture -- who hasn&#39;t come away with a deeper understanding\nof\n&gt; the material and where samurai came from and how they developed. Though\n&gt; universities use these in upper-level courses in J. history, they are\nextremely\n&gt; accessible.\n&gt;\n&gt; The same goes for &quot;Gates of Power&quot; and any number of other books. If one\nis\n&gt; interested in a specific area, one should be willing to at least take a\nlook at\n&gt; the books before dismissing them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I guess trained historians are interested in such academic\n&gt; &gt; books, but I&#39;m just looking for a good story.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you consider a good story? &quot;Hired Swords&quot; is full of interesting\n&gt; anecdotes about the evil taxman and how they behaved (I enjoy the quoted\nletter\n&gt; of complaint that talks about how they ride their horses right into\npeople&#39;s\n&gt; houses... &lt;G&gt;).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So in reply to Mr. Byants\n&gt; &gt; comment that people don&#39;t delve farther into the feild my feeling is\nthose\n&gt; &gt; books arn&#39;t very interesting to an amatuer historian.\n&gt;\n&gt; No book is interesting unless you crack the cover and take a look inside.\nI\n&gt; have been pleasantly surprised on more than one occasion by a book which,\neven\n&gt; though in my field, I was sure would bore me to tears. There are cases\nwhen I\n&gt; was right and was bored, but I&#39;m happy to say the ratio is in favor of\ngood.\n&gt; &lt;G&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for Massie, James\n&gt; &gt; Mcpherson who wrote the Civil War history &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; said\nthat\n&gt; &gt; there was proffesional envy that his book sold well. Maybe this is the\ncase\n&gt; &gt; with Massie (maybe not).\n&gt;\n&gt; This happens. In fact, I&#39;ve encountered a bit of... well, difficulty... in\nsome\n&gt; areas because of my Osprey books. While they&#39;re nothing I&#39;m ashamed of\n&gt; (although I really want to redo some of them!), there is a certain\nperception\n&gt; in some areas that I&#39;m not willing to do &quot;academic&quot; work. I&#39;m currently\ntrying\n&gt; to disabuse people of these efforts with translations of 14th. century\nJapanese\n&gt; literature and records.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In any event I&#39;m not that interested in what the\n&gt; &gt; AHA thinks about an author, I liked his books and will read him again.\nAs\n&gt; &gt; for Ambrose well I live in Japan (for some 8 years) so I haven&#39;t seen\n&gt; &gt; anything about his case. If true its sad because he is a good writer. So\n&gt; &gt; what I want to say is that I wish there were more popoular histories\nwritten\n&gt; &gt; about Japan. Imagine if someone wrote a book on the Meiji Restoration\nthe\n&gt; &gt; way Simon Schama wrote about the French Revolution, or a biography of\nOda\n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga on the scale of Massies Peter the Great.  Wishful thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt; The trouble is, there&#39;s not much of a market in English on such exotic\nfellows\n&gt; who most people have never heard of; we generally have to aim for the\nmarkets\n&gt; that exist (academia), small though they be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
