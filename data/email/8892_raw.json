Normally when swords are &quot;at rest&quot; on a\n&gt;katana-kake they would be placed with the omote (front) side of the blade\n&gt;facing out, this means the kurikata is visible. Were it to be placed the\n&gt;other way, ie easier to pick up as you describe, it would indicate a state\n&gt;of high alert.\n&gt;Also interesting are the various positions in which a katana is placed on\n&gt;the floor at one&#39;s side when  kneeling in front of another.\n&gt;You mention tachi, which are slightly different. A tachi, if on an ordinary\n&gt;katana-kake is place with the cutting edge downwards so that it also\n&gt;simulates the position when worn. More often and more correctly, a tachi is\n&gt;placed on a different type of rack so that it can stand vertically, with \n&gt;the\n&gt;tsuka (handle) resting in a small indentation on the base. It is incorrect\n&gt;as is often seen, for the tsuka to be at the top when placed on a proper\n&gt;tachi stand.\n&gt;Regards\n&gt;Clive\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Dean Wayland&quot; &lt;dean@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Friday, June 16, 2006 2:59 PM\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] SWORD SETS\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Clive,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A daisho on a katana-kake is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    normally\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    with the katana on the top and the wakizashi at the bottom, to make\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    easier to pick up the katana in an emergency, in those days when\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    these\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    things mattered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Was there any customary significance to the weapons orientation when\n&gt; &gt; displayed on a kake? I was under the impression that the tsuka was\n&gt; &gt; placed at the left, so as to be seen in the same orientation as when\n&gt; &gt; worn?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It occurred to me that if a katana/tachi were mounted the other way\n&gt; &gt; around, it could again in an emergency be more easily taken up with the\n&gt; &gt; left hand while being drawn with the right, or is this just being\n&gt; &gt; fanciful?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yours\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dean\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt; &gt; http://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
