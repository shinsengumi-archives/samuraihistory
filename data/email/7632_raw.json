I am on aol-seems that they do \nnot \n&gt; \n&gt;  take ano of the previous message with them.  In the future I will try to \n&gt; show \n&gt;  who&#39;s post I am referring to.\n\nWhen I&#39;m at home, I have AOL; they actually make this quite easy. What you \nhave to do is highlight the part of the message you want to be copied for you to \nreply to. then you hit the &quot;reply&quot; button and you&#39;ll get a format like this \nabove.\n\nIt&#39;s the folks using Outlook -- such as what I use at work -- where I have to \nbe careful about &quot;topping&quot; posts. Because Outlook automatically puts the post \nthat you are responding to at the bottom. And they include the entire post as \na default. And thus you have to back into it and delete the parts that are \nirrelevant to your response. \n\nAlso, I&#39;m going to have to investigate a way in Outlook to put the post on \nthe top and put my response below it. Didn&#39;t know that this was an issue in \nitself, but if it is, I can deal with it; it can be done with cut-and-paste.\n\nHope this helps, Nina\n\n"
