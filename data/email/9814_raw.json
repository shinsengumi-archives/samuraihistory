I knew t=\r\nhat the dailect was very old and has \nchanged in meaning or is forgotten. A=\r\nlso people said that it could \nbe Chinese. I have a answer to your question=\r\n (probaly with some \nembelishment) about the pull strength. It was problay =\r\nabout 20 \npounds stronger than when the yumi was refined and made with the =\r\nsame \ncare as a sword i.e weight and balance to the person and the like. \nB=\r\nut &quot;history&quot; shows of a samurai named Minamoto no Tametomo. He was \na very =\r\nlarge and powerful man. They said that He ultimately provoked \nthe central =\r\ngovernment into sending an armada of twenty small \nwarships in an attempt t=\r\no force him to pay. As a gesture of \ndefience, Tametomo decided to shoot a =\r\nlarge, bulbed arrow over the \nbow of one of the ships, but it struck the wo=\r\noden hull a few inches \nabove the waterline instead. The shot was so powerf=\r\nul that the arrow \npenetrated both sides of the vessel, creating two gaping=\r\n holes. Sea \nwater poured in and the ship began to sink. The sight of the w=\r\narship \nbeing sunk by a single arrow so frightened the other ships&#39; captain=\r\ns \nthat they retreated. That was what Japanese history said anyway. \nAgain =\r\nthank you for helping me.
