The scenery and \nthe acting are incredibly beautiful, from Kitano&#39;s roughened old Bushi \nthrough to the final Sakura (cherry blossom) and the way that it is lit for \nthe final scenes...\n The question that I have is wether anyone out there has heard of any release \ndates for the film on (region 2-PAL, UK playable) DVD yet? I am aware that it \nhas been offered already on Amazon etc. but have not heard anything about \nit&#39;s UK release dates....Till then.\n Abayo....Ben Sharples.\n\n"
