Perhaps the admin(s) of this list should\n&gt; consider splitting Samurai\n&gt; History up into two lists, one more pop culture\n&gt; oriented and another more\n&gt; history oriented. That way, the elitist historian\n&gt; types are less likely to\n&gt; be faced with questions that make them roll their\n&gt; eyes and act so rudely.\n\nI believe the idea has been considered. Problem is,\nsome people don&#39;t know the difference between history\nand pop-culture. \n\nI think most of us don&#39;t particularly care if someone\nhas a legitimate question. It&#39;s that too many times\nwe&#39;ve seen a legitimate answer get the response &quot;but\nthat&#39;s not true--my sensei told me so&quot; or &quot;but I saw\nit on Rurouni Kenshin&quot; or something. Nothing against\nthose who practice martial arts or watch anime, but\ncome on, people, if you don&#39;t like the answers you\nget, do a little research yourself. Books aren&#39;t that\nscary, trust me. (Well, okay, maybe Totman&#39;s &quot;The\nCollapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu&quot;...I&#39;ll admit I\ncouldn&#39;t take it anymore after renewing it 3 times at\nthe library...I had to stop...I&#39;ll go slit my stomach\nnow). \n\n&gt; After all, it seems they&#39;ve pretty much given up on\n&gt; trying to educate people\n&gt; by correcting their mistakes... so why not just\n&gt; seperate the historians from\n&gt; the casual fans?\n\nThe give-up is because too many of those people either\na. don&#39;t want correction, only validation or b. don&#39;t\nrealize that the people they are talking to really\nKNOW what they are talking about. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m\nan expert, by any means--I&#39;m always open to\ncorrection. But when you&#39;ve got Tony, Evalerio, Will\nLetham, Kitsuno, Carlo/Tsubame, who are all experts in\nsome area, and someone still persists in telling them\nthey don&#39;t know what they are talking about, because\nthey read it online somewhere else, it&#39;s very\nfrustrating.\n\nI applaud your optimism and your response...I really\ndo agree with it. But it&#39;d be easier if we weren&#39;t\nbesieged almost daily with someone who either still\nthinks the Japanese walk around with swords and that\nninjas exist, or someone who wants to be one, or\nthinks that anime is a legitimate historical source,\nor...one of a hundred different things. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
