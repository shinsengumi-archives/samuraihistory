I am sure several of you have an opinion on this topic, and I wanted your input. It is said that Sen no Rikyu committed sokotsu-shi after a command from Hideyoshi. I believe that Hideyoshi lost his temper and later regretted having ordered this, but that is irrelevant perhaps. What I want to know is what the exact reason was for ordering Sen no Ryku&#39;s suicide. I read somewhere that Sen no Rikyu refused to offer his daughter as a concubine, but that seems to be a few years earlier. Was there one event, or was this just a build-up of tention after this incident?\n\nJonathan P. Ellgen\n\n \n---------------------------------\nAccess over 1 million songs - Yahoo!
