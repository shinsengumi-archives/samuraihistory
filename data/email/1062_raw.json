It was in Japanese but included English subtitles.  \nThe battle scenes of the Satsuma Rebellion were quite good.\n\nA book was published (in Japanese) on the series.  It contained a couple of \npages of color uniforms on the Satsuma Rebellion.  I was lucky enough to get \nsomeone at UC Berkeley to translate the pages for me.\n\nI&#39;ve never heard of Takaharazaka.  I will look into it the next time I am in \nJapantown in San Francisco.  Perhaps I can find a version with English \nsubtitles.\n\nThanks for the information.\n\nBob Burke\n\n\n\nIn a message dated 8/11/02 7:44:25 AM, mickey.letham@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; There are two miniseries about the life of Saigo Takamori that includes the\nSatsuma rebellion.\n\nTakaharazaka starring Satomi Kotaro originally aired in 1987. Its about 5hrs\nlong.\nTobu ga Gotoku starring Nishida Toshiyuki was 1990s Taiga drama offering, a\nfifty part maxiseries.\n\nBoth of these are available on video but I assume only here in Japan and\nonly in Japanese. the Tobu ga Gotoku was shortened to about 7 hours for the\nvideotape. &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
