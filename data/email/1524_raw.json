Of course one must study Shinto \n&gt; and Confucius as well.\n\nTo be honest, I doubt Confucius had that much effect on our culture(Samurai in Edo shogunate could be an exception, or could not be).\n\n# One more to mention is, the images of &quot;Samurai&quot; for westerners and that for Japanese is quite different, I think. That&#39;s really interesting, humm......\n\nShinto might be a background, but how could it be distinguished from Animizm ?\nOr should them be treated as same?\n\n# National-Shinto by Imperial Japan was something different, I think.\n\n M.Nakazaki\n\n"
