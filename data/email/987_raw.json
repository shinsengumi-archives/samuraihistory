Would the colour of the sashimono for his samurai and \nashigaru generally be the colour of the lord&#39;s banner? Ex. For Takeda \nwho had a red banner with black symbol, would his followers have the \nTaekda black lozenge on a red background?\n\nWho else would have a Takeda lozenge mon? Any direct family member \nbut with a background colour as per the lord&#39;s banner? I have a print \nof a Takeda army crossing a river with Shingen&#39;s men having white \nbackround on their mon with a red symbol. Also present are men in \nanother area that have a white background with a black lozenge. Are \nthese men from a different Takeda general????????\n\nWould the mon of Takeda&#39;s 24 generals ashigaru and samurai be a \nTakeda mon or something similar to the specific general&#39;s mon?\n\n\n\n"
