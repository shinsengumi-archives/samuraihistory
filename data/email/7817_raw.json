Whilst I am no expert on japanese history nor do i claim to be, I am always amazed by so called modern day samurai, it was simply a class, anyone today claiming to be samurai maybe if japanese from a samurai background, but they are not samurai, and all the japanese that i am friends with whom claim samurai heritage , do not call themselve&#39;s samurai, in fact the samurai class being disbanded was probably one of the biggest steps in japanese history to modernise the nation.\n \nSorry for grammatical error&#39;s it&#39;s very late...\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \n\nSamurai Japan Japan airline \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
