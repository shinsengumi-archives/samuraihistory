In other\n&gt; words,\n&gt; &gt; what percentage of=\r\n the forces, if any, were mounted samurai, samurai\n&gt; on foot\n&gt; &gt; and the di=\r\nfferent types of ashigaru (and their weapons: bow, spear,\n&gt; swords, or\n&gt; &gt; =\r\narquebus).\n&gt; \n&gt; Others might have better overall statistics, but the Shimaz=\r\nu listed the\n&gt; following for 1591:\n&gt; \n&gt; 300 yari (200 of which are long yar=\r\ni), 200 hand-spears (not sure what\n&gt; constitutes a hand-spear), 1,500 guns,=\r\n 1,500 bows. That only describes a\n&gt; force of 3,500, but perhaps might be t=\r\nypical, meaning 43% guns, 43%\n&gt; bows, 14% yari. Swords would not have been =\r\nprimary weapons and would be\n&gt; a personal weapon not counted in these regis=\r\nters.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for mounted men vs foot soldiers, from 1597 the Shimazu liste=\r\nd the\n&gt; following (I&#39;m excluding labourers from this list):\n&gt; \n&gt; 262 mounte=\r\nd men, with 5068 personal followers on foot. 800 other foot\n&gt; soldiers (lan=\r\ndless men, muashi, and squires, kaji ko-sho), and 665\n&gt; weapon bearers. If =\r\nwe exclude weapon bearers (or dogu, who may or may\n&gt; not have actually foug=\r\nht in battle, I&#39;m not sure), then that&#39;s 4%\n&gt; mounted samurai with 96% foot=\r\n soldiers.\n&gt; \n&gt; -AngusH\n&gt; \n&gt; ____________ ________ ________ ________ ______=\r\n__ ________\n&gt; \n&gt; This email, including any attachments, may be confidential=\r\n or privileged, \n&gt; and is sent for the personal attention of the intended r=\r\necipient.
