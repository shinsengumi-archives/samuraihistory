I finally got myself a copy of the &#39;Koyo \nGunkan&#39; - I have the book &#39;legends of the Samurai&#39;, and I found it in \nthe bibliography and ordered it off Amazon.co.jp (Koyo Gunkan, Edited \nand translated into modern Japanese by Yukata Yoshida).  It has both \nthe original text and the modern japanese &#39;translation&#39;.  I can&#39;t \nhope to read the original text, but the &#39;modern&#39; japanese version \nsays: &quot;Ato de kikeba, kono Musha koso Terutora de atta to iu.&quot;  That \ndoesn&#39;t sound too convincing to me.  Here is a translation I did from \nanother book, &quot;Sengoku Bushou Omoshiro Jiten&quot;, Naramoto Tatsuya, 1998:\n\n&quot;This is the same famous scene from books and movies; The warrior in \nthe white cowl is Kenshin, and Shingen&#39;s warfan bore eight sword \ncuts.  However, there are historical records that have been \ndiscovered that dispute this personal combat.  It is the &#39;Kenshin \nNenpu&#39; (Kenshin Chronological Record), which states Arakawa Izu no \nKami rides at Shingen, shingen cant draw his sword and instead blocks \nwith his fan, and Hara Oosumi no Kami steps forward with a spear and \nstrikes at the rider, missing him but hitting the horse, startling \nit.  The rider fled&quot;\n\nIt goes on to say:\n\n&quot;In short, it is thought that the man that Shingen fought at \nKawanakajima was Kenshin&#39;s kagemusha, Arakawa Izu no Kami.  Also, \naccording to the &quot;Hokuetsu Gunki&quot;, Shingen recieved a visit from a \nmonk by the name of Tenkai who would later become and advisor to \nIeyasu, and he told him that &quot;the man who crossed swords with Kenshin \nwas not me, but someone who looks like/resembles me.&quot;\n\nSo Shingen said that it was his Kagemusha that fought with Kenshin, \nnot himself.  Therefore, there is also the possiblity that they were \nBOTH kagemusha.  Kenshin and Shingen were both worthy opponents who \nhad never seen eachother&#39;s face.  That may have also added to the \nconfusion as well.  Although the personal combat between Kenshin and \nShingen is recorded in the Koyo Gunkan, however in truth, there isn&#39;t \nany evidence to support this.&quot;\n\nBased on the above, you have to wonder if Kenshin and Shingen ever \nreally DID fight...\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Atisi Kazuari&quot; \n&lt;broccolihead30@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I bid you all greetings, I have just arrived but I will just into \nthe \n&gt; present question without delay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of the research I have done in the fields of War, politcial, \nmilatary \n&gt; and cultural history of Japan there is very little dispute that it \n&gt; was in fact Kenshin, some sources even have him named Kagetoura, \nbut \n&gt; indeed they did meet though, face to face only that once. \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope that was of some help, though it may not have been as \n&gt; discriptive as it could have been\n&gt; \n&gt; Atsi\n\n\n"
