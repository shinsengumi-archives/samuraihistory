It survived \nunscathed the Great Kanto Earthquake and the fire bombings of World \nWar II, but other pockets of the city share that good fortune. What \nsets Tsukudajima apart is the sense of community that has survived \nfor four centuries. \n\nOriginally a grassy island at the estuary of the Sumidagawa river, \nit was settled at the beginning of the Edo Period (1603-1867), at \nthe invitation of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by a group of fishermen from \nOsaka whose descendants still fish the waters of Tokyo Bay. They \ncalled it Tsukudajima, an area that roughly corresponds to Tsukuda 1-\nchome. \n\nTsunenari Tokugawa, 18th Head of the Tokugawa Shogunal Household, \nlooks at least 10 years younger than his 65 years. For 38 of those \nyears he worked at Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line), but retired as \nvice president two years ago to devote his time and energy to \nestablishing the Tokugawa Memorial Foundation. \n\n&quot;Do you mind if I smoke?&quot; he asks, sitting in his NYK office, where \nhe still works as a consultant. &quot;This is the only room in the whole \nbuilding where smoking is still permitted,&quot; he says and \nshrugs. &quot;Executive privilege,&quot; he says with a smile. \n\nTokugawa explains that Ieyasu once needed to visit a shrine in the \nOsaka area, but the trip was made difficult because of a flood. \nFishermen from a nearby village, Tsukudamura, provided boats and \nprovisions and helped him reach the shrine. Ieyasu was grateful for \ntheir help and when he moved into Fushimi Castle, he asked them to \nprovide fresh fish to the castle. \n\nAfter he became shogun and began to govern, Ieyasu invited the \nfishermen to Edo, gave them the island, which they named \nTsukudajima, and granted them fishing rights to all of Edo Bay. He \nasked them to provide fresh fish every day to Edo Castle, \nparticularly shirauo, whitebait. \n\n&quot;They brought virtually all of them to the castle and this continued \nfor 260 years,&quot; Tokugawa says. \n\nThe Tsukudajima people were still providing shirauo to the Tokugawa \nfamily after the start of the Meiji Era (1868-1912). \n\n&quot;On March 1, four or five representatives of the Tsukudajima people \ncome to my home to present a quantity of shirauo,&quot; Tokygawa \nsays. &quot;It is a small, transparent fish that turns white when you \ncook it. Very delicious,&quot; he says. &quot;Especially as tempura. That&#39;s \nhow my wife fixes it for me.&quot; \n\n&quot;But, alas, no shirauo are left in Tokyo Bay,&quot; he says. &quot;The last \nwere caught, I believe, in the late 1950s. Since then they&#39;ve been \ngoing to Tsukiji fish market to get the best shirauo they could \nfind.&quot; \n\nOn a more hopeful note Tokugawa says that the water quality in the \nbay has improved tremendously and that researchers have succeeded in \nhatching shirauo. &quot;If that fish comes back to Tokyo Bay it will be a \nvictorious day for the ecology.&quot; \n\n&quot;This is not a dream,&quot; he adds. &quot;Some sushi-quality fish you get now \ncome from Tokyo Bay. I&#39;m crossing my fingers that someday the \nshirauo will be back.&quot; \n\nTsukudajima still retains the slow-paced atmosphere of a rural \nfishing village. The houses, many of which are superb examples of \nmokuzo kaoku, traditional wooden timbered structures, are crowded \ntogether with only narrow passageways between them. A few long-\nhandled water pumps, which still work, are scattered throughout the \nneighborhood. Docked at a rickety peer in a canal off the river are \nseveral fishing vessels and a traditional yakatabune, a tatami-\nfloored party boat, which can be hired out for special occasions. \n\nThe small neighborhood is bordered on two sides by nine towering \napartment buildings, with more on the way. But if you turn your back \non the high-rises and look toward the river, nothing looms on the \nhorizon. \n\nThe heart of the neighborhood embraces a post office, a liquor \nstore, a barber shop, and a general store that sells everything from \nscrubbing powder and dishwashing liquid to jump ropes and penny \ncandy-100 kinds that attract a constant parade of neighborhood kids. \n\nThese shops have been run by their respective families for \ngenerations. The neighborhood also boasts three shops that \nspecialize in tsukudani, an Edo-Period delicacy. \n\nTsukudani is a salty-sweet preserve of tiny fish, shrimp, shellfish, \nseaweed, or other edibles that have been simmered in soy sauce, \nsugar and salt. Often eaten as a topping on rice, tsukudani \noriginated in Tsukudajima. \n\nKenji Kobayashi, the voluble sixth-generation proprietor of Marukyu, \na tsukudani shop open since 1859, stands behind his small counter \nlined with red lacquer boxes containing various types of tsukudani. \n\n&quot;Each item is simmered for three or four hours in a huge iron pot,&quot; \nhe says, spreading his arms apart, &quot;large enough for two men to \nstand inside.&quot; \n\nHis tsukudani is made exactly the way it&#39;s always been made, he \npoints out. The exact balance of salty and sweet is a secret varying \nfrom shop to shop. &quot;We make new batches every two to three days \ndepending on what&#39;s needed,&quot; he says. \n\n&quot;Once all our raw material came from Tokyo Bay,&quot; he says, gesturing \ntoward the river. &quot;The fish, the seaweed, the shrimp-but now only \nasari (clams) come from the bay.&quot; \n\nThe apartment towers don&#39;t seem to bother him much. &quot;We&#39;ve got three \ngenerations of customers coming here,&quot; Kobayashi says. &quot;Even those \nnew apartment buildings are not bad for us. Many young people are \nliving there and some of them come in to try our tsukudani.&quot; \n\nThere are two other old tsukudani shops on the same street, Tenyasu \nand Tsukugen Tanakaya, each in business for about 160 years. \n\nAnother member of the community is Yasuhide Nakajima, an 11th-\ngeneration master craftsman of Edo-style lacquer work. \n\n&quot;My ancestors started in Nihonbashi at the time of Tokugawa Iemitsu, \nmore than 300 years ago,&quot; says the 61-year-old artisan. \n\nThe war destroyed his family workshop. About 40 years ago his father \nmoved the atelier to Tsukudajima. The old wooden shack that serves \nas his workshop is perhaps the oldest building in the neighborhood. \n\nOne of Nakajima&#39;s best-selling items is eight-sided chopsticks made \nfrom teak or purple rosewood. &quot;These chopsticks will last 20 years,&quot; \nhe says. &quot;And I&#39;ll repair them for free, if they need it.&quot; \n\n&quot;I make real things,&quot; says Nakajima. \n\nHis family is famous for the luminous dakkanshitsu (Japanese sweets \ndish). It is painstakingly crafted layer by layer of hemp linen, \nwashi paper and coatings of red lacquer. Creating a set of five \ntakes three years. \n\nLacquer painting is a tedious process. &quot;It&#39;s paint-dry-paint-dry,&quot; \nNakajima says. &quot;You brush on one coat of lacquer and that&#39;s it for \nthe day,&quot; he says with a grin. &quot;Young people don&#39;t have the patience \nfor this kind of work.&quot; \n\nPatience is most important, stresses Nakajima. It takes time to make \nsomething strong, beautiful, and useful-until aji ga deru, the \ndeeper quality, is revealed. \n\nSomething similar, perhaps, happens to neighborhoods. Four centuries \nof remembrance and appreciation have helped to define the unique \nsense of community that thrives in Tsukudajima. \n\nHigh-rise by high-rise, the city slowly encroaches on Tsukudajima, \nbut life still goes on pretty much as it has for generations. \n\nA tofu peddler, a young man in baggy jeans and a baseball cap, pulls \na cart through the narrow alleyways and occasionally blows two \nforlorn notes on a small brass horn announcing fresh tofu for sale. \nA housewife stops him to purchase something for the evening meal. \nThen he is on his way again-his tune floating on the evening air. \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\nMarukyu (1-2-10 Tsukuda, Chuo Ward, 03-3531-4823).
