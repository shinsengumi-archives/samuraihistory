Were there other \nforms of executions practiced (apologies for the morbidity of topic) \nother than seppuku, crucifixion?&quot;\n\nYes, lots of them. Not so much during the Edo period where \ncrucifixtion was the standard, but during the Sengoku period and \nbefore, the forms of execution were pretty much subject to the local \nwarlord&#39;s whims. Just about anything was done...one of the most \ngruesome being one of the Saito clan boiling an enemy to death in a \nlarge cauldron (much like Lord Yabu did in Clavell&#39;s Shogun). This \nalso happened to the notorious bandit Ishikawa Goemon. Another \nwarlord (sorry, don&#39;t recall who) was buried up to his neck with a \nbamboo saw placed next to him and a sign inviting passersby to feel \nfree to have a go at him (Clavell used this too, for Lord Ishida). \nBeating a man to death was common as was death during torture (which \nwasn&#39;t a planned execution, but just sped up the process).\n\n\n"
