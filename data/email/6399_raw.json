They went to Portugal, Spain, and Italy,\nand were received by the Pope. I&#39;m sure if you did a\ngoogle search you could find most of the details.\nSansom covers it in his volume 2, and there are\nseveral other sources out there. And interesting read\nwould be &quot;The Samurai&quot; by Endo Shusaku--fictional\naccount of a samurai journeying to Europe.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
