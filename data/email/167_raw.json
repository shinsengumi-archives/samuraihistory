It started with manga&#39;s like Lone wolf\n&gt; and cub and \n&gt; movies like Yojimbo, Ran etc. But as I grew older my\n&gt; interest in the \n&gt; history grew.\n&gt;    I am definitly an amature historian and not a\n&gt; scholar by any sense \n&gt; of the word. But I hope to contribute to the list as\n&gt; time goes on.\n&gt; \n&gt;    My question is, were peasants literate during the\n&gt; samurai eras or \n&gt; was it only the samurai or noble classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Aaron\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
