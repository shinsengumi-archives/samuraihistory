It was\n&gt; either leather, steel, or a combination of the two.&quot;\n&gt; Well, with that out of the way, it is a bit off subject, but would an\n&gt; axe be any good in battle?  Seems to me it would be like wielding a\n&gt; big hammer - swing - miss - stagger - readjust grip - repeat.\n&gt; Obviously axes existed in Japan - they had to cut firewood somehow,\n&gt; but was the reason it didn&#39;t appear in battle because of its\n&gt; unweildlyness (my new word for the day)?  Or did they just not think\n&gt; of it as a weapon?\n&gt;\n\nIt was definitely a weapon. The thing is, as you suggest, was it an\n*efficient* weapon? It clearly could be a devastating one, but it would be\none hard to wield and control. Swords and lances made for much better\ninfantry weapons. Otherwise *all* our infantrymen might be carrying bazookas\ninstead of M-16s.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n"
