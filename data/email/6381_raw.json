I enjoyed it very much.\n\nI just happened to be reading the story on the young Missouri mom when your \noriginal post came through and wasn&#39;t sure if it had reached the \ninternational level. I also recalled the little incident over the &#39;Ninja \nDay&#39; thing.  Such disconnects with reality and inability to discern fact \nfrom fiction & satire is very scary to me.\n\nBut don&#39;t get me written off as a sour old she-goat who wants nothing more \nthan to head-butt everything in sight. I&#39;m very ready to laugh at the \nfoibles of humans (including myself), be silly, play with my kids, sing \noff-key, and render a very sharp opinion once in a while..... among other \nthings....\n\n.... don&#39;t forget, wicked, too....\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n----Original Message Follows----\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
