Or did the name die out with the death of the last (former) Shogun, \n&gt; Yoshinobu, in 1913?  Same thing, and this will probably sound really, REALLY \n&gt; stupid, but does anyone know if the Oda or Toyotomi family names have survived \n&gt; into the present day?\n\nOh, heck. There are scads of Tokugawa out there.\n\nOne of the ladies being courted at one time by the current Crown Prince was a \nTokugawa. The Toyotomi were annihilated in 1615, and there are lots of Oda out \nthere.\n\n\n&gt;        And Tony, I&#39;m not offended by your comment about the books.  They&#39;re \n&gt; one of only two mystery series I can stand myself, the other being Janet \n&gt; Evanovich&#39;s Stephanie Plum series.  I normally read romance, although I&#39;m trying to \n&gt; branch out this year and read different authors and genres.\n\nThe trouble is, it&#39;s hard to find good historic Japan lit in English. The market \nis small, and the trap is to explain *enough* so that people unfamiliar will \nunderstand the concepts while not turning off the handful of people who *do* \nunderstand and want the lit.\n\nI&#39;m currently working on a novel that leads up to Sekigahara (in my copious \nspare time &lt;wry g&gt;) which I would describe as a Japanese version of &quot;Killer Angels.&quot;\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
