Samurai History Journal, edited by \nRomulus Hillsborough, is the only magazine in English focusing on the \nhistory and culture of the great men of the Meiji Restoration (1853-\n1868: the last fifteen years of the samurai era). \n\nThe Meiji Restoration has often been neglected and/or misrepresented \nby writers of the English language. When this history has been \nrepresented seriously and accurately, it has generally been in a dry \nacademic format. Through articles and essays by distinguished history \nwriters and novelists in Japan, it is the purpose of Samurai History \nJournal to present this most fascinating period in Japanese history, \nand the humanity of the men who made this history, accurately and \nrealistically, in a vivid literary format which will at once educate \nand entertain.\n\nMore information about Samurai History Journal is available at \nwww.ridgebackpress.com.\n\nRidgeback Press\n2335 Collins Ave.\nPinole, CA  94564\nPh: (510) 758-4940\nFax: (510) 758-4939\nridgebackpress@...\nwww.ridgebackpress.com\n\n\n\n\n\n"
