She didn&#39;t ask how many people were in the\nSCA. She asked how many people on this list were in\nthe SCA. And while you may not have given the full\nhistory of the SCA, you certainly gave a dissertation\non it&#39;s international scope and size. Not relevant to\nthe question. It may appear redundant that I made the\nclarification after another poster also pointed it\nout, but I will point out that I can only read one\nemail at a time. Yours came first. I answered it. Then\neventually I got to the email where the other\nindividual also clarified it. So you got clarification\ntwice. Some would think that a blessing, and move on. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nTake Yahoo! Mail with you!
