It&#39;s unlikely a samurai&#39;s funeral was much different from a \n  common funeral, but probably with more guests and gifts. You know, \n  burn the body, pick the bones from the ashes with sticks, deposit \n  remains with a temple, etc... \n\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Hi Everyone,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; First I would like to extend my thanks to everyone for their \n  invaluable wealth of knowledge. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; I&#39;m hoping that someone could help point me in the direction of a \n  resource where I can further research the samurai funeral. To date \n  I&#39;ve been unable to find substantial information.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; THanks\n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
