Any source that says\n&gt;that guns didn&#39;t show up until the 1700&#39;s is absolutely wrong, and you\n&gt;should throw it away (or close the webpage), unless they were throwing\n&gt;rocks at Nagashino in 1575. It is documented historical fact that\n&gt;Western guns showed up in the 1540&#39;s.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTiesitk�, ett� varomaton viestint� voi maksaa ihmishenki�? \nhttp://www.communicationevolved.com/fi-fi/\n\n\n"
