Well chaps, allow me to reveal my purpose like a shoji door. Next year (Sept 09), I plan to begin my Phd at the University of Bristol where I have recieved a BA and an MA in Ancient History. My Phd will be a comparison between the warriors of Homer&#39;s Iliad (Troy etc the ancient history part) and the warriors of 16th century Japan.\n \nHere are a few area&#39;s im particularly interested by with this study:\n\nDivine weapons, and there properties which affect/alter/enhance the bearer\nThe interaction/ interferance of gods. spirits, Kami etc to warriors\nGlory, shame and honour in both cultures\nWarrior Cultures in general\nWho commands who? The General&#39;s or the famous warriors?\n \nIf anyone knows of any good points, or would like to offer different suggestions of comparison of these cultures, or feel any other knowledge could help in this investigation, that would be a grand help.\n \nThanks (domo arigato)\nTom \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMake a mini you and download it into Windows Live Messenger\nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/go/111354029/direct/01/\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
