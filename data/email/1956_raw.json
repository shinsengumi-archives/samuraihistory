I like the show but I dont go \nout of my way to make sure I watch it.  But I do remember Saito \nHajime being a character from the series, and someone on here was \nwriting about him.  Was he a real person that used to be a member of \nthe Shinsengumi?  And about another Shinsengumi member.  Okita Soji \nwho is a major character in the movie Gohatto.  I have a friend that \ntold me he is very popluar in Japan, and they even sell dolls of \nhim.  Also she told me that he died of consumption before the \nrevolution ever happened.  Can anyone confrim of correct these?\n\n\n"
