He currently does orders in 20 some odd country&#39;s and\n&gt;I can honestly say that they are top notch. You can find his website here:\n&gt;www.ninedirections.com tell him Luke recommended him. He will do just\n&gt;about any custome work.\n\nI went and had a look at the site you suggested, but sorry to say, all I \ncould see were standard Hanwei products. Thanks for the thought though.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n-- \nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
