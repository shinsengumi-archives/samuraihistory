I have read and researched alot on \nthe Japanese Culture, so yes I do know more about Japanese history \nthat I do my own history. Although I am taking the advice and will be \ndigging deeper into my history, I will continue learning about Japan. \nI have been there once and plan to visit alot more.      -TRES-\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Zev, I am of Russian decent but did not know or care too much \nabout it until recently. So started asking questions from some of my \nolder relatives, turns out they had a lot of old journals and \ndocuments from as far back as the mid 1800s, even found out my family \nhas a coat of arms, now I am hooked on Russian history as well as \nJapanese. I would recomend anyone to reserch their roots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n\n\nHey there Tres and Dave \nGood to hear from you both thought I might be the only one in this \nsituation. Tres your background sound really interesting, will read \nup on both the Arapaho and Pima cultures as I know next to nothing \nabout them. Dave your family has a coat of arms that so cool. So with \nluck you could trace your history back to the medieval times. \nWouldn&#39;t it be something if you found that your family was actually \npart royalty? If you can give me a picture of you family coat of arms \nI would be very grateful, would also like to look into this if that \nok with you. \nI spoke to my Uncle (Mothers side) last night about a family tree \nthat he had put together quite sometime ago, I have never see it so I \nasked him to send me a copy. This will be my starting point and with \nthis I hope to be able to learn more about my ancestors and culture. \nI don&#39;t think anyone in my Fathers side has done a family tree yet so \nmy brother and I are looking into this at the moment. Maybe that&#39;s \nsomething you both could look into, maybe someone in your family has \nalready done a family tree or maybe you will need to start the ball \nrolling. Anyways good luck and let us know how you go.\n\nZev\n\n\n\n\n\n"
