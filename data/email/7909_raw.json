(was\n&gt; RE: [samuraihistory] R\n&gt; e: h itokiri k\n&gt; \n&gt; No, no--you&#39;re misunderstanding me. Onnagozen\n&gt; specifically addressed me by\n&gt; name, in the post replying to me which I summed up\n&gt; in the logical syllogism\n&gt; below. When I said &quot;how else ought I take it?&quot; I was\n&gt; referring to\n&gt; Onnagozen&#39;s post, not yours. \n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ve been simply arguing a point--and not a bad\n&gt; one, though we&#39;re on\n&gt; occaision coming at cross purposes. No problem.\n&gt; However, Onnagozen attacks\n&gt; my point that fiction is not the proper place to\n&gt; study your historical facts\n&gt; by saying that history books aren&#39;t all correct, so\n&gt; who cares? That a. makes\n&gt; no logical sense, and b. was done in such a\n&gt; flippant, overbearing,\n&gt; condescending manner (to have the gall to suggest\n&gt; that I was saying fiction\n&gt; was a BAD thing is simply unnerving) that yes, I\n&gt; take issue with it. \n&gt; \n&gt; The only argument I can see that he/she is trying to\n&gt; make that makes sense\n&gt; would be: History books have flaws, so they are\n&gt; worthless, so you might as\n&gt; well learn your history from movies. \n&gt; \n&gt; That leaves us with everyone getting their origins\n&gt; of WWII from &quot;Pearl\n&gt; Harbor&quot; and &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;.\n&gt; Whether you liked or disliked or were inspired or\n&gt; think they are great or\n&gt; bad for fostering historical discussion, to say that\n&gt; this alone suffices and\n&gt; you can get a grasp of history without trying to\n&gt; find actual historical fact\n&gt; is plain mystifying to me. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I addressed you by name (and I profusely apologize\n&gt; for making the \n&gt; &gt; mistake on your name) because yours was the post I\n&gt; was replying to. \n&gt; &gt; Still, it is directed to the group and anyone can\n&gt; respond to it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I won&#39;t address anyone by name any longer if it\n&gt; causes this sort of \n&gt; &gt; misunderstanding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nina\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; &gt; On Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, October 21, 2005 9:39 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?\n&gt; (was\n&gt; &gt; RE: [samuraihistory] R\n&gt; &gt; e: h itokiri k\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I cannot speak for others, nor do I claim to do\n&gt; &gt; so.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All my posts are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directed at the group as a whole, as I assume\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; most posts mailed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the group are directed.

If you reply\n&gt; &gt; directly to me, I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to directly answer, especially when\n&gt; &gt; addressed in an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; argumentative and combative manner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got no problem if you or he/she or anyone\n&gt; &gt; wants to argue the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; merits and foibles of history books, in\n&gt; specific,\n&gt; &gt; or in general. I DO\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a problem when this is couched as a\n&gt; &gt; counterargument to my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; statement, because it doesn&#39;t counter my\n&gt; statement\n&gt; &gt; whatsoever.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What we had was this: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nate: &quot;Tangerines are not red.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dissenter: &quot;Well, neither are all apples red! So\n&gt; &gt; how do we really know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which ones are red and which ones aren&#39;t? Does\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; matter?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does it matter if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your apple is red and my tangerine is blue, as\n&gt; &gt; long as it inspires me? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And certain tangerines may be of such hues of\n&gt; &gt; orange that they may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very very close to red.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Simple facts: not everyone can tell that\n&gt; &gt; tangerines are not red. Many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tangerines may be so orange they are close to\n&gt; &gt; being red, but being red\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not the point of a tangerine. For purposes of\n&gt; &gt; this analogy, all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apples SHOULD be red--the fact that many are\n&gt; green\n&gt; &gt; or brown is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warning to the partaker that they need to check\n&gt; &gt; their apples before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they eat them, but not grounds for saying that\n&gt; a.\n&gt; &gt; all apples are bad,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or b.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all tangerines are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; equally red with apples. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t\t\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
