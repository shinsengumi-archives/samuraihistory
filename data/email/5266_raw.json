Lots of\n&gt; nit-picks on different \n&gt; interpretations of events. Getting 2 historians from\n&gt; the same culture (much \n&gt; less historically hostile ones) to agree on anything\n&gt; historical is kind of \n&gt; like herding cats anyway. 2 an attempt to denigrate\n&gt; all Japanese history \n&gt; texts because Japan, while having owned up to some\n&gt; of the very negative \n&gt; aspects of the Pacific war, has refused to simply\n&gt; roll over and paint \n&gt; themselves as the demons many Koreans and Chinese\n&gt; believe they are. 3 Japan \n&gt; bashing in general.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I am not defending the revisionist tendencies that\n&gt; DO occur in Japan \n&gt; textbooks. The Korean page is so obviously slanted\n&gt; in such an anti-japanese \n&gt; manner it is hard to take any of it seriously. Most\n&gt; Japanese are very \n&gt; cognizant (sp?) of the many attrocities perpetrated\n&gt; by thier military in the \n&gt; Pacific War. Teaching children that grandpa was a\n&gt; raping murdering demon is \n&gt; unacceptable regardless of the wishes of Korea and\n&gt; China.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Add photos to your messages with MSN 8.
