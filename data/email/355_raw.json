Or was it so that if they didn&#39;t follow bushido then \n&gt; they didn&#39;t wear them?\n\n  The Hakama was a prefered garment.  The Kimono bound the legs and made shiko (knee walking for indoors) very difficult. The Hakama was also heavily desinged for horsemanship (jobajitsu)which the Kimono was not. In Martial arts training halls it was the norm. as recently as the 1950&#39;s, students of Aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba were sent home from training if they did not have Hakama, only zubon (pants) with them.\n\n\n\n"
