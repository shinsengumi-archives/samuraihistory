If some random American director cl=\r\nosely followed the style\nand \n&gt; plots of  Mizoguchi or Ozu even if he made =\r\nthe settings American he \n&gt; would probably be known as a &#39;Japanese&#39; directo=\r\nr. \n\nI SERIOUSLY doubt that. No American director has ever been thought of\n=\r\nas anything other than a director, at best &quot;inspired by&quot; or\n&quot;influenced by&quot;=\r\n someone else. Probably Holywood pride - they think\nthey are the center of =\r\nthe world, why relegate someone to being a\n&#39;japanese&#39; director?  The phrase=\r\n doesn&#39;t even make any sense anyway.\n\n\n\n\n"
