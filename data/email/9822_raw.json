Then, under new government , MEIJI,\n&gt; Emperor returned and started to ruin Japan again .\n&gt;\n&gt; Why did Buke vanish in Japanese history after 1,000 years since birth ?\n\nDo you mean &#39;ruin Japan&#39; (i.e. Destroy Japan) or &#39;rule Japan&#39;?\n\nI think the reason that they &#39;vanished&#39; is clear:  The Meiji\ngovernment officially revoked the warrior class.  As to *why* they did\nit:  The warrior class was seen by many as an old (thousand year)\ninstitution that was preventing Japan from modernizing.  Rightly or\nwrongly they believed that to go forward, men should be treated based\non their merits, not their rank (I believe much of this comes from the\nChoshu rebellion, as I recall there were quite a few peasants and\nronin involved in that particular struggle).\n\n-Josh\n\n"
