(That&#39;s what this group is all about )\n\nWhat I *am* short over -- and have little tolerance for -- is the samurai \nwannabe. The samurai are over. Dead. Gone. Legislated out of existence. Kaput.\n\nStudying martial arts -- or just *wanting* to be a samurai -- does not and *can* \nnot make one a samurai or reflect reality any more than me wishing I could be a \nJedi.\n\nPeople who ask questions get answers. People who make asinine assertions get \nlaughed at.\n\nTony\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
