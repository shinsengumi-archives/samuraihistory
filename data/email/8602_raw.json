One way to look at  \nthis though, would be to accept it as a very cool way to find out  \nabout your Japanese heritage.\n\tYou need to look into your family history and see if you can  \nidentify the people or events responsible for the curse. Then of  \ncourse you&#39;ll have to learn about esoteric religious practice in  \nJapan, which ceremonies of exorcism have been performed and which  \nones might help to lift the curse.\n\tYou&#39;ll want to study the language and necessarily will have to know  \nyour  cousins better. this might make a cool documentary done  \ncorrectly or a good book. The idea at least is more interesting than  \nmany of the &quot;I lived in Japan&quot; books out there.\n\tBe careful of course, you could end up spending a lot of money on a  \nfraud or get caught up in a cult, but the chance to learn about who  \nyou are, and perhaps face a real demon is too tempting. I say this  \nhas to be your personal mission, not one we can help much with but  \nthat I would love to hear about.\n\tGo for broke!\n-t\n\nOn Mar 24, 2006, at 5:41 PM, Natalie wrote:\n\n&gt; I was born in Japan, Japanese mother, caucasian father.  My mother  \n&gt; told\n&gt; me that her family history was samurai.  She also told me about a  \n&gt; curse\n&gt; placed on her/our family for the many deaths caused by them.  I am\n&gt; curious to know if this was indeed true and if it was just our family\n&gt; that was cursed or all samurai that was cursed.  I will be honest to\n&gt; say that the curse is still intact and still affects us.  I do not  \n&gt; want\n&gt; to go into detail, but is it possible to end this suffering on our\n&gt; family or is this something that will plague us forever?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; YAHOO!
