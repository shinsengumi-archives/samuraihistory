In my=\r\n Sado experience, when you receive the\n&gt; tea bowl, you turn in clockwise to=\r\n get to the drinking\n&gt; side (each bowl has a &quot;face&quot;, which the host present=\r\ns\n&gt; to you, and you drink from the side opposite the face,\n&gt; so you have to=\r\n turn it). Once done, you turn it back\n&gt; counterclockwise. Some schools mak=\r\ne a big deal of\n&gt; turning it 3 times (not completely around, but using 3\n&gt; =\r\nmotions to turn it halfway around), some don&#39;t--it\n&gt; just depends. B ut no,=\r\n I&#39;ve never ever ehard of the\n&gt; direction indicating your hostile intention=\r\ns--sounds\n&gt; like complete bunk to me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks I agree. This tale was t=\r\nold by one of the local tea farmers \nhere in Kanaya, a town known for fine =\r\ngreen tea. Since this man has \na bit of a reputation for rambling on in sub=\r\njects he knows little \nabout I thought it would be interesting to get the g=\r\nroup&#39;s expert \nopinion.\n\nThanks again\nHirai \n&gt; ____________________________=\r\n______________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
