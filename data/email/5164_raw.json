Mori Motonari won an impressive \nvictory ov=\r\ner them, one of his earliest victories.  They seem to have \nfallen off the =\r\nmap after that:\n\n&quot;Motonari was born Shojumaru, the second son of M=F4ri Hir=\r\nomoto, a \ndaimyo who struggled against the local Takeda clan (not to be \nco=\r\nnfused with the Kai branch of that family) and the encroaching \nO=FBchi. In=\r\n 1499, Hiromoto found himself in the path of a looming \nAmako invasion from=\r\n Izumo, and allied with O=FBchi. At the time, O=FBchi \nYoshioki was becomin=\r\ng involved in the gunboat politics of Kyoto and \nwhile he was away, the Ama=\r\nko grew stronger. In 1506 Hiromoto died, \nand was succeded by his eldest so=\r\nn, Okimoto, who ended up assisting \nYoshioki in Kyoto for a short period. I=\r\nt happened that he died in \n1516, and Motonari was named to act as guardian=\r\n to the late lord&#39;s \nyoung son, Komatsumaru. Komatsumaru in turn was to die=\r\n in 1523, after \nwhich Motonari became the official head of he clan. Eviden=\r\ntly, \nM=F4ri&#39;s predecessors had died under unclear circumstances, for there=\r\n \nis a legend that it was Motonari himself who dispatched them. At any \nrat=\r\ne, Motonari did not inherit a particularly enviable position. The \nmost pow=\r\nerful daimyo in Aki, Takeda Motoshige, took advantage of \nOkimoto&#39;s death t=\r\no make a play for M=F4ri land, and in Izumo the Amako \nbegan to rattle thei=\r\nr sabers. Luckily for the M=F4ri, however, their \nyoung lord quickly proved=\r\n himself a man of action. Takeda had set out \nto take Koriyama Castle (the =\r\nM=F4ri&#39;s chief bastion since the early \n14th Century) but found his troops =\r\nintercepted and routed by the \nnumerically inferior M=F4ri clan. This victo=\r\nry carried a certain \nprestige value for Motonari, but was quickly over-sha=\r\ndowed by greater \nevents.&quot;\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Le=\r\ndbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re playing too much Shogun: Tota=\r\nl War. \n&gt; \n&gt; The Takeda were a Shugo family under the Ashikaga\n&gt; Shogunate.=\r\n At one time, they held appointments in Aki,\n&gt; but it was well before the M=\r\nori came to prominence.......\n\n\n"
