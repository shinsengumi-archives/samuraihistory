I have not had the time to read it myself, yet, but thought I \nwould post it for anyone who has some time and interest.\n\nhttp://www.japanecho.co.jp/sum/2002/2906_bix_reprint.pdf\n\n\nCheers,\n\nShannon\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
