Fred \nSaberhagen&#39;s _The\n&gt; &gt; Dracula Tape_ is a rather nicely researched satire that purports \nto be Vlad\n&gt; &gt; Tepes&#39; own account of his visit to England, refuting the unkind \nreports of\n&gt; &gt; Stoker and &quot;that old sadist Van Helsing.&quot;  If you can find the \nnovel, it\n&gt; &gt; might give you some pleasure.\n&gt; \n&gt; I love that book. I regard it as the *true* version of the Stoker \naccount. :)\n\n  I will search for the book.\n\n&gt; For the record, many years ago I wrote a term paper on Vlad Tepes. \nAs a former \n&gt; Orthodox seminarian, I thought his was a rather interesting story \nof trying to \n&gt; walk a tightrope between the Orthodox Church and the RC Church with \nthe Turks in \n&gt; the pit below waiting to gobble him up if he fell...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n  And gobble up they did, until only the head was left, to be taken \nto Constantinopole as a proof. Anyway, although his reign was bloody \n(not really as bloody as the westerners think), we cherish his memory \nbecause he was able to deal with the many corrupted nobles and common \nthieves of the time (on a more lay approach, of course). Nice \nmetaphor, Mr. Bryant :) I think you already are aware of the fact \nthat Vlad Tepes remained orthodox and built some monasteries and \nchurches, and the exagerations of his cruelty were dued to the \nbenedictine and capucin monk orders, which refused to obey the \ncountry rules and fled to german lands, where they spred legends of \nhorror. It seems that a monk named Jacob is the author of the \nmanuscript found in 1462 in the Saint Galin monastery in Switzerland, \nwhich was the first of the many that formed the &quot;Anti-Dracula&quot; \ncampaign, with major impact on ther german world.\n  Ok, I am really sorry I took up so much space with non-samurai \ntext, but I somehow felt the need to try to redeem the name of one of \nour most loved historical figures, which has been terribly misjudged. \nIf the message is deleted, I would not take any offense, and also \nfrom my part, the subject is closed.\n  Thank you very much,\n\n  I will now return to learning of the ancient Japan and its \nwarriors...\n\n  Respectfully,\n\n  Gabriel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
