It was also called the Kotetsu when it was first acquired as a\nTokugawa ship.  I have been researching this ship for about a year now,\nthough not as well as I possibly could considering my lack of being about to\nread Japanese (yet).  If you know anything about this ship please let me\nknow.  I would love to talk with you about it and swap notes.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMake the most of your family vacation with tips from the MSN Family Travel\nGuide! http://dollar.msn.com\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
