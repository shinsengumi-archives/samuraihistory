But also, saying that &quot;Author X wrote this in his Japanese\nhistory book&quot; also does not make it necessarily the truth. \n\nIt looks that we essentially agree. We need to examine all sources and then\nuse our logic to evaluate the likely worth of each source and then draw our\nown conclusions. Then we can discuss them here on the forum.\n\nBut also remember that many times a surgeon&#39;s scalpal frequently works\nbetter than a single slice with a katana.  \n\nNina \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 9:50 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai? (was RE: [samuraihistory] R\ne: h itokiri kawaka\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ned,\n&gt; \n\n\nThe name is Nate. Not Ned. \n\n\n&gt; I think that the main point of contention that I would have is that \n&gt; history books all have the intended purpose of being correct whereas \n&gt; fiction&#39;s purpose isn&#39;t to be correct, it is to entertain.\n\nThe point of all this is to slam the door on a return of those who use &quot;but\nI saw it on Ruroni Kenshin/in a Kurosawa movie/my sensei told me&quot; as a\nlegitimate argument. It is not. While we can debate every historical\nreference individually, as a whole, the point of history works is fact, the\npoint of fiction is not. Yes, history writers have agendas. Yes, history\nwriters may get facts wrong. Yes, they may even distort them. However,\nthat&#39;s still no comparison to a work created with a willing suspension of\nfact for the purposes of entertainment. There is NOTHING wrong with\nentertainment. There is something wrong when people take entertainment and\ntry to use it to justify fact. That&#39;s the issue here. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nYahoo!
