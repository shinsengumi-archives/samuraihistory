I was wondering if anyone has any ideas why there is a lack of defencive shield in japanese military history. Ive read that it maybe due to the samurai origins as a horseback archer and that they were not devloped because ,obviously thay would be in the way of drawing a bow. I also find it strange that in my kendo training there are no sword techniques like the lunge as seen in european fencing which is sometimes seen as a way past a shield, is this why the lunge techinque wasnt devloped in japan because there was no need for it due to a lack of shields. Anyone got any ideas ( i am aware there are lunging techniques in japanese swordplay but vastly different from european forms) thanks all hope your all good\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHave you never noticed that Japanese weapons tend to be weapons that \nrequire the use of BOTH hands?\n\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
