Many of his books are filled with small errors and innaccuracies that he very obviously took verbatim from Papinot - although he NEVER mentions Papinot in his sources...  Looking at his books, his information, and his sources together, one has to wonder if he can even read Japanese at all...  \n\n*ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of Inabayama took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in Japanese, including a few he lists in his bibliography state it happened in 1567.  So you may be thinking, &#39;what&#39;s two or three years?&#39;  Well, what if I told you the battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!\n\nYou could write a treatise on just the errors and uncited Papinot sources alone.  Not to mention a picture listed as an &#39;authors representation&#39; of something that actually looks suspiciously like a tracing of a picture in a Rekishi gunzo book. (Dont have his book or the Gunzo book on hand right now to cite which one)\nGuess because he&#39;s the only game in town he thinks he doesn&#39;t have to work at it anymore...?  I&#39;ve seen him mentioned as Stephen &quot;buy my books&quot; Turnbull in some post before, and I can see why.  Just take a look at his website.  You can&#39;t help but get the impression scholarship takes a definate backseat to profit.  guess I can&#39;t really blame the guy, though.  Gotta put food on the table somehow.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;d rather read &#39;dry&#39; histories if they are more accurate than &#39;popular&#39; histories, although I&#39;d prefer to read an accurate popular history! (like A.J. Bryant&#39;s stuff!  At least you get the impression that he has a real interest in the subject, and can actually read japanese, and actually puts in the research!)\n\nOh well, just a rant on my part, and I could very well be totally wrong.\n\n\n"
