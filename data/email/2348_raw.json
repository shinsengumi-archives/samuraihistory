I don&#39;t think the question was &quot;what is it called when a Samurai stops being a Samurai&quot;.... \n\n  &gt;&gt;Well, historically, retired folk were &quot;inkyo&quot; but that&#39;s not anything \n  particularly &quot;samurai&quot; related.\n\n  Samurai was a (hereditary) social status, like the class of the hereditary \n  knightly class in Europe -- it wasn&#39;t a job. You don&#39;t retire from a social \n  class. You die.\n\n  Tony\n\n        Yahoo!
