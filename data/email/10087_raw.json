Been there & done that. Meaning my parents already been to Japan & checke=\r\nd out family records. They found records dating back to 1700. That is the f=\r\nurthest they got. =A0Unfortunately, many families did not tell there storie=\r\ns to future generation how the family became samurai. My mother&#39;s family is=\r\n one of them.\n&gt; U also mentioned a lower class samurai would pass down thei=\r\nr katana. My understanding it was a tradition to honor the family sword & i=\r\nf possible to pass down to the next son. Regardless of status. Anyone reall=\r\ny know for sure which one is correct?\n&gt;\nHere&#39;s what I know:\n\n* There was a =\r\nbelief that the longer inanimate objects were kept, the\nmore likely they we=\r\nre to develop a soul of some sort (there is a great\nBuddhist scroll about d=\r\niscarded items that have become animated\nthrough this process).  This was n=\r\not necessarily desirable, mind you.\n\n* Especially in the Edo period, people=\r\n were big into the &quot;filial\npiety&quot; aspects of Confucianism.  That meant that=\r\n they would be likely\nto honor the items belonging to a revered ancestor.\n\n=\r\n* Practicality suggests that no bushi family went around with 1 sword\nto th=\r\neir name.  If you consider that each male adult in the family has\nto have t=\r\nwo swords for formal occasions, how would having a single\nfamily sword work=\r\n?  Look at the Tokugawa house:  There are MANY\nTokugawa family swords out t=\r\nhere--there are quite a few that are\nattributed to being used by Ieyasu him=\r\nself.  There are also many\nbranches of the family, so do you think a specia=\r\nl sword was formed\nevery time a new branch was formed?\n\n* Swords rust/break=\r\n/etc.  The family doesn&#39;t dissolve because\ngreat-great-great-granfather&#39;s s=\r\nword was lost in a fire.  It is a\nterrible loss, yes, but it isn&#39;t like it =\r\nwas irreplaceable.\n\n\nThe habit of passing down swords from father to son I =\r\ncan definitely\nsee (or father to daughter or son-in-law in some cases), and=\r\n we know\nthat it happened.  However, I don&#39;t know of an overarching traditi=\r\non\nof &quot;the&quot; family sword--that sounds like modern samurai romanticism.\n\n\n-J=\r\nosh\n\n"
