Helps to know when\nwe&#39;re talking about.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I cannot use Makoto for the forename.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Why not? Knowing why not might help us suggest an\n&gt; &gt; alternative. \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be liable for libel :-) Need I say more?\n\nUm...yeah. If I used the name &quot;Jim&quot; in a story, that\ndoesn&#39;t mean anyone named Jim would be suing me if\nthey didn&#39;t like what I wrote. So yes, you need to say\nmore for me to understand why you can&#39;t use it. Though\nI suppose &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot; would explain it well\nenough.\n\n\n&gt; Yes, he interacts with non-Japanese speakers for the\n&gt; most part. And I have to say my personal experience\n&gt; is\n&gt; that many Japanese names are shortened according to\n&gt; English principles. My experience being with several\n&gt; Canadian born Japanese( with Japanese names,\n&gt; shortened. Tad was one of them).\n\nCanadian-born Japanese, not Japanese-born Japanese.\n&quot;Tad&quot; isn&#39;t pronounceable to a native Japanese\nspeaker--the only final consonant in Japanese is &quot;N&quot;,\nso Tad would come out &quot;Taddo&quot;. But, if he&#39;s being\ngiven the nickname by non-Japanese, then it would\nfollow their patterns, not Japanese ones. Assuming the\nAmerican/Canadian/whatever in your story are the ones\ngiving him the nickname, this should be fine.\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Daisuke&quot; and make it &quot;Dice&quot; (kinda cool),\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, very cool!\n&gt; \n&gt; What I need to know is what Daisuke means! Is it a\n&gt; surname or forename?\n\n&#22823;&#21161;&#12288;&quot;Great Help&quot;--could almost be\nstretched to &quot;Savior&quot;, without getting biblical or\nanything. Dai is Big, Great, etc.; Suke used above is\nthe same as tasukeru, to save. It&#39;s a given name, not\na family name--are you looking for family names also?\n\n\n&gt; Helly Angel said:\n&gt; \n&gt; I recommended you the surename: Takagi and as the\n&gt; name:\n&gt; \n&gt; Jintaro\n&gt; Jutaro\n&gt; Jingoro\n&gt; \n&gt; all &quot;sound&quot; good to me, but again I need to know why\n&gt; Takagi - what is the history here?\n&gt; \n&gt; And what the forenames he suggested actually mean. \n\n&#39640;&#26408;&#65306;Tall Tree. Not sure what\nhistory Helly is alluding to. \n\n&#29978;&#22826;&#37070; Jintarou\n&#37325;&#22826;&#37070; Juutarou\n&#29978;&#20116;&#37070; Jingorou\n\nI don&#39;t have a name dictionary, so I can only help a\nlittle on the names he&#39;s given. &quot;Tarou&quot;\n&#22826;&#37070; means &quot;Eldest son&quot; or &quot;First Son&quot;.\nWhen I typed in the names in Japanese, the above is\nwhat came out. Not sure what the &quot;Jin&quot; is in the first\nand third names, but &quot;Juu&quot; means heavy\n(omoi--&#37325;&#12356;). The &quot;Gorou&quot; in the third\nmeans &quot;5th Son&quot;. \n\n&gt; Another person reccomended Reiichi as being\n&gt; &quot;Trustworthy first son&quot;. Is this correct?\n\n&#31036;&#19968;&#12288;Hmmm...&quot;Respectful First&quot; (It\ndoesn&#39;t actually contain anything like -rou that says\nson, but it&#39;s implied, really.) That&#39;s what I come up\nwith. \n\nThis may all be OBE for you--if so, sorry about that.\nBetween work travel and finding out I&#39;m going to be a\ndad, it&#39;s been a busy month.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
