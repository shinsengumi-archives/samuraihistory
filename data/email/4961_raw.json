The main\n&gt; problem \n&gt; seems to be posting from the Yahoo website (as\n&gt; opposed to composing \n&gt; an email in an email program and sending it to the\n&gt; mailing list, like \n&gt; I&#39;m doing now).\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the main problem is that even if you can see\n&gt; Japanese on \n&gt; your screen, Yahoo won&#39;t handle it properly. The\n&gt; person who is posting \n&gt; has to make sure that they change the dialog box at\n&gt; the bottom of \n&gt; the screen (the one that says &quot;What language is this\n&gt; post in?&quot;) from \n&gt; English to Japanese.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even after doing that I think that Yahoo is\n&gt; notoriously bad at this. I \n&gt; think that the only real way to solve it is to send\n&gt; an email from an \n&gt; email program.\n\nJay--\n\nI always access the list through email--never through\nthe website. The issue is that my encoding at home was\nsomehow set to &quot;Japanese-Shift JIS&quot;, and not\n&quot;Japanese-Autoselect&quot; like normal. For whatever\nreason, it wouldn&#39;t change to Autoselect when I tried\nto change it--it kept reverting back. Hence, Kitsuno&#39;s\n&quot;hara&quot; came up correctly, but the second set of\ncharacters was just random katakana. \n\nThe other issue was that somehow, Kitsuno&#39;s first post\ngot sent about 7 hours after his second. Normally\nthings get posted late if someone has to &quot;check&quot; them\nand say they are okay--since Kitsuno&#39;s a moderator\nhimself, that&#39;s not the issue. It was just....weird.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail - 50x more storage than other providers!\nhttp://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail\n\n"
