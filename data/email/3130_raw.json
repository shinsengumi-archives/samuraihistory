It was formally adopted in 1866 by the US Army.  \nIndeed, \none of the factors that brought about Custer&#39;s disastrous defeat in 1876 was \nthat he apparently disdained to bring along a Gatling gun detachment because \nit would slow  him up!  Thus,  it is entirely possible that a friendly \ncountry \nlike Meiji Japan could have been shipped some by the 1877 rebellion.  Prof \nMurf &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
