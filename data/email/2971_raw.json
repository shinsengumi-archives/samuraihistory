And besides that, you =\r\nneed a sharp soul to make sharp \nsteel (or to trim grass efficiently and el=\r\negantly).\n\nCepo, Honolulu\n\n\nOn Dec 23, 2003, at 5:41 PM, Michael Peters wro=\r\nte:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Once again the &quot;Mystical East&quot; (which is far better than the munda=\r\nne \n&gt; West )\n&gt; rears it&#39;s head.

I regularly trim my yard=\r\n with the same 1&quot; \n&gt; round\n&gt; bamboo staff that I use for practicing kendo f=\r\norms. It works better \n&gt; than\n&gt; loppers on exposed limbs.
