R. Williams&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am sending this to multiple lists so I appologize\nin advance for any \n&gt; multiple posts. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have recently commissioned a friend of mine who is\na Shodou student to \n&gt; do some Kanji work for me. However, she does not\nknow how to construct the \n&gt; scrolls once the work has been done on the rice\npaper. Does anyone on here \n&gt; know how to properly construct a scroll? Any\nassistance that you can offer \n&gt; will be muchly appreciated. \n\nI&#39;ve only made one, it was not a great job. That was\nno fault of the teacher who was an expert. It&#39;s not\nsomething you will probably get right the first time.\nYou can get them mounted in the US probably for\n$100-200 each. So if the work is valuable or a gift\nyou probably want to pay a pro or practice several\ntimes with it before mounting them. I&#39;m away from my\nbooks for a few days so I can&#39;t give really good\nreferences now. Some stores listed here though:\n\nhttp://home.comcast.net/~ronin_engineer/sumi.html\n\nI&#39;m also experimenting with unconventional mounting\nmethods that use iron activated interfacing material\nfound in fabric stores. It&#39;s a lot less messy and\ntedious than the conventional wet mounting methods and\nirons are used in traditional Japanese bookmaking so\nit might last a while. I have not developed the\nprocedure fully yet.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
