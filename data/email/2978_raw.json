It is technique. Your technique and training \nallowed you to rout the &quot;thugs&quot;.\n  As I&#39;ve studied various martial arts  for over 20 years and unfortunately \nneeded to use them on occasion, I don&#39;t REALLY need an explanation of kata. \n:)\n\nMichael\n&gt;\n&gt;In Karate, there is a several of standardized movements called Kata, and\n&gt;sparring trainning called Kumite, however there is also a meditation to be\n&gt;performed before do all of this. The effect of it was that, in time of \n&gt;need,\n&gt;when some thugs attempted to assault me and take my money late at night, it\n&gt;was just instinctive. I was not thinking in what do do if the thief do this\n&gt;or that, or in technical therms when fighting for my life. Things just went\n&gt;naturally before I even knew what was really happening and the thugs got \n&gt;out\n&gt;of there, and I was no black belt, much less any kind of &quot;super martial \n&gt;arts\n&gt;master&quot; to do anything in special.\n&gt;Just an standard trainner as any other student.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, I know it is very far than what those of ancient called as &quot;sharpness \n&gt;in\n&gt;soul&quot;, but it is a pratical example, and one does not need to believe in\n&gt;&quot;magick&quot; to perform that.
