I realize that reloading a matchlock goes much slower than nocking an arrow to a string, as I have been in many battle re-enactments w/ muzzleloaders, but the principal is the same.. as long as their is a sizeable force, volley fire is very effective, you dont hafta aim, just shoot in the general direction of the other army.. your bond to hit someone.. especially on an open field.. another good example is the battle of culloden when the scots faced the british.. the scots were armed only w/ swords, and the brits had brown besses.. a volley fire pretty much ended that battle.. so I \nthink the volley fire works better than ppl give it credit for..\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Thu, 28 Aug 2003 04:44:07\nFrom: &quot;Masamori Masami&quot; &lt;oni_shogun@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nI think its pretty safe to say that most people would disagree with \nyour military history teacher. Sure having everyone shoot at once \nmight scare an army that have never seen guns before, but they and \neveryone else who knew of guns would realize that there would be a \nlong loading time before everyone would shoot again. Your military \nhistory teacher seemed to be trying to come up with an excuse, and a \npoor one at that, to discredit Nobunaga. Not to mention that since \nvolley fire was introduced to Europe, to was utilized for hundreds \nof years, until WWI, when the machine gun was introduced. So it \nseems that many European nations thought it was a good idea.......\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\nlistowner@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; According the book &quot;The Military Revolution&quot; by Geoffrey Parker(a \n&gt; book which I no longer own, so am going by memory) Nobunaga&#39;s use \nof \n&gt; volley fire was the first of it&#39;s kind, not seen in Europe until \nthe \n&gt; 1590&#39;s.  Here is an excerpt from a research paper I wrote in 1997 \non \n&gt; the subject, for what it is worth:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What might be overlooked is that the technique used by Nobunaga \nto \n&gt; keep a continuous hail of bullets flying at the enemy [at \nNagashino] -\n&gt;  having the front row of musketeers move to the back to reload, \n&gt; allowing the next row to fire - was not even realized in Europe \nuntil \n&gt; almost twenty years after Nobunaga&#39;s application, in the 1590&#39;s. \n&gt; (Parker)&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;The Military Revolution&#39; is an excellent book and I highly \nrecommend \n&gt; it.  If anyone on this list owns it, the section on Nobunaga can \nbe \n&gt; found on page 140, where if I recall correctly he actually \nmentions \n&gt; who and where in Europe utilized volley fire for the first time in \n&gt; Europe.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an aside to this, my military history teacher, who held any in \n&gt; disdain any non-european country (in regards to pre-modern \nhistory), \n&gt; argued to me that Nobunaga&#39;s approach wasn&#39;t used until later in \n&gt; Europe because it was inferior to having everyone blast away at \nonce \n&gt; which would cause greater shock and chaos in the enemy ranks, or \n&gt; something essentially to that effect...  any thoughts on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dave Jackson \n&lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Volly fire of guns was first used in Japan at the battle of \n&gt; Nagashino in 1575. My question is, \n&gt; &gt; is this the first time it was employed anywhere? When was this \n&gt; tactic first used in Europe?\n&gt; &gt; I know the europeans were using the &quot;broadside&quot; in naval warfare \n&gt; but when was in first used\n&gt; &gt; by infantry, anyone know?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
