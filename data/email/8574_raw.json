My mother told \nme=\r\n that her family history was samurai.  She also told me about a curse \nplac=\r\ned on her/our family for the many deaths caused by them.  I am \ncurious to =\r\nknow if this was indeed true and if it was just our family \nthat was cursed=\r\n or all samurai that was cursed.  I will be honest to \nsay that the curse i=\r\ns still intact and still affects us.
