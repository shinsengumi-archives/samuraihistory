However, this was then and now is now.\n\nActually, this presents a (to me) very interesting point. It&#39;s traditional in \nJapan (or at least used to be) for smiths to purify themselves before creating a \nsword, and they had (have?) Shito shrines in their smithies. They even wore the \ntraditional priestly white when working.\n\nYet they were making swords -- the purpose of which was to kill. And death \n(along with blood) are two of the greatest pollutants in Shinto.\n\nTo me, that&#39;s a very interesting dilemma.\n\n&gt; When\n&gt; one picks up a sword of great antiquity and of historical importance, a\n&gt; sensitive and sympathetic person cannot help but be greatly impressed. T\n\nMany years ago, I had a koshigatana that had been made in 1368. The mei read \n&quot;Bishu Osafune Munemitsu saku.&quot; It was short, very slim (essentially, a katana \nat about 69% scale), with a really deep curve. I loved that sword.\n\nWhen I went off to Japan in &#39;86, I left it (along with my original ten-volume, \n1700 printing of Arai Hakuseki&#39;s &quot;Honcho Gunki-ko&quot;) with my old roommates for \nsafekeeping. A mutual friend showed up a few weeks later and told them that I&#39;d \nsaid she could hold on to them for me.\n\nNever saw &#39;em again.\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
