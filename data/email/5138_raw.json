I&#39;d always thought\nher Japanese name was &quot;Tama&quot;, no ~ko. I noticed also\nthat many of the women&#39;s names mentioned in Sansom\n(just finished volumes 1 and 2 recently) have the ~ko\nsuffix, which I always thought was a rather modern\nphenomenon, dating largely from the beginning of this\ncentury. While I know ~ko names existed back\nthroughout history, I didn&#39;t think it was all that\ncommon. And then I see &quot;Tamako&quot; instead of Tama, so\nknow I&#39;m wondering if this is a &quot;modernization&quot; after\nthe fact by some historians/authors/whomever, who\nassume that all Japanese female names have a ~ko (and\nhaven&#39;t been following pop Japanese naming trends,\nwith the proliferation of Amis, Ayumis, Ais, Hatsumis,\nJuris, Nanas, Sayuris, etc.) so they just added it on\ntheir own. I&#39;m fairly sure Mitsuhide&#39;s daughter was\n&quot;Tama&quot; with no ~ko. \n\nAny thoughts? \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nY!
