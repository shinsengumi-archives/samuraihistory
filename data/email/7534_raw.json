Most of the films here have been well \n&gt; dis=\r\ncussed, and deserve their status. While I have lots of (very) \n&gt; obscure fa=\r\nvorites, these are all benchmark films. \n&gt; 1)Seven Samurai-simply the best.=\r\n \n&gt; 2)Kwaidan-the Japanese were (and are) very superstitious, and this \n&gt; c=\r\nompilation of four macabre tales is excellent. Art direction, \n&gt; photograph=\r\ny, acting, and sound are all top notch. The highlight is \n&gt; the segment inv=\r\nolving the spirits of the Taira from the battle of Dan-\n&gt; No-Ura.\n&gt; 3)Shogu=\r\nn-yeah, the 2 hour movie version sucked. And it&#39;s loaded with \n&gt; historical=\r\n inaccuracies. But the 12 hour mini has stunning sets, \n&gt; costuming, great =\r\nacting (from the Japanese part of the cast-never \n&gt; been a Chamberlain fan)=\r\n and an involving story. Were it not for \n&gt; Shogun, much of the Western int=\r\nerest in Japanese history and cinema \n&gt; would never have happened. The King=\r\n Of Ninja Misinformation, Stephen \n&gt; Hayes, makes his split second film deb=\r\nut.\n&gt; 4)Castle of The Spider&#39;s Web (Throne Of Blood)-great performance by \n=\r\n&gt; Mifune along with Kurosawa&#39;s typically fantastic art direction and \n&gt; pho=\r\ntography. This is his samurai flavored remake of Macbeth. \n&gt; 5)Heaven & Ear=\r\nth-Some folks really hate this film. I think it&#39;s \n&gt; great. The battle scen=\r\nes are among the best ever put to screen \n&gt; (albeit relatively bloodless). =\r\nWhile the backstory of Uesugi Kenshin \n&gt; was well done, the film could have=\r\n stood a bit more of it. The \n&gt; juxtaposition of the battles with scenes of=\r\n nature is very Japanese.\n&gt; 6)Daimajin-a great samurai film all on its own,=\r\n AND you get one of \n&gt; the most convincing Japanese giant monsters too! The=\r\n evil god Majin \n&gt; inhabits the stone state of the province&#39;s protector and=\r\n mashes the \n&gt; bad guys in the closing minutes of the film. If you went int=\r\no this \n&gt; film cold, it&#39;s left up in the air whether Majin is just a legend=\r\n or \n&gt; the real thing until he makes his grand appearance.\n&gt; 7)Hanzo The Ra=\r\nzor:The Snare-a great break from the tired genre of \n&gt; noble ronin films. T=\r\nhe Hanzo films work as drama, parody, comedy and \n&gt; chambara. It&#39;s still ha=\r\nrd to believe Katsu could make such disparate \n&gt; characters as Hanzo and Za=\r\ntoichi work-it&#39;s sometimes incomprehensible \n&gt; that it&#39;s the same guy. And =\r\nspeaking of hard, the Hanzo films take \n&gt; the genre to new heights of bizar=\r\nre set pieces.\n&gt; 8)Yojimbo-set the standard for the `anti hero&#39; ronin film,=\r\n and did it \n&gt; with style.\n&gt; 9)Zatoichi & The Festival Of Fire-you could pl=\r\nug just about any \n&gt; Zatoichi film into this slot-they&#39;re basically all the=\r\n same, but \n&gt; always enjoyable. For my money, Zatoichi is the best recurrin=\r\ng \n&gt; character in Japanese cinema (other than Godzilla). The recent remake =\r\n\n&gt; is good too.\n&gt; 10)Hara Kiri-the best of the noble ronin films, the 2 =BD=\r\n hrs just fly \n&gt; by. Riveting performances and a completely believable stor=\r\ny. You&#39;ll \n&gt; be hating the Ii clan after seeing this.\n&gt; Honorable mention t=\r\no Ran and Kagemusha, both of which are classics \n&gt; but just flawed enough t=\r\no keep them out of my top 10. \n&gt; And for best Taiga drama-Toshiie & Matsu. =\r\nOK, it&#39;s a `chick&#39; Taiga \n&gt; drama, but Toshiie is such an engaging goof and=\r\n Matsu is just plain \n&gt; adorable.\n\nAwesome...I am definately going to be lo=\r\noking for some of these...thanks\n\n\n\n\n\n"
