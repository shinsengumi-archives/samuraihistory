But \n&gt; what did &quot;combat&quot; actually involve in those far-off\n&gt; days? It sure as \n&gt; hell wasn&#39;t like these neat roam-mat dojos we have\n&gt; today. They were \n&gt; fighting in the mountains, on riverbanks, tripping\n&gt; over tree roots \n&gt; and stones. The weapons they used, swords...\n&gt; spears... arrows... \n&gt; anything! You didn&#39;t even opponent would be on foot\n&gt; he could have \n&gt; came at you on horseback! How effective would any of\n&gt; our fancy \n&gt; modern sword styles have been, back then? While we\n&gt; were still edging \n&gt; our toes forward gauging the distance between our\n&gt; swords... some \n&gt; armored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with\n&gt; his spear!&quot; \n&gt;       &quot;And there are fools out there looking for\n&gt; spirityuality in \n&gt; the sword. Four hundred sword schools had opened up\n&gt; with a few years \n&gt; of the founding of the shogunate. Four hundred! But\n&gt; that didn&#39;t mean \n&gt; swordsmanship was flourishing, it just means a lot\n&gt; of bored samurai \n&gt; are selling their skills to buy rice. They can&#39;t\n&gt; offer content so \n&gt; they babble about spirit. And to keep other schools\n&gt; from stealing \n&gt; their students--their moneybags--they cooked up\n&gt; useless &quot;secret \n&gt; techniques&quot; just so they&#39;ed look different from\n&gt; other schools. Oh \n&gt; and god forbid those moneybags get hurt! Oh, no,\n&gt; it&#39;s face-guards! \n&gt; Gloves! Body Armor! Light Bamboo Swords! So what do\n&gt; you wind up \n&gt; with? Peacetime warriors who have never faced a\n&gt; naked blade; felt \n&gt; the fear of death!&quot;\n&gt;       I posted this to show one reason the samurai\n&gt; became weak and \n&gt; the martial art people in the group. I&#39;d like to\n&gt; hear what you think \n&gt; about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
