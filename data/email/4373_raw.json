It&#39;d be fairly interesting to see if they\n&gt; machi-bugyo handled the cases any differently. Where\n&gt; you&#39;d find any of this in Engish, I have no idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\nhttp://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/\n\n"
