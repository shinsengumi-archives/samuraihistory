I don&#39;t know if this could help anyway.\n&gt;&quot;the ocean&#39;s sleep stopped\n&gt;when the monster arrived\n&gt;after four toasts,\n&gt;in the night they didn&#39; sleep&quot;\n&gt;Your help would be VERY appreciate.\n\nBakumatsu is definitely not my territory, but the poem is famous. It&#39;s \nnot exactly how it has been passed onto you in Italian. The \npoem goes:\n\n\u001b$BBYJ?$NL2$j$r3P$^$9&gt;e4n@q\u001b(B\n\u001b$B$?$C$?#4GU$GLk$bL2$l$:\u001b(B\n\nIt is a style called &quot;\u001b$B682N\u001b(B&quot;, kyouka.\n\nLike most kyouka it&#39;s very hard to translate because it involves \npuns. But it says:\n\n&quot;Joukisen - wakes them up from their peaceful sleep\nWith just four cups they cannot sleep at night&quot;.\n\nAll kinds of action in here. :) This &quot;peaceful&quot; \u001b$BBYJ?\u001b(B sleep is a pun \nfor &quot;Pacific&quot; \u001b$BB@J?\u001b(B sleep - in other words not paying attention to what \nis going on across the ocean. That is probably the meaning of the \npun that the Japanese-Italian translator chose to use in his \ntranslation.\n\nJoukisen is a kind of tea. So the apparent meaning of the poem is \nthat the person who drinks 4 cups of tea is not able to sleep at \nnight.\n\nThe trick is that &quot;joukisen&quot; \u001b$B&gt;e4n@q\u001b(B also is the pronunciation of the \nword &quot;steamship&quot; \u001b$B&gt;x5$A%!!\u001b(Band 4 &quot;cups&quot; is interpreted as &quot;4 ships&quot;.\n\nSo the hidden meaning is &quot;4 steam ships wake them up from their \nPacific sleep. Now they cannot sleep at night&quot;.\n\nOf course as you know of the 4 ships only 2 of them were steamships \n- but that&#39;s just a minor detail. :)\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
