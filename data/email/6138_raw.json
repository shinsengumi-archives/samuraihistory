They tell about the famous 47 Ronin. They tell about everything about \nSamurai. From their traditions in family and war to Bushido.\nI hope that helps!

I&#39;m doing a reserch paper for English II and\n&gt; &gt; the topic\n&gt; &gt; is &quot;Bushido vs. Gang ethics.&quot;  i figure i will right\n&gt; &gt; about The Way of\n&gt; &gt; Bushido and how gangs relate, but i was wondering if\n&gt; &gt; there is\n&gt; &gt; anything else i should add.  i am also wondering if\n&gt; &gt; anyone has the\n&gt; &gt; tale of the 47 ronin?  Just let me know.\n&gt;\n&gt;Do a google search for &quot;47 Ronin&quot; or &quot;Chuushingura&quot;.\n&gt;You&#39;ll find more than you can use. Chuushingura is\n&gt;what the 47 Ronin story is called in Japanese.\n&gt;\n&gt;May I ask what your thesis is? I understand you&#39;re\n&gt;comparing the two (Bushido vs Gang) but not quite sure\n&gt;what your viewpoint is.\n&gt;\n&gt;And is English II a college course? High school?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Check out the new Yahoo!
