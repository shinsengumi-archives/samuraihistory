My purpose had two thrusts.  The question of the \nswords may end in a draw.  However,  the fact remains that in nearly ten \ncenturies,  the fatal flaw in armor,  under the arm pit,  was never addressed by \nJapanese armorers.

Any thrust, there, of course would \npenetrate either lung or deeper in the heart itself.  As far as shields are \nconcerned,  they were used at least as early as the time of the Trojan War,  \ncirca  Thirteenth Century  BC,  Jack\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
