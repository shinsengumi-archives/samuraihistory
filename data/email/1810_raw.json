It is a term I\nknow the Kukishin ryu (martial art for the Kuki\nfamily) did use, but they no longer have horsemanship\nin there curriculum.\n\nhere is a link to the ogasawa ryu who have existed for\na few hundred years now. Page is in Japanese and\nenglish\n\nhttp://www.ogasawara-ryu.gr.jp/\n\nPaul\n\n\n--- Scott &lt;scottc_4@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nThere are only 2 terms for horsemanhip that I know of.\n Bajutsu was \nthe art of horsemanship.  I believe it included\nriding, mounted \narchery, using horses in water, and a variety of other\nskills with \nhorses.  The other term is Yabusame.  It is the modern\n,competative\n(it thik) form of mounted archery in which the\nparticipants are to \nfire blunted arrows at 3 consecutive targets at a full\ngallop.\n\n\nYahoo!
