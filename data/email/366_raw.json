I have to disagree.  There are all kinds\nof ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise movement\nor position.  This is simply not true.  The Samurai\nwhen going in to combat without armor preffered to\nwere there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.  This\nallowed full movement without tripping on the hakama\nitself.(anyone who practices Aikido has had this\nhappen)  When wearing armor they didn&#39;t even wear\nhakama so it did not apply.\n\nThe Word &quot;ninja&quot; is not hstorically correct and\nneither is their movie incarnation.  They were usually\nreffered to as Shinobi and originally were not as\nspecialized as the movies make them appear.  They were\nused to set fire to enemy encampments and castles in\norder to cause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they would\nbe employed to kill.  But I have heard of very few if\nany cases with the latter.  A good book on the subject\nof the origin and truths behind the &quot;Ninja&quot; is Stephen\nTurnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold of and\nhas to be ordered from Europe but is worth the price.\n\nThere are alot of myths regarding the history of the\nMartial arts.(Ninja Especially)\n\nIf anyone looks back through the emails they will find\nan explanation given by me on the general usage of the\nhakama as well as from Anthony J. Bryant, Both of\nthese are good.  There was really nothing mysterious\nabout it.  If you look at the clothing from the yayoi\nperiod forward you will see similarity&#39;s leading to\nthe advent of the Hakama.  The Japanese as with every\nothr nation were very practical in the development of\ntheir clothing.  A good example of this is the Long\nHakama worn in the Shoguns palace during the Tokugawa\nperiod which restricted movement making attacks on\nothers impossible.  Also the short hakama worn in the\nSummer by some foot soldiers and attendants in the\nkamakura period.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMusashi\n\nP.s. I left out alot of other examples.  \n\n\n--- KUM0 &lt;kum0@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Konnichi-wa,\n&gt; \n&gt; It has been my experience of martial arts (for 11\n&gt; years, through 8 different arts), that the samurai\n&gt; used to wear them for all\n&gt; of the above purposes, but also for one other.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a sitting posture that the ninja adopted\n&gt; when impersonating a samurai, so that it was easy to\n&gt; move if attacked\n&gt; unexpectantly, or preparing to attack unexpectantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although I can&#39;t reveal the seated posture, I can,\n&gt; however, tell you about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; This seated posture looks identical to the casual\n&gt; seated posture in modern day Japan, with the legs\n&gt; crossed at the shins, and\n&gt; knees almost resting on the ankles.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is still alive in martial arts that have\n&gt; techniques adopted from the samurai arts. The hakama\n&gt; hid whether or not they\n&gt; were seated like this in particular, or  _however_ \n&gt; they were seated in fact.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kumo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Natsu Kusa Ya\n&gt; Tsuamono Domo Ga\n&gt; Yume No Ato\n&gt; \n&gt; Basho.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; \n&gt; From: konos\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides it&#39;s ocassional apperance at the Edo Period\n&gt; and in the hitatare of 12th century, hakama is not\n&gt; obligatory. It&#39;s not a\n&gt; daimyo&#39;s command. Nevertheless samurai were more or\n&gt; less obliged to follow the &quot;rich and famous&quot; status\n&gt; of the court they were\n&gt; implicated in. First of all samurai were warriors.\n&gt; So even the obi was the right dressing only if it\n&gt; could carry tanto or\n&gt; wakizashi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings from Greece, especially to Amphipolis.\n&gt; Konstantinos\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
