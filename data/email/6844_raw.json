I was informed by some \n&gt; of you that the one form of vampire is the ghost woman who sucks the \n&gt; blood of children during the night. \n&gt; \n&gt; I remember hearing or reading I think about female vampires who \n&gt; stalked lords and dranktheir blood. The only guise they had was cat  \n&gt; and when in it you could tell them apart from an ordinary cat by the \n&gt; two tails they had instead of just one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anybody know about this? I&#39;ve looked and looked around but \n&gt; haven&#39;t found this information again. Help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rod\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
