It wasn&#39;t for keeping the sam=\r\nurai down, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for keeping them &quot;up.&quot; That is, in a society without\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; any wars, if you have a military class, you have to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have some ra=\r\ntional or emotional justification for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuing their benefits. Bush=\r\nido made the samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out to be more than just a soldier, and so attem=\r\npted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I guess successfully) to justify his existence in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the non=\r\n-warring period. Kinda like for america, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we don&#39;t have any perceiv=\r\ned military threats, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want to cut military spending. So what does t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; military do? Come up with all the &quot;be all you can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be&quot; and &quot;a=\r\nrmy of one&quot; and &quot;we&#39;re looking for a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good men&quot; advertising campai=\r\ngns... which glorifies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the military in the public&#39;s eye, and gives it=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose apart from war... namely the bettering of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our citize=\r\nns by education and experience. Bushido\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made samurai out to be &quot;honor=\r\nable citizens&quot; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something to that effect...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All sounds abou=\r\nt right to me. But what I meant was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that the bushido\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was used=\r\n to keep samurai down in the edo jidai (i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know it wasnt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aroun=\r\nd earlier... im glad you do, because on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; message board right\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; now ive got a heated discussion on my hands with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone who\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; disagrees.).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a conspiracy the way we think\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; about it... but it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a useful tool utilized in this way\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n nonetheless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;midorinotoradesu&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;bkirkham@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now Kyle, I lik=\r\ne that.

I&#39;m not an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expert, so I hope Tony will corre=\r\nct me if I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way off.  I do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the practice of=\r\n one on one combat existed in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; early samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; period.  Ev=\r\nen in the Gempei war many challanges\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were shouted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foes\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; based on the existing honor system.  Many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai did call out=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lineage before a battle.  Although it seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsilly to us now, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to remember how isolated Japan w=\r\nas from the rest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had a system of=\r\n fighting wars that was very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different than any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other...Unt=\r\nil the Mongols invaded.  Then the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai began to wise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up.=\r\n  &quot;Hey, these Mongols don&#39;t really care about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our family do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhey?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My understanding is that the Japanese were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; totally un=\r\nprepared to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight a war with an organized mongolian military\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; machine.  The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the samurai were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prepared the second time, and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prepa=\r\nrations/strategic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that followed changed the =\r\nface of Samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warfare.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Into the Sengoku is when=\r\n Ashigaru are much more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apparent in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; armies.  Long after=\r\n the lineage practice had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been proven unwise by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mongols=\r\n (I know, they were actually Korean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Chinese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conscripts)=\r\n.  So at this point I can&#39;t see them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing it either.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Many years later, after a couple hundred years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of peace, under t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about th=\r\ne point\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bushido is crystalized into what we know tod=\r\nay.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prior to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peaceful Edo Jidai, much of the &quot;honor syt=\r\nem&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high and holy precepts th=\r\nat everyone thinks the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samurai lived by.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was onl=\r\ny in the last years of the samurai that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the bushido code\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; woul=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; influence the population.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess, I too ge=\r\nt a little sick of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generalizations.  I recently\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; to a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Kensei.  We\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; informed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido\n&gt; &gt; &gt; co=\r\nde.  They were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warriors and role models that were bound by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhonor to better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; society.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They helped everyone gain greate=\r\nr understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by standing for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peace, justice, and the Ame=\r\nrican way (well, they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t really say\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that, but they migh=\r\nt as well have).  Upon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hearing this, I could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were good and bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Samurai.  They didn&#39;t all live honorable and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they Bushido code\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; affect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; must agree that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had some system of honor.  How els=\r\ne could we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quantify a good or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; samurai?  But it =\r\nwasn&#39;t &quot;Bushido&quot; persay.  Since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Bushido&quot; did not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist in =\r\nthe Sengoku, it probably wasn&#39;t used to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; keep the troops\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their troops but =\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been much more simple and less dubious than\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; you presume.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Promises of fame and fortune, political status,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; social status,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pride,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and land are other methods t=\r\nhat could be used to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain loyalty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In short, I =\r\ndon&#39;t think that there was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; universal conspiracy by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leader=\r\ns of the time, to devise a system to keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a brotha down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was not the &quot;purpose&quot; of honor or bushido,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; although it (li=\r\nke\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else) could be perverted and warped to serve\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sinister means.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brandon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kyle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Segall&quot; &lt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; klanceseg=\r\nall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Try a little more than Shogun.
