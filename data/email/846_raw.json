and I&#39;m from Washington in Tyne & Wear.It&#39;s pointless descibing myself so I will   \n               ask around first for the North Herts scale modelling club and then for you.It would be great to meet up\n               with you and any other fellow members of the samuraihistory group.\n               As you already know I am interested in the battle of Nagashino (Shidarahara) and own Ospreys\n               Campaign Book No.69 &quot;Nagashino 1575 (Slaughter at the Barricades) writen by Stephen Turnbull&quot;.\n               This book is of great value in my research,but the battlefield diagram on page 70-71 shows the charge\n               and Sakai Tadatsugu as being on the right flank behind Okubu Tadayo.This is misleading as Sakai\n               was in overall command of the raiding party on the forts of Tobigasuyama.\n               I am also having problems acounting for all the troops involved in the battle.As yet I have only\n               researched the Oda/Tokugawa contingents as follows.................................................................\n               Mizuno Nobumoto.........................................................................................................1,000 men\n               Sakuma Nobumori.........................................................................................................2,000 men\n               Niwa Nagahide..............................................................................................................2,000 men\n               Oda Nobunaga..............................................................................................................4,000 men\n               Hashiba Hideyoshi.........................................................................................................2,000 men\n               Takigawa Kazumasu.....................................................................................................2,000 men\n               Torii Mototada...............................................................................................................  800 men\n               Tokugawa Nobuyasu.....................................................................................................1,000 men\n               Ishikawa Kazumasa......................................................................................................1,000 men\n               Tokugawa Ieyasu..........................................................................................................2,000 men\n               Honda Takakatsu...........................................................................................................1,000 men\n               Sakakibara Yasumasa...................................................................................................1,000 men\n               Osuka Yasutaka.............................................................................................................1,000 men\n               Okubo Tadayo...............................................................................................................1,000 men\n               Est.Total of Troops in battle line...................................................................................21,800 men\n               Add to this the Arquebus Corps......................................................................................3,000 men\n               The Raiding Party..........................................................................................................3,000 men\n               The Rear Guard.............................................................................................................4,000 men\n               Shibata Katsuie.............................................................................................................2,000 men\n               This gives an est.grand total of....................................................................................33,800 men\n\n               In the text Shibata Katsuie is mentioned as supporting Hashiba Hideyoshi when the Takeda\n               cavalry under the command of the Sanada brothers managed to break through into the Oda\n               lines where they engaged in hand-to-hand combat for a short time before being killed.\n               Unfortunately there is no mention of him being in charge of any contingent,but being one of\n               Oda Nobunaga&#39;s Fudai-shu (Hereditary Vassals) along with Niwa Nagahide and Sakuma\n               Nobumori who both had positions in the battle line,surely Shibata Katsuie had the same amount\n               of men under his command and was given a position on the battlefield.\n               It is estimated that Oda Nobunaga had 30,000 men and that Tokugawa Ieyasu had 8,000 men\n               which gives me a shortfall even allowing for (Shibata Katsuie having 2,000 men) of 4,200 men.\n               I realise that the mounted samurai of the allied sides fought dismounted during the 8 hour \n               battle supporting the ashigaru spear and arquebus in their position behind the palisade fence\n               and only mounted for the pursuit of the Takeda once these had begun their retreat.\n               Are these unaccounted men therefore horse holders for the dismounted samurai ?\n               Of the Tozama-shu (the &quot;Outer Lords&quot;) only Takigawa Kazumasu is mentioned and given a \n               position in the battle line, so where were the others &quot;Nagaoka Fujitaka,Akechi Mitsuhide,\n               Ando Noritoshi and Mori Yoshinari&quot;.\n               My last question concerns the colours of various sashimono&#39;s, the samuraihistory group\n               have provided the mons of the lords and their clans, but what of the colours ?\n               Was Tokugawa Nobuyasu&#39;s mon the same as his fathers at the battle and was Hashiba\n               Hideyoshi&#39;s mon the same as his later Toyotomi mon.\n               Sorry this has been so long winded,but I do need this information!!!\n               See you on Sunday at the Royal Armouries at Leeds.\n\n                                                                                                                           Ray King.\n                \n               \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
