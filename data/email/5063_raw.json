During his travels as an \noil merchant himself, he ran into a friend from his days as a monk at \nmyoukakuji, who was now an abbot at the Jouzaiji temple in Mino \nprovince.  The abbot was a relative of the Nagai clan, which was \nserving the Shugo of Mino, the Toki clan.  Through the abbot, \nShinzaemonjou gained employment with Nagai Nagahiro, and quickly rose \nthrough the Nagai ranks, eventually taking the surname of Nagai.  In \n1525, he assisted Nagahiro in subduing both the Toki clan (the Shugo) \nand the Saito clan (the Shugo-dai) in a coup.  In 1533, Dousan, who \nat this time was known as Nagai Shinkurou Norihide, succeeded his \nfather, and killed his father&#39;s benefactor, Nagai Nagahiro, and took \npossesion of Inabayama castle from him.&quot;\n\nIs it too much to ask for an english source or two??  :P\n\nOne website says: &quot;The castle was once called Inabayama Castle. The \narea has been a strategic point for centuries given its close \nproximity to Sekigahara, a mountain pass through which trade and \ncommunication routes link eastern and western Japan. Saito Dosan, a \nonetime resident of Mt. Kinka, once said &quot;If you control Sekigahara, \nyou control Japan.&quot; Taken by Nagai Sinzaemon in 1525 his retainer \nSaito Dosan usurped him in 1542 and ruled the area until Yoshiatsu, \nSaito&#39;s son, killed his father in a battle on the banks of the Nagara \nRiver.&quot; (http://www.asahi-u.ac.jp/kagai/kokusai/gifuchina/gifu-\neng/history.htm)\n\nHowever the history book I&#39;m reading seems to be saying that his \nfather was Nagai Shinzaemon, and I cant find any other sources to \nconfirm or deny this, or the fact that it was dousan&#39;s father, and \nnot dousan himself who was the oil merchant. \n\n\n"
