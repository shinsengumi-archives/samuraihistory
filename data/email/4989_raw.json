He \n&gt; &gt;says, &quot;Hara-Kiri is what you do to a fish, seppuku\n&gt; is what a man does \n&gt; &gt;to himself.&quot; While poetic, I thought perhaps he was\n&gt; joking, but he \n&gt; &gt;insists calling ritual suicide &#39;hara-kiri&#39; is a\n&gt; Western \n&gt; &gt;misunderstanding. According to him, the proper term\n&gt; is seppuku.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lilith,\n&gt; Unfortunately (or fortunately) being a native\n&gt; speaker doesn&#39;t mean \n&gt; that you automatically know everything about your\n&gt; language. I know \n&gt; that is certainly the case for me and English.\n&gt; \n&gt; Harakiri is a perfectly legitimate (and old) word\n&gt; referring to ritual \n&gt; suicide. Of course it is a bit crude, which may be\n&gt; where your husband \n&gt; is coming from in saying that it&#39;s better to use the\n&gt; word to refer to \n&gt; animals. But it can&#39;t be denied that hara-kiri is\n&gt; perfectly natural \n&gt; and not a Western misunderstanding. \n\nThe thought that came to mind immediately upon reading\nthis is the Japanese habit of subjective translation.\nAll of you students of the language must have at one\ntime or another asked for the word for certain\nsubjects, let&#39;s call them &quot;naughty&quot; words or whatever,\nonly to be told that the Japanese &quot;don&#39;t have those\nkinds of words&quot;, or that various anatomical parts are\nreferred to as &quot;asoko&quot;, &quot;over there&quot; or &quot;that place&quot;,\nrather than having a specific slang word for male or\nfemale distinctive parts. Or that there aren&#39;t\nequivalent expressions to the English &quot;F you&quot;, etc. \n\nWell, spend 6 months in Japan and you learn that there\ncertainly ARE words for &quot;naughty bits&quot; or ways to\nexpress the &quot;F you&quot; phrase. In the interest of keeping\nthis a family site, we won&#39;t go into it--it&#39;s not\nimportant to the subject. But your comments to Lilith\nmade me think that perhaps it&#39;s a situation of the\nnative speaker telling you the way you SHOULD say\nthings, instead of the way they MAY be said. \n\nI also think that you could extrapolate that\n&quot;hara-kiri&quot; means cutting a belly, whether it be a\nman&#39;s belly, a fish&#39;s belly, a porkbelly, etc.\n&quot;Seppuku&quot; is specifically and only the act of killing\nyourself by cutting open your stomach. That&#39;s probably\nsupported by the fact that the word for suicide,\n&quot;Jisatsu&quot;, is different than seppuku.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
