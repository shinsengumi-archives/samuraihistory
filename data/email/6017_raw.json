Can&#39;t you see we&#39;re trying to\nkeep this as uneducational as possible? And here you\ncome along with...a QUESTION! Ah!\n\nAre you asking for where the kana spacings are? or are\nyou looking for the kanji? I&#39;ve got to be honest, I&#39;ve\nnever seen the kanji...and just now typing it into the\ncomputer, none came out that I would recognize as\nhaving anything to do with either the current or\noriginal meanings. BUT, if I&#39;m not entirely off my\nrocker today, I believe it&#39;s sa-yo-na-ra. It could be\nsa-yo-u-na-ra, but I don&#39;t *THINK* it is. I think I\njust unintentionally lengthen the *yo* out of habit.\nAnd wouldn&#39;t you know I&#39;d left all my dictionaries at\nhome today. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nAll your favorites on one personal page ï¿½ Try My Yahoo!\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
