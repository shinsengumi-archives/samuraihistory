I have same \nproblem.  I searched for universities doing Japanese history maybe \nthis link will help ucas courses in Japanese \nhttp://search.ucas.co.uk/cgi-\nbin/hsrun.hse/search/cs2002/StateId/SWOF4ceLfru0zjGbsoww_kYWVbiHE-3vJ-\n/HAHTpage/cs2002.Hsindex10.run?r=N&i=N&a=36 It should work all Japan \ncourses.  Specific history Im unsure I saw Sheffield does a course my \nfriends there she recommends the university.  University of Leeds \nalso does a course. Leeds is fantastic my sisters there.  I don&#39;t \nknow what course is like but the place rocks.  Sorry this is a bit \noff the subject.  Well Takeda Shingen then hmmm.  Oh well back to \nquestion.  In my opinion I&#39;d forget university and go to Japan as the \nbooks you get in university are not as good as Japanese books.  Plus \nyou can buy the books on the net or whatever.  At Leicester I have \nfound about 20 decent books ones hidden away in a dark corner \nincluding Farris, Friday, jansen, Turnbull- yes but no I avoid, Ooms \nand Sansom-classix etc. Anyway good luck I&#39;d look at ucas and search \nbut unless your parents object consider going to Japan and if they do \nwell do it anyway if your serious. Also just remembered you gotta go \nto the royal armouries in Leeds it has fantastic bushi exhibits, some \narmour 15 suits, and it emphazises the buke as a horse back archer.  \nI have visited three times spoke to curartor Ian Bottomley who wrote \nbook arms and armour of the samurai, nice guy saw bit behind the \nscenes. I took 75 photos that&#39;s how damn good it was.  P.S I don&#39;t \nlive in Leeds just like the place !!! \n\nAll the best Mark   \n\n\n\n"
