One can establish links fairly easily from most =\r\ncultures, wars, leader, religions, e.g the above, if one wishes to find the=\r\nm, but I think it&#39;s a little redundant merely to say and think that. For ex=\r\nample, I began my thesis with a crique of Karl Marx. In his Grundrisse, he =\r\naskes would Achilles be possible with powder and lead? Part of my thesis li=\r\nes in me comparing the warriors of the Illiad and those of the Samurai to a=\r\nrgue yes, an &#39;Achilles&#39; type of hero was indeed possible in the age of guns=\r\n: e.g the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, or the Satuma rebellion which is the=\r\n event, and its leader of the discussion, also, I think its interesting to =\r\nnote, that Marx died five years after the Satsume rebellion, an interesting=\r\n illustration to demonstrate that Western thinking rarely glanced Easrwards=\r\n to the Japans (though Nietzsche does say he would move there if he had the=\r\n capital). But merely to say that the Greek warriors and Samurai warriors a=\r\nre similar is not very groundbreaking.\n\n \n\nWhat I am suggesting is that whi=\r\nle it is interesting merely to look and compare cultures, Japan of this per=\r\niod and the American Civil War are too areas of deep historical interest to=\r\no me, we should be looking at what we can learn from such comparisons. \n\n \n=\r\n\nWhat does it tell us? \n\nHow does a comparison help our understanding?\n\n \n\n=\r\nWhat makes a man challenge the governement?\n\nWhat makes a man lead a rebell=\r\nion killing his own people?\n\nLook at the power of the ideologies, are there=\r\n common ideas, what does this tell us about these men?\n\nLook at the literat=\r\nure is closer detail, history is written by the victor, and both Lee and Sa=\r\nigo were heroic losers.\n\n \n\nA book by Cliford Geertz, &#39;The Interpretation o=\r\nf Cultures&#39; from the 70&#39;s may prove interesting to the some members.\n\n \n\nJu=\r\nst a few ideas...\n\n \n\nTom Dowling, BA; MA (Hons)\n\ntle\n\n\n\n\n\n________________=\r\n_________________________________________________\nView your Twitter and Fli=\r\nckr updates from one place =96 Learn more!\nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/go/1379=\r\n84870/direct/01/\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
