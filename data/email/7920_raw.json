It drives \nm=\r\ne crazy\n&gt; reading a response then having to go down into the email to figur=\r\ne \nout what\n&gt; they are responding to.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s stop the top posting, OK=\r\n?  Do what Nate and Tony do, post \nbelow each\n&gt; section you are responding =\r\nto. Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------\n&gt; I&#39;ll do the best that I can, tho=\r\nugh I&#39;ve noticed that others also \nhave this\n&gt; problem. I do snip out the p=\r\narts of previous postings that aren&#39;t \nrelevant,\n&gt; which I&#39;ve noticed some =\r\nothers don&#39;t do. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have Outlook, and it&#39;s difficult, but if it&#39;s real=\r\nly so very, \nvery\n&gt; important, then I&#39;ll try to remember to cut-and-paste a=\r\nnd move the \noriginal\n&gt; posting to the top and my comments to the bottom. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Though I will NOT be able to put my comments below each section \nthat =\r\nI&#39;m\n&gt; responding to. Outlook isn&#39;t set up to allow people to do that, so \nI=\r\n would\n&gt; have to format it by hand.  Which might be convenient for you but =\r\n\nis quite\n&gt; time-consuming and inconvenient to those who have to do this\n&gt; =\r\nhand-formatting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina\n&gt;\n\nIt wasn&#39;t aimed at you directly, just a gener=\r\nal comment - and I&#39;m \nnot in attack mode :-D And I use outlook express, and=\r\n I can&#39;t \nimagine it is that much different from Outlook, so I am at a loss=\r\n as \nto what exactly the problem is.  When I hit &#39;reply&#39; in outlook \nexpres=\r\ns, the original text is there with all the &gt;&gt;&gt; and then I can \nscroll to wh=\r\nerever I want, click just below the section of text I \nwant to respond to, =\r\nhit enter a few times, and voila, I have space \nto commment. I guess you ar=\r\ne saying that in Outlook you can&#39;t touch \nthe text you are replying to, and=\r\n have to type at the top?  Sounds \nlike a poor excuse for an email system (=\r\nsorry to the Bill Gates fans \nout there) It isn&#39;t a HUGE deal or anything s=\r\no don&#39;t lose any sleep \nover it, but it does keep the format standardized a=\r\nnd is easier to \nfollow.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
