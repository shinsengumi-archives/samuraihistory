Instead of looking backward to try to re-establish older samurai traditions, the Tokugawa shogunate was trying to establish a brand new innovative model for samurai: to rein in these unruly samurai and convert them from bloodthirsty sengoku-jidai marauders into nice Tokugawa bureaucrats. That is just my own uneducated guess, as I have not read Bushido Shoshinshu.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSince one of my Japanese teachers called the Sengoku-jidai &#39;the age of \nbetrayal&#39;, teaching underlings to be loyal to their superiors had a lot \nto do with the introduction of this code post period. They didn&#39;t want \nany one else getting any ideas after all!\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
