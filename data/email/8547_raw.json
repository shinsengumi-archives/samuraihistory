Tsutomo Tamura, president =\r\nof the Japan Maritime Self \nDefense Force (JMSDF) Staff College, saw firsth=\r\nand the U.S. Navy&#39;s \nquality craftsmanship in action when they visited USS =\r\nKitty Hawk (CV \n63) March 7. \n\nTamura and Yoshihara were invited to visit C=\r\nommander, Fleet \nActivities, Yokosuka and Kitty Hawk by Rear Adm. James D. =\r\nKelly, \ncommander, Naval Forces Japan. Kelly, who has a deep interest in th=\r\ne \nJapanese culture and swordmaking, was eager to have Tamura and \nYoshihar=\r\na visit and see what U.S. 7th Fleet American Sailors do.\n\n&quot;It was a great h=\r\nonor to have Vice Adm. Tamura and Mr. Yoshihara \naboard Kitty Hawk,&quot; said C=\r\napt. Ed McNamee, Kitty Hawk commanding \nofficer, who led the tour.\n\nMcNamee=\r\n kicked off the ship tour with a brief in Kitty Hawk&#39;s combat \ndirection ce=\r\nnter. Following the brief, the group visited the ship&#39;s \nflight deck.\n\n&quot;Bec=\r\nause the ship is undergoing maintenance right now, it was a \ngreat opportun=\r\nity to show off a lot of work being done by our \nSailors, Japanese contract=\r\nors and Ship&#39;s Repair Facility (SRF) \npersonnel,&quot; said McNamee.\n\nFollowing =\r\na tour of the flight deck, Tamura and Yoshihara visited \nthe ship&#39;s No. 4 M=\r\nain Machinery Room.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t know how many Sailors it takes to keep a shi=\r\np this size \noperating, such as on the flight deck and in engineering,&quot; sai=\r\nd \nYoshihara.\n\n&quot;It was a great honor to have Vice Adm. Tamura and a craftsm=\r\nan of \nMr.Yoshihara&#39;s caliber visit our propulsion plant,&quot; said Capt. Pete =\r\n\nSchupp, Kitty Hawk&#39;s chief engineer.\n\nSchupp, along with McNamee, led Tamu=\r\nra and Yoshihara to see No. 4 \nmain condenser in the process of being re-tu=\r\nbed, a significant \namount of maintenance on a boiler water drum. \n\n&quot;We&#39;re =\r\ncurrently undergoing considerable work, so we had the \nopportunity to highl=\r\night the work of our Japanese contractors, SRF \nworkers, and Kitty Hawk Sai=\r\nlors,&quot; Schupp added.\n\n&quot;I was surprised to learn and see how young most of t=\r\nhe Sailors are \naboard the ship,&quot; said Yoshihara. \n\nBorn in 1945, Yoshihara=\r\n started making swords at the age of 12. \nSince then he has become recogniz=\r\ned as one of Japan&#39;s finest master \nswordmakers. \n\n&quot;There was much I didn&#39;t=\r\n know about the closeness of the cooperation \nbetween the JMSDF and the U.S=\r\n. Navy,&quot; said Yoshihara, &quot;and how much \nwork our Sailors do together.&quot;\n\nThe=\r\n Kitty Hawk Strike Group is the largest carrier strike group in \nthe Navy a=\r\nnd is composed of the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, Carrier \nAir Wing (CVW) =\r\n5, the guided-missile cruisers USS Chancellorsville \n(CG 62) and USS Cowpen=\r\ns (CG 63), and Destroyer Squadron 15. \n\nTo find more news about the Kitty H=\r\nawk Strike Group, visit the Navy \nNewsStand at www.news.navy.mil/local/cv63=\r\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
