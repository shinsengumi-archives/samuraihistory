Well, anyway I also thought it was a good \nmovie. It was \n&gt; quit touching. I went to go see it with my friends when it first \ncame out, \n&gt; they try to act as if they are tough, but when we walked out of \nthe theater they \n&gt; were balling their eyes out. We dont talk about that to this day \nthough. Yeah \n&gt; it was a good movie.\n&gt;  -Matthew Upton\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
