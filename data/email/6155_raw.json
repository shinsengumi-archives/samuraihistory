Good book.  (And I didn&#39;t\neven know the author was here when I signed onto the list.)  Particularly\ninteresting to you, I would guess, because of the period it covers - Japan\nduring Queen Elizabeth&#39;s time (God save her).\n\tNow knowing your dramatic background, and knowing that this isn&#39;t your\nusual milieu (Pilot Adams, I presume?  -Sorry, that&#39;s a kind of &#39;Shogun&#39;\njoke), let me commend to your attention a few films for general &#39;feel&#39;.\nNone of these is actual history, of course.  But there&#39;s lots (and lots and\nLOTS) of crrrap out there, and it&#39;s easy to get lost in delusions based on\nbad period drama.  You know how it goes.  (A perfectly pleasant and\nintelligent soul recently said here that &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; seemed to be\nreasonably historical, for example, provoking uncontrollable fits of\nlaughter from Tony.)  So here&#39;s some _good_ period drama, by way of\ncontrast.\n...It&#39;ll be interesting to see how this list goes over on this list, in\nfact. (By the way, I have to admit here and now to a sneaking fondness for\nthe manga of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; (I&#39;ve seen nothing of the anime, so have no\nopinion), but let&#39;s say I&#39;ve ...reserved judgement ...on any historical\ndetails I came across in the storyline...)\n\n\t\tStuff by Kurosawa Akira (look under &#39;K&#39;, not &#39;A&#39;)\nSeven Samurai\nHidden Fortress\n\t...both set in the Warring States period (roughly while Gloriana sat the\nthrone of England)\nYojimbo\nSanjuro\n\t...some centuries later - these are bloody hilarious:  and I mean both.  As\nI recall, these are set in the mid-1800s.\n\n\tStuff by Inagaki Hiroshi (under &#39;I&#39;, not &#39;H&#39;)\nChushingura\n...set about 1700 -the archetypal samurai epic:  the 47 Ronin done on the\nscale of &#39;Gone With The Wind&#39; - think of it as the Japanese cultural\nequivalent to Thermopylae, the Alamo, the Titanic, and the Easter Uprising\nall rolled into one.  This film is long and slow, and it&#39;s hard for a gaijin\n(at least) to keep track of everybody the first time or two through it...\nbut it&#39;s wonderful for all that.  Many of the shots were taken directly from\nclassic woodcuts of the episode.\nThe Samurai Trilogy\n...a popularised (and fairly implausible) version of the life of Musashi\nMiyamoto, author of the Book of Five Rings (or Spheres)... arguably the\ngreatest of the samurai.  (I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s referred to as &quot;Kensei&quot; in Japan,\nand if someone would give me a more clear definition of that than Harris&#39;s\n&quot;sword-saint&quot; I would be most grateful.)  Matt, I&#39;ve made the better part of\na life&#39;s study of this work.  Strong talk from an Arrogant Son-Of-a-Bitch\nlike me, you may note.  I carry a small copy of the book on me the way some\nfolks carry a Bible, and I have never exhausted what I can learn from it.\nIf I ever achieve a fraction of Musashi&#39;s mastery, I will regard myself as\nfortunate beyond my deserts.\n...Now don&#39;t expect this trilogy to make a hell of a lot of sense in terms\nof sequential plot line unless you&#39;ve read the lengthy book on which it&#39;s\nbased, but it&#39;s beautifully made and it&#39;s packed with a zillion little\nperiod details.  The novel was written and serialised in the 1930s, and\nreflects some of the most impressively developed virgin/whore dichotomy I&#39;ve\never seen anywhere.\n\n\tNow then:  if Kitsuno (the list-owner:  a Mysterious Figure with whom I&#39;ve\nnever exchanged a post:  some say he&#39;s really a fox spirit), or Tony, Nate,\nDean or any of you other elitist, ASOB lot have some suggestions I&#39;ve\nmissed, I&#39;d be only too happy for the recommendation.  I&#39;ve just about got\nthe ones I&#39;ve listed memorised already.  (I only pray I&#39;m not opening a\nfloodgate of raving fandom.)\n\tGereg\n\n\n"
