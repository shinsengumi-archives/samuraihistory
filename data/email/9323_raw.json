Also about the long sword to which you refer, you may \n&gt;be confusing this with that used by Sasaki Ganryu in their famous duel. \n&gt;Sasaki was reputed to have a very long sword called the &quot;Swallow Cutter&quot; I \n&gt;believe.\n&gt;Regards\n&gt;Clive Sinclaire\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Barry Thomas\n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, January 20, 2007 1:33 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Nihonto\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Martin,\n&gt;\n&gt;   There is no substitute for real knowledge - go here to begin your quest:\n&gt;   http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\n&gt;   And above all, buy books if you have a serious rather than a casual \n&gt;approach to katana...\n&gt;\n&gt;   To answer your questions:\n&gt;   - Simply, katana are made of &quot;steel&quot; steel. Pure iron with 0.8% carbon \n&gt;added is tool steel, comparable to the edge steel of a katana. The hardness \n&gt;of iron/steel is manipulated by varying the carbon content and heat \n&gt;treating appropriately. Modern steels are alloys with elements other than \n&gt;carbon also added.\n&gt;   - Katana have never weighed 50 lbs!!! I have just gone and got out a ca \n&gt;1700 katana. It weighed 1 1/2 lbs (700 grams). It is about an average size. \n&gt;In a temple in Japan there is a katana 6 foot or more long. It might weight \n&gt;5 lbs, but it is a votive offering to the Gods and not a serious combat \n&gt;sword.\n&gt;   - Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s sword?? No idea...\n&gt;\n&gt;   Best regards,\n&gt;   Barry Thomas\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: MNcoffey@...\n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, January 20, 2007 7:16 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Nihonto\n&gt;\n&gt;   I have been doing research on real Japanese katana and have only ended\n&gt;   up confusing myself even more, so I thought I would ask everybody here\n&gt;   my two questions. First question, what kind of steels were the katana\n&gt;   made of. second question, this one I have been arguing about with a\n&gt;   friend of mine, he says that katana back then could weigh up to 50lbs!\n&gt;   I say up to 5lbs, so I was hoping somebody could answer that. And I\n&gt;   more question I&#39;ve read on the Internet that Miyamoto Musashi used a\n&gt;   bigger katana than most people and I was wandering if that is true.\n&gt;   Thanks.-Martin\n&gt;\n&gt;   .\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWindows-ty�p�yt�haun avulla l�yd�t tiedot koneeltasi silm�nr�p�yksess�. \nhttp://toolbar.msn.fi\n\n\n"
