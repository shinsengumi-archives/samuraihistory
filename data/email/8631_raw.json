I have\n&gt; and my nose was broken twice and lower jaw was\n&gt; dislocated once. Modern Japanese Martial Arts are\n&gt; not\n&gt; for the hedonist. You don&#39;t have to face a blade to\n&gt; be\n&gt; strong or brave. \n&gt; Ijin Mibu &lt;ijinmibu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;      &quot;The sword was never more necessary in\n&gt; Japan&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; History than it \n&gt; &gt; was five hundred years ago, in that era of strife\n&gt; &gt; and civil war. But \n&gt; &gt; what did &quot;combat&quot; actually involve in those\n&gt; far-off\n&gt; &gt; days? It sure as \n&gt; &gt; hell wasn&#39;t like these neat roam-mat dojos we have\n&gt; &gt; today. They were \n&gt; &gt; fighting in the mountains, on riverbanks, tripping\n&gt; &gt; over tree roots \n&gt; &gt; and stones. The weapons they used, swords...\n&gt; &gt; spears... arrows... \n&gt; &gt; anything! You didn&#39;t even opponent would be on\n&gt; foot\n&gt; &gt; he could have \n&gt; &gt; came at you on horseback! How effective would any\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; our fancy \n&gt; &gt; modern sword styles have been, back then? While we\n&gt; &gt; were still edging \n&gt; &gt; our toes forward gauging the distance between our\n&gt; &gt; swords... some \n&gt; &gt; armored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with\n&gt; &gt; his spear!&quot; \n&gt; &gt;       &quot;And there are fools out there looking for\n&gt; &gt; spirityuality in \n&gt; &gt; the sword. Four hundred sword schools had opened\n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; with a few years \n&gt; &gt; of the founding of the shogunate. Four hundred!\n&gt; But\n&gt; &gt; that didn&#39;t mean \n&gt; &gt; swordsmanship was flourishing, it just means a lot\n&gt; &gt; of bored samurai \n&gt; &gt; are selling their skills to buy rice. They can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; offer content so \n&gt; &gt; they babble about spirit. And to keep other\n&gt; schools\n&gt; &gt; from stealing \n&gt; &gt; their students--their moneybags--they cooked up\n&gt; &gt; useless &quot;secret \n&gt; &gt; techniques&quot; just so they&#39;ed look different from\n&gt; &gt; other schools. Oh \n&gt; &gt; and god forbid those moneybags get hurt! Oh, no,\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s face-guards! \n&gt; &gt; Gloves! Body Armor! Light Bamboo Swords! So what\n&gt; do\n&gt; &gt; you wind up \n&gt; &gt; with? Peacetime warriors who have never faced a\n&gt; &gt; naked blade; felt \n&gt; &gt; the fear of death!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;       I posted this to show one reason the samurai\n&gt; &gt; became weak and \n&gt; &gt; the martial art people in the group. I&#39;d like to\n&gt; &gt; hear what you think \n&gt; &gt; about it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?

Let\nme tell you friend fighting is fighting and usually it\nends with death if no one breaks it up. And why would\nyou want to face a blade anyways. Growing up, in the\nslums of New Jersey I learned from early on to run\nrather than face anyone with a weapon, even if you are\nan experienced fighter. Save the dramatics for Steven\nSegal, he gets paid for it. You don&#39;t want to be\nstabbed, it doesn&#39;t feel nice. Believe me I have been.\nI&#39;m a former slum kid. Don&#39;t focus so much on being\nthought a tough person but rather a level headed one.\nNo offense but how old are you, man? Glory is just a\nword man and really nothing more.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
