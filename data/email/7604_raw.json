It&#39;s an interesting\nquestion.\n \nPart of what made Miyamoto Musashi a samurai was his birth, his bloodlines.\nHe was born into a samurai family, though accounts of his early life are\nvague. From what I can gather from reading these accounts, it seems likely\nto me that he was born the son of a ronin who lived in a farming village.\n \nBut also, I believe that he was born before Hideyoshi&#39;s &quot;sword hunt&quot; and\nthus the distinction between samurai and farmers wasn&#39;t as clear-cut as\nafter that time. The &quot;sword hunt&quot; did occur during Musashi&#39;s lifetime, I\nbelieve, and he came out on the &quot;samurai&quot; end of that as far as I know. He\nfought in the battle of Sekigahara on the losing side, so he definitely was\nthe 17th century equivilent of a &quot;combat-veteran.&quot;\n \nFor most of Musashi&#39;s life, he was a ronin. He spent a bit of time in\nservice to (I believe it was) one of the Hosokawa daimyos and I believe that\nhe was involved in the summer siege of Osaka Castle. As far as I know, he\nwas always friendly to the Hosokawa Clan. But he wanted to study on his own,\nnot attached to a clan. As for how he made his living, this is vague, but\nI&#39;ve read that he sometimes taught fencing in itinerent fencing schools or\nmakeshift classes that he set up while on his travels. He never made more\nthan enough for him to live on; he was one of those stereotypical rough,\nragged ronin who was quite scary to many folk. He never married but did\nadopt two sons.\n \nNear the end of his life, he entered Lord Hosokawa&#39;s service and got\ninvolved in advising him during the Shimabara battle. AFter that, he\nretreated into a cave and wrote &quot;Book of Five Rings.&quot; \n \nNina Boal\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Sensei J.
