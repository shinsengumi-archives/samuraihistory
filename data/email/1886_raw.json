Unless you are training, or will be training in a style of \nJapanese swordsmanship that performs tameshigiri(test cutting),it \nwould be a big expense for no practical reason. This should be done \nby a professional sword polisher to be done properly (to preserve the \nintegrity and value of the blade), and that is costly.    \n     If you are or will be taking up such training, your instructor \nis who you should talk to. If he is not comfortable with his \nknowledge of assessing swords they should know someone that can help. \nMany a good blade has been ruined or destroyed by the untrained or \nthe inexperienced in attempts at sharpening.  \n  Second, even if this sword is suitible for sharpening and you see a \nneed for a sharp sword, you may want to to leave it dull while you \nlearn the basics of handling it properly. People have lost fingers \njust drawing a sword out improperly.\n   On mataining the sword, if it if steel, there is a good article on \nthe JSSUS (Japanese Sword Society of the US) website--here is their \nlink: http://www.jssus.org/.\n\nGood Luck, and whatever you do, be safe!\nJeff Harris\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bud Brann&quot; &lt;cebrann@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Lat fall a Japanese friend visited the U.S. and gave me a samurai \n&gt; Sword as a gift.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the proper way to take care of the Sword? Should one oil \nthe \n&gt; blade periodically? If so, what is the best kind of oil to use? Is \n&gt; the anything else which should be done? What about  the scabbard? \n&gt; What maintence and care should be taken with it? Advise will be \n&gt; appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Incidentally, this is a modern sword and is sold in Japan \n&gt; unsharpened. Sholud I leave it that way? Is it possible to sharpen \n&gt; these swords? If so is it desirable to have it sharpened?\n&gt; \n&gt; Even though the sword is not sharpened, My friend had to get a \npolice \n&gt; permit to buy one. This took several months. On the way to the \n&gt; states, three times he was required to open the box and show it to \n&gt; inspectors at various airports.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Even though this this is not a collectors item it is very \nbeautiful \n&gt; and authentic looking and I am very proud of it. I have another \n&gt; sword, but that was is very cheap looking with lots of plastic on \nthe \n&gt; handle. (Also a gift however, so the thought was there.)\n\n\n\n"
