I&#39;ve heard of some being buried standingin full\n&gt; armour, but believe this was only for those of higher rank. All\n&gt; others were cremated. If anyone has any info on this subject i would\n&gt; greatly appreciate any help you could offer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lane\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&lt;image.tiff&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
