Consequently, they \n&gt; h=\r\nad no problems (aside from a few minor hicups early on from a few \n&gt; malcon=\r\ntents early on, when folks were still adjusting to the new order).\n&gt; \n&gt; I w=\r\nould argue that the Tokugawas&#39; longevity was due to isolation, which \n&gt; ins=\r\nulated Japan from change. The minute Commodore Perry hit land, the \n&gt; Tokug=\r\nawa were doomed (well, maybe not doomed. But they obviously\nweren&#39;t \n&gt; able=\r\n to keep up.).\n&gt; \n&gt; David Kocot\n&gt; \n\nDefinately. And &quot;adapting&quot; is something=\r\n that the Japanese government,\nshogunate, bakufu, or any other power group =\r\nof ANY era has never been\ngood at. You almost never see change, just revolu=\r\ntions and power\ngrabs. In this brave new world of swords into plowshares, i=\r\nt will be\ninteresting to see how far the Japanese economy will have to fall=\r\n\nbefore either the country falls into third world status, or for the\ngovern=\r\nment to reorganize and reform. Guns and swords wouldn&#39;t go over\nwell in thi=\r\ns &#39;modern&#39; world. But, most likely, Japan will continue to\nsimply flounder =\r\nat the status quo for the next few decades. It seems\nthat no government in =\r\nany country wants to change until it is a decade\nor two into utter crisis. =\r\nA pound of cure seems so much more\nworthwhile than that ounce of prevention=\r\n. Looking at it from the\nperspective of history, it will be interesting to =\r\nsee how post-modern\nrevolutions in first world countries are conducted. 120=\r\n years ago,\nwhen economies weren&#39;t tied together guns and steel could work,=\r\n and\ndid work, they were the agents of change. Not specificaly &#39;samurai&#39;\nre=\r\nlated, but interesting nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\n"
