In WWI, the cavalry still consisted of horses, but by WWII, the cavalry was tanks and such.. if yor in a tank w/ a biiiiiiiiig cannon on the front, whats the point of a sword?? hence why the sword became a dress item, it no longer had a functional purpose.. However I have seen many pictures in textbooks and on the history channel and such showing the Japanese at prison camps using the swords to behead POWs.. I also heard on the history channel that they did consider themselves samurai, even tho they knew they werent.. So I jsut wondered what else you had to say about the subject and where you got your info.. I am, unfortunately, notorious for not having specific referrences, sorry I cant supply any..\n\nWilson\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nGet advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...
