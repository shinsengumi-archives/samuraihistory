(Draeger&#39;s\n_Classical Bujutsu_, which I loaned out to one too many students, had some\ndetails on this that I&#39;m no longer in a position to check, unfortunately.)\nAs I recall, the greatest chances of elevation in station took place during\ntimes of war, for the same reason that knighthoods in Europe were easier to\ncome by in such times:  more of the upper echelons were getting killed off,\ncreating space for upward mobility by those who could show their courage and\nskill at appropriate moments (i.e., when your superiors are watching).\nBut given the hereditary element, to say there was an age at which one\nbecame samurai is kind of self-contradicting.  But what I suspect you mean\nis the age at which he became a warrior.  Assuming that&#39;s the case... There\nwas a coming of age ceremony (genpuku, or genbuku) held at 13 or 15, or\nshortly before the lad was expected to go into battle for the first time,\naccording to Anthony J. Bryant&#39;s Osprey book _Samurai 1550 - 1600_.  (Some\nof the colour plates in that are a little suspect, but the information in\nthe text seems to check out with other sources I&#39;ve run across - save that\nBryant stresses the inflexible power of the bushido in motivating the\nsamurai, whereas Draeger and others mention the frequency with which this\ncode was violated by every class of samurai - to paraphrase &quot;Pirates of the\nCaribbean,&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not so much rules as a set of guidelines.&quot;)  According to\nBryant, by the time of the genbuku ceremony the boy had already been in\nfairly serious training for two to three years (and in some senses, had been\ntraining all his life).  At genbuku the boy&#39;s head would first get the\nshave-and-a-topknot treatment.  Since the age at which the ceremony took\nplace varies so much, I&#39;d guess it was based on the individual&#39;s readiness,\nbut that&#39;s only a guess.  Anyone with more solid info?\nBryant also has an excellent website - sengokudaimyo.com - with a great deal\nof very good information.  Apparently he&#39;s an SCA recreationist, working on\nthe living history version of his studies, which in my view gives him a much\nbetter-rounded perspective of the daily life and details of training, etc.,\nthan most of the other academics.\n\n\t\tGereg Jones Muller, Master-at-Arms\n\tThe Silk Road School of Sword and Self-Defense\n\n      2.

To become\na Samurai you must have the right bloodline, is this correct? Also\nhow old would a boy be before he turned Samurai. And how old would he\nhave to be before his first battle or was it, when he proved himself\nready.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nMessage: 3\n   Date: Thu, 24 Jun 2004 23:26:27 EDT\n   From: Eponymous13@...\nSubject: Re: Becoming a Samurai\n\nHey\n       I don&#39;t know about the other questions, but yes, aside from the\nexceptions, someone was born into the samurai class as far as I know.  :-)\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n\n\n\n"
