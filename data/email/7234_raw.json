Bix  \nJune 14, 2005 \n \nJapanese archaeologists and =\r\nhistorians have long rejected the \ngovernment&#39;s claim that Japan has had 12=\r\n4 emperors from the mythical \nJimmu, descendant of the Sun Goddess, to the =\r\ncontroversial Showa \nEmperor Hirohito, whose pre-World War II reign brought=\r\n havoc to \nAsian and Japanese people. The scholars recognize that most site=\r\ns of \nancient imperial tombs should be treated as objects of scientific \nin=\r\nquiry rather than as religious remnants of discredited State \nShinto. But b=\r\nureaucrats of the Imperial Household Agency, claiming \nto follow the Imperi=\r\nal Household Law, interpret the rules and \ncontrol the tombs. They will nei=\r\nther allow the tombs to be treated \nas ordinary historical sites for invest=\r\nigation nor release copies of \ndocuments pertaining to them or to more rece=\r\nnt emperors. Professing \nconcern for the peace, calm, and privacy of empero=\r\nrs, but really \nfearing public scrutiny of the imperial institution and \nit=\r\ns &quot;traditions,&quot; they continue to deny permission to excavate the \ntombs. \n\n=\r\nRecently, Toike Noboru, a professor of imperial history at Den-en \nChofu Un=\r\niversity in Tokyo, invoked Japan&#39;s freedom of information \nlaw in his effor=\r\nt to make the numerous imperial tumuli that dot the \nJapanese countryside a=\r\nccessible to historical knowledge.[1] At stake \nis not only the possibility=\r\n of writing a more lucid account of the \norigins of the Japanese people but=\r\n also a less idealized history of \nthe modern imperial house. Blood myths o=\r\nf an unbroken line of \nimperial succession for ages eternal&quot; (bansei ikkei)=\r\n and Japan as \na &quot;divine land&quot; (shinkoku) could be better understood. Indee=\r\nd, the \nentire field of ancient Japanese history would benefit if the oldes=\r\nt \ntombs were excavated, and the question of the imperial family&#39;s \ndescent=\r\n from Korea could be resolved. We might also learn more about \nwhy keepers =\r\nof the imperial secrets go to such great lengths to \nconceal this strong li=\r\nkelihood. Even Emperor Akihito has said that \nthe mother of the so-called &quot;=\r\n50th emperor,&quot; Kammu, had Korean blood \nand &quot;it made him feel a certain clo=\r\nseness to Korea.&quot;[2] \n\nBut Akihito has never said anything that could offer=\r\n support to \nscholars who call for release of the historical papers of his =\r\n\ndeceased father, Hirohito. Apparently the Japanese public lacks the \nright=\r\n to learn more about the activities of its most important 20th \ncentury mon=\r\narch. For how else to explain the failure to mount a \nmovement to revise la=\r\nws and regulations of the Imperial Household \nAgency, which were enacted by=\r\n the Diet and are, presumably, laws \nlike any other.\n\nToday bold scholarly =\r\nefforts to pry open the Imperial Household&#39;s \nsanctuary -- its administrati=\r\non of graves, storehouses, archives, \nand other related properties of hundr=\r\neds of emperors, empresses, \ndowager empresses, and imperial family members=\r\n -- need to be \nsituated in a larger constitutional and historical context.=\r\n Only \nthen can we see behind them the conflict between legacies of the old=\r\n \nand the new imperial order, and ultimately between the principles of \nmon=\r\narchy and democracy. Bring the virtually autonomous &quot;symbol \nmonarchy&quot; and =\r\nits high-handed, secretive administrative practices \ninto the picture, and =\r\nthe tombs issue will also illuminate other \nproblems of historical consciou=\r\nsness that trouble Japan and disturb \nits relations with Asian neighbors. \n=\r\n\n*\n\nTomb identification, restoration, and repair marked the first stage \nin=\r\n the construction of Japan&#39;s modern monarchy. The costly work was \nbegun in=\r\n the early 1860s under Emperor Komei, father of the Meiji \nemperor who serv=\r\ned as the guiding light for Japan&#39;s modern \ntransformation. For decades the=\r\n Tokugawa feudal regime had opposed \nthe identification of such burial site=\r\ns. Only in its final crisis \nyears did it suddenly relent and cooperate in =\r\nthe project, which \ncontinued until the Meiji Restoration. The grave of 14t=\r\nh century \nEmperor Go-Daigo, one of the few monarchs who actually combined =\r\nreal \npower and authority, was the first to be identified. Essentially, \nth=\r\ne tombs and mausoleum denoted points of continuity with the \nancestors buri=\r\ned in them, purportedly stretching back in time to the \nage of the gods. In=\r\n that sense they signified exactly what Komei and \nthe &quot;scholars of Nationa=\r\nl Learning&quot; most wanted to establish: \nnamely, the permanence of the imperi=\r\nal order, its connection with \nthe gods, and thus his own divinity.[3] \n\nFo=\r\nllowing the revolutionary changes that began in 1868, the \nresurrection of =\r\nemperorship continued. More burial mounds were \nidentified, and this activi=\r\nty became part of a major oligarchic \neffort to foster belief in the myth o=\r\nf an unbroken line of imperial \nsuccession. Numerous caretakers and perform=\r\ners of funeral rites \nbecame involved in tomb maintenance, which developed =\r\ninto a major \nfunction of the Imperial Household Ministry, predecessor to t=\r\nhe \nAgency. By the time of Meiji&#39;s death in 1912, the Japanese people \nhad =\r\nbeen bound, in theory, to the emperor and his divine ancestors. \nBut Japan&#39;=\r\ns bureaucratic elites still worried about the fragility of \ntheir new monar=\r\nchy, based on hereditary male succession. Their \nworries increased during t=\r\nhe reign of Meiji&#39;s son, the chronically \nill Taisho, of whom few expected =\r\nanything. Already it had been made \na crime even to say that the emperor wa=\r\ns not a living deity. In the \n1920s lese majesty laws were tightened and te=\r\nachings on the national \npolity [kokutai], or the meaning of the throne in =\r\nJapanese life, \nfurther systematized. \n\nWhen Hirohito, the only emperor eve=\r\nr to be educated under the new \nimperial system, ascended to the throne at =\r\nthe end of 1925, the \ndefining political principles, formalized in the Cons=\r\ntitution \n(1889), the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890), and kokutai \nt=\r\nhought, began to be re-emphasized. But among ruling elites, fear \nfor the s=\r\nurvival of the monarchy persisted. \n\nMeanwhile the number of graves identif=\r\nied as &quot;imperial&quot; kept on \nincreasing. When Japanese soldiers started dying=\r\n in Manchuria during \nthe early 1930s, Yasukuni Shrine, charged with commem=\r\norating their \nspirits and mobilizing the nation for war, took on new impor=\r\ntance; \nso too did the emperor&#39;s dispatch of emissaries to the grave sites =\r\n\nof his imperial ancestors, but especially to Ise Jingu, shrine for \nthe sp=\r\nirit of the Sun Goddess, and to Yasukuni. \n\n*\n\nAfter Japan&#39;s defeat in 1945=\r\n, U.S. officials, with the active \ncooperation of Japan&#39;s old guard &quot;modera=\r\ntes,&quot; reformed and \nconstitutionally preserved the monarchy, for without co=\r\nnstitutional \nsupport it might not have lasted. Unwisely, they kept Hirohit=\r\no on \nthe throne. They did, however, transform the emperor into a vague, \ni=\r\nll-defined &quot;symbol&quot; bereft of political power, but left undecided \nthe ques=\r\ntion of whether he is the head of state. They also abolished \nState Shinto,=\r\n formally disestablished but did not abolish Yasukuni \nShrine, and wrote a =\r\nrigorous separation of politics and religion \ninto the Constitution. Becaus=\r\ne U.S. occupation officials treated \npostwar Yasukuni the same way they tre=\r\nated Hirohito -- keeping him \non the throne and indulgently shielding him f=\r\nrom the Tokyo War \nCrimes Trial -- the shrine was eventually able to restor=\r\ne its \nauthority and resume its close connection with the monarchy. \nHirohi=\r\nto paid his first post-occupation visit to Yasukuni in 1952, \nhis last in 1=\r\n975. Three years after that final visit, the name-list \nof the newly enshri=\r\nned martyrs arrived at the Imperial Household \nAgency. Hirohito learned tha=\r\nt fourteen A-Class war criminals, \nincluding former Foreign Minister Matsuo=\r\nka Yosuke, an individual who \nhad not died in the war and whom he blamed fo=\r\nr his alliance with \nNazi Germany, had been secretly enshrined. His visits =\r\nto Yasukuni \nabruptly ended, but he continued to send imperial family membe=\r\nrs to \nattend the shrine&#39;s spring and autumn rites, a practice that \ncontin=\r\nues to this day. Akihito has never visited Yasukuni.[4] \n\nFor four straight=\r\n decades, from the mid-1950s through the late \n1980s, Japan&#39;s economy had g=\r\nrown, holding in check the undemocratic \ntendencies of its polity. During t=\r\nhat time, Yasukuni, together with \nthe Central Association of Shinto Shrine=\r\ns, its main support \norganization, repeatedly attempted to regain state pro=\r\ntection and \nrevive the practice of official public visits by ministers of =\r\nstate. \nA concurrence of crises at the end of the 1980s -- the temporary \nw=\r\neakening of the LDP, Hirohito&#39;s death, and the end of the cold war -\n- soon=\r\n altered the political atmosphere in Japan.\n\nNationalism is once again on t=\r\nhe rise throughout East Asia. Japan, \nhaving sent troops to Iraq and accomm=\r\nodated to post 9/11 U.S. \nstrategic planning, has entered a stage that coul=\r\nd produce \nirrevocable alterations in its constitutional provisions and ima=\r\nge \nas a peace state. The ruling conservative politicians have turned to \nl=\r\negal compulsion to force patriotic expression, and increasingly \nseek to im=\r\npart only one subjective meaning to it, which all must \nembrace. Singing th=\r\ne national anthem (kimigayo) and raising the sun \nflag (hinomaru) during sc=\r\nhool entrance and graduation ceremonies are \ntypical examples.\n\nRecent effo=\r\nrts to revise Japan&#39;s Basic Education Law also reveal \nrestorationist impul=\r\nses that are stirring again beneath the surface \nof conservative politics. =\r\nThe present Education Law, for example, \nwas enacted in 1947, nearly two ye=\r\nars after defeat, in reaction to \nEmperor Meiji&#39;s Education Rescript, which=\r\n had disavowed universal \nideals and promoted militarism, loyalty, and fili=\r\nal piety. In the \ncurrent post-9/11 situation the two leading business fede=\r\nrations \n(Keidanren and Doyukai) and the leading political parties blame th=\r\ne \nEducation Law for the ills of society and seek to rewrite it along \nwith=\r\n the Constitution. Rather than address real economic problems \nand the diss=\r\nolution of middle class social norms that lie behind the \npresent tribulati=\r\nons of Japan&#39;s school system, conservative \npoliticians pose as guardians o=\r\nf morality and rush ahead with \nrevision schemes.[5] \n\nThe same restoration=\r\nist inclination can be seen in the way some of \nJapan&#39;s elites cling to the=\r\nir old perceptions of the Japan-China War \nand Pacific War, ignoring differ=\r\nences with China and Korea. The \nbehavior of Prime Minister Koizumi well il=\r\nlustrates the problem. \nKoizumi follows in the footsteps of former prime mi=\r\nnister Nakasone, \nbut unlike Nakasone he persists in visiting Yasukuni desp=\r\nite \ndiplomatic protests and demonstrations in China and Korea. The \npostwa=\r\nr Yasukuni re-presents the prewar view of Japan&#39;s modern wars \nand actively=\r\n combats the results of the Tokyo Trials. Thus Koizumi&#39;s \nvisits highlight =\r\nthe gap in historical consciousness between Japan \nand the Asian neighbors =\r\nit attacked and occupied during the first \nhalf of the twentieth century. H=\r\nis actions carry the danger of \njeopardizing critically important economic =\r\nties. Were it not for the \nwillingness of all sides to keep politics and ec=\r\nonomics separate, \ntheir respective nationalisms could narrow and spiral ou=\r\nt of \ncontrol. For Korea and China also remain locked into pre-World War \nI=\r\nI images of Japan.\n\nIn Japan neo-nationalist views of the lost war have mov=\r\ned into the \nmainstream, but public opinion remains divided over Koizumi&#39;s =\r\nstand \non official visits to Yasukuni, with more than half opposing them. \n=\r\nAt the same time, the public also strongly supports revision of the \nImperi=\r\nal Household Law to accommodate a future female successor to \nthe throne. U=\r\nnfortunately, there has been no public debate, as yet, \nover far more funda=\r\nmental questions: What is the relationship \nbetween the symbol monarchy and=\r\n Japanese democracy in a time of \nrising nationalism? Should the monarchy, =\r\npredicated on gender \ndiscrimination and inseparably connected with Yasukun=\r\ni Shrine, be \nremoved from the Constitution? Should it even continue to exi=\r\nst in \nthe Twenty-First Century? If it should, then on what grounds, and at=\r\n \nwhat cost to the constitutional rights and freedoms of imperial \nfamily m=\r\nembers?[6] \n\nFinally, if Japan is to protect its democratic institutions an=\r\nd \nrebuild political relations with China and Korea, then public debate \nov=\r\ner the Security Treaty with the United States must also be \nreopened, and t=\r\nhe historical legacy of that military alliance \nreassessed to prevent Japan=\r\n&#39;s Pentagon ties from undermining its \ndemocratic processes. Mass movements=\r\n demanding the ouster of all \nU.S. bases on Japanese soil could stiffen the=\r\n will of Japanese \npoliticians and force them to place relations with Washi=\r\nngton on a \nnew foundation. For U.S. political elites seek to perpetuate Ja=\r\npan&#39;s \nenergy dependency, limit its diplomatic options, and check its \ntend=\r\nency to draw closer to its neighbors in an economic community \nthat could b=\r\ne of benefit to all peoples of the East Asian region. \n\n\nNotes\n\n\n1.
