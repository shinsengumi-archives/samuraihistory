They could be anyone from a lowly \nkitchen worker, \n&gt; to a fully ranked and privleged Samurai.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a historical example of how ninja and samurai worked, read the \nbook &quot;Taiko&quot; \n&gt; it contains fairly accurate accounts of how ninja and samurai \nworked together.\n&gt; \n&gt; FYI: Ninja rarely if ever wore outfits like the movies show them \nwearing. They \n&gt; simply dressed like everyone else did.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Thom\n&gt; &gt; I am also sure ninjas casted samurai in a negative light as \nwell. \n&gt; &gt; Generally ninjas were not of samurai class, (anyone know any \n&gt; &gt; exceptions?) they were made up of the other classes, since they \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t become samurai, they trained and became ninjas instead, \nand \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure being oppressed by the samurai class led to animosity \n&gt; &gt; towards them, therefore once again, &quot;bitter enemies.&quot;\n\n\n"
