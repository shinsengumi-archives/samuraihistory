The other was headed by Honda Masanobu, \nwho wasn&#39;t known as a great warrior (due to an illness he suffered \nduring his youth, I vaguely recall reading that this might have been \npolio, but I might be confusing that with Date Masamune), but \nMasanobu acted in a diplomatic and administrative role for the \nTokugawa. He was also known as a political schemer, but was very \nclose to Ieyasu, and later Hidetada. Another fairly vague \nrecollection I have is that the founder of Honda Motor Corp. was \ndescended from this branch of the family.\n\n\n"
