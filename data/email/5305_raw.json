Nate is correct, I was pretty darn\nsurprised! In fact I (and probably quite a few others) thought you were\njoking!\n\nActually you and I are not so different. I started studying Chinese and\nJapanese Porcelain at age 12, and I was working (part time, since I was\nstill at school) in the Asian Arts dept of a well known Auctioneer by age\n16. That said you are the only kid I ever encountered who started studying\nsomething like this seriously like I did at your age.\n\nPerhaps you should also have a look at Antique Japanese Swords, but be\ncareful you don&#39;t get hooked :-)\n\nIf you are interested have a look here:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\nFor some great pix check out http://www.nihonto.ca\n\nThere are some good discussion groups on the subject as well. If you like I\nwill post them.\n\nGanbatte!\n\nMatt\n\n\n    Z Recruiting Services\n    &quot;Zurich Toren&quot; Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haag\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E: info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl en\n    nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n    Z Recruiting Services is een handelsnaam van Zï¿½ta Partners B.V.\n    Onze Algemene Voorwaarden zijn gedeponeerd bij KvK Haaglanden.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;edyhiphop@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 18, 2004 11:08 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Last straw of the Ninja\n\n\n&gt; Nate,\n&gt;\n&gt; In Romania it&#39;s damn very hard to learn Japanese.I learnt with a teacher\nhiragana(and a bit of Katakana) so far.I&#39;m gonna start again in October or\nNovember so i&#39;ll continue my studies.The Japanese language is very hard but\nit&#39;s fun(especially talking to my friends at school and they don&#39;t\nunderstand a bit!!!!) and I like it.I tried learning on my own but I found\nout that it&#39;s almost impossible to learn.About the Sengoku period,I have in\nmy room a complete bookshelf reserved for all the stuff with\nJapan(books,pages on which I printed much Sengoku stuff from Samurai\nArchives,floppy disks on which I have information about Japanese\ncastles.....)Plus,it&#39;s been great here and it&#39;s been very fun here on this\nforum and I&#39;m hoping we&#39;ll discuss other great and interesting subjects\nabout the immense history of Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Edy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Edward Alexander &lt;edyhiphop@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s the problem????Next year I&#39;m 14.I joined this\n&gt; &gt; group cuz I&#39;m fascinated by Japanese\n&gt; &gt; history(especially Samurai) and I even learn the\n&gt; &gt; Japanese language(learned so far hiragana).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Edy\n&gt;\n&gt; Edy--\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think there is a problem--I think he was\n&gt; probably surprised, because for a 13 year old you ask\n&gt; some darn good questions, and have good input. Most of\n&gt; us long timers here started out the same way--for\n&gt; whatever reason, whether it be having watched a\n&gt; samurai movie at age 4 or whatever, we got hooked by\n&gt; your age and just kept reading. Keep it up. I know you\n&gt; said you are in Romania--any Japanese language classes\n&gt; there, or are you learning on your own? I tried to\n&gt; teach myself before I took courses in college--I ended\n&gt; up having to unlearn a lot, so I recommend at least\n&gt; trying to find some tapes to get the right sound.\n&gt;\n&gt; Trust me, we&#39;d give you hell about being 13 if we felt\n&gt; you deserved it--and you may get some jokes now and\n&gt; then, but it&#39;s only because we like you.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
