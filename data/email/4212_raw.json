Many of the Japanese left stirring accounts of their \nexperiences there. They also just happened to confront the Taiping \nRebellion, probably the largest peasant rebellion in history till \nthen, when Taiping forces attacked the Chinese city while the \nJapanese were there.\n\nEighty-two years later, in 1944, the Japanese made a movie on \nlocation in occupied Shanghai about that voyage of 1862. The film \nwas lost at war&#39;s end and only rediscovered in late 2001.\n\nMy presentation will look first at the initial voyage, then at the \nmovie and the message it sought to convey, and finally at why sixty \nyears since it was shot and 140 years since the mission took place, \nthe story retains such extraordinary poignancy today.&quot;\n\n\n\n"
