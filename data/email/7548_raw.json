Seriously, though--we&#39;re all trying to improve,\nand as long as we realize what we don&#39;t know, it&#39;s\neasier to find out more stuff. \n\n&gt; and I am often facing the fact that many authors are\n&gt; saying totally \n&gt; opposite from one to another. So, as you spoke about\n&gt; Turnbull and Samson \n&gt; (I don&#39;t have any of these books), and are\n&gt; explaining why their books \n&gt; might include mistakes, \n\nTurnbull is a touchy subject around some people, as\nsome people love him, others hate him. In his favor,\nhe&#39;s probably the most prolific author in English on\nthe subject, some of his books are excellently\ndetailed (the Samurai Sourcebook being a great book),\nand he generally doesn&#39;t put out too much\nmisinformation on purpose. \n\nOn the bad side, his early works were accused of\nplagiarism, many of his later books are simply\nrewrites/reshuffles of earlier books with the same\ninfo/anecdotes under different titles, and in many of\nhis Osprey works he&#39;s not very careful to check his\nfacts/spelling/editing/etc. Samurai Warfare, 1465-1600\nis the biggest waste of money I&#39;ve ever had the\nmispleasure of buying. Some of his works are obvious\nattempts at repackaging previous info, or writing\nstuff off the top of his head to simply sell another\nbook. So, while some of his stuff is great, be careful\nwith it. Read it, then verify it with other sources.\nTurnbull books I recommend: Nagashino 1575, The\nSamurai Sourcebook, any of the Samurai\nWarriors/Samurai Warlords/Lone Samurai and the Martial\nArts/etc. I&#39;d be dubious of much of his Osprey work\nunless you can verify it with something else--it just\nsmacks of mass production. \n\nGeorge B. Sansom compiled a fabulous History of Japan\nin 3 volumes. It&#39;s epic--and a must-read. However, he\nmakes several notable mistakes, makes statements that\nhave since been shown to be false, etc. It&#39;s\ngood--don&#39;t get me wrong. But particularly his Sengoku\nperiod (1333-1615) information gets a little too\nshallow. A must as a background read, but for\nspecifics, delve deeper. \n\n&gt; I am more interested right now about Momoyama period\n&gt; and the whole \n&gt; &quot;reign&quot; of Hideyoshi, but, unfortunately I can only\n&gt; read in French or \n&gt; English.\n\nMary Berry&#39;s &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; is an excellent read.\n&quot;Japonius Tyrannus&quot; is about Nobunaga, but provides\nlots of good scholarly info. Sansom would help provide\ngood background, of course. \n\nOne book I&#39;d recommend, even though it&#39;s fiction, is\nYoshikawa Eiji&#39;s &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;, available in\nEnglish--not sure about French. Even though it&#39;s\nfictitious, and horribly didactic, it does lay out the\ncommonly believed episodes from Hideyoshi&#39;s early\nlife, and matches most other sources that I&#39;ve seen,\nat least in the events. The only bad part of the book\nis that it drips with hero-worship; there are only so\nmany times I can read about how brilliant Hideyoshi\nwas without gagging.\n\n&gt; The books I got right now (please let me know if\n&gt; they include bad \n&gt; information):\n&gt; - Samurai: An Illustrated History by Mitsuo Kure;\n&gt; - 図録日本の甲冑武具事典 (I hope i am\n&gt; pasting the right letters);\n&gt; - Samurai Invasion by Turnbull\n&gt; - Samurai Sourcebook by Turnbull\n&gt; - The Cambridge history of Japan : vol 4 : early\n&gt; modern history.\n&gt; - Another book in Japanese about Oda nobunaga&#39;s\n&gt; followers (i was \n&gt; actually looking for the sengoku jinmei jiten but I\n&gt; went through this one).\n\nAll of these, especially Cambridge, are pretty good.\nSourcebook and Samurai Invasion are two of Turnbull&#39;s\nbetter works. \n\n&gt; I know there is a &quot;recommended readings&quot; section on \n&gt; www.samurai-archives.com , but without comments it\n&gt; is pretty hard for me \n&gt; to appraise books (and authors) quality. \n\nIt&#39;s hard until you start reading through things. Most\nof those books are excellent, but every author, no\nmatter how good, has his/her own tendencies, biases,\netc. Knowledge comes not from reading one or two\nbooks, but from reading and comparing many sources and\ntrying to find the common picture. This is why I say\nmovies and anime, etc., are not good sources and\nshould not be treated as such. If it&#39;s hard to find\nagreement in scholarly historical books, then how much\nharder is it to figure out fact from fiction in a work\nof fiction?\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n"
