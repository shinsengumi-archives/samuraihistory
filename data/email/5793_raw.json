It&#39;s the sort of thing I&#39;m interested in so I \nchecked the library catalogue and found a copy of it. Imagine my \ndelight when I discover a 1888 4th edition sitting here in pretty \ngood condition. Mayhaps the library will be one less book soon ;)\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Craig Harris \n&lt;bridgeofdreams@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There are a lot of books that deal with this, but one of the \n&gt; earliest, &quot;Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings,&quot; by Edward S. \n&gt; Morse, originally published in 1895, is still one of the best. \n&gt; Profusely illustrated by his own drawings, plenty of details of \n&gt; many types of traditional Japanese dwellings in great detail. Morse \n&gt; was an incredible observer and very competent draftsman with a \n&gt; wonderful eye for detail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately this book is available in a fairly inexpensive Dover\n&gt; reprint edition that should do well for your son&#39;s purposes.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n"
