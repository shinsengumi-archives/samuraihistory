In WWI, the cavalry still \n&gt; consisted of horses, but by WWII, the cavalry was tanks and such.. if \n&gt; yor in a tank w/ a biiiiiiiiig cannon on the front, whats the point of \n&gt; a sword?? hence why the sword became a dress item, it no longer had a \n&gt; functional purpose.. However I have seen many pictures in textbooks \n&gt; and on the history channel and such showing the Japanese at prison \n&gt; camps using the swords to behead POWs.. I also heard on the history \n&gt; channel that they did consider themselves samurai, even tho they knew \n&gt; they werent.. So I jsut wondered what else you had to say about the \n&gt; subject and where you got your info.. I am, unfortunately, notorious \n&gt; for not having specific referrences, sorry I cant supply any..\n&gt;\n&gt; Wilson\n\nI am taking a graduate seminar on Modern Japanese history, and I am \nsure the above will be a big issue for discussion.
