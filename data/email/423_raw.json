I can tell by reading your emails that you all know what u are\n&gt; talking about and I would be very grateful if u could suggest some\n&gt; websites books and anything relating to samurai history. I have already\n&gt; got my hands on some books (by Stephen Turnbull who I am told is\n&gt; somewhat of an expert in this field) but I am looking for books that\n&gt; focus more on the armor and the mons of the samurai. Any information\n&gt; will be greatly appreciated\n&gt;\n\nTurnbull is a good place to start. You could also look at my books, or my\nwebsite -- especially if you&#39;re interested in armour.\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/sengokudaimyo\n\n\nTony\n\n\n"
