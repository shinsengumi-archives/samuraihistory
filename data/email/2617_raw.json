One person would hoist the banner up to the top of the building to show that his brigade was fighting the flames, until either the fire was put out, or the fire consumed him...  Or at least, this is what I was taught in Japanese culture class..\n\nWilson\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Sat, 29 Nov 2003 16:56:41\nFrom: Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nI was wondering about the origins of the yakuza, I have herd that they originated from porters, (a group\nthat were easily recognized by their extensive body art). Or were they simply a mixed group of rufians\nand wayward ronin? All this is assumeing that they originated in the 18th or 19th centurys, or are they\na much more recent development?\n\nDave Jackson\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
