I have read &quot;Gates of power&quot; and might read the book on Yoritomo. I\nsaw it in the bookstore and the apprehension I have is that it&#39;s not really\na flesh and blood biography of him. I would much rather prefer to read a\nbook on him written say in the style Amy Kelly wrote on Eleonor of Aquitane.\nIf she could write that kind of book on a famous person in the 12th century\nsomebody could write one on Yoritomo. The other apprehension is that\nYoritomo book is 8000 yen. For me a least its not a question of not wanting\nto delve deeper into more serious works. Its that the feild of Japanese\nhistorigraphy is lacking in truly talented writers that can be found in\nother fields eg Robert Massie, Simon Schama, Stephan Ambrose. That is\nsomething that disappoints me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
