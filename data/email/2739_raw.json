The pictures of tachi that I&#39;ve seen have a cord or string that makes the sword dangle from the waist. That makes it lower and more natural to draw with edge down. The katana is usually worn stuck into a sash with the handle pointing up at a slight angle. This would make it easier to be drawn with the edge up. All the samurai movies as well as the old engravings and artwork I&#39;ve seen have the edge up on katanas, edge down with tachis.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: samurai-listowner@... \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, December 08, 2003 11:44 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: TACHI\n\n\n  I&#39;ve drawn a katana less than 100 times in my life and that was years ago, so I&#39;m \n  lost on the &#39;blade up / blade down&#39; conversation -- I am picturing a katana or \n  whichever type of sword you choose on your left side, basically parallel to the \n  ground, with the handle protruding out in front of you (the way I was taught to \n  wear it).  I take &#39;blade down&#39; to mean that the cutting edge is facing the ground, \n  and is basically parallel to the ground.  if you draw with your right hand, it \n  results in a fairly natural grip. If on the other hand, the sword is &#39;blade up&#39;, \n  that would mean to me that the cutting edge is &#39;up&#39; and therefore facing the sky.  \n  if that was the case, drawing with your right hand would force you to turn your \n  wrist up so that your fist is perpendicular to the ground, and your knuckles \n  are &#39;up&#39; facing the sky.  I think that would be very hard to draw that way, and to \n  do a cut off the draw like that would mean that you are slashing out in a circular \n  motion up-out-down, which would seem to me difficult to control due to the \n  position your wrist is in and the fact that the sword would be almost slingshotted \n  out of the sheath, whereas drawing the sword blade down (as I&#39;ve described an \n  pictured it) results is an easily controlled and aimable strike.  Would someone \n  like to describe the mechanics of katana-drawing for me?  The way I was taught was \n  purely blade down.\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Anthony J.
