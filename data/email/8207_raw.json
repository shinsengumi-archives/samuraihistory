That is all I know of their style choice it was \n&gt; more practical than aesthetic.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;MNcoffey@...&quot; &lt;MNCoffey@...&gt; wrote:  I wish \n&gt; to apologize to the management since my last e-mail did not have\n&gt; anything to do with history. Now my question, I was hoping that\n&gt; somebody might know the history of the Hakama, like who started it,\n&gt; what year and most importantly why that I mean why did the samurai\n&gt; choose the hakama. I hope this question is not ment to be sent to a\n&gt; kendo forum. Also I can&#39;t find anything on the history of sojutsu. so\n&gt; any help on those two questions would be nice.thanks.-Martin Jr.\n&gt;\n\n\nThanks Rod. I had a frienf ask me what the hakama was used for and I \ndid&#39;nt know so thank you.\n\n\n"
