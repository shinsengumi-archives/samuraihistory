Then IIga Clan Master inserted his sword on the\nsoil and take the\noath that IIga would no longer continue teaching the\nart of Ninpo and thus,\nin this way both IIGA and Koga ended their existences,\nat least as Ninpo\nClans.\n\nIt is difficult to find online reference or books with\nsuch aspects of\njapanese history. Ya knows... Ninpo issue tend to be\nvery secretive... &lt;=o(\n\nOctavio Augusto\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
