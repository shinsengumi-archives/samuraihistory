He had formed a private &quot;army&quot; (I forget the \nsize, but it was small and not officially part of the Civil Defense Forces) \ncalled the Tate no kai or &quot;Shield Society.&quot;  It is hard to call what he did \non that day in 1970 a true uprising becuase he had, like, only 10 guys \n(from his Shield Society) and it can be argued that he took a hostage \nmerely to be allowed to speak.  Mishima could be described as a bit of a \nhedonist and loved to be the center of attention from all accounts.  \nIncidentally, his seppuku, which was botched all to hell and a second \nkaishaku had to finish the job of taking his head, seems to have been the \nplan all along.  He made sure that morning that his affairs were in order \nand sent off to the the publisher the last manuscript of his Tetralogy.\n\nIn any event, I don&#39;t think that this can be considered a true military \nuprising since he was not part of the military, had no weapons of note and \nclearly did not expect to take the day as he had prepared for his death.  \nAlso, if you read his short book _Sun and Steel_ he outlines in it his \nbeliefs about unifying life and art and about the merits of dying while \nstill young and beautiful.\n\nFor what it&#39;s worth.\n\n-Shannon\n\n\nFrom: Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\n  Now on the darker side:\nThere was a military uprising in the 1970&#39;s by a general who wanted to go \nback to the days of Imperial japan and reinstate the class of samurai by \nforce. But only a handful of soldiers joined him. Everyone else shouted him \ndown as a crazy man. He committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\nwrote:\n &gt; Okay, but why a Katana instead of a Calvary sword\n &gt; like other (US) militaries. Even pilots carried\n &gt; Katanas.\n &gt;\n\nTurn the question around: Why do we in the US military\ncarry cavalry sabers as our ceremonial weapons (and\nwhy did they carry them back in the day when they\nactually used them?) Because that&#39;s what we\nused--that&#39;s what fit with our Army. Why should the\nJapanese Army change what had worked for their culture\nfor 1000 years?\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
