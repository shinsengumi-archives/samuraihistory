The word comes from =\r\nthe kanji meaning literally &#39;to serve&#39;, whether it was the Emperor, a daimy=\r\no, or even one of the equally mighty temples. \nHowever, upon this point of =\r\n&#39;to serve&#39;, would you classify the likes of the Miyamoto Musashi as a &#39;samu=\r\nrai&#39; since his carrer with the sword was one essentially without a master??=\r\n \nM.Lorimer\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Mark Arsenaul=\r\nt &lt;taisho@...&gt; wrote:\nSpecifically, the term &quot;samurai&quot; is\n&gt; not syn=\r\nonymous with \n&gt; &quot;swordsman&quot; or &quot;one who tries to adhere to Bushido&quot;\n&gt; or an=\r\nything similar. \n&gt; Samurai were a caste, and one that no longer exists.\n&gt; S=\r\no in the strict \n&gt; definition of the term, one cannot &quot;become&quot; a\n&gt; samurai =\r\nany more.\n\nPoint of fact, if you told you&#39;re average Japanese\nperson you we=\r\nre a &quot;samurai&quot;, you&#39;d have them laughing\nuntil next week.
