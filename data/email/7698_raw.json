His discoveries find that a chinese triad,\na Japanese yakuza, and a burmese rebelist group\nhave joined together to take over Japan. So as usual\ntravis goes and stops tham one by one. He loses his\nfiance and partner to the yakuza and the triad and\nalmost lost his new friend whose family was killed by\nthe same yakuza. But the movies real light comes when\nTravis unsheaths his shinken and does brutal damage.\nInto the Sun is a must see movie. I has Chinese kung\nfu, a begining gun battle, and the best part, Samurai\nswordsmanship at its best. I would highly recomend\nthis movie to any samurai lover.   \n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
