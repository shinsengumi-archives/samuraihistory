I had believed that bronze - a mixture=\r\n of 90% copper and 10% tin - was the preferred metal used for the casting o=\r\nf cannon. Although cast-iron cannon became available ca 1550, these were mu=\r\nch more difficult to cast, and bronze remained the metal of choice until th=\r\ne mid to late C17. Since the &#39;De Liefde&#39; arrived in Kyushu in 1600, is it n=\r\not highly likely that its cannon were of bronze rather than of iron? Is the=\r\nre an expert on cannon out there somewhere who can clarify this point for m=\r\ne? Regards, John L.&quot;\n \nThe cannon on the &#39;De Liefde&#39; were indeed made out o=\r\nf bronze. This was verfied by a cargo manifest prepared by a Jesuit that wa=\r\ns sent on board to inspect the ship.\n\n\n"
