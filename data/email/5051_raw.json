It helped me\n&gt; out a lot. I appreciated it greatly. I just have\n&gt; some problems with lasing the lames together. You\n&gt; said that this guy is on this list. Do you know what\n&gt; screen name he goes by? While I was on the site I\n&gt; e-mailed him and he still hasn&#39;t replied. Maybe you\n&gt; could help me with a easier way to learn how to lase\n&gt; the lames together. If you have any more info. it\n&gt; would greatly be appreciated. \n&gt;                                                     \n&gt;               Thank you again,\n&gt;                                                     \n&gt;                    Mark\n\nWell, I wasn&#39;t going to give his name, since he hasn&#39;t\npaid me my agent fee in a few weeks. He&#39;s normally\npretty good about answering the mail, though, so give\nhim a little time. You&#39;ll see him on the board or the\nlist as Tony, or Anthony J. Bryant. (Tony, that check\nbetter be in the mail...)\n\nAs for helping with how to lace the lames, I&#39;m\nclueless. I&#39;ve not attempted this at all, so I\ncouldn&#39;t help. But you can try the links he&#39;s got on\nhis site, since i think he links to a couple of armor\nmaking sites that might help you. Also, if you go to\nwww.samurai-archives.com and go to the messageboard\nthere (it&#39;s a delphi forum), I know there are several\npeople on the board who have used Tony&#39;s site as a\nbasis for their armor making, and they could probably\nhelp you. \n\nCheers!\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
