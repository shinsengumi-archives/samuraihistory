Thank you for\nmaking it clear=\r\ner.  \n\nOne thing I left out, and shouldn&#39;t have done, is that I was referri=\r\nng\nto those of us on this particular forum would know the difference, not\ne=\r\nvery &quot;stray cat&quot; who wandered in having seen some anime.  \nThe main point t=\r\nhat seems to have been lost in the flurry:  if a film,\nhowever inaccurate, =\r\nsilly or simple it is, inspires someone to read up\non the subject and actua=\r\nlly learn about it, then surely that is a good\nthing?  It&#39;s what got me sta=\r\nrted 35 years ago and I&#39;ve never stopped\nreading and learning since.  I don=\r\n&#39;t understand the references to\nHollywood blockbuster type films though - e=\r\nven I, in my condescending\nand snotty manner, would never deign to imply th=\r\nat they were worthy of\ninclusion in this discussion......I&#39;m sorry if anyon=\r\ne finds me\ncondescending, and a little surprised, because to be honest, I&#39;v=\r\ne been\nembarrassed at the bad tempered way some posters have been treated\nw=\r\nhen they ask a simple (and simplistic) question, or merely try to\ndrum up a=\r\n bit of controversy just to get a discussion going.  To those\npeople I woul=\r\nd show infinite patience, because I really, really want\nmore people to get =\r\ninto the subject that I&#39;ve loved almost all of my\nlife.  It won&#39;t help them=\r\n to continue learning about the subject if\ntheir every mistake is howled at=\r\n, and it certainly doesn&#39;t encourage\nme to keep posting if, by not agreeing=\r\n, I&#39;m seen to be condescending.\n I think &quot;cut out quotes&quot; as favoured here =\r\nare part of the problem,\nthey ignore a long and reasoned argument and make =\r\nthe one snippet\nquoted sound like an unreasonable shriek.  Speaking of shri=\r\neking, I&#39;ve\nread several people on different forums howling with rage becau=\r\nse\ntheir preferred historical source was not the same as someone else&#39;s.\n H=\r\now can they know which is right, and ultimately, does it matter?  In\nmy clu=\r\nmsy way, that was what I was trying to get at, being dogmatic\nover a partic=\r\nular version of history to the extent of insulting others\nwho don&#39;t agree, =\r\nor prefer an alternative source.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@s...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ned,\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that the main =\r\npoint of contention that I would have is that\nhistory\n&gt; books all have the =\r\nintended purpose of being correct whereas fiction&#39;s\n&gt; purpose isn&#39;t to be c=\r\norrect, it is to entertain.  You are drawing a\nsharp\n&gt; line here where a le=\r\nss sharp, more blurry line (so to speak) is\nneeded. Or\n&gt; perhaps I should s=\r\nay that in making this sharp distinction, you are\nusing a\n&gt; katana where a =\r\nsurgeon&#39;s scalpal would be more useful. \n&gt; \n&gt; Many history books are intend=\r\ned to push a particular agenda. I\nsuppose that\n&gt; one can say that the write=\r\nr of a book that is labeled &quot;history&quot; usually\n&gt; believes that their main po=\r\nint and their main agenda are both correct. \n&gt; \n&gt; How many times have you r=\r\nead history books that, for instance, state\nthat\n&gt; &quot;the following IS the st=\r\nory of the 47 Ako ronin&#39;s revenge&quot; and then\nread a\n&gt; description that is fu=\r\nll of suppositions, assumptions, unfounded facts.\n&gt; Mainly because all of t=\r\nhe details simply are not available. I don&#39;t\nknow how\n&gt; many contrasting an=\r\nd conflicting &quot;historical&quot; accounts of the\nrevenge of the\n&gt; 47 ronin that I=\r\n&#39;ve read in who knows how many history books. Like\nfiction\n&gt; writers, histo=\r\nrical writers will &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; with\nsuppositions when\n&gt; the actual e=\r\nmpirical evidence doesn&#39;t exist. So to say outright that\neach\n&gt; and every h=\r\nistory book is &quot;to try and be correct&quot; misses the point\nbecause\n&gt; that is n=\r\not the case with all of them. \n&gt; \n&gt; There really isn&#39;t any problem with his=\r\ntorical writers doing some\n&quot;filling\n&gt; in&quot; with suppositions and assumptions=\r\n when actual sources aren&#39;t\navailable.\n&gt; If a writer is actually trying to =\r\nwrite a correct account, then\nhe/she will\n&gt; tell us that the account that h=\r\nas been written is speculative. What is\n&gt; probably the best way to tell us =\r\nabout a certain event is to present\nseveral\n&gt; versions that could be deduct=\r\ned from what empirical facts are\navailable and\n&gt; then discuss which version=\r\n makes the most sense to the writer. \n&gt; \n&gt; But in my experience, most histo=\r\nry writers don&#39;t do this. Instead, they\n&gt; present a single version of an ev=\r\nent as THE FACTS. And thus there\nare about\n&gt; 50 or so &quot;factual&quot; versions (a=\r\nt least) in several &quot;history&quot; books of\nhow the\n&gt; dispute between Lord Asano=\r\n and Lord Kira took place, what caused\nLord Asano\n&gt; to draw his sword, what=\r\n happened afterward, how the 47 Ako retainers who\n&gt; planned an attack on Ki=\r\nra actually accomplished this, what happened\nafter\n&gt; the attack, etc.   \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; One of the other posters mentioned &quot;peer review&quot; as if somehow that\nmake=\r\ns\n&gt; the historical work certified in some way as &quot;accurate&quot; and\ntherefore n=\r\not to\n&gt; be questioned. Peers can be just as human, have just as many agenda=\r\ns of\n&gt; their own to push as the author does. Even those peers with tons of\n=\r\nletters\n&gt; and degrees behind their name can have agendas. \n&gt; \n&gt; I hate to s=\r\nay it, but history isn&#39;t like computer programming or\nmathematics\n&gt; (my fie=\r\nlds of expertise) with clear-cut divisions between &quot;true&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;false.&quot; So=\r\n we&#39;re going to have several different versions of &quot;the\nfacts&quot;\n&gt; and we&#39;re =\r\ngoing to have to learn to use our own heads to read several\n&gt; sources and d=\r\necide for ourselves. We will each come up with different\n&gt; conclusions and =\r\ntherefore, we can have lists like this one to exchange\n&gt; ideas. \n&gt; \n&gt; So we=\r\n get to film and other works clearly labeled as &quot;fiction&quot; and\n&quot;novels.&quot;\n&gt; T=\r\no say that the purpose of ALL fiction writers is only to\n&quot;entertain&quot;, that\n=\r\n&gt; also misses the point. \n&gt; \n&gt; Some films, mainly most anime or ZATOICHI or=\r\n similar films were made\nmainly\n&gt; to entertain. If I were to watch a Zatoic=\r\nhi film and then decide on\nthe spot\n&gt; that there truly existed a blind mass=\r\neur named Zatoichi who became a\nmaster\n&gt; swordsman, then I would truly be j=\r\numping the gun in this conclusion.\n&gt; Unfortunately, too many people do this=\r\n, watch a film, or read a book and\n&gt; unquestioningly decide that it contain=\r\ns &quot;the truth.&quot; So we occasionally\n&gt; encounter someone on this list (or else=\r\nwhere) who want to know the\n&quot;true&quot;\n&gt; history of Zatoichi. And we have to ge=\r\nntly advise them on looking at\nother\n&gt; sources that explain that Zatoichi w=\r\nas purely a fictional character. \n&gt; \n&gt; But some historical fiction, includi=\r\nng some historical films, do\nattempt to\n&gt; discuss history and cast a light =\r\non it. A lot of it is written purely to\n&gt; entertain. But not always. Back t=\r\no a film like SEPPUKU, I doubt that\nanyone\n&gt; who has seen this film would s=\r\nay that they were &quot;entertained&quot; by it;\nbeing\n&gt; entertained was not my own r=\r\neaction. This film wasn&#39;t designed to\nentertain,\n&gt; it was designed to prese=\r\nnt ideas, reflecting upon speculative\nhistory and\n&gt; then attempting to appl=\r\ny it to contemporary times. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now to say after watching SEPPUKU that th=\r\nere definitively existed a\nsamurai\n&gt; named Tsugumo Hanshiro and that he ave=\r\nnged the death of his son-in-law\n&gt; against the Ii clan -- that would be jum=\r\nping the gun. But to use the\nevents\n&gt; presented in a film like this and que=\r\nstion as to whether or not similar\n&gt; events may or may not have happened. A=\r\nnd then look for historical\nsources in\n&gt; this questioning and draw conclusi=\r\nons. That isn&#39;t jumping the gun,\nthat is\n&gt; using a film as a jumping-off po=\r\nint to explore history.      \n&gt; \n&gt; Now to get on a level of my own experien=\r\nce. When I decided to write\n&quot;Stray\n&gt; Dogs,&quot; a fictional account of the life=\r\n of one of the 47 Ako ronin, Fuwa\n&gt; Kazuemon (anyone can read the story on =\r\nthe Samurai Archives web site), I\n&gt; didn&#39;t write the story to &quot;entertain.&quot; =\r\nI also did NOT write the story to\n&gt; state that this is THE FACTS about his =\r\nlife. I couldn&#39;t do that and\nI don&#39;t\n&gt; know any historian, even those with =\r\nmultiple degrees in history who\ncould.\n&gt; Simply because so many gaps exist =\r\nin his life. I wrote the story\nbecause I\n&gt; am interested in this man&#39;s life=\r\n and thus wanted to delve into it a bit\n&gt; more. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been a bit long-=\r\nwinded here and I apologize if I bored anyone.\nBut it&#39;s\n&gt; difficult to do t=\r\nhat &quot;surgeon&#39;s scalpal&quot; thing and I don&#39;t always\naccomplish\n&gt; it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Che=\r\ners, Nina\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com\n[mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter=\r\n\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 19, 2005 7:34 PM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?
