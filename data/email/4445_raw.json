The reason why I say the true dynasty is because the \nTokugawa cl=\r\nan was the first to unite the whole of Japan. Before this \nthere was may wa=\r\nrlords ruling different provinces. Another thing to \nbear in mind is that w=\r\nhen the Tokugawa shogun united Japan a new era \nin Japan began (edo period)=\r\n. Below is a list of the different periods \nin Japanese history:\n\nJOMON (10=\r\n,000 - 300 B.C.) Prehistoric period of tribal/clan \norganization.\n\nYAYOI (3=\r\n00 B.C. - A.D. 300) Rice cultivation, metalworking, and the \npotter&#39;s wheel=\r\n are introduced from China and Korea. Era named &quot;Yayoi&quot; \nafter the place in=\r\n Tokyo where wheel-turned pottery was found.\n\nKOFUN (YAMATO) (300 - 645) Un=\r\nified state begins with emergence of \npowerful clan rulers; Japan establish=\r\nes close contacts with mainland \nAsia.\n\nASUKA (645 -710) A great wave of re=\r\nforms called the Taika no Kaishin \n(Taika Reforms) aims to strengthen the e=\r\nmperor&#39;s power. \n\nNARA (710 - 794) Imperial court builds new capital, model=\r\ned upon \nChang-an in China, at Nara. Though emperors are Shinto chiefs, the=\r\ny \npatronize Buddhism in the belief that its teachings will bring about \na =\r\npeaceful society and protect the state.\n\nHEIAN (794-1185) Imperial court mo=\r\nves to Heiankyo (now Kyoto) to \nescape domination of Nara&#39;s Buddhist establ=\r\nishment. Official contacts \nwith China stop in 838.\n\nKAMAKURA (185-1333) Mi=\r\nlitary government established in Kamakura by \nMinamoto no Yoritomo. Emperor=\r\n, as figurehead, remains in Kyoto with \nthe court aristocracy.\nMUROMACHI (1=\r\n333 -1568) Muromachi district of Kyoto becomes base for \nShogun Ashikaga Ta=\r\nkauji&#39;s new military government. \n\n1467-1568: The 10 year-long Onin no Ran =\r\n(Onin War) \nAZUCHIMOMOYA MA (1568 -1600) Oda Nobunaga starts process of \nre=\r\nunifying Japan after a century of civil war; he is followed by \nToyotomi \nH=\r\nideyoshi (1536-1598). Foundation of modern Japan is laid.\nEDO (TOKUGAWA) (1=\r\n600 -1868) Japan enters an age of peace and national \nisolation.\n\nMEIJI (18=\r\n68 -1912) The emperor is restored; Japan makes transition to \nnation-state.=\r\n\n\nTAISHO [1912-1926] Japan expands economic base within Asia and the \nPacif=\r\nic.\n\nSHOWA [1926 -1989] Japan experiences World War II and its aftermath, \n=\r\nas well as economic recovery.\n\n\nAnd here is a list of the most prominent cl=\r\nans:\n\nAkechi\nAmako\n(1400-1610)\nGamou\nGo-H=F4j=F4\nHosokawa\nImagawa\nMaeda\nMor=\r\ni\n(1148-1625) \nNagao\nSanada\n(1500-1650)\nShimazu\n(1280-1640)\nTakeda\n(1493-15=\r\n82)\nTokugawa\nUkita\n\nHope this is helps\n\n\n\n\n"
