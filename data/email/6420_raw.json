It will \nbe set in western Japan, around 1550. One of my players, who&#39;s \ncinematic tastes run more to &quot;Sho Kosugi&quot; than to &quot;Kurosawa&quot;, is \ninterested in playing a samurai who specializes mainly in chain \nweapons of one sort or another. I know that the samurai used a great \nmany different weapons over different periods, but chain weapons seem \neither to be restricted to ninja/shinobi or simply later period, Edo-\nera creations. \n\nSo, my question is this: Circa 1550, what options would such a \nsamurai have available to him?\n\nRespectfully, \n\nAndrew Benton\nhttp://www.spearweasel.com\n\n\n\n\n"
