Just real glad ur talking about ebook - its importance to us... \n&gt; F=\r\nor me, this has of real value. At this age of computers, it becomes \n&gt; very=\r\n convenient for us to just view or read whatever we wish to thru \n&gt; the mon=\r\nitor... no need to bring or take with us hardcopies of \n&gt; anything. In our =\r\noffices, in our homes, or wherever pc is available, \n&gt; especially laptops t=\r\nhis time have become so part of us... accessing \n&gt; each word, each picture,=\r\n each important info, each lesson... becomes \n&gt; so easy... Have a wonderful=\r\n day!\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, could anyone, perhaps, care to share me such ebook? =\r\n\nThanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cesar\n&gt;\n\n\nWhen I think of Ebooks, I think of here:\nhttp://=\r\nwww.ereader.com/\nIt is basicaly the amazon.com of Ebooks - they are just di=\r\ngital \nversions of books that exist in print. Nothing wrong with that. I lo=\r\nve \nthem, I occasionaly buy one to read on my palm pilot when I&#39;m on the \nb=\r\nus or killing time at work. I don&#39;t think any of the good classic \njapanese=\r\n history books from the major universities are available \nthough, at least =\r\nnot yet.\n\n\n\n\n"
