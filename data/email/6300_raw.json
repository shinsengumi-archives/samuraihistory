There&#39;s something I don&#39;t understand=\r\n there, and I&#39;d like to.\nAnd while it does not entirely surprise me that so=\r\nme houses despised that ideal, for my own part I think it one of the redeem=\r\ning features of any warrior ethic; and of the sundry values held by sundry =\r\nwarrior societies, it&#39;s one of those I think most important to pursue today=\r\n.  All fighting and no artistry makes Jack a dull boy, so to speak.  I&#39;ve s=\r\neen enough of Musashi&#39;s artwork to recognise real art in it, and those who =\r\nregard Musashi as &quot;soft and poofy&quot; seem to be few and far between.\nThis is =\r\nnot to dispute your history - I&#39;m not such a fool as that - but to reiterat=\r\ne the importance I feel that bunbu ichi carries through to the present day.=\r\n\nThanks again.\n\tGereg\n\n   Date: Mon, 13 Dec 2004 19:17:31 -0600\n   From: An=\r\nthony Bryant &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Japan eras - bunbu i=\r\nchi/bunbu no ichi\n\nSilk Road School wrote:\n\n&gt; James, this is not all that a=\r\nmazing.

That makes no sen=\r\nse in Japanese, where it is, strictly, &quot;bunbu\nichi.&quot;\n\n&gt; This has been trans=\r\nlated as &quot;pen and sword\n&gt; in harmony.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s as good as anything, I guess=\r\n.\n\n&gt; You see, it is not enough to know how to swing a sword.  Even if you r=\r\negard\n&gt; your blade with the deepest respect, even if you practise endlessly=\r\n, that is\n&gt; only a beginning.  You must also attain some cultural accomplis=\r\nhments:  to\n&gt; be able to compose poetry, say, or to draw well.  A samurai w=\r\nho couldn&#39;t\n&gt; exhibit basic literacy would not have been well regarded in p=\r\nolite society.\n\nAh, but that&#39;s the whole point. &quot;Bunbu ichi&quot; was not a set =\r\nrule. It was a\ncontroversy. There were many houses that openly eschewed any=\r\n appearance of the\n&quot;soft, poofy stuff&quot; -- Some houses even maintained draco=\r\nnian punishments like\nbanishment or forced seppuku for those caught studyin=\r\ng literature or playing\ngames or musical instruments; they deemed these pas=\r\ntimes as &quot;unworthy&quot; of the\nwarrior.\n\nOther houses felt that, well, &quot;bunbu i=\r\nchi.&quot;\n\n\n\nTony\n--\n\nAnthony J.

To: Tony Bryant\n\n\nhello tony,\n  com&#39;on man,...i=\r\nt was pretty good.?? I&#39;ve seen a handful &quot;samurai&quot; movies in the past, (and=\r\n yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but this is the 2000&#39;s, n=\r\not the 1900&#39;s (lol). People like to see cool stuff like the Last Samurai ev=\r\nen if it isn&#39;t all that accurate. You can&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve seen any better =\r\nSamurai &quot;battle&quot; scenes in another movies from the past?? (if so, please le=\r\nt me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great movie to boost the S=\r\namurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of people to respect th=\r\nem for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate history stuff & think=\r\n i&#39;m a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome movie. They were like.=\r\n...&quot;Wow, those guys could really kick butt&quot; I don&#39;t know,....maybe i&#39;m wron=\r\ng??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more insentive to practice k=\r\nendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in the making,....delayed =\r\ntemp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watch it again and tell m=\r\ne that\n those battle scenes don&#39;t want to make you get up, build a time mac=\r\nhine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hopefully a good one), =\r\nand fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese back then were only lik=\r\ne 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(lol). Well, my times=\r\n up.
