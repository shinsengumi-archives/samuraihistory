I figured with 900+ people on the list, at\n&gt; least ONE person \n&gt; might come up with something.  It makes sense that\n&gt; Soun just went in \n&gt; on his own, that was what I suspected.  That leads\n&gt; into the second \n&gt; part of my question - I have seen it said that\n&gt; Chachamaru assasinated \n&gt; his father, and also that his father just &#39;died&#39;. \n&gt; Anyone know what \n&gt; the common theory is?\n\nEverything I found while trying to find an answer for\nyou (didn&#39;t find anything beyond the normal, unlike\nTom :( ), said that Chachamaru killed his father.\nSansom says the same. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
