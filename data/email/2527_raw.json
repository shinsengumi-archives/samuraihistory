It developed from straight Chinese and Korean models imported \nfrom the continent. All of which were fighting weapons.\n\tThere is debate about the use of the tachi, I fall in the camp that \nfeels it took on its unique shape to meet the rigors of mounted combat. \nIf we examine the small points of these swords I think it is clear they \nwere not used much for thrusting. Rather they were for slashing from \nhorseback at armours made primarily of heavy silk. At the time the bow \nwas the premier weapon and the sword was a side arm resorted to after \nall arrows had been exhausted.\n\tWe imagine it to have been developed in the tenth century(or perhaps \nearlier) and by the 1100&#39;s was in use by the bushi class all over \nJapan. After the shock of the Mongol invasions, points became stouter \naustensibly because thrusting techniques became more prevalent. Then \nthe whole sword took on grand proportions. Not long after the katana \ncame a long but it was in the mid to late Muromachi that it became the \nsidearm of choice. The tachi continued to be worn by cavalry and in the \nAzuchi-Momoyama we see fighting generals carrying tachi made famous in \nthe days of Yoritomo.\n\tFor example Uesugi Kenshin and Akechi Mitsuhide were known to favor \nBizen Nagamitsu, considered by many to be the top smith from that part \nof the country known as &quot;the sword capitol&quot; of Japan. Edo period \nshoguns wore tachi for ceremonial and to this day we see them worn by \nenthusiasts of Yabusame, which is itself the kind of training a \nKamakura samurai would pursue...\n-t\n\n\t\n\n\n"
