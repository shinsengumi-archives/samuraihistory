Th=\r\nat&#39;s a myth that we tackled in a prior podcast in fact:\n\nhttp://samuraiarch=\r\nives.podbean.com/2011/05/29/ep05-the-myth-of-samurai-giving-up-the-gun/\n\nMo=\r\nst han had gunnery instructors, villages were licensed to use firearms to s=\r\ncare off or kill threatening animals, and guns were a necessity in various =\r\nlocations due to intrusions from Russians in the far North and defense of p=\r\norts in the South.  To put it simply - there were no active wars, so techno=\r\nlogical advancement of guns in Japan wasn&#39;t necessary, but guns weren&#39;t thr=\r\nown away.  The book &quot;Giving Up the Gun&quot; by Perrin is a joke, and has been r=\r\nidiculed and lambasted in the Western and Japanese scholarship for decades,=\r\n but his book is still around because non-Japanese history experts still qu=\r\note it.\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robert McArthur&quot; &lt;rmcart=\r\nhur@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Go here for info on a Japanese flintlock musket circa 1=\r\n650, recently sold at\n&gt; auction:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.proxibid.com/asp/LotDetai=\r\nl.asp?ahid=3D1923\n&gt; &lt;http://www.proxibid.com/asp/LotDetail.asp?ahid=3D1923&=\r\naid=3D10979&lid=3D2938009&gt;\n&gt; &aid=3D10979&lid=3D2938009\n&gt;  \n&gt; Given the Tok=\r\nugawa Bakufu&#39;s renunciation of firearms, my guess is that\n&gt; Flintlocks of a=\r\nny kind were more on the order of a curiosity here or a\n&gt; presentation piec=\r\ne there, than an attempt to acquire stocks of these weapons\n&gt; or to advance=\r\n the science of firearms.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Robert\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"
