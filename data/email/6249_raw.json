It looks good,\nand the hamon appear to be real on the blades they&#39;re describing as real\n(this is promising, since possibly the single fastest indicator of a\npoor-quality reproduction katana is the acid-etched fake hamon most of &#39;em\ncome equipped with), but I don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s worked with any of those\nblades, and images are not an adequate way to judge a blade.\n\n(Truly, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to buy any sword without handling first.\nSome mass-produced blades, assuming you&#39;ve handled a representative\nsampling, might be worth taking the chance on.  ...I can think of the del\nTin family in Milano, for example, and K&K Arts in Prague, whose quality and\nconsistency have generally pleased me... but at that, I&#39;ve even had to\nreturn a del Tin, once, and I find I have to regrind the K&K blades myself\nin order to get appropriate balance and handling.  But then, European-style\nswords are a great deal more forgiving about regrinding.  It&#39;s not a level\nof blade-work I wish to undertake on the polishing job of a decent katana.)\n\nBut individual swords are... well, awfully individual.  I had no intention\nof getting my first Chen &quot;Musashi&quot;; it simply informed me that it was my\nsword and it was going home with me. It was not the first sword I&#39;d ever\nbonded with, to be sure, but it was the first one that felt as though it was\nbonding with me, it was damned well going to be my sword, and I might as\nwell get used to it:  and all this on my first drawing of the blade at that.\nIt wasn&#39;t even the first of that model I handled (bearing in mind that the\nswords in that model vary so greatly that I have yet to see two that will\nfit the same scabbard). It felt not unlike the sensation of a cat deciding\nthat you&#39;re its person.\n\nAnd for those of you who are into the names, that sword is named Abayo.  I\ndo not guarantee my spelling of it, but that&#39;s &quot;&#39;Bye&quot; as I hear Mifune&#39;s\npronunciation.  Its partner - again, assuming I&#39;ve heard the phrase and\nreproduced it correctly - is Kochira-e, or &quot;This way, please.&quot;  (After all,\nyou can&#39;t try and reconstruct Musashi&#39;s niten-ichi without a pair of\nkatana.) Swords tend to acquire names around me, although given my sense of\ntheir personalities, it would almost be more surprising if they didn&#39;t.\n\n...I&#39;d be delighted for anybody&#39;s correction on what I&#39;ve heard and\ntransliterated, by the way.  The best of my linguistic information here is\nno better than second-hand.\n\nIf anyone else is familiar with these blades, they may be able to provide\nyou with a more direct answer.  But the above, for what it&#39;s worth, are my\nthoughts on the matter.  If those thoughts are not my clearest at present,\nmy apologies; please be so kind as to blame whatever small life form is\nworking out its karma against my immune system.  All things considered, at\nthe moment I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not planning to buy a blade on my recommendation!\nBlessings & good faring,\n\tGereg\n\n  Date: Fri, 10 Dec 2004 08:58:19 -0000\n   From: &quot;Dodu Gabriel&quot; &lt;dodu_gabriel@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Toledo swords - veering OT at a dangerous rate\n\n\n\n  Hello Gereg,\n\n  I&#39;m sorry I rushed to write about that site, because on further\nexamination, I have discovered that it is a fake. My mistake...Thank\nyou for helping me and tell me what do you think of this site:\nwww.jidai.jp, although I&#39;m having difficulties at this time buying a\n300 Euros sword...So the site is just a dream, besides, since I don&#39;t\ntake any Kendo or any alike, I wouldn&#39;t know what to do with a sword,\nbut to admire its beauty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
