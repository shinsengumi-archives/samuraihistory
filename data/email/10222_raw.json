Head for a college =\r\nthere. First, leave the swords home. There is nothing they hate more than a=\r\nrmed foreigners. I heard (I never bought one there) that if you buy one at =\r\na souvenir shop that they must be shipped to your home outside Japan. I can=\r\n guarantee they will =C2=A0take them away=C2=A0at customs.\nAs for how they =\r\ntreat Gaijin, it varies. Some will really like you and want free English le=\r\nssons or date you. Then others (like at my former job, mostly older people)=\r\n, will discriminate against you and cause problems. Discrimination is illeg=\r\nal in Japan, but like my lawyer told me when I tried to sue for an on the j=\r\nob injury, no Gaijin will ever win in a Japanese court. \nAll places have go=\r\nod and bad. Enjoy the good there and be careful with the bad. Times are cha=\r\nnging in Japan, but nothing happens over night.\nGood luck to you,\nMark\n\n---=\r\n On Fri, 7/30/10, James &lt;veritas.quest@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: James &lt;ver=\r\nitas.quest@...&gt;\nSubject: [samuraihistory] OFF TOPIC\nTo: samuraihistor=\r\ny@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, July 30, 2010, 6:47 AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nTo anyo=\r\nne in the group who lives in Japan.
