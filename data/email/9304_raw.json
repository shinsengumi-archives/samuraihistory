I&#39;ve been lurking\naround this group for about two or three years without\nposting even once.\n\nIt&#39;s not like i didn&#39;t wanted to ask anything, if you\nare a newbie, the information out there in\nSamuraihistory.com should be enough for starters.\n\nI have to thank you guys for changing my first\nimpression from samurai (hollywood point of view) to a\nmore accurate (i suppose) general overview.\n\nAnyway, i&#39;ve enjoyed the discussions between members\nwith lots of knowledge, like Tony, Kitsuno, and many\nothers, along with their websites.\n\nSo this is what i wanted to ask: I&#39;ve been buying\nlately two manga from dark horse, Lone wolf & cub and\nSamurai executioner. Aside from these fictional\ncharacters (well, i read somewhere that Yamada sama\ndid actually exist), is the information about the\norganization of the social classes and structure of\nsociety somewhat accurate?\n\nDid Tenma-cho, and all that bureacracy that appears in\nSamurai executioner was like that back then?\n\nSimply put: are these sources reliable in historical\nterms?\n\nThank you in advance for your comments.\n\nLe�n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nDo You Yahoo!? \nLa mejor conexi�n a Internet y &lt;b &gt;2GB&lt;/b&gt; extra a tu correo por $100 al mes. http://net.yahoo.com.mx \n\n\n"
