Although the story in the film is significantly different from\n&gt;what actually transpired in 1877, I found a few themes to be common.\n&gt;First, the origin of the Satsuma rebellion was in the dissatisfaction\n&gt;of the samurai at the ending of their way of life. Secondly, as with\n&gt;Ken Watanabe in the movie, Saigo Takamori did indeed have deep\n&gt;respect for the emperor. Finally, the failure of Saigo&#39;s rebellion\n&gt;was partially due to the fact that he was fighting in an old Japanese\n&gt;style, while the Meiji government had westernized their methods.\n&gt;However, it was not really western weapons versus Japanese weapons on\n&gt;the battlefields of the Satsuma rebellion, since both sides used\n&gt;guns. Rather, the Meiji government made much better use of western-\n&gt;style logistics (reinforcements) and communications (the telegraph).\n&gt;The Meiji government was able to get Saigo bogged down in Kumamoto,\n&gt;while they sent in reinforcements and eventually overwhelmed him at\n&gt;Tabaru-zaka.\n&gt;\n&gt;Joe\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , jonathan ellgen &lt;jpellgen@...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree there were historical mistakes, but it was a movie and not\n&gt;intended to be a documentary or re-enactment. I was actually quite\n&gt;pleased with the film despite its short-comings. I felt that it\n&gt;captured several powerful emotions which may have been present at\n&gt;those last moments of samurai existence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But some of the things you mentioned really don&#39;t bother me. For\n&gt;example, the suggestion that an outsider would be taken in the way\n&gt;Tom Cruise&#39;s character was... That is obviously part of what makes\n&gt;the story interesting, not particularly anything historical. We know\n&gt;that William Adams was taken in, as you alluded too, but that hardly\n&gt;would make it a common thing. As far as seppuku is concerned, there\n&gt;was really no end to what type of bladed instrument a samurai might\n&gt;have used.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, while I agree that it isn&#39;t the best source of historical\n&gt;information, I still found it to be acceptable from an entertainment\n&gt;point of view. Film is a much more widely accepted form of media than\n&gt;anime, and I am fairly confident that more English-speaking people\n&gt;were willing to watch Tom Cruise than watch Japanimation. Cruise&#39;s\n&gt;character was, afterall, a civil war captain... Not necessarily a\n&gt;samurai.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jonathan P.
