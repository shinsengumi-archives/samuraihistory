Ian is most definitely into firea=\r\nrms,\nright down to having reproduced a replica of a rare Japanese wheellock=\r\n\npistol for himself. And I concur with Paul, he is a terrifically helpful\nc=\r\nhap. Without his help our samurai re-enactment project, wouldn&#39;t have\neven =\r\ngot off the starting blocks. Not only did he spend a day with us\nstudying t=\r\nhe Snows Hill collection, plus numerous trips to see his own,\nhe lent our a=\r\nrmourer one of his own dou to copy, and gave us a lot of\nthe &quot;insiders&quot; kno=\r\nwledge essential to reproducing high quality replica\narms, armour and cloth=\r\ning. We owe that man a lot:-)\n\nAlso as I mentioned in an earlier post, it w=\r\nas he, together with Stephen\nTurnbull who were responsible for the presenta=\r\ntion of all that new stuff\non the evolution of Japanese firearms at the Arm=\r\nouries a few years back,\nblowing the myth of the European responsibility fo=\r\nr the introduction of\nfirearms to the Japanese out of the water, so to spea=\r\nk. \n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nIn message &lt;20041017073648.43296.qmail@....u=\r\nkl.yahoo.com&gt;,\nRichardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; writes\n&gt;    HI\n&gt;\n&gt;    I=\r\n have met Ian severaL times over tha pst few years at\n&gt;    the armouries.
