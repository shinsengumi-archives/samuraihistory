I would suggest that you make it too\nbit then start cutting down.\n\nI have been reading thris thred with interest as I\nhave been slowly working on some pices myself.If you\nare going to make Japanese armour, you really can not\ndo it from ready books and looking at photos. You are\ngoing to have to do what anyoe else has done, thats\nget to a museum and view as many sets as possible. If\nyou write in advance and talk with the muesum they\nwiill take you into the displays and also to the store\nrooms where I bet that have extra pieces. I handled at\nleast 20 sets of kote before I attempted mine. the\nfirst sleeve took me one month doing an hour or so\nevery day. that included making all my own rings etc.\n\nstart with these mail sites.\nhttp://www.caradoc.org/~iain/gusari.html\nhttp://www.artofchainmail.com/patterns/\nhttp://www.drakyl.com/japanese.php\n\nyou need to handle the mail and the plates to see how\nits constructed.\n\nI was very lucky to have Ian Bottomley show me mail\nand also draw diagrams for me on how to make it.\n\ngo for it its great fun, but you must handle the real\nthings first\n\nPaul\n\n--- mark kd &lt;depos42300@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nHi Dean,\n Thank you very much for replying. Sucks you don&#39;t\nhave time. I have my first child coming in 1-2 weeks\nso i&#39;ll probably understand what you mean. Oh well, i\nthought i&#39;d ask anyways. (you sure,...???? $$$$$$)\nLet&#39;s keep it at that for now, but if you change your\nmind u have my e-mail. Back to that first e-mail u\nsent me about stitching the armor to the\nfabrics...,...a couple more ?&#39;s then i&#39;ll stop\nbothering u for advice.\n \n 1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe?\nOuter Layer(that&#39;s what you see on the outsite), a\nlayer of Cloth Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can\na get that?what size?, a layer of Very Very Very Thin\nLeather(goes under hemp layer), and then the Inner\nShell(goes under v v v thin leather)?is this layer\nleather? do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it\nand then mold it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the\nwhole way down the entire KOTE and stay flexable?\n \n2. I understand stitching the mail down but about the\nplates.. How do sew them down. You talked about a\n&quot;running stitch&quot;???what&#39;s that? i&#39;m not a sewer. Do a\nsew through the metal? Do i predrill little holes?? I\ndon&#39;t understand that part. \n \n3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle\nof a solid panal of mail? \n \n4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions on\nhow to lace lames together????? I just can&#39;t seem to\nget it right. My armor is all flimsy and isn&#39;t very\nrigid. My Lames are about 1.5&quot; wide x 2.5&quot; high\n10gauge stainless steal.(free from work) I need to\nlearn some better methods on lacing them together. I\ndon&#39;t think i have enough hole punch in each lame?\nWebsite&#39;s don&#39;t really go into detail on putting more\nthan 2 lames together.(that sucks) Anyway, if you have\na good technique on lacing Lame armor, please let me\nknow.\n \n                               Thanks for everything\nDean,\n                                     Mark\n                                      \ndepos42300@...\n\nDean Wayland &lt;dean@...&gt; wrote:\nHi Mark\n\nEep!\n\nI&#39;m so sorry, if I had the time I certainly would\nhelp, but sadly I&#39;m\nnot that lucky. I haven&#39;t done much building myself,\nmy eyesight is\nreally bad but I did lead a project to make an armour,\nfor one of my\nfriends. As I said in my reply, I was taking the\nopportunity to get some\nof the data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a\nfew of the\npictures of our &quot;work in progress&quot; posted to my web\nsite, with a short\nexplanation. When I do I&#39;ll post the news here.\n\nMeanwhile, to give you an idea of what you could be\nletting yourself in\nfor: I started researching back in 1986, started\nseriously sorting out\nthe building in 1994 and we still haven&#39;t finished the\ndam thing yet! In\nthe end we more or less gave up, until last year, when\nwe got our butts\noff the deck and knuckled down to doing some more\nresearch and work\n(that awful little four letter word). All the parts we\nhad half done\nwere finished, and we started to look around for a\ndecent smith who\ncould make the other parts for us instead, otherwise\nAndrew, the friend\nin question will be long in his grave by the time we\nactually finish it! \n\nFor myself, earlier this year I gave in and bought a\nJapanese festival\narmour as a sort of stop-gap, I was sick of the great\ntheoretical\narmour, I wanted the real thing, well I got it, er..\nsort of. The\nreplica in question is way under weight and needs a\nlot of work, just to\nmake it serviceable, but a whole lot less than\nstarting from scratch.\nBut I do intend to replace it with something much\nbetter.\n\nThe problem was we started with the idea of doing it\nas right as\npossible, but of necessity we had to make compromises\nas we went along,\nwhich no doubt you will probably have to do as well.\nFor example we\ndidn&#39;t use urushi (Japanese lacquer), due to its cost\nand toxicity. And\nwhen we did the kote (armoured sleeve), kohire\n(&quot;little-fin&quot; brigendine\nshoulder guards) and the tate-eri (&quot;shield-collar&quot;) we\nhad to use\nAmerican doe skin as we couldn&#39;t get the right thing\nfrom Japan. Now, we\ncan and the guys who did the sewing are cursing a lot\nas they know that\nI&#39;m going to &quot;persuade&quot; them to replace it. The dou\n(body armour) we had\nmade is in russet 2mm steel and does look amazing, but\nit doesn&#39;t have\nany gessan yet, but I hope to have that sorted out\nsometime soon, as\nMichael who answered your first email does make armour\nin his spare time\n(spare time? a misnomer I think, would you not agree\nMichael?).\n\nAnyway I wish you the best of luck, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t\ncurrently be of\nmore help, but as soon as I&#39;ve got the stuff up on the\nnet I&#39;ll let you\nknow.\n\nAll the best\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\n\n\nIn message\n&lt;20041109030428.71697.qmail@...&gt;,\nmark kd\n&lt;depos42300@...&gt; writes\n&gt;    hi,\n&gt;      Thank you very much for this info. I&#39;m gonna\ntry it out asap. Do \n&gt;    you know how to make a full suit of samurai\narmor? if so, do you \n&gt;    have any pics? Anything to help me would be\ngreat. Also, in your \n&gt;    step 9 below, you said that you would need lots\nof pics to show me \n&gt;    how to put it all together. Well, i was thinking\nthat the next time \n&gt;    you made samurai armor, you could catalog the\nprocess for \n&gt;    me.(detailed pics and notes). I&#39;m not asking you\nto do it for me \n&gt;    for free if that&#39;s what your thinking. I&#39;ll\ngladly $pay$ you for \n&gt;    your time.(for the pics & notes). I know it might\nbe asking a bit \n&gt;    much but if your interested please let me know. I\nreally want to \n&gt;    make samurai armor but i&#39;m affraid of screwing it\nall up cause i \n&gt;    don&#39;t have a lot of info on how to make it. All i\ngot is a lot of \n&gt;    pics of full-scale size armor and not a lot of\ndetailed pics on how \n&gt;    it all goes together. Well, like i said if your\ninterested let me \n&gt;    know,....please be interested.
