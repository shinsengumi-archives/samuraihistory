It runs the whole gamut of modern \njapan to WWII to Jomon times, but every so often an excellent 12th - \n16th century article appears.  Here is the abstract of one such \narticle I came across while I still had a subscription:\n\nThomas Conlan\nThe Nature of Warfare in Fourteenth-Century Japan: \nThe Record of Nomoto Tomoyuki\n\nAlthough the &quot;rise&quot; of warriors in Japanese history has generated \nconsiderable scholarly attention, the wars that propelled these men to \nprominence have not received the same scrutiny. Recent scholarship has \nrevealed, however, that warfare was instrumental to change rather than \nmerely expressive of it.\nThe outbreak of war in 1331 and destruction of the Kamakura bakufu in \n1333 were catalysts for profound transformations in Japan; to \nunderstand the changes in state and society, we must first explore the \nnature of the warfare that was endemic in this period. This essay \nreconstructs the experience of Nomoto Tomoyuki, a fourteenth-century \nwarrior, in order to examine the nature of warfare.\n\n\n"
