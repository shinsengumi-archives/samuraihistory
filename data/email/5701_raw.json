Certainly if you\ngo to Yahoo or Google and look up images of\n&quot;Hideyoshi&quot;, you&#39;ll see that everyone of them that\ndepicts him as an older man instead of a youth has\nfacial hair. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n"
