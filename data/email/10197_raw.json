Most wounds were deep cuts. Some were bullet wounds by the rifles\n&gt;=\r\n provided by the Portuguese. Not much was written about that as far as I\n&gt; =\r\nknow. As for the dead bodies, they were burned to stop the spread of diseas=\r\ne\n&gt; and as an act of respect for the fallen warriors. For those who were hi=\r\nghly\n&gt; sought after, a reward for that certain Samurai&#39;s head was offered b=\r\ny the\n&gt; Diamyo of his enemy. It had to be a fresh kill. Decomposition made\n=\r\n&gt; identifying the face difficult.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have studied the history of the Sam=\r\nurai not only because it is\n&gt; fascinating but because I am from Samurai blo=\r\nodlines. Specifically the\n&gt; Harubiyuna. Thier kamon is two arrow feathers i=\r\nnside a circle. One pointing\n&gt; upwards, and one downwards. I find myself bo=\r\nth lucky and honored to be the\n&gt; descendant of Samurai. It&#39;s truly somethin=\r\ng to be proud of.
