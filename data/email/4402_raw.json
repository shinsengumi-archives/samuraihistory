Is it just \n&gt;me, or does this door swing like a western style door? I always \n&gt;thought Tea Houses had tiny doors that you practically had to crawl \n&gt;through, anyways. Is this just an oddity? \n&gt;http://www.sushicam.com/2003%20Journal%20entries/September%\n&gt;202003/030907/pages/CRW_1628.htm\n&gt;\nThe tea house in the picture has two doors, which are typical. \nNormally they are both sliding doors, not swiging doors. It is hard to \ntell from the picture but I would guess that there is a very low \nchance that it&#39;s a swinging door.\n\nThe tiny door that you mention is on the right-hand side of the \npicture. It&#39;s knows as the &quot;nijiri-guchi&quot;. This door is used by guests \nat the time of the tea itself. You do have to crawl through it, \nalthough crawl isn&#39;t precisely the right word. It&#39;s more like &quot;slide \non one&#39;s knees while kneeling&quot;. The difference being that the posture \nis kept upright when entering a tea house.\n\nThe larger door on the left is called the &quot;sadou-guchi&quot;. This is a \nbigger (but still small) door that is used by the host. It&#39;s used from \ntime to time to carry things into and out of the tea house. It leads \ninto a small (as you can imagine) room at the back of the tea house \nthat holds all of the tools and materials needed to do tea.\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
