Hideyoshi happened to walk under  \nsuch gate=\r\n, and when he realized that Sen no Rikyu was &#39;above&#39; him, he  \nwas not plea=\r\nsed.\nI am sure this information can be verified, as there are many books  \n=\r\non Hideyoshi and Rikyu. See for example HIDEYOSHI by Berry, or  \nHIDEYOSHI =\r\nAND CHA-NO-YU, a small booklet that should talk about what  \nhappened.\nMost=\r\n likely, Hideyoshi-the-megalomaniac was simply jealous.

I am sure several of you have an opinion on this\n&gt; topic, and=\r\n I wanted your input. It is said that\n&gt; &gt; Sen no Rikyu committed sokotsu-sh=\r\ni after a command from Hideyoshi. I\n&gt; believe that Hideyoshi lost his tempe=\r\nr and later regretted having\n&gt; ordered this, but that is irrelevant perhaps=\r\n. What\n&gt; &gt; I want to know is what the exact reason was for ordering Sen no =\r\n \n&gt; Ryku&#39;s\n&gt; suicide. I read somewhere that Sen no Rikyu refused to offer h=\r\nis\n&gt; daughter as a concubine, but that seems to be a\n&gt; &gt; few years earlier.=\r\n Was there one event, or was this just a build- \n&gt; up of\n&gt; tention after th=\r\nis incident?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jonathan P. Ellgen\n&gt;\n&gt; IIRC, Hideyoshi&#39;s motives are n=\r\not known for sure. Hideyoshi did a  \n&gt; number\n&gt; of horrific and irrational =\r\nthings during the last decade of his life,\n&gt; and this appears to fall in to=\r\n that category. I imagine it would have\n&gt; been over something quite small o=\r\nr petty, and I&#39;ve read that he did\n&gt; indeed regret it afterwards.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Angu=\r\nsH\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; This =\r\nemail (including any attachments to it) is confidential,  \n&gt; legally privil=\r\neged, subject to copyright and is sent for the  \n&gt; personal attention of th=\r\ne intended recipient only.
