How did his presence in Japan shape future Japanese political and \nrelations with Europe, especially Catholic Europe?  \n\n2.  Was Adams directly or indirectly an influence in Ieyasu&#39;s later decision \nto refuse foreigners access to any part of Japan apart from the trading town \nof Dejima, near Nagasaki?\n\n3.  How (if at all) did Adams&#39; knowledge help Ieyasu in his domestic efforts \nto unify Japan under a Tokugawa shogunate?\n\n4.  Having been exposed to modern European shipbuilding and gunsmithing \ntechniques by Adams and other late 16th/early 17th Century Europeans, why did Japan \nnot modernize for another three centuries?  Were they incapable (either \nthrough lack of skills or lack of natural resources), or was this a consious \nchoice?  Either way, what was the practical effect for Japan, internationally and \ndomestically, of failing to modernize?\n\nHope these are helpful.  The first two are pretty simple &quot;historical fact&quot; \nquestions, while the last two could provide fuel for some good debate among \nfolks who have done a bit of prior study on Japanese history.\n\nPerhaps some other listeros could refine or shred these.\n\nCordially,\nPatrick Howard\n\n\n&gt; Firstly I&#39;d like to say hello to you all.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m about to undertake a coursework project at school and was \n&gt; wondering if anyone could suggest some good questions on events \n&gt; surrounding the samurai.\n&gt; \n&gt; My teacher has asked me to see if I can focus on William Adams and \n&gt; some good questions about this man would be much appreciated although \n&gt; other questions wouldn&#39;t go a miss.\n&gt; \n&gt; The questions have to be the usual history type questions that can be \n&gt; debated from certain points of view.\n&gt; \n&gt; All help is much appreciated and thanks in advance.\n&gt; Vince.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
