The first of these\nwould give you a great look at this time period but\ncan be a bit of a pain to get a hold of.  &quot;The heike\nand or Genji Monogatori&quot; (The tales of the heike and\ngenji.) This book can come in two forms singly\nconcentrating on each story or as a compilation.  The\nHeike Monogatori is a fiction work but describes\nclothing and court life succesfully during this\nperiod.  The genji Monogatori is a &quot;True&quot; account with\nsome colorful legends thrown in.  Both give great\ndescriptions of the period. (This book was written in\nthe 1100&#39;s)\n\nNext, I could recommend a Osprey Military Book.  Part\nof the Osprey Elite Series.  &quot;The Samurai 200-1500ad\ngives great color prints of the time period and\ndescribes the times, history, clothing, tactics, and\npeople.\n\nLastly, The Samurai source book can be a great cource\nto pick up quick info regarding any time period in\nJapanese history in which the word &quot;Samurai or Bushi&quot;\nwas used.\n\nAlso, Michigan States Japanese Studies group has put\nout some detailed books regarding this and other\nperiods in Japanese history.  Sometimes concentrating\non particular provinces and or villages.\n\nI hope this could be of some help.\n\nMusashi\n--- Yoshitsune Lion &lt;akodo99@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi, I was hoping someone could tell me the best\n&gt; resource available for \n&gt; information about 12th century Japan - particulary\n&gt; 1160 - 1190. I am looking \n&gt; for detailed information about living conditions,\n&gt; clothing, formal practices \n&gt; - eg rituals etc, food, etc.\n&gt; Basically I am looking for what it would have looked\n&gt; and felt like during \n&gt; that period. So far in all my research I have been\n&gt; unable to find a clear \n&gt; description/image for this period.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thankyou\n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
