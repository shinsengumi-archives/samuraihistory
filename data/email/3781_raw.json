The number before it \nis the actual number of rooms.  If the rooms are a standard 6 Tatami \nsize then a 4 LDK mansion is a good sized apartment.  Not huge by \nwestern standards but very large by Japanese standards.  Am I right \nWilliam?\n\nBrandon\n\nP.S.  I saw Inoue Waka on TV the other day.  I don&#39;t think that she&#39;s \nmuch more than eye candy.  Or maybe she was having a bad day.  \n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter &lt;\nltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- William&Mikiko Letham &lt;mickey.letham@n...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well one out of three aint bad. Well its not a huge\n&gt; &gt; mansion, only a 4LDK\n&gt; &gt; halfway between Osaka and Kyoto and ya can&#39;t beat\n&gt; &gt; that. As for Sawaguchi\n&gt; &gt; Yasuko my wife is more beautiful than her (I have to\n&gt; &gt; say that I want to live\n&gt; &gt; to see another day)\n&gt; \n&gt; What IS &quot;LDK&quot;?
