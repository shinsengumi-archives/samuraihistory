I have learned much from your\nresponses, and have references for further reading. So thank you! In my\nlimited reading, I get the impression the feudal system in Europe has\nparallels in Japanese history. Both had a small population that controlled\nmost of the wealth and power, with everyone else left pretty much to thier\nown devices - as long as there was no boat rocking.\n\n\nOn Sun, Dec 27, 2009 at 7:52 PM, Onnamusha &lt;goatndogg@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess the point of my way-too-long post was that, even though one koku is\n&gt; technically as you say, in real value, after domainal &quot;borrowing back&quot; and\n&gt; pay adjustments, that one koku ends up being significantly less than what it\n&gt; should be--enough rice to feed one person for a year. Thus, a stipend of\n&gt; such-and-such koku ends up being more a measure of rank but not of real\n&gt; income, which varied per retainer household depending on what the domain\n&gt; took out of it before the stipend was paid. And the percentage taken\n&gt; depended at any given time on overall domainal debt and financial condition.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Onnamusha\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
