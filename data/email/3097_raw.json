I want the \ncharacter, an American named Thomas Davidson, to arrive in japan \nfrom the Asian mainland, west of japan.  I plan on him being there \nfrom 1840 till ruffly 1854.  In that time I want him to be expossed \nto as much of the samurai ideals and phylosophy as possable.  I know \nthat this was in the period of isolation but, I was hoping that \nsomeone might be able to help me with ideas as to how he could\n\n1) arrive in the country and not be imediatly executed\n\n2) endear himself to someone who would teach him the ways of the \nsamurai\n\n3) Perhaps be involved in the battle of battle of Tonegawa (1844)\n\n4) perhaps meet Tokugawa Iesada\n\n\n"
