How would a brave Samurai, endowed with the armour of=\r\n tradition and hitherto unchallenged upper-class prerrogatives, would have =\r\ntaken his own defeat by a single blow dealt maybe by the lowest peasant, ho=\r\nlding the unorthodox weapon (again, maybe riflemen were not members of the =\r\nlower classes, but you can correct me on that - if so, how would he take de=\r\nfeat in face of a perhaps less trainned person).\n\nCheers,\n\nThiago\n\n  ----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \n  From: Luis-Gabriel Leal \n  To: samuraihistory@yah=\r\noogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, June 02, 2004 2:17 PM\n  Subject: [samuraih=\r\nistory] Re: Nobunaga as a villain\n\n\n  Well that explains alot then.
