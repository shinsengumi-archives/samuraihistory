Miura Anjin, whose English name was William\nAdams, died nearly four centuries ago, leaving no known image. In\nthe West, what small fame Adams retains is largely due to novelist\nJames Clavell having loosely based the character of John Blackthorne\non him in his blockbuster Shogun. But in Japan, Adams is remembered\nas a man who brought a wider understanding of Europeans, adopted\nJapanese ways to a degree few foreigners master even today and found\nhimself adopted in return.\n\nOf modest education, he rose to become not only a key advisor to the\nruler of a nation vastly different from his own, but also the lord\nof his own manor and the first foreign member of the warrior samurai\nclass.\n\nFinding traces of him involves travelling to remote rural locations\nwhich even today rarely see foreign visitors. Hong Kong-based Walk\nJapan has put together an 11-day guided itinerary linking Adams&#39;\nvarious trading, advising and interpreting activities. The\norganizers, not your run-of-the-mill tour guides but academics\nwho&#39;ve made a thorough study of Adams, have set out a route south\nfrom Tokyo to small ports on the coast of the main island of Honshu,\nthen westward to the smaller island of Kyushu and then to tiny\nHirado, once the base for the British and Dutch traders. There&#39;s\neven a walk on hidden remnants of the ancient Tokaido itself.\n\nAdams, brought up in London&#39;s Limehouse dock area, apprenticed as a\nshipwright and pilot. But it was navigation that became his career,\nand after 10 years on ships trading with North Africa he became the\nprincipal pilot of a disastrous Dutch expedition to the Spice\nIslands of the East Indies.\n\nA series of misfortunes in which the tiny fleet was scattered or\nsunk led to a decision by the remaining two ships, in 1600, to cross\nthe largely uncharted and rarely sailed Pacific. Only Adams&#39; ship De\nLiefde survived, along with a handful of its crew. The lord of the\ntiny Kyushu town where they landed sent Adams as spokesman for his\ngroup to the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, then attempting to gain\ncontrol of the whole of Japan.\n\nIeyasu had a healthy interest in foreign ideas and spent hours\ninterrogating Adams through an interpreter, then imprisoned him\nuntil he decided what to do. Subsequent audiences improved both\nIeyasu&#39;s knowledge of Europe and his respect for the pilot, who was\neventually released and reunited with the remaining survivors.\n\nSeeing a future use for them, he had the men provided with funds and\nordered them to sail to his base at Edo, modern-day Tokyo, then\nignored them while he concentrated on winning total control of\nJapan. The cannon from De Liefde proved of more immediate value,\nhelping him clinch his final victory at the battle of Sekigahara.\n\nAs months went by the decrepit Dutch ship sank and the crew\nscattered, suspecting that they would never be allowed to return\nhome. But Ieyasu had thought of other ways in which their technology\ncould help him. With his battles won he awarded each man an ample\ndaily ration of rice and set Adams an important task.\n\nOur search for Adams/Miura began at Nihon Bashi, the central Tokyo\nbridge which marked the start of the Tokaido and four other ancient\nhighways. It was originally built in 1603, three years after\nIeyasu&#39;s victory, and the year he was officially confirmed as de\nfacto ruler or shogun by a powerless and impoverished emperor.\n\nThat year the shogun, having recognized Adams&#39; worth as a truthful\nadviser on everything foreign, gave him a townhouse near the new\nbridge, amongst the warehouses and shops of Edo&#39;s rapidly developing\ncommercial quarter. A short walk from the current crossing, built in\n1911, we found the navigator had earned himself a place on modern\nmaps. In a narrow turning named Anjin-dori a small, rough-hewn stele\nmarked the site of his residence, mentioning that he instructed the\nshogun in gunnery and mathematics.\n\nThe next morning we boarded a southbound commuter train. At the\nwealthy suburb of Taura we took a taxi to a high point overlooking a\nnaval base where the modern equivalents of Adams&#39; well-armed De\nLiefde wallowed. Adams had a vast estate here, on the Miura\nPeninsula, given him by Ieyasu as a reward for constructing ocean-\ngoing ships in the Western style. These were far more seaworthy than\nJapanese junks, and although Adams had no experience building one\nfrom scratch he produced two vessels. A path led to a thick hedge\nand a stout fence surrounding the graves of Adams, his Japanese wife\nand their two children.\n\nA winding walk down steep residential backstreets led to the station\nat Anjin-zuka (Anjin&#39;s Hill). A few minutes&#39; ride and we disembarked\nat Hemi station. Here a track, with natural tree-root stairways,\nwound over hills, along ridge tops and down to the 13th-century\nGreat Buddha of Kamakura, a 13-metre-high bronze of a serene, seated\nfigure, hands together in its lap. In 1613 Adams came this way in\nthe company of John Saris, an emissary from Britain&#39;s King James,\nwho had arrived bearing a letter requesting trade. Saris and crew\nwere the first Englishmen Adams had seen since his arrival, and he\nbrought them to the shogun to help successfully negotiate the\nprivileges requested.\n\nA picturesque train ride west around the coastline brought us to\nIto, the site of Adams&#39; shipbuilding efforts. The city has erected a\nstatue of the man: gaunt, high-cheekboned and shovel-bearded,\ngesturing out to sea.\n\nWe spent the night at a riverside inn of considerable antiquity, a\nlabyrinth of creaking boards, steep stairways and tatami-floored\nrooms with sliding screens. We changed for the evening into cotton\nyukata gowns, short haori jackets and slippers.\n\nWhen the first Europeans arrived, 50 years before Adams, the\nfastidious Japanese were struck by their gaudy doublets but\nmarvelled that this finery contained men so uninterested in washing.\nAdams eventually submerged himself in Japanese culture and adopted\nlocal dress. Now we did the same. We flapped our way to a basement\nbathing area, scrubbing ourselves spotless before slipping into the\ngeothermally heated waters for a soak, then headed for a feast of\ncolourful dishes, mixed with liberal quantities of beer and local\nsake.\n\nContinuing ever west, at Hatsudenshomae, a few hops by train and bus\nlater, we climbed one of the few remaining sections of the great\nTokaido, the main highway to the west. It snaked up the hillside,\nsome of its original uneven paving still in place-perhaps the very\nstones Adams himself walked on numerous trips between the foreign\ntrading houses at Hirado and the capital at Edo.\n\nAt Kyoto we visited magnificent Nijo Castle, begun by Ieyasu in\n1602, its purpose to make his dominance over the emperor clear. Here\nhe was formally installed as shogun with several days of feasting.\nThe luxury meant to impress Japan&#39;s nobles still remains in the vast\nhalls with their gilded walls and screens painted with scenes of\npines, birds and tigers.\n\nWe travelled on to Miya-jima, a train and boat ride from Hiroshima,\nto see the towering, orange-painted torii, or gate, which seems to\nstride into the sea off the tiny island&#39;s coast. The torii, built in\n1168, was ancient even when Adams passed by here on his way to\nKyushu. He would have gone by ship; we took the bullet train through\na tunnel beneath the placid waters of Japan&#39;s Inland Sea.\n\nJust off Kyushu&#39;s west coast is Dejima, a fan-shaped artificial\nisland constructed to house foreign traders. In 1639, Ieyasu&#39;s son\nHidetada, irritated by Catholic preaching that allegiance to the\nPope took precedence over feudal allegiances, banned all foreigners.\nThe British had already left, but the Dutch, protected because Adams\nhad made clear the distinction between Catholic and Protestant\nteaching, were merely moved to this tiny enclave connected to Kyushu\nby a single, well-guarded bridge. Some of the Dutch colony&#39;s\nbuildings have been recreated and fitted out as excellent museums\nexplaining foreigners&#39; impact on Japan. Adams is remembered in a\npicture of the departure of De Liefde from Holland in 1598.\n\nOur final stop was Hirado, the small island off Kyushu where Dutch\nand British trading houses were first set up. Adams came to this\nremote spot many times. On the hillside above the sleepy little town\nand its quiet harbour we found a small, neat garden of bamboo, pines\nand cycads, with a monument to 17 British merchant-adventurers. The\nstone next to it was something of a surprise: &quot;Miura Anjin&#39;s tomb.&quot;\nWe&#39;d already seen his grave several hundred kilometres away, so it\nseemed that even in death Adams was a traveller.\n\nHe died on Hirado on May 26, 1620, and given Japan&#39;s summer\ntemperatures it seems likely that the island still has him, although\nit&#39;s impossible to say for certain: after the banning of foreigners\nin 1639, the remains of English mariners were disinterred and flung\ninto the sea. Those of Adams may not have been among them, however:\nsuspiciously long bones were discovered nearby in the 1920s. Perhaps\nhe was left undisturbed.\n\nIn a land with few foreign heroes, Beckham&#39;s billboards will have\ntheir day. But what greater sign of enduring respect than to have\nyour name carved in not one, but two tombstones?\n\nposted on 03/30/2005\n\n\n\n\n\n"
