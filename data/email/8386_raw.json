The famed warriors of Kyoto, I \n&gt; thi=\r\nnk they lived sometime around the Genpei War. If you know anything \n&gt; pleas=\r\ne type back, thank you.\n&gt;\nI remember hearing this story from my father. Ush=\r\niwakamaru is the birth \nname of Yoshitsune Minamoto and Musashibo Benkei wa=\r\ns a monk famous for \nhis skill with the naginata. If I remember correctly B=\r\nenkei had vowed \nto collect 1000 swords to sell and build a temple. Ushiwak=\r\namaru had run \naway from his home in Kuramayama temple and learned to be a =\r\nskilled \nswordsman from Tengu the samurai God of the forest. When Ushiwakam=\r\naru \nand Benkei met at the Gojo bridge in Kyoto Benkei tried all of his \nsk=\r\nill against the young boy to no success. Knowing he was in the \npresence of=\r\n greatness he threw down his weapon and became Ushiwakamarus \nmost trusted =\r\ncompanion. \n\nI am going from memory and I&#39;m sure the more highly educated p=\r\neople in \nthis group will send a multitude of messages correcting what I&#39;ve=\r\n \nwritten. So make sure you read these corrections because as like a \nbaseb=\r\nall fan who can recite the batting average of a player in a game \nplayed 75=\r\n years ago, these people really know their stuff.\n\nHirai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
