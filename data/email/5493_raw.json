Now,\n&gt; the Rokkaku, I \n&gt; understand, being the daimyo in southern Omi.  Would\n&gt; the Asai not have been too far \n&gt; west?  And the Saito all but out of the way\n&gt; completely?  Or was it just that they \n&gt; were other power-broking clans that would have to\n&gt; have been dealt with?  Or \n&gt; would the Asai have been trouble for them by virtue\n&gt; of being a Nobunaga ally?\n\nYou don&#39;t have to be directly on the road to Kyoto to\nbe a problem. Look at Asakura Yoshikage for Nobunaga.\nThe Saito controlled the road to Kyoto--the Tokaido\nand Nakasendo intersect at this wee village named\nSekigahara, which is smack in the middle of Mino. And\nthe Asai, well, they are close enough that they&#39;d be\nan issue if they wanted to be. As for allies--they\nweren&#39;t allied to Nobunaga until much later, so that&#39;s\nnot it. \n\n\n&gt;        And as far as the Ikko Ikki needing to be\n&gt; dealt with, it wasn&#39;t a \n&gt; choice of cooperation.  Either you wipe them out or\n&gt; they wipe YOU out.  So in that \n&gt; respect, I agree with what Nobunaga did.\n&gt;        Just my own thoughts.  :-)  Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; L8r\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
