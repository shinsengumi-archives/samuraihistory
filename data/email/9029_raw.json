When that ended we installed a\nlarger exhibition at the Hamilton Art Gallery also in country Victoria.  To look\nat pictures of the Hamilton exhibition please go to:\n\nhttp://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/hamilton/hamilton_2006.html\n\nThe swords on exhibition range from ca1260 to ca1860, all found in Victoria and\nprofessionally restored in Japan by a top artisan.  Each sword has been examined\nby eminent scholars of the Nihonto at the NBTHK sword museum in Tokyo and\nawarded a &quot;paper&quot; certifying its authenticity and art-level (there are 4 ranks\nof &quot;paper&quot;).  This is the largest ever exhibition of properly restored and\nauthenticated Japanese art swords ever held in the Southern Hemisphere.  There\nis also a link to the Hamilton Art Gallery itself, and a link to a downloadable\npdf catalogue - the Gallery are currently charging $5 for the catalogues they\nhave...\n\nI would like to publicly thank and acknowledge the expertise of our mate in\ncollecting, Richard Turner in Perth, for his fantastic help in setting these\nimages up for sharing with others.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n\n\n"
