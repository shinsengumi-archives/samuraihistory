The fact that the Japanese \nactors felt no compulsion to say anything to the director just shows \nthey have no business doing anything but curry commercials.\n\tI can&#39;t wait to see it either, been waiting a long time for \nsomething this to come down the road. The tragedy is that the TRUE \nstory of Tabaruzaka and the restoration battles would make much \nbetter cinema. In the end they always feel they have to dumb it down \nto make it entertaining, assuming the world of moviegoers is on par \nwith television-viewers...\n\tThis reeks of Bakufu-style movie making and as you all know. \n&quot;Ore wa Tobaku, tobaku, mata tobaku!!!&quot;\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
