And wat about all the \n&gt;us citizens of\n&gt;japanese origin that were herded up and put into camps in california. If \n&gt;uve fought in a war and seen death and wat it does to a person then u may \n&gt;make a worthwhile contribution . idiot\n\nDepending upon one&#39;s perspective, while there is a notable difference \nbetween duty and honor, the two generally tend to go hand-in-hand.  In \nrespects to the generalization of Japanese history, being honorable could be \nviewed as a part of one&#39;s duty, depending upon the historical era and the \nregion involved.\n\nIn respects to the subject of war, it&#39;s difficult to determine whether or \nnot it is for an honorable cause.  The &#39;facts&#39; of all wars have been \nnotoriously biased in favor of the victor, so they will generally seem to \nhave had good cause.  It comes down to individual leaders and soldiers \nrather than a war in general.  Should I define WWII by Germany&#39;s \nextermination of the Jews or by America&#39;s use of atomic weaponry?  Should \neither of those definitions drown out the actions of individuals who acted \nhonorably?  And, with more questions, how do we define honor in war and who \ndefines it?\n\nThere are many more questions raised beyond these few.  With each answer, \nwe&#39;re going to find more differing opinions amongst the group members.  \nThis, of course, should help educate each of us in our own way.  Honestly, I \ndon&#39;t place much stock in the opinions of those who are going to throw \ntantrums and exchange pre-schoolish insults.\n\nMaybe I&#39;m over-stepping my boundaries as a newbie who has been on the list \nfor less than forty-eight hours, but I joined this group because I have an \ninterest in japanese culture and history and felt I could learn a bit from \nthose more educated that I.\n\n-Matt\n\nP.S.  Fighting in a war does not provide extra validation to one&#39;s opinions \nor make them any more worthwhile.  Having been a soldier, I, of course, feel \neveryone should serve some military service, but I don&#39;t use that as a \nmeasurement of overall value of a person.  Nor should anyone else.\n\nP.P.S.  This is a cultural history group, not a group of primates flinging \nfeces at one another.  I might be new here, but, please, can some of you put \naside aggressive differences and act as if evolution has actually been \nbeneficial?\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet reliable access on MSN 9 Dial-up. 3 months for the price of 1! \n(Limited-time offer) \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n"
