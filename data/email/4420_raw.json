I would like to \nknow how I can confirm this and how I can find some sort of written \nhistory of the families who served Lord Maeda.(if there are any) \n Shamefully I do not speak japanese so I am at a loss as to where to \nlook besides the japanese sites.\n The names of my ancestors are Tomiyoshi Uno, Ryu Uno, Takuo Uno, \nMahiko Uno, Masamichi and Miyuki Uno, Kumemaro Uno, Yukio Uno, \nMitsuchika Uno, Toru Uno, Yoshiko Uno, Masu (Uno) Domoto, Tome Uno, \nTsuru Uno... Tome was the third wife of Tomimoto... Tsuru Sassa is \nthe mother of Ryu.\n All are burried at Nodayama.\n Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in \nadvance and thank you for taking the time to read this.\n       Sincerly, M. Uno-Eischen\n\n\n\n"
