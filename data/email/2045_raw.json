I am currently writing a story set in \nthe last years of the 16th century (a little bit before Tokugawa took \npower), obviously I need to do research to not mess up too much. In \nthis story I have used the names of Himura, Shimizu, and Iwamura, all \nas powerful clans. The fact is I don&#39;t know about the real history of \nthese clans, just used the names and made up some of their history \nfor the purposes of the story - which is fantasy-based. Then again, \nif I can find out about their history, much better!\n\nWell, that&#39;s all for now, any specific inquiries that I might have \nI&#39;ll let ya guys know. Thanks!\n\nThe Wolf of Mibu\n\n\n\n"
