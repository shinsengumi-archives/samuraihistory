I was actually quite pleased with the film despite its short-comings. I felt that it captured several powerful emotions which may have been present at those last moments of samurai existence. \n\nBut some of the things you mentioned really don&#39;t bother me. For example, the suggestion that an outsider would be taken in the way Tom Cruise&#39;s character was... That is obviously part of what makes the story interesting, not particularly anything historical. We know that William Adams was taken in, as you alluded too, but that hardly would make it a common thing. As far as seppuku is concerned, there was really no end to what type of bladed instrument a samurai might have used. \n\nSo, while I agree that it isn&#39;t the best source of historical information, I still found it to be acceptable from an entertainment point of view. Film is a much more widely accepted form of media than anime, and I am fairly confident that more English-speaking people were willing to watch Tom Cruise than watch Japanimation. Cruise&#39;s character was, afterall, a civil war captain... Not necessarily a samurai. \n\nJonathan P.

I recall helping out (with answers) Tom Cruise and some folks \n connected with the film a few years before it was released to \n theatres. \n \n At least I thought they&#39;d get it to at least resemble Japan after our \n Civil War. The film was set in 1876-1877. This was the same time as \n Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X was laid. The animes were more historically \n correct than the film was. \n \n Some examples--\n \n (SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN TLS FILM)\n \n Several Samurai wearing only one katana\n \n A fallen Samurai committing seppukuu with a tante (dagger or knife) \n rather than using his katana blade\n \n A reference to a field artillery cannon as a &#39;howitzer&#39; years before \n the howitzer was invented.\n \n Samurai participating in covert (spying) operations. Samurai detested \n spying and any other form of deceit. To this end they usually used \n Ninjas for this purpose.\n \n Samurai in 1876-1877 still wearing ceremonial armour into battle and \n allowing an outsider (Cruise as a cavalry captain) to wear the armour \n of the man he killed. I don&#39;t recall Kenshin Himura or even Saitoh \n Hajime wearing armour on RK or SX. \n \n The battle was laughable. No Samurai will wait for an enemy he is \n facing to attack first. Especially when he has the advantage of a \n cavalry charge against infantry. \n \n All things considered I think that Richard Chamberlain (The Shogun) \n did \n a better job as a Samurai than Tom Cruise. Even Chuck Norris would \n have \n been a better choice. \n \n Ken Watanabe was robbed. He deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar \n that year. I did hear he won some anime filming achievement awards \n earlier this year though. \n \n Well more soon.
