Poor grammar and/or ra=\r\nndom emphasis through\ncapitalization will hardly win anyone anything in thi=\r\ns argument.\n\nBuddhism has about as many faces as Judeo-Christian- Islamic t=\r\neachings.\nWhile it is true that there are no specific &quot;gods&quot;, per se, a lot=\r\n of\nthe Hindu gods got mixed up in early Buddhism. The Mahayana\nteachings, =\r\nespecially some of the more esoteric ones, make reference\nto gods and deiti=\r\nes, but put them on a separate plane--the historical\nBuddha (Siddartha Gaut=\r\nama) didn&#39;t dispute their existence, and they\nare, in fact, implied to exis=\r\nt through the very concept of life,\ndeath, and rebirth--you could be reborn=\r\n as a deity if you were very\ngood, but this never actually got you out of t=\r\nhe cycle.\n\nIn India you can see evidence of this in Buddhist board games (t=\r\nhe\nprecursor to our &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;) where there is a path, in the\ncyc=\r\nle of life and rebirth, where you may attain godhood--however, this\nis quit=\r\ne an unfortunate position because you cannot go any further and\nhave no rea=\r\nson to want to escape the cycle, so you become trapped by\nyour own desires.=\r\n\n\nThe kami of Shinto are clearly separate, but were often equated with\nvari=\r\nous buddhas or converted into boddhisatvas, such that there were\noften mult=\r\niple incarnations of the same kami, whether Buddhist or\nShinto.\n\nDefinitely=\r\n the early ritualists of Japan resisted Buddhism, as\ntheocratic power was o=\r\nne of the primary routes for advancement, and\nthe &quot;new&quot; religion did not fa=\r\nll under the hereditary control of the\ntraditional ritualists. Despite thei=\r\nr efforts, however, Buddhism\ngained a foothold, and the syncreticism began.=\r\n In the Nara Period,\nfor example, Kofukuji and Kasuga Taisha were both part=\r\n of the same\norganization dedicated to the spiritual well-being of the Fuji=\r\nwara\nclan. It wasn&#39;t until later (Edo or Meiji period) that the two were\nfo=\r\nrced to split apart into fully separate organizations. I&#39;m not\nsaying that =\r\nthe priests were monks and vice versa, but they were both\nunder the same ad=\r\nministration.\n\nAnother example is the Usa Hachiman shrine, which attempted =\r\nto curry\nfavor with the Buddhists in the court when they reported that Hach=\r\niman\nendorsed Dokyo&#39;s bid to be named emperor. They then retracted their\nbl=\r\nessing, likely at the insistence of Dokyo&#39;s opponents in the court.\n\nStrict=\r\n religionists on either side made the distinction, and it comes\nup not infr=\r\nequently in discussions between them, but the average\nperson had no problem=\r\n reconciling the two beliefs, and it is\ndefinitely the case that there are =\r\nShinto shrines on the grounds of\nBuddhist temples (oddly, I cannot think of=\r\n the reverse). In the Meiji\nperiod, however, in an attempt to return the po=\r\nwer of the Emperor,\nShinto was held up as an example of native Japanese bel=\r\nief while\nBuddhism&#39;s foreign origins were emphasized. The state forced the\n=\r\ninstitutions apart leaving us with the situation we have today.\n\nBTW, as I =\r\nlive in Thailand these days, I can tell you that Buddhist,\nHindu, and local=\r\n Thai spirit houses coexist without issue.\nFurthermore, I have participated=\r\n in a Buddhist ceremony with monks and\na local shaman or Brahman (I&#39;m not s=\r\nure which). Like the onmyoji of\nJapan, there are those who have no problem =\r\nsyncreticizing the\nreligions (though I believe this is still against the st=\r\nrictest\ninterpretations of Buddhism).\n\nOh, and on the issue of &quot;Buddhism&quot; b=\r\neing a Western concept: Is that\nnot the basic meaning of &quot;Bukkyo&quot;? Yes, the=\r\n word is a Western one,\nbut not, I think, the concept.\n\n-Josh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     =\r\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
