By this point Japan has been\nmucking about in Korea and China for decades and showing their talent\nfor colonial administration. I.E. virtually none. Previous to this they\nhad already attacked Americans, read up on the Panay. These actions and\nothers lead to the embargoes and other sanctions. Military dictatorships\ndon&#39;t make good neighbors and are generally poor at diplomacy.\n\n&gt;I also feel that the US has to bear a good portion of the blame -\n&gt;you have to remember that the Japanese people&#39;s only experience of the US\n&gt;was being forced to trade at gunpoint, and the US invasion of Hawaii because\n&gt;they were holding a referendum which would have made Hawaii a Japanese, not\n&gt;American, state.\n&gt;\nThe original treaty also dealt with treating shipwrecked sailors like\nhumans and other things along those lines, this is close to 90 years\nbefore, I&#39;ve never heard of the referendum to make Hawaii a Japanese\nstate, I doubt it would have come close to passing since the number of\nanglos, Hawaiians and Chinese far exceeded the number of Japanese on the\nisland. Even if just the Hawaiians voted, they felt they could stay an\nindependent country at the time. The US backed coup came as an\nunpleasant surprise. P.S. Look up the difference in the US between a\nterritory and a state, It took about 60 years for Hawaii to become a state.\n\n&gt; Plus in nearby Phillipines they had seen the Americans\n&gt;invade the islands and then keep it as a colony. Are they the actions of a\n&gt;state that you would trust in their position?? I suppose it is little wonder\n&gt;that no diplomatic solution was ever reached.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWe were late to the colonial game, so we got the leftovers that the UK,\nFrance and Germany didn&#39;t want. We should have freed them like we did\nwith Cuba. This still has little bearing on Japan&#39;s actions, they were\nan aggressive, expansionist, military dictatorship that had set out to\nconquer Asia, this would have lead to war no matter what and the US\ntried diplomatic means to prevent it including not going to war over\nattacking US citizens and soldiers.\n\nIn some ways these does show samurai spirit, a bunch of bloody minded\nkillers who are going to take what they want and only understand force\nas an argument. Which makes them no different from their European\ncounterparts.\n\nJim\n\n\n"
