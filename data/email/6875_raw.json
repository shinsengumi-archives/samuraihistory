The ginkaku-ji wasn&#39;t meant to be covered\n&gt; in silver. The \n&gt; name merely alludes to the Kinkaku-ji, that might\n&gt; explain the \n&gt; misconception. \n\nI think it&#39;s a myth that even the Ginkakuji may at\ntimes perpetuate, depending on who you ask. Apparently\nanother poster got a different answer than I did. But,\nI still believe it&#39;s simply a comparison between the\ntwo, since the buildings are so similar. \n\n In the\n&gt; second month of \n&gt; the third year of Bunkyu (1863), nine men, followers\n&gt; of the Shinto \n&gt; zealot Hirata Atsutane, broke into the Toji-in [a\n&gt; temple in Kyoto] \n&gt; and removed the heads of the statues of the first\n&gt; three Ashikaga \n&gt; shoguns: Takauji, Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu. They\n&gt; then exposed the \n&gt; heads on a bank of the Kamo river, following the\n&gt; common practice at \n&gt; this time of &#39;patriots&#39; exposing for all to see the\n&gt; heads of men \n&gt; accused of being traitors. Beside the heads of the\n&gt; three shogun, \n&gt; placards were set up enumerating the crimes of each.\n&gt; Yoshimitsu&#39;s \n&gt; acceptance of the title of King of Japan made him\n&gt; the worst traitor \n&gt; of all.&quot;\n\nThis is also when Takauji becomes a villain in the\neyes of many Japanese, since he essentially\nback-stabbed the imperial attempt to seize power from\nthe Kamakura bakufu. I do find it interesting that you\ndon&#39;t find any reference to Yoritomo&#39;s &quot;head&quot; being\nstuck anywhere. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
