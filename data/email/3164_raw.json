With 40 years of reading under my belt heaven knows\nwhere I read that snippet, but it IS stuck in my memory.  Often I find it better\nto comment while something is current, rather than wait the x months it takes\nfor me to find it in my archives and give the reference long after the thread is\nas cold as rigor mortis!!  I could have read it in the English To-ken Society&#39;s\n&quot;Programme&quot;, but I will keep an eye out for it as I trawl my books and journals.\n\nJust before sending this I did a google search using &quot;uesugi kenshin&quot; thinking I\nmight find the gun-slicing story - but, alas - I found instead some 1,530 hits\nand gave up almost before I&#39;d started.  However, this might be interesting\nstaright off for those with a particular interest in kenshin:\n\nhttp://www.nbz.or.jp/eng/uesugibio.htm\n\nBest regards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\nCarlo wrote:\n&gt; O-Kanehira at the times of Kenshin most likely was\n&gt; in possess of the Ikeda family, accordingly to their records.\n\n Tom Helm wrote:\n&gt; Barry et al-\n&gt; You know I have a number of books focused on famous generals and their\n&gt; swords. I tend to focus my studies on the Historical aspects of\n&gt; Nihonto. I have heard some tall tales but never this one. I have a long\n&gt; to-do list but will try to look into it. If you do find a reference I\n&gt; should be very interested to hear it.\n&gt; -t\n\n\n\n\n"
