I am mostly interested in the\n&gt; military aspect of \n&gt; the samurai but would like to become more familiar\n&gt; with their \n&gt; culture and way of life.  any help would be greatly\n&gt; appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; nick\n\nWell, you found us, so that&#39;s a start. \n\nNormally I just give the website\n(www.samurai-archives.com) and tell people to go to\nthe recommended reading, and I&#39;ll tell you that too.\nBut a good base place to start would be two authors:\nour own Anthony J. Bryant (or Tony, to those of us who\nhave been abused by him here) has written several\nbooks--just type his name into Amazon and that should\nget you started; also, I&#39;ll go ahead and recommend\nStephen Turnbull--you&#39;ll hear both good and bad about\nhis books. The good is that there are certainly a lot\nof them, and they are fairly easy to read and cover\nthe topics most people want to read about. The bad is\nthat many of his books are repetitive, and sometimes,\nespecially in his older books, he&#39;s not completely\nright about things (he mostly corrects them in later\nbooks, as far as I can tell). \n\nThose are probably the easiest places to get\nstarted--after that, just work your way down the\nrecommended reading list, and keep following the\nthreads here--new books usually get mentioned and\ndiscussed. \n\nNate\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
