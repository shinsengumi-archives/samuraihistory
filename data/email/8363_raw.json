I believe that the\n&gt; strategic concepts inherent in Yagyu Shinkage-ryu, the\n&gt; sword art practiced and chosen by the Shogunate as one\n&gt; of its official styles, guided them in their decision\n&gt; making.\n\nI rather think it had more to do with their politics and \ntheir alliances than their school of swordsmanship.\n\nMartial arts were never the be-all and end-all of Japanese \nhistory, despite the illusions of some modern dojo masters.\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
