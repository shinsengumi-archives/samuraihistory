I don&#39;t expect to be able to contribute\n&gt; very much as, quite frankly, most of you guys seem\n&gt; WAY out of my league. \n\nHeh, we talk a good game...seriously, most of us here\nare amateurs who read a lot. Feel free to jump in\nanytime!\n\n If\n&gt; Kublai Khans invasion force had not been destroyed\n&gt; by the &quot;Divine wind&quot; in 1281. Who and why do you\n&gt; think would have emerged victorious, the Mongols or\n&gt; the Japanese ? \n\nGood question. \n\nI have thought about this a good deal\n&gt; and I think It would have been the Japanese, mainly\n&gt; because of the Mongols not being able to maintain a\n&gt; supply line. On the other hand, apart from a\n&gt; relatively minor clash in 1221, there had been no\n&gt; real warfare in Japan since the Gempei war. Where as\n&gt; the Mongols were battle hardened. However, I am sure\n&gt; this is all very open to debate. Any takers? \n\n1. Mongol supply lines: The Mongols sure were not\nseamen, but neither were the samurai. Apart from a\nhandful of pirates, most Japanese didn&#39;t venture into\nthe water, and &quot;sea battles&quot;, even Dannoura, etc.,\nwere merely land battles fought on boats. Crash into\nthe enemy, hop aboard, take his head...not much\nseamanship involved (Yeah yeah, tides at Dannoura,\nwhatever...it was no Trafalgar). \n\nBeing as the Mongols relied on Korean and Chinese who\nhad much more sailing experience than either the\nMongols or the Japanese, I think it&#39;s conceivable they\ncould have maintained their supply lines. If they\ncould transport supplies 1,000&#39;s of miles between\nChina and Poland, I don&#39;t think the Strait of Tsushima\nwas that difficult for them. \n\n2. Lack of Japanese combat since 1221...\n\nIn individual combat, this wasn&#39;t a problem. The\nJapanese matched up quite well, once they realized\nthat shouting their lineage to a foe who didn&#39;t\nunderstand it was just making them vulnerable to\narchers. The problem wasn&#39;t so much lack of\nexperience, it was lack of experience in the KIND of\nwarfare the Mongols fought. I don&#39;t think the army of\nMinamoto Yoshitsune would have done well in a pitched\nbattle against Mongol armies. I really don&#39;t think\nanyone would have had a chance until the Sengoku\nperiod. Japanese simply didn&#39;t fight in organized\nformations, reacting to signals, etc., like the\nMongols did. Had the Mongols been able to land in\nforce and establish a coherent beachhead, the course\nof history would be very different. Of course, you\nhave to look at the fact that much of the &quot;mongol&quot;\narmy were Korean and Chinese conscripts who had no\ndesire to be there, and wouldn&#39;t have been all that\neffective, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that a Mongol\narmy would have had it&#39;s way with an equivalent\nsamurai army in a pitched battle on open terrain. \n\n3. HOWEVER...as Kusunoki Masashige would prove 50\nyears later, the Japanese could adapt to guerrila\nwarfare very easily. The Mongols would have found it\nvery hard to garrison Japan, and wouldn&#39;t have ever\nhad a true hold on it, I believe. Their usual\ntechniques of razing the main cities would only harden\nJapanese resistance against them. Think Mongols =\nRussians, Japanese = Afghans. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
