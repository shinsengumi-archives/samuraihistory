As for English not being your native\nlanguage--YOU are the one that all these other people\nmust be learning to hate. Your writing skills were\nQUITE good--if it&#39;s not your native language, then\nTHEY have no excuse. WELCOME!!!! (and so that we know,\nwhat is your native language?) \n\n&gt;  Anyway, since I am digressing, I&#39;ll get to the\n&gt; point. I would like to know the chronologic order of\n&gt; the japanese eras, eventually before Heian Period,\n&gt; and up untill The Meiji Restoration, at least the\n&gt; most important ones, since I understand that an era\n&gt; would have started and ended whenever a personality\n&gt; (daimyo, general or military prominent person) would\n&gt; have realised something extraordinary (please\n&gt; correct me if I am wrong...I realise the probability\n&gt; that I am is high, so any correction would be whole\n&gt; heartedly welcome). I am asking this because I need\n&gt; a sort of &quot;backbone&quot; from which I can learn more.\n\nOoh, that&#39;s a toughie. You are referring to year\nperiods, I assume? There are a lot of them. The best\nlist I know of is here:\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/kanji/nengo.htm\n\nThat only begins in year 1201, but does give the kanji\nfor each period, and the alternate periods. I&#39;ll see\nif I can dig up anything prior to that. As for\nchanging the period name, it was the Emperor who did\nthat--not the daimyo, Shogun, or any military person.\nSomeone else may have &quot;suggested&quot; to the Emperor that\nit would be a good time for a name change, but it was\nthe Emperor who actually did it. Reasons for changing\nincluded a portentous sign, a natural disaster, a\nparticularly good event, or just because they&#39;d gone\nlong enough. \n\n&gt; mostly use the www. So, here is a list of sites that\n&gt; I use, please tell me if they are ok:\n&gt; 1. Jeffrey&#39;s Japanese-English Dictionary Server at\n&gt; www.solon.org (EDICT)\n&gt; 2. Jim Breen&#39;s Japanese Page\n&gt; 3. Nagasaki University Old Picture Database\n&gt; 4. www.kanjisite.com\n&gt; These are my &quot;personal favorites&quot;, if I can call\n&gt; them that.\n\nGimme some time to check them out, and I&#39;ll get back\nto you :)\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
