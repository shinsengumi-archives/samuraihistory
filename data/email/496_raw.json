Nobunaga I believe had signed a truce\nwith the Bessho family in Harima, and as was customary\neach side sent hostages (hitojichi?). Bessho Nagaharu\nwas sent to Nobunaga, and Nobunaga sent Akechi\nMitsuhide&#39;s mother. Some time later Nobunaga decided\nto go back on this truce and killed Nagaharu. The\nobvious response for the Bessho was to kill\nMitsuhide&#39;s mother. \n\nAdditionally, Mitsuhide suffered several humiliations\nat the hands of Nobunaga, who seemed to enjoy\n&quot;screwing with him.&quot; noted incidents include his\nfiring of Mitsuhide as the organizer of one of\nNobunaga&#39;s big wig parties in Kyoto in 1582, shortly\nbefore his betrayal. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nNate\n\n--- Jeff Mayo &lt;irishman_2k@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Question: I seem to recall reading from one source\n&gt; that the reason Mitsuhide \n&gt; slew Nobunaga is that while Nobunaga was besieging a\n&gt; castle he decided to \n&gt; burn it down. From what I remember, Mitsuhide&#39;s\n&gt; mother was inside and while \n&gt; Nobunaga knew this he still set the castle on fire.\n&gt; Problem is I cannot find the source that I read this\n&gt; from. Does anyone know \n&gt; if this is indeed what happened?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff M.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device:\n&gt; http://mobile.msn.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
