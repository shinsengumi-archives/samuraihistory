Samurai only wore armor in battle.  In kendo you have to wear all those guards.  I would the modern style for swords nowadays is a samurai sword.  They are very decorated (handles, blades and such).  They are more fore decorational purposes though.\n\nQuauhtli Olivieri &lt;shinsongumi@...&gt; wrote:The closest style of modern martial arts is kendo.\n\n                                                                      Quauhtli\nsean_03809 &lt;sean_03809@...&gt; wrote:\nWhat is the closest modern martial style to what the Samurai \nlearned.
