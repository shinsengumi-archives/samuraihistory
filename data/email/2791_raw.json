Of course,  no kanji here is carved on stone!  From the \nearliest days,  figurines called haniwa were found in Japanese tombs.  Many of these \nwere likenesses of warriors in full armor.   We can assume that from at least \nthe Nara Period,  circa 700,  horses had already been introduced into Japan, \nmost likely from the three kingdoms on the Korean peninsula.  In a country \nriven by war like Japan, inevitably the horses would be used by mounted warriors.  \nTherefore, I would submit that this may be taken as perhaps the first \nappearance of bushi, or warriors, into Japanese life. By the time of the Gempei War \nof 1160-85,  the bushi began, in weapons, sword and bow, and in armor,  to take \non more of the characteristics of the samurai we recognize today.   Of \ncourse, at no time does it appear that the world bushi actually was replaced by the \nterm samurai; by the same token, the English word &quot;sergeant&quot; has been used as \nthat of a commander of men at least from the time of the battle of Agincourt \nin the Hundred Years War in 1415.   Certainly from the time of the Gempei War, \na samurai was considered a warrior who owed loyalty, fealty,  to his daimyo, \nor lord.  Those samurai who lost their master were, of course,  known as the \nronin.  The period of the Age of the Country at War saw the greatest flowering \nof the samurai in  Japanese military history.  Of course,  this definition is \nsubjective, and only intended to stimulate further discussion.  Concerning \nBushido,  I would invite Tom Helm to offer a definition.  All the best,  Jack \nMurphy,  The Japan Foundation.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
