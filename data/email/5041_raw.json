(There I said it, I apologize for \nopening the can of worms, the gorefest begins with me I guess). When \none suddenly separates a human head from a human body there is a great \ndeal of blood pressure to be released, if you cut the head off \ncompletely it is likely to fly across the room, spattered in blood and \nroll to the foot of the witnesses. Hardly what I would report to my \nsuperiors as a &quot;tidy&quot; end.\n\tIf one were performing executions then there were deep pits and lots \nof sand provided and there was no compunction about removing heads \ncompletely, afterall these are criminals. The reason Kaishaku is \nperformed with a single-hand stroke is because we want to leave just so \nmuch skin on the front side of the throat so that the head will simply \n&quot;fold&quot; onto the chest (into the lap).\n\tI suggest you try tameshigiri with the target inclined 45 degrees or \nso, with very little practice I think you&#39;ll find that the one handed \ncut as taught in Eishin Ryu naturally allows you to leave just one or \ntwo layers of the goza uncut and the target will simply fold over. \nThere really is no need in this case for any additional cut.\n\n-t\n\n\n"
