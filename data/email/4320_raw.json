I have been interested in it for a long \ntime, especially in the code of the Samurai, the Bushido, as it \nseems to me to be an excellent way to live ones life. I am now \ntrying to learn about the history of the Samurai order, however i \nknow very little. Is it possible someone could recomend some \nstarting literature or websites that would be beneficial to me? My e-\nmail address is wolfscryanddragonsbreath@... If you do have \nany help, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanking you all in advance! :-)\n\nIan\n\n\n"
