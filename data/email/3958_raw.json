Miyamoto Musashi was very famous in the U.S.A due to his book,(A \nbook of five rings) however just cause he was famous in the US \ndoesn&#39;t mean the most famous around the world, or does it? and \nalthough the question was &quot;who is the most famous samurai&quot;, doesn&#39;t \nmean that he was the best (going out of contexts hear)but anyways. In \nJapan Yagyu Jubei was the famous and romanticized of the samurai in \nJapan&#39;s feudal era. anyways enough of my crap hope this help.\n\n\n\n"
