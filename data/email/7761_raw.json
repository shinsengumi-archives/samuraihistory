You might as well ask me to explain Zen to a two year old.  \nI know it&#39;s the soul and character of Japan and the reason for why it \nfascinates  me to no end. It&#39;s a sense of indentity to a country, a sense of duty, \nhonor,  and love of country. To explain Bushido, explain Zen. These are my own \nrambling  thoughts that may or may not answer the question. But I do believe \nthat Bushido,  Soul of Japan, is the core to understand a Sumurai and what he is \nor believes. A  good book on the subject is &quot;Bushido; Soul of Japan,&quot; By Inazo \nNitobe. Also  worth reading, &quot;Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai.&quot; By Yamamoto \nTsunetomo.\n                                                                              \n             david a sigler\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
