Please correct me  if I am incorrect.  \n&gt; GOD BLESS ALL\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nJames, Angel et al -\n\tI would have to disagree with the above. Though the policy of  \nisolation was Bakufu policy, the Tokugawa government was more engaged  \nwith and better informed of the outside world that the Imperial court  \nin 1853. For years they had traded with the Dutch, kept up on  \ndevelopments in Europe and even sponsored schools of Western studies.\n\tAfter the coming of Perry, they were loathe to trade with the West  \nbut saw few alternatives, they chose to accomodate the Foreign powers  \nuntil they could stand on equal footing and perhaps drive them out.  \n(No one in Japan really wanted the Foreigners there) The Court  \nhowever, insisted that the Bakufu fulfill its mandate and immediately  \ndrive them out. When they chose not to do so, many in the country saw  \nthis as treason against the emperor and perhaps sensing weakness  \nbegan calling for the expulsion of Foreigners and the Restoration of  \nthe Emperor.\n\tMany of the most xenophobic Shishi did not live to see the  \nRestoration, those that did had to either adapt or be left behind. In  \nthe end the pragmatists within the new government chose the same  \npolicy as that of the Tokugawa; to accomodate the Foreigners, learn  \nall that they could from the West and then use Western technology to  \ndrive the barbarians out. They nearly succeed, but by the time of the  \nGreat Pacific War their dream had become so twisted, and they so  \ncorrupt it could never last.\n\tYou are forgetting BTW, my favorite, Hitokiri Hanjiro, who later  \nbecame known as Kirino Toshiaki...\n-t\n\n"
