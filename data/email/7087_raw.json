My comment was directed at the \n&quot;real ninja masters&quot;--&quot;Stephen K. Hayes&quot; connection, and it was a \nlighthearted one at that; I even remembered to include the smiley!\n\n   I never did say anything about the documentary itself -- I simply \ndon&#39;t have enough information to comment about it positively, neutrally \nor negatively.\n\n   Given that you&#39;ve mentioned, elsewhere in this thread, that you \nrealise Hayes isn&#39;t credible, I don&#39;t see why you&#39;re reacting so strongly.\n\n-- \nPhil\nMen with sharpness of mind are to be found only among those with a \npenchant for thought. -- Shiba Yoshimasa\n\n\n\n"
