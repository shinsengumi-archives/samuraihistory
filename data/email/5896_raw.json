How naive am I\n\n&gt; Secondly, I am of a similar situation, interested more\n&gt; in Japanese history (started by Shogun Total War) and\n&gt; culture in general (anime fan myself), than of the\n&gt; history of my own culture.\n&gt; \n\nIsn&#39;t it such a cool game, played it for hours. Think I played it \ncontinuously until Medieval came out. he he  :)\n\n&gt; One good thing about living in Singapore is that we do\n&gt; get to watch historical dramas made by PRC (far more\n&gt; authentic than what ROC and HK churns out).\n&gt; \n\nYou wont believe me when I tell you this but my grandparents and two \nuncles live in Singapore. Ang Moo Kua, actually (think that how you \nspell it) have been there a few times. What a coincidence\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t think your swords and clothes should be as good as those of \nother people. Be content as long as they don&#39;t look awful. Once you \nstart acquiring what you don&#39;t have and become even poorer, you&#39;ll \nbecome a laughingstock.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThanks for the help and Love this saying, is so true.\n\nZev\n\n\n\n\n"
