Sucks you don&#39;t have time. I have my first child coming in 1-2 weeks so i&#39;ll probably understand what you mean. Oh well, i thought i&#39;d ask anyways. (you sure,...???? $$$$$$) Let&#39;s keep it at that for now, but if you change your mind u have my e-mail. Back to that first e-mail u sent me about stitching the armor to the fabrics...,...a couple more ?&#39;s then i&#39;ll stop bothering u for advice.\n\n1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe? Outer Layer(that&#39;s what you see on the outsite), a layer of Cloth Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can a get that?what size?, a layer of Very Very Very Thin Leather(goes under hemp layer), and then the Inner Shell(goes under v v v thin leather)?is this layer leather? do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it and then mold it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the whole way down the entire KOTE and stay flexable?\n\n2. I understand stitching the mail down but about the plates.. How do sew them down. You talked about a &quot;running stitch&quot;???what&#39;s that? i&#39;m not a sewer. Do a sew through the metal? Do i predrill little holes?? I don&#39;t understand that part. \n\n3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle of a solid panal of mail? \n\n4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions on how to lace lames together????? I just can&#39;t seem to get it right. My armor is all flimsy and isn&#39;t very rigid. My Lames are about 1.5&quot; wide x 2.5&quot; high 10gauge stainless steal.(free from work) I need to learn some better methods on lacing them together. I don&#39;t think i have enough hole punch in each lame? Website&#39;s don&#39;t really go into detail on putting more than 2 lames together.(that sucks) Anyway, if you have a good technique on lacing Lame armor, please let me know.\n\n                               Thanks for everything Dean,\n                                     Mark\n                                       depos42300@...\n\nDean Wayland &lt;dean@...&gt; wrote:\nHi Mark\n\nEep!\n\nI&#39;m so sorry, if I had the time I certainly would help, but sadly I&#39;m\nnot that lucky. I haven&#39;t done much building myself, my eyesight is\nreally bad but I did lead a project to make an armour, for one of my\nfriends. As I said in my reply, I was taking the opportunity to get some\nof the data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a few of the\npictures of our &quot;work in progress&quot; posted to my web site, with a short\nexplanation. When I do I&#39;ll post the news here.\n\nMeanwhile, to give you an idea of what you could be letting yourself in\nfor: I started researching back in 1986, started seriously sorting out\nthe building in 1994 and we still haven&#39;t finished the dam thing yet! In\nthe end we more or less gave up, until last year, when we got our butts\noff the deck and knuckled down to doing some more research and work\n(that awful little four letter word). All the parts we had half done\nwere finished, and we started to look around for a decent smith who\ncould make the other parts for us instead, otherwise Andrew, the friend\nin question will be long in his grave by the time we actually finish it! \n\nFor myself, earlier this year I gave in and bought a Japanese festival\narmour as a sort of stop-gap, I was sick of the great theoretical\narmour, I wanted the real thing, well I got it, er.. sort of. The\nreplica in question is way under weight and needs a lot of work, just to\nmake it serviceable, but a whole lot less than starting from scratch.\nBut I do intend to replace it with something much better.\n\nThe problem was we started with the idea of doing it as right as\npossible, but of necessity we had to make compromises as we went along,\nwhich no doubt you will probably have to do as well. For example we\ndidn&#39;t use urushi (Japanese lacquer), due to its cost and toxicity. And\nwhen we did the kote (armoured sleeve), kohire (&quot;little-fin&quot; brigendine\nshoulder guards) and the tate-eri (&quot;shield-collar&quot;) we had to use\nAmerican doe skin as we couldn&#39;t get the right thing from Japan. Now, we\ncan and the guys who did the sewing are cursing a lot as they know that\nI&#39;m going to &quot;persuade&quot; them to replace it. The dou (body armour) we had\nmade is in russet 2mm steel and does look amazing, but it doesn&#39;t have\nany gessan yet, but I hope to have that sorted out sometime soon, as\nMichael who answered your first email does make armour in his spare time\n(spare time? a misnomer I think, would you not agree Michael?).\n\nAnyway I wish you the best of luck, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t currently be of\nmore help, but as soon as I&#39;ve got the stuff up on the net I&#39;ll let you\nknow.\n\nAll the best\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\n\n\nIn message &lt;20041109030428.71697.qmail@...&gt;, mark kd\n&lt;depos42300@...&gt; writes\n&gt;    hi,\n&gt;      Thank you very much for this info. I&#39;m gonna try it out asap. Do \n&gt;    you know how to make a full suit of samurai armor? if so, do you \n&gt;    have any pics? Anything to help me would be great. Also, in your \n&gt;    step 9 below, you said that you would need lots of pics to show me \n&gt;    how to put it all together. Well, i was thinking that the next time \n&gt;    you made samurai armor, you could catalog the process for \n&gt;    me.(detailed pics and notes). I&#39;m not asking you to do it for me \n&gt;    for free if that&#39;s what your thinking. I&#39;ll gladly $pay$ you for \n&gt;    your time.(for the pics & notes). I know it might be asking a bit \n&gt;    much but if your interested please let me know. I really want to \n&gt;    make samurai armor but i&#39;m affraid of screwing it all up cause i \n&gt;    don&#39;t have a lot of info on how to make it. All i got is a lot of \n&gt;    pics of full-scale size armor and not a lot of detailed pics on how \n&gt;    it all goes together. Well, like i said if your interested let me \n&gt;    know,....please be interested. Thanks again,\n&gt;                                                                                  \n&gt;    Mark\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
