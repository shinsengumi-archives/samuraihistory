The reason why I say the true dynasty is because the \n&gt;Tokugawa clan was the first to unite the whole of Japan. Before this \n\nI disagree with this answer. Or maybe it&#39;s better for me to say that \nthis is a very simplistic answer to a question that has not really bee\nn clarified yet. I don&#39;t think that anyone can answer the question unt\nil we understand what the original poster means by &quot;early dynasties&quot;.\n\nI hope that the original poster does not take this essay and start \nusing it as the basis for tutoring other people about Japanese \nhistory.\n\nI don&#39;t think there is any way to say that the Tokugawa were the first \n&quot;true&quot; dynasty.\n\nAnd, shogun does not mean &quot;King&quot;.\n\n&gt;Before this \n&gt;there was may warlords ruling different provinces. \n\nWhy does this fact mean that anything before Tokugawa does not \nqualify as a dynasty? In fact if you look at each of the &quot;provinces&quot; \nthemselves, the ruling families in each of them tended to be \ndynasties - in the sense that the ruling family tended to hold control \nacross generations. Further those same warlord families continued to \nrule the provinces even during the Tokugawa era.\n\n&gt;Another thing to \n&gt;bear in mind is that when the Tokugawa shogun united Japan a new era \n&gt;in Japan began (edo period). Below is a list of the different periods \n&gt;in Japanese history:\n\nThe naming of eras does not provide a measuring stick for what is \nand what is not a dynasty. Even if it did, your own list shows two \nother eras, Kamakura and Muromachi, that had their own name and that \nwere ruled by different shogun families.\n\nThis timeline is handy as a quick reference point. But of course it \noversimplifies and makes too many assumptions to be used as a basis \nfor . Did you get it from this site?\nhttp://www.askasia.org/frclasrm/readings/t000013.htm\n\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
