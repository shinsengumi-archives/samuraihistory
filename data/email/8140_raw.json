But I suspect we all have our &quot;favorites&quot; for \n &gt; whatever disparate reasons there may be.\n &gt; \n &gt; Certainly he was considered one of the paragons of samurai \n &gt; virtue -- but, oddly enough, more *after* the Meiji \n &gt; Restoration than before it. Well, not so oddly, really, when \n &gt; one considers that he fought for the emperor against a \n &gt; samurai government... &lt;G&gt;\n &gt; \n &gt; \n &gt; Tony\n \nYeah, I would consider Masashige the samurai ideal. He&#39;s definately one\nof my favourites, along with Yoshitsune and, for some reason, Imagawa\nSadayo. I think my fondness for Sadayo, which has seen me get my hands\non everything that&#39;s written about him even only briefly in English, has\na lot to do with Sansom&#39;s write-up on him in this History of Japan\nvolume 2. I&#39;d kill for a translation of his travelling diary.\n \nAngus\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
