Um, yeah. But that&#39;s hardly\na &quot;ninja&quot; tool. \n\nis\n&gt; it also true \n&gt; that they use caltrops to injure or even kill their\n&gt; pursuers?  \n\nWell, according to the ninja museum in Iga-Ueno, yes.\nI&#39;m not sure about &quot;killing&quot; them--I&#39;m assuming you\nmean poisoning the caltrops, because I don&#39;t see how\nelse it could kill anybody. They did use them, quite a\nfew varieties, in fact. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail Address AutoComplete - You start.
