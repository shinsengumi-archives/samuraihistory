I understand samurai would were the crest of the clan he was joined with.  I was also wondering about facial hair.  I have seen some traditional pictures of older or senior men with facial hair and younger men having the clean shave.  This may seem very stupid but was having facial hair a symbol of seniority or age?\n \nThanks,\nRobert\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
