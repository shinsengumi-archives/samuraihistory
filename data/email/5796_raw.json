As most\nshould be aware, Takeda Katsuchiyo will be taking my\nplace as the Daimyo of Tokaido fief and head of the\nhousehold/clan of Hara while I am gone.  I have\nenjoyed being a part of this society a great deal\nthese past few weeks, and I hope to see it thriving\nupon my return.\n\nI should request that my name be taken off the\nemailing list while I am gone, simply because by the\ntime I return, there will have been too many for me to\nread, and probably overflowing my mailbox quota on\nthis Yahoo email account of mine.  If there&#39;s anything\nof significant importance that actually has relation\nto me even after a long period of time, I&#39;d welcome\nit, but general discussion emails should probably be\ncut off from me.\n\nAs I leave to go on musha shugyo, I can think of only\nthese parting words to give you all, nagorioshiku\nsoro.\n\nHara Katsusada\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n\n\n\n"
