But w=\r\ne have to understand the situation of the blade at the\nsurrender moment.\n\n =\r\n\n----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: friopoops [mailto:sgmoore@...] \nInvia=\r\nto: sabato 10 maggio 2003 13.57\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: =\r\nRe: R: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\nLet me shed some light on tw=\r\no questions raised by Carlo:\n\nThe photographs were not taken with a flash. =\r\nI had trouble getting \nclear photos with a flash so I took the sword outsid=\r\ne and took the \nphotos in sunlight.\n\nThe tang with its kanji being well pre=\r\nserved - no one in my family \neven knew that the blade could be removed fro=\r\nm the handle until \nseveral weeks ago. Therefore, the tang never came out o=\r\nf the handle \nfrom 1945 until 2003 and who knows how long before 1945.\n\nSco=\r\ntt\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Carlo Tacchini&quot; \n&lt;TSUBAME1@T...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The shape (ichimonji it seems to me) of the tang match with the\n=\r\n&gt; swordsmith&#39;s work and period? And why so slight curvature in a 17th\n&gt; cen=\r\ntury blade ?\n&gt; It resemble to me no &#39;&#39;black color&#39;&#39; rust in the tang but it=\r\n may be \ndue\n&gt; to the flash light surely used to take the photos. The handl=\r\ne is \nrather\n&gt; long, suggesting a possible ancestral blade, but... also the=\r\n \nsignature\n&gt; seems to me too much well preserved for having 300 years, as =\r\nthe \nsharp\n&gt; angles of the tang and mekugi-ana. Sharpness may be explained =\r\nwith a\n&gt; borders re-shaping (saving the signature) to fit with the kyugunto=\r\n\n&gt; mounting but I am still not able to see filemarks, whether the \nkanji ar=\r\ne\n&gt; rather good visible. Without jihada, boshi and a closer image of at\n&gt; l=\r\neast little part of the hamon is hard to determine the school. If \nthis\n&gt; p=\r\natterns do not match with the signature ?\n&gt; May be a new swordsmith signatu=\r\nre of later time? Because \neffectively, if\n&gt; old, is hard to think of a fak=\r\ne with such a signature, but nowadays \nsome\n&gt; fakers make the same reasonin=\r\ng.\n&gt; Honestly, signature is the last thing I see to, while here we have \nto=\r\n\n&gt; work with it as the first step. And to be sincere, I was not able to\n&gt; r=\r\nead it as good as you have made. I have thinked about the little \nlabel\n&gt; :=\r\n\n&gt; surrenders swords had such a lebel to make it easy to give back\n&gt; (event=\r\nually...) the blade to the formerly owner, and this may \nsuggest\n&gt; the blad=\r\ne was of a certain interest.\n&gt; But this is not a rule in kantei (fakes of s=\r\nurrenders blade with\n&gt; &#39;&#39;dedications&#39;&#39; have a their own market...). If Scot=\r\nt would see at \nthe\n&gt; back of the handle and other details comparing it to =\r\nthe description\n&gt; shown in the part of the article I have posted, may be we=\r\n can argue \nif\n&gt; the mounting was intended for a High officer, enforcing \nt=\r\nhe &#39;&#39;ancestral\n&gt; blade&#39;&#39; theory.\n&gt; By the way, Gen. Yamashita&#39;s sword was o=\r\nf the same period... \n&gt; Please have no trouble to refute my suggestions as =\r\nI&#39;m taking this \nas a\n&gt; learning session, with a lot of fun.   \n&gt; Thanks fo=\r\nr your time.\n&gt; Carlo\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Messaggio originale-----\n&gt; Da: tom helm [mai=\r\nlto:junkmail@t...] \n&gt; Inviato: mercoled=EC 7 maggio 2003 9.06\n&gt; A: samuraih=\r\nistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Oggetto: Re: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Swor=\r\nd\n&gt; \n&gt; Carlo-\n&gt; \tScott has the translation so he can easily straighten us o=\r\nut \n&gt; and the mountings are clearly wartime production. Without further \n&gt; =\r\ninfo though, I stand by my translation. The Nihonto Meikan lists \nfive \n&gt; K=\r\natsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one who signed in this \nmanner. \n&gt; The=\r\n shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sengo Masashige. \n&gt; Masashige w=\r\nas a student of the infamous Muramasa. Banshu Katsuyoshi \n&gt; was originally =\r\nfrom the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and worked around \nthe \n&gt; Tenna era (1681-1=\r\n683).\n&gt; \tOne would expect to see some characteristics of the Sengo \n&gt; schoo=\r\nl in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and monouchi are \n&gt; important. I a=\r\ngree no final determination can be made without sword \n&gt; in hand, but I wou=\r\nld posit that a faker or &#39;tribute&#39; sword would \n&gt; hardly choose to copy the=\r\n work of a late generation smith from a \n&gt; little known line.\n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Samura=\r\ni Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from thi=\r\ns group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
