The artist is well-known, I found much\nabout him on the web.  But the tracks were titled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I could\nfind no liner notes on that particular album other than &quot;traditional\nsongs&quot;.  It is one of my favorite albums, although the songs are not at all\nlike the music one hears in Ugetsu or Kwaidon (Hoichi the Earless), being\nnot near as &quot;dramatic&quot; for lack of a better term. And of course I don&#39;t\nspeak Japanese so I have no idea what he is singing.\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 14, 2010 at 8:59 PM, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Maybe if you focused on the songs/stories traditionally paired with\n&gt; biwa, instead of the instrument itself...\n&gt;\n&gt; Tom Helm\n&gt; toryu@...\n&gt; &quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;\n&gt; - Vergil\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Apr 14, 2010, at 1:46 PM, Dennis Sheridan wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One of my most favorite films.. although I haven&#39;t purchased the new\n&gt; &gt; Criterion yet..
