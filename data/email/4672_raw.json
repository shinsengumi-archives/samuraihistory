Fisher&quot; &lt;annfisher1@...&gt; wrote:\nI have spend a lotta time searching through hundreds of Kamon and cannot find one like the one on the WW2 Katana I bought ftrom an elderly American WW2 soldier&#39;s family this weekend at a garage sale.  May I post a photo of it? It is kinda like the four squares in a circle Kamon but each of the four squares is split and the split line in each square points to the next square.  The line splitting each square is emerging from a tiny square hole in each of the larger squares but it comes out off center to the small square.  Looking at the katana with it held blade down the lines come out pointing to the ssquare on the left.  If anyone has seen this family crest or knows anything about It I would like to know more.  The Ka-mon is on the rear of the Kabuto-gane. \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
