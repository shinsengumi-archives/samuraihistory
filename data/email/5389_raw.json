They basically had thier panel of \npretty boys and girls answer multiple choice questions about ninja.   \nApparently, the &quot;flying ninja&quot; trick with the square shaped cloak \ncould work in theory, but my question is, if so, why did it take 1000 \nyears and the wright brothers to prove it?  Also, they talked about \nhow ninja can jump 2.4 meters straight up, and can long jump two \nparked volvos.  So of course they said &quot;ooh, if we had ninja in the \nolympics this time, we would win every event!&quot; The only useful bit of \ninfo I got from it is that ninja dont wear thier swords over thier \nshoulder because it is too hard to draw - except when they are \ncrawling under a house.  \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Anthony J.

I really feel like I\n&gt; &gt; need to cleanse myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remote reading? Huh? \n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds like you needed to use the remote, to change\n&gt; the channel. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
