I need direction \ntowards sites that focus on the raising of a young male in the samurai \ncaste, probably for a son of a hatamoto, as well as a site defining \nthe structure of the samurai caste.  The other thing that I am trying \nto work out, I&#39;ve seen references to both Shinto and Buddhism being \npracticed by samurai, but nothing clearly stating which was prefered \nand the time periods they were prefered in.\n\nThe only other thing I was looking for, I&#39;ve seen lots of pictures of \ncastle cities, however I am having a hard time finding a blueprint \ntype deal - A layout, etc.\n\nAny help anyone can give I would appreciate it!\n\nApollo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
