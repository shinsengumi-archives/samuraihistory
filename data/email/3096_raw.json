The cable was suspended and \nallowed to hang freely.  This was one of the tests he used to test some of his \nblades.  So maybe it is possible to cut the barrel of a gun with a good downward \nforce swing of a Katana.  This is just something that I read and as of right \nnow I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on Samurai, but I am reading as much as I can \nafford to buy.\n\nBrett\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
