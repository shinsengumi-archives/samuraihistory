I had trouble getting \nclear photos with a flas=\r\nh so I took the sword outside and took the \nphotos in sunlight.\n\nThe tang w=\r\nith its kanji being well preserved - no one in my family \neven knew that th=\r\ne blade could be removed from the handle until \nseveral weeks ago. Therefor=\r\ne, the tang never came out of the handle \nfrom 1945 until 2003 and who know=\r\ns how long before 1945.\n\nScott\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Car=\r\nlo Tacchini&quot; \n&lt;TSUBAME1@T...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The shape (ichimonji it seems to me)=\r\n of the tang match with the\n&gt; swordsmith&#39;s work and period? And why so slig=\r\nht curvature in a 17th\n&gt; century blade ?\n&gt; It resemble to me no &#39;&#39;black col=\r\nor&#39;&#39; rust in the tang but it may be \ndue\n&gt; to the flash light surely used t=\r\no take the photos. The handle is \nrather\n&gt; long, suggesting a possible ance=\r\nstral blade, but... also the \nsignature\n&gt; seems to me too much well preserv=\r\ned for having 300 years, as the \nsharp\n&gt; angles of the tang and mekugi-ana.=\r\n Sharpness may be explained with a\n&gt; borders re-shaping (saving the signatu=\r\nre) to fit with the kyugunto\n&gt; mounting but I am still not able to see file=\r\nmarks, whether the \nkanji are\n&gt; rather good visible. Without jihada, boshi =\r\nand a closer image of at\n&gt; least little part of the hamon is hard to determ=\r\nine the school. If \nthis\n&gt; patterns do not match with the signature ?\n&gt; May=\r\n be a new swordsmith signature of later time? Because \neffectively, if\n&gt; ol=\r\nd, is hard to think of a fake with such a signature, but nowadays \nsome\n&gt; f=\r\nakers make the same reasoning.\n&gt; Honestly, signature is the last thing I se=\r\ne to, while here we have \nto\n&gt; work with it as the first step. And to be si=\r\nncere, I was not able to\n&gt; read it as good as you have made. I have thinked=\r\n about the little \nlabel\n&gt; :\n&gt; surrenders swords had such a lebel to make i=\r\nt easy to give back\n&gt; (eventually...) the blade to the formerly owner, and =\r\nthis may \nsuggest\n&gt; the blade was of a certain interest.\n&gt; But this is not =\r\na rule in kantei (fakes of surrenders blade with\n&gt; &#39;&#39;dedications&#39;&#39; have a t=\r\nheir own market...). If Scott would see at \nthe\n&gt; back of the handle and ot=\r\nher details comparing it to the description\n&gt; shown in the part of the arti=\r\ncle I have posted, may be we can argue \nif\n&gt; the mounting was intended for =\r\na High officer, enforcing \nthe &#39;&#39;ancestral\n&gt; blade&#39;&#39; theory.\n&gt; By the way, =\r\nGen. Yamashita&#39;s sword was of the same period... \n&gt; Please have no trouble =\r\nto refute my suggestions as I&#39;m taking this \nas a\n&gt; learning session, with =\r\na lot of fun.   \n&gt; Thanks for your time.\n&gt; Carlo\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Messaggio origin=\r\nale-----\n&gt; Da: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@t...] \n&gt; Inviato: mercoled=EC 7 ma=\r\nggio 2003 9.06\n&gt; A: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Oggetto: Re: R: [samur=\r\naihistory] History of a Sword\n&gt; \n&gt; Carlo-\n&gt; \tScott has the translation so h=\r\ne can easily straighten us out \n&gt; and the mountings are clearly wartime pro=\r\nduction. Without further \n&gt; info though, I stand by my translation. The Nih=\r\nonto Meikan lists \nfive \n&gt; Katsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one who si=\r\ngned in this \nmanner. \n&gt; The shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sen=\r\ngo Masashige. \n&gt; Masashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa. Banshu K=\r\natsuyoshi \n&gt; was originally from the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and worked arou=\r\nnd \nthe \n&gt; Tenna era (1681-1683).\n&gt; \tOne would expect to see some character=\r\nistics of the Sengo \n&gt; school in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and mo=\r\nnouchi are \n&gt; important. I agree no final determination can be made without=\r\n sword \n&gt; in hand, but I would posit that a faker or &#39;tribute&#39; sword would =\r\n\n&gt; hardly choose to copy the work of a late generation smith from a \n&gt; litt=\r\nle known line.\n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have bee=\r\nn removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; -=\r\n--\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-uns=\r\nubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
