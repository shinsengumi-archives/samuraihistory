However,  on the \nsurface,  it appears that the samurai long sword, or tachi,  seems to be \nunrelated to tai chi, or more properly t&#39;ai chi ch&#39;uan.  T&#39;ai chi is mentioned \nhistorically in the T&#39;ang Dynasty (618---960AD), although is thought to be much older \nin China.  For more on its origins, consult  Angus Clark,  The Complete \nIllustrated Guide to Ta&#39;i Chi (2000). Regarding the tachi,  studying pictorial \nsources, it appears few riders used it in combat.  This is understandable.  Riding \na horse,   keeping control of your mount is most important;  in combat, your \nhorse is your best ally.  Using a sword that seems to have required both hands \nwould have been hazardous indeed--for what would you use to control the \nreins?
