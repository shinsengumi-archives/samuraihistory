If \nany one answered my request for a discussion about Choshu&#39;s role in the \nbakumatsu period, I&#39;m sorry for not replying - maybe you could post it again.\n\nIn the meantime I have another question: does anyone have information or \ncan suggest resources on life in the imperial court in the bakumatsu period. \nI&#39;ve become fascinated by the seven nobles who were spirited away to \nChoshu after the defeat by Satsuma and Aizu in 1863.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nGillian\n\n\n\n"
