About 50% of the sites I look=\r\ned at \n&gt; said it was 1572 and the other half said 1573. Does anyone know wh=\r\ny \n&gt; this is and what year the battle was actually fought?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n...in fact, when we first started the Samurai Archives, we didn&#39;t \ndiscrimi=\r\nnate between the two, so a lot of it is mixed between Japanese \nand western=\r\n dates.  This intro to the biographical dictionary (which \nused mostly cont=\r\nemporary Japanese dates) helps to explain:\n\nDATES \nMost dates are given in =\r\ntheir western equivalents for the sake of \nclarity for western readers. How=\r\never, when dates are listed by their \ncontemporary reckoning, they are give=\r\nn as follows: era name and the \nyear of that era, followed by the month and=\r\n day, thus, Eiroku-3 6/1 \nwould be the 1st day of the 6th month of the 3rd =\r\nyear of Eiroku. Eiroku-\n3 6 would indicate the 6th month of the 3rd year of=\r\n Eiroku. Where a \nmonth alone is indicated, e.g., the 10th month, that, too=\r\n, is to be \nconsidered by the contemporary reckoning (and not, in this case=\r\n, \nOctober by the Gregorian calendar.) There really isn=81ft any simple way=\r\n \nto convert these dates into their Gregorian equivalents, although a \nvery=\r\n rough rule of thumb is to add between 20 and 30 days. For \ninstance, Taked=\r\na Shingen, by contemporary Japanese reckoning, died on \nthe 12th day of the=\r\n 4th month of the 4th year of Genki. By our \nreckoning, he died on 13 May 1=\r\n573. However, note that his rival Oda \nNobunaga was killed on the 2nd day o=\r\nf the 6th month of the 10th year of \nTensho, or, 21 June 1582. That=81fs ma=\r\ny give one a sense for the \ncomplexities of date conversion. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
