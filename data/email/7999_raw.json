They posted the se=\r\nvered heads of criminals in public and \nguarded them. They were responsible=\r\n for the carcasses of cows. Some \nmade leather and some sold flowers. These=\r\n were the Burakumin, the \noutcasts of Japan. \n\nDescendants of Burakumin, Ja=\r\npanese people distinguished by caste, \nnot ethnicity, continue to face unof=\r\nficial discrimination in Japan.\n\nDaniel Botsman, a professor of history at =\r\nHarvard University, told \nthe ironic story of the &quot;emancipatory moment&quot; of =\r\nthe outcasts in \nMeiji Japan (1868-1912) at a colloquium sponsored by the U=\r\nCLA Center \nfor Japanese Studies on Oct. 31. The Burakumin were granted com=\r\nmoner \nstatus in the Emancipation Edict of 1871, the culmination of a \ncamp=\r\naign spearheaded by =D4e Taku, a prominent citizen. It was =D4e who \nformal=\r\nly proposed that the outcast status of the Burakumin be \nabolished. \n\nHowev=\r\ner, this story of liberation has no fairy-tale ending, and the \nemancipator=\r\n&#39;s motives were perhaps not as altruistic as he made out, \naccording to Bot=\r\nsman.\n\n=D4e, born to a lower-class samurai family, devoted himself to the \n=\r\ncause of the emperor and the restoration movement of the 1860s. He \nwas act=\r\nive in politics and business, including a stint as a railway \nmagnate in co=\r\nlonial Korea. He eventually was appointed as a judge in \nthe Kobe area cour=\r\nt, a &quot;treaty port&quot; where foreigners were beginning \nto set up consulates an=\r\nd trade. \n\nIn a 1919 speech, =D4e said that his interest in the outcasts&#39; c=\r\nause \nhad been sparked during a stroll when he stumbled on Furonodani, a \nv=\r\nillage under the general authority of the Kobe area. =D4e said he had \nbeen=\r\n touched by the poverty of the people and noticed they were \nmostly flower =\r\nsellers, a &quot;beautiful door-to-door trade&quot; that they \nalone were allowed to =\r\npursue. He found out, he said, that their \nmonopoly on the trade stemmed fr=\r\nom loyalty to the great fourteenth-\ncentury imperial general Kusunoki Masas=\r\nhige. \n\nAccording to legend, in the early Tokugawa period (seventeenth \ncen=\r\ntury), a great daimyo lord, Mitsukuni of Mito, happened across \nthe grave o=\r\nf Kusunoki, who had died trying to reassert the power of \nthe Imperial thro=\r\nne. The general&#39;s grave was nondescript and sat in \na lonely paddy field. Y=\r\net each morning without fail, Mitsukuni \nnoticed, fresh incense burned and =\r\nfresh flowers had been laid there. \nHe wondered who could be responsible. S=\r\noon he found that the people \nof Furonodani were the ones loyally tending t=\r\no this grave centuries \nafter the great general&#39;s death. In recognition of =\r\ntheir loyal \nservice, Mitsukuni granted them the exclusive privilege of sel=\r\nling \nflowers in the region.\n\n&#39;Leather Was King&#39;\nAlthough his later account=\r\n made it seem that the villagers who \ntouched =D4e were all flower-sellers,=\r\n they were in fact mostly makers \nof leather. Botsman showed this with evid=\r\nence from population \nregisters. The Burakumin had the dirty job of skinnin=\r\ng and tanning \nthe carcasses of cows that they were responsible for collect=\r\ning.\n\nWas =D4e simply mistaken? Although there were many Burakumin flower-\n=\r\nsellers, about six times as many of them were leather workers. It \nseems th=\r\nat =D4e focused on one aspect of their livelihood in order to \nwin them sym=\r\npathy, Botsman said. A story involving &quot;beautiful \nflowers, Mito Mitsukuni,=\r\n and then, to top it all off, the greatest \nmilitary hero of the imperial p=\r\nast, Kusunoki Masashige, seems just a \nlittle bit too good to be true.&quot; \n\nB=\r\notsman also pointed out that =D4e grew up near a village of these \neta, or =\r\noutcasts, and had hired them to clear some of his land. \nClearly, he had be=\r\nen exposed to these people before. Where he worked \nin the Kobe region, the=\r\n Burakumin were practically on his office&#39;s \ndoorstep, according to Botsman=\r\n.\n\nFuronodani was located very close to the burgeoning port area of \nKobe, =\r\nwhere westerners were officially allowed to set up shop. While \ndemand for =\r\nbeef was growing, leather had always been used to make \nsandals that were p=\r\nopular in Japan. Even more important in the Meiji \nera were leather boots, =\r\nstraps, and belts for the westernizing \narmy. &quot;Leather was king,&quot; Botsman s=\r\naid.\n\nSlaughtering cows and manufacturing leather was a dirty job that \nonl=\r\ny the outcasts could do, but there were not enough of them. The \nindustry n=\r\needed more hands, as =D4e was well aware. He worked in the \nlocal courthous=\r\ne and had significant responsibility over the \nnew &quot;treaty port.&quot;\n\nBotsman =\r\nconcluded that =D4e invented much of his flowery appeal for \nreform in orde=\r\nr to bolster the industry. By raising people who had \ntheir hands in the le=\r\nather and slaughtering business to the status \nof others, he hoped to remov=\r\ne its stigma. As long as people shunned \nthe industry, labor and investment=\r\n would be difficult to attract.\n\nIn his 1919 speech =D4e vouched for the Bu=\r\nrakumin to a council charged \nwith doing something about the &quot;Burakumin pro=\r\nblem.&quot; Though formally \nemancipated 50 years prior, the Burakumin were stil=\r\nl a disadvantaged \nsocial group, potentially ripe for revolution against th=\r\neir imperial \ngovernment. Japanese officials may have worried about this af=\r\nter \nwitnessing a socialist revolution in Russia. Botsman said =D4e \nintend=\r\ned to help them again in order to prevent such an uprising.\n\nAccording to B=\r\notsman, then, development of the leather industry and \nsubversion of revolu=\r\ntion were, in turn, motives behind =D4e&#39;s \nchampioning of the Burakumin&#39;s c=\r\nause.\n\n\n\n\nDate Posted: 11/9/2005\n\nhttp://www.international.ucla.edu/print.a=\r\nsp?parentid=3D33148\n\n\n\n\n"
