Being as it\nwas in Owari, it would be hard for them to have\ncontrolled it. Inuyama belonged to quite a few people,\nbut for most of the later Sengoku it was controlled by\nretainers of the Oda. I believe after Nobunaga&#39;s death\nit was the home of Oda Nobuo for a while. Later in the\nTokugawa period it was given to the Naruse family, and\nis still owned by them to this day--it&#39;s the only\ncastle in Japan still owned by a private family. \n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n"
