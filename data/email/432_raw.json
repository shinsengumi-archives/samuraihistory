I have always thought of\nKusonoki Masashige as a good example of the early\nloyalty of the samurai before the Sengoku jidai.  As\nfor Daimyo I feel either Toyotomi Hideyoshi or Date\nmasamune would both be good choices.  Some have said,\nhad he been born earlier Date masamune would have\nruled Japan.\n\nJust opinion.\n\nMusashi\n--- Matthew Dean &lt;uchi_deshi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi to everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; Here it is the big question!!\n&gt; So then just to get you all thinking,\n&gt; Who was the greatest Samurai or Daimyo of all time?\n&gt; and if that&#39;s not enough to get you thinking, then\n&gt; Who would you most like to of been given the chance,\n&gt; and why?\n&gt; \n&gt; This is just a few questions to get people thinking,\n&gt; I was asked them and I really was puzzled and for a\n&gt; while I\n&gt; thought I had the answer.
