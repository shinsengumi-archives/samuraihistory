She heard the story years ago and is now trying to trace it again, and get more facts. \nThe event is purported to have taken place in the 1860s or 70s, and concerns the murder, on a beach hidden by wooded cliffs, of two or three &quot;shishi&quot; during the Satsuma rebellion or related events, by 5 Americans. \nThats all my friend can remeber of the story, if it rings any bells please let us know - we would be fascinated.\n \nLaura\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
