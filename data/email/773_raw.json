I&#39;m doing a \nresearch paper on samurai and seppuku, and I have a question for you all that \nI&#39;m hoping someone can answer as soon as possible.  The paper is due tomorrow \nand I just realized that I don&#39;t have an example for how samurais sometimes \nused seppuku to save others.  If I&#39;m completely off and they never did then I \ncan just take it out, but it would help if I had some kind of example so I \ncould leave it in.  Please, if anyone has any examples that they could give \nme could you e-mail/IM me?  My e-mail is kawaiilizard@... and my AOL/AIM \nname is KawaiiLizard.  Thank you so much for your help in advance!  Also, if \nyou don&#39;t know of a specific example but you know an easy way to find one on \na website, I&#39;ll take that, too!
