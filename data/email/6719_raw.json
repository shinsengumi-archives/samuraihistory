Nobunaga was a fearsome man, but he lacked Hideyoshi&#39;s\n&gt; governing ability, which in my opinion makes Hideyoshi the greater \nof\n&gt; the three. If Nobunaga had not been murdered, I don&#39;t think the\n&gt; unification would have gone nearly as smoothly. Nobunaga rubbed \npeople\n&gt; the wrong way, and out of fear I think you would have seen the \npowerful\n&gt; clans rise against him in an effort to protect their autonomy, as\n&gt; Nobunaga showed that he expected all the land to be directly under \nthe\n&gt; control of himself and his close retainers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hideyoshi on the other hand knew that the way to govern in the 16th\n&gt; century was not to destroy everybody in your way, but to reward and\n&gt; garauntee the lands of the powerful daimyo. Sure, the memory of\n&gt; Nobunaga&#39;s ruthless actions earlier in the 16th century probably \ngave\n&gt; the daimyo a reason to want peace, but still...\n&gt; \n&gt; The marks against Hideyoshi were the two attempted invasions of \nKorea\n&gt; and the fact that he did not have a realistic succession plan, \nthanks to\n&gt; the forced suicide of his previous heir, who from the sounds of \nthings,\n&gt; may have deserved it... It&#39;s hard to forgive the Korean invasion, \nbut if\n&gt; he had lived for awhile longer we may not have seen a Sekigahara, \nand\n&gt; perhaps a Toyotomi Bakufu?\n&gt; \n&gt; Angus\n\nThere&#39;s been mention of the fact that without Nobunaga, the \nunification would not have gained the momentum that it had but there \nwere certainly other daimyo who had the power base to achieve it. \nIeyasu had two options - the Oda to his west and the Takeda to his \neast, and had previously come to an understanding with Shingen. If \nNobunaga hadn&#39;t happened, he may well have sided with the Takeda, \nand what odds on a Shingen/Ieyasu alliance unifying Japan? Of \ncourse, the same scenario may have played out after Shingen&#39;s death \nwith Katsuyori in place of Hideyori.\n\nHideyoshi&#39;s failing seems to have been that of a cult of \npersonality - a great deal of the loyalty that he acquired was to \nhimself personally rather than to his family, which unravelled with \nsurprising quickness after his death (helped in no small way by \nMitsunari&#39;s incompetance).\n\nThere&#39;s one outsider I sometimes speculate on - the Shimazu. They \nachieved the conquest of Kyushu, but didn&#39;t have enough time to \nconsolidate their victories. They were well served by loyal \nretainers, and in Yoshihisa, Yoshihiro and Iehisa had some of the \nfinest generals of the time. The previous shogunate had been built \non a Kyushu power base, so if the Shimazu had been able to \nconsolidate their gains, could they have been the ones to unify \nJapan?\n\n\n\n\n"
