My question has to do with modern studies of the Samurai \ntechniques of swordmanship.  I have seen a few books about it, and even heard that Tom \nCruise studied with a group out of New York City.  I would like to know where \nI could possibly learn the techniques learned by the Samurai.  I have not \nseen any Kendo teachers in my area.\n\nThanks,\n\nBrett\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
