The fact that the Japanese \n&gt; actors felt no compulsion to say anything to the director just \nshows \n&gt; they have no business doing anything but curry commercials.\n&gt; \tI can&#39;t wait to see it either, been waiting a long time for \n&gt; something this to come down the road. The tragedy is that the TRUE \n&gt; story of Tabaruzaka and the restoration battles would make much \n&gt; better cinema. In the end they always feel they have to dumb it \ndown \n&gt; to make it entertaining, assuming the world of moviegoers is on \npar \n&gt; with television-viewers...\n&gt; \tThis reeks of Bakufu-style movie making and as you all know. \n&gt; &quot;Ore wa Tobaku, tobaku, mata tobaku!!!&quot;\n&gt; -t\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
