I beleive that it is a recent release.  \nIs TABOU   think I am speeling it correct.   Has anyone seen this moive and \nwhat are your thoughts on it.  \n\nAlso;  going out on a limb;  I got very interesting in the Laura Joh Rowland \nNovels.  If anyone has read them and although the most of the cahractors tomy \nknowlege are fictious.   How accurate is she in showing the customes and \nprtocal of the courts for this time frame.  \n\nAnother Two book Serious  by Takashi Matsuoka   Cloud of Sparrows & Autumn \nBridge\n\n   I read both of these novels.  Most of the people that I have turned on to \nthis these books told me that they could nto stop reading.  Would like to know \nif anyone has red them and thier thoughts.  Mostly portaining to the time \nperiod in which it is in.   \n\nQustion I am hoping that I am not sending the rpior post with my reply.  I \nhave tried deleteing the ost before but AOL only lets you select copy when doing \nthis.   \n\nIn the Laura Joh Rowland novels she show some aspect of intimacy between \nSamuria;  I late see this in the above mention movie.   \n\n   Was this a practice?  And I beleive that it was said  &quot;That they were \nsharing some condisered this sahring Bushido..  But I am not at all sure that this \nwould be histroically correct.   Is there documatation that shows this to be \ntrue.  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
