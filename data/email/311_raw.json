While the\nfight scenes in this movie are good there are not alot\nof them.  The story was very good and I was not\ndisapointed but just thought I would give the heads up\nto those interested\n\nMusashi\n\n--- fifthchamber@... wrote:\n&gt; I also think that Gohatto is definately one of the\n&gt; best Japanese Samurai \n&gt; films that I have ever seen and cannot recommend it\n&gt; enough. The scenery and \n&gt; the acting are incredibly beautiful, from Kitano&#39;s\n&gt; roughened old Bushi \n&gt; through to the final Sakura (cherry blossom) and the\n&gt; way that it is lit for \n&gt; the final scenes...\n&gt;  The question that I have is wether anyone out there\n&gt; has heard of any release \n&gt; dates for the film on (region 2-PAL, UK playable)\n&gt; DVD yet? I am aware that it \n&gt; has been offered already on Amazon etc. but have not\n&gt; heard anything about \n&gt; it&#39;s UK release dates....Till then.\n&gt;  Abayo....Ben Sharples.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!
