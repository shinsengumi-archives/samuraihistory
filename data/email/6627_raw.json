I&#39;m totally \nimpressed with your research and activities. It&#39;s people like you \nthat give historical studies a good name. You&#39;re truly diverse, \nadverse, intellegent, and articulate. I&#39;m utterly impressed. If I \nwere Japanese, I&#39;d be proud of what you are doing. I&#39;m learning so \nmuch so far. I can understand why it&#39;s a rule here to be serious and \nmature. You the samurai really seriously. Forgive me for not showing \nenough respect to you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
