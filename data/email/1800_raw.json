Others such as the Kukishin ryu no longer\nstudy the Kishajutsu, but maintain study in the other\nmartial arts\n\nPaul\n\n\n--- Atisi Kazuari &lt;broccolihead30@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nWell, the Samurai class, or bushi, didn&#39;t come onto\nthe historical \nstage untill 750 after the Gempei War. \nIn the early days samurai could be of any class, much\nlike the roman \nlegions, but it wasn&#39;t until 1200&#39;s(could have been as\nearly as the \n1100&#39;s) when the class system became more ridged. And\nfrom then until \n1868 with the Meiji Restoration(some records show the\nrestoration and \nthe various rebellions post and prior that the end of\nthe bushi came \nin 1867-9) the Samurai where the ruling class. though\nof course the \ncourt nobles and Emporer still had power they had been\nreduced to \nfigureheads.\n\nTo answer your question, and i am sorry for the long\nexplination \nprior, people where trained as Samurai(as a prior post\nhas said) by \nbeing born into a Samurai family. Both sexes where\ntrained though \ndiffrently. Men where trained in horsemenship, kyudo(\nlong bow) and \nkenjitsu(sword) amoung other unarmed techniques such\nas Aikido, \njujitsu, ect. Woman on the other hand where taught\nNiganata(long \nspear with curved blade) the use of tanto, and other\nsmall knives and \nalso horsemenship(the japanese name escapes me at the\nmoment) and \nboth where taught Yarijitsu(spear).\n\nI hope that helps. Another point to make is that\nunlike medival \nknights, who where given power to an extent i.e. a\nlord would pay for \nthier training and armor ect, while still not giving\nhim power in and \nof himself. the Bushi in effect, after the gempei war\nhalf took it \nand half where given it, as the nobles felt that they\nshould still \nrun the country from kyoto but as the latter periods\nof unrest proved\nthe Bushi really controlled the goings on of the\ncountry(while still \npaying yearly homage to the Emporer).\n\nAtsi Kazuri \n&gt; \n&gt; Why were some people trained as samurais, and not\nall?  As in with \n&gt; knights, they are usally part of a nobel family and\nso on.  Oh were \n&gt; everybody trained as samurai?\n\n\n\nYahoo!
