The\n&quot;Vikings&quot; from Scandinavia often used a large battle axe in their left\nhand so as to catch their opponents on their unshielded side. At the\nsame time they could carry a smaller lighter weapon with which to defend\nthemselves whilst they were getting ready for another blow with their\naxe. Does anyone know if the samurai ever carried two weapons at once\nlike this, especially an axe and a tanto? I think an axe and a katana or\nnodachi would be too much to handle.\n\nSheldon\n\n\n\n\n"
