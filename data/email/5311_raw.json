Regarding the previous discussion about\n&gt; Seppuku, I have another question. As we understand\n&gt; Seppuku, it was a dignified act of inflicting death,\n&gt; a privilege. does this mean that criminals and\n&gt; renegade ronin were depraved of this kind of\n&gt; reconciliatory option, and were, for example,\n&gt; hanged?\n\nI assume you mean if they were caught? Generally,\ncriminals who were caught were crucified. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
