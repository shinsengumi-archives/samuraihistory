Even\nKurosawa doesn&#39;t try to do everything\n&quot;accurately&quot;--his depiction of Nagashino in\n&quot;Kagemusha&quot; is nowhere near accurate. It&#39;s all for\ndramatic effect, though, which suits his purpose. Is\nthat morally wrong? No. However, we should recognize\nfiction for fiction, and not place too much faith in\nits historical accuracy. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
