I&#39;ve also felt kind of small and\n&gt; stupid after seeing the answers for the couple of my\n&gt; comments that decided to read only instead of being\n&gt; involved in writing. \n\n1. Any tone is read, not written. See example below:\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Rob &lt;capt_bochan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; However I beg you please tell me how ika may be\n&gt; &gt; written in kanji. \n&gt; \n&gt; �G��\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://dic.yahoo.co.jp/bin/dsearch?index=00187900&p=%A5%A4%A5%AB&dname=2na&dtype=1&stype=1&pagenum=1\n\nQuestion asked (now, you want to read tone into\nsomething, you can read spades into that. &quot;I beg you\nto tell me...&quot; seems rather condescending and superior\nto me, but I&#39;ll give him the benefit of the doubt.).\n\nAnswer provided. No commentary, no snarkiness,\nnothing. WHERE is the &quot;tone&quot;?\n\nKitsuno&#39;s email says everything--we&#39;re not here to\ncoddle egos and provide affirmation. When someone\nprovides evidence to contradict you, then take it like\nan adult.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
