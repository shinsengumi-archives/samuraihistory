Help me find the right thing to do here.\n\n   I believe they already have.\n\n   As a publisher, I concur with Tony and Nate&#39;s comments. I trust my \neditors, as a rule, and if they were my editors then their opinions would \nshape whether or not my company accepted a manuscript for publication.\n\n   FWIW, I have written or co-authored 12 published books and I have \ncontributed (as an editor, graphic designer and/or developer) to 48 \nadditional published works. I do have some experience in this realm as well.\n\n   One of the hardest things about being an artist (including authors) is \nrejection. The only thing that I find harder to deal with (other than \ncrappy sales &lt;G&gt;) is critique. When I create something I put a lot of pride \nin it, and I love my &quot;baby.&quot; So when people come along and tear it to \nshreds it&#39;s easy to take personally. But as one must make an effort to step \nback and remove the emotional filters, and re-evaluate the criticism.\n\n   Editors&#39; words can feel scathing, but ultimately they are uttered with \nthe intent of providing an unbiased evaluation -- and from an objective \nobserver at that! Such critiques are priceless.\n\n   Someone once told me that if I&#39;m writing for me, then it doesn&#39;t matter \nhow it reads, if it&#39;s accurate, etc. As long as I like it that&#39;s all that \ncounts. But if I&#39;m writing for someone else -- especially someone whom I \nexpect to PAY for the privilege -- then the standards go up dramatically \nand I better be prepared to make a lot of changes if necessary.\n\n   One question that comes to mind (putting on my publisher hat for a \nmoment) is: Who is your target audience? That is, who do you hope will buy \nyour book?\n\n\n    Mark Arsenault\n    Sengoku List Taisho\n    ----------------------------------------------\n    http://www.sengoku.com - The official site of the Sengoku RPG! \n\n\n\n\n"
