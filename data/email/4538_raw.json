A few things had changed in the meantime, just \ncheck out two maps of=\r\n Europe from 1924 and 1941, for example... Do you \nthink hitler was the sam=\r\ne person with the same agenda?? And do you \nthink he had the same amount of=\r\n power and the same number of neurons??\n\n&gt; Hitler mentioned in his mein kam=\r\nph that no matter the race, an certain\n&gt; people can be &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; dep=\r\npending on their cultural \n&gt; background. He\n&gt; also said &quot;the first step to =\r\ndestroy a nation, is to destroy its \n&gt; culture&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; He fought non christia=\r\nns\n\nLike... he was Christian?\nPerhaps vegetarian, but Christian I don&#39;t thi=\r\nnk so...\nAhem: &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; ???\n\n&gt; in general at Germany, Jews, ho=\r\nmosexuals, people\n&gt; who was freethinkers and didn=B4t supported the Nazi Re=\r\ngime (they was \n&gt; sent to\n&gt; concentration camps despite if they was &quot;pure r=\r\nace&quot;-dogs with pedigree \n&gt; or\n&gt; not). So, more than racial, it was even mor=\r\ne about an ideological\n&gt; absolutism.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this way, he was very alike Nob=\r\nunaga, Oda.\n\nOk, but two very different kind of absolutisms, pointing diffe=\r\nrent \ngoals, in different centuries, in different centuries, blah... blah..=\r\n. \nblah... you can&#39;t say two individuals are the same just because they&#39;re =\r\n\nboth absolutists.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hitler killed jews not due to racist motivations\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; only, but also religious,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Question 1: I do not understand what you =\r\nmeant by\n&gt;&gt; &#39;religious&#39;.\n&gt; Octavio: Means: NO CHRISTIAN! Although the prece=\r\ndent catholic \n&gt; concentration\n&gt; camps at Yugoslavia killed not only jews, =\r\nnon christians, homosexuals \n&gt; and\n&gt; people who though differently of the i=\r\nnterests of the Rebel Catholic\n&gt; Ustashi, they also killed protestants, lut=\r\nherans, catholic orthodox as \n&gt; well,\n&gt; Germany under Adolph Hitler, killed=\r\n just no christians. Other \n&gt; denominations\n&gt; of christianity was more safe=\r\nr than it was in Yugoslavia. Religion is \n&gt; also a\n&gt; set of morals and idea=\r\ns, not only simple an belief system. If he was an\n&gt; absolutist, he fough al=\r\nso, what he considered inconvenient religions \n&gt; for his\n&gt; purposes.\n\nOnce =\r\nagain, I really believe he killed most people for economic reasons \nand bec=\r\nause he was a madman. Nobunaga was no madman. He was a ruthless \nwarrior, w=\r\nho killed a lot of people, but with a clearly defined goal in \nhis mind, a =\r\ngoal that MANY in Japan today still consider the greater \ngood: unification=\r\n of the country, before Japan was unified as a colony \nunder China or a Wes=\r\ntern power...\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; And... Although this is offtopic, Cesar, you may\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\ncriticise my History View\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Points as much as ye want, but was not any\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; non-christian religion who always\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was conspiring to change history lo=\r\ngs, doing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; adulteration and falsification\n&gt;&gt;&gt; on the documents, such as =\r\nwhat whas done with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; certain doccuments by Taccitus\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and others to &quot;p=\r\nrove&quot; that Jesus existed. As well,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to accuse several others\n&gt;&gt;&gt; religio=\r\nns (including judaism) of &quot;human sacrifice&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and all the same rant as\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; aways.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The japanese remember very well their history.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks =\r\nto Tokugawa again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Question 2: Do you mean that the Japanese remember=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; well that Nobunaga =3D Hitler? Is this how many Japanese\n&gt;&gt; historians =\r\ninterpret the historical postion of\n&gt;&gt; Nobunaga and teach young Japanese st=\r\nudents in their\n&gt;&gt; history classes?\n&gt; Octavio: I mean exactly what I mean. =\r\nYou added meaning to my stated \n&gt; phrases.\n&gt; Japanese people does not taunt=\r\n, at least at the time I learn japanese\n&gt; history, things like &quot;loosers was=\r\n the evil&quot; and &quot;winners was the \n&gt; good&quot;, but\n&gt; just telling the facts. The=\r\ny also din=B4t put in their history books that\n&gt; Shinto do human sacrifices=\r\n, and buddhists do the same as well.\n\nYour sources for this, please?\n\n&gt; But=\r\n if\n&gt; christianity would take over Japan as it happened with my country, an=\r\nd\n&gt; several scandinavian ones, Shinto and Buddhism would be despicted in \n&gt;=\r\n history\n&gt; books as &quot;absolute EVIL&quot;. That was my point.\n\nSo, your theory is=\r\n: both Hitler and Nobunaga killed non-christisns, so \nthey&#39;re the same?\n\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; And although I am not a communist...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;the people who don=B4t know the=\r\nir true history\n&gt;&gt;&gt; deeply, are fated to repeat it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in circles&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mao =\r\nTse Tung\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Question 3: How is this quotation of Mao related to\n&gt;&gt; your =\r\nargument?\n&gt; Octavio: Think better, and you will realize what I mean.\n\nMore =\r\nthan that I&#39;d need some Asahi Dry, I believe...\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Don=B4t go around =\r\nspreading\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that I am telling lies.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Stand up and PROVE I am wrong.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; The History of the Church\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is full of conspirations of ambition and po=\r\nwer&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Goetche\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Question 4: How does this quotation PROVE that you d=\r\nid\n&gt;&gt; not lie when you said that the Japanese parents quote\n&gt;&gt; Nobunaga to =\r\nscare their children?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Octavio: I saw it with my own eyes when at Japan=\r\n 14 years ago, and also\n&gt; mentioned in some mangas as well at that time.\n\nS=\r\norry, but the stories and you&#39;ve heard and the manga you&#39;ve read do \nnot ma=\r\nke very impressive historical sources. My wife is Japanese, and \nshe does n=\r\not tell Nobunaga stories to our kid (actually she likes him a \nlot-so event=\r\nually would be positive stories.) So, we&#39;re 1-1, at least.\n\n&gt; Can you prove=\r\n the contrary? I\n&gt; don=B4t care if you do not believe me, or even if you be=\r\nlieve as well. I \n&gt; am\n&gt; not a preacher. My life=B4s meaning will not end i=\r\nf you don=B4t believe me.\n\nI do believe you&#39;re sincere, but we&#39;re talking h=\r\nistory here, non \nopinions based (it seems) upon fragmentary sources.\n\n&gt; Th=\r\nose who want know the truth, not only about what I stated, but about \n&gt; eve=\r\nry\n&gt; subject, must just not simply believe in what me or other people \n&gt; af=\r\nfirmed,\n&gt; or skeptically disbelieve, but do their own research in all the \n=\r\n&gt; sources they\n&gt; can access. Including public libraries and internet.\n\nWell=\r\n, I am a graduate student in Japanese history, and I teach World \nHistory. =\r\nThe professor I study with is one of the best in the world in \ntraditional =\r\nJapan history.\nI believe by now I know a bit about how to manage sources.\n\n=\r\n&gt; For an example... Who cares if you didn=B4t believe in what I stated \n&gt; a=\r\nbout\n&gt; Buddhism history in Japan and their co-relaction with Samurai?\n\nWhat=\r\n, where, when?? The sacrifices...?? I am lost again...\n\n&gt; The sources,\n&gt; li=\r\nke Kalama Sutta, shingon-tendai references are available even in \n&gt; english=\r\n\n&gt; nowaddays. And if one want study the tripitaka, one can become a monk, \n=\r\n&gt; learn\n&gt; Pali and spend a life reading it.\n\nPali is an old Indian language=\r\n, the vulgar version of Sanskrit. What \nhas this to do with what we were ta=\r\nlking about???!?!?!??!??!?! Do I \nneed more Asahi Dry????\n\n&gt; In fact, is wh=\r\nat even Buddha recomended to\n&gt; do in Kalama Sutra. Don=B4t believe me, go a=\r\nnd read it. he he he\n\nWow. I&#39;d wish you can stick to the point, and make th=\r\nings clearer.\nDo you have a greater theory?\nI am still not clear on Nobunag=\r\na & Hitler, let alone the sacrifices....\ncepo\n\n\n"
