By that time in history the uchi-katana was the most \ncommon side-arm worn edge up thru the belt, often with a shorter \nblade making a pair.\n\tFor &quot;officers&quot;, iron fittings leather covered scabbard, silk \nor leather wrapped handle nothing fancy. For generals one would \nexpect to see brightly colored ito-maki tachi, perhaps with lacquered \nmon. At this time there were many high-ranking individuals who were \nvery serious about war, and may have dressed gaudily, wore \neye-catching helmets but their swords were all business.\n\tRemember the Japannese put great store in the power of their \nancestors so a man in the 1500&#39;s might very well be wearing his great \ngrandfathers tachi, cut down and carried in a new scabbard...\n-t\n&gt;hello, tom\n&gt;thanks for the info on the swords.\n&gt;i am an armoursmith, i have been making armour for 4 years now made\n&gt;only one samurai harness, now i want one for myself.\n&gt;i have noticed that many harnesses have the wrong sword with them.\n&gt;i have seen a pic on one harness that was dated to 1200s, but the\n&gt;style of sword was that of late 1800s. i am looking to do a harness\n&gt;from the 1500s. so i was told the taichi style was the one i wanted.\n&gt;any more info on the sword? the one i have appears to have 2 possably\n&gt;3 mons on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
