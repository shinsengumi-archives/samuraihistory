Who wouldn&#39;t? I&#39;d even bring the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brandy and cigars!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tony, I think you&#39;d also want to talk with\n&gt; Jiro\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ashigaru gunner! I&#39;d just want to hang out and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the master speak, hoping I could catch\n&gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;bungo&quot;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL! Frankly, yes. The tacticians and\n&gt; strategists I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; definitely want to talk\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to. But how could you *not* talk to the guys in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trenches?  The greatest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tactician is nothing if the only army he\n&gt; commands is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a chessboard, and his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soldiers can&#39;t or won&#39;t fight.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is giving me much needed relief from\n&gt; diagraming\n&gt; &gt; Krasnovian Mech Inf BN&#39;s defending in sector...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yeah, I find I learn more from &quot;Joe&quot; than from\n&gt; anybody\n&gt; &gt; who outranks me. &quot;Joe&quot; has as much to give to a\n&gt; &gt; leader/commander as the leader/commander has to\n&gt; give\n&gt; &gt; to him, and if the commander gives of himself,\n&gt; &quot;Joe&quot;\n&gt; &gt; will do anything for him. You could have the best\n&gt; &gt; PLAN, but if you don&#39;t have the tools to\n&gt; execute...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think of it this way: The generals write the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; titles and chapter headings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while the soldiers actually fill in the\n&gt; individual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paragraphs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or for you football fans, the general diagrams the\n&gt; &gt; plays, the &quot;Joes&quot; run the ball.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The trouble is, *most* people don&#39;t want to read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stories about the little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guy; they want sweeping tales of battle where\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;little guy&quot; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regiment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s too bad, because a. some of the most\n&gt; &gt; interesting stories of war are at the battalion\n&gt; level\n&gt; &gt; and below...usually down in the companies and\n&gt; squads.\n&gt; &gt; b. Small unit actions are what wins wars...you\n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; win house to house, you never take the key\n&gt; objectives\n&gt; &gt; that accomplish the general&#39;s operational goals. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
