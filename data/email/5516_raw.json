See:\nhttp://www.monkeypeaches.com/\n\nI saw it uncut, but I was not that impressed either, but since it was a \nChinese version without subtitles, I was pretty lost. &quot;Legend of Zu \nMountain&quot; was similar, great special effects, famous actors, poor plot. \nSounds like a Lucas film.\n\n&gt;&quot;The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi&quot; \n&gt;serves as a fine antidote. \n&gt;\nDr. Jim recommends taking it even if you don&#39;t see Hero.\n\n&gt; From: &quot;Carlo Tacchini&quot; &lt;TSUBAME1@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I highly recommend this movie. The final Matsuri-style ballet is a gem\n&gt;in itself. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe tap dancing was just wonderfully silly. Of course if you get too \nhappy after seeing this, you can see the &quot;Twilight Samurai&quot;.\n\nJim\n\n\n"
