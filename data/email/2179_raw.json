He integrated fires\n&gt;and obstacles as well as any modern commander would. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nRead  &quot;The Dawn of  Modern Warfare&quot;, it&#39;s part of the West Point \nMilitary History series. Sorry he wasn&#39;t the first use a combination of \nterrain and guns. Read about Gonzola and his conduct of the battle of \nCerignola in 1503. These tactics were used by the Spanish and gave rise \nto their ascendency in Europe. I suspect if there was a real innovation, \nit was in his formations and their speed and possibly training. The \nSpanish Tercio was a slow clunky thing to manuveur and fight. Any of the \nthree, Oda et. al would have been a top general anywhere in period I think.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; &lt;the_sam_99@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In the commentaries to the 7 Samurai DVD it is \n&gt;said that 2 minutes were needed, but I would like to confirm that, if \n&gt;possible.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat fits with the figures I&#39;ve read and my friends with period firearms \ncan&#39;t really load much faster than that and they have the concept of \ndrill down cold. Not something usual for the 1600&#39;s soldier.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Masamori Masami&quot; &lt;oni_shogun@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: The Last Samurai? Good? Bad?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Ive seen a few Kurosawa films, and they seem very accurate. I \n&gt;recommend any Kurosawa film.\n&gt;\nExcept maybe Dreams and DoDesuKaden....\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"
