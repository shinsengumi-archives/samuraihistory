And there were\na lot of messages saved from before and during the war I was hoping to get to, but... well, read on.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, we had a double whammy Chez Effingham.\n\nThe phone went out, and they fixed the line today (someone, it seems, cut the outside line). On Tuesday evening, the\nBIG whammy hit. Disk Crash.\n\nThe only thing that worked was recovering the Hard Drive. That returned the computer to its status as of December,\n2000. Three years of work was gone in a flash.\n\nAll the files are gone. All the work. All my armour material. All the garb designs. All the costume reference and\npatterns. All my webpages. All my font work. All my manuscripts and translations. All the music. All the graphics.\nExcept for a single CD of selected archived files to transfer to the laptop (made a year ago!) It is only by the\ngrace of God that I have a CD of my thesis, as someone recently asked me for a copy and I burned off a CD for him and\nhaven&#39;t yet mailed it... but everything else -- my translation of Hojoki, my in-progress translations of Japanese\nliterature and two chapters of the new armour book, all my correspondence, all my bookmarks, all my addresses... all\ngone.\n\nSo, friends, there is a moral here. For the love of God, backup your files. Early, and often.\n\nAnd, if you&#39;ve sent me anything that I haven&#39;t replied to, send again. I&#39;ll try to get a reply out as soon as I can.\nFor now, I&#39;m using the laptop (which has always been the backup and has only a few surviving files on it), as the\ndesktop is still acting unstable and is going in for a brain dusting ASAP.\n\nIn the meantime, I&#39;m going to try to catch up to the last few days of e-mail.\n\nSuicidally Yours,\nAnthony J. Bryant\n\n\n"
