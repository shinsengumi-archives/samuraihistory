It has \nbeen dubed the Keeper of Karate&#39;s Highest tradition, that tradition \nis Bushido. Master Ohta the head of our association JKA England says \nthat the way of the samurai has a direct influence on Karate. The \nOkinawan&#39;s despite seeing themselves as a seperate nation to the \nJapanese for a long time, were Samurai. Master Funakoshi developer of \nthe Shotokan style was a son of a Samurai. It is a common \nmisconception that Karate is nothing to do with the Samurai, due to \nthe more common sport Karate. However if you study Bushido, Zen and \ntraditional Karate as I do then you will see the Samurai influence. \nAs an Anglo-Japanese myself this is very important to me, I hope you \ncan find more information on the Samurai and Zen. But never take the \nmartial arts at face value.\n\n\n\nI am a member of the JKAA (Japanese Karate Association of Australia) \nand have been practicing Shotokan Karate for about 12 years. Too this \nday I haven&#39;t seen any relationship with Bushido nor has there been \nany reference to the Samurai. Now I&#39;m not saying you are wrong, all \nI&#39;m saying is that the Australian branch of the JKA dose not use any \nreferences to Bushido nor do they have any Samurai influences. Now I \nalso practice Ninjutsu, which is very heavily influenced by Bushido \nand the Samurai way. For example, there is a great emphasis on \nintuition training and stealth training. To our original poster, a \ngood book to look into would be &quot;code of the Samurai&quot; by \nThomas Cleary. One advice I have is to keep in mind that Bushido was \na way of life for these people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\nThen perhaps you have not studied true JKA Karate, there is such a strong influence from Bushido it is so plain. I suggest you study for a longer length of time. Try reading some of the books by Funakoshi, Demura and Nakayama. Or you could e-mail the mother association in Tokyo the JKA. The web site is www.jka.or.jp\n\nI strongly suggest you do more research into the Samurai and martial arts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n ALL-NEW Yahoo!
