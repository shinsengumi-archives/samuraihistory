A few years \nago I did some (very basic) undergrad research into the martial roles of \nwomen durring the emergence of the samurai as a dominant class. Characters \npeople might recognise include Tomoe Gozen and Masako Hojo, although my work \ngives a little more detail then is generally published on these women and \nlooks and several others. If this is appropriate content for this group and \nanyone is interested in a read, I&#39;ll post it.\nThanks!\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nï¿½ Price FOXTEL Digital Installation On-Line Limited Offer:  \nhttp://ninemsn.com.au/share/redir/adTrack.asp?mode=click&clientID=225&referral=Hotmail_tagline_July04&URL=http://ad.au.doubleclick.net/clk;9412514;9681905;p?http://www.foxtel.com.au/2231.htm\n\n\n\n"
