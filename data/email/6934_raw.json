I have read that doubles were\n&gt;used both in battle and to allow more time while a successor is chosen\n&gt;following a death, however no examples were provided for either of this\n&gt;two scenarios.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Angus\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo, the use of a double by TAKEDA Shingen is groundless.  Totally fiction.\n\nA book named &quot;Kou-you-gun-kan&quot;, which was written by KOUSAKA\nMasanobu (Shingen&#39;s &quot;boyfriend&quot; and adviser) and his nephew KASUGA\nSoujirou in some time from 1596 to 1624,  says that Shingen wanted to\nsuppress his heath for three years, but it dosen&#39;t mention about kagemusha\nat all.  And Takeda clan seemed to fail to keep Shingen&#39;s will.  \nAdditionally\nKou-you-gun-kan has so many exaggerated stories that historians don&#39;t\nregard it as reliable source so much.  ( I think there is no problem for \nus to\nbelieve only Shingen&#39;s will part though.)\n\nMoreover, a fact that Death of TAKEDA Shigenobu (Shingen&#39;s brother)\nin Kawanakajima could be regarded as a death as Shingen&#39;s &quot;kagemusha&quot;\nseems toreinforce the legend of Shingen&#39;s double.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
