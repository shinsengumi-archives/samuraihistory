I studied Aikido for a while when I was younger. I decided one day I wanted to pursue the sword, but my old sensei wasnt teaching any more. He worked at the Army Surplus store I frequent. So at night, I would take my sword there to the store and he would show me forms and katas and such. I havent studied very much. Hence why in one previous email I said &quot;my very limited training&quot;. On a side note, Im working my way thru some books on the Eishin Ryu until I can find a sensei to start taking classes. \n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\n\nDATE: Wed, 10 Dec 2003 19:26:12\nFrom: &quot;M. R. Williams&quot; &lt;amacobra@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\n&gt;Mr. Wilson,\n&gt;\n&gt;  That is where the issue of differences between styles comes in.  I train \n&gt;in Muso Shinden Ryu and have been taught to keep the ha (cutting edge) up \n&gt;until the last moment.  This is partly to cut down on the noise that a \n&gt;battou would cause and partly to cut down on any friction.  Any sand or dirt \n&gt;inside the saya would stratch up the side of the blade if it was drawn in \n&gt;any manner besides ha up.  Since blades, when properly on display, on shown \n&gt;ha up with the tsuka (handle) to the left it would be displaying the side \n&gt;that was getting scratched up.\n&gt;  This is just what I have been taught.  Out of curiosity, what style of \n&gt;Iaido did you study?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Peace,\n&gt;\n&gt;Matt Williams\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Cell phone �switch� rules are taking effect � find out more here. \n&gt;http://special.msn.com/msnbc/consumeradvocate.armx\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
