What days!\n\nIt happened (I believe) in 1586, when Hideyoshi was having all of the \nDaimyo come to him to essentially swear allegiance.  Ieyasu was the \nonly Daimyo who refused the &quot;inviation&quot;, so Hideyoshi was stuck with \na choice - Does he attack Ieyasu, or find another way to get him \nto &quot;submit&quot;?  Hideyoshi&#39;s choice was to send his own mother to \nIeyasu, essentially as a hostage.  Today I was watching a TV show \nthat I had taped a few days ago called - &quot;Kono Hito o Miyo - Toyotomi \nHideyoshi&quot; which covered the incedent.  It basicaly said that \nHideyoshi was a master at reading people.  It stated that Hideyoshi \nknew that Ieyasu was taken from his own mother at a very young age, \nand that because of this he would take care of Hideyoshi&#39;s mother.  \nThe incedent you mentioned happened while his mother was at \nHamamatsu, although the TV show didnt mention it - it was brought up \non the Samurai Forum a few days ago.  Basically, Ieyasu showed up at \nOsaka castle, and everyone saw this as a significant event showing \nthat Ieyasu was submitting to Hideyoshi.  So Hideyoshi basically won \nwithout fighting, and his mother came back without a scratch.  \n\nPersonally, I dont understand the reason the the other daimyo didnt \nsee Hideyoshi&#39;s mother going to Hamamatsu as Hideyoshi submitting to \nIeyasu, particularly because it was very well known how greatly \nHideyoshi cared about his mother....\n\n\n"
