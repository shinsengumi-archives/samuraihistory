Maybe I&#39;m ignoring or \n&gt; forgetting =\r\nsomething? I would like to know exactly what&#39;s the problem \n&gt; with this tex=\r\nt.\n\n\nI have the book, but have never read it, and also didn&#39;t write that\n&quot;c=\r\nritique&quot;, but right now flipping through the book, the only thing I\ncan ass=\r\nume without actually reading it is that it might severely\noverplay the impo=\r\nrtance of bujutsu and could be based on myths and\nmisinformation that go al=\r\nong with Bujutsu like cake with ice cream.  I\nnotice that there are some ac=\r\ntual history books listed along with\narticles out of &quot;black belt&quot; magazine.=\r\n  I don&#39;t know of any\nuniversity-published books on Japanese history that h=\r\nave anything at\nall to do with Bujutsu, so I&#39;m wondering how these books we=\r\nre put to\nuse in the writing of &quot;Secrets of the Samurai&quot;.  I&#39;m interested t=\r\no\nhear the opinions of people who have actualy read (and apparently\nhated) =\r\nit.\n\nI must say that the section on &quot;Kiaijutsu&quot; starting on p. 406 gives me=\r\n\nmajor pause:\n\n&quot;Few details are available about the actual training techniq=\r\nues which\nwere used to develop that preliminary unification of powers in th=\r\ne\nhara which allowed certain bujin to paralyze, kill, or, on the other\nhand=\r\n, save another warriors&#39;s life via a concentrated shout.&quot;\n\nUm... what? Man,=\r\n no wonder Hideyoshi couldn&#39;t take Korea, he didn&#39;t\nhave enough Kiai-Bujin =\r\nto yell at the enemy.\n\n\n"
