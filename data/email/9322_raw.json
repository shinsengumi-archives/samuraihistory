First question, what kind of steels were the katana\n&gt;made of. second question, this one I have been arguing about with a\n&gt;friend of mine, he says that katana back then could weigh up to 50lbs!\n&gt;I say up to 5lbs, so I was hoping somebody could answer that. And I\n&gt;more question I&#39;ve read on the Internet that Miyamoto Musashi used a\n&gt;bigger katana than most people and I was wandering if that is true.\n&gt;Thanks.-Martin\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nUutisista turhaan tietoon.
