Consequently I talked\n&gt; like a woman would and most of the guys I worked\n&gt; with in Japan thought I was gay.    Nothing like\n&gt; being pulled away by your boss and being told that\n&gt; the company doesnï¿½t like to employ perverts.\n\nI sympathize. I spent my year as an exchange student\nin a family with three extroverted females (mom and 2\ndaughters) and one very introverted father.\nAdditionally, when I wasn&#39;t with them, I spent most of\nmy time speaking with my girlfriend. About 4 months in\nthey started laughing at me, telling me &quot;you sound\nlike a girl&quot;. I got mad--after all, wasn&#39;t it their\nfault? I WAS imitating them, since that&#39;s what they\nheard. Plus, at school 95% of the teachers were\nfemale, and they don&#39;t teach you malespeak. All the\nguys in the class lodged a protest and lobbied for\nmore male teachers, and at home everyone was put on\nnotice to correct me anytime I spoke like a girl.\nPlus, I started paying attention to men on TV. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nDress up your holiday email, Hollywood style.
