Does any one have this? \n&gt;Is it highly recomended?\n&gt;The only problem is that most places don&#39;t have it in stock\n&gt;(it&#39;s from 1963), the one place I did find it is selling it\n&gt;for US$395.00.\n\nFortunately I&#39;m lucky enough to have both of these books, and to have\nbought them when they were way more affordable. The second is in essence\nan update of the first, with some differences in content, but not 400\ndollars worth. I would recommend getting his latest book and borrowing\nthe other through inter-library loan if you can, so you can compare the\ntwo without crashing your bank account.\n\n&gt;Also does anyone have Mitsuo Kure&#39;s &#39;SAMURAI: An\n&gt;Illustrated History&#39;?  What&#39;s your impression of this one?\n\nAgain a nice book, and worth having for the photographs. Unlike his\nprevious work, this is laid out in chronological order, so you can see\nthe development of the kit. The book also has sketches by Dr Sasama, aka\nMr Japanese armour, who sadly died last year.\n\nHope this is of some help.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
