The image you&#39;ve got in your\n&gt;  head is from the Edo period. \n\n\nHere is something I&#39;ve got from the &quot;Online dictionary of history and\ntraditions&quot;\n(http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/search?dbname=histg&sword=hakama) :\n\n&quot;As  attested  by  Haniwa  doll  of  Kofun  period,  origin  of hakama\n(Japanese  trousers)  was  very old. Under an influence of the Chinese\ncivilization, the usage of hakama had declined during Heian period and\nreplaced  by  kimono  with  a long skirt, especially among women. When\nsamurai  clans  took the power in the middle ages, the usage of hakama\nbecame  again  popular  among  men. Hakama for women resurfaced during\nMeiji period as a girl&#39;s school uniform.&quot;\n\n\nAnother source (http://www.shindai.com/articles/hakama.htm) states the\nfollowing (+ some more info):\n\n&quot;A  hakama  is  the  skirt-like pants that some aikidoka wear. It is a\ntraditional  piece of samurai clothing. The standard gi worn in aikido\nas well as in other martial arts such as Judo or Karate was originally\nunderclothes. Wearing it is part of the tradition of (most schools of)\naikido.\n\nThe  hakama  were  originally  meant to protect a horseman&#39;s legs from\nbrush, etc., - not unlike a cowboy&#39;s leather &#39;chaps&#39;. Leather was hard\nto  come  by  in  Japan,  so  heavy  cloth was used instead. After the\nsamurai as a class dismounted and became more like foot-soldiers, they\npersisted  in  wearing  horseman&#39;s  garb because it set them apart and\nmade them easily identifiable.\n\nThere were different styles of hakama though. The type worn by today&#39;s\nmartial  artists  -  with  &quot;legs&quot; - is called a joba hakama, (roughly,\nhorseriding  thing  into  which  one steps). A hakama that was kind of\nlike  a  tube  skirt - no legs - another and the third was a very long\nversion of the second. It was worn on visits to the Shogun or Emperor.\nThe  thing  was  about  12-15  feet long and was folded repeatedly and\nplaced   between   the   feet  and  posterior  of  the  visitor.  This\nnecessitated their shikko (&quot;knee walking&quot;) for their audience and made\nit  extremely unlikely that they could hide a weapon (retainers suited\nthem up) or rise quickly to make an attack.&quot;\n\n\n\nHope  some pieces of this info might be useful to you, guys. And it is\ninteresting that I also heard soe time ago from one of my friends that\nhakama  was  used to camouflage your legs&#39; moves, but I never actually\nread about that...\n\n\nP.s.  My first post to the group. Please, do not take too skeptical...\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n Yauheni Zamastsyanin                       mailto:yauheni.z@...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
