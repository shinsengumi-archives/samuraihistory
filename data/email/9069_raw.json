I like to write and I love samurai; I&#39;ve \nbeen =\r\ntrying to mix those two together to make a decent samurai story \nbut I&#39;ve f=\r\nailed miserably... So I thought that maybe I needed more \ninfo on the Samur=\r\nai and that&#39;s where you guys come in (please help \nme!! *bows)\n\nI read on t=\r\nhe samurai archives that when kids reach the age 13 they \nreceive their fir=\r\nst real sword and armor and thus become a samurai. (I \nmight be wrong, for =\r\nI&#39;m writing from memory, if I am please correct \nme) Any of you guys know m=\r\nore about this ceremony? Was it only for \nmale 13 year olds? Once they rece=\r\nived their real sword were they \nallowed to join the &#39;full-fledged&#39; samurai=\r\n on the battlefield? \n\n*Please help me if you can!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
