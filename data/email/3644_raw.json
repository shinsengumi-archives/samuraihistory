There was samurai armor in the\nmix and the lead guy said it was out of place because there was no\nformal Japanese military until 1865. Am I wrong, but I thought when\nthe army went to Meiji they did away with the armor and used the\nuniform and guns or did I just misundertand what happened?\n\n\n"
