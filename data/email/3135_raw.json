Geisha, just like &quot;ninja&quot; are a Edo Jidai\nphenomenon. There were entertainers, prostitutes, and\nthe like, but no formal &quot;geisha&quot; group existed. They\nweren&#39;t settled into quarters, and the word wasn&#39;t\neven used, as Cepo said, until the 1700&#39;s. And of\ncourse they aren&#39;t connected with super ninja or\nanything--it&#39;s a freaking game, people need to get\nover it. \n\nnate\n\n--- &#65417;ric Ch&#39405;ard\n&lt;ericvietnam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; If I may. Geishas definitely were active during the\n&gt; Sengoku Jidai. They were \n&gt; &quot;stationed&quot; in a special urban area (some kind of a\n&gt; red light sector) and \n&gt; regrouped in houses (same system as today).\n&gt; Their role should not however be associated with\n&gt; that of a &quot;super ninja&quot; or \n&gt; have any political implications... to my opinion,\n&gt; their presence in Total \n&gt; War is not welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Anthony J.
