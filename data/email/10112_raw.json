What strikes me as I read what you guys are\ntalking about is that in this book, it&#39;s all about your name. Your name,\nyour family is the primary thing.  Next comes banners and emblems, which\ndisplay family type things.  Next comes the heirloom swords and forged\nobjects.  Which are highly prized but are definitely objects not closely\nrelated to the identity of the individual or family. Although someone may\nwield a famous and named object and describe the object in detail, it&#39;s the\nsame thing to me as saying Wild Bill Hickock used a Winchester36 with a\npearl handle.  People remember Wild Bill.  The gun not so much.  At least\nthat&#39;s the way I read The Taiheiki.\n\nPreviously almost all my sense of Japanese samurai culture came from samurai\nfilms.  And I did get the impression that objects such as swords were\nrevered like some religions impart all this spiritual stuff to certain\nobjects.  But now that I&#39;m reading the actual history, I&quot;m getting a much\nbetter picture. It was who you are and what your reputation is, who your\nfamily is, where you are from, and who you are connected to. In that order.\nEverything else appears to be a distant second.  At least that&#39;s what I&#39;m\nunderstanding from what I&#39;m reading.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
