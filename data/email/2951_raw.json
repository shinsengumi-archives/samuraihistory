By the way if you have ComcastOnDemand go to \nCable Faves and click it. Then click History Channel and look for &quot;Samurai \nWarriors&quot;. Click it and you will see a superb 1 hour documentary on the \nHistory of the Samurai(one who serves) from the beginnings to the present. \nIt includes a sword forging demo. You know some swords had as many as 1 \nmillion layers of metal!! This is why Samurai katanas are so flexible and \nstrong! See it if you can.
