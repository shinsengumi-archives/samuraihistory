It also gave me \n&gt; some insights on the folks who claim to have a &quot;Japanese Samurai \n&gt; Sword from World War Two.&quot;  According to Mr. Sinclair, 90% of Showa \n&gt; swords are, essentially, little more than mass-produced blades, \n&gt; which is a pity.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot; \n&gt; &lt;tom.davidson@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Gabriel - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The toledo sword site looks a bit too commercial for my liking - \n&gt; marketing what &#39;looks \n&gt; &gt; good&#39; and will sell, rather than what is correct.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As a one-time iaidoka, I am not enamoured of their products - by \n&gt; the look of it there&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; more wrong than there&#39;s right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I suggest searching for &#39;nihonto&#39; rather than &#39;samurai sword&#39; \n&gt; or &#39;katana&#39; or the like, at least \n&gt; &gt; you might get to a somewhat knowledgeable site.
