I understand the topknot was very important to the samurai class, but why in various prints, paintings and historical depictions of the times peasants are also showen with semi-shaven heads and topknots?\nI&#39;ve read the reason samurai semi-shaved their heads was for an easier and more comfortable fit when wearing a helmet. Fact or fiction? \nWhilst all samurai seemed to have a topknot unless they were monks not all seemsd to shave the top part of their heads, why?  \nAny ideas?\nCheers,\nMiles\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nFind what you are looking for with the Lycos Yellow Pages\nhttp://r.lycos.com/r/yp_emailfooter/http://yellowpages.lycos.com/default.asp?SRC=lycos10\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
