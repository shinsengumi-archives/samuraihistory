The dimensions are 80mm by 80mm in \n15mm scale. I found a good diagram in a Bryant book that shows the \ncamp organized, however my question is how would the Maku screens be \norganized? Are they in a rectangle shap but with three sides of walls \nwith an open front or fully enclosed , if so where is the door \nopening? Would it be a full square with a small opening in the front?\n\nWhat mon would be used on the screen? The Takeda black lozenge on a \nred background like in his battle standard?\n\nWhat about Uesugi his love bird mon? Would his personal retainers \nhave that as their mon on the sashimono?\n\nAnd who would be inside the maku screen? The gen, his nobori and uma-\njirushi,his consultants, some personal guard retainers. Would the \nTaiko drums be inside or outside? What about the Conch trumpets would \nthey be in or out?\n\nHis personal horse would be the rear I would assume?\n\n\n"
