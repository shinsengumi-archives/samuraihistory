You may be a\nmath major, but I&#39;m a language major. \n\nWhile B is a tangential logical step that may outgrow\nfrom Part A, I stopped at Part A.

B does not\nmean that A is incorrect. \n\n\n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m mis-reading something. I&#39;m not sure where\n&gt; Part  A ends and Part B\n&gt; begins. And actually, this may be the best way to\n&gt; make my point. That the\n&gt; borderline between Part A and Part B is not as\n&gt; distinct as some would like\n&gt; to make it out to be. Where some would see Part A as\n&gt; being a disjoint set\n&gt; from Part B, I see them as intersecting sets. Oh\n&gt; lord, here I go with my\n&gt; math. &lt;g&gt;  Can&#39;t help it, I was a math major.

You and\n&gt; Onna are then bringing in part B--where I don&#39;t\n&gt; disagree with you--and\n&gt; giving it as much weight as part A. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But also remember that many times a surgeon&#39;s\n&gt; scalpal frequently works \n&gt; &gt; better than a single slice with a katana.\n&gt; \n&gt; See, here&#39;s my problem--I hold a 5th Dan in\n&gt; Tank-jutsu. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Yahoo!
