I forgot to say that I am a neophyte player myself............   great way for me, too, to combine all the skills I&#39;ve \ndeveloped over the last couple of lifetimes.\n\nI do appreciate your taking the time for such a detailed reply.........   and I have noted that people who &#39;play&#39; or do reenactments \nseem to have a different perspective on history that do people who don&#39;t.  Many I have spoken with, or read their articles seem more \ngrounded and comprehending of --- oh, how shall I say it---  how the political, religious, and social milieus affected daily like, \nand in turn,  how those things affected regional and ultimately global politics.\n\nI am glad to say that my own study of Japan and from an SCA perspective is having a positive effect on my own martial training, and \ndaily life.  It&#39;s a very curious process to me, and I am also curious how others approach history and how, if at all, it affects how \nthey live out their daily lives.\n\nAppreciatively,\n\nLizzie\nin learning mode\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: DinoKruz@...\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 2004 8:39 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] SCA\n\n\nIn a message dated 12/1/04 5:59:03 PM Central Standard Time, lizzirrd@...\nwrites:\n\nJust for the h-e-double-hockey-sticks of it..... how many of you &#39;play&#39; in\nthe Society for Creative Anachronism......  if you do, do\nyou pursue &#39;European&#39; or &#39;Asian/Japanese personas? (No, lol, I don&#39;t mean as\nin &#39;chase&#39; them...)\n\nLizzie\nThere&#39;s some 30,000 current active members within the SCA not to mention\nassociate people (non paid) - whom I was for 5 years (currently an active &#39;paid&#39;\nmember for 2 years) - along with another couple of thousand folks who are semi\nactive but not current. Which would make the SCA one of the (if not the)\nlargest re-enactment societies with a world wide base. I would hazard to guess that\nthe UK Sealed Knot and other English Civil War Societies would be next at\n6,000 actives (including children).\n\nBeing in the SCA is similiar to most other re-enactment societies or groups\nwith an opportunity to &#39;recreate&#39; living history - in combat, day to day\nliving, etc.\nAnd I would also guess based on personal experience with others both on and\noff this list - that many people have &#39;explored&#39; one or more &#39;personas&#39; with in\nthe SCA - being myself both interested in western and eastern culture.\nAs a member of the SCA - I&#39;ve been able to actively pursue (with others of\nsimiliar interest)- blacksmithing, armoursmithing, period woodworking, heavy\ncombat, leatherworking, archery, casting, and more....\n\nIf you have some real interest in the SCA you can get some answers at\nwww.sca.org - or search for a local group in your area.\n\nKyostti,\nCompany of Rakehells\nButtlers Dragoons\nHouse of Sir Rashid\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n      Yahoo!
