If \n&gt; any one answered my request for a discussion about Choshu&#39;s role in \nthe \n&gt; bakumatsu period, I&#39;m sorry for not replying - maybe you could post \nit again.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the meantime I have another question: does anyone have \ninformation or \n&gt; can suggest resources on life in the imperial court in the \nbakumatsu period. \n&gt; I&#39;ve become fascinated by the seven nobles who were spirited away \nto \n&gt; Choshu after the defeat by Satsuma and Aizu in 1863.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Gillian\n\n\n"
