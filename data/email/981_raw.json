Miyamoto \n&gt;Musashi, the inventor of the Nitenryu sword style which used both katana \n&gt;and wakizashi as weapons, which, as you can guess, was very controversial. \n&gt;It is a historical fiction and tells a good story. I recommend it to anyone \n&gt;interested in Japanese samurai and history.\n&gt;\n&gt;     As a side question, how many of you have read the Book of Five Rings \n&gt;by Miyamoto Musashi? I am just interested to know.\n&gt;\n&gt;Compassion go with you,\n&gt;\n&gt;     ~Sasaki Kojiro~\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: squrpio_prince\n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, July 22, 2002 10:58 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Musashi By Eiji Yoshikawa\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   IS it any good? I am currently reading Taiko and I think that it is a\n&gt;   great novel of JApanese arts. I like the author and would like to\n&gt;   know about Musashi before I read it.
