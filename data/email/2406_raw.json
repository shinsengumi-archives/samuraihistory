A, which I also could find on the web. But,\nI could not confirm that there is no &#39;full&#39; Enlish\ntranslation.\nSince Boyle&#39;s book is a little expensive to buy, I\nwant to make sure that there is no other alternative\nto his book before purchasing his.\n\nI will appreicate if any of historians here could help\nme with this.
