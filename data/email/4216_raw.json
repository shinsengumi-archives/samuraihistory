In the case of direct lineage within the main \nhouse, one might represent the generation in question. Any one might  \nbe given to retainers as reward further confusing the issue.\n\tWhen one looks at sword furniture,armour and other items we often see \na single mon applied, depending on age and quality the assumption is \nthese are made for retainers and only with convincing provenance said \nto be those of some lord. for example;\n\tA daughter of the house of Shimazu, is adopted into the Kuge (court \nfamilies) and then married to the Tokugawa Shogun. Thus as a wedding \ngift to her Shimazu father we see a koshirae with Shimazu, Aoi and Kiku \nmon all applied to the saya and fittings. Based on late-Edo history one \nwouldn&#39;t expect to see these three in combination...\n-t\n\n\n"
