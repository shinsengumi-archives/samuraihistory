I&#39;m kinda confused...\nIt states that bushido was &quot;meant to keep samurais subservient to \ntheir employing daimyos,&quot; however, when I read the book by Inazo \nNitobe, &quot;Bushido: the Soul of Japan,&quot; it never mentions anything \nabout it.. he mentioned that bushido was practiced by some samurais \neven before the edo era. It only flourished during does times but \nnot exactly created during those periods. Does it mean that Bushido \nwas created not to refine the samurais but to stop them form doing \natrocities? \n\n\n"
