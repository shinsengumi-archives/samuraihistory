When did a sword without a tsuba (yes, I&#39;ll say\n&gt;&gt; it, like Lucy\n&gt;&gt; Liu&#39;s sword in Kill Bill) become acceptable, if it\n&gt;&gt; ever did?\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Never. Swords in shirasaya, the scabbard with no tsuba\n&gt; (usually light wood colored) are kept that way for\n&gt; storage. For someone to carry it and use it, they&#39;d\n&gt; take it and mount it in a normal mounting. Shirasaya\n&gt; protect the blade while it&#39;s being stored or shipped.\n\nWhilst it&#39;s true that swords without tsuba never became widely acceptable,\nthey certainly did exist.  The aikuchi (no tsuba) tanto was accepted and\nworn.  I think it is in Nobuo Ogasawara sensei&#39;s little book that there is a\npicture of an katana owned by Uesugi Kenshin that did not have a tsuba.  I\nhave seen other katana in the books without tsuba, but in &quot;real-life&quot;\ncollecting I have only seen aikuchi tanto.\n\nregards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n\n"
