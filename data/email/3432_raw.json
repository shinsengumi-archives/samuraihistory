Who are you, who do you work for or where are you studying \nthat you need this kind of info? What is it you hope to learn about the \nBuke (Samurai) as a class? What period of history are you interested \nin, most Japanese Grandfathers (of those living) were born after the \nSamurai as a class were abolished. I am sure there is a world of info \navailable to you without need for interviews.\n-tom\n\nP.S. surely there are Japanese banks operating in Singapore, walk in to \nany of those and you are likely to meet a descendant of a samurai...\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\n\n\n"
