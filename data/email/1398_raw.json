I don&#39;t remember where I got that \nfrom, \n&gt; but did I misread &quot;Aburagawa&quot; as &quot;Yugawa&quot; or was &quot;Yugawa&quot; his \n&gt; grandfather&#39;s correct last name?\n\nYes,Abura can be read as yu,but I think Aburagawa is its correct way \nto read.\n\n\n\n&gt; Also, I have the mothers for all of Shingen&#39;s children now except \nfor \n&gt; Takeda (Kadoyama) Yoshihisa and the daughter that married Uesugi \n&gt; Kagekatsu (I don&#39;t have her actual name either - my sources all \n&gt; say &quot;Onna&quot;) - anyone have thier mother(s)?.\n\nI have never heard the name of Kadoyama Yoshihisa.Isn&#39;t it Kazurayama \nNobusada,Shingen&#39;s 6th son.\nThe daughter who married Kagekatsu is generally known by the name \nKiku-hime.\nAburagawa-bunin bore both of them.She also was the mother of Matsu-\nhime who was to marry Oda Nobutada(Kimyoumaru).\n\n\n\n\n&gt; As for Oda Nobutaka&#39;s mother, Saka-shi - does the -shi just denote \n&gt; that she is from the Saka clan, or does the -shi have another \nmeaning?\n&gt; \nYes,you are absolutely right.In many cases,women&#39;s first name aren&#39;t \nkept in Japanese histrical records.So we have no means but to call \nthem by their familly name.\n\n\nIt&#39;s my pleasure to contribute to your work...\n\nShinsei\n\n\n"
