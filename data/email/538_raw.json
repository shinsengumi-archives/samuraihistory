Maas, &quot;Hired Swords&quot; By Dr. Karl F. \nFriday, and &quot;Legacies of the sword&quot; also by Dr. Friday.\n Amazon.com should have all of these books, or other online bookstores will \nbut I would start with Stephen Turnbulls books as they are concise, easy to \nread and well illustrated with photos and drawings. A good start.\n Good luck.\n Abayo.\n Ben Sharples.\n\n"
