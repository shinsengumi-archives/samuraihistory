This would involve presenting your claim for vendetta to \nthe government and getting the OK to proceed. Such &quot;revenge&quot; killings \nwere accepted and pretty much considered a duty. After the samurai \nhad received the OK, tracked down the son, and killed him, he would \nhave to report his act to the local authorities along with presenting \nhis documentation. Also, in pursuing your vendetta, you could not \ncreate a riotous situation or (in theory at least) risk the safety of \nuninvolved parties. Then the samurai would go his merry way without \nany negative legal consequences at all, having fulfilled his duty. Of \ncourse, this could invite a vendetta from the just killed son&#39;s \nfamily/retainers....\nIf the samurai just killed the son without following the rules, it \nwas up to the authorities to decide his fate based on the situation\n(in your case, since the son had staged a coup and the father&#39;s \nretainer killed him, the retainer might get off with a &#39;slap on the \nwrist&#39;). \nBefore the Edo period, revenge killings were expected but not codifed \nas during the Shogunate (at least not on a national level) so the \nlocal reaction to a revenge or duty killing varied greatly. \nIn either case, the son in question is dead meat during the Edo \nperiod-even if the samurai didn&#39;t get him the government would \n(crucifixtion). \n\n\n"
