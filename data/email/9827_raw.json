It \nis=\r\n a variant of the verb to serve which I believe is/was samuru. There \nreall=\r\ny isn&#39;t anyone that started the samurai. The earliest uses of the \nword sam=\r\nurai refered to mainly house servants in the Heian period. \nSometimes these=\r\n duties may have included guard duties. In time the term \nwould come to eve=\r\nntually have a mainly military context. One of the \nmore proper terms for l=\r\niterally warrior would be bushi=95=90=8Em .Bushi is \nmade up up 2 Chinese c=\r\naharacters. One being=81@=95=90=81@which means military, \nor martial... and=\r\n the other being =8Em=81@which means a gentleman, \nnobleman, aristocrat. Bu=\r\nt, this does not mean that samurai is \nincorrect. Some experts feel that th=\r\ne terms samurai and bushi have \ndifferent implications in their meanings. S=\r\nome consider bushi to mean \nthose who come from military families and have =\r\na hereditary occupation \nas profesional warriors. The character =8Em=81@imp=\r\nlying somekind of a \nstatus and such to that occupation. To be fair, there =\r\nare those who \nalso use the term bushi to describe anyone that gave militar=\r\ny service, \npart time farmer/warrior or professional warriors. Where was so=\r\nme say \nthat samurai covers all those groups, but bushi were a subsection o=\r\nf \nthe overall group of those who gave military service. So often the use \n=\r\nof exactly which term for who seems to largely be personal preferance. \nThi=\r\ns also gets a bit more complicated when one considers that in the \nmedieval=\r\n period a large number of even fairly professional warriors \nwould often pa=\r\nrticipate in some kind of farming themselves even if \ntheir main occupation=\r\n was military service. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
