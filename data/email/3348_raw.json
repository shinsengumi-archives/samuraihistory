The site was certainly \ninteresting. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t read Japanese. I tried \ntranslating it with the Altavista software but the program really \ncouldn&#39;t give even a slightly coherent idea of what was being \nexpressed.\nIf anyone knows of a decent translation site, it would be excellent. \nI couldn&#39;t find one. I&#39;m sure there are a lot better Japanese \nwebsites out there on Japanese history than there are English.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\nlistowner@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This site puts the rank in heirarchy, and the links along the \n&gt; lefthand side break them down further and give the readings and \n&gt; explanations:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Suzuran/7123/hyou.html\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks like these are all more or less Kamakura-era ranks (or at \n&gt; least pre-sengoku) and at one point were actually associated with \n&gt; concrete positions. By the time the Sengoku came around, I think \nthey \n&gt; were more or less empty titles.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;muds_theaz&quot; \n&lt;muds_theaz@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi there,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently researching The Sengoku period. When searching \naround \n&gt; &gt; on the web, or reading through books I see mention of court \ntitles \n&gt; &gt; such as Gyobusho (court minister), and ranks such as vassals and \n&gt; &gt; retainers. However, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to actually \nfind \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; layout of the ranks in these sorts of hierarchies and what came \n&gt; above \n&gt; &gt; them, below them. Such as: The Daimyo, below him he had vassals \n&gt; (how \n&gt; &gt; did he choose who were to be his vassals?) and what is the \n&gt; difference \n&gt; &gt; between a Vassal and a Retainer? Ideally I&#39;d like to find out \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; the ranking system was for both the court and the countries \n&gt; military \n&gt; &gt; was (not just the Daimyos). And, even better, the Imperial Guards.\n&gt; &gt; Also, does anyone know if this hierarchy changed when Yoritomo \n&gt; began \n&gt; &gt; the trend of Shogun leaders rather then Royal heads of state?\n\n\n\n"
