That IS what Lee and Grant did!!!  Sure, they fought before, but not at this particular time. The part being disagreed with is your statement that one couldn&#39;t imagine Lee and Grant getting together for a confab, b/c it was such a different culture or time in history or something to that effect. One can easily &quot;imagine&quot; it (bla-bla-bla, how&#39;s that for being overliteral?), especially if they did in fact meet in person to negotiate surrender.\n\nSay, is Robert E. Lee in Nobility of Failure? &lt;snicker&gt;\n\nOh, and Brandon, about the advertising and the military budget, yes, they&#39;re connected in a &quot;round about way&quot;. Certainly not directly. Don&#39;t take my statements as an attack on the us military; they&#39;re not. But, I think maybe I&#39;ll call my congressman next time I see military commercial... ha-ha.\n\n\n&gt; Why exactly am I being &quot;overliteral&quot;? The questions revolved around the use of a \n&gt; commander&#39;s reputation and the fear of,or deception, as a means of conducting a \n&gt; campaign without fighting. Truce negotiations leading to a surrender after a \n&gt; lengthy period of bloodshed could hardly be described as such.\n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Anthony J.
