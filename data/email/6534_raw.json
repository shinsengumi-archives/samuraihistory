He had lost his right hand, and so started training left-handed, but that is the only time I&#39;ve seen it. I once attended an aikido seminar at a club that allowed their left handed students to hold a bokken left handed-i.e.:left hand nearest the blade. What a lot of trouble that caused during bokken tori practice, since everyone else had trained for right-handed swordsmen!\n\nPaul Martin &lt;pmartin6@...&gt; wrote:\nHey group\n\nI&#39;ve just watched the movie, &#39;when the last sword is drawn&#39;. It featured a \nleft handed samurai who wore his swords on the right. Are there any famous \nhistorical figures who done this? I have never seen anyone in kendo or Iai \npractice left handed, so I was just wondering?\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
