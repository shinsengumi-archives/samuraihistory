With no\nradios, no airplanes, or any other ways to take in the big picture, how\nwould they know they are outnumbered?  Would they have a general idea of\navailable troops based on who the opposing general was, or maybe count the\nstandards and estimate?  I personally couldn&#39;t count 38,000 troops on my\nfingers ;) so in a battle such as Nagashino, at what point does one realize\nthey are outnumbered? (not only that, but by the time you are close enough\nto count, you have to contend with bullets and arrows.)\n\nc.w.\n\n\t-----Original Message-----\n\tFrom:\tNate Ledbetter [SMTP:ltdomer98@...]\n\tSent:\tMonday, April 08, 2002 3:37 PM\n\tTo:\tsamuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n\tSubject:\tRe: [samuraihistory] Question to you all...\n\n\tIn hindsight, it&#39;s obvious...you retreat.
