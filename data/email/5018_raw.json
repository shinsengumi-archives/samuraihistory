It certainly holds\n&gt; the meaning \n&gt; that you describe above. It also is used to refer to\n&gt; ritual \n&gt; suicide in a looser way. It is my understanding -\n&gt; and I could be \n&gt; wrong - that the edict from Ietsugu was meant to\n&gt; stop all forms of \n&gt; ritual suicide not just the one you describe.\n\nThis still doesn&#39;t sound right to me--I&#39;m going to\nhave to do a little research. Can you send me the\nkanji for &quot;junshi&quot;? And what year was Ietsugu&#39;s edict?\nI&#39;ll see if I can dig up the original and figure this\nout. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
