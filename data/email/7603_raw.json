Perhaps I hung more on that\nthen what you have above here--in your message, it\ncame across as &quot;it could have been, but really\nwasn&#39;t&quot;. That&#39;s what I&#39;m challenging--if I\nmisinterpreted, then we&#39;re on the same side. \n\n&gt; As for &quot;buying&quot; samurai status during the Edo\n&gt; period. This sometimes\n&gt; happened, particularly near the end of the period. A\n&gt; merchant family could\n&gt; offer their son to be married into a samurai family;\n&gt; the merchant son is\n&gt; &quot;adopted&quot; as the heir in marrying the samurai\n&gt; family&#39;s daughter. \n\nUm, substitute farmer for merchant, and that&#39;s\nessentially what I said:\n\n&gt; Could status be bought, like in Shogun? Not\n&gt; really--not that way. A rich farmer could possibly\n&gt; have been adopted into an impoverished samurai\n&gt; family\n&gt; and thereby &quot;made&quot; samurai, but I couldn&#39;t tell you\n&gt; if\n&gt; I&#39;ve ever come across that. It sounds too dramatic\n&gt; to\n&gt; me. \n\nHappened? Yes--documentably so. Common? No. Perhaps I\ndidn&#39;t convey what I wanted to with the &quot;Shogun&quot;\nreference--in the book. Gyoko, the Mama-san, tries to\nbargain with Toranaga to get her son &quot;named&quot; a\nsamurai. Not adopted, simply &quot;granted&quot; samurai\nstatus--it didn&#39;t really work that way, as both of our\nexamples show. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
