And they didn&#39;t wear any &quot;uniform&quot;. Kind of\nhard to find the fact that your a spy if you go\nslinking around in night clothes all the time, be they\nblue or black. Generally they wore whatever wasn&#39;t\nobtrusive. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
