I believe that the\n&gt; &gt; strategic concepts inherent in Yagyu Shinkage-ryu, the\n&gt; &gt; sword art practiced and chosen by the Shogunate as one\n&gt; &gt; of its official styles, guided them in their decision\n&gt; &gt; making.\n&gt;\n&gt; I rather think it had more to do with their politics and\n&gt; their alliances than their school of swordsmanship.\n&gt;\n&gt; Martial arts were never the be-all and end-all of Japanese\n&gt; history, despite the illusions of some modern dojo masters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt; -- \n&gt;\n&gt; Anthony J.
