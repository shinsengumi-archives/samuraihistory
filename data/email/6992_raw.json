He would like to know if anyone can verify if its \noriginal or replica.  I think it&#39;s a replica but I&#39;m no expert.  When \nhe bought it, someone had spray painted it red.  Now he&#39;s going \nthrough the process of removing the paint.  He found that the \nunderlayer is gold.  Looks very much like a replica shown in Tony&#39;s \nbook The Samurai (Osprey).  Please let me know what you think. \n\nBrandon\n\n\n\n\n"
