I am new (obviously).  My given name is Ste=\r\nphanie, but I&#39;ve been called (and answered to) all sorts of variations, for=\r\neignisations, and meaning-translations so you can pretty much call me whate=\r\nver you like.  My interest has recently been snared by Japanese history, es=\r\np the change from Tokugawa to Meiji and the samurai&#39;s position in all of th=\r\nat mess.  I&#39;ll freely admit it was not something academic that caught my at=\r\ntention, but anime (Rurouni Kenshin;both the TV series and the OVA for thos=\r\ne familiar).  I&#39;m a fencer, and have studied some forms of Asian martial ar=\r\nts, but never Kendo (it will be the next )--so that is where I stand in rel=\r\nation to this subject.  I look foreward to learning more through this group=\r\n.  Oh, and linguistically, I&#39;m illiterate as far as original sources--or ev=\r\nen contemporary ones, for that matter--on this topic are concerned, since I=\r\n have (essentially) no Japanese.\n \nNext, some citation:\n&quot;Komori Genjiro, he=\r\n changed his name into Kawakami Gensai(Hitokiri-Gensai). He changed his nam=\r\ne further into Takada Genbe...&quot;\nSource.\n&quot;The original model [for Himura Ken=\r\nshin] was supposed to be the Hitokiri Kawakami Gensai, but now they=92re co=\r\nmpletely different . . . (oh well.) Kawakami Gensai, one of the four great =\r\nHitokiris of the Bakumatsu, could be mistaken for a girl at first glance, b=\r\nut his nature was the complete opposite of his appearance: he was a cold, c=\r\nalculating man said to be the most terrible of the four. &quot;\nSource.\n \nFollow=\r\ning, the enquiries:\nI would like to know more about these four Hitokiri.  W=\r\nho were the other three? Who contracted them, i.e. where did their loyaltie=\r\ns lie?  The description of Gensai-dono on the first page I&#39;ve cited makes n=\r\no mention of his status during the Bakumatsu; where can I learn more about =\r\nhim, in particular.  Also, the two discriptions seem to be at great odds--o=\r\nne is ruthless and cold, one is warm and compassionate.  Is there an explan=\r\nation?\n \nAnother question, unrelated to the last:\nWhere could I find out wh=\r\nat kind of training a samurai had to have?  Did they have to be trained fro=\r\nm young ages, or were there any famous samurai who decided to become one la=\r\nter on?  I know there was a strict four-part caste system during the Edo/To=\r\nkugawa dynasty and that one of those classes was the samurai, or warrior cl=\r\nass.  And, purportedly kendo lost its flare and popularity immediately afte=\r\nr the Meiji Restoration; how true is that?  Certainly it had to have a larg=\r\ne enough group of followers that it survived to today...\n \nI know these are=\r\n really basic questions, child&#39;s play to most of those who&#39;ve been on the l=\r\nist (I&#39;m sure).  Please be patient while I learn, this is new to me. \n \nThn=\r\nx, in advance.\n\n\nLord, of your grace all that I hope is this--\nKeep the rea=\r\nlm of my pleasure prosperous,\nAvert from me the calamity of chastity,\nAnd k=\r\neep far from me the doom of repentance.\n~&#39;Ubayd-i Zaakaanii  \nhttp://www.li=\r\nvejournal.com/~sjcarpediem \n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yaho=\r\no!?\nSBC Yahoo!
