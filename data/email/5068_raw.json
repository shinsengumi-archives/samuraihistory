At the last Hanzo could not perform, and \nanother (a samurai who&#39;s name I can&#39;t recall) stepped in. \nIeyasu was heard to say &quot;Even that devil Hanzo couldn&#39;t... &quot;\n(from Sadler&#39;s bio. of Ieyasu)\n\nAgain, I have doubts about the whole validity of seppuku as a \ndemonstration of how much agony you can inflict on yourself, as \nI also think junshi etc. is a pointless waste of life...\n\nThere is a phenomena that occurs when fighting men have no \nfights in which to display their prowess - they turn upon \nthemselves or their compatriots to demonstrate their courage. \nThis is noted even in modern army units. I believe junshi etc. \nis a peacetime development based on the fact that in battle \nwhen a lord died his retainers invariably died alongside him in \nthe defeat.\n\nImagine the position of the Takeda if Shingen&#39;s 24 generals \nkilled themselves on the death of their master? In wartime the \ndaimyo would seek to ensure that his retainers protected his \nheir and worked for the continuance of the clan/han.\n\nThere is a story, in the biog. of Master Swordsman Tesshu, of a \nmeeting he had with the Edo public executioner. The man used \nto engage in the &#39;crossroad challenge&#39; (can&#39;t recall term) in \nwhich he would engage a passing samurai in swordplay.\n\nIn the biog, Tesshu stepped in to stop a duel, and the samurai \nchallenged actually feinted!\n\nThe executioner recounted to Tesshu that he would cross \nswords with his opponent, and if he could feel tension in the \nother&#39;s blade, he knew tha man was his. If, however, the other&#39;s \ngrip was loose and relaxed, he would opt for &#39;plan B&#39;, which was \nto throw his sword at his opponent, and run away.\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
