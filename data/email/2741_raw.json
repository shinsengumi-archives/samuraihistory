Yet one of the heaviest\nparts of his philosophy was about being a samurai and\nabout practicioners of Aikido being modern day samurai\nand so forth.  I know that someone being old and wise\ndoesn&#39;t make them right, but would all the &quot;There&#39;s no\nsuch thing as a Samurai!&quot; nay-sayers actually argue\nwith this?  I know reading several books about\nO-sensei, his word was enough for me to buy into the\nwhole &quot;spirit&quot; of the Samurai over the &quot;title&quot; of one.\n\nThere&#39;s many more examples, too.  I mean, I certainly\nwouldn&#39;t feel right going up to a family in modern day\nJapan that actually had a direct father to son lineage\nof &quot;Samurai&quot; blood and telling them that they weren&#39;t\na Samurai if they truely beleived they were.  I think\nthey have more of a right to make that decission than\nI do.\n\nFinally, what of the Japanese emperor?  Is he not\nemperor only in title with no real depth other than a\n&quot;pre-dated&quot; concept of an emperor in honor (a word I\nstress the use of in this situation).  If I&#39;m correct,\nwhat makes his title as emperor that much differant\nthan a nobleman&#39;s title of samurai?\n\nI am 19 years old, full anglo-saxon decent as I&#39;ve\nnoted already.  I wake every morning and pray to MY\nlord, Christ, and everynight before bed, on my knees,\nseiza position.  I practice kendo, kenjutsu, jiu\njitsu, aikido and am terribly interested in invovling\nmyself in kyudo and the use of japanese polearms.  I\nam pursuing a career in law enforcement and find\nbushido to be an excellent basis for my career, and\nmost importantly my faith, my relationship with\nChrist.  But I am not a Samurai, just a 19 year old\ngeek that wishes he could have been.  But who would\nsomeone like I, no matter how well versed in history,\nbe to tell someone that they weren&#39;t a Samurai?\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
