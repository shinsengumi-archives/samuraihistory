I&#39;m kinda confused...\n&gt; It states that bushido was &quot;meant to keep samurais subservient to \n&gt; their employing daimyos,&quot; however, when I read the book by Inazo \n&gt; Nitobe, &quot;Bushido: the Soul of Japan,&quot; it never mentions anything \n&gt; about it.. he mentioned that bushido was practiced by some \nsamurais \n&gt; even before the edo era. It only flourished during does times but \n&gt; not exactly created during those periods. Does it mean that \nBushido \n&gt; was created not to refine the samurais but to stop them form doing \n&gt; atrocities?\n\n\n"
