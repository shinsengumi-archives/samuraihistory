I live in\nDallas, Texas and work for The Crow Collection of Asian Art.  We are having\nan Armor exhibition opening on March 21st.\nI work in the Education Department for the museum.  As a result I am helping\nto develop a lesson plan for teachers and students and also putting together\nbackground information for the tour guides.  I do have some information, but\nam very interested in learning more.  One of the perks of my job is getting\nto see some of the exhibits before they go on display.  I am blown away by\nthe armor and masks. This stuff is sooo amazing and cool.  I can&#39;t wait to\nsee the public&#39;s reaction.  The reason I am writing this is to hopefully get\ninformation from those with more knowledge on this subject matter.  In\naddition to the Samurai Archives on the web, I was wondering if anyone might\nhave suggestions for more information (i.e. websites, books, movies, etc).\nI am also looking for pertinent information that might be especially\ninteresting to children.\n\nThanks so much!  I look forward to being a part of this group!!\n\nWarm regards,\nZehra Ahmad\nOutreach Coordinator\nThe Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection Of Asian Art\n\n"
