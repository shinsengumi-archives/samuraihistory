Ashigaru?\n\nThat&#39;s harder to say. The source I&#39;m getting this info from (t=\r\nhe\nIriki-In documents) doesn&#39;t show the word that is being translated for\nt=\r\nhe 5,068 personal followers of the mounted samurai. This figure would\nproba=\r\nbly encompass ashigaru as well as higher ranking non-mounted\nmilitary men a=\r\nnd samurai, and the higher ranking mounted samurai brought\nmore men with th=\r\nem than the lower ranking mounted samurai. \n\nIf I had to throw out a comple=\r\ntely unscientific guess I would maybe\nsuggest an average of 2-3 followers p=\r\ner mounted samurai being men\nranking higher than ashigaru. That seems reaso=\r\nnable to me, but it\nwouldn&#39;t shock me too much if I was completely wrong. A=\r\ns for the\nlandless men and squires, I&#39;m really not sure. Landless men would=\r\n\nprobably count as ashigaru, or non-samurai footmen to be more accurate,\nbu=\r\nt without knowing too much about the kaji kosho (squires) it&#39;s hard to\nsay =\r\nwhat their function would be. \n\nThe translator used the english term &#39;squir=\r\ne&#39; for the kaji kosho, which\ncould mean they were semi-aristocratic men who=\r\n may have in turn had\ntheir own followers, or they could have been non-comb=\r\natant general\nattendants. They were listed as having their own labourers as=\r\nsigned to\nthem, so that suggests that maybe they were likely the former - m=\r\nen of\nsome standing who may not have been direct retainers of the Shimazu,\n=\r\nmaybe village headmen and the like. In that case some may have worn\narmour,=\r\n but they probably would have functioned as ashigaru assigned\nunder a samur=\r\nai commander.\n\nAgain though, I&#39;m just guessing here. Maybe someone else mig=\r\nht be able\nto shed some light on some of this?\n\n-AngusH\n\n__________________=\r\n________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachm=\r\nents, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal atten=\r\ntion of the intended recipient.
