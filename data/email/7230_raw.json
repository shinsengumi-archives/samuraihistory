From what I understand, kokushi\nwas an Imperial Court post prior to the Kamakura bakufu that provided\nthe same role as the bakufu&#39;s shugo (with shugo actually being brought\nabout by the Kamakura bakufu to replace the kokushi). Is this correct?\nGenerally, did the kokushi actually stay in the lands they were\nresponsible for, or were they like Governors and resided in the capital?\n\nThanks,\nAngus\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
