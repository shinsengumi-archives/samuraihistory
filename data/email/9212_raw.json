I&#39;m an almost-35 year old male samurai enthusiast. \nI&#39;m int=\r\nerested in everything Japanese in general, but in samurai \nhistory in parti=\r\ncular. I watch chanbara movies, read Turnbull-\nsensei&#39;s books, play orienta=\r\nl role-playing games, that sort of things.\n\nI was reading the &quot;Specific nin=\r\nja misconceptions&quot; page, like a good \nnewbie, and having a good laugh out o=\r\nf it - even if it&#39;s nothing \nreally new to me, fortunately - when I stumble=\r\nd upon this sentence:  \n\n&lt;&lt;Even &quot;history&quot; books may not be legit--see &quot;Secr=\r\nets of the \nSamurai&quot;, which is, quite honestly, a pile of pig feces.&gt;&gt;\n\n(so=\r\nurce: http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/Ninja.html )\n\nI own a copy of &quot;=\r\nSecrets of the Samurai&quot; by Oscar Ratti and Adele \nWestbrook, which is, for =\r\nwhat I seem to remember, a very informative \nand accurate book, packed full=\r\n of useful info. Maybe I&#39;m ignoring or \nforgetting something? I would like =\r\nto know exactly what&#39;s the problem \nwith this text.\n\nThanks,\n\n--\nC E Z\n\n\n"
