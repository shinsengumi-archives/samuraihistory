I&#39;ve been told \nthat there is some influe=\r\nnce in modern politics based on Samurai \nbloodlines.  Most of these familie=\r\ns still use the Mon that their \nSamurai ancestors used.  But as Nate said, =\r\nthe class is extinct! Even \nthough we may still see some of its influence i=\r\nn modern Japan, a \nNihonjin(or any other person) cannot belong to a class t=\r\nhat does not \nexist.  So, let me sum up.  No, they cannot still consider th=\r\nemselves \nSamurai.\n\nBrandon\n --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Michael=\r\n Lorimer &lt;\nmijalo_jp@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Thanbk you.\n&gt; So theoretically the desc=\r\nendants of the samurai class could \ntherefore still consider themselves to =\r\nbe samurai, although not with \na legal foundation, with the laws enacted du=\r\nring the Meiji \nRestoration being formulated by the winners, if not nessari=\r\nly/\nhypothetically those in the &#39;right&#39; ??\n&gt; Just a thought\n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Um, yes, you would, as he was bo=\r\nrn into the hereditary\n&gt; samurai class. It&#39;s a class, not a job description=\r\n. I\n&gt; could &quot;serve&quot; someone, and still not be a samurai if I\n&gt; wasn&#39;t a. bo=\r\nrn into it or b. in rare cases, promoted\n&gt; into it (i.e. the bakufu basical=\r\nly gives a declaration\n&gt; that such and such person is now a member of the\n&gt;=\r\n samurai class, and as such has all responsibilities\n&gt; and duties associate=\r\nd, and so and so&#39;s descendants\n&gt; shall be samurai, etc.). \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n-- Michael Lorimer wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Quite so. \n&gt; &gt; The term &#39;samurai&#39; does not re=\r\ngard simply to those\n&gt; &gt; men (and some women) who trained with, and deploye=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; their swords. The word comes from the kanji meaning\n&gt; &gt; literally &#39;to=\r\n serve&#39;, whether it was the Emperor, a\n&gt; &gt; daimyo, or even one of the equal=\r\nly mighty temples. \n&gt; &gt; However, upon this point of &#39;to serve&#39;, would you\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; classify the likes of the Miyamoto Musashi as a\n&gt; &gt; &#39;samurai&#39; since his =\r\ncarrer with the sword was one\n&gt; &gt; essentially without a master?? \n&gt; &gt; M.Lor=\r\nimer\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate Ledbetter wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Mark Arsenault wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSpecifically, the term &quot;samurai&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not synonymous with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;sword=\r\nsman&quot; or &quot;one who tries to adhere to\n&gt; &gt; Bushido&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or anything similar=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai were a caste, and one that no longer\n&gt; &gt; exists.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So =\r\nin the strict \n&gt; &gt; &gt; definition of the term, one cannot &quot;become&quot; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sa=\r\nmurai any more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Point of fact, if you told you&#39;re average Japanese=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; person you were a &quot;samurai&quot;, you&#39;d have them\n&gt; &gt; laughing\n&gt; &gt; until ne=\r\nxt week.
