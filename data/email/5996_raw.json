The point is that it was\ndeveloped by peasants, not samurai, because the\npeasants had no weapons. What works against an armed\nsamurai would be effective against an unarmed\nassailant also, no? The original poster was asking\nabout samurai influence on unarmed martial arts forms.\n\n*********Kewl. I wanted to check my understanding because I have heard the &#39;karate was developed as a defense against the samurai&#39; \nmany many times.  *******\n\nRather than being primary developers, they were\nprimary antagonists. (And now some &quot;expert&quot; will come\nin and assail me because unarmed techniques that were\nthe forerunners of Juujitsu, etc., were developed way\nback when for use if you lost your sword, or\nsomething. True. But the point is not the\ndetails--it&#39;s that for the most part, the samurai\nweren&#39;t injecting some mystical bushido into karate.)\n\n********* Might it be that the karateka were trying to assimilate what they understood as bushido into their own practice? *****\n\n\n And if they can&#39;t\nhandle their misconceptions being challenged, that&#39;s\nwhen the compassion tends to slip.\n\n******* Beginner&#39;s mind, I think, is best.  It took a long time for me to learn just to do nothing. So simple, and soooooo much \npractice needed, lol.****** Yes, I slip up, especially when I get blind-sided by those &#39;hormonal surges&#39;. Don&#39;t like the taste of \ncrow pie, either, when it turns out I am in error. ****\n\n\nMyself also. The Lord High Listmaster and myself (I am\nonly his trusty minion, with a very minor fief in an\noutlying area of the list) are working on a new rules\nlist, and one of those is a request that everyone, oh,\nI don&#39;t know, USE PUNCTUATION? It&#39;s one thing if\nEnglish is not your primary language--I can make\nallowances for that. However there are many posters on\nthis list who are not native English speakers and\nstill can make themselves intelligible. They use\npunctuation in most other languages, and it varies\nlittle.\n\n******** Improper grammar and poor spelling out of ignorance is trainable. Effective but improper grammar and poor spelling in the \npursuit of fiction writing is an art.  Deliberate improper grammar and spelling to be hip, kewl, or defiant is lazy and is \ndemonstrative (to me) of someone who is indeserving of my attention and intelligence.  I try to steer my path clear of that type and \nnot waste my energy. I do have my own ways of being obstreperous.*****\n\n&gt; Just for the h-e-double-hockey-sticks of it..... how\n&gt; many of you &#39;play&#39; in the Society for Creative\n&gt; Anachronism......  if you do, do\n&gt; you pursue &#39;European&#39; or &#39;Asian/Japanese personas?\n&gt; (No, lol, I don&#39;t mean as in &#39;chase&#39; them...)\n\nI think many do, and many do both Asian and European\npersonae. Talk to Tony--he&#39;s the grand Poobah when it\ncomes to Japanese SCA.\n\nNate\n\n*****Aye, that GPB is quite knowledgeable, and a hoot when he is having a good day.  I finally got my firweall settings to where \nmore of the information on his site will display on my screen.\n\n\nI like finding how others approach the subject of this list, their backgrounds and perspectives, and educations in academia & real \nworld experiences.  I am a snob enough to admit that I don&#39;t like the trend of game-related posts, but you and the LHM are the boss \na&#39; that.  I just try to ignore them.\n\nI understand you are in Tokyo.....   would I show my impertinent curiosity again to inquire as to how you got there (not \ntransportation) , what you do, and how you find the daily life?   What do you like best?\n\nSleepily,\n\nLizzie\nstuck in Minneapolis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.803 / Virus Database: 546 - Release Date: 11/30/2004 \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
