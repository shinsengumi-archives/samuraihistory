In other words, only what is inserted into a &quot;Language System&quot;,\nshared by other people (which are, in turn, language objects by themselves),\nis real.\n\nLanguage, in this sense, does not need being verbal, but, e.g., the\nchemical-eletric relay between body cells creates a system of its own, which\nhas contact points with other language systems.\n\nIn short, a word does not point to an object, but, instead, points to\nanother word (or language object).\n\nIn view of the hereinabove, the usage of the word &quot;Samurai&quot; needs\nclarification, i.e., it needs to point out the boundaries which fill it with\na sense.\n\nTherefore, considering &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;law&quot; to be qualified systems of\nlanguage (as they require a special procedure and due person to &quot;say&quot;\nsomething valid), the insertion on the concept of &quot;Samurai&quot; (as class, not\nin the social sense, but as an open framework) depended on how the rulers of\nthat time set the related definition.\n\nAccording to the &quot;samurai-archives&quot; website, three bills tending to abolish\nthe &quot;Samurai&quot; were passed (that is, removing them from a particular language\nsystem), which were &quot;the Five Oaths Act&quot;, the &quot;Sword Wearing Forbiddance\nAct&quot;, and another one, which I will certainly recall later.\n\nWould this have dissolved the &quot;Samurai&quot;? Does &quot;Samurai&quot; exists only on other\nlanguage systems (such as the Historic System, which tries to recreate past\nlanguage on present language) than the qualified ones, thus rendering the\nexpression &quot;modern Samurai&quot; incorrect?\n\nThese are brief considerations, which I hope will add positively to the\nsubjects addressed in this forum.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nThiago\n\np.s.: Once I mananged to read the &quot;Sun&quot; post related on prior messages\n(&quot;modern Samurai&quot;), I tried to retrieve legistative references pertaining to\nthe re-comission or installment of &quot;Samurais&quot;, but to no avail so far.\n\n\n  -----Mensagem original-----\n  De: Cesare Polenghi [mailto:cepo@...]\n  Enviada em: sabado, 31 de janeiro de 2004 01:17\n  Para: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Assunto: Re: [samuraihistory] Hi!\n\n\n\n  On Jan 30, 2004, at 2:39 AM, Edward Alexander wrote:\n\n  &gt; Thanks.I have got some new books to read!!!!But i can&#39;t find the Book\n  &gt; of Five Rings.I have looked everywhere!!!!!!!!!!NOTHING!!!!!!!!Think\n  &gt; i&#39;ll have to buy it online...Edy\n  &gt;\n\n  Sure. Only the ones below are all &#39;manuals&#39; that glorify the samurai\n  ideals. For what samurai ***actually*** were, try something like\n  &quot;Heavenly Warriors,&quot; by Farris; or &quot;Musui Story,&quot; a biography, by\n  Katsu. Other good texts are &quot;Warlords, Artists, and Commoners,&quot;  by\n  Elison & Smith; and &quot;The Taming of the Samurai,&quot; by Ikegami. &lt;-note,\n  apart from Musui Story these are all academic works.\n  bye\n  cepo\n\n  &gt; jacob gerhard &lt;madbearscave@...&gt; wrote:Hey Steve,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Here some book titles for ya.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot;Code of the Samurai: AModern Translation of Bushido\n  &gt; Shoshinshu of Taira Shigesuke&quot; by Thomas Cleary\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot;Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai&quot; by Yamamoto\n  &gt; Tsunetomo and translated by William Scott Wilson\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot;Book of the Five Rings&quot; by Miyamoto Musashi, various\n  &gt; translations\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Hope this helps.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Jake\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---\n\n\n        Yahoo!
