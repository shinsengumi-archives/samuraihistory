I don&#39;t think the question was &quot;what is it called when a Samurai stops being a Samurai&quot;.... \n\n&gt;&gt;Well, historically, retired folk were &quot;inkyo&quot; but that&#39;s not anything \nparticularly &quot;samurai&quot; related.\n\nSamurai was a (hereditary) social status, like the class of the hereditary \nknightly class in Europe -- it wasn&#39;t a job. You don&#39;t retire from a social \nclass. You die.\n\nTony\n\n"
