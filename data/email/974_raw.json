It is about one of the most famous swordsmen of all time in Japan. Miyamoto Musashi, the inventor of the Nitenryu sword style which used both katana and wakizashi as weapons, which, as you can guess, was very controversial. It is a historical fiction and tells a good story. I recommend it to anyone interested in Japanese samurai and history.\n\n    As a side question, how many of you have read the Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi? I am just interested to know.\n\nCompassion go with you,\n\n    ~Sasaki Kojiro~\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: squrpio_prince \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, July 22, 2002 10:58 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Musashi By Eiji Yoshikawa\n\n\n  IS it any good? I am currently reading Taiko and I think that it is a \n  great novel of JApanese arts. I like the author and would like to \n  know about Musashi before I read it. What is it about?\n\n\n        Yahoo!
