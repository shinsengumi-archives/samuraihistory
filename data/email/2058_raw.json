Was he a great general who got done what \nwas needed? Or was he a brutal war monger?  Did he realize the need \nto unify Japan? Or was he just power-hungry?\n\nPersonally i think Nobunaga was a great visonary who saw the need, \nand had the will, to unify Japan. And although some of his tactics \nmight have been considered brutal, Mount Hiei for example, in the \nlong run it presevered life.  By committing one big act of violence, \nsuch as Mount Hiei, it sent a message to any other warrior-monks or \nsamurai clans that might have been thinking of attacking the Oda. It \nshowed the consequences of messing with the Oda. \n\nI also think that if Nobunaga wasn&#39;t betrayed by Akechi Mitsuhide, \nhe would have been successful in uniting Japan. Which would have \nushered in centuries of peace not seen until 18 years later under \nthe Tokugawa Shogunate.\n\n\n"
