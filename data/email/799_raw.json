What Brand had to say\n  &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t at all stupid and it is very possible that he&#39;s\n  &gt; &gt; correct.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Did I say it was stupid? I said it&#39;s not a name.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;&quot;Kami&quot; means &quot;god&quot; or &quot;deity&quot; specifically, not &quot;the spirit of something.&quot;\n  &gt;So first of all, it&#39;s impossible for &quot;Torakami&quot; to means &quot;spirit of the\n  &gt;tiger.&quot; If anything, it would be &quot;tiger god.&quot;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; As far as my name goes, there is nothing odd\n  &gt; &gt; about it and it is very much a Japanese name that was\n  &gt; &gt; given to me by my great-grandmother who happened to be\n  &gt; &gt; Japanese, which goes to show that you&#39;re not as much\n  &gt; &gt; an authority as you seem to give yourself credit for\n  &gt; &gt; being.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Then perhaps you will recall that my exact words were &quot;Without the kanji, \n  &gt;it\n  &gt;would be impossible. Frankly &quot;Taneiko&quot; doesn&#39;t sound typically Japanese to\n  &gt;me. Taneko would, but Taneiko... something seems odd.&quot;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Well, here goes.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Women&#39;s names using &quot;-ko&quot; endings are typically one kanji (haru, yuki, \n  &gt;hana)\n  &gt;plus the finishing &quot;-ko.&quot; There is *no* kanji that has &quot;tamei&quot; as a \n  &gt;reading.\n  &gt;To get to &quot;tanei&quot; you need two kanji (or more) to produce tane+i, or \n  &gt;ta+nei,\n  &gt;or ta+ne+i (the last one, meaning a four kanji name, is statistically\n  &gt;improbable. Therefore we&#39;re stuck with &quot;tane+i&quot; or &quot;ta+nei.&quot; Since there \n  &gt;few\n  &gt;kanji with the reading &quot;nei&quot;, but not often seen in names, we&#39;re\n  &gt;functionally limited, then to &quot;tane+i&quot;, which produces the question, which\n  &gt;kanji combination would allow a (positive meaning) name combining the\n  &gt;syllables tane+i+ko?\n  &gt;\n  &gt;There are a few names that are listed in my books with the reading &quot;Taneko&quot;\n  &gt;(no &quot;i&quot;) -- one &quot;tane&quot; meaning &quot;seed/kernel&quot; and the other meaning\n  &gt;&quot;egg/seed&quot; or &quot;sincerity.&quot; There is a third &quot;tane&quot; which pops up in names \n  &gt;--\n  &gt;&quot;issue/offspring&quot; -- but it&#39;s very unusual these days.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;So what we have is a very improbably Tane*i*ko, but a very probable Tane[no\n  &gt;*i*]ko.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Now, it&#39;s possible that whoever Romanized the name added the &quot;i&quot; to make\n  &gt;sure people would pronounce it properly (like the errant &quot;y&quot; that sometimes\n  &gt;pops up in Ma[y]eda and U[y]eda. These variant readings are common, \n  &gt;however.\n  &gt;Taneiko is not. Therefore, again, we&#39;re back to &quot;either the name is Taneko\n  &gt;and someone mis-Romanized it&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not a typical Japanese name.&quot;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Do you find a flaw with the argument or with the [original] conclusion?\n  &gt;\n  &gt;For the record, Japanese onomastics, especially historical onomastics, is a\n  &gt;field I study, and I study it seriously.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Before you get all huffy, perhaps you should consider that some people *do*\n  &gt;know more than you do.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Tony\n  &gt;\n\n\n  _________________________________________________________________\n  MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \n  http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
