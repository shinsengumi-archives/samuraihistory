They still let those guys do Jidai Geki?? I\n&gt; would have \n&gt; thought after KimuTaku played Oda Nobunaga, they\n&gt; would have been \n&gt; banned from Jidai Geki for eternity. Or should be.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For a synopsis of the first few episodes try here\n&gt; &gt; http://www.nhk-jn.co.jp/wp/best_e.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
