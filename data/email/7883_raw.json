I&#39;m not a history expert. But from what I&#39;ve read and seen, it\nseems that the Tokugawa shogunate was one of the most effective\nauthoritarian governments that ever existed. It survived for 250+ years. One\nof the ways it survived was in &quot;taming&quot; the samurai class, once there were\nno longer any wars. The daimyo were &quot;tamed&quot; by the system of every other\nyear having to live in Edo and his wife and children basically being kept\nhostage there. The &quot;common&quot; ordinary retainers were &quot;tamed&quot; by instituting\ncodes of conduct that emphasized an interpretation of Confucian thought\nwhere serving the bakufu was what a &quot;superior man&quot; must do. The bakufu\nappears to have discouraged self-reliance and even discouraged service to\none&#39;s daimyo unless it also meant service to the bakufu. As you said,\nsayings such as &quot;the sword is the soul of the samurai&quot; were used to shift\nthe emphasis away from the samurai as an individual toward having the\nsamurai subsume his individuality to serve the best interests of the\nTokugawa state. \n\nThe huge &quot;sword of Damocles&quot; that the Tokugawa shogunate held over the\ndaimyo and their retainers was the threat of clan abolishment, where the\nfate of the clansmen was either seppuku (mostly for the daimyo and higher\nofficials) or for retainers, being thrust into the essentially non-person\nstatus of ronin. \n\nNina  \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Thomas Davidson\nSent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 1:00 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] The &#39;Image&#39; of the Samurai\n\n[snips]\n\nI wonder, however - if Ieyasu could have done away with the sammurai after\nthe bakafu was safely established - would he have done so?\n\nTo me &#39;the sword is the soul of the samurai&#39; shifts the emphasis away from\nthe man, and is all part of the &#39;cult of the Tokugawa&#39; in that the man now\nhas something to live up to outside of himself - and the person he should\naspire to be was founded on Confucian ethic of service to the state. -\nprecisely because the Tokugawa did not want a military class with such a\nstrong sense of self-determination and self-reliance.\n\nThus the occasions when samurai were brought before the court for acting\n&#39;properly&#39; - the instant redress of perceived offence - always put the\nbakafu in a difficult position - they wanted a samurai bound by his code of\nhonour, but they were stuck then when he acted without asking their\npermission first.\n\nJust a personal view, but it seems to me the bakafu always &#39;fudged&#39; the\nissue when faced with the question of self-determination v subjugation to\nthe state.\n\nJust some thoughts...\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
