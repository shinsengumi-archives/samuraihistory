And a lot (all?) is written in non cursive \n&gt;characters and \n&gt;therefore should be fairly easily translated into English.\n\nAnders,\nIt&#39;s a shame that the auction site doesn&#39;t show the cover, or give \nthe title and author&#39;s name in Japanese. That would make it a lot \neasier to look into this manuscript.\n\nJust to note - the price is listed as 80 _British pounds_, not 80 US \ndollars. That would make it about 150 US dollars.\n\n&gt;Anybody have an idea of who the author /samurai Teijo could be? \n\nSorry - not me. There was a relatively recent haiku poet named \nNakamura Teijo \u001b$BCfB&lt;Du=w\u001b(B but it&#39;s certainly not the same person. :)\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
