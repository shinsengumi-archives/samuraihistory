I am considering\n(seriously consid=\r\nering) publishing a quarterly Japanese history\njournal. The main issue to a=\r\nddress, aside from wondering if anyone\nwould even want to buy it, is, I wou=\r\nld need to gather enough articles\nto constitute a bi-yearly or quarterly jo=\r\nurnal.  So these are the\ninitial questions:\n\n1. If the S-A published a hist=\r\nory journal (actual paperback high\nquality books), with 4-6 articles, proba=\r\nbly totalling 80-120 pages,\nwould you consider buying/subscribing?\n2. Is th=\r\nere anyone who would be interested in actually contributing\narticles? (I wo=\r\nuld have a set of requirements TBD)\n\nAll of the details are TBD (To Be Deci=\r\nded), I&#39;m just testing the\nwaters here. I would aim for between 8-16 articl=\r\nes a year (the number\nof articles would determine the number of issues) and=\r\n would set an\nestimated target of between 25-60 pages per article, and an a=\r\nssortment\nof other requirements. Basically it would be in official book for=\r\nm,\nwith issues available to purchase online via amazon.com,\nbarnesandnoble.=\r\ncom etc., or if I decide to offer a subscription, it\nwould be available for=\r\n a discount.\n\nSo, thoughts?\n\n\n"
