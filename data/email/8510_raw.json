There&#39;s\nrank, yes, but that&#39;s SOCI=\r\nAL rank, not military rank.\nIt&#39;s the critical division between HAVING rank =\r\n(e.g.,\na duke, a baron, a flunky) and HOLDING rank (e.g., a\ngeneral, a capt=\r\nain, a PFC).\n\nThe historical samurai army was a FEUDAL army, not a\nmodern o=\r\nne with rank structures in place. As a friend\nof mine [that would be me--lt=\r\n] once pointed out, you\ndon&#39;t &quot;join&quot; a samurai army as an &quot;ashigaru 2nd cla=\r\nss&quot;\nand work your way up to &quot;1st samurai.&quot;\n\nAs a feudal structure, the army=\r\n was vertical;\nauthority went up and down within the specific clan or\nallia=\r\nnce affiliation.\n\nThe basic &quot;rank&quot; was taisho(which can be translated\nvario=\r\nusly as general, lieutenant, captain, commander,\netc.). Essentially, a tais=\r\nho commands a body of men.\nPeriod. It depends on his relationship with othe=\r\nrs as\nhow you define it. For example, on his own, you can\ncall Honda Tadaka=\r\ntsu a great general. But in terms of\nhis relationship to Tokugawa Ieyasu, h=\r\ne would be\ntypically called &quot;one of Ieyasu&#39;s best generals,&quot; &quot;one\nof Ieyasu=\r\n&#39;s best lieutenants,&quot; or &quot;one of Ieyasu&#39;s\nbest captains.&quot; All of those refe=\r\nr to the JOBS\n(generals command, and captains and lieutenants lead\nbut serv=\r\ne UNDER someone else), not to ranks.\n\nI think people would generally be sur=\r\nprised at how\nmodern the concept of rank-structure in armies is.\nActually, =\r\nthe Romans were very rank/office set with\nthe way they did their legions (t=\r\nhe first modern\narmies, afterall), and after them it was centuries\nbefore a=\r\nnything like it was recreated. I think that it\nmight be a factor of the &quot;eq=\r\nuality&quot; of a republican\nform of government that created that modern army, a=\r\ns\nit was certainly not a typical feudal structurelike\nthat which pervaded E=\r\nurope from the Normans on, until\nGustav Adolphus&#39; &quot;new model army&quot; -- and e=\r\nven then it\nwas looser than we think of ranks today.\n\nThere&#39;s no denying th=\r\nat the chef outranks a busboy.\nBut neither chef nor busboy are ranks. They =\r\nare jobs\nand positions. The chef is, however, very important\nand gets to te=\r\nll people what to do. And busboys are\nlow-boy on the totem pole. It&#39;s like =\r\nsaying &quot;would you\nagree that the king outranks a knight.&quot; Well, duh.\nKing a=\r\nnd knight aren&#39;t &quot;ranks&quot; either, precisely\nspeaking, but the relationship o=\r\nf their roles is clear\nenough.\n\nBut those aren&#39;t ranks. They&#39;re JOBS. There=\r\n&#39;s a\ndifference, and it&#39;s a fairly critical one. Ranks tend\nto have a consi=\r\nstency. A lieutenant always has\nX-number of people under him, a major X-num=\r\nber of\npeople, a general X-number and so on. A taisho can\nhave 50, 500, or =\r\n5,000.\n\nThe most basic level of &quot;rank&quot; -- that of kashira or\ntaicho -- does=\r\nn&#39;t even have a specific number of\ntroops to be led. It depends on the army=\r\n makeup. A\ntaicho (lit. &quot;group-chief&quot;) can have five people or 50\nunder him=\r\n, depending on the job and the specific\nassignment. In modern army terms, t=\r\nhat could be\nanything from a squad to a company to a platoon.\n\nAnd, unlike =\r\nthe modern army, once appointed &quot;ashigaru\ntaicho&quot; one could just as quickly=\r\n be removed from that\nposition. While such assignments are social\npromotion=\r\ns, they are not MILITARY promotions like to\nCorporal or Sgt. or Master Sgt,=\r\n etc.\n\nIn any feudally structured army, ALL positions and\nduties are held a=\r\nt the pleasure of the overlord in\nquestion. There is no way to say &quot;I&#39;m a f=\r\nirst\nsergeant, you can&#39;t make me a private without due\ncause and a court-ma=\r\nrtial.&quot; Even &quot;permanent&quot;\nappointments (such as that of a taicho) in a Japan=\r\nese\narmy were understood to be continued appointments that\ncould be withdra=\r\nwn at any time (or magnified with\nfurther postings) and not one&#39;s &quot;right&quot; t=\r\no the\nposition.\n\nThat&#39;s one reason I fight so hard to eliminate the use\nof =\r\n&quot;ranks&quot; when talking about a feudal Japanese army.\nOr, rather, when the ter=\r\nm is used, I try to keep it\nclearly a socio-political reference, or somethi=\r\nng\nimplying that someone HAS (as in &quot;a taisho outranks\nthe common footsoldi=\r\ner&quot;) but avoid using terms that\nimply a person HOLDS rank.&quot;\n\n\n_____________=\r\n_____________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
