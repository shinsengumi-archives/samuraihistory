Does she also hold samurai rank?\n\nGabs\n&gt;there can be no doubt that Blackthorne is Adams, plus a generous dollop \n&gt;of Clavell and a dash\n&gt;of Sean Connery to flavor the mix (Clavell wanted Connery to play \n&gt;Blatckthorne in the movie version).\n&gt;\n&gt;The Jesuits were implacably hostile to Adams and his co-religionists and \n&gt;never missed a chance\n&gt;to abuse them as pirates to Ieyasu and other Japanese authorities.   \n&gt;Adams probably returned\n&gt;the favor, although suspicion of the Jesuits and European colonial \n&gt;amibitions was prevalent among\n&gt;the Japanese military hierarchy,  going back to Hideyoshi and Nobunaga. \n&gt;  Far from being\n&gt;paranoid, these suspicions were grounded on genuine concerns and some \n&gt;knowledge of how\n&gt;the Spaniards had colonized many parts of the new world using religion \n&gt;as an advance guard for\n&gt;military conquest.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jan Joosten Lodensteyn was a Dutch contemporary of Adams who also became \n&gt;a favorite\n&gt;of Ieyasu.   It is not clear if he achieved samurai status, but he \n&gt;apparently had the right of\n&gt;audience with Ieyasu, a right normally granted only to daimyo and \n&gt;hatamoto samurai.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;---\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
