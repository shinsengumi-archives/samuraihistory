I will scan the map and put it in\nthe files section so that you and all who are interested may see it and\noffer their opinions and advice. I know that this seems like an awful lot of\nquestions for such a small engagement but it is fast turning out that the\nGempei Wars are becoming my favorite subject of study. Since starting\nTurnbull&#39;s book I have purchased a copy of &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; in two\nvolumes translated by Hiroshi Kitagawa and Bruce T. Tsuchida with a forward\nby Edward Seidensticker published by the University of Tokyo Press and a\ncopy of &quot;Yoshitsune&quot; translated by Helen Craig McCullough published by\nStanford University Press under the auspices of the Tokyo University Press.\nI read through &quot;Yoshitsune&quot; in one night! I could not put it down. No\ngreater tale of chivalrous valor and adventure has ever come out of any\nother time period including the knights of the roundtable! I will start &quot;The\nTale of the Heike&quot; when I finish Turnbull so please be prepared to put up\nwith more questions as I try to fully learn about and understand this most\nfascinating history.\n\nCheers\nBill M.\nhttp://www.russojapanesewar.com\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Oyakata [mailto:oyakata@...]\nSent: Tuesday, June 22, 2004 9:47 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Uji-kawa\n\n\nOn Tue, 22 Jun 2004 08:43:58 -0400, billm@...\u001b$B$5$s\u001b(B\nwrote in message &lt;125060-220046222124358925@...&gt;\n&gt;think that Turnbulls map was oriented correctly, north being to the top,\n&gt;but I am not quite sure as I am in the office right now. Jay does the\n&gt;initial map that you sent the link for tell you the orientation?\n&gt;Unfortunately I can not read very many Japanese characters so I am not sure\n&gt;if there is a compass designation on the map.\n\nThe map itself doesn&#39;t show the orientation, but I know from other\nmaps that it has north at the top.\n\nhttp://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/uji-web/map.html\n\nSince I&#39;m not seeing what you&#39;re seeing it&#39;s hard for me to comment on\nTurnbull&#39;s map. Do the two maps (Turnbull&#39;s and the above link)\nbasically match in orientation?\n\nThe Byou-dou-in is on the west bank of the Uji-kawa.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
