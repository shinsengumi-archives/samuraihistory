Long live the emperor. \nJapanese movie director extraordinaire Kurosawa, who died in 1998 at \nthe age of 88, has been a major player in the global movie market \nover the past few years, albeit posthumously. \n\nIn July, two production deals were inked with U.S. companies to make \nEnglish-language versions of Kurosawa classics, which helped put \nJapanese cinema on the world map. \n\nKurosawa has been hailed as one of the greatest filmmakers ever for \nhis tales of samurai, detectives, businessmen and petty bureaucrats \nthat struck at the heart of the human psyche and were steeped in \nambiguity. \n\nSince his death Kurosawa has landed screen credits for writing \nscripts for two new movies. \n\n&quot;There are a lot of people in Hollywood thinking of making their own \nversion of a Kurosawa classic,&quot; one U.S. movie executive said. \n\nThe recent deals that have been struck include a pact between \nHollywood&#39;s Harbor Light Entertainment and Kurosawa&#39;s movie \nproduction company to make a U.S. version of the Kurosawa \nclassic &quot;Rashomon.&quot; \n\nThe other deal is with a production company affiliated with acclaimed \ndirector and Kurosawa fan Martin Scorsese, which will do a remake of \nthe kidnapping thriller &quot;High and Low&quot; (Tengoku to Jigoku). \n\n&quot;We are looking to make a contemporary thriller set in mid- to small-\ntown America,&quot; Edwin Marshall of Harbor Light said of his company&#39;s \nplanned remake of &quot;Rashomon,&quot; which many critics call Kurosawa&#39;s most \nfamous work. \n\nMarshall lived in Japan and spent some time on the set with Kurosawa. \nHis partner Stuart Calcote is a Japan-hand who played a key role in \nlanding &quot;Rashomon&quot;. \n\nREVERENCE FOR THE MASTER \n\nMarshall said that Harbor Light is approaching their &quot;Rashomon&quot; \nremake with reverence to the movie whose title has become a catchword \nfor the inability to ever know the truth about a certain situation. \n\nHarbor Light scored the movie after lengthy discussions with \nKurosawa&#39;s son Hisao. The company is in talks with an Academy Award-\nnominated writer for the screenplay of the film they aim to produce \nfor about $40 million. \n\nKurosawa&#39;s &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1951) is set in medieval Japan and tells of \nthe rape of a nobleman&#39;s bride by a bandit. The point of view from \nthe movie is from the participants and a witness, and each character \nrecounts the incident in a way that shines favorable light on them. \n\nThe movie won the Grand Prix at the Venice International Film \nFestival, which was the first major international recognition ever \nachieved by a Japanese filmmaker. \n\nIn the other remake deal announced in July, entertainment trade paper \nVariety reported that Brazilian director Walter Salles, whose 1998 \nfilm &quot;Central Station&quot; was Oscar-nominated for best foreign-language \npicture, will remake &quot;High and Low&quot; after Kurosawa&#39;s production \ncompany willed the rights to the movie to Scorsese&#39;s Cappa \nProductions. \n\nDisney&#39;s Touchstone Pictures is thinking of making the movie but has \nyet to &quot;greenlight&quot; the project, it said. Cappa Production officials \nwere not immediately available for comment. \n\n&quot;I have a feeling that a lot of Kurosawa&#39;s movies will be remade over \ntime,&quot; acclaimed director Wayne Wang (&quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; and &quot;Smoke&quot; \ntold Reuters. \n\n&quot;A lot of people have not seen the originals and Americans are always \nlooking for good material to remake,&quot; Wang said, adding that he sees \na cycle brewing for Kurosawa remakes. \n\nKUROSAWA AND HOLLYWOOD \n\nThe interest in remaking Kurosawa is nothing new. \n\nKurosawa&#39;s &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) inspired the American \nWestern &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), which boosted the career of \nSteve McQueen. \n\nItalian director Sergio Leone made a version of Kurosawa&#39;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot; \n(1961) as the spaghetti Western &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;(1964), which \nhelped make Clint Eastwood a movie star. The movie was remade again \nin 1996 under the title &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; with Bruce Willis as the \nstar. \n\nKurosawa&#39;s historical spectacle &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; (1958) was \ncredited by George Lucas as an important source for &quot;Star Wars.&quot; \nAnd &quot;Rashomon&quot; had a Hollywood remake in the guise of a quickly \nforgotten Western called Outrage (1964), which had Paul Newman \nplaying the part of the bandit. \n\nKurosawa also borrowed from western classics with movies such as 1985 \nfeudal Japan war tale &quot;Ran&quot;, which was based on William Shakespeare&#39;s \nplay &quot;King Lear&quot;. \n\nIn his native Japan, where Kurosawa toiled as a fringe figure in the \nmovie industry for years despite his international fame, Kurosawa \nscripts became a hot property after his death. \n\nJapanese studio Nikkatsu produced a movie about a sword-slinging \ngangster based on a screenplay by Kurosawa and Keisuke Kinoshita \ncalled &quot;Dora Heita&quot;, which came out about a year ago. \n\nKurosawa&#39;s production company took a screenplay from the great \nJapanese director that had not been filmed to make the movie &quot;Ame \nAgaru&quot; (After the Rain). The movie is about a samurai trying to find \nwork in changing times and came from a screenplay from Kurosawa with \nhis directorial notes. \n\nKurosawa planned to shoot the movie a few years ago, but illness \nprevented him from starting the film. \n\n&quot;What I hope for more than anything else is that Kurosawa&#39;s genius \nwill continue to influence the industry,&quot; U.S. &quot;Rashomon&quot; producer \nMarshall said. \n\n\n\n\n"
