He\nset himself (through ambition or just sheer consequence), and eventually\nJapan upon the route to unification. His control was far more effectual than\nthat imposed four centuries earlier by either Taira no Kiyomori or Minamoto\nno Yoritomo, but like these earlier examples, his control was only over the\ncentral island of Honshu, not Kyushu, Shikoku, Chugoku (although that was\nunder way at the time of his death), Tohoku or Hokkaido. Although more\nsignificant than Toyotomi Hideyoshi in what he established, it is Hideyoshi\nwho brought the bulk of the archipelago under a central administration and\nwas e facto unifier, although it was Nobunaga or set the work in motion and\nundertook much of the hard labour (smashing the Ikko ikki, the Enryakuji,\nthe Imagawa, the Takeda, &c) that made the work of Toyotomi and the Tokugawa\nconsiderably easier.\nM.Lorimer\n\nOyakata &lt;oyakata@...&gt; wrote:\nKitsuno�����&lt;c4prc9+39l6@...&gt;����\n&gt;Well, since a concequence of his actions led to more and more\n&gt;territory falling under his control, I think by default Nobunaga is\n&gt;a &#39;unifier&#39;...\n&gt;\nIt&#39;s probably right to say that he was &quot;a&quot; unifyer, since he took seve\nral regions that had been under the control of various people and\nunified them under his control.\n\nBut sometimes Nobunaga is referred to as &quot;the&quot; unifier implying that\nhe succeeded in pulling all of Japan under his rule.
