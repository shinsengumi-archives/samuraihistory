Satsuma being the most well known of \nsuch rebellions. \n\nYet, with the noteable acception of Musashi, of which i am still \ntrying to find historical evidance of his existance, there are very \nfew bushi of note during the Tokugawa peace.\n\npersonaly I have found that many of the myths and movies, that have \nfed off those myths tend to show much of the life during the Peace, \nbeing the one on one battles in forests and along roads. \n\nNot to say that popular and interisting bushi didn&#39;t arise out of \nsuch era, it is more that they really had no way to get any sort of \nrecognition, due to the overall lack of major battles during the \nPeace.\n\n-Atsi\n\n\n\n"
