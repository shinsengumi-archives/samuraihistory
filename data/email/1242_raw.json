I do not read, speak, or otherwise comprehend Japanese, but \nI am enamoured of the &quot;Samurai Period&quot;. I can&#39;t say exaclty what got me \ninterested in Feudal Japan, but I fed that love with the films of Kurosawa, the \nLone Wolf and Cub manga, and whatever else I could find.  \nAn Asain history professor loaned me a book in College and I was wondering if \nanyone recognizes it.  It was basically the diary of a rapscallion Samurai in \nthe Edo period.  He is constantly running out of money, luck, and friends.  I \nremember thinking that he was utterly charming on paper, but that I would&#39;t want \nhim as a friend.  Does this sound familiar to anyone.  \n\nThanks,\nRaphael in T\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
