If there is any way you can leave your dog with your parents or siblings or friend, anything would be better.

Im moving to hokkaido in about a year and I need to know about bringing my dog with me. its not too big of a dog. are they generally banned from apartments there? since Im moving to a more rural area do I have anything to worry about? hopefully my wife and I will be going with the JET program (Japanese English Teachers) does anyone have any experience with them? thanks for any information.. plz mail me off the list.. thank you..\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
