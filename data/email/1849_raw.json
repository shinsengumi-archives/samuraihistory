My point is that social protocol from you might be different then what it is from me.  So how do disagreements get worked out.  If there is no moral bases for us both to live by, then we both can live however we chose, and not be responsible to anyone or anything because we live according to our own needs, wants, culture, up bringing, whatever.  Your logic is flawed, you state that there is a social protocol we must adhere too in one statement, and then you go on to state that each culture has its own standard by which to live by.  So I guess in your logic I (being a country) can invade you (being another country) for reason that are only believed or adhered too by my country and be in the right.  Or I being a thief can invade your house and still money and say that society did it to me, I need to steal to survive, and not get punished.  Thank God there is a an ultimate moral truth or there would be complete anarchy.\n\nHow are the world wars an example of the moral codes being bent.  They where unjust acts that where wrong.  Simple as that, it doesnt take rocket science to figure out that killing millions of people is evil.  \n\nThe commandment is Thou shall not murder.\n\nIts always easier to do evil then good, and people are by nature going to do wrong before they do good.  But then again according to your logic there is no good or evil because we all have different opinions.  \n\nRegards,\nGreg Quaresma\n\ngquaresma@...\n  \n\n\n"
