Seeing battle lines are being drawn up I had better take up my po=\r\nsition on the defences!!\n\nStephen Turnbull&#39;s books have done more to popula=\r\nrise the military history of the samurai and Japan in the western world tha=\r\nn any other author.  Whilst I would agree with some, and I do make some cri=\r\ntisism at times, that his work is not perhaps 100% academic, contains some =\r\nerrors and does suffer from a degree of repetition, it has never the less p=\r\nrovided a firm foundation over the past 25 years for the &quot;samurai enthusias=\r\nts&quot;.\n\nStephen had an interest in Japan and the Far East from his early days=\r\n and this no doubt helped him in his studies at Cambridge University and ob=\r\ntaining a Doctorate from Leeds with his thesis on the Hidden Christians of =\r\nJapan. He has ben a member of the Japan Society for many years and is curre=\r\nntly an Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of East Asian Studies at=\r\n the University of Leeds.  So on one point a small correction, he is associ=\r\nated with a great university..  He is also associated with the Samurai Gall=\r\nery of the UK National Armouries and has acted as consultant to the BBC, Th=\r\ne History Channel and &quot;Shogun&quot; anmongst others...\n\nI first met Stephen in t=\r\nhe early seventies when he and I were both members of the North Cheshire Mi=\r\nlitary Modelling Society, there his infectious enthusiasm for the topic mad=\r\ne me a convert. We still occassionally bump into each other up and down the=\r\n country. His first book on the samurai published in 1977, &quot;The Samurai: A =\r\nMilitary History&quot; was a mammoth task for those days and ignited a thirst fo=\r\nr knowledge on the subject in the UK .\n\nMy own reasonably extensive library=\r\n has over 20 Turnbull publications on various aspects of the samurai compet=\r\ning for space with books in japanese, german, french, italian and polish as=\r\n well as many others in english.  I have much respect for Stephen in that h=\r\ne &quot;put pen to paper&quot; and put &quot;his head above the parapet!&quot; (how&#39;s that for =\r\nmixed metaphors...). It is almost a standing joke between us that my book h=\r\nas yet to come to fruition - but then I am an engineer!  \n\nI would recommen=\r\nd that you view his website and perhaps obtain a couple of the books from a=\r\n library before you decide to purchase your first... I am presently making =\r\nmy way through the two great volumes of collected papers in his editorial w=\r\nork &quot;The Samurai Tradition&quot;  {published cost over =A3200} \n\n               =\r\n http://freespace.virgin.net/stephen.turnbull/publications.htm\n\nNow, as ano=\r\nther english author did say... &quot;let loose the dogs of war!&quot;\n\n              =\r\n          Rod Johnson  :-)\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cepoo=\r\nooo&quot; &lt;cepo@e...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; After studying premodern Japanese history for a =\r\nfew years through the texts of the \n&gt; classic American historians (Keene, V=\r\narley, Hall, etc.), I finally got me a couple of \n&gt; books from Stephen Turn=\r\nbull. While he is not associated with any great University, his \n&gt; work see=\r\nms to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is not an amazing writer ( imean; hi=\r\ns \n&gt; style), but he seems to be truly in love with the subject, and I reall=\r\ny like the way he \n&gt; fills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind of=\r\n (perhaps?) self-made scholarship \n&gt; is available. \n&gt; Since this is the fir=\r\nst time I write, I was wondering what you &quot;samurai-maniacs&quot; public \n&gt; think=\r\n of Turnbull in general.\n&gt; Any book you would suggest in particular?\n&gt; Than=\r\nx,\n&gt; cepo\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
