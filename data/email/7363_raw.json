I haven&#39;t found out all that much information but what I have found out seems comfusing. On Wikipedia it claims he died at the battle of Nagashino (it states the reference of this is Turnbulls Samurai Sourcebook&quot;. However on the Samurai Acrchives site, in the section on the Takeda generals, it claims he fought at Nagashino but was beheaded by Oda troops in Shinano province while fleeing the Takeda lands when Nobunaga invaded.\n \nI would appreciate it if someone could clear this up for me. Thanks a lot.\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nHow much free photo storage do you get? Store your holiday snaps for FREE with Yahoo! Photos. Get Yahoo!
