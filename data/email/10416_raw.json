I am also a teac=\r\nher and I teach US History at Roosevelt High School in Southern California,=\r\n part of LAUSD. Sixty of my students were invited to go to Manzanar (a form=\r\ner Japanese Internment Camp), on May 5th. \n\nThe great thing about this is t=\r\nhat our guide is a former Internee AND Roosevelt Alumni who was removed fro=\r\nm the school by soldiers back in 1942. This is a great opportunity for the =\r\nkids to hear eyewitness testimony from a former &quot;Rough Rider&quot; and Internee =\r\nabout life at the school and in the camps.\n\nOur Principal was not able to g=\r\net the district to provide a bus, and so we must raise the funds our self. =\r\nBeing an inner-city school this is no easy task, but I have been able to ra=\r\nise about 3/4 of what is needed, and I just need a little more to make this=\r\n trip possible. I can use some assistance=85\n\nSo I am going to have a sale =\r\non my supplements. Even if you do not play miniatures, the information in t=\r\nhese is most valuable to the person interested in samurai.  In fact, many b=\r\nuy my books just for the information and do not play my game.  They contain=\r\n information on Battles, with complete maps and Orders of Battle, uniform i=\r\nnformation, flags, and personality descriptions.  \n\nHidyoshi&#39;s Korean Invas=\r\nion is my latest work, and a product of over 10 years of research.  Kenneth=\r\n Swoop and Stephen Turnbull both provided assistance while writing the book=\r\n. It has information on the Armies the Ming, Choson, and Toyotomi that foug=\r\nht the war, including information on their uniforms, flags, organization, a=\r\nnd weapons.  There is several pages of illustrations showing the troops typ=\r\nes and flags.  There is also information on 10 of the major battles of the =\r\nconflict, each with a map and order of battle. \n\nThe other books deal with =\r\nparticular samurai clans.  Date&#39;s battles is the latest, and deals with Dat=\r\ne Masamune and his clan, complete with full-color plates depicting his troo=\r\nps and all his sashimono, plus information on two of his great battles.\n\nTh=\r\ne other books are older ones, like the Date book, but in black and white. T=\r\nhey are unbound versions.\n\nBelow is the items and sale prices:\n\nHideysohi&#39;s=\r\n Korean Invasion (normally $35 USD=85NOW $20.00 USD)\nDate&#39;s Battles (normal=\r\nly $25 USD=85NOW $10.00 USD)\nShimazu&#39;s Battles (normally $15 USD=85NOW $7.5=\r\n0 USD)\nMori&#39;s Battles (normally $15 USD=85NOW $7.50 USD)\nHideyoshi&#39;s Battle=\r\ns Battles (normally $15 USD=85NOW $7.50 USD)\nTokugawa&#39;s Battles (normally $=\r\n15 USD=85NOW $7.50 USD)\n\nShipping will be $5.90 USD for any amount of books=\r\n and they are limited to supply. The older supplements are almost sold out =\r\nnow.\n\nI&#39;ll have the sale until April 20th when I have to give my definite y=\r\nes/no &quot;go&quot; to the bus service.\n\nIf you are interested please contact me at =\r\nBBradford1973@...\n\nArrigato,\nBrian\n\n\n"
