One of his victims is a Filipino, named Lorenzo Ruiz, who travelled with Catholic priests, after escaping Spanish injustice back in the Philippines. \n \nLorenzo and his companions were caught doing Catholic missions in Japan. Before and during torture Ieyasu made an offer, &quot;renounce their faith and they wil be spared&quot;. The missionaries did not accept the offer except for one who was also killed later on.\n \nLorenzo and his group were tortured using water poured in their mouth using a funnel while torturers put a plank of wood on their stomachs as they see-sawed on in. Needles were stuck between the fingernails and the flesh. \n \nWhen no one gave up, Ieyasu ordered the missionaries to be hung upside down in separate wells. the wells&#39; mouth was then closed as the prisoners hung. Most of the group, including Lorenzo perished after ten days. They were taken out of the well, beheaded, burned, and their ashes scattered to the sea.\n \nLorenzo Ruiz was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the early 1980s for being a layman in a group of priests yet did not renounce his faith.\n \nHe is now known as Saint Lorenzo Ruiz after His cannonization in Vatican by the Pope in the the early 1990s.\n \nTokugawa Ieyasu really enforced his laws and policies. \n\nGillian Rubinstein &lt;gillian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone was OT it was me: but I think it&#39;s an interesting subject. \nYes, Lee Kwan Yew would make a dream shogun. And surely a \nphilosopher king (or queen) must be the all time best job. (But so many \npeople seem to mess it up. )\n&gt;\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n&gt; Forgive me for the OT; however you mentioned Lee Kwan Yew - one \nof my \n&gt; absolute idols. He has just enforced a law against obesity. (All \n&gt; overweight kids in Singapore need to exercise for 15 minutes during \n&gt; recess, and their calories intake at school is severely controlled). He \n&gt; would have been a dream Shogun (or Philosopher king).\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers, sorry again for the OT\n&gt; cepo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
