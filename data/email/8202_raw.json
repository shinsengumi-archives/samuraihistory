Yes I am aware of the great fire of 1657 I have found information o=\r\nn that part of the history but there were also fires during the late ninete=\r\nenth century one of them I believe occured in the year 1861. You see it has=\r\n much harder finding that sort of information but if you Nate or anyone els=\r\ne has or knows of where I can find that information I would be most gratefu=\r\nl.\n  Rod\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n  \n\n--- Rod Pavez &lt;grf=\r\nkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello everyone:\n&gt; Not long ago I posted a questi=\r\non about the fires in\n&gt; the Yoshiwara or \n&gt; pleasure quarter of the city of=\r\n Tokyo.
