Look, if Nobunaga hadn&#39;t died, \nthen he would have most likely--\nI DONT KNOW! If anyone knew then they&#39;d probably put down what it was, but \nthe issue at hand is that we don&#39;t know, i doubt that he kept a journal, \nand if he did, none of us have it. \n\nJust so. Asserting that things would have gone differently if they hadn&#39;t \ngone how they did is an empty point; stating HOW they would have gone \ndifferently (barring substantial evidence) is what&#39;s known in rhetoric as \n&quot;hypothesis contrary to fact.&quot; That kind of thing makes for some entertaining \n&quot;alternate timeline&quot; fiction, but not for particularly good academics.\n\n--R.M.B.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _\nUudessa IE8 selaimessa on uudet pikatoiminnot.\nhttp://www.microsof t.com/finland/ windows/products /winfamily/ ie/beta/default. mspx\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\t \t   \t\t  \n_________________________________________________________________\nWindows Liven avulla voit jakaa valokuviasi helposti.\nhttp://www.download.live.com/\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
