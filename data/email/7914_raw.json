Anyway. First of all to say that the\n&gt; history of christianity in the=\r\n samurai period begins\n&gt; with the arrival of Saint Francis Xavier to Kagosh=\r\nima\n&gt; at 1548, until the banning of christianity by Tokugawa\n&gt; at 1612. Onl=\r\ny 70 years. The first daimyo to be\n&gt; converted was Omura Sumitada, but befo=\r\nre this one,\n&gt; other daimyos had granted privileges to the catholic\n&gt; churc=\r\nh, if by nothing else, to get advantages in the\n&gt; commerce with Portugal. O=\r\nuchi is a clear example of\n&gt; that, the ever very merchantilistic ouchis.\n&gt; =\r\nOther daimyos received baptism, I think that all from\n&gt; jesuits hands. Thei=\r\nr major expansion was before the\n&gt; Sekigahara Battle. The christian daimyos=\r\n was a strong\n&gt; force in the council that ruled the country after\n&gt; Hideyos=\r\nhi`s death.\n&gt; Well, other people could say more thing... \n&gt; \n&gt; I had been w=\r\norking in an article about history of the\n&gt; catholic church in Japan, if yo=\r\nu are interested,\n&gt; although it is in spanish.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- samuraib8 &lt;samuraib=\r\n8@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am at a loss and I hope you can help.  I am\n&gt; &gt; loo=\r\nking for information \n&gt; &gt; on samurai that were Christians.  History, name o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; clans, crests, etc \n&gt; &gt; of the Christian movement.  I am looking for =\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; in-depth study on these \n&gt; &gt; particular samurai, who they were, what=\r\n they were\n&gt; &gt; called and wore.  \n&gt; &gt; Basically any good in-depth research.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I am at a loss, I hope you can help me.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for =\r\nany direction you can provide.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We fe=\r\nw, we happy few, we band of brothers;\n&gt; For he to-day that sheds his blood =\r\nwith me\n&gt; Shall be my brother; be he ne&#39;er so vile,\n&gt; This day shall gentle=\r\n his condition:\n&gt; And gentlemen in England now a-bed\n&gt; Shall think themselv=\r\nes accursed they were not here,\n&gt; And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any =\r\nspeaks\n&gt; That fought with us upon Saint Crispin&#39;s day.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ______=\r\n____________________________ \n&gt; Start your day with Yahoo! - Make it your h=\r\nome page! \n&gt; http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
