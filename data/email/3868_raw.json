I love Japan and I\n&gt;really love the culture I&#39;ve been reading about Samurai for sometime\n&gt;know and I found out quite a bit about the whole westernised Japan\n&gt;and stuff but I want to know MORE especially after seeing the\n&gt;movie... which I love no matter what anyone says! I think it was a\n&gt;really good depiction... if anyone wants to bitch about a really\n&gt;crappy movie involving Japan watch Lost In Translation! It the worst!\n&gt;Anyhoo.... hope someone can answer my question or help me out....\n&gt;ARIGATO!!!!!\n&gt;\nI believe the samurai in question is Saigo Takamori.  I could be wrong.  \nPlease correct me if I am.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDream of owning a home?
