The Uesugi print \nshows him facing forward on a stool, he has a mostache in this print.  It \nlooks rather basic, I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t describe it any better but it&#39;s \nbeen a long time since I&#39;ve seen a picture of it and don&#39;t remember the \ndetails.  The Takeda print shows him facing away on a deerskin stool looking \nat Mt. Fuji.  He&#39;s wearing a red cape.  If anyone knows where I could shop \nin this area, or point me to a webstore, I&#39;d appreciate it!\n\nChuck\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
