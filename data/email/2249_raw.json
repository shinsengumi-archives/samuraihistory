Several\npeople weighed in with their opinions of who it was\n(correct or incorrect), and those who were correct\ndidn&#39;t explain WHY. That&#39;s not helpful to those they\nare trying to correct. Regardless of if you could\nrecognize the armor/helmet, etc. IT&#39;S GOT THE GUY&#39;S\nFREAKING NAME ON IT!!\n\nI would think that even if you had no idea about\nJapanese history or Takeda Shingen, before you went\nhawking it you&#39;d at least try to get someone to\ntranslate the darn Japanese on it. \n\nNate\n--- Scott &lt;scottc_4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Even if you cannot read the Kanji one should easily\n&gt; be able to tell \n&gt; that is in fact Takeda Shingen.  There is no\n&gt; mistaking that very \n&gt; unique and very famous kabuto (helmet) of his.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
