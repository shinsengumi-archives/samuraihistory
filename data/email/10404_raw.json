Shr=\r\nine to the defeated Western Samurai near railway station. \n\nIntroduction \nJ=\r\napan in the 16th Century was torn apart by almost continuous civil war betw=\r\neen rival clans and\ntheir daimyo, or warlords, each\nseeking to establish a =\r\nmilitary governorship of the islands with the title =E2=80=98Shogun=E2=80=\r\n=99. \nRuling over them all was the\nsemi-divine Emperor, who legimitised tem=\r\nporal power by his presence, but took\nvery little part in day-to-day politi=\r\ncs. Some families by clever political\nintrigue had managed to elevate thems=\r\nelves to high status social rank, and\nestablish governorship over large are=\r\nas of Japan. By the later 16th century chief among these clan leaders were =\r\nOda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen,\nUesegi Kenshin, Toyotomi Hiyedoshi and Tokuga=\r\nwa Ieyasu. From 1573 onwards, Oda\nhad established control over most of the =\r\nislands, but was murdered in 1583 by\nrebellious followers. He was succeeded=\r\n by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who became ruler\nof most of the country and establi=\r\nshed his capital at Kyoto, with Osaka Castle\nas his chief fortress. On his =\r\ndeath in 1598 =C2=A0a regency for his infant son was established\nunder Toku=\r\ngawa Ieyasu, Maeda Toshiie, Uesegi Kagekatsu, Mori Terumoto and Ukita Hidei=\r\ne, each vying with the other\nfor supremacy. It was a poisonous mixture that=\r\n could only lead to further\nbloodshed.\nSoon Tokugawa Ieyasu had\nattracted b=\r\ny far the largest number of followers and tried to set himself up as\nheir t=\r\no the Hideyoshi shogunate on the death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599. Faced by\np=\r\notential risings on every quarter, Ieyasu left Osaka with the bulk of his\nt=\r\nroops to menace the Uesegi clan. His enemies gathered an enormous force of\n=\r\n128,000 men, mostly from the Western part of Japan, hence known as the =E2=\r\n=80=98Western\nArmy=E2=80=99. They camped around the pass of Sekigahara in O=\r\nctober 1600, east of\nKyoto, in order to try conclusions with the ambitious =\r\nIeyasu.\n\nThe Battle \nIeyasu had received intelligence of his enemy=E2=80=99=\r\ns intentions,\nand knew that Kobayakawa Hideaki was prepared to come over to=\r\n his side, along\nwith all his samurai and ashigaru,\nthe ordinary foot soldi=\r\ners. Early in the morning of 21 October Ieyasu=E2=80=99s forces\nmoved into =\r\nthe attack and after some delay Hideaki=E2=80=99s forces treacherously\njoin=\r\ned the general melee against his erstwhile allies.\nOutnumbered and outflank=\r\ned, Mitsunari fled and his troops\nsurrendered =E2=80=93 about 9,00had been =\r\nslaughtered on the field. Soon afterwards\nIeyasu was able to assume the reg=\r\nency, hunting down=C2=A0 Mitsunari and having him executed. Ieyasu set\nup h=\r\nis capital at Edo, the site of=C2=A0 modern Tokyo, and in 1603 was appointe=\r\nd Shogun by the emperor. Rivalry\nwith the Toyotomi clan brought further con=\r\nflict at Osaka in 1615, but the the\nTukugawa Shogunate remained in place an=\r\nd lasted after the death of Ieyasu until\n1867, overseeing a lengthy period =\r\nof peace and stability. Under the aegis of\nthe Tokugawa shoguns, the warrio=\r\nr elite of Japan turned their energies to less\nwarlike pursuits, becoming l=\r\noyal servants of the state.\n\nSekigahara Today \nThe Tokugawa camp is now the=\r\n site of a public park\nopposite the town=E2=80=99s museum, where there is a=\r\n significant collection of arms and\narmour from the time of the battle. Ext=\r\nensive battlefield trails exist for\nwalkers to explore the area, and the ke=\r\nssen-ba,\nthe site of the final denouement of the fighting, is marked by a s=\r\ntone obelisk.\nThe entire site can be viewed from Mount Sasao after a brisk =\r\nwalk, where Ishida\nhad his camp. Opposite here, the slopes of Mount Matsuo =\r\ngive a panoramic view\nof the battlefield from the point of view of Kobayaka=\r\nwa Hideyaki.\n\nSekigahara =E2=80=98Warland=E2=80=99 is a modern theme park n=\r\near the\nbattle field with plaster statues of various warriors in authentic =\r\nposes, and\nwhile this will not necessarily appeal to everyone, it does hous=\r\ne a very\nimpressive display of armour of the period.\n\n\n____________________=\r\n____________\n From: docwho499 &lt;docwho499@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@y=\r\nahoogroups.com \nSent: Saturday, 25 February 2012, 19:28\nSubject: RE: [samur=\r\naihistory] Any recommended battle tours in central Japan (&lt;2hr from Koyto )=\r\n??\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nAny recommended battle tours in central Japan (&lt;2hr from Koyt=\r\no )??\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text=\r\n portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
