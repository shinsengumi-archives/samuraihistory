As I recall, his combat\nhandgun work\n&gt; was rather well done.  So the weak sword style seemed a flaw that\nwas\n&gt; consistently in character.\n\nJust keep in mind the character he plays is INSANE, probably\nschizophrenic, and is not a &quot;modern Samurai&quot; except in his insanity.\n\n\n\tInteresting take on the character.\n\tInsane?  I certainly didn&#39;t see him as any more insane than anybody else\nengaged in that line of work.  (That is to say, a soldier for a mob family.)\nWhich, being a line of work with ancient and honourable feudal antecedents,\nwould scarcely seem to indicate insanity within the context of bushido -\nancient or modern.\n\tWhat&#39;s your reasoning on this?  By what measure is the Whittaker character\ninsane that would not find, say, the average highly-dedicated hanshi of the\nEdo period equally schizophrenic?\n\tMyself, I found admirable the clear-sighted honesty with which he\nrecognised the growing outcome of the whole little war, and the courage and\nintegrity with which he faced his own end.\n\n\tNote that I do not say I find his profession admirable - only the qualities\nI specified.  I don&#39;t choose to be put in the position of defending the\nprofession of hit-men, but I am always interested in people in the modern\nworld who are trying to live out the ancient codes.  I thought, and think,\nthat &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; presented that idea far better than most attempts made at\nthat theme.  In a cinematic climate of special effects, gimmicky ninja, bad\nswordplay presented as essential martial art, and a very imperfect grasp of\nthe difference between personal glory and personal honour, &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; stood\nout with well-drawn characters who remained true to themselves (for better\nor worse) throughout.\n\tSo I am most interested in your reasoning on the question of the\ncharacter&#39;s insanity.\n\t\tGereg\n\n\n\n"
