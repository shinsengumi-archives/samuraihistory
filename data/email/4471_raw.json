It also exists in some other \n&gt; &gt;&quot;pop&quot; kinds of entertainment. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;But in most Japanese sources, Nobunaga is not seen as a villain. \nHis \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;more over-the-top things that in our day and age are quite \nshocking, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;were even shocking when they happened. But the overall impression \n&gt; &gt;is =\r\nnot Nobunaga as villain, but for the most part, Nobunaga as \n&gt; &gt;heroic figu=\r\nre. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;-- \n&gt; &gt;Jay Kelly \n&gt; &gt;oyakata@O... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________=\r\n________________________________________\n&gt; Voce quer um iGMail protegido co=\r\nntra v=EDrus e spams? \n&gt; Clique aqui: http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\n&gt; O=\r\nfertas imperd=EDveis!
