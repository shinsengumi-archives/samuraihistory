I sadly was utterly uninterested in pre-modern history until\n1981, and before that I had been thoroughly put off the martial arts by\nthe whole &quot;ninja/kung fu&quot; craze. I finally woke up to history in that\nyear, but went off and delved in to European arms, armour, and sword\nplay etc. I only got bit by the samurai bug, in the very late eighties,\nwhen a friend in publishing offered me two cheap copies of H.Russell-\nRobinson&#39;s translations of &quot;The Armour Book of Honcho GunKiko&quot; (forgot\nthe correct spelling) and &quot;The Making of Helmets and Armour in Sixteenth\nCentury Japan&quot;, which I didn&#39;t even bother to pick up and read for six\nmonths! After that it was all down hill:-)\n\nSo, I&#39;m sure that everyone here will give you the support and knowledge\nthat you seek, just listen to what people here have to offer, believe me\nI&#39;ve found that it&#39;s well worth it. \n\nIMO the most important thing that you need to master, is the art of\ndiscriminating between fact and fantasy. The whole Japanese\nhistory/martial arts field is awash with loads of pure nonsense,\nperpetuated by films, TV and comics, and sadly quite a few people who\nshould know better! Mind you all studies of history suffers from this\nkind of a problem to one degree or another. I for one am for ever\nfighting against the &quot;chainmail&quot; demon whenever it raises its head.\n\nAnyway, good luck, especially with learning Japanese, you&#39;ll find it\ninvaluable, that&#39;s why I&#39;m still trying to do it!\n\nRegards\n\nDean\n\n\n"
