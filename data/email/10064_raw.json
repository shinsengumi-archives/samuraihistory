Its listed &quot;alphabetically,&quot; in the left column, by order of beginning phonetic sounds so its in the second-to-last group under &quot;ra&quot; (listed in romaji as &quot;I&quot; for some reason...). Alas, here the &quot;rokuro&quot; portion is written in hiragana. (BTW, for those with limited[...] or no Japanese reading ability, having google &quot;translate&quot; this page can be both moderately helpful AND amusing.)Next stop, Kanji DB.Here the only kanji combo with actual meaning is indeed (as Tony pointed out): \u001b$Bm&#92;m&#92;\u001b(B, &quot;potter&#39;s wheel;&quot; but also &quot;pulley,&quot; which I think seems a little more likely for this particular critter.The Obakemono Project lists rokurokubi with the hiragana just like at Yokai World. However, you&#39;ll notice the English subtitle under the name is indeed &quot;pulley neck.&quot;The last of my at-hand resources is the &quot;book&quot; &quot;Yokai Attack: The Japanese Monster Survival Guide&quot; by Hiroko Yoda and Matt Alt (a fruitful and amusing source for this subject). Here she is indeed listed as: \u001b$Bm&#92;m&#92;&lt;s\u001b(B, &quot;pulley (or perhaps &quot;potter&#39;s wheel&quot;...) neck.&quot; They include a list of English versions of the name such as: &quot;Long-neck Woman,&quot; &quot;Snake-necked Woman,&quot; &quot;Flying-head Woman,&quot; and &quot;Rubberneck Woman.&quot; They also interject that &quot;Some scholars believe: that the Rokuro Kubi is related to the Japanese idiom &#39;kubi wo nagakushite matsu.&#39; Although it colloquially means &#39;eagerly waiting for something,&#39; the literal translation is &#39;stretching one&#39;s neck out to wait.&#39;&quot;\nOne last personal, and doubtful, theory I just formulated upon reviewing the links provided is this: on the link to Kanji DB provided, the third listing you&#39;ll notice is \u001b$BO;O$;U\u001b(B. I&#39;m not sure why, but they don&#39;t include the &quot;shi&quot; sound for the final kanji (some more proficient at the language may be able to explain), but I find the combination of the first two characters interesting: &quot;roku&quot; (six) and &quot;ro&quot; (spine). Could this \u001b$BO$\u001b(B be what there are six of and essentially the unit of length you were inquiring about? So it&#39;d be \u001b$BO;O$&lt;s\u001b(B: &quot;Six-Spine-Neck?&quot;Probably not, but it&#39;s fun research anyway. (BTW, as I typed the hiragana into my Japanese IME program, the only meaningful selection I have available for rokurokubi IS in fact \u001b$B$m$/$m&lt;s\u001b(B, so this is likely the common contemporary writing, though it still could be derived from something more specific.)\nSorry for the lengthy post, but I though I&#39;d include several of the resources I use in such situations for your (and those with similar interests) future reference.It&#39;s also worth noting the forums at the Obakemono Project, though often tangental, CAN be resourceful as well. (As if this isn&#39;t tangental to samurai history...)I prefer the SA!... :P \t\t \t   \t\t  \n_________________________________________________________________\nYour E-mail and More On-the-Go.
