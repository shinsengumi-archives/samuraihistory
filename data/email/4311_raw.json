(Mine was once the \nproperty of the Imperial Naval Academy Library, but that was in another world).\n\nThe book details all the armour bits excavated from kofun up to 1944, when the \nbook was published. Moreover, the book is full of photos of the full-sized \nreproductions of the armour made by Suenaga.\n\nMost of the print run, as I understand it, was bombed out of existence, so this \nis a goldmine to find one here. If you&#39;re interested in pre-800 armour, you MUST \nhave this book.\n\nIt is E-bay auction item 3909701273. Check it out.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
