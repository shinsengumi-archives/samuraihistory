Obviously the closer you are to the centres of power, the more up\n&gt; to date your calendar, but if you&#39;re out in the sticks/mountains/islands\n&gt; etc...?\n\nThat wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all -- It took how many days for the US as a whole \nto find out about Lincoln&#39;s assassination? -- but at the heart of that issue was \na more basic question -- that there was, indeed, a Joky� 5 -- for almost ten \nmonths.\n\nIt was the same question that was driving everyone crazy in Japan in 1989, when \nSh�wa died (and before, when he was failing and people knew he would be dead \nsoon). The government nearly ground to a halt as people were putting off \nordering (and designing!) all new government forms that would have to have a NEW \nera name in a checkbox (for birthdates, registrations, etc.), and had no idea \nwhat the name was going to be, or when it was actually going to happen. New \ncalendars needed to be printed, etc. Yeah, it was still Sh�wa 65, but it was \nabout to become something else, too. :)\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
