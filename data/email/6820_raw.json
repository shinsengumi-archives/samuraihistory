The first pair of glasses was said to have been \ngiven to Ieyasu at the turn of the 16th c.  In 1636 spectacles accounted \nfor one percent of Dutch-Japanese trade: 19,425 pairs. They may not \nhave been very comfortable to wear. An encyclopaedia in 1732 \ndescribes them: &quot;glasses are about 3mm thick and look like the slices \nof giant radish.&quot; Mainly it seems these were heavy ones put on by seal \ncarvers, inlayers etc to look closely at things. In former times they \ncame from China. Light glass lensed sort came from Europe.  This \nbook has various illustrations of  people wearing glasses.\n\nProfessor Screech is in London, at the School of Oriental and African \nstudies, and everything I&#39;ve ever written by him is marvellous, full of \ninsights. If you are in England you might be able to find out more.\n\nHope this is of some help.\n\nGillian&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
