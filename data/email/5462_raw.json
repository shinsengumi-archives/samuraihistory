Deborah Cameron reports on a Japanese \n&gt; chameleon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suicide blond or raven-haired. Hyperactive comic or serious actor. \n&gt; Flim-flam television lunatic or master movie maker. Even in Japan, \n&gt; his home, there is confusion about the real Takeshi.\n&gt; \n&gt; It doesn&#39;t help that he goes by two names: Beat Takeshi for the \ndaft \n&gt; incarnation and Takeshi Kitano for the lofty other. As Beat, he was \n&gt; one half of a television comedy duo. As Kitano, the director and \n&gt; eponymous star of the samurai movie, Zatoichi, he was last year \n&gt; awarded the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival. \n&gt; \n&gt; Zatoichi is a samurai period drama involving two geisha with \n&gt; murderous intent. The central character, Zatoichi, is a masseur, \n&gt; master swordsman and so cold that the temperature shifts whenever \nthe \n&gt; camera catches him. As if being blind were not enough, his \nperoxided \n&gt; hair and blood-red cane (concealing a long blade) ensure that he is \n&gt; the most memorable player in the fight scenes. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I get questions about influence from other films,&quot; Takeshi told \n&gt; Midnight Eye, a Japanese magazine. &quot;But I really don&#39;t watch enough \n&gt; films to be influenced by them. I&#39;ve been asked whether the tap-\ndance \n&gt; scene was influenced by Bollywood movies, but I&#39;ve never seen any \n&gt; Bollywood films in my life.&quot; The tap dancing was more influenced by \n&gt; the Japanese dance form in kabuki, in which dancers wear wooden \n&gt; sandals, he said. And as for the violence, he claims the only ones \n&gt; who ask about it are foreign media.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;When I show it (violence), it hurts,&quot; he told Midnight Eye. &quot;I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; want people to think it&#39;s just a game. If you compare my films to \n&gt; something like Die Hard, the death toll in my films is pretty low. \n&gt; But in a swordplay film, violence and deaths are unavoidable.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In the Japanese film industry, Takeshi is a major force and listed \n&gt; alongside the legendary director Akira Kurosawa (whose daughter, \n&gt; Kazuko, designed the costumes for Zatoichi). Some suggest that \n&gt; Takeshi is Kurosawa&#39;s heir, citing a letter that Takeshi got from \nthe \n&gt; late Kurosawa the year before his death. &quot;I leave the Japanese film \n&gt; industry to you,&quot; Kurosawa wrote. Takeshi, now 58, had many \nescapades \n&gt; as a younger man when drinking, strife with his wife and other \nwomen \n&gt; and a near-fatal scooter crash in 1994 made him fodder for gossip \n&gt; magazines.\n&gt; \n&gt; The accident seems to have tamed him - though not enough to win \n&gt; admirers at the Japan Film Academy, which, despite his skill and \n&gt; fame, has never honoured him. Why?\n&gt; \n&gt; The most likely explanation is that some cannot stomach his other \n&gt; life as Beat Takeshi, the vulgarian. During this phase, especially \nin \n&gt; the &#39;80s, he was a TV bad boy. He swore, flashed his genitals, made \n&gt; lewd jokes, was cruel, parodied the establishment, showed up to the \n&gt; studio drunk and threw convention out like stale fish. His role \n&gt; opposite David Bowie as the sadistic camp official, Hara, in the \n1983 \n&gt; film Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence did not alter their opinion. \n&gt; \n&gt; Zatoichi is now screening.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/03/1093939114369.html?\n&gt; oneclick=true#\n\n\n\n"
