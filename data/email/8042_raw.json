You obviously know what you&#39;re talking about and have done a\n&gt; lot of research.\n\nIt keeps me off the streets. (But I *like* the streets... &lt;G&gt;)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;     You&#39;re right.  I did miss the site specifically meant\n&gt; for &quot;TENTS&quot;.  Don&#39;t know how that happened, but I&#39;m glad you pointed\n&gt; it out to me.  This is exactly what I needed.\n&gt;\nThought so. &lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;      One quick question for you...You suggest that, historically, the\n&gt; Japanese probably used wooden supports for the awning.  I intend to\n&gt; use a garage canopy - as you suggested - due to costs, safety, and\n&gt; structural integrity.  Do you think that covering the piping with\n&gt; bamboo would be &quot;period&quot;.\n&gt;\nNot really. It might look &quot;better&quot; but the real things had serious, \nsolid wooden supports -- somewhere in the area of 2x4s -- and simple \nbamboo wouldn&#39;t hold up something like that. So it&#39;s one of those \ncosmetic decisions. What I&#39;d do, if you were using an aluminum carport \nmodel, is to encase the poles in adhesive wood-pattern shelf &quot;paper&quot;.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
