And would not where it even for the better.\n\n&gt; but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years\n&gt; of my life.\n\nA commendable time spent learning. Kudos.\n\n&gt; I have to disagree.  There are all kinds\n&gt; of ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise movement\n&gt; or position.  This is simply not true.\n\nDid you invent the Hakama and devise it&#39;s uses? I believe that you didn&#39;t. You only know of it&#39;s uses inside Budo as you learn it,\nand are in no position to comment on any other arts uses of the hakama.\n\n&gt; The Samurai\n&gt; when going in to combat without armor preffered to\n&gt; were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.\n\nAs does anybody with an ounce of common sense.\n\n&gt; This\n&gt; allowed full movement without tripping on the hakama\n&gt; itself.(anyone who practices Aikido has had this\n&gt; happen)\n\nI agree. This I have seen for myself.\n\n&gt; When wearing armor they didn&#39;t even wear\n&gt; hakama so it did not apply.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don&#39;t believe that this paragraph has anything atall to do with the subject matter being discussed.\n\n&gt; The Word &quot;ninja&quot; is not hstorically correct and\n&gt; neither is their movie incarnation.  They were usually\n&gt; reffered to as Shinobi and originally were not as\n&gt; specialized as the movies make them appear.  They were\n&gt; used to set fire to enemy encampments and castles in\n&gt; order to cause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they would\n&gt; be employed to kill.  But I have heard of very few if\n&gt; any cases with the latter.  A good book on the subject\n&gt; of the origin and truths behind the &quot;Ninja&quot; is Stephen\n&gt; Turnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold of and\n&gt; has to be ordered from Europe but is worth the price.\n\n&gt; There are alot of myths regarding the history of the\n&gt; Martial arts.(Ninja Especially)\n\nWho mentioned movies? Who mentioned historically correct details regarding the ninja? How would you be an authority on the ninja?\nYou study Budo by your own admission. It is very rude by every cultures beliefs to denounce that of which you are ignorant.\n\nAnd ignorant of such matters you are.\n\nWhether the term &quot;Ninja&quot; appeared in Japan  _ever_  is no matter. Nowdays it is an accepted layman&#39;s term. Whether you like it or\nnot. And the world will use it without you.\n\nI have respect for the way of Bu, but not for you, because you are ignorant, and have no respect for anything but your own\n&quot;knowledge&quot;. Of which you probably know nothing outside of Budo teachings, and the odd bit of book reading here or there by authors\nwho are also no authority on the subjects which they publish books on.\n\nThat is my last comment on the matter on the list, if you wish to comment youself, which you no doubt would accept to do without\nthought, then you have my e-mail address and have my invitation to mail me personally for any reason.\n\nKumo.\n\nNatsu Kusa Ya\nTsuamono Domo Ga\nYume No Ato\n\nBasho Matsuo.\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: erik baker\n\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am sorry but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years\n&gt; of my life.

Bryant, Both of\n&gt; these are good.  There was really nothing mysterious\n&gt; about it.  If you look at the clothing from the yayoi\n&gt; period forward you will see similarity&#39;s leading to\n&gt; the advent of the Hakama.  The Japanese as with every\n&gt; othr nation were very practical in the development of\n&gt; their clothing.  A good example of this is the Long\n&gt; Hakama worn in the Shoguns palace during the Tokugawa\n&gt; period which restricted movement making attacks on\n&gt; others impossible.  Also the short hakama worn in the\n&gt; Summer by some foot soldiers and attendants in the\n&gt; kamakura period.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;\n&gt; Musashi\n&gt;\n&gt; P.s. I left out alot of other examples.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- KUM0 &lt;kum0@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Konnichi-wa,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It has been my experience of martial arts (for 11\n&gt; &gt; years, through 8 different arts), that the samurai\n&gt; &gt; used to wear them for all\n&gt; &gt; of the above purposes, but also for one other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is a sitting posture that the ninja adopted\n&gt; &gt; when impersonating a samurai, so that it was easy to\n&gt; &gt; move if attacked\n&gt; &gt; unexpectantly, or preparing to attack unexpectantly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although I can&#39;t reveal the seated posture, I can,\n&gt; &gt; however, tell you about it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This seated posture looks identical to the casual\n&gt; &gt; seated posture in modern day Japan, with the legs\n&gt; &gt; crossed at the shins, and\n&gt; &gt; knees almost resting on the ankles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is still alive in martial arts that have\n&gt; &gt; techniques adopted from the samurai arts. The hakama\n&gt; &gt; hid whether or not they\n&gt; &gt; were seated like this in particular, or  _however_\n&gt; &gt; they were seated in fact.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kumo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Natsu Kusa Ya\n&gt; &gt; Tsuamono Domo Ga\n&gt; &gt; Yume No Ato\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Basho.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: konos\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Besides it&#39;s ocassional apperance at the Edo Period\n&gt; &gt; and in the hitatare of 12th century, hakama is not\n&gt; &gt; obligatory. It&#39;s not a\n&gt; &gt; daimyo&#39;s command. Nevertheless samurai were more or\n&gt; &gt; less obliged to follow the &quot;rich and famous&quot; status\n&gt; &gt; of the court they were\n&gt; &gt; implicated in.
