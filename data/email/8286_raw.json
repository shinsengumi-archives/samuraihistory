But for the most part, a samurai was \n&gt; born, not \n&gt;  &gt;made.  \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  Okay, this is something that is now confusing me.  I thought that this \n&gt;  was only true when Toyotomi Hideyoshi turned Japan society into a caste \n&gt;  system (so that no one else could do what he did. ;-) ) and that before \n&gt;  that there was a lot more fluidity in the social classes.  I know the \n&gt;  strict caste system is portrayed for Japan in almost all the &quot;Japanese&quot; \n&gt;  RPGs that are played these days.  (The only exception I know of is \n&gt;  Legends of the Samurai, which to me is an excellent RPG).\n&gt;  \n\nI think that, before Hideyoshi&#39;s famous &quot;sword hunt&quot; that many farmers were \narmed with swords and other weapons. And also there was a class of people, I \nbelieve they were called &quot;Ji-samurai&quot; or &quot;farmer-samurai&quot; who worked the fields \nbut also could fight in battles. Not sure, please anyone feel free to correct \nme.\n\nBut definitely after Hideyoshi&#39;s &quot;sword-hunt,&quot; a samurai was definitely born, \nnot made.\n\nNina\n\n"
