Took\nabout three days =\r\nas I remember the tale ****\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n&gt;    &quot;Thank you so much, this is =\r\n*fantastic* information. Were there \n&gt;    other \n&gt;    forms of executions p=\r\nracticed (apologies for the morbidity of \n&gt;    topic) \n&gt;    other than sepp=\r\nuku, crucifixion?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Yes, lots of them. Not so much during the Edo per=\r\niod where \n&gt;    crucifixtion was the standard, but during the Sengoku perio=\r\nd and \n&gt;    before, the forms of execution were pretty much subject to the =\r\n\n&gt;    local \n&gt;    warlord&#39;s whims. Just about anything was done...one of th=\r\ne most \n&gt;    gruesome being one of the Saito clan boiling an enemy to death=\r\n in a \n&gt;    large cauldron (much like Lord Yabu did in Clavell&#39;s Shogun). T=\r\nhis \n&gt;    also happened to the notorious bandit Ishikawa Goemon. Another \n&gt;=\r\n    warlord (sorry, don&#39;t recall who) was buried up to his neck with a \n&gt;  =\r\n  bamboo saw placed next to him and a sign inviting passersby to feel \n&gt;   =\r\n free to have a go at him (Clavell used this too, for Lord Ishida). \n&gt;    B=\r\neating a man to death was common as was death during torture \n&gt;    (which \n=\r\n&gt;    wasn&#39;t a planned execution, but just sped up the process).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    =\r\n---\n&gt;    Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;    Samurai Arc=\r\nhives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;    --- \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Ya=\r\nhoo!
