Christianity was spreaded very quickly in the hands of the jesuits.\nAnd =\r\nsoon some daimyos were converted. Maybe some of them really found truth in =\r\nthe western faith, but most of them accepted to become baptized in order to=\r\n get economical advantages in their deals with the portugueses.\nWhatever th=\r\ne reason was, obviuosly, when the lord was baptized soon all their retainer=\r\ns followed his example. In that way, in fact, most of the catholic samurais=\r\n (there were not protestant samurais) become christian only because it was =\r\nhis duty toward his lord. Some few exceptions exist anyway.\nAnd when the To=\r\nkugawa regime banned the christianity the vast majority of them just change=\r\nd their faith as soon as his lord changed.\nThe few ones that chose to persi=\r\nst in their beliefs (samurais and farmers) were persecuted and most of them=\r\n were indeed baptized in blood (martyrized).\n\n\nAsanga Chameera &lt;chameera@oc=\r\neanlanka.lk&gt; wrote:                                  Deal All,\n \n I got kno=\r\nw that  there were Christian Samurais , If you let you  let me\n know  their=\r\n History , it would be interesting.
