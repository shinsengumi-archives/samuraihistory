The main \nreasons I can think are that\n\n1. The constant warring of Hojo Ujiyasu against local clans such as \nthe Satake and Satomi undermined his position in the region by \nfostering a relationship between him and other Daimyo that made them \nturn to Oda and Tokugawa for support.\n\n2. Hojo Soun&#39;s establishment of the clan was based on poor \nfoundations, after all he claimed only tenuous links to ancient clan \ntraditions. Thus his band of followers were small.\n\n3. Hojo Ujiyasu had excellent organisational skills but when Hojo \nUjimasa took over he did not coordinate his forces as well as his \nfather did.\n\n4. The position of the Hojo in the Kanto region although relatively \nguarded and rich was tennable, due to the Tokkaido roads and Hakone \nmountain passes that led to the old capital at Kamakura. Also the \nHojo lacked naval strength as the other Western based clans had, such \nas Kuki family who served Oda so effectively using the kumano Sui \nnavy. \n\n5. The battle of Kawagoe 1545 was at the time a victory, but I would \nargue a pyrhic one, because by defeating the Uesugi, it only \nharboured resentment enough to turn them against the Hojo and from \nthe North they blocked off retreat in the Odawara campaign.\n\n6. Uesugi Kagekatsu who was Hojo by birth but adopted by Kenshin, \nsupported the forces against Tokugawa, it could be argued that if he \nremained on friendly terms, the Hojo and Uesugi could have formed a \nreasonable alliance covering the Hakone mountains, and most of \nShinano, any attack would be costly and not so easily executed, \nleaving the Hojo as Sparta did during the Sparta athenian war, to \nconcntrate on naval resources. Also Date family could have been asked \nfor support leading to a North vs South war perhaps. Although this is \nhighly unlikely because most clans were fighting against each other \nand in particular the Satake and Satomi were already located in the \nEast of Hojo and would be a considerable thorn in the side.\n\n7. The quality of Hojo guns, As the allied forces apparently brought \nWestern cannon with them, but not siege cannon, they were only \ncapable apparently of setting fire to barricades. But never the less, \nif Hojo attained a supply of guns from Sakai, or another major trade \nport already under control by Oda or Tokugawa, then there ability to \nlast in a siege would be much greater. \n\n8. The Hojo should have looked further afield, there were many Daimyo \nwho didn&#39;t like Oda or Tokugawa, but most of Japan supported them, if \nthe Hojo had dug deeper they may have caused a Segikahara 10 years \nearlier than it happened. Without Date and Maeda for suppport \nTokuugawa may not have become shogun, as Uesugi Kagekatsu perhaps \nrealised his mistake in also not supporting Hojo.\n\n9. The war against the Takeda perhaps put an end to Takeda but also \nleft them vulnerable with Tokugawa seizing vital territories namely \nKai and Shinano, with this seizure came the ability to turn the \nmountin passes, leaving the columns of Tokugawa and Oda samurai to \nmarch through.\n\n10. A pitched battle in the mountains? could it have turned the tide, \nremeber Okehazama Nobunaga stopped Imagawa with approx 1/10 of his \nforce, could a force of say 5000 take on 50000 of Tokuagwa by \nstrategic blocking of passes and clever deception techniques. Maybe, \nHojo had a man for this Fuma Kotaro-the special forces leader, but \nwas he dead? But even if this had occured the Hojo were still in dire \nstraits.\n\n11.The Satake and Satomi clans, did not support Hojo. With support by \nthese clans supply routes could have been kept open, likewise goes to \nYuki Harumoto who choose to side with Tokuagwa. With Yuki&#39;s support \nHojo could have lasted alot longer, Odawara was a fortress effort had \nbeen made to strengthen it.\n\n12. Toyotomi Hideyoshi- It can&#39;t be denied that Toyotomi HIdeyoshi \nwas a great general. He apparently managed to build a castle under \nthe nose of the Odawara defenders, I think although it would have \nbeen a morale shattering episode, it was more a case of Roman esque \nsiege tactics, because he enclosed Odawara in two lines of siege \nworks, then built his castle I think. \n\n13. Maybe the Odawara castle was not as strong as the Hojos thought, \nbecause it had been sieged and burnt twice before 1561 Uesugi \nKagetora deputy kanrei, 1569 Takeda captured it but retreaded due to \nfamine.  \n\n14. Build walls, to link the castles, making one huge fortified area, \nthe Hojo let there sattelite castles fall one by one, perhaps it \ncould be argued that a policy, more like Athens when she built long \nwalls to protect her port the Pireaus. But the Hojo had no means of \nsea supply anyway. I guess the Hojo were cut off. But they could have \nfortiefied and linked their defenses better. Allowing key men like \nChiba Shigetane a better chance to make a lasting stand. \n\n15. Daidoji Masashige, could have offered another plan, what Im \nunsure of,but to sit and wait was demoralizing for any army no matter \nhow small, it is said the best form of defence is attack, therefore \nwhy not catch them off guard. But it would only prolong the \ninevitable, but a small victory could have lifted the spirits and \nmaybe shown other daimyo that the two generals were not invincible. \n\n16. Negotiation, the Hojo constantly attempted to negotiate their \ncorner, no battle was really fought it was more like sitting round a  \ntable holding back the cards, i.e the Odawara-jo. Nobody wanted a \nfight, Tokugawa and Hideyoshi would not be wise to fight, because the \nNorth east was still to be subdued Date, Mogami, Hachisuka, AShina, \nHatakeyama some major daimyo still were left, the North East would be \nmountainous and tough. therfore losses of 50% or more would put the \nconquerors in a poor military situation. Hojo Ujimasa eventually paid \nwith his life, Hojo Ujinao became a monk then died of small pox, the \nHojo clan faded from the sengoku epoch. Why didn&#39;t one Hojo perhaps \nUjiteru flee North East to gain support, because he couldn&#39;t they \nwere samurai and thus waited to die. \n\nIn conclusion perhaps the best outcome the Hojo could have hoped for \nwas to dent the enemy forces enough to make them hesitate showing \nweakness so more time could be gained to strengthen their forts and \nmore allies could be gathered. But this never happened because a \nsiege was seen as the best way of holding ground, to negotiate \nfavourable terms. But the problem was Tokugawa and Hideyoshi had 200 \n000 men, Hojo had 50000 ~ and this ratio of 4/1 could only be used to \nthe Hojos advantage, if they attacked single regiments at a time, \nweakening each front until the cohesive strength became such that a \nmajor breakout and encirclement could be attempted by their own \nforces, perhaps using cavalry as an armoured fist. I only speculate \nas in reality in history it never did happen, perhaps it was not \npossible. Perhaps they ressigned themselves to fate. Seeing \nHIdeyoshis new castle built apparently overnight at Ichiya. The \npretext to this war was the Hojos taking of Sanada castle at \nNukuramui (think Shinano) maybe if the Hojo could get the Sanada to \nsupport them they would have increased the likely hood of having \nbetter generals and more vetern troops. But anything the Hojo did of \nthis parremeter would be in the end a pyrhic victory. The Hojo did \nnot really stand a chance, its another sad chapter in the times of \nSengoku warfare, not even Gekokuji (low overcome high) but now the \nLow overcome the High who used to be low and before never existed. \nBecause Hojo Soun brought the clan into existence on fragile \nfoundations, they never had all the right elements to become bakufu. \nIt is said if you build your house on poor foundations it will come \nto no good; well in the Hojos case it was true. How sad how very sad. \n\nAnyone respond if you can think of any other reasons, its just my \nopinion, thinking about the situation, because the facts are limited \nit is difficult to understand the campaign in great and sufficient \ndetail. \n\nAll best Mark\n\n\n"
