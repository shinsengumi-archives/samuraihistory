Francisco Xavier entered in Japan through LIES and THREASON\nfrom the\n&gt; &gt; beggining. I&#39;ve read a copy of the original message of him to the\npope with\n&gt; &gt; a translation to portuguese, and he admited that, to introduce\nchristianity\n&gt; &gt; to japan, they would deliberatelly LIE and ACT WITH FALSEHOOD,\ndisguissing\n&gt; &gt; christian religious practices with the buddhist ones...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        Okay, just a question here: which would have been better: for\nthem to \n&gt; have used deception and get in to attempt the spread of their\nmessage or tell \n&gt; the truth, probably get killed and never get a word in about their\nmessage?  \n&gt; To me, missionary work can take on many disguises, because it&#39;s a\nmatter of \n&gt; using whatever means you have to to get your message out and if you\nbelieve it&#39;s \n&gt; that important, you die for it.  As someone said, it&#39;s a matter of\nWHICH \n&gt; (L)ord you&#39;re dying for.  In their cases, they were dying for a Lord\nNot Of This \n&gt; World.  They adhered absolutely to the tenets of bushido in that\nthey served \n&gt; their highest Lord to the death.  Show me one samurai who never lied\nor used \n&gt; falsehood or murdered or committed some form of treason to protect\nhis lord -- \n&gt; human or Otherwise -- and I&#39;ll show you a liar.  :-)\n&gt;        As for Nobunaga, what about the threat of the Ikko Ikki?  Do\nyou think \n&gt; they wanted to party hearty?  Do you think they were going to try and \n&gt; proselytize him and his army?  Hardly likely.  It is unlikely that a\nmajority of the \n&gt; people who stood in Nobunaga&#39;s way, even if they did congeal into a\npotent \n&gt; fighting force, would have stood a chance against a brilliant\ngeneral such as the \n&gt; leader of the Oda and his right hand man, Toyotomi, this is true. \nBut that \n&gt; wasn&#39;t the issue.  The issue was that anyone who stood in Oda&#39;s way\nof unifying \n&gt; Japan -- in WHATEVER WAY THAT WAS -- was seen as a threat.  Any\nthreat -- no \n&gt; matter how great or small, or how justified or unjustified -- must\nbe removed. \n&gt;  Therefore, the genocide, however indefencible to us, was very\ndefencible to \n&gt; HIM, and quite frankly, that&#39;s the only opinion about the issue that\nreally \n&gt; mattered in the end, although it is nice to bat it around and say\n&quot;what if&quot; and \n&gt; &quot;what was he thinking?&quot; now with four hundred years plus of hindsight.\n&gt;        And I must throw my hat into the ring about it too -- I may\nnot be a \n&gt; Catholic (either belief or by church membership), but these\nanti-Catholic posts \n&gt; have GOT to stop.\n&gt;        Anyway, that&#39;s my two &quot;not-worth-much&quot; cents.  8-)  Take\ncare, y&#39;all.  \n&gt; 8-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
