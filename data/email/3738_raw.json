My advice is start now while you are young. The longer you leave it the harder it gets. My experience is like Nate&#39;s - many Japanese people read and write English well but do not speak at all fluently. And to be able to read Japanese opens up the country and culture to you in a way you cannot imagine.\n\nG\n&gt; the web, go to:\n&gt;      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n\n\n"
