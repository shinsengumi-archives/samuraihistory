There are plenty of \nbirth/death/marriage certificates back to about the 1840&#39;s or so, as well as \ngenealogical books that still hold records from even further back. I&#39;ve been doing \nmy own genealogy for years, back to 16th century france.  My wife (who is \nJapanese) is far, far more difficult, and we&#39;ve only got back as far as her great-\ngreat grandfather who was a samurai and advisor to the lord of the Ikeda clan of \nTottori.  Beyond that, I don&#39;t think the records exist, or if they do, it is VERY \nhard to get them from the hands of the japanese government. I believe the records \nexist, but it is next to impossible to get at them.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That&#39;s me, with no real way of finding out either. The US doesn&#39;t have \nthe records that Europe or Japan has. Possibly because in the US \ncitizenship is determined by where you are born and your parents \ncitizenship if you are born outside of the US. Unlike for example \nGermany where 4th generation Turks are not citizens and people of German \nancestory can become German citizens quite rapidly. Same issues with \nKoreans born in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n"
