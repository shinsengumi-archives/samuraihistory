I would prefer the forename to\nbe easily shortened according to English principles (i.e. &quot;Tad&quot; for\nTadaka), and I would like the surname to be connected to any\nwell-known samurai family or clan in Japanese history, preferably\nsomeone heroic. Ideally in the Shimazu family, but not necessarily.\n\n\nIf you can be of any assistance I would be incredibly grateful. If I\nchoose a name that is given to me, I will acknowledge the person in my\n&#39;thank you&#39; section in the book.\n\nI do not read or speak Japanese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
