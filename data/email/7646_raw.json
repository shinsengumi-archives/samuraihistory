She thought =\r\nan \nevent showcasing Japanese culture could be a rich experience for the \nb=\r\nase community.\n\n&quot;I felt it would serve to help Americans understand and app=\r\nreciate \nthe culture of our host country,&quot; she said. &quot;I also hoped it would=\r\n \nenhance the relationship established between our two countries.\n\n&quot;It was =\r\nwonderful for my Japanese friends, too. They were truly \nflattered and appr=\r\neciative that we were so interested in their \nculture and traditions.&quot;\n\nThe=\r\n event, hosted by the base Morale, Welfare and Recreation \ndepartment, star=\r\nted with the lecture, which was translated for those \nattending, and was fo=\r\nllowed by the martial arts exhibition.\n\n&quot;Seeing some of the real samurai sw=\r\nords here was cool, especially \nwith some being more than 300 years old,&quot; s=\r\naid Sasebo dependent Leif \nBogen. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen the razor-sharp real one=\r\ns before, just the \ncheap ones in stores,&quot; he added.\n\n&quot;This was very intere=\r\nsting, especially the history of the swords,&quot; \nsaid Navy spouse Christopher=\r\n Lambert.\n\nThe culture-sharing event is of the sort MWR Director Scott \nPol=\r\nuhowich said he&#39;d like to host more often.\n\n&quot;We try and, certainly, we&#39;d li=\r\nke to have more events like this,&quot; he \nsaid. &quot;It&#39;s just a matter of making =\r\ncontacts in the area community \nwho are willing to volunteer, and having pe=\r\nople from the base \ncommunity suggest and assist in making the connections.=\r\n&quot;\n \n\n=A9 2003 Stars and Stripes.
