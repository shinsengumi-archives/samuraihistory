The best books as introduction are those \nby our Anthony Bryant at Indiana University,  clearly written and factual.    \nDr. Turnbull has a high reputation in  the field, but I deem only so because, \nuntil the advent of Tony B. he was the only one who wrote in the field in \nEnglish.  I have found Turnbull to be distressingly contradictory about the Battle \nof Nagashino,  in that an important raid that Oda Nobunaga launched against \nTakeda Katsuyori  Turnbull said in one book the raid was launched the night \nbefore the battle.  In another book, he said it was the morning of the battle.  \nAlso,  his research on Japanese castle sieges seems way out of line with the \ncontemporary battle screens which depicted such sieges!  Therefore, go by Bryant \nin your research,  and keep Turnbull for the supply train.  Regards,  Prof \nMurphy\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
