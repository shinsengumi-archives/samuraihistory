I guess \nmy most recent re-reading of James Clavell&#39;s Shogun did it.  Third \ntimes the charm.  \nI don&#39;t have much in the way of expertise, only a desire to learn \nmore.  I am interested especially in the Tokugawa Bakufu since that \nseems to have been th pinacle of Samurai power in Japan (at least I \nhave been lead to believe that), but I also wish to learn about the \nother Bakufus and about Japanese mythology and its links to Shinto \nand Buddhism.  \n\n\n"
