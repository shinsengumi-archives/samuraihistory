There are men \nand women today that fight and die with honor.I think that perhaps \nyour definition of honor is different than mine.  I see that honor \nand loyalty can be independent of eachother.  Honor is synonymous \nwith integrity.  The unfying moral character of a person that binds \nthem to do what is right at all time.  At times, having honor means \nthat you must overlook your loyalty to do what is right.  If I am \nloyal to an evil Daimyo (shameless attempt to relate message to group \nsubject) does that make me a person with honor?  If I am carrying out \nthe orders of a ruthless bloodthirsty man, do I have honor?  The evil \nin this world is as much the child of evil men as the good men who do \nnothing about it. \nIn the military, having honor may mean disagreeing with your \nsuperior.  In the case of war, it may mean disobeying an unlawful \norder.  Under the Law of Armed Conflict, all military people are \ntaught to abide by certain rules of engagement.  It doesn&#39;t matter \nhow loyal you may be to your Commander.  If he orders an attack on an \nillegal target; you disobey or you do not have honor...you have a \njail sentence with hard labor.\nI think that most people have some sense of honor (maybe I&#39;m wearing \nrose colored glasses).  Most people care about how others see them.  \nHonor in a small sense is what drives people to conform to social \nnorms.  Most people want to be good.  They want to do the right \nthing.  \nI do think loyalty is important.  It is paramount to use reason and \nobjectivity with loyalty or you could find yourself in deep poop.  \nDoing the right thing is more important than pleasing the right \npeople.\n(stepping off soapbox)\n\nBrandon\n\n --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Emine SELBES&quot; &lt;\nemineselbes@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; yes, yes, yes,\n&gt; honour is just about forgotten in the world, following the collapse \nof\n&gt; feudal families;\n&gt; being a member of such a family myself, honour and loyalty are two \nmusts of\n&gt; my life;\n&gt; strange how few people agree,\n&gt; i work for a multinational company and we had a work-shop last \nweeek\n&gt; todetermine the core values for our company\n&gt; so few people voted for loyalty!!!\n&gt; regards\n&gt; emine\n\n\n"
