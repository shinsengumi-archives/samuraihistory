I have\n&gt; been assigned a project in school on Samurai and as\n&gt; part of my assignment I must *interview* an &quot;expert&quot;\n&gt; on the subject.  This is my second request for help,\n&gt; but I am afraid maybe I didn&#39;t explain very well the\n&gt; first time.  I must also do research as part of my\n&gt; assignment, but I really need to *interview*\n&gt; someone.  I only have about 10 questions.  Is there\n&gt; anyone on this list who might be able to help me?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Craig \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 24, 2007 9:37 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [SPAM] [samuraihistory] NEED HELP\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I need some information on how the samurai did the\n&gt; swordmanship \n&gt;   training.
