There were \nvery low ranking samurai who doubled as peasants in that they actually \nengaged in agriculture. But, they were members of the buke class. \nAnother issue is that this was a time when there was a fair demand for \nsoldiers, so a peasant might run away and try to join somebody&#39;s army. \nRegardless, I believe that there is a fairly recent scholarly text on \n&quot;Samurai Warfare&quot; available. There may have also been camp followers, \nbut these would have been scavengers. Regardless, I do not recall \nbattle paintings showing secondary groups of support units. Finally, \ngiven the relative scarcity of iron in Japan, I rather doubt that \nanyone was being frivolously armed. The same goes for horses.\n\n\n\n\n"
