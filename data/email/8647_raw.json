One saying came to mind immediately - &quot;Ask not what you=\r\n can do for your computer, but what your computer can do for you&quot; (with apo=\r\nlogies to President John F. Kennedy).  By this I mean, before seeking advic=\r\ne one should comb cyber space for the information one seeks.\n\nHaving done t=\r\nhis for the last half hour I find that google searches for &quot;Hanzo Hattori&quot; =\r\n(with quotes) leads to something like 22,300 hits, many in foreign language=\r\ns.  Then, very common hits occur on sites related to this list&#39;s b=EAte noi=\r\nre - Ninja...\n\nThen I found a ninja expression - &quot;patience is but a short t=\r\nime&quot;.  I found this particularly apposite to web searches of the sort befor=\r\ne me!!!  So, to the findings:\n\nFrom the website:\n\nhttp://www.answers.com/ma=\r\nin/ntquery;jsessionid=3D3epmqci8nojef?method=3D4&dsid=3D2222&dekey=3DHattor=\r\ni+Hanz%C5%8D&curtab=3D2222_1&sbid=3Dlc04b&linktext=3DHattori%20Hanz%C5%8D\n\n=\r\nI found the following:\nTo this day, artifacts of Hanzo&#39;s legacy remain; the=\r\n Imperial Palace (formerly the shogun&#39;s palace) still has a gate called Han=\r\nzo&#39;s Gate, and the Hanzo-mon subway line which runs from central Tokyo to t=\r\nhe southwestern suburbs is named after the gate. Hanzo&#39;s remains now rest i=\r\nn the Sainen-ji temple cemetery in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The temple also holds h=\r\nis favorite spears.\n\nThis leads to still more searches, which I will now le=\r\nave to those more interested in the topic, like searching on &quot;Sainen-ji&quot;...=\r\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Messag=\r\ne ----- \nFrom: &quot;the_jigglin_penguin&quot; &lt;the_jigglin_penguin@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;s=\r\namuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, April 01, 2006 9:11 AM\nSubje=\r\nct: [samuraihistory] hanzo hattori\n\n\nHanzo was a master of the spear this i=\r\n know. His favorite spear is \nheld in a temple in japan. I would like more =\r\ninfo on the spear and its \nlocation. Thanks!\n\n[Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
