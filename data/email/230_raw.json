These elite warriors where called many\n&gt; different things in many different records.  The terms\n&gt; that we start to see arrising the most out of these\n&gt; recors is &quot;bushi&quot; and &quot;Kyuba no Michi&quot;.  These two\n&gt; terms as far as I know are the main precursors to the\n&gt; famed &quot;Samurai&quot; and &quot;bushido&quot;.  While there are many\n&gt; terms used to describe ancient warriors of Japan these\n&gt; appear to be the most common.  Samrai does come from\n&gt; the meaning &quot;to serve&quot; and sybolized this idea\n&gt; throughout the history of Japan.\n&gt;\n\nNot quite.\n\nThe earliest terms for warriors, dating from the records of the seventh\ncentury and later, were &quot;tsuwamono&quot; or &quot;mononofu&quot;, or occasionally &quot;mosa.&quot;\n\nBushi and samurai are of later development.\n\nKyuba no michi, BTW, does not refer to the person, but to the occupation; it\nis &quot;the WAY of the bow and horse.&quot;\n\nTony\n\n\n"
