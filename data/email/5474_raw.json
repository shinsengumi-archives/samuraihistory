I&#39;d agree that most likely WOULD\n&gt; compromise--if the burning of Mt. Hiei was as shocking\n&gt; as the chroniclers would have us believe, then it&#39;s\n&gt; not likely someone else would have come up with that\n&gt; extreme methodology. And being as the only other way\n&gt; was to work with the various militant monastics, I&#39;d\n&gt; agree that would be likely. The religious groups had\n&gt; secular power since before the Heian jidai--why stop\n&gt; then? \n\nExactly, I was just thinking in general, not Yoshimoto specifically, \nbut he was the easiest 2nd choice after Nobunaga.  And keep in mind \nthat the Honganji, the Enryakuji, ikko ikki, etc were all over the \ncountry - Omi, Ise, Aki, all over.  They could cause major problems \nfor anyone who wants to take control.  They were allowed to grow and \nthrive because no one was really in control.\n\nAs for Mt. Hiei, having been there myself, I can&#39;t stress how much \nsheer *audacity* he must have had to even THINK of attacking Mt. \nHiei.  This is no hill, it is nearly a full mountain range.  It is \nHUGE. He must have been suffering from delusions of gradeur to think \nthat he could walk an army up the MOUNTAIN and burn it down, I can \nalmost guarantee that no one else would have taken that route.  The \nplace is really huge, with cliffs and sharp drops all around, and way \nway up there.\n\n&gt; &gt; Maybe Japan would \n&gt; &gt; have ended up as a semi-theocracy?\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, now you&#39;re just being silly. Not even Yoshimoto\n&gt; would have bowed to that one. \n\nC&#39;mon, there are plenty of theoretical cases where this could happen. \nSomeone gets to Kyoto with the assistance of the Honganji, for \nexample and in return for the title of Shogun, the Shogun is &quot;given&quot; \nmonastic advisors and keeps funds flowing to the monasteries around \nthe country.\n\n\n"
