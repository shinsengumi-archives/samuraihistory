Hmm... well in any event Ms. Murasaki=\r\n that is awsome that you feel this way about your sword. Murasaki is my fav=\r\norite color and the color of most things I own including my sword. Do you l=\r\nive in Japan? And if so do you live on Kyushu island? Well it was nice hear=\r\ning someone tell of something we have in common. Well I hope you are well i=\r\nn all that you do hope to hear from you soon. \n\nYami Murasaki &lt;Yami_Bara@ho=\r\ntmail.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nYou seem like a true samurai. The way you&#39;re saying thw=\r\n sword is a part of \nyou. That&#39;s exactly how connected Samurai were with th=\r\neir swords. It&#39;s \nwonderful someone else thinks that way!

I feel \n&gt;like its a part of=\r\n me that needs attention just like a close realative. I \n&gt;believe that my s=\r\nword is as strong as me and it can match my capabilities \n&gt;if need be. It m=\r\nay not be all that to any one else but it smells good and \n&gt;mackeral or won=\r\nderfull I view my swords as a lot more than just tools.
