First mention should go to Ki=\r\nller Katanas, a thoughtfully crafted set of rules specific to the popular 1=\r\n550-1650 period of internal conflict in Japan (though an expansion booklet =\r\ncovers the interesting Imjin War in Korea). It may be difficult to find opp=\r\nonents who play the rules,  but it is in any case worth buying as a backgro=\r\nund resource.  \n\nJapanese armies have been popular under rules sets with a =\r\nbroad historical span due to both historical interest and success on the ta=\r\nble.  DBA was mentioned - it has 12 stands of troops per side (requiring ro=\r\nughly 40 miniatures), is quick and can be fun.  Many people prefer larger b=\r\nattles (which might be a hundred, or two hundred or more, miniatures).  I p=\r\nlayed Samurai under DBA&#39;s large-scale successor DBM years ago (though not u=\r\nnder its recent successor DBMM), and more recently under the widely-used Fi=\r\neld of Glory rules (acronym FOG) that is my current preference for general =\r\nperiod ancient/medieval rules (a forthcoming version of FOG covering 1500 w=\r\nill be my choice for that overall period).  All these general rules contemp=\r\nlate both historical and ahistorical matches between armies (what if Hideyo=\r\nshi had fought the Spanish or Dutch?), which can be an advantage, but are f=\r\nocused on the tactical interactions between the opponents in a large battle=\r\n and lack the nuances and characterization seen in period-specific rules (d=\r\nueling, for example, or the interplay of special formations). \n\nThese sets =\r\nand many others share or support a fairly standard scheme of base sizes and=\r\n numbers of miniatures per base, which allows playing different rules sets =\r\nwith the same miniatures.  Base sizes vary with the scale of the miniatures=\r\n, 15mm and 25/28mm being the most common, with base widths of 40mm and 60mm=\r\n respectively.  Taking this into account will allow flexibility in playing =\r\ndifferent rules sets.  \n\nWarhammer Ancient Battles (acronym WAB) is a fairl=\r\ny widespread rules set that is played with 28mm miniatures and has army lis=\r\nts with army-specific chrome and special units (such as Ninjas).  It puts a=\r\nttention on individual unit special attributes and abilities rather than fo=\r\ncusing on tactical interactions of troop types. It has individual miniature=\r\n bases which are often moved on WAB trays, but suitably sized and matched m=\r\nagnetic/steel bases can be used to play other rules sets with the same mini=\r\natures.  \n\nThere are other sets of rules out there, including homebrew rule=\r\ns or adaptations of existing rules sets.  I&#39;d suggest seeing what people ar=\r\ne playing in your vicinity.\n\nI hope this is helpful!\n\nMike \n\n\n\n"
