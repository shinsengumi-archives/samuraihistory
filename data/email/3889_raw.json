Great I thought! However a few paragraphs into\nthe article it all seemed a bit familiar and I got the distinct impression\nthat I&#39;d read it all before. On checking, I found that it is taken,\nvirtually word for word or paragraph for paragraph from Turnbull&#39;s new book\n&#39;Samurai: The World of the Warrior&#39;. Even the photographs are virtually\nidentical (just different angles) to those reproduced in the book! Turnbull\nhas changed a few words here and there or added a few new sentences, but the\narticle really adds nothing at all to the chapter in the Osprey book. So\nunless you want the magazine for the other non-Japanese articles, save your\nmoney (3.40 or $5.95) and spend it wisely elsewhere!\nThis is not the first time that a whole chapter of Turnbull&#39;s work has been\nrepublished in a magazine and at least the second time that Military\nIllustrated has done this - so it&#39;s definitely a case of &#39;buyer beware&#39; when\npurchasing!\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n"
