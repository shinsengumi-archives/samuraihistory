From what \nI&#39;ve seen the bibliography is very extensive and it&#39;s driving me nuts \njust to know were to start. Please, I want your suggestions on just \nthe top 5 books on Samurai warfare, arms and armour, it would realy \nhelp.\n\nBy the way, does enyone know if the Portuguese ever employed \nchristian Samurai mercenaries in the Far East?\n\nThanx,\n\nNuno\n\n\n\n"
