It is a religion, check out some of the official \nwebsites for the various sects or visit a Zen temple and find out.\n\nFor example:\nhttp://www.sotozen-net.or.jp/kokusai/kokusai.htm\n\nGo halfway down and see:\nWords from the Buddhist Scriptures and Records of the Patriarchs  \t\n\nOops these look like writings to me, oh no! they have patriarchs as \nwell. I&#39;m not sure if you can call the original Buddha a prophet or not, \nmostly they think of him as a teacher. Are there Buddhist gods? Good \nquestion, I would say some sects think there are, but Japanese gods \naren&#39;t the all powerful beings like Western religions.\n\nEven a cursory hunt for information on Japanese Zen Buddhist sects in a \ngood library or a local temple will turn this information up, so you \ndon&#39;t have to trust the web.\n\nI also recommend studying English, your e-mail gives the impression that \nyou are rude and illiterate, certainly not someone who has seriously \nstudied Zen for many years.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n"
