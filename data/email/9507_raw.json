I recall helping out (with answers) Tom C=\r\nruise and some folks \nconnected with the film a few years before it was rel=\r\neased to \ntheatres. \n\nAt least I thought they&#39;d get it to at least resemble=\r\n Japan after our \nCivil War. The film was set in 1876-1877. This was the sa=\r\nme time as \nRurouni Kenshin/Samurai X was laid. The animes were more histor=\r\nically \ncorrect than the film was. \n\nSome examples--\n\n(SPOILER ALERT IF YOU=\r\n HAVE NOT YET SEEN TLS FILM)\n\nSeveral Samurai wearing only one katana\n\nA fa=\r\nllen Samurai committing seppukuu with a tante (dagger or knife) \nrather tha=\r\nn using his katana blade\n\nA reference to a field artillery cannon as a &#39;how=\r\nitzer&#39; years before \nthe howitzer was invented.\n\nSamurai participating in c=\r\novert (spying) operations. Samurai detested \nspying and any other form of d=\r\neceit. To this end they usually used \nNinjas for this purpose.\n\nSamurai in =\r\n1876-1877 still wearing ceremonial armour into battle and \nallowing an outs=\r\nider (Cruise as a cavalry captain) to wear the armour \nof the man he killed=\r\n. I don&#39;t recall Kenshin Himura or even Saitoh \nHajime wearing armour on RK=\r\n or SX. \n\nThe battle was laughable. No Samurai will wait for an enemy he is=\r\n \nfacing to attack first. Especially when he has the advantage of a \ncavalr=\r\ny charge against infantry. \n\nAll things considered I think that Richard Cha=\r\nmberlain (The Shogun) \ndid \na better job as a Samurai than Tom Cruise. Even=\r\n Chuck Norris would \nhave \nbeen a better choice. \n\nKen Watanabe was robbed.=\r\n He deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar \nthat year. I did hear he won =\r\nsome anime filming achievement awards \nearlier this year though. \n\nWell mor=\r\ne soon.
