Their quality and options are rather nice, especially since you \ncan get the fittings from the Nishijin Sword site (their sister company).  \nHowever, the language barrier does cause issues.  Every one of us had a \nproblem with our final product.  Some of us had the wrong tsuba.  Some had \nthe wrong samï¿½.  All minor things, for sure, but sill issues nonetheless.  I \nwas the only one who was determined enough to get what I had ordered so I \nhad to mail the tsuka back to Japan for the proper menuki to be attached.\n  In general they are a good company.  You just have to be prepared to deal \nwith minor problems and to not be surprised if you have to send something \nback.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCheck out Election 2004 for up-to-date election news, plus voter tools and \nmore! http://special.msn.com/msn/election2004.armx\n\n\n"
