After Midway I think that they fought on because they still held hope for a major victory. They were far behind in the development of radar and sonar, but they had advantages in torpedoes, biological warfare, and Japanese navy was the best in the world in night warfare. And of course there was the great hope that the kamakaze would bring them a victory. After it was clear that these things had failed I think that most were resolved to die for the emperor rather than surrender, look at what happend on Saipan, Okinawa and Iwojima. Had the home islands themselves been invaded much the same would have happend.\nThanks\nDave\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Cesare Polenghi \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, April 11, 2004 9:28 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] WWII... why?\n\n\n  According to Mass (the former Japanese historian at Stanford), the \n  samurai spirit was alive and kicking until the forties. Thus I hope I \n  am not going off-topic here. Ok, once I am done with my excuse, here is \n  my question: the Japanese campaign in East Asia and in the Pacific was \n  clearly a hopeless hyperbole. There was NO WAY the Japanese could \n  control and man such a vast area. After Guadalcanal, then, it was clear \n  that the wind had changed, still there was room for diplomacy, either \n  with the US and perhaps with what was left of China and the Soviets. \n  But the Japanese kept fighting and dying until August 1945.\n  Why?\n  I have my own theories, but before throwing them on the table, I&#39;d love \n  to hear from some of you.\n  Thanks\n  cepo\n  PS= subquestion; is the &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; a good movie? Worth 3 hours of \n  my life and the $3,99 at block buster?\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
