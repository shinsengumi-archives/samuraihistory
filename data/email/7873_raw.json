And nothing I said indicated such. \n\n&gt; And how does something that inspires an interest,\n&gt; like a good film\n&gt; does, automatically become suspect?  \n\nFiction is fiction. It may be good, inspiring fiction,\nbut the focus is to tell a story, not elucidate facts.\nI fail to see how you are getting the impression that\nI think that is a bad thing--I&#39;m not saying it is. \n\n\nAnd how do you\n&gt; know (and I mean\n&gt; KNOW, without any doubt) that the historical things\n&gt; you read are\n&gt; accurate and truthful and not slanted to suit the\n&gt; political agenda of\n&gt; the writer.\n\nThat&#39;s why you read multiple sources and compare them.\nThe difference here is intent--a film maker&#39;s goal\nisn&#39;t historical accuracy--it&#39;s to tell the story he\nwants to tell, and elicit a certain reaction from an\naudience. Again, there is nothing wrong with that--but\n99.9% of the time in conflicts with simply presenting\nfacts as is. \n\n  And\n&gt; finally, since we\n&gt; are all capable of telling the difference between a\n&gt; film made for pure\n&gt; entertainment and one made with loftier ideals,\n&gt; isn&#39;t turning your\n&gt; nose up at all films a bit pointless?\n\nAGAIN, I&#39;m not turning my nose up at all films. And\nare we all capable of telling the difference? I think\nnot. Stick around for a while, and you&#39;ll see plenty\nof people who come here, believing that what they see\nin movies is real. You have no idea how many people we\nget here that think that because they saw it on\nRurouni Kenshin, it must be true. I seriously\nchallenge the premise that &quot;we are all capable of\ntelling the difference&quot;, because it&#39;s consistently\nproven here that many people cannot. \n\n&gt; Whether Kurosawa used poetic licence or not in order\n&gt; to make a more\n&gt; entertaining film, who on earth cares? \n\nI SPECIFICALLY said that he did that to suit his\npurpose--and that&#39;s fine. If you watch Kagemusha in\norder to see an entertaining and moving film, you&#39;ll\nbe satisfied. If you&#39;re looking for an accurate\ndepiction of the battle of Nagashino, you will come\naway with mistaken impressions. \n\n I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; aware that he was a\n&gt; documentary maker who had sworn a blood oath to only\n&gt; depict all the\n&gt; truths that anyone ever wrote about the latter days\n&gt; of Takeda Shingen.\n\nKnock off the condescending attitude. Nowhere did I\never imply the above, much less say it. Kurosawa was a\nfabulous filmmaker who made wonderful movies. However,\nhe WASN&#39;T a documentary maker--that&#39;s my entire point.\nAccuracy in details was something he was very good\nat--costuming, etc. However, accurate reflection of\nhistorical events wasn&#39;t his desire. As I&#39;ve said for\nthe 400th time, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. I was\nsimply using him as an example--he created works of\nfiction. If people take them as historical\nrepresentations, which, as stated above, many people\nmistakenly take genre fiction to be, they will be\naccepting as fact things that are not facts at all. \n\n Are you\n&gt; concerned that we\n&gt; are gullible enough to believe that a film is equal\n&gt; to the truth?  \n&gt; If I couldn&#39;t tell the difference I&#39;d need locking\n&gt; up. \n\nWell, there certainly are a lot of people who justify\nthat concern. Do you wish to call the police for them\nto be locked up, or should I?\n\n My point is\n&gt; this, just because films are not a reliable source,\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean that\n&gt; every history book IS, and you can&#39;t know anyway,\n&gt; because you weren&#39;t\n&gt; there, and those that were there won&#39;t necessarily\n&gt; write everything as\n&gt; it happened if it doesn&#39;t suit their purpose. \n\nTrue, history books have flaws, and no, we can&#39;t know\nif every one is exactly right because we weren&#39;t\nthere. However, that doesn&#39;t mean that fiction is just\nas correct as non-fiction. That&#39;s why you read\nmultiple sources and evaluate the credibility of each.\nYour argument is philosphical sophistry--errors in\nhistory books do NOT mean that fictional accounts are\njust as correct. \n\n&gt; Saying, in effect, film\n&gt; =lies and half truths, history book = 100% correct\n&gt; is still daft. \n&gt; Assuming that I believe every film I see to be a\n&gt; documentary is insulting.\n\nNot as insulting as your willfully ignoring what I\nactually wrote, or your condescending attitude. Not\nvery smart to direct that at a list moderator. As I\nsaid, plenty of people come onto this site believing\nthat what they see in movies, fictional books, anime,\nmanga, etc. is historical fact. Nowhere did I say that\nhistory books were 100% correct--the point is, their\npurpose is to try to be correct, whereas fiction&#39;s\npurpose isn&#39;t to be, it&#39;s to entertain. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
