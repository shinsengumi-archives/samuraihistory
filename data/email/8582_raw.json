She never told us kids til we were older \nand coul=\r\nd understand.  The Japanese culture is ridden with many \nstrange concepts, =\r\nmy mother believes some really strange things.  \nBut if I wasn&#39;t affected, =\r\nI wouldn&#39;t be asking.  I do not believe in \nmost things, but this is not a =\r\njoke.I also have 2 grown daughters \nthat are affected by this curse.  Also =\r\nmy brother and 2 sisters.  \nIt&#39;s not possible for all of us to have common =\r\nailments, all \nobtained in different manners.  I still have family in Japan=\r\n, they \nhave come her to the states and the language barrier is a true \nobs=\r\ntacle.  The ways of life that they have is so different than what \nwe have =\r\nhere.  So don&#39;t make light of it, it just shows your \nignorance.  All I wan=\r\nt is to know if it&#39;s possible to reverse it.  \nSam -- In samuraihistory@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\nlistowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you for rea=\r\nl? (Just thought I&#39;d get that in before Tony)\n&gt; \n&gt; That aside, I&#39;ve noticed=\r\n that Japanese families have this concept \nof \n&gt; a &quot;family curse&quot; that I&#39;ve=\r\n never seen in the US (except in \nmovies), \n&gt; and have obsessions that they=\r\n are afflicted by it, and have thier \n&gt; little &quot;put the salt on the door&quot; r=\r\nituals to keep the evil spirits \nat \n&gt; bay. I&#39;ve seen it firsthand (the obs=\r\nessions, not the results).  \nNot \n&gt; much more to say, other than I don&#39;t th=\r\nink family curses are \nreal... \n&gt; at all, but that is my own possibly eccen=\r\ntric and idiosyncratic \n&gt; opinion. To be cliche, the more you believe in it=\r\n, the more real \nit \n&gt; becomes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think John Edwards posts to th=\r\ne list, but someone here \nmore \n&gt; attuned to the supernatural might be able=\r\n to help you out more \nthan I.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@...=\r\nm, &quot;Natalie&quot; &lt;robbins.s@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was born in Japan, Japanese mot=\r\nher, caucasian father.  My \nmother \n&gt; told \n&gt; &gt; me that her family history =\r\nwas samurai.  She also told me about \na \n&gt; curse \n&gt; &gt; placed on her/our fam=\r\nily for the many deaths caused by them.  I \nam \n&gt; &gt; curious to know if this=\r\n was indeed true and if it was just our \n&gt; family \n&gt; &gt; that was cursed or a=\r\nll samurai that was cursed.  I will be \nhonest to \n&gt; &gt; say that the curse i=\r\ns still intact and still affects us.  I do \nnot \n&gt; want \n&gt; &gt; to go into det=\r\nail, but is it possible to end this suffering on \nour \n&gt; &gt; family or is thi=\r\ns something that will plague us forever?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
