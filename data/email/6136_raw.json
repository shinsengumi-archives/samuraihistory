And I say that having lived their twice. It&#39;s\na 2 way road between Japan and the Asian\nmainland--nobody in their right mind would invade\nKorea simply to own that....place. If Japan owns it,\nthey control any Asian movement towards their country,\nand can move into Asia. Same thing for the Chinese,\nRussians, etc...\n\n&gt; So I snagged Mr. Turnbull&#39;s Osprey book and\n&gt; &quot;Samurai, A Military \n&gt; History,&quot; also by that same worthy, and found that\n&gt; the Osprey book \n&gt; was meaty reading for such a thin tome. \n\nWhich Osprey book? He&#39;s got about 20 of them. \n\n I suspect,\n&gt; from Turnbull&#39;s \n&gt; many offerings, that he is an excellent gent to\n&gt; start with, and then \n&gt; to branch out when my abundant free time is no\n&gt; longer taken up by \n&gt; these books.  Suggestions, anyone?  (Or, if there&#39;s\n&gt; a reading list \n&gt; compiled by some person, kindly direct me to it?)\n\nOnce again: www.samuraiarchives.com\n\nOne note of warning about Turnbull: He&#39;s mercurial,\nand often times concerned with publication for\npublication&#39;s sake. Much of his newer books are\nrehashes of things he&#39;d previously written, and some\nare horribly edited. Many of his older books contain\nnumerous mistakes, some of which he has later\ncorrected. Questions have arisen about his &quot;research&quot;\nin earlier books since they mirror other books by less\nprolific authors. \n\nHe&#39;s a good place to start, and some of his books are\nfabulous: Samurai Invasion, Samurai Warriors, Samurai\nWarlords, to name a few. In other ways, he simply\ncashes in on what he can: Japanese Warfare from 1467;\nNinja (how can you say that ninja didn&#39;t walk around\nin black pajamas, then have every picture in the book\nbe of a skulking sneak in black pajamas?), etc. \n  \nMy own recommendations would be:\n\nGeorge Sansom&#39;s series: dated, some places inaccurate,\nbut the best overall overview of Japanese history out\nthere for under $500. \n\nMary Berry--Hideyoshi\n\nAnthony J. Bryant (I&#39;m not his agent, but should be).\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo! Mail - 250MB free storage. Do more.
