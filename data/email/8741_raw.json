It is the Samurai Archives Citadel- 3\n&quot;locations&quot; span=\r\nning 13 different Japanese history and culture related\nforums rolled into o=\r\nne giant community:\n\nhttp://samurai.threespursdesign.com/index.php\n\nHere ar=\r\ne a few of the locations within the Citadel:\n\nThe Genkan: The first stop fo=\r\nr new people joining the group, with info\non how the forum works, and where=\r\n you can ask technical forum\nquestions, &quot;how to...&quot; etc.\n\nSamurai History: =\r\nBasically, what we have here.\n\nAncient Japan: A forum for discussion of Jap=\r\nanese history through the\nHeian period - Hosted by Nagaeyari.\n\nArms and Arm=\r\nor: A forum for the discussion of arms and armor of the\nSamurai - Hosted by=\r\n Tony.\n\nJapanese Language: A forum for all questions and things related to =\r\nthe\nJapanese language - Also hosted by Tony.\n\nThe Bakumatsu: The latest par=\r\nt of the Tokugawa era, the Bakumatsu\nperiod is one of the most agitated and=\r\n romanticized part of Japanese\nhistory. It is the age of the last samurai, =\r\nof intense fighting\nbetween the pro-emperor ishin shishi from Satsuma and C=\r\nhoshu and the\npro-shogunate Shinsengumi troops.\n\nJapanese Entertainment: A =\r\nforum for all Japanese entertainment, music,\ndrama, movies, and anime.\n\nThe=\r\nre are also various goodies like Avatars and ranks based the number\nof post=\r\ns a person makes, and as forum Shogun, I can also bestow titles\nupon member=\r\ns at will.  The forum is brand new, so there are still many\nthings that wil=\r\nl be added and changed, but I invite everyone here to\ngo join up and see wh=\r\nat is there.\n\nThis yahoo group will continue to exist, as I know some peopl=\r\ne like to\nbe able to get and send emails, because it is easier than checkin=\r\ng\nwebsites, particularly at work. But definately go ahead and sign up at\nth=\r\ne Samurai Archives Citadel - it will eventually become the main\npoint of co=\r\nntact for all people interested in various aspects of Japan.  \n\n\n\n\n"
