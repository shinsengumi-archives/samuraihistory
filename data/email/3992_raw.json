It is \n&gt; more along the lines of they not being able to bear the shame that \nis forced upon \n&gt; them and thier families by all those who judge them, be it \nneighbors or other \n&gt; family members, etc.\n\nI agree with you 100%.  If we can agree that a lack of honor \n(dishonor) and shame are the same thing.  Webster says they are.  So \nI think were a looking at the same glass and describing the same \nstate in different terms.  \n\nTo clarify, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s honorable to commit suicide.  I think \nit is cowardly.  Even if it has something to do with honor.  Suicide \nis refusing to deal with problems that face us and choosing to run \naway from them.  It is not a solution, it is the ultimate escape.  \n\nTo me, suicide and seppuku are also different.  Suicide is as I have \ndescribed, while seppuku was an honorable death.  The problems were \ndealt with prior to choosing (or being volunteered for) seppuku.  \nSamurai society was vastly different then.  People could choose \nseppuku to show their integrity or show their strength of principles.  \nSuicide isn&#39;t normally committed in such terms.\n\nDid you hear about the chicken farmer that committed suicide last \nweek?  \n\nBrandon\n\n\n"
