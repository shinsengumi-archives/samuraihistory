I agree with you, I just watched his\n&gt; Bojustu DVD and I think he should be sued for what\n&gt; he\n&gt; says in that DVD. Lie after Lie. Lets get one thing\n&gt; straight - I know from your past quotes you know\n&gt; nothing really about The Bujinkan or Hayes or even\n&gt; Hatsumi. Hatsumi did not Teach Hayes everything he\n&gt; knows, It has been discussed openly on Bujinkan\n&gt; forums\n&gt; and its been pointed out that hayes has fabricated a\n&gt; large amount of information, he is also credited\n&gt; with\n&gt; inventing the straight sword theory. \n\nNo, nor do I claim to know. I study history--not\nmartial arts. \n\n&gt; Just because Hayes is in it does not mean it is bad.\n&gt; Again if you havent seen it why attack it.\n\nAs I&#39;ve said in another reply to you, I&#39;ve made 1 post\nregarding the documentary. I&#39;ve REPLIED to many posts\nnow with comments about Hayes. \n\n&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Budo Taijutsu?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend you see the film and train dogs,\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; martial arts. Not with a heart closed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Very insulting. Helly is a martial artist who so\n&gt; happens to be in Budo Taijutsu, so what. I suggest\n&gt; that you shut up , stop insuulting people you dont\n&gt; know, stop insulting material you have yet to see.\n&gt; As\n&gt; a moderator in this forum your behavior here is\n&gt; disgusting. In the past you have told people to stop\n&gt; such behavior and here you are - the sole cause of\n&gt; all\n&gt; insults.\n\nLearn to attribute the correct insult to the correct\nperson, my friend. Helly said what you quoted above to\nME, not the other way around. I quoted it in response\nto him to ask him what he was talking about. The only\nthing I&#39;ve said insulting to Helly, possibly, is\nquestioning his grasp of the English language--and\nsince he&#39;s a native of another country, it&#39;s not meant\nto be insulting. I simply had no idea what he said in\na certain passage. \n\n&gt; I am quite shocked at your comments and behavior,\n&gt; especially as you  are a moderator - not the what we\n&gt; would expect.\n\nAgain, learn to recognize who is typing what. Shall I\nrepost Helly&#39;s reply to me for you? Here you go: \n\n&quot;Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by the\nBudo Taijutsu? I recommend you see the film and train\ndogs, not martial arts. Not with a heart closed.&quot;\n\nI&#39;m still not sure I understand what the heck he&#39;s\ntalking about, at least in the first sentence. If\nyou&#39;re both members of the Budo Taijutsu, then please\nset your fellow martial artist straight about Hayes,\nfor one. Secondly, you can pass on to him that both of\nmy dogs are trained, though not in martial arts. Sit,\ndown, stay...these they can do. \n\nNOW, if there is any further issue with the above\nquote, then please direct it to me offline. \n\n\n\t\t\nDiscover Yahoo! \nStay in touch with email, IM, photo sharing and more.
