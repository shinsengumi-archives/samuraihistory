There seems to be a lot of conflicting \ninformation on Dousan. This &quot;Two Generation Theory&quot; (\u001b$BFsBe@b\u001b(B) is gainin\ng more momentum recently, I think. The common knowledge about \nDousan, while older are more established, is likely to be wrong, in \nmy opinion.\n\n&gt;(A quick and easy translation from Japanese - \u001b$B@o9q;~Be\u001b(B by \u001b$B6bC+=S0lO:\u001b(B \n&gt;2003 p.50-51)\n\n&gt;&quot;Saito Dousan&#39;s father Shinzaemonjou\nThis is likely to be Shinzaemon-no-jou, but it can be very hard to \nbe sure.\n\n&gt;at this time was known as Nagai Shinkurou Norihide, succeeded his \nDousan had a ton of names. If you are looking at this one, \u001b$BD90f?76eO:\u001b(B\n\u001b$BMx@/\u001b(B, it would be Norimasa, not Norihide\n\n&gt;Is it too much to ask for an english source or two??  :P\nIt probably is - which is, I would guess, why you make the English \nsources. :) But if you put &quot;dosan oil father&quot; (without the quotes) \ninto Google, a few sites pop up, including this one:\nhttp://www.sengoku-expo.net/text/person/E/054.html\n\n&gt;However the history book I&#39;m reading seems to be saying that his \n&gt;father was Nagai Shinzaemon, and I cant find any other sources to \n&gt;confirm or deny this, or the fact that it was dousan&#39;s father, and \n&gt;not dousan himself who was the oil merchant. \n\nThis is probably because historians (as a group) are in the middle of \nrevising the accepted theory. Just give it about 10 years or so and \nthings should be settled by then. :)\n\nFor now I personally am convinced of the Two Generation Theory, but \nunfortunately they don&#39;t make me the arbitor of these things....\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
