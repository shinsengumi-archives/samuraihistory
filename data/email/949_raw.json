Most of the OBs are in Japanese, but there are a\nlot of breakdowns of some of the more important Sengoku battles in the\nvarious Killer Katana supplements. Worth a look, definitely. \n\n&gt; By the way, I&#39;m as frustrated as Nuno on the use of Sashimono on \n&gt; Ashigaru, Turnbull&#39;s books continously contradict themselves in this\n\n&gt; respect -er, I know Tony Bryant&#39;s on this forum....his books are \n&gt; great!;-)\n\nThanks. &lt;G&gt;\n\nThe thing is, there&#39;s no real rule. Different clans operated\ndifferently. If you believe samurai films, *everyone* wore sashimono\n(&#39;cept the generals). My best guess is that nearly everyone did --\neven if they were rather smaller banners.\n\nTony\n\n"
