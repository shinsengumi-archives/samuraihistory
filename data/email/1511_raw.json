I don&#39;t \n&gt; think anyone is &quot;pissed off&quot;.  Some people just feel the \n&gt; need to correct perceived misinformation - some through \n&gt; educating, some more directly through less diplomatic \n&gt; means.  I tend to rely on the first method, but do enjoy \n&gt; the second method as well.  And I think I have at least a \n&gt; semi-valid point in my comparing a westerner saying &quot;I \n&gt; want to be a Samurai&quot; to a Japanese person saying &quot;I want \n&gt; to be a Confederate&quot;....  I also do think that the \n&gt; &#39;lifestyle&#39; is great, but it isn&#39;t a &quot;Samurai&quot; lifestyle. \n&gt;  If anything it is a Zen or Buddhist lifestyle; calling it \n&gt; a &quot;Samurai lifestyle&quot; is a fallacy and a bit farcical.\n&gt; Some people don&#39;t realize how odd they sound until they \n&gt; are shown things from another perspective, so I like to \n&gt; think I was facilitating that while only being marginally \n&gt; insulting  ;-)\n\n M.Nakazaki\n\n"
