While the \nbindings of the manuscripts also vary, the most common are ones with navy \nblue covers with designs of autumn grasses in gold pigment and attached with \nvermillion title slips that were sometimes called yomeiri-bon (&quot;trousseau \nbooks&quot;). The illustrations, provided on a single page or as a spread, may \ngenerally be grouped to those either executed in the so-called &quot;Nara-e \nstyle&quot; using inexpensive opaque pigment (doroenogu) or in a more delicately \nrendered luxurious style. Both styles employ the standardized composition of \nframing the top and bottom of the pictorial surface with trailing mist \n(suyari-gasumi). Vivid colors such as vermillion and green are combined with \nlavish uses of gold and silver foils and pigments in Nara ehon, not unlike \nminiatures.\n\n\nFor the best viewing experience, select the &quot;With Plug-in&quot; option.\nVisitor will need to download the free MrSID OnCuline Viewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
