The student is taking a class which he studies the topic \nof his choice for the entire school year.  One of the assignments is \nto interview someone knowledgeable about the topic.  He is studying \nthe lifestyles and ways of the samurai and ninja and their effect on \nthe feudal history of Japan.\n\nIs anyone interested in this request? Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n"
