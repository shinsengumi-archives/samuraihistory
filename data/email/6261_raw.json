I managed to catch it \nfor my Japanese history class and it was amazing. To me, no other film \nexhibited the economic and emotional difficulties of the samurai. Truth \nbe told, the tale explores more on the life of the lowly samurai hero \nand how reality has forced him to make great changes in his life. I \ncried at the end of this film. I can&#39;t help it, it was too sad, yet as \nan educated viewer, I knew that it was the right thing to do.\n\nOther than the review, for those who are interested  to me, this is one \nof the better Samurai movies out there since Akira Kurosawa. For fans of \nthe Shinsengumi, they&#39;re the group highlighted in this movie. Very \nmoving and a rather in-depth perspective of samurai life.\n\n- khursten\n\nKitsuno wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Sun 12 Dec 2004\n&gt;   \n&gt; A tale of humanity and heroism among the samurai elite\n&gt;\n&gt; FILM REVIEW\n&gt;\n&gt; ALLAN HUNTER\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; When The Last Sword Is Drawn (15)\n&gt;\n&gt; Director: Yojiro Takita\n&gt; Starring: Kiichi Nakai\n&gt; Running time: 138 minutes\n&gt;\n&gt; CROUCHING Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero are among the films that\n&gt; have broken down the resistance of British audiences to foreign-\n&gt; language fare. They may also have contributed to an unrealistic view\n&gt; of what Asian cinema has to offer.\n&gt;\n&gt; All pristine, perfectly composed images and eye-catching\n&gt; pyrotechnics, they suggest every martial arts film from the Far East\n&gt; sets out to dazzle. But unlike those lavish Chinese cinematic\n&gt; productions, the Japanese film When The Last Sword Is Drawn is much\n&gt; more traditional and has the satisfying sweep and sprawl of a good\n&gt; old-fashioned novel - which is hardly surprising given its roots in\n&gt; a bestseller by prizewinning author Jiro Asada.\n&gt;\n&gt; Structured around a series of flashbacks and blending the complex\n&gt; social history of 19th century Japan with more universal concerns of\n&gt; family, honour and class struggle, it often feels like a Japanese\n&gt; equivalent of Dr Zhivago or Gone With The Wind, displaying much in\n&gt; common with the cinema of Kurosawa and Oshima.\n&gt;\n&gt; The tale begins during the winter of 1899. An elderly man called\n&gt; Hajime Saito (Koichi Sato) arrives at a clinic seeking help for his\n&gt; sick grandson. A doctor offers assistance and Saito spots a photo of\n&gt; Kanichiro Yoshimura (Kiichi Nakai), a man he once despised and\n&gt; wanted to kill. The doctor (Takehiro Murata) also knew the man and\n&gt; his son and their conflicting memories of his true nature provide\n&gt; the basis for the story.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the 1860s, Saito and Yoshimura were both members of the\n&gt; celebrated Shinsengumi, an elite force of samurai dedicated to the\n&gt; defence of Kyoto. Saito considered himself to possess all the\n&gt; virtues of a samurai and thought Yoshimura little more than a\n&gt; country bumpkin whose mere presence was an insult to his dignity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yoshimura, however, was easily the best swordsman of his generation\n&gt; and was also dedicated to his family. He considered indignity a\n&gt; small price to pay if he could continue to provide for them. Thus,\n&gt; he accepted the jobs others shunned, demanded extra payment for acts\n&gt; of bravery and never flaunted his superiority. &quot;What kind of samurai\n&gt; is that?&quot; demanded one colleague.\n&gt;\n&gt; The doctor recalls an entirely different man; a devoted father and\n&gt; husband who did whatever was necessary to provide for his family and\n&gt; keep them alive. Gradually, as their memories converge, it becomes\n&gt; clear just what an extraordinary figure Yoshimura really was.\n&gt;\n&gt; The personal story at the core of When The Last Sword Is Drawn is\n&gt; played out against the shifting allegiances and social changes in\n&gt; the Japanese history of the period. Gunfire begins to make the sword\n&gt; a weapon of the past. Divisions within the Shinsengumi sow the seeds\n&gt; of its eventual destruction. There is an elegiac, end-of-era quality\n&gt; that carries echoes of such influential American westerns as The\n&gt; Wild Bunch and The Shootist.\n&gt;\n&gt; Director Yojiro Takita takes an understated approach: the film wears\n&gt; its beauty without ostentation. Confrontations are swift, brutal and\n&gt; bloody without becoming stylised. The flashbacks occasionally\n&gt; threaten to break the spell of the narrative, but what ultimately\n&gt; shines through is the humanity of the story as memories and\n&gt; incidents transform our understanding of an individual, revealing\n&gt; that heroism can take many forms and that even the bitterest rivals\n&gt; can eventually achieve mutual respect.\n&gt;\n&gt; On selected release from Friday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This article:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/thereview.cfm?id=1418732004\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
