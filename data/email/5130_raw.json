He ghost\nwrote a book called Ninjutsu history and traditons\nwhich was a butchered version of a book by his teacher\nHatsumi masaaki called Sengoku Ninpo Zukan which is a\nwonderful work on ninjutsu. Its a shame he wrote\nsomething that is only 50% accurate\n\nThe ninja were not all alike, in fact depending on\nthere location and period in history that each school\nexisited there skills could be greatly different. For\ninstance there is one school recorded that used young\ngirls to sleep with passing high ranking samurai to\nuse sex for information, they have no fighting skills.\nThen there are schools such as Iga ryu which would\nhave had amassive variety of skills fomr Taijutsu\n(jujutsu) to spear, sword, maybe even explosives at\nsome point. \n\nAs for holding doors open.\n\nMany of these schools would have had items they could\nuse for opening doors such as the kunai, and also\nmetal spikes that could lock a door shut ot keep it\nopen by &#39;nailing&#39; it into place.\n\nCaltrops when made of metal are called Tetsubishi and\nwhen dropped always fall with one spike upwards. there\nare also natural plant seeds that worked the same\n(forgot the name). \n\nMany ninja things are not exclusive to the ninja.\nSamurai would involve the same items as well if\nneeded. Also some skills are not solely ninja only.\nFor instance the negoro ryu of Ninjutsu was a school\nthat specialised in the use of the gun, but so did\nsome samurai schools. This school just made itself a\nspecialist in this field. \n\nToday ninjutsu is as good as dead, there are many good\nhistorians and even some practioners in the modern\naspects of the art. What can be classed as old style\nninjutsu is long gone, and I speak of this as an\ninstructor of the Bujinkan dojo which pushed the\nNinjutsu boom in the 80&#39;s. It is a long time now since\nI pushed ninjutsu aside and just look on it now as a\narea of interest for reading. I prefer the samurai\naspects of the bujinkan\n\nAnything you see in a western movie that involves\nninja is as good as 95% inaccurate, japanese movies\netc are also not accurate.\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n--- samurai_dokoro &lt;samurai_dokoro@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nI read the ten misconceptions about the samurai. the\none that talks \nabout the ninjas fascinated me. it&#39;s only now that i\nlearned that \nninja-to swords are of hollywood creation, and so did\ni learn that \nninjas do not only rely on shuriken for throwing barbs\nbut also use \nknives, etc. my question is that is it really true\nthat ninjas also \nuse steel bars to pry open shut and locked doors? is\nit also true \nthat they use caltrops to injure or even kill their\npursuers?  \n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
