The thing that&#39;s a huge kick for me about that scene is\n&gt; Kurosawa&#39;s attention to detail. Watch it carefully. Heihachi, in the\n&gt; BACKGROUND, begins counting on his fingers when the date is mentioned.\n&gt; Then he gets a confused look on his face. When Kanbei says &quot;Kikuchiyo&quot;\n&gt; must be thirteen, he&#39;s the first one who explodes with laughter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Yahoo!
