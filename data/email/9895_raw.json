Similarly, I never got the \nimpression tha=\r\nt Saigo wanted to rebel against the Imperial Government that \nhe had helped=\r\n install, but his sense of honor would not let him abandon his \nfollowers.\n=\r\n\n     Lastly, Satsuma is one of the most &quot;southern&quot; provinces in Japan!\n\nBo=\r\nb Burke\n\n\nIn a message dated 4/18/09 1:59:53 PM, joemaps@... writ=\r\nes:\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, exactly. I&#39;ve thought of that parallel too. In par=\r\nticular, there\n&gt; is a similar type of &quot;lost cause&quot; romanticism about the Co=\r\nnfederate Army\n&gt; and Saigo&#39;s army. Both Saigo and Lee revolted against the =\r\ncentral\n&gt; government, but both are now revered in prominent statues. Both o=\r\nf them\n&gt; are thought of as having high moral character, worthy of emulation=\r\n. And\n&gt; both rebellions figure prominently in films and TV shows. The Boshi=\r\nn\n&gt; War is like the War of Independence, and the Satsuma Rebellion is like\n=\r\n&gt; the Civil War. Saigo played both Washington and Lee, who were both from\n&gt;=\r\n Virginia.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@samuraihistosam, burker1@...=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always seen parallels between the Satsuma Rebellion of=\r\n 1877 and\n&gt; the US\n&gt; &gt; Civil War, with Saigo Takamori playing the role of t=\r\nhe Japanese Robert\n&gt; E.\n&gt; &gt; Lee.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Both wars resulted in each country=\r\n having a strong central government.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In a message=\r\n dated 4/17/09 9:55:04 PM, joemaps@... writes:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am often struck by a number of parallels between US and Japanes=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; history. For example, the role of the Meiji Restoration leaders\n&gt; s=\r\neems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; analogous to the founding fathers of the US. Toshimichi Okubo\n&gt; =\r\nstrikes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me as a Thomas Jefferson type of character. Saigo Takamori re=\r\nminds\n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of George Washington.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The analogies are not, o=\r\nf course, perfect. But they are strong\n&gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be interesting. Th=\r\nis evening I was comparing the Battle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sekigahara (East vs West) wi=\r\nth the Battle of Gettysburg (North vs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; South). These are the two key l=\r\narge domestic battles in both\n&gt; countries&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; histories. I was surprised=\r\n to learn how close the troop numbers\n&gt; were.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At Gettysburg, it was 9=\r\n3K (north) vs 71K (south). At Sekigahara, it\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 88K (east) vs 81K =\r\n(west). How coincidental that such analogous\n&gt; battles\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had troop numb=\r\ners that were so comparable!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; **=\r\n********** *\n&gt; &gt; Access 350+ FREE radio stations anytime from anywhere on t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; web.
