From your description it is\n&gt; very hard to say \n&gt; anything at all about your sword, however if you can\n&gt; share some \n&gt; pictures with us there are people on the list who\n&gt; are happy to share \n&gt; their knowledge. You&#39;ll need several photos; one of\n&gt; the whole sword in \n&gt; it&#39;s scabbard, one of the naked tang/signature, one\n&gt; of the backside of \n&gt; the tang, and if possible one of the first five or\n&gt; six inches above the \n&gt; hamachi and one of the kissaki (preferably a close\n&gt; up showing the \n&gt; hamon). Kantei from photos is always pretty dicey\n&gt; but as I said we are \n&gt; happy to share what we can.\n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; PS the powder is likely uchiko which is used to\n&gt; clean the blade...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
