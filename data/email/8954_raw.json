To be honest, I don&#39;t \nbelieve in the fact that there have been *any* greeks or romans who ever \nreached Japan. In fact, if they did, and there was written or spoken \nrecord of that, it sure would be a sensation.\n\nAnd the fact that you say you recovered the records in Hungry of the \nOttoman Empire (around 1500) when nobody in Europe had ever heared any \n*correct* information on Japan (or am I mistaken here?)... makes it in \nfact interesting.\n\nCould you please tell us your sources? Any other things that could help? \nAnd from which sources did you take your folk tales? VERY important to \nknow... Please, enlighten us, or we&#39;re forced to assume your either \nkidding us or fell for some very... insecure sources.\n\nThomas\n\nsmrabbitry@... wrote:\n&gt; Basically the man brought a few of his select solders to learn more fighting techniques. What I&#39;m looking for is old scrolls of travels and documentation. \n&gt;\n&gt; This man interest me because I&#39;ve followed his tales starting in Greece and Rome, to all parts of the world, over a very LONG time. It can&#39;t all be the same person, offspring I&#39;m guessing. I&#39;ve lost the story in Japan. At least the written story. I picked it up again in Hungry during the 1500&#39;s, but there is still mention of him training with the Samurai and personally protecting the emperor for some times.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway. I&#39;ll find it. Was just wondering if anyone had heard any folk tales, seen any paintings or art referencing a white or silver haired Samurai or any thing around that time period.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; EB\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
