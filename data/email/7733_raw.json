He was playing\nwith the Katana ( that is the best description of what\nhe was doing ) and he damaged the edge.   So he put\nthe sword on sell and I bought it.   It is around 3\nand a half pounds heavier than a normal Iaito, but it\nis ok ( my arms are getting stronger, imagine what I\ncan do with a Iaito !!! ).\nBefore I kill the sharpenes from the edge, I can tell\nyou that when I pass a sheet of paper on the mono-\nuchi of the blade, when I was close to the final of\nthe mono- uchi I have to stop before cutting my\nfingers.   \nIn a scale from 1 to 10 on sharpenes for comercial\nswords, I give Hanwei swords a 9.\nIf you have one, my advice is : do not play with it. \nIt is a weapon (or mean to replay a weapon ) and is\nprimary objective is to kill people.\nJapanese swords are beauty to see, to handle and to\ncut with it; but always keep in mind that it is a\nweapon.  Be respectful with it, because it will remind\nyou.\nAbout the ability of the swordsman, I can tell you\nthis old japanese saying : &quot;An excellent Katana will\ncry in the hands of a bad samurai&quot;...\nSo if you are training, train hard.   And if you are\ntraining hard, train harder.   There is always\nsomething new to learn.\n\nBest regards to all.       \n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n"
