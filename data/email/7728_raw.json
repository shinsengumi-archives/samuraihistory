I dont\nknow what it is but there is just something missing.\n\nHowever saying this I personally do use a chen sword\nwhen I am training japanese swordsmanship.\n\nWhy do I do this, its easy because I would rather\ndamage a sword I can replace within 48 hours than\ndamage a sword made by someone who died a 100 years\nago and will never be replaced.\n\nIf your after a chen I like the musashi but I had the\ntsuka on mine cut down as its way too ong. once cut\ndown it improved the balance and feel\n\npaul\n\n\n--- james wallis &lt;kentguy212002@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nOk I see it as this, A poor blade can compromise even\nthe best swordsman, Yet holding a &#39;good&#39; blade and\nhaving little or no knowledge is fatal, The sword is\nan instrument it&#39;s only as good as it&#39;s owner...\n\njames wilson &lt;johntwo8@...&gt; wrote:Hello all how\nis every one?
