A low-ranking office worker in a late-19th-century \nJapanese \n&gt; village, the widowed Seibei spends his spare time caring for his \n&gt; beloved young daughters and elderly mother. Potential romance \nenters \n&gt; the picture when recently divorced former childhood friend Tomoe \n&gt; (Rie Miyazawa) seeks to reconnect with Seibei. The only problem is \n&gt; Tomoe&#39;s abusive, hard-drinking ex, a high-ranking samurai who&#39;s \n&gt; determined to challenge Seibei to a duel.\n&gt; \n&gt; While his film concludes with an intense action sequence, director \n&gt; Yamada lavishes far greater attention on the rhythms of daily life \n&gt; during a period of dramatic sociopolitical upheaval. Star Sanada, \n&gt; who followed &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot; with a prominent supporting \nrole \n&gt; in the Tom Cruise epic &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; gives a particularly \n&gt; wrenching, textured performance as the decent family man torn \n&gt; between his personal wishes and professional obligations. \n&gt; Interesting interviews with actor Sanada and director Yamada \n&gt; comprise the disc&#39;s only extras, but the film supplies sufficient \n&gt; rewards in its own right to justify its purchase price.\n\n\nDid I forget to tell you what I though about it?\n\nMaikeru\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
