The\n&gt; trouble was that he decided to take Ueda-jo, and\n&gt; missed the battle at Sekigahara altogether.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; So he was supposed to pass by, but keep Sanada in\n&gt; &gt; check (like a fake pass in football)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Um, yeah, though not sure I agree with that football\n&gt; reference. It wasn&#39;t a misdirection kind of\n&gt; thing--he\n&gt; didn&#39;t fake one way, and go another. It&#39;s more like \n&gt; he was supposed to send the fullback to block the\n&gt; linebacker (Sanada), but sent the whole offensive\n&gt; line.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- Michael &lt;takayama_hara@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am having trouble with the exact meaning of\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; term\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; book &quot;Sekigahara 1600 - The final struggle for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power&quot;.
