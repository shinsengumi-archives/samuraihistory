Can&#39;t imagine why not, but alas. That said,\nI don&#39;t think things changed significantly before,\nduring, or after the Muromachi. Most of your movies\nfocusing on either the Sengoku-Jidai (tail end of the\nMuromachi anyways) or even as far back as the Gempei\nWar would be worth checking out to get ideas and feel.\n&#39;Ran&#39;, &#39;Kagemusha&#39;, &#39;Fuurin Kazan&#39; (in the States as\n&#39;Samurai Banners&#39;), etc. all have scenes that take\nplace in military camps. The best visual\nrepresentation would likely be in Taiga drama--1996&#39;s\nHideyoshi, for example, probably has one or two camp\nscenes per episode. 1997&#39;s Mori Motonari, 1990(?)\nNobunaga, King of Zipangu, or the Tokugawai Aoi Sandai\nor Toshiie to Matsu (forget the years) would all be\nfairly recent ones that should have many many scenes\nthat would help to give you an idea. \n\nIf there is a Japanese food store or market near you,\nthey may have video rentals (I watched half of Toshiie\nto Matsu&#39;s 50 episodes in 2 weeks when I was in Kansas\nCity for business one time) where you can find these. \n\n\n\n\n--- kuroi_uma_samurai &lt;kuroi_uma_samurai@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;m a new member of this website. I&#39;m looking for\n&gt; pictures of what \n&gt; the tents looked like during the Muromachi Period. \n&gt; Can anyone out \n&gt; there provide me with websites or films that I can\n&gt; go to which will \n&gt; show me what samurai and lords stayed in while on \n&gt; campaign or \n&gt; traveling. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
