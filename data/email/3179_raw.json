It was the capital of the Mino\nprovince. It&#39;s up on Inabayama (it&#39;s a heck of a walk\nto the top, trust me). What else are you looking for?\n\nInuyama-jo is also in the same area, just north of\nNagoya. It&#39;s the only castle still owned by a private\nfamily, and is one of the few that are still original\n(most were bombed out in WWII) and is the only one\nthat is original AND predates the Tokugawa period,\nhaving been constructed in the late 1400&#39;s. \n\nNate\n\n--- undergroundrace &lt;undergroundrace@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; Can anyone tell me something about the following\n&gt; castles:\n&gt; 1.Iwadono-jo(I&#39;m not sure it existed)\n&gt; 2.Odawara-jo\n&gt; 3.Kofu-jo\n&gt; 4.Gifu-jo\n&gt; 5.Inuyama-jo\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help will be appreciated.Thanks,Edy.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
