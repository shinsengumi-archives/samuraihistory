Another example of its use is \nin the term Musha Shugyo.  Which I see most commonly translated \nas &quot;Warrior Pilgramage&quot;.  It is when a warrior travels all over the \nplace training with different teachers and/or challenging other \nwarriors to duels to improve their skills.  It was very common \n(Compared to earlier times, although it did happen before)in the \nTokugawa period when samurai had little else to, and the ones that \ntook their training seriously saw the extended peace as an \nenivronment in which to travel and perfect their skills.  Actually \nthere are some martial artists that still do this today, although \nvery rare (and trains with different teachers, but the challenge part \nhas died off for obvious reasons).  \n\n\n"
