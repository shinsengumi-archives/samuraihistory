Izasa Ienao (1486-1588), \nfounder of Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto ryu, is said to have \nbeen 7th headmaster of this school. The 19th headmaster, \nHasegawa Chikaranosuke Eishin Hidenobu, was also 7th \nheadmaster of Hayashizaki&#39;s Shimmei Muso ryu. He taught \nboth styles under the name of Muso Jikiden Eishin ryu or \nHasegawa Eishin ryu. \n\nOkuden is directly attributed to Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu, \nie we have gone full circle, but the masters of the Shimmei \nMuso Ryu also founded their own ryu, so it&#39;s likely they have \ninfluenced the ryu since its foundation.\n\nShimmei Muso Ryu masters include Tamiya Heibei Shigemasu, \nthe founder of the Tamiya Ryu, the Shin Tamiya Ryu, Jikyo Ryu \nand Mugai Ryu. Nagano Muraku founded the Muraku Ryu. \nIchinomiya Sadayu Terunobu founded the Ichinomiya Ryu.\n\nThus Hakudo would have been influenced by all these ryu in \npassing on his own teachings.\n\nAs to the curriculum of the Shindo Munen Ryu, I cannot say, but \nit teaches iaijutsu, kenjutsu and jojutsu. From the photos one \nmight discern that their techniques are closer to -jutsu than \n-do styles, that is they are more concerned with combative \ntechnique than aesthetic style.\n\n(A very broad and inaccurate description of the difference \nbetween -jutsu and -do is that in the former anything goes, \nspitting, gouging, scratching, kicking and punching - the point \nbeing to bring your opponent down. It doesn&#39;t have to be neat \nand tidy, just effective - as someone once said, &#39;any landing \nyou walk away from is a good landing&#39;.)\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
