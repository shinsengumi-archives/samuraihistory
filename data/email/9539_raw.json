The Takeda\n&gt; &gt; struggled on for\n&gt; &gt; another 7 years - albeit heavily reduced in power -\n&gt; &gt; and the losses\n&gt; &gt; suffered in the battle probably had a lot more to do\n&gt; &gt; with Katsuyori\n&gt; &gt; being heavily outnumbered and in a poor strategic\n&gt; &gt; position than the use\n&gt; &gt; of rifles by Nobunaga.\n&gt;\n&gt;Poor operational and tactical position, actually.\n&gt;Looking at the battle in the terms of long term\n&gt;effects isn&#39;t where the importance of this battle\n&gt;lies; the beauty (speaking as a military officer) is\n&gt;the design of the Oda plan, integrating terrain and\n&gt;man-made obstacles with the firearms to defeat the\n&gt;strength of the opponent. Taking into account recent\n&gt;research which indicates that the Oda had 1,000, not\n&gt;3,000, arquebuses, and that at most 3 ranks could have\n&gt;shot in the time it took the Takeda to move from the\n&gt;woodline, across the Rengogawa, and up to the Oda\n&gt;palisades (thus nullifying the common image of\n&gt;&quot;rotating&quot; fire mowing down the Takeda, since it\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t have actually done more than one &quot;rotation&quot;),\n&gt;Nobunaga&#39;s use of terrain is that much more\n&gt;impressive.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Takeda themselves had\n&gt; &gt; rifles, and I fancy\n&gt; &gt; that they weren&#39;t idiotic enough to ride straight in\n&gt; &gt; to a wave of\n&gt; &gt; gunfire ala the Nagashino scene in &#39;Kagemusha&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;No one at this time had &quot;rifles&quot;, as they hadn&#39;t been\n&gt;invented yet. The arquebus was a smoothbore weapon.\n&gt;And while the Nagashino scene in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; is\n&gt;completely ridiculous, do not discount the effect of a\n&gt;cavalry charge against unprotected arquebusiers. These\n&gt;weren&#39;t machine guns, or even, as I said, rifles--one\n&gt;shot, then you&#39;ve got to take a significant amount of\n&gt;time to reload. The distances involved clearly show\n&gt;that even with 3 ranks firing &quot;in rotation&quot;, at most\n&gt;each rank got one shot off before the Takeda closed\n&gt;the distance. Hardly a British gun square from the\n&gt;Zulu Wars. Ordinarily, arquebus ashigaru weren&#39;t\n&gt;behind palisades--at best they had nagaeyari (long\n&gt;spears) protecting them, similiar to a European pike\n&gt;and shot formation, but in 1575 this wasn&#39;t\n&gt;necessarily standard yet. Add in the aura of the\n&gt;Takeda Cavalry, and the fact that most ashigaru\n&gt;(before Nobunaga made them a major factor in battle,\n&gt;anyways) were poorly trained and disciplined, and\n&gt;there was no real reason for the Takeda to expect they\n&gt;couldn&#39;t succeed.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Katsuyori may not have\n&gt; &gt; been as talented as his father, but I&#39;m sure he\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t as big a fool as\n&gt; &gt; he tends to get credited for either.\n&gt;\n&gt;See above. Correct.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Still, it probably is the most famous battle\n&gt; &gt; post-Kamakura, except for\n&gt; &gt; maybe Sekigahara, which is far more interesting in\n&gt; &gt; my opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt;If what you want is political repercussions, see\n&gt;Sekigahara. Tactically, it bores me, while Nagashino\n&gt;fascinates me. No one ever talks about the Sakai\n&gt;Tadatsugu raid behind the Takeda, or the actual siege\n&gt;of Nagashino itself--fascinating maneuvers. The Takeda\n&gt;operation was sound, actually, had the traitor in\n&gt;Okazaki Castle not been uncovered.\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Tired of spam?
