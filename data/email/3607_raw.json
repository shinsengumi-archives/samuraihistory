I hope they will add in a =\r\npositive manner to this\nconversation.\n\n  May it please the fellow list memb=\r\ners (smile)\n\n  ---\n  1. Did samurai exist before they were made into a clas=\r\ns?\n  ---\n  It depends on your concept of Samurai. This step supercedes mere=\r\n lexical\nspeculation. Defining a term avoids ambiguity and rhetoric usage o=\r\nf words\n(&quot;doublespeak&quot;, as in &quot;1984&quot;). For this brief discussion, I hold &quot;S=\r\namurai&quot;\nas a social class, and, hence, any statement containing to members =\r\nof a\nSamurai class before its ascension unto a social class cannot be consi=\r\ndered\nvalid. If you define &quot;Samurai&quot; as &quot;retainer&quot;, then there were members=\r\n of a\nSamurai class before it was turned into a social class. What should b=\r\ne\navoided, if possible, is the usage of the word &quot;Samurai&quot; with both meanin=\r\ngs,\nunder a single context.\n\n  ---\n  2. Why is legitimacy by the government=\r\n so important to the abolishment of\nthe class of samurai?\n  ---\n  Please co=\r\nnsider the &quot;Language Systems&quot; Philosophical School of Thought, if\nyou will.=\r\n Think of any given &quot;due process of law&quot; - if the highest court in\na countr=\r\ny utters &quot;the sky is yellow&quot;, no matter any what other language (as\nthe sci=\r\nentific) holds, the sky is yellow, because the State will have the\npower to=\r\n enforce the ruling. Will it make the sky turn yellow before other\nlanguage=\r\n systems (as the ones pertaining to human perception)? Definitely\nnot. Howe=\r\nver, the given State may enforce the ruling, for, before the Legal\nLanguage=\r\n System, &quot;the sky is yellow&quot;.\n  That=B4s why the person uttering the langua=\r\nge is so important: dynamic\nvalidity arises from the utterance process and =\r\nuttering person. Static\nvalidity - the contents of the ruling - is assessed=\r\n at a later stage. Sure,\nthis may be unjust, unfair, incorrect and ineffici=\r\nent - however valid,\nnonetheless.\n  Such School of Thought, although suppor=\r\nted by many researchers, is not an\nunanimity. Please do not take me as a ze=\r\nalot for it, but it is an\ninteresting tool of investigation which should be=\r\n considered.\n  ---\n  3. Why did some samurai families hide their swords ins=\r\ntead of obeying the\ngovernment?\n  ---\n  Sorry, I do not hold enough data in=\r\n order to address this topic.\n  ---\n  4. When the WW II officers carried sw=\r\nords did they, the military, or\nanyone else consider them samurai?\n  ---\n  =\r\nAgain, sorry, but I do not hold enough data in order to address this\ntopic.=\r\n\n\n\n\n  Again, I hope those ideas are proper to this tread.\n\n  Cheers,\n\n  Thi=\r\nago\n\n\n\n  ---\n  From: Chris Ketterling\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n=\r\n  Sent: Wednesday, February 04, 2004 5:43 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Tr=\r\nying to learn\n\n\n\n\n\n  I&#39;m trying to grasp the whole &quot;There are no Samurai&quot; a=\r\nrgument by patching\nup some holes in my thought process.\n\n  1. Did samurai =\r\nexist before they were made into a class?\n\n  2. Why is legitimacy by the go=\r\nvernment so important to the abolishment of\nthe class of samurai?\n\n  3.
