The matchlock:\nwhich bcame very prevelant in the late sengoku Jidai\nand was the common weapon for the ashigaru or\nfootsoldier\n\n Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; During the Segoku Jidai their were many weapons used\n&gt; by the Samurai.  Here are a few:\n&gt; \n&gt; Bow with various arrow heads\n&gt; Naginata:  Sort of a sword blad on a long\n&gt; pole(glave)\n&gt; Yari:  Spear which could vary depending on your\n&gt; position.  Samurai usually carried a shorter single\n&gt; combat version for on horse back or single combat. \n&gt; Ahigaru(foot soldiers) often times used a very long\n&gt; version used en masse against calvary or other\n&gt; troops.\n&gt; Stephen Turnbull has an excellent description of\n&gt; this\n&gt; in his book &quot; Samurai Sourcebook&quot;.\n&gt; Katana:  The sword carried by the samurai on his\n&gt; left\n&gt; side blade up(in earlier periods such as kamakura it\n&gt; was worn tachi style with the blade down from a\n&gt; sling\n&gt; of sorts) This wewapon was not the main weapon on\n&gt; the\n&gt; battle field for the samurai as was usually thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; This weapon could be considered secondary to the\n&gt; yari.\n&gt; Tanto:  This knife was carried in place of the short\n&gt; sword called the wakizashi while wearing armor. \n&gt; This\n&gt; weapon was used in hanbd-tohand combat and could\n&gt; also\n&gt; be used to take the head of your enemy.  Last resort\n&gt; weapon.\n&gt; No-dachi:  Not a very popular weapon during the\n&gt; sengoku-Jidai but was seen.  This is essentially a\n&gt; really long katana.  Sometimes as long as 6 feet. \n&gt; Thought this was unusual.  Used more like a naginata\n&gt; than a sword it could be used against a man on horse\n&gt; back.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is a small list of the major weapons and you\n&gt; can\n&gt; find more in almost any book but i would highly\n&gt; recommend if you want good pictures and descriptions\n&gt; you pick up any anthony J. Bryant book, or any\n&gt; stephen\n&gt; turnbull book on the samurai subject.  Also Arms and\n&gt; Armour of the Samurai by A.P. Bottomley and\n&gt; Thompson. \n&gt; These are all good basics books on samurai arms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Musashi\n&gt; --- Edwin Angulo &lt;mayalan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  My name is Edwin, I am from mexico, i am an\n&gt; &gt; archaeologist, and i`m researching about the\n&gt; &gt; sengoku-jidai, i wonder, have any of you a list of\n&gt; &gt; weapons used by the warriors of this age?, or\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; any book in which i can found this information?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Thanks!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Edwin Angulo Torres.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Buy the perfect holiday gifts at Yahoo!
