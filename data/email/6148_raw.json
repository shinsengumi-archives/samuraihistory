I find it curious that,\n&gt; assuming you are a \n&gt; Chinese emperor, you are so insistent upon using an\n&gt; article.\n\nTouche. Most of the time I dish it out, but I can\nhandle receiving some sarcasm...sometimes...I\nthink...I can, really...no, really...I don&#39;t want to\nslam this guy...no, I don&#39;t...stop it! I won&#39;t let you\ntake over, Evil Nate! \n\nThere, that&#39;s better.\n\n&gt; Perhaps I was misunderstood: I meant, a movie\n&gt; treating the subject \n&gt; that was less than two hours, in English, not\n&gt; subtitled.  \n\nAnd people ask my why comma usage is so important. :)\n\nThere are several documentaries out there, but I\ncouldn&#39;t pass you the title of the reputable ones. I\nbelieve there was one that Tony was a consultant for,\nso he may know. Any of the ones that came out\nregarding the Last Samurai were faulty. \n\n&gt; I&#39;m going to extrapolate that the end of the Ming\n&gt; Dynasty&#39;s ability \n&gt; to extend themselves through naval power probably\n&gt; coincided with a \n&gt; rise in Japanese fortunes?  Any evidence to this\n&gt; effect in Japanese \n&gt; history, from 1433-1470 or so?\n\nNope. Japan and China never competed directly in the\nopen seas, precisely because neither of them cared to.\nThe concept didn&#39;t ever really occur to the Japanese,\nat least not until the Portuguese came around. Ieyasu\ntoyed with ships, but nothing more. China&#39;s decision\nwas an internal political decision--several ministers\nwere upset at the growing power of the eunuchs in the\nImperial regime. One of the most powerful and famous\neunuchs happened to be the Admiral who led all the\nEmperor&#39;s sea expeditions. In their effort to curb the\nEunuchs&#39; power, they convinced the Emperor to forbid\nsea expeditions. Sounds horribly short sighted, but,\nwell, it was. \n \n\n Er, \n&gt; excuse me, was I musing out loud again?  \n\nYes, but if you have the website, it sounds like\nwonderful reading :)\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours do?\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
