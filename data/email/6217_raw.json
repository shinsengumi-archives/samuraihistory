I&#39;d be happy to help, although I&#39;m no a professional \nhistorian, but an amateur who has studied some Religions History. By \nthe way, are you familiar with our Mircea Eliade?\n\n  Sorry for digressing, but I think the knowledge has to be shared \nboth ways, and since I am a beginner regarding Japan... :)\n\n\n  Respectfully,\n\n  Gabriel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
