I mean, as a class, certainly, the Samurai \ndisappeared a century and a quarter plus ago, sure.  But what they stood for, \ncould that not be still around today?  Such as living with honor?\n       I mean, here&#39;s an example from another walk of life: In his book \n&quot;Bound By Honor&quot;, Bill Bonnano (son of legendary La Cosa Nostra boss Joe Bonnano) \nmakes a very real distinction between &quot;A Mafioso&quot; and &quot;mafioso.&quot;  The first is \na &quot;made&quot; member of La Cosa Nostra, what we call the &quot;Mafia&quot; or the &quot;Mob,&quot; and \nmay or may not be &quot;mafioso.&quot;  Mafioso, with a &quot;small&quot; &quot;m&quot;, Bonnano describes \nas being about respect and honor, and has nothing to do with gender: &quot;A \nbeautiful, proud woman can be said to be mafioso&quot; (introduction, pg xiv).  Bluntly, \nhe goes on to describe mafioso as having to do with honor that comes from the \nrespect of places: yours and the other person&#39;s.  A crime against honor \n(picking on the weak, for example) is not tolerated, and revenge (notice, I did not \nsay &quot;justice&quot;) is extracted.  (Granted, La Cosa Nostra were, essentially, \nillegal, whilst the Samurai were VERY legal, and this difference is, of course, \nnoted.)\n       I may just be another babbling idiot, but does this make any sense at \nall and is this of any value?  Am I at least on the right track?\n       Back to the Netherrealm.  If I don&#39;t write again before then, have \nwonderful Christmas seasons, y&#39;hear?  8-)\n\nLater\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
