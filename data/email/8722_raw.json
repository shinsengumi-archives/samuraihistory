It&#39;s called sarcasm. Look into it. \n\nThe samurai class was abolished in the early 1870&#39;s.\nThey don&#39;t exist by act of law. Someone who was a\nsamurai in 1870 was no longer a samurai in 1877\nbecause the government of Japan said so. A simple\ngoogle search would turn this information up in about\n5 seconds. \n\nHowever, you could also look here--I suggest you do\nso, and quickly:\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\n\nIt&#39;s required reading before posting on this email\nlist. And you obviously didn&#39;t read it\nbeforehand--please do so now. \n\nThanks,\n\nThe Mgmt.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
