The  swastikas are not\nswastikas .  They are the reverse of the German swastikas. In Japan, it\nis a\nBuddhist symbol. They are also found in the Southwest area of the United\nStates on Indian pottery. Japanese swordsmiths never did gold engraving\non\nblades. Again, it is not worth the trouble to restore it since it is\nbadly\nmade.\n \n---------------\n \n \nSooo,What are you trying to tell us? Were you going to show this Sword or\nwhat?  Kee...\n \n\n No, not at all. It&#39;s not my sword, and I hadn&#39;t seen one like it. He\ndidn&#39;t pay that much for it, so it&#39;s unfortunate, but at least someone is\nable to tell the difference. I haven&#39;t held it, or seen it in person, and\njust wanted to know what the story was about it, not having seen one\nbefore, like that. I think my Iaito is also a Taiwan blade, not worth a\nlot, but it was a gift from my Sensei, so that&#39;s all it needs to be for\nme. This one, my friend just picked up at some sale in the West Bottoms\nin Kansas City. Does anyone know what the reverse swatstikas signify? I\nhadn&#39;t seen them, either, but then, I don&#39;t do a lot of looking, a sword\nis not something I&#39;m into collecting, if it isn&#39;t functional, it&#39;s not\nworth much to me. It&#39;s too bad, I think he had hoped it was a treasure,\nbut that&#39;s clearly not the case. \nI really appreciate the information, though. I have no investment\nemotionally or financially, in the katana, but I promised him I&#39;d ask til\nI found out what the story about the sword was. As a friend. It&#39;s great\nthat there are so many knowledgeable people on this list, I got nowhere\nasking on E Budo. My sincere thanks to you that helped me with the\ninformation.\n\nsincerely\nSharon Hayakawa\n\n\n\n"
