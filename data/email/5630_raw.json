Only two hours by train from Tokyo, it houses\nIeyasu&#39;s mausoleum, located in the forest above the very impressive\nToshogu Shrine(which also houses a Kendo dojo where you can view\ntraining).  \n&gt; If in Tokyo, a trip to Kamakura is a must.  Despite the electricity\nand telephone cables that dog any modern Japanese townscape, Kamakura\ncan be a treat with its temples and shrines, at one which (the\nEngakuji) you can often see practitioners of Kyudo at work. \n&gt; Then if you&#39;re going to Kyoto you could stop at Hamamatsu and see\nthe site of Ieyasu&#39;s Shussejyo (although it is again a post-War\nreproduction. Hamamatsu is more of interest if you like Japanese\nmotorbikes though I found.  \n&gt; Have a good time. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m about to start planning (again) a 3-week trip to Japan.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m interested primarily in Tokugawa Ieyasu (pre-Edo), and Mikawa\n(as was) \n&gt; in general - say between Sumpu and Gifu (sorry for the old names).\nIt&#39;s more \n&gt; &#39;look n feel&#39; than anything else, although I&#39;m quite aware that\nJapan has \n&gt; changed and looking for Sengoku Mikawa might be like looking for \n&gt; Shakespeare&#39;s London ... gone a long time ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; All this is aid of atmosphere for my Sengoku blockbuster, so a view,\nor a \n&gt; stretch of the Tokaido as was, or anything that might say &#39;this is\nwhat it was \n&gt; like&#39; is the main intent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having said that, festivals are OK, demonstrations are better -\niaido/jutsu the \n&gt; best.\n&gt; \n&gt; So any ideas for packing a lifetime&#39;s experience in one trip?\n&gt; \n&gt; And what time of year is best?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
