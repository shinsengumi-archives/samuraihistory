The thing is you \nsee I have recently been having a problem with faith, you see, not in \nthe religious way at all. But to do with the samurai of the past, \nsometimes I want to believe all what is written about these great \npeople, sometimes it seems to be just exagerated, these historical \nfigures are like characters literally in a game or movie, Nobunaga \nthe cruel, dominant stiffled dictator, Hideyoshi- the rags to riches \nstory, or should that be the ashigaru to daimyo story. whatever. \nTokugawa Ieyasu the man who ate the cake, took the glory.  If you go \nfurther back you have Yoshitsune the tragic hero, Benkkei the warrior \nmonk who accomplished amazing feats. I know in the history of all \ncountries all have their heroes, in British history we have the \ncharge of the light brigade the victory against the armada. But I \ndon&#39;t think their are really any mythological characters. I am not an \nexpert but sometimes I think why I am drawn to Japan is that the \nhistory is all around Japanese society even the cities of Japan are \nsometimes based on the names of feudal era castles, or vice versa.  \nPopular authors who we all read like master Stephen Turnbull \nconstantly are giving this rosy view somemight say corny blossom \nview, but I understand Japan is a bit like this sometimes the poems \nare mostly very tragic, all or nothing affairs. All I am saying is \nthat the truth is sometimes very much distorted. What got me thinking \nlike this is that 1. I read a certain book, 2. I read George Sansoms \nbook )much more realistic I think.3. I have been looking at Japanese \nmaps studying place names, seeing the history literally engrained \ninto the landscape. I don&#39;t know, I just wonder sometimes what the \nBushi of the past would think of us saying oh this guy was the best \nsamurai because he conquered such and such an area. Killed so many \npeople. You know how much can we actually understand about the \nsamurai. Oh sorry to rant on and on. I hope I made some point, this \nis a disscussion group after all, my favourite samurai was Akechi \nMitsuhide, but I guess you could guess through my comments. Was he a \ngood samurai? I don&#39;t know, but atleast he put an end to Nobunaga \nrest his soul.  Sigh, \n\nwhat do others think? I don&#39;t think I have lost the interest in \nJapan, just I am more wary/weary of the truth.\n\nMark\n\n\n\n"
