Also at least 3-4 TV series that I know of.\n\n&gt;   From: Jerome Larre &lt;jeromelarre@...&gt;\n&gt;1- &quot;Sansho Dayu&quot; (in Japan), &quot;Sansho the baillif&quot; or &quot;the baillif&quot; (in \n&gt;US). by Kenji Mizoguchi\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGood film but VERY sad. Only watch it if your not depressed.\n\n&gt;2- &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot; \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nA great film but also very sad. I think list members would enjoy them both.\n\nIn many ways the Kurosawa films are very Western, most of them have a \nhappy ending, or it was intended as a tragedy. Mizoguchi and the other \ndirectors are more mainstream, their films at best are usually bittersweet.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
