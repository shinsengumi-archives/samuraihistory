The \n&gt; pieces are made of metal or ceramic and triangular\n&gt; shaped, usually \n&gt; they are black or some dark color. Children\n&gt; entertain themselves by \n&gt; making shapes with them.\n&gt; Do any of you know the name of this? If you have any\n&gt; information on it \n&gt; please let me know. Thanks.\n&gt; By the way love the Samurai Moderators homepage.\n&gt; Sweet.\n&gt; Later \n\n\nAs a kid I always called them &quot;Tangrams&quot;, that&#39;s the\nname they were sold under in the US.
