Williams [mailto:amacobra@...] \n  Inviato: domenica 4 maggio 2003 5.52\n  A: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Oggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\n  Mr. Moore,\n\n    Congratulations on your finds.  You truly have a treasure in your \n  possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it\n  professionally \n  cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the\nblade\n\n  mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to\nget\n  it \n  cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.\n    Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.  Professional\n\n  polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two\n  years \n  and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will\n  keep \n  any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.\n    I hope this helped you.\n\n\n  Peace,\n\n  Matt\n\n  _________________________________________________________________\n  The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \n  http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  ---\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n  samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
