It&#39;s more \n&#39;look n feel&#39; than anything else, although I&#39;m quite aware that Japan has \nchanged and looking for Sengoku Mikawa might be like looking for \nShakespeare&#39;s London ... gone a long time ago.\n\nAll this is aid of atmosphere for my Sengoku blockbuster, so a view, or a \nstretch of the Tokaido as was, or anything that might say &#39;this is what it was \nlike&#39; is the main intent.\n\nHaving said that, festivals are OK, demonstrations are better - iaido/jutsu the \nbest.\n\nSo any ideas for packing a lifetime&#39;s experience in one trip?\n\nAnd what time of year is best?\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
