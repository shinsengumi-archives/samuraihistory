There is no difference\nbetween the two of them--if I have a lord, I am his\nvassal, and also his retainer. A vassal technically\nspeaking is someone who owes loyalty to someone else;\na retainer is someone who&#39;s services are &quot;retained&quot; as\nopposed to a merceneray who is hired. Different\norigins, same essential result. \n\nThe military, per se, didn&#39;t have a rank structure\nsuch as you would think of today. For instance, in the\nAshigaru ranks you&#39;d have someone appointed Captain of\nAshigaru, or Ashigaru-kashira, and under him would be\nan Ashigaru Kogashira, or &quot;little captain&quot;, but it\nwasn&#39;t necessarily that you went through these ranks,\ngot promoted or demoted or whatever. They were more\njob descriptions than ranks. Above them would be an\nAshigaru-Taisho (Ashigaru General), who&#39;d command a\nwhole lot of people. Generally speaking, a general is\na Taisho, but just about anyone could be a taisho--if\nyou commanded 1,000 or 100,000 men, you were a Taisho.\nThere was no difference necessarily in rank--just in\nprestige or power. \n\nFor court ranks, which are really what mattered to\nmost individuals, try\n\nwww.sengokydaimyo.com\n\nTony&#39;s got a whole huge explanation on there. \n\nNate\n\n--- muds_theaz &lt;muds_theaz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi there,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m currently researching The Sengoku period. When\n&gt; searching around \n&gt; on the web, or reading through books I see mention\n&gt; of court titles \n&gt; such as Gyobusho (court minister), and ranks such as\n&gt; vassals and \n&gt; retainers. However, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to\n&gt; actually find a \n&gt; layout of the ranks in these sorts of hierarchies\n&gt; and what came above \n&gt; them, below them. Such as: The Daimyo, below him he\n&gt; had vassals (how \n&gt; did he choose who were to be his vassals?) and what\n&gt; is the difference \n&gt; between a Vassal and a Retainer? Ideally I&#39;d like to\n&gt; find out what \n&gt; the ranking system was for both the court and the\n&gt; countries military \n&gt; was (not just the Daimyos). And, even better, the\n&gt; Imperial Guards.\n&gt; Also, does anyone know if this hierarchy changed\n&gt; when Yoritomo began \n&gt; the trend of Shogun leaders rather then Royal heads\n&gt; of state?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
