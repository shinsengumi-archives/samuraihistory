If I had to make a movie about the samurai I would have probably have Quentin Terranteno write the screen play, but I would also leave out the west side storie shit and add in Mary poppins.

Let \n&gt; Quentin Tarrantino write the screenplay, and have David Lynch co-\n&gt; direct with Takashi Miike. And make sure KimuTaku dies a horrible \n&gt; death at the hands of Beat Takeshi.  I&#39;d pay to watch that.\n\nHeck, so would I. Hm. The new wave in Japanese pay-per-view. &lt;G&gt;\n\n\nTony\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
