Japan was not a country at \n&gt;&gt; that \n&gt;&gt; time, but MANY countries. Many nations. \n&gt; \n&gt;Many nations? \n&gt;First of all, there were no such things as &quot;nations,&quot; at least until \n&gt;the 18th, 19th century; second, national identities were then created \n&gt;according to issues such as language, beliefs, eventually race and \n&gt;tradition. All things that the Japanese shared. Actually few places in \n&gt;the world were (and are) as homogeneous as Japan. \nThat is wrong! All small portions of Japan was small countries with their \nindependence and own emperator as well. \nThe first one who dreamt to have one nation and perhaps one world (for these \npeople, Japan was the entire world) was the Emperator Yamato, that unlike \nNobunaga, had peaceful goals and intentions in his heart. \n\nTo quote him (Yamato Emperor, NOT Nobunaga) \n\n&quot;On the earth there ins�t earth portions marked with lines and different \ncolours like a map. Why people of these earth portions had to fight each \nothers when the earth is only one?&quot; \n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; So, he did exactly the same, including genocide against people who \n&gt;&gt; disagreed \n&gt;&gt; with him or hated religions... Just like Hitler... \n&gt; \n&gt;Wait a minute, wait a minute... Do you have an idea of what the \n&gt;Holocaust was? Hitler killed 5.7 million people simply because they \n&gt;belonged to a race, or because he considered them inferiors. They were \n&gt;not people on his path, he sent out over half of Europe his Gestapo and \n&gt;special extermination squads to get them, and to murder them. Hitler&#39;s \n&gt;&quot;final solution,&quot; the ultimate decision of killing ALL Jewish, is \n&gt;something you can not compare with Nobunaga&#39;s will to unify Japan at \n&gt;all costs. Nobunaga did not build concentration camps where thousands \n&gt;of people were killed every day after they were exploited as slaves. \n&gt;And besides that, Nobunaga was born in the middle of a civil war, while \n&gt;Hitler started a World War... How can you compare them? Hitler lived \n&gt;400 years later than Nobunaga, in a different continent, and in a \n&gt;totally different contest. \n&gt;Sure, you can speculate that, given the chance, Nobunaga would have \n&gt;done as bad as Hitler, but... ***speculate*** that&#39;s it. \n&gt;History is a different matter. IMHO. \n&gt;cepo \n&gt; \nOooooo.... Very different contest... \n\nHitler attempted to reunify the &quot;old Sacred German Empire&quot; that never \nexisted in history. Always when certain portions of his ideal map are in the \nhands of germans, other portions was independent. Some would say that he did \nattempted to do with the entire world what the bastard of Nobunaga attempted \nwith Japan. \n\nHitler killed jews not due to racist motivations only, but also religious, \nhe also prosecuted gypsies, homosexuals and even germans who didn�t agreed \nwith his policy. \n\nAnd... Although this is offtopic, Cesar, you may criticise my History View \nPoints as much as ye want, but was not any non-christian religion who always \nwas conspiring to change history logs, doing adulteration and falsification \non the documents, such as what whas done with certain doccuments by Taccitus \nand others to &quot;prove&quot; that Jesus existed. As well, to accuse several others \nreligions (including judaism) of &quot;human sacrifice&quot; and all the same rant as \naways. \n\nThe japanese remember very well their history. Thanks to Tokugawa again. \n\nAnd although I am not a communist... \n&quot;the people who don�t know their true history deeply, are fated to repeat it \nin circles&quot; \nMao Tse Tung \n\nand again... \n\n&quot;Don�t go around spreading \nthat I am telling lies. \nStand up and PROVE I am wrong. \nThe History of the Church \nis full of conspirations of ambition and power&quot; \nGoetche \n\nthat�s all \n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho \nS�o Paulo - SP Brasil \n\n_________________________________________________________\nVoce quer um iGMail protegido contra v�rus e spams? \nClique aqui: http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\nOfertas imperd�veis!
