But \nwhat did &quot;c=\r\nombat&quot; actually involve in those far-off days? It sure as \nhell wasn&#39;t like=\r\n these neat roam-mat dojos we have today. They were \nfighting in the mounta=\r\nins, on riverbanks, tripping over tree roots \nand stones. The weapons they =\r\nused, swords... spears... arrows... \nanything! You didn&#39;t even opponent wou=\r\nld be on foot he could have \ncame at you on horseback! How effective would =\r\nany of our fancy \nmodern sword styles have been, back then? While we were s=\r\ntill edging \nour toes forward gauging the distance between our swords... so=\r\nme \narmored samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with his spear!&quot; \n      &quot;=\r\nAnd there are fools out there looking for spirityuality in \nthe sword. Four=\r\n hundred sword schools had opened up with a few years \nof the founding of t=\r\nhe shogunate. Four hundred! But that didn&#39;t mean \nswordsmanship was flouris=\r\nhing, it just means a lot of bored samurai \nare selling their skills to buy=\r\n rice. They can&#39;t offer content so \nthey babble about spirit. And to keep o=\r\nther schools from stealing \ntheir students--their moneybags--they cooked up=\r\n useless &quot;secret \ntechniques&quot; just so they&#39;ed look different from other sch=\r\nools. Oh \nand god forbid those moneybags get hurt! Oh, no, it&#39;s face-guards=\r\n! \nGloves! Body Armor! Light Bamboo Swords! So what do you wind up \nwith? P=\r\neacetime warriors who have never faced a naked blade; felt \nthe fear of dea=\r\nth!&quot;\n      I posted this to show one reason the samurai became weak and \nth=\r\ne martial art people in the group. I&#39;d like to hear what you think \nabout i=\r\nt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
