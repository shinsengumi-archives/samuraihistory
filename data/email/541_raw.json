This \nis very frustrating for the wargamer, much more than painting the \nlacing on armour! Hey Nuno, have you seen the Perry&#39;s new figures?\n\nRegards,\n\n\nJoe\n\nPS I have not heard of the use of Christian Samurai by the \nPortuguese, Mendes Pinto&#39;s initial influence on Samurai warfare is \nthe only Samurai-Portuguese military connection I know of, which of \ncourse does not mean there were not others!\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;kingscarbine&quot; &lt;headburner@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wargamer, new to this group and to Samurai history in general. \nMy \n&gt; interest in Samurai armies is quite recent and I&#39;ve managed to \nobtain \n&gt; some books from Osprey Publishing (haven&#39;t arrived yet). From what \n&gt; I&#39;ve seen the bibliography is very extensive and it&#39;s driving me \nnuts \n&gt; just to know were to start. Please, I want your suggestions on just \n&gt; the top 5 books on Samurai warfare, arms and armour, it would realy \n&gt; help.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, does enyone know if the Portuguese ever employed \n&gt; christian Samurai mercenaries in the Far East?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx,\n&gt; \n&gt; Nuno\n\n\n"
