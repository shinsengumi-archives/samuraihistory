Auction description:\n*Artist: Teijo\n*Format: Ehon: 9.75&quot; x 6.5&quot;\n*Subject: This type of book was never printed, but always hand written and copied from \ngeneration to generation as the information therein was considered strategically sensitive \nand secret not to be disseminated outside the Samurai class. Also the books often \ncontained details of family secrets in warfare. Few complete copies have survived.\n*Date: c. 1820\n*Condition: Full size. Some light creases and wear. Generally very good state.\n\n\n\n"
