A daimyo ruled over a \nprovince\n&gt; and reported to the shogun, the military leader in Japan during the \n&gt; Edo period. During the Meiji restauration, the institution of the \n&gt; daimyo was abolished and the provinces were replaced by \nprefectures. \n&gt; While The shogun was the highest Japanese military ruler during the \n&gt; Kamakura and Edo period. Although the emperor was officially the \nhead \n&gt; of the state, the shogun rulers had the actual power until the end \nof \n&gt; the Edo period\n\nI would say that a daimyo ruled over a &quot;daimyo land&quot;, that could be a \nprovince, several provinces, part of a province, part of several \nprovinces.\nAnd to the extend of my very small knowledge, I believe that there \nwere no Daimyos in the kamakura period. There were Shugos at that \ntime. Am I wrong?\nIndeed I think that the Daimyo is a title that born to be used by \nfully independent lords during the sengoku jidai, although I am clear \nthat in the Edo period they served like some kind of governors, but \nmore like princes, counts and duches in the european countries.\nRepeat, that is as long a I know, forgive me if I said something \nwrong.\n\nRodrigo Juri A.\n\n\n"
