I found the 2 volumes \n&gt; in a\n&gt;  used book store here in Boston for $12.00. I found Yoshitsune for \n&gt; $6.50\n&gt;  hard cover mint condition! I love the book stores in this city.\n&gt;\n&gt;  A little off topic. It is no secret that I am a russo-japanese war \n&gt; fanatic!\n&gt;  The wife would say nut. But I found a copy of &quot;From the Yalu to Port\n&gt;  Arthur&quot; in a second hand book store on Newberry street. It had all \n&gt; the maps\n&gt;  and was in new to mint condition. I paid $12.00 for it. If you look on\n&gt;  Bookfinder or any of the other big search engines like ABE or others \n&gt; you\n&gt;  will see that a VG to Mint copy is worth anywhere between $250.00 to\n&gt;  $350.00. I love a score! If you do a little research and know what \n&gt; you are\n&gt;  looking for the used book stores can be a gold mine.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Cheers\n&gt;  Bill M.\n&gt; http://www.russojapanesewar.com\n&gt;\n\nStill on the same OT note... yeah, Hawaii is great too. Last week I \njust dropped by a used bookstore by UH and somebody had just sold a \nhuge collection of translations of Chinese Classics from the 50es and \n60es... they were all mint and for $4.99 each!!! I walked home with two \nheavy bags full of books. Oh yeah, to find an old rare book for a good \nprice is one of the little joys of life... ;o)\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
