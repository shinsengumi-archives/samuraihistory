A good place to\nsart looking is www.Koryu.com\n\nSeitei Iaido is a watered down version of Iaijutsu\nmainly from Eishin Ryu. Iaido is not concerned with\nthe strategy required when facing a partner as the\ntraining is solo based. \n\nKendo again is a watered down version of old\nswordsmanship, which has designated only target areas\nand also always you to get hit when scroing your point\nwhich in reality would result in you also being\nkilled.\n\nAikido studies on a small portion of the Daito Ryu&#39;s\nshoden section from which Aikido originates. The\nmovements are excellent, however compared to Koryu\njujutsu it is far form a style thar was created to\nrestrain a seriously dangerous opponent or to even\nkill that opponent.\n\nSaying all this if no koryu is in your area, the I\nwould suggest Iaido if that was available\n\npaul\n\n\n--- federico trejos &lt;federicotrejos@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nHi.\n\nThat will depend on what you mean... If you want to\nlive as a samuray, the best option is to learn a\ntraditional martial art.   I sugest Iaido, Kendo or\nAikido.   Then, do your research : learn and live with\nsamuray principles such as bushido code.\nI suggest you to read books like The code of the\nSamuray of Daidoji Yuzan, Hagakure and Bushido of\nInazo Nitobe.\n\nBye.     \n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam\n�gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n      \n\n      SPONSORED LINKS  \n                                               \nSamurai                                    Japan      \n                             Japan airline            \n                                        \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
