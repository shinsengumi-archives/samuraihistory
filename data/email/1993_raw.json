The \nopening of the Japanese mind incited, inevitably, a \nreciprocal awakening in the American one.&quot; \n\nChristopher Benfey&#39;s book tells the story of the &quot;gifted, \nintrepid men and women, American and Japanese,&quot; who were at \n&quot;the hot edge where two very different cultures were coming \ninto contact&quot; during the half-century before World War I, \nsays Deresiewicz. &quot;The lives of certain key figures unfold \nacross the whole arc of the book, attaining something \napproaching the weight of fiction,&quot; he comments. \n\nDescribing the intersections between these peoples&#39; lives, \nDeresiewicz writes, &quot;Kakuzo Okakura, the connoisseur, curator \nand cultural historian mentored by Ernest Fenollosa, the \nTokyo philosophy professor instrumental in shaping Japanese \nfine arts policy, mentors in turn John La Farge, the painter \nmost responsible for bringing Japanese aesthetic ideas and \nmethods to American art.&quot; \n\n&quot;The structure is symphonic,&quot; writes Deresiewicz, &quot;a symphony \nnot only of characters but of ideas.&quot; Benfey &quot;brings to his \nsubject a scholar&#39;s thoroughness, a critic&#39;s astuteness and a \nstoryteller&#39;s sense of drama.&quot; \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/20/books/review/20DERESIT.html?8bu\n\n"
