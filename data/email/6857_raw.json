His main area\nof skill is restoring temples/shrines. Because of his\nwork he gets to see areas some of only hear of.\n\nHe recently told my friend he is sad that he does not\nhave an apprentise to pass his familys hertiage on to.\n\nPaul\n\n\n--- Michael Peters &lt;shdwstel@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\n\nPaul,\n\n  Actually, Matsushita-sensei ({Kozando}one of my\nteachers) doesn&#39;t make \narmour anymore. He is reselling Marutake -san&#39;s\n(yoroi.co) work. I&#39;ll be \nvisiting Matsushita-san next week and possibly\nspending a week at Marutake&#39;s \nnext month.\n\n  Note: NONE of this armour is up to standards for\ncombat organizations (SCA \netc.).\n\n\nM.J.Peters\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!\nDownload today it&#39;s FREE! \nhttp://messenger.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200471ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
