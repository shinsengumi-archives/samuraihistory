The thrust in European \nfencing is against an unarmoured oponent.\n\nIn iaido/jutsu there are a number of thrusts - in fact Mae, the very\nfirst technique in ZNKR iaido employs (albeit arguably), a thrust at\nan opponent in the rear.\n\nOf the remaining 9, the following involve a thrust:\nNo4: Tsuka ate;\nNo6: Morote tsuki (one of my &#39;favourite five&#39;);\nNo8: Ganmen ate;\nNo9: Soete tsuki.\n\nThe swordsman does not &#39;lunge&#39; because it&#39;s something of a &#39;do or\ndie&#39; attack - if it doesn&#39;t do the job, you&#39;re wide open to counter \nattack - far more so than if you&#39;d have stayed upright and moved \nforward.\n\nHaving said all that there is a lunge in Muso Shinden Ryu kodachi\nwhich works on the principle that you&#39;ll most probably die, but take \nthe other guy with you.\n\nIn Muso Shinden Ryu kenjutsu, there are lunges - in fact there are\nwhat might be considered &#39;wild slashes&#39; - which are set-up moves to \ninvite your opponent into making an attack.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
