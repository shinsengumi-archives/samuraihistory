There was\nnothing derogatory or insulting. And he&#39;s got a\npoint--this isn&#39;t a video game message board. I&#39;m\nsurprised no one has stormed on to give the definition\nof samurai yet: the warrior social class of Japan from\nthe 11th through 19th centuries. The entire question\nis ill-suited for this board. If the creator of the\ngame/anime/whatever says he&#39;s a &quot;samurai&quot;, then in the\ncontext of the game/anime/whatever, he is. However,\nnotions of evil or good, what sword he carries, etc.,\nhave no bearing whatsoever on anything. In the real\nworld, there were &quot;good&quot; samurai and &quot;evil&quot; samurai.\nNot everyone who carried a sword was a samurai. Point\nof fact, for most of the history of the samurai the\nsword wasn&#39;t his most important weapon--the bow and\nthen the spear were. The sword only became supremely\nprominent post 1600 when the majority of wars ceased. \n\nAs to &quot;interfering with grown ups&#39; talk&quot;, are you\nserious? The &quot;samurainess&quot; of an anime character would\nseem to me to be a rather childish subject, to be\ndismissed by most adults. That&#39;s why I think very\nlittle response has been generated to the question.\nAgain, try an anime/video game list. \n\nThanks again,\n\nThe assistant management (bucking for promotion...)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nTake Yahoo!
