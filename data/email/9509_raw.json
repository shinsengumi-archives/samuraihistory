Samurai detested\n&gt;     spying and any other form of deceit. To this end they usually used\n&gt;     Ninjas for this purpose.\n\nPlease read the FAQ about Bushido nonsense....\n\n&gt;     Samurai in 1876-1877 still wearing ceremonial armour into battle and\n&gt;     allowing an outsider (Cruise as a cavalry captain) to wear the armour\n&gt;     of the man he killed. I don&#39;t recall Kenshin Himura or even Saitoh\n&gt;     Hajime wearing armour on RK or SX.\n\nROTFL please don&#39;t use anime as a source. I&#39;m not an expert on the Meiji \nrestoration but one Taiga drama, Shinsengumi, showed some flashy armor \nbeing used in battle. I will note that NHK has modified history in the \npast to improve a storyline or a scene. There are some photos from this \nperiod and tons of ukiyo-e that show armor used in this period.\n\n&gt;     All things considered I think that Richard Chamberlain (The Shogun)\n&gt;     did a better job as a Samurai than Tom Cruise. Even Chuck Norris would\n&gt;     have been a better choice.\n\nYou mean the second and third worst movies made about Japan?\n\nJim\n\n"
