He also describes other \nsimilar executions of the same period of a hatamoto, a daimyo&#39;s \nretainer and a daimyo. (&#39;translated from the Japanese&quot; he tells us). Of \ncourse Mitford is often seen in hindsight to have slightly \nmisunderstood what was going on (a familiar feeling in Japan!), but his \ndescription is quite vivid and moving.\n\nAnd what I&#39;ve read on the Choshu daimyo of the same period indicates \nthat there was a real fear they would be called on to commit ritual \nsuicide, presumably by seppuku, for their offences against the shogun \nand the Emperor.\n\nDoes anyone know when seppuku was made illegal? Or is it still legally \npermitted along with other forms of suicide? \n\n\n"
