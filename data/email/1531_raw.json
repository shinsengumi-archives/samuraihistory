When the Tokugawa \nbakufu began to lose control of the country in the 1850s, Kyoto \nbecame a magnet for Anti-Tokugawa ronin. The Bakufus&#39; hold on the \ncity became rather tenuous. Thye Shinsegumi was a group of Tokugawa \nloyalists banded together to act as counter-terrorists in the capitol.\n\tThey were known for their harsh rules and strict \ntraditionalism. I would recommend the movies &quot;Shinsengumi&quot; with \nMifune, &quot;Shisengumi Shimatsuki&quot; with Ichikawa, &quot;Bakumatsu zankoku \nmonogatari&quot; and even the recent &quot;Gohatto&quot;. There are many more, but \nif these stimulate your interest I think you&#39;ll find the true story \nof the Shinsegumi more interesting than any manga.\n\nTom\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
