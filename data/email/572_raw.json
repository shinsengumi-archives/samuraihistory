A google\n&gt; &gt; search brought to my \n&gt; &gt; attention lots of positive reviews and mentions from\n&gt; &gt; bookstores and people \n&gt; &gt; who seem to be students of various martial arts, but\n&gt; &gt; not from any source I \n&gt; &gt; would consider authoritative on the subject of\n&gt; &gt; Japanese cultural history; I \n&gt; &gt; could find no academic reviews.  While the book has\n&gt; &gt; a fairly large \n&gt; &gt; bibliography as I recall, and does mention, I think,\n&gt; &gt; something called the \n&gt; &gt; Historia Nipponica in the credits, I don&#39;t remember\n&gt; &gt; seeing any footnotes, \n&gt; &gt; page references to other sources, or endnotes; this\n&gt; &gt; lack set off a warning \n&gt; &gt; bell.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, does anyone here know anything about how well\n&gt; &gt; received this work is by \n&gt; &gt; historians and scholars?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any advice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Todd\n_\n   I&#39;ve read a lot of Turnbull, and he&#39;s a good popular author, but \nhe&#39;s writing for a popular audience, and not for scholars. I picked up \nhis books when I was a medeival recreationist (For a decade I made \nJapanese armor for sale to other recreationists). I think it depends \non who you&#39;re teaching-- when I was working on my Bachelor&#39;s degree \nin Asian Studies, the professor cited some of Turnbull&#39;s writings, to \ngive us a feel for particular aspects of Japanese culture. When I did \nmy Masters in Japanese history, my advisor, Dr Paul Varley, knew of \nTurnbull but never had reason to cite him (nor did the other Japanese \nhistory faculty at my school). \n   By all means read Turnbull for background, then move on to deeper \nscholarship in particular topics. I respect him as a very influential \npopularizer of Japanese history, but don&#39;t normally think of him as a \nhistorian, since the books I have from him aren&#39;t written in \nhistorian style (lacking footnotes...). Of course, I haven&#39;t written \nanything that got published either, and he has done plenty. Like I \nsaid, he&#39;s well worth reading to get started, or to fill in on topics \nyou don&#39;t know well.\n\nAlex Hazlett\nJapanese History MA from Univ. of Hawaii, 1999 \nthesis title &quot;Japanese Overseas Trade During the Ming Dynasty&quot;\nnow a Texas A&M PhD student in the Nautical Archaeology Program\n\n\n\n"
