Hideyoshi&#39;s edicts, for example, were an attempt\nto prevent the occurance of another Hideyoshi.\n\nSome samurai formed alliances with farmers and merchants, offering\nmutual protection and support. Thus farmers provided for the samurai\nwho in turn protected them, and issues were discussed &#39;in the round.&#39;\nAs the larger daimyates engulfed the smaller, this proto-democratic\nprocess was stamped out vigorously. The Big Names were having none of\nthat! Democracy? Pah!\n\nOn the flip side, the Mikawa bushi (for example) were so reduced that\nthey were obliged to work alongisde their farmers if they were going\nto eat. Time and again we can read of samurai living on or over the\nedge of poverty, so that any distinction between &#39;peasant&#39; and\n&#39;samurai&#39; was largely theoretical. In reality, everyone was starving.\n\nWithin all this \n  by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the chaos of the Onin wars, point 1 was rendered void\nas a number of the great samurai houses, domiciled in Kyoto but\ndependent upon income from distant estates, were so reduced as to\nbecome powerless. Local estate managers either usurped the rights of\nthe absentee owners, weakened in the Onin Wars, or simply by filling\nthe void left by their demise. The Oda were one, and probably the\nMatsudaira (later Tokugawa) were another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&gt; \nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt; \n--- \n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYAHOO!
