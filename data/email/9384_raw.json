By the Edo period however the growing influence of Confucian  \nideology led to a tendency to avoid cremation and in certain areas  \nburial was reinstated (probably the area I was thinking of) . In the  \nMeiji period cremation was prohibited between 1873 and 1875 during  \nthe upsurge of anti-Buddhist sentiment that accompanied the early  \nMeiji  governments&#39;s efforts to encourage Shinto (must be where I got  \nthe idea), but once again became a common practice after the  \ngovernment directed that fatalities from contagious disease be  \ncremated to halt the spread of epidemics.&quot;\n\n\tQuoted from the Kodansha Illustrated Encyclopedia of Japan (Eibun  \nNihon Daijiten).
