He\n&gt; wore a turban \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing around his head. He had a strong cavalry.\n&gt; He had a rivalry \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Takeda. Thats all I know.\n&gt; \n&gt; If Kenshin was one of the men in charge of Hideyori\n&gt; when Hideyoshi \n&gt; died then Mitsunari would not have been a teen.\n&gt; Since Hideyoshi only \n&gt; died a few years before Sekigahara\n&gt; \n&gt;      Ryan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
