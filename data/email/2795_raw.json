Most impressive. More discussions \nabout this appeared on the sca-jml list recently.\n\n&gt;By 1575 the Japanese were using firearms on the battlefield to\n&gt;greater effect than Europeans, and on a much more\n&gt;massive scale. \n&gt;\nTactics for Spain and the rest of Europe were roughly the same as Japan, \ni.e. musket and pike/yari. Japan had many fine generals as did Europe. \nCertainly Sengoku had honed their treachery, err.. political skills as \nwell. I would hesitate about the much greater effect since many Western \narmies had some form of drill in this period.\n\n&gt;The only reason Europeans surpassed the Japanese by the time the two civilizations re-engaged\n&gt;in the 1800&#39;s is that the Japanese had 200 years of peace, no warfare, so no reason to adapt and change\n&gt;the way they did things. \n&gt;\nRemotely possible but I highly doubt that 200 more years of warfare \nwould have modernized Japan to the degree that happened in Europe. Japan \ndidn&#39;t have the access to resources that Europe had and if they had \nexpanded they may have experienced the same problems that Spain and \nother previously great powers had. Also I would argue that Japan wasn&#39;t \na country until Meiji and that the individual provinces were still \nthinking of independence and kicking out the Tokugawa, which is eventual \nwhat happened. Of course this puts them on par with Italy and Germany \nwhich are both fairly modern themselves.\n\n&gt;ONce they saw that need, they\n&gt;did, and defeated a major European power shortly\n&gt;thereafter (1904-05, Russia). \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nLucky they didn&#39;t win WW2 then.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n"
