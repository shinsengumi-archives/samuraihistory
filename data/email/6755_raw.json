However, \nthey \n&gt; were probably a minority -- on the whole, samurai tended to be \nquite \n&gt; pragmatic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Phil\n\nI wonder though if the &quot;guns are dishounourable&quot; attitude might not \nhave been perpetuated by those clans who were too poor to employ \nthem in any large number. IIRC, the Hojo only had some 300 guns \nlisted in their inventory in the mid-1580s.\n\n\n\n\n"
