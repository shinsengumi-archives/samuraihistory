In it, Oda is shown in \nblack/purplish armor, a red dracula-like cloak and a glowing purple \nwestern style sword. This brought back some distant memories. I \nremember seeing Nobunaga as a villain in a game from the mid 90s \ncalled Sengoku..similar outfit.\n\nMy question is this: why is ALWAYS portrayed as some sort of unholy \nmonster in anime (stupid american otaku nerds) and video games?\n\nGabriel\n\n\n"
