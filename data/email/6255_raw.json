I h=\r\nave the DVD w/ the directors comentary and extra stuff on a 2nd cd, & it go=\r\nes into some detail on the realness of the movie. They said that 1/2 is fak=\r\ne & 1/2 is not.I can&#39;t really tell which is which, but it was a great movie=\r\n in my mind. I take kendo & are into samurai swords and armour, that&#39;s mayb=\r\ne why it was good to me? All in all, don&#39;t tell one of the samurai actors i=\r\nn the movie it was cheesy b/c they all knew what they were doing(all of the=\r\nm were trained to use swords ie...kendo,iaido.....)good stuff!!! \n         =\r\n                                            Yours,\n                        =\r\n                              Mark\n\n&quot;david a. sigler&quot; &lt;fiat_dux_das@yahoo.c=\r\nom&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\n   I just got done finally watching the movie the &quot;Last Samur=\r\nai.&quot; I \nfound it so tediously dull it isn&#39;t funny; Tom Cruz cannot act and =\r\nI \ndon&#39;t care who tries to convince me otherwise. The battle scenes were \ng=\r\nreat, the scenery was fairly good, but the movie was bad. My \nquestion is a=\r\n simple one, what, if any of it, was historically \naccurate?\n              =\r\n                               david a sigler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives:=\r\n http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafesho=\r\nps.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
