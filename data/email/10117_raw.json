Real name&#39;s Sara) and =\r\nI am a new member to the Samurai History Group. I am very impressed with th=\r\ne knowledge of samurai and feudal history in the Archives, so I have a few =\r\nquestions pertaining to Ji-samurai, the Ikki (the rebellions?) and Sousen.\n=\r\n\nI don&#39;t think Wikipedia provides enough detail and I may be confused with =\r\nthe samurai society in particular. I am too familiar with the popular samur=\r\nai that go to the capital, and it seems that samurai are both the rulers of=\r\n the provinces and the soldiers underneath the rulers.\n\nWhy/how were there =\r\nlower-ranked rural samurai [Zi-samurai]? And Ikki are like those who rebel =\r\nagainst the Capital forces and live in rural villages (I think called Souse=\r\nn?)? \n\nAlso, I find it a little hard to believe that few people became samu=\r\nrai and I read about large armies ;) What was samurai life like? What did t=\r\nhey do in an average day?\n\nThank you\n\n\n"
