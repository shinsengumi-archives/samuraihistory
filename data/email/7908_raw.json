(was RE: [samuraihistory] R\ne: h itokiri kawaka\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; First, I&#39;m not &quot;attacking&quot; any of your statements.\n&gt; I&#39;m just questioning,\n&gt; seeking clarification. And sometimes disasgreeing with them. That&#39;s \n&gt; not an &quot;attack.&quot;\n\n*sigh* Haven&#39;t said *YOU* were, Nina...see last message...\n\n\n&gt; Okay, a point of disagreement: Saying &quot;but also&quot;\n&gt; concerning Part B is NOT a\n&gt; dividing line between the two statements, and wasn&#39;t intended to be.\n&gt; Instead, I&#39;m trying to say (perhaps not so clearly, though I&#39;m trying) \n&gt; that the line between fiction and history books is not ALWAYS so clear \n&gt; as far as using them to study history. It looks like that it&#39;s in this \n&gt; one area where we disagree.\n\nIt&#39;s a connector, connecting two seperate thoughts. If they weren&#39;t two\nseperate thoughts, there would be no need to connect them. Regardless, I had\nthought A. You\n*MAY* have thoughts A and B, and may have them connected. No problem--good\nfor you. However, our intrepid Onna had thought B, and used thought B to try\nto contradict my thought A. I don&#39;t see how that works. \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page! \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
