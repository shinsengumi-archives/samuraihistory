And\nwhile we should take some things seriously, it&#39;s\nimportant to remember there are other things that are\nintended as jokes, and should be taken so. \n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours do?\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
