If \nmemory serves me correctly, and I do not remember where I read it although it \nwas online, he was a captain, or leader in some way, of a gun squadron in the \nKii area, and may have been somehow associated with a group of monks there.  \nAdditionally, although it doesn&#39;t really matter or apply: He made an appearance \nin Capcom&#39;s best game ever, Onimusha 2: Samurai&#39;s Destiny in a supporting \nrole, where he is referred to as &quot;captain of the Kiishi Saiga Gun Team&quot;.
