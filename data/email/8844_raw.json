Very nice.  I would come down on the  \n&gt; side of the\n&gt; last of the samurai as a class fighting a battle where the weight  \n&gt; of history and\n&gt; ancestors imbued the warriors with belief in a cause, however faded  \n&gt; and perhaps\n&gt; jaded.  Which puts me in 1877 in Kyushu with Saigo Takamori.  Given  \n&gt; what I have\n&gt; read about the man, I see see a loose parallel with Kusunoki  \n&gt; Masashige&#39;s doomed\n&gt; stand for the Southern Court.\n&gt;\n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Tom Helm&quot; &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 29, 2006 4:04 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] The last samurai battle?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brett -\n&gt; It will depend alot on your perspective. Some say 1877 in Kysushu,\n&gt; when Saigo Takamori and forces loyal to him fought a losing series of\n&gt; skirmishes against the new Imperial army.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Japanese samurais\tJapan airline\tJapan airline flight schedule\n&gt; Japan airline reservation\n&gt;\n&gt; YAHOO!
