Its a short work on Uesugi Kenshin. The writer also penned a book\non Takeda Shingen (Samurai Heroes 1?) and was going to write one on II\nNaomasa. Does anyone have any info on these books and the writer,\nespecially where I can find these books. Thanks\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n--&gt;\nWilliam,\n\nAll three are available and I have them.\nEach one is progressively better in terms of content and include colour\nsections with Mon.\nThat said, all three are excellent.\n\nTwo Dragons (who also produce a fine range of 15mm miniatures) are\ninvolved in the process and will be producing more at a later stage.\nThe author also wrote some articles for Wargames Illustrated a number of\nyears ago.\n\nThere are several sources in the UK who stock these booklets but I am\nnot sure if they had web sites (I cannot find a reference anyway).\n\nUnsure about the rest of the world from stocking point of view.\n\nHowever if you want to drop me a mail off line\n(rob@...) I am sure we can come to some arrangement\nand I can send you the books in exchange for some thing I cannot easily\nget in the UK.\n\nAs a point of reference the authors of Killer Katanas wargame rule set\nalso produce some similar style booklets and these cover the Mori,\nShimazu, Date, Tokugawa, Hideyoshi with Hojo to come.\nThese have a brief detail of the clan, and features on two battles, with\n(obviously) a focus on replaying the battle using KK rules.\nThey are also good value for money even though I do not play the game\nitself. (I do have the rules and more wargames figures than most sane\npeople can imagine!)\n\nHope that helps anyway\n\nKind regards\n\nRob\n-- \nrob broom\n\n\n"
