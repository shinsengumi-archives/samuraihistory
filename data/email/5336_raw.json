Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; The thing is, it is VERY important to divorce the\n&gt; concept of terminology of\n&gt; MILITARY rank from samurai -- they just don&#39;t\n&gt; operate on the same level. There\n&gt; is rank, yes, but that&#39;s SOCIAL rank, not military\n&gt; rank.\n\nEXACTLY! My family is more prestigious than yours is\nnot the same as me being a LTC, and you being an LT. \n\n&gt; There&#39;s no rule. In any feudally structured army,\n&gt; ALL positions and duties are\n&gt; held at the pleasure of the overlord in question.\n&gt; There is no way to say &quot;I&#39;m a\n&gt; first sergeant, you can&#39;t make me a private without\n&gt; due cause and a\n&gt; court-martial.&quot; Even &quot;permanent&quot; appointments (such\n&gt; as that of a taicho^) in a\n&gt; Japanese army were understood to be continued\n&gt; appointments that could be\n&gt; withdrawn at any time (or magnified with further\n&gt; postings) and not one&#39;s &quot;right&quot;\n&gt; to the position.\n\nAgain, exactly. Positions weren&#39;t given objectively,\nand could be taken away at any time. Even in European\narmies at this time, there wasn&#39;t a coherent rank\nstructure as we see today--you might have a few\n&quot;lieutenants&quot; or &quot;captains&quot; as subordinate managers,\nand a &quot;sergeant at arms&quot; or two to enforce discipline,\nbut again, there weren&#39;t ranks like they developed\ninto, not yet. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
