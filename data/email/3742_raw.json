He&#39;s sort of \nlike a Japanese Douglas Adams.\n\n&gt; Loony. Completely. But that&#39;s an opinion, and not\n&gt; necessarily fact. \n&gt; \n&gt; I find Mishima&#39;s work highly disturbing. He seems\n&gt; obsessed with madness. Though I suppose no more than\n&gt; Tanizaki&#39;s &quot;Diary of a Mad old Man&quot;, which I happened\n&gt; to like. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
