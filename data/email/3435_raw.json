I&#39;m new to the group. I&#39;ve got a favour to ask\neveryone. As most of you will probably know in Japan they produce or\ndid produce the historical TV dramas called taiga dramas. &gt;&gt;\n\nOf course. They have been making them for the past 41 years. This year is\nthe 44th one and its Shinsengumi.\n\n&lt;&lt;There are 5 that I&#39;m after in particular. They\nare:\n\nOda Nobunaga - King of Zipangu&gt;&gt;\n\nCurrently being repeated on the Family Channel on Cable here in Japan\n\n&lt;&lt;Tokugawa Ieyasu&gt;&gt;\n\nWill be reshown starting in March on the Jidai Geki Channel\n\nAnother channel will start showing &quot;Onna Taiko-ki&quot; from 1981 next month.\nThese will the first these shows have been repeated. It seems NHK has\nunleashed its archives. What else may be show we will have to wait and see.\nHideyoshi, Takeda Shingen, and Dokuganryu Masamune (the Date Masamune\nseries) were very popular series, so I think there may be agood chance they\nalso will be shown soon.\n\nI have the complete Hideyoshi, Mori Motonari and Takeda Shingen series on\ntape. I could copy them but the copies don&#39;t come out very well.\n\nYou might try and contact a friend in Japan who could tape them. I would but\nI&#39;ve already got a deal with someone else so my VCR is already doing\novertime.\n\nThey are also available in condensed form (down to 4-10hrs depending on the\nseries) on VHS but they are very pricey running up to several hundred\nAmerican Dollars. There have also been some complete series done on DVD. Do\nsome searches for NHK and the series titles to see what you can find.\nHowever these are not subtitled.\n\n&lt;&lt;Taiko-ki (which was made in the 60s I think)&gt;&gt;\n\n1965 to be exact.\n\n\n\n\n"
