However,  on the \n&gt; surface,  it appears that the samurai long sword, or\n&gt; tachi,  seems to be \n&gt; unrelated to tai chi, or more properly t&#39;ai chi\n&gt; ch&#39;uan.  T&#39;ai chi is mentioned \n&gt; historically in the T&#39;ang Dynasty (618---960AD),\n&gt; although is thought to be much older \n&gt; in China.  For more on its origins, consult  Angus\n&gt; Clark,  The Complete \n&gt; Illustrated Guide to Ta&#39;i Chi (2000). Regarding the\n&gt; tachi,  studying pictorial \n&gt; sources, it appears few riders used it in combat. \n&gt; This is understandable.  Riding \n&gt; a horse,   keeping control of your mount is most\n&gt; important;  in combat, your \n&gt; horse is your best ally.  Using a sword that seems\n&gt; to have required both hands \n&gt; would have been hazardous indeed--for what would you\n&gt; use to control the \n&gt; reins?
