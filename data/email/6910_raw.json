So, it was not produced until that time.(I do\nnot know the sepecific period)\n\n4) It may be conceivable that the use of curved blades\nwere imported to Japan either through Korea or China\nafterwards.(again, I do not know the exact period)\nBut, in about a century later, the superior quality of\nthe Japanese sword was well known in the North East\nAsia.\n\n5) The Chinese traditionally had martial arts teaching\nthe use of two edged straight sword. After the Mongol\nconquest and their numerous skirmishes with the\nJapanese pirates on their coast during Mying dynasty\nmade it popular to teach the use of the one edged\ncurved sword.\n\n6) People who provided the above information were\nprofessional historians and martial artists in South\nKorea. So, I believe that it is a very credible\nsource. The site is also managed by one of most\npopular news paper reportor in South Korea.(the\ncounterpart of New York Time, Wall Street Journal,\nWashington Post, and etc in America)\n\nI hope that this will help some people in the group.\n\n\n\n\n                          Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Changsub Lee\n\n\n--- Thomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; wrote:\n \n&gt; According to a quick look round online, the Japanese\n&gt; came into\n&gt; contact with curved blades via Korea as well as the\n&gt; native Emishi - \n&gt; certainly as I understand it they learnt advanced\n&gt; forging techniques \n&gt; from the Koreans.\n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; A curved blade cuts far more effectively than a\n&gt; straight one, and in\n&gt; many (if not most) techniques in Japanese\n&gt; swordsmanship, .\n&gt; \n&gt; In multiple combat or a meleï¿½, this ensures the\n&gt; weapon is always\n&gt; &#39;free&#39; of the target after the cut, and does not\n&gt; require the\n&gt; swordsman to disentangle his blade from its victim.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
