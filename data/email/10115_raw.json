You can believe the myth that the sword survived=\r\n.. but that sword is long gone. Just like the Northern Imperial line is a p=\r\nretender to the throne, so is that alleged sword probably just a replica.=\r\n=C2=A0But-- aside from whether the sword still exist or not --- the sword w=\r\nas/is not sacred because it is a sword-- but because of what that sword rep=\r\nresents.\n=C2=A0Don&#39;t forget--- at the time Kusunagi became sacred.. the swo=\r\nrd was not yet &quot;the soul of the samuraI&quot;---- that position was still being =\r\nfilled by the Bow and Arrow (remember, this sword was made and already a &quot;S=\r\nacred&quot; object by the 700s). \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 Because of the dates of the swor=\r\nd, I would highly suggest that it is sacred because it was found inside Oro=\r\nchi... But it was often blamed for causing Illness, so it wasn&#39;t wielded an=\r\nymore, just kept in a shrine. \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0 If Susano had fou=\r\nnd a knife or spear in Orochi, then THAT weapon would have been the piece o=\r\nf the Imperial Regalia.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 A=\r\ngain, it is not that it is a SWORD.. it is WHAT it represents, which is cou=\r\nrage, valor, bravery, etc.etc...\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0But, more than that .. here i=\r\ns why the sword is sacred :\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The sword is sacred because it was the gift giv=\r\nen to Amaterasu by Susano in apology. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 It is sacred bec=\r\nause it REPRESENTS Susano&#39;s apology. A bow or spear would have worked equal=\r\nly.=C2=A0 *Also, it is safe to say that Kusunagi WAS NOT a &quot;katana&quot;... but =\r\nmore of a chinese/korean straight sword, I think*\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n The Imperial Regalia is sacred because they are directly related to bringi=\r\nng Amaterasu BACK from hiding...\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 Again, it is not the object =\r\nitself, but what it represents.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 SOME shinto followers MAY believe these objects po=\r\nssess souls, but many Bushi families and their descendents (such as my fami=\r\nly) are strict Buddhist, and as such, we don&#39;t place much concern on Shinto=\r\n beliefs as much as someone who are non-Buddhas and shinto.. So the &quot;religi=\r\nous orientation&quot; of the clan/family must be taken into account as well.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 O.k..that was ki=\r\nnd of long, and I apologize. But my point is that Kusunagi could have been =\r\nanything..\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0* Some have theorized that Orochi was actually a hu=\r\nman warrior (or band of warriors) and that when Susano killed them all, he =\r\ntook the sword from their dead captain. Later on, this band of warriors wou=\r\nld be mythologized into a single entity, a snake headed monster. etc.etc.et=\r\nc... In that case... if the leader would have had a spear, then Susano woul=\r\nd have presented the spear to Amaterasu..etc.etc.*\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 Point is, the sword was not yet &quot;the soul of the samurai&quot;.. and t=\r\nhus, we cannot assume its inclusion into the Imperial Regalia for such a re=\r\nason.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\n\n--- On Sat, 2/13/10, C=\r\nearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt;\nS=\r\nubject: Re: [samuraihistory] how did samurai get their last name?\nTo: samur=\r\naihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Saturday, February 13, 2010, 10:39 AM\n\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0 \n\n\n\n\nIn a message dated 2/12/2010 10:38:50 PM Eastern Standard Time, \ns=\r\nteven_matsheshu@ yahoo.com writes:\n\nBut genetic relationships don&#39;t mean ne=\r\narly anything compared to the \ncontinuation of the family/name. My family h=\r\nas numerous adoptions, and they \nmake no difference whatsoever in the desce=\r\nnt. The survival of the clan/name \noutweighs any sense of genetic descent. =\r\nEven on lineage charts, those \nadopted ones appear just as if they were blo=\r\nod .. sometimes there may be a \nsmall footnote... sometimes not. \n\nAn excel=\r\nlent point, and I didn&#39;t mean to suggest that adoptions were \nsomehow less =\r\nvalid as familial relationships. My point was only that if you \nmean to tra=\r\nce your genetic ancestry -- which can sometimes be informative as \nto medic=\r\nal history, for example -- you might get hung up by that tradition. \nObviou=\r\nsly adoption was seen as a fully legitimate means by which to pass \non the =\r\nfamily name, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t have been such a common practice.\n\nAs to=\r\n heirlooms and swords... Various writers do talk about the sword as \nbeing =\r\nan extension of a samurai&#39;s soul, and certainly the idea that swords \nhave =\r\nspirits would be completely in keeping with Shinto beliefs, in which \nevery=\r\nthing has a kami spirit. And no doubt there were families who passed \nalong=\r\n swords along with other family treasures, just as families will pass \ndown=\r\n jewelry. And while I&#39;m sure that a family&#39;s identity wasn&#39;t exactly \ndepen=\r\ndant upon keeping &quot;the family sword&quot;, it IS worth noting that a sword is \na=\r\nmong the sacred objects of the Japanese Imperial Regalia. \n\n--RMB\n\n[Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text po=\r\nrtions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
