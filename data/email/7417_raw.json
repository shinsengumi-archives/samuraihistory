While the Osprey\nbook is not nearly \nas good as the earlier Firebird book, remember that\nTurnbull is doing a \ncomplete overview of the Ninja, both the historical\nand fictional \nversions. It examines the myths, fallacies,\nmisconceptions, and the \nrole of the ninja in popular culture (hence the &#39;comic\nbook principles) \nas well as historical accounts. If someone is looking\nfor a \nstraightforward historical study, then the book is\nprobably not for \nthem.  \nHowever, if someone is looking for a straightforward\nhistorical study \nof ninja, good luck. Most of what could be put in it\ncould just as \neasily be covered by a book dealing with samurai.\n\n\n\nHI\n\nHaving been involvedinthe Ninja/ninjutsu martial arts\nside of the world for the past 20 years, including\npaying for books by Okuse to be translated, I would\nhave to disagree with you.\n\nTurnbull has turned out a book that couldnt be any\nwhere near the truth in fact or legend.\n\nConsidering the content of his previous book on the\nninja I would have to say I didnt think it was wirtten\nby turnbull but by some high school kid that had\ncollected information from web sites created by other\nhigh school kids.\n\nI say this speaking as a member of the bujinkan which\nused to use the ninjutsu boom to promote itself.\n\nThe book is a waste of paper and will only send people\nin the worng direction if they are looking for\nanything to do with ninja.\n\npaul\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n\n\n"
