JOKING, I say!  \n\nSeriously, I&#39;ll watch whatever movies y&#39;all recommend on the subject, and\nwould prefer some sort of translation in to the bastard tongue of English,\nbut I can probably chew through something all in Japanese if I had to.  I\njust wouldn&#39;t know why people did what they did, but it&#39;s sorta like watching\nthose Japanese soap operas.  It can be amusing... for a few minutes, if\n&quot;Desperate housewives&quot; isn&#39;t on at the moment.  \n\nI sense that Momoyama period might, indeed, be the one I&#39;d find the first\ninterest in, but only due to the relative safety of knowing a bit about the\n1550s elsewhere in the European sphere and thus having some safety to flee\ntoward when cornered on a period.  &quot;Um... I don&#39;t know... um... but the\nFuggers *were* a very powerful banking family in the Germanies, you know.&quot; \nSee? Pull out not-very-useful fact and wave it around to distract people\nwhile you slip the other direction. \n\nWhile Mr. Turnbull is engaging in his own way, I was attracted to a shiny\nthing, like a magpie, and went burbling into the pre-history of that\nthoroughly unSamurai-like fellow, Mr. Ming (&quot;The&quot;) and his happy, rollicking\ndynasty.  Now that we know the ships thing was related to the rise and fall\nof the eunichs-- and make no mistake, no double entendre there; none\npossible-- I&#39;m still fascinated about what the heck those crazy Chinese were\nthinking in 1351 during the whole Red Turban affair, and how it relates to\n&quot;let&#39;s sink a perfectly good largest fleet in the world in 1433 and turn\nreally insular.&quot;  A monk, you say, as emporer?  Preposterous. \n\nIn the meantime, then, I shall be chastened to return to the pearl isle to\nlearn more about how many soldiers you have to provide for every cho of\nriceland you own (and here I thought, all along, Koko was the name of the\ngorilla who did the sign language with a cat.  With a CAT! The cat can&#39;t do\nsign language.  It was a doomed experiment).\n\nThis sort of mundane detail brings me to a quick question, perhaps not easily\nanswered: What did the sandal-bearer and the rain-hat carriers do?  Rain-hat\ncarrier?  This, from a list on page 9 of Mr. Turnbull&#39;s Samurai (&quot;u&quot; not &quot;a&quot;)\nArmies: 1550-1615 Osprey book.  No offense to Tony, but this was the only\noffering from those fine ï¿½5,000 per book fellows available at the Central\nLibrary, so I took it.  \n\nYou&#39;ve got all these ashigaro carrying all sorts of things, but to have a guy\nto carry rain hats?  Interesting.  And sandals? Wouldn&#39;t people carry their\nown? Maybe they were artisans to make/create new ones when old ones wore out\nor damaged.  Still... \n\n\n--- Silk Road School &lt;silk.road.school@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Matt -\n&gt; \tI don&#39;t think anybody else is actually gong to be blatant or direct enough\n&gt; to recommend Anthony Bryant&#39;s Osprey book on the Samurai of the Tudor\n&gt; period\n&gt; (although oddly enough, as you may think, it isn&#39;t titled _exactly_ that),\n&gt; because Tony&#39;s too ethical (and too proud) to do it and Nate knows him too\n&gt; well... so I might as well just out and say it.  Good book.  (And I didn&#39;t\n&gt; even know the author was here when I signed onto the list.)  Particularly\n&gt; interesting to you, I would guess, because of the period it covers - Japan\n&gt; during Queen Elizabeth&#39;s time (God save her).\n&gt; \tNow knowing your dramatic background, and knowing that this isn&#39;t your\n&gt; usual milieu (Pilot Adams, I presume?  -Sorry, that&#39;s a kind of &#39;Shogun&#39;\n&gt; joke), let me commend to your attention a few films for general &#39;feel&#39;.\n&gt; None of these is actual history, of course.  But there&#39;s lots (and lots and\n&gt; LOTS) of crrrap out there, and it&#39;s easy to get lost in delusions based on\n&gt; bad period drama.  You know how it goes.  (A perfectly pleasant and\n&gt; intelligent soul recently said here that &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; seemed to be\n&gt; reasonably historical, for example, provoking uncontrollable fits of\n&gt; laughter from Tony.)  So here&#39;s some _good_ period drama, by way of\n&gt; contrast.\n&gt; ...It&#39;ll be interesting to see how this list goes over on this list, in\n&gt; fact. (By the way, I have to admit here and now to a sneaking fondness for\n&gt; the manga of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; (I&#39;ve seen nothing of the anime, so have no\n&gt; opinion), but let&#39;s say I&#39;ve ...reserved judgement ...on any historical\n&gt; details I came across in the storyline...)\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\tStuff by Kurosawa Akira (look under &#39;K&#39;, not &#39;A&#39;)\n&gt; Seven Samurai\n&gt; Hidden Fortress\n&gt; \t...both set in the Warring States period (roughly while Gloriana sat the\n&gt; throne of England)\n&gt; Yojimbo\n&gt; Sanjuro\n&gt; \t...some centuries later - these are bloody hilarious:  and I mean both. \n&gt; As\n&gt; I recall, these are set in the mid-1800s.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tStuff by Inagaki Hiroshi (under &#39;I&#39;, not &#39;H&#39;)\n&gt; Chushingura\n&gt; ...set about 1700 -the archetypal samurai epic:  the 47 Ronin done on the\n&gt; scale of &#39;Gone With The Wind&#39; - think of it as the Japanese cultural\n&gt; equivalent to Thermopylae, the Alamo, the Titanic, and the Easter Uprising\n&gt; all rolled into one.  This film is long and slow, and it&#39;s hard for a\n&gt; gaijin\n&gt; (at least) to keep track of everybody the first time or two through it...\n&gt; but it&#39;s wonderful for all that.  Many of the shots were taken directly\n&gt; from\n&gt; classic woodcuts of the episode.\n&gt; The Samurai Trilogy\n&gt; ...a popularised (and fairly implausible) version of the life of Musashi\n&gt; Miyamoto, author of the Book of Five Rings (or Spheres)... arguably the\n&gt; greatest of the samurai.  (I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s referred to as &quot;Kensei&quot; in\n&gt; Japan,\n&gt; and if someone would give me a more clear definition of that than Harris&#39;s\n&gt; &quot;sword-saint&quot; I would be most grateful.)  Matt, I&#39;ve made the better part\n&gt; of\n&gt; a life&#39;s study of this work.  Strong talk from an Arrogant Son-Of-a-Bitch\n&gt; like me, you may note.  I carry a small copy of the book on me the way some\n&gt; folks carry a Bible, and I have never exhausted what I can learn from it.\n&gt; If I ever achieve a fraction of Musashi&#39;s mastery, I will regard myself as\n&gt; fortunate beyond my deserts.\n&gt; ...Now don&#39;t expect this trilogy to make a hell of a lot of sense in terms\n&gt; of sequential plot line unless you&#39;ve read the lengthy book on which it&#39;s\n&gt; based, but it&#39;s beautifully made and it&#39;s packed with a zillion little\n&gt; period details.  The novel was written and serialised in the 1930s, and\n&gt; reflects some of the most impressively developed virgin/whore dichotomy\n&gt; I&#39;ve\n&gt; ever seen anywhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tNow then:  if Kitsuno (the list-owner:  a Mysterious Figure with whom I&#39;ve\n&gt; never exchanged a post:  some say he&#39;s really a fox spirit), or Tony, Nate,\n&gt; Dean or any of you other elitist, ASOB lot have some suggestions I&#39;ve\n&gt; missed, I&#39;d be only too happy for the recommendation.  I&#39;ve just about got\n&gt; the ones I&#39;ve listed memorised already.  (I only pray I&#39;m not opening a\n&gt; floodgate of raving fandom.)\n&gt; \tGereg\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
