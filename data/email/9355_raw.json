First, I made the mistake of going directly to the current Honnoji,\nbut was told that Honnoji had been relocated since Nobunaga&#39;s death. The guy\nat the temple pointed me in the general direction to go, but I really didn&#39;t\nknow the exactly location. So with some difficulty, I eventually figured out\nwhere the marker was located so I could hike out to find it. I found the\nlocation by visiting a nearby museum of history that was very close to\nHonnoji. The museum had historical maps and tourist maps for sale, and I\nasked a woman at the museum information booth where the old Honnoji was.\nBetween the two of us, we searched one of the maps and we figured out where\nthe old Honnoji was. If I recall correctly, it was about a twenty minute\ntwenty-five minute walk from Honnoji. When I found it, the marker was pretty\nnon-descript. The marker was relatively modest grey stone, to my\nrecollection perhaps 70-80 centimeters tall, located in a very non-descript\nresidential neighborhood. The marker itself was located immediately in front\nof the commercial office of a model house showroom and an elementary school.\nThe kids were laughing, playing, shouting in the background. I don&#39;t think\nthat I have a photo of it. I&#39;m not much of a photography kind of guy.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nMike \n\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Anthony Bryant\nSent: Friday, February 09, 2007 4:54 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: death of nobunaga and jube yagyu\n\n \n\n\nOn Feb 7, 2007, at 4:07 PM, Nate Ledbetter wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, theres&#39; a small marker in front of some\n&gt; building--I thing it&#39;s a hotel--that marks the former\n&gt; spot of the Honnoji.
