His name has come up on this list several times,\nis this a computer game character?\n    There are quite alot of good books in English on the subject and tons in\nJapanese. There are many good films as well; Shinsengumi with Mifune,\nShinsengumi Shimatsuki with Ichikawa, Bakumatsu (the Ambitious), Goyokin\nwith Nakadai and Tamba. And my all time favorite Daibosatsu Toge with\nNakadai, alias Sword of Doom. The Beat Takeshi film you may be thinking of\nis Gohatto (taboo), a story of homosexual desire among the Shinsengumi.\nDirected by Oshima Nagisa, well worth it for the dojo and fight scenes which\nare first class.\n    I would do an internet search for &quot;Samurai Video&quot; or Video search of\nMiami for most or all of these titles.\n    Good Hunting\nTobaku Tomas\n\n\n"
