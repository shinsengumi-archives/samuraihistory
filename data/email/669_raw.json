The\n&gt; &gt; convincing argument referred to takes place elsewhere, and would be\n&gt; in Japanese\n&gt; &gt; historical journals, no doubt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tony\n&gt;\n&gt; That is a very good point, the author really doesn&#39;t have reason to go\n&gt; into detail since it is about Nobunaga and not inabayama.  Although I\n&gt; have to concur that it sounds very reasonable that it fell in 1567,\n&gt; based on what I wrote in my previous post.  And my jab about peer\n&gt; review was aimed at Turnbull anyway ;)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
