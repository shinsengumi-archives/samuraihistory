The strengh was\n&gt; needed for close contact.  If you move up to later time frames, the length of\n&gt; the handles were shortened for style reason more than combat reasons.  The\n&gt; gentleman were bumping into things with the longer blades and handles being\n&gt; word in their belts.  This lead to single hand style iaido.  The blades were\n&gt; also lightened with grooves.\n\n    Folks-\n        It is great to finally see some action on this list. I have to disagree\nwith some of the above though. While the assessment of Japanese sword arts and\nbody movement seems spot on, the statement on handle length is (I am afraid) not.\nThere are any number of good references in Japanese (and English) which present\nus with examples of early koshirae. It is clear from these that a standard of 1/3\nrd or 1/4th scabbard length was standard (with a few exceptions) and the really\nlong handles we sometimes see came about in the Bakumatsu (tsuka\nenvy?)Period,19th cent.\n    I am not saying you are wrong, just you could be more correct,pray for surf.\nTom\n\n\n"
