A friend of mine has a katana with the scabbard covered in a snakeskin.  A little damage lets one see that the wood underneath has been gilded giving a warm, yellowish glow (&quot;underpainting&quot;, I guess in art terminology) to the skin.  The most amazing thing is that NO SEAM can be found anywhere in the skin, so how the artisans managed to cover the rounded end of the scabbard I&#39;m blowed if I know.  It&#39;s a brilliant piece of workmanship.  Fascinating.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: John Perry \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, January 09, 2007 6:20 PM\n  Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: CLASS PAPER.
