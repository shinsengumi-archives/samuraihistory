They may also have contributed to an unrealistic \nview \n&gt; of what Asian cinema has to offer. \n&gt; \n&gt; All pristine, perfectly composed images and eye-catching \n&gt; pyrotechnics, they suggest every martial arts film from the Far \nEast \n&gt; sets out to dazzle. But unlike those lavish Chinese cinematic \n&gt; productions, the Japanese film When The Last Sword Is Drawn is \nmuch \n&gt; more traditional and has the satisfying sweep and sprawl of a good \n&gt; old-fashioned novel - which is hardly surprising given its roots \nin \n&gt; a bestseller by prizewinning author Jiro Asada. \n&gt; \n&gt; Structured around a series of flashbacks and blending the complex \n&gt; social history of 19th century Japan with more universal concerns \nof \n&gt; family, honour and class struggle, it often feels like a Japanese \n&gt; equivalent of Dr Zhivago or Gone With The Wind, displaying much in \n&gt; common with the cinema of Kurosawa and Oshima. \n&gt; \n&gt; The tale begins during the winter of 1899. An elderly man called \n&gt; Hajime Saito (Koichi Sato) arrives at a clinic seeking help for \nhis \n&gt; sick grandson. A doctor offers assistance and Saito spots a photo \nof \n&gt; Kanichiro Yoshimura (Kiichi Nakai), a man he once despised and \n&gt; wanted to kill. The doctor (Takehiro Murata) also knew the man and \n&gt; his son and their conflicting memories of his true nature provide \n&gt; the basis for the story. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the 1860s, Saito and Yoshimura were both members of the \n&gt; celebrated Shinsengumi, an elite force of samurai dedicated to the \n&gt; defence of Kyoto. Saito considered himself to possess all the \n&gt; virtues of a samurai and thought Yoshimura little more than a \n&gt; country bumpkin whose mere presence was an insult to his dignity. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yoshimura, however, was easily the best swordsman of his \ngeneration \n&gt; and was also dedicated to his family. He considered indignity a \n&gt; small price to pay if he could continue to provide for them. Thus, \n&gt; he accepted the jobs others shunned, demanded extra payment for \nacts \n&gt; of bravery and never flaunted his superiority. &quot;What kind of \nsamurai \n&gt; is that?&quot; demanded one colleague. \n&gt; \n&gt; The doctor recalls an entirely different man; a devoted father and \n&gt; husband who did whatever was necessary to provide for his family \nand \n&gt; keep them alive. Gradually, as their memories converge, it becomes \n&gt; clear just what an extraordinary figure Yoshimura really was. \n&gt; \n&gt; The personal story at the core of When The Last Sword Is Drawn is \n&gt; played out against the shifting allegiances and social changes in \n&gt; the Japanese history of the period. Gunfire begins to make the \nsword \n&gt; a weapon of the past. Divisions within the Shinsengumi sow the \nseeds \n&gt; of its eventual destruction. There is an elegiac, end-of-era \nquality \n&gt; that carries echoes of such influential American westerns as The \n&gt; Wild Bunch and The Shootist. \n&gt; \n&gt; Director Yojiro Takita takes an understated approach: the film \nwears \n&gt; its beauty without ostentation. Confrontations are swift, brutal \nand \n&gt; bloody without becoming stylised. The flashbacks occasionally \n&gt; threaten to break the spell of the narrative, but what ultimately \n&gt; shines through is the humanity of the story as memories and \n&gt; incidents transform our understanding of an individual, revealing \n&gt; that heroism can take many forms and that even the bitterest \nrivals \n&gt; can eventually achieve mutual respect. \n&gt; \n&gt; On selected release from Friday\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This article: \n&gt; \n&gt;   http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/thereview.cfm?id=1418732004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
