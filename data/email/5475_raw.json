The Emperor is the head of state\nbecause he&#39;s divine? \n\nBut I digress...I think if you take the Shogun out of\nthe picture, then there is a case for a\ntheocracy--monks ruling the country for monks, and not\n&quot;for&quot; the Shogun or anyone else. The problem I see\nwith this is that, well, Japan&#39;s historically too darn\nopen to other religious viewpoints. Most theocracies\nkick out other creeds in order to consolidate their\npower. Can you see Jodo Shinshu getting rid of Tendai,\nor vice versa? Hiei-zan would be pitted against\nHonganji, not working with it. And also against\nMiidera, and Kongo, and the two Zen sects...while they\n(Rinzai and Soto) may not have been militant, I bet if\ntheir existence was threatened, they soon would be. \n\nWhile it may be easy to couch it in terms of Buddhist\nvs. Non-Buddhist (Catholic, maybe), you don&#39;t see too\nmany Muslim theocracies (really the only I can think\nof in existence these days, besides the Vatican) being\nshared between Sunni and Shiite, do you? \n\nWow, digression...\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
