My last name is &quot;Ledbetter&quot;, and it comes out\nas &quot;Reddobettaa&quot;. However, that&#39;s how it&#39;s done. In\nChina, perhaps, you use kanji to write a non-Chinese\nname (I have several friends who&#39;ve lived in China and\nhave legally registered Chinese names for legal\npurposes) but this is NOT the case in Japan. You can&#39;t\nfit kanji to most Western names--it just doesn&#39;t work.\nFor &quot;Tyler&quot;, I suppose you could take a kanji that\nreads &quot;Tai&quot; and a kanji that reads &quot;ra&quot;, but who KNOWS\nwhat meaning, if any, that could have. Similiarly, you\ncould try &quot;To&quot; &quot;Mu&quot; &quot;son&quot; (the &quot;P&quot; would just have to\nbe omitted--I can&#39;t figure out how to fit it in&quot;) but\nit wouldn&#39;t make any sense whatsoever. \n\nNow, if you katakana-ized your name, it would look\nlike this: タイラー・トムプサーン　(Tairaa\nTomupusan)\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
