I bring swords\ninto and out of Japan, and for the most part what people have said\nabout it is true.\n\n1) You cannot bring non-Japanese &quot;steel&quot; swords into Japan.  You can\nget them into your luggage on your plane, but you will need to open it\nup at customs.  First, they will ask you want they are for.  Next,\nthey will do the magnet test.  If the magnet sticks, then there is\niron (assumption is steel, but we won&#39;t go into the metallurgy right\nnow) and the sword has to be verified (see below).  If the magnet\ndoesn&#39;t stick, it is a &quot;mogito&quot; (literally a fake sword) and you\nshould be fine.\n\n2) If there is iron/steel in the sword then you will need to justify\nhaving it.  There are several reasons you could bring it,\nlegitimately:\n   a) It is a traditional Japanese sword (Nihonto) and you are a\nlegitimate practitioner of a Japanese sword art or sword society.\nThey will want some kind of documentation as to its (and your)\nlegitimacy.  Here&#39;s where you get your senior sword practitioners or\nsociety members to vouch for you.  Note:  Just because it is a\nJapanese sword doesn&#39;t mean it will be allowed in.  Mumei gunto (war\nswords with no signature) are likely to be stopped.  Likewise, some\nsmiths have been accused of using unorthodox practices, and their\nswords are questionable/rejected, now, when they are discovered.  This\nhappened to my instructor when he went back for training.\n  b) You are bringing it in for work.  If you are getting fittings\nmade or having someone polish the blade, you can often get the sword\nthrough customs with help from the person doing the work.  It is not\nlegal to actually use the sword in Japan, however, and if you aren&#39;t\nthere as a tourist I don&#39;t know that they will want you to keep the\nsword.\n\nIf you bring a sword that doesn&#39;t meet their criteria, you could find\nyourself in the position of either having it held at the airport until\nyou leave or having it confiscated.  I can&#39;t tell you why the latter\nwould happen, but I wouldn&#39;t chance it, myself.  I&#39;d make sure that I\nwas in contact with a legitimate person in Japan who could tell me\nwhether or not I could bring the items in question with me or not.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n-Josh\n\n"
