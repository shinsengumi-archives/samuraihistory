However, I&#39;ve\n&gt; determined\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve got some rare form of dyslexia which only\n&gt; &gt;  manifests itself when I&#39;m forced to tell the\n&gt; diffence\n&gt; &gt;  between the &quot;tsu&quot;, &quot;shi&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; in\n&gt; katakana.\n&gt; \n&gt; You are NOT dyslexic. �� SO and �� N are practically\n&gt; identical with the \n&gt; big difference being the direction in which one\n&gt; stroke is drawn. \n&gt; Similarly, �� TSU and �� SHI are very similar in\n&gt; appearance.\n&gt; Here the difference is between the two small marks\n&gt; being arranged \n&gt; horizontally or vertically.\n\nBarbara, hi--\n\nWow, this is a bit of an old thread--it just dawned on\nme that you were replying to me. Yes, I know I&#39;m not\nactually dyslexic--it was a bit tongue in cheek. My\nwife actually does have mild dyslexia, so it certainly\nwasn&#39;t meant to be insensitive (funnily enough, she\nkicks my butt at reading/using katakana). \n\nAfter 12 years of studying Japanese and living off and\non in Japan, I&#39;m well aware of the differences between\nthe characters that you point out above. It&#39;s not a\nlack of knowledge--hence why I describe it as a\n&quot;dyslexia&quot;. Sometimes my brain simply doesn&#39;t compute\nthe katakana word I&#39;m looking at, even though I&#39;d see\nthe same thing in hiragana and not miss a beat. For\ninstance, even though I&#39;ve seen the word ����Х���\n1000 times since my Japanese 121 class 12 years ago,\nit&#39;s entirely possible that 10% of the time I&#39;d simply\nblank when looking at it. More common, however, is\nfrustration when seeing a word I use daily in hiragana\nor kanji, but spending a full minute to figure it out\nbecause someone wrote it in katakana. Even though I\nused to live within a 2 minute walk of it, if I\nsaw����襮��������on a sign, it&#39;d take me forever\nto figure out it was the �塹�ڸ��� next to����������\nwhere I used to walk my dogs. \n\nTo use an example in English--I don&#39;t have to sound\nout &quot;C-e-n-t-r-a-l P-a-r-k&quot; to get a famous park in\nNew York--I just read the words &quot;Central&quot; and &quot;Park&quot;.\nSimilarly, I don&#39;t have to stop and sound out\n&quot;��褮���������or &quot;�塹�ڸ���&quot;, but I do have to\nstop with ��襮��������. As I said, it&#39;s not an issue\nof being unfamiliar with the katakana characters--I\nuse them daily. I simply have some sort of &quot;block&quot;\nwith katakana, especially when I see a word I don&#39;t\nimmediately recognize. \n\nAnd my wife laughs at me all the time for it. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
