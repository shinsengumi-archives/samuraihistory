My \nancestors fought in the American Revolution and more recently, in the American \nCivil War (with the Union side) and a few more recent wars. This does NOT make \nME an American Revolutionary Patriot nor does it make ME a Union Soldier.  I \nhaven&#39;t, myself, served in the Armed Forces so no matter how many ancestors I \nmay have had who were in the services or fought in wars, it does NOT make ME \ninto a soldier. \n\nThe Japanese who descend from samurai are correct when they do NOT call \nthemselves &quot;samurai.&quot; \n\nNina\n\n"
