But what do you guys think of it? \nDo \n&gt; you think it has the potential to be up there with Shogun and The \n&gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood crapfest to make money \n&gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n\nShogun was based on pshudo historical fact, hence the historical \nfiction label. where as the Satsuma rebellion actully happend. Though \ni would be interisted to know if there where any non japanese as part \nof the rebellion other than in ports. \n\nAtsi Kazuri\n\n\n"
