Probably a stupid question, I know, but how did they come to be \n  called -- and why were they called -- the &quot;famous twenty-four generals of \n  Takeda Shingen&quot;?  What was famous about them?  Thanks!  :-)  Take care.  :-)\n\n  L8r\n  Tim\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
