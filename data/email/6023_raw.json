What do they have to do with Japan, sauced\n&gt; or not? &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\nI was referring to the very profitable mackerel trade\nthat took place between Japan and Tartary for about 40\nyears. You must have come across it in your studies. I\nbelieve it was Yoshimitsu who commissioned a certain\nUmitori Shioyaki to travel to Tartary and trade\nJapanese seafood for Mongolian yak products. Shioyaki\ntook a load of salted mackerel to the Tartar chieftain\nUg Li, who enjoyed it so much that soon a thriving\ntrade took off. Umitori received the title of &quot;Saba no\nkami&quot; from Yoshimitsu, who for some reason enjoyed\nsoured yak&#39;s milk. Anyways, after about 30 years Saba\nno kami retired to a remote Shikoku monastery and took\nthe name &quot;�C�N&quot; (Kaisen). Shortly thereafter a load of\nmackerel bound for Tartary was not salted before the\njourney. When it arrived, the chieftain accused the\nnew envoy, Sanma no suke, of some fishy foul play, and\nhad him beheaded, gutted, and broiled at 350 degrees\nuntil the skin is brown and flaky, but till moist\nunderneath...oh, sorry, that&#39;s my cookbook. \n\nAnyways, there you have it. Ug Li got sauced in the\nend by his own underlings. A vinagrette, if I&#39;m not\nmistaken. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
