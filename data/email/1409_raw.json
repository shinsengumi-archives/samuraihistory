Look at the Mori clan.  &quot;Moto&quot; was \nused at least as much with them as &quot;Nobu&quot; with the Oda: Hidemoto, \nTerumoto, Motonari, Okimoto, Takamoto, Motoharu, Motokiyo, Motoaki, \nMotoyasu, Mototomo, etc.  Another example is the Hojo clan.

(The most famous \nobviously being \n&gt; ODA Nobunaga.)  I&#39;ve seen it with AT LEAST a couple dozen \nextensions on both \n&gt; sides (e.g., Hidenobu and Nobuo, &c.)
