I appreciate the clarifications.  I started\ntraining in the Bujinkan in the early/mid 80&#39;s.  I have no illusions about\nStephen Hayes.  While I would certainly agree that he had his own\ninterpretation of Ninjutsu, he did bring the art to the United States in a\nbig way.  So let&#39;s give him some credit.  One can certainly see him going\nhis own direction in &quot;Ninja Realms of Power&quot;.  While I stop short of calling\nhim a fraud, I do think it wise that any information from him be cross\nchecked.  I had a long gap in trianing and came back a few years ago.  When\nI did, I found that there were many holes in my knowledge and many peices of\ninfomrtion I found to be incorrect.  Some of that, I suppose could be\nattributed to Hayes.  However, I think that at the time a good portion of it\nwas that we just plain do not live in Japan and get impressions (not just\nfrom Hayes) and 2nd and 3rd hand information.\n\nBy the way, for what it is worth, Paul, your book &quot;History of the Schools of\nthe Bujinkan&quot; is required reading for my students.\n\nTake care,\nJohn Hidalgo\nwww.texasshinto.org\nwww.roundrockbujinkan.com\nwww.lonestarsumo.org\n&quot;Seek freedom and become captive of your desires.

Could you please\n&gt; provide this specific\n&gt; information?  I am particularly interested in what is\n&gt; the specific Hollywood\n&gt; misinformation you attribute to Mr. Hayes.  If I am\n&gt; reading your post\n&gt; correctly, you seem to indicate that Masaaki Hatsumi\n&gt; is a fraud.  Could you\n&gt; also present your basis for this as well? Who has Mr.\n&gt; Hayes or Mr. Hatsumi\n&gt; drefrauded and how? You also mentioned history books.\n&gt; What specific history\n&gt; books do you feel we should be reading so that &quot;this\n&gt; crap wouldn&#39;t keep\n&gt; coming back&quot; and while we are at it, to what specific\n&gt; &quot;crap&quot; are you\n&gt; referring?  Your post gives the impression that you\n&gt; have reseached Mr. Hayes\n&gt; and Mr. Hayes.  What methodolgy did you use for this\n&gt; reseach?  How much time\n&gt; was put into it?  What qualifications do you\n&gt; personally hold to make a valid\n&gt; assesment whether or not the activities of Mr. Hayes\n&gt; or Mr. Hatsumi are\n&gt; fraudlent?  Lastly, since you brought it up, for whom\n&gt; are you an\n&gt; intellegence officer?\n&gt;\n&gt; Take care,\n&gt; John\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Nate Ledbetter&quot; &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, May 08, 2005 10:33 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] New Ninja documentary\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- Helly Angel &lt;ahelly69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I cannot understand as someone that supposedly is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Intelligence Officer&quot; does not be able to check a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; website, to revise the information and to know if\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spoken of someone serious or not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Who  speak of straight swords or estupids running\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; black pajamas?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is really important if Hayes is in the film?\n&gt; Masaaki\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hatsumi is in the film and this is sufficient for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.   Each one is free to administer its knowledge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as want.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As an Intelligence Officer, I&#39;m trained to research,\n&gt; &gt; evaluate, analyze, and recommend. The first decision\n&gt; &gt; to make is &quot;Is this worth my time?&quot; Anyone in\n&gt; academia\n&gt; &gt; will tell you that if you want to judge the quality\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; someone&#39;s research, check out their sources. Hayes\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; hardly a &quot;source&quot; of anything but Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; misinformation. If this documentary is going to use\n&gt; &gt; him as a source, then there&#39;s no reason for me to\n&gt; &gt; waste my time clicking on the link, much less\n&gt; watching\n&gt; &gt; the dang thing. And last I checked, Hayes learned\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; Hatsumi. Ergo (That means &quot;therefore&quot;), I don&#39;t see\n&gt; &gt; much reason to be excited about him, either. Let me\n&gt; &gt; break it down: Hayes = fraud. Hatsumi taught Hayes\n&gt; &gt; everything he knows. That makes Hatsumi a.....?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Criminy, if people would put down the martial arts\n&gt; &gt; magazines and pick up a history book, this crap\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t keep coming back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or ï¿½it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Budo Taijutsu?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not a CLUE what you&#39;re saying here. I&#39;m assuming\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; English isn&#39;t your first language.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my country we have a thought: &quot;when the words\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not better than the silence, is better to\n&gt; silence&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What country are you from? I assume that research\n&gt; &gt; standards there aren&#39;t up to par with what you&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; expect from REAL historical research, and not\n&gt; &gt; Hollywood or martial arts fantasy, in the US or\n&gt; Japan.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend you see the film and train dogs, not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; martial arts. Not with a heart closed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the pseudo-zen, that really makes me feel\n&gt; &gt; shamed into reading my fortune cookies next time.
