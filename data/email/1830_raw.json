Why did they invade anywhere? Why does\nanyone? Resources, imperialism, recognition as a dominant\nrace were all factors.  Prior to the two assaults, the\nMongols had dispatched ambassadors to the Bakufu,\nrequesting/demanding the submission of the Japanese to a\nposition of inferiority, both of which were rather harshly\nmanhandled. When diplomatic bullying failed, the Mongols\ndecided fatefully to put their fleets into action.\n\nMichael Lorimer   \n\n\n\n --- &quot;Matthew E.
