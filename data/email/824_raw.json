This is\nnot a novel in the full sense but rather &quot;faction&quot; - a very interesting way\nof portraying events in the Inn by using little playlets. I would recommend\nit to light readers as well as serious readers. I have a copy from 1961,\npublished in New York by Random House. In it I have kept a review by a\nliterature critic of the time (in the Daily Telegraph I think). I thought it\nmight be of interest, as an aside the cost then was 35s - ï¿½1.75 in sterling\nnow or about $2.50:\n\nJAPANESE INN. By Oliver Statler. (.Secker and Warburg. 35s.)\n\nFOR Mr. Statler in 1947, a fortyeight-hour pass meant not the fleshpots of\nTokyo but a week-end in a village inn; and the trip into the countryside,\noften repeated, soon became a trip into the feudal past. The inn was the\nMinaguchi-ya, in the village of Okitsu, on the Tokaido highway linking the\nold Imperial capital of Kyoto with Edo, the Shogunate site of modern Tokyo.\n\nIn electing to write a history of the Minaguchi-ya Mr. Statler could\nscarcely avoid anthologising most of the more colourful episodes and\ncharacters in the Japanese calendar. There is no denying the fascination of\nthis material, which will be familiar only to students of things Japanese.\nIt is all written up with a vividness that captures what is bloody minded as\nwell as what is charming in this culture of ascetic aestheticism.\n\nMany generations of the Mochizuki family played host here to such eccentrics\nas Ieyasu Tokugawa, Will Adams, the Zen poet Basho, Dr. Kaempfer, and\nHiroshige, whose views of the Tokaido liberally illustrate these pages. More\ntenuously linked to the fortunes of the inn are the many period politicos\nand the European bagmen and missionaries, with their serio-comical\nsquabbles. The inn was awash with blood during the police terror of 1651. In\n1705 the teenagers were on the march; a compulsive crusade of three and a\nhalf millions passed by en route to Ise. Of such little-known incidents is\nthis entertaining and unusual volume composed. It is decorated with the\nsatirical brush sketches of Jichosai, an agreeably astringent foil to the\nwoodcuts of Hiroshige, Hokusai, Kuniyoshi and Moronobu.\n\nHUGH GORDON PORTEUS\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Paul & Anne Wittine&quot; &lt;dogen@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, May 02, 2002 9:18 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Japanese Inn by Statler Oliver (Slightly OT?)\n\n\n&gt; Can anybody who somewhat knows the subject, tell me if this book can be\n&gt; taken at face value, or is it just another misguided attempt at\n&gt; understanding Eastern culture and history by a citizen of the West?\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul Wittine\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
