I am basing=\r\n mine off of a suit from the Osaka\n&gt;castle museum (as seen on page 128 of S=\r\namurai, by Mitsuo Kure), and it\n&gt;is in a haramaki-do style. I especially wa=\r\nnt to ask Anthony J.\n&gt;Bryant-whose website has helped immensely-some questi=\r\nons about plate\n&gt;thicknes, that is if anyone knows how to contact him.\n\nOka=\r\ny, regarding the thickness of the plates in a tatami-dou, I&#39;ve \nexamined se=\r\nveral over the years, and the plates, when made of iron or \nsteel varied fr=\r\nom as little as 0.4mm, going up to circa 1.6mm.\n\nThe thinner one was in a p=\r\nrivate collection and is illustrated on page \n88 of Ian Bottomley&#39;s and Joc=\r\nk Hopson&#39;s book &quot;Arms and Armour of the \nSamurai&quot;. Although extremely thin,=\r\n they were well domed and hardened so \nas to resist deformation. The armour=\r\n was probably made during the very \nearly Edo era for a samurai as a travel=\r\nling piece, as the quality of \nthe finishing is very high.\n\nFor a practical=\r\n fighting armour I&#39;d recommend going with 1.6mm plate if \nyou can. When pro=\r\nperly shaped they stand up well even if not hardened \nand tempered. Note th=\r\nat the edge of each plate on an iron or steel \nexample is turned out a tiny=\r\n amount so it lays flat(ish) against the \ntextile foundation, and the plate=\r\ns are arranged in a series of curved \nlines so that when worn it follows th=\r\ne contours of the body in \nhorizontal rows.\n\nHope your project goes well.\n\n=\r\nYours\n\nDean\n\nIf the armour is of hardened and lacqerred rawhide leather, th=\r\nen \ntypically you are looking at using circa 3mm thick hide. Don&#39;t forget t=\r\no \ncoat the outer shell with a very thin layer of car body filler before \nl=\r\nacquering. Okay the Japanese didn&#39;t use car body filler, but it&#39;s the \nclos=\r\nest thing you can get to the compound of stone and other stuff that \nthey d=\r\nid use:-) This will give you a fine smooth surface to paint.\n\n-- \nDean Wayl=\r\nand\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefight school.demon. co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
