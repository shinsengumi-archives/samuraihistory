The story you may be looking for is actually a Japanese legend whose main character is a general by the name of Raiko (Minamoto Yorimitsu) who fights the demon-being Shutendoji. Sadamitsu and Kintoki accompany Raiko and defeat the demon by cutting its head off.\n\nI&#39;m not sure where you can find more info on this legend, but hopefully that helps.\n\nGood day,\n\n\n\nkeiman0 &lt;KeimanZero@...&gt; wrote:                               Who or what exactly was Kai Doh Maru or Kaidohmaruu in the Heian Period \n Era?
