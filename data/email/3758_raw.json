I want to apologize \nfor asking questions before reading the archives, but the searches I \nran didn&#39;t turn up anything on my subject.\n\nI&#39;m writing about Heihachiro Oshio&#39;s manifesto and rebellion in the \n1830s. I have a copy of the manifesto, some information on the \nhistorical context, and a little on the revolt and its aftermath. I \nwas wondering if anyone knew about this matter and would be willing \nto discuss it. The essay is just overdue now, and I must turn it in \nin the next day or so, but I&#39;d appreciate anything you&#39;d be willing \nto share.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nNatasha Compagnon\n\n\n"
