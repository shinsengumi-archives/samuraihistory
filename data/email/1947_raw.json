The version below also seems to be on \nwww.cd-wow.com \n&gt; and a little cheaper too ($7-8?).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Howard\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Snip   &quot;...Message: 7\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 03 Jul 2003 04:05:31 -0000\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@s...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Seven Samurai DVD\n&gt; \n&gt; You NEED to get the &#39;Criterion Collection&#39; version - it is one of\n&gt; the best done DVDs I&#39;ve ever seen.  It has English subtitles\n&gt; (optional) and the best commentary track I&#39;ve ever heard.  It has\n&gt; also been remastered, and looks far more crisp than any prior\n&gt; version.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0780020685/104-\n4493474-318  \n&gt; 3960?vi=glance\n&gt; \n&gt; ...&quot;  snip\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n&gt; Version: 6.0.495 / Virus Database: 294 - Release Date: 30/06/03\n\n\n"
