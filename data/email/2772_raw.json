Grab your handle with \na closed fist and draw with all your might, all your energy will be \ndissipated before your blade gets near the target. Key to the draw is \nrelaxing the hand and applying your strength at the point of impact. \nWith blade up and fist clenched it is near impossible to draw the \nsword. Open the fingers, draw with just your index finger and snap the \nfingers shut after the kissaki clears the scabbard, thus  focusing all \nyour power in the tip.\n      There are also no rules that say if it is worn blade up it has to be \ndrawn that way. a katana can easily be drawn blade down or &quot;out&quot;, blade \nand handle flat lay your open palm, knuckles down, on the tsuka,turn \nthe hand over and draw. Same applies to the tachi...\n-t\n\n\nYahoo!
