The Nara and Heian periods are frequently viewed as sort of \nclassical and may be viewed as ancient in the context of Japan. \nAnything much earlier than about 700 CE is pretty much pre-historic. \nThe stone age ended in Japan sometime around 200 BCE to 200 CE. But, \nJapan remained pretty much pre-literate for sometime afterwards.\n\nIt is pretty easy to find out the names and comparative ranks of \nimperial and bakufu offices. These are given in tabular form in an \nappendix to Kodansha Kogojiten. There arealso a few well known \nhousehold officials. There are also the titles held by leaders of the \nancient clans. Alas, these are not included in the tables that I just \nmentioned.\n\nTo complicate things, the Japanese very seldom abandoned any titles or \noffices once they came into use until a general reform of titles during \nthe Meiji Restoration in the nineteenth century. Instead, obsolete \ntitles and offices generally became ceremonial. In some cases, they \nappear to have become freely assumable.\n\n\n"
