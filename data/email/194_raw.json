My name is Tim and I have been studying \nJapanese history for about six years now and take the strongest interest in \nthe history of feudal Japan.\n\nNow the question: I watched a Kurosawa movie &quot;Kagemusha&quot; and then read that \nthe among the scenes, where various warlords discuss whether Takeda died or \nnot (and of course then, when they learn that he indeed died) there are Oda \nand Tokugawa.  I heard or read somewhere that in the version of this movie \nshown on the national Japanese TV broadcast, there was also Uesugi.  There \nalso of course a legend about weeping Uesugi regretting the loss of the \ngreatest enemy.  Why was this scene cut out of the version which went on \ninternational sale/rent?\n\nThanks\n\nTim\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n\n"
