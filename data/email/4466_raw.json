In a manga (Rurouni Kenshin to be exact) translated in italian, unfortunately, I found a poem; I don&#39;t know if it is a haiku or it belongs to other style of poetry or if it  isa novel as well, but it is about the arrive of the Black Ship, about the Commodore Perry.\nI would like to know if someone knows it or tell me where I could find the japanese version.\nI translated it into english, but I don&#39;t know how much it is similar to the original. I don&#39;t know if this could help anyway.\n&quot;the ocean&#39;s sleep stopped\nwhen the monster arrived\nafter four toasts,\nin the night they didn&#39; sleep&quot;\nYour help would be VERY appreciate.\nThanks anyway\nDaniele\n \n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
