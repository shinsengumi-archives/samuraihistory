My personal impression of this book is\nthat he is using material that was circulated in the\nmid 1980&#39;s and has since been dispelled as crap. I\nremember rading and hearing this sort of stuff when I\nstarted training in the Bujinkan in 1985, we have\nmoved on by Turnbull hasnt.\n\nBut saying this I would recommend the book before\nentertheninja .com\n\npaul\n\n\n\n--- Masamori Masami &lt;oni_shogun@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nGenerally samurai looked down on ninjas.

Since\ndiscovering Rurouni \n&gt; Kenshin we have been amazed at the attention to\nhistorical fact \n&gt; involved with this series. We have just started\nbecoming \ninterested \n&gt; in the Samurai histories but can find no info on\nthis group of \n&gt; misunderstood Samurai.
