It is nothing unique in this way of living;  it can be found in the scriptures of all religions, the writings of sages from all over the world, and in the better self help books at your local bookstores.  The difference is in the appearance.\nI never thought to &quot;become a samurai&quot; though years ago there was that fasination.  The closest I ever came was in my karate class where at one point my sensai had to explain to me that this was not the 17th Century.   But from the books that I&#39;ve read and my own understanding and practice of &quot;The Way&quot;, the ideal living, it is all about attaining the higher self: being the best one can be in all endeavors, in all personal interactions, and to oneself.\nNo, you can&#39;t walk around the street with a katana (even if you take kendo, and if you do you will get bad vibes from your sensai, and possibly arrested by the police) but you could possibly learn tranquillity in a crazy world.  Understand how to live because we all will die. To try to escape from life does more harm than good.  We all have our duty as human beings to live here, right now, aware and awake.\nWhether the samurai lived by these ideals or not does not matter. \n&quot;Each one of us has to create his own method.  If you imitate you&#39;ll be wrong.  you have to create for yourself&quot; - Taisen Deshimaru. \nOK, I have to go.  I don&#39;t want to be late for work.\nTake care of yourself, Tim. \n TIMOTHY HEATON &lt;jahladracul@...&gt; wrote:hi my name is timothy heaton of the email\njahladracul@...\ni have inquired this listing of samurai history on my\npersonal behalf for seeking the answers to the meaning\nof my life.i sincerly seek the way of the samurai,i am\nvery serius ,i have much to change about myself and i\nhave tried to live as a smurai would live according to\nwhat i have learned before and it makes sense to me\nbut needs get in the way especialy in america and\nsince there are few places to go for peace anymore.i\nlove the earth and i have proven that by living 25\nyears without a drivers liscense and the ownership of\na pollutting vehichle,i ride a bycycle or walk ,once\nin awhile i except rides,but i insist on standing my\nground for what i believe even when others throw it in\nmy face.i strongly believe in the way of the samurai\nand i choose to be a true samurai no matter what i\nmust do, the way of a samurai in which i have\nattempted has made me feel a like i found were i\nbelong and it means more to me than anything else in\nall of which ive learned in life.sincerly tim heaton\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
