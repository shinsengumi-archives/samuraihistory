Or so they say.\n\nToday Kukishin Ryu Bojutsu is also taugh=\r\nt in the Hon Tai Yoshin Ryu. As well\nas different branches of the Kukishin =\r\nRyu. The mainline of Kukishin Ryu no\nlonger studies Martial arts. The Tensh=\r\nin Hyoho Kukishinden Ryu is connected\ndirrectly to the Kuki family.\n\nIn the=\r\n Bujinkan Dojo Hatsumi sensei has produced a few Bojutsu videos. The\nbest b=\r\neing a kata video for the Kukishinden Ryu Bojutsu. This was made by a\nJapan=\r\nese company. www.ninjutsu.com will sell a copy on NTSC, but if it is a\npal =\r\nversion you are after I know some one in spain and france who can supply\nor=\r\niginal, or maybe I could copy mine for you.\n\npaul Richardson\n\n\n\nTOM HELM &lt;t=\r\noryu@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; --------------------------------------------- =\r\n\n&gt;\tAttachment:=A0 \n&gt;\tMIME Type:=A0multipart/alternative \n&gt; ----------------=\r\n----------------------------- \n\n\n&quot;Dr. Antenor Camili Penteado&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt; &quot; =\r\n(Zen and\n&gt; Marcial Arts) The writer is Taisen Deshimaru a master in Zen.  b=\r\nut I am\n&gt; not quite sure if there is an english edition yet.\n&gt; I have just =\r\nread the new biography written about Miyamoto Musashi that has\n&gt; some infor=\r\nmation about &quot;Bo-jutsu&quot;.\n&gt; I like Bo-jutsu and I would like to receive some=\r\n information about the\n&gt; wooden bastons, its size and interesting informati=\r\non about this art!\n&gt; so, once more nice to meet you!\n&gt; I am sorry for my po=\r\nor english\n&gt; best wishes.\n&gt; Antenor C.
