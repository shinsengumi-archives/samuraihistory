As \n&gt;   you know, he was the most famous warrior of  &quot;The Age of the Country at \n&gt; Peace,&quot;  \n&gt;   the Tokugawa Era, when the age of the great samurai battles like Nagashino,  \n&gt;   Sekigahara,  and Tenno-ji,  outside Osaka Castle in 1615, were past.  In many \n&gt;   respects,  he seems a Japanese version of Cervantes&#39;  Don Quijote.
