I think the reality is a lot more drab and \ndreary than we would like, with the occasional flashes of \nadventure!\n\nBut I agree - Sengoku intel/counterintel ... mmm!\n\n&gt; 2 peasants and a monk, actually. THESE are true\n&gt; &quot;shinobi no mono&quot; or &quot;kusa&quot;. I&#39;d LOVE to do research\n&gt; on the intell techniques of the sengoku, but man,\n&gt; would I have to dig for resources...maybe this new\n&gt; Rekishi Gunzo K is talking about...\n\nIn the Cold War days wasn&#39;t &#39;journalist&#39; the \ncommon cover? I suppose a Tendai Monk walking the\nstreets of Prague or Vienna to the Harry Lime theme \nwould have stuck out a bit...\n\n&gt; Exploding Geisha? I&#39;d pay Y1500 for that ticket!\n\nAnd Tom Cruise could play Shingen!\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
