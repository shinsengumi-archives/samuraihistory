As Clive has said you \ncan&#39;t really learn to recognize quality by reading on the internet, and \nyou can learn some from books but really need to see quality to learn \nto recognize it. I don&#39;t recommend studying junks or fakes either, \nhowever one thing we can learn from the internet is how to recognize \nsome of the fakes and junk that is out there. Please see this link;\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/repro.htm\n\nis it real or not? Here is some additional info to help you decide;\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/realold.htm\n\nThe source is of course the Japanese Sword index, which I am forever \nreferring to, see this link:\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\n\n\tHowever if you don&#39;t find what you are looking for there feel free to \nemail me here on off list, I am always happy to talk Nihonto!\nTom\n\n\n"
