As it picks\nup the story in 1862, I&#39;m a little fuzzy on some\nbackground information that I was hoping someone here\ncould help me with. \n\n1. The Court seems to have had quite a large\ninfluence, especially with pro-Joi sentiment, and\nclearly gives orders to the Bakufu in 1862/1863\nregarding expelling the foreigners in Japan. How/When\ndid the Court gain the power to give orders to the\nBakufu? I realize that the power was always there, so\nto speak, but the court hadn&#39;t done anything political\nsince Go-Daigo and the Nambokucho. Where did this\nCourt resurgence come from?\n\n2. Same question re: Shishi. Totman talks about the\nShishi and the fact that many came from Choshuu and\nMito. Why all of a sudden were ronin all over the\nplace, and particularly from these two places? Did\nMori Yoshichika have a problem governing his han\n(Nagato/Choshuu) that necessitated letting go of\nsamurai? I&#39;m particularly confused about this. \n\n3. I know I probably just haven&#39;t gotten to it yet,\nbut so far (I&#39;m in 1864) the main players are bakufu\nofficials, Tozama daimyo like Shimazu Hisamitsu and\nMori, and the Court nobles. Where do these people\ndisappear to, and how come when we get to the actual\nrestoration the main players are people like Saigo\nTakamori (a retainer of the Shimazu, if I&#39;m correct)\nand Sakamoto Ryoma and so forth? Where do the daimyo\ndisappear to? I understand the bakufu officials--of\ncourse they get defeated or pushed aside or whatever.\nBut if, for instance, Saigo Takamori is a retainer of\nShimazu Hisamitsu, where is the break that he no\nlonger is a retainer and is directly working\ntowards/for Meiji restoration? \n\nI know it&#39;s a lot, thanks for your patience. I&#39;m just\nfrustrated right now--NHK is a 10 min walk from my\nhouse, yet I can&#39;t seem to get it on my TV! No\nShinsengumi for me, sadly!!! \n\nNate\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool. Try it!\nhttp://webhosting.yahoo.com/ps/sb/\n\n"
