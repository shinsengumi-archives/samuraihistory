I was taping it for someone in\n&gt; &gt; exchange for some American\n&gt; &gt; TV shows but he actually didn&#39;t want Shinsegumi. The\n&gt; &gt; problem is, now that\n&gt; &gt; you are in Japan what could you possible give me in\n&gt; &gt; exchange???\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; drop me a line here mickey.letham@... and we\n&gt; &gt; can see what we can do.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ah, but what do you want? You forget I have access to\n&gt;US military bases, and the wonderful fruit of America\n&gt;they provide. We can work something out, I&#39;m sure...at\n&gt;least until I can get NHK figured out!\n&gt;\n&gt;Nate\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
