They were major vassal of t=\r\nhe =C3=94uchi and had more than one branch. I find in my files Sugi Shigeak=\r\ni in 1399, his grandson Yoriaki in 1413. Later, around 1480/90, Sugi Shiget=\r\naka, Shigechika and Takemichi were high officials of the =C3=94uchi. At the=\r\n beginning of the XVIe century, some were among counsellors of the =C3=94uc=\r\nhi&#39;s head (Shigenori, Okinaga) while others served as shugodai of Buzen and=\r\n Chikuzen. In 1528, for instance, Okitsura, son of Okifusa, was shugodai of=\r\n Chikuzen but two years later, the shugodai of that province seems to have =\r\nbeen Okizazu. At the time of the fall of the =C3=94uchi, the counsellor Sug=\r\ni Shigemasa revolted and joined Sue while Sugi Okitsura choose to die like =\r\nhis master =C3=94uchi Yoshitaka in 1551. In 1554, a Sugi Takayasu was kille=\r\nd in Chikugo, fighting against M=C3=B4ri Motonari. All this is a bit confus=\r\ning and would be glad to understand the relationship between those various =\r\nmembers of the Sugi clan as well as their history. Thank you\n\n[Non-text por=\r\ntions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
