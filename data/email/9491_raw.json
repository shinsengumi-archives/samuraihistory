This is a rare opportunity for anyone interested in Japanese swords, \nas this is the first time that these two master craftsmen have appeared \noutside of Japan.\n\nOno Yoshimitsu is a strong candidate to become a Living National Treasure. \nAt the annual sword forging competition he won the top prize (Prince \nTakamatsu Award) four times in a row and five times in totalï¿½a feat \nunachieved by any of his contemporaries. Now ranked mukansa (above \ncompetition level), he no longer has to compete as his blades are guaranteed \ndisplay at the annual exhibition in the Japanese Sword Museum, Tokyo. This \nis a rare chance to see a real master demonstrating some of the processes of \nsword making and view some of his works. Yoshimitsu is renowned for his \nre-creation of the Japanese national treasure sword called the Yamatorige. \nOn this occasion we will be fortunate enough to be able to see this \ndisplayed at the Cyberbudo stand.\n\nAbe Kazunori is a mukansa ranked Japanese sword polisher. A winner of seven \nfirst prizes at the annual sword polishing competition in Japan, he is one \nof the top polishers in Japan today and has been entrusted with polishing \nmany important Japanese swords. Also a producer of oshigata (hand drawn \nrecords of Japanese swords) for a major sword publication, Abe will be \ngiving lectures over the weekend and will be demonstrating traditional \nJapanese sword polishing techniques throughout the day at the Cyberbudo \nstand.\n\nPaul Martin\n\n\n\n"
