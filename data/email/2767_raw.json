I was looking also for more information on\n&gt; each warrior.... looking to link in a back piece to my\n&gt; body suit. Thank you\n\nsorry i dont know about the hakkenden.\n\nanother story you might check out is the suikoden.\nfrom what i remember suikoden is the original chinese title.  japan \nhas its own, slightly personalized, version.  suikoden roughly \ntranslates into &quot;water margin&quot;\npearl buck did the only translation into english that im aware of.  \nits title is &quot;all men are brothers&quot;.\nits hard to find and harder to read.  very dry.\nanyway, the heros of the suikoden are a very popular subject for iri \nzumi.\n(i once came across a book of prints.  very big, very beutifull and \nvery exensive.  i kick myself now for not dropping the 80$ because i \nhavnt seen it since.)\ncheck into suikoden and you might find some interesting characters \nand prints.\n\n\n\n\n"
