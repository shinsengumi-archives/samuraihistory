Organisational \nskills..Earning of respect in his lands ( And from other Daimyo and his \nretainers)..Developing of machinery of government and development of \nagriculture (dam construction and road building etc..) Damn! the list goes \non!\n Who would I have been if I could? Sasaki Shiro Takatsuna of the Uji river \nrace fame.. What a Samurai! On the method he used to acquire his horse for \nthe race alone he would have my respect but that on top of being such a \nwarrior rates him highly on my list..Failing that (although it has already \nbeen taken!) Yagyu Munenori without a doubt. And after that Miyamoto Musashi, \nand after that...See what these questions do to me!\n Abayo!\n Ben.\n\n"
