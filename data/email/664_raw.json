Bryant&#39;s books\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thought you might be interested,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of\n&gt; &gt; Inabayama\n&gt; &gt; took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in Japanese,\n&gt; &gt; including a few he lists in his bibliography state it happened in 1567.\n&gt; &gt; So\n&gt; &gt; you may be thinking, &#39;what&#39;s two or three years?&#39;  Well, what if I told\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; the battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is from page 27 of Japonius Tyrannus the bio of Nobunaga by Jeroen\n&gt; &gt; Lamers:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It has been unclear for a very long time in precisely which year\nexactly\n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga took this mountain castle [Inabayama]. Matsuda Ryo, a local\n&gt; &gt; historian of Gifu Prefecture has convincingly argued that Nobunaga first\n&gt; &gt; captured Mount Inaba in 1564, lost it again to Tatsuoki in 1565, and\n&gt; &gt; finally\n&gt; &gt; took possession of the castle in June 1567.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He cites the book &#39;Nobunaga no Mino koryaku-shi kenkyu&#39; by Matsuda Ryo\nfor\n&gt; &gt; this info.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
