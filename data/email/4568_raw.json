I know it&#39;s not technically samurai history, but it&#39;s a \ngreat illustration of how the term &#39;samurai&#39; is being bandied about \nnowadays.\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - A camouflage-clad German man wielding a samurai \nsword attacked at least seven hikers in forests west of Berlin, \nperforming sword tricks before ordering them to leave the woods, \npolice said Friday. \nThey suspect a 46-year-old local man who trained in martial arts and \nsurvival skills in camps in Papua New Guinea and Vietnam to be the \nattacker. \n\n&quot;He&#39;s dangerous and has been hard to find because he wears \ncamouflage,&quot; said Catrin Feistauer, spokeswoman for the Nauen police \ndepartment. Police have used infrared cameras mounted on helicopters \nto try and track him down. \n\nThe man pushed two elderly people off their bikes and, flashing his \nsword, shouted at them to leave the forest. He later tried to drive a \nyoung couple out of the woods. No one was seriously hurt. \n\n&quot;It&#39;s frightening because the violence level has increased each \ntime,&quot; Feistauer said. \n\n\n\n"
