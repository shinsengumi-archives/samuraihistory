That is (very) unlikely, since the tamahagane would\n&gt;have had to be folded 20 or 21 times depending how you count. The point\n&gt;being that everytime the steel is folded you are adding carbon (and\n&gt;losing impurities), making it tougher / harder and thus more difficult\n&gt;to fold each time, and making the swords cutting edge eventually more\n&gt;brittle. (the inner core of a sword is not folded as often as the\n&gt;outside &#39;skin&#39; for this reason - keeping it simple).\n&gt;\n&gt;I believe you will find that the average no. Of times the outer steel is\n&gt;folded will range from 12 - 16. Indicating just over 65.000 layers of\n&gt;steel when folded 16 times..........\n&gt;\n&gt;- Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Z Recruiting Services\n&gt;     �Zurich Toren� Muzenstraat 89\n&gt;     2511 WB Den Haag\n&gt;     T: +31 70 4262273\n&gt;     F: +31 70 4262111\n&gt;     W: zrecruiting.com\n&gt;     E: info@...\n&gt;     Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en\n&gt;     nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\n&gt;Van: Jack McElwee [mailto:KeimanZero@...]\n&gt;Verzonden: dinsdag 23 december 2003 18:19\n&gt;Aan: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Onderwerp: RE: [samuraihistory] RE: Sharpness in soul or in the steel?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We see you saw the Samurai Warriors special on History Channel running\n&gt;this\n&gt;month on ComcastOnDemand/Cable Faves.
