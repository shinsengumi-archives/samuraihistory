It wasn&#39;t for keeping the samurai down, but\n&gt; for keeping them &quot;up.&quot; That is, in a society without\n&gt; any wars, if you have a military class, you have to\n&gt; have some rational or emotional justification for\n&gt; continuing their benefits. Bushido made the samurai\n&gt; out to be more than just a soldier, and so attempted\n&gt; (I guess successfully) to justify his existence in\n&gt; the non-warring period. Kinda like for america, if\n&gt; we don&#39;t have any perceived military threats, we\n&gt; want to cut military spending. So what does the\n&gt; military do? Come up with all the &quot;be all you can\n&gt; be&quot; and &quot;army of one&quot; and &quot;we&#39;re looking for a few\n&gt; good men&quot; advertising campaigns... which glorifies\n&gt; the military in the public&#39;s eye, and gives it a\n&gt; purpose apart from war... namely the bettering of\n&gt; our citizens by education and experience. Bushido\n&gt; made samurai out to be &quot;honorable citizens&quot; or\n&gt; something to that effect...\n&gt; &gt; All sounds about right to me. But what I meant was\n&gt; that the bushido \n&gt; &gt; was used to keep samurai down in the edo jidai (i\n&gt; know it wasnt \n&gt; &gt; around earlier... im glad you do, because on the\n&gt; message board right \n&gt; &gt; now ive got a heated discussion on my hands with\n&gt; someone who \n&gt; &gt; disagrees.).\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a conspiracy the way we think\n&gt; about it... but it \n&gt; &gt; was a useful tool utilized in this way\n&gt; nonetheless.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &quot;midorinotoradesu&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;bkirkham@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now Kyle, I like that.  You have been fair with\n&gt; all of us by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; explaining what you meant. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do have some thoughts about the whole lineage\n&gt; thing.  I&#39;m not an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; expert, so I hope Tony will correct me if I&#39;m\n&gt; way off.  I do \n&gt; &gt; believe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the practice of one on one combat existed in the\n&gt; early samurai \n&gt; &gt; &gt; period.  Even in the Gempei war many challanges\n&gt; were shouted to \n&gt; &gt; foes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on the existing honor system.  Many\n&gt; Samurai did call out \n&gt; &gt; their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lineage before a battle.  Although it seems\n&gt; silly to us now, we \n&gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to remember how isolated Japan was from the rest\n&gt; of the world.  \n&gt; &gt; They \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had a system of fighting wars that was very\n&gt; different than any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other...Until the Mongols invaded.  Then the\n&gt; Samurai began to wise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up.  &quot;Hey, these Mongols don&#39;t really care about\n&gt; our family do \n&gt; &gt; they?&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My understanding is that the Japanese were\n&gt; totally unprepared to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fight a war with an organized mongolian military\n&gt; machine.  The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But\n&gt; the samurai were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; prepared the second time, and the\n&gt; preparations/strategic \n&gt; &gt; philosophies \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that followed changed the face of Samurai\n&gt; warfare.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Into the Sengoku is when Ashigaru are much more\n&gt; apparent in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; armies.  Long after the lineage practice had\n&gt; been proven unwise by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Mongols (I know, they were actually Korean\n&gt; and Chinese \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conscripts).  So at this point I can&#39;t see them\n&gt; doing it either.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many years later, after a couple hundred years\n&gt; of peace, under the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is\n&gt; about the point \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bushido is crystalized into what we know today. \n&gt; Prior to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; peaceful Edo Jidai, much of the &quot;honor sytem&quot;\n&gt; wasn&#39;t based on \n&gt; &gt; those \n&gt; &gt; &gt; high and holy precepts that everyone thinks the\n&gt; samurai lived by.  \n&gt; &gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was only in the last years of the samurai that\n&gt; the bushido code \n&gt; &gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; influence the population.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess, I too get a little sick of\n&gt; generalizations.  I recently \n&gt; &gt; went \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai\n&gt; and Kensei.  We \n&gt; &gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; informed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido\n&gt; code.  They were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; warriors and role models that were bound by\n&gt; honor to better \n&gt; &gt; society.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; They helped everyone gain greater understanding\n&gt; by standing for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; peace, justice, and the American way (well, they\n&gt; didn&#39;t really say \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that, but they might as well have).  Upon\n&gt; hearing this, I could \n&gt; &gt; hear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There\n&gt; were good and bad \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samurai.  They didn&#39;t all live honorable and\n&gt; they Bushido code \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; affect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you\n&gt; must agree that \n&gt; &gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had some system of honor.  How else could we\n&gt; quantify a good or \n&gt; &gt; bad \n&gt; &gt; &gt; samurai?  But it wasn&#39;t &quot;Bushido&quot; persay.  Since\n&gt; &quot;Bushido&quot; did not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exist in the Sengoku, it probably wasn&#39;t used to\n&gt; keep the troops \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; line.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate\n&gt; their troops but it \n&gt; &gt; may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have been much more simple and less dubious than\n&gt; you presume.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Promises of fame and fortune, political status,\n&gt; social status, \n&gt; &gt; pride, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and land are other methods that could be used to\n&gt; obtain loyalty.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In short, I don&#39;t think that there was a\n&gt; universal conspiracy by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; leaders of the time, to devise a system to keep\n&gt; a brotha down.  \n&gt; &gt; That \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was not the &quot;purpose&quot; of honor or bushido,\n&gt; although it (like \n&gt; &gt; anything \n&gt; &gt; &gt; else) could be perverted and warped to serve\n&gt; sinister means.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brandon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kyle\n&gt; Segall&quot; &lt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Try a little more than Shogun.
