There is really not much to com=\r\npare outside of a few brief conflicts including the Mongol invasions (which=\r\n aren&#39;t an accurate comparison really) and Hideyoshi&#39;s foray in Korea. I gu=\r\ness you could also mention a few conflicts with pirates if you wanted to be=\r\n picky. Any comparison to the warriors of Japan and other groups would make=\r\n for an excellent thesis though.\n\nIf I may throw out some ideas though... T=\r\nheir unique blend of religious/social beliefs, sword making/use, years of a=\r\nrmed conflict and civil wars (practice, you might say), a &quot;Spartan-like&quot; me=\r\nntality regarding death (in some cases). Of course, we all know what happen=\r\ned when these great warriors met up with a more technologically advanced fo=\r\nrce in the mid-late 1800&#39;s. \n\nAn alternative question might be... What made=\r\n Japan a successful warrior nation? It did survive for a long period of tim=\r\ne, and the Tokugawa regime lasted &quot;peacefully&quot; for more than 250 years. \n\nJ=\r\nust a few thoughts... An interesting question.\n\nJonathan P.
