Minor setbacks like Coral Sea, Midway,\nGuadalcanal, Tarawa, New Guinea, Kwajalein, Saipan,\nTinian, Guam, Peleliu, the Phillipines, Iwo Jima, and\nOkinawa only  make the inevitable Imperial victory\nthat much more glorious, right?\n\nIt was HARDLY clear at the time of Guadalcanal that\nJapanese defeat was assured. That&#39;s like saying\nGermany was defeated when it lost North Africa.\nContributed, but it was step 1 of many. \n\nSpeaking as an avid war movie fan and a current\nmilitary member, the Thin Red Line was HORRIBLE. I\ncouldn&#39;t finish it. Very whiny.\n\nNate\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
