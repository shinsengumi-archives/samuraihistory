Remember in Yojimbo, Mifune is hidden in a coffin, more\n&gt;like a big bucket in which the deceased &quot;sat&quot; into eternity. I think\n&gt;in Kagemusha the lord is breifly in a coffin before being placed in\n&gt;the jar, been a long time since I&#39;ve seen that one.\n&gt;\tSorry not the best sources, Sasama gives plenty of ink to executions\n&gt;but none to burials that I can find. Will keep looking.\n&gt;-t\n&gt;\n&gt;On Feb 21, 2007, at 10:31 PM, Barry Thomas wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The opening scenes of the Twilight Samurai comprise a funeral - in\n&gt; &gt; winter.

It&#39;s unlikely a samurai&#39;s funeral was much different from a\n&gt; &gt; common funeral, but probably with more guests and gifts. You know,\n&gt; &gt; burn the body, pick the bones from the ashes with sticks, deposit\n&gt; &gt; remains with a temple, etc...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First I would like to extend my thanks to everyone for their\n&gt; &gt; invaluable wealth of knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m hoping that someone could help point me in the direction of a\n&gt; &gt; resource where I can further research the samurai funeral. To date\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been unable to find substantial information.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; THanks\n&gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nUutisista turhaan tietoon.
