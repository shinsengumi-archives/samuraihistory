Can anyone expand on the cannon t=\r\nheory though? Sounds interesting.&quot;\n\nI had looked into this several months a=\r\ngo (the use or lack thereof of Tokugawa cannon at Sekigahara).\nThe Governor=\r\n-general of Nagasaki (who was also in charge of Kioesjoe, where Adam&#39;s ship=\r\n De Liefde landed) sent a Jesuit to inspect and inventory the ship. Among o=\r\nther things, they found 500 muskets and 19 (or 18, depending on the account=\r\n) bronze guns (cannons). Ieyasu took the guns and cannon after his third in=\r\nterview with Adams. A later Jesuit account states that it was the 19 guns t=\r\nhat provided the margin of victory at Sekigahara. However, none of Adam&#39;s l=\r\netters mention the cannon being used and (aside from a short mention in one=\r\n of Tony&#39;s Osprey samurai books) this was the only mention of the Tokugawa =\r\nforces using cannon at Sekigahara I could find (although it&#39;s well document=\r\ned that Ishida used several). I&#39;ve never seen them mentioned in a Japanese =\r\nsource. Since the Jesuits were known to slant history for their own purpose=\r\ns, my opinion is that the account of the cannon being used was fabricated t=\r\no show the &#39;menace&#39; of Protestant traders in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n"
