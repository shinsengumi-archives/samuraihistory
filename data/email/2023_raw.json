It is really a fascinating book. It does a great job at showing the difference in today&#39;s society compared to how it was then, I think just about everything in Hagakure would be considered obscene in society today.\n\n&quot;the media and Aikido student..&quot; &lt;warrior_of_bushido@...&gt; wrote:I think that may have related to paying attention to detail even by making the book smell nice? \n\nMatthew Hodges &lt;senseichu@...&gt; wrote:Hi, \n\nI would have to say that Hagakure is one of the best sources if you want to know the code and ethics of the Samurai. I have read it over at least 5 times and some of the stuff is very complicated, just because it is hard to understand. If anyone else has read Hagakure and has had this problem, please share what you find hard to understand because their is one such line that I cannot comprehend. &quot;The master took a book from it&#39;s box. When he opened it there was the smell of drying clovebuds.&quot; I find that hard to understand, because that is the only thing in the passage.\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
