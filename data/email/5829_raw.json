Glad to have you aboard. \n\nAs far as helping with your family tree, I know\nKitsuno, the owner of the list, has done some\nextensive genealogical work, but mainly with the more\nfamous families (Oda, etc.). He does have some\nresources that may benefit you though. He&#39;s been gone\nrecently, but maybe he&#39;ll poke his head out and say\nsomething...\n\nNate\n\n--- Eric &lt;smilingotter_7@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt;      I just wanted to take some time to introduce\n&gt; myself, and \n&gt; comment on how neat it is to know that there are\n&gt; groups here that \n&gt; are interested in this topic.  I would like to know\n&gt; if there is \n&gt; anyone who can assist me in researching my family\n&gt; name.I come from a \n&gt; long line of samurai and my ancestors come from the\n&gt; Hiroshima \n&gt; Prefecture, and Kamakura, I believe. My father had\n&gt; the opportunity \n&gt; to be in Japan while he was in the Army after the\n&gt; Second World War \n&gt; and visit our distant relatives. And had the\n&gt; privelige to see the \n&gt; family tree in Hiroshima Prefecture.  I know that my\n&gt; name can be \n&gt; traced back to about 800 years, and that they were\n&gt; samurai. My last \n&gt; name is Kodama.  And from what my pop and\n&gt; grandparents have told me, \n&gt; that it is indeed a very well respected name. Also,\n&gt; that my direct \n&gt; ancestors were over 5feet 11 to 6 feet tall. Which\n&gt; is very unusual \n&gt; for Japanese men.  ( I am 5&#39;11 and 3/4 &quot; tall.)\n&gt; That&#39;s about all for \n&gt; now, but I look forward to hearing from you folk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care and God Bless\n&gt; \n&gt; Yoshio Kodama, Sergeant, US Army\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
