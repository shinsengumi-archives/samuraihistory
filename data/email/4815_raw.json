I suggest you not take things\n&gt;personally.\n\nNate,\n\nRemember from the sentence structure, Solomon, while very well educated, is \n(probably)not a native English speaker. Nuances in writing seldom come \nthrough clearly in our posts and YOU have enough experience dealing with \nthose from other cultures to beware assumptions of tone on a list.\n\nPlus Tony doesn&#39;t need any defenders, although I&#39;ve caught errors a couple \nof times ;)\n\nM.J.
