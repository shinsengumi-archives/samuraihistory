If you MEANT sorts of insanity that I saw\nfrom either militia groups in Michael Moore&#39;s movie \n&#39;Bowling For Colubine&#39; or from Davidians in Waco,\nTexas, you did open a can of worm...\n\n&gt; I do believe there are a lot of people practicing\n&gt; bushido today - in \n&gt; their own way. The Muslim fundamentalist, for\n&gt; example. I DO NOT MEAN to \n&gt; open a can of worm here, I am against violence and\n&gt; the killing of \n&gt; innocents, but the Mujadeens live a spartan life,\n&gt; practice martial \n&gt; arts, believe in religion and are not afraid to die.\n&gt; Quite a few things \n&gt; in common with the Samurai.\n\n\nWell, this is a completely differet story. For your\ninformation, I did support Bush&#39;s war in Iraq\npersonally.\n\n&gt; At the same time, some of the UN/US soldiers\n&gt; probably live a very \n&gt; similar experience.\n&gt; So, I won&#39;t call bushido out as anachronistic, and\n&gt; -even when I will \n&gt; NOT suggest it- I suppose that joining the army is\n&gt; the best way to \n&gt; practice the &#39;way of the warrior&#39; today.\n&gt; cep\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
