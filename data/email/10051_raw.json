I just could never keep up before! Anyway, I had the serendipitous occur=\r\nrence this morning of randomly picking up a book as I was searching for my =\r\nlost checkbook (happens a lot), and I opened said book (Women of the Mito D=\r\nomain by Yamakawa Kikue) to the index area and there before me is the techn=\r\nical equivalence of a koku: it is 5.1 bushels or 180 liters of rice.=20\r\n\r\nUpon checking the index of this work (which was my initial intention anywa=\r\ny), I found a passage concerning the &quot;real&quot; value of koku grants:\r\n\r\nfrom page 150, a quote internally from An Oral Record of Mito History, pub=\r\n. by Takase Shinkyo in the early 1900&#39;s:\r\n\r\n&quot;According to what an old man told me when I was fourteen or fifteen about=\r\n bushi income, a family with a stipend of less than 100 koku could just mak=\r\ne do if the household was limited to the man, his wife, and his parents. If=\r\n, in addition, there were two or three children, they could not make ends m=\r\neet unless the couple engaged in side jobs. Without such additional income,=\r\n they would go deeper and deeper in debt. To lead a decent life, a samurai,=\r\n the old man said, had to have a stipend of at least 300 koku. Asking furth=\r\ner about this, I learned that until the time of Lords Harumori and Harutosh=\r\ni (reigned 1766-1805 and 1805-16, respectively), a retainer with a stipend =\r\nof 100 koku received as his actual income 72 bales of unhulled rice. This r=\r\nate for stipends paid from the domain storehouses was better than that obta=\r\nined by fief holders who collected their income directly from the peasants =\r\nworking their holdings. During the time of Lord Nariaki however, the\r\n domain withheld 4 bales under the pretext of &quot;borrowing back,&quot; leaving th=\r\ne retainer with 68 bales. This &quot;borrowing back&quot; was not limited to just one=\r\n year but continued for three or even=C2=A0 five years at a time. Thus the =\r\nsale of the actual amount of rice received from a stipend of 100 koku would=\r\n not bring even twenty ryo. ...And out of this one had to pay the domain a =\r\nmilitary levy of one-half ryo for every 100 koku of one&#39;s stipend. Although=\r\n at the time prices were very low, a bushi had to keep up a certain lifesty=\r\nle and couldn&#39;t neglect training in the civil and martial arts. What with t=\r\nhese pressures on his budget he had difficulties making ends meet.&quot;\r\n\r\nI also remember reading about the pitiful travails of the Tosa retainer Ta=\r\nni Tannai, as he wrangled with his merchant moneylender in an attempt to pa=\r\ny down his debt. Somehow, the debt kept getting larger. This chronicle appe=\r\nars in Constantine Vaporis&#39; excellent Tour of Duty book. I felt sorry for p=\r\noor old Tani, as he really had no clue about budgeting. One need only look =\r\nat how Tani spent money to realize the irony of the term &quot;samurai economics=\r\n.&quot;=20\r\n\r\nCheers to all!\r\n\r\nOnnamusha\r\n\r\n--- On Fri, 12/25/09, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\r\n\r\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\r\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku\r\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\r\nDate: Friday, December 25, 2009, 1:37 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=C2=A0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n =20\r\n\r\n\r\n   =20\r\n     =20\r\n     =20\r\n      The key phrase is &quot;at the time&quot;--it varied wildly from period to per=\r\niod and even place to place within that period. If you&#39;re more specific wit=\r\nh time I can help you further, but to quickly give you the simple answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If someone was hired at 1500 koku (a koku wasn&#39;t a bushel, by the way, =\r\nbut the amount generally calculated to feed 1 man for 1 year--can&#39;t pull th=\r\ne estimated bushel total out of my wheelhouse at the moment, and my resourc=\r\nes aren&#39;t close at hand), then he was hired at 1500 koku. You can&#39;t calcula=\r\nte the dollar amount without knowing a VERY specific time, because rice pri=\r\nces changed so often, and even then you&#39;re calculating into contemporary cu=\r\nrrency, not today&#39;s figures.=20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Generally speaking if the kokudaka system was used, the retainer was pa=\r\nid in rice. During the mid to late-1500s many daimyo instituted the kandaka=\r\n system, where taxes were collected in kan (coin) and it was the taxpayer&#39;s=\r\n responsibility to convert their produce (not just rice, but whatever they =\r\nhad) into coin. Under that system, a retainer would have been paid in coin.=\r\n Hideyoshi and then Ieyasu reverted back to a koku of rice being the standa=\r\nrdized taxation unit, and therefore what retainers were paid in.=20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Lump sum, yes. This is why you hear so many tales of the women of the h=\r\nouse having to shave their heads and sell their hair, or do other things to=\r\n make ends meet--call it poor budgeting.=20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-     =20\r\n\r\n\r\n   =20\r\n           =20\r\n\r\n                         =20\r\n                        Going Green: Your Yahoo!
