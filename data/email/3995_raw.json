But isn&#39;t he worthy of the fame because he created a new \nmartial art, and also because he was such a good swordsman? Just a \nquestion for all to ponder. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knew \nexactly how to draw both swords properly in Niten Ichi Ryu. Also \ncould anyone tell me where I can find sources that will help me teach \nmyself Niten Ichi Ryu, because there aren&#39;t any schools for it in my \narea.\n&gt;  \n&gt;                                                                                   \nThanks,\n&gt;  \n&gt;                                                                                            \nJoel\nIn a technical sense, (here&#39;s where I make people angry) there aren&#39;t \nany schools that teach &quot;true&quot; Niten Ichi Ryu.  This was the martial \nart that Musashi &quot;invented&quot; but it died with him.  On all the \nhistorical counts that I&#39;ve read, none of his students could master \nthe style.  That&#39;s where it ended.  What is practiced today is based \non specualtion of what Niten Ichi Ryu might have been.  Since none of \nthe techniques of the original art weren&#39;t learned by Musashi&#39;s \ndisciples, &quot;Modern Niten Ichi Ryu&quot; is not even derivitive in nature.  \nIt is a new martial art in itself that pays homage to a man who \nmastered fighting with 2 swords.\n\nBrandon\n          \n\n\n"
