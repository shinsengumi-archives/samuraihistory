I\nknow he finds fault with Taiga Drama at times. But\nexcellent point about not &quot;educating&quot;. We&#39;ll try to\nget some comments on that. \n\n&gt; For example:  the seppuku of General Hasagawa was\n&gt; not accurate from a &#39;formal seppuku&#39; reference\n&gt; point, but what was the historical \n&gt; ritual during/after battle?\n\nIf this were a Sengoku battle, I could simply say\n&quot;there were no *set* rituals yet&quot;, but being as it&#39;s\npost Tokugawa and all those fun Bushido rules had been\ncodified, there in fact *were* rules about how to do\nthese sorts of things. I&#39;m not the slightest bit of an\nEdo period expert, so I couldn&#39;t help you with the\ndetails, alas. But I would think that most of the\n*rules* didn&#39;t apply in battlefield situations--there\nhad been perilously few battles in the previous 250\nyears for the situation to come up. \nYour description of flaws you observed sounds fine to\nme, given that even though this was on a battlefield,\nthe customs of the time would dictate certain\netiquette, possibly. \n\n\n&gt; Armor: I don&#39;t know from squat, and would love to\n&gt; learn.  Yes, I&#39;ve read Tony&#39;s pages. My questions\n&gt; are these, so far:  how \n&gt; impoverished was the samurai class by the Meiji\n&gt; period; hadn&#39;t the shogunate been defunct by around\n&gt; twenty years by the time frame \n&gt; of the movie; and how many generations might a suit\n&gt; of armor last?\n\nTaken care of, it could last quite a long time. As for\nhow impoverished were they? Well, there were rich\nsamurai, and poor ones. The Shogunate doesn&#39;t enter\ninto this, since as you point out it was defunct for 2\ndecades, so I&#39;m not sure where you are going with that\nquestion. But while there are many tales of samurai\nselling their swords to eat, or daimyo letting their\nretainers go at the end of the Edo period, there were\nalso Daimyo who remained wealthy. The Daimyo of the\nChoshu han let many of his retainers go under the\npretext of poverty, but with the added intention of\nproviding a marauding disturbance for the Shogunate to\ndeal with. \n\n  I want to\n&gt; know the specific differences between history,\n&gt; tradition, and &#39;dramatic \n&gt; license.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, a challenge:   I know it is easy to be an\n&gt; armchair jockey or quarterback.....    and it is\n&gt; possible to gain a position on a \n&gt; film production crew as a technical advisor.....   \n&gt; instead of complaining,  how about being pro-active\n&gt; and get involved in the \n&gt; process?\n\nI think Tony&#39;s done that. \n\nBear with me, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen it. As\nKitsuno has said, it&#39;s watchable to me, if I suspend\nhistorical knowledge and watch it as a story taking\nplace somewhere that sort of looks like Japan. \n\nMain issues I had:\n\n1. Samurai didn&#39;t despise guns. They used them very\neffectively 300 years before the events in the movie\nsupposedly take place. Suggesting otherwise makes the\nmovie romantic, but kills any semblence of reality. \n\n2. Katsumoto, being a Daimyo, should have lived a\nlittle better than in some remote mountain village. It\nplayed more into the &quot;Dances with Samurai&quot; theme for\nhim to do so. \n\n3. The ninja attack was pure Hollywood. It was only\nthere because any Hollywood samurai movie has got to\nhave a ninja attack, right?\n\n4. Gaijin = no meet Emperor. That was pure silliness. \n\n5. Katsumoto is LOOSELY based on Saigo Takamori. As\nin, he was the leader of a group of disgruntled, armed\nSamurai who took umbrage with being deprived of their\nstatus. That&#39;s about the extent.\n\n6. MOST IMPORTANT POINT: Ahlgren&#39;s\ndrunkenness--deplorable. No self-respecting member of\nthe 7th Cavalry would fail to hold their liquor like\nthat. I should know--I&#39;ve been in the 7th twice! We\nwere a hard-drinking group, for sure--Ahlgren would\nhave wilted like a pansy. \n\nI&#39;ll probably end up watching it again, and I&#39;ll be\nable to talk about some more. I actually liked the\nmovie, but then again, I had convinced myself it took\nplace on another planet. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nMeet the all-new My Yahoo! - Try it today! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
