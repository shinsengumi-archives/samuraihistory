And sorry\nNate for not being clearer in my phrasing.  I knew the definition of koku,\nand that generally - at least in the literature I&#39;ve been reading - that\nterm isn&#39;t used, just the number of bushels or rice of the stipend.  I did\nlocate a couple of online sources that indicated that samurai were paid\neither directly in rice, or, in non-rice growing regions, in coin.  And that\nreally is what had me confused. As in the source Deborah quoted, I&#39;m not\nunderstanding the mechanics of this rice economy.  It seems to be terribly\ninefficient.\n\nIn any given daimyo, the farmers have to grow the rice, then harvest it,\nthen it is gathered to the granaries, then distributed. So to use Nate&#39;s #2\nwhen kokudaka was employed if I understand correctly: each year people show\nup at a samurai&#39;s door - or barracks if they are castle samurai - with all\nthese koku?  Where would one keep 500 or even a thousand koku?  How do they\nconvert the koku into the money they would need to purchase household goods,\nclothes, etc?  Would samurai living in households pay their staff with rice\nin the same way they are paid? Would the staff convert their rice to coin\nthe same way?  How do people who are not paid in rice get their rice?\nSpecifically, the poor, who are barely surviving? From what I&#39;ve read they\ndon&#39;t eat much rice at all, mostly millet and other poorer grains.\n\nI&#39;ve read previously that a family would need 250 - 300 koku to keep just\nabove the poverty level.  But I&#39;m getting the impression that families had a\nmuch harder time than &#39;barracks samurai&#39; who appear to have a fair amount of\ndisposable income even though they might be paid far less.  So my dilemma is\nin understanding how the mechanics of the economy worked.  I understand a\ngold economy, a barter economy.  I am not understanding a rice economy. But\nthank you for making it a little clearer\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
