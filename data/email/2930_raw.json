Whether Gothic or Maximilian,  German or Italian \n  or French, the armourers seemed to take more care in what we would call the \n  ergonomics of armor than did their contemporaries in Japan.  If one studies \n  merely the arm defenses of both knight and samurai...not getting into the \n  technical terms French or Japanese..it seems apparent (at least to me)  that there \n  was more technical sophistication, including armpit armor,  in the armor shops \n  of Augsburg than in Sakai.  Of course, the question arises also did Japan have \n  the mineral resources to produce all the steel armor  that Europe had?
