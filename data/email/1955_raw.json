I thought this was Japan, not ancient Greece !!\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSee the movie Gohatto... I just thought it was another chanbara. Luckily \nI borrowed it from the library and did not buy it.\n\n&gt; Thanks, I&#39;ve taken a look, this one seems to be a 1.33:1 screen format, \n&gt;I&#39;ve also seen one being advertised 2.35:1 is that right...or has some got \n&gt;things a little awry?  \n&gt;\nNo, one is a wide screen version and the other is normal, another way to \nexpress it is 4:3 (normal) 16:9 (wide). (I work with too much video!) \nWide screen was uncommon until the 50&#39;s, most older films were shot in \nthe 4:3 ratio. (former film major also)\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
