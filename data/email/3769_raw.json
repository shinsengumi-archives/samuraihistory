It&#39;s the best board game about Japan I&#39;ve\nseen...not familiar with too many others. \n\nI&#39;m a big fan of Shogun:Total War and it&#39;s follow-ups,\nthough they aren&#39;t the greatest accuracy wise, they\nmake up for it in game play. And of course if you have\naccess to Japanese games, the Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition\n(Nobunaga no Yabou) series is still going strong (just\nbought a new one a week or so ago!)\n\nNate\n\n--- Kevin Burns &lt;kevin@...-net.ne.jp&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What is your favourite game about Samurai history?\n&gt; \n&gt; I live in Kanagawa, Japan and have done for many\n&gt; years. I like it \n&gt; here.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far my favourite is Shogun or Samurai Swords by\n&gt; Milton Bradley. \n&gt; But I haven`t played so many yet. I have also played\n&gt; a Japanese\n&gt; game called Sekigahara by 6 Angles. Another game by\n&gt; 6 Angles\n&gt; depicted the Mongol invasion of Japan--the one where\n&gt; the &quot;Kamikaze&quot;\n&gt; or Divine Wind intervened. Another good\n&gt; simulation--it game one the\n&gt; feeling of being there, as much as a game can.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your thoughts on games please.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; http://www009.upp.so-\n&gt; net.ne.jp/englishschool/hisgamingopeningpage.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
