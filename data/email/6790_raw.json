The outer\nwalls remained the same, but the tenshaku was larger\nand placed differently to that of the Toyotomi-period\nOsaka castle.&quot;\nThat&#39;s correct about the tenshaku-it was a different\ncolor too (black-Toyotomi, white-Tokugawa). The\nTokugawa one also bit the dust (struck by lighting in\nthe 1600&#39;s) and didn&#39;t get rebuilt until the 1930&#39;s. \nHowever, the outer walls are not the Toyotomi\noriginals. The Tokugawa covered the entire complex\nwith dirt (building a small mountain on top) and under\nthe guidance of Todo Takatora built all new ones. Many\nof the stones have the mon of the lord who was\nresponsibile for constructing that section of wall,\nand the Osaka Castle museum actually inspected and\ncatalogued EVERY SINGLE STONE!!! in the walls a few\nyears back. Why? Seems symbolic more than anything\nelse. The old walls were perfectly good. As stated\nearlier, they have conducted excavations and uncovered\nsome of the Toyotomi walls.\nSeveral publications sold at the Osaka-jo museum have\ngreat diagrams of all this. Gakken also just released\na new book that recreates the Toyotomi version of the\ncitadel with computer graphics. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nCelebrate Yahoo!&#39;s 10th Birthday! \nYahoo!
