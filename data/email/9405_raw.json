My question is this--what year \nwas that battle an=\r\nd was there ever such a tournament? Who won? The \nanime concerns a Battousa=\r\ni or Legendary manslayer nicknamed &#39;Demon Eyes \nKyo&#39; whose spirit/soul inha=\r\nbits the body of a younger hero named \nYushira.

I think that Shina th=\r\ne gal bounty hunter&#39;s 3 \nbarrelled flintlock pistol is just smoke and mirro=\r\nrs and was never a \nreal weapon since flintlocks do not have rotating barre=\r\nls.
