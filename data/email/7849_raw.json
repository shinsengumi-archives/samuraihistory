I snipped out some of your post in the interest of\nbrevity and saving bandwidth.\n\nI believe that the idea of &quot;The Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai&quot; came about\nduring the Edo period. This was during the time of peace and various\nscholars and others of the samurai class were seeking basically for a\n&quot;raison d&#39;etre&quot; (reason for being) for their class. Many of them began\nintensive studies of various forms of bujutsu and the concept of &quot;budo&quot; was\nborn during this era. I read somewhere (not sure where I read it) that the\nconcept of the sword being a samurai&#39;s soul was first expressed by Tokugawa\nIeyasu after he became the Shogun, but don&#39;t hold me exactly to this. \n\nSaying that a sword was a samurai&#39;s &quot;soul&quot; was designed to make him more\n&quot;spiritual,&quot; that his sword and study and preservation of budo (martial way)\nwas an ideal for a samurai to strive for when there was peace and no longer\nany actual wars for a samurai to practice any bujutsu (martial tactics).\n\nNeedless to say, this was an idealistic view put forth. In reality, many\nsamurai became a lot more interested in commerce and administration than in\nmartial arts; the actual &quot;soul&quot; of the administrative samurai was more\nlikely to be an abacus rather than a sword. But the daisho (the two swords)\nbecame a status symbol, a badge showing rank rather than a real &quot;soul&quot; so to\nspeak.   \n\nThen there were the struggling ronin and low-ranked, low-paid clan samurai,\nmost who were more concerned with surviving and feeding their families\nrather than in whether their sword was their &quot;soul&quot; or not. These were the\nones who would likely pawn their swords and wear hidden bamboo swords. The\nfilm SEPPUKU deals with one of these ronin who did so. This film challenges\nthe official, prevailing Edo-era definition of &quot;the sword is the soul&quot; as a\nconcept that has become empty and hypocritical in the face of rank\noppression and cruelty. \n\nI believe that there were a few samurai who followed the path of &quot;musha\nshugyo&quot; the martial journey, traveling all over the country in pursuit of\nstudying kendo and other budo. But they were most likely in the minority.\n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Thomas Davidson\nSent: Friday, October 14, 2005 8:57 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?\n\nHang on a minute - \n\n[snips]\n\nThe sword never played a significant part of the samurai psyche until the\nEdo period and later, when it came to symbolise the &#39;martial way&#39; for what\nwas by majority a bureaucracy. \nSwords then began to attain a &#39;value&#39; out of all proportion to that of the\npast.\n\n[snips]\n\nThe &#39;best&#39; samurai will remain forever anonymous - discreet and efficient in\nthe service of his master (samurai is from the verb &#39;to serve&#39;) - it&#39;s quite\npossible he never saw a battlefield, never even drew his sword in anger. \n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
