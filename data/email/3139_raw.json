Pretty much the\n&gt; two are very much intertwined and your ancestors were\n&gt; once retainers to the Shimazu. The Kyushu Samurai was\n&gt; a very fearsome, brave and honorable warrior. Notable\n&gt; examples being the Shimazu of Satsuma, the Ryuzoji and\n&gt; Nabeshima of Hizen.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Satsuma samurai proved themselves in battles\n&gt; across Kyushu, Korea and Sekigahara. At Sekigahara the\n&gt; Satsuma samurai were on the Toyotomi side. Though\n&gt; defeated their Daimyo, Shimazu Yoshihiro ordered a\n&gt; charge straight through the enemy center. Breaking\n&gt; through the Satsuma Samurai were able to retreat and\n&gt; make it back to Kyushu. Observing this the Tokugawa\n&gt; generals were dumbfounded. Tokugawa Ieyasu just shook\n&gt; his head and said &quot;only a Satsuma samurai would\n&gt; retreat by attacking and that they may have lost the\n&gt; battle but not their courage&quot;. This would later be\n&gt; known as Shimazu no nokiguchi or Shimazu style\n&gt; retreat.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many examples of their courge and tenacity\n&gt; in the face of ovewhelming odds. Being defeated only\n&gt; by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1587 and Tokugawa Ieyasu in\n&gt; 1600. Each time the Satsuma samurai impressed their\n&gt; enemies greatly with their courage and honor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suggested research: Shimazu Takahisa, Shimazu\n&gt; Yoshihisa, Shimazu Yoshihiro, and Shimazu Iehisa\n&gt; \n&gt; also notable vassal families: Iriki-in, Togo, Niiro,\n&gt; Ijuin, Hongo, Kiire, Hirada, Machida, Uwai,\n&gt; Tamegashima, Kawakami, Kimotsuki, Honda\n&gt; \n&gt; There is alot more info out there and I have only\n&gt; scratched the surface. I hope I was of some help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck in your research and please share anything\n&gt; you find. I&#39;ll be more than happy to share what I\n&gt; discover.\n&gt; \n&gt; One day I wouldn&#39;t mind sharing my Grandfathers story.\n&gt; But not today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well I&#39;ve babbled enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jake \n&gt; --- Rob &lt;zarathu_stra@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Actually, I&#39;d like to know a bit about Satsuma\n&gt; &gt; region as well for personal reasons. My name is\n&gt; &gt; Robert Omura. My grandfather was Kenji Omura who\n&gt; &gt; came from the Kagoshima region of Japan and came to\n&gt; &gt; Canada in the early 20th C. He was the eldest son of\n&gt; &gt; a samurai family. I never knew my grandfather as he\n&gt; &gt; died in an internment camp in British Columbia.\n&gt; &gt; Before WWII my grandfather held title to property\n&gt; &gt; from Vancouver to Montreal, but these were\n&gt; &gt; confiscated and sold to Veterans Affairs during the\n&gt; &gt; war. My father, who was born in Canada, inherited\n&gt; &gt; his estate years ago, and was contacted in the late\n&gt; &gt; 1970&#39;s by his cousin there and, because he had never\n&gt; &gt; been to Japan, he transferred title to the lands to\n&gt; &gt; his cousin. These were in the Kagoshima area. I\n&gt; &gt; understand that he was adopted to the Watabe family\n&gt; &gt; as a child, but changed his name back to Omura. I am\n&gt; &gt; told that my great-grandfather was asked to move to\n&gt; &gt; the capital to run the Japanese tax system -- late\n&gt; &gt; Meiji period, but refused. I also\n&gt; &gt;  understand that the records are largely complete in\n&gt; &gt; Kagoshima, having been largely spared by the war.\n&gt; &gt; Any hints or suggestions on tracking more\n&gt; &gt; information would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; jacob gerhard &lt;madbearscave@y...&gt; wrote:Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My name is Jake.

I have a intrest in the\n&gt; &gt; Shimazu\n&gt; &gt; Clan of Satsuma province.
