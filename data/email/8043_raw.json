Each school of swordsmiths shaped\ntheir nakago in different and individual ways. Also the file marks\n(yasurime) are often an indication of school, swordsmith and age. Of course,\nany inscription is important as well as the natural patination of the nakago\nwhich can indicate the age as well as wether the nakago has been interfered\nwith. All these things may be damaged by cleaning.\n\nFurther, although a polished blade should never be touched with the bare\nskin, for reasons that have already been given, it is quite acceptable to\nhold the nakago in the naked hand. In this case the natural oils and sweat\nin the skin will actually (over many years) aid the patination.\nFor your own peace of mind, I cannot believe you will have done any damage\nin the short time you seem to have had your sword.\n\nAs for your other question, I am afraid I cannot comment on Paul Chen swords\nwhich I do not really class as Japanese swords. However, I can say that\nswords made in the immediate pre Meiji period, the Bakamatsu period, and\nwhich we call shinshinto (new new swords) were made to be used and that some\nvery fine blades were made by such swordsmiths as Masahide, Kiyomaro,\nNaotane and Munetsugu. These swords were often of sturdy proportions and\nattempts to opy the styles of  blades of the Kamakura and Yoshino\n(Nambokucho) periods.\nThey had true hamon having gone through the quenching process and I am\nunsure even if swords from China are hand made and water quenched or, in\nother words, made in the traditional manner. Today, there are some 350\nlicensed swordsmiths making swords in Japan and they are quite strictly\ncontrolled but all use traditional methods in order to keep the craft alive.\n\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;mark kd&quot; &lt;depos42300@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 25, 2005 5:48 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new katana HELP PLEASE!!!!\n\n\nhi federico,\n     so.....i should never clean the tang again? will it effect the rest of\nthe blade? b/c i already tried to clean it will it now ruin the blade?\n                                       Thanks,\n                                         Mark\n\nfederico trejos &lt;federicotrejos@...&gt; wrote:\n  Good morning.\n\nOk.   If you bent the pin, the best thing to do now is\nbuy a new one.   Next: never, never, NEVER; clean the\nTang.  That rust is a good indicative of how old is\nyour sword.   Since your sword is a very recent piece,\nit really does not matter to date it now... but who\nknows the future.\nFinally, you already buy a very beauty, expensive and\nfine sword.   Do not ruin it. The only way to clean a\njapanese sword is the one Mr. Sinclaire explain you.\nDo not do anything diferent than that.\nI strongly encourage you to read the articles in this\nwp :\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\nYou will find a lot of useful info here.\n\nBest regards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis!\nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS\n        Samurai   Japan   Japan airline\n\n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
