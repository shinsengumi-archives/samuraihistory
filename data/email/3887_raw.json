I think we all owe Stephen Turnbull (for the books) and \nAkira\n&gt; Kurosawa\n&gt; (for the films) - a mixture of both of them, with a dash of James \nClavell\n&gt; thrown in - is probably what got most of us started on this \nfascinating\n&gt; subject and country!\n&gt; For me is was Turnbulls&#39;s The Samurai: A Military History, the \nfilm\n&gt; Kagemusha and the novel and TV version of Shogun.\n&gt; Michael\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the record, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever mocked anything \nSteve&#39;s written.\n&gt; Given\n&gt; &gt; my own position, it would be in rather bad taste. I generally \nstay clear\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; conversations about his work. For myself, it was his big \nsamurai history\n&gt; book\n&gt; &gt; that was the first non-fiction book on the subject I ever read, \nso I owe\n&gt; him. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tony\n\n\n\n"
