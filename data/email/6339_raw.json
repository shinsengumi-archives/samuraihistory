This does not mean the sensei \nis=\r\n a kami, a figure of divine reverence, but the meaning of sensei is \n&#39;one w=\r\nho is born before&#39;, the sensei is further along the road than\nhis disciple.=\r\n\n\nThe stories of a disciple&#39;s devotion to his sensei are many and\nlegendary=\r\n. Almost every ryu has some tale of such, and alongside \nthem are the tales=\r\n of the rigours endured by the disciple along the \npath at the hands of his=\r\n master. Kil Bill II shows how this has\nentered popular consciousness.\n\n(Me=\r\nntion should also be made of the soke - the direct descendant of\nthe founde=\r\nr. The soke is not necessarily the senior instructor, but\nthe superior swor=\r\ndsman will show all due reverence towards his soke \nout of respect.)\n\nThis =\r\nrelationship is founded on Shinto principle, of reverence\ntowards one&#39;s anc=\r\nestor, be it by birth or by calling. It was later \ndeveloped by Shingon and=\r\n Zen, then later again by Confucian and \nTaoist principles, this last by wh=\r\nich the Tokugawa bakafu managed to \nbuild the cult of obligation and obedie=\r\nnce with which to control the\nfiercely independent samurai - a class marked=\r\n by its vanity and its\npride.\n\nTowards the end of the Sengoku Zen become th=\r\ne language of the\nswordsman&#39;s development, even if the practice was founded=\r\n in Shinto, \nShingon, etc. Dave Lowry, in Autumn Lightning, expresses it th=\r\nus:\n\n&quot;Katsujinken, satsujinken (the sword that gives life, the sword that\nd=\r\nestroys life) is an adage that has been brushed on inspirational\nscrolls hu=\r\nng in Yagyu ryu dojo and on certificates and teaching \nlicenses awarded to =\r\nits bugeisha.=A0 It is found in the treatises\nwritten by Munenori and other=\r\ns. More importantly than anywhere \nelse, katsujinken, satsujinken must be i=\r\nnscribed on the hearts of the \npractitioners of the ryu. In a way, it is at=\r\n the very core of what\nthe Yagyu tradition is all about.&quot;\n\nIt is these stru=\r\nctures, I think, that largely precluded the mystique\nof the sword as we wes=\r\nterners view it. The devotion to an object\nsimply does not fit the mindset.=\r\n The object of mystery, and the\nobject of the swordsman&#39;s devotion, in any =\r\nliterature I have read, \nis always the master, be he a distant founder or o=\r\nne&#39;s immediate\nsensei.\n\nJust some thoughts on recent discussions.\n\nThomas\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"
