They were major vassal of t=\r\nhe =D4uchi and had more than one branch. I find in my files Sugi Shigeaki i=\r\nn 1399, his grandson Yoriaki in 1413. Later, around 1480/90, Sugi Shigetaka=\r\n, Shigechika and Takemichi were high officials of the =D4uchi. At the begin=\r\nning of the XVIe century, some were among counsellors of the =D4uchi&#39;s head=\r\n (Shigenori, Okinaga) while others served as shugodai of Buzen and Chikuzen=\r\n. In 1528, for instance, Okitsura, son of Okifusa, was shugodai of Chikuzen=\r\n but two years later, the shugodai of that province seems to have been Okik=\r\nazu. At the time of the fall of the =D4uchi, the counsellor Sugi Shigemasa =\r\nrevolted and joined Sue while Sugi Okitsura choose to die like his master =\r\n=D4uchi Yoshitaka in 1551. In 1554, a Sugi Takayasu was killed in Chikugo, =\r\nfighting against M=F4ri Motonari. All this is a bit confusing and I would b=\r\ne glad to understand the relationship between those various members of the =\r\nSugi clan as well as their history. Thank you\n\n\n"
