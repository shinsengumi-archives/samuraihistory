Exactly like Tony said,\n&quot;samurai&quot; was a status, not a job. You can&#39;t &quot;give it\nup&quot;. It&#39;s a hereditary social status. You don&#39;t do\nanything to become a &quot;samurai&quot; but be born to a\nsamurai family. Generally speaking, you don&#39;t do\nanything to stop being &quot;samurai&quot; but die. Even if\nbanished or something, that didn&#39;t take away who\nsomeone was. You could be banished to live with the\nHinin or Eta or Ezo or whomever, and you were a\nsamurai living with the hinin or eta or ezo. You were\nborn samurai, you lived samurai, you died samurai. No\none ever bothers to ask questions like this about the\nBrahmin caste in India. It&#39;s very simple. \n\n\n--- James Eckman &lt;ronin_engineer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Samurai was a (hereditary) social status, like the\n&gt; class of the hereditary \n&gt; &gt;knightly class in Europe -- it wasn&#39;t a job.
