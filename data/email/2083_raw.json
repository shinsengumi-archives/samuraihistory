Many samurais, especially those of lower ranks, began to \ndoubt the power of the Shogunate in defending the country against \nforeign powers, especially when they had seen the armed blackships. \nThe slogan &quot;Sonno-Joi&quot; (Rever the emperor, dispel the barbarians) \nwas winning more and more support, such that samurais desert their \nhans to come to Kyoto to join the revolutionary movements. (In those \ndays deserting your han can be one of the most condemned sins - once \nyou desert, you can never return to it, on pain of death.) \n\nSuch roshis (masterless samurais, but not ronins and definitely not \nrurounis) increased in Kyoto, causing more and more disturbances at \nthe capital. In those early days of unsatisfied feelings, most of \nthe roshis still did not have a clear idea of what movement or who \nthey should follow. All they knew was that they were impatient and \neager to do something to defend Japan. There were myriads of schools \nof thought - Sonno-joi, open up the country to learn from the gaijin \nand in turn attact them using the same technologies, support the \nBakufu - as Watsuki once remarked, it was an era where 100 people \nmay hold 100 different arguments and you can&#39;t say who&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s \none factor which makes this era as tumultuous and interesting as it \nis. The Bakufu decided that it would be to their advantage if they \ntook such roshis without any stand yet into their service, rather \nthan letting them roam about the capital. Hence, Roshi-tais (bands \nof wave samurais) were formed and roshis enlisted under respective \nBakufu samurais, where the &quot;entry requirements&quot; were one&#39;s sword \nskills (kenjutsu matches, something like an exam, were held.) This \nhappened in 1863 or 3rd Year of Bunkyuu, one year after Kaoru&#39;s \nbirth. \n\n*note direct from a website\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;merridewe&quot; &lt;merridewe@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Thanks for this. OK then I have one more question: What is the \n&gt; Roshitai?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt; \n&gt; St. John Lord Merridewe\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;serizawakamo&quot; &lt;\n&gt; serizawakamo@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Shinchogumi is not Shinsengumi. Shinchogumi was also \n&gt; derived from the \n&gt; &gt; Roshitai, just like the Shinsengumi, but the Shinsengumi \n&gt; members \n&gt; &gt; stayed in Kyoto while the Shinchogumi ones retreated back to \n&gt; Edo.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe you have already got this book, but if not perhaps you \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; give a look at &quot;Samurai Sketches&quot;, by Romulus Hillsborough. It \n&gt; is a \n&gt; &gt; bit novelized, but still a very interesting depiction (and very \nwell \n&gt; &gt; researched) of some Shinsengumi members, including Isami \n&gt; Kondo and \n&gt; &gt; Kamo Serizawa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope that helped...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new. Hope I&#39;m in the right place to ask this. I&#39;m \n&gt; researching \n&gt; &gt; &gt; key figures of the Shinsengumi, particularly Isami Kondo and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kamo Serizawa. They were of course members of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shinsengumi, but I&#39;ve also run accross something called the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shinchogumi. It that the same thing? If not, what is it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any help much appreciated,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; St. John Lord Merridewe\n\n\n\n"
