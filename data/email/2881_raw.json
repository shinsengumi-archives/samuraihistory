You \ncan give yourself a good slice but that would be the limit unless you \ndid something really swift and dropped it and the tried to catch it! Get \nhold of some well sharpened carpenters tools or microtomes and then you \nwill now how sharp is sharp. I like old American chisels or the new \nJapanese chisels, they are both high carbon steel that will take a great \nedge. They have planing contests in Japan where they try to remove the \nthinnest, most consistent shaving and in the old days they would pin \nsuch things up in wood shops in the US.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J.
