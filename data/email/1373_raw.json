Nobuhide kidnapped (or intercepted, if you like) Takechiyo \n(Tokugawa Ieyasu) and demanded that Tokugawa Hirotada give up Okazaki \nin return for his son&#39;s life.  Of course he refused, but Nobuhiro \ndecided not to kill Ieyasu anyway. In the book (which is of course \nfiction) the implication is that Nobuhide was ready and willing to \nkill Ieyasu, but Nobunaga was the one that stopped his father from \nkilling the boy - although it doesn&#39;t say it straight out, the story \nimplies that he was fond of the kid and was hoping his father would \nadopt him into the Oda clan.\nMy question is, is there any basis in fact for this, or are \nNobunaga&#39;s actions in the book artistic license on the part of the \nauthor?\n\n\n"
