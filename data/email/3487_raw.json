Bryant is one of the foremost experts on Japanese history \nand the Samurai.  I own five of his Osprey Military titles \n(Sekigahara 1600, Early Samurai, Samurai 1550-1600,The Samurai, and \nThe Samurai Elite Series).  He also wrote the RPG Sengoku.  If anyone \nin this group knows what he&#39;s talking about, it&#39;s Tony.  You need to \nlook at his books before you start dropping silly remarks about him \n&quot;disliking or thinking the samarais are stupid&quot;.  Oh, by the way the \nplural form of Samurai is Samurai not Samurais.\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, roland holland &lt;\nonyxtsunami@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; maybe its just me but if you dislike or think samurais are stupid \nwhy are you here?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Anthony J.
