I&#39;m new here, just for the purpose of some light research. \n\nCould anyone help me find a Samurai by the following description: \n\n  - Lived before 1750\n  - Was the major hero / contributor to the DEFENSE of a particular \n    village / household etc. \n  - Basically, if he disappeared just before a certain time, a lot of \n    people would be in trouble without him. \n\nIf you are aware of this certain Samurai who saved the village / \nhousehold, and feel like educating me, any information you wish to \nprovide would be very helpful. Terminology, names, place, times, etc. \nwould all be helpful as well. However, I realize that I am asking for \none of probably a thousand needles in a haystack, so if you just \nprovide a Samurai&#39;s name, that would be a huge help all by itself. \n\nThank you very much. \n\nMickey\n\n\n\n\n"
