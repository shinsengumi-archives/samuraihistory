Most people who know of/have hea=\r\nrd of Kawakami Gensai the most well known of the hitori, believe him a fict=\r\nional character made up by someone with an imagination (and a very good one=\r\n at that).  But then there are the exeptional few who believe he is a true =\r\nperson in our history that helped bring the knew era.  The only thing about=\r\n this person is that there is very few facts that says he was a real person=\r\n or not.  so its up to you to decide in your own mind was this person real =\r\nor fictional.  My own believes are that this person helped bring the age of=\r\n the new era,  That he was the best japanese swordsman that there was,  and=\r\n most importantly I blieve that he is a Real historical character/a real Pe=\r\nrson that was there to experiance the      shed of Japans battlefields.\n\nRo=\r\nberto Cedillo &lt;nei_ye@...&gt; wrote:\n\nHello please help me in these ques=\r\ntion......
