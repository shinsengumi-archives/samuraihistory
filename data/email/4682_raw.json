Sadly many \ngreat te=\r\nmples and shrines are reduced to just the main buildings on \ntracts just bi=\r\ng enough to hold them...\n-t\n\n&gt;  Yes it makes absolute sense. If you were to=\r\n read Turnbulls text that \n&gt; goes\n&gt;  with the map it would be more clear as=\r\n to why I was confused. He \n&gt; states\n&gt;  that the Byou-dou-in lies between N=\r\nara and the Uji bridge. Which is \n&gt; true,\n&gt;  but looking at the map you wou=\r\nld think that it was located somewhere \n&gt; along\n&gt;  the road running south f=\r\nrom the bridge. Thats why the rest of his\n&gt;  description of the battle was =\r\nhard to follow. You would never know \n&gt; that the\n&gt;  building was within vie=\r\nw of the bridge.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Cheers\n&gt;  Bill &quot;The creativity never stops&quot; M.\n&gt;  :-)=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  Original Message:\n&gt;  -----------------\n&gt;  From: Oyakata oyakata@odano=\r\nbunaga.com\n&gt;  Date: Fri, 25 Jun 2004 22:09:42 -0400\n&gt;  To: samuraihistory@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Attn: Jay and Cesare\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n On Fri, 25 Jun 2004 12:35:05 -0000, Bill M.=1B$B$5$s=1B(B wrote in message=\r\n\n&gt;  &lt;cbh65p+6icl@...&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Gents,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I just uploaded the map f=\r\nrom Turnbull. It is in the files section in\n&gt;  &gt;a folder called Bill M. Cre=\r\native ain&#39;t I! :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;  A wonderful piece of brainstorming. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;If any=\r\nbody can mark on the map where the Byodo-in is I wouls be\n&gt;  &gt;greatly pleas=\r\ned. Any other details you can add would be great as \n&gt; well!\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think I=\r\n see one potential problem. The Turnbull map is a much larger\n&gt;  scale than=\r\n the maps I&#39;ve been linking to. The map from the book is\n&gt;  indeed oriented=\r\n the same way - North is up. But the scal is so much\n&gt;  larger, that Uji ap=\r\npears as just a dot. The maps that I&#39;ve linked to\n&gt;  recently basically sho=\r\nw &quot;inside the dot&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  If a person were to mark where the Byou-dou-in is =\r\non that Turnbull\n&gt;  map, it would just be a tiny dot inside the circle that=\r\n is marked\n&gt;  Uji.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Does that make sense?\n&gt;\n&gt;  By the way thanks for go=\r\ning to the effort to scan the map. It makes\n&gt;  the conversation much easier=\r\n!\n&gt;\n&gt;  --\n&gt;  Jay Kelly\n&gt;  oyakata@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  ---\n&gt;  Samurai A=\r\nrchives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;  Samurai Archives store: http://=\r\nwww.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;  ---\n&gt;  Yahoo!
