Why haven&#39;=\r\nt you folks announced your journal on the pmjs mailing  \n&gt; list?\n\nBasically=\r\n because I forgot all about that list - I was a member years\nago.  If anyon=\r\ne is a current member of the PMJS list, the staff would\ngreatly appreciate =\r\na note about the journal now accepting submissions\n- that would be great!  =\r\nWe really need to get the word out\n\n&gt; 2. How do I change my email address f=\r\nor this mailing list?\n&gt;      My current email address will expire at the en=\r\nd of the Summer.\n\nCome to the Yahoo group website:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/samuraihistory/\nAnd click &quot;Edit Membership&quot;.\n\n\n\n"
