The book was out in the early &#39;70s, before the\ncresting of the wave of ninja silliness, and it appeared to be fairly\nsolidly researched.  I shed my copy back in &#39;75, so I can&#39;t cite the\nauthor&#39;s name.\nNate, don&#39;t go thinking I&#39;m one of your &quot;resident ninja masters&quot; on account\nof this, okay?\nGereg\n\nMessage: 2\n   Date: Wed, 11 Aug 2004 15:50:08 -0700 (PDT)\n   From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: caltrops and steel bars\n\n\n--- Edward Alexander &lt;edyhiphop@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Sorry for saying a stupid question but what are\n&gt; caltrops?????And what are those small discs with\n&gt; very sharp edges?????(how are they called)\n&gt;\n&gt; Edy\n\nCaltrops are spikes placed/strewn on the ground to\nimpede/distract a pursuer, etc. The general shape of\n&quot;tetsubishi&quot; (&quot;iron diamonds&quot;) is a 4 pointed object\nwith the points such that if you throw them down,\nthere is always one point up and 3 points as a base.\nThink of jacks, from the kids game, except sharper.\n\nThe small discs with the sharp edges you refer to are\nshuriken. There&#39;s several names according to the\nshape, etc., and I&#39;m sure one of our resident ninja\nmasters will pipe up and tell us, but I&#39;m not sure\nwhat all they are. I know under the heading of\n&quot;shuriken&quot;, you&#39;ve got all sorts of shapes and sizes\nof throwing knives, including the disc and star shaped\ntypes.\n\n\n\n"
