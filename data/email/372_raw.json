I did not mean to infer that because i\npractice a martial art my knowledge was anymore valid.\n I have studied Japanese culture and history very\nintently for a long time.  I try my best to give\ninformative responses to any thing I choose to respond\nto.  I also try to be helpful.  I meant no disrespect\ntowards anyone.  The reason I wrote about the ninja is\nbecause I to agree that there are alot of unusual\nmisconceptions in the martial arts community about\nJapanese history.\n\nI have talked to many japanese about their history and\nMost admit that in Japan there is a lack of knowledge\namong the common community about their own history. \nFor example many Americans have a basic idea about\ntheir history and know certain names like thomas\nJefferson etc... but if you were to go into detail\nmost would be at a loss.  This is true also of\nJapanese they know a basic outline and some names but\ngenerally they are not that knowledgable.(I am\nspeaking of the general public not those who study and\nhave sources to study from in japan)  So living in\njapan really is not a source of knowledge.\n\nTo finish though I really meant no disrespect to\nanyone and am sorry to have casued any confusion.  I\nhave looked over my email and could have worded it\nbetter.  I am sorry to have upset anyone out there.\n\nMusashi\n\nI still recommend that book though.  It is really an\nexcellent work.  (ohhhhh and I don&#39;t think anyone will\nargue the validity and expertise of stephen turnbull)\n--- fredjnsn@... wrote:\n&gt; Regarding my last email, I don&#39;t have any issue with\n&gt; you, and your \n&gt; answer makes sense to me--- it is more of a tirade\n&gt; against the \n&gt; martial arts community in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
