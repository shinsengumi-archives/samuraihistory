The story is to be historical fiction, but the genre is WIDE OPE=\r\nN. Be it Horror, Sci-fi, Suspense, it&#39;s all up to you how you want to handl=\r\ne it. \n \n\nRequirements:\n\nThis is to be a piece of fiction writing taking pl=\r\nace within an unspecified period in Japanese history. As mentioned above, t=\r\nhe genre is wide open\n\nParameters:\n\nThe story is required to be more than 1=\r\n,000 words, with a 5,000 word targeted limit - overages are acceptable if n=\r\necessary, but please don&#39;t overdo it. It can be done in the first person, o=\r\nr the third person, and must be a complete short story, not an excerpt from=\r\n a larger story. Please list your chosen genre on your entry. Although the =\r\nparticular genre will not affect judging, all entrants will be judged on ho=\r\nw well they utilize thier chosen genre.\n\nDisqualifications: Stories with nu=\r\nmerous blatant misspellings or poor grammar may be immediately disqualified=\r\n at the judges discretion. Please spellcheck and proofread your stories.\n\nT=\r\nhere is no fee to enter the samurai fiction contest. The contest is complet=\r\nely free and open to all. The entries will be published on Samurai Archives=\r\n.com, with the winner featured. Writers will retain all rights to their sto=\r\nries. A maximum of two stories per entrant are allowed.\n\nPlease note that a=\r\nny stories that are disqualified for bad grammar or spelling will not be pu=\r\nblished on the website.\n\nSubmission Information:\n\nSubmissions are to be sen=\r\nt via email to webmaster |at| samurai-archives.com in a WORD .Doc format, .=\r\nTXT file or HTML.

You will receive a confirmation email that your submissi=\r\non has been received. A maximum of two stories per author are acceptable.\n\n=\r\nJudging and Winning the contest:\n\nSubmissions will be judged by a panel of =\r\nYahoo Group and/or Samurai Citadel community members who are not submitting=\r\n stories. The judges will not be told who the authors of each respective su=\r\nbmision are until after the judging has closed, to avoid any swaying of the=\r\n judges. The recipient of the submissions (The Samurai Archives webmaster) =\r\nwill not be a judge, and will only moderate the proceedings, to keep entrie=\r\ns anonymous. The winning story will be featured on the Samurai Archives sit=\r\ne as the winner of the 2012 Samurai Fiction contest. All stories will be pl=\r\naced in the &#39;Fan Fiction&#39; section of the Samurai Archives as well. The winn=\r\ner will be announced at the Yahoo Group and the Samurai Archives Citadel at=\r\n the end of judging in December.\n\nTimeline:\nDeadline for fiction submission=\r\n: 12/18/2012\n\nWinner to be announced after judging.\n\nTimelines are subject =\r\nto change.\n\nParticipants agree to have their stories displayed on that Samu=\r\nrai Archives Website after the contest has finished. Participants will reta=\r\nin all rights to their work, and will be credited for thier work on the sit=\r\ne.\n\nPlease email questions to this yahoo group.   Submissions are to be sen=\r\nt to webmaster at samurai-archives.com.\n\n\n    \n             \n\n  \n \n\n\n[Non-t=\r\next portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
