I\nam hoping that being a member of this list will broaden my knowledge. I have\nvisited the Samurai Archives web page very frequently in the past and have\njust stumbled onto this e-mail group. I hope to meet new people with whom I\ncan talk about Japan and it&#39;s history.\n\nCompassion go with you,\n\n    ~Sasaki Kojiro~\n        (AKA:  JJ)\n\n\n\n"
