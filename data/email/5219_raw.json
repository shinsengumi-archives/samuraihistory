Of\n&gt; course there were covert messages between Katsuyori\n&gt; and said administrator. Incidentally, it&#39;s killing me\n&gt; that I can&#39;t remember his name. For some reason Ota\n&gt; Yasusuke sticks in my head, but that&#39;s wrong--Yasusuke\n&gt; was a Hojo retainer. I&#39;m currently not able to get to\n&gt; my crutch, the Turnbull book on Nagashino, and when\n&gt; the first hit on Google that comes up is a report that\n&gt; I myself wrote (and neglected to mention the name),\n&gt; I&#39;m out of luck. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But I know, I know ... I think the reality is a lot\n&gt; &gt; more drab and \n&gt; &gt; dreary than we would like, with the occasional\n&gt; &gt; flashes of \n&gt; &gt; adventure!\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally I find reality more interesting. I&#39;d rather\n&gt; read about how someone bribed the maid of Lord\n&gt; so-and-so to gain access to a room where they\n&gt; overheard x conversation, then snuck out dressed as a\n&gt; monk and such, than to hear some silly story about\n&gt; sneaking in dressed in black pajamas, killing guards\n&gt; with magical incantations, then disappearing in a\n&gt; cloud of smoke. Bah.\n\nAlong the lines of Sengoku spies, I came across an interesting bit on \nMori Motonari and his use of spies.  In 1554, he used spies to spread \nrumors about a certain Era Fusahide, who was a skilled and powerful \nvassal of Sue Harukata, saying that he was intending to turn against \nSue, and join the Mori.  Then Mori Motonari sent a \nletter &quot;discussing&quot; an offer to join the Mori to Fusahide, which was \nintercepted by Sue Harukata.  With this letter and the rumors spread \nby Mori spies, Harukata had Fusahide excecuted, and this took a \nstrong ally of Sue Harukata out of the picture for Motonari.\n\n\n"
