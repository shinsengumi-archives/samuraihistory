Turnbull is one of the most\n&gt; ACCESSIBLE authors in English, and let&#39;s face it, most\n&gt; of us don&#39;t have the Japanese level to read about\n&gt; Sengoku Jidai history in Japanese. According to the\n&gt; Army, I speak fluent Japanese; ask me to translate\n&gt; pages from Rekishi Gunzo, it takes me a day per page. \n&gt; \n&gt; Turnbull definitely is NOT the most academic of\n&gt; authors. If you&#39;ve read more than three of his books,\n&gt; you&#39;ve read the same information at least twice. Many\n&gt; of his newer books are rehashes of the same\n&gt; information, repackaged to sell more titles. I believe\n&gt; that is much of what people are complaining about.\n&gt; Some people also feel his information is &quot;dumbed\n&gt; down&quot;. My argument is that very few people want to\n&gt; read about the effects of the change from the koku\n&gt; taxation system to the koban taxation system on some\n&gt; obscure village in Shikoku. However, most of the\n&gt; &quot;academic&quot; authors focus on inane things like this. My\n&gt; interest is military and political history, and aside\n&gt; from the &quot;classics&quot; like Sansom, Berry, and other\n&gt; mentioned, Turnbull is one of the few out there that\n&gt; is readable without a degree in Greek. \n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomley & Hopson are EXCELLENT when it comes to\n&gt; Armour and weapons development. AJ Bryant is excellent\n&gt; too. \n&gt; \n&gt; For those who complain about Turnbull&#39;s (lack of)\n&gt; scholarship: Have you read any nof his newer books?\n&gt; Either the Kakure-kirishtan or the one on the Korean\n&gt; invasions? I have not yet (I want the Korean invasion\n&gt; book) but I believe they are probably based a little\n&gt; more on original research than his older books. Again,\n&gt; rewrites to get more copies sold, I believe. \n&gt; \n&gt; That doesn&#39;t mean his writing is worthless or bad. All\n&gt; it means is TONY, YOU NEED TO PUBLISH MORE, to give us\n&gt; something else! (Tony, you know I love you!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate Ledbetter\n&gt; \n&gt; I AGREE COMPLETELY: if you read Samurai Warriors,\n&gt; Samurai Warlords, Battles of the Samurai, Samurai\n&gt; Warfare....they all read essentially the same, even\n&gt; down to the anecdotes! \n\n\nUpon further examination you are correct. The English sources are \nquite scarce and there is little competition. As I recall many of \nwhat he writes is rehashed from his other books.\n\n\n\n"
