The Imperial government in the 1870s \nabolished the hereditary samurai privileges.  They also stopped paying the annual \nstipend that every samurai received (the government did make a one time \npayment).\n\nWorst of all, from the samurai viewpoint, the Imperial government started \nrecruiting peasants into the military.  This had been the sacred province of the \nsamurai for centuries.\n\nThe samurai couldn&#39;t stand the changes that were leaving them behind, so they \nrebelled (I should add that not all samurai rebelled.  The Tokyo policemen \nwere former samurai and fought with the government forces against the rebels).\n\nThe samurai were fighting for their honor, their privileges, and for their \nway of life.\n\nBob Burke\n\n\n\nIn a message dated 12/5/03 9:56:18 PM, golfmandan@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; Captain Marshall Lilly,\n\nThe story IS loosely based on history. Katsumoto is supposed to represent \nSaigo Takamori. \nCheck out this site:\n\nhttp://www.emory.edu/HISTORY/RAVINA/lastsamurai.html\n\nYou said, &quot;the way of the samurai and all was working just fine! Why were \nthey trying to \nbecome so modern???&quot; Here&#39;s an answer:\n\nThe samurai were feudal warriors... basically Japanese fighting other \nJapanese, hidden behind \na curtain of isolationism. Well, the long-practiced isolationism ended with \nthe intrusion of  \nPerry&#39;s ships. When that curtain fell, Japan saw a bigger world with a lot of \npotential enemies. \nJapan realized it could not defend itself. Japan had to unify and modernize \nin order to defend \nitself from invasion. The samurai tactics of war were well-suited for \nfighting other sword-bearing \nfoes on the island of Japan. But if could do very little against a navy \nfleet.  \nThe Japanese were no longer concerned with how to defend themselves from \nother Japanese. \nThey had to know how to defend themselves from everybody else. Emperor Meiji \nsimply \nresponded to the impetus of potential attack from other nations.\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
