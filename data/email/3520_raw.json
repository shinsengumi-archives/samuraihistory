They were both retainers of the Takeda, \n&gt; however unless I&#39;m missing something, they were not father and son. \n&gt; It looks like Norishige joined the takeda in 1560, and was killed \n&gt; at Nagashino.\n\nUnder the mini-bio on Obata Nobusada on the Samurai Archives, it \nnoted something to the effect that &quot;Nobusada&#39;s father, Norishige, was \nkilled at Nagashino.&quot; I know that warriors had a penchant for \nchanging names when life events inspired them and thought that \nperhaps &quot;Norishige&quot; and &quot;Shigesada&#39; might be the same person. \n     However, some of my more central questions have been answered, \nso I guess I can merely note what&#39;s reported from both sources. \nI guess that any relationship between the Toramori, et. al. line and \nthe Nobusada line can likewise be reported as unknowns.\n   Domo arigato gozaimashita!\nMarlene\n\n\n\n"
