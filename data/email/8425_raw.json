He was short and shinny, and could be mistaken at \n&gt; first glance for a woman. \n&gt; Contrary to his appearance, he was clever and clear-head \n&gt; despite also being the most dreaded among all the hitokiri.\n&gt;    Master of an original sword-style called &quot;Shiranui-ryu&quot;, \n&gt; Kawakami is famous for felling the great idealist Sakuma \n&gt; Shozan in one swing, in mid-day. Kawakami is nevertheless a \n&gt; mysterious figure.\n&gt;    After the revolution he was unable to let go of the idea \n&gt; that Japan should remain closed to the world. Kawakami found \n&gt; himself in frequent conflict with the revolutionary \n&gt; government. Ultimately, he was accused of a crime he did not \n&gt; commit and executed in the 4th year of Meiji. Oh and Kenshin \n&gt; Himura, from Rurouni Kenshin is based on Kawakami, and I dont \n&gt; know who the other Hitokiri&#39;s are.\n&gt; \n\nClick this link for reading the 3 of hitokiri, Kawakami Gensai, Tanaka\nShimbe, and Izo Okada: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitokiri\n\nTotok Sudarijanto\nhttp://www.samurai.or.id\nemail: totoks@...\n\n&quot;Civilize the mind but make savage the body.&quot; - Chairman Mao\n\n\n\n\n\n"
