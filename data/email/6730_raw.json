I mean look at Hideyori...\nhe was spoiled his whole life! Hideyoshi, on the other hand, had nothing\nwhen he started out and had no choice but to use his cunning and charisma to\ngain his fame and fortune. Hideyori had it all to begin with, and doting\nparents to boot. Maybe if he had started out in more abject circumstances he\nmay have developed some true leadership abilities. He lived too much of a\nprotected life, I think.\n\nThere&#39;s also the fact One, Hideyoshi&#39;s wife, was unable to bear children.\nOkay fine, the Taiko ended up sleeping around a lot, but if One was even\nhalf as fertile as Maeda Toshiie&#39;s wife... *chuckles* In any case, one of\nthe biggest failings of inheriting power by blood is that talent doesn&#39;t\nnecessarily pass on through genes.\n\nThe Korean invasion was a horrible idea, I agree. The Japanese history\nvolumes by (forgot first name) Samson -- they&#39;re a three volume set that\npeople here have recommended before as a good summary and starting point for\nresearch -- speculate that Hideyoshi may have gone mad as he aged, maybe due\nto a degenerative disorder of the brain. Of course, I&#39;m not ruling out that\nhe was just plain drunk on his successes and figured, &quot;Hey, if it worked\nwith Japan, it&#39;s got to work with mainland China!&quot; *snorts*\n\nI guess I&#39;m just a bit biased towards Hideyoshi myself because, out of all\nthe figures of Japanese history, his story has always been the most\nawe-inspiring to me personally. In my opinion, only an exceptional\nindividual could have transcended his class and rise up to become the\nde-facto ruler of all Japan, even if that rule never continued past his\ngeneration.\n\nDark Siren Sally\nhttp://darksiren.net\n\n\n\n\n\n"
