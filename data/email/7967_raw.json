The inlay suggest south Asia as this was popular there. The inclu=\r\nsion\nof a date is also very interesting though all the kanji cannot be made=\r\n out\nfrom the photo.\n\nNot that I am an expert but what this looks like is w=\r\nhat is known as an\noccupied territory sword. Swords made in the areas occup=\r\nied by the Japanese\nbefore and during the Pacific War made by local craftsm=\r\nen with local\nmaterials after the Japanese fashion. The very same technique=\r\ns used then\nare being applied now to make the knock-offs we so often from C=\r\nhinese\nsellers. This looks like it may in fact be older (40 or 50 years) bu=\r\nt\nsomeone has clearly gussied up the scabbard and etched the blade (hence t=\r\nhe\nvery visible striations). The tsuba looks like a charcoal brick because =\r\nit\nhas been burnt, likely in an attempt to age it artificially. Also the sh=\r\narp\nangle of the kissaki is a bad sign, not likely the blade was originally=\r\n\nJapanese but if it were the value is lost because the tip would have to be=\r\n\ndrastically reshaped to save it.\n\nKey questions are; what does the tang of=\r\n the blade look like and what are\nthe kanji given in the date? Clearly this=\r\n is not treasure to sword\ncollectors but may be an interesting bit of histo=\r\nry and not just pure and\nsimple fakery.\n\nYour friend can learn much more by=\r\n following the links found here;\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihont=\r\no.htm\n\nWe recommend anyone with an interest in swords join us at\nnihonto@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com and to seek out fellow enthusiasts at their local\nsword club,=\r\n\n\nTom Helm\nncjsc.org\n\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\nmail2web - Check your email from the web at\nhttp://mail2web=\r\n.com/ .\n\n\n\n"
