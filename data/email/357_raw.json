Or was it so that if they didn&#39;t follow bushido then\n&gt; &gt; they didn&#39;t wear them?\n&gt;\n&gt;   The Hakama was a prefered garment.  The Kimono bound the legs and made\nshiko (knee walking for indoors) very difficult. The Hakama was also heavily\ndesinged for horsemanship (jobajitsu)which the Kimono was not. In Martial\narts training halls it was the norm. as recently as the 1950&#39;s, students of\nAikido founder Morihei Ueshiba were sent home from training if they did not\nhave Hakama, only zubon (pants) with them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
