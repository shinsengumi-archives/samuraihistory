Or at least, be ready to die if\n&gt;   needed be, when the time comes, in the defense of the Honour that also,\n&gt;   includes the Lord who pay the expenses of the samurai in question.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\n&gt;   S�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Message: 3\n&gt;      Date: Tue, 05 Aug 2003 18:52:31 -0700\n&gt;      From: Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt;\n&gt;   Subject: Re: What makes a samurai a samurai?\n&gt;\n&gt;   One was able to enlist as a foot soldier or as a page and &quot;move\n&gt; up through\n&gt;   the ranks&quot;,\n&gt;   Hidiyoshi is a good example of this. Later on though their were laws in\n&gt;   place to prevent\n&gt;   this from happening and the only way to be a samurai was\n&gt; through birth. One\n&gt;   interesting\n&gt;   exeption to this in the late edo period, a time when many samurai were\n&gt;   impoverished\n&gt;   ronin, wealthy merchants would pay to have their sons adopted\n&gt; into a samurai\n&gt;   family.\n&gt;\n&gt;   regards\n&gt;   Dave Jackson\n&gt;     ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;     From: gokujr1\n&gt;     To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     Sent: Sunday, August 03, 2003 10:58 PM\n&gt;     Subject: [samuraihistory] What makes a samurai a samurai?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Can anyone tell me a detailed list of all the specifications to being\n&gt;     a samurai?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yahoo!
