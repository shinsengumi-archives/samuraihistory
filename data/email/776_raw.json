You have probably missed you\nassignment date, hope you have an understanding tutor. Not sure where you\nare (time wise!!), but here is a suggestion fo an unusua approach:\n\nI have recently been writing a chapter on &quot;Women of the Samurai&quot; and, of\ncourse, Gacia Hosokawa features quite strongly. You should assume that the\nsuicide was for the &quot;Good of Others&quot;, but still not a christian act!!\nSeppuku is rather different for women on the samurai class - but the end\nresult is the same.  You can search the WEB and find several sites giving\ninformation [probably the best approach at this late stage]. This site is\npretty good for an overall veiwpoint.\n\nhttp://www.furyu.com/archives/issue2/gracia.html\n\nGood luck with the paper....\n\n                                        Rod Johnson\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KawaiiLizard@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, April 22, 2002 2:28 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Intro/Question\n\n\n&gt;          First of all, I&#39;m Liz and I just joined this group.  I&#39;m doing a\n&gt; research paper on samurai and seppuku, and I have a question for you all\nthat\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping someone can answer as soon as possible.  The paper is due\ntomorrow\n&gt; and I just realized that I don&#39;t have an example for how samurais\nsometimes\n&gt; used seppuku to save others.  If I&#39;m completely off and they never did\nthen I\n&gt; can just take it out, but it would help if I had some kind of example so I\n&gt; could leave it in.  Please, if anyone has any examples that they could\ngive\n&gt; me could you e-mail/IM me?  My e-mail is kawaiilizard@... and my\nAOL/AIM\n&gt; name is KawaiiLizard.  Thank you so much for your help in advance!  Also,\nif\n&gt; you don&#39;t know of a specific example but you know an easy way to find one\non\n&gt; a website, I&#39;ll take that, too!  Thanks a bunch!\n&gt; *~Liz~*\n&gt; www.fanfiction.net/profile.php?userid=26934\n&gt; www.angelfire.com/rpg/DarkCoveWeyr\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
