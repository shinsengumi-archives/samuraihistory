I&#39;d like to hear more.\n\n&gt;The whole sword thing, was blown out of all proportion, again I think to\n&gt;aid the cause of peace, Tokugawa peace that is. &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nConsidering how effectively the Sengoku armies became with the gun, I \nhave no doubt that this was beneficial to the powers that were. The West \nwould have had real problems until the 1620s with Japan. They missed the \nlight and fast artillery boat.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n\n"
