Hagakure claims these specifications in it&#39;s \nchapters \n&gt; &gt;    decpite\n&gt; &gt;    &gt; anyother self made interest. So do not forget that the way \nof the \n&gt; &gt;    Samurai\n&gt; &gt;    &gt; passes through Death. Even if U accept that eagerly, \nprepare \n&gt; &gt;    yourself for\n&gt; &gt;    &gt; Sepuku, if u dare for that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    AAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; I wish to be associated with the excellently expressed and erudite\n&gt; views of the proceeding screamer!\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I confess I love Japanese mythology, but please not Hagakure \nagain,\n&gt; its 19th century pseudo-warrior nonsense, written in an age, where \none\n&gt; could almost say (tongue in cheek) that swords had to be made \nengraved\n&gt; with the legend &quot;sharp end towards enemy&quot;\n\nOK, THAT was funny :D\n\n\n\n\n"
