Even though it is clased as a gendai budo and\nnot Koryu\n\nMaybe if there is a member of this forum who has\nstudied one of the Koryu which was used by samurai\nthey could shed more light on the subject.\n\nPaul\n\n--- luke berryman &lt;luke_berryman@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAs a traditional martial artist I do have some\nknowledge of this subject, the Samurai&#39;s strict code,\nBushido, is the underlining of all Japanese martial\narts, particulary Karate. Zen was a key feature for\nthe Japanese and the Samurai like the Dojo Kun in\nKarate the Samurai were bound to this doctrine.\nBushido gave them their way of life, how to act and\nhow to honourable. Early Samurai would go into battle\nshouting of all the deeds they have done and hoped an\nopponent could match their honour. I could go on\nforever but that would be boring, I strongly recommend\nthat you mention martial arts in your essay  because\nthe way of the Samurai is still living with the JKA\nJapan Karate Association the club I belong to. You\ncould go onto Google and search for Samurai, don&#39;t\ncopy it, use it for research.\n\nshobogenji &lt;paularauten@...&gt; wrote:\n\nHello,\nI�m a student from Argentina and i�m searching for\ninformation on \nthe internet of the relation, history, and every\nexisting subject on \nbuddhism and the samurai or zen and the samurai.\nif anyone could help me with this i qould appreciate\ngreatly because \ni have to do an university paper!!!\nthank you very much,\nPaula Rautenstrauch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
