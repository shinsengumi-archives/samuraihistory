However, after her mizuage, a first-class geisha \nwon&#39;t make herself available to men on a nightly basis. Although \nshe&#39;ll be a failure as a geisha if she didn&#39;t have a man to act as \nher patron and pays her expenses. He&#39;ll keep her in an elegant \nstyle, and in exchange she&#39;ll make herself sexually available to him \nexclusively.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt; Hi there.\n&gt;        Question about the geisha.  I read in a book \ncalled &quot;Geisha&quot; (author&#39;s \n&gt; name escapes me) that a geisha, at some point during her training, \nis -- to \n&gt; use the word that that text uses -- &quot;deflowered&quot;, and that the man \nthat usually \n&gt; has this honour is, for all intents and purposes, her owner or \nsomeone he \n&gt; appoints.  Why is this, when geisha are, from the description in \nthe last email, \n&gt; not primarily about sex, but sexiness?  Is it so they will know \nbetter the \n&gt; fantasy, dream or idea which they are attempting to sell?  Thanx \nfor clearing \n&gt; that up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later.\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
