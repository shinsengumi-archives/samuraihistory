I pressed the wrong key and sent an unfinished email to you. Although I am not the most knowlegeable when it comes to samurai (compared to my other fellow afficionados)  I can tell you one thing about the samurai&#39;s attitude towards their lives. They stated that their lives were like a cherry blossom. Brief but beautiful. In other words carpe diem, seize the day &#39;cause you don&#39;t know when you might die.\n \nLater,\nRod\n \nobeso9 &lt;rsesma@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nHey all,\n\n   I am new to this group and am excited about learning more about the \nsamurai way and their history. My first question is if anybody know of \nwhere to get information on what spiritual practices the samurai \nfollowed. Please send anything if you have it. Thanx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
