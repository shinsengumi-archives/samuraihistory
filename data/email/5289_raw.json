Most of\nus long timers here started out the same way--for\nwhatever reason, whether it be having watched a\nsamurai movie at age 4 or whatever, we got hooked by\nyour age and just kept reading. Keep it up. I know you\nsaid you are in Romania--any Japanese language classes\nthere, or are you learning on your own? I tried to\nteach myself before I took courses in college--I ended\nup having to unlearn a lot, so I recommend at least\ntrying to find some tapes to get the right sound. \n\nTrust me, we&#39;d give you hell about being 13 if we felt\nyou deserved it--and you may get some jokes now and\nthen, but it&#39;s only because we like you. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
