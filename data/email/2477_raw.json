A common fallacy. Rotating volley\nfire was used by Nobunaga as early as 1554:\n\n&quot;The following year, 1554, Nobunaga demonstrated that\nhe also knew how to use these new weapons when he\nattacked Imagawa Yoshimoto&#39;s Muraki Castle on the Chit\nPeninsula. Nobunaga advanced to the edge of the moat,\nand organised relays of ashigaru with arquebuses to\nkeep up a constant fire. This was a clear example of\norganised volley firing 25 years before Nagashino&quot; \nTurnbull, &quot;The Samurai Sourcebook&quot;, p 135. \n\nThe Ikko-ikki used it against him MANY times, notable\nthe second siege of Nagashima. Nobunaga&#39;s brilliance\nat Nagashino was combining the use of this tactic and\nthe terrain and obstacles to form a defense designed\nspecifically for his opponent&#39;s greatest strength, his\ncavalry. \n\n\nBy\n&gt; having shooters \n&gt; rotating behind a palisade, Nobunaga used for the\n&gt; first time firearms \n&gt; in an effective way. The rotation of shooters meant\n&gt; no gap between one \n&gt; bullet and the next, and the palisade defended them\n&gt; from the charging \n&gt; opponent. No army fighting with medieval weapons and\n&gt; tactics could have \n&gt; ever won against that, in fact in Nagashino some\n&gt; 10,000 of the Takeda&#39;s \n&gt; men died, two third of the entire army.\n&gt; Regarding firearms, the Japanese started to make\n&gt; their own in the \n&gt; 1550s, copying from the Portuguese models. One of\n&gt; the main foundries \n&gt; was in Sakai (today South Osaka), and that&#39;s why\n&gt; Nobunaga really wanted \n&gt; to take that town - which, of course, he did.\n&gt; Cepo,\n&gt; Honolulu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 16, 2003, at 8:55 AM,\n&gt; murphymurphyjohn@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; With the reliance on firearms by Kenshin and\n&gt; Takeda, I believe that\n&gt; &gt; Kawanakajima ought to be considered a Renaissance\n&gt; era battle.&#63728; \n&gt; &gt; Indeed,&#63728; I would submit\n&gt; &gt; that, although a middle point in the Age of the\n&gt; Country at War,&#63728; the\n&gt; &gt; introduction at Tanegashima in 1543 of Portuguese\n&gt; firearms ought to be \n&gt; &gt; considered the\n&gt; &gt; beginning of Modern War in Japan,&#63728; as the\nlarge\n&gt; use of cannon in Italy \n&gt; &gt; in 1494\n&gt; &gt; by the French is often considered the beginning of\n&gt; the epoch of modern \n&gt; &gt; war in\n&gt; &gt; Europe.&#63728; I know Chinese firearms were there\nfrom\n&gt; approximately 1511 \n&gt; &gt; [pace\n&gt; &gt; Turnbull],&#63728; but they were not nearly as\n&gt; sophisticated as the \n&gt; &gt; Portuguese,&#63728; and the\n&gt; &gt; large contracts vetted for Oda Nobunaga after\n&gt; their introduction seems \n&gt; &gt; to bear\n&gt; &gt; out my point.&#63728; I hope Tony Bryant has some\n&gt; thoughts he can share here?&#63728;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,&#63728; Profmurf\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
