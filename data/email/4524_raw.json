Always when certain portions of\n&gt; his ideal map are in the \n&gt; hands of germans, other portions was independent.\n&gt; Some would say that he did \n&gt; attempted to do with the entire world what the\n&gt; bastard of Nobunaga attempted \n&gt; with Japan. \n\nComment: I do not agree. Hitler identified the cause\nof the defeat of the previous German Empire as the\nracial impurity, which he generalized into a larger\nsphere of  historical context. \nIn essence, in his book, &#39;Mein Kampf&#39;, he claimed that\nin order for an empire to last, it was necessary to\neliminate the racial impurity, the mass bulk of which\nhe also associated with Jews.\n\nAs a practical realization of his &#39;theoretical&#39;\nreasoning, he devised a systematic mass execution,\nwhich his followers &#39;efficiently&#39; implemented.\n\nHis ideal map of German nation, which I also believe\nwas on Hitler&#39;s mind, therefore was not the cause of\nhis &#39;mass&#39; execuation in a strict sense whereas as for\nNobunaga, the reunification itself was the primary\ncause of the execution.  The expansive warfare\nmotivated by his ideal territory can be quoted at most\nas the secondary cause of the mass exectution. \n\n\n&gt; Hitler killed jews not due to racist motivations\n&gt; only, but also religious, \n\nQuestion 1: I do not understand what you meant by\n&#39;religious&#39;.\n\n\n \n&gt; And... Although this is offtopic, Cesar, you may\n&gt; criticise my History View \n&gt; Points as much as ye want, but was not any\n&gt; non-christian religion who always \n&gt; was conspiring to change history logs, doing\n&gt; adulteration and falsification \n&gt; on the documents, such as what whas done with\n&gt; certain doccuments by Taccitus \n&gt; and others to &quot;prove&quot; that Jesus existed. As well,\n&gt; to accuse several others \n&gt; religions (including judaism) of &quot;human sacrifice&quot;\n&gt; and all the same rant as \n&gt; aways. \n&gt; \n&gt; The japanese remember very well their history.\n&gt; Thanks to Tokugawa again. \n\nQuestion 2: Do you mean that the Japanese remember\nwell that Nobunaga = Hitler? Is this how many Japanese\nhistorians interpret the historical postion of\nNobunaga and teach young Japanese students in their\nhistory classes?\n\n\n&gt; And although I am not a communist... \n&gt; &quot;the people who don�t know their true history\n&gt; deeply, are fated to repeat it \n&gt; in circles&quot; \n&gt; Mao Tse Tung \n\nQuestion 3: How is this quotation of Mao related to\nyour argument? \n\n\n&gt; &quot;Don�t go around spreading \n&gt; that I am telling lies. \n&gt; Stand up and PROVE I am wrong. \n&gt; The History of the Church \n&gt; is full of conspirations of ambition and power&quot; \n&gt; Goetche \n\nQuestion 4: How does this quotation PROVE that you did\nnot lie when you said that the Japanese parents quote\nNobunaga to scare their children?\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                         Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
