Richard Kirkham B.Sc&quot; &lt;tutor2000@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Glad you said &quot;free&quot; ebook. Ebooks are my chosen way of publishing for several reasons which I won&#39;t bother with, but a good ebook is no different than a good hard copy book\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat&#39;s true, it&#39;s how it is edited and reviewed that makes the \ndifference, not the electrons or paper that make up the substance. One \nadvantage of books from reputable academic publishers is they usually \ntry to keep the real garbage from getting out since it can damage their \nname. They use real reviewers that check the book out before its \npublished as well as having a professional editor take a crack at it. \nWith self published books, its a crap shoot if you get anything decent \nor not. I have some great books on various craft subjects that are self \npublished but I&#39;ve also seen some incredible vanity press dribble as \nwell. Also even the best authors benefit from at least a little editing.\n\nIf you have access to a college library, many of them now allow you to \nread academic journals online, even if its not one that they subscribe \nto. In my case the City of San Jose and Cal State San Jose library are a \ncombined library so I can access the databases at the library. I&#39;m not a \nstudent, otherwise I could access them from home!\n\nIn California and parts of Nevada, LINK+ gets you almost overnight \naccess to many library&#39;s collections.\n\nHaving checked out other states library sites, many other states have \nsimilar setups. If your serious, it makes a nice day trip to hit your \nsomewhat local large library!\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"
