Kendoka tend to be rather open to using either term.\n  A kodachi, from what I have learned, is a blade that is shorter than a \ndaito and longer than a wakizashi (shoto).  The term I have heard used for a \nwakizashi-sized bokuto is usually shoto bokuto.  Most of the Iaidoka that I \nknow would think of the medium-long blade if you mentioned kodachi.\n  I hope that helped in some way.  Knowing my luck I have merely confused \nissues.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page ï¿½ FREE \ndownload! http://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n"
