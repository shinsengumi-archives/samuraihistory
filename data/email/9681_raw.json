If a samurai was to lose a battle, and return alive, would he commit \nsuicide?\nWhy should he? That only happens in movies.\n\n2. Were there any female samurai?\nYeah and they were really hot looking but they usually had a bad case of \nPMS. They had names like Hot Susuki or Kamon Iwannalaya\n\n3. What would happen if a samurai&#39;s katana was stolen?\nHe would head over to the nearest pawnshop to pick up a replacement or just \ngo ahead and carve a big wooden club and add some nails to it. Otherwise, he \nwould just use his bare hands. Come on, you&#39;ve never seen a Japanese martial \narts film?\n\n4. If a samurai used seppuku to regain his honor, what would happen to his \nfamily?\nSeppuku was just a way to escape facing failure like the grade you&#39;re going \nto get because you can&#39;t do your own research.\n\n\n"
