Director Hideo Gosha&#39;s first \nfeature film is not only one of the most-assured directorial debuts \never, it is also something of a holy-grail for samurai movie \naficionados, as it&#39;s been notoriously hard-to-see outside of Japan \nsince its initial release - until now. Janus Films just made a \nglorious new 35 mm. print of this treasure, in time for our series!  \nWandering samurai Tetsuro Tanba is swayed into helping those who \ncan&#39;t fend for themselves, in this case starving farmers who have \nkidnapped a local lord&#39;s daughter in protest over unfair taxes. In \nthe process, much blood is shed, and two other swords-for-hire \n(Mikijiro Hira, Isamu Nagato) become reluctant draftees into Tanba&#39;s \nband of rebels. Gosha&#39;s use of the B&W Cinemascope frame is \nastonishing, with a down-to-earth, hardboiled ambience rarely seen \nin early 1960s samurai pictures. Add to that Toshiaki Tsushima&#39;s \natmospheric score and you have a certifiable classic.\n\nNext on the same bill is GOYOKIN (aka OFFICIAL GOLD aka STEEL EDGE \nOF REVENGE), (1969, Toho, 121 min.). Director Hideo Gosha&#39;s samurai \nmasterpiece is an unrelenting vision of snow and fire, ravens \nscreeching and swords flashing in the darkness. Tatsuya Nakadai \nstars as a conscience-stricken samurai tortured by his involvement \nin a past massacre and determined to prevent another. Gosha was \nforced to reshoot half the film when original co-star Toshiro Mifune \nwalked out (apparently because of the fierce cold!) - and the cold \nin GOYOKIN is, in truth, all-consuming, freezing hands to swords. A \nbold, beautifully-shot film.  With Tetsuro Tanba, Ruriko Asaoka.\n\n\nDate: Friday, September 09, 2005 \n\nTime: 7:30 PM - 10:00 PM\n\nEgyptian Theatre\n6712 Hollywood Boulevard \nLos Angeles, CA \n\n\nPosted by: Asia Institute\n\n\n\n\n"
