Anyway, Nate\n&gt; et al, when I \n&gt; mentioned Uesugi it was with the three well\n&gt; publicized koshirae which \n&gt; have good provenance to Kenshin. I said THESE are\n&gt; called \n&gt; Uesugi-koshirae because it is a CATAGORY of sword, I\n&gt; think you&#39;ll find \n&gt; that when someone as famous as Kenshin adopts this\n&gt; style many others \n&gt; did as well. This is not that rare a thing to see. I\n&gt; refer you all to \n&gt; Uchi-gatana Koshirae, a catalog from a Tokyo\n&gt; National Museum exhibition \n&gt; drawn from their extensive holdings. There you will\n&gt; find a number of \n&gt; examples contemporary to the age of War. And as\n&gt; someone much more \n&gt; knowledgeable than I said on the same subject,\n&gt; &quot;There was no other \n&gt; reason to own a sword in the Sengoku period but for\n&gt; fighting.&quot;\n\nOkay, fair enough. I&#39;m a babe in the woods when it\ncomes to sword knowledge. Still, it wasn&#39;t common. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
