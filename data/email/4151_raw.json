Also, I =\r\ndon&#39;t really have an argument to follow. I was \njust saying Nobunaga was ne=\r\nver Shogun, so there&#39;s no &quot;disagreeing&quot; \nor &quot;agreeing&quot; about it.\nI feel tha=\r\nt Nobunaga would not have become Shogun for similiar \nreasons Hideyoshi cou=\r\nld never have been Shogun. We all tend to \nhear &quot;Shogun&quot; and think, aside f=\r\nrom the occasional Emperor, that was \nthe s**t in Medieval Japan. There wer=\r\ne plenty of other ways and \ntitles Nobunaga could have had to become the mo=\r\nst powerful man in \nJapan... but I don&#39;t think he really cared for them. As=\r\n long as he \nwas in charge he could be called whatever they wanted to call =\r\nhim. \nI&#39;m pretty sure I recall that the court didn&#39;t so much \ngrant &quot;Shogun=\r\nates&quot; as it was requested of the court, and I doubt \nNobunaga would have bo=\r\nthered. I&#39;m not saying he couldn&#39;t have become \nthe leader of Japan, just n=\r\not the leader using the particular \ntitle &quot;Shogun&quot;.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Michael Lorimer \n&lt;mijalo_jp@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I guess we will=\r\n never know if Oda Nobunaga would &quot;probably never&quot; \nhave been Shogun. He in=\r\nstalled Ashikaga Yoshiaki, brother of the \nmurdered Shogun Ashikaga Yoshite=\r\nru, in 1568, only to depose him in \nthe early 1570s. Therefore between then=\r\n and the victory of Tokugawa \nIeyasu there were no Shogun. He was the leadi=\r\nng commander in the \ncountry, and controller of the Kinai, who year after y=\r\near was \npresented with titles from the court, finally reaching daijo daiji=\r\nn \nin 1578. Yes he never became Shogun, but equally should Ieyasu have \nbec=\r\nome Shogun? (to follow your line of argument). Both were \nextremely ambitio=\r\nus, often treacherous, characters from equally \nobscure regional families, =\r\nand both raised great opposition in and \naround the Court during their asce=\r\nndancies. Why, therefore would \nNobunaga &quot;probably never&quot; have been Shogun,=\r\n when Ieyasu established \na disciplined, effective Bakufu?\n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Kyle Segall &lt;klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; While its a minor quibble, you sh=\r\nould know there&#39;s no &quot;agreeing&quot; \n&gt; or &quot;disagreeing&quot; about Nobunaga being a =\r\nShogun. He wasn&#39;t. Only \nthe \n&gt; Tokugawa and the Ashikaga families had Shog=\r\nuns during the Sengoku \n&gt; Jidai, and, even had Nobunaga indeed conquered al=\r\nl of Japan, he \n&gt; probably never would have been one either (probably a kem=\r\npaku like \n&gt; Hideyoshi).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Me=\r\n=F0al Mikit St=F3r-ljon \n&gt; Oddhinsson &lt;medhal8@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I tend to a=\r\ngree that Nobunaga was not a Shogun.
