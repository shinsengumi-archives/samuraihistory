While \nI have found much information on Japanese castles themselves in &quot;The Age of \nthe Country at War,&quot;  there seems to be little information on siege engines \nlike catapults.  Also,  I have difficulty in finding information on Japanese \ncannon,  although I know Ishida Mitsunari is known to have deployed 5 cannon at \nSekigahara (1600).  If anybody can help me  (I prefer contact and sources in \nEnglish),  I would really appreciate it.  If I can help others I shall try,  \nbecause I feel that before we fall like cherry blossoms,  we should leave a trail \nbehind for those who follow.  Cheers!  Professor John F. Murphy Jr.,  The \nJapan Foundation\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
