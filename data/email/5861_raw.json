As a formalised code it makes a very \nlate appearance - I would view it as a code based on how previous generations had \nlived, rather than a particular code on which the samurai modelled his life.\n\nI might go so far as to say that the &#39;appearance&#39; of the code - as someone writing \n&#39;The Way of the Warrior&#39; or whatever, signifies that way was already slipping into \nhistory...\n\nZen, similarly, although around since the 12th century, had a relatively unimportant \ninfluence on the development of the samurai, and almost none on the development of \nswordsmanship, compared to Shingon, Shinto and Taoism. \n\nZen as a &#39;major player&#39; or major influence begins in the Edo period, with traces visible \nin the end of the Sengoku. Whilst one might cite Musashi, or better Yagyu Munenori \nand Kamiizuni Nobutsuna, these men knew of Zen as a training regime, but their \nmartial philosophy was founded on Shingon, Shinto and Tao.\n\nNotably Takuan Soho, the Zen master, friend and &#39;spiritual director&#39; of some notable \nswordsmen, employed elements of mikkyo - esoteric Buddhism - in his teachings.\n\nThe appeal of Zen to the warrior is primarily because of its near silence on issues of \nmorality and its focus on the &#39;act&#39; and the &#39;now&#39; etc. It suited a warrior ethic, especially \none that for long periods of history would not bear examination in light of the so-called \n&#39;code&#39; it professed to live by.\n\nIn short, if bushido was the code, in any real sense, how come the history is so full of \ndeceits, deceptions and betrayals?\n\nThomas\n\n-- \n\nWhatever you Wanadoo:\nhttp://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/\n\nThis email has been checked for most known viruses - find out more at: http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm\n\n"
