I am n=\r\not an expert on the subject of  bushido, but it is my observation that the =\r\nbushi class followed a code  of ethics/behaviors from the point in which th=\r\ney established themselves  as a definable group in the late 12th century. \n=\r\n  \n  According to Minoru Kiyota from the University of Wisconsin, there wer=\r\ne  4 types of codes based on the time period (Heian, Kamakura, Sengoku,  To=\r\nkugawa). The Heian code was based on loyalty and benevolence. The  code of =\r\nthe Kamakura period was called &#39;bando musha no narai&#39; and  similar to the p=\r\nrevious code. The Sengoku code is also based on  loyalty, but in the contex=\r\nt of extreme violence. Of course, the  Tokugawa period is when we see the B=\r\nushido that most people would  recognize.\n  \n  Bushido Shoshinshu was writt=\r\nen  sometime between 1639 and 1730--I do not have a specific date. It is  j=\r\nust my opinion, but I feel that it was just an off-shoot of the  samurai ru=\r\nles created by Ieyasu and written by Suden. If that is the  case, you could=\r\n argue that the date you are looking for is August 30,  1615.\n  \n  After al=\r\nl that, I really dont have a specific date for Bushido... I  guess it depen=\r\nds on what you want to recongnize as the true Way.  Regional codes existed =\r\nas well, so Im sure someone has more specific  info than I do. It is a good=\r\n topic though.\n  \n  Jonathan Ellgen\n  \n  Ijin Mibu &lt;ijinmibu@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:          When did samurai start fallowing bushido? Was it in the Edo-er=\r\na or \n  before that? Im looking for dates.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n          \n=\r\n\n    ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Arch=\r\nives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---  \n\n             =\r\n         \n\n          SPONSORED LINKS    \n                                  =\r\n                      Samurai                                          Japa=\r\nn                                          Japan airline                   =\r\n                                                          \n        \n-------=\r\n--------------------------\n    YAHOO!
