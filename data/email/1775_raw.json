Some \nsay the revenge of samurai showed thier royalty to thier samurai \nspirits, admiring it. Others say there was no need or reason to do so \nbut the social custom forced samurai, critisizing it. \nWhat is your opinion about the revenge of samurai? How do you feel \nabout it? \n   Thank you...\n\n\n\n\n"
