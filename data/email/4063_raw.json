It wasn&#39;t for keeping the samurai down, but for keeping them &quot;up.&quot; \n&gt;\nThe bosses wanted them to remain samurai, that&#39;s down from that \nperspective. No more Hideyoshi&#39;s or the like!\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;midorinotoradesu&quot; &lt;bkirkham@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Relating back to the samurai, there is always a need for military \n&gt;power.  In the samurai days it may have been for civil obedience \n&gt;outside the existance of a war.  \n&gt;\nWithout the threat of a Bafuku army Japan fell apart from internal \ntensions, thus beginning the Meiji period and a move to be a real nation.\n\n&gt;The U.S. military is very different from the samurai.  Japan was \n&gt;isolated from most of the world.  By their own choice and because of \n&gt;geography.  The U.S. military deals with global issues.  A military \n&gt;dealing only with its own country&#39;s problems has different demands. \n&gt;In which case your second assertion may bear some truth.  Only some \n&gt;truth becuase I believe the samurai were in a postion like many \n&gt;dictatorships in the world.  They possessed the frightening might or \n&gt;the military and didn&#39;t require justifying themselves to the \n&gt;population they ruled.  \n&gt;\nYes, the US military serves us and not the other way around, we have our \nfounding fathers to thank, as well as the fine men and women who have \nserved since then for this almost unique distinction, we are one of the \nfew democracies that hasn&#39;t had a military coup.\n\n&gt;If the peasants didn&#39;t like it; what would they do about it?  \n&gt;\nDie messily along with their families.\n\n&gt;They odd situation with Japan is that they had 2 \n&gt;positions of power.  \n&gt;\nOnly one of the two at any given time.\n\n&gt;Shogun and Emperor.  Periods existed when the \n&gt;Emperor possessed all the power and there were times when the Emperor \n&gt;was only a puppet.  The peasants were&#39;nt the only ones who didn&#39;t \n&gt;like the system.  The Emperor didn&#39;t and he did something about it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHmm... I&#39;m not sure if they were ever able to do anything about it or if \nthey were just shoved up by their would-be followers.\n\n&gt;No matter how the samurai class may have been &quot;justified&quot; the Emperor \n&gt;decided that the weren&#39;t needed and that a new military needed to be \n&gt;formed to progress the nation into modern times.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m not up enough on the Meiji restoration to be sure of this. I know he \nwas really enamoured with the west for a while, even the Empress wore \nwestern fahsions for a while.\n\n&gt;Important to note that he still thought a military was important just \n&gt;not the one they had.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFor sure, they wanted to be a nation like America or England, which \nmeans splendid little colonial wars and looting your neighbors.\n\nJim\n\n\n"
