What Brand had to say\n&gt; wasn&#39;t at all stupid and it is very possible that he&#39;s\n&gt; correct.\n\nDid I say it was stupid? I said it&#39;s not a name.\n\n&quot;Kami&quot; means &quot;god&quot; or &quot;deity&quot; specifically, not &quot;the spirit of something.&quot;\nSo first of all, it&#39;s impossible for &quot;Torakami&quot; to means &quot;spirit of the\ntiger.&quot; If anything, it would be &quot;tiger god.&quot;\n\n&gt; As far as my name goes, there is nothing odd\n&gt; about it and it is very much a Japanese name that was\n&gt; given to me by my great-grandmother who happened to be\n&gt; Japanese, which goes to show that you&#39;re not as much\n&gt; an authority as you seem to give yourself credit for\n&gt; being.\n\nThen perhaps you will recall that my exact words were &quot;Without the kanji, it\nwould be impossible. Frankly &quot;Taneiko&quot; doesn&#39;t sound typically Japanese to\nme. Taneko would, but Taneiko... something seems odd.&quot;\n\nWell, here goes.\n\nWomen&#39;s names using &quot;-ko&quot; endings are typically one kanji (haru, yuki, hana)\nplus the finishing &quot;-ko.&quot; There is *no* kanji that has &quot;tamei&quot; as a reading.\nTo get to &quot;tanei&quot; you need two kanji (or more) to produce tane+i, or ta+nei,\nor ta+ne+i (the last one, meaning a four kanji name, is statistically\nimprobable. Therefore we&#39;re stuck with &quot;tane+i&quot; or &quot;ta+nei.&quot; Since there few\nkanji with the reading &quot;nei&quot;, but not often seen in names, we&#39;re\nfunctionally limited, then to &quot;tane+i&quot;, which produces the question, which\nkanji combination would allow a (positive meaning) name combining the\nsyllables tane+i+ko?\n\nThere are a few names that are listed in my books with the reading &quot;Taneko&quot;\n(no &quot;i&quot;) -- one &quot;tane&quot; meaning &quot;seed/kernel&quot; and the other meaning\n&quot;egg/seed&quot; or &quot;sincerity.&quot; There is a third &quot;tane&quot; which pops up in names --\n&quot;issue/offspring&quot; -- but it&#39;s very unusual these days.\n\nSo what we have is a very improbably Tane*i*ko, but a very probable Tane[no\n*i*]ko.\n\nNow, it&#39;s possible that whoever Romanized the name added the &quot;i&quot; to make\nsure people would pronounce it properly (like the errant &quot;y&quot; that sometimes\npops up in Ma[y]eda and U[y]eda. These variant readings are common, however.\nTaneiko is not. Therefore, again, we&#39;re back to &quot;either the name is Taneko\nand someone mis-Romanized it&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not a typical Japanese name.&quot;\n\nDo you find a flaw with the argument or with the [original] conclusion?\n\nFor the record, Japanese onomastics, especially historical onomastics, is a\nfield I study, and I study it seriously.\n\nBefore you get all huffy, perhaps you should consider that some people *do*\nknow more than you do.\n\n\n\nTony\n\n\n"
