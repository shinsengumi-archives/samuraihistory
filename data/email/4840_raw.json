The other was headed by\n&gt; Honda Masanobu, \n&gt; who wasn&#39;t known as a great warrior (due to an\n&gt; illness he suffered \n&gt; during his youth, I vaguely recall reading that this\n&gt; might have been \n&gt; polio, but I might be confusing that with Date\n&gt; Masamune), but \n&gt; Masanobu acted in a diplomatic and administrative\n&gt; role for the \n&gt; Tokugawa. He was also known as a political schemer,\n&gt; but was very \n&gt; close to Ieyasu, and later Hidetada. Another fairly\n&gt; vague \n&gt; recollection I have is that the founder of Honda\n&gt; Motor Corp. was \n&gt; descended from this branch of the family.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
