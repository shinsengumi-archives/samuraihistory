I am waiting for your comments.\n\nWarlord &lt;warlord@...&gt; wrote:\n\nHello Antonius,\n\nI presume your &quot;early period of Japan&quot; is the late 16th century.  I have you\nput &quot;admiral yi&quot; into a google search string (5,050 hits).  Also, perhaps\n&quot;turtle ships&quot; ( 1,230 hits).  These cover the period of Toyotomi\nHideyoshi&#39;s ill-fated invasion of Korea in 1592.  Try combinations of these.\nFor example &#39;hideyoshi korea invasion&#39; (without quotes) brought forth 5,450\nhits.  I&#39;m sure all of this is fertile field for your list.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: antonius pujo &lt;antoniuspujo@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, January 04, 2005 11:14 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] History of Japanese Occupation\n\n\nDear All,\n\nI am a graduate school student in Japan. I am writing about Bushido and The\nSpirit of War.\nI made a list the history of Japanese Occupation to Asia, from early period\nof Japan, but I have no enough confidence to present it to my profesor.\nIf you have some qualified information about it, would you like to share it\nwith me. Please also write the books for references.\n\nRegards,\nAntonius R.
