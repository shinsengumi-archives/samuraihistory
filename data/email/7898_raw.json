Does that\nmean that in terms of historical accuracy, that\nfiction is equal to history? This seems to be the\npoint you are DYING to argue, and I gladly cede you\nthe floor. \n\n\n&gt; To use an example: is the film SEPPUKU\n&gt; &quot;entertainment?&quot;\n\nIn the sense that it&#39;s a vehicle to tell a story that\naffects the emotions somehow, and is not meant to be a\nvehicle to carry across simple facts, yes, that&#39;s\nentertainment. \n\n Who has seen this\n&gt; film and could say that they were &quot;entertained&quot; by\n&gt; it? \n\nNot everyone is entertained solely by song and dance,\nNina. You know that. \n\nIt is tenuous in the\n&gt; extreme to say that its purpose was to depict\n&gt; absolute fact i.e. that a real\n&gt; person named Tsugumo Hanshiro existed in history and\n&gt; he avenged the death of\n&gt; this son-in-law against the Ii clan. But to say that\n&gt; the film (and the novel\n&gt; on which it is based) was made only to entertain,\n&gt; not in any way to discuss\n&gt; history, would be equally tenuous to state. \n\n&quot;Discuss history&quot; is quite separate from &quot;outline\nhistorical facts&quot;. Certainly you could use the movie\nto discuss the situation of the times that the movie\ndepicts. Does it represent historical fact? No. Can it\ngive you insight into historical facts? Quite\npossibly. It&#39;s still not historical record, NOR IS IT\nINTENDED TO BE. You keep saying that even books\nintended to be history need to be checked and verified\nand (with as much as you say it) believed only\nskeptically--HOW MUCH MORE A WORK OF FICTION?\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nStart your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page! \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n"
