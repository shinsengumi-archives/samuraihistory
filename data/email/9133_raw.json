I would=\r\n say that there is more a\n&gt; provenience rather then a brand-name, and\n&gt; I&#39;v=\r\ne been puzzled by this for years and still are. My former  \n&gt; Senpai, now\n&gt;=\r\n passed away, was making a study assuming that the\n&gt; Portugueses made those=\r\n arquebuses in Goa or possibly Macau. Cannons  \n&gt; at that\n&gt; time had a limi=\r\ned lifespan. Each 100 rounds (signed on the barrel, ten\n&gt; rounds one nick) =\r\nthe cannon should have been re-melted and casted  \n&gt; (we&#39;re\n&gt; talking about=\r\n bronze, not steel). Transporting such valuable items  \n&gt; from\n&gt; Indonesia =\r\nto Portugal was expensive and dangerous so the portugueses\n&gt; settled foundr=\r\nies in both the above mentioned colonies. Such foundries\n&gt; provided even me=\r\ntal items for the chinese and indian market.\n&gt; Now, is it belivable that th=\r\ne portugueses established arquebuses  \n&gt; factories\n&gt; there too ? Fabrizio w=\r\nas collecting evidences, but he passed away  \n&gt; before to\n&gt; finish the work=\r\n and his widow lost the notes and bibliography. I&#39;ve  \n&gt; never\n&gt; had neithe=\r\nr the time nor the knowledge to re-create the files.  \n&gt; Might be, if\n&gt; he =\r\nwas right, that arquebuses equipping the men that shipwrecked on\n&gt; Tanegash=\r\nima were made in Goa or Macau, possibly in factories  \n&gt; managed by\n&gt; portu=\r\nguese commercial company,\n&gt; but I can&#39;t really consider this other then a p=\r\nossibility NOT  \n&gt; supported by\n&gt; evidences.\n&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Messaggio =\r\noriginale-----\n&gt; Da: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com  \n&gt; [mailto:samuraihist=\r\nory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; Per conto di brentbovee2\n&gt; Inviato: domenica 22 otto=\r\nbre 2006 2.19\n&gt; A: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Oggetto: [samuraihistor=\r\ny] maker???\n&gt;\n&gt; hello all... this is my first time here and i already have =\r\na question.\n&gt; The style of gun that samurai first aquired was ,i think a  \n=\r\n&gt; matchlock but did\n&gt; it have a brand name- maker?
