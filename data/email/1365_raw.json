I would hazard a guess that the first\npart is who made it, the swordsmith. Bishu I&#39;m not\nfamiliar with, but the Osafune Sukesada sounds like a\nname to me, so it would be a sword possibly made by a\n&#39;Bishu&#39; Osafune Sukesada. \n\nJust curious, but if you&#39;re not sure what it means,\nthen how did you read the inscription? Or did you have\nit transliterated?\n\nNate\n\n--- &quot;Kitsuno &lt;cewest@...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;cewest@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Not sure about the begining off the top of my head,\n&gt; but as for the \n&gt; date I guess Daiei 2 2 gatsu could either be the\n&gt; second month of 1522 \n&gt; or maybe it reads Kaiei 2, which is 1849 and\n&gt; probably more likely.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dginn1959\n&gt; &lt;migi4@c...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;migi4@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I own a Japanese sword and believe it is an old\n&gt; police sword.
