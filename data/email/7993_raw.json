And we know practically nothing about Bushi-do. While we do\nknow that n=\r\not all samurai followed it, we don&#39;t really know exactly\nwhat it was. That&#39;=\r\ns just one thing.\n\nHi, I&#39;m new here myself, but I have an idea of how to an=\r\nswer you.\n\nThere is a wealth of technical and historical information about =\r\nthe\nconstruction and evolution of the Japanese sword. This subject alone\nco=\r\nuld fill years of your time.\nI&#39;d suggest visiting: http://home.earthlink.ne=\r\nt/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\nand  reading for a while so that you an narrow down =\r\nthe specifics of\nyour question.\n\nWith regard to the various techniques of a=\r\nrmed and unarmed combat,\nagain there is a vast plethora of historical and m=\r\nodern information\nabout the subject. I&#39;ve trained in Martial Arts for 21 ye=\r\nars and I&#39;m\nstill learning.\nWhat specific arena of combat are you intereste=\r\nd in and what era?\nBattlefields, duels, martial arts, koryu or gendai ryu e=\r\ntc...\n\nAs for Bushido, this is a Code of Conduct which was never really\nado=\r\npted by the Samurai, it occupies much the same place in myth as the\nHagakur=\r\ne.\nMost Samurai were followed Shinto or Buddhism, the early Samurai\nfollowe=\r\nd a fairly esoteric form of buddhism known a Mikyo Buddhism,\nwhich is akin =\r\nin a few respects to Bushido.\n\nI am aware that there are a lot of people in=\r\n here with far greater\nknowledge of Japanese history and culture than I pos=\r\nsess, so please\ncorrect any of the above if I am incorrect.\n\nIf you&#39;re look=\r\ning for a fairly easy insight into Japanese culture as\nis popularly perciev=\r\ned, then look for films by the director Akira\nKurosawa, especially, Ran, Ka=\r\ngemusha, Yojimbo, Sanjuro and of course\nSeven Samurai.\n\nBest wishes..\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"
