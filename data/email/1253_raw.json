So for all intent and purposes the\n&gt; sword was only drawn for \n&gt; fighting, practice or testing the blade.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it were drawn for show then the finger would be\n&gt; lightly drawn across the \n&gt; blade to draw blood before being sheathed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Schep13\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: j cool &lt;jcool58801@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Samurai sword\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 22 Nov 2002 23:57:35 -0800 (PST)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;A friend and I got into a discusion about when a\n&gt; &gt;samurai would draw his sword.  We were wondering if\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;samurai would show his sword to any one for looks\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt;would they only draw it to fight or practice??\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thank you for your time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Little Samurai\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
