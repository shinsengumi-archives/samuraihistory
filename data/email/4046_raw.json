Standing at right is Aldo Cardini. I can scan and send the\npicture with the caption writed by him.\nHis family sheltered and fed my father during WWII, because my\ngreatfather completely relied on them, till to the point to leave his\nfamily in their hands to avoid war dangers. The Cardini&#39;s family was in\na safe place but they were secretly communist. Notwithstanding this they\nhelped my greatfather that was sent to fight &#39;&#39;their hero Stalin&#39;&#39; in\nRussia.\nThey understood the &#39;&#39;duty&#39;&#39; and had friendship above any other\nconsideration. \nAldo Cardini fought nazis and fascists ferociously and bravely as a\npartisan, with faith in a future communist Italy. Captured, he was sent\nto Mathausen. His extremely strong body survived till to the GI&#39;s\narrival, May 5th 1945. \nHis mother wasn&#39;t able to recognize him at his return.\nMany years after, when my father was in his last moments for a cancer,\nAldo paid a visit to him. Watching at my father, said to me &#39;&#39;he seems\nas me at my return&#39;&#39;. And then, crying, &#39;&#39;Stalin have made it too...&#39;&#39;. \nAfter 40 years he had accepted the fact both parts had lagers. \nHe&#39;s still alive and healthy, he still wake-up from nightmares. \n\nStop you to say &#39;&#39;idiot&#39;&#39; to each other. \nYou are both. And me too.\nNever put too deep faith in something related to men.\n\n\n\n"
