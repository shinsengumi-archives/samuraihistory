It just came to my mind because in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (the DVD\nmenu of the second disc) it says that &quot;for 1100 years the samurai have\nlived by seven principles...&quot; or whatever, and I seem to remember that\nthe &quot;code&quot; was established after the samurai stopped serving a true\nmilitary purpose with the peace of the Tokugawa era.\n\nMiburo Saitou\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Ruby Harper &lt;madmadotakuchick@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, aren&#39;t you just so smart, Dave. ^_^ There\n&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t very specific laws on Samurai, but there was\n&gt; &gt; only on consistency in their codes and rules. The\n&gt; &gt; Code of Bushido, which was a set of ten ideals for\n&gt; &gt; samurai set down for all with a sword to follow. I\n&gt; &gt; think they were given to someone by one of the Kami\n&gt; &gt; or gods/goddesses, but I can&#39;t quite remember the\n&gt; &gt; specifics. Go ahead and e-mail me if you need any\n&gt; &gt; more specifics on the subject. I spent a past life\n&gt; &gt; during some of feudal japan, and was alive during\n&gt; &gt; Sekigahara.\n&gt; \n&gt; Put the peyote down, and check yourself into rehab,\n&gt; please. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
