I think i&#39;d like the &quot;long&quot; answer ;)  - - I&#39;ve noticed, for \nexample, at one point Mori Motonari had / was given the title &quot;Mutsu \nno Kami&quot; - I assume that Motonari had never been to Mutsu considering \nit is on the other side of the country.  Also, Shimazu Takahisa seems \nto have held this title around the same time - give or take some \ndecades - not to mention the fact that Hojo Ujiteru and Date Masamune \napparently held this title at roughly the same time.  I can see Date \nMasamune holding this title considering he LIVED there, but these \nother guys...  (another example would be &#39;suruga no kami&#39; - held by: \nUsami Sadayuki, Mogami Iechika, Kikkawa Motoharu, Itagaki Nobutaka, \nImagawa Yoshimoto,Daidoji Masashige, and Asahina Nobuoki(and probably \nothers) - in this case Yoshimoto and Asahina Nobuoki, and possibly \nItagaki Nobutaka had ties to Suruga).    \n\nWas there a medeival &quot;Bureau for the giving of governorships&quot; that \nkept track of all these titles, (and were the titles &#39;bestowed&#39; at \nall) or were they random honorary titles given by someone of higher \nauthority? - sort of a &#39;psuedo-rank&#39; to let them feel important? (or \nto let the emperor feel important by having the power to give out \ntitles?)\n\nCEWest\n\n\n"
