I know that isn&#39;t a very satisfying answer, but=\r\n there are plenty of examples where how someone looks doesn&#39;t correlate wit=\r\nh their ancestry. \n\nAlso, remember that the people of central asia have a l=\r\not of the &quot;east asian look&quot; in them.  All I mean by that is a lot of the po=\r\npulations just north of Iran have ethnic groups that &quot;look&quot; chinese or kore=\r\nan or japanese.  And depending on where she is from in Iran, there are diff=\r\nerent ethnic groups.\n\nIf you don&#39;t have any actual documentation (names, wr=\r\niting, jewelry, etc...), then your best bet [at some point in the future] w=\r\nould be to do genome sequencing, and see how you (or your parent descended =\r\nfrom her) compare.  In particular, if this is a maternal grandmother AND yo=\r\nu assume that her mother was of Japanese descent, then you could compare th=\r\ne mitochondrial DNA in her child (your mom or dad) to that of a japanese po=\r\npulation (or other populations), and see if there are significant matches. =\r\n This isn&#39;t my field of expertise, and I don&#39;t know how distinct the Japane=\r\nse population&#39;s mitochondrial DNA (as a whole) is relative to the rest of e=\r\nastern asia, but this could be a future avenue of exploration.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t =\r\ntrust the companies that perform human genome sequencing just yet, but in t=\r\nhe not too distant future they should be fairly reliable.\n\nIf you are looki=\r\nng for documentation, then you should probably consider the Japanese govern=\r\nment.  They had very tight population (entering/leaving) controls all the w=\r\nay through WWII.  So, she (or her parents) would almost certainly have to h=\r\nave registered their intent to leave the country and then receive permissio=\r\nn.\n\n-dennis\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Chad Janzemini &lt;chadjan=\r\nzemini@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; i have attached a photo of her, tell me what you thi=\r\nnk. also if i was to tell you her name or maiden name it=C3=82=C2=A0wouldn&#39;=\r\nt=C3=82=C2=A0help=C3=82=C2=A0because=C3=82=C2=A0i think she might be half o=\r\nr less=C3=82=C2=A0Japanese, from her mother and i=C3=82=C2=A0don&#39;t=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0know her mothers name.=C3=82=C2=A0that&#39;s=C3=82=C2=A0why im researching=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0Japanese=C3=82=C2=A0migrations to=C3=82=C2=A0Iran=C3=82=C2=A0to=\r\n narrow the search down. my family members have always said she could have =\r\nit in her and judging from the photo you could see its a good chance.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: Oyakata &lt;oyakata@...&gt;\n&gt; To: sa=\r\nmuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 30, 2012 12:11 PM\n&gt; Sub=\r\nject: Re: [samuraihistory] info on japanese settlement in iran\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; I am not aware of any large-scale migration from Japa=\r\nn to Persia / Iran.
