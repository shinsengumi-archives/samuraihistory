It&#39;s a \n&gt;good read if mostly nonsense, although some find it insulting \n&gt;and playing up to the idea of the &#39;exotic orient&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ieyasu was a very patient, vcery diplomatic, very skillful \n&gt;leader who knew his own mind and exactly what he wanted and \n&gt;how he was going to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt;History suggests he would listen at length to the council of \n&gt;his hatamoto, and then do precisely what he intended all along. \n&gt;Whilst he and Adams did become friends of sorts, I reckon it \n&gt;\n&gt;was always on the basis that Adams was such an outsider that he \n&gt;could pose no threat as such. I doubt whether Adams ever got a \n&gt;grip of the convoluted politics of Sengoku Japan, let alone the \n&gt;deeper workings of Ieyasu&#39;s mind. \n&gt;\n&gt;Regardless of what Adams thought of the Jesuits, Ieyasu played \n&gt;his own game, and if anything Adams would have supplied the \n&gt;information Ieyasu wanted to make a case for or against.\n&gt;\n&gt;In short, his closest retainers rarely knew what was in his \n&gt;mind, and I doubt any opinion Adams might have held would have \n&gt;swayed him one iota.\n&gt;\n&gt;As far as I know, Adams was the only foreigner to make the rank \n&gt;of samurai, let alone hatamoto.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you&#39;re really interested get hold of &quot;The Needle-Watcher&quot; by\n&gt;Richard Blaker, a fictional biography of Adams and much, much \n&gt;more accurate.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thomas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;---\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
