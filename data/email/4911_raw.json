Currently shodan, my nidan test is in November. As \nI said there IS overlap. Some Zen practitioners use Kyudo as a tool for \nspiritual development. In these cases Kyudo is no different than use of any \nother koan.\n  However, this is not the WAY. As put down in the writings of \nInagaki-sensei. Kokoro no Yumi is not zen although it does share some \naspects. Nate phrased it well when he mentioned what a small percentage of \nJapanese follow Zen precepts. Do a search on Herrigel It has pretty much \nbeen concluded that there were huge misunderstandings between him and his \nteacher ( a man who was a laughingstock among the Kyudo community). In Kyudo \nand kendo, there are serious mental/spiritual issues to deal with once \ntechnique has been conquered, but cloaking things in mysticism is a disguise \nfor teachers who don&#39;t understand the core of thier arts.\n\n  Don&#39;t get me wrong I have respect for Zen practitioners. A friend of mine \nfrom Spain who was doing Kyudo for spiritual aspects left to begin Chado \nabout 6 months ago. However, Zen doesn&#39;t permeate the air you breathe in \nJapan, or even the air in dojo.\n\nThis links in to some of my thoughts recently about why I love japanese \nculture so much. When we are young we believe in magic. As we age we \ndiscover there is no Santa Claus, no Easter bunny, no magic. Some people \nturn to religion. Others to mysticism. When I was a teenager, I was one of \nthose wannabe ninja/samurai. (The ones who drive Tony and myself insane with \nthier &quot;facts&quot;)I believed in the mystic. I am fortunate in that when I \ndiscovered it&#39;s smoke, mirrors and physics, I had already learned about \nother interesting aspects of the culture.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTired of spam?
