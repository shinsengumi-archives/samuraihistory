Maybe you should describe her a\n&gt; little the way you \n&gt; did the samurai (An important looking man with a\n&gt; long and short sword \n&gt; tied to his waist...) rather than just call her a\n&gt; &quot;waitress&quot;. Not to \n&gt; mention the &quot;waitress waiting&quot; sentence is a bit\n&gt; awkward.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kyle Segall&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Well, since its ok for publishing rights, I guess\n&gt; I should go ahead \n&gt; &gt; and post the excerpt I&#39;ve been handing out. Tony,\n&gt; Nate, I know you \n&gt; &gt; two will tear it apart best as possible so I won&#39;t\n&gt; bother asking. \n&gt; &lt;g&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BTW, this is the very begining of the book, its\n&gt; just kind of meant \n&gt; &gt; to set up the time and introduce the people to\n&gt; (basically) what the \n&gt; &gt; time and place was like.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
