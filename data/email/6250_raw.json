And indeed, my fondness for my Chen\nblades may leave me in a position calling for redemption all my own, among\nsome of the greater purists on the list.  I&#39;ll check that site, in truth,\nwhen I have my brain back.  I&#39;m coming down with the flu, and at present I\nfeel as though I&#39;ve been randomly fined about half my wits.\nI appreciate the suggestion, as I&#39;m always glad to find sources for decent\nblades.  A month does not go by without some student asking me for a good\nsource.\nBlessings and good faring,\nGereg\n\nP.S.  And I too have a little familiarity with Eliade&#39;s work, by the by.\nNot a name I was expecting to come across here.\n\nMessage: 8\n   Date: Fri, 10 Dec 2004 08:58:19 -0000\n   From: &quot;Dodu Gabriel&quot; &lt;dodu_gabriel@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Toledo swords - veering OT at a dangerous rate\n\n\n\n  Hello Gereg,\n\n  I&#39;m sorry I rushed to write about that site, because on further\nexamination, I have discovered that it is a fake. My mistake...Thank\nyou for helping me and tell me what do you think of this site:\nwww.jidai.jp, although I&#39;m having difficulties at this time buying a\n300 Euros sword...So the site is just a dream, besides, since I don&#39;t\ntake any Kendo or any alike, I wouldn&#39;t know what to do with a sword,\nbut to admire its beauty.\n\n  Sorry again, and I hope I have redeemed myself in your eyes :)\n\n  Respectfully,\n\n  Gabriel\n\n\n\n\n\n"
