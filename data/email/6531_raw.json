It featured a \n&gt; left handed samurai who wore his swords on the\n&gt; right. Are there any famous \n&gt; historical figures who done this? I have never seen\n&gt; anyone in kendo or Iai \n&gt; practice left handed, so I was just wondering?\n\nI can&#39;t speak for sure, but Japanese usually taught\ntheir left-handed children to &quot;become&quot; right-handed.\nNot just in swordsmanship, but in all things,\nleft-handedness was looked at as a deformity,\nalmost--even today, it&#39;s considered extremely strange.\nThe character in the movie you mention is almost\ncertainly a movie construct--the reason today you\ndon&#39;t see kendoka learning left-handed is that all\nstyles taught left-handedness out of their pupils. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
