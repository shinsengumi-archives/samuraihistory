There were actually a separate series of ranks for Princes\napart from the &#39;common&#39; nobility to distinguish these members of the\nImperial family.  The usual way around this was to marry your\ndaughters into the Imperial line, and thus govern as the grandfather,\nfather, or uncle of the emperor.\n\nI&#39;d say one of the first attempts to possibly replace the Emperor, or\nat least attain status as an Imperial prince, was that of Soga no\nEmishi, who seems to have tried to elevate his own son to such a\nposition (that may be Fujiwara propoganda, of course).  Later, the\nFujiwara gain control by marrying their daughters into the Imperial\nline, creating &#39;Fujiwara&#39; emperors (emperors descended from the\nImperial and Fujiwara lines).  Part of their power base came from\nbeing directly related with the sovereign.  In a similar vein, the\ninsei government of retired emperors was based largely on them being\nthe previous emperors and father or grandfather to the current\nemperor.  It wasn&#39;t too far a step for Kiyomori to envision himself\nand his descendants in a similar position, because by his time this\n*was* the accepted means of obtaining power.\n\nThat was partly what was so remarkable about Yoritomo;  he really set\nup a warrior government, while Kiyomori, the bridge between courtier\nand warrior, appears to have been trying to model more on the court\ngovernment of the day.  Yoritomo even moved most of the real\nadministration out to Kamakura, isolating himself, to an extent, from\nthe court nobility.\n\nAshikaga Yoshimitsu is another interesting character.  He came the\nclosest to really doing away with the Imperial power, becoming\nrecognized as &#39;King of Japan&#39; by China, but his descendants ceded much\nof their power to the daimyo and the emperor.\n\nThe imperial family does seem to have remained on the throne since at\nleast the 6th century, though before that I believe the Kojiki and\nNihongi (aka Nihon Shoki) are considered less reliable from an\nhistorical point of view, since dates in them don&#39;t always correspond\nto dates of their contemporaries on the mainland, who were keeping\nmore meticulous records at the time.  Combine that with the incredible\nsymmetry of the early histories of dates of numerological importance,\nand it becomes a matter of debate before then.\n\n\n-Josh\n\n"
