And of \nthis i have always wondered why they had it in the first place and \nwhy it changed? both the que and amount of shaved head over the \ncenturies.\n\nI have wondered that perhaps it was a mixture of both thier warrior \ncult ways.( i use the term cult in the sence that after the Hideyoshi \nsword edics and the rise of the bushi as top of the political and \nsocial prymid. the bushi took the beliefs and ideals of Shinto, \nBuddism, and a little Confusionism to make Bushido.) And thier \nobvious religious underpinnings. If anyone has any idea&#39;s.\n\nArigato\nKazuri Atsi\n\n\n\n\n"
