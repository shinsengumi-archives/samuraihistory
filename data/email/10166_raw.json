CAN YOU DESCRIBE ARMOR ?\nTo be honest, the armour varies somewha=\r\nt by period.  Is there a specific type of armour that you=92re looking for =\r\na description of?\n\n2.   WHY WAS THE SWORD THE SAMURAI&#39;S MOST PRIZED MOST PO=\r\nSSESSUIN ?\nAgain this varies by period. At times only the samurai class wer=\r\ne permitted to carry a katana so it was a status symbol.  Some were very ex=\r\npensive or family hairlooms.  Depending on the period, samurai could have b=\r\neen engaged in combat or could have been simply bureaucrats.  So the katana=\r\n=92s significance really depends.\n\n3. WHAT WERE THE 2 SWORDS THAT THE SAMUR=\r\nAI CARRIED  ?\nThe 2 swords together are called daisho.  The shorter is the =\r\nwakizashi, the longer is the katana.\n\n4.WHAT WERE THE 2 SWORDS USED FOR ?\nT=\r\nhe wakizashi was a companion sword. It had a few uses but was typically the=\r\n sword worn indoors since it=92s shorter.  The longer katana was the main d=\r\nueling/battle sword\n\n7. WHAT IS BUSHIDO ?\nBushido roughly translated means =\r\n=91way of the warrior=92.  It=92s essentially a code of conduct where follo=\r\nwers adhered to principles of rectitude, loyalty, courage, respect, benevol=\r\nence, honesty & honour.\n \nI=92m responding from work so I apologize for the=\r\n lack of detail.  Pretty much all of the answers to your questions can be f=\r\nound in greater detail through a google search.\n \nCheers!\n\n\n----- Original =\r\nMessage -----\nFrom: Daniel Seo &lt;DigimonDaniel0907@...&gt;\nDate: Thursday=\r\n, April 15, 2010 11:50 pm\nSubject: [samuraihistory] I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT=\r\n SAMURAI...................\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n\n&gt; 1.
