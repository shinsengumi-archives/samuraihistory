I have Japanese ancestry through my father&#39;s family. His great grand-father, Hiroki Masazumi immigrated to Canada, to apparently, avoid a marriage to a woman whom he did not love.\n \nHe settled in north-western NorthWest Territories (very very large territory) and started a family there, in the town of Fort Good Hope.\n \nI was not aware of my Japanese ancestry, but it made a-lot of sense to me as I&#39;ve always carried a strong interest in the Japanese culture, more specifically, the Samurai.\n \nI was hoping I can be directed to a source that could possibly shed some light on the Masazumi family name. I&#39;ve tried web searching at a couple search engines, but didn&#39;t find anything I don&#39;t already know, which isn&#39;t much.\n \nAny and all help will be appreciated.\n \nRegards.....Ramal\n \n \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nPost your free ad now!
