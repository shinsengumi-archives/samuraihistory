Being a man who admits when he is\n&gt;wrong I concede to the fact that squid may be written in katakana\n&gt;although I have not seen this in any of the sushiya I frequent.\n&gt;However I beg you please tell me how ika may be written in kanji.\n&gt;With all these messages for this one small matter I certainly hope\n&gt;the original asking member has been satisfied.\n&gt;\n&gt;I may be expelled from this group for saying this and that would be\n&gt;truly a shame as I have enjoyed the various conversations immensely.\n&gt;Far too often the conversations turn away from a pleasant learning\n&gt;experience into an aggressive &quot;my stick is bigger than your stick&quot;\n&gt;banter. It is understood that many of the writers hold degrees in\n&gt;Japanese history. That being said it is also true that many of us\n&gt;don&#39;t. Does that make us somehow unworthy of comment or do you\n&gt;simply derive pleasure in the belittlement of others?\n&gt;\n&gt;We are all here because we share an interest in the history, lives\n&gt;and values of the samurai. It is wonderful to have a group of people\n&gt;who share this common interest and can both teach as well as learn\n&gt;from one another. To that end I would say this, &quot;Serve the group and\n&gt;not one&#39;s self interest of greatness, for all will be the better for\n&gt;it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hirai\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Phil &lt;ptourigny@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rob wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ika is written only in hiragana. Katakana is usually reserved\n&gt;for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; words that did not originate in Japan or what we call borrowed\n&gt;words.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    &lt;sigh&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    No. I see &quot;ika&quot; written in katakana much more often than in\n&gt;hiragana,\n&gt; &gt; though both (and kanji, for that matter) are possible. Japanese\n&gt;has\n&gt; &gt; tendencies and preferences (one of which is the use of katakana\n&gt;for\n&gt; &gt; animals and plants) in terms of which script is most often used to\n&gt;write\n&gt; &gt; certain words, but few strict rules; which script gets used often\n&gt; &gt; depends partly on the context the word is used in, and partly on\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; writer&#39;s preference.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Phil\n&gt; &gt; Men with sharpness of mind are to be found only among those with a\n&gt; &gt; penchant for thought. -- Shiba Yoshimasa\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;Yahoo!
