I am presently in search of the sansom text you suggested, yet, I couldn&#39;t get the volume set nearby.  I can get some of his other works though, and will secure them promptly.  \n\nI am hoping to set the simulation during the 1614 edict occasion rather than the later ban on all nationals which as you said is by the 3rd shogun of the Tokugawa.  I realize the meeting never really took place where European officials would be allowed to &quot;make their case&quot;, but the simulation should be an excellent occasion to see some key cultural and economic issues come to a head.\n\nI suppose my most difficult task is to find basically about 8 prominent daimyo that the students can represent as Iyeysu&#39;s &quot;court&quot;\n\nobenjokusanosuke &lt;obenjokusanosuke@...&gt; wrote:                               --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Wade&quot; &lt;peterruhan@...&gt; wrote:\n &gt;\n &gt; \n &gt; Hello, I am a history teacher in California, and I am attempting to\n &gt; create a historical simulation regarding Iyeysu and the closing off \n of\n &gt; Japan to Europeans.  I am attempting to find out some histories or\n &gt; records of the events.  I would particularly like to know some of \n the\n &gt; prominent families/personas of the Tokugawa period alive in the \n early\n &gt; 1600&#39;s.  \n &gt; \n &gt; I have the following list\n &gt; \n &gt; Iyeysu Tokugawa\n &gt; Mori Terumoto\n &gt; Uyesugi\n &gt; Date Masamune\n &gt; Yamnanouchi\n &gt; Ukita\n &gt; Satake\n &gt; \n &gt; I need 2 more and/or comments on the families listed.  I already \n have\n &gt; hit the Samurai Archives for family history.  More help and \n direction\n &gt; would be, well....helpful.\n &gt; \n &gt; Many thanks,\n &gt; \n &gt; Wade Ness\n &gt; Social Studies\n &gt; Oak Ridge High School\n &gt;\n There is just one fundamental problem with all of this, although your \n idea sounds like a lot of fun. Ieyasu did not close-off Japan. It was \n his grandson, the third Tokugawa Shogun, Iemitsu, who ultimately \n closed Japan to all but the Dutch, Chinese and Koreans.\n \n There are numerous books that touch upon this subject. I would \n recommend one of the general survey-type history books that George \n Sansom wrote on Japan for starters. Volume 3 of his trilogy should do \n the trick.\n \n \n     \n                               \n\n __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
