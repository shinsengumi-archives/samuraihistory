(was RE: [samuraihistory] R\ne: h itokiri k\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; And I&#39;m still going to make my own point.\n\nTHEN direct that point to the group, and not AT me.\nNot that you necessarily did this, but Onnagozen did.\nYou simply followed on with his/her post, so therefore came across as doing\nthe same thing. \n\nOnnagozen replied directly to me, but as we&#39;ve said, with a tangentially\nperpendicular point. If you reply directly to me, I&#39;m going to directly\nanswer, especially when addressed in an argumentative and combative manner.\nI&#39;ve got no problem if you or he/she or anyone wants to argue the merits and\nfoibles of history books, in specific, or in general. I DO have a problem\nwhen this is couched as a counterargument to my statement, because it\ndoesn&#39;t counter my statement whatsoever. \n\nWhat we had was this: \n\nNate: &quot;Tangerines are not red.&quot; \n\nDissenter: &quot;Well, neither are all apples red! So how do we really know which\nones are red and which ones aren&#39;t? Does it matter? What does it matter if\nyour apple is red and my tangerine is blue, as long as it inspires me? And\ncertain tangerines may be of such hues of orange that they may be very very\nclose to red.&quot; \n\nSimple facts: not everyone can tell that tangerines are not red. Many\ntangerines may be so orange they are close to being red, but being red is\nnot the point of a tangerine. For purposes of this analogy, all apples\nSHOULD be red--the fact that many are green or brown is a warning to the\npartaker that they need to check their apples before they eat them, but not\ngrounds for saying that a. all apples are bad, or b. all tangerines are\nequally red with apples. \n\n\n\n That there\n&gt; is an overlap in the\n&gt; use of film or other fiction and the use of non-fiction historical \n&gt; works. I think that each instance of citing either film and/or \n&gt; historical works needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis rather \n&gt; than by using sweeping statements i.e. &quot;history books seek to tell the \n&gt; facts whereas film/fiction seeks to entertain.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 10:01 PM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?

I addressed the issue of \n&gt; historical works versus fiction works. You can point out all the \n&gt; issues with various historical works you wish, the simple fact is that \n&gt; historical works, by definition, in a historical context, have greater \n&gt; value FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEARCHING OUT HISTORICAL FACTS, then fiction \n&gt; works do.\n&gt; Anybody who&#39;s more inspired by Sansom&#39;s Volume I than by Kurosawa&#39;s \n&gt; Rashomon has no heart--however, Rashomon is a work of \n&gt; fiction--inspiration is the point, not facts. Each accomplishes their \n&gt; goal admirably--and confusing the two is where we run into issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Yahoo!
