Their approach was \nsomewhat more pragmatic. The sword represents them, rather than \nthey being symbolised by the sword. The names of sword, as discussed,\nowe nothing to mystique, more to about how someone came into\npossession of the blade.\n\nThere was probably one called &#39;the shop on the corner&#39;.\n\nMystique - I don&#39;t think so - just the sepia-tinted voice of\nignorance, sentimentality and nostalgia.\n\n(If one hand to examine the effect of the sword close up, I bet that\ngoes some way to dispelling the mystique)\n\nIn fact, I wonder whether &#39;mystique&#39; occurs when one doesn&#39;t know\nenough about the object to appreciate it properly?\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
