As for &#39;Torakami&#39; - it isn&#39;t a word, and if the two characters \nwere seen together they would be read something like &#39;kojin&#39; - \nalthough I doubt that&#39;s a word.  Like another poster on here stated, \n&#39;tora no tamashii&#39; would litteraly mean &#39;spirit of the tiger&#39;.  \nToranokami would be pretty cool, but I don&#39;t know how well it would \nfit in &#39;reality&#39; since all of the ~no kamis were always preceeded by \nthe name of a province.\n\n\n\n\n"
