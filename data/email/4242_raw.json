Even if just the Hawaiians voted, they felt they could stay \nan\n&gt; independent country at the time. The US backed coup came as an\n&gt; unpleasant surprise. P.S. Look up the difference in the US between \na\n&gt; territory and a state, It took about 60 years for Hawaii to become \na state.\n\nI think Tristan might be right with the annex of Hawaii to Japan.  \nAccording to the book &quot;Stolen Kingdom&quot;, the Hawaiian monarchy had \nasked Japan for the referndum.  Several years prior, Hawaii had asked \nthe US to be a territory (but still a sovreign state) but the US \nrefused, twice.  Primarily because the US didn&#39;t see any benefit in \nit.  Hawaii was being bullied around.  Although, Hawaii was its own \ncountry, the Hawaiian military was not strong enough to stand up to \nthe super powers of that time.  Treaties were being forced upon them \nthat put Hawaiians at a severe disadvantage.  Hawaii needed to align \nitself with another country in order to retain its sovriegnty.  Since \nthe US had refused and the Monarchy thought a Pacific alliance would \nstrengthen the dying Hawaiian bloodline, they asked Japan.\n\nI don&#39;t think it was a ploy to push Japan&#39;s buttons.  I don&#39;t even \nthink annexing Hawaii was a US decision.  The decision belonged to \none man, Dole (think pineapples).  A rich landowner who decided he \nneeded to protect his property in Hawaii.  So he (having the support \nof most US Marines on Oahu) decided to storm the Palace.  The actions \nwere illegal and unconstitutional but resulted in the statehood of \nHawaii.\n\nBrandon\n\n\n"
