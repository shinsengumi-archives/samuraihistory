I was wondering if anyone here&#39;s watching the weekly Historical\n &gt;     dramas of NHK. I&#39;ve been watching them since my college days starting\n &gt;     with th &quot;Aoi&quot; series. Just a question, how accurate are they?\n\nThere usually pretty good but in the case of many of the characters they \nhave to invent many details. Sometimes they alter history to make a \nbetter story like when Hideyoshi watches Goemen boil, it never happened \nbut they were plot friends. Yoshitsune and Musashi had a fair amount of \nthis as well, still they were great! Much better than Shinsengumi. The \ncurrent one is OK but not a knockout. Next best thing to chanbara....\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
