Feel free to jump\nin here. See the post I cited below my reply. I snipped out all from the\npost other than the parts relevant to this particular discussion.\n\nNot all issues of history concern historical fact. Some issues do. Such as\nthe dates when certain events happened. We do know that on Dec. 14, 1702,\nthat a number of former retainers of Lord Asano Nagayori attacked the\nmansion of Lord Kira Yoshinaka. Now, there is a dispute and disagreement\namong various scholars whose sources I&#39;ve consulted as to the actual number\nof former Ako retainers who attacked. Some say that there were 47, some say\nthat there were 46. So there you go, what would seem to be empirical\nhistorical fact (that 47 former Ako retainers attacked Lord Kira Yoshinaka\non Dec. 14, 1702) is actually under dispute. But the date is established as\nfact. \n\nBut studying history also involves studying concepts, trends, ideas. Which\nare not always supported by facts that everyone agrees with i.e. the date of\na certain event. \n\nConcerning the film SEPPUKU. Let&#39;s define &quot;entertainment. As defined on\nDictionary.com\n\n&quot;en*ter*tain*ment    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (ntr-tnmnt)\nn. \nThe act of entertaining. \nThe art or field of entertaining. \nSomething that amuses, pleases, or diverts, especially a performance or\nshow. \nThe pleasure afforded by being entertained; amusement: The comedian\nperformed for our entertainment. \nArchaic. Maintenance; support. \nObsolete. Employment.&quot;\n\nI would question that the film SEPPUKU fits under this definition. When I&#39;ve\nseen it, I have not been either amused, pleased, nor diverted. Instead, I&#39;ve\nbeen confronted with the issues and ideas that the film presents. The\nfilmmaker, Kobayashi Masaki, and the novelist, Takiguchi Yasuhiko (upon\nwhose work the film is based), imply have the presented issues have a\nhistorical basis, though their works are presented in fictional form. The\nfilm has raised my curiosity and made me want to seek actual historical\nevidence that events similar to the ones depicted in SEPPUKU may or may not\nhave happened. This list and the learned members here, are one of the\nsources I am consulting to seek out possible information.  \n\nI will readily agree with you that SEPPUKU does not depict historical fact.\nNor is it intended to do so. But SEPPUKU isn&#39;t either pure fantasy or\nscience fiction. There are historical facets that we know are true, such as\nthat in the 17th century, Japan was united under the rule of the Tokugawa\nshogunate. Also that many fiefs were abolished as a part of the\nestablishment of this rule. \n\nWhat is fictional, and not claimed to be fact, is that a ronin, Tsugumo\nHanshiro, killed many members of the Ii clan in avenging the death of his\nson-in-law. I am not seeking historical information on a man named Tsugumo\nHanshiro, as I&#39;m certain that historically, he never existed.\n\nBut I can look at this film and see that it brings up historical issues that\nI wish to explore. Which I am currently doing. Someone on another forum has\ninformed me of some possible historical sources that may claim to reveal\nwhether or not events that are similar to those depicted in SEPPUKU may have\nacually occurred. That&#39;s what I&#39;m looking at. But also, I look at the issues\nraised for a general discussion of history as it happened in 17th century\nJapan. \n\nSo no, studying a film like SEPPUKU is NOT the same as studying the written\nworks of (as an example) Fumazawa Banzin, a scholar who lived and wrote\nduring the 17th century about issues that were contemporary for him during\nthe time that he lived. Nor is it like studying a work such as those written\nby Stephen Turnbull or George Sansome or Donald Keene, who are contemporary\nwriters who seek to document dates and other events in what they see as a\nfactual basis.    \n\nBut studying a film like SEPPUKU is not the same as studying entertainment\n(such as the ZATOICHI films) and attempting to claim that it is historical\nfact when films like these clearly do fit the definition of &quot;entertainment&quot;\nas defined above.\n\nI&#39;m probably as clear as mud here. I hope I&#39;ve not confused anyone too\nbadly.\n\nNina \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Friday, October 21, 2005 9:31 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?

You know that. \n\nIt is tenuous in the\n&gt; extreme to say that its purpose was to depict absolute fact i.e. that \n&gt; a real person named Tsugumo Hanshiro existed in history and he avenged \n&gt; the death of this son-in-law against the Ii clan. But to say that the \n&gt; film (and the novel on which it is based) was made only to entertain, \n&gt; not in any way to discuss history, would be equally tenuous to state.\n\n&quot;Discuss history&quot; is quite separate from &quot;outline historical facts&quot;.\nCertainly you could use the movie to discuss the situation of the times that\nthe movie depicts. Does it represent historical fact? No. Can it give you\ninsight into historical facts? Quite possibly. It&#39;s still not historical\nrecord, NOR IS IT INTENDED TO BE. You keep saying that even books intended\nto be history need to be checked and verified and (with as much as you say\nit) believed only skeptically--HOW MUCH MORE A WORK OF FICTION?\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page! \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
