Where the JA \n(japanese american) citizens of the US were detained in &quot;camps&quot;.  \nI&#39;m specifically looking for information concerning the JA \nIndividuals that were taken just prior to the announcement (and \nenforcement) of the internment camp mandate. If what has been told \nto me is true, these individuals (held in N. Dakota) would be \nthe &quot;last&quot; samurai derived of the Satsuma Reb.  I&#39;m specifically \nlooking into a family history which has been held in secret till \n2002. So any information would help.  Thank you.\nTyler Shimizu\n\n\n\n"
