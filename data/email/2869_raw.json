The \nImperial forces outnumbered them approximately 4:1 and yet it took them about 7 \nmonths to defeat the Samurai.  Casualties were approximately 10,000 for each \nside.\n\nThat means that even though the Samurai were outnumbered 4:1 that they \ninflicted equal casualties.  If that constitutes being easily defeated than I hope I \nnever see a tough campaign.  :)\n\nBob Burke\n\n\nIn a message dated 12/13/03 11:03:10 AM, mitsurugi_guy@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;m going to go see the movie today, but I cant remember the exact\n\nname.  I think it was soemthing like the Saigo or Meji Rebellion,\n\nsince those were the two involoved. It was in 1877 when the new\n\nimperial geovernment was taking the samurai&#39;s swords from them. A\n\nbunch of samurai rebelled, but were defeated rather easily with the\n\nimperial armies guns. \n\n\nOne other one you might be thinking of happened earlier on, when the\n\ncountry was being unified. The Hogen Rebellion, a samurai rebellion\n\nagainst the imperial succession. \n\n\nThose are the two I remember with guns vs. swords. \n\n\nI hope Tom Cruise dies at the end.\n\n &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
