Thank you for your kindness.\nYes, of course there is a lot of st=\r\nuff in Tokyo, but mainly in japanese. I got a history class in Jochii, but =\r\nmost of the students are people only interested in fulfill their quota of c=\r\nlasses.\nAnd my major interst in not only study history or see castles... th=\r\nat is very intersting so far, but I would like to talk and do something abo=\r\nut it, although if only to share a cup of ocha and having a passionate disc=\r\nussion about swords and chrysanthemums. With english speakers! (well, spani=\r\nsh is to dream too much) I am so tired and dissapointed myself with my niho=\r\nngo!\nThank you again.\n\nTom Helm &lt;toryu@...&gt; wrote:               =\r\n                   Rod -\n  Not sure anybody answered you but here is my inp=\r\nut. The Japanese Art  \n Sword Preservation Society NBTHK, and the Japanese =\r\nSword Preservation  \n Society NTHK, both have monthly meetings in Tokyo, ma=\r\nny of the  \n members are like minded individuals with a deep appreciation o=\r\nf  \n Japanese Art, History, Politics and of course Arms and Armour. New  \n =\r\nmembers are always welcome and I am sure you can find other groups  \n like =\r\nthis one, thru contacts there.\n  I would also suggest keeping an eye out fo=\r\nr museum exhibitions  \n featuring reenactment groups, they do exist in Japa=\r\nn and while some  \n are given to cardboard costumes many are serious collec=\r\ntors and  \n students of history. If you are indeed in Tokyo you are sure to=\r\n find  \n a world of people and things to satisfy your interest.\n in envy,\n =\r\n-t\n www.ncjsc.org\n http://www.touken.or.jp/\n \n On Aug 23, 2006, at 4:39 AM,=\r\n rodjuri wrote:\n \n &gt; Greetings:\n &gt;\n &gt; I am Rodrigo Juri.
