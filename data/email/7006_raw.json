I wanted to\ndo a \n&gt; little more learning on the subject. Do any of you know of a good \n&gt; website where I can find legit info. on the subject? How about\nbooks \n&gt; are there any good ones on the subject too?\n&gt; \n&gt; Later,\n&gt; Rod\n\n\nI can&#39;t say much about websites, but there definately are many good\nbooks on the subject.  Most books provide little more than an overview\nof the subject and vary only in the quality of details and\nillustrations/photos.  Of these types, my favorite is: &#39;Geisha: A\nUnique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art&#39; by John Gallagher. \nAdmitedly, Gallagher&#39;s book provides little information that you\ncouldn&#39;t find in a dozen other books, but the photos and art work his\nbook provides are of a somewhat higher quality.  His book is the only\none I have ever found that offers illustrations on every layer of\nclothing the Geisha wore.  If you search your local bookstore or surf\naround Amazon.com, you will easily find a number books on the subject.\n\nThe book I think you should start with, though, is: Geisha: A Life&#39; by\nMineko Iwasaki.  This book is an autobiography of Mineko Iwasaki, the\nwoman Arthur Golden&#39;s main character was built around.  Her book\nprovides a very intimate look into the world of the Geisha.\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
