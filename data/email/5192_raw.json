He was born under the name Takigawa in 1540 \nand died in 1612. He was the adopted son of Maeda Toshihisa (brother \nof Maeda Toshiie) and became a ronin after Toshiie took over control \nof the clan (seems as if he was a great fighter but lousy at \nfollowing orders). Around the time of Sekigahara he served the Uesugi \nunder yet another name, Hyottosai Kokuzoin. After Sekigahara he \nbecame a ronin again. Like Yagyu Jubei (and to an extant Musashi), \nhis wanderings as a ronin and disappearances from mainstream history \nled to a lot of idle speculation and exaggerated stories.\nGame designers sure like him-he&#39;s been in Kessen along with Samurai \nWarriors and the Onimusha series.\n\n\n\n"
