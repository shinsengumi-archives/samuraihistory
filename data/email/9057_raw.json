He was the youngest son in the rich family, whose father ran a big shop. In those days, there was a class distinctions called, &quot;shi-nou-kou-sho&quot; (samurai, farmer, artisan and merchant in descending order of rank). In Tosa, the samurai divided into two class, joshi and goshi(Upper and lower). The Sakamoto family belonged to the merchant class, lowest in the class distinctions. Ryoma&#39;s father bought the right to be a goshi, a lower class samurai. The difference between joshi and goshi were strict rules. For example, joshi can have an umbrella when it rains, but goshi can&#39;t. Joshi can wear &quot;tabi&quot; a kind of socks, but goshi can&#39;t. Ryoma was born under this circumstance.&quot;\n\nDoes anyone know any other rules that differentiated between Goshi and Joshi?\n\nThanks\n\nTotok Sudarijanto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
