The people who\n&gt; &quot;deserved&quot; the title \n&gt; XYZ *were* XYZ. It&#39;s a binary thing -- either one\n&gt; was, or one wasn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai were members of a specific social class that\n&gt; once existed, and \n&gt; the only people who by rights ought be called\n&gt; samurai *were* the \n&gt; samurai. (That much is simple logic, no?) And no one\n&gt; can be called, \n&gt; properly, &quot;samurai&quot; today as there are no more\n&gt; samurai by law.\n\n\nTony, I think the problem is your use of the word\n&quot;deserve&quot;. While in the sense I think you mean it&#39;s\nused as &quot;applicable to&quot;, as in the word &quot;samurai&quot;\napplies to a member of that particular social class\nfrom that time period, some people are going to think\nof deserve as meeting some set of behavior criteria.\nThis plays right into the hands of the &quot;all samurai\nare noble, live by bushido, blah blah&quot; crowd, and\nhence the confusion. \n\nIn that sense, there&#39;s no &quot;deserve&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t\ndeserve&quot;. You either simply &quot;were&quot; a samurai, or you\nweren&#39;t, regardless of what you did, good or bad. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
