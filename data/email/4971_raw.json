R. Williams\u001b$B$5$s\u001b(B wrote:\n\nMuch too much is made of &quot;the&quot; ceremony of seppuku. There are \nrelatively few first hand accounts of this kind of ceremony. What \naccounts there are, vary based on geography, time, and other \nparticulars.\n\nI think that our modern notions of the seppuku ceremony are \ntremendously impacted by the fact that seppuku was formally outlawed \nin the Tokugawa period. It seems to me that the ceremony became a \nkind of romanticized part of the warrior past; made to look more \nuniform than it actually was.\n\n&gt;The \n&gt;angle(s) of the cut to the stomach are highly debatable but the most common \n&gt;one that I have seen is horizontally left to right then vertically up the \n&gt;center into the heart.  \n\n It&#39;s my understanding that the angles are pretty limited by \nbiology and physics - there&#39;s not much debate in what I&#39;ve read \nabout the angle per se that has to be taken.\n\nIf by debatable angles, you mean there are various ways that seppuku \nwas actually done then yes I agree. It appears that the most &quot;popular&quot; \ncuts were the ichimonji which is the cut straight across from left to \nright, and the juumonji, which is the &#39;cross&#39; cut you describe \nabove.\n\n&gt;The assistant has the most important job\n\nTell that to the guy slicing his gut open. :)\n\n&gt;If the one performing seppuku \n&gt;manages to go through the whole procedure then the second decapites him to \n&gt;end his misery.  The decapitation must be done just right or else the head \n&gt;will roll away and disgrace both men.  Ideally the neck must be cut and the \n&gt;head drop down into the lap.\n\nThis again is a bit stylized. As the seppuku ceremony evolved and \nchanged, there were cases where instead of a sword, a fan was placed \nin front of the person committing seppuku. In other words there was \nnot a bit of the ideal described above. The man was trotted out and \nhis head sliced off without any opportunity to show his bravery.\n\nThere are said to be over 50 ways that this could play out: i.e., with \na second (kaishaku) or not; straight cut or cross cut; further \nstabbing of the throat, or heart, etc.\n\nIn other words, just like most things in life, there was no one way \nthat seppuku (or even more broadly, ritualized suicide) was, ehem, \nexecuted. It&#39;s a complicated picture that surely had an idealized, \nromantic, stylized archtype. But the reality that we can see via \nhistorical record doesn&#39;t necessary match that archtype.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
