By the time the Sengoku came around, I think they \nwere more or less empty titles.\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;muds_theaz&quot; &lt;muds_theaz@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi there,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m currently researching The Sengoku period. When searching around \n&gt; on the web, or reading through books I see mention of court titles \n&gt; such as Gyobusho (court minister), and ranks such as vassals and \n&gt; retainers. However, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to actually find \na \n&gt; layout of the ranks in these sorts of hierarchies and what came \nabove \n&gt; them, below them. Such as: The Daimyo, below him he had vassals \n(how \n&gt; did he choose who were to be his vassals?) and what is the \ndifference \n&gt; between a Vassal and a Retainer? Ideally I&#39;d like to find out what \n&gt; the ranking system was for both the court and the countries \nmilitary \n&gt; was (not just the Daimyos). And, even better, the Imperial Guards.\n&gt; Also, does anyone know if this hierarchy changed when Yoritomo \nbegan \n&gt; the trend of Shogun leaders rather then Royal heads of state?\n\n\n"
