This philosophy really is not\n&gt; that popular \n&gt; &gt; &gt;in Japan. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;As several people have noted, including the\n&gt; original poster, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Nobunaga as villain&quot; is something you might see\n&gt; in computer or \n&gt; &gt; &gt;video cames coming out of Japan. It also exists\n&gt; in some other \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;pop&quot; kinds of entertainment. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;But in most Japanese sources, Nobunaga is not\n&gt; seen as a villain. \n&gt; His \n&gt; &gt; &gt;more over-the-top things that in our day and age\n&gt; are quite \n&gt; shocking, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;were even shocking when they happened. But the\n&gt; overall impression \n&gt; &gt; &gt;is not Nobunaga as villain, but for the most\n&gt; part, Nobunaga as \n&gt; &gt; &gt;heroic figure. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;-- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Jay Kelly \n&gt; &gt; &gt;oyakata@O... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Voce quer um iGMail protegido contra v&#21469;us e\n&gt; spams? \n&gt; &gt; Clique aqui: http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\n&gt; &gt; Ofertas imperd&#21673;eis!
