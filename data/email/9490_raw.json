Sign up ends=\r\n in less than a week.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I really wish I had something good eno=\r\nugh to enter. I&#39;m afraid the\n&gt; &gt; only writings I&#39;ve done will just expose h=\r\now stupid I am to everyone.\n&gt; &gt;  I can&#39;t stop writing funny stories lately.=\r\n  I don&#39;t have time or\n&gt; &gt; patience to write a detailed story with good dev=\r\nelopment.  Description\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t a problem, I just can&#39;t come up with an in=\r\nteresting story unless\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s about something funny. :( Oh well.  I&#39;m sti=\r\nll relatively new at\n&gt; &gt; writing samurai fiction.  I have never been inspir=\r\ned to try until I\n&gt; &gt; came to the Citadel.  Next time I&#39;ll be ready.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess 12 months wasn&#39;t quite enough time :P\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, there is a=\r\n comedy genre, so don&#39;t count yourself out.\n&gt;\n\nIs there anyone else I would=\r\n be competing with in the comedy genre? \nIt would be nice if there was a bu=\r\nnch of competitors.  I have things I\ncan submit, and I have money.  I just =\r\ndon&#39;t want to spend it unless\nit&#39;s really worth a good challenge.  \n\nAs lon=\r\ng as we&#39;re on th subject of competition.  I&#39;m afraid I may have\nto resign f=\r\nrom the cover art contest.  I don&#39;t have the spare time or\nresources to get=\r\n good original art for your cover.  I&#39;m pissed,\nbecause I know I could do i=\r\nt if I was able to get to some good art to\nget some good shots with my digi=\r\ntal camera.  All the art I can find is\ntoo cliche or copyrighted and I won&#39;=\r\nt submit anything that isn&#39;t as\ngood as it should be.  I knew what I wanted=\r\n to do and maybe you might\nconsider doing this.  I wanted to use old, but c=\r\nrisp looking\ncaligraphy art to cover the back behind the book description. =\r\n Not the\nwhole kanji, but a corner of the piece that would show enough to m=\r\nake\nword and not simply brush strokes but not the entire piece.  It would\nb=\r\ne up close and askew.  I thought that would be stylish and still\noffer a go=\r\nod background behind the book description.  On the front,\nranger&#39;s post ins=\r\npired me to do something a bit similar.  Remember the\none we both liked wit=\r\nh the zoomed in gold piece and black backdrop.  I\nhad been considering some=\r\nthing similar before that because of the\nbirds.  When I saw that I knew wha=\r\nt I wanted to do.  I took pictures\nof menuki pieces I got off the tsuka of =\r\none of my swords and created a\nsimilar looking cover as the one ranger post=\r\ned, but I need the back\nart not only to make the back but also to match the=\r\n color for the\nbackground in the front or possibly use a shot of the free s=\r\npace on\nthe calligraphy art to give it more texture.  Anyway, I can&#39;t find\n=\r\nwhat I need to make it as good as it should be. \n\n\n"
