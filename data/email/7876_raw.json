It is only a problem when we\n&gt;  take a genre like samurai movies (or Westerns in the US) and assume\n&gt;  that the depictions are historically accurate and not filled with\n&gt;  anachronisms and misrepresentations of the time period in which they\n&gt;  are set.\n\nRecent historical big-budget blockbusters like &quot;Braveheart,&quot; \n&quot;Elizabeth,&quot; and &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; come to mind immediately. Though \nthose were historical personages, and the stories had a bit of history \nabout them, they were so a-historical and error-ridden -- to say nothing \nof actual rewriting of history -- that it makes the historian in me weep.\n\nAnd there are people who have gotten their &quot;history&quot; from these films, \nand don&#39;t know how bogus they are.\n\n&gt;  It matters because accuracy matters.\n\nHear, hear.\n\nEveryone now thinks Balian of Ibelin was a bastard son -- a French \nblacksmith -- of Godfrey of Ibelin, and that he bonked and settled down \nwith the Queen of Jerusalem. In fact, Balian (the Younger) was the \nlegitimate son of Balian (the Elder) of Ibelin -- one of three brothers \n-- and was married (quite happily) to the dowager empress of Byzantium.\n\n(Yes, I&#39;m watching Kingdom of Heaven right now...)\n\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
