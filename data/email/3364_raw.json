And \n&gt; actually, I guess the whole ID thing isn&#39;t too much\n&gt; of a big deal, I \n&gt; did my share of barhopping with a highschool girl or\n&gt; three back in \n&gt; the day.\n\nYou can still find them, they just aren&#39;t as common as\nthey used to be. I&#39;ve seen some here and there so far.\nAs for ID&#39;s, you hit the nail on the head--I was 19 my\nwhole year here as a ryuugakusei, and only got carded\nonce--and that wasn&#39;t for age, but to check what\ncountry I was from! The bar only made gaijin show ID!\n\nNate\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool. Try it!\nhttp://webhosting.yahoo.com/ps/sb/\n\n"
