It says directly in\nthere that it&#39;s based on the movie you have (also\ntitled GI Samurai in the US). It&#39;s fairly obvious if\nyou read the article that they are talking about a new\nmovie.\n\nFor the record, it came out 1 June, and I saw it on 7\nJune. It&#39;s darn good--not going to win any Oscars, but\nmuch better than the cheesiness of the 1970&#39;s version. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
