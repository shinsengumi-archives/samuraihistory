From all the historical novels that I have read, you make the &quot;bones&quot; of your book historical, and then flesh it out with the fiction. You have your &quot;hero or heroine&quot; interact with the historical. Am I making sence to you? My sister is a published author of historical novels and I do all of her research and critiqing before she publishes(writing is a side-line from her real love of teaching). And from what I have read that you have put on the website, I can&#39;t wait for the book to come out.\n              Yours truelly,\n                            Captain Nemo(gloria)\n\nLilith &lt;lillith.saintcrow@...&gt; wrote:\nHey all,\n\nThanks for all the help. I am still working out just how much of the \nbook is supposed to be &#39;fantasy&#39; and how much is supposed to be &#39;real \nand accurate&#39;, so this is TREMENDOUSLY helpful.\n\nI am heading to San Francisco for a week and when I come back will \nprobably have a clearer picture. As I said, I&#39;m only 10,000 words in, \nso now&#39;s the time to do all the work, LOL.\n\nThank you all for your kind help- I will no doubt be bothering you \nwith more questions when I come back. You can relax, though- I won&#39;t \npost any more of the book. (You&#39;ll be spared that much, at least.)\n\nThanks to all, and especially Nate,\n\nLili\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
