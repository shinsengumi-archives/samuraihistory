I don&#39;t remember where I got that \n&gt; from, \n&gt; &gt; but did I misread &quot;Aburagawa&quot; as &quot;Yugawa&quot; or was &quot;Yugawa&quot; his \n&gt; &gt; grandfather&#39;s correct last name?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes,Abura can be read as yu,but I think Aburagawa is its correct \nway \n&gt; to read.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, I have the mothers for all of Shingen&#39;s children now except \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; Takeda (Kadoyama) Yoshihisa and the daughter that married Uesugi \n&gt; &gt; Kagekatsu (I don&#39;t have her actual name either - my sources all \n&gt; &gt; say &quot;Onna&quot;) - anyone have thier mother(s)?.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have never heard the name of Kadoyama Yoshihisa.Isn&#39;t it \nKazurayama \n&gt; Nobusada,Shingen&#39;s 6th son.\n&gt; The daughter who married Kagekatsu is generally known by the name \n&gt; Kiku-hime.\n&gt; Aburagawa-bunin bore both of them.She also was the mother of Matsu-\n&gt; hime who was to marry Oda Nobutada(Kimyoumaru).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for Oda Nobutaka&#39;s mother, Saka-shi - does the -shi just \ndenote \n&gt; &gt; that she is from the Saka clan, or does the -shi have another \n&gt; meaning?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Yes,you are absolutely right.In many cases,women&#39;s first name \naren&#39;t \n&gt; kept in Japanese histrical records.So we have no means but to call \n&gt; them by their familly name.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s my pleasure to contribute to your work...\n&gt; \n&gt; Shinsei\n\n\n"
