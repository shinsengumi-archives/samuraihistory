She agreed and he repeated what had happened. She \nwent bright red and walked away.\n\nSome time later she appeared at his desk, and apologised for \nher reaction, but explained that it was locker-room talk and \ntranslated roughly as &#39;up your arse.&#39; (This is England, \nremember.)\n\nSo I&#39;m thinking you&#39;re probably right.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
