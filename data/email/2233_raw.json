I have to wonder if we on this list are not your audience then \n&gt; who is? I am sure we would all love to see more historical fiction \n&gt; set in our favorite time and place but without the &quot;groaners&quot; seen \nin \n&gt; Shogun and The Last Samurai.\n&gt; \tPlease don&#39;t take our criticism too harshly we are being \n&gt; tongue in cheek, we just want to help...\n&gt; -t\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
