However, I would recommend a recently published book to \ngive you an overall feel and vision of the times: &quot;Samurai, an \nillustrated history&quot; by Mitsuo Kure, 2001; published by  Tuttle - \nplenty of full coloured photos of re-enactors, banners and battle \nplans.  And I suppose reading a few novels of the time would provide \nsome faction base - Clavell&#39;s &quot;SHOGUN&quot; must be regarded as essential..\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck with the writing....\n&gt;                                                     Rod Johnson\n&gt; \n&gt; As an aside I used to enjoy the old western movies - I knew they \nwere mostly factually incorrect - but it was entertainment!! So it is \nnot unexpected that I look forward to &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; [and I will \nprobably buy the video (or DVD) when it comes out]. I didn&#39;t look for \nwrist watches, telegraph poles and jet trails in the sky \non &quot;Waterloo&quot;, so I enjoyed it....  Treat &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; as \nentertainment, we couldn&#39;t look to Shakespear for history lessons! \nAnd it may even give another generation interest in &quot;our&quot; subject as \nthe novel SHOGUN did........\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
