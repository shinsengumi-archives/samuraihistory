We perceive \n&#39;knowledge&#39; as, in a sense, &#39;objective data&#39;, to be \nlearnt, imparted from sensei to student, and upon \nthis foundation one can speculate with a lesser or \ngreater degree of accuracy.\n\nThus we are head or question based.\n\nIn the dojo nothing is said, you are shown, and learn \nby example, and emulation. I have memories of sensei \nstopping me, then showing me the form. I do exactly what \nhe does, and he shows me again, I do the same again and \nhe shows me again. I do EXACTLY what he did, and he shakes \nhis head and walks away.\n\nWell, not quite, but the assimilation of knowledge \nthrough training and kata is not &#39;head knowledge&#39; \nbut &#39;heart&#39; or &#39;body knowledge&#39;.\n\nThere is a phrase in Japanese &#39;hand knowledge&#39; - \nit&#39;s to do with how one holds the sword. Although there \nis the basic, most dynamic grip, the position of the \nhands change all the time as one performs the \ntechnique - the training is to stop bad habit (weak grip)\nbut once the hands understand what they&#39;re supposed to do,\nbest leave it up to them.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
