In some respects the Ryoma book was\neasier to read than Jansens book. Instead of writing a &#39;novel&#39; he should\nhave just wrote a straight history. I would have been more pleased with\nthat. Same for the Samurai Sketches. All in all anybody who likes samurai\nwould like these books. Yes he did overuse the word snicker. Guess he\ncouldn&#39;t afford a decent thesaurus.\n\nAlong the lines of samurai historical fiction have you read the new\ntranslation of Shiba Ryotaros Drunk as a Lord. Now there is a true author. I\nhighly recommend that one. Too bad more of his books aren&#39;t available in\nEnglish.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Christopher West &lt;kitsuno@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, July 19, 2001 2:10 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] books by &#39;romulus hillborough&#39;\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve recently come across this: http://www.ridgebackpress.com/\n&gt; does anyone have any info on the author and / or the quality of his\n&gt; work?  If you check the link, you&#39;ll see he has written a biography\n&gt; of sakamoto ryoma, as well as a collection of bio&#39;s of edo-era\n&gt; samurai.  I have never heard of this author before - just curious if\n&gt; anyone else has and may have any comments.\n&gt;\n&gt; c.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
