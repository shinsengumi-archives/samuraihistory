As I\nwas certain that Dux was a fraud (a very fast, legitimately deadly fraud,\nwith some frighteningly effective moves, but still nothing like the adopted\nson of an Old Ninja Family that he pretended to be), I called up Hayes at\nhis studio and asked him something about research.

It set off my internal alarms, and I never\ndid order the books.\n\tGereg\nP.S.  Ooh.  Ah.  (Almost forgot that.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
