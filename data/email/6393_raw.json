Monty Python&#39;s &quot;Life of Brian&quot; or \n&quot;Holy Grail&quot; anyone? However &quot;Last Samurai&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to be a spoof \nunless Tom Cruise is completely clueless. Hmm.... so maybe... but there \nare much better films to watch than this.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;ELIZABETH CHASE&quot; &lt;lizzirrd@...&gt;\n&gt;Gereg,\n&gt;\n&gt;If I recall correctly, you had early on in your writing alluded to &#39;the \n&gt;artist&#39;s eye&#39;, and to perceptions that others might miss.   Some people seem \n&gt;to have an ability to perceive that is so sensitive as to appear \n&gt;&#39;supernatural&#39;, or &#39;mystic&#39;.  Artists, particularly those of Eastern arts, \n&gt;including martial,  are taught (or advised) to learn to put aside their own \n&gt;ego and absorb their environment, especially in the beginning, of their \n&gt;training.  \n&gt;\nThis has not been my personal experience with the three Japanese and \nChinese artists I have studied under. My first sumi-e teacher emphasized \nbeing in a contemplative and relaxed frame of  mind, possibly not \nsurprising since the class was at a Soto Zen church and her husband was \nthe Reverend. My second painting teacher, who is Chinese, really \nemphasizes expressing your feelings and to paint freely. &quot;Drink more \nwine&quot;, as he would say! My calligraphy teacher is very analytical, \nconcentrating on formal styles and techniques and figures the artistic \npart has to come from you.\n\nWhile all three teachers use copying as part of their lessons, it is \nnever intended to suppress your ego, but to simply help you practice a \ncertain stroke or effect. Obviously I&#39;m not that widely experienced, I&#39;d \nbe interested in any personal accounts about training people have received.\n\n&gt;As a person who has knit, crocheted, embroidered, and sewn since she was 7 \n&gt;years old,  the catalog of impressions my brain has stored about fabrics, \n&gt;yarns, and threads is more than I can consciously recall. \n&gt;\nI&#39;ve been painting since I was a child as well, just not very well. \nExperience and practice helps, no need for any &#39;mysticism&#39; there. \nPractice makes perfect is a western expression as well.\n\n&gt;We in the knitter&#39;s realm have a concept of yarn &#39;telling us what it wants to be&#39;  \n&gt;such that we say the yarn &#39;speaks to us&#39;.  Other knitters I know scoff at us \n&gt;about &#39;mysticism&#39;, and proceed to knit with yarn obviously unsuited to their \n&gt;project and they are wailing and complaining about a &#39;troublesome project&#39;.  \n&gt;They wonder at how others of us can &#39;make it look so easy&#39;.  I try to \n&gt;describe the way I personally &#39;hear&#39; my yarn or fabric is not in words per \n&gt;se, but in a mind-full picture conjured by that store of impressions already \n&gt;there.  If the needle size is wrong for the yarn, it will appear to &#39;fight&#39; \n&gt;being knit.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nKnowing tools and materials is part of being a craftsman. I don&#39;t think \nthat&#39;s &#39;mystic&#39;. I don&#39;t percieve my materials as speaking to me though. \nI just know, this paper is heavy and has lots of sizing, I must use lots \nof dark ink. This paper is light and unsized, I must work fast and \nlightly. If I&#39;m working in metal, plastic or wood, I&#39;ve worked enough \nwith them to know how they respond to the tools and the right tools to use.\n\n&gt;Persons who \n&gt;develop several avenues of pursuit get better at amalgamating information \n&gt;and perceptions of those arts into a cohesiveness, a &#39;way&#39; of responding to \n&gt;their environment that to others can seem a bit unreal, but it is not.  It \n&gt;is simply being and staying aware and responsive to the cues given by one&#39;s \n&gt;environment.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMaybe if the explanation is too &#39;mystic&#39; the person&#39;s BS detector fires off.\n\n&gt;What do my previous words have to do with swords that seem to &#39;speak&#39;?\n&gt;\n&gt;I think it has more to do with the person who is handling the sword, than it \n&gt;does with the sword itself.  I think it is that awareness, that catalog of \n&gt;physical and visual impressions gathered over time, and the ability to allow \n&gt;one&#39;s mind to create a meaningful picture.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOnce again, if the phrases used are a bit on the spacey side, my mind \nhas a tendency to scream poppycock! Part of the problem of being trained \nto be pragmatic, analytical and practical from an early age. My mother \nwas an artist, but she could also fix the car and the refrigerator. \nPractice, tools, and technique, and if your lucky a bit of art as well.\n\nHopelessly literal-minded,\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
