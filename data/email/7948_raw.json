Musashi employed them (from what\nwe read), such as arriving early and =\r\nwaiting in ambush, arriving late,\netc.\n\nOther swordsmen used similar techni=\r\nques - Nobutsuna Kamiizumi once\nasked an opponent to wait until a student h=\r\nad arrived.\n\nToda Seigan faced an opponent with a bokken, so the man put aw=\r\nay his\nsword and used a bokken too, not to be out-done. Seigan then put dow=\r\nn\nthe bokken and picked up a stick.\n\nI have read somewhere that there is a =\r\nview that Musashi had his\nstudents waiting in hiding on the island, and it =\r\nwas they who ambushed\nand killed Kojiro.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
