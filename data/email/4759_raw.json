I&#39;ve been searching around, but cant really find any info on \n&gt;Fusaie or why he also held the title.  anyone know?\n\nAs others have mentioned there were plenty of people who held \nthe title of Kanpaku. There were something like 150 who held \nthe title Kanpaku - and another 50 or so who held the title \nSesshou. The difference between the two titles is that the Kanpaku \n&quot;advised&quot; an adult emperor but a Sesshou &quot;advised&quot; an emperor who \nhad not yet come of age.\n\nI looked up Ichijo Fusaie. It appears that there were 31 members of \nthe Ichijo family who held the post of Kanpaku or Sesshou. I can&#39;t \nfind a person named Fusaie on the list. Not to say it didn&#39;t happen - \nbut I haven&#39;t been able to confirm it for myself after some looking.\n\nIchjijo Fusaie \u001b$B0l&gt;rK&lt;2H\u001b(B lived from 1475-1539. His farther Norifusa \u001b$B65\u001b(B\n\u001b$BK&lt;\u001b(B was Kanpaku between 1458-1463. His son Fusamichi \u001b$BK&lt;F;\u001b(B was Kanpaku \nbetween 1545-1548. But it looks like Fusaie himself never held the \npost.\n\nFor quick reference I used this site:\nhttp://homepage1.nifty.com/gyouseinet/history/sekkanTaiin.htm\n\nHere&#39;s another list - I didn&#39;t compare the two but Fusaie doesn&#39;t \nappear on either of them:\nhttp://nekhet.ddo.jp/ruler/japan/sekkan.html\n\nHere is a timeline that includes some information about Fusaie \nhimself:\nhttp://nx.sakura.ne.jp/~gumi/sengoku/ichijyo/tosanenpu.htm\n\nIt looks like his highest rank was &quot;Ken-Dainagon&quot;\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
