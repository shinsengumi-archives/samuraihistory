You truly have a treasure in=\r\n\nyour \n      possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it\n=\r\n      professionally \n      cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that cur=\r\nrently exist on the\n    blade\n\n      mean little in comparison to the blade=\r\n itself.  If you do manage\nto\n    get\n      it \n      cleaned and polished =\r\nyou should also get it placed into a\nShirasaya.\n        Bear in mind that t=\r\nhis is not a cheap or fast process.\n  Professional\n\n      polishers are ver=\r\ny backlogged and very expensive.  It could take\ntwo\n      years \n      and =\r\n$2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It\nwill\n      keep=\r\n \n      any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.\n     =\r\n   I hope this helped you.\n\n\n      Peace,\n\n      Matt\n\n      ______________=\r\n___________________________________________________\n      The new MSN 8: sm=\r\nart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \n      http://join.msn.com/?page=3D=\r\nfeatures/junkmail\n\n\n\n      Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.co=\r\nm\n      ---\n      To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n      s=\r\namuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n      Your use of Yahoo!
