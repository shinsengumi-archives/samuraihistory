I know the VHS version exists (but for \naround 79.00).  I think it was at Amazon.com but I&#39;m probably wrong.  Good \nluck searching.\n\nChuck\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Scott &lt;scottc_4@...&gt;&quot; &lt;scottc_4@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Help with a Movie title\n&gt;Date: Thu, 06 Feb 2003 23:59:49 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;Awhile back I saw a movie that I saw was entitled Heaven and\n&gt;Earth on TV.  Basically, and breifly it is a fairly recent samurai\n&gt;movie that is in part based on the struggles between Takeda\n&gt;Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin.  I taped it, and really enjoy it.  I am\n&gt;now looking for it on DVD, but cannot find it under Heaven and\n&gt;Earth, all I get is the Oliver Stone one.  I remeber a while back on\n&gt;here someone metioning it by a different title.  If anyone knows it\n&gt;please help.  Thanks\n&gt;\n;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n\n"
