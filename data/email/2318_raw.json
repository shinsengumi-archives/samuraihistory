I would be a\ntad suspicious of most of those family trees. I have heard of many\ninconsistencies and unresolved questions; for example; the mother of\nTokugawa Iesada-some people claim she was on orphan found on the street.\nRemember most of these were compiled in the 17th century. Some were doctored\nto create enhanced lineages to famous Samurai. Its not hard to believe,\nbefore the event of modern genealogy, that some where slapped together\nwithout being too careful of the facts. while others might have been\ndeliberately changed either to hide a skeleton in the closet (or take one\nout in the case of the enemy.)\n\n\n"
