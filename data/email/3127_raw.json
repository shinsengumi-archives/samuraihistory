Pretty much the\ntwo are very much intertwined and your ancestors were\nonce retainers to the Shimazu. The Kyushu Samurai was\na very fearsome, brave and honorable warrior. Notable\nexamples being the Shimazu of Satsuma, the Ryuzoji and\nNabeshima of Hizen.\n\nThe Satsuma samurai proved themselves in battles\nacross Kyushu, Korea and Sekigahara. At Sekigahara the\nSatsuma samurai were on the Toyotomi side. Though\ndefeated their Daimyo, Shimazu Yoshihiro ordered a\ncharge straight through the enemy center. Breaking\nthrough the Satsuma Samurai were able to retreat and\nmake it back to Kyushu. Observing this the Tokugawa\ngenerals were dumbfounded. Tokugawa Ieyasu just shook\nhis head and said &quot;only a Satsuma samurai would\nretreat by attacking and that they may have lost the\nbattle but not their courage&quot;. This would later be\nknown as Shimazu no nokiguchi or Shimazu style\nretreat.\n\nThere are many examples of their courge and tenacity\nin the face of ovewhelming odds. Being defeated only\nby Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1587 and Tokugawa Ieyasu in\n1600. Each time the Satsuma samurai impressed their\nenemies greatly with their courage and honor.\n\nSuggested research: Shimazu Takahisa, Shimazu\nYoshihisa, Shimazu Yoshihiro, and Shimazu Iehisa\n\nalso notable vassal families: Iriki-in, Togo, Niiro,\nIjuin, Hongo, Kiire, Hirada, Machida, Uwai,\nTamegashima, Kawakami, Kimotsuki, Honda\n\nThere is alot more info out there and I have only\nscratched the surface. I hope I was of some help.\n\nGood luck in your research and please share anything\nyou find. I&#39;ll be more than happy to share what I\ndiscover.\n\nOne day I wouldn&#39;t mind sharing my Grandfathers story.\nBut not today.\n\nWell I&#39;ve babbled enough.\n\nJake \n--- Rob &lt;zarathu_stra@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;d like to know a bit about Satsuma\n&gt; region as well for personal reasons. My name is\n&gt; Robert Omura. My grandfather was Kenji Omura who\n&gt; came from the Kagoshima region of Japan and came to\n&gt; Canada in the early 20th C. He was the eldest son of\n&gt; a samurai family. I never knew my grandfather as he\n&gt; died in an internment camp in British Columbia.\n&gt; Before WWII my grandfather held title to property\n&gt; from Vancouver to Montreal, but these were\n&gt; confiscated and sold to Veterans Affairs during the\n&gt; war. My father, who was born in Canada, inherited\n&gt; his estate years ago, and was contacted in the late\n&gt; 1970&#39;s by his cousin there and, because he had never\n&gt; been to Japan, he transferred title to the lands to\n&gt; his cousin. These were in the Kagoshima area. I\n&gt; understand that he was adopted to the Watabe family\n&gt; as a child, but changed his name back to Omura. I am\n&gt; told that my great-grandfather was asked to move to\n&gt; the capital to run the Japanese tax system -- late\n&gt; Meiji period, but refused. I also\n&gt;  understand that the records are largely complete in\n&gt; Kagoshima, having been largely spared by the war.\n&gt; Any hints or suggestions on tracking more\n&gt; information would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; jacob gerhard &lt;madbearscave@...&gt; wrote:Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; My name is Jake.

I have a intrest in the\n&gt; Shimazu\n&gt; Clan of Satsuma province. I was told that Satsuma\n&gt; produced some of the most fearsome No-dachi samurai.\n&gt; Is there any truth to this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also were the Shimazu invovled in putting down the\n&gt; Shimabara Reblion of 1637-1638.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help on these questions will be greatly\n&gt; appreaciated as well as any other information\n&gt; regarding the Shimazu.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note: I have read the article on Shimazu Yoshihisa\n&gt; and\n&gt; Iriki-In Shigetomo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jake\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
