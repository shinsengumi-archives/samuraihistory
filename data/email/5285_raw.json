I then tried pasting Jay&#39;s email with its sample text in to\nOutlook Express just in case it was an issue with Turnpike, again no\njoy, however...\n\nI noticed that when Turnpike displayed Jay&#39;s message, it offered me the\noption of selecting a different mode of &quot;Viewer&quot;. The default option was\nInternet Exploder, so off I went, and hey presto, a little line of\nhiragana. I assume Jay that&#39;s what you actually sent me?\n\nNate continued:\n&gt;    If they aren&#39;t on the &quot;more&quot; window, then you&#39;ll have\n&gt;    to go to your control panel. \n\nAs the above solution is not totally ideal, I decided to go wandering\nthrough the Control Panel, where I found Regional and Language options.\nI attempted to set it up for Japanese. The files were already on my hard\ndrive (requested when I bought the machine), so I went into Advanced and\ndid the deed. I then had to undo it as some very strange things happened\nto all my other programs. For example on the address bar of &quot;My\nDocuments&quot;, the back slashes were replaced with the symbol for yen! Of\ncourse this could be perfectly normal, but being a bit twitchy where\ncomputing is concerned, I went in to reverse gear.\n\nAnyway, everything is now back to what passes for normal around here,\nand with a stroke of a key I can read kana. Jay or Nate, could you send\nme some kanji so I can confirm that the system can in fact cope.\n\nH&#39;mm, now what about writing in Japanese..? Arghhh....:-)\n\nCheers for all the help.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n\n\n"
