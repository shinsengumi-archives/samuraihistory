But just\nthe characther do means that those arts are non\nmartial.   Besides,I think that nowdays is very hard\nif not imposible to find an individual who really\nlives the concept of Bushido as a samurai will do.   \nSpecially because I do not think that Bushido lives\nnowdays as it lived 200 or 300 years ago.   I do not\nwant to say if this is sad or not here, but this\nhappens just because it is insane to compare Japan now\nwith the Japan of 300 years ago.   Perhaps japanese\ncould think in the same way, but want keeps them\nrolling and living now is simply different than the\ncircumstances of 300 years ago.   \nAnd please notice that I am talking about japanese\npeople, that is because we supouse that they now more\nabout this form of life than anyone else.\nSo now what can we say about western people.\n   I want to put you an exemple :   Remember this poet\nMishima ?   Well, he commit seppuku because he think\nthat the Japan he was living in was dishonorable since\nit has adopted western culture.   How did japanese\npeople, even his collegues in arms, reacted to this ? \n A  scandal... but what could be the reaction in 1870\njapanese people? \n\nBest regards.              \n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n"
