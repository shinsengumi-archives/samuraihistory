I just thought that this would be an interesting \nthought. But I actually don&#39;t believe in the story much, as some other \nperson would have come to think the core idea of the Kurama Tengu might \nhave been some caucasian, if there was any likelyness it be so. Still \nthis is funny, but sure all Tengu are folk tale originates, and aren&#39;t \nbased on *any* actual persons, and most of all *no* Greek swordsman (in \nthe 11th century or whatsoever!).\n\nThomas\n\nk kobayakawa wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Mr Rabbitry et al-\n&gt;&gt; You might want to look into the Kurama Tengu, long-nosed goblins,\n&gt;&gt; some say of Caucasian features who had special skills in\n&gt;&gt; swordsmanship and the arts of war. No one ever said they were Greek\n&gt;&gt; but long silver hair is a common description...\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Oh my.... Now some people believe Tengu is white samurai.\n&gt; Tengu was originated to Chinese folk tale.\n&gt; The first Japanese book that mentions Tengu was Nihonshoki.\n&gt; It&#39;s just an imaginary creature.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
