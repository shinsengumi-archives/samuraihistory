I tend towards \nwestern believes of good, evil and guilt and I do not find the concept \nof face as practiced by Japan to be honorable. I.E. if no one saw the \nevil deed then nothing happened.\n\nThe code of Bushido evolved after the bloody civil wars that united \nJapan. It was a method to stop the underlings from thinking about \nrevolting against their superiors.\n\nI will once again bow to my western roots and state that I find the \nwestern concept of chivalric knight to be much more honorable.\n\nThe books and topics recommended are all good ones, get thee to a library!\n\nJim\n\n&gt;many samurai were crood and many were not ,time has\n&gt;offered us the power status of which a samurai came to\n&gt;be known but verious times shown those like kings over\n&gt;knights have not kept their vow and those that have\n&gt;made it their virtue in keeping their credit between\n&gt;them and the heavens and in turn those are the true\n&gt;samurai whom have done for a master intuition of\n&gt;gaining their keep sake untel they could survive on\n&gt;their own terms ,like holding a job against our\n&gt;beliefs long enough to earn what we feel we need to go\n&gt;are own way ,and to this is what many have done to\n&gt;keep a vow and some who left their master made groups\n&gt;of their own but many vannish like ghosts to be with\n&gt;the earth as their sword being their own master and\n&gt;were forgotten or sought out by their masters army.\n&gt;and those that were forgotten are the true keepers of\n&gt;the samurai way.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
