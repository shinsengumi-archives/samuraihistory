Though, I must say that I am no &#39;authority&#39; yet\nand still an undergaduate.\n\n&gt; 3) How has the useage/meaning of the terms bushido\n&gt; and samurai \n&gt; changed over the years since Nitobe Inazo\n&gt; popularized them in 1900?  \n\nWorld War II, or the Pacific War (if you prefer).\nPerhaps the meaning of the terms didn&#39;t change, but\nthe popular image was certainly damaged for a time.\nYou should especially look into the use of bushido in\nthe militant policy of State Shinto and its\nramifications during the war and the questions the\nJapanese were forced to ask themselves afterwards.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Why do samurai retain such a hold on the popular\n&gt; imagination?\n\nThe Japanese in recent decades have been increasingly\nattracted to a feeling of nostalgia that recalls the\n&#39;better days&#39; when life was simple. In modern Japan\nthe fast paced lifestyle most are forced to lead seems\nto be causing some discontent and longing for the\n&#39;furusato&#39;, homeland of their forefathers. This is of\ncourse an idealized homeland and often seems to refer\nto agricultural Tokugawa villages. This is often\nexpressed in enka music and I recommend the book by\nChristine Yano, &quot;Tears of Longing&quot; on the subject.\nThis nostalgic desire though does explain some of the\nfascination with samurai/bushido that survives in pop\nculture. \n\nThese might be a few directions to look into, if I\nthink of anything else I&#39;know!\n\n-J.Salvador\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!\nhttp://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/\n\n"
