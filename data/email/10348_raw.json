That&#39;s fine I guess- I&#39;m a budding writer and you need to\nknow the good things to, but for the life of me I can&#39;t find the appropriate\nlist of matching Sins.\n&gt;\n&gt; Christianity as a whole has Sins and Virtues, as do most religions and\ncultures in the world. They always come as a matching pair. So if Samurai\nhave Virtues based on Bushido and the like, it would stand to reason they\nhave Sins, too. But I can&#39;t find them.\n&gt;\n&gt; So...do they exist, and I&#39;m just missing them? If so, does anybody know\nwhat they are?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Join the 2007 Samurai Fiction Contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.htmlYahoo!
