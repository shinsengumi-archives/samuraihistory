Too\nstrong of a &quot;national&quot; movement (in the sense of it\nbeing spread throughout the populace almost\nnationwide, rather than being a political force in the\n&quot;national&quot; capital), I think. \n\n  That being the\n&gt; case, they {the Enryakuji, et al} are as \n&gt; much an impediment to one uniting the country as an\n&gt; enemy daimyo.\n\nHence their destruction at the hands of Nobunaga.\nWhile most still held some respect for their religious\nposition, Nobunaga simply saw them as an impediment to\npolitical consolidation (under himself, of course!). \n\n  In \n&gt; which case you either work with them or against\n&gt; them. And what \n&gt; would &quot;working with them&quot; entail?\n\nGood question. Um...most likely, confirming their land\nholdings, possibly/probably giving them more, and\ntrying to convince them to at least not attack you\nfrom behind, if not help against your enemies. Same\nthings you do to get another daimyo on your\nside--convince him helping you is to his advantage\nwith land and stuff. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; But all that is just a side question/comment to the\n&gt; original - which \n&gt; was what would the most likely event be if someone\n&gt; else not as \n&gt; completely and utterly iron fisted against the Ikko\n&gt; Ikki et all as \n&gt; Nobunaga had tried to unify the country.  Nobunaga\n&gt; didnt stop at \n&gt; Enryakuji, it was policy for his armies to slaughter\n&gt; men, women, \n&gt; children, and the old who were in any way associated\n&gt; with the ikko \n&gt; ikki fortresses he brought down.\n\nI think either someone else (Shingen?) would have\neventually been just as ruthless. Hideyoshi isn&#39;t\nplayed up as a bad guy because he wasn&#39;t nearly as\noften as Nobunaga, but he could be when he wanted to\nbe. His destruction of the Negoro-ji isn&#39;t talked\nabout as much, because Nobunaga already set the\nprecedent and took the heat. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
