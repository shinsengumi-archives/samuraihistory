Unlike its better known counterpart, the medieval armor, the \nJapanese example was much lighter, which provided for ease of \nmovement but compromised protection. The armor had to be light weight \nbecause the Samurai would often engage into hand to hand combat, \nrequiring fast and precise movements. ***The majority of the armor \nwas made from bamboo***.&quot; (asterisks are my addition).\n\nDon&#39;t you just love the internet...\n\n&gt; It was definitely a weapon. The thing is, as you suggest, was it an\n&gt; *efficient* weapon? It clearly could be a devastating one, but it \nwould be\n&gt; one hard to wield and control. Swords and lances made for much \nbetter\n&gt; infantry weapons. Otherwise *all* our infantrymen might be carrying \nbazookas\n&gt; instead of M-16s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n"
