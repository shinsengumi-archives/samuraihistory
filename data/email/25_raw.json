They are even believed to have saild 6 Iron clad ships against the\nMori in a sea battle in the Bay of Osaka or Kobe.\n\nWhat do you have on the Japanese naval side of the Korea campaign ? I am\nvery interested in that campaign and have dug up a fair amount on the land\naction from both sides and also quite a lot on the naval campaign, but only\nfrom Korean point of view.\n\nGreetings\nKarl Heinz\n\n\n\n\n"
