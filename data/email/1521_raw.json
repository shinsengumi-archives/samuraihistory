Of course one must study Shinto \nand Confucius as well.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Interi98 &lt;interi98@...&gt;&quot; &lt;interi98@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;I would really like to read your impressions on this.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAs you pointed out, Bushido is a modern concept. Before the Edo period, \nthere really wasn&#39;t such a concept. One of the reasons it came about is \nto convince the underlings not to revolt against their superiors. The \nSengoku period could easily be termed &quot;the age of treachery&quot; with out \ntoo much inaccuracy.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Interi98 &lt;interi98@...&gt;&quot; &lt;interi98@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;There is a book comparing bushido with chivalry:\n&gt;&quot;A Comparison of Bushi-Do and Chivalry&quot;\n&gt;by Takeshi Takagi\n&gt;translated by Tsuneyoshi Matsuno\n&gt;This book was written in 1914, but the translation was published 1984 \n&gt;in Osaka: TM International Academy.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;ll have to look for that! Sounds interesting. Though sadly none of the \nlocal libraries seem to have it in their normal collections.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Knights vs. Samurai ideals\n&gt;\n&gt;James Eckman wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Have you gotten to the ones where they would wrapt them up in straw bales yet?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo, mostly they are just pouring boiling water and staking them out at \nlow tide. It&#39;s supposed to get a bit nastier later on. I&#39;m pretty sure \nEndo-sensei didn&#39;t write a single happy book. Of course I&#39;m American, so \nI like heros and happy endings. Something hard to find in most other \ncultures writings. For those on the list interested in historical \nfiction, he also wrote a book called Samurai which is a story about some \nlow level flunkies sent to Mexico and then Rome to negotiate treaties \nfor their lord. I think this one and Chinmoku have English editions. He \nwas at one time considered for the Nobel Prize.\n\n&gt;   From: jonathan lee &lt;shinobij@...&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m new to this group and fairly ignorant when it comes to the subject of samurai, but what i kow i find facinating and i&#39;m dying (not literally) to know more. Therefore i would appreciate it if ayone could recommend any websites books etc.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFor websites, use Google. Type in samurai, sengoku, daimyo, etc. and be \nprepared to burn lots of time. You could also buy some of Stephen \nTurnbull&#39;s or Tony Bryant&#39;s books on the subject ;)\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
