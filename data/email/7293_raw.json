Japan. 2005. 119mins.\n\nA remake of Kosei Saito&#39;s 1979 film about a military\nSelf Defence \nForces (SDF) unit that time travels back to the days\nof the samurai, \nSamurai Commando: Mission 1549 has already attracted a\nflood of \nforeign rights offers for producer Kadokawa Pictures.\nConcluded \ndeals totalled 31 at last count - a new record for a\nlive-action \nJapanese film.\n\nWhat director Masaaki Tezuka (Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.)\ndelivers on \nthe screen is not the camp-fest implied in the title,\nbut a Japanese \nequivalent of Independence Day: full-bore,\nstraight-ahead SF action \nwith a nationalistic slant. Also, much of the $15m\nbudget has gone \nto effects that may be more 1996 than 2005 but are\nstill of-the-line \nfor a Japanese release.\n\nSamurai Commando has become a solid hit in Japan\nfollowing its June \n1 release, and internationally looks likely to draw\nthe same teenage \nmales who thrilled to The Last Samurai (if not the\nwomen who \nthrilled to Tom Cruise). Success, though, will depend\non how much \nthe international version also commissioned by\nKadokawa, with its \npumped-up effects and soundtrack, can reduce the\noriginal film&#39;s \ncheese factor.\n\nThe action starts with a top-secret test of a new\nmagnetic shield - \nand a blunder by the second lieutenant in charge, one\nRei Kanzaki \n(Kyoka Suzuki) that sends an SDF unit reeling back in\ntime.\n\nThe SDF brass covers up the incident, but two years\nlater the space-\ntime continuum begins to warp - and they decide to\ndispatch a squad, \ncoded named Romeo, into the year 1549. Their mission:\nrescue the \nmissing soldiers - and save Japan (not to mention the\nSolar System) \nfrom being sucked into the void.\n\nSquad leader Kashima (Yosuke Eguchi) is a reluctant\nwarrior, as is \nhis second in command, the stern-visaged Kanzaki. But\nwhen they \nfinally travel back to 1549 they discover that the\nunit leader, \nColonel Matoba (Takeshi Kaga), has assumed the\nidentity of a famous \nwarlord - and is planning to fast-forward Japan to\nworld power \nstatus with the aid of a city-obliterating secret\nweapon.\n\nMade with the co-operation of the SDF, Samurai\nCommando offers all \nthe money shots of helicopters, tanks, and other\nhardware that \nmilitary buffs, not to mention SDF recruiters, could\ndesire.\n\nIt also skips boring exposition, plunging immediately\ninto the \naction. Wave after wave of samurai are blasted to\nwrithing \nsmithereens by modern firepower - but the survivors\ncharge on \nregardless. Meanwhile, the SDF troops take their share\nof deadly, \nrealistically rendered CG arrows.\n\nThere are other neat effects, such as the SDF unit and\nall its \nhardware being whirled into the past like Dorothy&#39;s\nhouse in The \nWizard Of Oz. But they cannot disguise Tezuka&#39;s\npedestrian direction \nand the lack of emotional range, beyond grim\ndetermination.\n\nInstead of expressing awe and astonishment at the\nsudden appearance \nof 21st century technology in their midst, Tezuka&#39;s\nsamurai \nimmediately and mindlessly go on the attack, like bad\nguys in a \ncomputer game.\n\nMeanwhile, the SDF heroes barely notice their\nfeudal-era \nsurroundings; they are like Japanese salarymen sent on\nbusiness to a \ndangerous Third World country, whose only thought is\nto make it back \nto the airport intact and on time.\n\nAmong the standouts in the main cast is Kazuki\nKitamura, playing a \nsamurai who time travels in the opposite direction and\nbecomes a \nRomeo ally. After a long slog through the\nstraight-to-video \nunderworld, Kitamura finally has a mainstream platform\nfor his \nBrando-ish looks, presence and acting chops. And his\nsword-fighting \nskills are superb. Watch your back Ken Watanabe - you\nmay not be the \nlast samurai after all.\n\nProduction companies\nKadokawa Pictures\nNTV\nNihon Eiga Fund\n\nInternational sales\nKadokawa Pictures\n\nJapanese distribution\nToho\n\nExecutive producer\nKazuo Kuroi\n\nAssociate producers\nNaoki Sato\nChiharu Akiba\nIkio Nabeshima\n\nCinematography\nShun Fujiishi\n\nScreenplay\nKiyohito Takeuchi\nYasushi Matsuura\n\nEditor\nShinichi Katajima\n\nProduction design\nTakeshi Shimizu\n\nSpecial effects supervisor\nKatsuhiro Inoue\n\nMusic\nshezoo\n\nMain cast\nYosuke Eguchi\nKyoka Suzuki\nTakeshi Kaga\nKazuki Kitamura\nHaruka Ayase\n \n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n    \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
