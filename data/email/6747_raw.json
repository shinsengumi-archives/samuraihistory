However, that&#39;s fairly obscure, and I don&#39;t\n&gt; think I&#39;ve ever seen it in the context presented. \n\n   The wonders of online dictionaries like EDICT is that it allows \nanyone with even rudimentary surfing skills to stumble upon out of \ncontext obscure terms in languages they know little to nothing about. \nThey then usually proceed to use those as is in an extraordinary display \nof linguistic butchery instead of checking, so I think the original \nposter here deserves credit for not just assuming his search yielded the \ncorrect term.\n\n[Uji --&gt; 氏]\n&gt; This is the &quot;uji&quot; I listed--I posted in Shift JIS, so\n&gt; I apologize if you didn&#39;t see it. By itself, it can be\n&gt; used to mean &quot;the clan&quot;.\n\n   I really like Thunderbird, but it does seem to be a bit hit or miss \nwhen it comes to interpreting the correct encoding correctly, so I \ndidn&#39;t see it at first. (I knew which kanji you meant anyway, I simply \nre-listed it in my reply for the sake of completeness.)\n\n   However, the only times I remember coming across &quot;uji&quot; by itself is \nin texts about the Ritsuryō system or earlier periods, which precede \nsamurai history proper by a few centuries.\n\n   As for the choice of UTF-8, since you asked about it so nicely in \nanother reply, my main reason for that is that in addition to English, I \nalso use French and Japanese, and the letters with macrons from the \nextended character set, fairly regularly, and Unicode handles the \ncombined use of both better than other encoding schemes. My second \nchoice, if I&#39;m not using macrons or other accented characters but am \nincluding both English and Japanese, is ISO-2022-JP rather than \nShift-JIS; that last I use only for reading what other people send in \nthat encoding. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
