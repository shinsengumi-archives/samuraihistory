That&#39;s fine I guess- I&#39;m a budding writer and you need to know the =\r\ngood things to, but for the life of me I can&#39;t find the appropriate list of=\r\n matching Sins.\n&gt; \n&gt; Christianity as a whole has Sins and Virtues, as do mo=\r\nst religions and cultures in the world. They always come as a matching pair=\r\n. So if Samurai have Virtues based on Bushido and the like, it would stand =\r\nto reason they have Sins, too. But I can&#39;t find them.\n&gt; \n&gt; So...do they exi=\r\nst, and I&#39;m just missing them? If so, does anybody know what they are?\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\nSetting aside the debate about whether Samurai ever really &quot;followed Bushid=\r\no&quot; for a moment - take whatever virtues you&#39;ve found, and wouldn&#39;t the oppo=\r\nsite be the &quot;sin&quot;?  I don&#39;t think &quot;sin&quot; in a secular medieval Japanese cont=\r\next is the right word though - not to mention, Bushido is definitely not a =\r\nreligion, although the impression I get is that some modern Western martial=\r\n artists will little knowledge of Japanese history treat it like it is.\n\n\n"
