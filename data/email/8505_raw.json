Nitta Yoshisada (1301 - 1338) managed to cut off his own head and bury it!\n\n&quot;Even if one&#39;s head were to be suddenly cut off, he should be able to do one more action with certainty. The last moments of Nitta Yoshisada are proof of this. Had his spirit been weak, he would have have fallen the moment his head was severed.&quot;\nHagakure\n\nA curiousity - especially as he was attending a family BBQ at the time ... no, that&#39;s a fib, but imagine!
