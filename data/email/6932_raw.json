How\ncould a ninja deisguise himself as a samurai if he was\ncarrying a straigth sword.\n\nNinja carried curved swords just like samurai\n\npaul\n\n\n--- Patrick Vetrano &lt;ninja_20049@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\n\nHello Thomas, \n \nthank you for discussing this issue with me although i\nam no expert swords smith, the main point i was trying\nto make was that the samurai sword was curved for a\nreason, not by accident. infact i dont know if i\nmentioned this before, but that is probly why the\nNinja were far worse at sword fighting then the\nsamurai that is why i think they always had to be\nstealth.(as an advantage in fighting). look foward to\nseeing your reply and opinion on my opinion and one of\nthe things my friends and I have wondered for a while\nnow.\n \n                                                      \n                                             thanks a\nbunch.\n                                                      \n                                                      \nlater!\n\n\n\n            \n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
