I have a Wak which is very heavy.  It has been put \nin some made up carved wooden mounts for the tourist market in about \n1900.  I am about to clean the blade and add lemon juice but I don&#39;t \nthink a hamon will be visible as its condition is quite bad.  It has \nno signiture and might be from the 19th/18th century as it&#39;s blade is \nbroader than a Koto blade.  Did the Eta Hinin executioners use extra \nheavy Waks for the job?  I am puzzled as this Wak seems very heavy \nbut doesn&#39;t seem to give any clues as to its origin or period, not to \na novice like myself anyway.  Can anyone help?  There is only on hole \nin the tang and there are file marks going diagonaly across the tang \nfrom the back of the tang towards the blade edge (suji-chigai).  The \nblade lenght is 16 and a half inches (21 and a quater from Kisaki to \nthe Kata-yamagata). Shinogi-zukuri.  No grain is visible.  Anyone \nhelp please!\nRegards,\nChris\n\n\n\n"
