For example, my name is Angus Haynes. Haynes is a\nderivitive of the German word Hain, meaning a forest or Grove, while\nAngus, as best I can tell from a quick Google search, is Gaelic for\n&#39;unique&#39;.\n \nSo using a little creativity, as well as Tony&#39;s excellent page on\nJapanese names on his &#39;Online Japanese Miscellany&#39; website, I came up\nwith my &#39;samurai name&#39; of Mori Kazumoto (Mori = forest, Kazu = first,\nMoto = origin). Of course, it&#39;s not really *your name* in kanji, as you\ncan&#39;t really translate it back if you don&#39;t know the original name...\nbut hey, it&#39;s a bit of fun!\n \nAngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
