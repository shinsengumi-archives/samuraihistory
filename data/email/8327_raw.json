In an attempt to widen the viewer \nbase, NHK used pop stars instead of traditional actors in at least one of \nthe roles and &quot;modified&quot; accepted history. This did have the desired effect \nof increasing viewers, but there was an uproar among japanese historians \nover the actual content.\n\nM.J.Peters\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve just bought taiga drama - Shinsengumi VCDs, however the VCDs haven&#39;t\n&gt;arrived yet. I am wondering if anyone here has seen this drama, then I need\n&gt;their opinion about this drama particularly about the historical events in\n&gt;this drama, are they accurate enough or not? as it&#39;s said that the drama\n&gt;depicts the historical events during the Tokugawa era started from 1854 -\n&gt;\n&gt;Totok Sudarijanto\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n\n"
