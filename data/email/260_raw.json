In all \nmy years of reading and studying Japanese Samurai history, I have \nNEVER come accross anything even remotely resembling &#39;a group of \nsamurai practicing karate together in a dojo&#39; (quote is my own).  I \nhave never seen any references to unarmed combat training, and don&#39;t \nsee much use for it anyway.  The samurai studied weapons, which is \ncommon sense, of course.  I don&#39;t believe (and this is opinion) that \neven &#39;powerful samurai families&#39; employed &#39;martial artists&#39; to teach \nthem unarmed combat.  from my limited (6 years of martial arts \ntraining about 10 years ago or so - and my studying of martial arts \nhistory) is that unarmed combat originated in Okinawa, and at best \n200 - 300 years ago.  I&#39;m sure that judo or jujitsu-like &#39;wrestling&#39; \nprobably existed, but I doubt that Takeda Shingen or Oda Nobunaga \nhired martial arts experts to train there armies in the way of \nunarmed combat.  I would hazzard to guess based on what I&#39;ve read \n(and thus on what I &#39;haven&#39;t&#39; come accross) that mass training for \nthe armies wasn&#39;t too common - even weapons training.  most ashigaru \nprobably went out and cut themselves a bamboo spear and just charged \ninto battle hoping for the best.  I would assume that any martial \ntraining with weapons was done on one&#39;s own, and not through \na &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or closest to the lord, \nwho would receive sword training.  Anyway, my point is that I&#39;ve \nnever seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts training in \nthe &#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books.  At best the subject comes up \nin the VERY questionable &#39;martial arts history books&#39;.  If someone \nhas info on martial arts training from a &#39;reputable source&#39; PLEASE \nrespond to this post.  I am curious about this simply because it is \nnot something covered by Hall, Varley, Sansom, Berry, or the others.\n\n\n\n"
