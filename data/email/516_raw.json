(one the same \nsize as the man holding it!) \n Check out; www.bunbun.ne.jp/~sword/Nkage1.html\n The site is run by Colin Hyakutake, a practitioner of both the Kage ryu and \nthe Hyoho Niten Ichi Ryu (The school that Miyamoto Musashi was Ryuso or \nfounder of). And is an excellent place for information on these and other \n&#39;Ken&#39; related questions.\n Hope this helps.\n Abayo.\n Ben Sharples.\n\n"
