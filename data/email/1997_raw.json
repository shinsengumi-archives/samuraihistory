Usually consisting of the master and a few\nstudents. A really large operation might also include a few flunkies. I\ndo not know of the place you seek but it may be in Taiwan or really just\nsome sort of modern knife factory. Someone on this group might be able to\ndirect you to someone that could get you in to see some modern\nswordsmithing operation like Yoshindo Yoshihara in Tokyo. Or perhaps one\nof the other toko working in the area. There are quite a few in the Tokyo\narea. Do be sure to go to the Japanese sword museum or Nihonto\nHakobutsukan and the Tokyo National Museum while there. They are terrific\nfor viewing the best in japanese swords and art. Also a place called Aoi\nart is right around the corner from the Sword museum it is a sword shop.\nThey have a web site www.aoi-art.ab.psiweb.com/index.html they are\nretailers but may be able to arrange a tour for you.\n     Hope you enjoy your trip. It is a great place to go.\nTom Armour \n\n________________________________________________________________\nThe best thing to hit the internet in years - Juno SpeedBand!\nSurf the web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!\nOnly $14.95/ month - visit www.juno.com to sign up today!\n\n"
