Sadly many \ngreat temples and shrines are reduced to just the ma=\r\nin buildings on \ntracts just big enough to hold them...\n-t\n\n&gt;  Yes it makes=\r\n absolute sense. If you were to read Turnbulls text that \n&gt; goes\n&gt;  with th=\r\ne map it would be more clear as to why I was confused. He \n&gt; states\n&gt;  that=\r\n the Byou-dou-in lies between Nara and the Uji bridge. Which is \n&gt; true,\n&gt; =\r\n but looking at the map you would think that it was located somewhere \n&gt; al=\r\nong\n&gt;  the road running south from the bridge. Thats why the rest of his\n&gt; =\r\n description of the battle was hard to follow. You would never know \n&gt; that=\r\n the\n&gt;  building was within view of the bridge.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Cheers\n&gt;  Bill &quot;The cr=\r\neativity never stops&quot; M.\n&gt;  :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;  Original Message:\n&gt;  -----------------=\r\n\n&gt;  From: Oyakata oyakata@...\n&gt;  Date: Fri, 25 Jun 2004 22:09:4=\r\n2 -0400\n&gt;  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [samuraihisto=\r\nry] Attn: Jay and Cesare\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  On Fri, 25 Jun 2004 12:35:05 -0000, Bill M.=\r\n=1B$B$5$s=1B(B wrote in message\n&gt;  &lt;cbh65p+6icl@...&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Gents,\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I just uploaded the map from Turnbull. It is in the files section in\n=\r\n&gt;  &gt;a folder called Bill M. Creative ain&#39;t I! :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;  A wonderful piece of=\r\n brainstorming. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;If anybody can mark on the map where the Byodo-in =\r\nis I wouls be\n&gt;  &gt;greatly pleased. Any other details you can add would be g=\r\nreat as \n&gt; well!\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think I see one potential problem. The Turnbull map=\r\n is a much larger\n&gt;  scale than the maps I&#39;ve been linking to. The map from=\r\n the book is\n&gt;  indeed oriented the same way - North is up. But the scal is=\r\n so much\n&gt;  larger, that Uji appears as just a dot. The maps that I&#39;ve link=\r\ned to\n&gt;  recently basically show &quot;inside the dot&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  If a person were to=\r\n mark where the Byou-dou-in is on that Turnbull\n&gt;  map, it would just be a =\r\ntiny dot inside the circle that is marked\n&gt;  Uji.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Does that make sense=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt;  By the way thanks for going to the effort to scan the map. It makes\n=\r\n&gt;  the conversation much easier!\n&gt;\n&gt;  --\n&gt;  Jay Kelly\n&gt;  oyakata@OdaNobunag=\r\na.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  ---\n&gt;  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;  =\r\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;  ---\n&gt;  =\r\nYahoo!
