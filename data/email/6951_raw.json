This year marks the 150-year anniversary of Manjiro&#39;s \nlanding and the subsequent beginning of relations between Japan and \nthe United States.\n\nThe documentary examines Manjiro&#39;s life, as well as the political \nand social background of the drama between the newly opened Japanese \nstate under the Tokugawa Shogunate and the United States under \nAdmiral Perry. \n\nManjiro was an instrumental translator in the treaty that opened \ntrade between Japan and the United States and the West. \n\nOne of his most significant accomplishments was the translation of \nnavigation texts, used by Americans in the nineteenth century, into \nJapanese. The translation took four years to complete, and secured a \nplace in Japanese society for illiterate farmers-turned-fishermen. \n\nThe trailblazing of a relationship between Japan and the United \nStates gave Manjiro a place in the history that might have been \nforgotten, were it not brought to life through Sato&#39;s documentary. \n\nManjiro earned a position of respect in the Japanese government, \ntranslating and teaching English.\n\nSato captured the essence of Manjiro&#39;s life by explaining his story \nthrough video, documents, experts and footage of locations Manjiro \nvisited. \n\n&quot;I really like being behind the camera, instead of in front of it,&quot; \nSato said. Sato explained how she became a filmmaker after changing \nher career from broadcast journalism. \n\nSato lives in the Boston area and expects to continue to produce \ndocumentaries. Manjiro took two years and three months to complete \nand cost approximately $15,000. This film is the Sato&#39;s second and \nmost widely distributed documentary, and was brought to the UA by \nthe Japan America Society of Arkansas. \n\nThe documentary was part of the Asian Studies week, &quot;From Silk Roads \nto Crossroads.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
