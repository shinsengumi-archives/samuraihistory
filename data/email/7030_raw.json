Even if they did make her up, she&#39;s still the \n&gt;best! \n&gt;\n&gt;Any information would be greatly appreciated! Thanx again!\n&gt;\n&gt;P.S. Here&#39;s what the bio Koei made of her:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;The daughter of Tadakatsu Honda. She was adopted by Ieyasu \n&gt;Tokugawa, and married Nobuyuki Sanada (Yukimura Sanada&#39;s\n&gt;brother). \n&gt;Ina was well liked by Ieyasu Tokugawa, and she often switched \n&gt;allegiances between the Tokugawas and the Sanadas. On the eve of the \n&gt;Battle of Sekigahara, the Sanada clan was divided between Eastern \n&gt;and Western fronts. While Nobuyuki (who was allied with the \n&gt;Tokugawas) was away, Masayuki and Yukimura Sanada visited Numata \n&gt;Castle. Without opening the gates, she shot at them with her bow \n&gt;from a turret and repelled their attempted entry. However, at the \n&gt;war&#39;s conclusion, she asked Tadakatsu and Ieyasu to have mercy on \n&gt;both Masayuki and Yukimura.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nInahime (1573?- 1620) certainly existed.   Her names appears in \nhistorical sources\nas Ine, Oine, Komatsudono and Dairenin.\n\nThe bio provided by Koei and the game give you an impression that she \ntook a bow\nherself but she just ordered to attack her father-in-law&#39;s army as proxy \nfor her\nhusband.  Real Inahime seems not to be a brave archer but a lady of wisdom.\nWhen her husband (Eastern Sanada) sieged Ueda castle, where the Western \nSanada\nhad defended,  she invited the defender&#39;s families into her castle on an \nexcuse of\nprotecting  weak people and offer her hospitaility to them.  This deed \nfunctioned\nin two ways; taking hostages and decreasing casualities in divided \nSanada clan\nand its vassals.  And she was so uncompromising that she mentiond her \nthought\ndirectly even to Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Hidetada TOKUGAWA.\n\n\n*Inahime&#39;s tomb at Housenji, Sanada Town, Ueda city, Nagano pref.\n  http://www2.pf-x.net/~sanraku/shinano04/images/0014.htm\n\n*Other tomb at Shougakuji, Numata city, Nagano pref.\n  http://kotatujo.cool.ne.jp/Image/tawagoto/2005-01/P9260061.jpg\n\n*Other tomb(the right) at Shouganji, Kounosu city (where she died), \nSaitama pref.\n  http://www.geocities.jp/wind_of_hometown/image/syohgan_ji11.jpg\n\n*Reference\n  http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~jt7t-imfk/taiandir/x149.html\n \n\n\n\n\n"
