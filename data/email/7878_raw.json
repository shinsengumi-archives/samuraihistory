In fact, Balian (the Younger) was the \n &gt; legitimate son of Balian (the Elder) of Ibelin -- one of three\nbrothers \n &gt; -- and was married (quite happily) to the dowager empress of\nByzantium.\n &gt; \n &gt; (Yes, I&#39;m watching Kingdom of Heaven right now...)\n \nOh dear. I&#39;m yet to watch this but I was looking forward to hiring it\nout sometime... so much for that.
