I&#39;ll slam Hayes all day--I&#39;ve, to date, made 1\ncomment about the documentary. Did you produce this?\nYou&#39;re certainly defending it like you&#39;ve got a vested\ninterest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese\nhistory 101 and knows something now--but I&#39;m\nskeptical. \n\nIf the documentary isn&#39;t built around him, than\nlovely--hopefully it has some useful information. \n\n&gt; My I suggest if you already think its a load of crap\n&gt; before its been released that you go and produce\n&gt; something better.\n&gt; \n&gt; i await your future project on the ninja so we can\n&gt; all\n&gt; insult it\n\nIf you&#39;re willing to pay me to quit my job, fund the\nproject, and pay the production costs, I&#39;d be more\nthan happy to. Of course, it&#39;d be cheaper to just\ntranslate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then\nyou&#39;d take issue with my translation, I&#39;m sure. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
