[mailto:golfmandan@...] \nInviato: sabato 6 dicembre 2003 19.39\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: [samuraihistory] Movie Review: &#39;The Last Samurai&#39;\n\nHey Gang,\n\nThe Last Samurai is a great flick. The music and cinematography are\ngreat, and you&#39;ll enjoy \nthe performances by Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka)... and\nCruise (as Nathan \nAlgren) ain&#39;t half bad, either. \n\nYou actually won&#39;t know most of the cast unless you&#39;re really into Asian\ntheatre. Good actors, \nbut, of course, since it&#39;s set in Japan, not a lot of American actors in\nthere.\n\nIs it based on a true story? Well...sort of. The movie IS historical\nfiction, so a little history, a \nlittle (a lot) of fiction. Don&#39;t expect it to be completely true to the\nactual Satsuma Rebellion \ntimeline and history. Plus you&#39;ve got a few oddities in there, like the\nNinja attack, shuriken \na-flying and all...\n\nBut basically it gives a nice romantic portrayal of Saigo Takamori\n(Katsumoto), through the \neyes of the western observer, Nathan Algren. Action abounds, romance is\nsubtle, and \nemotional contact is good. It&#39;s a bit melodramatic at points (like\nBraveheart and The Patriot) \nbut not intolerably so. What to expect? Think &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; reset\nin 19th century \nJapan. If you liked &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot;, you&#39;ll love\n&quot;The Last Samurai&quot;\n\nBest scene: Partway through the movie, Katsumoto is with Algren in a\ntemple courtyard, \nsurrounded by blossoming cherry trees. And he tells Algren, &quot;One may\nsearch his entire life \nfor the perfect blossom, and he will not find it. But if he did find it,\nit would not be time wasted.&quot; \nSo then, towards the end of the movie, when Katsumoto lies dying, and\nhis army has fallen, he \nsees the wind blow through a blossoming cherry tree, and sweep all the\nblossoms away... he \nsees it and says, in his dying breath... &quot;Perfect&quot; - speaking not so\nmuch of the cherry \nblossoms as his samurai warriors. His army of samurai, like the bough of\ncherry blossoms, fell \nin their beautiful prime... a samurai&#39;s glory.\n\nI&#39;ll give it **** \nDo I want to see it again? &quot;Hai.&quot;\nSo grab a popcorn, a coke, a date, and a ticket (and don&#39;t forget your\nwakizashes) and have a \ngood time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
