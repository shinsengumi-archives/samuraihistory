Earliest records are in the Ak=\r\nkiadian around 4000 bc. This was a time of turmoil and expansion for the se=\r\ndentary cities of the region. There is no evidence as far as I am aware of =\r\nhumans helping one another, but the is nothing to the contrary. I refer you=\r\n to a theory a few years ago which stipulated that the mongoloid race that =\r\ncame across the Bearing strait around 30,000 bc, may have exterminated the =\r\nindigonius population around 12,000. the evidence for this is a pink layer =\r\n(evidence of burning) and arrows heads and primitive weapons sealed within =\r\nthe layer.\n\n \n\nT.D\n \n\n\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nFrom: burker1@aol=\r\n.com\nDate: Sat, 2 May 2009 00:43:49 -0400\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re:=\r\n Parallels in US and Japanese history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there are no written rec=\r\nords that predate the &quot;so called \ncivilizational tools&quot;, I would like to kn=\r\now what you based your conclusion on regarding \nhow humans once lived in eq=\r\nuality and helping each other?\n\nBob Burke\n\nIn a message dated 5/1/09 8:59:2=\r\n5 PM, eddiehiramoto@... writes:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As far as slaves are co=\r\nncerned, this is the parallel not only in US and \n&gt; Japanese history, but i=\r\nn world wide of human history since ancient world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Until Humans invent=\r\ned so called civilizational tools, or rice crop, they \n&gt; used to live under=\r\n helping each other concept and equally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then, they formed stron=\r\ng powered people vs weak people gradually, \n&gt; resulting in coming out slave=\r\ns from weak people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even now, the rich people and poor people exist in=\r\n world wide.
