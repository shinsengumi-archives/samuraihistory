In\n&gt; his own book BOOK OF FIVE\n&gt; RINGS, he listed his ancestry, and he most\n&gt; definitely qualified. \n\nNina, you&#39;re calling out my inner-skeptic. In his OWN\nBOOK, you say? Shocking that he&#39;d give himself a\nsamurai pedigree, oh my!\n\nSeriously, I don&#39;t know one way or the other--he may\nhave been, may not have been. I don&#39;t really care, as\nI&#39;m not a Musashiphile. Had he ever been on the\nwinning side in a battle, or led troops in combat, I&#39;d\ncare--duelists aren&#39;t my &quot;thing&quot;. [/rant] (sorry, I\njust don&#39;t *get* Musashi...compelling character maybe,\nbut Tsukuhara Bokuden or Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, who\nactually led samurai troops in addition to being great\nduelists, are much more interesting, I think). \n\nI&#39;m reminded, however, of Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s &quot;lineage&quot;.\nIt&#39;s accepted as &quot;fact&quot; nowadays that the Tokugawa\nwere descended from the Minamoto, but in truth Ieyasu\nhad several family trees fabricated, claiming lineage\nto the Fujiwara, Taira, Minamoto...to use as best fit\nthe situation. Turns out the best one that suited his\npurposes was the Minamoto one, to strengthen a claim\nat Shogun, so that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got. \n\nPerhaps Musashi was being honest and was a samurai,\nperhaps not. As you said, his early life is extremely\nmurky--I&#39;ll go with a &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; on this one. \n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n"
