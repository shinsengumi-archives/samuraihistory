I&#39;ve been mystified recently by the\nhorrible English, but haven&#39;t wanted to say anything\nbecause I realize that not everyone on this list is a\nnative English speaker, and while I can make myself\nsomewhat coherent in Japanese, I&#39;m by no means going\nto appear on NHK any time soon. \n\nSecondly, the idea of &quot;becoming&quot; a samurai is as\nridiculous as the idea of &quot;becoming&quot; a Jedi or a\nwizard or a klingon. \n\n\n--- Michael Lorimer &lt;mijalo_kr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hear on the i) idiocy of the idea of being a\n&gt; non-Japanese samurai with no familial lineage,\n&gt; master,\n&gt; or heads to lop (I hope), ii)the real state of\n&gt; Japanese society, and iii) the horrible level of\n&gt; English displayed of late.
