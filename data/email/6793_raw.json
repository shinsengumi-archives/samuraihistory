QUESTIONS: When was O-ichi given in marriage \nto Shibata the FIRST time, when were they made to divorce and when was she made \nto marry Asai?!  I&#39;ve seen dates as early as 1557 for the first, and anywhere \nfrom 1563 to 1567 for the second two... and how many kids did she give Asai?  \nI&#39;ve seen 3 daughters pretty consistently, but was it one son or two?  Thanks \nin advance!  :-D  Take care, y&#39;all...\n\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
