It&#39;s called AFTER THE RAIN, which \ndeals with \n&gt; this subject. I forget the director but it&#39;s not really a sword-\nslashing \n&gt; &quot;chambara film,&quot; it&#39;s a thoughtful film about what kenjutsu/kendo \nactually\n&gt; is. It&#39;s \n&gt; available fairly widely with English subtitles. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps a bit.  Nina\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Talking about good movie, have you watched  &quot;when the last sword \nis drawn&quot;?\n&gt; This is a good movie too (at least that what i think).\n&gt;  \n&gt; here is the synopsis:\n&gt; kanichiro Yoshimura is a family man and a samurai who can no \nlonger feed his\n&gt; wife and children due to the low wages paid by his small town clan.\n&gt; Reluctantly, he decides to leave his loved ones and heads to the \ncity to\n&gt; join the large and renowned samurai faction, the Shinsen-gumi. \nHere he is\n&gt; forced into a difficult existence during one of the most \ntumultuous times in\n&gt; Japanese history. This wonderful gem of Japanese cinema is \ndirected by\n&gt; Yojiro Takita and written by Asada Jiro.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Totok S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nThe movie is called &quot;Mibu Gishi Den&quot; in Japan.\nOfficial site\nhttp://www.shochiku.co.jp/mibugishi/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \nJapanese translation Japanese incense Japanese print Japanese business Japanese yen Samurai swords \n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
