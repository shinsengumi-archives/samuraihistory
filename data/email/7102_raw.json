I said it iwll be ready end\nof may - how do I know  - read my post I spoke with\nhim. \n\nI am not involved in the ninja project, I never was\nand I will never be. It was started and 95% finished\nbefore I was introduced to Brandon.\n\nI think your reading something i didnt say.\n\nAs for the other projects, I have contacts and sources\nin Japan that can make other projects he wants to do\nhappen. Because of my Contacts I have agreed to help\nhim.\n\nAs for other comments by myself I dont think i once\nsaiid hayes was a viable source of info, in fact read\nthem and you will see I wrote against him agreeing\nwith Nate.\n\nMy gripe was people were attacking it because Hayes\nwas in it so it had to be bad. If youhavent seen it\nthen you havent a clue whats in it.\n\nHere is an example of that type of attitude.\n\nLets make one on armour, lets have Anthony Bryant who\nin my opinion is possibly the most knwoedgeable person\nwe could talk to in the west on the history and\nproduction of Katchu. I bet you would all love this. I\nthink it would be a great idea myself, then lets get\nhayes or Harunaka Hoshino in there wearing armour\nshowing what it looks like when worn by a man.\n\nNow by some peoples attitudes it has to be crap\nwithout a doubt, purely because one person is int here\nwe dont like.\n\nAt the end of the day if your not interested in any\nfilm dont watch it. if you are watch it.\n\nand just to claify. I was never involved in any wany\nand never will be involved in any way with the\nproduction and distribution. If you can find a post\nwhere I say that i was I will appologise. Just because\nI spoke to the maker and got some info does not make\nme a part of it.\n\npaul\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nPaul you claim not to be involved in this project or\nknow how it is to be distibuted but in one of your\nfirst posts you contradict yourself. Here is what you\nwrote:\n\n&quot;I spoke with Brandon last night on the phone, the dvd\nshould be available at the end of may.&quot;\n\n-Sounds to me like you know how it will be\ndistributed.\n\n&quot;The first 3\nprojects we are looking at are \n\n1. Famous Samurai swordsmen there schools and items\nbelonging or rewlating tot hem\n2. Various Koryu - sort of a intro to each school and\nwhat they do and who they are - 6 old schools have\nbeen contacted and 5 have already said yes.\n3. production of a kata from start to finish including\nthe making of the koshirae and polishing. (We have\naccess to one of the most senior polishers in Japan)\n\nIf all goes well we are hoping to then do one on\narmour production. \n\nIf these projects do get off the ground I will be\nasking members of this list whom I have noticed are\ninvolved in various subjects relating to what we are\ncurrently working on for help or advise.&quot;\n\n-In the above you say &quot;we&quot; alot, sounds like you are\ninvolved in this project and 3 or 4 future projects as\nwell, no wonder you defend it so much.\n\nDave\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Richardson Paul \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, May 09, 2005 12:10 AM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] New Ninja documentary\n\n\n  www.shinobiwinds.com\n\n  not sure how it will be distributed as I am not\n  involved in it\n\n  Paul\n\n\n  --- Michael Youngblood &lt;warrior02@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n  ---------------------------------\n  Paul,\n  Speaking of witch, how can the film be viewed?

It is possible I can also\n  find someone to fund it\n\n  however until someone who knows better (maybe\nyourself\n  Nate) then we have to make do with a little better\n  each time. So far the only nina documentaries I have\n  seen are on things ike dicovery and I could have\n  choked at the crap they spouted.\n\n  Paul\n\n\n\n\n  --- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  ---------------------------------\n\n  --- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; HI\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I love this attitude.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I havent seen it, I know nothing about it, so I\nwill\n  &gt; slam it as much as I can.\n\n  Since when has skepticism meant &quot;slam it as much as\nI\n  can&quot;? I&#39;ll slam Hayes all day--I&#39;ve, to date, made 1\n  comment about the documentary. Did you produce this?\n  You&#39;re certainly defending it like you&#39;ve got a\nvested\n  interest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese\n  history 101 and knows something now--but I&#39;m\n  skeptical. \n\n  If the documentary isn&#39;t built around him, than\n  lovely--hopefully it has some useful information. \n\n  &gt; My I suggest if you already think its a load of\ncrap\n  &gt; before its been released that you go and produce\n  &gt; something better.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; i await your future project on the ninja so we can\n  &gt; all\n  &gt; insult it\n\n  If you&#39;re willing to pay me to quit my job, fund the\n  project, and pay the production costs, I&#39;d be more\n  than happy to. Of course, it&#39;d be cheaper to just\n  translate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then\n  you&#39;d take issue with my translation, I&#39;m sure. \n\n  __________________________________________________\n  Do You Yahoo!?\n  Tired of spam?  Yahoo!
