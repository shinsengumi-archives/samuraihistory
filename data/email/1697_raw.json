I have two swords that have been in my \nfamily&#39;s possession for almost 60 years, since they returned to the \nUS with an older member of my family at the end of World War II. For \nyears I admired these swords, but only recently started to examine \nthem with a sense of their history. Certainly, a little knowledge can \nbe a dangerous thing, but every thing I learn (or think I do)leads to \nmore curiosity and questions.\n\nOne sword is an Army Parade Saber that I gather is relatively common \nand nothing special - except for one thing - this saber has its \noriginal tassel.\n\nHowever, the other sword is more intriguing and of more historical \ninterest. The style is Kyu Gunto which I believe became popular \nduring the Russo/Japanese war and continued until World War II. \nRemoving the blade from the handle reveals the signature on the tang. \nThe translation I have indicates that the sword blade was forged in \nthe 17th century. More specifically, by a smith between 1681 and 1684.\nI am just fascinated by all of this - the characters on the hidden \npart of the sword blade, etc. \n\nSorry for the long preamble, but this leads to three questions:\n\n1. I would like to know better how to care for these swords. I know \nthis is not the proper forum for that discussion, but if anyone could \npoint me toward that information somewhere, I would appreciate it.\n\n2. How common a practice was it for a military officer to take an old \nsword, maybe a family sword, and have it configured and adapted to a \nmore contemporary style?\n\n3. I am interested in learning about the smith who forged this sword \nblade in the 1680&#39;s. The name was translated for me, but I have been \nunable to find information about him. He is not listed on the Samurai-\nArchives site. Can anyone give me any suggestions about searching for \ninformation about this smith?\n\nThank you for offering and supporting this group.\n\nScott Moore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
