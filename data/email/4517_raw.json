During campaign did the Samurai armies \nset up camps ? Did they have tents ? A bagage train ? and what were \ntheir rations like ? I have seen paintings of their Head quarters in \nthe field but thats it. Their soldiers would have been in the open at \nnight and exsposed to the weather with out some protection.I am \nbuilding an impression and need to know this. During Living history \ndisplays I would like to set up some type of small camp. Thanks !!!\n\nTakara \n\n\n"
