I&#39;ll have more questions if this proves useful. \n\nI have read that=\r\n a wide variety of noted worthies were all exiled to \nSado Island, apparent=\r\nly to work in mines or something. I also note \nthat it was considered a one=\r\n way trip. How does that work, exactly?  \nI see that it was ruled by the Ho=\r\nmma clan for the relevant period. \nDid they act as jailers for the court an=\r\nd Shogunate? Did only people \nthat it was impolitic to execute get sent the=\r\nre? \n\nI have the following hypothetical examples in my mind&#39;s eye:\n\n#1 &quot;Pri=\r\nnce Okisugi no Guchi offends the Emperor one too many times \nwith his scand=\r\nalous gossip, and he is ordered to relocate to Sado \nIsland. His estates fo=\r\nrfeit, the prince is escorted by a retinue of \nImperial guardsmen across Ja=\r\npan, taking only what his four or five \nservants will carry. After many wee=\r\nks of travel, during which he is \ngiven opportunities to end his own life w=\r\nith dignity, he is loaded \nonto a boat and transferred to Homma custody, wh=\r\nere he is received as \nan honored guest... meaning he lives out his days in=\r\n a decrepit \nseaside house with one loyal servant, writing his memoirs. He =\r\ndoes \nnot escape, because if he does, he will be executed, or something bad=\r\n \nmight happen to his relatives in Kyoto, or his considerable remaining \ndi=\r\ngnity will be squandered. &quot;\n\n#2 &quot;Priest Yominikui offends the Shogun one to=\r\no many times with his \natrocious poetry. It is considered bad form to kill =\r\na priest who is \ndistantly related to Lord Yamana Sozen, so he is instead s=\r\nlapped in \nchains, carted to the boat, and shipped to Sado Island. There he=\r\n is \nfar too busy digging in the Homma silver mines to write poems. Priest =\r\n\nYominikui eventually expires under the strain of his new labors.&quot; \n\nWould =\r\nit be plausible for PC&#39;s to be sent to Sado by a powerful \npatron to retrie=\r\nve some old noble, because he was needed for the \nbrewing Onin intrigues? O=\r\nr perhaps simply for a PC to carry a private \nletter from one powerful pers=\r\non to an exiled Imperial relative, \nseeking support for some power play?\n\nT=\r\nhanks, \nAndrew\n\n\n"
