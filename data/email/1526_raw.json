Chivalry was an ideal as much concerned\nwith courtly love and Christian devotion as with\nconduct in warfare. Much of samurai-based literature\nwas similarly focussed, upon ideals. &#39;Heike\nMonogatari&#39; extolls the virtues of usurping Taira\nwarrios and the rather rougher Minamoto from the more\nrural east, and as Yoritomo shows he was as cutthroat\n(pragmatic?) as anyone else. The whole machinery of\nthe Kamakura bakufu/Hojo regency collapsed fifty years\nafter the second (attempted) Mongol invasion, largely\ndue to the fact the samurai who served were not\nhandsomely regarded, since it was a defensive\ncampaign. Rspect goes hand-in-hand with rewards.\nM.Lorimer \n\n\n --- Honda Kowabunga &lt;hkowabunga@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\n&gt;From: &quot;Scott &lt;scottc_4@...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;scottc_4@...&gt;\n\n&gt;I personaly disagree that Knights were more\nhonorable.  I am not\n&gt;saying they were less honorable.  But the ideal of\ngoing off and\n&gt;killing all the bad muslim people (just a statement\nof the feeling of\n&gt;the time of the knights, I have nothing against\nmuslims as a group)\n&gt;for the glory of god and holy mother church or you\nwill burn in hell\n&gt;for all eternity does not seem any more honorable. \nJust my 2 cents.\n\nAlthough your point is correct regarding some of the\nmisdirected efforts of \nthe Crusades, the general statement should not be\napplied to knights in \ngeneral.\n\nIn the end, knights and samurai had the same faults as\nanyone else, in spite \nof their intentions simply because they were human and\nsubject to all \ninfluences that the rest of us are exposed to.\n\nHonda\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  \nhttp://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\n\n\nYahoo!
