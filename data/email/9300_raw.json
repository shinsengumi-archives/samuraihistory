Ho=\r\nnor and discipline were there basic structure in the way of \ntheir lifestyl=\r\ne.\n\n* To honestly tell you the truth, I am American and Puerto Rican, so \nn=\r\no.\n\n* I really have no artifacts accept a functional samurai sword that \ni =\r\ngot from a japanese trader i believe, I knew how it was made also \nif you w=\r\nanted to know that~\n\n* Well i think the samurai from earlier times were not=\r\n that \ndifferent than from the ones that we know very much about. the only =\r\n\nthing different that i think of was their swords and fighting back \nthen. =\r\nI heard that there swords before the katana were like a \nChinese Tai-Chi.\n\n=\r\n* I think that they were described by how they were decorated with \nthe swo=\r\nrds, like now our soldiers are decorated by their ribbons and \nmedals; so t=\r\nhey had ranks, there was a samurai, then Master Samurai \nI believe.\n\n* Thei=\r\nr lifestyle differs from that of a commoner, swordsman,or a \nninja because =\r\nof their discipline and honor.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gu=\r\nildman95&quot; &lt;samclane@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a student and need to =\r\nwrite a paper for a research project. I \nwas \n&gt; going to interview someone =\r\nwith samurai ancestory, but I lost the \nphone \n&gt; number and now I can&#39;t int=\r\nerview her. So, I remembered you guys \nand \n&gt; thought you could help. I nee=\r\nd to ask you a series of questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. What made you interested in sam=\r\nurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Do you have any samurai ancestors?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.Do you have any art=\r\nifacts? If so, describe them.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4.What were the early samurai like?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 5. What are the different types/ranks of a samurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. How does the l=\r\nife of a samurai differ from the life of a non-\nsamurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you ver=\r\ny much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Respond ASAP!!!! It&#39;s due tomarow!!!!!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
