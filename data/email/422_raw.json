I can tell by reading your emails that you all know what u are\ntalking about and I would be very grateful if u could suggest some\nwebsites books and anything relating to samurai history. I have already\ngot my hands on some books (by Stephen Turnbull who I am told is\nsomewhat of an expert in this field) but I am looking for books that\nfocus more on the armor and the mons of the samurai. Any information\nwill be greatly appreciated\n \nThanks\nSheldon \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
