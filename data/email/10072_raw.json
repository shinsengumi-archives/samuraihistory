Matter of fact, you inspired me to have my wife send the JW Hall book to me here in the hinterlands of the earth. \n\nCareful, though, making assumptions--peasants didn&#39;t have freedom of movement in Japan, either. As the producers for the entire nation, it was a major concern of local and national landholders if the peasantry up and left their plots. Hideyoshi&#39;s formalization of societal division was as much to keep the farmers on the land as farmers as it was to keep the samurai class in check, if not more. Laws across the country for villages to report &quot;unknown suspicious persons&quot; were as much about identifying absconded peasants as it was for preventing nefarious types shelter. \n\nIt&#39;s important to distinguish the peasant from the townsperson, the chonin, who was not under any such restriction--as they were viewed as parasites rather than producers, it really wasn&#39;t cared if they moved around. Of course, much of what BECAME townspeople, as in Edo, were peasants who left to escape oppresive conditions, but the bottom line is that especially from the time of Hideyoshi on, it was very clearly illegal for peasants to leave their lands. \n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Dennis Sheridan &lt;ldsheridan@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thu, December 31, 2009 12:29:35 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku\n\n  \nThanks much, Nate. I did mean &quot;feudal&quot; in the very broad sense. Much in both\ncultures had nothing in common - the complete lack of mobility among\ncommoners in Europe and, if I understand correctly, freedom of movement in\nJapan as just one small example.  I really appreciate the reading\nreferences.  My problem has been what authors to read and is it in English.\nYour recommendations are of enormous help. \n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
