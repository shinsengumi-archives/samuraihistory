Oda Nobunaga had at least -- at LEAST -- two \nsisters.  (My \n&gt; guess is that there were more.)  One was Oichi-no-kata, married to \nShibata \n&gt; Katsuie (twice) and Asai Nagamasa.  The other was married to Takeda \n&gt; Katsuyori.  Does anybody know what HER name was?  If she had one?  \nAs I said, \n&gt; just wondering.  I&#39;ve never seen a name or lifedates for her, only \nthat her \n&gt; husband died with the last of his clan at the hands of her brother \nand his \n&gt; armies.  Or was she another of the unnamed women who were \ntragically used \n&gt; solely for strategic purposes?  Thanks again!
