The story chronicles a young girl&#39;s rise from \npoverty in a Japanese fishing village to life in high society.\n\nThe lead role of Sayuri will go to Zhang Ziyi, the Chinese actress \nwho starred in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and appeared in the \ncomedy &quot;Rush Hour 2,&quot; her publicist said Thursday.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the story, a geisha is a Japanese woman \nschooled in the art of dance, singing and conversation to be a \ncompanion for wealthy men.\n\nZhang, 25, has been working to perfect her English for several years \nand now speaks the language with little difficulty.\n\n&quot;This is the first time that I will play the lead in an English-\nlanguage movie. It will be a big challenge, but the studios, \nproducers and director have shown great confidence in me. I will \ncontinue to do my utmost to make this the best role I&#39;ve ever \nplayed,&quot; she told The Associated Press.\n\nKen Watanabe, an Oscar nominee for &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; will portray \nthe Chairman, a high-powered executive with whom Sayuri falls in love.\n\nAnother &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; co-star, Michelle Yeoh, has \nsigned to portray Mameha, the elegant and experienced geisha who \nbecomes Sayuri&#39;s mentor.\n\n&quot;Geisha&quot; will be directed by Rob Marshall, the Oscar-nominated \ndirector of &quot;Chicago.&quot;\n\nMarshall has long wanted to make this his next project, but was \nlocked into a contract with Miramax Films, while Columbia Pictures \nand DreamWorks SKG held the rights to &quot;Geisha.&quot; After lengthy \nnegotiations that threatened to block his participation, a deal was \neventually reached among the studios.\n\n&quot;We could not be more excited about the extraordinary cast that we \nhave in place for &#39;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot;&#39; said Marshall, who&#39;s also a \nTony-winning director and choreographer. &quot;We are adapting a beloved \npiece of literature that has become a worldwide sensation, which made \nit important to me to assemble a cast with a prestigious \ninternational profile.&quot;\n\nFor many years, Steven Spielberg was interested in directing the \nfilm. He will now serve as a producer.\n\n&quot;From the time I first read Arthur Golden&#39;s novel, I wanted to see \nthis as a film,&quot; Spielberg said. &quot;It&#39;s a uniquely compelling story \nrich with characters who take you into a world you have never \nexperienced before.&quot;\n\nProduction is set to begin in the fall, but the release date has not \nyet been specified.\n\n\n\n\n"
