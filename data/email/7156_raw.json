So I have personally\na great debt of gratitude to Clavell for writing it, I just wish he&#39;d\nfollowed the original story a wee bit closer!\n\n&gt;.oh,and the photo of the samurai playing go....samurai \n&gt;    would not sit like that.atleast not in the presence of others.\n\nYep, can&#39;t fault you on that one, you&#39;re absolutely right, but I&#39;m old,\ngrey haired, grumpy, and my knees no longer like being sat on, plus\nafter many years of wearing combat boots, my ankles object to bending\nquite that far. And besides, it had been a long hot day and my old bones\njust wanted to go flomp on the deck. And to cap it all, I&#39;m virtually\nblind, and if I sat properly I&#39;d never be able to see the board, mind\nyou it wouldn&#39;t have made much difference to the outcome of that\nparticular game:-) Seppuku anybody?\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\nP.S. For those who don&#39;t know what Carl is referring to when he say&#39;s\n&quot;Shogun page&quot;, see my link below and all will be revealed.\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk/SHOGUN.htm\n\n\n"
