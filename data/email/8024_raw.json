I even hear that cer=\r\ntain\nmukansa level Japanese swordsmiths are regularly visiting Shanghai and=\r\n\nteaching the making of Japanese swords to local craftsmen, presumably for\n=\r\ncommercial considerations.\n\nHowever, the point that I am struggling to make=\r\n is that Chen swords are in\nno way comprable to fine swords from the pre Me=\r\niji period or even the hand\nmade swords from post Meiji jidai. These swords=\r\n are known, because of their great beauty, as Token Bijutsu and those of pa=\r\nrticular historical or\ncultural importance are of great value. There is, th=\r\nerefore, a world of\ndifference between the more practical swords of Paul Ch=\r\nen and &quot;real&quot;\nJapanese swords. I just think that it is importanat that thos=\r\ne who buy\nChinese made Japanese swords, if that is not a contradiction in t=\r\nerms, are\nlabouring under no illusions.\n\nI write the above in answer to Jam=\r\nes&#39;s question But if its not the best or a top level one what is? Who can I=\r\n look for. \nIf I have the wrong end of the stick on this discussion, please=\r\n forgive me.\nClive Sinclaire\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;james wi=\r\nlson&quot; &lt;johntwo8@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thurs=\r\nday, November 24, 2005 5:48 AM\nSubject: Re: R: [samuraihistory] cleaning a =\r\nnew katana HELP PLEASE!!!! ok\nquick question\n\n\nI am not a sword guru but I =\r\nhave seen a sword by Paul Chen and its the best\nyou can get where I am from=\r\n.
