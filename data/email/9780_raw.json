Shingen and Kenshin&#39;s Five Battles\n\nSengoku Daimyo Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin are two well known\nfigures from Japan&#39;s Sengoku period who fought five battles on the\nKawanakajima plain in Shinano province (Modern day Nagano prefecture)\nbetween 1553 and 1564. (The fouth battle was depicted in the 1990\nKadokawa Haruki movie Heaven and Earth) Why did Kawanakajima become\nthe main battleground for these two warriors? What made Kawanakajima\nsuch a contested area? I thought I&#39;d tackle this question for my blog\npost this week. After a combination of poking around and deductive\nreasoning, I can come up with a few reasons. Although, there is no way\nto really know which reasons might be correct, a little theoretical\nguesswork never hurt anyone.\n\nThe rest here:\nhttp://shogun- yashiki.blogspot .com/2008/ 09/why-kawanakaj ima-shingen- and-kenshins. html\n\n    \n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
