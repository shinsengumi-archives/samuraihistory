I see history as made up of individuals facing\ncertain \n&gt; conditions and making individual choices. I tend to shy away from broad \n&gt; generalizations based on sweeping tendencies based on large groups\nof people. \n&gt; \nI also am totally fascinated by individual characters and have a great\nlove for those around in the 12th century.  Although I know that I\nhave to view them within the context of their times and circumstances,\nand although I know that their reactions will come from being immersed\nin a culture and age totally different to mine, I can&#39;t help but try\nand identify something within me that draws me to them.  I guess it&#39;s\nhuman nature, to seek to find a small connection within that huge\nhistorical background.  Whether it&#39;s a scruffy ronin, a peasant or a\nshogun, whether we admire them or despise them, it seems that there is\nsomething about them that singles them out for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
