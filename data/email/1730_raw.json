Without further \n&gt; info though, I stand by my translation. The Nihonto Meikan lists \nfive \n&gt; Katsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one who signed in this \nmanner. \n&gt; The shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sengo Masashige. \n&gt; Masashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa. Banshu Katsuyoshi \n&gt; was originally from the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and worked around \nthe \n&gt; Tenna era (1681-1683).\n&gt; \tOne would expect to see some characteristics of the Sengo \n&gt; school in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and monouchi are \n&gt; important. I agree no final determination can be made without sword \n&gt; in hand, but I would posit that a faker or &#39;tribute&#39; sword would \n&gt; hardly choose to copy the work of a late generation smith from a \n&gt; little known line.\n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
