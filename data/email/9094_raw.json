Here is the URL:\n \n http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/\n \n We re=\r\nally need editors to get in there and start adding content.

If\n you know anyone with any sort of specialty, be i=\r\nt Samurai movies or\n history books, let them know about the Wiki - there is=\r\n a place for all\n aspects of Japanese history here.\n \n Thanks,\n \n C.West\n \n=\r\n \n     \n                       \n\n \t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo y=\r\nou Yahoo!?\n Everyone is raving about the  all-new Yahoo!
