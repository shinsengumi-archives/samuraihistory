But isn&#39;t he worthy of the fame because he created a new martial art, and also because he was such a good swordsman? Just a question for all to ponder. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knew exactly how to draw both swords properly in Niten Ichi Ryu. Also could anyone tell me where I can find sources that will help me teach myself Niten Ichi Ryu, because there aren&#39;t any schools for it in my area.\n\n                                                                                    Thanks,\n\n                                                                                             Joel\n\n\n  &quot;Perceive that which cannot be seen with the eye.&quot;\n                         \n                                   - Miyamoto Mushashi\n  Do you Yahoo!?\n  Yahoo!
