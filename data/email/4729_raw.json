Such was his shame that he, too, sought \nout the Yagyu school and began a period of intensive training. \nEventually, having mastered the sword, and thus himself (and \nthus his habits) he asked his wife for a re-match.\n\nThe two faced each other, and immediately the wife could see \nthe man she married, put down her sword and offered it to him \nto dispose of at his pleasure.\n\nNeedless to say, it remained within the family.\n\nA story, but a good story always has the ring of truth. Not \nthat women necessarily trained in swordsmanship, but that \nsamurai women would have a certain strength of character.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n"
