Does any one have this?\n&gt; Is it highly recomended?\n&gt;\n&gt; The only problem is that most places don&#39;t have it in stock\n&gt; (it&#39;s from 1963), the one place I did find it is selling it\n&gt; for US$395.00.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Also does anyone have Mitsuo Kure&#39;s &#39;SAMURAI: An\n&gt; Illustrated History&#39;?
