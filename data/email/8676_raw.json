I found a copy at Maruzen=\r\n\nSendai\n&gt;on my recent trip back to the land of the Rising Yen. I read it on=\r\n the\n&gt;return flight and was very impressed. We all MUST have this. It is\ntr=\r\nuly\n&gt;very good, very clear and readable, and handsomely produced. In fact, =\r\nI\n&gt;have been meaning to post some comments about the volume on this list,\nb=\r\nut\n&gt;you know how best intentions are. I also am writing this without the\nbo=\r\nok\n&gt;in front of me - since you brought it up - so I won&#39;t be able to give\n&gt;=\r\nchapter and verse, but...\n&gt;       The book covers the polishing process and=\r\n explains the role and\nuse\n&gt;of the sequence of stones etc. It also covers t=\r\nhe design of the\npolishers\n&gt;work station - even allowing for some adjustmen=\r\nts that OSHA might\napprove\n&gt;and traditionalists abhor! It has good treatmen=\r\nts of the styles and\nkinds\n&gt;of polish that are the best I&#39;ve ever read. The=\r\nre is also a good\nsection on\n&gt;how bends and twists are handled.\n&gt;       Hav=\r\ning said all those nice things, there are 3 issues that I \n&gt;remember\n&gt;think=\r\ning were under treated. First, I would have like more on the\nnature\n&gt;and or=\r\nigin of the various stones. There is not even a description of\nhow\n&gt;they ar=\r\ne marketed and where they can be bought. Second, I felt that\nshape\n&gt;is addr=\r\nessed too briefly. There is also nothing (really) about how the\n&gt;polisher c=\r\nan, should and might deal with ji-niku. This is the issue\nthat\n&gt;has been cl=\r\naimed by experts as the variable that anyone but experts can\n&gt;screw-up. Yet=\r\n in this book, it is not addressed. I think the term is\n&gt;defined, but there=\r\n is no description. Finally, the whole issue of kizu\nand\n&gt;kizu control is i=\r\ngnored. Again, I think there might be a definition in\nthe\n&gt;glossary, but th=\r\ne text says NOTHING about how a polisher deals with\nflaws.\n&gt;We all know tha=\r\nt a polisher can enhance weak hamon and flatten fukure,\nbut\n&gt;nothing is sai=\r\nd about that kind of work or issues like hako-bori\nremoval.\n&gt;Maybe those &quot;s=\r\necrets&quot; are too valuable to publish.\n&gt;       This is a book for sword colle=\r\nctors and we all need it. I don&#39;t\nsee\n&gt;it as anywhere close to a &quot;how-to bo=\r\nok&quot;. I assume that some people will\ntry\n&gt;to use it in that way, but it is p=\r\nrimarily a description of the craft\nof\n&gt;polishing. When it does show up on =\r\nthis side of the Pacific, you will\nfind\n&gt;enjoy it.\n&gt;Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Peter Bleed\n=\r\n&gt;Professor of Anthropology\n&gt;810 Oldfather Hall\n&gt;University of Nebraska\n&gt;Lin=\r\ncoln, NE 68588-0368\n&gt;(402) 472-2439\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fict=\r\nion contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archive=\r\ns: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafes=\r\nhops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
