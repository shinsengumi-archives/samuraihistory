My question is this--what year \n&gt; was that=\r\n battle and was there ever such a tournament? Who won? The \n&gt; anime concern=\r\ns a Battousai or Legendary manslayer nicknamed &#39;Demon Eyes \n&gt; Kyo&#39; whose sp=\r\nirit/soul inhabits the body of a younger hero named \n&gt; Yushira. Looks like =\r\na cool series and I&#39;m told it actually has an \n&gt; ending after 24 eppys. I t=\r\nhink that Shina the gal bounty hunter&#39;s 3 \n&gt; barrelled flintlock pistol is =\r\njust smoke and mirrors and was never a \n&gt; real weapon since flintlocks do n=\r\not have rotating barrels. Domo arigato \n&gt; for your assistance. Kami bless y=\r\nou all. Sayonara-K&K\n&gt;\n\nThe battle of Sekigahara happened in 1600.  The res=\r\nt is pretty much\njust fiction.\n\n\n"
