For the rest \nof us- We now=\r\n have two distinct dates. 1545 and 1615. Remember \njakotsu&#39;s encounter with=\r\n the matchlock wielding riflemen? There were \nno flintlocks in Japan before=\r\n the Portugese came in 1545. In 1615 the \nTokogowan victor&#39;s (NobuNaga) fir=\r\nst act (after using rifles to win \nthe Great Battle which united the clans =\r\nin 1615) was to ban and \noutlaw &#39;all&#39; firearms. Therefore it is twixt 1545 =\r\nand 1615 that IY is \nlaid. Another one for you- why are IY and his bro cons=\r\nidered &#39;Lords&#39;? \nMore later.

I mean I know it&#39;s the warr=\r\ning \nstates era \n&gt; twixt 1500 and 1600 something but is it before Sekigahar=\r\na in 1600, \nthe Osaka\n&gt; \n&gt; battle in 1604, the uniting of the clans in 1615=\r\n (Tokogowa era) or \nis it \n&gt; earlier or later than that? The only clue seem=\r\ns to be that in the \neppy about\n&gt; \n&gt; the Toad Prince the kid NobuNaga (Kag =\r\nthinks he&#39;s &#39;the&#39; NobuNaga) \nmay the \n&gt; young warlord himself. He could be =\r\nunrelated or a descendant or \neven an \n&gt; ancestor of old NN. Anyone know fo=\r\nr sure when IY is set? I say \naround 1550 \n&gt; when the seven samurai were pr=\r\nevalent. I believe Kurogawa did in \nfact base \n&gt; his 7 Samurai fim and late=\r\nr the Samurai 7 anime on a real life \nincident in \n&gt; history. By the way th=\r\ne Risen 7 leader Bankotsu is voiced by Matt \nHill. He&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; best known as =\r\nthe voices of Eddie and Big Ed on the cartoon shows \nEd, Edd \n&gt; and Eddie. =\r\nThe gal doing Jakotsu&#39;s voice is familiar and I know her \nname but\n&gt; \n&gt; can=\r\nnot place her in any animes I&#39;ve seen. Any help greatly \nappreciated as \n&gt; =\r\nMom is sure that IY is laid after Demon Eyed Kyo (Samurai Deeper \nKyo). \n&gt; =\r\nToodles-K&K\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________________=\r\n\n&gt; Watch free concerts with Pink, Rod Stewart, Oasis and more.
