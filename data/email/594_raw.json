Lyle Parker&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As a co-webmaster and translator for the Samurai Archives - who\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have the benefit of studying Japanese history in a university\n&gt; setting (I&#39;m working on an MBA) I was wondering what sort of\n&gt; resources students of Japanese history in a university setting\n&gt; actually get.  I&#39;m targeting this at anyone currently studying\n&gt; Japanese history in a university / college, (particularly A.J.\n&gt; Bryant).  I doubt that the sources used are the 20 - 40 year old\n&gt; Varley, Sansom, Reischauer, Berry, etc...?\n\nOh, Lord, no. You&#39;re right about Japanese sources for primary lingo research,\nbut you&#39;ve already listed most of the common source texts used in classes.\nDepending on specializations, we work with Mass (and the Massites) and Janssen,\nas well as Friday and Farris. And Elisonas, of course (Deus Destroyed is a\nclassic.) Many others have only one or two books out there, but they&#39;re really\nuseful in their areas (Shirane,  Barger, Adolphson, etc.).\n\nWhen people are getting into Japanese, I often send them to Sansom for a\ngeneral historical overview to find an area that interests them, but I&#39;d never\nrely on it or teach it.\n\nAnd then there are the Japanese books, both modern scholarship and critical\ntexts. I love the Japanese; who else publishes books with the near corpus of\nthe classical language literature in their language? With collections like the\nNihon Koten Bungaku Taikei, the Nihon Koten Bungaku Zenshu, the Nihon Shiso\nTaikei and so on, I&#39;m in hog heaven.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; New scholarship in Japan comes out yearly, so are there books in\n&gt; english (textbooks, etc.) for students currently being written by\n&gt; professors for these Japanese history students?\n\nDefinitely. We see a lot of them in literature, too. Plus theories are\nconstantly being re-evaluated. I&#39;ve totally reversed my position on the Emishi,\nfor example, and have come into line with the current theory that they\n*weren&#39;t* any different than the regular &quot;Yamato&quot; Japanese except that they\nrefused to submit to central court rule. The evidence seems rather compelling.\n\n&gt; I have been getting\n&gt; most of my info from varous books in Japanese, including the Rekishi\n&gt; Gunzo series, and other sources, by historians such as Kuwada\n&gt; Nagachika and Kasaya Kazuhiko among others, but would like to find\n&gt; out what sort of resources &#39;university students&#39; of Japanese\n&gt; history / sengoku actually get. I doubt that students are required to\n&gt; actually learn Japanese, read Japanese sources, including old\n&gt; japanese, or are they?\n\nIt&#39;s good if they can, but it&#39;s not a major factor. Certainly for an undergrad\nmajor you need three years in the language, and that&#39;s enough to at least work\nthrough popular historical texts. For grad school, of course primary language\nresearch is pretty much required. I have little use for people who do grad work\nin an area studies field entirely in their mother tongue. &lt;g&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As you can tell, I&#39;m particularly interested in the type of (and\n&gt; availability of) these textbooks, if they exist.  Hey, why reinvent\n&gt; the wheel?  if the sort of info I&#39;m getting from Japanese sources is\n&gt; the same as what is hidden away in University libraries in english,\n&gt; I&#39;d choose english!\n\nI can relate. I can read Mass in a day or so, but if I were reading the\nJapanese equivalent of Mass it would take me many days. Frustrating....\n\n\nTony\n\n\n"
