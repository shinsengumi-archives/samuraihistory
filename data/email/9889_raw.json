Again, it contr=\r\nadicts some &quot;accepted history&quot;... so fair warning.=A0 For example, it says =\r\nthat Toyotomi was actually working as a spy for the Hachisuka in the beginn=\r\ning--- that he was not a peasant at all, but a low ranking samurai working =\r\nas a spy. He was hired by the Ikoma Family and it was Ikoma&#39;s daugher that =\r\nintroduce Toyotomi to Oda Nobunaga.\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 He worked with the H=\r\nachisuka and Maeno later on as a combination of soldier/spy... in fact, man=\r\ny of the samurai families from the upper Owari area (the Hachisuka, Fukushi=\r\nma, Kawajiri, Kumazawa, Nojiri, Nakagawa, Maeno=A0etc.etc) of northern Nago=\r\nya, Ichinomiya, Konan, etc.etc---- most of their family history follows the=\r\n &quot;spy&quot; version of the story--- not the &quot;peasant&quot; version..but then again, t=\r\nhese families are known to have been spies themselves--- so I guess that it=\r\n makes sense.\n=A0\n=A0So, it is worth looking into to get a very different l=\r\nook on it all.\n\n\n--- On Wed, 4/8/09, kojalMtirta@... &lt;kojalMtirta@gma=\r\nil.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: kojalMtirta@... &lt;kojalMtirta@...&gt;\nSubjec=\r\nt: [samuraihistory] one night castle\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDat=\r\ne: Wednesday, April 8, 2009, 6:43 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan anybody tell me about the st=\r\nory of one night castle at sunomata which hideyoshi constructed.
