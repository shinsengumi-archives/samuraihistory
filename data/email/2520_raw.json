Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nJosh Wilson wrote:\n\n&gt; Yes, the tachi can be used in fights.. it was originally developed as a\n&gt; cavalry sword.. the longer blade and more pronounced curve were designed to\n&gt; be used form horseback.. much like the western examples of a saber in\n&gt; comparisson to the rapier.. the tachi was worn blade down whereas the katana\n&gt; was worn blade up.. the difference was that when you drew the tachi from\n&gt; horseback, the first draw would be a slice.. and the katana&#39;s first draw\n&gt; would be a slice as well, if worn blade down.. as far as dates, it seems that\n&gt; the tachi may be a predeccessor to the katana, but I am NOT sure..\n\n\nThere&#39;s much more to it that this.\n\nThe old court swords were tachi. For a long time, &quot;tachi&quot; seems to have been the \ngeneric word for sword. It wasn&#39;t until much later (probably no earlier than the \n15th C.) that the samaurai began to wear upside-down swords thrust through their \nsashes like they occasionally did with shorter weapons.\n\nTony\n\n\nYahoo!
