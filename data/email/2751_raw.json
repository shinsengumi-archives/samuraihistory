So there is really no answer to your question. \nIf your question is why did the Samurai government of the Tokugawa \nfail, then the answers are there but not easy to elucidate.\n\tBushi households had their income tied to rice production on lands \nalotted to them by the bakufu. Once peace was established these incomes \nwere set and most positions within the government became hereditary. \nEssentially freezing political and economic conditions at their 1620&#39;s \nlevel.\n\tWith each generation the population grew, but rice production did not, \nso Bushi families had to make ends meet for larger and larger \nhouseholds on a salary that did not increase at anywhere near the same \nrate. Heavy taxation, flood and famine placed onerous burdens upon the \nfarmer who began to rebel more often. Bushi houses and the government \nborrowed heavily, increasing the power and prestige of the merchant \nclass, while draining national coffers.\n\tThe policy of isolationism, handicapped efforts to modernize the \nmilitary and political power of the Shoguns. The threat of European \nintervention in Japan, laid plain all the weaknesses of the Tokugawa \nsystem. There were only three choices left; War with the Great Powers \nand colonization, rapid and dramatic reform of the existing government \nor revolution. The second was undertaken too late, bringing about the \nthird which we know as the Meiji Restoration...\n-t\n\n\n"
