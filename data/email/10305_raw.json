Nevertheless formal and clear definitions about the way of the\n&gt; samurai, the seven principles and thing like that, are written in the\n&gt; Tokugawa period, several centuries after.Please, could you help me saying me\n&gt; if there is some code of samurai ways written in the kamakura period (or\n&gt; before), better if accepted and promoted by the bakufu, and what it says\n&gt; more or less? Thank you for your help.\n&gt;\n&gt; While there appears to be a reference to &quot;bushido&quot; before the Tokugawa\nperiod, it seems to be very personal and individualized.  There was\ndefinitely a culture of honor, or &quot;face&quot; in Japanese culture.  For example,\n Emp. Godaigo&#39;s spy justified his absence from court by intentionally and\npublically making a mistake in reading a particular character.  That\nhumiliation gave him an excuse to retire from the court for about a year.\n Other bits can be gleaned from various war tales.\n\nWe find evidence of people who dyed their hair black and perfumed it so that\nwhen they died in battle their head would be presentable.  Suicide (though\nnot necessarily harakiri) is a common enough theme--though it is a last\nresort.  Enduring pain and suffering with stoic fortitude are also common,\nand look to the way Buddhist values--particularly of anti-materialism and\nthe concept of non-attachment--was idealized among this class.\n\nOf course, people could find all sorts of reasons to get around such\nstrictures.\n\nFor direct evidence, you&#39;ll need to look to various house instructions\nwritten by leaders to their followers and descendants.\n\nAlso look to Karl Friday and others.\n\nWhat have you read, so far?\n\n-Josh\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
