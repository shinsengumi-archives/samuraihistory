He doesn&#39;t appear to USE the Japanese \nsources he so proudly cites, and if he does, it is always very \ngeneral info a third year student of Japanese could pull off of a map \nor timeline in one of the books.  No hard info.\nNot to mention the fact that in 20 years he hasn&#39;t really added all \nthat much to his &#39;scholarship&#39;.  \n\nI guess I would have absolutely no complaints at all if he didn&#39;t \nclaim to be a DOCTOR of Japanese history. That is my biggest \ncomplaint with the guy. If someone has enough bravado to claim to be \na DOCTOR of Japanese history, then they sure as heck should be able \nto back it up (can someone PLEASE TELL ME exactly WHAT his doctorate \nis in??? or if he even has one at all?).  I&#39;ve seen shoddy work from \nplenty of &#39;Martial Arts&#39; related &quot;&quot;Samurai History&quot;&quot;, but forgive \nthat because they are looking at history thru the seriously warped \nlense of the martial arts world, where Samurai practiced Karate in \nsecret Dojos and had an official &#39;samurai code of honor&#39; handbook \nthey &#39;lived by&#39; during the Sengoku period, and Ninja kidnapped \nchildren from villages and trained them in the secret arts of the \nblack ninja clan and sold thier services to the highest bidding \nDaimyo blah blah blah.\n\nBased on what you wrote, it appear that at worst Turnbull is a poor, \nunskilled historian, and at best a slacker: \n&quot;...and don&#39;t want to dirty their hands by writing something, heaven \nforbid, for  the average reader. If  more did so and Turnbull had \nmore competition to deal with then perhaps his books would be better.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;Mikiko Letham&quot; &lt;mickey.letham@n...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Turnbull seems to be everybody&#39;s favorite punching bag. I agree \nwith a lot\n&gt; of what&#39;s been said. My own complaint about him is that most of his \nbooks\n&gt; are essentially the same e.g a survey history of the samurai. To \nstand up\n&gt; for him at least he writes about the samurai in a clear and \ninteresting way.\n&gt; Yes his books have some errors and sloppy research. However most of \nthe\n&gt; material seems accurate enough. I also have the rekishi gunzo \nseries (about\n&gt; 40 of them), plus the Visual Nihon Rekishi series, Saigen Nihonshi, \nSengoku\n&gt; Hao, and the Sengoku Chronicle, all of these confirm most of what&#39;s \nin\n&gt; Turnbulls books. Unfortunately most other &#39;scholars&#39; in Japanese \nhistory are\n&gt; more interested in &#39;fractal spatiality in the provincial rice \nfields of the\n&gt; bakufu&#39; and don&#39;t want to dirty their hands by writing something, \nheaven\n&gt; forbid, for  the average reader. If  more did so and Turnbull had \nmore\n&gt; competition to deal with then perhaps his books would be better.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: kitsuno &lt;cewest@s...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2002 7:43 AM\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Turnbull (Was Sekigahara)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ...And what was the &#39;furjimura&#39; issue?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;Mark E.

Stanley Ambrose and Michael\n&gt; &gt; Besailles\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are two that have come under intense media scrutiny for \nplagiarism\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; falsification/errors.  And then there was the whole Fujimura \nscandal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here in Japan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later, MEH\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
