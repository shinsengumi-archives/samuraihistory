The only problem is that any information seems to stop after \nKuki Yoshitaka&#39;s victory in the second battle of Kizugawaguchi and \nHideyoshi&#39;s release of his anti-piracy edict.  I need to know what \nhappened to the Murakami in the time between their defeat, and \nTokugawa&#39;s rise to power.  Did they cease to exist as a naval power \naltogether?  Also, any information on naval battles in the Seto area \nduring that time, especially those involving the Murakami, Kuki, or \nMori, would be useful. \n   I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve exhausted all of my resources on this, any help \nwould be tremendously appreciated. \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
