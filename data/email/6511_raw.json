Convenient too! What about naginata - did\nthey largely disappear amongst retainers and ashigaru after the Gempei\nWars, to be replaced by yari?\n\nCheers\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- russcat9 &lt;snowcat9@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How late into the 15thC (or beyond) would it be\n&gt; &gt; feasible for samurai\n&gt; &gt; armies or contingents of feudal lords to still be\n&gt; &gt; wearing armour &\n&gt; &gt; using weapons more common to the earlier Muromachi\n&gt; &gt; period, say\n&gt; &gt; 1350-1450? ie o-sode and transitional\n&gt; &gt; o-yoroi/haramaki, with naginata\n&gt; &gt; and bow, but few or no yari etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And if feasible, what would be the likely reasons?\n&gt; \n&gt; Most of my information comes from Bottomley and\n&gt; Hopson, or from Turnbull--neither of which are in\n&gt; front of me right this second. However, I think it&#39;s\n&gt; perfectly feasible for samurai to be wearing older\n&gt; pieces up until the end of the Sengoku. Reasons would\n&gt; include a. the ability to show off possesion of an\n&gt; antique armor or b. inability to buy something better.\n&gt; In case a you&#39;re looking at upper level daimyo that\n&gt; may not ever be in combat, so it&#39;s nice to look\n&gt; pretty. In case b, he probably can&#39;t afford anything\n&gt; more, so he&#39;s making due with battle spoils or cheaper\n&gt; old stuff. \n&gt; \n&gt; Make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
