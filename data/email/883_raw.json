The helmet is tall with a slight \n&gt; bend towards the top, with a sun disc on either side, in front of \nthe \n&gt; helmet, is a round disc with writing on it. does anyone know what \n&gt; this dsic represents and what the writing on the disc means,? Does \n&gt; anyone know where I might be able to find a photo, either in a book \n&gt; or on the web? your help would really be appreciated, any help at \n&gt; all. Thank you.\n\n\n\n"
