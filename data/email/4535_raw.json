Most of their games are the &quot;Pokemon&quot;\n&gt; crowd...ages 5-13. They realized they couldn&#39;t compete\n&gt; with Xbox and PS2, so went for a different market.\n&gt;\n&gt; My advice, having played both systems (and owning\n&gt; neither, so I&#39;m not biased) is to a. buy an XBOX if\n&gt; you want better graphics, b. buy a PS2 if you want\n&gt; better games, c. wait for the new PSX to come out in\n&gt; Japan, or d. check what&#39;s available for Gamecube when\n&gt; you get to Japan this summer. They might have some\n&gt; better releases in Japan than in the US--that&#39;s where\n&gt; I bought my best PS1 games, that I wish I still had\n&gt; the player for. Oh well.\n&gt;\n&gt; One warning on d., I had to get a chip put into my\n&gt; american player to play asian games--don&#39;t know if\n&gt; Gamecube is the same.
