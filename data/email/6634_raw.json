Katsura kogoro (Kido Koin) \nacting for Choshu&#39;s interests was seen as a powerful personality \ninfluencing the court and Satsuma Loyalists in the capitol saw \nthemselves as floundering and in need of a leader. They banded \ntogether and pushed Hisamitsu to bring Saigo back or threatened group \nsuicide. Faced with their determination Hisamitsu gave permission for \nthem to petition the Han Government for his pardon.\n\n&quot;Sayu mina kashiko nari to iu ka. Shikaraba sunawachi gumai no \nHisamitsu hitori kore wo saegiru no wa koron ni arazu. Yoroshiku \nTaishiko no kessai wo koubeshi.&quot;\n\n&quot;With everyone, left and right, saying this is just(wise). I, \nHisamitsu, would be blind or a fool to adhere to my own council. You \nmay submit your request to the Prime Minister (Taishiko)&quot;\n\n\tIn this case the &quot;Prime Minister&quot; was Tadayoshi who was left \nin charge of Han administration back in Satsuma. The story goes that \nwhen Hisamitsu heard the news that Saigo was released he was so \nangered by his men&#39;s loyalty to the charismatic Takamori, that he bit \nfirmly into his silver tobacco pipe leaving a deep mark...\n-t\n\n"
