I&#39;ve been a member of the group for about\n&gt; 3 years now (although I don&#39;t post many messages) and I am always\n&gt; surprised by the members of this group.  Not only do we have the\n&gt; great Anthony J. Bryant, but Nate Ledbetter, Kitsuno, Tom Helm, Cepo,\n\nOoooh... Ahem... I am honored, but -truly- I am just a beginner. :o)\nI&#39;ll join the club for good, once I get my MA, in some 18 months.\nFor now... study, study, study...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; and Prof Letham are all experts that I am honored to learn from. I\n&gt; read the daily digest sent to my home email with great anticipation.  \n&gt; Thank you all (there are many that I did not mention).  This is the\n&gt; best group on the web.\n\nWhat I can say for sure is that there are a lot of people with a lot of \nenthusiasm, knowledge, tolerance (usually!) and different interests. \nReally pleasant to be here! :oD\n\n&gt;\n&gt; On with my question.  It has 2 parts. \n&gt; First, I have seen some famous statue photos of Masashige Kusunoki. \n&gt; It is a huge bronze statue of the man, powerfully posed, on a huge\n&gt; horse.  It seems to capture a strength that not many other statues of\n&gt; this type reveal.  I&#39;d like to see it myself but I don&#39;t know where\n&gt; it is at.  I&#39;m living in Tokyo, and I know it&#39;s somewhere around\n&gt; here.  Anyone know exactly where it is?\n\nI believe it&#39;s just outside the Imperial Palace garden - if I remember \nwell.\n\n&gt; Second, does anyone who has visited the statue have other pictures of\n&gt; it?  I&#39;d like to get a small collection of photos so that I can make\n&gt; a painting.  The staue would be a reference for the horse mainly but\n&gt; I&#39;d like to capture the strength of the samurai in it as well.\n\nI&#39;ll send you a couple in private - I have a collection of pix \ndownloaded from the net, I am sure I have a few of thst statue. By the \nway, I don&#39;t remember when (probably Taisho period or so...) but that \nvery statue was on a Japanese currency bill.\n\nBye!!\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
