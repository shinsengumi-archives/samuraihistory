And \n&gt; also, if memory serves, a &quot;father-son&quot; relationship\n&gt; then I don&#39;t think was \n&gt; what it is now.  A person could adopt anyone and\n&gt; call that person their son, \n&gt; regardless of their age.  Did not Nobunaga himself\n&gt; &quot;adopt&quot; someone at one point?  \n&gt; Like the &quot;sister&quot; that married Takeda Katsuyori? \n&gt; Just wondering.  I&#39;d like to \n&gt; clear that issue up, now that it&#39;s been raised.  :-)\n&gt;  Thanks for any further \n&gt; help!  :-)  Maybe it&#39;ll help in later writing.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
