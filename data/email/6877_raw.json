The ginkaku-ji wasn&#39;t meant to be covered\n&gt; &gt; in silver. The \n&gt; &gt; name merely alludes to the Kinkaku-ji, that might\n&gt; &gt; explain the \n&gt; &gt; misconception. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s a myth that even the Ginkakuji may at\n&gt; times perpetuate, depending on who you ask. Apparently\n&gt; another poster got a different answer than I did. But,\n&gt; I still believe it&#39;s simply a comparison between the\n&gt; two, since the buildings are so similar. \n&gt; \n&gt;  In the\n&gt; &gt; second month of \n&gt; &gt; the third year of Bunkyu (1863), nine men, followers\n&gt; &gt; of the Shinto \n&gt; &gt; zealot Hirata Atsutane, broke into the Toji-in [a\n&gt; &gt; temple in Kyoto] \n&gt; &gt; and removed the heads of the statues of the first\n&gt; &gt; three Ashikaga \n&gt; &gt; shoguns: Takauji, Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu. They\n&gt; &gt; then exposed the \n&gt; &gt; heads on a bank of the Kamo river, following the\n&gt; &gt; common practice at \n&gt; &gt; this time of &#39;patriots&#39; exposing for all to see the\n&gt; &gt; heads of men \n&gt; &gt; accused of being traitors. Beside the heads of the\n&gt; &gt; three shogun, \n&gt; &gt; placards were set up enumerating the crimes of each.\n&gt; &gt; Yoshimitsu&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; acceptance of the title of King of Japan made him\n&gt; &gt; the worst traitor \n&gt; &gt; of all.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is also when Takauji becomes a villain in the\n&gt; eyes of many Japanese, since he essentially\n&gt; back-stabbed the imperial attempt to seize power from\n&gt; the Kamakura bakufu. I do find it interesting that you\n&gt; don&#39;t find any reference to Yoritomo&#39;s &quot;head&quot; being\n&gt; stuck anywhere. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
