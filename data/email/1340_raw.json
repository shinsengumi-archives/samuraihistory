From \nwhat little I&#39;ve read on the actual man, he was born in 1606 to a sword \ninstructor in the Tokugawa government, and himself grew to be a great \nswordsman.  From that same source (an on-line edition of a Japanese magazine, \nwhich one I am not sure), he died in 1650, possibly in either a battle or a \nduel.\n  By the way, I&#39;ve got a question of my own: Does anyone know where I can \nfind out more about Saiga (or Saigo) Magoichi?\n\nLater.\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
