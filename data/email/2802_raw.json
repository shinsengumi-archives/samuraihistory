Simply by being fiction, it&#39;s\nnot history. What bothers myself, and Tony, and\nothers, is when things that are simply WRONG are\nperpetuated. For example, the samurai in the Satsuma\nRebellion did NOT fight with bows against a modern\narmy with firearms--as has been stated, the Japanese\nhad been using firearms for several centuries, and the\nSatsuma army had firearms, wore &quot;uniforms&quot;, and wasn&#39;t\nthis Sengoku style army. Though that makes for better\ncinematography and wins you Oscars for costume design,\nso accuracy loses to spectacle. \n\nThe problem isn&#39;t with the STORY--heck, if we can\naccept Shogun, we can accept anything. It&#39;s the\ndetails that are flat WRONG, and perpetuate the myths.\nThat&#39;s what is so frustrating. I&#39;ll go see the movie,\nand I might even enjoy it, but I will not understand\nwhy you can&#39;t make a good movie that&#39;s not a bunch of\ncliches and hogwash.\n\nNate\n\n\n\n--- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 9, 2003, at 6:16 PM, Kyle Segall wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Anthony J.\n&gt; Bryant&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ajbryant@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nate Ledbetter wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tony--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have you seen it? I could care less what some\n&gt; wannabe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ninja turtle thinks about it. What did you\n&gt; think about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it? I haven&#39;t seen it yet--I&#39;ll be going on\n&gt; Friday.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some more important things (like seeing my\n&gt; wife for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first time in 6 months) have been taking\n&gt; up my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No, I&#39;ve not seen it yet. I don&#39;t know when (or\n&gt; whether) I&#39;ll go.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel very much about it the way I do\n&gt; Braveheart: a horribly\n&gt; &gt; flawed film from a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; historical perspective which, frankly, I wish\n&gt; had never been made.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been able to sit through an entire Braveheart,\n&gt; either.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tony\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I dunno Tony, I mean, come on, are you going to\n&gt; hate Star Wars just\n&gt; &gt; because lightsabers and hyperspace and sound in\n&gt; space are all\n&gt; &gt; impossible? It bugs me too when people take stuff\n&gt; like Highlander\n&gt; &gt; and the Last Samurai and Glory and are suddendly\n&gt; historical experts.\n&gt; &gt; But there&#39;s something to fantasy and fiction, and\n&gt; I mean, Braveheart\n&gt; &gt; and The Last Samurai, while being historically\n&gt; innaccurate, are\n&gt; &gt; pretty good movies.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would push it even a bit further. I do not believe\n&gt; they are \n&gt; &quot;inaccurate.&quot; Inaccurate would be something that\n&gt; wants to be \n&gt; historically accurate but it&#39;s not. Here we talk\n&gt; about plain historical \n&gt; FICTION. The two main characters of &quot;The Last\n&gt; Samurai&quot; are NOT \n&gt; historical characters, so, to expect accuracy is a\n&gt; paradox. This is a \n&gt; major Hollywood production that entertains for a\n&gt; couple of hours, and \n&gt; that&#39;s it. It has been done to make $$$, and\n&gt; features one of the most \n&gt; popular actors in the world. It&#39;s not a cult-movie\n&gt; for a bunch of \n&gt; scholars of the samurai. So, take it or leave it,\n&gt; but if we criticize \n&gt; the movie, we should do so thinking of what the\n&gt; movie IS, not what we \n&gt; would like the movie TO BE.\n&gt; cepo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
