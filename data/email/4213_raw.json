I was more\ninto the European campaign.\nAnyway, with my humble opinion, first of all, the\nJapanese soldires were cut off from their mainland\nonce the Americans started to gain the naval and air\nsuperiority. There was no way to transfer their units\nback to the main strategical points fast enough. They\nalso underesmated the American industrial power which\nenabled her to replenish what was lost in the Pearl\nharbor.\n\nAs for the room for the diplomacy, I doubt that\nneither Americans nor the British accept any terms\nother than the unconditional surrender. One point can\nbe made with an analogy with Italian surrender,\nHowerver there were more military and political values\nfrom securing the Italian surrendor such as the\nlogistical surplus for the Eastern frontier, the\npostwar control of the Eastern Europe, and etc. The\npresence of the democratic Chinese government\nprobabily did not cause any alarm to Americans with\nregard to the political composition of the Asian\ncountries after the war.\n\n\n\n\n                           \n                           Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n&gt; Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There was NO WAY the\n&gt; Japanese could \n&gt; control and man such a vast area. After Guadalcanal,\n&gt; then, it was clear \n&gt; that the wind had changed, still there was room for\n&gt; diplomacy, either \n&gt; with the US and perhaps with what was left of China\n&gt; and the Soviets. \n&gt; But the Japanese kept fighting and dying until\n&gt; August 1945.\n&gt; Why?\n&gt; I have my own theories, but before throwing them on\n&gt; the table, I&#39;d love \n&gt; to hear from some of you.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; cepo\n&gt; PS= subquestion; is the &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; a good\n&gt; movie?
