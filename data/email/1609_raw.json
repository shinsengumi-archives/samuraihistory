This was partly started by\nHattori Hanzo, a  senior ninja from Iga who worked for\nIeyasu and is recorded in many texts as a Samurai. He\nwas himself killed by Ninja from the Fuma Ryu while\ntrying to arrest the head of that tradition.\n\nThe Iga and Koga no mono (another name for ninja)\nended up working for the Tokugawa, there duties were\nmainly security or police style duties. In fact one fo\nthe gates at the Emperoros castle in Tokyo is called\nHanzo mon (Hanzo&#39;s gate).\n\nIt is well recorded the Koga and Iga became gardeners\nin the castle as well. where better to have your\nsecret men than right under the noses of your people\nand also where you can see them daily. It was partly\nbecause of these duties that they slowly stopped there\nninja style practises. You dont need to know how to\nhide in the snowor break into a house when your\nplanting marigolds all day.\n\nDonn Roley is a member of the Bujinkan and lives in\nJapan, he has got a name for himself for researchinmg\nreal ninja history he wrote this article on the Koga\nninja which is excellent\nhttp://www.shinden.pp.fi/kogaryuhistory.html\n\nI also know of no incident where someone inserted his\nsword into the ground and made an oath that Iga ninja\nwould no longer practise. One man would not be able to\nspeak for all of the different traditions. This sounds\nlike a scene out of some movie to me.\n\nts sort of like shimizu soke of the Yagyu shingan\nsaying no one in japan is permitted to study sword\nnow. I think Otake of the Katori shinto Ryu would\nlaugh at him and so would the others. Ninjutsu did and\nhas survived to this day but not as it was. There are\nmany ancient ryu which still maintain tiny elements of\nNinpo, even Ryu like the Katori shinto Ryu list it in\nthere curriculum.\n\ni suggest you go back and ask again about the origin\nof the story\n\npaul (not richard)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Me�al_Mikit_St�r-ljon_Oddhinsson\n&lt;medhal8@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nHi Richard\n\nMessage: 9\n   Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2003 09:52:52 -0800 (PST)\n   From: Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: IIGA and Koga\n\nHI\n\nWhat war are you refering to there were many in\njapanese history and several which involved Iga and\nKoga people\n\nPaul\n---------\nI refer to the final one.\nMy former Sensei of Shugendo told me that there was a\nwar between IIga and\nKoga clan that ended with the death of the patriarch\nof the Koga Clan (or\nwas IIga?) and the subsequently extintion of the clan\nand the style of\nNinpo. Then IIga Clan Master inserted his sword on the\nsoil and take the\noath that IIga would no longer continue teaching the\nart of Ninpo and thus,\nin this way both IIGA and Koga ended their existences,\nat least as Ninpo\nClans.\n\nIt is difficult to find online reference or books with\nsuch aspects of\njapanese history. Ya knows... Ninpo issue tend to be\nvery secretive... &lt;=o(\n\nOctavio Augusto\n\n\n\nYahoo!
