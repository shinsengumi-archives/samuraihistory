However, there are several things that you \nshould take into account when writing your book. One is that chain mail \nplays much less of a role in Japan than it did in England and France. \nThe other is what exactly is this girl doing with a military equipment \nand why? Here you should pick your time period with a bit of care. A \nlot of the legendary female soldiers come from the time of about the \nGenpei War or the rather earlier early Imperial period. Finally, are \nyou more interested in writing a generic North American story dressed \nup in Japanese finery, or are you interested in exploring more \ntypically Japanese motivations?\n\n\n\n\n"
