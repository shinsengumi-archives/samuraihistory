(although he did kill his son \nYoshinobu) I researched this fairly thouroughly at the library, and \nthis is what I found, basically cut and pasted right from what I \nadded about it to the Takeda Shingen bio.  Shingen was actually one \nof the few that let his father live, from what I can tell:\n\n&quot;In 1541 Harunobu suddenly rebelled, supported by a great many of \nhis father&#39;s retainers. Nobutora submitted with little bloodshed and \nHarunobu exiled his father to Suruga. In this act he had the aid of \nthe top Takeda retainers, many of whom held personal grudges against \nNobutora or at least saw some gain in assisting the young usurper to \npower. Nobushige, for his part, seems to have borne his brother no \nill will, and became a valued retainer. Sources conflict on what the \nexact events where which led to the replacement of Nobuhide with \nHarunobu. One version of events is that in the 5th month of 1541, \nNobutora and Harunobu went on a campaign together to attack Unno \nMunetsuna in Shinano province. Unno Munetsuna lost and fled the \nprovince, and by the 4th day of the 6th month, they were on thier \nway back to Kai. However, on the 10th day of thier trip back to Kai \nprovince, Harunobu suddenly rebelled in a coup supported by his \nashigaru and retainers, forcing Nobutora to flee to Suruga Province, \nand in to the care of his daughter&#39;s husband, Imagawa Yoshimoto. \nThis generally follows the Koyogunkan, which essentialy states that \nHarunobu uncovered a plot by Nobutora to dispose of him and \neventually give control of the Takeda clan to his younger brother, \nNobushige. According to the Koyogunkan, Harunobu and loyal vassals \ndrove Nobutora out of Kai province into Suruga. Another version of \nevents states that during the 6th month of 1541, Harunobu and \nNobutora travelled to Suruga province to visit upon Nobutora&#39;s son \nin law, Imagawa Yoshimoto. Little did Nobutora know, Shingen and \nYoshimoto had a secret agreement, and upon arrival, Nobutora was \nforcibly retired to Suruga castle, and his son Harunobu was given \ncontrol of the Takeda clan. Although what really happened is not \nclear, historians seem to be in agreement that Imagawa Yoshimoto had \na hand in the removal of Nobutora. Regardless , Harunobu took \ncontrol of the clan in what is often specifically cited as \na &#39;bloodless coup&#39;.&quot;\n\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/shingen.html\n\n\n\n\n"
