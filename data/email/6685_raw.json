This may include\ngen=\r\nius in warefare, administration or simply how successful they were. \nI know=\r\n Ieyasu was the eventual unifier of Japan but is that simply\nbecause of his=\r\n superiority over the other two leaders or because of\ntheir unfortunate cir=\r\ncumstances, i.e. Nobunaga dying untimely at the\nhands of his vassal and Hid=\r\neyoshi having no family name or title able to\nbe passed on etc? Likewise ho=\r\nw much was Ieyasu&#39;s success in creating the\nTokugawa Shogunate owed to the =\r\nprevious two sengoku jidai leaders?\n\nCharlie Carroll\n\n\n\n\n"
