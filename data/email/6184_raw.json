One is \nthe availabilty of 15mm Korean cavalry and in=\r\nfantry figures from Eureka \nminiatures in Australia.  \n\n    The other is a =\r\nseven part series on the Korean army by Rob Morgan which \nwas published in =\r\nthe Arquebusier (a British journal dedicated to the \nRenaissance period).\n\n=\r\n    I have collected a list of references on the Imjin War, which is below.=\r\n  \nI actually need to add to it, which I will do over the holidays and then=\r\n I&#39;ll \npost them to the group&#39;s archives.\n\n    I did find a reference on th=\r\ne Internet to an upcoming Korean movie about \nthe Japanese invasion.  Here =\r\nis what the blurb said:\n\n&quot;SOLDIERS OF HEAVEN. (&quot;Cheon-gun&quot;) A group of sold=\r\niers from North and South\n\nKorea are caught in a timewarp and swept back to=\r\n 1592 and find themselves in\n\nthe middle of the Imjin War. The cast include=\r\ns Park Jung-hoon, Kim\n\nSeung-woo, Hwang Jeong-min and Kong Hyo-jin. The pro=\r\nduction company, Sidus,\n\nhas budgeted around 8 million dollars on this proj=\r\nect which will be filmed\n\nby new director Min Jun-gi. Filming began on July=\r\n 20 and there is an\n\nestimated release sometime in April 2005.&quot;\n\n    I just=\r\n hope it gets released with English subtitles.  If it shows a lot \nof Korea=\r\nn soldiers I could use it as a painting guide for when I finally buy my \nKo=\r\nrean army.\n\n    If you know of any other references in English about this w=\r\nar, please let \nme know.\nI&#39;m especially interested in finding colour illust=\r\nrations of Korean troops.\n\n    I&#39;ve listed a booklet by the Korean Defense =\r\nDepartment below that I would \nespecially like to get a copy of.\n\nBob Burke=\r\n\n\nReferences for Japanese Invasion of Korea\n\n    =E2=80=9CThe Book of Corre=\r\nctions, Reflections on the National Crisis During the \nJapanese Invasion of=\r\n Korea, 1592-1598=E2=80=9D, by Yu Songnyong (translated by Choi \nByonghyon)=\r\n, Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, \nCal=\r\nifornia, 2002.\n\n    =E2=80=9CIn the Field as a Kitten - In the Castle as a =\r\nTiger=E2=80=9D, by Rob Morgan, \npublished in various issues of the Arquebus=\r\nier.\n\n    Part 1: =E2=80=9CThe Signal Gun?
