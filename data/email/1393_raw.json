I&#39;ve looked at all the genealogies that I have, in\nRekishi Gunzo, Saigen Nihonshi, Visual  Nihonshi. While they give extensive\ninfo on children they almost never give any info on who was the mother. I\nhave the names of all the sons of Nobunaga but the daughters are just listed\nas &#39;onna&#39;. Even more frustrating is that  even when they do they often\nidentify the mother as simply the daughter of some family without giving her\npersonal name.However in issue #20 of the rekishi gunzo series there is a\ndiscussion of Nobunaga and Nohime (Saitos daughter). It says there are\ndifferent and conflicting records as to the matrilineal of some of nobunagas\nchildren. It does say that Nobutata and Nobuo were the sons of &#39;a daughter\nof the Ikoma&#39;. Interesting to note Nohime&#39;s mother was the daughter of\nAkechi Mitsustugu (not sure of the pronunciation) who was Akechi Mitsuhides\ngrandfather.\n\nIf it helps I have this info about Nobunagas children;\n\nFuyuhime married Gamo Ujisato\nGotoku m. Matsudaira nobuyasu\nHidekastu adopted by Hideyoshi\nKastunaga adopted by Takeda Shingen\n&#39;onna&#39; married Takigawa Kazumasa\n&#39;onna&#39; m. Tsutsui Sadatsugu\n&#39;onna&#39; m. Maeda Toshinaga (Taiga drama had her as Nobunagas 4th daughter and\nby the name of Eihime)\n&#39;onna&#39; m. Niwa Nagashige\n&#39;onna&#39; m. Hideyoshi\n&#39;onna&#39; Mizuno Tadatane\n&#39;onna&#39; m. Sanjo Akizane\n&#39;onna&#39; m. Madenokouji Mitsufusa\n&#39;onna&#39; m. Tokudaiji Sanefuyu\n&#39;onna&#39; m. Takeda Kastuyori\n\nas for Takeda I have 7 boys and five girls\n\nYoshinobu (this is the only one i am sure was born from Sanjo)\nNobuchika (who became the priest Ryobo)\nNoboyuki\nKastuyuri\nMorinobu (?)\nNobuzane\nNobukiyo\nThe girls names I have as their nuns name\nObouin m. Hojo Ujimasa\nKenboin (?) m. Anayama Umeyuki (?)\nMayuhime (?) m. Kiso Yoshiaki (?)\nAhime (?) m. Uesugi Kagekastu\nMatsuhime m. Oda Nobutada\n\nThe ? indicate where I am not sur of the pronunciation. I don&#39;t have to tell\nyou that when I state &#39;married&#39; it doesn&#39;t nescesarily mean &#39;wife&#39; Its just\nfor convenience\n\n\n"
