I have never seen that b4, thank you for that little bit of info.. according to the articles and such that I have read, that is how it was done.. Ive often wondered about it bcos in order to stamp the blade like that, youd hafta heat it up again, which could possibly mess up the temper.. perhaps the smith is the one who places the gold into the tang?? unfortunately I dont know now where I read that, but I have read it in more than one place, if I come across it again I&#39;ll let you know..\n  Wilson\n\n\n  --\n\n  --------- Original Message ---------\n  DATE: Tue, 16 Dec 2003 06:00:18\n  From: &quot;Matthew E.

After that, it would be returned to the maker to be\n  stamped how well it held up, but it was mroe for a durability test than\n  a sharpness test, as any sharp blade could cut, but not every blade\n  would stay intact. Some may crack or even break entirely if the\n  craftsmanship was flawed.\n\n  Wilson\n\n\n  --\n\n  --------- Original Message ---------\n  DATE: Mon, 15 Dec 2003 12:13:27\n  From: Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Cc: \n\n  Actually the blades use to have a symbol for how many\n  bodies it could slice through which determined how\n  sharp it was.\n\n  --- Josh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Well AJ, I reckon its my turn *smacks his head on\n  &gt; the desk* How sharp is any blade??
