As they draw they swing up and \nback until the right angle is arrived at to rain arrows on \ntheir foe. \n\nThey do not hold the arrow at full draw, but release at the top \nof the arc.\n\nThere are some studies of exhumed bones from the period (when I \nthink all able-bodied men were obliged to do archery practice) \nthat suggest they suffered back injuries from the way they \ntrained and handled the bow.\n\nApart from Robin Hood (?) I don&#39;t think the bow ever became an \nheroic weapon, or rather I don&#39;t know of an English hero who \nwas an archer.\n\nThe samurai were, of course, followers of the &#39;Way of Horse and \nBow&#39;. They can hold the arrow at full draw, and they developed \ntechniques that worked with the physiology rather than against \nit.\n\n[Even though the bow was rapidly superceded by firearms in the \nWest, there was still strong support and even after Waterloo \n(1815) it was proposed that companies of archers could support \nthe muskets by continuing to fire whilst there was a pause in \nthe firing to reload after a volley.\n\nThe Brits however mastered the art of rapid load and fire, \nachieving (I believe) the fastest rate of fire in its day, and \neven up to WWI, the traditional &#39;five rounds rapid&#39; from bolt-action \nrifles convinced the Germans that the Brits were using light \nmachine guns.]\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
