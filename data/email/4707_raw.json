I will dig \nit up and\n&gt; send it to you if you are interested.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; All the info was from &quot;Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-\n1945&quot; by\n&gt; Hansgeorg Jentschura, Dieter Jung, and Peter Mickel. USNI Press \n1992.\n&gt; \n&gt; More info: Ordered for the Confederate States&#39; Navy as the Sphinx; \nlaunched\n&gt; 21 June 1864, completed 25 October 1864; bought by Denmark and \nrenamed\n&gt; Staerkodder, after being blockaded in Corunna by Federal warships \nSacramento\n&gt; and Niagara the sale was not completed, and she was renamed CSS \nStonewall;\n&gt; 1865 surrendered to Federal forces after which she was bought for \nthe\n&gt; Shoguns fleet. You have the rest of the info from this point. A \nnote of\n&gt; interest is that in Conway&#39;s All the World&#39;s Fighting Ships they \nstate that\n&gt; the reason for the US retaking ownership from the Japanese after \nthe initial\n&gt; purchase was because the Japanese simply did not yet have the \nfacilities to\n&gt; take care of her nor enough experience to crew her. Once the \nJapanese were\n&gt; ready they once again took possession and that is when she was \nrenamed\n&gt; Kotetsu.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other source for the above is Conway&#39;s All the World&#39;s Fighting \nShips\n&gt; 1860-1905.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want more details as to armament and type of armor \nmanufacture just\n&gt; let me know. Most you have already but there are some differences \nbetween\n&gt; Conway&#39;s, Jane&#39;s and Warship&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her sister the Prussian/German Prinz Adalbert: (Source-Conway&#39;s \n1860-1905\n&gt; German section)\n&gt; \n&gt; Dis: 1535 tons\n&gt; Dim: 186&#39; 8&quot; overall, 165&#39; 7&quot; at the waterline, 32&#39;6&quot; beam, 16&#39;6&quot; \ndraft.\n&gt; Mach: 2-shaft HSE, 1200ihp=10kts.\n&gt; Armor: Wrought iron, Belt 5&quot;, tower 4 ?&quot;.\n&gt; Armament: 1-120mm, 2-170mm.\n&gt; Crew: 130\n&gt; \n&gt; This ironclad ram originally known as Cheops, was under \nconstruction at\n&gt; Bordeaux for the Confederacy, to her builders design, together with \na sister\n&gt; ship Stonewall Jackson, later the Japanese Azuma. She was purchased \nfor the\n&gt; Prussian Navy in June 1865, but not put into service until a year \nlater. She\n&gt; was not a particularly good bargain, being a bad seaboat, and the \ntimbers of\n&gt; her composite hull rapidly fell prey to rot. Though the Prussians \nreplaced\n&gt; her original intended armament of three 32pdrs with bigger guns in \nthe\n&gt; five-ported bow position and in the two-gun octagonal citadel abaft \nthe\n&gt; funnel, she could not be considered a particularly powerful ship. \nShe was\n&gt; schooner rigged. She was placed in reserve because of wood rot as \nearly as\n&gt; October 1871, and disarmed in 1875/6.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gee, it feels good to be able to actually answer something here on \nthis\n&gt; list! ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; The first mentioned book is easily available while the older \nConway&#39;s are a\n&gt; little harder to find. If you are looking to get them let me know \nand I will\n&gt; point you in the right direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Bill M.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: M. R.
