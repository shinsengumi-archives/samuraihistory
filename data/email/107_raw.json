Very fruitful \n&gt; comparisons could be drawn between the development of \n&gt; European and Japanese castles, but their is no serious \n&gt; recent work available in translation. \n\nThat definately sounds fascinating - I&#39;ve never been to Europe but I \nhave seen the remains of numerous Japanese castles - - would the \ncomparable developments you are talking about be related to the \nphysical construction, the materials used, or to the layouts of the \ncastle itself, type of location the castle is situated at...?  I&#39;d \ndefinately be interested if you have any interesting thoughts or \ninsights on the subject.\n\nCEWest\n\n\n"
