Before moving to Japan I too \nbelieved katakana was only for foreign words, after all that&#39;s what my \nJapanese teacher in college said. You think &quot; there can&#39;t be THAT many \nforeign words in japanese. Memorize koohii and erebeta, it&#39;s easier.&quot; Then \nyou get to Japan. Japanese are honorable people but they don&#39;t play by the \nrules. ;)\n\nM.J. Peters\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ika is written only in hiragana. Katakana is usually reserved\n&gt; &gt;for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; words that did not originate in Japan or what we call borrowed\n&gt; &gt;words.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    &lt;sigh&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    No. I see &quot;ika&quot; written in katakana much more often than in\n&gt; &gt;hiragana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; though both (and kanji, for that matter) are possible. Japanese\n&gt; &gt;has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and preferences (one of which is the use of katakana\n&gt; &gt;for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; animals and plants) in terms of which script is most often used to\n&gt; &gt;write\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain words, but few strict rules; which script gets used often\n&gt; &gt; &gt; depends partly on the context the word is used in, and partly on\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; writer&#39;s preference.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
