Can anyone advise me as to the pro&#39;s, con&#39;s and quality of \n\nthese yari? Are they worth considering or are they better avoided?\n\n\n\nHere&#39;s the US source:\n\nhttp://www.casiberia.com/product_details.asp?id=SH2312\n\n\n\nIn the past nothing I&#39;ve seen from these folks has peaked my interest, \n\nuntil now. I confess that due to design and quality issues I&#39;ve not \n\nlooked at their stuff for years, but I&#39;d be happy to be pleasantly \n\nsurprised.\n\n\n\nPrice wise I&#39;ve seen these Yari on sale via UK websites from 230 - 450 \n\nGB pounds. So, does anyone know of a good UK supplier, just in case?\n\n\n\nYours\n\n\n\nDean\n\n\n\n-- \n\nDean Wayland\n\nHead Of The Fight School\n\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      \n\n    \n    \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\t \t   \t\t  \n_________________________________________________________________\nHotmail: Trusted email with powerful SPAM protection.\nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/177141665/direct/01/\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
