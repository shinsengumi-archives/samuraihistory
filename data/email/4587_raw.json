I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get \nbetter answers, but allow me to comment on one or two of your \nquestions.\n\n&gt;1) How long was the Uji bridge (width and length), or the width of \n&gt;the Ujigawa at this location?\n\nI don&#39;t know this. I do know that today the bridge is 155 meters \nlong.\n\n&gt;2) The map on page 26 is not very detailed. Where is the Byodo-in, in \n&gt;relation to the Uji bridge and the box representing Nara shown on the \n&gt;map? Does anybody have a more detailed map of the region with the \n&gt;places marked and the topography?\n\nI don&#39;t have the book so I can&#39;t refer to what you are seeing. In \nany event, if you can read Japanese this is a very servicable map:\nhttp://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/uji-web/map.html\n\nIf you can&#39;t read Japanese, then the Byoudou-in is in the lower-left \nhand corner of C4 (it&#39;s marked with a red dot that is also a \nhyperlink). The bridge (Uji Bashi) is right in the middle of C3. \n\n&gt;3) Turnbull states that the Minamoto forces at the battle numbered \n&gt;300. Does anybody know the composition of these forces? He does \n&gt;mention that some were monks. How many?\n\nAccording to the Tale of Heike, it was 1000. This is probably \ninflated just like most old histories are. It might have been closer \nto 50 samurai. But I&#39;ll leave the rest to the experts. :)\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
