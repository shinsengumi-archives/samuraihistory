I found your site while looking for my \nfamily history.I am very impressed and love this site. \n My ancestors were Samurai in Kanazawa, some were falconers.I was \nwondering if any one knows where I can find some sort of written \nhistory of the families who served Lord Maeda.(if any such records \nexist) \n&gt;  Shamefully I do not speak japanese so I am at a loss as to where \nto look besides the japanese sites.\n&gt;  The names of some of my ancestors are Tomiyoshi Uno, Ryu Uno, \nTakuo Uno, Mahiko Uno, Masamichi and Miyuki Uno, Kumemaro Uno, Yukio \nUno, Mitsuchika Uno, Toru Uno, Yoshiko Uno, Masu (Uno) Domoto, Tome \nUno, Tsuru Uno... Tome was the third wife of Tomimoto... Tsuru Sassa \nis the mother of Ryu.All are burried at Nodayama.\n&gt;  Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in \n&gt; advance and thank you for taking the time to read this.\n&gt;        Sincerly, M. Uno-Eischen\n\n\n\n"
