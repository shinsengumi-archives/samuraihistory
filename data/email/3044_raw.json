I throughly enjoyed it. \nThe movie is loosely based on the samurai revolt during the Meiji \nRestoration. During the 1860&#39;s three samurai lead efforts to restore \nimperial rule. However, one of the samurai wanted to modernize the \ncountry while the other two did not. The two samurai lead \napproximately 10,000 followers in revolt which lasted aproximately \nseven months. The revolt wasn&#39;t so much against modernization but \naginast the loss of status, power, food and wealth of the samurai.\n\nWayne\n\n\n\n"
