From the point of the Crusaders and those sending them -- at \nleast the ones with the power -- they were definitely honourable.  However, \nit must not go unsaid that there were probably people with cooler heads that \ndefinitely disagreed with them, which, in 20-20 retrospect, would have been a \nGood Thing.  (Genocide is ALWAYS a Bad Thing anyway, but that goes without \nsaying.)  If news of such atrocities had reached Japan, the Crusades and \nCrusaders, rightly, probably would have been seen as barbaric and inhuman.\n  Conversely, the warriors in Japan -- both the Samurai and the peasant \nsoldiers used by generals such as ODA Nobunaga -- were acting in ways that \nTHEY deemed honourable, and in the &quot;more enlightened&quot; west, were seen, if my \nmemoury serves me correctly, as &quot;heathen savages.&quot;\n  Anyway, that&#39;s my take.\n\nLater,\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
