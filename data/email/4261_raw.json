I&#39;ve found that Tenmu Tennou made a \nroyal proclamation (mikotonori) that said that men should &quot;put up \ntheir hair&quot;. While this is quite vague it could very well be the \norigins of the mage hairstyle amoung the ruling classes. Tenmu ruled \nin the late 7th century.\n\nThis is a piece of data that says that probably topknots (mage) were \nnot created by samurai in the 16-17th centuries with an eye to some \nbenefit in combat.\n\nOn Sun, 18 Apr 2004 07:25:16 +0100 (BST), Michael Lorimer\u001b$B$5$s\u001b(B wrote in message &lt;20040418062516.67797.qmail@...&gt;\n\n&gt; In the Edojidai, the topknot was common throughout society, with the \n&gt;shaved front more than likely a fashion decision for the \ntraditionally &gt;flambuoyant samurai.\n\nI agree in the main with what you&#39;re saying. But hairstyles \ninvolving shaving (strictly speaking, plucking of hair), either with  \nor without top-knots, were around long before the Edo jidai. As I \nmentioned, it&#39;s the accepted wisdom (again again it strikes me as \nurban myth) that part of the head being bald facilitated the wearing \nof the hats of the day - e-boushi and kanmuri. But like you, it \nstrikes me as essentially fashion.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
