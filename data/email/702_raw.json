The classic\n&gt; idea of Ninja however was \n&gt; a recent image that was most commonly used in the\n&gt; Kabuki plays of Tokugawa \n&gt; Japan from around 1700 onwards..Ninja were called by\n&gt; many various names, some \n&gt; of those including; Kusa (Meaning &#39;grass&#39; ...was\n&gt; used by the Hojo clan to \n&gt; describe the men), Iga no Mono meaning &#39;Men of Iga\n&gt; province&#39; was a general \n&gt; term for the warriors from Iga that could perform\n&gt; Ninja activities, Shinobi \n&gt; meant those using the Ninjutsu techniques either in\n&gt; infiltration or spying \n&gt; activities or in battle. Indeed there are many terms\n&gt; for those men/women used \n&gt; as Ninja by the warlords...Further &#39;proof&#39; if you\n&gt; need it is the existence of \n&gt; &#39;Ninjutsu&#39; techniques still contained in the\n&gt; syllabus of the oldest Japanese \n&gt; Martial art school the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto\n&gt; Ryu which took form in \n&gt; the 14th century and still contains the espionage\n&gt; teachings in its \n&gt; curriculum...And then there are the teachings used\n&gt; in Ryuha like the Bujinkan \n&gt; and Genbukan Ninpo Bugei that are said to be far\n&gt; older than the 1600&#39;s in \n&gt; their history...\n&gt;  There is NO doubt that men using &#39;Ninjutsu&#39; were\n&gt; used in Japan..The \n&gt; histories written at the time contain mention of\n&gt; them also. The only real \n&gt; &#39;debate&#39; here is whether to accept the modern idea\n&gt; of Ninja as the black clad \n&gt; super magician killer spies..This is however a very\n&gt; recent role given the \n&gt; Ninja to promote better audience attendance at\n&gt; Theatres in Japan and this \n&gt; translated well into modern film and\n&gt; television...Ninja are described as \n&gt; Samurai in the war tales..They wear the clothing\n&gt; that would help them to \n&gt; blend in and not be noticed by their enemy..They are\n&gt; often described as \n&gt; expert guides to the forests they lived in and are\n&gt; used as such by warlords \n&gt; in the tales..They possess knowledge of infiltration\n&gt; tactics and battle \n&gt; tactics that were required to win the battles or\n&gt; sieges they helped \n&gt; with..However they are most often called Samurai and\n&gt; I believe that it is \n&gt; most likely that a majority of them were men of\n&gt; great prestige in their own \n&gt; communities...leaders of men that commanded a force\n&gt; large enough to be a \n&gt; great help to those they supported.\n&gt;  Even the books written by these so-called &#39;Ninja&#39;\n&gt; are dated as being from \n&gt; the 17th century and at that time the term Ninja was\n&gt; in use by the authors of \n&gt; such books as the &#39;Bansenshukai&#39;, and &#39;Ninpiden&#39; for\n&gt; example, This proves \n&gt; beyond a reasonable doubt that there WERE those who\n&gt; accepted the name and \n&gt; title of Ninja.\n&gt;  Hope this helps to clear you on a few points..\n&gt;  websites to visit on this are; www.genbukan.com,\n&gt; www.ninjutsu.com, \n&gt; www.e-budo.com, or the best one at www.ninpo.org\n&gt;  Have fun.\n&gt;  Abayo.\n&gt;  Ben Sharples.\n&gt; *****Hi!, Thanx for the info...But i didnt need\nhistory info....just samurai pics thanx anyway........\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
