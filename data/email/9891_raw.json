Again, it contradicts some &quot;accepted h=\r\nistory&quot;... so fair warning.=A0 For example, it says that Toyotomi was actua=\r\nlly working as a spy for the Hachisuka in the beginning--- that he was not =\r\na peasant at all, but a low ranking samurai working as a spy. He was hired =\r\nby the Ikoma Family and it was Ikoma&#39;s daugher that introduce Toyotomi to O=\r\nda Nobunaga.\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 He worked with the Hachisuka and Maeno late=\r\nr on as a combination of soldier/spy. .. in fact, many of the samurai famil=\r\nies from the upper Owari area (the Hachisuka, Fukushima, Kawajiri, Kumazawa=\r\n, Nojiri, Nakagawa, Maeno=A0etc.etc) of northern Nagoya, Ichinomiya, Konan,=\r\n etc.etc---- most of their family history follows the &quot;spy&quot; version of the =\r\nstory--- not the &quot;peasant&quot; version..but then again, these families are know=\r\nn to have been spies themselves-- - so I guess that it makes sense.\n=A0\n=A0=\r\nSo, it is worth looking into to get a very different look on it all.\n\n--- O=\r\nn Wed, 4/8/09, kojalMtirta@ gmail.com &lt;kojalMtirta@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom=\r\n: kojalMtirta@ gmail.com &lt;kojalMtirta@ gmail.com&gt;\nSubject: [samuraihistory]=\r\n one night castle\nTo: samuraihistory@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Wednesday, Apr=\r\nil 8, 2009, 6:43 AM\n\nCan anybody tell me about the story of one night castl=\r\ne at sunomata which hideyoshi constructed.
