It helped me out a lot. I\n&gt; appreciated it greatly. I just have some problems with lasing the lames\n&gt; together. You said that this guy is on this list. Do you know what screen\n&gt; name he goes by? While I was on the site I e-mailed him and he still hasn&#39;t\n&gt; replied. Maybe you could help me with a easier way to learn how to lase the\n&gt; lames together. If you have any more info. it would greatly be appreciated.\n\n\nI was out of town over the week-end. If you e-mailed me over then, I probably \nkilled it accidentally when I got back and started wiping out the 300+ spam \nmessages that accumulated while I was gone.\n\nWhat was the question? There are lacing diagrams on the site... what do you want \nthat isn&#39;t there?\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
