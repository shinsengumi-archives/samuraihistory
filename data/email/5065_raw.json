The name was &#39;Kabima&#39;, a concoction \nfrom the names of my daughters, but on checking it out with a \nnative speaker, the word means something like &#39;mouldy cloth&#39; or \n&#39;mouldy clothes&#39; - not a good idea - if you&#39;re going to have \ncod Japanese names, better make sure you know what they \nmean.\n\n(As it stands now, the Toda existed, and a daughter did marry \nthe father of Tokugawa Ieyasu, but there&#39;s a couple of extra \nfamily members of my invention). \n\nRe places:\nI can&#39;t vouch for this, but I once had a discussion with an \navid fantasy reader who was amazed when I told him the plot of \na novel without having read it, because from the snippet he \ntold me I could see it followed the events of the Gempei War \n(1180-1185). The author had lifted the whole thing, changed the \nnames and location, and wrote a fantasy bestseller which \nno-one would identify with Japan.\n\n(As mine stands, I have to make guesses, although my study \nwall is plastered with maps, pictures, etc. and my wife has \nokay&#39;d a solo holiday in Japan for me!)\n\n***\n\nI think if you&#39;re going to base a fantasy on Japan, then you \nhave to identify what it is that you like, and transpose it to \nyour own world - and identify it with your world, not back to \nJapan - this is my opinion only, personally I put down &#39;Across \nthe Nightingale Floor&#39; for that very reason - it&#39;s neither one \nthing nor the other.\n\nLikewise &#39;The Last Samurai&#39; - it&#39;s a vehicle for Tom Cruise, \nand that&#39;s all it is. What realy jars is when they change not \nonly the culture but the ethos to suit. &#39;Zatoichi&#39; is a lot \nmore fun, just as much a fiction, but offers no offence to \nJapan (which TLS does before the opening credits have even \nfinished).\n\nMy own work stemmed from what I understood of the the \nsamurai and his arts, through my martial art practice and \nreading history - japanes ein translation - and the realisation that \nmost European fiction on the subject was grossly inaccurate.\n\nI wish I could write like James Clavell, but from a purist \nperspective Shogun is a crap book serving up the same old \nnonsense stereotypes that perpetuates a load of bull about \nSengoku Japan which people mistakenly assume to be \n&#39;historically accurate&#39;.\n\nI neither read nor write Japanese, so am massively limited if \nnot totally hamstrung, but I follow the Bernard Cornwell rule - \nI write what I&#39;d like to read, and what I like to read is based \non history and reality, not fantasy, so I do as much research \nas I can.\n\nAll that aside, good luck with the project,\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n"
