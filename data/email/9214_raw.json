At the risk of riling up the martial artists\nout there, the book definitely overplays the whole\nbujutsu/bushido thing. I&#39;m also not the only person\nwho&#39;s been critical of it--the book tries to come off\nas a samurai &quot;handbook&quot;, and is certainly not an\nacademic study. \n\nI wouldn&#39;t classify my feelings towards it as\n&quot;hate&quot;--it&#39;s simply a cog in the &quot;Bullshido&quot; machine. \n\n&gt; Um... what? Man, no wonder Hideyoshi couldn&#39;t take\n&gt; Korea, he didn&#39;t\n&gt; have enough Kiai-Bujin to yell at the enemy.\n\nNo further statements, your honor.\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nCheap talk?\nCheck out Yahoo!
