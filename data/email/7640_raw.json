In feudal times, the \nTokaido (the Eastern Sea Road) was the highway traveled between the \nold imperial capital, Kyoto, where the emperor lived, and Tokyo, \nwhere the shogun lived. \n\n&quot;Our tours do things that people couldn&#39;t do on their own. They just \nwouldn&#39;t have the opportunity,&quot; said tour representative Nancy \nCraft. &quot;For example, in Kyoto we visit the home of an international \ncalligraphy master who is a performance artist.&quot; \n\nWhile in Tokyo, participants will tour Sensoji Temple (also known as \nAsakusa Kannon Temple) and the Meiji Shrine; they&#39;ll visit the Edo-\nTokyo Museum and shopping districts, including the trendy Omotesando-\ndori area.\n\nThey&#39;ll also visit the Tsukiji wholesale fish market and Takashimaya \ngourmet market.\n\nThe next stop is Hakone, a resort area known for its mineral baths \nand home to several museums and an outdoor sculpture garden.\n\nThey&#39;ll take a cable-car ride to view Mt. Fuji and Owakudani Crater, \nreturning by boat on Lake Ashi.\n\nThey will travel along the coast to Ise, visit Ise-Shima National \nPark and tour Toba&#39;s Mikimoto Pearl Island. \n\nIn Kyoto, tour participants will stop at Ginkaku-ji (the Silver \nPavilion), Jodo Temple and several Zen monasteries. \n\nThey will attend a private traditional tea ceremony at the Moss \nTemple (Kokedera), where they will try the art of calligraphy and \ntour the moss gardens. \n\nCost: $5,150 per person, double occupancy ($1,050 single surcharge), \nincluding accommodations, most meals, train transportation, \nbilingual guides, admissions and excursions. International airfare \nis not included.\n\nContact: Esprit Travel & Tours, Los Angeles; (800) 377-7481, \nhttp://www.esprittravel.com . \n\n\n\n\n"
