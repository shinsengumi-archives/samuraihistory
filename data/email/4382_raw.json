I imagine the original jikki/nikki (diaries)\n&gt; have enough material in\n&gt; them for at least a dozen doctorates.   I&#39;m thinking\n&gt; here too of the\n&gt; surviving medieval English coronial enquiries into\n&gt; children&#39;s deaths.  Old\n&gt; Henry was wrong, history is fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry THomas.\n\nAs I said, most of it lead to simple definitions of\nthe word. The two diaries in question are from the\n1840&#39;s, which may or may not be interesting, depending\non your slant. Not my cup of tea, period wise, but a\ncomparison between then and, say, 1610 would be VERY\ninteresting, as far as whether or not the rulings\ndiffered according to time period. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\nhttp://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/\n\n"
