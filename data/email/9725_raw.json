You \ncould try \n&gt;   centuryfitness.com, they have a n=\r\new signature sword collection, \nand since it \n&gt;   is in dollars it would be=\r\n pretty cheap in \n&gt;   pounds. Also, I would give Bugei.com a try. Be warned=\r\n about \ncentury \n&gt;   though, their swords are not traditionally forged.\n&gt;  =\r\n DO NOT BUY A SWORD FROM CENTURY!!! The Signature Series is made \nby Hanwei=\r\n. \n&gt;   The rest is just junk. Bugei, also gets their swords from Hanwei. \nC=\r\nheck out \n&gt;   _www.casiberia.com_ (http://www.casiberia.com) . If you are \n=\r\nlooking for \n&gt;   replica&#39;s, Hanwei is the way to go. Not cheap, but a high =\r\nlevel \nof quality.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Greg\n&gt; \n&gt;   **************Planning your summer ro=\r\nad trip?
