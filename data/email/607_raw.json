The NYTIMES has given it coverage, but not sure if\n&gt; they are still free.  The issue has been discussed at length on the\n&gt; H-WAR list.  They have public archives at www.h-net.msu.edu (click the\n&gt; appropriate buttons to find H-WAR, and then just search the H-WAR list.\n&gt;\nWell maybe I should say I live in Japan AND have gotten pretty lazy about\nkeeping up with whats new.
