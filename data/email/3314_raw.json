The Court seems to have had quite a large\ninfluence, especially with pro-Joi sentiment, and\nclearly gives orders to the Bakufu in 1862/1863\nregarding expelling the foreigners in Japan. How/When\ndid the Court gain the power to give orders to the\nBakufu? I realize that the power was always there, so\nto speak, but the court hadn&#39;t done anything political\nsince Go-Daigo and the Nambokucho. Where did this\nCourt resurgence come from?&gt;&gt;\n\nI think most of it came when the Bakufu asked the court what do when Perry\ncame. It kind of threw the ball to the court and allowed certain court\nnobles and certain anti-bakufu Daimyo (namely Mito han) to start asserting\ncourt prerogative. This came on the heels of several decades of Kokugaku\nwhere several scholars in the late Tokugawa (Mabuchi, Norinaga,etc) were\npressing for the return of power to the throne or a least to themselves as\nrepresentatives of the throne.\n\n&lt;&lt;2. Same question re: Shishi. Totman talks about the\nShishi and the fact that many came from Choshuu and\nMito. Why all of a sudden were ronin all over the\nplace, and particularly from these two places? Did\nMori Yoshichika have a problem governing his han\n(Nagato/Choshuu) that necessitated letting go of\nsamurai? I&#39;m particularly confused about this.&gt;&gt;\n\nSome of this had to do with the economic conditions of the time. The Tempo\nyears saw a lot of budget tightening in the hans and a lot of lower samurai\nwere set free. It also came as a result of many lower samurai releasing\nthemselves from the restrictive hans out of frustration that they couldn&#39;t\nadvance. Sakamoto Ryoma was a perfect example of this.\n\n&lt;&lt;3. I know I probably just haven&#39;t gotten to it yet,\nbut so far (I&#39;m in 1864) the main players are bakufu\nofficials, Tozama daimyo like Shimazu Hisamitsu and\nMori, and the Court nobles. Where do these people\ndisappear to, and how come when we get to the actual\nrestoration the main players are people like Saigo\nTakamori (a retainer of the Shimazu, if I&#39;m correct)\nand Sakamoto Ryoma and so forth? Where do the daimyo\ndisappear to? I understand the bakufu officials--of\ncourse they get defeated or pushed aside or whatever.\nBut if, for instance, Saigo Takamori is a retainer of\nShimazu Hisamitsu, where is the break that he no\nlonger is a retainer and is directly working\ntowards/for Meiji restoration? &gt;&gt;\n\nOf course they were active at this time. Conrads book is told mainly from\nthe bakufu perspective so it looks like they aren&#39;t there but they are. The\nbakumatsu period had many actors working at the same time all over Japan.\n\n&lt;&lt;I know it&#39;s a lot, thanks for your patience. I&#39;m just\nfrustrated right now--NHK is a 10 min walk from my\nhouse, yet I can&#39;t seem to get it on my TV! No\nShinsengumi for me, sadly!!! &gt;&gt;\n\nGee too bad. So close and yet so far. Its on every Sunday night at 8\nrepeating next Saturday at 1:05. Its also on BS at 10:00. I&#39;m taping every\nepisode.\n\nWilliam\n\n\n"
