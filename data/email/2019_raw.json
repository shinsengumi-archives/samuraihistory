I have read it over at least 5 times and some of the stuff is very complicated, just because it is hard to understand. If anyone else has read Hagakure and has had this problem, please share what you find hard to understand because their is one such line that I cannot comprehend. &quot;The master took a book from it&#39;s box. When he opened it there was the smell of drying clovebuds.&quot; I find that hard to understand, because that is the only thing in the passage.\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
