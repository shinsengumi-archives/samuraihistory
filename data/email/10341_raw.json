Anybody with more than a cursory knowledge of the field=\r\n knows \nthat the Tokugawa at no time &quot;banned&quot; guns any more than they banne=\r\nd other \nweapons, and as Kitsuno said extensive armories were kept all arou=\r\nnd Japan for \nthe purposes of maintaining defense stockpiles. Efforts were =\r\nmade at procuring \nnew weapons, but as Japan was without external threat un=\r\ntil the 1800&#39;s, there \nreally wasn&#39;t any reason to pursue it with vigor. Pe=\r\nople who think Japan \n&quot;abandoned&quot; guns need to stop watching Tom Cruise mov=\r\nies. Noel Perrin was a \nliterature professor with no knowledge of Japanese =\r\nor Japanese history, writing \nwhat he wanted in order to bolster an argumen=\r\nt for gun control in the US. \nJapanese historians thought his work was a jo=\r\nke--I mean, they literally thought \nit was an attempt at humor. It shows ju=\r\nst how stupid people can be that his work \nhas had the unfortunate negative=\r\n influence it has had in creating this idealized \nyet completely incorrect =\r\nimage of Japan, and personally he should have been shot \nwith a replica tan=\r\negashima and all copies of his books burned as an affront to \nscholarship. =\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@sam=\r\nurai-archives.com&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sat, July 30, 2=\r\n011 2:14:37 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Japanese and American relation=\r\ns after Admiral \nPerry landed in Japan in 1854.\n\n   \nThere was definitely n=\r\not any sort of &quot;Bakufu renunciation of firearms&quot;.  That&#39;s \na myth that we t=\r\nackled in a prior podcast in fact:\n\nhttp://samuraiarchives.podbean.com/2011=\r\n/05/29/ep05-the-myth-of-samurai-giving-up-the-gun/\n\n\nMost han had gunnery i=\r\nnstructors, villages were licensed to use firearms to \nscare off or kill th=\r\nreatening animals, and guns were a necessity in various \nlocations due to i=\r\nntrusions from Russians in the far North and defense of ports \nin the South=\r\n.  To put it simply - there were no active wars, so technological \nadvancem=\r\nent of guns in Japan wasn&#39;t necessary, but guns weren&#39;t thrown away.  \nThe =\r\nbook &quot;Giving Up the Gun&quot; by Perrin is a joke, and has been ridiculed and \nl=\r\nambasted in the Western and Japanese scholarship for decades, but his book =\r\nis \nstill around because non-Japanese history experts still quote it.\n\n--- =\r\nIn samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robert McArthur&quot; &lt;rmcarthur@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Go here for info on a Japanese flintlock musket circa 1650, recently s=\r\nold at\n&gt; auction:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.proxibid.com/asp/LotDetail.asp?ahid=3D192=\r\n3\n&gt; &lt;http://www.proxibid.com/asp/LotDetail.asp?ahid=3D1923&aid=3D10979&lid=\r\n=3D2938009&gt;\n&gt; &aid=3D10979&lid=3D2938009\n&gt; \n&gt; Given the Tokugawa Bakufu&#39;s r=\r\nenunciation of firearms, my guess is that\n&gt; Flintlocks of any kind were mor=\r\ne on the order of a curiosity here or a\n&gt; presentation piece there, than an=\r\n attempt to acquire stocks of these weapons\n&gt; or to advance the science of =\r\nfirearms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robert\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____ \n&gt; \n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this mess=\r\nage have been removed]\n\n\n"
