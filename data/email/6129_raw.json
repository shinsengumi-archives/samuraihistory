In reality, the color was a very dark blue. \nBlack against black still casts an outline.\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: zevlord\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sunday, December 05, 2004 9:36 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Day of the Ninja?\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Anthony Bryant &lt;ajbryant@b...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; keiman0 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; They recommend doing good deeds, dress like Ninjas, etc. but\ndon&#39;t go\n&gt; &gt; wild in the streets.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s totally bogus. Everyone knows that the purpose of the ninja\nis to flip\n&gt; out and kill people.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n\n\nAcutely, Ninjutsu is a form of martial arts, which incorporate a lot\nof street fighting techniques, to be blunt dirty tactics. We are\ntaught that on the street anything can happen example, one person in\na park could confront you when all of a sudden three of his friends\nappear from behind. Anyway we have this technique called the win-win\nsituation, deal with one with quick blows then move on. Aiming to\nattack soft parts of the body (the groin, throat, arm pits. etc)\ndon&#39;t get me wrong that not all we are taught but is a significant\npart of the art.\nNow to deal with this Ninja day, Have never heard of it, checked out\nthe website and from what I can gather seems like a lot of rubbish to\nme. Will talk to my senses though and see if he knows anything about\nit. Thing is though, there was a large workshop on Sunday the 4th\nhear in Australia and no one mentioned anything about it\n\nZev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n      Yahoo!
