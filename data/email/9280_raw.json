They were under the service of and dedicated\n&gt; fully =\r\nto a daimyo or lord. most Were paid in rice, which was farmed by\n&gt; the unde=\r\nrclass which were not allowed to wear the swords. Any samurai\n&gt; who wished =\r\nto test out his new shinken or (real sword),for a price\n&gt; could cut down a =\r\ncriminal who had been caught as Japan had no prisons.\n&gt; Death was the custo=\r\nmary punishment for every offense. Sometimes\n&gt; samurai would cut down innoc=\r\nent people to test their steel if no one\n&gt; was looking but this was most li=\r\nkely not the norm. Samurai means to\n&gt; serve and a samurai was also called b=\r\nushi being the plural or bujin\n&gt; for one of them. Most of Japan&#39;s populatio=\r\nn consisted of lower class\n&gt; farmers however until later on in the history =\r\nwhen Japan began to\n&gt; adopt more western ways. Guns were introduced by the =\r\nfirst europeans\n&gt; but not given or sold to them one man made a sketch of on=\r\ne of the guns\n&gt; and within 6 months there were guns aplenty. The samurai ad=\r\nopted their\n&gt; use for a short time until they were considered dishonorable =\r\nand the\n&gt; samurai abandoned there use willingly. The use of a jo or staff w=\r\nas\n&gt; the weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and the main weapon of\n&gt;=\r\n the lower class to defend against the samurai. Then there were the\n&gt; Ninja=\r\n. This was an illegal occupation but Hattori Hanzo who was ninja\n&gt; is menti=\r\noned in the history as bushi. They were the spies and assasins\n&gt; of old jap=\r\nan and were hired out by a diamyo to obtain information or\n&gt; deal with an e=\r\nnemy lord. They employed many dishonorable tactics and\n&gt; devices including =\r\nthrowing venomous snakes on their foes. Samurai\n&gt; would stand and state the=\r\nir name and such before fighting in duels\n&gt; which usually lasted 30 seconds=\r\n or less.Ninja did not and snuk around\n&gt; and disguised themselves and such.=\r\n Ninja were more effective in combat\n&gt; than most samurai though and usually=\r\n acted alone. Slaying a sleeping\n&gt; army and other similar antics. Honor mea=\r\nnt everything to the samurai\n&gt; and they would not hesitate to commit hara k=\r\niri done with the\n&gt; wakizashi one would stick the blade into his gut with t=\r\nhe goal of\n&gt; cutting the spine from the front then another would end his su=\r\nffering\n&gt; with a beheading. Someone the former had chosen to assist him in\n=\r\n&gt; restoring his honor. A samurai could probably take down a charging\n&gt; bull=\r\n but I would not expect the could have tussled succesfully with a\n&gt; grizzly=\r\n bear.\n&gt;\n\n\nThat was bloody sensational.\n\n\n"
