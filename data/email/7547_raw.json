So, as you spoke about Turnbull and Samson \n(I don&#39;t have any of these books), and are explaining why their books \nmight include mistakes, I would be more than happy to have some help \nabout what books to choose to help me to understand Japanese history, \nhow reliable they are and maybe how to read them. I mean for what kind \nof info I might rely on them and for what kind of info I shouldn&#39;t. I am \nnot sure I am clear enough.\n\nI am more interested right now about Momoyama period and the whole \n&quot;reign&quot; of Hideyoshi, but, unfortunately I can only read in French or \nEnglish.\n\nThe books I got right now (please let me know if they include bad \ninformation):\n- Samurai: An Illustrated History by Mitsuo Kure;\n- 図録日本の甲冑武具事典 (I hope i am pasting the right letters);\n- Samurai Invasion by Turnbull\n- Samurai Sourcebook by Turnbull\n- The Cambridge history of Japan : vol 4 : early modern history.\n- Another book in Japanese about Oda nobunaga&#39;s followers (i was \nactually looking for the sengoku jinmei jiten but I went through this one).\n- Some books about various side topics which are not about what I am \nasking advice now (art, ethics and so on...)\n\nI know there is a &quot;recommended readings&quot; section on \nwww.samurai-archives.com , but without comments it is pretty hard for me \nto appraise books (and authors) quality. Sorry for such a broad \nquestion, but I guess several people might be interested too.\n\nSo, if you have any suggestions, I would be more than happy.\n\nJerome.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________________________ \nAppel audio GRATUIT partout dans le monde avec le nouveau Yahoo!
