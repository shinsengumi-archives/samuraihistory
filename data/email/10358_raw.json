While this is a=\r\n supplement for Killer Katanas, it is still a valuable source for anyone st=\r\nudying the period.\n\nThis book deals with the Imjin War, fought between the =\r\ninvading Japanese and the Ming and Choson Dynasties. Within the 90+ pages i=\r\ns Army organization and game rules for the Ming and Choson Armies under KK2=\r\n, game ratings for over 120 Ming and Choson leaders, supplemental siege rul=\r\nes that introduce the use of chinese siege engines, and seven scenarios wit=\r\nhn maps and complete orders of battle: Chungju, Imjin River, 2nd Pyong-yang=\r\n, Pyokje, Haengju, Chiksan, and Sachon. The book also includes Imjin War pl=\r\naying charts for KK2.\n \nA major part of the book deals with modeling the ar=\r\nmies of the period and contains seven black and white plates illustrating t=\r\nhe appearance of the Ming and Choson Armies, along with their flags. Accord=\r\ning to an email sent to me from Kenneth Swope, even he can&#39;t wait to see th=\r\ne finished product.\n \nNearly 10 years of research has gone into creating th=\r\nis book and much of the information inside it is being presented in English=\r\n for the first time. While intended for use with Killer Katanas 2, the book=\r\n is by no means limited to these rules, and the information inside can be u=\r\nsed for many other rule sets. This book is also valuable to any painter or =\r\nmodeler who is looking for uniform and flag information on the Ming and Cho=\r\nson Armies of the war.\n \nBy the way, the book has been created with assista=\r\nnce from Stephen Turnbull and Kenneth Swope.\n \nIf you are interested send a=\r\nn email to BBradford1973@.... You can also find the book under Heartbre=\r\naker28 at Ebay. \n\nArrigato,\n\nBrian\n\n\n"
