I could give you a \nbunch of english sources for &#39;fi=\r\nller&#39; in the bibliography (let me \nknow if you are interested).  \n\nI have a=\r\n bunch that mention it, although none with much detail.  One \nbook worthy o=\r\nf note though is &#39;The Military Revolution - Military \ninovation and the ris=\r\ne of the West 1500 - 1800&#39; by Geoffrey Parker.  \nAnyone interested in milit=\r\nary history should be required to read it.  \nAlthogh it focuses on the &#39;Wes=\r\nt&#39;, it also touches on Japan.  It \ncredits Nobunaga (and Japan) with being =\r\nat least 20 years ahead of \nEurope in the way guns were deployed for battle=\r\n.  It states, among \nother things, that the Japanese were more interested i=\r\nn improving \naccuracy, whereas Europe was focused on reload time, and Nobun=\r\naga&#39;s \nuse of riflemen in Nagashino in 1575 tackled both problems \n(apparen=\r\ntly the &#39;tanegashima&#39; were considered very accurate).  \nNobunaga&#39;s use of r=\r\nanks of men firing and moving back to reload wasn&#39;t \neven suggested in Euro=\r\npe until the 1590&#39;s, and apparently not put into \ngeneral use in Europe unt=\r\nil the 1630&#39;s.\n\nAs for Japanese sources, I have Bessatsu Rekishi Tokuhon 85=\r\n, &quot;Sengoku \nno Kassen&quot; Japan: Shin Jinbutsu =D4rai Co., 1998.  A solid two =\r\npage \ndescription of the battle, with those involved and battle stats is on=\r\n \npage 144 - 145.\n\nAnd Rekishi Gunzo #1, &quot;Oda Nobunaga&quot; has a few articles =\r\non Nobunaga&#39;s \nuse of guns, and info on guns in Japan in general, but doesn=\r\n&#39;t appear \nto have any specific info on Nagashino itself.\n\n\n"
