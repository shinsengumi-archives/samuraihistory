This book\n&gt; is about \n&gt; (probably) the worst shogun in Japanese history,\n&gt; Ashikaga Yoshimasa, \n&gt; who had a great impact on Japanese culture as it is\n&gt; known today. He \n&gt; was a patron for many Japanese artists. Whether No,\n&gt; cha-no-yu, \n&gt; calligraphy or Waka (for which Yoshimasa seems to\n&gt; have had a \n&gt; talent). The book doesn&#39;t mention that the\n&gt; Ginkaku-ji was supposed \n&gt; to be decorated (or covered) with silver. The name\n&gt; (according to \n&gt; Keene) merely is a &#39;reference&#39; (not sure about this\n&gt; term) to \n&gt; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu&#39;s Kinkaku-ji.\n\nWow, this is a reply to an old post. When I first\nlooked at it I didn&#39;t even realize it was a reply to\nme! \n\nActually, last time I went to the Ginkakuji (in June)\nI asked--as I thought, and as Prof Keene says, it&#39;s\nmerely a distinction between itself and the\n&quot;Kinkakuji&quot; , Rokuon-ji. There never were any plans to\ncover it in silver, much to the contrary of what\nguidebooks and Mr. Turnbull will tell you.\n\nNate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nMake Yahoo! your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n"
