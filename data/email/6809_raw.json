I found it really \nfascinating.\n\nAngus, I don&#39;t know where you live so can&#39;t help you much. Tales of \nthe Taira Clan and other films by Mizoguchi Kenji are in the British Film \nLibrary Sales Catalogue, along with some Kurosawa, Ichikawa etc. It&#39;s \nnot huge selection. They are around fifteen pounds - quite expensive. I \nactually live in South Australia and borrow these and other Japanese \nvideos  from the State Library. It&#39;s a great system.\n\nIt&#39;s a fine movie, set in the 12th century at the time when the bushi/\nsamurai are about to come to power, very beautifully filmed and acted. \nThe costumes, and art direction in general, are wonderful.\n\nI think Tales of the Yin-Yang Masters also gives a very good feel for \nHeian period settings and clothes etc.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n\n &gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
