I am an aficionado not just of Samurai history \nbut also of ancient warfare in general. I am a sansei, third \ngeneration Japanese-American who speaks Japanese fluently (but read \nvery little) and have lived in Japan for 18 years.\n\nI noticed that in studying classical Roman and Greek warfare, that \nthere is much information on group warfare: phalanxes, troop \norganizations, siege weapons, strategy, but little on individual \ncombat. \n\nConversely, in studying Japanese warfare (with English books) there \nare lots of info on individual combat but almost nothing on battle \nformations, battle strategy, and group warfare. I realize this is \nbecause traditionally Samurai called out their lineage to their \nopponents and fought individually only with those who they considered \nworthy.\n\nI read that this practice began to change with the Mongol invasion, \nas the Mongols couldn&#39;t understand Japanese, and that slowly, this \npractice of calling out their lineage and past heroism began to fade.\n\nSo the question is, did the Samurai ever begin to form troop \nformations such as the phalanx, maniples, in order to fight as a \ngroup?\n\nA book I recently read, &quot;Carnage and Culture&quot; implies that they did \nnot. That the reason western armies were so successful around the \nworld is because they employed these troop formations that rather \nthan focusing on individual combat.\n\nRegardless, does anybody know where I can find info on Samurai group \nstrategies and troop formations rather than individual discipline and \nman to man fighting?\n\nRegards,\nRichard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
