Field archery and Taget archery.\n\nTarget archery is what you see at the olympics. You\nsee the guys with the outstanding bow&#39;s all those\nweights and stabilisers. These stop the shudder of the\nbow when you release the arrow. The main emphasis is\nthat you get as close to the centre of the target as\npossible. each arrow that hitsone fo them coloured\ncircles gets points.\n\nField archery is where they set up tagets  or animal\ncut outs, you are in wood land and you look for the\ntargets. You shoot from a distance and hope to get\npoints that would in some cases represent a kill.\n\nOne of my students did Japanese archery (kyudo) in\nJapan. He told me that the main emphasis on kyudo was\nthe purity of the shot, hitting the target was not\nthat important.Its a zen related thing. \n\nMaybe someone on the list had studied Kyudo.\n\nThis site http://www.kyudo.com/ has some great info\nthey also wrote a book o the history and development\nof Kyudo which most libraries can obtain\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n--- cathy  hills &lt;cathy@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nI have a question relating to Differences between\nWestern archery and Japanese archery.My son gets a\nquestion every week at his Jujitsu class and this week\nit is &quot;What is/are the differences between western\narchery and japanese archery?&quot;\nThanks for your help,\nCathy.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
