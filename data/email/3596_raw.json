Did samurai exist before they were made into a class?\n\n2. Why is legitimacy by the government so important to the abolishment of the class of samurai?\n\n3. Why did some samurai families hide their swords instead of obeying the government?\n\n4. When the WW II officers carried swords did they, the military, or anyone else consider them samurai?\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
