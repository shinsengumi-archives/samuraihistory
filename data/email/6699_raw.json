The &quot;kucumi&quot; also makes no\nsense. If it&#39;s &quot;kurumi&quot; as in the second sentence,\nthat works--though the only thing I can think of is\nthat kurumi can mean walnut. Miyuki is a common female\ngiven name. However, since the &quot;sia&quot; and the &quot;siu&quot;\nmake no sense, and I&#39;ve got no context, it&#39;s hard to\ngive you anything beyond that. \n\nIs this a random phrase you heard someone say, or are\nyou looking at it in a book, or what? If you can give\nus some context, I may be able to work with it\nfurther. \n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
