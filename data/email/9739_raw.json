That being said \nthough I h=\r\nave to mention some of the faluts in the arguement presented \nagasint Zen a=\r\ns a religion. There are teachings. A follower of \nreligious Zen takes part =\r\nin such rituals as the Boddhisatva vow and \nseeking refuge in the three jew=\r\nels. There are books. Just to list a \nfew: Shobogenzo, Platform Sutra of th=\r\ne Sixth Patriarch, Perfection of \nWisdom is also used sometimes, some times=\r\n even the Lotus Sutra. I will \nignore the argument about gods because that =\r\nis complex and I want to \nkeep this short, other than saying you are correc=\r\nt that generally gods \nare not represented. If you have the 27 years of exp=\r\nerience you claim \nto have, I would think you would have heard of at least =\r\na few books \nwritten by Chinese and Japanese Zen masters. Such masters also=\r\n do \nwrite about past and future lifetimes and karma and duhka and samsara =\r\n\nand many other core Buddhist concepts. One thing Zen strongly rejects \ntha=\r\nt is often common in Chinese/Japanese Buddhism is the comcept of \nmappo. \n\n=\r\n\n"
