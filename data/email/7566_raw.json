During the vast bulk of the Sengoku,\nAshigaru  weren&#39;t considered &quot;samurai&quot;--they were\noriginally farmer-footsoldiers recruited from the\nprovinces to serve during campaigns, and then went\nback to the fields when the battle was over. Only with\nthe professionalization of armies did they become the\nlower ranks of the samurai class. Many ashigaru could\nand did rise within the samurai structure--notably,\nHideyoshi. \n\nAnd that&#39;s not even mentioning the &quot;jizamurai&quot;, the\nlanded gentry who farmed and warred, and were both\nsamurai and farmers (generally wealthy landowners). \n\nThe problem with your statement is it&#39;s very much a\nproduct of the tail end of the Sengoku and the Edo\nperiod. Especially from the Onin on, anyone with the\nright breaks and a set of iron...fists...could become\na samurai. Saito Dosan either was, or was the son of,\nan oil seller, depending on which author you read. Ise\nShinkuro (later Hojo Soun) rises up practically from\nout of nowhere. Most of Hideyoshi&#39;s close retainers\n(Kato Kiyomasa, for example) came from the same Owari\npeasant villages he did--in fact, it&#39;s celebrated in\nNagoya&#39;s Nakamura-ku, which used to be the village of\nNakamura, where Hideyoshi and Kiyomasa both were born.\n\n\nCould status be bought, like in Shogun? Not\nreally--not that way. A rich farmer could possibly\nhave been adopted into an impoverished samurai family\nand thereby &quot;made&quot; samurai, but I couldn&#39;t tell you if\nI&#39;ve ever come across that. It sounds too dramatic to\nme. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo! Mail has the best spam protection around \nhttp://mail.yahoo.com \n\n"
