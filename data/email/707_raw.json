He would\n&gt; have had an idea of the composition, ie weapons and\n&gt; the like. He would have known this all before 0500 on\n&gt; the 28th of June when he launched his charge. He could\n&gt; have retreated the night of the 27th. And he should\n&gt; have, in my opinion. Yes, it&#39;s hindsight, but speaking\n&gt; as a military officer, you simply don&#39;t attack 38,000\n&gt; men when you have 15,000. Not unless they have spears\n&gt; and you have tanks.\n\nMaybe he fancied himself a new Nobunaga, thinking of Okehazama...\n\nStill pretty stoopid, though. &lt;G&gt;\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n"
