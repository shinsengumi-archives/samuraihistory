A duraluminum blade would be just fine; it&#39;s for a costume, \nafter all.  I&#39;m more concerned with the proper shape and reasonably accurate \nfurniture.\n\nUnfortunately, most of what I see for sale is crap, and the stuff that isn&#39;t crap I can&#39;t \nafford (I could probably swing up to $150 per blade, but $500 per blade is out of my \nleague).  \n\nAs an aside, the things people have the gall to label &quot;samurai sword&quot; astounds me.  \nSome of &#39;em look like freaking steak knives.  :-/\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-- Cerebus\n\n\n\n"
