He doesn&#39;t specifically say that 1564 was the \nend of it, so he leaves it sort of open, which I think is perfectly \nacceptable.\n\n&quot;The Samurai Sourcebook&quot; (Turnbull, 1998, P. 216-217):\n\n&quot;THE SIEGE OF INABAYAMA, 1564- In 1564, Toyotomi Hideyoshi captured \nInabayama castle from the Saito for Oda Nobunaga.  As Inabayama was \nbuilt on top of a mountain, two attacks were launched, one that \ninvolved climbing, the other across the river.  Horio Yoshiharu \ndistinguished himself by opening the watergate to his atacking \ncomrades.  In 1565 Oda Nobunaga made Inabayama his headquarters and \nrenamed it Gifu.&quot;\n\nTurnbull plainly states it was renamed Gifu in 1565.  In 20 minutes of \nresearch in my collection of Japanese language history books, I found \nsix books that contradict this.  The rest either didn&#39;t mention the \nsiege at all, or didn&#39;t put any dates to it.\n\n1. Nihon meijo Souran (1999, P. 441):\n&quot;1567 - Oda nobunaga attacks saito tatsuoki&#39;s Inabayama castle in \nMino.  [It] falls, and is renamed Gifu.&quot;\n\n2. Sengokushi Shimbun (1996, P. 109):\nstates that in 9/1567 nobunaga takes Inabayama, renames it &#39;Gifu&#39;, and \nchanges his seal to &#39;Tenka Fubu&#39;.\n\n3. Sengoku no Kassen (1998, P. 78):\nOn the top of the page it states &quot;Eiroku 10 [1567]&quot;, and the title of \nthe section is: &quot;Nobunaga takes Mino - The seige of Inabayama&quot;.\n\n4. Nihon no Eiyu 100nin (1998, P. 73):\nstates that in Eiroku 10 [1567], Nobunaga defeats tatsuoki, and makes \nInabayama his main base, and renames it Gifu, and changes his seal to \nTenka Fubu.\n\n5. Rekishi Gunzo #1 (1987, P. 99) [Turnbull cites this book]:\nIn the timeline, for Eiroku 10, 8th month, it states that saito \ntatsuoki is defeated, and Inabayama falls.  Inabayama is changed to \n&#39;Gifu&#39;.  Again, Turnbull cites this. I would assume if he had \ncontradictory information he would normally have stated something like \n&quot;scholars disagree as to whether the fall of Inabayama took place in \n1565 or 1567.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t mention it.  Maybe in his next book.\n\n6. Sengoku Jinbutsu 700 (2001, P. 106):\nEiroku 10 [1567] Nobunaga renames castle Gifu, and changes his seal to \n&#39;Tenka Fubu&#39;.\n\nBased on the above, I&#39;d have to go with Lamers -it appears that it is \ncommon knowledge that the final fall of Inabayama was 1567.  Granted, \nmost of the above are secondary sources, and could be considered \n&#39;popular history&#39;, I would tend to believe them over turnbull due to \nthe fact that not only do 6 sources state that the &#39;final&#39; fall of \nInabayama was 1567 and at that point was renamed Gifu, but also that \nthe Japanese authors probably have access to much more accurate \ninformation.  Another thing I notice is that Hideyoshi was not \nmentioned in a single source as having participated.  Not to say that \nhe didn&#39;t, just that no sources mention him at all.  Sure, there could \nhave been plenty of attacks on Inabayama in 1564/5, but if it didn&#39;t \nfall until 1567, that makes the 1564/65 battles almost \ninconsequential.\n\nFor the above reason, I just find it odd that after 20 years of \n&#39;research&#39;, Turnbull still states that Inabayama fell in 1564/5.  It \nwould be nice to know where Turnbull got his info, but his being \n&#39;popular history&#39;, it doesn&#39;t precisely cite.  Sure, he could be \ncorrect, and the Japanese sources not, but.....\n\nThere are other various things Turnbull puts in that don&#39;t match up, \nsome of which came from Papinot, which he conveniently doesn&#39;t cite, \nbut obviously took greatly from.  Could be fun picking it apart, \nalthough I don&#39;t see what purpose it would serve.  Maybe to make him a \nbetter historian?  Or at least to more clearly cite his sources to \nprove us wrong?\n\nAll in good fun, of course.\n\n\n"
