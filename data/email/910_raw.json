Silly me not \nseeing in first place.  The site is in Japanese but the links are \nclear and there is english Language, it is part of the Yasaki Inari \nshrine, and it has many excellent pictures. Link is \nwww.tctv.ne.jp/uma490/ I hope it works this time.  Anyhow I am glad I \nfound this topic as I am finding out loads of interesting stuff.  \nSoon I want to create a website focusing on the samurai hats and \ntheir history and function, it is a bit off the wall but if anyone \nhas pics of samurai hats, can be helmets but mostly civilian and \nmilitary head wear.  So if any one has any pictures I would \nappreciate them very much.  I have found lots in Ukiyo-e. This should \nalso help Melvin and everyone else for that matter.  Japaense Hats \nrock ^^^^^^^^. \n\nAll the best Mark\n\n\n\n"
