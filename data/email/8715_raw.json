In my sociology u=\r\nndergraduate days I found Dirkheim&#39;s &quot;Le\n  Suicide&quot; a stimulating read, hav=\r\ning already read much about seppuku.

I went looking for some evidence\n  in google with &quot;roman=\r\n soldier suicide&quot; (no quotes), and whilst not finding any\n  evidence I have=\r\n spent the last couple of hours reading Roman history!

I have done alot of writing and revising,  but Im sti=\r\nll\n  searching for that one sentence that puts everything  together for me.=\r\n I know\n  what I want to say, but sometimes it&#39;s hard to  put those things =\r\ninto writing. I\n  think asking this question will spark  something for me, =\r\nas I know there are\n  several informed and educated  people in this group w=\r\nho know far more than I.\n  \n    In your opinion, were there differences in =\r\nthe philosophy of seppuku  during\n  the reign of the Tokugawa as opposed to=\r\n the period of time  leading up to the\n  Tokugawa period? If so, what were =\r\nthey?\n  \n    For me, the first thing that comes to mind is the lack of wide=\r\nspread  warfare\n  during the Tokugawa reign. This alters the significance o=\r\nf  seppuku during this\n  period, in my opinion.\n  \n    Your ideas and input=\r\n would be grately appreciated.\n  \n    Jonathan\n  \n  \n  \n          \n\n    ---=\r\n\n  Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n  http://www.samurai-archives.com=\r\n/writcon2.html\n  \n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Sam=\r\nurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---  \n\n    =\r\n                  \n\n          SPONSORED LINKS    \n                         =\r\n                               Samurai                                     =\r\n     Japan                                          Japan airline          =\r\n                                                                   \n       =\r\n \n---------------------------------\n    YAHOO!
