You can learn a lot more about \nJapan from books published by Princeton, Cornell, Harvard, &c. than you \nare likely to from somebody&#39;s free e-book. Then you can learn Japanese, \nif you haven&#39;t already, and read books put out by serious Japanese \npublishers as well. And, yes, you can get Japanese books through \ninterlibrary loan. I have done it in the past. For that matter, there \nare lots of Tuttle books which are fairly inexpensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
