Such an association, however, \n``is a mere vestige&#39;&#39; of the Bushido that existed for more than 700 \nyears up to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, stresses University of \nTokyo professor Kakumyo Kanno in his recent book ``Bushido no \nGyakushu&#39;&#39; (Bushido strikes back). In the paperback, published by \nKodansha, the 49-year-old professor of ethics argues that the Meiji \nRestoration severed that thinking and that discontinuity served as a \nremote cause of Japan&#39;s defeat in World War II. Kanno shared his \nviews on Bushido in a recent interview. \n\nWhy has thinking very different from the original Bushido gained \nground, even though the word bushi (samurai) remains in the name? \n\nKanno began by citing ``Bushido: the Soul of Japan,&#39;&#39; written in \nEnglish by Inazo Nitobe and published in the United States in 1899. \n\n``The Bushido spirit presented by Nitobe has nothing to do with the \nthinking of the samurai. \n\n``The actual standpoint of the samurai is completely ignored,&#39;&#39; said \nKanno sharply. \n\n``Nitobe was a Christian who lived in the modern era. The Meiji \nRestoration ended the age of the samurai. His Bushido is a modern \nconcept that, so to speak, could be called Meiji Bushido. Nitobe \nborrowed the word Bushido to use as a link between the Japanese and \na universal Western thinking that is the same as Christian \nthinking,&#39;&#39; said Kanno. \n\nThen what is the real Bushido like? \n\nKanno cited three key terms-self, warrior and community. \n\nThe beginnings of the samurai can be traced back to the 10th \ncentury. At that time, private bands of warriors were formed after \nthe ritsuryo (legal code) state, which had national troops, ceased \nto exist. According to Kanno, the thinking that sustained the new \nbands of private soldiers was Bushido. \n\nSince Bushido is the thinking of private warriors, it adheres \ncompletely to personal attachments. A warrior fights for the sake of \nhis independence, relying solely on his own capability. This does \nnot necessarily mean violence without a specific purpose. Kanno \nbelieves that the samurai fought for his own interests, those of his \nwife and children and for the community that embraced his lord. \n\n``To us, used to the idea of citizens within the framework of the \nmodern nation-state, this thinking is practically \nincomprehensible.&#39;&#39; \n\nThen why does Meiji Bushido, cloaked in the Bushido shell, still \nhold interest? \n\nTo explain this, Kanno cites the fact that Bushido thinking was \npreviously declared a national moral code. An example is the gunjin \nchokuyu, the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors issued by \nEmperor Meiji in 1882. By examining its formation, Kanno observes \nthat Bushido was remodeled to become a principle to control the \narmed forces of a modern state. \n\nThe leaders of the imperial army in the early days ingeniously \nremoved the spirit of the ``original Bushido,&#39;&#39; rooted in personal \nattachments. And to govern the nation&#39;s army, they are said to have \ncreated the ``yamato (Japanese) spirit&#39;&#39; to replace the ``original \nBushido.&#39;&#39; \n\n``Bushido is a way of thinking that was severed by the Meiji \nRestoration.&#39;&#39; Had Bushido been correctly passed down to the \nimperial army, Kanno believes, defeat in the last world war might \nhave been avoided since ``Bushido held the wisdom to end war.&#39;&#39; \n\nKanno, a priest of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism, is known for his \nstudies of Shinto and his research on Motoori Norinaga, a scholar of \nclassical culture. In addition to publishing ``Shinto no Gyakushu&#39;&#39; \n(Shinto strikes back), Kanno addressed the topic of Yasukuni Shrine \nin the January edition of Shokun! magazine. \n\n``Although Yasukuni Shrine is a fitting place to console the souls \nof the deceased, it needs to be supplemented in its present form. It \nseems all of us, politicians included, are trying to take advantage \nof the fallen soldiers. We must think first of the war dead,&#39;&#39; said \nKanno.(IHT/Asahi: February 12,2005) \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
