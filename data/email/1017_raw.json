In the future he is considering allowing people to have &#39;login names&#39; to save your personal study lists. As it is right now, I think you lose your list if you close your browser.  This is what is &#39;in the works&#39; in addition to what is already there:\n\nHave a quiz mode for each list that drills you on the common jukugo and kunyomi. \nAllow user to save their study lists to retrieve at a later date. \nAllow user to create multiple study lists and sort them by name. \nCreate a version of this tool that is an all purpose kanji lookup tool that queries all Joyou kanji.\n\nThis would be a very valuable resource for anyone studying Japanese.\n(you need japanese fonts installed in your browser to fully utilize the site)\nhttp://www.jdictionary.com\n\n\n"
