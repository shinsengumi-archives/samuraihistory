Being outnumbered by a few, and\n&gt; knowing you have better quality troops, and maybe\n&gt; determining how to use surprise, mass, and economy\n&gt; of\n&gt; force can mitigate these factors.\n\nAs you say, all information must be &#39;Integrated\nTogether&#39;. I want to emphasized that information on\nenemy troop size should not be &#39;disproportionally&#39;\ntaken too serisouly for a tactical decision. This was\nwhat I meant by being &#39;Indepedent&#39;. The use of\nsuprise, mass, and etc would be some of options\navailable to a field commander. \n\nKatsuyori was lack of all these qualities. But, we may\nanalyze his situation and can get some lessons from\nhis defeat.\n\nAs for me, I am not a trained military historian. I\nhave background in political science, statistics, and\nmathematics. I liked reading a lot of books on ancient\nChinese stategies and military history (both eastern\nand western). Now, I am working on a Ph.D. in\nmathematics. I intend to work on something\ninterdisciplinary in the future. Anyway, it was good\nto hear from you. \n\nps. My father was also a Lietenant Colonel in the\nSouth Korea Army. So, I have very friendly sentiment\ntoward the military figures.\n\n\n\n\n                          Sincerely,\n\n\n\n                          Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n\n"
