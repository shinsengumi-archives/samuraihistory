I&#39;m wondering if wasn&#39;t permitted\n&gt; &gt; for a foreigner \n&gt; &gt; (like a Westerner, or a someone else from another\n&gt; &gt; part of Asian)to \n&gt; &gt; become a Samurai? I have nothing against bias\n&gt; &gt; issues, but I heard a \n&gt; &gt; rumor that you have to be pure bred Japanese to\n&gt; &gt; become a Samurai, \n&gt; &gt; dispite what is portray in Hollywood movies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, if you&#39;re talking about now, then it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; matter if you&#39;re Japanese, European, or Martian--the\n&gt; samurai class was legislated out of existence in the\n&gt; late 1800&#39;s, so no, not even Japanese can be samurai\n&gt; anymore. The samurai class doesn&#39;t exist.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you mean back then, then that&#39;s a debatable issue.\n&gt; Many will allege that William Adams, an English ship\n&gt; pilot, became samurai when he was awarded the title of\n&gt; hatamoto by Tokugawa Ieyasu. Since technically only\n&gt; samurai could hold the title, it stands to reason that\n&gt; he was therefore also made samurai. So there&#39;s one\n&gt; instance. Not many others exist, if at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
