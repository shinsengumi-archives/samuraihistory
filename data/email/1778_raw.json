If anyone is living in the San Francisco bay area, every Saturday night from 9:30 or so, there is a historical drama about Miyamoto Musashi...this will run for about a year and it is sub-titled.  The Japanese do a real good job with these soap opera type of shows.  \n \nThey had one on the 47 ronin a couple of years ago.  These programs typically run for about a year and then they change to another historical subject or person.\n \nSenkaku-ji is the name of the shrine where the 47 ronin are burried.  Small museum located there as well with many of the personal effects of the 47. \n \nAccording to what I know, the 48th ronin was not allowed to take part in the battle because he was not a member of the Ako clan....he supported their quest, so Oishi allowed him to record what had happened so future generations would know the facts on the battle.  I can&#39;t remember his name but understand he lived for years telling the story in their memory.\n \nHappy to answer any questions and hopefully I will know something about it.\n \nMark Cerny\n \n\n\nWilliam&Mikiko Letham &lt;mickey.letham@...&gt; wrote:\nHere&#39;s a list from Rekishi Gunzo # 57. Other sources may have different\nnames. For example Oishi the leader is also called Yoshio. There have also\nbeen a number of names bandied about for a 48th, 49th, ronin, however those\nare a matter of debate. Henry Smith has a very interesting article in the\nlatest (#58) issue of Monumenta Nipponica. He also promised this would be\nthe first in a series about the so called Chushingura story.\n\n\nName                                                                 Date of\nbirth\nOishi Kuranoske Yoshitaka                                  1656\nOishi Chikara Yoshikane                                      1688\nYoshida Chuzaemon Kanesuke                             1641\nYoshida Sawaemon Kanesada                               1675\nHara Souemon Mototoki                                        1648\nKataoka Gengoemon Takafusa                               1667\nMase Kyudayu Masaaki                                       1641\nMase Magokurou Masatoki                                    1681\nOnodera Junai Hidekazu                                         1643\nOnodera Koemon Hidetomi                                    1676\nHazama Kihee Mitsunobu                                        1635\nHazama Jujiro Mitsuoki                                           1678\nHazama Shinroku Mitsukaze                                   1680\nHoribe Yahee Akizane                                             1627\nHoribe Yasubei Taketsune                                       1670\nIsogai Jurozaemon Masahisa                                    1679\nChikamatsu Kanroku Yukishige                                1670\nTominomori Sukeimon Masayori                              1670\nUshioda Matanoju Takanori                                     1669\nHayami Tozaemon Mitsutaka                                    1664\nOkuda Magodayu Shigemori                                    1647\nOkuda Sadaemon Yukitaka                                        1678\nYata Goroemon Suketake                                          1675\nSugaya Hannoju Masatoshi                                         1660\nOishi Sezaimon Nobukiyo                                           1677\nAkabane Genzou Shigekata                                        1669\nSenba Saburobei Mitsutada                                          1653\nNakamura Kansuke Masatoki                                    1656\nOmura Okaemon Sadayuki                                        1658\nFuwa Kazuemon Masatane                                        1670\nOkano Kinemon Kanehide                                          1680\nOkajima Yasoemon Tsuneki                                           1666\nTakebayashi Tadashichi Takashige                                1671\nKaiga Yazaimon Tomonobu                                           1650\nOtaka Gengo Tadao                                                    1672\nKurahashi Densuke Takeyuki                                     1670\nMuramatsu Kihei Hidenao                                          1642\nMuramastu Sandayu Takanao                                       1677\nSugino Juheiji Tsugifusa\n1676\nMaebara Isuke Munefusa                                             1664\nKatsuta Shinzaemon Taketaka                                       1680\nYato Uemoshichi Norikane                                         1686\nKanzaki Yagoro Noriyasu                                           1666\nKayano Wasuke Tsunenari                                           1667\nYokokawa Kanbei Munesuke                                        1667\nMimura Jirozaemon Kanetsune                                     1667\nTerasaka Kichiemon Nobuyuki                                    1665\n\n\n\nYahoo!
