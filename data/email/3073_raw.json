The story was great, the \nacting was great, the music was great (Hans Zimmer you know), the scenery \nwas breathtaking, the attention to detail was great (i.e. costumes), the \nfight scenes were great.  And Shin Koyamada was both talented and HOT.  I \nsaw it twice.  The only thing was I made the mistake of sitting by my friend \nthe second time and he made me realize that the part with the gattling gun \nwas unrealistic.  Still, all things considered I give it and 8 out of 5.  \nOne of the all time greatest movies.\n\nSARA\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Josh Wilson&quot; &lt;lordwilson@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai\n&gt;Date: Sat, 10 Jan 2004 15:31:38 -0500\n&gt;\n&gt;I know the movie was inaccurate, and I tried to put that past it, and judge \n&gt;it as a movie..even then it still sucked.. like when Tom cruise sliced thru \n&gt;a rifle w/ a sword?? or all the sword fights striking the blades edge on \n&gt;edge repeatedly.. that was all crap.. there was lots of other stuff too..\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;\n&gt;--------- Original Message ---------\n&gt;DATE: Sat, 10 Jan 2004 13:23:17\n&gt;From: Mmupton1@...\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Cc:\n&gt;\n&gt;I do not think &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is historically accurate, but I think the\n&gt;battle at the very end of the movie actually did take place, something like \n&gt;the\n&gt;gun powder rebellion. Well, anyway I also thought it was a good movie. It \n&gt;was\n&gt;quit touching. I went to go see it with my friends when it first came out,\n&gt;they try to act as if they are tough, but when we walked out of the theater \n&gt;they\n&gt;were balling their eyes out. We dont talk about that to this day though. \n&gt;Yeah\n&gt;it was a good movie.\n&gt;-Matthew Upton\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
