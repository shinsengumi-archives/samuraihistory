Until now I had been\ndoing cross references between the History of the\nCatholic Church and the History of Japan. This fact\nhad made that my research turn to become a synthesis\neffort of two different kind of sources. But it seems\na good approach to my tutor professors (research\nproject) anyway.\nThanks again.\n\n&quot;The Light shines in Darkness, and Darkness cannot\novercome it&quot;\n\n--- James Eckman &lt;ronin_engineer@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Try abebooks.com, $48 is still not cheap but if it&#39;s\n&gt; what your looking \n&gt; for.... Alibris has one for $49. One of the local\n&gt; university libraries \n&gt; has it for free. A good researcher has to work the\n&gt; book hunt pretty hard \n&gt; for the fun stuff. Lots easier though than when you\n&gt; actually had to call \n&gt; libraries to find out if they had a book or where\n&gt; you could find a copy! \n&gt; I have no nostalgia for card catalogs either having\n&gt; had to maintain one. \n&gt; For Mark, you can get it from the San Jose Library\n&gt; or through Link+ if \n&gt; you want to read it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n\n\n"
