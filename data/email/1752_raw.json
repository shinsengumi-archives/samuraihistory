The only death close to s=\r\nuch settings of a\ncliff, can be that of the ritual suicide of Saigo Takamor=\r\ni during\nSeptember of 1877 on a hilltop in Kagoshima, which is a coast city=\r\n. He\nwas the aristocratic politician who led the Satsuma rebellion, but was=\r\n\none of 3 samurai who helped form the Japan army whom he turned against.\nTh=\r\nis murder story your friend mentioned, have the liking of a rumor. The\nrebe=\r\nllion had nothing to do with another country. Only Samurai faught\nagainst t=\r\nhe Meiji laws of the Japan army, in 1877 where about 21thousand\nperished...=\r\nmmm...but I will follow this story up.\n\nDeon\n\n \n\n\nWarrior_of_bushido &lt;warri=\r\nor_of_bushido@...&gt; wrote:\nHi, a college friend posed this question =\r\nto me, and  as i dont know of\nany such story,  i wondered if any of you hav=\r\ne any information. She\nheard the story years ago and is now trying to trace=\r\n it again, and get\nmore facts. \nThe event is purported to have taken place =\r\nin the 1860s or 70s, and\nconcerns the murder, on a beach hidden by wooded c=\r\nliffs, of two or three\n&quot;shishi&quot; during the Satsuma rebellion or related eve=\r\nnts, by 5 Americans.\n\nThats all my friend can remeber of the story, if it r=\r\nings any bells\nplease let us know - we would be fascinated.\n\nLaura\n\n\n\n\n----=\r\n-----------------------------\nYahoo!
