The image you&#39;ve got in your\n&gt; &gt;  head is from the Edo period. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Here is something I&#39;ve got from the &quot;Online dictionary of history and\n&gt; tr=\r\naditions&quot;\n&gt; (http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/search?dbname=3Dhistg&sword=\r\n=3Dhakama) :\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;As  attested  by  Haniwa  doll  of  Kofun  period,  orig=\r\nin  of hakama\n&gt; (Japanese  trousers)  was  very old. Under an influence of =\r\nthe Chinese\n&gt; civilization, the usage of hakama had declined during Heian p=\r\neriod and\n&gt; replaced  by  kimono  with  a long skirt, especially among wome=\r\nn. When\n&gt; samurai  clans  took the power in the middle ages, the usage of h=\r\nakama\n&gt; became  again  popular  among  men. Hakama for women resurfaced dur=\r\ning\n&gt; Meiji period as a girl&#39;s school uniform.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Another source (htt=\r\np://www.shindai.com/articles/hakama.htm) states the\n&gt; following (+ some mor=\r\ne info):\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A  hakama  is  the  skirt-like pants that some aikidoka wear=\r\n. It is a\n&gt; traditional  piece of samurai clothing. The standard gi worn in=\r\n aikido\n&gt; as well as in other martial arts such as Judo or Karate was origi=\r\nnally\n&gt; underclothes. Wearing it is part of the tradition of (most schools =\r\nof)\n&gt; aikido.\n&gt; \n&gt; The  hakama  were  originally  meant to protect a horsem=\r\nan&#39;s legs from\n&gt; brush, etc., - not unlike a cowboy&#39;s leather &#39;chaps&#39;. Leat=\r\nher was hard\n&gt; to  come  by  in  Japan,  so  heavy  cloth was used instead.=\r\n After the\n&gt; samurai as a class dismounted and became more like foot-soldie=\r\nrs, they\n&gt; persisted  in  wearing  horseman&#39;s  garb because it set them apa=\r\nrt and\n&gt; made them easily identifiable.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were different styles of=\r\n hakama though. The type worn by today&#39;s\n&gt; martial  artists  -  with  &quot;legs=\r\n&quot; - is called a joba hakama, (roughly,\n&gt; horseriding  thing  into  which  o=\r\nne steps). A hakama that was kind of\n&gt; like  a  tube  skirt - no legs - ano=\r\nther and the third was a very long\n&gt; version of the second. It was worn on =\r\nvisits to the Shogun or Emperor.\n&gt; The  thing  was  about  12-15  feet long=\r\n and was folded repeatedly and\n&gt; placed   between   the   feet  and  poster=\r\nior  of  the  visitor.  This\n&gt; necessitated their shikko (&quot;knee walking&quot;) f=\r\nor their audience and made\n&gt; it  extremely unlikely that they could hide a =\r\nweapon (retainers suited\n&gt; them up) or rise quickly to make an attack.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope  some pieces of this info might be useful to you, guys. And it=\r\n is\n&gt; interesting that I also heard soe time ago from one of my friends tha=\r\nt\n&gt; hakama  was  used to camouflage your legs&#39; moves, but I never actually\n=\r\n&gt; read about that...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; P.s.
