One of them, I forget the name, but it was directed by\nIto Daisuke, about a ronin who is avenging a death. He finds himself a\nfugitive and is sheltered by some farmers and he and the farmers join forces\nto combat the lord of the fief, who is taxing the farmers practically to\ndeath. I haven&#39;t seen this film and I&#39;d like to someday. \n\nAlso I&#39;ve read about &quot;noble ronin who help peasants&quot; films in some of the\nother film books. They apparently started to appear in Japanese film around\nthe late 50s/early 60s or so. Gosha Hideo did THREE OUTLAW SAMURAI around\nthat time, which is about some ronin who come to the aid of farmers.\nApparently he and some of the other directors used the portrayal of ronin as\na way to show a political viewpoint. \n\nI forget exactly when SEVEN SAMURAI was made.  \n\nNina\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Randy Schadel\nSent: Wednesday, February 01, 2006 4:18 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Re: Magnificent Seven\n\nLots of great points, Jim, especially about the influence of Western\nliterature on Kurosawa&#39;s films.\n\nNina wrote &quot;...SEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the noble ronin\nwho helps peasants. When in fact, most Japanese ronin were mostly interested\nin connecting with a clan. And they saw themselves as being apart from and\nsuperior to the farmers.&quot;\n\nJim wrote &quot;Since I&#39;m actually not sure of Kurosawa&#39;s source for the plot for\nthis one, I won&#39;t make any definitive statements.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s been my understanding that Kurosawa did not have a direct source for\nSeven Samurai. One of the reasons for the success of the film was that it\ntook the novel approach of having farmers hiring and being protected by\nsamurai, which was unheard of in Japanese cinema and literature at the time.\nWhile Nina wrote that &quot;...SEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the\nnoble ronin who helps peasants.&quot;, there was not any sort of tradition or\nmythology in literature or cinema that I am aware of to that point-Seven\nSamurai was the first of its type (although there likely is some example of\nit, somewhere...just not one I&#39;ve encountered). Up to then, the plots would\nbe &#39;ronin helps himself out&#39;, &#39;samurai helps himself out&#39;, &#39;samurai helps\nout other samurai&#39;, &#39;ronin or samurai screws over peasants/townspeople while\nhelping themselves out&#39;, etc. The changing face of relative status in\npost-war Japan helped Seven Samurai introduce the &#39;noble samurai/ronin who\nhelped the downtrodden masses&#39; genre to Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com Samurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
