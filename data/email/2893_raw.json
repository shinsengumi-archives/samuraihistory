I thought that the swords were sent\nto selected individuals after hey had been forged and polished who then\ntested them and inlaid a gold inscription on the tang saying how many\nbodies were cut with the sword.

After that, it would be returned to the maker to be\nstamped how well it held up, but it was mroe for a durability test than\na sharpness test, as any sharp blade could cut, but not every blade\nwould stay intact. Some may crack or even break entirely if the\ncraftsmanship was flawed.\n\nWilson\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Mon, 15 Dec 2003 12:13:27\nFrom: Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nActually the blades use to have a symbol for how many\nbodies it could slice through which determined how\nsharp it was.\n\n--- Josh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well AJ, I reckon its my turn *smacks his head on\n&gt; the desk* How sharp is any blade??
