I=\r\n&#39;ve been told that Howard Clark(out of Morgan Valley Forge) makes an excell=\r\nent katana. Go to his website at mvforge.com. If i can remember, his new L6=\r\n katana goes for about $3800 & that&#39;s for the blade only. I also know a com=\r\npany out of Japan(i&#39;ll get back to you w/ the web address) that makes great=\r\n katana&#39;s also. They run for about $10,000-$15,000 completed. Go to bugei t=\r\nrading company&#39;s website(bugei.com), they have a whole array of very high q=\r\nuality katana&#39;s all hand made. They start off at around $925 and go up from=\r\n there. They also work w/ Howard Clark. Anyways,... these are just a few pl=\r\naces where you might want to look if you want to purchase a amazing katana.=\r\n I don&#39;t actually own any of them b/c of the prices.( i&#39;ve a kid&#39;s and a wi=\r\nfe that doesn&#39;t work) This is just what i&#39;ve heard from A LOT of people. Go=\r\nod luck & if you can actually afford one of them,...i&#39;m jealous. :)\n       =\r\n                                       Thanks,\n                            =\r\n                    Mark\n\njames wilson &lt;johntwo8@...&gt; wrote:\n  I am n=\r\not a sword guru but I have seen a sword by Paul Chen and its the best you c=\r\nan get where I am from.

You don&#39;t quote if the blade has Bohi. If your blade has Bo=\r\nhi,\nand as it&#39;s a working blade that&#39;ll see a lot of cleaning, is better to=\r\n\npolish inside the Bohi (ONLY this part, inside the Bohi) *from tip to\nNaka=\r\ngo* , the reverse as the rest of the blade, because if you polish\nthe corre=\r\nct way Hi too, the result in the long time will be a change in\nthe polish a=\r\nt the very end of the Hi. As Mr. Sinclaire quoted, Uchiko\n(and Paul Chen&#39;s =\r\none isn&#39;t a top level one) is very slightly abrasive.  \n\n-----Messaggio ori=\r\nginale-----\nDa: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n[mailto:samuraihistory@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com] Per conto di mark kd\nInviato: mercoled=EC 23 novembre 2005 3.52=\r\n\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new=\r\n katana HELP PLEASE!!!!\n\nhello,\n     i just purchased a paul chen wind & th=\r\nunder katana off ebay. it\ncame new in the box. when i opened it, the factor=\r\ny had heavily oiled it\nup plus there are little woodchips from the Saya(sca=\r\nbbard) all over it.\nI shook the Saya out as much as possible but the blade =\r\nis a whole\ndifferent story.
