My apologies.  Because after all, those\n&#39;guys with the helmets and swords&#39; had religious beliefs, beliefs that\naffected the way they regarded those swords (and a great deal of the rest of\ntheir world as well).\n----------------------------\n\nWell, as an absolute neophyte on this list I have been following this thread\nwith more than a little interest.  We see the celluloid samurai in various\nguises - chambara, TC, and &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot; as a more &#39;serious&#39;\nflick - but I have often wondered about what we might describe as &quot;the\ncognitive map&quot; of a samurai&#39;s world-view.  I read that their education was\nlimited to their rank in the Class and that the bottom of the samurai class\nwere subsistence farmers.  Were they really ALL prepared to face death in an\ninstant?  Anyway, however uninformed my own position, I certainly support\nthis thread as being relevant to samurai history.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
