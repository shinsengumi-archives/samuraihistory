Thus, a stipend of=\r\n such-and-such koku ends up being more a measure of rank but not of real in=\r\ncome, which varied per retainer household depending on what the domain took=\r\n out of it before the stipend was paid. And the percentage taken depended a=\r\nt any given time on overall domainal debt and financial condition.\n\nCheers,=\r\n\nOnnamusha\n\n--- On Sun, 12/27/09, Mr Washington &lt;mrwashington@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n\nFrom: Mr Washington &lt;mrwashington@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory=\r\n] Koku\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Sunday, December 27, 2009, =\r\n7:22 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      One koku equal the a=\r\nmount of rice to feed one person for one year. \n\n\nSent from my BlackBerry=\r\n=C2=AE smartphone with SprintSpeed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n      \n\n\n      \n\n\n      The key phrase is &quot;at the t=\r\nime&quot;--it varied wildly from period to period and even place to place within=\r\n that period. If you&#39;re more specific with time I can help you further, but=\r\n to quickly give you the simple answer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. If someone was hired =\r\nat 1500 koku (a koku wasn&#39;t a bushel, by the way, but the amount generally =\r\ncalculated to feed 1 man for 1 year--can&#39;t pull the estimated bushel total =\r\nout of my wheelhouse at the moment, and my resources aren&#39;t close at hand),=\r\n then he was hired at 1500 koku. You can&#39;t calculate the dollar amount with=\r\nout knowing a VERY specific time, because rice prices changed so often, and=\r\n even then you&#39;re calculating into contemporary currency, not today&#39;s figur=\r\nes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Generally speaking if the kokudaka system was used, the =\r\nretainer was paid in rice. During the mid to late-1500s many daimyo institu=\r\nted the kandaka system, where taxes were collected in kan (coin) and it was=\r\n the taxpayer&#39;s responsibility to convert their produce (not just rice, but=\r\n whatever they had) into coin. Under that system, a retainer would have bee=\r\nn paid in coin. Hideyoshi and then Ieyasu reverted back to a koku of rice b=\r\neing the standardized taxation unit, and therefore what retainers were paid=\r\n in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Lump sum, yes. This is why you hear so many tales of th=\r\ne women of the house having to shave their heads and sell their hair, or do=\r\n other things to make ends meet--call it poor budgeting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                          \n\n=\r\n\n                        Going Green: Your Yahoo!
