I cannot \nsay that I agree with the games historical accuracy. \nTurnbull had to take many ideas and try to combine them into a \nplayable thing...but it does not follow in any real way a plausable \ntime line...and the added bits in the &quot;gold&quot; edition are bung...\nBy setting up scenarios that could be played out in a game like \nfashion, Turnbull turned aside historical accuracy, and settled for \na paycheck.\nI am sure he knows that, and I am not trying to take him to task...\nI would truely like to see a game set up that involves much more \ndetail - political intrigue...more families...more plausable \nvariations on time line and equipment...\nThe evolution that occured in terms of equipment, morals and \nstrategy were profound during the sengoku jidai...and the game \ncould easilly show that...(and for buddha&#39;s sake, either make the \nlovely geisha in the palace room interactive or get rid of her...she \nis a distraction!!! :-) )\nThe game is a good start, and I hope he sees fit to add much \nmore to it...then it could be a historical teaching tool...and then \nwould be much more enjoyable...\nEven if scenarios end up differently from real history after a solid \nstart...so be it...at least then one could have a real sence of...&quot;if I \ndid this under these circumstances, then what might have \nhappened...&quot;\nAnd if he would like to include the mongol invasions, then \nperhaps he should confine them to the real historical setting...\n\n\nJust ranting thoughts...\n\nDate\n\nDate Saburou Yukiie\nYama Kaminari Ryu\nShi wa hei to de aru - all are equal in the grave\nhttp://www.kabutographics.com (under reconstruction)\nkabuto@...\n\n\n\n"
