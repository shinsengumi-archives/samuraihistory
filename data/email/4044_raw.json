But what I meant was that the bushido \nwas used to keep samurai down in the edo jidai (i know it wasnt \naround earlier... im glad you do, because on the message board right \nnow ive got a heated discussion on my hands with someone who \ndisagrees.).\nI&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a conspiracy the way we think about it... but it \nwas a useful tool utilized in this way nonetheless.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;midorinotoradesu&quot; \n&lt;bkirkham@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Now Kyle, I like that.  You have been fair with all of us by \n&gt; explaining what you meant. \n&gt; \n&gt; I do have some thoughts about the whole lineage thing.  I&#39;m not an \n&gt; expert, so I hope Tony will correct me if I&#39;m way off.  I do \nbelieve \n&gt; the practice of one on one combat existed in the early samurai \n&gt; period.  Even in the Gempei war many challanges were shouted to \nfoes \n&gt; based on the existing honor system.  Many Samurai did call out \ntheir \n&gt; lineage before a battle.  Although it seems silly to us now, we \nhave \n&gt; to remember how isolated Japan was from the rest of the world.  \nThey \n&gt; had a system of fighting wars that was very different than any \n&gt; other...Until the Mongols invaded.  Then the Samurai began to wise \n&gt; up.  &quot;Hey, these Mongols don&#39;t really care about our family do \nthey?&quot;  \n&gt; My understanding is that the Japanese were totally unprepared to \n&gt; fight a war with an organized mongolian military machine.  The \n&gt; Kamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But the samurai were \n&gt; prepared the second time, and the preparations/strategic \nphilosophies \n&gt; that followed changed the face of Samurai warfare.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Into the Sengoku is when Ashigaru are much more apparent in the \n&gt; armies.  Long after the lineage practice had been proven unwise by \n&gt; the Mongols (I know, they were actually Korean and Chinese \n&gt; conscripts).  So at this point I can&#39;t see them doing it either.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many years later, after a couple hundred years of peace, under the \n&gt; Tokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is about the point \nthat \n&gt; Bushido is crystalized into what we know today.  Prior to the \n&gt; peaceful Edo Jidai, much of the &quot;honor sytem&quot; wasn&#39;t based on \nthose \n&gt; high and holy precepts that everyone thinks the samurai lived by.  \nIt \n&gt; was only in the last years of the samurai that the bushido code \nwould \n&gt; influence the population.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess, I too get a little sick of generalizations.  I recently \nwent \n&gt; to a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai and Kensei.  We \nwere \n&gt; informed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido code.  They were \n&gt; warriors and role models that were bound by honor to better \nsociety.  \n&gt; They helped everyone gain greater understanding by standing for \n&gt; peace, justice, and the American way (well, they didn&#39;t really say \n&gt; that, but they might as well have).  Upon hearing this, I could \nhear \n&gt; Tony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There were good and bad \n&gt; Samurai.  They didn&#39;t all live honorable and they Bushido code \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; affect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you must agree that \nthey \n&gt; had some system of honor.  How else could we quantify a good or \nbad \n&gt; samurai?  But it wasn&#39;t &quot;Bushido&quot; persay.  Since &quot;Bushido&quot; did not \n&gt; exist in the Sengoku, it probably wasn&#39;t used to keep the troops \nin \n&gt; line.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate their troops but it \nmay \n&gt; have been much more simple and less dubious than you presume.  \n&gt; Promises of fame and fortune, political status, social status, \npride, \n&gt; and land are other methods that could be used to obtain loyalty.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In short, I don&#39;t think that there was a universal conspiracy by \n&gt; leaders of the time, to devise a system to keep a brotha down.  \nThat \n&gt; was not the &quot;purpose&quot; of honor or bushido, although it (like \nanything \n&gt; else) could be perverted and warped to serve sinister means.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brandon\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kyle Segall&quot; &lt;\n&gt; klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Try a little more than Shogun. Akechi Mitsuhide wouldn&#39;t have \nbeen \n&gt; &gt; thought so poor had he actually succeeded in becoming Shogun \n(his \n&gt; &gt; alliances not fallen apart, the mori finding out about \nnobunaga&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; death before hideyoshi). Don&#39;t kid yourself into think he really \n&gt; did \n&gt; &gt; anything special. Just dumb.\n&gt; &gt; The daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai \n&gt; &gt; really believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to \n&gt; see \n&gt; &gt; that. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the \n&gt; &gt; peacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.\n&gt; &gt; You claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its \ntrue \n&gt; &gt; that confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far \n&gt; &gt; from a system of honor, especially what you&#39;re thinking about. \n&gt; Think \n&gt; &gt; about it; if you&#39;re a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; little time you have off, what room is there for the &quot;honor&quot; \nthat \n&gt; &gt; you think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do \n&gt; &gt; anything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure \npreaches \n&gt; &gt; about may be true... but that wasn&#39;t really out of a sense of \n&gt; honor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the \nnoble \n&gt; &gt; ones. I doubt an ashigaru wielding a spear was shouting, &quot;I am \nso-\n&gt; &gt; and-so, from so-and-so village! Come get some!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And sorry about the snappy remarks... I&#39;m just SICK of all these \n&gt; &gt; kids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for \nevery \n&gt; &gt; age, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his \nactions. \n&gt; &gt; Only famous for who he killed and how dumb he was in doing it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"
