Pure iron with 0.8% carbon added is tool steel, comparable to the edge steel of a katana.  The hardness of iron/steel is manipulated by varying the carbon content and heat treating appropriately.  Modern steels are alloys with elements other than carbon also added.\n- Katana have never weighed 50 lbs!!!  I have just gone and got out a ca 1700 katana.  It weighed 1 1/2 lbs (700 grams).  It is about an average size.  In a temple in Japan there is a katana 6 foot or more long.  It might weight 5 lbs, but it is a votive offering to the Gods and not a serious combat sword.\n- Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s sword??  No idea...\n\nBest regards,\nBarry Thomas\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: MNcoffey@... \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, January 20, 2007 7:16 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Nihonto\n\n\n  I have been doing research on real Japanese katana and have only ended \n  up confusing myself even more, so I thought I would ask everybody here \n  my two questions. First question, what kind of steels were the katana \n  made of. second question, this one I have been arguing about with a \n  friend of mine, he says that katana back then could weigh up to 50lbs! \n  I say up to 5lbs, so I was hoping somebody could answer that. And I \n  more question I&#39;ve read on the Internet that Miyamoto Musashi used a \n  bigger katana than most people and I was wandering if that is true. \n  Thanks.-Martin\n\n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
