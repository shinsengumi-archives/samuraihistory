You&#39;re thinking of kamon, which are family crests. Each samurai family had their own, much like a European knight had a coat of arms. There are major differences, but those with more knowledge than I can sort that out. Or, you can do some research, which is the preferred option. \n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: tmfk16 &lt;moto420xr@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Saturday, March 29, 2008 10:36:49 AM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] looking for the symbol&#39;s of the samurai?\n\nI am trying to find the sign&#39;s of the Samurai. I think that there are \n42 sign&#39;s in all. These are drawing&#39;s, that represent the symbol&#39;s of \nthe Samurai. Some look like mushroom cap&#39;s, with other line&#39;s drawn \naround them. Sort of like the modern Day bio hazard symbol. Can anyone \ndirect Me to a link, where I can find these? Thanks.
