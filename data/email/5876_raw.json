Alternatively, put somebody else text\nin quotes. \n\n&gt; I tend to top-post because I do snip the previous\n&gt; posts to shreds....  we don&#39;t need to keep all that\n&gt; stuff going around the \n&gt; universe in perpetuity... getting to the bottom of\n&gt; it literally takes for-ev-er.\n\nThat&#39;s why you delete anything you aren&#39;t responding\nto, and either reply point by point in the text (like\nI am now), or bottom post. That way, the message looks\nlike:\n\n---Silly Know Nothing wrote:\n\n&gt; who would win between a samurai and a martian?\n\nYou&#39;re an idiot. \n\nNate\n\n(end of sample message). \n\n&gt; What sayeth the ListGods? How shall we do obeisance\n&gt; to Thy Wills?\n\nSince the Head List God seems to be on sabbatical,\nthis minor demi-god has given his viewpoint. Honestly,\nI don&#39;t care--as long as people make things clear.\nPLEASE, when you reply to someone else&#39;s post, a.\ndelete what&#39;s superfluous to your reply, but b. leave\nSOMETHING to let us know to whom you are replying.\nWhile it&#39;s a pain to sift through 4 emails stuck\ntogether to figure out who&#39;s posted last/first, it&#39;s\nequally frustrating to get an email that simply says\n\n&quot;Hey, thanks!&quot; with no reference to who they are\nthanking or the reason for the thanks. \n\nI will say I do agree with Tony, it makes more sense\nto either bottom post or respond point by point, but\nwill refrain from enforcing any standard unless things\njust get simply ridiculous. \n\nNate\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nCheck out the new Yahoo!
