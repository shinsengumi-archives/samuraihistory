For the rest \n  of us- We now have two distinct dates. 1545 and 1615. Remember \n  jakotsu&#39;s encounter with the matchlock wielding riflemen? There were \n  no flintlocks in Japan before the Portugese came in 1545. In 1615 the \n  Tokogowan victor&#39;s (NobuNaga) first act (after using rifles to win \n  the Great Battle which united the clans in 1615) was to ban and \n  outlaw &#39;all&#39; firearms. Therefore it is twixt 1545 and 1615 that IY is \n  laid. Another one for you- why are IY and his bro considered &#39;Lords&#39;? \n  More later. Toodles-K&K\n  .\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
