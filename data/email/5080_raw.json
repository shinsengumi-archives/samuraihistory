I&#39;ve been lurking here a while \nand learnd alot. Thanks\n\nI&#39;m mostly, or more or less exclusively, interested in japanese history from \nthe 14th to 16th century (I&#39;m interesten in the history leading up to that \ntoo, but thats where most of my interest lie) I think the reason for this is \nthat I&#39;m studying Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu (which stems from 1447), \nand I&#39;m one of those who thinks the gun ruind the samurai (you all know \nthose guys, don&#39;t you? ;) )\n\nI&#39;m trying to find info on the Onin war battles... things like what kind of \narmor thay used (difference between upper class, middle class and lower \nclass armor), and the battle tactics of the day (formations ect.) and so \non... so do you guys know of any good books and/or web sites on this time \nspan in japanese history which touch on some of or all of these subjects I \nwould verry much appreciate it. (I&#39;m also iterested in battle paintings or \nprints from this time frame)\n\nthanks alot! and thanks for a great mailing list.\n\nMarius.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar ï¿½ get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n"
