Unlike its better known counterpart, the medieval armor, the\n&gt; Japanese example was much lighter, which provided for ease of\n&gt; movement but compromised protection. The armor had to be light weight\n&gt; because the Samurai would often engage into hand to hand combat,\n&gt; requiring fast and precise movements. ***The majority of the armor\n&gt; was made from bamboo***.&quot; (asterisks are my addition).\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t you just love the internet...\n\nUsually, but not always.\n\nThere are idiots under every rock.\n\nExcuse me, I have to go stick my finger down my throat....\n\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
