Back in the 1500s a man \nnamed Hayashizaki Jinsuke Minamoto no Shigenobu sought to learn the sword \narts in order to avenge the death of his father.  During the course of his \nstudy he spent a series of days praying and meditating at the Hayashizaki \nJinja during which he received a &quot;divine vision&quot; of techniques involving \ndrawing the katana and cutting the opponent all in the same motion.  After \nsome more training he sought out his fathers killer and exacted his revenge. \n  Having repaid his debt to the memory of his father he then founded his own \nswordsmanship style.  At the time techniques like that were called \nbattou-jutsu techniques.  The name &quot;Iaido&quot; did not come around until the \nearly 20th Century when a swordsman name Nakayama Hakudo took his gathered \nknowledge of (I believe) six different styles based off of Hayashizaki&#39;s \nteachings and found his own style, called Muso Shinden Ryu Iaido.\n  That is as good of a quick definition that I can give you.  If you have \nany more questions about Iaido, be they technical or theoretical, feel free \nto ask me.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWatch LIVE baseball games on your computer with MLB.TV, included with MSN \nPremium! \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/mlb&pgmarket=en-us/go/onm00200439ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
