Nonetheless, there is NO\n&gt; sufficient \n&gt; documentation to prove the story was true (Iris\n&gt; Chang says is true, but \n&gt; it is very debatable). One of the arguments to\n&gt; disimiss the story as a \n&gt; lie says that it would need quite a few katana to\n&gt; chop several heads. \n&gt; The count was supposedly 106 to 105 for Mukai.\n&gt; Anyway, I hope I did not open a can of worms.\n&gt; Horrible things happened \n&gt; in Nanking, we all know that.\n&gt; cepo\n\nCarrying/using swords and &quot;being samurai&quot; are 2\ncompletely different things, as I&#39;m sure you know.\nThis debate keeps getting more and more ridiculous. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
