Better put on your flak jacket, bullets are about to fly...\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cepooooo&quot; &lt;cepo@e...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; After studying premodern Japanese history for a few years through \nthe texts of the \n&gt; classic American historians (Keene, Varley, Hall, etc.), I finally \ngot me a couple of \n&gt; books from Stephen Turnbull. While he is not associated with any \ngreat University, his \n&gt; work seems to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is not an amazing \nwriter ( imean; his \n&gt; style), but he seems to be truly in love with the subject, and I \nreally like the way he \n&gt; fills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind of (perhaps?) \nself-made scholarship \n&gt; is available.\n&gt; Since this is the first time I write, I was wondering what \nyou &quot;samurai-maniacs&quot; public \n&gt; think of Turnbull in general.\n&gt; Any book you would suggest in particular?\n&gt; Thanx,\n&gt; cepo\n\n\n\nYahoo!
