Should one oil the \nblade periodically? If so, what is the best kind of oil to use? Is \nthe anything else which should be done? What about  the scabbard? \nWhat maintence and care should be taken with it? Advise will be \nappreciated.\n\nIncidentally, this is a modern sword and is sold in Japan \nunsharpened. Sholud I leave it that way? Is it possible to sharpen \nthese swords? If so is it desirable to have it sharpened?\n\nEven though the sword is not sharpened, My friend had to get a police \npermit to buy one. This took several months. On the way to the \nstates, three times he was required to open the box and show it to \ninspectors at various airports.\n\n Even though this this is not a collectors item it is very beautiful \nand authentic looking and I am very proud of it. I have another \nsword, but that was is very cheap looking with lots of plastic on the \nhandle. (Also a gift however, so the thought was there.)\n\n\n"
