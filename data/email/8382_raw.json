They don&#39;t look any more screwed up than any other country and are better off than most.\n\nWhat changes for the better or worse would have occurred if they weren&#39;t isolated?\n\n&gt; From: Thodoris Dimaras &lt;thdimaras@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As it&#39;s been pointed out before &quot;It&#39;s the economy,\n&gt;stupid!&quot;\n\nExcellent summary.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Rob&quot; &lt;capt_bochan@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Tokugawa\n&gt;\n&gt;It was from the beginning a solid understanding and practice of \n&gt;Confucian political beleifs and studies. \n\n???? More like &#39;The Prince&#39; I would say. The other baggage was brought in later as a method to bolster the regime.\n\n&gt;This has been well documented and is without argument. \n\nPlease list sources then.\n\n&gt;Rather my change of subject conversation was how modern Japan has developed, no, rather profitted from 200 years of \n&gt;Tokugawa control. \n\nSince my wayback machine with the God attachment is broken I will spin some postulates.\n\n1. Japan has been through several periods of wildly importing foreign cultures and ideas, this one will end in the 1650s and not the early 1600&#39;s.\n\n2. Japan figures out that &#39;our ships really suck, let&#39;s copy even more Western ships&#39;. Also guns are good but cannons are sweet!\n\n3. Hey there&#39;s lots of money, land and power up for grabs locally if you have a good navy and army! \n\nThe Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere starts 300 years early. Japan controls the Far East for all intents and purpose in the mid 1850s.\n\nOf course I don&#39;t know if that would really be a benefit or not. I suspect the rest of Asia would not think so.\n\n\n&gt;Starting with Ueyesu the Tokugawas ruled unlike any other leaders. \n\nYou will have to be far more specific about this one. Name one unique attribute or action.\n\n&gt;My thoughts were directed more to the enforcement of non \n&gt;militaristic training for all Tokugawa senior warriors such as the \n&gt;arts, his mircomanagement of all aspects of daily life from the only \n&gt;approved design and measurement of building houses to how a bucket of \n&gt;rice was to be sold and on to even what could and could not be spoken \n&gt;of in public. \n\nMany of the regulations came long after Ieyasu, its in the nature of bureacrats to create more rules as time goes by.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
