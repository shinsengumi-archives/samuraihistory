Now they are \nusing=\r\n the Mibu Clan (the Shinsengumi) as the baddies too. They come \noff after l=\r\nast night&#39;s eppy as being a cross twixt alchemists and \nthe &#39;True Knights&#39; =\r\n(the Knights Templar aka the Rosicrucians or \nKnights of the Rosy Cross) of=\r\n the Crusades. There are striking \nsimilarities too. Both had a working kno=\r\nwledge of nature, both were \nconcerned with history, both used alchemy (wha=\r\nt else is Kyo&#39;s body \nbut an alchemical wonder?), both were rumoured to pos=\r\nsess secrets of \ntime travel, both were wealthy and both were persecuted by=\r\n the higher-\nups. After all that is why Friday the 13th is unlucky. It&#39;s th=\r\ne day \nthe Pope hanged Sir Gilles de Mourignay the Templar Leader for \nrefu=\r\nsing to disclose the location of the Templar fortune. By the way, \nthe Temp=\r\nlars founded the banking industry and created credit cards \ntoo. One more t=\r\nhing- Mageria has the secret of seeing the future. Is \nhe also a Mibu Clans=\r\nman? This explains how Yui (think I got it spelt \nOK this time) or rather h=\r\ner brother came to possess a weapon not to \nbe invented for a few more cent=\r\nuries. Time travel? If I knew all this \nstuff about SDK I would have added =\r\nsome of &#39;em to my ff. Well more \nsoon since tonight is the demonic castle a=\r\nt Sekigahara. A last note \nhere- Is it a coincidence that Kyoto (old capito=\r\nl) and Tokyo (new \ncapitol) are anagrams of each other? See you soon. Kami =\r\nbless. \nToodles-K&K\n\n- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jason Adams&quot; \n&lt;b=\r\nanditt_adams@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; You would be suprised how often Nobunaga is ca=\r\nst as a demon-type\n&gt; villain in anime and video games.  Or just a villain i=\r\nn general.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagashino was a tactical brilliance that revolutionized w=\r\narfare, \nbut a\n&gt; *lot* of folks didnt think it was to honorable.  Plus he w=\r\nas a \nlittle\n&gt; taken with being eccentric and anything foreign.  Many saw h=\r\nim as \nthe\n&gt; downfall of society if he had ruled Japan.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Madman, Geni=\r\nus, same thing :)  \n&gt; -Jason\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;keiman0&quot; &lt;KeimanZero@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have just finished reading all a=\r\nbout the great Oda Nobunaga of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Toshogowa Clan (hope I spelt that =\r\ncorrectly) and then I was \nwatching \n&gt; &gt; Samurai Deeper Kyo the other eveni=\r\nng and wowie- The noble \nNobunaga has \n&gt; &gt; been cast as the main villain of=\r\n the piece (Spoilers)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He is supposedly a demon king who came to ea=\r\nrth four years ago at \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Battle of Sekigahara (which I now know was =\r\nin 1600) and is \nseeking his \n&gt; &gt; body as is Kyo or Demon Eyes Kyo as they =\r\ncall him. Why? So he can \nbe \n&gt; &gt; resurrected as a terrible monster and tak=\r\ne over Earth. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was saddened to see such a noble hero thus portra=\r\nyed. More \nlater \n&gt; &gt; perhaps. Have a glorious day. Toodles-K&K\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
