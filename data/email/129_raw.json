Please \ntake a moment to review this message.\n\nThis is a moderated forum.  Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly \ndeleted at the moderator(s) discretion.  Please do not take offense \nif one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep \neverything on topic.  Follow up posts like &quot;Thanks!&quot; etc. are not \nnecessary and may be deleted at the discretion of the moderator(s). \n\nModerated status is more or less temporary and hinge on the whim of \nthe moderator(s) - after you post a few interesting and useful \nposts / replies you will be removed from moderated status, and be \nfree to post unmoderated at will. In VERY rare cases, you may be put \nback on moderated status in cases of obvious abuse.\n\nIf you do post consistently and feel you are contributing but have \nnot been removed from moderated status, blame the moderator(s) - \nwe&#39;ve probably just overlooked you ;)\n\n\nTo start sending messages to members of this group, \nsimply send email to \n\nsamuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n\nIf you do not wish to belong to samuraihistory, you may \nunsubscribe by sending an email to \n\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\nYou may also visit the Yahoo!
