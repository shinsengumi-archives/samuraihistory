MAJOR Spoilers in here. If ya intend to watch Ep\n&gt;25(final one) of Gasaraki DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!! OK Gasaraki is the name\n&gt;of an ancient race of aliens who came to this planet millions of years ago,\n&gt;monkeyed around with life and discovered the secrets of eternity! Problem \n&gt;is\n&gt;until someone discovered what they already knew they could not pass on to\n&gt;the next level! The third son of the GOWAs discovered and wanted to exploit\n&gt;this secret. Problem was Papa was against it. So he had to go. No 3 shoots\n&gt;him as he is using the youngest GOWA the daughter as a Kai to awaken\n&gt;Gasaraki. Then a lot of junk about the end of civilization a la &quot;Dr\n&gt;Strangelove&#39;s&quot; final scenes. Then Yugi rescues his sister and Miharu but \n&gt;No.\n&gt;3 is taken! Want more? Watch it.
