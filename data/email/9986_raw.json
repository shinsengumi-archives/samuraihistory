However, this essay n=\r\needs to be coached in terms historiographical arguement and complaining. Th=\r\nat just leaves me with just=A0Berry in english with her whole Hideyoshi-coa=\r\nltion/ Federalism arguement.\n=A0\nI would like to know if anyone can link me=\r\n to other arguments that Nobunaga was not so sucessful or that his success =\r\nlacked the depth=A0or structures=A0needed to forge a long-lasting reunifica=\r\ntion settlement of the kind the Tokugawa achieved; even if he had lived lon=\r\nger. I&#39;ve been looking at the usual suspects Berry, Lamers, Cambridge Histo=\r\nry, etc. Recommendations or opinions of historians outside the English corp=\r\nus of literature would be most appreciated.\n=A0\nPS: are any of the samurai =\r\narchives forum admins out there, erm...your site is not=A0sending me the co=\r\nnfirmation email so I can post there.
