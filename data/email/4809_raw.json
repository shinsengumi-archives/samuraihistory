At least in terms of imperial\n&gt; connection and relationship with the \n&gt; throne.\n\nAnd I find it doubtful that he could&#39;t have taken the\ntitle of Shogun because he wasn&#39;t of &quot;Minamoto&quot;\nblood--neither was Oda Nobunaga, and he was offered\nthe title by members of the Court. \n\n&gt; &gt; Actually he is a peasant from Totomi,also the\n&gt; province of\n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga;and became foot soldier in Nobunaga&#39;s\n&gt; army.He was promoted to become\n&gt; &gt; a military commander because of his spectacular\n&gt; brillance.\n\nUm, no, it&#39;s well documented that he was from\nNakamura, a village in Owari, Nobunaga&#39;s home\nprovince. Currently Nakamura is a district in the city\nof Nagoya. Many of Hideyoshi&#39;s later vassals,\nincluding Kato Kiyomasa, are also from Nakamura. \n\n&gt; Again, not quite. Ieyasu was the leader of the\n&gt; EASTERN alliance. Mitsunari was \n&gt; calling the shots (although the nominal leader was\n&gt; Mï¿½ri Motonari) of the Western \n&gt; alliance. And Mitsunari had never been one of the\n&gt; regents.\n\nTOny, wouldn&#39;t that be Terumoto? Motonari was dead,\nright?\n&gt; &gt; This did not pose any difficulty for him since\n&gt; &gt; he is of a Minamoto lineage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, maybe. The fact of his multiple genealogies --\n&gt; with different backgrounds \n&gt; (Taira, Minamoto, Fujiwara, what have you) is well\n&gt; documented. In this case, the \n&gt; Minamoto one was more useful, and became the\n&gt; &quot;official&quot; one. :)\n\nTony, why do you think he went with the Minamoto bio\nand the title of Shogun, as opposed to following the\nNobunaga/Hideyoshi pattern of more &quot;courtly&quot; ranks\nlike Dajo Daijin and Kampaku?\n\nI&#39;m supposing because he wanted to remain separated\nfrom the Court, having seen what it did to the\nAshikaga, but that&#39;s just supposition.\n\nNate \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
