This is because there&#39;s been a major denial of service\nattack going on against a few big ISPs and our host servers are included\nin the fun. They&#39;ve upgraded and the site is running but you may hit the\noccasional hiccup. Just reload your page and be a little patient and\nyou&#39;ll get where you&#39;re going. We designed the site for high transfer\nrates and low &quot;bells and whistles&quot; so it seems to be OK so far.\n\nAny graphic designers out there want to work on a small project each\nmonth? If so drop me a line, I&#39;ve got an idea that may be some fun.\n\nDon&#39;t forget to check out the EJMAS site itself, lots of archived material\nto dig through with 8 publications and an encyclopedia. If you&#39;re\nresearching in the martial arts I highly recommend checking us out first.\n\nAnd don&#39;t forget please that all of this is free for your use. Do help us\nkeep it up by perhaps clicking on the tips jar while reading an especially\ngood article, or visiting one of our sponsors who help us pay the\nbills. You may be able to buy your next piece of equipment cheaper down at\nthe dollar store but those guys aren&#39;t spending several hours every month\nmaking sure you&#39;ve got your regular fix of entertainment and education now\nare they?\n\nThere are seminars in July on both the east and west coasts of North\nAmerica sponsored by EJMAS so check them out from the main page\nhttp://ejmas.com/ You&#39;ll find some good instruction there too.\n\nOnce more, I&#39;d like to invite everyone to copy this email to any person or\nlist you think would welcome it.\n\nKim Taylor\nejmas.com\n\n==========================================\n\n"
