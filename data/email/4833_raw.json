Now I \ndon&#39;t know when but they got extended for battle and instead of \ncarrying two they actually carried THREE one in each hand and one \ntucked into their belt. When entering battle they would run towards \nthere enemies throwing one of the sai&#39;s  at the enemy then drew the \nthird one ready for combat. \nI have 2 pare of Sai&#39;s and believe them to be deadly in experienced \nhands. Sai&#39;s are the ultimate disarming weapons in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
