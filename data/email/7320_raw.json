JUST HOW MUCH FACT OR FICTION IS heaven and/on earth?\n\nmerridewe &lt;merridewe@...&gt; wrote:Well of course Dances with Samurai -- er, I mean The Last Samurai, was\nbased on the Satsuma rebellion, the character of Katsumoto standing in\nfor actual leader Saigo Takamori. But that&#39;s a Hollywood picture,\ncertinly not a genuine samurai film. \n\nSee most samurai films take place in either the Sengoku or Tokugawa\nperiods. All the films in my book are thus, with the exception of Gate\nof Hell and a couple of Lady Snowblood pictures. The Meiji Restoration\nessentially did away with the samurai, so it&#39;s never been considered a\nproper historical setting for a tale of samurai. Japanese films come\nin two flavors: Jidai-geki (set before 1868) and gendai-geki (after\n1868). 1868 as we all know was the year of the Meiji Restoration, so\nsamurai and their adventures are usually set before this pivotal year\nthat marked a radical shift in the government and culture of Japan.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, burker1@a... wrote:\n&gt; Can   you tell me if there have been any movies about the historical\nSatsuma \n&gt; Rebellion of 1877?\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 7/16/05 6:30:18 PM, merridewe@y... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those of you who like samurai films, I wrote a book:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The Samurai Film Handbook\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a website that describes it:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://cyberpat.com/samurai\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope you will find it entertaining and enlightening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Patrick Galloway\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
