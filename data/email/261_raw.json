In all\n&gt; my years of reading and studying Japanese Samurai history, I have\n&gt; NEVER come accross anything even remotely resembling &#39;a group of\n&gt; samurai practicing karate together in a dojo&#39; (quote is my own).  I\n&gt; have never seen any references to unarmed combat training, and don&#39;t\n&gt; see much use for it anyway.  The samurai studied weapons, which is\n&gt; common sense, of course.  I don&#39;t believe (and this is opinion) that\n&gt; even &#39;powerful samurai families&#39; employed &#39;martial artists&#39; to teach\n&gt; them unarmed combat.  from my limited (6 years of martial arts\n&gt; training about 10 years ago or so - and my studying of martial arts\n&gt; history) is that unarmed combat originated in Okinawa, and at best\n&gt; 200 - 300 years ago.  I&#39;m sure that judo or jujitsu-like &#39;wrestling&#39;\n&gt; probably existed, but I doubt that Takeda Shingen or Oda Nobunaga\n&gt; hired martial arts experts to train there armies in the way of\n&gt; unarmed combat.  I would hazzard to guess based on what I&#39;ve read\n&gt; (and thus on what I &#39;haven&#39;t&#39; come accross) that mass training for\n&gt; the armies wasn&#39;t too common - even weapons training.  most ashigaru\n&gt; probably went out and cut themselves a bamboo spear and just charged\n&gt; into battle hoping for the best.  I would assume that any martial\n&gt; training with weapons was done on one&#39;s own, and not through\n&gt; a &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or closest to the lord,\n&gt; who would receive sword training.  Anyway, my point is that I&#39;ve\n&gt; never seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts training in\n&gt; the &#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books.  At best the subject comes up\n&gt; in the VERY questionable &#39;martial arts history books&#39;.  If someone\n&gt; has info on martial arts training from a &#39;reputable source&#39; PLEASE\n&gt; respond to this post.  I am curious about this simply because it is\n&gt; not something covered by Hall, Varley, Sansom, Berry, or the others.\n&gt;\n\nYou&#39;d be surprised. There is an old martial art (the name of which escapes\nme for the moment) which is, essentially, &quot;wrestling in armour.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s a very practical thing to learn to do, if you&#39;re an armoured warrior\nwho periodically has to fight in close quarters. You learn how to grab and\nsecure people wearing armour (where to grab, etc.) and how to avoid being\ngrabbed while in armour.\n\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
