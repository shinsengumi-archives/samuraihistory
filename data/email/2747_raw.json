So I find your &#39;story&#39; a bit \nunrelated...\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Lee Changsub &lt;knorr31@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Dear Cesare:\n&gt; I do appreciate for your extensive study and stay in\n&gt; Japan and bondage through your marriage. But, let me\n&gt; tell you one story...\n&gt; \n&gt; One of American professors I used to know personally\n&gt; stayed for only a few days in Japan when he was in his\n&gt; early thirties. Yet, he met the Japanese prime\n&gt; minister for a talk.\n&gt; Staying 5 years in Japan and interrogating &#39;a\n&gt; gazillion of&#39; young Japanese friends sounds indeed\n&gt; scholastic.\n&gt; But I wonder if it would be the same experience for\n&gt; you if you also could visit Japan 5 days and meet a\n&gt; Japanese prime minister and other noble families.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe, you have to expand your Japanese network with\n&gt; more emphasis on quality instead on quantity.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                             Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                             Changsub Lee\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, I have asked a gazillion of young\n&gt; &gt; Japanese friends what \n&gt; &gt; was their family doing in the Tokugawa period, and\n&gt; &gt; only TWO could \n&gt; &gt; answer. My wife comes from\n&gt; &gt; a noble family of \n&gt; &gt; scholars from Kyoto, but she did not know!! I had to\n&gt; &gt; do the research \n&gt; &gt; for her!!!! Phew.\n&gt; &gt; cepo\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New Yahoo!
