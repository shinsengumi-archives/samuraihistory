Most of the films here have been well \ndiscussed, and=\r\n deserve their status. While I have lots of (very) \nobscure favorites, thes=\r\ne are all benchmark films. \n1)Seven Samurai-simply the best. \n2)Kwaidan-the=\r\n Japanese were (and are) very superstitious, and this \ncompilation of four =\r\nmacabre tales is excellent. Art direction, \nphotography, acting, and sound =\r\nare all top notch. The highlight is \nthe segment involving the spirits of t=\r\nhe Taira from the battle of Dan-\nNo-Ura.\n3)Shogun-yeah, the 2 hour movie ve=\r\nrsion sucked. And it&#39;s loaded with \nhistorical inaccuracies. But the 12 hou=\r\nr mini has stunning sets, \ncostuming, great acting (from the Japanese part =\r\nof the cast-never \nbeen a Chamberlain fan) and an involving story. Were it =\r\nnot for \nShogun, much of the Western interest in Japanese history and cinem=\r\na \nwould never have happened. The King Of Ninja Misinformation, Stephen \nHa=\r\nyes, makes his split second film debut.\n4)Castle of The Spider&#39;s Web (Thron=\r\ne Of Blood)-great performance by \nMifune along with Kurosawa&#39;s typically fa=\r\nntastic art direction and \nphotography. This is his samurai flavored remake=\r\n of Macbeth. \n5)Heaven & Earth-Some folks really hate this film. I think it=\r\n&#39;s \ngreat. The battle scenes are among the best ever put to screen \n(albeit=\r\n relatively bloodless). While the backstory of Uesugi Kenshin \nwas well don=\r\ne, the film could have stood a bit more of it. The \njuxtaposition of the ba=\r\nttles with scenes of nature is very Japanese.\n6)Daimajin-a great samurai fi=\r\nlm all on its own, AND you get one of \nthe most convincing Japanese giant m=\r\nonsters too! The evil god Majin \ninhabits the stone state of the province&#39;s=\r\n protector and mashes the \nbad guys in the closing minutes of the film. If =\r\nyou went into this \nfilm cold, it&#39;s left up in the air whether Majin is jus=\r\nt a legend or \nthe real thing until he makes his grand appearance.\n7)Hanzo =\r\nThe Razor:The Snare-a great break from the tired genre of \nnoble ronin film=\r\ns. The Hanzo films work as drama, parody, comedy and \nchambara. It&#39;s still =\r\nhard to believe Katsu could make such disparate \ncharacters as Hanzo and Za=\r\ntoichi work-it&#39;s sometimes incomprehensible \nthat it&#39;s the same guy. And sp=\r\neaking of hard, the Hanzo films take \nthe genre to new heights of bizarre s=\r\net pieces.\n8)Yojimbo-set the standard for the `anti hero&#39; ronin film, and d=\r\nid it \nwith style.\n9)Zatoichi & The Festival Of Fire-you could plug just ab=\r\nout any \nZatoichi film into this slot-they&#39;re basically all the same, but \n=\r\nalways enjoyable. For my money, Zatoichi is the best recurring \ncharacter i=\r\nn Japanese cinema (other than Godzilla). The recent remake \nis good too.\n10=\r\n)Hara Kiri-the best of the noble ronin films, the 2 =BD hrs just fly \nby. R=\r\niveting performances and a completely believable story. You&#39;ll \nbe hating t=\r\nhe Ii clan after seeing this.\nHonorable mention to Ran and Kagemusha, both =\r\nof which are classics \nbut just flawed enough to keep them out of my top 10=\r\n. \nAnd for best Taiga drama-Toshiie & Matsu. OK, it&#39;s a `chick&#39; Taiga \ndram=\r\na, but Toshiie is such an engaging goof and Matsu is just plain \nadorable.\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n"
