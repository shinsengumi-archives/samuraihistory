So\n&gt; I&#39;ll comment up here to the two specific points that\n&gt; I copied below:\n&gt; \n&gt; First, Why do you think that the main character\n&gt; reflects what a western view\n&gt; of a samurai should be? Was the director western?\n&gt; Was the scriptwriter\n&gt; western? I don&#39;t believe so. So what makes the\n&gt; viewpoint &quot;western&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, a ronin had (not &quot;has&quot;; we don&#39;t have any\n&gt; more ronin or samurai in\n&gt; this present day) the right to commit seppuku, just\n&gt; as any member of the\n&gt; bushi class had. \n&gt; \n&gt; The question involving the 47 Ako ronin who avenged\n&gt; their lord, then turned\n&gt; themselves in, was a question that faced any samurai\n&gt; or commoner who\n&gt; performed a vendetta without registering it first\n&gt; with the bakufu; doing a\n&gt; vendetta without registering it first was a criminal\n&gt; act in 1702 that would\n&gt; merit execution as a common criminal. So the bakufu\n&gt; had to decide whether\n&gt; the Ako ronin were to be executed as common\n&gt; criminals or allowed to go free\n&gt; or what the punishment should be. According to what\n&gt; I&#39;ve read, there was a\n&gt; sharp debate about this. A compromise was reached\n&gt; that the ronin had to die,\n&gt; but instead of being executed as criminals, they\n&gt; would be allowed to die by\n&gt; seppuku. \n&gt; \n&gt; NinaThe screen writer of the film (Akira Kurosawa),\nwhile one of the great film makers in the world, was\noften criticized in Japan for being too western and\nhad trouble getting some of his films made without\nwestern backing.  The idea of an accountant that uses\na ploy to trick kenjutsu masters into feeding him\n(effectively begging) then when he finally can fence,\nfencing for money is all despicable in the eyes of\nsamurai (as they made clear at the end of the film). \nThe samurai (masterfully portrayed by Mifune Shiro)\nwas an amazing swordsman and a very nice man, but by\n�period� samurai standards, not a worthy samurai. \nThis is not a story about a great samurai, it is at\nits heart a love story and the relationship between a\nman and his wife and how she grows to respect him and\nlove him not for who she wants him to become but for\nwho he is.\n\nAs far as the rest of it goes Nina (the 47 Ronin\nstory), I can see you have let ego get involved and\nyou are picking nits with grammer so I will not\ncomment on what you said next.  Somehow I feel it is a\ntone unworthy of this topic.\n\nMichael\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo! Mail - PC Magazine Editors&#39; Choice 2005 \nhttp://mail.yahoo.com\n\n\n\n"
