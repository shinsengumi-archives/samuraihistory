The status of objects such as a vast gold fan which \nhe carried at his many battles led to years of negotiations over \ntheir first loan for showing abroad. \n&quot;It has been a triumph for international cooperation,&quot; said Paul \nEvans, chief executive of the Royal Armouries, which will return a \nnumber of the most delicate artworks after only six weeks as their \nfragile condition requires limited exposure to light. \n\n&quot;It has called on all the expertise, diplomacy and determination of \nthe staff of the Royal Armouries and the Nikko Toshogu shrine \n(dedicated to the Shogun) to bring to life the story of a great \nman.&quot; \n\nLaunched yesterday with a hair-raising display of Yabusame, the high-\nspeed mounted archery which won Tokugawa&#39;s battles, the exhibition \nalso shows the mismatch in understanding between Japan and the west \nfor centuries. In spite of the presence of men such as Adams, an \nArmada war veteran who advised the Shogun on naval policy, ignorance \nwas sometimes spectacular. \n\nThe exhibition includes a presentation suit of armour sent by the \nShogun to England&#39;s King James I which within 30 years was \ncatalogued at the Tower of London as &quot;a gift from the Great Moghul&quot; \n(of India). Even greater indignities were inflicted on similar suits \nsent to the court in Austria, where they were reclassified for \ndiplomatic purposes to do with the conquest of Mexico as &quot;having \nbelonged to Montezuma and his son&quot;. \n\nShogun is at the Royal Armouries until August 30 \n\n\n\n\n\n"
