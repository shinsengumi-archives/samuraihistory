While I am a big Japanese \nhistory fan I have mostly studied the naval history from the \nformation of the Japanese navy up till WWII.\n\nI am the founder of the Russo-Japanese War Research Society and have \nauthored several naval wargames dealing with Japanese history. I \nknow, what am I doing here? Well I try not to limit myself and have \nrecently developed a great interest in the samurai period of Japan.\n\nA quick question, are there any samurai miniatures players here. If \nso what set of rules would you suggest? I am willing to help out with \nany naval matters that I can address and I am looking forward to \ninteracting with the group if you do not mind my stupid questions.\n\nOff to start researching!\n\nCheers\nBill M.\nhttp://www.russojapanesewar.com\n\n\nHi Bill\n\nI mainly lurk here, but yes I collect and game with miniatures, and have\n&quot;around&quot; 1000 25/28mm Samurai miniatures.\n\nLike most wargamers, only a small percentage of these are painted!\n\nI play Warhammer Ancient Battles but my job title might give a clue as to\nwhy that is !!\n\nThere are a number of other rule sets out there, some specialising in\nSamurai warfare, I have them, but never tried them.\n\nTheres another yahoo group called gekokujo which tends to focus more on the\ngaming aspects of samurai warfare, and so if wargaming is an interest, you\nmay find that group useful.\n\nIf you have any particular questions on the gaming side you can ask always\ndrop me a note off line, or here.\n\nKind regards\n\nRob\n\nRob Broom\nWarhammer Historical General Manager\nrobb@...\nwww.warhammer-historical.com\n\n\n"
