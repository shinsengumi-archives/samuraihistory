Pre Tokugawa? Tokugawa? After America sought trade?\n&gt; Between Edo and Kyoto, I am unsure which city would be more\n&gt; interesting. Edo is a distance from Kyoto. Did more action\n&gt; take place in and/or around Kyoto? I can look within an\n&gt; encyclopedias but I would rather focus on one time period\n&gt; at a time; I get overwhelmed. You folks can supply me with\n&gt; more detail in certain areas than an encyclopedia can. I\n&gt; would appreciate your time and knowledge.
