Leiden: Hotei Publishing, 2000. 280 pp.\nTables, maps, notes, bibliography, and index. $65.00 (cloth),ISBN 90-\n74822-22-3.\nReviewed for H-Japan by Suzanne Gay &lt;suzanne.gay@...&gt;,\nEast Asian Studies Program, Oberlin CollegeA New Biography of Oda \nNobunaga\n\nJeroen Lamers has written a biography of Oda Nobunaga, the\nsixteenth century warrior who was the first of the so-called\nthree great unifiers of early modern Japan.  The study focuses\nparticularly on the policies and actions of Nobunaga during the\nyears of his national ascendancy, 1568-82.  Mr. Lamers has\nconsulted a wide range of contemporary sources: in addition to\nnumerous official documents, these include the Shincho Kyou-ki\nby Oota Gyuuichi, Nobunaga&#39;s first chronicler, the Jesuit\nrecords, and diaries like the Kanemi Kyou-ki and Tokitsugu\nKyou-ki.  Mr.  Lamers has also taken full measure of the works\nof Japanese and western historians in his treatment of thisimportant \nfigure.\n\nThis monograph contributes in several important ways to the\nliterature on Nobunaga and sixteenth century Japan.  First, it\nis the only thorough treatment of Nobunaga&#39;s career and\nachievements in a western language.  Although we have read about\nNobunaga, or at least Nobunaga&#39;s policies, in the context of the\nSengoku period and are aware of his main achievements, it tends\nto be mainly as a forerunner to Hideyoshi and Ieyasu that he is\nremembered.  In a full treatment of his life his achievements\nare better appreciated not only for what came after him but for\nwhat he achieved in his own times.  Second, we can better\nappreciate Nobunaga&#39;s genius as a military and especially\npolitical tactician when we see the tremendous odds against\nwhich he struggled all his adult life, besieged by enemies on\nall sides.  Although the Japanese political scene fell into\ndisarray once Nobunaga was assassinated, his policies and\ncampaigns had indeed unified great portions of the country by\nthe time Hideyoshi took control.  In his drive to take Kyoto and\nin his decision to settle in Azuchi, near but not in the ancient\ncapital, Nobunaga defined himself as a national leader and not\nsimply as the head of a coalition of warriors.  Finally, by\ngiving close attention to the years 1568 through 1573, Mr.\nLamers shows the Muromachi shogunate under the active leadership\nof the last shogun, Yoshiaki, to have been much more vital and\npolitically significant even immediately prior to its demise\nthan is usually thought.\n\nMr. Lamers approaches the story of Nobunaga&#39;s life primarily as\na series of scholarly debates which he presents, analyzes and,\noften, dismisses in whole or in part.  He then puts forth his\nown revisionist conclusions, some of which are persuasive and\ncarefully considered, and certainly demonstrate familiarity with\nboth Japanese and western scholarship.  Nevertheless, this\napproach, however valid it may be in a dissertation, imparts a\npedantic quality to a biography and detracts from what should be\nthe narrative thrust of Nobunaga&#39;s life.  Some of the scholarly\njudgments, moreover, come across as excessively dismissive. Asao\nNaohiro&#39;s thinking on the concept of tenka, for instance, should\nnot be dismissed out of hand (p. 128) simply because the author\nis determined to refute the theory of Nobunaga&#39;s\nself-deification.  It is quite possible, it seems to me, that\nNobunaga had the intellectual capacity, not to mention political\nshrewdness, to apply concepts of statehood to his rule.  Mr.\nLamers, however, seems determined to portray him at all costs asa \npragmatist.\n\nMr. Lamers has extensively mined contemporary Jesuit writings in\nhis study.  These are valuable if biased sources, as he reminds\nthe reader frequently: they record events that corroborate\nJapanese sources and they contain some descriptions of Japanese\nlife not found elsewhere, but their interpretation of events is\noften self-interested.  Unfortunately, Mr. Lamers too frequently\ngets sidetracked into a determination to undermine these\nsources, and in the process the narrative of Nobunaga&#39;s life is\nrelegated to the wings: for instance, the author attacks at\nlength the Jesuits&#39; portrayal of Nobunaga as a supporter of\nChristianity, and later refutes Luis Frois&#39; assertion of\nNobunaga&#39;s self-deification.  Nobunaga&#39;s relationship with the\nJesuits was indeed one part of his consolidation of power and\nisolation of certain enemies.  The author might have analyzed it\nto explicate aspects of Nobunaga&#39;s character germane to his hold\non power: his shrewdness, his fascination with the unknown and\nthe exotic, and at the same time his prudence.  Instead, Mr.\nLamers gets caught up in showing the Jesuits to be vain and\nmisguided in their belief that Nobunaga supported them.  (This\nargument, incidentally, turns out to be a non-starter: some of\nthe sources cited show in fact a very accurate and sober Jesuit\nunderstanding of Nobunaga&#39;s motives in granting them favorable\ntreatment.)  Ultimately, the space devoted to critiquing the\nJesuit sources is disproportionate to this relatively minor\naspect of Nobunaga&#39;s life.\n\nAs the subtitle suggests, Mr. Lamers is at pains to challenge\nthe standard view of Nobunaga as a cruel and brutal tyrant.\nAgain, he implicates the Jesuits as the original culprits, with\nthe label sticking even in the most recent scholarship on\nNobunaga.  To refute this, Mr.  Lamers presents events as they\nmay have appeared to Nobunaga and argues, often persuasively,\nthat the actions he took were (simply) those of a pragmatic,\ndecisive, non-ideological, and extremely ambitious warrior.\nPerhaps so, but in the end there are enough cases of massive\nslaughter, deliberate disgrace and humiliation of less worthy\nvassals, ruthless treatment of enemies, and, to put it mildly,\niconoclastic treatment of Buddhist groups that the original\nlabel remains quite apt.  But after all, brutality was\nwidespread in the sixteenth century, and not only in Japan.  Yet\nis this the best yardstick by which to assess Nobunaga?  By\nfocusing so heavily on brutality Mr. Lamers places central\nemphasis on a moral evaluation of Nobunaga&#39;s character, in the\nprocess missing other standards by which to consider his place\nin history.  In his conclusion, which is too mild considering\nthe weight of the story he has just told, Lamers ends by merely\nsaying that &quot;the best adjectives to characterise Nobunaga&#39;s rule\nand personality are not &quot;callous and brutal&quot; but &quot;pragmatic and\nruthless&quot; (p. 232).  Surely there is more that could be said of\nthe career and contributions of this brilliant military and\npolitical tactician.  Mr. Lamers points out that the treatment\nof Nobunaga by early modern Japanese chroniclers and historians\nin the early modern period is a huge topic requiring a separate\nstudy.  Nonetheless, a summary, at least, of the early modern\nJapanese writings on Nobunaga would have balanced the attention\ngiven to Jesuit writings, and perhaps helped better define a\nhistorical niche for Nobunaga.\n\nNobunaga&#39;s reputation as a cruel and ruthless warrior rests in\npart on his treatment, audacious for its times, of institutional\nBuddhism.  In 1571 his forces attacked and burned Enryakuji, the\ngreat Tendai monastery on Mt. Hiei, and slaughtered its\nthousands of monks.  This study portrays the event as payback\nfor Enryakuji&#39;s monks joining forces opposed to Nobunaga in\nearlier conflicts--&quot;a matter of restoring his military\ncredibility and saving his personal honor&quot; (p. 76).  While\nallowing that this was an unprecedented act of sacrilege,\nhowever, Mr.  Lamers does not convey Enryakuji&#39;s powerful\nposition in the medieval economy and religion, and thus somewhat\nunderrates the importance of the event.  Quite simply, no\nearlier ruler could have even contemplated such a move.  By\nsacking Enryakuji, Nobunaga obliterated one of the foundations\nof the medieval order.  His other &quot;encounter&quot; with Buddhism was\nhis long struggle against the well-organized and persistent\nforces of the Honganji.  It is true that these forces lacked the\nmonastic character of the monks at Hiei, but ascribing\nNobunaga&#39;s motives in this campaign partly to a loathing for\n&quot;farmers&quot; is less than satisfying, especially given the carnage\nat Nagashima.  Nobunaga had a clear vision of the religious\nobstacles that stood in his way, and he pursued themrelentlessly.\nFinally, one comes away from this study with a much greater\nappreciation for Nobunaga&#39;s achievements, but without much of a\nsense of Nobunaga as a person.  Premodern sources are, of\ncourse, notoriously intractable about shedding light on\nindividuals, and Mr. Lamers eschews at the outset a\npsychohistorical approach.  Nevertheless, more discussion of\nNobunaga&#39;s character and times would have yielded a fuller\nportrait of him without requiring a foray into psychoanalysis.\nFor instance, one wonders about the sixteenth century warrior\nfamily and its ethos: was it unusual for a younger brother to\novershadow the eldest son, as Nobunaga did?  And was Nobunaga\nunusual in sometimes favoring collateral relatives over his own\nsons?  The case of Nobunaga&#39;s first marriage, dissolved over\ninter-familial politics, cries out for some discussion of\nmarriage practices.  The role in the Araki Crisis of the\nChristian daimyo with their high regard for loyalty offers an\nopportunity to discuss this virtue in the context of late\nsixteenth century Japanese warrior society.  Despite some missed\nopportunities, however, Mr. Lamers has produced a comprehensive\nand illuminating account of Nobunaga&#39;s career and policies.\n\n\tCopyright 2001 by H-Net, all rights reserved.
