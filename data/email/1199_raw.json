You are probably\nthinking of Hidetada, his heir, who had been delayed in attempting\nto take the castle of Ueda, held by Sanada Masayuki.   Ieyasu was\nfurious with Hidetada, and only a determined intervention by the\nHondas, father and son, prevented Ieyasu from disinheriting Hidetada.\nThere is an interesting description of the incident in Albert Sadler&#39;s\nbiography of Ieyasu, &quot;The Maker of Modern Japan&quot;.\nHerb Lison\n\n\nandrea Smith wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello, I&#39;m rather new, my name is Andy Joy Smith, I\n&gt; have a question about the battle of Sekigahara in\n&gt; 1600. Where was Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s son? I thought he\n&gt; was besieging a castle somewhere else, may be it&#39;s\n&gt; just my imagination.\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; HotJobs - Search new jobs daily now\n&gt; http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
