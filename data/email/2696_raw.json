No, by following the\n&gt; Bushido you are NOT a samurai, you are a\n&gt; dissillusioned individual.\n&gt; The samurai were not &quot;outlawed&quot; as some people like\n&gt; to\n&gt; believe, they had their status removed. Which means\n&gt; that if you were a samurai before the bakumatsu, you\n&gt; were NOT still a samurai in the Meiji era. The only\n&gt; possible exception might be Saigo Takamori and the\n&gt; Satsuma Rebellion. Listen, no one today is a\n&gt; samurai.\n&gt; And its really sad to think of yourself as one just\n&gt; because you follow a code of ethics from the lowest\n&gt; period in the history of the samurai.\n&gt; That being said it is great that you follow martial\n&gt; arts, I do so myself. And I&#39;d be interested in\n&gt; hearing\n&gt; what all you have to know about the historical\n&gt; samurai.\n&gt; --- kyosuke_miyamoto &lt;kyosuke_miyamoto@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello Everyone, Im Kyosuke. I&#39;m new to the forum\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; all, but I know \n&gt; &gt; a great lot about samurai, weapons, and ancient\n&gt; &gt; japan. I myself, \n&gt; &gt; follow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real\n&gt; &gt; life Samurai, though \n&gt; &gt; Samurai&#39;s have been outlawed since the late\n&gt; 1800&#39;s,\n&gt; &gt; I still consider \n&gt; &gt; myself one. I&#39;ve been to Japan, and studied the\n&gt; &gt; fighting skills from \n&gt; &gt; Sensei Ichi Hayamatsu, learned the old culture and\n&gt; &gt; the respects. And \n&gt; &gt; with this, I&#39;ve become a Samurai. I want to be the\n&gt; &gt; one to say how Im \n&gt; &gt; honored in joining this forum, and expect a lot of\n&gt; &gt; great stuff from \n&gt; &gt; you all as well. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is all.\n&gt; &gt; -Kyosuke Miyamoto\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P.S. Im also A fanatic of old Samurai Movies. If\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;d like we can \n&gt; &gt; talk of them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Protect your identity with Yahoo!
