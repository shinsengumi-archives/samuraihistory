Here is Hayes&#39;s\n&gt; profile. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371230/\n\nThe problem is, just about anyone can update IMDB. The only source that says \nHayes was in Shogun is Hayes himself. If someone at the IMDB wanted to verify \nit, they would contact Hayes and ask him if he was in it. All he has to do is \nsay &quot;yes.&quot;\n\nShort of that, one has no recourse but to contact the studio and ask for \n25-year-old records on payments made for extras. And, frankly, I doubt they have \nthose at this point. At any rate, being a guy who falls off the rigging is the \ntype of job that would be given to a professional stuntman, not some random guy \noff the street extra. Not to mention it&#39;s hardly a claim to fame.\n\nI think this claim, like so many others he makes, is pure BS.\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
