The point was to reveal your &quot;heart&quot; and show that it was not black (meaning that you were honorable). And if I remember correctly, women opted to slit their throats rather than their bellies, simply because the act of seppuku was so utterly painful that a woman generally cannot tollerate the pain. Remeber, too, that this act is to be carried out without any emotion, or any sign of pain, or the act is all for naught. Taking this into consideration, and the fact that slitting your belly was a very slow death, women would choose the quicker, less painful method of suicide. \n \n  I hope that answers it! There are a few great books that can also help you along in your research (as well as a few websites), and I&#39;d be happy to give you a short bibliography if you&#39;d like. Just let me know!\n \n -Meredith Zopf\nKenshi Zey &lt;spectresinthefog@...&gt; wrote:\nhello again,\n\ni was wondering if i could trouble you with a question or two concerning &#39;seppuku&#39; and suicide in japan,preferably during the time the samurai class existed.\n\ni had read on a website (unfortunately i cannot seem to find the link on google) about the samurai,that seppuku consisted of slicing open the belly because according to buddhist belief,the spirit resided in the belly area of the body.as i have little to none information on buddhist beliefs,i can&#39;t say whether what i read is true or not.supposing this is true,i remember a previous post concerning seppuku for women,where it said that women could commit seppuku by slashing their throats if i&#39;m not mistaken(is this limited to only women of samurai families or women before the meiji restoration or neither?).considering all this,i want to ask if the difference is simply because of religious beliefs or perhaps out of conveniency?\n\nand secondly,were there any other &#39;honourable&#39; ways to commit suicide apart from slicing open the belly?\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Like these blossoms,we all die...&quot; - Katsumoto Moritsugu\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
