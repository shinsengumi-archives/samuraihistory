I \nam\n&gt; a novelist, and am trying to find a suitable name (forename and\n&gt; surname) for one of my characters, who is Japanese.\n&gt; \n&gt; This person is descended from a famous samurai, with a first name \nthat\n&gt; has some reference to the meaning of one or more of the following:\n&gt; truth, honour, honesty, virtue, loyal, impeccable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot use Makoto for the forename. I would prefer the forename \nto\n&gt; be easily shortened according to English principles (i.e. &quot;Tad&quot; for\n&gt; Tadaka), and I would like the surname to be connected to any\n&gt; well-known samurai family or clan in Japanese history, preferably\n&gt; someone heroic. Ideally in the Shimazu family, but not necessarily.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you can be of any assistance I would be incredibly grateful. If \nI\n&gt; choose a name that is given to me, I will acknowledge the person \nin my\n&gt; &#39;thank you&#39; section in the book.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not read or speak Japanese.\n\nYou can&#39;t shorted Japanese names &quot;according to English principles&quot; \nand have them mean anything to other Japanese.  If your story was to \ntake place in Japan, &quot;Tad&quot; wouldn&#39;t mean anything to another \nJapanese person.  They don&#39;t shorten names like that. If it takes \nplace in an English speaking place around English speakers, then \nobviously that wouldnt matter.  As for &quot;Makoto&quot;, what&#39;s wrong \nwith &quot;Mack&quot;?\n\n\n\n\n"
