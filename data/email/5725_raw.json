However, understand my frustration when every\nElectronic Samurai who playes Onimusha 47 and thinks\nAkechi Samanosuke is some major, important person,\ncomes here wants information on him when very little\nexists. He&#39;s irrelevant. Not important. A Nobody.\n&quot;Third guy from left&quot; in the credits of the Sengoku\nera. \n\n   I mean, is not\n&gt; Nobunaga looked upon as a great \n&gt; figure in Japanese history?  Seriously, I&#39;m asking. \n&gt; How is Akechi Mitsuhide viewed \n&gt; in relation to the man he brought down from the\n&gt; Japanese point of view?\n\nDepends on who you ask, of course. Most sane people\nview Nobunaga as a man with tons of ambition, who\nwanted to solidify control of Japan and didn&#39;t let\nanything, including accepted moral standards or\nexpected behaviours, stand in his way. He&#39;s a classic\ncase of &quot;Ends justifies the means&quot;, and MOST people\naccept that.\n\nMitsuhide is equally complex. Some view him as the\narchetypal traitor, others view him as the only person\nwith the courage to stand up to a bullying tyrant. I\nthink he&#39;s a poor, pathetic man, a tactical genius,\nbut one who simply got pushed too far by his lord&#39;s\ntreatment of him, and who went over the edge,\nmentally. He reacted emotionally, without thorough\nplanning and solidifying a base, and so was swallowed\nup by history when Hideyoshi came and defeated him. \n\n\n The other guys?  \n&gt; Ankokuji Ekei, Saiga (Saigo) Magoichi and Fuma\n&gt; Kotaro?  There isn&#39;t much more \n&gt; on them.  If ANY.  \n\nActually, there is plenty on Ankokuji Ekei, at least. \n\nAnd besides, every one of the\n&gt; real-life characters in the \n&gt; Onimusha game -- including Samanosuke and Mori\n&gt; Ranmaru -- were dead before Yagyu \n&gt; Jubei was BORN!  \n\nThis is why I hate it when people play these games,\nand then try to equate it to historical knowledge.\nThis is the same problem I have with Rurouni\nKenshin--IT&#39;S NOT REAL. No matter how &quot;realistic&quot; any\nof this may be, it&#39;s simply NOT. Put down your XBOX\ncontroller and pick up a history book, PLEASE. Don&#39;t\nget me wrong--nothing is inherently wrong with these\ngames, or anime. But dammit, they ain&#39;t history. If\nyou do a Google search on &quot;Akechi Samanosuke&quot; and\n99.9% of the hits come up as references to a video\ngame, that ought to give you a clue that a. he&#39;s not\nreal, or b. if he is real, he wasn&#39;t that darn\nimportant. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nTake Yahoo!
