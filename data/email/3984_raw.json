Waging war upon those who are perceived enemies or threats could be criticised but wars fought to create one&#39;s identity (eg; the Vietnamese against the French, US and Allies, then China, or even the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 or the Zulu Campaigns against British rule). Expansionist wars are driven by political and ecominc gluttony but wars to create national integrity are honourable, even if the means used to fight them are not.  War is always (hopefully) used as a last resort, but for those involved there is honour, not just towards the cause but towards one&#39;s comrades. \nM.Lorimer\n\nQpaul3kato@... wrote:\nHave you ever conceived of the notion that wars are fought by some people to \nprotect even the idea that it would provide their loved ones with some measure \nof peace and safety. Is a person not honorable because they would fight for \nthose they love or beliefs they hold more sacred than the life they possess?\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
