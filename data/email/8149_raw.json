His dayimos in returned cut =\r\n\noff their topknots and said it was for his sons soul......  Would \nthis be=\r\n classified under renunciation of self?\nThanks,\nMoosho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In=\r\n samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Moosh=\r\no-\n&gt; \tA number of things are going on when a samurai cuts off his \ntopknot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; First off it is symbolic of a renunciation of secular life, of \nself.=\r\n  \n&gt; Thus a buddhist shaves his or her head when entering the monastic  \n&gt; =\r\nlife. Conversely we see Sumo wrestlers cut off their topknots \nwhen  \n&gt; end=\r\ning their (monk-like?) life in the sport and re-entering  \n&gt; pedestrian lif=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the coming of age ceremony a young samurai boy has his head \nsha=\r\nved  \n&gt; and dressed for the first time in the style of an adult. As an \nadu=\r\nlt  \n&gt; he accepts all the responsibilities of his house, his life, his \nbod=\r\ny,  \n&gt; serve his lord and by extension belong to him. He is expected to  \n&gt;=\r\n avoid any action which would bring disgrace on his lord, so he \nmust  \n&gt; a=\r\nlways dress and act properly. To fail to answer a challenge, to \ndie  \n&gt; in=\r\n a fight with your sword undrawn, to allow the name or the \nfamily- \n&gt; cres=\r\nt of ones lord to be besmirched among other crimes, would all  \n&gt; bring gre=\r\nat shame on your house and your lord.Hairstyle was a \nclear,  \n&gt; visible re=\r\npresentation of rank and position.(keep in mind these  \n&gt; customs may have =\r\nhad their origins in the age of war, but found \ntheir  \n&gt; extremes in the E=\r\ndo period)\n&gt; \n&gt; \tSo we can imagine the shock of the villagers in the Seven =\r\n\nSamurai  \n&gt; when they see a seemingly sane member of the bushi class shavi=\r\nng \nhis  \n&gt; head and removing his swords, to aid a little peasant boy. No \n=\r\nwonder  \n&gt; a crowd gathers! And Japanese filmgoers all recognize that with =\r\n\nhis  \n&gt; shaved head and the simple sash he is given he has assumed the \ngu=\r\nise  \n&gt; of a priest.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIn the film Seppuku, the hero chooses to cut off=\r\n the \ntopknots of his  \n&gt; enemies rather than their heads, knowing that if =\r\nthey were true  \n&gt; samurai they would have no choice but to kill themselves=\r\n rather \nthan  \n&gt; reveal their shame to their lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \n&gt; -t\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"
