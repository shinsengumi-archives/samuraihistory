In \nmuch the same way as &#39;most&#39; men wear trousers nowadays they were simply \nadapted to the users purpose. (Hence the &#39;tucked up&#39; varieties for farmers \nand people who had to &#39;wade&#39; in things[Blood for instance..sick but still] \netc..\n I don&#39;t believe that Hakama were formalised at all. But then again my \nknowledge of Pro-Tokugawa (1600 onwards) is not as detailed as before these \ndates.\n Check a search in E-Budo for the same question for a (MUCH!!) wider response.\n Hope this helps you.\n Ben Sharples\n\n"
