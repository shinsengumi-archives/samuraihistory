From \n  what I&#39;ve seen and heard, a terrorist usually works outside the law, working to \n  break it and create chaos.  Oda Nobunaga did no such thing.  He had the \n  sanction of Ogimachi, I believe, from about 1562.  He deposed the last Ashikaga \n  shogun, and was the first of what I&#39;ve seen called the &quot;three unifiers.&quot;  As for \n  working outside the law, he essentially WAS the law, as seen, and noted by \n  others in the group, through his repression of real or perceived threats and the \n  aforementioned deposition of Ashikaga   Yoshiaki.  There was no bigger bully on \n  the Sengoku block than Nobunaga, from Okehazama to Honnoji.  Shingen and \n  Kenshin it seems were little more than a sidenote (even if the largest of them) to \n  the Oda drive and wasn&#39;t one in some sort of alliance or another with the Oda \n  anyway?\n\n  L8r\n  Tim\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
