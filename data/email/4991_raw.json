But the edict\n&gt; banning seppuku \n&gt; was published in 1663 by the 4th Tokugawa Shogun,\n&gt; Ietsuna. To be \n&gt; precise it is actually all ritual suicide (junshi)\n&gt; that was outlawed, \n&gt; not seppuku only.\n\nCorrect me if I&#39;m wrong, Jay, but junshi does not\nequal seppuku, and seppuku does not equal junshi. The\ndefinition of junshi, as I understand it, is the\nspecific act of suicide (usually seppuku) committed by\na retainer upon the death, natural or otherwise, of\nhis lord. Junshi was committed by &#39;loyal&#39; retainers\nwho felt they couldn&#39;t serve another master. The\nBakufu&#39;s point in outlawing junshi was that the\ndaimyo&#39;s heir needed experienced counselors, etc, to\nmaintain the government of the han, and if they all\nkilled themselves upon the death of the daimyo, there\nwould be no governmental continuity and the han would\nsuffer. \n\nIt wouldn&#39;t make sense to outlaw the act of punishment\n (i.e. seppuku) the bakufu used to punish it&#39;s own\nretainers. \n \n&gt; Might it be that in 1868 - after the formal close of\n&gt; the Bakufu - the \n&gt; laws established by the Bakufu were now obsolete and\n&gt; seppuku was now b\n&gt; ack in play, or at least the status was now unclear?\n\nWell, junshi seemed to have been &#39;legal&#39;, though the\nwhole counry was shocked when Gen. Nogi and his wife\ncommitted junshi in 1910 following the death of\nMeiji-Tenno. But they still revered him enough to\nbuild a shrine, name an area, and a subway stop\n(Nogizaka) after him...\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
