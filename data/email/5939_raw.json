And the discussion is okay, depending on\nhow you go with it--if you wanted to list\ncharacteristics of a fictional character and ask if\nthey were consistent with him being a samurai in the\nhistorical sense of the word, then that&#39;s fine. As I\nsaid, having a samurai sword does not a samurai make.\nAnd the answers I&#39;ve seen to the question are leading\nit quickly into the realm of gaming and anime, and out\nof any historical context or value. The fact that the\noriginal question failed to explain what the heck a\n&quot;sephiroth&quot; is was a clue to me that it came from a\ngamer, but I let it go because it could have led to\nsome interesting discussion, if done right, and I\ndidn&#39;t have a reason NOT to let it go. \n\nPlease bring it back to the historical side, or we&#39;ll\nend it. \n\nThe assistant management (at least a payraise...?)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
