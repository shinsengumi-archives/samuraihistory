Ikko Ikki?). But contrarily to his earlier opponents, he alone \nachieved such a decisive result (thanks in part to the stubborn Takeda \nKatsuyori who was not so &quot;Great&quot; by risking it all on that day).\nNagashino is a turning point mainly because a famous clan competing for \nsupremacy, the Takeda, was eliminated of the contenders and forced to defend \nits lands until it&#39;s ultimate downfall several years later.\n\nI appologize for possible mistakes...

It gets talked about often like it was\n&gt;a breakthrough in military tactics--and I think it\n&gt;was. But not because of the rotating firing\n&gt;lines--that had been done before.\n&gt;\n&gt;To me, Nagashino confirms Nobunaga&#39;s military genius.\n&gt;Not because he used rotating firing lines, but because\n&gt;he analyzed his enemy and came up with a perfect plan\n&gt;to defeat him. The way he combined the natural\n&gt;terrain, the obstacles, and the fires is exactly like\n&gt;they teach us as military officers. Unfortunately,\n&gt;Takeda Katsuyori didn&#39;t listen to his officers, like\n&gt;modern S-2&#39;s, who would have told him no way they\n&gt;should go in there.
