As long as a topic is \neven vaguely or marginally related to Japanese history or culture or \nJapan or Japanese, it is free to go (and I think that gives a lot of \nleeway in discussion, and I&#39;m not against history-related posts that \nare more or less off-topic).  Allowing a free-reign of completely off-\ntopic posts opens a can of worms I&#39;d prefer to avoid.\n\nThanks\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, tom helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Nate et al-\n&gt; \tMy point was that it is a little hypocritical to say it is ok \n&gt; to chat about mopeds because they are Japanese, but not politics \n&gt; because they are European. After all the discussion of European \n&gt; history and politics started from a posting about things Japanese \nand \n&gt; may well have returned to that subject in time.\n&gt; \tThis list has been quiet for so long I thought it was dead. \n&gt; Once people are talking we ought to be able to draw the \nconversation \n&gt; into areas more on topic. The Swiss are the Pope&#39;s samurai don&#39;t \nyou \n&gt; know...\n&gt; -t\n\n\n"
