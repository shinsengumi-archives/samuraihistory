But if\n\nyou do a search for &#39;National Diet Library Japan&#39; you are sure to get some\n\nhits. Whether you can get material from them is another matter. I did an\n\ninterlibrary search for a book at my branch library and they found it at the\n\nNational Diet Library. They sent it to my branch but I couldn&#39;t take it out\n\nor make copies. So I spent a whole afternoon reading with screaming kids\n\nrunning around.\n\n\n &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
