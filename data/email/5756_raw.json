This is an email\n&gt; list meant to perpetuate a flow of information\n&gt; and KNOWLEDGE! If what you think you\n&gt; know is WRONG, someone will tell you.\n\nWell, you could have fooled me!!  Those with long memories will know exactly\nto what I&#39;m referring!!  I like a list with a bit of spice and armour plated\negos coupled with hard-won expert knowledge and I have a VERY thick skin -\nBUT - I have on more than one occasion received list replies to my pitiful\nofferings from at least two individuals that could have been interpreted as\nsarcasm or put-downs.  I have chosen to interpret these as blunt humour or\nsardonic humour or... (email not being an easy medium in which to express\nsuch concepts).  I have also perceived it dealt out to others with\nconsequent apologies for being misunderstood when the recipients squawked\n&quot;ABUSE...&quot;\n\nI smiled at the armour-piercing humour of &quot;Tenshi, Rose, and Toni\n&lt;madmadotakuchick@...&gt;&quot; coupled with a velvet glove challenge whacked\nacross the cheek because I&#39;m quite used to it.\n\nOK (1) - now rip the stuffing out of this reply if you are so inclined...\n\nOK (2) - now to be useful.  There was a Daimyo in the Edo period who, having\njust inherited his fief, did indeed shortly thereafter fall in love with a\ngeisha.  It must be true because I read it somewhere in the last 40 years of\nmy lust in reading about swords and the samurai.  This man was besotted with\nthe lass and squandered his family&#39;s fortune to the extent that he was\ndis-inherited by the Shogunate.  This story may have been in Mitford&#39;s\n&quot;Tales of the Samurai&quot;, Lafcadio Hearn&#39;s 2-volume set that I have, in a\nsimilar such book of tales, or in one of the many Sword Society journals I\nhave gathered over the years.\n\nSo, I can verify &quot;Tenshi, Rose, and Toni &lt;madmadotakuchick@...&gt;&#39;s&quot;\nobservation that the story has credibility in my reading.  As for a name of\nthe samurai, it was in the story but I cannot remember it.  If anyone is\nserious about the name I&#39;ll have an archeaological dig into my voluminous\nlibrary...\n\nCan I close by thanking those who devote so much time to the great success\nof the list and to enlighten many of us lesser mortals with their\nencyclopaedic knowledge of the Samurai.  I dips my lid to &#39;ee.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
