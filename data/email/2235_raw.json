However, I would recommend a recently published book to give you an overall feel and vision of the times: &quot;Samurai, an illustrated history&quot; by Mitsuo Kure, 2001; published by  Tuttle - plenty of full coloured photos of re-enactors, banners and battle plans.  And I suppose reading a few novels of the time would provide some faction base - Clavell&#39;s &quot;SHOGUN&quot; must be regarded as essential..\n\nGood luck with the writing....\n                                                    Rod Johnson\n\nAs an aside I used to enjoy the old western movies - I knew they were mostly factually incorrect - but it was entertainment!! So it is not unexpected that I look forward to &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; [and I will probably buy the video (or DVD) when it comes out]. I didn&#39;t look for wrist watches, telegraph poles and jet trails in the sky on &quot;Waterloo&quot;, so I enjoyed it....  Treat &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; as entertainment, we couldn&#39;t look to Shakespear for history lessons! And it may even give another generation interest in &quot;our&quot; subject as the novel SHOGUN did........\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
