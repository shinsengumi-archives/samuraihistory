Thanks!\nI&#39;m in the midst of researching, and would like to get my facts right:\nFrom what I understand, the nagamaki blade may be as long and as shaped as a katana&#39;s. the instances I have found in books and on the web describe the nagamaki pole shorter than the naginata&#39;s, and sometimes equals the length of the nagamaki blade on the other end. \nIs this true, or was there an instance of a katana blade on a naginata pole?\n\nThanks!\n\nRami\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
