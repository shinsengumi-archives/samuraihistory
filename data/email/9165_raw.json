There are\n&gt; occasional acts of this type recorded even into the Sengoku, but by\n&gt; then it was probably so rare as to be a novelty. Yamanaka Shikanosuke\n&gt; was challenged by Shinagawa Daisen during a seige of Gassan-toda\n&gt; castle, and were allowed to fight it out in front of the two armies.\n&gt; This was a little different, as they didn&#39;t march out and declare\n&gt; names, I think the challenge to Shikanosuke was specific. But similar\n&gt; concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
