Momochi Sandayu regarded as\nonther of the most famous Ninja has left us with\nplenty of evidence of his existance. In fact one of\nthis houses was until at least the late 70&#39;s still\ninhabited by his descendants. It was also earlier in\nthe 20th century that a family member sold the\nfamilies collection of documents.\n\nWith regards to Ninja documentation there are three\nvery famous books. \n\nSHONIKI- Correct Ninjutsu memories\n\nIn 1681, a book entitled Shoniki, was written by\nFujibayashi Masatake (also known as Notari Sanjuro\nFujibayashi). He was also a Samurai from Kishu. It is\nalso possible that these two authors Fujibayashi\nMasatake, and Fujibayashi Nagato (Bansenshukai) may\nhave been related.  It contains the secret teachings\nof the Kishu Ryu.\n\nBANSENSHUKAI - 10,000 rivers gather in the sea\n\nThe Bansenshukai (10,000 rivers gather in the sea) \nwas written in 1676 by Fujibayashi Yasutake a Samurai\nfrom Iga Ueno castle. As the name is the same, as the\nfamous Fujibayashi Iga Ninja family, and it is one of\nthe most intensive books on the secret teachings and\ntools written solely on the 49 Iga Ninja Ryu. It is\npossible that the author was a relative of the\nFujibayashi Ninja family, if not one himself. But as\nwith all history this is only speculation.\n\nNINPIDEN - Secret teachings of Ninjutsu\nIn 1653 Ninpiden was written by Hattori Hanzo\nYasukiyo. It is believed to contain the teachings of\nHattori Hanzo, the Ninja chief of Shogun Tokugawa\nIeyasu.\n\nyou can view and download the complete Bansenshukai\nhere http://www.robertk.com/Bansenshukai/\n\nAnd at\nhttp://www.ninpo.org/historicalrecords/historicalrecords.html\nthere are selected translations from the above three\nbooks as well as Taiheiki, Kojiki and Azumakagami\n\nPaul\n\n\n"
