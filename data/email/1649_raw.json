Secondly there was the shitagi, which was\nessentially a kimono, seccured by a belt called an obi\n(that&#39;s the name most martial arts schools use for\ntheir belts these days).  Since hakama, divided or\nnot, we usually so thick and bulky, next would usually\ncome the kobakama shorts, followed by tabbi socks and\nfinally the leggings known as kyahan.\n\nAfter this began the process of donning the bushi&#39;s\narmor, unless you first count the footware of either\nfur boots of the higher ups, or waraji sandles for the\nlower ranks (commonly mistaken for the regular zori\nsandles of civilians).\n\nOf course, some of these elements changed depending on\nthe time period or rank of the person.  A higher\nofficer might actually wear full hakama instead of\nkobakama, and a very low ranking bushi might wear an\neven shorter pair of trousers (think hot pants) called\nmatabiki.  The yoroi hitatare you mentioned was\ncommonly worn by higher officers over their fundoshi\ninstead of the more simple looking shitagi.\n\nCRAZ\n\n\n--- Paul Richardson &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; I was wondering if some one (espec Anthony) and tell\n&gt; me the names of \n&gt; the most common items of clothing worn under Yoroi.\n&gt; \n&gt; was it a kimono top with hakama, or a special style\n&gt; of hakama, \n&gt; Hitatare or something else.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks in advance\n&gt; \n&gt; paul\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
