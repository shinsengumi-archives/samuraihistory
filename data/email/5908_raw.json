I really appreciate you guys taking some time out and explaining all of this stuff to me. I might sound stupid, but, i never even thought of going to a museum to see armor. That&#39;s a great idea!!! Again, thanks a lot for all of the advice. I&#39;ll post some pics up as i go along. Hope to hear some good replies about it. Thank you.\n                                                            Greatfully yours,\n                                                              Mark\n \nP.S.- do you guys ever go to any of the SCA events? I live in Buffalo N.Y. so if you go to any in Rochester N.Y. or most other cities in N.Y.,i might see ya there.\n \n                         Later Guys!!!!!\n\nDean Wayland &lt;dean@...&gt; wrote:\nHi Mark,\n\nOkay, to really answer your questions I&#39;d have to write a book, and a\npretty big one at that, and there is no way that I&#39;m adequately\nqualified to even think about it, never mind the fact that as I said\ntime is short, and your right that &quot;sucks&quot;.\n\n&gt;    Thank you very much for replying. Sucks you don&#39;t have time. I have \n&gt;    my first child coming in 1-2 weeks so i&#39;ll probably understand what \n&gt;    you mean.\n\nOh yeah, you definitely will....\n\n&gt; Oh well, i thought i&#39;d ask anyways. (you sure,...???? \n\nh yeah, I&#39;m sure...\n\n&gt;    $$$$$$) Let&#39;s keep it at that for now, but if you change your mind \n&gt;    u have my e-mail.\n\nI have...\n\n&gt; Back to that first e-mail u sent me about \n&gt;    stitching the armor to the fabrics...,...a couple more ?&#39;s then \n&gt;    i&#39;ll stop bothering u for advice.\n\nSo folks, I&#39;m a sucker...\n\n&gt;    1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe?\n\nNO, just 3...\n\n&gt; Outer \n&gt;    Layer(that&#39;s what you see on the outsite),\n\nYep...\n\n&gt; a layer of Cloth \n&gt;    Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can a get that?what size?,\n\nYep, and don&#39;t worry about trying to get hemp, its expensive, use\n&quot;linen&quot;,  which is made from the &quot;flax&quot; plant, or just a corse weave\ncotton, almost like a sort of fine heavy sack cloth. Go chat with a\ncloth merchant...\n\n&gt; a \n&gt;    layer of Very Very Very Thin Leather(goes under hemp layer),\n\nEr... no, the thin leather is the edge trim not a layer...\n\n&gt; and \n&gt;    then the Inner Shell\n\nYep..\n\n\n&gt;(goes under v v v thin leather)?\n\nno, see above..\n\n&gt;is this layer \n&gt;    leather?\n\nno, this inner shell should be a soft linen, cotton or rarely silk, it\nhas to be comfortable as it goes directly against your bear skin...\n\n&gt; do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it and then mold \n&gt;    it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the whole way down the entire \n&gt;    KOTE and stay flexable?\n\nas I said no leather layer, it goes on the edge only, and if you boil\nleather, you get soup..\n\n&gt;    2. I understand stitching the mail down but about the plates.. How \n&gt;    do sew them down. \n\nAll the plates on kote etc, have holes around their edges through which\neither the links of the mail pass, or where there is no mail, you use\nthread to sew it down...\n\n&gt;You talked about a &quot;running stitch&quot;???what&#39;s \n&gt;    that? i&#39;m not a sewer.\n\nWell there&#39;s another skill you&#39;ll need to learn to become a &quot;Japanese&quot;\narmourer, ask someone you know who sews, or visit your local library and\nget a book on sewing for beginners...\n\n&gt; Do a sew through the metal? Do i predrill \n&gt;    little holes??\n\nYes, as I described above...\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand that part. \n\nGood point, this is why I agree with Paul, go get your hands on the\n&quot;real&quot; thing, it will all become clear, especially if you can find\nsomeone who&#39;ll talk you through it while you have the armour in your\nhands...\n\n&gt;    3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle of a solid \n&gt;    panal of mail? \n\nWhen I say &quot;solid&quot; I meant, composed of just mail, no plates, no big\ngaps. The word &quot;Mail&quot; comes from Latin via medieval French, and it can\nbe translated as &quot;net&quot; or &quot;mesh&quot;, its full of holes and you simply take\nyour thread and loop it round a bit of the mail &quot;tying&quot; it to the cloth.\nIt&#39;ll become obvious when you see a real kote up close.\n\n\n&gt;    4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions on how to lace \n&gt;    lames together????? I just can&#39;t seem to get it right. My armor is \n&gt;    all flimsy and isn&#39;t very rigid. My Lames are about 1.5&quot; wide x \n&gt;    2.5&quot; high 10gauge stainless steal.(free from work) I need to learn \n&gt;    some better methods on lacing them together. I don&#39;t think i have \n&gt;    enough hole punch in each lame? Website&#39;s don&#39;t really go into \n&gt;    detail on putting more than 2 lames together.(that sucks) Anyway, \n&gt;    if you have a good technique on lacing Lame armor, please let me \n&gt;    know.\n\nAgain, I feel a major work coming on, sorry, go look at the real thing.\nAlso try getting hold of a book entitled:\n\n&quot;The Manufacture of Helmets and Armour in 16th Century Japan&quot; by\nSekikabara Kozan translated by H.R.Robinson, and look at the diagrams in\nthe back...\n\nAnd finally, re your other email, as to tools, again I suggest find\nyourself a friendly local armourer and get their advice. Tony&#39;s website,\nwhich Paul has given you will help you if you can&#39;t find someone to talk\nto.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m off to do all the other things that I&#39;m supposed to be\ndoing, good luck with your project.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
