That helps a lot.  You are right on them \nnot wan=\r\nting to give an answer because they would not be sure and it \nwould ruin th=\r\neir reputation.  I did not know that it could be Seal \nScript.  I will rese=\r\narch that further.  Also what does &quot;Moriamur, et \nin media arma ruamus&quot; Ver=\r\ngil, mean? \n\nTravis\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junk=\r\nmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Travis -\n&gt; \tTwo problems here; One is the handwriting =\r\nis pretty poor on \nthe  \n&gt; &quot;name plate&quot; and the other is it looks like Seal=\r\n Script is being \nused  \n&gt; for the lacquered name. The &quot;name plate&quot; says so=\r\nmething TA HISA- \nand  \n&gt; the next kanji could be read kazu, shige, tada, m=\r\nitsu, or tomi. \nThe  \n&gt; first something is illegible and the fourth charact=\r\ner can be read  \n&gt; many different ways, so this is likely a name but I can =\r\nsee how  \n&gt; people would be unable or unwilling to posit a definitive readi=\r\nng.\n&gt; \tAs for the seal script the second character looks to be \nHatake (=E7=\r\n=95=A0) \n&gt; =E3=80=80not sure what the first is. I don&#39;t have a good referen=\r\nce for \nthis  \n&gt; kind of script. Would love to have recommendations if anyb=\r\nody on \nthis  \n&gt; list knows of a good book for translating seal script BTW.=\r\n Even \nwith  \n&gt; the references available, since this is very stylized there=\r\n may \nnot  \n&gt; be a one to one translation that is clearly what the original=\r\n \nwriter  \n&gt; had in mind. Adding to the problem is the fact that the Japane=\r\nse \nlove  \n&gt; wordplay, if they are able to identify the characters they may=\r\n be  \n&gt; nonsense to us but to a person of the Edo period would be an  \n&gt; in=\r\nstantly recognizable name or punchline.\n&gt; \tI am just dumb enough to specula=\r\nte on this while I suspect \nthe  \n&gt; authorities you have spoken to are too =\r\nsmart to offer any kind of  \n&gt; answer unless they are absolutely sure and t=\r\nhat is most likely why  \n&gt; they didn&#39;t give you a name.\n&gt; Tom Helm\n&gt; toryu@=\r\n...\n&gt; &quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;\n&gt; - Vergil\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 10, =\r\n2008, at 2:18 AM, Travis Good wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have an old yumi and I need h=\r\nelp in translating its name.
