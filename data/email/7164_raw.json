We all seem to be getting a little off topic with the whole ninja topic. From my perspective (24yro) I find that the ninja have somewhat been given a superhero mythical status. Im a firm believer in classical arts and that the modern day version of a ninja is nothing more than a perversion of history, On one of the forums in which I moderate there a forum ninjas ( moderators) this kinda shows how to be a ninja is uber cool!! ( and trust me these guys have never even heard the word Iga ,let alone looked at ninja history)  I also believe that modern day ninja are a 20th century interpretation of what we would want them to be, almost comic book in fact. I not sure if the western worlds interpretation of ninja is directly responsable for the ninja fad,or that the ninjas own secerecy and art of deception is responsible for leaving blanks in which peoples &#39;poetic licence&#39; run amuck.  \n\nROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:I apologize Nate. I&#39;v been out of town awhile and haven&#39;t checked my email recently. Now that you mention its a parody I still wonder why anyone would waste their time on creating a site that pokes fun at the perspective most Americans have of ninja. I mean will it change the attitude? Somebody&#39;s wasting their time I think. And definitely sarcasm is not something you spare Nate. \nLater.\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!!!

Ha, ha, ha!!!!\n&gt; Somebody put the author out of his misery, please!\n\nAnd once again we have to explain that it`s a PARODY\nsite...\n\nSarcasm, Irony....a lost art, it seems. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
