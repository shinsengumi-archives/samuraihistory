My dates could be off since I don&#39;t have the information\nright in front of me. Further, I could very well be mistaken ... but I seem\nto recall something of that nature during my studies on the Takeda lineage\nwhich ranges back through the Minamoto to Fujiwara Seiwa.\nThis piece of information is pure speculation. I cannot verify it. Please\nkeep that in mind. It&#39;s just something I remember reading.\n\nAlex\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: The Dragon of Eternal Rain &lt;Shourinou@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;; &lt;fifthchamber@...&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, May 16, 2001 7:14 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Question of credentials...\n\n\n&gt;      You bring up some valid points. It is a\n&gt; well-established fact that Hideyoshi could never be\n&gt; shogun. You brought up about his own lineage & I can\n&gt; confirm that not only HE but Ieyasu were not of\n&gt; Minamoto blood. Tokugawa basically threatened the life\n&gt; of the emperor into altering his lineage. Since the\n&gt; shogun was considered to be the source of all &#39;true&#39;\n&gt; power during the era, the emperor had no choice but to\n&gt; make Tokugawa a &#39;Minamoto.&#39;\n&gt;      I find it interesting that centuries after the\n&gt; great Minamoto-Taira wars that people wished to use\n&gt; these names, not only to exploit them for personal\n&gt; gain, but, also for sovereign protection. Meanwhile,\n&gt; they clearly held no reverence for the honor which\n&gt; their names derive from a mere mention. Yet, it eludes\n&gt; me that Oda Nobunaga, of Taira descent did not so\n&gt; clearly connect himself with his heritage in both name\n&gt; and nostalgia. It is no wonder then that he is the\n&gt; most famous of all Japanese, for the simple fact that\n&gt; he is both an enigma and a wonder to us all...\n&gt;\n&gt; =====\n&gt; &quot;I am Mikhal no Shourinou, son of Toshiro of the village of Rin, and loyal\nretainer of the Maeda clan.
