And why so slight =\r\ncurvature in a \n17th\n&gt; &gt; century blade ?\n&gt; &gt; It resemble to me no &#39;&#39;black c=\r\nolor&#39;&#39; rust in the tang but it may \nbe \n&gt; due\n&gt; &gt; to the flash light surely=\r\n used to take the photos. The handle is \n&gt; rather\n&gt; &gt; long, suggesting a po=\r\nssible ancestral blade, but... also the \n&gt; signature\n&gt; &gt; seems to me too mu=\r\nch well preserved for having 300 years, as the \n&gt; sharp\n&gt; &gt; angles of the t=\r\nang and mekugi-ana. Sharpness may be explained \nwith a\n&gt; &gt; borders re-shapi=\r\nng (saving the signature) to fit with the kyugunto\n&gt; &gt; mounting but I am st=\r\nill not able to see filemarks, whether the \n&gt; kanji are\n&gt; &gt; rather good vis=\r\nible. Without jihada, boshi and a closer image of \nat\n&gt; &gt; least little part=\r\n of the hamon is hard to determine the school. \nIf \n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; patterns do =\r\nnot match with the signature ?\n&gt; &gt; May be a new swordsmith signature of lat=\r\ner time? Because \n&gt; effectively, if\n&gt; &gt; old, is hard to think of a fake wit=\r\nh such a signature, but \nnowadays \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; fakers make the same reasonin=\r\ng.\n&gt; &gt; Honestly, signature is the last thing I see to, while here we \nhave =\r\n\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; work with it as the first step. And to be sincere, I was not able=\r\n \nto\n&gt; &gt; read it as good as you have made. I have thinked about the little =\r\n\n&gt; label\n&gt; &gt; :\n&gt; &gt; surrenders swords had such a lebel to make it easy to gi=\r\nve back\n&gt; &gt; (eventually...) the blade to the formerly owner, and this may \n=\r\n&gt; suggest\n&gt; &gt; the blade was of a certain interest.\n&gt; &gt; But this is not a ru=\r\nle in kantei (fakes of surrenders blade with\n&gt; &gt; &#39;&#39;dedications&#39;&#39; have a the=\r\nir own market...). If Scott would see \nat \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; back of the handle and=\r\n other details comparing it to the \ndescription\n&gt; &gt; shown in the part of th=\r\ne article I have posted, may be we can \nargue \n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; the mounting was in=\r\ntended for a High officer, enforcing \n&gt; the &#39;&#39;ancestral\n&gt; &gt; blade&#39;&#39; theory.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; By the way, Gen. Yamashita&#39;s sword was of the same period... \n&gt; &gt; Plea=\r\nse have no trouble to refute my suggestions as I&#39;m taking \nthis \n&gt; as a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n learning session, with a lot of fun.   \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your time.\n&gt; &gt; Carl=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Messaggio originale-----\n&gt; &gt; Da: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@=\r\nt...] \n&gt; &gt; Inviato: mercoled=EC 7 maggio 2003 9.06\n&gt; &gt; A: samuraihistory@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Oggetto: Re: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Carlo-\n&gt; &gt; \tScott has the translation so he can easily straighten us ou=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; and the mountings are clearly wartime production.

The Nihonto Meikan lists \n&gt; five=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Katsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one who signed in this \n&gt; manne=\r\nr. \n&gt; &gt; The shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sengo Masashige. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Masashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa.
