Has \nanyone read the Shike books?  They are by Robert Shea and cover a \nperiod before and during the Mongol invasions.  I think he mixed up \nmany of the historical events in his books but it was well written.  \nThere are 2 books and they are both enjoyable but hard to find.  No \nlonger in print but you may be able to find a used copy.\n\nNate, I picked up Taiko today.  It was the last hardcover copy they \nhad.  We&#39;ll see if I can finish it before the end of the year ;p\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt; Hey.\n&gt;        If you&#39;re talking about novels, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re pretty \naccurate \n&gt; but I really don&#39;t know, but I&#39;d recommend Laura Joh Rowland&#39;s Sano \nIchiro \n&gt; mysteries.  I&#39;ve read the first five of them (Shinju, Bundori, The \nWay of the \n&gt; Traitor, The Concubine&#39;s Tattoo and The Samurai&#39;s Wife) and they&#39;re \nall great \n&gt; books from a story perspective.  (Someone like Tony could verify \ntheir historicity \n&gt; better than I.)\n&gt;        They&#39;re set during the reign of shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi \n(Shinju set \n&gt; in approximately 1689 through to 1691 as of Samurai&#39;s Wife).  About \nthe \n&gt; biggest deviation from history -- and the biggest delight from a \nfiction standpoint \n&gt; -- is Sano&#39;s wife, Reiko, who is very much an ATYPICAL Japanese \nwife for the \n&gt; time period, although their marriage is the traditional arranged \none and \n&gt; doesn&#39;t come until early in The Concubine&#39;s Tattoo.  The rest of \nthe series is \n&gt; Black Lotus, The Pillow Book of Lady Wisteria, The Dragon King&#39;s \nPalace and, \n&gt; coming out I believe in March, is the so-far-titled ninth book, The \nPerfumed \n&gt; Sleeve.  And yes, I plan to read them.  Rowland is of Japanese (I \nbelieve) and \n&gt; Korean descent.\n&gt;        Hope this helps!!!!!  8-D\n&gt; \n&gt; L8r\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
