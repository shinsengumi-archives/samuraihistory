I&#39;m begging. Learn to use all your keys, so\nyou can type &quot;you&quot; and &quot;are&quot; and not just &quot;u&quot; and &quot;r&quot;.\n\n\nNo, it&#39;s not because of the sailors. It&#39;s because of\nthe reek of stale alcohol. It&#39;s because of the african\nstrip clubs touts who won&#39;t let you go more than 5\nfeet without trying to drag you into some seedy\nestablishment where they will take all your money in\nreturn for a sub-par strip show that lasts 30 secs\n(from what I hear, anyway--never taken them up. I like\nbeing married, and would like to stay that way). It&#39;s\nbecause of the chinese massage parlor girls that line\nthe street asking if you want &quot;massaji?&quot;. God, the\nlook on their faces is priceless when you tell them\n&quot;Bu hao, wo bu xiang ni&quot; :)\n\nWhy would sailors bother me? I&#39;m in the Army. I&#39;m not\na teacher. And might I suggest, if you&#39;re on your way\nto being a teacher, you start practicing punctuation,\ncapitalization, and spelling. The students are\nsupposed to learn from you, not the other way around. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo! Mail - Easier than ever with enhanced search.
