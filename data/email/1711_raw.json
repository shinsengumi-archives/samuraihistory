I have more photographs, but I didn&#39;t want to overdo. If there is a specific something that somone wants to see, I will try to accomodate.\n\n  By the way, I have been focusing on the history of the blade and don&#39;t think I mentioned that the sword is in a steel scabbard that is covered in leather. It was obviously used and the leather is well worn but in remarkably good shape, This is in the 4th picture in the album.\n\n  Again, thanks for the interest and the help.\n\n  Scott\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Kitsuno \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, May 04, 2003 11:34 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: History of a Sword\n\n\n  I just changed it so members should be able to post photos here:\n\n  http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/lst\n\n\n  --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Scott Moore&quot; &lt;sgmoore@e...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt; Tom,\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   This is another case where I feel like a dummy.
