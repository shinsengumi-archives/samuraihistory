I think Tony&#39;s comment was about\nyour statement that shinobi lurked in the shadows,\nfinding enemy shinobi and pointing them out to guards.\nThat&#39;s just simply not true. As Tony said, for the\nmost part the black outfits are a convention of\nfictional theater. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
