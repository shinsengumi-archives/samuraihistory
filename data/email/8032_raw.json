Though\n&gt; the openeing scenes \n&gt; have an encampmnet surrounded by beautiful jinmaku\n&gt; (camp curtains), \n&gt; there was never a tent shown.  According to Mr\n&gt; Bryant, they  usually \n&gt; took over some neighboring Temple or hous to sleep\n&gt; in. \n&gt; \n&gt;   I would think that they would also have tents of\n&gt; some sort. \n\nIf they took over a temple, why would they need a\ntent? If you&#39;re recreating a footsoldier, then likely\nthey had tents--anybody important would have\ncommandeered a temple or someone else&#39;s house, just\nlike Tony says. \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
