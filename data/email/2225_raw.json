Thanks anyway, I&#39;ll check out those \nsources you mention.\n\nSam\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, tom helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sam-\n&gt; \tIt would be easy to give you all the answers, but I suspect \n&gt; many like myself feel that whatever it is you are writing will \nsuffer \n&gt; from your lack of research. Best to study your history, try Sansom \n&gt; and I think even Turbull would have the answer to most of your \n&gt; questions.
