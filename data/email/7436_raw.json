I have looked at the Toraba page and it is excellent. Thank you again. Tony,...if your reading this,....can you please respond to my second ?. It&#39;s been a stopper in my project & will really help me out a lot.  \n                                  Thanks again,\n                                     Mark \n\nDean Wayland &lt;dean@...&gt; wrote:\nHi Mark,\n\n&gt;1.) Mimi ito(edge lacing) - does it have to be a different color than the rest \n&gt;of the primary lacing to be considered authentic? or can it be the same color?\n\nYes it can be the same colour. But if you want your kit to look truly\nspectacular, a MIMI-ITO in a multicolour &quot;woodpecker&quot; braid really\nhelps. You can get it from:\n\nhttp://www.toraba.com\n\nGo to his &quot;Lacing&quot; section on his &quot;Restoration&quot; pages.\n\n&gt;2.)\n\nI&#39;ll leave this question to Tony, as I&#39;m out of my depth with early\narmour construction.\n\n&gt;3.) I&#39;ve heard that Kohire are only found on Tosei Gusoku.\n\nAlthough they appear on earlier style armours such as DOU-MARU, I think\nmost are 1500&#39;s onwards, but I could be wrong, Tony? They certainly\nappear much earlier than the similarly constructed TATE-ERI (armoured\ncollar) which turn up in the late 16th century and become increasing\npopular during the EDO era.\n\n&gt; Would it be correct \n&gt;if I put Kohire on a Dangae Do? \n\nAs this &quot;style&quot; is created using TOSEI-GUSOKU armour construction\nstyles, it shouldn&#39;t be a problem authenticity wise.\n\n&gt;How are the winglets attached to the watagami?\n\nThey are sewn to it, through pairs of holes along the edge of the plate.\nA minimum of 3 sets is necessary, 5 is common. The holes in a pair are\nabout 4-6mm apart, measured centre to centre and no more than about 1mm\nin diameter. They are mounted on the underside of the plate on top of\nthe lining. Sometimes they are built in to the lining along with the\nTATE-ERI, and then sewn in the same way to the DOU.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \nSamurai Japan Japan airline \n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
