I have taken my yumi to about six \nspecialist (=\r\nArchaeologists and Kyudo masters) and most of them did \nnot want anything t=\r\no do with the yumi because they said that it was \nevil and they felt that i=\r\nt was posessed and controling.  Wether or \nnot that is true I do not know, =\r\nbut a least three different people \nsaid so.  Please extend many, many than=\r\nks to your friend and I know \nthat researching takes time and I will wait p=\r\naitently for an answer.  \nAgain I thank you and your friend.I will look at =\r\nthe Hawley&#39;s chart \nand see what I can find.\n\nTravis.\n\n--- In samuraihistor=\r\ny@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Travis et al,\n&gt;=\r\n I think also you need an archery specialist.  Just as for swords \nthat req=\r\nuire a specialist knowledge of readings I&#39;m sure the same is \ntrue for bows=\r\n and that whole specialised area of kyudo.  I have a \nmate who is &quot;into&quot; th=\r\nis kind of object and I&#39;ll run it past him.  \nI&#39;ve made a note of your post=\r\n, the replies and saved your images and \nwhile I won&#39;t forget it is likely =\r\nto take a while to find the \nright &quot;Round Tuit&quot;!!!  Like Tom, I immediately=\r\n thought of seal \ncharacters and I do have Hawley&#39;s chart on this script - =\r\nsomewhere - \nbut as Tom says the real meaning is more likely locked in the =\r\ntime \nand place of the culture that made the bow, rather than in a literal =\r\n\ntranslation of the characters.\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----=\r\n- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Tom Helm \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoog=\r\nroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, October 12, 2008 4:58 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [sam=\r\nuraihistory] Yumi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Travis -\n&gt;   Two problems here; One is the hand=\r\nwriting is pretty poor on the \n&gt;   &quot;name plate&quot; and the other is it looks l=\r\nike Seal Script is being \nused \n&gt;   for the lacquered name. The &quot;name plate=\r\n&quot; says something TA HISA- \nand \n&gt;   the next kanji could be read kazu, shig=\r\ne, tada, mitsu, or tomi. \nThe \n&gt;   first something is illegible and the fou=\r\nrth character can be read \n&gt;   many different ways, so this is likely a nam=\r\ne but I can see how \n&gt;   people would be unable or unwilling to posit a def=\r\ninitive reading.\n&gt;   As for the seal script the second character looks to b=\r\ne Hatake \n(=E7=95=A0) \n&gt;   =E3=80=80not sure what the first is. I don&#39;t hav=\r\ne a good reference for \nthis \n&gt;   kind of script. Would love to have recomm=\r\nendations if anybody on \nthis \n&gt;   list knows of a good book for translatin=\r\ng seal script BTW. Even \nwith \n&gt;   the references available, since this is =\r\nvery stylized there may \nnot \n&gt;   be a one to one translation that is clear=\r\nly what the original \nwriter \n&gt;   had in mind. Adding to the problem is the=\r\n fact that the Japanese \nlove \n&gt;   wordplay, if they are able to identify t=\r\nhe characters they may be \n&gt;   nonsense to us but to a person of the Edo pe=\r\nriod would be an \n&gt;   instantly recognizable name or punchline.\n&gt;   I am ju=\r\nst dumb enough to speculate on this while I suspect the \n&gt;   authorities yo=\r\nu have spoken to are too smart to offer any kind of \n&gt;   answer unless they=\r\n are absolutely sure and that is most likely \nwhy \n&gt;   they didn&#39;t give you=\r\n a name.\n&gt;   Tom Helm\n&gt;   toryu@...\n&gt;   &quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;   - Vergil\n&gt; \n&gt;   On Oct 10, 2008, at 2:18 AM, Travis Good wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n &gt; I have an old yumi and I need help in translating its name.
