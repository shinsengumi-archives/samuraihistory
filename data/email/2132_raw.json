Not only that they would assume the \nentire identity with false papers and other items that would be \nneeded to get through checkpoints, and other such things, when there \nwas time to make them.  When a ninja would wear something similar to \nwhat we now consider a ninja uniform it was almost never black.  The \npoint was to conceal oneself so moving through the forrest in the \ndaytime in a back outfit doesn&#39;t make sence.  Even at night time they \nwould rarely wear black.  Unless it was a night of a new moon or the \nclouds completely coverefd the moon jet balck clothes would stand out \nif there was a little bit of light from the moon.  So usually for \nnight missons when the &quot;ninja uniform&quot; was worn it work be a dark \ngray, dark blue, a darn brown, or other dark colors.  One more thing \nbut not about garb.  There is a good article at www.koryu.com written \nby Dr. Karl Friday called &quot;Is Ninjutsu a Koryu&quot;.  Dr. Friday holds a \nMenkyo Kaiden in Kashima Shinto Ryu (one of the oldest samurai styles \nstill around), and a PhD in History.  \n\n\n"
