I saw the museum on the show and some of the \nartifacts they had on display made me a little skeptical.  Something about a \npink ninja cutie kinda kills the credibility\n  One of these days I will manage to make my way over to Japan and see the \nsites.  Probably after I finish grad school.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar ï¿½ get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
