I re=\r\ncall helping out (with answers) Tom Cruise and some folks \nconnected with t=\r\nhe film a few years before it was released to \ntheatres. \n\nAt least I thoug=\r\nht they&#39;d get it to at least resemble Japan after our \nCivil War. The film =\r\nwas set in 1876-1877. This was the same time as \nRurouni Kenshin/Samurai X =\r\nwas laid. The animes were more historically \ncorrect than the film was. \n\nS=\r\nome examples--\n\n(SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN TLS FILM)\n\n\nSeveral=\r\n Samurai wearing only one katana\n\nA fallen Samurai committing seppukuu with=\r\n a tante (dagger or knife) \nrather than using his katana blade\n\nA reference=\r\n to a field artillery cannon as a &#39;howitzer&#39; years before \nthe howitzer was=\r\n invented.\n\nSamurai participating in covert (spying) operations. Samurai de=\r\ntested \nspying and any other form of deceit. To this end they usually used =\r\n\nNinjas for this purpose.\n\nSamurai in 1876-1877 still wearing ceremonial ar=\r\nmour into battle and \nallowing an outsider (Cruise as a cavalry captain) to=\r\n wear the armour \nof the man he killed. I don&#39;t recall Kenshin Himura or ev=\r\nen Saitoh \nHajime wearing armour on RK or SX. \n\nThe battle was laughable. N=\r\no Samurai will wait for an enemy he is \nfacing to attack first. Especially =\r\nwhen he has the advantage of a \ncavalry charge against infantry. \n\nAll thin=\r\ngs considered I think that Richard Chamberlain (The Shogun) \ndid \na better =\r\njob as a Samurai than Tom Cruise. Even Chuck Norris would \nhave \nbeen a bet=\r\nter choice. \n\nKen Watanabe was robbed. He deserved the Best Supporting Acto=\r\nr Oscar \nthat year. I did hear he won some anime filming achievement awards=\r\n \nearlier this year though. \n\nWell more soon. Kami bless and toodles-K&K\n\n-=\r\n-- End forwarded message ---\n\n\n\n"
