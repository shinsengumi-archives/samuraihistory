Ostensibly,\n&gt; Ieyasu was supporting Oda Nobuo against Hideyoshi, but\n&gt; the contest was really between the two of them. Both\n&gt; sides fortified some castles in the Owari-Mino area,\n&gt; along the Tokaido. Neither side moved, and neither\n&gt; could gain a tactical advantage, until forces of\n&gt; Hideyoshi&#39;s led by Ikeda Shonyu attempted a flanking\n&gt; attack on the Tokugawa position. Ieyasu had\n&gt; anticipated the move, and a during a running battle\n&gt; called the Battle of Nagakute, Tokugawa forces\n&gt; defeated Hideyoshi&#39;s force. Each side learned about\n&gt; the other--Hideyoshi learned that any attempt to move\n&gt; against Ieyasu would be difficult at best, and he&#39;d\n&gt; lost a lot of time and men doing it. Ieyasu learned\n&gt; that he could hold off Hideyoshi for a long time, but\n&gt; if push came to shove he&#39;d eventually lose. So the\n&gt; campaign was essentially a draw. Tactical victory for\n&gt; Ieyasu, strategic victory for Hideyoshi.\n\nBingo. :)\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
