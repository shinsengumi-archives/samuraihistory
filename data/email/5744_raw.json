Pre=\r\nsent\nwere Thom Richardson (the then keeper of the oriental collection) who\n=\r\nwas running the show and Stephen Turnbull, who would have been\naccompanied =\r\nby Ian Bottomley his co-conspirator, but Ian was down with a\nvicious cold, =\r\nso Stephen had to read Ian&#39;s notes to the assembled\nmasses.\n\nBasically, the=\r\ny stated that new evidence for the existence of firearms\npre 1543, had been=\r\n recently (at that time) unearthed in Japan, which\nincluded an account of O=\r\nda Nobunaga attending some function or other\nwith a small company (50) of g=\r\nunners in his entourage.\n\nIt seems that the discovery of the gun in the far=\r\n east occurred at a\nsimilar time as it did in the west. The earliest record=\r\n of firearms here\nis 1274 in Italy (blanket IIRC reminder). The difference =\r\nbetween the two\nlay in the technology of later gun making.\n\nIn the east, no=\r\n satisfactory method for sealing the breach of an iron\nbarrel was ever foun=\r\nd, which meant they were restricted to cast bronze\nfor their guns. This mea=\r\nns in turn that if you want a hand portable\nweapon it couldn&#39;t be that powe=\r\nrful, for if it were, it would cease to\nbe &quot;portable&quot;. So there early hand =\r\nguns, were heavy bronze affairs with\nrelatively low power, hence the need f=\r\nor slower burning gun powder, as\nper the Chinese type. It seems that gunner=\r\ns were in service, but in very\nsmall numbers, with each man carrying only t=\r\nhree or four rounds of ammo.\nI guess it was deployed much like early guns w=\r\nere here, for intimidation\nas much for effect.\n\nWhat got the Japanese so ex=\r\ncited by European guns, wasn&#39;t the concept of\nthe gun itself, they had thes=\r\ne, it was that ours were &quot;light&quot; and\ncomparatively powerful. The reason for=\r\n this being that we could make a\nbarrel out of iron, which for a given weig=\r\nht, can take much higher\nchamber pressures. So you could use a more potent =\r\ngun powder mix, which\nin turn meant that a hand gun would make a far more u=\r\nseful military\nweapon.\n\nNow the first European iron guns were not plug seal=\r\ned, being fitted with\na removable breach held in place by wedges. I&#39;ve been=\r\n around when one of\nthings has been used, and believe me reliable it is not=\r\n! If you get it\nwrong, bang, followed by flying wedges and a zippy breach! =\r\nAt the very\nleast they seal like a sieve doesn&#39;t, gas vents all over the pl=\r\nace, thus\nthe muzzle loader won out over the early breach loader.\n\nThe Euro=\r\npean genius was the ability to permanently seal an iron tube,\nwhich we did =\r\nwith the creation of the iron &quot;screw&quot; in the 15th century.\nNow the screw ha=\r\ns been known for thousands of years, but all previous\nexamples were carved =\r\nfrom other softer materials like wood. The early\niron and later steel screw=\r\n had to be pains takingly built up around a\ncore with a &quot;V&quot; sectioned piece=\r\n of wire or bar. I know a guy who has\ndone it, and it isn&#39;t easy at all. Bu=\r\nt once you know how.... BOOM!\n\nConsequently, its the art of making the scre=\r\nw-in breach plug, that\nenables Japanese gun technology to go crazy, ramping=\r\n up gun production\nvastly within six months of its arrival, and the rest as=\r\n they say is\nhistory.\n\nAnyway, subject to the vagueries of memory, I hope t=\r\nhis was of interest,\nor at the very least entertaining.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\n\n=\r\nIn message &lt;4165F192.60206@...&gt;, James Eckman\n&lt;ronin_engineer@comca=\r\nst.net&gt; writes\n&gt;\n&gt;    &gt;\n&gt;    &gt;\n&gt;    &gt;=A0=A0 From: Dean Wayland &lt;dean@thefig=\r\nhtschool.demon.co.uk&gt;\n&gt;    &gt;\n&gt;    &gt;Okay, my own view is that the various id=\r\neas contained in bushido, \n&gt;    along\n&gt;    &gt;with the obsessive reverence fo=\r\nr the sword, over and above all \n&gt;    other\n&gt;    &gt;weapons, especially the g=\r\nun, was nothing more than a \n&gt;    socio-political\n&gt;    &gt;device created by t=\r\nhe Tokugawa intended to ensure peace. \n&gt;    &gt;\n&gt;    And not to rebel against=\r\n your master!\n&gt;\n&gt;    &gt;Well apart from the fact that we didn&#39;t introduce the=\r\nm to the gun \n&gt;    at all,\n&gt;    &gt;they had it long before we got there, all =\r\nwe did was show them how \n&gt;    to\n&gt;    &gt;make an iron screw thread (another =\r\nstory), \n&gt;    &gt;\n&gt;    While Turnbull and company aren&#39;t the most academic of=\r\n sources, \n&gt;    this \n&gt;    isn&#39;t the the way it&#39;s usually told. I&#39;d like to=\r\n hear more.\n&gt;\n&gt;    &gt;The whole sword thing, was blown out of all proportion,=\r\n again I \n&gt;    think to\n&gt;    &gt;aid the cause of peace, Tokugawa peace that i=\r\ns. &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;    &gt;=A0 \n&gt;    &gt;\n&gt;    Considering how effectively the Sengoku ar=\r\nmies became with the gun, \n&gt;    I \n&gt;    have no doubt that this was benefic=\r\nial to the powers that were. The \n&gt;    West \n&gt;    would have had real probl=\r\nems until the 1620s with Japan. They \n&gt;    missed the \n&gt;    light and fast =\r\nartillery boat.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Jim Eckman\n***\n(Dean Wayland)\n\nhttp://www.thefightsc=\r\nhool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
