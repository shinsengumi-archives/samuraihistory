Sigh.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is complete unmitigated fiction. And no, there\n&gt; are no more samurai; they \n&gt; ceased to exist with the stroke of a legislative pen\n&gt; (okay, a brush) in the 1870s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
