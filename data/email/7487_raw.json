I will have to get this book and learn \nmore,  tahnks for the post and information.  The good side of the battle is that \nit somewaht put and end to the civil wars winthin Janpan...  I am thinig that \nthe down side is that once in power;  Japan shut herself off almost eniterly \nfrom the outside world.  Leaving her behind the rest of the world and it&#39;s \nadvancements.  to some it may have been a good thing; but looking at Japan after \nthe fall of the towkagawa fealm;  Japan had alot of catching up to do...   ie \nafter the landing of  Perry.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
