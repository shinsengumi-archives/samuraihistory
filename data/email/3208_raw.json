It&#39;s not\n&gt;as &quot;original&quot;, in the Sengoku way, but it is an\n&gt;original POST Sengoku castle, and besides it&#39;s better\n&gt;than Nagoya-jo (How many Daimyo had ELEVATORS\n&gt;installed????)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAnd when I went, a giant disco ball as well!!! They were having some \nmodern dance contest then, but it&#39;s way too electrified to feel real. On \nthe other hand wandering the woodworkers shops of Nagoya was awesome. I \ndon&#39;t know what they really thought of the nerd with the suit on but I \nwas invited into several and it was fun.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Randall Edwards&quot; &lt;tcma66@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Japanese History\n&gt;\n&gt;I am relatively new to the group so this might be a stupid question but I \n&gt;was wondering if any of you could point me in the right direction of getting \n&gt;a degree in Japanese history.  \n&gt;\nFirst you have to buy a 100 pound sack of rice and consume it all. If \nyou can handle this part, you can major in Japanese history since after \ngraduating that will be all you can afford to eat ;) It&#39;s not a stupid \nquestion, but it is a silly answer.\n\nJim\n\n\n"
