I used to be very dismissive of these modern replicas, =\r\nbut a young friend of my daughter&#39;s boyfriend works for the Australian comp=\r\nany Global Gear.  At his invitation I have looked at some Hanwei swords and=\r\n I have to say I was very impressed.  The price/quality equation is superb.=\r\n  The sugata (shape) is very good and the togi (polish) is also amazingly g=\r\nood.  The hamon (&quot;temper line&quot;) appears to be real, i.e., water quenched.  =\r\nTo top it all off there is visible hada of a sort.  Even the koshirae (moun=\r\nting) is a quite reasonable looking facsimile of the real thing.  Now, a Ni=\r\nhont=F4 lover&#39;s collector sword it ain&#39;t, but for AUD$500 up it is the clos=\r\nest thing anyone is going to get to a real katana.  The CEO of Hanwei is Mr=\r\n CHEN CHAO-PO and I have seen a DVD produced by him about his company, swor=\r\nds and personal philosophy.  I was really surprised to discover that his so=\r\nn Ron has studied with the famous Japanese swordsmith Yoshindo Yoshihara in=\r\n Japan - http://www.samuraisword.com/nihontodisplay/other/yoshindo/index.ht=\r\nm for those not familiar with the world of Nihont=F4.  I am fortunate to ha=\r\nve a sword made by Yoshindo&#39;s grandfather Yoshihara Kuniie.  Whilst, as Gre=\r\ng notes, &quot;Hanwei swords were never intended to be collector swords&quot;, I woul=\r\nd nevertheless commend such a sword to a non-practitioner as a good &quot;substi=\r\ntute example&quot; for a real katana that would cost thousands of dollars for th=\r\ne equivalent real thing.\n\nBest regards,\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)=\r\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: INRSTRGTH@... \n  To: samurai=\r\nhistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 09, 2008 1:46 AM\n  Subjec=\r\nt: [samuraihistory] Hanwei Swords\n\n\n  I never meant to claim that they woul=\r\nd be a &quot;Collector&quot; sword. What I should \n  have said is if you want a cheap=\r\n one to display, a Hanwei sword is the best \n  quality out there for a reas=\r\nonably low price. Hanwei are of good quality and \n  hold true to the tradit=\r\nions of the makers. Now with that said, compromises \n  have to be made to k=\r\neep the cost of them reasonable. Hanwei swords were never \n  intended to be=\r\n collector swords, they are made for practitioners and your \n  average Joe =\r\nwith an interest in them.\n\n  Greg\n  &quot;Saigo Made Eizoku Suru&quot;\n  .\n\n\n[Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
