Most of their games are the &quot;Pokemon&quot;\ncrowd...ages 5-13. They realized they couldn&#39;t compete\nwith Xbox and PS2, so went for a different market. \n\nMy advice, having played both systems (and owning\nneither, so I&#39;m not biased) is to a. buy an XBOX if\nyou want better graphics, b. buy a PS2 if you want\nbetter games, c. wait for the new PSX to come out in\nJapan, or d. check what&#39;s available for Gamecube when\nyou get to Japan this summer. They might have some\nbetter releases in Japan than in the US--that&#39;s where\nI bought my best PS1 games, that I wish I still had\nthe player for. Oh well.\n\nOne warning on d., I had to get a chip put into my\namerican player to play asian games--don&#39;t know if\nGamecube is the same. It was like the regional coding\nfor DVD&#39;s. \n--- Cesare Polenghi wrote:\n&gt; On Jun 8, 2004, at 7:47 PM, Eponymous13@...\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry, buddy.
