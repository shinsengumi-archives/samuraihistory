Then this tree became a\nholy please where budisth go to prey.\nWhen the chinese emperor became budisth and here about\nthe famous holy tree, it rise a mayor problem since he\ncan not leave the prohibited city.\nAnd this gave birth to the Bonsai.\nAs time run by, this art went to Japan with the\nbudisth monks and it was an aristocrathic japanese who\nsaw a bonsai and converted it as an ornamental\ninstrument.\nIn Japan, a Bonsai is a reminder of Nature.\nHere in occident, we tend to think in the little tree\non a pot; but in Japan Bonsai are also planted on\ngardens.\n\nAs per Samurai and Bonsai, I do not know about it.\nPerhaps it was used as a martial art ( as Cha no yu\nand calligraphy, since it trained one mind and one\nhand ).   Or just as a hobby...   \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n\n"
