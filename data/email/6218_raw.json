I&#39;m asking for something. I\n&gt; need it at History....... Can you give me some\n&gt; information about battle maps???? I mean, just like\n&gt; in WWII. Maps of the area where the battles took\n&gt; place.\n\nEdy--\n\nHi Eddy and everybody\n\nSorry I have not been around for a while, my work on the Shimabara Rebellion and the graphic works on the &quot;heradry&quot; have taken longer that anticipated (plus other thing getting in the way!!)\n\nSo Battle Maps; as Nate replied all depends on your interest... However, I could point you to a couple of the Osprey Series, reasonably cheap and readily available. The two are Nagashino 1575, by Stephen Turnbull, and Sekigahara 1600, by &quot;our own&quot; Anthony Bryant. Both have reasonable two dimentional maps and excellent 3D section maps. Good as a starter?\n\nCheers,\n                    Rod :-)\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
