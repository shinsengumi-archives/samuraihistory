Do you happen to have any information on the \nfirst Choshu expedition? For example, the numbers on each sides, \nwhat hans participated, any tactics, other important information... \n&lt;g&gt;\nAll the books ive looked at and websites ive read just keep \nsaying &quot;and there was a first choshu expedition, which succeeded, \naww..., and then there was a second, which failed, yay...&quot;\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; First off 007,\n&gt; \tShame on you for not paying attention in class! A the battle \nof \n&gt; Toba--Fushimi ,which happened by accident, the Shinsen-gumi lead \nthe \n&gt; Tokugawa forces. They fought a bitter argument to be first in line \n&gt; cause they thought so highly of themselves. Carrying sword and \nspear \n&gt; they the first to encounter the Satsuma-Choshu troops and the \nfirst to \n&gt; be cut down. Their retreat prevented the western trained Tokugawa \n&gt; troops behind them to organize properly thus the advantage was \ngiven to \n&gt; the loyalist army with the first shots. After this I beleive it \nwas \n&gt; Hijikata who said &quot;swords are useless, the age of the gun is \nhere..&quot; or \n&gt; something to that effect.\n&gt; \tSurely though you are thinking of Tabaruzaka, 17 days of \nslaughter on \n&gt; the outskirts of Kumamoto. In a small pass in the hills, covered \nby \n&gt; thick bamboo grove, in the pouring rain (it rained for 15 days!) \nthe \n&gt; &quot;samurai&quot; army from Satsuma repeatedly attacked and repelled the \n&gt; Government troops. Their guns were nearly useles in the constant \n&gt; downpour, they couldn&#39;t maneuver as they had been trained and they \nhad \n&gt; no covering artillery.\n&gt; \tOn the 16th day the farmers were replaced by Aizu samurai, \nwho carried \n&gt; a burning hatred for Satsuma, artillery was finally in place \nnearby on \n&gt; a commanding hilltop and the rain stopped. It was all she wrote \nafter \n&gt; that...\n&gt; -t\n&gt; \n&gt; Kosu ni kosarenu Tabaruzaka!!\n\n\n\n"
