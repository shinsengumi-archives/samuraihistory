I have been dis=\r\ncussing the actual existence/use of tetsubo with\n&gt; some fellow RPG players.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Tetsubo (&quot;iron staff&quot;?) are those big and heavy iron studded staves\n&gt; =\r\noften seen in old samurai prints. They seem to have been popular\n&gt; during t=\r\nhe Gempei war and/or Kamakura period. I have also read that\n&gt; they were use=\r\nd as a kind of psychological weapon, to intimidate the\n&gt; enemies with a &quot;bi=\r\ng fu*king club&quot;. (I seem to remember that nodachi\n&gt; blades were also used f=\r\nor a similar purpose, in later eras).\n&gt;\n&gt; According to another source found=\r\n on the internet, the tetsubo was\n&gt; also - and foremost - employed from hor=\r\nseback (which surprised me,\n&gt; because I would have thought that a such a we=\r\napon would be too\n&gt; cumbersome to be used effectively from the saddle), so =\r\nthe wielder\n&gt; could add the mount&#39;s momentum to his swing, for a truly deva=\r\nstating\n&gt; blow.\n&gt;\n&gt; I still wonder to what extent the tetsubos were actuall=\r\ny used on the\n&gt; battlefield.\n&gt; Were they a common sight on the battlefield =\r\nor were they limited\n&gt; to earlier historic periods and/or specific tactical=\r\n purposes?\n&gt; Were there a specific martial style associated with the tetsub=\r\no, such\n&gt; as to allow something like basic parries, counterattacks or &quot;call=\r\ned\n&gt; shots&quot;, or their use was simple and straightforward (a- lift weapon;\n&gt;=\r\n b- lower weapon on enemy&#39;s head; 3- repeat from 1.)? They don&#39;t look\n&gt; lik=\r\ne they could be used like a naginata, a bo staff or anything like\n&gt; that.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Any info on the subject is appreciated.\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; C E Z\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
