It suited the samurai character which was \nmarked by self-justification, self-reliance, pride and vanity, \nand did not bother him with quibbles about morality, or right \nand wrong.\n\nBy far the most significant influences upon the samurai and \nswordsmanship in particular was Shinto, Tendai Buddhism and the \nsyncretic forms of &#39;mikkyo&#39; - Shingon or esoteric Buddhism.\n\nA study of &#39;horimono&#39; - the engravings made on sword blades - \nshowed over 95% bore images from Shingon Buddhism - none \nconcerned Zen or its concepts.\n\nThe direct and founding influences on the development of \nswordsmanship came from:\n\nTaoism - an understanding of natural principle\n\nConfucianism - ethics and morality\n\nShinto - aesthetic values\n\nAnd Shingon, which bears elements of the above.\n\nFurthermore the names of the techniques of swordsmanship \nthemselves show Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist and Shinto \ninfluence, and the great schools themselves are founded on \nShinto Shrines.\n\nIn short, one might say there were Zen swordsmen, but \nswordsmmanship itself is the product of Shinto and Taoist \nprinciples and practice.\n\nThomas\n\n-- \n\nWhatever you Wanadoo:\nhttp://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/\n\nThis email has been checked for most known viruses - find out more at: http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm\n\n"
