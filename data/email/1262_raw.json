They clean them regularly. That&#39;s it. No\n&gt;secrets, no tricks.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;ve heard that some of the iron used in constructing the swords was \nhigh in nickel which would certainly help make swords made from it more \ncorrosion resistant. However note that even stainless steel rusts if \nit&#39;s not cared for, it&#39;s just a slower process than pure high carbon \nsteels. I wouldn&#39;t call this a secret of this period, it wasn&#39;t really \nuntil the late 19th and early 20th century that people understood why \ncertain iron ores had superior characteristics for certain applications. \nBeing high in nickel is not necessarily a good characteristic, most \nstainless steels are inferior in edge holding characteristics compared \nto pure high carbon steels which is why most good carpenter tools are \nstill made from it.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
