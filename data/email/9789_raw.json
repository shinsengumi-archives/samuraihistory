The answers for this could just get very long. If you have more specific questions after that, Im sure more people would be willing to help. \n\nIn short though, the word &quot;samurai&quot; is derived from the verb meaning &quot;to serve.&quot; Serving is a critical concept to the idea of the samurai and tells one something about the role of the samurai/their function in society. \n\nIs it practiced today? The question is a difficult one because as a way of life, I&#39;m sure some people in the modern world (ex. Yukio Mishima) would think it is, but the bushi as a class of people ended long ago. \n\nGood luck in your pursuits,\n\n\n\n\n\njames mathies &lt;unhappiclown04@...&gt; wrote:                             Thank you letting me join the group.My question who started the samurai?What does the name samurai mean and do they practice it today\n \n [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n \n \n     \n                                       \n\n\nJonathan P.
