Seeing this from the placement of \ntroops, he proposed a confab with the other general.\n\tHe spent all night showing the man on maps of the area the precarious \nposition he was in and suggested all the things he might do to resist \nbut showed him in the end the result would always be the same. Seeing \nhe was in no position to resist he surrendered his troop without a \nsingle man lost. War without fighting? or the greatest trick ever \nplayed by a general?\n\n-t\n\n\n"
