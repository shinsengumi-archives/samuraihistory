The\n&gt;russians were kinda cool about and said that If you put the Crownprins\n&gt;in Moscow, we will let you stay, and you have two weeks to comply. We\n&gt;didnt. They threw us out. So for two weeks, the russian emoire was a\n&gt;part of Sweden.\n\n&gt;The Japanese military didnt evolv at all untill the meji revolution.\n&gt;Kinda stagnant for 400 years...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
