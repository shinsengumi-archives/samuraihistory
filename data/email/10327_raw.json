In this podcast, we examine the defense of the port of Nagas=\r\naki, from the political and military structure to the actual defenses const=\r\nructed at the port. We also examine the successes and failures that occurre=\r\nd in Nagasaki, starting with the torching of a Portuguese ship and executio=\r\nn of most of its sailors in 1640, to the drastic failure to defend the port=\r\n against the British Navy ship Phaeton in 1808.\n\nMentioned in this podcast:=\r\n\n\nArima, Seiho.
