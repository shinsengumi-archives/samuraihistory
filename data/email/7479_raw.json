A larger force (or a\nlarge force showing up at the proper time) might have\ncause a quicker rout from the loyalists there by\nending the battle quicker.  \n\nAlthough since the rout first seemed to occur with the\nShimazu, and they are not known for their weak\nspirits, perhaps it would not have had an effect\nafterall.\n\n--- seikei7248@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks for the post...
