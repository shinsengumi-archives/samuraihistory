Is ever interesting to talk about these\nthings=\r\n.\nAnyway, I am used to European market, in which a lukystrike, as\neventuell=\r\ny this one, to find ancestral, also if not Josaku or Sansaku,\nblades in gun=\r\nto mounting is extincted by the early &#39;80 at least. So I am\npretty sceptica=\r\nl by nature about this. But American market is another\nmatter...\n\n\n-----Mes=\r\nsaggio originale-----\nDa: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@...] \nInviato=\r\n: venerd=EC 9 maggio 2003 8.26\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: R=\r\ne: R: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\n&gt;The shape (ichimonji it seem=\r\ns to me) of the tang match with the\n&gt;swordsmith&#39;s work and period? And why =\r\nso slight curvature in a 17th\n&gt;century blade ?\n\nNo but it would if the swor=\r\nd were suriage,\nwhich is how it appears to my eye, this would reduce\nthe so=\r\nri as well. Remembering that in the 1660&#39;s\na shallow curve was en vogue.\n\n&gt;=\r\nIt resemble to me no &#39;&#39;black color&#39;&#39; rust in the tang but it may be due\n&gt;to=\r\n the flash light surely used to take the photos. The handle is rather\n&gt;long=\r\n, suggesting a possible ancestral blade, but... also the signature\n&gt;seems t=\r\no me too much well preserved for having 300 years,\n\nI have seen older blade=\r\ns that looked new,\nwith surprisingly little rust for all their years.\nA cus=\r\ntom handle may indicate an older blade or just the preference of \nthe sword=\r\nsman..\n\n&gt;as the sharp\n&gt;angles of the tang and mekugi-ana. Sharpness may be =\r\nexplained with a\n&gt;borders re-shaping (saving the signature) to fit with the=\r\n kyugunto\n&gt;mounting\n\nmay have been altered to fit the gunto mounts true\n\n&gt;b=\r\nut I am still not able to see filemarks, whether the kanji are\n&gt;rather good=\r\n visible. Without jihada, boshi and a closer image of at\n&gt;least little part=\r\n of the hamon is hard to determine the school. If this\n&gt;patterns do not mat=\r\nch with the signature ?\n\nYes correct kantei dictates that the signature con=\r\nfirms what you see \nin the blade. This is why I asked for pics of the kissa=\r\nki and \nmonouchi.\n\n&gt;May be a new swordsmith signature of later time? Becaus=\r\ne effectively,\nif\n&gt;old, is hard to think of a fake with such a signature, b=\r\nut nowadays\nsome\n&gt;fakers make the same reasoning.\n\nGranted but fakers want =\r\nto sell swords, faking an obscure signature \nmay throw off the wary but wou=\r\nld hardly bring enough money to be \nworth the trouble. The Meikan is a list=\r\ning of over 20,000 smiths \nincluding gendai, if there is a later smith with=\r\n this signature he \nwould turn up here. Although Banshu (Harima) did not ex=\r\nist after 1870 \nor so, thus it would be very unlikely to turn up in a genda=\r\ni sig.\n\tAgain I ask Scott, what does his translation say, and can he \nbe so=\r\n kind as to provide more pics. As you say we need to kantei the \nsword and =\r\nnot the koshirae.\n  -t\n\n&gt;Honestly, signature is the last thing I see to, wh=\r\nile here we have to\n&gt;work with it as the first step. And to be sincere, I w=\r\nas not able to\n&gt;read it as good as you have made. I have thinked about the =\r\nlittle label\n&gt;:\n&gt;surrenders swords had such a lebel to make it easy to give=\r\n back\n&gt;(eventually...) the blade to the formerly owner, and this may sugges=\r\nt\n&gt;the blade was of a certain interest.\n&gt;But this is not a rule in kantei (=\r\nfakes of surrenders blade with\n&gt;&#39;&#39;dedications&#39;&#39; have a their own market...)=\r\n. If Scott would see at the\n&gt;back of the handle and other details comparing=\r\n it to the description\n&gt;shown in the part of the article I have posted, may=\r\n be we can argue if\n&gt;the mounting was intended for a High officer, enforcin=\r\ng the &#39;&#39;ancestral\n&gt;blade&#39;&#39; theory.\n&gt;By the way, Gen. Yamashita&#39;s sword was =\r\nof the same period...\n&gt;Please have no trouble to refute my suggestions as I=\r\n&#39;m taking this as a\n&gt;learning session, with a lot of fun.  \n&gt;Thanks for you=\r\nr time.\n&gt;Carlo\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Messaggio originale-----\n&gt;Da: tom helm [mailto:junkm=\r\nail@...]\n&gt;Inviato: mercoled=EC 7 maggio 2003 9.06\n&gt;A: samuraihist=\r\nory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Oggetto: Re: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;Carlo-\n&gt;       Scott has the translation so he can easily straighten us ou=\r\nt\n&gt;and the mountings are clearly wartime production. Without further\n&gt;info =\r\nthough, I stand by my translation. The Nihonto Meikan lists five\n&gt;Katsuyosh=\r\ni using this kanji, but only one who signed in this manner.\n&gt;The shodai Ise=\r\n Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sengo Masashige.\n&gt;Masashige was a student =\r\nof the infamous Muramasa. Banshu Katsuyoshi\n&gt;was originally from the Ise li=\r\nne of Katsuyoshi and worked around the\n&gt;Tenna era (1681-1683).\n&gt;       One =\r\nwould expect to see some characteristics of the Sengo\n&gt;school in his works,=\r\n thus pics of the kissaki and monouchi are\n&gt;important. I agree no final det=\r\nermination can be made without sword\n&gt;in hand, but I would posit that a fak=\r\ner or &#39;tribute&#39; sword would\n&gt;hardly choose to copy the work of a late gener=\r\nation smith from a\n&gt;little known line.\n&gt;Tom\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: \n&gt;&lt;http://www.samura=\r\ni-archives.com&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;---\n&gt;To unsubscribe from th=\r\nis group, send an email to:\n&gt;samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
