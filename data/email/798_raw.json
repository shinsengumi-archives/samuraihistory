I have never read your book, is that true do they take their \nideas from your books, thats a pretty cool compliment then, they say \nimitaition is the best compliment.  I still think the detail is good \nI am no expert but I have seen other complanies 25mm and there Bushi \nranges are to put it kind poor/.  (^_^) (^O^) I do think they are too \nexpensive though.  I might have to buy your book sometime to check \nthat out.  Maybe you should get them to put a link to your book, they \nhave Turnbulls, by the bucket load (what a surprise!). \n\nAnyways cheers for replying \n\nMark   \n\n\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------\nA.J Bryant wrote\n\nMwa ha ha!!\n\nI love it. Take a look at the first graphic on\n http://www.eastofindia.com/spring2001_1.htm and then plate J-K in my \nfirst\n book (&quot;The Samurai&quot;). I wonder where they get their inspiration... \n&lt;G&gt;\n \n Right down to the poses...\n \n I gotta tell you, though. That level of detail is what I&#39;d expect in \na 24mm.\n Not a 54.\n \n&gt; Tony\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"
