Were females of samurai households recognized as members of the samurai \n&gt;class and expected and required to conduct themselves in distinctive and \n&gt;&quot;honorable&quot; ways? Absolutely. There was even a recognized female counterpart \n&gt;to seppuku, involving use of the short (shortest) sword to sever the jugular. \n&gt;And in certain cases female members of the samurai class could perform \n&gt;distinctly military functions.\n\nI think this may be the same thing that you are talking about Will, \nbut there were also women who fulfilled some of the administrative \nduties of samurai, in places/for jobs that men were not appropriate. \nFor instance security for the various facilities where female members \nof a samurai household led their daily lives. One of these roles was \nthe o-Hi-no-Ban. \u001b$B8f2P$NHV\u001b(B.\n\nAs you say, this is not exactly the same as &quot;being a female samurai&quot; \nin the sense that the original poster probably meant.\n\nAnother possible angle for this question is &quot;did women engage in \ncombat&quot; or &quot;were women trained to fight&quot;. The accepted wisdom of \ntoday is that women of the samurai class were trained to fight with \nthe naginata. as a last line of defence. The notion being that they \nmight be the only ones left to fight in case the enemy soldiers broke \ninto the castle.\n\nPersonally I am not familiar with whether or not that is reality. To \nme it has the feel of legend. I&#39;ve only ever read or heard about it in \nthe sort of vaguely self-assured way that is usually the way \n&quot;common wisdom&quot; is talked about. I&#39;d love to learn about either \nactual training programs that existed, or actual cases where the women \npicked up their naginata and fought as a group.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
