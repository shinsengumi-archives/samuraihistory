Kinda weird, kinda wild... Why don&#39;t we\n&gt; step back from the dryads, gnomes and elves, and get back into\n&gt; Japanese history for a little while?  Since we are still in the\n&gt; holiday season, I don&#39;t feel like playing Forum Nazi, and my Gestapo\n&gt; appears to be on vacation anyway, so let&#39;s just do this all amicable\n&gt; like, and sashay our way back to the guys with helmets and swords\n&gt; that we so know and love.\n\nYorokonde!\n\nArigato!\n\n\nTony\n\nG:  You know, if the two of you are both taking my posting this way, it&#39;s\napparent I wasn&#39;t clear enough.  My apologies.  Because after all, those\n&#39;guys with the helmets and swords&#39; had religious beliefs, beliefs that\naffected the way they regarded those swords (and a great deal of the rest of\ntheir world as well).  That does seem, to my poor brain at least, to be\nrelevant to the subject of samurai history.  The dryads and naiads were\nintended as parallels in western culture, and I hoped that by using such\nexamples in discussing Shinto with a primarily western audience, I could\nmake clearer the great variety of beings that in Shinto are considered to\nhave spirits.\nKitsuno, I did not in fact cite gnomes and elves; but I believe I could\nlegitimately have done so in the context of Shinto, and still have been on\nthe subject.  To be honest, I don&#39;t know what the Shinto view on, say, the\nTengu really is.  Are they technically considered kami?  I&#39;m honestly most\ncurious to learn that.\nPerhaps I should have expanded on the whole subject for greater clarity, but\nI rather thought that brevity would be more welcome than detail.\n\tAs to the subject as a whole... gentlemen, I find it hard to believe that\nin a forum for the discussion of samurai history, you both regard it as\ninappropriate to address their beliefs.  ...At least their religious\nbeliefs:  bushido (and its modern offshoots and parallels) are appropriate\nbut Shinto (and its) are not?\nThis is what makes me think that I was somehow unclear.  My own beliefs I\nbrought up primarily because of the &#39;land mine&#39; I inadvertently set by\nhaving failed to note them in the earlier rounds of this discussion:  but\nperhaps the mention of them in this round caused some confusion in turn.\n(Catch-22, anyone?)  I suggest to you that I have not actually strayed from\nthe subject of the list by pursuing this thread.  I was, and am still,\ntrying to increase understanding - my own and others&#39; - of a traditional\naspect of Japanese culture, and specifically of the subculture of the bushi.\nI thought that&#39;s what we were here for.  Kinda weird, kinda wild, as you\nsay.  But there it is.\n\tGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
