This group is pretty big on &quot;no bushido before\nmusashi&quot; and I think\n(from the reviews I&#39;ve read) King assumes bushido was always a part of the\nSamurai lifestyle.\n------------------\nOCT: Nope, I didn&#39;t read the book, but I think this statement is aceptable.\nAccording to what I&#39;ve studied, there was before Musashi, a type of non\nwritten Samurai&#39;s Morality System.\n\n\nI haven&#39;t read much on the use of Zen in the Samurai class. Zen seems to be\nstrangely\ncompatible in an opposites attract sort of way with Bushido, but what about\nbefore Bushido\nwas really around? Which, did Zen give birth to Bushido in some way? And\nwhat role did Zen\nreally play in the samurai&#39;s life? I just don&#39;t see the connection or\ncompatibility between the\nupper warrior class and Zen Buddhism. The principles and lifestyle just\ndon&#39;t seem to mesh.\n-------------------------\nOCT: Don&#39;t know if it will help ya get the answer, but those symbols at the\nKessa (Sanskrit: Kassaya) of Soto Zen Shu is actually Crest of Arms of two\nSamurai Families that I don&#39;t recall their names. However I believe any\nZenji Bishop (Sozu) can answer this to ya.\n\n\n\nAnyway, In defense of Mr. Lee,\n--------------\nOCT: In defense? If I understand well, ye pointed a third way of thinking,\nthat I should agree in some points.\n\n\nWhat he may have been getting at was the difference between Mahayana and\nTheravada\nBuddhism. Mahayana is the more popular, less rigorous, and more syncretistic\nvariety found\nthroughout SE Asia, whereas Theravada is the more &quot;pure&quot; version of\nBuddhism, which had a\nstronger hold in Japan (Zen Buddhism being a subcategory of Theravada). Zen,\nas a\nsubcategory of Theravada, adds to the mix the idea of &quot;immediate&quot;\nenlightenment rather than\ngradual enlightenment, through the use of meditation to bring about\nenlightening moments, or\nepiphanies.\n---------------------------\nOCT: I think ye are not 100% accurate. Dhyana is not a theravada school,\nhowever there is comments between the Dhyana (Zen, Chaan) school and\nTheravadins that Dhyana is the most Theravada of the Mahayana Schools, and\nya must know that Vajrayana is a subdivision of the Mahayana as well, since\nit both includes Mahayana Sutras and Treatises, the Classical (theravada)\nCanon that is the Tripitaka (Three Vases) and their own vajrayana treatises,\nsutras, shastras and saddhanas.\n\n\n\n\nBut where Lee says that Korean, Japanese, and Chinese Buddhism should all be\nin one\ncategory, he&#39;s right as far as them all being Theravada, but he&#39;s wrong in\nthat Japanese\nBuddhism is pretty different from Chinese, at least in that Chinese Buddhism\nis more\nsyncretistic. Japanese Buddhism is generally regarded as being the version\nclosest to the\noriginal Buddhism.\n---------------------\nOCT: It depends to what school you refer. The Hokkekyo is totally Japanese\nand much of its contends have a great range of diferences between it and\nOriginal Buddhism in itself. Hokekkyo and Pure Land Teachings was the most\npopular between the peasants and would be that what Mr. Lee called Japan&#39;s\nFolk-Buddhism, However Zen Shu (all both two schools of Japan - Soto and\nHinzai if not mispelled the last one) and Vajrayana Schools (Shingon-Shu and\nTendai-Shu) was the popular ones between the dominant class like the\nSamurais and those of the Imperial Court.\n***\nAll of couse, worshipped Shinto Gods (specially the Imperial Family, Te\nhee).\n\n\n\n\nLee wrote:\n&gt;The Japanese Buddism results from intellectual\n&gt; interaction among Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism\n&gt; itself throughout centuries, the first two of which\n&gt; did not really have much effect on India, South Asia,\n&gt; and Tibet.\n&gt; Through this interaction, primitive Taoism and\n&gt; Confucianism was reborn as more subtle and complex\n&gt; philosophy with rigorous logical structures in 5 and\n&gt; 12 centuries respectivly\n\nI wouldn&#39;t say that Japanese Buddhism &quot;results from&quot; that interaction, but\nrather that the\npresence of Taoism and Confucianism allowed for Buddhism to be accepted with\ngreater ease.\nTaoism and Confucianism are primarily atheistic, as is Theravada Buddhism.\nBoth promote a\ngeneral morality, as does Buddhism. And Taoism, with its quizzical proverbs\nand mysterious\nstatements, parallels (a little bit) the practices of Zen teachers quizzing\ntheir students (strange\nstatements that don&#39;t really mean anything but might help you understand\nsomething else).\n-------------\nOCT: Your thoughs have logic, but sorry. According to what I remember,\nBuddhism does not entered due to the acceptance of Taoism and Confucianism\nin Japan. But in an independent way. I unfortunatelly does not have anymore\nthe book of japanese history that taunt this to me, so I can&#39;t give ya the\naccurate date and century, but a certain japanese emperor married a chinese\nnoble lady, and when she comes to Japan, she brough an image of Amithaba\nBuddha, and some sutras. The image was destroyed by shinto peasants, who was\nafraid that &quot;this new religion would be forced down by the emperor&#39;s wife\nand force them to forget their holy Gods&quot; but in the end, buddhism never\nentered in conflict with the native religion, but instead, it helped in the\npreservation of shinto, since Japan was illiterate at that time, and all\nShinto Rites, myths and history was based on Oral Tradition. With the advent\nof buddhism, and latter, the Kukai (Shingon-shu founder) interference, there\ncomes the hiragana and katakana, and the common folk was also learn how to\nwrite and read. So, there comes from it, a form of shinto written liturgy.\n\n\n\nAnd Buddhism can easily be looked at as &quot;The Way&quot;. But &quot;parallels&quot; is a\ndifferent thing than\n&quot;results from.&quot; I think history would show that Japanese Buddhism - rather\nthan being an\nexample of syncretism - is actually the closest to the original Buddhism of\nIndia. Mahayana\nBuddhism is sometimes VERY syncretistic, and has little to do with what\nSiddartha Gautama\nactually taught, and again, the Buddhism of Japan is different from that of\nChina, even though\nthey&#39;re both technically Theravada.\n------------------\nOCT: Don&#39;t forget that even Shingon-shu and Tendai-shu comes from China,\nalthough the tantric buddhism that was transmited to Kukai, was extinct.\nPerhaps buddhism comes intact to China, and there remained so, until a very\nlatter influence that changed their ways. The reason why I disagree with\nyour statement about they be both theravada, I already explained. Also\nremember that the most important Sutra of Zen Shu is Hannya Shingyo - Heart\nSutra (Praj�a P�ramita Hrdaya Sutra)\n\nFor those who don&#39;t know the history: Buddhism started in India as kind of a\nreactionary\nspinoff of Hinduism. It grew in popularity and Buddhist missionaries were\nsent out to Asia. As\nTheravada Buddhism spread in Asia (and through China, into Japan) there was\na resurgence of\nHinduism in India, and the Hindus killed or drove out all the Buddhists. In\nJapan, the Buddhism\nstayed more or less in its pure form, but in the rest of Asia, it developed\ninto a less rigorous\nversion (Mahayana) and mixed with the traditional religions. Though China is\ntechnically\ntheravada, it&#39;s still syncretistic, so more like the rest of asia than\nJapan.\n------------------------------------\nOCT: The ressurgence of hinduism in India was totally pacific. Although it\nwas an threat to Buddhism in India, it was non violent and buddhism was\ndestroyed there through extreme syncretism, with hinduism assimilating some\nof the buddhist vallues and Siddharta Gautama (Shakyamuni Buddha) as one of\nthose avatars that are manifestations of Vishnu. The real violent threat to\nbuddhism in India was two centuries latter, with the muslim invasion.\n\nThe sincretism in the Japanese case, is called as Shinbutsu Shugo, and is\nfully studied at Sophia University at Japan.\n\nAnd yes, buddhism, taoism and confucionism (as well, poetry, caligraphy,\netc) was subject of study in universities at Edo Jidai, and all of them\ncould be possible, be the seeds to form the non written Samurai morality,\neven before Musashi, since those who went to those universities was the\nnoble aristocratic classes and those samurais.\n\nI remember that when I was following Shugendo or Vajrayana, my former\nmasters would be very angry if I would be doing any kind of Salada, so just\nremembering their angry faces was enough to be horrorified with what  Mr.\nLee stated. And it had nothing to do with intolerance. One of them have an\nchristian son, but he always explained to his son that one way is one way\nand another way is another way. One cannot follow two at the same time.\n\nregards\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\n\n"
