My fists were\n&gt; &gt; clenched the entire 10 \n&gt; &gt; mins I heard him talk. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Maikeru\n&gt; \n&gt; My area of study was physical education\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s no different than getting a bunch of famous\n&gt; athletes on the Presidents council for physical\n&gt; fitness as opposed to physical educators, dieticians\n&gt; and exercise physiologists that could actually do some\n&gt; good.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rick\n&gt; \n&gt; Monthly Fight Clips in Monthly Announcements\n&gt; http://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/Martial_Arts_Ads_And_Discussion\n&gt; \n&gt; Workout Timer Plays Music or Tada Try it Out It&#39;s NEW \n&gt; \nhttp://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/KirkhamsEbooks2 /files/MartialArt\nsSoftware/\n&gt; \n&gt; FREE Speed Drills Mini Ebook \nhttp://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/KirkhamsEbooks2 /files/MartialArt\nsEbooks2/\n&gt; \n&gt; WARNING TO PARENTS \nhttp://starbulletin.com/2004/08/12/news/story3.html\n\nI do not remember what college he was from, but in my eyes he soiled \ntheir reputation. It reminds me of an incident that happened to me in \nMA. I was in the amrory getting pictures of a daisho and some early \nEdo period armor for a project. The tour guide had a group with him, \nand he pointed out the armor, while I was writing down some notes. He \nsaid that samurai armor was made from bamboo since there was not alor \nof good iron in Japan (I wonder how they got all those yari, katana \nand kabuto.) so armor was made from bamboo. Clearly he was wrong, \nescpecially when the information plate next to the armor said it was \nmade from metal and silk. So in the end I do not listen to tour \nguides much, I always check and double check info and thats that.\n\nSo in the end BA,MA or PHD someone can be wrong.\n\n\nMaikeru \n\n\n\n"
