You have been fair with all of us by \nexplaining what you meant. \n\nI do have some thoughts about the whole lineage thing.  I&#39;m not an \nexpert, so I hope Tony will correct me if I&#39;m way off.  I do believe \nthe practice of one on one combat existed in the early samurai \nperiod.  Even in the Gempei war many challanges were shouted to foes \nbased on the existing honor system.  Many Samurai did call out their \nlineage before a battle.  Although it seems silly to us now, we have \nto remember how isolated Japan was from the rest of the world.  They \nhad a system of fighting wars that was very different than any \nother...Until the Mongols invaded.  Then the Samurai began to wise \nup.  &quot;Hey, these Mongols don&#39;t really care about our family do they?&quot;  \nMy understanding is that the Japanese were totally unprepared to \nfight a war with an organized mongolian military machine.  The \nKamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But the samurai were \nprepared the second time, and the preparations/strategic philosophies \nthat followed changed the face of Samurai warfare.  \n\nInto the Sengoku is when Ashigaru are much more apparent in the \narmies.  Long after the lineage practice had been proven unwise by \nthe Mongols (I know, they were actually Korean and Chinese \nconscripts).  So at this point I can&#39;t see them doing it either.\n\nMany years later, after a couple hundred years of peace, under the \nTokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is about the point that \nBushido is crystalized into what we know today.  Prior to the \npeaceful Edo Jidai, much of the &quot;honor sytem&quot; wasn&#39;t based on those \nhigh and holy precepts that everyone thinks the samurai lived by.  It \nwas only in the last years of the samurai that the bushido code would \ninfluence the population.\n\nI guess, I too get a little sick of generalizations.  I recently went \nto a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai and Kensei.  We were \ninformed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido code.  They were \nwarriors and role models that were bound by honor to better society.  \nThey helped everyone gain greater understanding by standing for \npeace, justice, and the American way (well, they didn&#39;t really say \nthat, but they might as well have).  Upon hearing this, I could hear \nTony&#39;s voice with a resounding &quot;Bunk!&quot;  There were good and bad \nSamurai.  They didn&#39;t all live honorable and they Bushido code didn&#39;t \naffect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you must agree that they \nhad some system of honor.  How else could we quantify a good or bad \nsamurai?  But it wasn&#39;t &quot;Bushido&quot; persay.  Since &quot;Bushido&quot; did not \nexist in the Sengoku, it probably wasn&#39;t used to keep the troops in \nline.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate their troops but it may \nhave been much more simple and less dubious than you presume.  \nPromises of fame and fortune, political status, social status, pride, \nand land are other methods that could be used to obtain loyalty.  \n\nIn short, I don&#39;t think that there was a universal conspiracy by \nleaders of the time, to devise a system to keep a brotha down.  That \nwas not the &quot;purpose&quot; of honor or bushido, although it (like anything \nelse) could be perverted and warped to serve sinister means.\n\nBrandon\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kyle Segall&quot; &lt;\nklancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Try a little more than Shogun. Akechi Mitsuhide wouldn&#39;t have been \n&gt; thought so poor had he actually succeeded in becoming Shogun (his \n&gt; alliances not fallen apart, the mori finding out about nobunaga&#39;s \n&gt; death before hideyoshi). Don&#39;t kid yourself into think he really \ndid \n&gt; anything special. Just dumb.\n&gt; The daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai \n&gt; really believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to \nsee \n&gt; that. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the \n&gt; peacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.\n&gt; You claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its true \n&gt; that confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far \n&gt; from a system of honor, especially what you&#39;re thinking about. \nThink \n&gt; about it; if you&#39;re a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what \n&gt; little time you have off, what room is there for the &quot;honor&quot; that \n&gt; you think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do \n&gt; anything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure preaches \n&gt; about may be true... but that wasn&#39;t really out of a sense of \nhonor.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the noble \n&gt; ones. I doubt an ashigaru wielding a spear was shouting, &quot;I am so-\n&gt; and-so, from so-and-so village! Come get some!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And sorry about the snappy remarks... I&#39;m just SICK of all these \n&gt; kids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for every \n&gt; age, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his actions. \n&gt; Only famous for who he killed and how dumb he was in doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n"
