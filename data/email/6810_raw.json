Can anyone tell me\n&gt; what Kiyomori&#39;s \n&gt; parents address him as? It sounds like Heita: is\n&gt; this a title (eldest son??) \n&gt; or a family name?\n\nNo, it was his name. Yoshikawa&#39;s &quot;Shin-Heike\nMonogatari&quot; explains it--it was his yobina. Most\nsamurai had several names. The yobina was what the\nfamily members and others &quot;familiar&quot; with the person\nwould call them. For example, Minamoto Yoshitsune was\n&quot;Kurou&quot; (9th Son), so his full name would be written\nas Minamoto Kurou Yoshitsune. Usually you see these in\nnames having to do with either birth order (Jiro,\nSaburo, etc) or will be names ending in -hei/bei or\n-e&#39;emon, etc. It can be frustrating when trying to\ntrack individuals through historical texts, because it\nmay refer to a person in one place as Kiyomori, the\nnext as Heita, the next as Rokuhara-dono....etc. \n\nNate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
