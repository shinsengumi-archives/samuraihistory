I just got the new\nCriteri=\r\non release and it&#39;s great, with all the interviews in it.\n \nHowever, now I =\r\ndo want to get into some actual history. Concerning the Ii\nclan. I know tha=\r\nt they wore red armor and that there is a story about them\nfrom their earli=\r\ner days of glory. Apparently, during one of the battles\n(forget which one),=\r\n one of their generals stationed some strong men at the\nrear, to prevent an=\r\nyone from deserting even in the midst of a hard-fought\nbattle. Some stern s=\r\ntuff here.\n \n***SPOILER ALERT for those who haven&#39;t yet seen the film and d=\r\non&#39;t wish to\nknow what happens.\n \nAs I was watching SEPPUKU (the western ti=\r\ntle is &quot;Hara Kiri&quot;). In the course\nof the film, a ragged, destitute ronin s=\r\nhows up at the gate of the Ii clan&#39;s\nEdo headquarters, presumably to reques=\r\nt a place to commit seppuku so that he\nno longer would have to live in dire=\r\n poverty. But in reality, he is in\ndesperate need for money to get a doctor=\r\n for his sick child, so he is making\nthis request in the hope that the Ii c=\r\nlan members will feel sorry for him.\nThat they will give him money to go aw=\r\nay -- and with the money, he can get\naid for his sick son. \n \nInstead, the =\r\nIi clan members insist that he actually commit seppuku. The\nronin is so des=\r\ntitute that he has pawned his swords and is wearing blades of\nbamboo. When =\r\nthe clan members find this out, they are outraged and decide to\nforce him t=\r\no commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Which he does in\ngreat agon=\r\ny. Later on, his father-in-law (Nakadai) seeks to avenge this\ndeath and peo=\r\nple can watch the film to see what happens.\n \nBut in actual history: I was =\r\nwondering: during the 17th century, did the\nhistorical Ii clan actually hav=\r\ne any tendencies toward the type of sadism\nthat the film shows them to have=\r\n? According to the film, the bamboo seppuku\nwas a matter of public record (=\r\nthe revenge for this is what is covered up by\nthe clan officials).  It was =\r\nconsidered to be an appropriate punishment for\na begging ronin who came to =\r\nrequest seppuku but had sold his blades (&quot;the\nsoul of the samurai&quot;), so he =\r\nonly had blades of bamboo.\n \nI&#39;ve heard vaguely from a few others that ther=\r\ne was a real history of\ndestitute ronin appearing at clan gates to presumab=\r\nly request a spot for\nseppuku -- but who actually wanted &quot;go away&quot; money. I=\r\ns there any history of\nanyone ever being forced to commit seppuku with a ba=\r\nmboo blade? Was the Ii\nclan ever involved in any of this sort of thing? \n \n=\r\nOr did the novelist Takiguchi Yasuhiko, who wrote the original story\nSEPPUK=\r\nU, make up all of this out of thin air and his fertile imagination? If\nTaki=\r\nguchi made up all of this, why would he use a real clan, the Ii clan,\nfor h=\r\nis scenario? Why not use a fictional clan? \n \nJust curious.
