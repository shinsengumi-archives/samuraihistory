Any way i was wondering if =\r\nany one can help me with sword names, was it a common pratice to name sword=\r\ns, i know that one of musashis opponenets ( i forget , very shameful of me =\r\ni know) names his sword of length, dfrying pole or something like that. Any=\r\n way im intrested in learning and knowing any swords named by famous samura=\r\ni and how common the practice was,oh and this isnt a harsh forum as ive bee=\r\nn helped many a time by the better educated among as thanks all ,\njames\n\nNa=\r\nte Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Squall Lionheart &lt;blue_moon_=\r\ndragon1@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; well you know, its the subject of the messa=\r\nge that\n&gt; hurts not the msg itself.\n\nBelieve it or not, this isn&#39;t the nice=\r\nst of net\nneighborhoods. I&#39;ve been accused of being the\nneighborhood bully =\r\nonce or twice. You&#39;ve got to be\ntough in this business--many people on this=\r\n email list\nare serious historians, published authors, people who\nread Japa=\r\nnese history in the original Japanese--not\nthe anime Shibuya-speak, mind yo=\r\nu, but good old\nfashioned 12th century stuff. These people don&#39;t\nconsider g=\r\naming questions worthy of their bandwidth.\nThere have been heated issues wh=\r\nen gaming types come\non here and think they know everything about samurai\ns=\r\nimply because they beat the 17th level of &quot;Samurai\nShowdown&quot; or &quot;Tenchu&quot; or=\r\n they watched Rurouni Kenshin\n(&quot;Samurai X&quot;) 25 times. If you want to learn =\r\nabout\nsamurai, start at the website www.samuraiarchives.com\nand find the &quot;T=\r\nop 10 misconceptions of the samurai&quot;.\nWhen people come here asking gaming o=\r\nr anime\nquestions, often the assumption is that they are\ndeluded by one or =\r\ntwo or all 10 of those. Things can\nget painful. \n\nGrow a thick skin, and be=\r\n willing to learn, and this\nis a nice place. If that bothers you, then I da=\r\nre you\nto say something like &quot;Anthony Bryant couldn&#39;t tell a\nsugake odoshi =\r\nfrom a obon odori&quot; and see what happens.\n\n\n*note to everyone on the board--=\r\nwhy am I continuing to\nfill your in box? Because if I answered his emails\ns=\r\ningly instead of on the list, all the others who\nanswered/asked the questio=\r\nn wouldn&#39;t get the benefit.\nSorry, and thanks for the patience.\n\nThe just-d=\r\nemoted assistant management (guess I&#39;ll go\nclean out the bathrooms now...)\n=\r\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
