Heh, heh, heh!!! Hard questions...\n\nHave you seen the film SEPPUK=\r\nU? If you haven&#39;t, do so at your earliest\nopportunity. There is a new Crite=\r\nrion edition out with subtitles in English.\nIs English your native language=\r\n, or is it Spanish? Don&#39;t know if a Spanish\nsub-titled edtion is out. \n\nAt =\r\nany rate, in this film, an impoverished ronin is torn between the choice\nof=\r\n selling his sword blades to raise money to feed his wife and child. If he\n=\r\ndid not do this, then his family would get sick and starve. So he sells the=\r\n\nsword blades. And ends up being brutally punished for this &quot;sin&quot; by some\nc=\r\nlan samurai who see him as being utterly dishonored. I personally see the\nm=\r\nan who sold his swords to try and keep his family from starving as having\nf=\r\nar more honor than the judgmental people who heaped blame upon him. As the\n=\r\nman&#39;s father-in-law states later on in the film, &quot;even a samurai cannot liv=\r\ne\non air.&quot; \n\nI&#39;m in the middle of writing a piece of fiction that deals wit=\r\nh somewhat\nsimilar themes. I try and ask,&quot;what is a sword and what is the s=\r\noul? Is a\nsword simply a metal object or is it a part of your being?.&quot; Ther=\r\ne is an old\nZen saying, I do not know who wrote it, &quot;I have no sword; I mak=\r\ne my mind my\nsword.&quot; \n\nI studied kendo for ten years and I know personally =\r\nabout how a sword or a\nbamboo shinai can become an actual extension of your=\r\n body. I own a single\nNihonto, a 400 year old wakizashi without signature o=\r\nn the tang (it used to\nbe a katana but was cut down) and when I handle this=\r\n sword, I know that it\nis more than merely metal. So also, I know that when=\r\n a samurai was forced to\ngive up or sell his sword to feed his family, it p=\r\nrobably was agony for him.\nBut he might have had to do it and this was trag=\r\nic.  \n\nI don&#39;t know if I made much sense here.\n\nCheers, Nina\n\n-----Original=\r\n Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@y=\r\nahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of federico trejos\nSent: Thursday, October 13, 20=\r\n05 2:54 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: Sword Is The Sou=\r\nl Of The Samurai? (was RE: [samuraihistory] Re:\nh itokiri kawakami gensai?)=\r\n\n\n\nGood afternoon.\nNina why do you always brings this hard to answer questi=\r\nons ??? jajajaja !!!\nOk, I think that it was something philosophical and sp=\r\niritual.  \nSome one once told me that there is two senses in life that you =\r\ncan not\ningnore : first one is when your death time is getting close and se=\r\ncond one\nis when you are hungry !!! Then I understand why he brought out\nhi=\r\ns blades.   Katana was considered the soul of the\nsamurai since it was cons=\r\nidered what ebodied bushido. \n This is interesting, a samurai think that hi=\r\ns sword is an extention of his\nbody.  So he consider his sword\na part of it=\r\n.   Besides, it was his primary weapon,\nhis life depends on it ( think abou=\r\nt this carefully ).\n  The katana is that, a weapon !!!   And the samurai\nmo=\r\nre than any one else new that.   \nSomething funny about this is that there =\r\nis anything on the Bushido code\nthat have to do with weapons !!!\nIt is a mo=\r\nral and correct conduct code.    Then I\nthink that all this is a romantic t=\r\nale out of some\nNoh.   \nNow, if you tell me that a samurai fells something =\r\nspecial and spiritual for\nhis sword, I will be with\nyou in a 100%.   \n\nBest=\r\n regards.    \n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Ya=\r\nhoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam =A1gratis! \nReg=\r\n=EDstrate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n\n----------------------=\r\n-- Yahoo!
