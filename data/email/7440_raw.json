Also there will be a talk on \n&quot;Reading Japanese inscriptions&quot;. This is again held in conjunction \nwith the SHOGUN exhibition in conjunction with the Nikko Toshogu \nShrine.\nAs museums are notoriously bad at the very specialised conservation \nand restoration of Japanese swords, with very few knowledgable \nexperts in the field, it may be interesting to hear what they have to \nsay, so I am considering attending.\nFor further info and to reserve a place, the tel no. is 0113 220 1985 \nfrom the UK.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n"
