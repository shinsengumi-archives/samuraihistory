That&#39;s the reason I was looking for help concerning the Yoshiwara fires during the late 19th century. I can remember reading about it happening but can&#39;t remember exactly where or the specific detail like month or season. I think I need to visit the library, bookstore or the university of Hawai&#39;i over here. Thanks again Nate.\n  Rod\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n  \n\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;   Again thanks Nate and sorry for my comment on the\n&gt; hakamas. I had read about that fact in a book I had\n&gt; found in a library once. I can remember facts just\n&gt; not details like titles of books, I should improve\n&gt; that fault of mine. Thanks for you help.\n\nCommon problem around here. When you&#39;ve been reading\nthis stuff for 24 years or so, it&#39;s easy to forget\nwhere each particular fact comes from. With all the\nJapanese TV/movies/books I&#39;ve watched/read over the\npast 11 years, a lot of things just become general\nimpressions. People like Nina are kind enough to\nremind me that because it&#39;s in my head, it doesn&#39;t\nserve as a source :), so I try to pull up\npictures/sources when possible. It&#39;s hard though. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
