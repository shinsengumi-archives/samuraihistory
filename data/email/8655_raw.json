His favorite spear is\n&gt; held in a temple in japan. I would like more info on the spear and its\n&gt; location. Thanks!\n&gt;\n\n From Nihon no Meiso by Numata;\n\n\tOnce a splendid Omi-yari with a ryo-shinogi blade 3shaku 3zun 3bu in  \nlength, copper fittings, with an oak pole 5shaku 7sun long. In it&#39;s  \ncurrent state the broken blade is just 3shaku 2sun 2bu(99.4cm) and  \nhalf of the original pole is burnt away. There are three mekugi-ana  \nin the heavily rusted nakago and no signature is visible. Temple  \nrecords suggest that it was damaged in an earthquake sometime in the  \nAnsei period.\n\tIt is said he was the head of the Iga ninja clan and a splendid  \nwarrior. There was a popular saying;\n\tTokugawa-dono wa hito mochi yo\n\tHattori Hanzo Oni Hanzo\n\tWatanabe Hanzo Yari Hanzo\n\tAtsumi Gengo wa Kubitori Gengo\n\n\tLord Tokugawa is a man rich with able men\n\tHattori Hanzo &quot;The Demon Hanzo&quot;\n\tWatanabe Hanzo &quot;Hanzo the spear&quot;\n\tAtsumi Gengo &quot;The Headhunter Gengo&quot;\n\n\tThe Kansei Kafu records that Hattori Hanzo was crucial in the attack  \nof Kakegawa-jo. His contribution was noted in the battles of Anegawa,  \nUshikubo, Kozakai and Takatenjin and he earned special merit at  \nMikatagahara.\n\tAt Hamamatsu-jo he was presented with a Yari, and given command of  \n150 Iga no mono. It is not clear if this THE spear he was presented  \nwith. Afterward he defeated Chikuwan, a Takeda spy and took as prize  \nhis Soshu Hiromasa Kaiken (tanto), a deed for which he was given an  \nOboshi kabuto, a yoroi and a saihai.\n\tAt the time of the attack on the Honno-ji, Iyeyasu needed to return  \nquickly to Mikawa. It was Hattori and his Iga men that provided the  \nbody guard on that trip. Iyeyasu rewarded him with Ishimi no mura,  \nwith an estimated annual rice production of 8000 koku. He took up  \nresidence within Edo castle where to this day the Hanzo gate honors  \nhis name. Hanzo died in Keicho gannen aged 55. The original Sainen-ji  \nwas located just outside the Hanzo-mon until it was moved to it&#39;s  \npresent location for the expansion of Edo Castle.\n\n\n\tThere is a picture of this yari in the catalog of the Nihon no Meiso  \nexhibition. If I get the chance I will try to scan it in and post it  \nin the photo albums, though I have to say it isn&#39;t much to look at...\n-t\n\n\n\n\n"
