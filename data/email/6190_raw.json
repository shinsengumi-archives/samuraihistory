It also gave me \nsome insights on the folks who claim to have a &quot;Japanese Samurai \nSword from World War Two.&quot;  According to Mr. Sinclair, 90% of Showa \nswords are, essentially, little more than mass-produced blades, \nwhich is a pity.  \n\nMatt\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot; \n&lt;tom.davidson@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Gabriel - \n&gt; \n&gt; The toledo sword site looks a bit too commercial for my liking - \nmarketing what &#39;looks \n&gt; good&#39; and will sell, rather than what is correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a one-time iaidoka, I am not enamoured of their products - by \nthe look of it there&#39;s \n&gt; more wrong than there&#39;s right.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suggest searching for &#39;nihonto&#39; rather than &#39;samurai sword&#39; \nor &#39;katana&#39; or the like, at least \n&gt; you might get to a somewhat knowledgeable site. There are others \nhere who know a hell \n&gt; of a lot more than I do, so if you have any specific questions, \nask away (but please, not \n&gt; about ninja straight swords, which are pure invention).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
