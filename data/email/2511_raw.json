Sir Montgomery and Napoleon were both good at\nusing the artillery after all. Personally, I can not\ncound too many commanders other than these two great\nmen in history as far as I am concerned with tactical\nand strategical ability.\n\n--- Lee Changsub &lt;knorr31@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sir, without being too acute in interpreting your\n&gt; &#39;literary&#39; expression, I do agree that it was one of\n&gt; turning points in the North Asian warfare.\n&gt; The only one point that I want make is that it could\n&gt; have been more complete if there were a distinction\n&gt; between a small firearm and a large firearm. Unlike\n&gt; their Europeans brothers, three North Asian\n&gt; countries\n&gt; did not learn to combine arquebus and cannons in\n&gt; proper ways until the modern times. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                        Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                         Changsub Lee\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- murphymurphyjohn@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; With the reliance on firearms by Kenshin and\n&gt; Takeda,\n&gt; &gt; I believe that \n&gt; &gt; Kawanakajima ought to be considered a Renaissance\n&gt; &gt; era battle.  Indeed,  I would submit \n&gt; &gt; that, although a middle point in the Age of the\n&gt; &gt; Country at War,  the \n&gt; &gt; introduction at Tanegashima in 1543 of Portuguese\n&gt; &gt; firearms ought to be considered the \n&gt; &gt; beginning of Modern War in Japan,  as the large\n&gt; use\n&gt; &gt; of cannon in Italy in 1494 \n&gt; &gt; by the French is often considered the beginning of\n&gt; &gt; the epoch of modern war in \n&gt; &gt; Europe.  I know Chinese firearms were there from\n&gt; &gt; approximately 1511 [pace \n&gt; &gt; Turnbull],  but they were not nearly as\n&gt; &gt; sophisticated as the Portuguese,  and the \n&gt; &gt; large contracts vetted for Oda Nobunaga after\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; introduction seems to bear \n&gt; &gt; out my point.  I hope Tony Bryant has some\n&gt; thoughts\n&gt; &gt; he can share here?  \n&gt; &gt; Regards,  Profmurf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Protect your identity with Yahoo!
