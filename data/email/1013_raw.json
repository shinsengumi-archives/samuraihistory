Tactically, it was a victory for\nthe Tokugawa, as they destroyed the force that was\nsent under Ikeda Shonyu around their lines.\nStrategically, it was a draw, as both Ieyasu and\nHideyoshi realized they had much more to gain by\nworking together than by fighting each other. \n\nNate\n\n--- squrpio_prince &lt;squrpio_prince@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hideyoshi has a battle with Tokugawa before he died\n&gt; and I don&#39;t know \n&gt; who won. Does anyone know who else was involved and\n&gt; who won the \n&gt; battle? Where was it at?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
