If you&#39;ve read my previous posts, I hope you&#39;ll \ngather that I have nothing against the guy personally, I just have \nissues with his work, but don&#39;t take my word for it, grab some of his \nbooks, and compare what he writes to the Japanese sources, as well as \nPapinot.  In one of his books he has a picture of something \nlike &quot;authors sketch of a calvalary charge&quot; or something like that, \nwhich is ACTUALLY A HAND-SKETCHED COPY of a picture from one of the \nRekishi Gunzo books! Of course he doesn&#39;t mention that fact in his \nbook, though.\n\nIn essence, it is the contention of myself and apparently some others \non this forum that Turnbull is either a poor researcher or a lazy \nresearcher, or at the very least doesn&#39;t actually use any of the \nJapanese sources he cites except in the most rudimentary way.  If you \nhave a copy of Turnbull&#39;s samurai warriors book and a copy of \nPapinot&#39;s book, the fact that Turnbull took heavily from it is \npainfully obvious even though he didn&#39;t cite it.  However he cites \nmany Japanese sources that contradict things he puts in his books.\nI don&#39;t consider these posts &#39;flames&#39; - I consider them legitimate \ncomplaints against his scholarship.\n\nI still want to know what this guy&#39;s doctorate is actually IN!!!! \nLike I said, if he is a doctor of journalism or economics, or \nsomething unrelated to Japanese history, I&#39;ll recant everything I&#39;ve \never said about him. If he has a legitimate doctorate in Japanese \nhistory, well.............\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;ggouveia312000&quot; &lt;ggouveia@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have not followed this discussion regarding Turnbull. Why are \n&gt; people flamming Turnbull? I find his work is excellent and quite \n&gt; usefull. My opinion is that his work is the best I have seen, I \nhave \n&gt; work from Bryant, Bottomley, Turnbull and some other author whose \n&gt; name I forget. Turnbull&#39;s work to me out of this groups is the most \n&gt; thorough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why the flaming??????? I don&#39;t want rumour I want facts on \nTurnbull. \n&gt; If someone is tarnishing a reputation based on rumor I do not want \nto \n&gt; hear about it. If there is evidence then I will listen.\n\n\n"
