I will have to check on that film. I am always int=\r\nerested in Japanese film, especially if it is relevant to my study. \n\nAlso,=\r\n thanks for mentioning that study. It may help depending on the content. My=\r\n research is actually on seppuku and the Edo Period, but, in the process, I=\r\n am comparing several examples ranging from the war chronicles to Yukio Mis=\r\nhima. I would be happy to share my work with anyone who is interested once =\r\nit is finished--as long as it isnt bashed too much ;)\n\nI am specifically lo=\r\noking for text resources other than the Hogen Monogatari. Hogen Monogatari =\r\nonly seems to cover Uno Chikahara briefly. This short passage contains a re=\r\nference to seppuku which is believed to be the first in the war chronicles.=\r\n I was hoping to find some information about this individual, but have come=\r\n up empty so far.\n\nJonathan P. Ellgen\n\nBarry Thomas &lt;warlord@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:                                  Jonathan, just an &quot;off the cuff&quot; th=\r\nought - is the Hogen Incident the basis \n of the film &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;  (&quot;Jig=\r\nokumon&quot;, 1953, directed by Teinosuke \n Kinugasa)???  The list seems to be a=\r\n little quiet at present so I&#39;ll be \n indulgent and ramble on a bit about t=\r\nhis film, one of my favourites.\n \n A thoroughly enjoyable movie, one review=\r\ner commenting &quot;Kinugasa&#39;s sublime \n control of color intensifies every emot=\r\nion in his Academy Award=AE-winning \n masterpiece, a classic 12th-century t=\r\nale about a warrior whose love \n dishonors a married woman. The screen is s=\r\nteeped in fiery reds for chaotic \n battle scenes, then blanketed in soothin=\r\ng images of white-kimonoed priests \n beside a calm blue sea. The exquisite =\r\ncompositions and charged performances \n of Kazuo Hasegawa and Machiko Kyo d=\r\nepict a culture dedicated to order, yet \n easily rocked by passion.&quot;.\n \n An=\r\nother reviwer \n http://www.amazon.com/Gate-Hell-Teinosuke-Kinugasa/dp/63030=\r\n73093 comments:\n \n In 1953, Teinosuke Kinugasa (1896-1982) directed and co-=\r\nadapted the \n historical play entitled &quot;Jigokumon&quot; (English transliteration=\r\n of the \n Japanese title), which was written by Kan Kikuchi (1888-1948). Th=\r\ne film&#39;s \n name (the same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of =\r\nHell&quot;, and \n was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes=\r\n place in \n 12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of =\r\na revolt. \n During the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal=\r\n palace in \n Kyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescue=\r\nd by a soldier \n named Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revol=\r\nt fails, Moritoh \n is told that he can have anything that he wants, and wha=\r\nt he wants is Lady \n Kesa to be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that=\r\n she is already \n married to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Ra=\r\nther than seek \n something different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed =\r\nwith Lady Kesa.\n Filmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the f=\r\nirst color films \n from Japan), the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exq=\r\nuisite. The story is \n by no means dated, though it does become somewhat pr=\r\nedictable. Still, it is \n both compelling and engaging and the acting is su=\r\nperb, especially Machiko \n Ky. Memorable scenes in the film include the con=\r\nfusion at the royal palace, \n Laky Kesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Mo=\r\nritoh meeting Lady Kesa and her \n aunt after the revolt, Moritoh given the =\r\nchoice of his heart&#39;s desire, the \n horse races, Moritoh at the home of Lad=\r\ny Kesa&#39;s aunt, and the ending scenes. \n The makeup used on Moritoh could ha=\r\nve been better.\n \n The film won several awards including an Oscar for Best =\r\nCostume Design, an \n Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film =\r\nand the prestigious \n Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Ov=\r\nerall, I rate &quot;Gate of \n Hell&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars. Hopefully, the film w=\r\nill be fully restored and \n released on DVD one day. I highly recommend the=\r\n film.\n \n Best regards,\n \n Barry Thomas.\n \n ----- Original Message ----- \n =\r\n\n From: &quot;jonathan ellgen&quot; &lt;jpellgen@...&gt;\n To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&gt;\n Sent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 9:28 AM\n Subject: Re: [samuraihi=\r\nstory]\n \n &gt;I am working on a section of my master&#39;s thesis dealing with the=\r\n Hogen \n &gt;Incident.
