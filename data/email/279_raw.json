Books like Shogunal Politics by\nKate Nakai, State and Diplomacy by Ronald Toby. These books do have there\nplace and I&#39;m not knocking them per se. The problem I have with the field of\nJapanese historiograpy is that there are few (very few) well written\nnarrative histories like the type done by say Robert Massie, Simon Schama,\nDavid McCollough, or Stephan Ambrose. While I*am*not a historian I do love a\ngood book on history. I don&#39;t shy away from books with citations and\nfootnotes as long as they are well written, that describe the period in well\nconstructed details, and with a human touch. I do shy away from long turpid\ndiscussions about the exact nomenclature of the shugo. Of course these type\nof books have been written in Japanese, and when I go to Maruzen or\nKinokuniya I drool over the amoont of material available that simply is not\navailable in English. However reading Japanese books is too much like\nstudying. Its really difficult taking a Kanji dictionary on the train with\nyou. Now I confess I am being lazy, having lived here for 7 years and still\nmy reading level is about 6th grade.I feel though that anybody who is\ninterested in Japanese history, interested say in the life of Takeda\nShingen, or daily life in the Nara period , or a good history of the\nNanbokucho period shouldn&#39;t have to spend a lifetime mastering the Japanese\nlanguage in order to do so. On the other hand there have been plenty of\nwonderful books on Russian history in english enough that one wouldn&#39;t have\nto master the Russian language to read about Ivan the Terrible. If this type\nof historical writing can be done in other feilds why not Japanese history?\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Anthony J.

I am\nalso\n&gt; &gt; curious about Jurgis Elisonas (AKA George Ellison) Wasn&#39;t he going to\nwrite\n&gt; &gt; a book about Nobunaga?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ummm.... &quot;plodding &#39;university&#39; book&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one of those.\n&gt;\n&gt; I assume you mean one of those boring things with citations and footnotes\nand\n&gt; references? I&#39;m sorry, those are the only books I take seriously.\n&gt;\n&gt; But then again, I *am* a historian, and read those for fun. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
