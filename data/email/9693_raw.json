I think that 1625 - 1640 \nwas a very interesting and turbulent period in Kyushu. Having spent the \nlast four years researching and writing (with Till Weber) about the \nShimabara Rebellion and the period leading up to it I would say that it \nwas a pivotal point in Japan&#39;s history. One of these days soon I will \nsend the manuscript off for publication. But in the meantime Shaun, I \nwould suggest you look at the Shimabara Rebellion [insurrection or \nwhatever you prefer to call it] and you will discover a wealth of \ninformation about the Daimyo in Kyushu at that time.\n\nBest wishes,\n\n             Rod Johnson\n\n\n\nshaundlcurry wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Kitsuno,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you again for your reply.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are quite right. Samurai record-keeping appears to be quite\n&gt; meticulous, and there appears to be a lot of information, albeit I\n&gt; can&#39;t seem to find it in &quot;summary&quot; form, or in a fashion that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t require a lot of filtering... and a lot of work...\n&gt;\n&gt; I think my &quot;turbulence&quot; statement was a relative one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"
