But however, fiction has inspired me to read and explore and even hear this arguments out. Because of the two sides here it makes history as a whole I guess that much more real. Hmm. In any event, I lived in Japan for almost 3yrs and tried to visit every musume and castle I could but didnt even know enough Nihongo to know that being a samurai was abolished. Isn&#39;t that something? Well most people here that have never been to Japan with out much historical studies get their based on historical facts from anime and various movies? Its what started me out. There is a saying i have read once and dont remember from where it came but it goes like this: To the novice all things seem posible; but to the expert not so much.\nWe have to start somewhere\n \nLove, Grace, and Peace\n\n&quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\nCurious, which points are these, the ones that you don&#39;t see as &quot;rational&quot;?\nHas anyone said that fictional works are the same as historical works? \n\nI know I certainly have not said that fictional works are the same as\nhistorical works. Nor have I claimed this. If it seems that I have, then I\napologize for the unclear nature of whatever statements I may have made that\nhave mistakenly implied this.  \n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Anthony Bryant\nSent: Friday, October 21, 2005 10:58 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?
