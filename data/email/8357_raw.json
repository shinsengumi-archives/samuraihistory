I believe that the\nstrategic concepts inherent in Yagyu Shinkage-ryu, the\nsword art practiced and chosen by the Shogunate as one\nof its official styles, guided them in their decision\nmaking. \n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; The Tokugawa regime was amazing. Probably the\n&gt; longest-surviving\n&gt; authoritarian regime that I can think of off-hand.\n&gt; It&#39;s interesting to study\n&gt; to find out about the nature of authoritarian\n&gt; regimes, especially ones as\n&gt; successful in its longetivity as this one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully there will be more discussion on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of Anthony Bryant\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 08, 2006 8:31 PM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Change of subject\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; A friend and I were recently having a debate over\n&gt; enduring results of \n&gt; &gt; the Ieyesu Tokugawa reign. My contention is that\n&gt; no other man has \n&gt; &gt; influenced the beauty and indeed personality of\n&gt; Japan more. His micro \n&gt; &gt; management of everything from the basic design of\n&gt; a farmhouse to the \n&gt; &gt; distance between road stations and his insistance\n&gt; that all warriors \n&gt; &gt; practice the peacful pastime of the arts is still\n&gt; felt in everyday \n&gt; &gt; Japan. My companion beleives that the Tokugawa\n&gt; Shuguns by shuting off \n&gt; &gt; Japan for 200 years created unrepairable damage to\n&gt; the Japanese \n&gt; &gt; society. I am interested in the thoughts of this\n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt; It may come as no surprise, but I think that the\n&gt; both of you are both right\n&gt; and wrong, and for a whole slew of reasons. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; Anthony J.
