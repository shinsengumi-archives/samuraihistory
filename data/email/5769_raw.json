Stating that everyone here has a passion for the subject and era(s) would be a gross understatement. I have been reading & researching Japanese history for the better part of my life and i am finally within a group where i feel i can converse openly, freely & most of all...continue to learn. Please pardon me for being overly ecstatic, but this forum is just truly what i have been looking for in a nutshell. I have recently returned from Okinawa, Japan...but luckily for me i am sure none of you will hold that against me (i hope that was funny to some, give me a little face...please) but have been over mainland Japan as well and there are not many places in Japan or Asia period that i have not traveled. On my own or through the U.S. Military. So i offer my modest thanks and praise for being able to exist within the forum...\n     Secondly; i agree with the statements of Mr. Wayland...to request for information one must truly want to seek the truth. As i am sure we all know, one of the staples of Bushido was that it was commonplace to seek constructive criticism from your peers...for as Tsunetomo said: &quot;If you judge and manage every affair while depending only on your small learning and wisdom...etc.&quot; The point is that you cannot ask a question with the intention of getting only the answer you desire.\n     Thirdly; i wanted to acquire some books or writings if possible explaining the history of the Yakuza as a sort of &quot;police force&quot; in their origination, i am not sure if this is correct, but i am really looking for a sort of timeline from their beginning and how they progressed and changed. Any assistance in this manner would be extremely grateful. Continued Blessings!\n\n\n\n\n\n --- On Wed 10/13, Nate Ledbetter &lt; ltdomer98@... &gt; wrote:\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter [mailto: ltdomer98@...]\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Wed, 13 Oct 2004 19:44:42 -0700 (PDT)\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai Inquiry\n\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;\n\n\n&lt;tt&gt;\nMy use of the phrase &quot;bad romance novel&quot; in no way,&lt;BR&gt;\nshape, or form, justified an attack on my person using&lt;BR&gt;\nfoul language. That is not the act of someone who&lt;BR&gt;\nwants answers. The impression is that this person read&lt;BR&gt;\nsomething somewhere, potentially fictional, and&lt;BR&gt;\nbelieves it to be real. Fine--no problem. To me, it&lt;BR&gt;\ndoesn&#39;t sound real. It certainly doesn&#39;t sound like&lt;BR&gt;\nanything I&#39;m familiar with, at least with no further&lt;BR&gt;\ninformation to draw from. However, I&#39;m fully willing&lt;BR&gt;\nto grant it may be a story based on some real events,&lt;BR&gt;\nand would be happy to help find what those events&lt;BR&gt;\nwere, if I could. I cannot, especially when told &quot;I&lt;BR&gt;\nknow more about this, but won&#39;t tell you.&quot; Please.&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\nIt is not the responsibility of anyone on this board&lt;BR&gt;\nto soothe egoes or confirm erroneous beliefs. You have&lt;BR&gt;\nthe right to incorrectly believe geisha existed in&lt;BR&gt;\n1600--you do not have the right to call people who&lt;BR&gt;\ntell you that you are incorrect and present facts&lt;BR&gt;\ndirty names. &lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\nMy reply may have been sardonic, but was not&lt;BR&gt;\noffensive. I didn&#39;t call anyone any names. As a&lt;BR&gt;\nsubordinate list moderator, I was well within my&lt;BR&gt;\nrights granted by Kitsuno to simply delete the email&lt;BR&gt;\nand ban the person from posting. I did not, as it was&lt;BR&gt;\nan attack directly on me--I chose not to act so I&lt;BR&gt;\ncould not be accused of acting out of malice. Kitsuno&lt;BR&gt;\ncan decide to ban or not ban, delete or not delete. &lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\nIf you want information, this is a great place to be.&lt;BR&gt;\nIf you want affirmation, go see a therapist. &lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n--- Kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; It really is not an issue of scholarship.� First he&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; asks a vague &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; question, which is fine. but he also later mentions&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; that he has more &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; information that he then refuses to release, which&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; tells me he isnt &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; very interested in getting information.� The&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; response that offended &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; him seemed pretty benign to me, but that is just my&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; humble opinion.� &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Regardless, it makes sense to me that if you ask a&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; question, you try &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; to include as much information as possible, which he&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; apparently &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; didnt do if he is now bragging about having other&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; information.� &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, these groups are pretty easy, but not always&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; a one way &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; street. Just because you ask for someone to do your&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; homework for you &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; doesnt mean they will do it willingly. People tend&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; to want a reason &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; to do you work for you. That was part of what I was&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; trying to say.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@i...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Brothers,&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regardless of your emotional state, this:&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ...&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is brutally vague in the extreme.� If you cant&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; give a single&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; detail more on this, or even where you found it,&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; I can&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee that no one will be able to help&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; you...&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, granted the original presentation was far&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; from scholarly, &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; but surely&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not the only one to (a) find it intriguing and&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; (b) find a &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; little bell&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ringing in my head, not from the Sengoku Jidai but&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; from mid-Edo.� &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Granted&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the riposte from our original questioner was a far&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; from measured &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; response,&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but the replies from Dear List Owner and others&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; whose name/s &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; escape me&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; hardly encourages anyone to ask any question at&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; all, no matter how &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; seemingly&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not PC for the eminent scholars on this list. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Reminds of the &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; lampoons I&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have got...� So, why do I persist with this list? &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Because I love &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; subject matter and see it as an important adjunct&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; to my sword &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; studies and&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; collecting, and because the awesome knowledge of&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; practitioners in &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; the field&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; just takes my breath away.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can&#39;t we be a little less uptight on this list??&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Barry Thomas&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Melbourne, Australia - just over the road from&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Jim Breen&#39;s campus)&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n����� ����� &lt;BR&gt;\n_______________________________&lt;BR&gt;\nDo you Yahoo!?&lt;BR&gt;\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://vote.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;http://vote.yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;tt&gt;\n---&lt;BR&gt;\nSamurai Archives: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samurai-archives.com&quot;&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\nSamurai Archives store: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&quot;&gt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n---&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- |**|begin egp html banner|**| --&gt;\n\n&lt;table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2&gt;\n&lt;tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC&gt;\n&lt;td align=center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot; color=#003399&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yahoo!
