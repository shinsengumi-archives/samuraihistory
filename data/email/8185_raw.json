Time and again, they are not so much reinvented=\r\n as recycled,\nusing potent but often semi-mythical symbols from a potpourri=\r\n of\nfavorite bygone eras. In the end, they tell us more about the\nforeigner=\r\ns who have dredged them up than about anything genuinely\nJapanese.\n\nAs with=\r\n the samurai, in whose image of stoic fearlessness many Western\nmen see a k=\r\nind of quiet, macho ideal, the geisha is stood on a\npedestal as the acme of=\r\n an artful and exquisite femininity. She is, in\nthis view, the embodiment o=\r\nf genteel, refined expression.\n\nThis notion of the geisha has been rehashed=\r\n in several works of\nfiction and non-fiction in recent years, the most succ=\r\nessful being\nArthur Golden&#39;s mega-bestseller, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot; The fi=\r\nlm\nversion of the novel, directed by Rob Marshall, opened on Dec. 10 in\nJap=\r\nan (under the title &quot;Sayuri&quot;) and some two weeks later in the\nUnited States=\r\n. This coming week will see its release in Britain.\n\n&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; =\r\nhas been written up on these pages in an\nexcellently argued and incisive fi=\r\nlm review by Kaori Shoji (&quot;Welcome\nto Kyoto, California,&quot; Dec. 15, 2005). B=\r\nut this film as a phenomenon\nof misunderstanding and misinformation bears f=\r\nurther examination.\n\nAs its Web site tells us, the movie is &quot;set in a myste=\r\nrious and exotic\nworld&quot; of geisha houses before, during and immediately aft=\r\ner World War\nII. It is a fairytale take on what was at best a demeaning and=\r\n\nsoul-destroying institution. Yet among the many popular\nmisrepresentations=\r\n of Japanese reality since the country came out of\nits international isolat=\r\nion 150 years ago -- from &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;\nto &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; -- this =\r\nis one of the most blatantly pernicious.\n\nA chance encounter\nIn short, its =\r\nstoryline focuses on a determined and sympathetic little\ngirl named Chiyo (=\r\nlater Sayuri) who is sold by her destitute parents\ninto the okiyacho (red-l=\r\night district). As a servant-girl she is\nabused by the madam, as well as by=\r\n the cruel geisha in the house. A\nchance encounter on a bridge with a kindl=\r\ny entrepreneur, who gives\nChiyo his handkerchief, leads her on a lifelong p=\r\nursuit to gain the\nstatus necessary to approach this generous gentleman onc=\r\ne again.\n\nTwo key themes of prewar Japanese life are whitewashed in &quot;Memoir=\r\ns of\na Geisha.&quot;\n\nFirst, the entire system of recruiting young girls for wor=\r\nk in the\nokiyacho was one of institutionalized slavery. While it is true, a=\r\ns\nthe film points out on a number of occasions, that the elite among the\nge=\r\nisha were not prostitutes (though many, as the favorites of wealthy\npatrons=\r\n, were kept women), the institution lent an aura of cultural\nlegitimacy to =\r\nthe enslavement of hundreds of thousands of girls and\nwomen who were forced=\r\n into the sex trade in the major cities and\nvirtually every provincial town=\r\n in arch-sexist traditional Japan.\n\nSayuri&#39;s enemies are other women, who s=\r\nhow only a sadistic\nvindictiveness toward her. Even her patroness, Mameha, =\r\nsupports her\nbecause a wealthy man has paid her to do so. The two male prot=\r\nagonists\nare positive characters, depicted as tender, if sometimes gruff or=\r\n\naloof, gentlemen.\n\nImagine a story set in United States in the pre-Civil W=\r\nar South in\nwhich the slaves are portrayed as locked in internecine in-figh=\r\nting as\none of them, the most innocent, longs to be rescued by a Prince\nCha=\r\nrming in the guise of a noble white plantation owner. Would there\nbe anythi=\r\nng mysterious and exotic about the everyday life of the\nslaves? This is ana=\r\nlogous to what &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot; transposed to\n20th-century Japan, is =\r\ndoing.\n\nThe second issue arises from a gross omission. The generous\nentrepr=\r\neneur, known as The Chairman, is beholden to his\ncomrade-in-arms, Nobu. The=\r\n latter&#39;s face has been disfigured in\nbattle. Nobu apparently saved The Cha=\r\nirman&#39;s life when they were\nfighting for the Imperial cause in Manchuria. I=\r\nn fact &quot;Memoirs of a\nGeisha&quot; skirts the issue of war responsibility entirel=\r\ny, save for a\nfew voice-over broadcasts of Hitler&#39;s progress through a dist=\r\nant Europe.\n\nA vicious military occupation\nHowever, the Japanese military e=\r\nstablishment was the major customer of\nthe okiyacho around Japan, and tens =\r\nof thousands of women were forced\nto be so-called comfort women by and for =\r\nthe Japanese military, having\nto endure mass rape in Japan and its far-flun=\r\ng colonies for the glory\nof the empire.\n\nNowhere in the film is there menti=\r\non of the fact that the two\nadmirable gentlemen were getting rich thanks to=\r\n a vicious military\noccupation of continental Asia.\n\nAfter the war, most of=\r\n the geisha, of every rank, were forced by the\nJapanese police into the ser=\r\nvice of Allied Occupation soldiers. The\nonly thing that had changed was the=\r\n color of the uniform flung hastily\nonto the tatami.\n\nThe reasons for Weste=\r\nrners choosing mystery over reality have varied\nsince Japan&#39;s abandonment o=\r\nf the policy of national isolation.\n\nIn the Meiji Era (1868-1912), the West=\r\n, for the most part, wanted to\nkeep Japan quaint, picturesque -- and on its=\r\n knees. Virtually all\nWesterners allied themselves with the most reactionar=\r\ny social\ninstitutions and their propagators, seeing that as a sure way to\na=\r\nrrest Japan&#39;s entry into the West&#39;s exclusive club of the Great Powers.\n\nBu=\r\nt what obliges film producers like Steven Spielberg to spin a sick\nlittle t=\r\nale like &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; now that Japan is in many\nrespects a full-fl=\r\nedged member of the Western club? Spielberg, who in\nhis movies generally de=\r\nals with bizarre fantasies and heroic\nhistorical figures, seems to have ina=\r\ndvertently mixed the two together\nin this film.\n\nWhatever the filmmakers&#39; m=\r\notive in recycling an antiquated\nfabrication, there was nothing mysterious =\r\nor exotic about the world of\nthe okiyacho to those who were chained to its =\r\nwalls. By producing this\nvisual and moral euphemism, its creators have not =\r\nonly prettified and\ndistorted what was a ruthless institution akin to the m=\r\nodern\ntrafficking of women; they have also raised yet another opaque screen=\r\n\nin front of what Japan once was -- and what it is today.\n\nThe Japan Times:=\r\n Jan. 8, 2006\n(C) All rights reserved\n\n\n\n\n"
