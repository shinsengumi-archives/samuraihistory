Another TV crew followed Knight and his students \n&gt;&gt; for the rest of their trip to document &quot;the American samurai.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;You know, reading this article it seems to me that this Bradley Knight \n&gt;is a pretty normal martial artist without too much weird ideas in his \n&gt;head, but the reporter could really use a reality check.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m posting this, but from the subject line, it seems \n&gt;as if this article was posted here to sort of mock the martial artist \n&gt;that&#39;s being written about. I just feel that would be sort of unfair to \n&gt;him since most of the samurai adoration seems to be coming from the man \n&gt;who wrote the article, ie. Jerry Greene.\n&gt;\n&gt;-- \n&gt;Falc\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n__________________________________________________________________\nSwitch to Netscape Internet Service.\nAs low as $9.95 a month -- Sign up today at http://isp.netscape.com/register\n\nNetscape.
