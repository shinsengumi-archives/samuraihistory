Being high carbon won&#39;t\n&gt; make a blade brittle, its the tempering that does\n&gt; that. Whenever I need studs for my milling machine I\n&gt; always use drill rod, being about a 3rd or more\n&gt; stronger than mild steel in its untempered state.\n&gt; I&#39;m away from my Machinery&#39;s Handbook so I can&#39;t\n&gt; give exact numbers!\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
