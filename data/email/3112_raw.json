The cable was suspended and \n&gt;allowed to hang freely.  This was one of the tests he used to test some of his \n&gt;blades.  So maybe it is possible to cut the barrel of a gun with a good downward \n&gt;force swing of a Katana.  This is just something that I read and as of right \n&gt;now I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on Samurai, but I am reading as much as I can \n&gt;afford to buy.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhich magazine? Once again my friends and I have read heavily on WW2 \nhistory and never found any examples of this. It might be possible, but \nI kind of doubt it.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"
