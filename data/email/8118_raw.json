Just real glad ur talking about ebook - its importance to us... \nFor me=\r\n, this has of real value. At this age of computers, it becomes \nvery conven=\r\nient for us to just view or read whatever we wish to thru \nthe monitor... n=\r\no need to bring or take with us hardcopies of \nanything. In our offices, in=\r\n our homes, or wherever pc is available, \nespecially laptops this time have=\r\n become so part of us... accessing \neach word, each picture, each important=\r\n info, each lesson... becomes \nso easy... Have a wonderful day!\n\nBy the way=\r\n, could anyone, perhaps, care to share me such ebook? Thanks!\n\n\nCesar\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"
