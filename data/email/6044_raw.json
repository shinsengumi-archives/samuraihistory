Please=\r\n take the time to read it as I have gone to a lot of trouble to get it fini=\r\nshed. Please enjoy.\n \nThe JKA of which I belong to their branch in the UK t=\r\nhe JKAE has long had an association with the old samurai traits. Master Fun=\r\nakoshi&#39;s father was a Samurai from a long family of Samurai and so his styl=\r\ne incorporated these ideals. As a young boy he studied under his grandfathe=\r\nr in the Chinese classics and the Japanese Classics. He studied Taoism, Con=\r\nfucianism as well as Zen and undoutbably Bushido. This all formulated into =\r\nthe Shotokan style of Karate, in 1949 the JKA was born from him and master =\r\nNakayama and other promonent masters such as Taiji Kase, Kanazawa and other=\r\ns besides. The JKA and Master Funakoshi developed the Dojo Kun and the 20 P=\r\nrecepts both of which have a strong influence from Bushido.\nThe following i=\r\ns an extract from the JKA website directly;\n&quot;True karate is based on Bushid=\r\no. In true karate, the body, mind and\nspirit=97the whole person=97must be d=\r\neveloped simultaneously. Through kihon, kumite and kata we learn to control=\r\n our movements. But more im-\nportantly, we learn to give up con-\ntrol too. =\r\nWe can perform the tech-\nniques without thinking about them, and remain foc=\r\nused without having\nto concentrate on any one thing. In essence, the body r=\r\nemembers how\nto move and the mind remembers\nhow to be still.\n\nThis harmonio=\r\nus unity of mind and body is intensely powerful. Even the greatest physical=\r\n strength and skill are no match for the power of wholeness.\n\nThe result of=\r\n true karate is natural, effortless action, and the confidence, humility, o=\r\npenness and peace only possible through perfect unity of mind and body. Thi=\r\ns is the core teaching of Zen, the basis of Bushido, and the  of the JKA=92=\r\ns karate philosophy&quot;\nThis is evident in many texts. In the western world we=\r\n expect thing to be there infront of us, however with most eastern philosop=\r\nhy and in particular Ja[anese Zen philosophy it is hiden and can only be re=\r\nvealed through intensive study of the chosen art. Some similarities are cle=\r\nar to see, such as undying discipline and concentration. Similarties have b=\r\neen noticed by myself between Karate and Iaido the philosophies and the inf=\r\nluences therein. I will follow uo with another extract from JKA website;\n  =\r\n\n&quot;Bushido has been the samurai code of conduct in Japan for centuries. Base=\r\nd firmly on the teachings of Zen, Bushido was intended to help the samurai =\r\nmaster their nature and understand their minds and the uni-\nverse through d=\r\nirect experience=97as well as through fostering strength, self-control and =\r\nwisdom.\n\nBushido is based on seven essential principles:\n\n \n\n1.\n\n\n\nseigi : =\r\nThe right decision and rectitude\n\n2.\n\n\n\nyuki : Bravery and heroism\n\n3.\n\n\n\nj=\r\nin: Compassion and benevolence to all\n\n4.\n\n\n\nreigi : Courtesy and right act=\r\nion\n\n5.\n\n\n\nmakoto: Truthfulness and utter sincerity\n\n6.\n\n\n\nmeiyo: Honor and=\r\n glory\n\n7.\n\n\n\nchugi: Devotion and loyalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMartial spirit and cou=\r\nrage were, of course, essential aspects of Bushido. But for the samurai, Bu=\r\nshido&#39;s highest goal was complete virtue in thought and action. Each samura=\r\ni followed a carefully-designed regimen of polite ceremony and etiquette in=\r\ntended to promote such virtue. With its emphasis on prescribed form, Bushid=\r\no helped the samurai harmonize mind with body, enabling them to maintain a =\r\ncertain calmness, or heijoshin (literally, &quot;ordinary everyday mind&quot;), even =\r\nin the face of hardship. Sincerity, kindness, honesty, filial piety and hon=\r\nor all formed part of the core of Bushido. And they were the seed from whic=\r\nh the karate tradition grew. These attributes, and the wisdom, understandin=\r\ng and peaceful strength they promote, are some of karate&#39;s greatest benefit=\r\ns. They are also among Japan&#39;s greatest gifts to the world.&quot;\n\nSo this is fr=\r\nom the experts themselves so why do you argue?\n\nThe last extract from JKA n=\r\now as I know you must be getting bored; These are the 20 Precepts as laid d=\r\nown by Funakoshi sensei.\n\n\n&quot;1.  \nNever forget: karate begins with rei and e=\r\nnds with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate b=\r\ny bowing)2.There is no first attack in karate 3.Karate supports righteousne=\r\nss4.First understand yourself, then understand others5.The art of developin=\r\ng the mind is more important than the art of applying technique6.The mind n=\r\needs to be freed7.Trouble is born of negligence8.Do not think karate belong=\r\ns only in the dojo9.Karate training requires a lifetime10.Transform everyth=\r\ning into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness12.Genuine karate is like ho=\r\nt water; it cools down if you do not keep on heating it12.Do not think of w=\r\ninning; you must think of not losing13.Transform yourself according to the =\r\nopponent14.The outcome of the fight depends on one&#39;s control15.Imagine one&#39;=\r\ns arms and legs as swords16.Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a=\r\n million enemies17.Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural po=\r\nsitions18.Do the kata correctly; the real fight is a\n different matter19.Do=\r\n not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body an=\r\nd the speed of the technique20.  \nAlways be good at the application of ever=\r\nything that you have learned.&quot;\n\nSensei Ohta , head of JKAE has been disgust=\r\ned by the reaction of some people to the fact that Karate is related to Bus=\r\nhido and the Samurai. He says that the influence of Bushido is in every Jap=\r\nanese art as is Zen.\n\nWell part 2 shall be coming next week hope you enjoy\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nMoving house?
