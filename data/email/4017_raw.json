Akechi Mitsuhide wouldn&#39;t have been \n  thought so poor had he actually succeeded in becoming Shogun (his \n  alliances not fallen apart, the mori finding out about nobunaga&#39;s \n  death before hideyoshi). Don&#39;t kid yourself into think he really did \n  anything special. Just dumb.\n  The daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai \n  really believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to see \n  that. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the \n  peacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.\n  You claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its true \n  that confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far \n  from a system of honor, especially what you&#39;re thinking about. Think \n  about it; if you&#39;re a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what \n  little time you have off, what room is there for the &quot;honor&quot; that \n  you think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do \n  anything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure preaches \n  about may be true... but that wasn&#39;t really out of a sense of honor.\n\n  I don&#39;t recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the noble \n  ones. I doubt an ashigaru wielding a spear was shouting, &quot;I am so-\n  and-so, from so-and-so village! Come get some!&quot;\n\n  And sorry about the snappy remarks... I&#39;m just SICK of all these \n  kids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for every \n  age, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his actions. \n  Only famous for who he killed and how dumb he was in doing it.\n\n\n  --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dave Jackson \n  &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; To Kyle Segall:\n  &gt; \n  &gt; What I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see \n  below) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. \n  The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording \n  it in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai \n  class placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and \n  their familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act \n  against Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name \n  of his family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and \n  your father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from \n  a bad family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your \n  pedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has \n  dozens of acounts. I ain&#39;t no kid, I have read about this subject \n  for many years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with \n  me fine but a little manners on your part would be nice.\n  &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;   From: Kyle Segall \n  &gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 8:56 PM\n  &gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Holy crap kid, do some freaking research.
