Nobunaga and Hideyoshi castles were perfect \nexample of the artistic abundance and extravagance of the period.\n\nBye,\nCepo, Honolulu.\n\nPS=I have a couple of very nice shots of Hideyoshi&#39;s castle in Momoyama \n(Fushimi), is there any way I can share them with you? It will be \nfinally re-opened to the public in 2005. &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
