What I have \nproblems with\n&gt; is\n&gt; modern metaphysical claptrap.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; G:  This is the worst-aimed thrust I&#39;ve ever seen out of you, \nTony, so I\n&gt; almost have to assume that certain prejudices (prejudices which \ncrop up\n&gt; fairly routinely, alas, among many members of your mystery cult) \nhave dimmed\n&gt; the usual clarity of your thinking.  The principles of Shinto, \neven in the\n&gt; speculative form discussed by me on this forum, are scarcely \nmodern.  Now as\n&gt; it happens (though it may come as something of a surprise to you), \nI never\n&gt; wanted to see this list become a comparative theology forum, and \n(though it\n&gt; may come as another surprise) I am as heartily tired of this \nsubject as you\n&gt; appear to be.\n&gt;            But insulting somebody&#39;s faith isn&#39;t the way to put an \nend to\n&gt; such a discussion.  Consider how you&#39;d react if I described your \nchurch as\n&gt; modern metaphysical claptrap:  Eastern Orthodox, I believe you \nsaid (and you\n&gt; brought it up in a context far more distantly related to the \nlist&#39;s topic, I\n&gt; might add, than was mine when I brought it up).  Now I could \ncertainly make\n&gt; a case for any Christian sect falling into the category of modern\n&gt; metaphysics, while as to claptrap... well, only if I chose to be \nso rude.\n&gt; Because after all, one man&#39;s metaphysics is another man&#39;s \ntheology:  and\n&gt; which one is which, of course, is entirely a matter of belief and\n&gt; perspective.\n&gt;           Please recall that I only entered this discussion, Tony, \nwhen\n&gt; someone ridiculed a principle of my beliefs, to wit the old idea \nthat swords\n&gt; may have spirits.  So in the process of discussing that point, some\n&gt; explication of those beliefs became necessary (as it seemed to me) \nin order\n&gt; for my points to be clearer... and also to promote the sort of \ndialogue that\n&gt; can take place among folks who&#39;re capable of civil disagreement on \nmatters\n&gt; of faith.  I think this intellectual community should be capable \nof that\n&gt; courtesy.  This is particularly important, as I see it, given the\n&gt; theological diversity that can be seen across the span of samurai \nhistory.\n&gt; (You should be more aware of that than I.)  It seems to me it \nwould promote\n&gt; healthier dialogues if, for example, the role of Christianity \namong the\n&gt; samurai (a subject of some interest to me, in fact) could be \nbrought up\n&gt; without Christians on the list feeling that their faith is going \nto be\n&gt; subjected to insults by those who hold with other, in some cases \nolder,\n&gt; religions.\n&gt;           Because ideas relating to Shinto traditions, and even \nthe idea of\n&gt; comparing these traditions to other world religious traditions, or \nfor that\n&gt; matter to personal experiences, is only modern metaphysical \nclaptrap if the\n&gt; original traditions are metaphysical claptrap. And of course, that \ncan be\n&gt; said about any man&#39;s religion.\n&gt;           Tony, I think you are capable of criticising my views \nmore\n&gt; rationally, more politely, and more effectively than this.  And if \nwhat you\n&gt; really want is an end to this subject, you can be certain you&#39;ll \nachieve\n&gt; that goal more effectively through courtesy or silence than \nthrough a petty,\n&gt; ill-calculated insult like this one.  I deeply resent needing to \ndefend my\n&gt; beliefs - whatever you may think of them - against such an insult:\n&gt; especially in what is supposed to be civilised company, and most \nespecially\n&gt; from the most rarified intellectual stratum of the group.  It&#39;s \nunworthy of\n&gt; you.  If you can offer some kind of rational support for your \ndisagreements,\n&gt; and can manage to be polite about it, that&#39;s another matter.  Then \nwe can\n&gt; discuss theology (off-list, for the gods&#39; sake!) as long as you \nplease.  But\n&gt; you&#39;ve crossed a boundary here that no one on the list should have \nto take.\n&gt;           In honour,\n&gt;                   Gereg\n\n\n\n\n"
