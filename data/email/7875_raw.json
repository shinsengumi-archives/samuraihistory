Anyway. First of all to say that the\nhistory of christianity in the samurai period begins\nwith the arrival of Saint Francis Xavier to Kagoshima\nat 1548, until the banning of christianity by Tokugawa\nat 1612. Only 70 years. The first daimyo to be\nconverted was Omura Sumitada, but before this one,\nother daimyos had granted privileges to the catholic\nchurch, if by nothing else, to get advantages in the\ncommerce with Portugal. Ouchi is a clear example of\nthat, the ever very merchantilistic ouchis.\nOther daimyos received baptism, I think that all from\njesuits hands. Their major expansion was before the\nSekigahara Battle. The christian daimyos was a strong\nforce in the council that ruled the country after\nHideyoshi`s death.\nWell, other people could say more thing... \n\nI had been working in an article about history of the\ncatholic church in Japan, if you are interested,\nalthough it is in spanish.\n\n--- samuraib8 &lt;samuraib8@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I am at a loss and I hope you can help.
