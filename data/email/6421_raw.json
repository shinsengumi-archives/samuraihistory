They are famous for there kusarigama and\nchigiriki and somebranches have Ryofundo\n(Mankrikigusari) \n\nToda Ha Buko Ryu which is most famous as a naginata\nryu but also has Kusarigama\n\nMasaki Ryu which is credited with creating the\nmanrikigusari.\n\nif you want more info on these ryu then I suggest you\nstart at this site www.koryu.com\n\nPaul\n\n--- Andrew Benton &lt;spearweasel@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nI have a GURPS Sengoku campaign starting up in Spring,\n2005.

I know that the\nsamurai used a great \nmany different weapons over different periods, but\nchain weapons seem \neither to be restricted to ninja/shinobi or simply\nlater period, Edo-\nera creations. \n\nSo, my question is this: Circa 1550, what options\nwould such a \nsamurai have available to him?\n\nRespectfully, \n\nAndrew Benton\nhttp://www.spearweasel.com\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
