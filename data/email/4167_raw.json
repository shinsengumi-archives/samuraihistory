Most \n&gt;great families had three mon, some more, some shared by many other \n&gt;families. To say for sure you would need to see three mon in \n&gt;combination that pointed to one family, then you have the problem of \n\nTom,\nI&#39;ve begun to get interested myself in the subject of kamon and \nthis is a fascinating point for me.\n\nI do know that people (and families) tended to have more than one \nkamon, especially in those cases where kamon were given as presents \nfrom some more prestigious family/person.\n\nBut I&#39;ve not yet run across the &quot;three mon in combination&quot; phenomenon. \nCan you say a little more about this? What would be an example of a \nfamily that had three kamon that were used in combination?\n\nThanks!\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
