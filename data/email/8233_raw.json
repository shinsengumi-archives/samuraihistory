I am a graduate school student at\n&gt;California State University (CSUDH). My graduate research/thesis is on\n&gt;the topic of seppuku. I did about 2 years of research on the topic\n&gt;both here and in Japan. However, my advisor really doesnt like my\n&gt;ideas. I need something more ground-breaking to really make this a\n&gt;good project. It is a difficult subject to develope new ideas around.\n&gt;I am moving back to Japan in March, so it would be nice to get some\n&gt;momentum before I leave. I am just wondering if anyone has any\n&gt;innovative ideas on this topic. My   original plan was to show that\n&gt;the spirit of bushido is embodied in the practice of seppuku even to\n&gt;modern times (ex. Yukio Mishima).\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for reading and God Bless.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jpellgen@...\n&gt;Jpellgen@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n\n"
