The work consists of over 600 monochrome prints (aprox A4\n&gt; size) depicting the life of Hideyoshi with the print caption translated\ninto\n&gt; English. You should be able to obtain this through a local library.\n\nRod, do you need hard copies or would web links to good graphics be okay?\n\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
