Yes, \nbasically..It and the storyline that it follows do have parrallels in actual \nevents and people involved in those events. Ieyasu Tokugawa was the character \nchosen for the basis of the &#39;Toranaga&#39; character. And Blackthorne was loosely \nbased on the story of the english sailor Will Adams, who was likewise \nstranded in Japan around the end of the Sengoku Jidai and was &#39;adopted&#39; into \nthe Samurai world in a very similar way to that of Blackthorne.\n Indeed, I heard that when finally Adams was fully &#39;released&#39; (He was not a \ncaptive but was held indefinately for the &#39;use&#39; of the Tokugawa house who saw \nhim as a possible way to forge a trade agreement that was not aligned with \nthe Religious ideals of the Portuguese and Spanish traders.) And a boat was \nsent to bring to home he actually refused to leave Japan and settled into a \npart of Tokyo (Edo then..) that I believe is still called Anjin-cho in his \nhonour!\n The book follows the same basic line of history as the actual events and the \nnames are changed to avoid any problems with the story..It plays out well \nthough and can offer the reader an excellent way &#39;in&#39; to the world of the \nSamurai.\nEnjoy the read!\n Abayo..\nBen Sharples.\n\n"
