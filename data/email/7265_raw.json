Shin Koyamada co-stars as \nKatsumoto=\r\n&#39;s son, Nobutada, a skilled young samurai who takes an \nimmediate liking to=\r\n Algren and teaches him the ways of Japan.\nCatching up with the two stars a=\r\nt the US Premiere of &quot;The Last \nSamurai,&quot; I had an opportunity to ask each =\r\nabout their work on this \nbig budget American film.\n\nKEN WATANABE (&#39;Katsumo=\r\nto&#39;):\n\nHow difficult was the language barrier when you were working?\nAt fir=\r\nst it was so difficult. The dialogue [took much] practice, and \n[much] prac=\r\ntice of pronunciation. \n\nI understood the meaning, so it was it was very co=\r\nmfortable. But \nconversation, I want to more deep feeling and more deep sto=\r\nries. I \nwant to talk with Ed [Zwick] and Tom [Cruise] and it&#39;s so difficul=\r\nt. \nIt was step by step.\nDid you have a translator on the set when you were=\r\n working?\nYes. In very sensitive scenes, I had to have correct meaning. I u=\r\nsed \na translator to understand and act.\n\nWhat was your most difficult scen=\r\ne to film?\nThe cherry blossoms. Three days of shooting and oh my God! It&#39;s =\r\na \nterrible schedule.\n\nSHIN KOYAMADA (&#39;Nobutada&#39;):\n\nCan you tell me a littl=\r\ne about your role in &quot;The Last Samurai?&quot;\nI play the young samurai Nobutada =\r\nwho befriends captured American \nsoldier, played by Tom Cruise. My father, =\r\nthe leader samurai, \nadvises me to teach Tom&#39;s character in the Japanese wa=\r\ny =96 Japanese \nculture and Japanese language.\n\nYour character&#39;s also an ex=\r\npert with bow and arrows. Did you train \nor were you already familiar with =\r\narchery?\nI had to spend most of my time training Japanese archery and \nhors=\r\neback riding since the movie was starting. I even paid to \npractice on my d=\r\nays off (laughing).\n\nHow difficult was it to learn the bow?\nJapanese archer=\r\ny is not actually a sport. Martial arts, it is kind \nof like mediation. So =\r\nyou had to learn mentally and it took me \nawhile to understand Japanese arc=\r\nhery itself. \n\nWhat do you think about the way the samurai lifestyle is por=\r\ntrayed?\nThis is THE movie where you can learn about samurai (laughing).\n\nYo=\r\nu had a lot of action in this movie. What was the most difficult \nstunt for=\r\n you to do?\nI had to shoot the arrows on horseback. It takes usually 10 yea=\r\nrs to \ndo that. I had to it for seven months to learn it. I killed myself \n=\r\nlearning [so as] not to be embarrassed to show Japanese people, \nrespectful=\r\nly.\n\nhttp://movies.about.com/cs/thelastsamurai/a/smkw120103.htm\n\n\n\n\n"
