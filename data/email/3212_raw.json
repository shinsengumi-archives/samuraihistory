Do you know who came up\nthis? I couldn&#39;t find it on the site. Interesting that\nthe ~no suke and ~ no kami titles seemed to rank below\nTaisho and so forth. Maybe I&#39;m just thinking in terms\nof landed titles (which by that point they were not)\nbut it seemed to me that you would have to be a taisho\nbefore you could gain enough prestige before you got a\ntitle like that. \n\nnate\n\n--- Kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; This site puts the rank in heirarchy, and the links\n&gt; along the \n&gt; lefthand side break them down further and give the\n&gt; readings and \n&gt; explanations:\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Suzuran/7123/hyou.html\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks like these are all more or less\n&gt; Kamakura-era ranks (or at \n&gt; least pre-sengoku) and at one point were actually\n&gt; associated with \n&gt; concrete positions. By the time the Sengoku came\n&gt; around, I think they \n&gt; were more or less empty titles.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;muds_theaz&quot;\n&gt; &lt;muds_theaz@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi there,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently researching The Sengoku period. When\n&gt; searching around \n&gt; &gt; on the web, or reading through books I see mention\n&gt; of court titles \n&gt; &gt; such as Gyobusho (court minister), and ranks such\n&gt; as vassals and \n&gt; &gt; retainers. However, I&#39;m finding it very difficult\n&gt; to actually find \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; layout of the ranks in these sorts of hierarchies\n&gt; and what came \n&gt; above \n&gt; &gt; them, below them. Such as: The Daimyo, below him\n&gt; he had vassals \n&gt; (how \n&gt; &gt; did he choose who were to be his vassals?) and\n&gt; what is the \n&gt; difference \n&gt; &gt; between a Vassal and a Retainer? Ideally I&#39;d like\n&gt; to find out what \n&gt; &gt; the ranking system was for both the court and the\n&gt; countries \n&gt; military \n&gt; &gt; was (not just the Daimyos). And, even better, the\n&gt; Imperial Guards.\n&gt; &gt; Also, does anyone know if this hierarchy changed\n&gt; when Yoritomo \n&gt; began \n&gt; &gt; the trend of Shogun leaders rather then Royal\n&gt; heads of state?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
