At \nleast that is how I understand it.  The EBAY FAQ should tell you \nexactly how it works.  I&#39;ve never created a reserve auction, but I&#39;ve \nbid in them before.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Gill&quot; &lt;Steve@c...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Except the Ebay systems won&#39;t allow me to raise my own bid unless \nthere&#39;s a\n&gt; bid to go against, all I can raise is my maximum bid, not my \ncurrent bid. It\n&gt; does come up with a rather fancy message telling me that I haven&#39;t \nreached\n&gt; the reserve yet and should try raising my maximum bid - which has \nno effect\n&gt; whatsoever.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Kitsuno\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s correct, that&#39;s how it works.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mackyukuk&quot; \n&lt;mike.macky@b...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Steve, I may be wrong but as I understand it, you don&#39;t need\n&gt; &gt; anyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; else to bid against - you increase your own bid until you reach\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reserve, or your own limit if that comes first.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reserve was set at the price below which I would not sell, \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting price is just that, it&#39;s there to attract some bids - \nset\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too high and you scare people off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may try these books again on Ebay in a few weeks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
