If you define the word &quot;samurai&quot; as &quot;one \nwho follows bushido&quot; (albeit a misnomer) than theoretically if you \nthink you &#39;follow bushido&#39; enough, then *pow* you are a samurai by \nyour own (incorrect) definition.  However if your definition \nof &quot;samurai&quot; is something along the lines of this:\n\nsamurai\n&#92;Sa&quot;mu*rai`&#92;, n. pl. & sing. [Jap.] In the former feudal system of \nJapan, the class or a member of the class, of military retainers of \nthe daimios, constituting the gentry or lesser nobility. They \npossessed power of life and death over the commoners, and wore two \nswords as their distinguishing mark. Their special rights and \nprivileges were abolished with the fall of feudalism in 1871.\n\nthan whatever you do, you&#39;re no samurai.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thiago Buschinelli \nSorrentino&quot; &lt;tsorrentino@u...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings to all,\n&gt; \n&gt; This is my second post, so, I bid you for understanding should \nsomething\n&gt; fail to remain in the boundaries of this particular tread.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to address the discussion concerning the meaning \nof &quot;Samurai&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;modern Samurai&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my field of work and study, I?ve come across a very interesting \nconcept,\n&gt; which I freely translate as &quot;Language Systems&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; To sum it up (summing subject to imperfections), reality depends on \nlanguage\n&gt; to exist. In other words, only what is inserted into a &quot;Language \nSystem&quot;,\n&gt; shared by other people (which are, in turn, language objects by \nthemselves),\n&gt; is real.\n&gt; \n&gt; Language, in this sense, does not need being verbal, but, e.g., the\n&gt; chemical-eletric relay between body cells creates a system of its \nown, which\n&gt; has contact points with other language systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; In short, a word does not point to an object, but, instead, points \nto\n&gt; another word (or language object).\n&gt; \n&gt; In view of the hereinabove, the usage of the word &quot;Samurai&quot; needs\n&gt; clarification, i.e., it needs to point out the boundaries which \nfill it with\n&gt; a sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, considering &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;law&quot; to be qualified systems \nof\n&gt; language (as they require a special procedure and due person \nto &quot;say&quot;\n&gt; something valid), the insertion on the concept of &quot;Samurai&quot; (as \nclass, not\n&gt; in the social sense, but as an open framework) depended on how the \nrulers of\n&gt; that time set the related definition.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to the &quot;samurai-archives&quot; website, three bills tending to \nabolish\n&gt; the &quot;Samurai&quot; were passed (that is, removing them from a particular \nlanguage\n&gt; system), which were &quot;the Five Oaths Act&quot;, the &quot;Sword Wearing \nForbiddance\n&gt; Act&quot;, and another one, which I will certainly recall later.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would this have dissolved the &quot;Samurai&quot;? Does &quot;Samurai&quot; exists only \non other\n&gt; language systems (such as the Historic System, which tries to \nrecreate past\n&gt; language on present language) than the qualified ones, thus \nrendering the\n&gt; expression &quot;modern Samurai&quot; incorrect?\n&gt; \n&gt; These are brief considerations, which I hope will add positively to \nthe\n&gt; subjects addressed in this forum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Respectfully,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thiago\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s.: Once I mananged to read the &quot;Sun&quot; post related on prior \nmessages\n&gt; (&quot;modern Samurai&quot;), I tried to retrieve legistative references \npertaining to\n&gt; the re-comission or installment of &quot;Samurais&quot;, but to no avail so \nfar.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   -----Mensagem original-----\n&gt;   De: Cesare Polenghi [mailto:cepo@d...]\n&gt;   Enviada em: sabado, 31 de janeiro de 2004 01:17\n&gt;   Para: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Assunto: Re: [samuraihistory] Hi!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   On Jan 30, 2004, at 2:39 AM, Edward Alexander wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Thanks.I have got some new books to read!!!!But i can&#39;t find \nthe Book\n&gt;   &gt; of Five Rings.I have looked everywhere!!!!!!!!!!NOTHING!!!!!!!!\nThink\n&gt;   &gt; i&#39;ll have to buy it online...Edy\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Sure. Only the ones below are all &#39;manuals&#39; that glorify the \nsamurai\n&gt;   ideals. For what samurai ***actually*** were, try something like\n&gt;   &quot;Heavenly Warriors,&quot; by Farris; or &quot;Musui Story,&quot; a biography, by\n&gt;   Katsu. Other good texts are &quot;Warlords, Artists, and Commoners,&quot;  \nby\n&gt;   Elison & Smith; and &quot;The Taming of the Samurai,&quot; by Ikegami. &lt;-\nnote,\n&gt;   apart from Musui Story these are all academic works.\n&gt;   bye\n&gt;   cepo\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; jacob gerhard &lt;madbearscave@y...&gt; wrote:Hey Steve,\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Here some book titles for ya.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Code of the Samurai: AModern Translation of Bushido\n&gt;   &gt; Shoshinshu of Taira Shigesuke&quot; by Thomas Cleary\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai&quot; by Yamamoto\n&gt;   &gt; Tsunetomo and translated by William Scott Wilson\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Book of the Five Rings&quot; by Miyamoto Musashi, various\n&gt;   &gt; translations\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Jake\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ---\n&gt;   Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;   Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;   ---\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
