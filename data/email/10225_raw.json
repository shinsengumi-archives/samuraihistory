The city itself really experienced a dark peri=\r\nod. Think kind of like the image of the wild west, but set in medieval Japa=\r\nn. Murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping for ransom, famine were all common pla=\r\nce in the immediate aftermath. In addition to the books already mentioned I=\r\n would also suggest Kyoto in the Momoyama Period by Wendell Cole to see the=\r\n long term effects of city being devastated. It might be tough to find, I g=\r\not a used copy through Amazon, but if you can get it for a descent price it=\r\n is worth reading to see how long lasting the effects of the Onin War itsel=\r\nf, and the wide spread civil war that followed affected Kyoto. \n\n--- In sam=\r\nuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Cearb@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All--\n&gt; \n&gt; Does any=\r\none know (or can anyone point me to a good source) what specific buildings =\r\nwere destroyed in Kyoto during the Onin war?
