In fact, it&#39;s 11.93 inches. \n&gt;\nI would be extremely hesistant to quote any measurements made before the \n1850&#39;s to this level of accuracy. In period I suspect they varied by \n10-20% easily unless they had a national standards department with \nenforcement. I seem to remember that surveying was was introduced in the \nMeiji period and there was controversy about uniform measurements. This \nmay of been over Western measurements however.\n\n&gt;1 shaku = 11.93054 inches (30.30 cm)\n&gt;\nGood for modern stuff, but who uses shaku now?\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n"
