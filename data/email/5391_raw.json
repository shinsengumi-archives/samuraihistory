So after that, Nobunaga\n&gt; did his best to humiliate Mitsuhide, including hitting\n&gt; him on the head with...a fan. Hmm...\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, this same show had Ieyasu stopping at a\n&gt; food stall prior to the battle of Mikata-ga-hara,\n&gt; hearing the Takeda army coming while mid-dango, and\n&gt; running off without paying--the old lady running the\n&gt; stall apparently chased him down after a couple miles\n&gt; and made him pay. Later on, after the battle, he gets\n&gt; back to his castle, and his retainers unsaddle his\n&gt; horse, finding &quot;unchi&quot; on the saddle--and Ieyasu\n&gt; claims it&#39;s &quot;yakimiso&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d heard part 2 of that one before--just not sure of\n&gt; the physics of it, being as he was wearing armor and\n&gt; all. \n\n\nI saw the same thing, but only the part about the &quot;New Theory&quot; of \nHonnouji, about Nobunaga after Mitsuhide&#39;s wife.\n\n\n"
