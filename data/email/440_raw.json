It may be passe, but the fact is, Nobunaga was not\nonly flexible in war and politics - far more than most of his\ncontemporaries, but he also knew what it took to unify the country, and went\nabout it fearlessly and ruthlessly.  Before his attack on Mt. Hiei, where\n[allegedly] 20,000 men, women and children were slaughtered, he stated, that\nhe (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) basically threw any semblance of a normal life or\nthe pursuit of worldly pleasure away for the good of Japan (in order to\nunify it, and bring peace to it), and since not only had the monks of Mt.\nhiei stymied his attempts at subjugating the asakura, but done so even after\nmany warnings, he was forced to slaugher them because they stand in the way\nof the peace of Japan.\nUnfortunately, Nobunaga was killed before we could know what his true\nintentions were, so the validity of that statement can&#39;t be measured, but\nthe fact does stand that the young upstart from Owari province who due to a\nfreak occurence (destroying Imagawa Yoshimoto on a fluke) changed the course\nof Japanese history.\nIf Yoshimoto had gone through Mino instead of Owari, and challenged or\nallied with Saito, things would have been completely different, the Oda may\nhave been crushed in the mid 1560&#39;s by an emperor sanctioned army sent from\nKyoto by the Imagawa...  \nOne could argue that Nobunaga sacrificed a &#39;normal life&#39; (whatever that\nwould amount to during the sengoku) for the good of Japan - although that\nwas probably not his true motivation, but again, he died probably about 6\nyears too soon to know what his true intentions were - would he have tried\nto become Shogun, or taken another title, or ursurp the depose the emperor\nand make himself emperor?  What if, what if...?\n\nc.w.\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From:\tfifthchamber@...

Organisational \n&gt; skills..Earning of respect in his lands ( And from other Daimyo and his \n&gt; retainers)..Developing of machinery of government and development of \n&gt; agriculture (dam construction and road building etc..) Damn! the list goes\n&gt; \n&gt; on!\n&gt;  Who would I have been if I could? Sasaki Shiro Takatsuna of the Uji river\n&gt; \n&gt; race fame.. What a Samurai! On the method he used to acquire his horse for\n&gt; \n&gt; the race alone he would have my respect but that on top of being such a \n&gt; warrior rates him highly on my list..Failing that (although it has already\n&gt; \n&gt; been taken!) Yagyu Munenori without a doubt. And after that Miyamoto\n&gt; Musashi, \n&gt; and after that...See what these questions do to me!\n&gt;  Abayo!\n&gt;  Ben.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
