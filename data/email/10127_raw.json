For example.. not ALL Iba=\r\n are southern-holdouts... not all Kodzuki (Kotsuki) are southern hold-outs.=\r\n.etc.etc. The Kawachi area=C2=A0aroudn Osaka=C2=A0seems to have produced th=\r\ne most hold-outs. \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 If you had to pick some that seem to =\r\nbe almost entirely southern hold-outs, and that are WELL documented as bein=\r\ng southern-hold outs... you would have to go with the Yasumi and Nojiri. Bo=\r\nth served the Kusunoki and Momonoi southern factions, and both continued to=\r\n assist the southern court descendents after the war was over. You would th=\r\nink that because of their power-based in Kawachi , that the Yuza family wou=\r\nld also be involved, but this does not seem to be the case. In fact, when t=\r\nhe Yuza were planning on overthrowing Lord Hatakeyama in the late 1560s, Ya=\r\nsumi and Nojiri families turned on them and helped bring Oda Nobunaga into =\r\nthe area.=C2=A0 Some have theorized that the Yasumi and Nojiri did this bec=\r\nause the Southern Heirs were located just outside of Nagoya, and they neede=\r\nd to ensure safety of them from Oda. Having turned against the Hayakeyama A=\r\nND the Yuza, and assisting Oda Nobunaga in entering Kawachi and marching on=\r\n Kyoto, they secured their\n Owari holdings and the southern heirs. It is al=\r\nso believed that Oda Nobunaga was still weary of the Nojiri (why is all the=\r\nories, not real evidence.. some believe they were too strong or too rich,et=\r\nc.etc.) so he seized their Iimori holdings and left them only with their Na=\r\ngoya holdings, but this was &quot;fine&quot; because they still maintained some land,=\r\n castles, and the ability to continue their duties. However, the Yasumi wou=\r\nld eventually fade away due to old rivalries causing too much damage to the=\r\n clan. The=C2=A0Nojiri would continue one, serving Oda forces as high ranki=\r\nng bowmen and as spies. The spying would take a more prominent role as Toyo=\r\ntomi rose to power.=C2=A0 Eventually, they would be serving ONLY as spies (=\r\nsuch as Nojiri Narimasa who served as Fukushima Masanori&#39;s=C2=A0chief spy),=\r\n with a few=C2=A0exceptions of course. =C2=A0I suppose it should be noted t=\r\nhat the Kumazawa family served Fukushima Masanori... and so because we see =\r\nKumazawa working for Fukushima... and\n Nojiri serving as his top spies... w=\r\ne MIGHT be able to assume that Fukushima Masanori was a pro-south daimyo...=\r\n that OR they were running it behind his back... I have found no supporting=\r\n evidence either way. \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 So...were to look for them =\r\n? Well - in short- they used to run the Iimori area of Kawachi and the Hibi=\r\ntsu area of Nagoya.=C2=A0 However, to put a long story short, they did not =\r\nweather the late 1500s well and the Yasumi have practically faded away and =\r\nthe Nojiri ended up working as spies for the Fukushima, Nakagawa, and Hachi=\r\nsuka. Those two families are the easiest to confirm as being southern suppo=\r\nrters (besides the Kumazawa who ARE legit heirs to the southern court).\n=C2=\r\n=A0 \n=C2=A0 Some of these families have continued to this day... and out of=\r\n those, -SOME- of them have maintained a Pro-South ideology... and -SOME- h=\r\nave not. You would really need to talk to the individual heads of the famil=\r\ny (or branch family,etc.) to find out their stance on the topic. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I hope this answered your question. If you want an=\r\nymore specific information, ask and I will do answer whatever I can.=C2=A0 =\r\nI think it is best to understand my emails as HISTORIC... because some of t=\r\nhe families mentioned in my letters may or may not be involved with such id=\r\neology in the present day--- and as such, we need to not assume that they s=\r\ntill are, to avoid possible insults.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 So that is my disc=\r\nlaimer.=C2=A0 And as for sources to this info... *sigh* I really don&#39;t feel=\r\n like hunting it all down. But it is all WELL documented, so just google it=\r\n or something.. lol=C2=A0 Kumazawa Banzan was a famous Confucian scholar in=\r\n the 1600s.=C2=A0 He is well documented, so maybe start with him. \n\n--- On =\r\nTue, 2/16/10, Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Cearb@... &lt;C=\r\nearb@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] how did samurai get their last =\r\nname?\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Tuesday, February 16, 2010, =\r\n10:46 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nSteven--\n\nYour information was quite enlightening, bu=\r\nt what I&#39;m really looking for is \nany name (individual, Daimyo or other maj=\r\nor or even reasonably powerful \nfigure) specifically associated with a sout=\r\nhern court claimant to the throne \nshortly after the Onin war, say circa 14=\r\n95...
