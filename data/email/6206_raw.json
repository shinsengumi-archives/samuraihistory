Fred\nSaberhagen&#39;s _The\n&gt; Dracula Tape_ is a rather nicely researched satire that purports to be\nVlad\n&gt; Tepes&#39; own account of his visit to England, refuting the unkind reports of\n&gt; Stoker and &quot;that old sadist Van Helsing.&quot;  If you can find the novel, it\n&gt; might give you some pleasure.\n\nI love that book. I regard it as the *true* version of the Stoker account.\n:)\n\nHeh.  You too, eh?  Well, that&#39;s sure the effect it has when you&#39;ve read it.\nBut it sounds better coming from you than if I&#39;d said that.  A delightful\nbook.  (The somewhat endless sequels are fun as well, but none of them hold\na candle to the first.)\n\nInteresting that you did a paper on him - as soon as I wrote that about the\nquality of Saberhagen&#39;s research, I thought - &quot;O Gods - there&#39;s some Tony\nout there who&#39;s going to nail my ignorance here!&quot;  (I know more about the\nTurks than I do about the Romanians, and while _Tape_ fit into that picture\npretty credibly, still, it was a stretch.)\n...And people worry they can&#39;t find affirmation on this list.\n        Gereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
