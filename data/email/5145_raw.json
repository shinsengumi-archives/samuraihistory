Since I&#39;m here with the military, I don&#39;t\n&gt; get a visa or a gaijin ID card. Not sure if I can get\n&gt; the library card with just my passport, but one of\n&gt; these days I&#39;ll make it there, just to look if nothing\n&gt; else. \n\nI didnt have to show any ID at all.

Either a case of small-\ntown kindness, or a taste of small town terror having to ask anything \nof a Gaijin in JAPANESE :O\n\n\n"
