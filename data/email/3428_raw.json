There were Daimyo who converted and even\nendorsed christianity(Otomo Sorin). Most of whom did\nso to attain foriegn support especially when stonger\nclans were invading their territories.\n\nAs for Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu(whom I have much respect\nfor) was not in power when Francis Xvavier came to\nshore on Kyushu. He wasn&#39;t even lord of Mikawa yet.\nWhat was being discused was not if christan samurai\nbetrayed their lords of culture. But a discussion of\nthose who were christian and were to research them.\n\nThis is an important part of the Sengoku period.\n\n\n--- Me�al_Mikit_St�r-ljon_Oddhinsson\n&lt;medhal8@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There is no Christian Samurai.\n&gt; Those so-called Christian &quot;Samurai&quot; acted in\n&gt; threachery against an expressed\n&gt; order of Lord Tokugawa Ieyassu and attempted to\n&gt; terminate with his life in\n&gt; order to impose christianism in Japan as it was done\n&gt; at other countries. So,\n&gt; they was not betrayed their own lord, but the land,\n&gt; the way of their\n&gt; ancestors and the way of the Samurai in itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just to be born with samurai ancestry and know how\n&gt; to handle a sword does\n&gt; not make anyone a Samurai.\n&gt; \n&gt; Much of the samurai &quot;way-of-thinking&quot; is from\n&gt; Buddhism and Shintoism (or\n&gt; Shind� that means &quot;The Way of the Gods&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; Christians should search in history to real sources\n&gt; to seek for their pride\n&gt; instead of borrowing elements of other cultures and\n&gt; put in them the seal of\n&gt; their god. Unfortunatelly there is so much\n&gt; people-like-hitler in\n&gt; Christianism, just like Hitler himself (&quot;I am now as\n&gt; before a Catholic and\n&gt; will always remain so&quot; Adolph Hitler, 1941), Charles\n&gt; Magne (killed more than\n&gt; 4000 saxons for refusal to convert to christianism),\n&gt; Olaf the Holy and Olaf\n&gt; Tryggvarsson (of Norway, they also did thousands of\n&gt; sword-pointed\n&gt; convertions and prosecuted their native religions\n&gt; there that have several\n&gt; common elements with Shinto), Oda Nobunaga Shogun\n&gt; (killed many buddhist\n&gt; monks, destroyed many buddhists monasteries and\n&gt; entire villages and their\n&gt; respectives villagers slaughtered just for dwelling\n&gt; near those monasteries)\n&gt; and very few good and coherent examples like St.\n&gt; Francisco of Assis (his\n&gt; order in some periods of history was even prosecuted\n&gt; due to that).\n&gt; \n&gt; Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\n&gt; S�o Paulo - SP\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Message: 1\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 27 Jan 2004 11:43:09 -0800 (PST)\n&gt; &gt;    From: jacob gerhard &lt;madbearscave@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Hi!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey Carmen,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here are some prominant Christian Samurai that I\n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; of:\n&gt; &gt; Otomo Sorin\n&gt; &gt; Kuroda Yoshitaka\n&gt; &gt; Arima Harunobu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also check out the Shimabara Rebelion 1637-1638\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also though there may have been Christain Samurai,\n&gt; &gt; Christianity was viewed as a potential\n&gt; threat(foreign\n&gt; &gt; powers namely the Portuguese) by Toyotomi\n&gt; Hideyoshi\n&gt; &gt; and the Tokugawa Shogunate. Their crack down on\n&gt; &gt; christianity wasn&#39;t so much hatred toward\n&gt; christains\n&gt; &gt; as much as eliminating a disruptive force. The\n&gt; &gt; samurai(Oda Nobunaga) also cracked down on the\n&gt; Buddist\n&gt; &gt; Ikko Sect for the same reasons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jake\n&gt; &gt; --- Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Carmen et al-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If christians have lots to learn from Samurai,\n&gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they could learn it ALL from Christian Samurai.\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would examine the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; history of christianity in Kyushu and the lives\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Christian\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Daimyo, sounds like a natural subject for your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interests...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
