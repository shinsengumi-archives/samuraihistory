Hopefully someone else can \nfind a bit more festive anniversary for you!\n\nOf course the complicating factor is the changing Japanese \ncalendar. I would imagine that this date of adbication was June \n23 as figured at the time, not _our_ June 23, on the Gregorian calenda\nr. This is always the fly in the ointment with old Japanese dates.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
