Are you saying that one can not feel mysticism in objects or things if you will? Because you know thats not true. If people can worship differntly then that means they can feel differntly about things right. Say for instance, you have something you love. You do have a love dont you? Be it your wife or your sword and what ever that love my be you probably look at it as more than just what it is.  My wife to me is more than just a woman, my GOD is more than just a spirit and my sword is more than just a piece of steel. GOD BLESS YOU ALL.\n \npeace \n\nThomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; wrote:\n\nThere is a significant difference between appreciation and mystique.\n\nOne can appreciate the craftsmanship of a sword, a piece of\ncalligraphy, a poem, a blossom, a tank, and F1 racing car ... \nin fact just about anything.\n\nOne of my favourite sights, when working in an office overlooking\nS London (low skyline) was Conorde on the Heathrow approach.\n\nBut that does not mean I am subject to the mystique of the thing.\n\nI have often wondered whether the mystique - the mystery - of the\nsword stands in some way as a marker of man&#39;s removal, or distance, \nfrom that which the sword represents.\n\nI don&#39;t think the sword carried quite as much &#39;spiritual\nsignificance&#39; to the Sengoku and earlier samurai. Their approach was \nsomewhat more pragmatic. The sword represents them, rather than \nthey being symbolised by the sword. The names of sword, as discussed,\nowe nothing to mystique, more to about how someone came into\npossession of the blade.\n\nThere was probably one called &#39;the shop on the corner&#39;.\n\nMystique - I don&#39;t think so - just the sepia-tinted voice of\nignorance, sentimentality and nostalgia.\n\n(If one hand to examine the effect of the sword close up, I bet that\ngoes some way to dispelling the mystique)\n\nIn fact, I wonder whether &#39;mystique&#39; occurs when one doesn&#39;t know\nenough about the object to appreciate it properly?\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
