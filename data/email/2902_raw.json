Uchi-katana is short for &quot;kata-te uchi \nkatana&quot;, which literally means single-hand-strike sword. The tachi and \nthe katana were never limited to a two-handed grip and are just as \nagile if not more so than a claymore.\n\tIf Kendo is your only example BTW, you need only look at the \nKendo-kata and or the Seitei-Iai kata for single hand cuts, blocks and \nthrusts...\n-t\n\n\n"
