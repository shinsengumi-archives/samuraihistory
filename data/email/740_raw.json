He hasn&#39;t gotten a mention at all so I thought that\n&gt; he should. He had undoubtedly made an impact on the European continent\n&gt; between 950-953 AD, when the Roman Empire was falling. He would have beaten\n&gt; the Turks to pillaging Constantinople if he didn&#39;t have the appropriate\n&gt; siege weapons to break down the heavily fortified walls. The Turks took care\n&gt; of that a few hundred years later. However, the effort on Attila&#39;s part was\n&gt; not wasted. It did allow him to establish his empire and therefore allow his\n&gt; efforts to be focused on the west - ie Gaul etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fifth, Genghis Khan, who undoubtedly had invaded more land than any other\n&gt; invader to date. No other military leader had achieved such a feat even to\n&gt; this day. Had&#39;ve Genghis not died then it is possible that Europe would have\n&gt; had a different destiny.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;d considered Genghis, Attila, Saladin, and a whole pile of others. But I have\nnothing I&#39;d want to talk to them about, or ask... nothing off the top of my head. My\nlist is a combination of people I greatly admire and would like to meet, and people\nwhose campaigns I&#39;m curious about.\n\nIt didn&#39;t occur to me to list people like Stalin and Churchill as I was thinking of\nthem more as general bigbosses, rather than commanders in the field. Probably a\nshortsighted view, but...\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
