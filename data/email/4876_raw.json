Since the era name and date \n&gt; was still clear I made a note out of it out of curiosity just to see \n&gt; how old the thing was.  It was marked &quot;Jokyou 5&quot;.  So I went to my \n&gt; computer, used my handy-dandy era converter, and lo and behold, \n&gt; the &quot;Jokyo&quot; era ended in the 4th year.  There was no &quot;Jokyou 5&quot;!  \n\nYes, there was. Genroku 1 was proclaimed on the 30th day of the ninth month of \nJokyo 5. Everything up to that date was Jokyo 5. Everything after it was Genroku 1.\n\nWhen the last emperor died in 1989, you know 1989 was still the Shï¿½wa Era -- and \na few weeks later it became Heisei 1.\n\nSurely you don&#39;t think that eras change at midnight on Dec. 31. :)\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
