Daikoku is also the deity of the kitchen and\nprovider of food.\n\nIn the original wrathful form (away from the Shimbutsu Shugo phenomena and\nits respecive association), he was worshiped in India as a fierce aspect of\nShiva, but in Buddhism, as one of the Eleven faces of Avalokites&#39;v�ra\nBodhisattva (jap. Juichi-men Kanjizai Bosatsu)\n\nAs an warrior&#39;s deity, probable it as subject of dedication of some samurais\nwho practiced study and austerity on tantric buddhism, like Miyamoto Musashi\ndid, dedicating himself to Fud� Myo Ou (Sansk. Ac�lanatha Vidyar�ja).\n\nAs in association with the Shinto Deity Okuninushi no Mikoto, he is one of\nthe Seven Gods of Good Fortune (Shichi Fuku-Jin), but I am not able to find\nout if such associated practice of the Seven Gods was just a Japanese\nphenomena derivated from the Shimbutsu Shugo, or if it was in some other\nway, in other countries&#39;s vajrayana buddhism (Mah� Kala is not (under my\nknowledge) present in any other form of devotional buddhism, Sutra Buddhism\nor Dhyana Buddhism or in any of the other schools of Mahayana Buddhism, but\nsurelly not in any of theravadim schools)\n\nSorry for the mistake\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\n\n"
