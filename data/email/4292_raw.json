Just like &quot;A Book of Five Rings,&quot; these ori=\r\nginal \ntreaties are understandable only after one has a good grasp on Japan=\r\nese \nhistory. I am not saying that these books are not good, but some peopl=\r\ne \nread ONLY them, and think they &#39;know&#39; about Samurai then... In case, is =\r\n\neasier to watch &quot;Shogun,&quot; or &quot;The Last Samurai.&quot;\n\nThese are the books, any=\r\nway I hope you listen to what Tony said as \nwell, as I agree 100% with him.=\r\n NOTHING about East Asia can be really \nunderstood without direct practice,=\r\n since the Way in which knowledge is \ntransmitted in Japan (and China, etc.=\r\n) is never limited to texts.\n\nHope it helped,\n\nCepo\nGraduate Assistant\nHist=\r\nory Department\nUniversity of Hawai&#39;i\n\n\nOn Apr 25, 2004, at 4:49 AM, horses4=\r\nher wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt;  I joined this group to assist with a paper I am r=\r\nesearching regarding\n&gt;  Samurai history.=A0 Any websites or books to aid in=\r\n an accurate\n&gt;  portrayal of the life of the Samurai would be most helpful.=\r\n=A0 Thank\n&gt;  you for your assistance.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Gail\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;  Samurai Ar=\r\nchives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;  Samurai Archives store: http://w=\r\nww.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;  ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
