I know that Stephen Turnbull has been rather busy on the publishing front lately having decided to give up his &quot;day job&quot; and do another MA..... I have just bought the &quot;Samurai - the World of the Warrior&quot; - and at 224 pages its not thin!  I was expecting to see some new illustrations by Angus McBride but for some unknown reason there has been no illustrator collaboration on this book. However, Stephen has illustrated it well with various photos and prints gathered from his 2003 &quot;study tour&quot;. At first glance it looks different! but I will be doing a review as soon as I get chance to read it....  I now await the promised &quot;Kawanakajima&quot; in the Osprey Series..\n\n            Rod :-)\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: murphymurphyjohn@... \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, November 29, 2003 10:32 PM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re TURNBULL ALERT----resp ProfMurf: -------.\n\n\n  Steven Turnbull&#39;s new samurai book is expensive, thin, few if any sources,  \n  and only a rehash of writing he has done for 17 yrs.
