Though the comparison between a special \nops raid on a building to eliminate a target and a ninja &quot;attack&quot; on a \nbuilding to take out a target was rediculous.  I guess I should be thankful \nthat the ninja &quot;attack&quot; did not include Hayes in a black uniform.\n  Though I do not know what to think about the Ninja Museum in Iga.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet ready for school!
