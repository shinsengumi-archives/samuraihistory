What companies make \n15mm figures for Samurai and Koreans for the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592?\n\nI know that Two  Dragons, Minifigs, Irregular Miniatures, Tin Soldier, and \nNaismith, all have samurai lines. The first three would be compatible with each \neach in terms of size.  Tin Soldier are very large 15s while Naismith are very \nsmall 15s.\n\nIn terms of Koreans, Naismith makes at least 6 different packs of Koreans, \nbut I don&#39;t know if they are for the Yi Dynasty or for an earlier period.  East \nRiding Miniatures has some Yi Dynasty Koreans, but they only make command \nfigures and two types of heavy cavalry (no infantry).\n\nIrregular Miniatures makes some Korean figures as part of the Mongol line, so \nI suspect that they would be too early for the period I am interested in.\n\nDoes anyone know of any other manufacturers of 15mm Japanese and Korean \nfigures?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBob Burke \n\n"
