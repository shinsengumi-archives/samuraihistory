I don&#39;t think \nthere will be many problems.&quot; With his comments, the Prime Minister \nwas buying into Japan&#39;s hottest topic: the problem that there are no \nmales to succeed the current heir, 43-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito.\n\nEmperor Akihito is 71 and in 2002 had surgery for prostate cancer, \nalthough he appears to have made a full recovery.\n\nBut concerns about succession in the world&#39;s oldest hereditary \ndynasty have lead to reports this week in the Asahi Shimbun \nnewspaper of a government &quot;feasibility study&quot; on the idea of a \nfemale heir.\n\nOnly if there is a change can the throne one day be occupied by \nPrincess Aiko, the only child of the Crown Prince and his 41-year-\nold wife, Princess Masako.\n\nCrown Prince Naruhito&#39;s younger brother, Akishino, also has no sons, \nand a male from another branch of the ruling family would inherit \nthe throne.\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Japans-PM-backs-option-of-\nempress/2004/12/03/1101923338147.html?oneclick=true\n\n\n\n\n"
