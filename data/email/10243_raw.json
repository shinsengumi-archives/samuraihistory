(It is visible on Google Earth, but none of the\nbuildings are labeled, and of course it is not commonly open to the public.\n I&#39;ve been to Kyoto a half dozen times or more and have never been inside\nthe palace grounds.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help would be much appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt; --Richard Burns,\n&gt; Gainesville, FL\n\nI&#39;d have to look at it again to see if it has exactly what you are looking\nfor, but it sounds like the kind of information that could be found in the\nappendix to *A Tale of Flowering Fortunes* trans. by William H. and Helen\nCraig McCullough (the actual text will probably help as well, but is less\nsearchable).  The other one I would recommend is *World of the Shining\nPrince* by Ivan Morris.  As I recall, they both give some information on the\nlayout of the palace.\n\nBTW, the modern palace really doesn&#39;t resemble the Heian palace.  Too many\nchanges and the actual government offices are no longer present.\n\nHave you done a Google search for the Heian palace, yet?  Maps of the layout\nare pretty common.\n\n-Josh\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
