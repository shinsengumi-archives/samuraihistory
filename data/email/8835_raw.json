My professor didn&#39;t like them (and \nthe Bungo manual is pretty short) and made his own materials to teach \nthe class.  I haven&#39;t seen the Shirane book, so I can&#39;t speak to it, \nbut the other has only limited utility.  Get yourself a good classical \nJapanese dictionary (be advised that the iwanami one lists verbs by the \nrenyokei) and just start reading texts.  I would suggest that you read \nthe introductory matter and the back matter (explains verbs \nconjugations and the joshi and jodoushi) of whichever dictionary you \nbuy thoroughly.  Also, it will probably help you to start with texts \nthat have translations already so that you can check your progress.\n\nGood luck.\n\nShannon\n\n\n\n\n"
