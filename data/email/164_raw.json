It started with manga&#39;s like Lone wolf and cub and \nmovies like Yojimbo, Ran etc. But as I grew older my interest in the \nhistory grew.\n   I am definitly an amature historian and not a scholar by any sense \nof the word. But I hope to contribute to the list as time goes on.\n\n   My question is, were peasants literate during the samurai eras or \nwas it only the samurai or noble classes.\n\n\nRegards\nAaron\n\n\n\n"
