While he is not associated with any great University, his \n  work seems to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is not an amazing writer ( imean; his \n  style), but he seems to be truly in love with the subject, and I really like the way he \n  fills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind of (perhaps?) self-made scholarship \n  is available.\n  Since this is the first time I write, I was wondering what you &quot;samurai-maniacs&quot; public \n  think of Turnbull in general.\n  Any book you would suggest in particular?\n  Thanx,\n  cepo\n\n\n        Yahoo!
