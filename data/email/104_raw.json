Very fruitful \ncomparisons could be drawn between the development of \nEuropean and Japanese castles, but their is no serious \nrecent work available in translation. The problems we face \nare similar; where do we go beyond the work of Stephen \nTurnbull?\n\nWhat is really required is a project that can unite \nacademics and enthusiasts from Japan and the English \nspeaking world enabling a sharing of ideas and research. \nThis would depend for its success upon a significant \nnumber of multilingual intermediaries. My guess is that \nthere are far more Japanese medievalists who speak/read \nEnglish, than English speakers who also know Japanese.\n\nJon Freeman\n\n\n\n"
