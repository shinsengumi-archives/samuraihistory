It usually refers to the\n&gt; period when armies used artillery \n&gt; and firearms (handguns, arquebusses, and early\n&gt; muskets).\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 11/16/03 6:04:50 PM,\n&gt; cepo@... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt; I agree with Nate.\n&gt; In particular, the term Renaissance is normally used\n&gt; in a cultural \n&gt; context, so I do not understand the connection with\n&gt; warring...\n&gt; \n&gt; If we should select a historical period in medieval\n&gt; Japan we could \n&gt; &quot;compare&quot; (oowwww, here we go again??) with the\n&gt; Renaissance, it would \n&gt; probably be the very late Muromachi+Azuchi-Momoyama\n&gt; period of &quot;Gold and \n&gt; Red,&quot; coming after the austere, heavily Zen\n&gt; influenced arts of the \n&gt; Kamakura/Muromachi periods. Nobunaga and Hideyoshi\n&gt; castles were perfect \n&gt; example of the artistic abundance and extravagance\n&gt; of the period.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bye,\n&gt; Cepo, Honolulu.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS=I have a couple of very nice shots of Hideyoshi&#39;s\n&gt; castle in Momoyama \n&gt; (Fushimi), is there any way I can share them with\n&gt; you? It will be \n&gt; finally re-opened to the public in 2005. &gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
