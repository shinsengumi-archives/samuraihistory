I don&#39;t know for sure, but there are definatley\nhints that the Inquisition used christian samurai. I\ndon&#39;r think they used them alongside there\nconquistadores though.\n\nThis was a very controversial subject back then. For a\nsamurai to be controlled by a &quot;gaijin&quot; a foreigner,\nsent alot of samurai up in flames. The Gaijin were\nbelow the &quot;eta&quot; in japanese society, this meant that\nanyone who came from outside of japan was SUB-human,\nand to be treated as such.\n\nLee\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you&#39;ll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n\n"
