I know u r not like the smartest people =\r\nin the world but a lil common sense and compassion. Gee wizz if u that smar=\r\nt u should have known what i ment. i dont want to make enimies or nothing b=\r\nut last i checked this was a fun and INFORMAL post. i mean through conversa=\r\ntion there is somthing like the meaning being understood. if i were talking=\r\n to u would i constantly have to say ur name over and over no. i really enj=\r\noy the post here and i rarely reply just enjoy the information being exchan=\r\nged. but to see u pick on something as simple as that made me upset. i mean=\r\n if u study a bit just a lil of Karate truthfully u had a dojo kun. the ver=\r\ny first of it was to seek perfection in character. to seek is to look not t=\r\nhat u will ever trully find it. so if u not perfect u should not so loosely=\r\n be pointing out others imperfections. i am not mad and i know u would like=\r\n for me to know the correct spelling... hmm GOD BLESS U \n \npeace\n\nNate Ledb=\r\netter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Elizabeth Chase &lt;lizzirrd@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Mmmmmmm Nathan, please forgive my own impertinence, \n&gt; but my und=\r\nerstanding is that the unarmed (no martial\n&gt; weaponry) styles of \n&gt; defense=\r\n were developed as general defensive\n&gt; techniques against all comers.\n\n\nImp=\r\nertinence forgiven. The point is that it was\ndeveloped by peasants, not sam=\r\nurai, because the\npeasants had no weapons. What works against an armed\nsamu=\r\nrai would be effective against an unarmed\nassailant also, no? The original =\r\nposter was asking\nabout samurai influence on unarmed martial arts forms.\nRa=\r\nther than being primary developers, they were\nprimary antagonists. (And now=\r\n some &quot;expert&quot; will come\nin and assail me because unarmed techniques that w=\r\nere\nthe forerunners of Juujitsu, etc., were developed way\nback when for use=\r\n if you lost your sword, or\nsomething. True. But the point is not the\ndetai=\r\nls--it&#39;s that for the most part, the samurai\nweren&#39;t injecting some mystica=\r\nl bushido into karate.)\n\n&gt; I realize it is fairly easy to take pot-shots at=\r\n\n&gt; those who seem --- less literate---  than ourselves.\n&gt; I also grow impat=\r\nient with \n&gt; people who wish to declare themselves, or seek, to\n&gt; be, samur=\r\nai.  However,  it is possible to develop\n&gt; within ourselves the best of \n&gt; =\r\nthe samurai traits. It is far easier to be critical,\n&gt; but a challenge to o=\r\nur character to be educators and\n&gt; compassionate.\n\nI find myself being &quot;com=\r\npassionate&quot; almost hourly on\nthis list. I&#39;ve never, ever questioned that yo=\r\nu can\ndevelop traits consistent with the teachings of\nBushido, if you want.=\r\n However, I also don&#39;t question\npeople who proclaim that &quot;all samurai follo=\r\nwed\nbushido&quot; or &quot;all samurai were good&quot; or &quot;ninja and\nsamurai were mortal e=\r\nnemies&quot; or any crap like that. I\nsimply tell them they&#39;re wrong. And if the=\r\ny can&#39;t\nhandle their misconceptions being challenged, that&#39;s\nwhen the compa=\r\nssion tends to slip.\n\n&gt; Lastly, I find myself curious as to Mr. Wilson&#39;s ag=\r\ne\n&gt; and educational level,  whether he is dyslexic, and\n&gt; if English is a s=\r\necond or \n&gt; third language.\n\nMyself also. The Lord High Listmaster and myse=\r\nlf (I am\nonly his trusty minion, with a very minor fief in an\noutlying area=\r\n of the list) are working on a new rules\nlist, and one of those is a reques=\r\nt that everyone, oh,\nI don&#39;t know, USE PUNCTUATION? It&#39;s one thing if\nEngli=\r\nsh is not your primary language--I can make\nallowances for that. However th=\r\nere are many posters on\nthis list who are not native English speakers and\ns=\r\ntill can make themselves intelligible. They use\npunctuation in most other l=\r\nanguages, and it varies\nlittle. \n\n&gt; Just for the h-e-double-hockey-sticks o=\r\nf it..... how\n&gt; many of you &#39;play&#39; in the Society for Creative\n&gt; Anachronis=\r\nm......  if you do, do \n&gt; you pursue &#39;European&#39; or &#39;Asian/Japanese personas=\r\n?\n&gt; (No, lol, I don&#39;t mean as in &#39;chase&#39; them...)\n\nI think many do, and man=\r\ny do both Asian and European\npersonae. Talk to Tony--he&#39;s the grand Poobah =\r\nwhen it\ncomes to Japanese SCA. \n\nNate\n\n\n            \n______________________=\r\n____________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nMeet the all-new My Yahoo! - Try it today! \nh=\r\nttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.c=\r\nom\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n=\r\nYahoo!
