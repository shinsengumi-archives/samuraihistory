Whoa.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the first place, this is the seventh chapter of a\n&gt; book in the \n&gt; rough draft, so by this time, the showing has\n&gt; already done and a \n&gt; little bit of telling is in order. I just wanted a\n&gt; critique of the \n&gt; _chain of events_.\n\nOkay, fair enough. But you did come to a history\nthread saying you wanted to make things &quot;accurate&quot;.\nWe&#39;re GOING to base our comments off of history, and\nwhat was real. If you don&#39;t want to do things a\ncertain way, don&#39;t--it&#39;s your fantasy world.\n\n&gt; As for names, if I&#39;m not writing a book set in\n&gt; historical Japan, I \n&gt; think the fantasy names are probably a better idea.\n&gt; Hear me out: \n&gt; look, if this was a remake of Shogun I would\n&gt; certainly try to use \n&gt; Japanese names. It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a fantasy world very\n&gt; much like a \n&gt; certain period in Japanese history, and I think\n&gt; trying to use real \n&gt; Japanese names would actually cloud the issue.\n\nHere&#39;s my take: either use Japanese names, or don&#39;t\nuse them. Don&#39;t make &quot;half&quot; names. If you want to use\na slightly Japanesey setting for your fantasy novel,\nbut don&#39;t want it to &quot;BE&quot; Japanese, that&#39;s cool--no\nissues. But then don&#39;t have one character be an\nIeyasu. That&#39;s not a fantasy name, that&#39;s a historical\nJapanese name, one what anybody who knows anything\nabout Japanese history will recognize. \n\nPersonally, I think you should go with Japanese\nnames--just make them non-historical figures. People\nunderstand, or should understand, that it&#39;s\nFICTION--by giving them actual Japanese names, that\ndoesn&#39;t mean they have to be real people, or even\nbased on real people. There&#39;s nothing wrong with\nhaving a Shonai Masayori (a perfectly possible, yet\nmade up name) as a main character. If you use Ieyasu,\nhowever, people are going to associate that with the\nREAL Ieyasu, and look for parallels/connections to\nreality, which is apparently not what you want. \n\nGo one way or the other.\n\n&gt; For example, if I write a fantasy novel that uses\n&gt; the term &quot;Shogun&quot; I \n&gt; am reprimanded for having fantasy aspects in what\n&gt; should be a work of \n&gt; historical fiction. If I write with the term &quot;Jogun&quot;\n&gt; (which I thought \n&gt; was a fair fantasy bastardization, if one exists)\n&gt; I&#39;m slammed for it \n&gt; being a knockoff. Help me win, guys. Help me find\n&gt; the right thing to \n&gt; do here.\n\nUsing the term &quot;Shogun&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you need to make\nevents match history. But like I said with the names,\nif you don&#39;t want to be held to any history standards,\nuse something completely different. Jogun isn&#39;t a good\none--it&#39;s fairly obvious it should be Shogun. My\nopinion, but the right thing to do is either use\nShogun (and I&#39;m about as much of an accuracy Nazi as\nyou can get, but wouldn&#39;t have an issue with the use\nof the term in an obviously fantasy/parallel world) or\nmake up something completely unrelated for use in your\nworld. \n\n&gt; Again, this is the seventh chapter, in rough draft,\n&gt; taken out of \n&gt; context, and a fantasy novel. I appreciate the\n&gt; critiques, and \n&gt; apologize for not being clearer in defining my\n&gt; terms. It&#39;s great that \n&gt; you guys are tkaing the time to set me straight on\n&gt; such important \n&gt; issues, I love this sort of stuff.\n\nAnd again, write for your audience. Your audience may\nnot care if you spell &quot;sake&quot; as &quot;saki&quot;. But understand\nyour audience here, as well. That&#39;s the kind of thing\nthat might make me put a book down at the bookstore\nrather than take it to the register. Does it matter in\nthe grand context of your story? Probably not. But you\nsaid you wanted help with accuracy, and, well, that&#39;s\nwhat we&#39;re trying to give you. It&#39;s up to you then to\ntake it and go &quot;no, my fantasy world doesn&#39;t need\nthat&quot;, or whatever. \n\nI don&#39;t read fantasy fiction, and as such, I&#39;m\nprobably not your audience. But again, it&#39;s so easy to\nget some little details right that make all the\ndifference in wether someone like me would read it or\nnot. The storyline itself seems fine--parents\ndishonored, kid raised to take revenge, etc. It&#39;s the\ndetails that are going to make me throw it away or\nstay up all night to get to the end. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
