We knew it was there as previous excavations had u=\r\nnearthed one of\nthe roman gateways. \n\nit seems that the normans had used th=\r\ne roman wall as part of the foundations.\n\n\nI recently videoed a discovery c=\r\nhannel program on the samurai and it had a lot\non Himeji castle. i forget t=\r\nhe weight of the wooden structure but the\nfoundations for the castle must b=\r\ne amazing. Maybe that is one of the reasons\nfor the huge mound then to face=\r\n it with huge boulders. the more reienforcement\nyou have the more weight it=\r\n can take on top. It also seems Himeji has a wood\nbeam running vertical ins=\r\nide o fthe wood structure to stop it collapsing in\nthe even of an earth qua=\r\nke.\n\npaul\n\nPaul Richardson\nBujinkan Lincoln Dojo 7th Dan\nwww.bujinkanuk.co.=\r\nuk\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGe=\r\nt free email and a permanent address at http://www.netaddress.com/?N=3D1\n\n\n"
