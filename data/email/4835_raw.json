Now I \ndon&#39;t know when but they got extended for battle and\ninstead of \ncarrying two they actually carried THREE one in each\nhand and one \ntucked into their belt. When entering battle they\nwould run towards \nthere enemies throwing one of the sai&#39;s  at the enemy\nthen drew the \nthird one ready for combat. \nI have 2 pare of Sai&#39;s and believe them to be deadly\nin experienced \nhands. Sai&#39;s are the ultimate disarming weapons in my\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
