The Ming celestial army \ncrossed the Yalu River and pushed the Japanese samurai army way back \nsouth. It might be said, thou, that the Chinese were 300,000, while the \nwhole Japanese troops who entered the conflict numbered some \n150,000-and by no means they were all there to fight the Chinese. After \nthe push South, the situation stalemated, basically until Hideyoshi&#39;s \ndeath in 1598.\nA very good article on these battles is in the &quot;Cambridge History of \nJapan&quot; vol .4. The book costs $150,- but its easily found virtually in \nevery university library.\nTurnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai Invasion,&quot; instead, concentrates mostly on Japanese \nand Korean sources-very few words abt the Ming army.\nI am not aware of any movie about the Japanese invasion of Korea. Does \nanybody know of any?? Maybe made in Korea or in China??\nCepo, Honolulu\n\n\n\nOn Nov 15, 2003, at 5:13 PM, Atisi Kazuari wrote:\n\n&gt; I know I haven&#39;t posted in a while, but in reading the latest posts\n&gt; regarding European Knight vs Samurai, one has to wonder how a Samurai\n&gt; vs his Chinese fighting equavilent. This stems from spending the last\n&gt; 48 hours reading and watching both old school kung(also gung)-fu\n&gt; movies and Kurasawa films.
