I have read in several books, The Five Rings & Others & I have heard from several of my Jpanese friends who have studied Japanese Samurai History and who have heard many Samurai family tales of Olden Times passed down from generation to generation, \nThat to be a Surviving Samaruai Warrior one had to be and Excellant Runner, one who would Run into the Battles and take several well placed whacks and or slashes , dispatching 3 or 4 departed Warriors, and would then run off from the fight just temporarily long enoug to wipe the Blood from his Blades, & perhaps check them for knicks and sharpness & if in need quickly sharpen them, he would then immediately run back to the Warring Action and again Enguage his Enemies, repeating the afore mentioned proceedure as often as necessary, until the Battle was Won! If this information is accurate and I believe that it is, A Samurai Warrior would also have to carry into battle a rag to wipe the blood from his blades and some type of sharpening stones and perhaps Clove Oil to lubricate and protect his Blades!\n\nShaku-Oh-Cho, The Samurai Warrior/ Priest/Bard /Prince of Love\n\nMyron K.
