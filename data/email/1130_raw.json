Most of what I&#39;ve\nread that touches on the subject is fictional works,\nnotably Eiji Yoshikawa&#39;s &quot;Taiko&quot; and Taiga Drama. If\nyou listen to Yoshikawa&#39;s story and the &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;\nTaiga drama (1996), One was pursued by both Tokichiro\nand Toshiie, and Tokichiro won her heart and married\nher. It&#39;s portrayed as part of his charm, how he could\nget this wonderfully beautiful (and smart) woman who\nwas above his station to love the little monkey, etc. \n\nAfter watching the first 4 episodes of &quot;Toshiie to\nMatsu&quot; (1997, I think?) the story it tells is that One\nand Matsu were vying for Toshiie&#39;s affections, and\nMatsu won. One was ordered by Nobunaga to marry\n&quot;Saru-dono&quot; (Monkey Lord) Tokichiro, and she was very\nunhappy about it. \n\nI know that all this is fiction. My question is, is\nthere anything academic that documents the relations\nbetween the 4, and what is the truth about their\nrelationships? Or is it all left open to fictional\ninterpretation? I figured the Ehon Taiko-ki wouldn&#39;t\ngo into great detail about how the great Taiko&#39;s wife\ndidn&#39;t want to marry him. \n\nIt is very interesting to watch the two different\nTaiga Drama&#39;s and see the differences. Quite funny,\nactually. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance - Get real-time stock quotes\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com\n\n"
