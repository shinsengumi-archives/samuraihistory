I&#39;ve read your website on how to make samurai armour & I need some help.(by the way,awesome site!!)  If you could, please give me some more info. on how to lace lames together. I&#39;m making almost every part of my armour out of them. I want to use the KOISHI gashari lame style. My biggest prob. is,... how many holes do i punch out in each lame, where to punch the holes, and if the Sugake Odoshi & Kebiki Odoshi styles of lacing are the right style for it & if so, could you show me how to lace these lames together on a larger scale using those methods???. I have chosen a &quot;plain flat braid&quot; about 3/8&quot; wide. I&#39;ve been trying to come up w/ a style of armour that i like & i finally came up w/ one..... have you seen the movie the &quot;last samurai&quot;? well..... Katsumoto&#39;s armor is the style i fell in love with. It just looks so samurai. I really appreciate your time. Hope to hear from you soon. \n                                       Thanks,\n                                            Mark\n                                          depos42300@...\n \np.s. i&#39;ll email you a pic of the armour when i&#39;m done so you can tell me if it looks authentic or not.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
