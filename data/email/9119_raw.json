The characters were clearly fictional and I believe that t=\r\nhe Ii clan was selected by the authors of the script (and the novel the scr=\r\nipt was based upon) as representative of a powerful clan of that era. \n \nHo=\r\nwever, what may or may not have actually happened during the Edo period wou=\r\nldn&#39;t be in the Ii clan chronicles, it would be in another clan&#39;s chronicle=\r\ns. I always can use another excuse to watch SEPPUKU yet again, as it&#39;s my f=\r\navorite all-time film (in any genre on any topic -- and I do watch a lot of=\r\n films). So I&#39;ll watch it this weekend to see if I can pick up the name of =\r\nthe ronin mentioned in passing in the film. Of course his name could have b=\r\neen fictionalized as could have been the use of the Sengoku clan&#39;s name. \n =\r\n\nThe question that would be relevant for research on the topic of seppuku d=\r\nuring the Edo period is if there was or was not any incidents where a ronin=\r\n came to a clan and requested a spot to commit seppuku to avoid a life of p=\r\noverty -- and if the clan, impressed by his sincerity, took him in as a ret=\r\nainer. What would also be relevant is if any ronin during that period, upon=\r\n getting word of this incident, took it upon themselves to extort positions=\r\n and/or money from clans by asking to commit seppuku, expecting to get eith=\r\ner a job or &quot;go away&quot; money. \n \nNina aka &quot;Wave Tossed&quot;\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: s=\r\namuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com] \nSent=\r\n: Thursday, October 19, 2006 6:27 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSub=\r\nject: RE: Research on Seppuku (was RE: [samuraihistory] - HOGEN INCIDENT)\n\n=\r\n\n\nabout seppuku(the film):Ii clan chronicles dont mention any such \ninciden=\r\nt.so,its possible that its pure fiction...regards tengu64\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Boal, Ni=\r\nna&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@ssa. &lt;mailto:Nina.Boal%40ssa.gov&gt; gov&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihis=\r\ntory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;samur=\r\naihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subj=\r\nect: Research on Seppuku (was RE: [samuraihistory] - HOGEN INCIDENT)\n&gt;Date:=\r\n Tue, 17 Oct 2006 08:13:18 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d love to see your finished work. Per=\r\nhaps you might want to put a link to \n&gt;it in the Edo Period section of the =\r\nSamurai Archives Citadel.\n&gt;\n&gt;Speaking of film and seppuku: I&#39;ve brought thi=\r\ns up before. But Kobayashi&#39;s \n&gt;film SEPPUKU discussed incidents of early Ed=\r\no-period ronin from disbanded \n&gt;clans coming to clan gateways to request a =\r\nspot to commit seppuku. In the \n&gt;film, the main fictional character (Tsugum=\r\no Hanshiro) mention a name of a \n&gt;ronin who came to the Sengoku clan&#39;s gate=\r\nway (unfortunately, the man&#39;s name \n&gt;mentioned in the film has escaped me a=\r\nt the moment). This ronin told the \n&gt;clan leaders that he preferred to comm=\r\nit seppuku rather than live on in \n&gt;endless poverty. The Sengoku clan leade=\r\nrs were so impressed that they made \n&gt;him a member of their clan. After tha=\r\nt, supposedly scores of impoverished \n&gt;ronin went to clan gates with seppuk=\r\nu requests and the clans would give \n&gt;them &quot;go away&quot; money. Sooner or later=\r\n most of these seppuku requests were \n&gt;insincere; the ronin involved wanted=\r\n the money rather than actually wanting \n&gt;to commit seppuku. As many of us =\r\nknow, the film SEPPUKU involves a ronin \n&gt;making such a request -- with tra=\r\ngic consequences.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, I don&#39;t really want to discuss the film. Rathe=\r\nr I&#39;m curious to \n&gt;know: did the incident mentioned in the film involving t=\r\nhe Sengoku clan \n&gt;actually happen? Or did Kobayashi (and/or novelest Takagu=\r\nchi) draw a \n&gt;completely fictional event with fictional names out of the ha=\r\nt? I wonder if \n&gt;you&#39;re planing to include this in your work.\n&gt;\n&gt;Nina aka &quot;=\r\nWave Tossed&quot; -- Moderator of the Edo Period section of the \n&gt;Samurai Archiv=\r\nes Citadel Forum\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n&gt;From: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistor=\r\ny%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com \n&gt;[mailto:samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samu=\r\nraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com]\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, October 17, =\r\n2006 1:30 AM\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;=\r\n yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] - HOGEN INCIDENT\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;T=\r\nhanks for your reply...

T=\r\nhe film&#39;s\n&gt;name (the same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of =\r\nHell&quot;, and\n&gt;was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes =\r\nplace in\n&gt;12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a =\r\nrevolt.\n&gt;During the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal pa=\r\nlace in\n&gt;Kyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescued by=\r\n a \n&gt;soldier\n&gt;named Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revolt f=\r\nails, Moritoh\n&gt;is told that he can have anything that he wants, and what he=\r\n wants is Lady\n&gt;Kesa to be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that she =\r\nis already\n&gt;married to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Rather t=\r\nhan seek\n&gt;something different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with La=\r\ndy Kesa.\n&gt;Filmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first co=\r\nlor films\n&gt;from Japan), the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exquisite. =\r\nThe story \n&gt;is\n&gt;by no means dated, though it does become somewhat predictab=\r\nle. Still, it is\n&gt;both compelling and engaging and the acting is superb, es=\r\npecially Machiko\n&gt;Ky. Memorable scenes in the film include the confusion at=\r\n the royal palace,\n&gt;Laky Kesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Moritoh meet=\r\ning Lady Kesa and \n&gt;her\n&gt;aunt after the revolt, Moritoh given the choice of=\r\n his heart&#39;s desire, the\n&gt;horse races, Moritoh at the home of Lady Kesa&#39;s a=\r\nunt, and the ending \n&gt;scenes.\n&gt;The makeup used on Moritoh could have been b=\r\netter.\n&gt;\n&gt;The film won several awards including an Oscar for Best Costume D=\r\nesign, an\n&gt;Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the pr=\r\nestigious\n&gt;Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Overall, I ra=\r\nte &quot;Gate of\n&gt;Hell&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars. Hopefully, the film will be fully=\r\n restored and\n&gt;released on DVD one day.
