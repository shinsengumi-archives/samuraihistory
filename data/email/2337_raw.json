Remember, the device on the helmet was not necessarily a &quot;Mon&quot; - or we would have some strange &quot;Mon&quot; to research!!\n\nWorth checking out &quot;our&quot; web pages... http://www.samurai-archives.com/crest1.html\n\nThere are several MOn which portray the crescent moon - depending on the shape, angle and thickness. Families that used such Mon include Okudaira, Amano, Ono, Nonaka, Ohara, Mochizuki, Yamanashi for a start!!\n\nGood luck..\n\n                                        Rod Johnson\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: caroabel2 \n  Sent: Thursday, October 16, 2003 1:28 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Hello from Cancun Mexico need help\n\n\n  I AM RESARCHING ABOUT A SAMURAI CREST (MON), &quot;THE THIRD DAY MOON&quot; \n  OR &quot;THE CRESCENT MOON&quot;, THAT WAS WORNE IN SOME HELMETS AND WAS \n  BELIVE TO PROVIDE STRONG ENERGY  &quot;KI&quot; TO THE SAMURAI, AND IF WAS A \n  FAMILY MOM?\n\n  ANY HELP  WILL BE  VERY APPRECIATED\n\n  THANKS\n  ABEL\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
