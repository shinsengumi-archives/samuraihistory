I&#39;ve got one last question that is if you want to answer it.

I noticed\nthat swords have something like a crest on the hilt\nand handle. Usually it is a dragon. Did they ever\nplace anyother sort of animal or symbol on the swords?\nThanks,\nRod\n\nHi\n\nIf your refering to the ornamanet under the hilt\nbinding that will be the Menuki. they come in all\nshapes and sizes, dragons, shrimps, swords, ink\nbrushes, buddhist items, coins, fish.\n\nOn one of my Katana I have a rat sat on a piece of\nwood with a rope on the wood, the rope and rat are\nover layed in gold.\n\nThe subject has limitless objects that were used\n\npaul\n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
