It\ngoes like this:\n\nOne day a man and a lion were walking together. They spotted a statue that\nshowed Hercules slaying a lion. The man said to the lion, &quot;this statue shows\nthat humans are superior to lions because you see a man slaying a lion.&quot;\nWhereupon the lion replied. &quot;A human being made that statue. How different\nthe portrayal would have been if a lion had made that statue.&quot;\n\nIn other words, historical documents are usually written by those who have\nreason to write their particular viewpoint into history. They are not always\nany more accurate than a maker of movies or a writer of fiction. Even a\ndocument that is contemporary to the period being studied could be filled\nwith propaganda, agendizing, and half-truths in order to push a particular\npoint of view. Also, a scholarly, non-fiction work could be written by\nsomeone with a ton of PHD letters behind their name and still be filled with\nagendizing for whatever point of view the writer is advocating. \n\nIf I were to view a film i.e. SEPPUKU or THE SEVEN SAMURAI or ZATOICHI or\nwhatever, and state without questioning or examining that &quot;this is the\nabsolute truth; it all happened just as the film depicted,&quot; that would be\ncareless to say the least. But if I were to read a historical work, let&#39;s\nsay by Yamamoto Tsunetomo or else by a modern writer with tons of letters\nbehind his/her name, tons of degrees, etc. and state without questioning or\nexamining that &quot;this is the absolute truth; it all happened just as the\nwriter depicted&quot; then I would be equally careless.    \n\nWhat a person must do is examine MANY of the existing sources, in whatever\nform that they exist. Then apply logic. Though being human beings, each with\nour own viewpoints and agendas, we will end up applying logic in different\nways. That&#39;s what makes discussions such as those on this list interesting.\n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of onnagozen\nSent: Wednesday, October 19, 2005 1:59 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?
