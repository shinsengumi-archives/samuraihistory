In terms of the question itself, surely a leader (anywhere) could be both dictator and unifier, they are not mutually exclusive terms.\nSprouting from the term &#39;unifier&#39; though I have a question? When was Japan unified? Considering, Hokkaiko was really only geographically part of Japan until the 18th and 19th Centuries, despite incursions and expeditions into the north dating back to the Asuka-jidai, and before; while the Nansei (SW) Islands (Okinawa, etc) were not part of Japan until the first decades of the Edo-jidai. \n \nM.Lorimer \n\n&quot;Anthony J.

He wasn&#39;t a total unifier, and he was hardly the first \n&quot;dictator&quot; -- whatever that may mean in feudal Japanese terms.\n\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
