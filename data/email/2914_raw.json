Whether the blade penetrated there or not, it the personis likely to bleed to death. Itd be like slicing across the jugular. I saw on a documentary &quot;Ancient Warriors&quot; on TLC a few years ago, that a slice from a katana could kill a man there in something like 8 seconds (I&#39;ll watch the video again to be sure, and let you  know if that number is off. Same thing as the wrists. Japanese armour doesnt do the greatest job at protecting the inner wrist.\n\nWilson\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Thu, 18 Dec 2003 00:35:14\nFrom: murphymurphyjohn@...\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\n&#39;Tis true...to a  point.  My purpose had two thrusts.  The question of the \nswords may end in a draw.  However,  the fact remains that in nearly ten \ncenturies,  the fatal flaw in armor,  under the arm pit,  was never addressed by \nJapanese armorers.  As a matter of fact, in Europe one can go back farther than \nthe Eleventh Century to find such protection,  Tom.  As early as the Third \nCentury AD, at the archaeologic site at Dura Europos, one finds among the \ncataphractii and clibinarii of the Persian and  Roman  cavalry full coverage, either in \nplate or scale armor, of this vital area.  Any thrust, there, of course would \npenetrate either lung or deeper in the heart itself.  As far as shields are \nconcerned,  they were used at least as early as the time of the Trojan War,  \ncirca  Thirteenth Century  BC,  Jack\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com \n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
