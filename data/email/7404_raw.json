While it\n&gt; does have quite a \n&gt; few pictures of &quot;black PJ clad assassins&quot; and other\n&gt; ahistorical ninja \n&gt; lore like the straight sword, this is done to\n&gt; illustrate how the ninja \n&gt; myth wormed its way into popular culture. No book on\n&gt; ninja would be \n&gt; complete without addressing the wild stories that\n&gt; have sprung up around \n&gt; them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n"
