Still, I have a\nfew comments as it relates to western conceptions/misconceptions of Japanese\nsamurai. \n\nKurosawa may have used some Western sources for some of his movies i.e.\nMacbeth, Red Harvest, King Lear. But he put a Japanese slant on all of these\nstories. I doubt that he was actually trying to emulate Shakespeare or\nDashiell Hammett. If he were, he would have set his films in England rather\nthan in Japan. \n\nSame with John Sturgis, the director of MAGNIFICENT SEVEN put an American\nslant on the SEVEN SAMURAI story. If he had really wanted to make a Japanese\nfilm, he would have set the film in Japan.Just because MAGNIFICENT SEVEN\ncame from a Japanese source, this doesn&#39;t make Sturgis a &quot;Japanese\ndirector.&quot; So therefore, I don&#39;t think that, in the same way, that you can\ncall Kurosawa a &quot;western director.&quot; Instead, one might say that these\ndirectors were influenced by the different cultures. \n\nNina\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of James Eckman\nSent: Tuesday, January 31, 2006 10:24 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: RE: Re: Re: Magnificent Seven\n\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Just because many Japanese think of Kurosawa as a Western director \n&gt;doesn&#39;t actually make him one. He was a Japanese director who took some \n&gt;of his inspiration from Western sources.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhy not? If some random American director closely followed the style and\nplots of  Mizoguchi or Ozu even if he made the settings American he would\nprobably be known as a &#39;Japanese&#39; director. Kurosawa films are great as\nfilms but weak on history and place many times.\n\n&gt;You are absolutely correct that film are not really good guides to \n&gt;actual history. Both films, in many ways, deal with mythologies. But \n&gt;the mythologies come from different cultures, different sources.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIn the case of several of the Kurosawa chanbara films the myths are western,\nKing Lear, MacBeth and Red Harvest. So your watching western myths in this\ncase. Once again not good for studying historic Japan.\n\n&gt;SEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the noble ronin who helps \n&gt;peasants. When in fact, most Japanese ronin were mostly interested in \n&gt;connecting with a clan. And they saw themselves as being apart from and \n&gt;superior to the farmers.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSince I&#39;m actually not sure of Kurosawa&#39;s source for the plot for this one,\nI won&#39;t make any definitive statements.  The noble ronin who helps peasants\ndoesn&#39;t play much of a role in traditional stories, why would you think its\nJapanese in this case?\n\n&gt;However, the realities from which these mythologies spring from are \n&gt;quite different. Once again: 19th century Western gunfighters were not \n&gt;the same at all as 17th century Japanese ronin.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNever said they were. Just that Kurosawa&#39;s chanbara films are more grounded\nin Western roots than in Japanese roots on the average. His films about\nmodern subject are more distinctly Japanese with plot resolutions that most\nAmericans won&#39;t enjoy. A good example would be &#39;The Bad Sleep Well&quot;.\n\nJim Eckman\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com Samurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
