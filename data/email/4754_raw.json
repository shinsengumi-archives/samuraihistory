I&#39;ve been searching around, but cant really find any info on \n&gt; Fusaie or why he also held the title.  anyone know?\n\nAlthough Hideyoshi is the most well known person to receive the \ntitle of Kampaku, it was actually passed down between several houses \nin turn in pretty much an unbroken line until Hideyoshi.\n\nThe houses of Konoe, Takatsuka, Kujo, Nijo, and Ichijo (offshoots of \nthe Fujiwara) all held the title, as well as Sessho (the aid to a \nchild emperor, as opposed to Kampaku, who was the aid to an adult \nemperor).\n\nOn this page, you&#39;ll find a full list of Sessho and Kampaku from 858-\n1868 (it&#39;s near the bottom):\nhttp://www.friesian.com/sangoku.htm\n\nIchijo Fusaie is listed under a different name, I think. I can&#39;t \nverify the accuracy of this list, but the post-Toyotomi Kampaku seem \nto stack up with other sources.\n\n\n"
