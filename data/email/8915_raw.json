In fact in my house, I have a vistor&#39;s rack, but few arrive at\nthe door with a sword in their obi these days. Actually I keep it for swords\nwhich are in my care for whatever reason, but that I do not own - call me\nold fashioned!!\nI do have a couple of antique single sword racks but to be perfectly honest\nI could not swear they were made to accomodate swords, maybe mirrors or\nscrolls or some such. I also have a rack for 5 swords, which is very handy,\na couple for 3 but mostly just for 2 swords. Naginata and yari all go on the\nwall.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dean Wayland&quot; &lt;dean@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, June 26, 2006 4:37 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] SWORD SETS\n\n\n&gt; Hi Clive,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Dean\n&gt; &gt;    Once again I crave the indulgence of the moderator if this is\n&gt; &gt;    considered a\n&gt; &gt;    little off-topic for this list, however....\n&gt;\n&gt; I think if we were discussing modern martial arts practise, I would\n&gt; expect the moderator to descend upon us, with his rendition of the wrath\n&gt; of God. But as we&#39;re actually interested in the etiquette of the bushi\n&gt; of the Sengoku-jidai, I think he&#39;ll let us off! Alternatively, at least\n&gt; he&#39;ll give us a head start:-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, thanks very much for the information it is invaluable. Arising out\n&gt; of your email, I have some additional questions:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Basically if sitting in seiza opposite another, it was customary to\n&gt; &gt;    remove\n&gt; &gt;    the katana from the obi and place it at your side, although, on\n&gt; &gt;    entering\n&gt; &gt;    another residence, the sword might be given to a page or servant\n&gt; &gt;    for safe\n&gt; &gt;    storage to be collected when leaving.\n&gt;\n&gt; When entering a public building, was the practise much the same, i.e.\n&gt; inns, drinking establishments etc.?  I have read that in some places a\n&gt; rack for this purpose was kept by the entrance, is this correct?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Rules of sword etiquette\n&gt; &gt;    still\n&gt; &gt;    applies today although the bloody consequences of poor etiquette\n&gt; &gt;    are less\n&gt; &gt;    likely, however, good etiquette shows the difference between the\n&gt; &gt;    educated\n&gt; &gt;    gentlemen and the less well educated. It is unlikely that you will\n&gt; &gt;    be able\n&gt; &gt;    to view important swords in Japan (on a hands-on basis) such as\n&gt; &gt;    National\n&gt; &gt;    Treasures etc.unless you have already shown that you fall into the\n&gt; &gt;    &quot;educated\n&gt; &gt;    gentleman&quot; catagory.\n&gt;\n&gt; H&#39;mm, sadly, in my case, regardless of how well I become educated, it\n&gt; would not be possible for me to study any weapon that closely. My\n&gt; eyesight is so poor that I would need to be so near as to damage the\n&gt; surface with my breath. Oh wll...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    As for No-dachi, I guess they can do whatever they want!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Likewise their owner!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;although\n&gt; &gt;    more\n&gt; &gt;    seriously, I prefer a katana-kake as oversized swords are less well\n&gt; &gt;    balanced\n&gt; &gt;    on a tachi-kake.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sounds like a sensible policy. I&#39;ve seen modern katana-kake designed for\n&gt; a single sword, but did such things exist earlier? You sometimes see\n&gt; large calibre teppou displayed on stands like this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours\n&gt;\n&gt; Dean\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Dean Wayland\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
