(Difficult without records.)\n\nWithout getting into a discussion on the mythical status of the\nninja, I am trying to determine (purely for myself) how the daimyo \nutilised ninja, and how effective they were.\n\nIn my opinion, I reckon their best contribution was in gathering\nintelligence on the enemy, mostly by watching, which would involve \nlong periods spent in enemy domains. Spying, in fact.\n\nThe more theatrical activities - assassination being the most obvious\n- I think had little or no influence on the general outcome - and was \nprobably not employed as much as everyone likes to think. \nThey might have had a more tactical short-term effect, but cannot be \nguaranteed. (Koyama Castle, in my former post, remained in Takeda \nhands even after the murder of its commander - but perhaps Amari&#39;s \ndeath stopped his incursions into Mikawa.\n\nI&#39;m sure most daimyo could find samurai in their own ranks willing to\nundertake hazardous missions without resorting to employing\noutsiders.\n\nIn another tale, a samurai noted for his shinobi skills slipped out\nof his beseiged castle, stole the besieger&#39;s standard, and put it\nover the main gate for all too see, as a taunt and insult to the \nbesieger and a blow to their morale while boosting their own.\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
