Japan was not a country at \nthat \n&gt; time, but MANY countries. Many nations. \n&gt; So, he did exactly the same, including genocide against people who \ndisagreed \n&gt; with him or hated religions... Just like Hitler... \n\n\nI think making analogies of this kind can be tricky, different \ncircumstances. That said, I&#39;d look for a less extreme analogy-For \ninstance Julius Caesar: Someone who is seen as ambitious and \nruthless, but known as both as a destroyer of an old order(republican \nrome) as well as a pioneer of a new order(roman empire). Also, like \nNobunaga, Caesar&#39;s ambitions were fully realized by another not long \nafter his demise.\n\nC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
