Do you think Hisamitsu was discouraged by \nthe \n&gt; failure of koubu-gattai to advance Satsuma&#39;s interests and \nrealised he \n&gt; need Saigo&#39;s talents to represent the han? (Saigo was sent almost \n&gt; immediately to Kyoto.)  Jansen (Sakamoto Ryouma and the Meiji \n&gt; Restoration p.191)  says that at this time toubaku was being \nexpressed \n&gt; much more in Satsuma: maybe the Choushuu situation and general \n&gt; increase in anti-bakufu feeling also influenced Hisamitsu&#39;s \ndecision.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps one of the Oukubo biographies would shed more light on \nthis. \n&gt; Does your university library have them?\n&gt; \n&gt; Gillian\n\n\n\n\n"
