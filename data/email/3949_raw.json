To me &quot;Musashi&quot; is the first set of sounds of a \n&gt; name of \n&gt; &gt;a sumo heya (Musashigawa) and part of the shikona of the last yokozuna to \n&gt; &gt;retire (Musashimaru), and that was the only thing I associated it with.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; How about Takezo?\n&gt; \n\n       Never heard of him.  I&#39;ve only been a fan of ozumo for about a year \nand a half (since Kyushu 2k2, when Asashoryu began the final stage of his run to \nthe top).  My favourites became, and remain, Ozeki Kaio, Georgian Maegashira \nKokkai, Russian Juryo Roho and (now) the Yokozuna, the aforementioned \nAsashoryu.  And yeah, I&#39;m having a whole lot of fun with this basho!  :-D  Take care.  \n:-D\n\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
