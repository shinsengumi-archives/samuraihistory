However, during my search I was very surprised to\nfind an excellent and &quot;local&quot; Kyudo club not far from myself here in\nStevenage, in the village of Cottered, North Hertfordshire, just off the\nA1(M) Junction 9, run by a very friendly and competent chap named Adrian\nHall, his web site is at:\n\nhttp://www.heijoshin.com/\n\nOr you can contact him at:\n\nmailto://adrian.hall@...\n\nor phone him on 07885 061151\n\n(details taken from his web page)\n\nHope you find this useful\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\n(Dean Wayland)\n\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
