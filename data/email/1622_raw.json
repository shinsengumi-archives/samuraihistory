This changes the distance between opponents and confuses the \nrighty as he is used to fighting other righties.\n\t During Tokugawa times left-handedness likely would have been \nan impediment to ones career so discouraged. During the sengoku \nuniform movement of large groups of men would have required \nleft-handedness to be trained out of a soldier as it is today I \nbelieve. However, in this same era  if one were born of sufficient \nrank you might have been allowed to be a lefty especially if it meant \nyou excelled at the martial arts. Standing out on the battlefield was \nwhat one wanted unlike today (nails and all...). Though I have yet to \nhear of &quot;the famous left-handed general...&quot;\n\tKeep in mind also that Musashi is believed by many to have \nbeen a south-paw, thus making it only natural for him to pick up that \nsecond sword...\n\tStill struggling with the right hand,\nTom\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
