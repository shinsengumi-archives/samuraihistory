Prof Murphy\n\n\nConsidering the question posed about sword metals,  to my knowledge,  all or\nmost of the extant samurai  blades are of steel,  or possibly the most early\nJapanese swords of iron.  In the Middle East,  bronze was used as a metal for\nswords in the early Dynasties of Egypt...\n All the best,  Professor Murphy,  The Japan Foundation\n\n\n"
