But only a handful of soldiers joined him.\n&gt; Everyone else shouted him down as a crazy man. He\n&gt; committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.\n\nNo, there wasn&#39;t. There was a WRITER (not a general),\nMishima Yukio, who was disenchanted with what post-war\nJapan had become, and attempted to get the Japanese\n&quot;West Point&quot; cadets to join him in an abortive coup\nattempt. When NO ONE followed him, he committed\nsuicide at the Defense Academy in Ichigaya. I&#39;ve stood\non the spot where he committed seppuku. Everyone\nthought he was a madman because he WAS a madman. Have\nyou read any of his books? Whacko. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
