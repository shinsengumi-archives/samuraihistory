One of his victims is a Filipino, named Lorenzo \nRuiz, who travelled with Catholic priests, after escaping Spanish \ninjustice back in the Philippines. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Lorenzo and his companions were caught doing Catholic missions in \nJapan. Before and during torture Ieyasu made an offer, &quot;renounce \ntheir faith and they wil be spared&quot;. The missionaries did not accept \nthe offer except for one who was also killed later on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Lorenzo and his group were tortured using water poured in their \nmouth using a funnel while torturers put a plank of wood on their \nstomachs as they see-sawed on in. Needles were stuck between the \nfingernails and the flesh. \n&gt;  \n&gt; When no one gave up, Ieyasu ordered the missionaries to be hung \nupside down in separate wells. the wells&#39; mouth was then closed as \nthe prisoners hung. Most of the group, including Lorenzo perished \nafter ten days. They were taken out of the well, beheaded, burned, \nand their ashes scattered to the sea.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Lorenzo Ruiz was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the early 1980s \nfor being a layman in a group of priests yet did not renounce his \nfaith.\n&gt;  \n&gt; He is now known as Saint Lorenzo Ruiz after His cannonization in \nVatican by the Pope in the the early 1990s.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu really enforced his laws and policies. \n&gt; \n\n\nThis Lorenzo Ruis was killed in about 1636, a good twenty years \nAFTER Ieyasu died of old age, and as such had no involvement in the \ndeath of Ruis.\n\n\n\n\n"
