I love it! I too, am a writer using the samuai culture in a book i am writing, but mine is not in japan, it&#39;s another world all together, but my pelines&#39; are based upon allot of the ancient samurai. but I CAN&#39;T WAIT for your book to come out! I will definaetly read it! Get a great cover illustrator, too. It sound like a real HOT book.\n\nLilith &lt;lillith.saintcrow@...&gt; wrote:\nHey everyone,\n\nThanks for letting me post this. I appreciate all the wonderful help \nand support I&#39;m receiving from this list! And for the listmember who \nasked about copyright: if I can prove I am the owner of this email \naddress, posting a short chapter here actually proves my copyright, \nso no worries about that. Good question, though!\n\nBelow please find a short chapter that details the premise of the \nbook, tentatively titled &quot;Snowfire.&quot; If there is anything that seems \nillogical in it, or you would like to correct for historical accuracy \n(even though this _is_ a fantasy) please don&#39;t hesitate! I&#39;m only \n10,000 words into the book and want to catch any illogicalities (is \nthat even a word?) while the work is relatively young. So, without \nfuther ado...\n\n---\n\n\n"
