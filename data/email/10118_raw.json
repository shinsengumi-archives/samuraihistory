What strikes me as I read what you guys are\ntalking about is that =\r\nin this book, it&#39;s all about your name. Your name,\nyour family is the prima=\r\nry thing. Next comes banners and emblems, which\ndisplay family type things.=\r\n Next comes the heirloom swords and forged\nobjects.

At least\nthat&#39;s the way I read The Taiheiki.\n\nPrevi=\r\nously almost all my sense of Japanese samurai culture came from samurai\nfil=\r\nms.

But =\r\nnow that I&#39;m reading the actual history, I&quot;m getting a much\nbetter picture.=\r\n It was who you are and what your reputation is, who your\nfamily is, where =\r\nyou are from, and who you are connected to. In that order.\nEverything else =\r\nappears to be a distant second.
