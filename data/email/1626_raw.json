Is \n&gt; your dominant hand closest to the tsuba? As was noted if your wear \n&gt; and wield the sword as a righty then you have an advantage (use of \n&gt; the left hand is key in Japanese swordsmanship). If your sword is \non \n&gt; your right hip, aren&#39;t you forever committing saya-ate?\n&gt; -tom\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\nThats a good question,i should have answered that in my first post.\nok,i wear my sword on my left side,and yes my dominant hand is on the \nsuba,i`m not so sure it would give me much adavantage,it would depend \nwho you was facing at the time.\nAnd yes you would be right,had my sword been on my right side,i would \nbe commiting saya-ate,i dont think that being left handed make`s a \nlot of difference really,i have tried drawing the sword useing my \nleft hand,and to be honest i found it very difficult and i could not \nresheath the blade afterwards,but thats just me,you may well get \ndifferent replys from other people.\nHope that helps you ....dave\n\n\n"
