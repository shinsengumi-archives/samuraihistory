Now, the\n&gt; problem is that, even \n&gt; today, it would be impossible to have 1,000 people\n&gt; to shoot exactly in \n&gt; synchro fashion, especially with a 16th c. weapon.\n&gt; So, the number of \n&gt; shooters might have been inflated by Nobunaga&#39;s\n&gt; side, just to impress \n&gt; the other daimyo.\n&gt; Dr.Varley told me that there is a new article by one\n&gt; of his colleagues \n&gt; (sorry, forgot to ask who) that examines the battle\n&gt; from a \n&gt; historical/martial point of view. It is not\n&gt; published, but he&#39;ll let me \n&gt; have a copy--so, I&#39;ll be back to you once I have\n&gt; read it.\n&gt; cepo, honolulu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
