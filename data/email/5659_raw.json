Far from an homage to the Shintaro \nKatsu films, th=\r\nis new film is a goof, maybe even a satire, mixing \nslapstick-ish comedy an=\r\nd horror- flick bloodletting, not to mention \na showy but incongruous River=\r\ndance-style dance number that&#39;s still \ngot me scratching my coconut. \n\nIt&#39;s=\r\n as if Kitano =97 one of the masters of the gangster-film genre \nin Japan =\r\n=97 wants to counter the earnest, Quentin Tarantino-esque, we-\nare-not-wort=\r\nhy super-reverence often afforded to the samurai genre \nby dropping his pan=\r\nts at the idolaters.\n\nKitano =97 working, as is his wont as an actor, under=\r\n the name Beat \nTakashi =97 plays the title character, a wandering masseuse=\r\n who, \ndespite his blindness, is a deadly assassin with the sword. (It&#39;s a =\r\n\ngood thing the old man&#39;s blind, considering what someone did to his \nhair.=\r\n Kitano wears a burst of pillowy white hair, making him look \nlike Billy Id=\r\nol&#39;s Japanese grandpa.)\n\nThe story, set in the pre-industrial 19th-century =\r\nJapanese \ncountryside, will be somewhat familiar to any fan of samurai epic=\r\ns \n(or Hollywood Westerns). A small village is being intimidated by the \nco=\r\nrrupt Ginzo gang, regularly extorting money from townspeople who \nbarely ha=\r\nve any. Meanwhile, a brother-sister pair of geishas (the \nbrother is a cros=\r\ns-dresser) plot revenge against another gang for \nmurdering their family. \n=\r\n\nZatoichi just happens to be passing through. Thanks to a kindly \nwidow and=\r\n her affable but screwy nephew, he gets involved in the \ntown&#39;s struggles a=\r\ngainst the Ginzo gang and meets the aggrieved \ngeishas.\n\nAs played by Kitan=\r\no, Zatoichi is stooped and unremarkable, always \nlaughing at some internal =\r\ndialogue. He seems serenely unaware of his \nsurroundings, until he attacks,=\r\n then he&#39;s possessed of exquisitely \ncalibrated senses that allow him to ki=\r\nll with precision without \ngetting a scratch.\n\nThe violence here is a mix o=\r\nf brutal realism and cartoony absurdity. \nFor some unfathomable reason, Kit=\r\nano created computer-generated \nflows of blood that look faker than anythin=\r\ng you&#39;ll see in a Pixar \nfilm, as if the film were little more than an exer=\r\ncise in \nincongruity (cheesy CGI blood in a period film?). \n\nZatoichi&#39;s fig=\r\nht scenes are done with swift and deadly force, but \nwhen he tosses his swo=\r\nrd across the room and it slides effortlessly \ninto his sheath on the fly, =\r\nwell, I only envision &quot;Three Stooges&quot; \ntricks.\n\nOnly someone with the creat=\r\nive verve of Kitano =97 an accomplished \npainter, poet and cartoonist and a=\r\n highly visible TV presence in \nJapan =97 could get away with such slapdash=\r\n audacity. The film&#39;s \njerky changes of tone will likely prevent you from r=\r\nelaxing and \nenjoying the narrative. But if you like to see what happens wh=\r\nen an \nartist is unbound by notions of dramatic consistency, this one will =\r\n\nhave you dancing in the aisles, like everyone else on screen.\n\nContact Wal=\r\nlace Baine at wbaine@....\n\nIf You Go\nWHAT: `Zatoichi: The=\r\n Blind Swordsman.&#39;\n\nRATING: R: Graphic stylized violence and bloodshed.\n\nWH=\r\nERE: The Nickelodeon, 426-7500.\n\nLENGTH: 1 hour, 56 minutes.\n\nVERDICT: C+.\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
