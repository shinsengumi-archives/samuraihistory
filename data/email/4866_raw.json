I\ngave you born/died, father, and son...I&#39;ll see if I\ncan dig up anything on other kids, etc. As fas as at\nany major historical happenings, you could argue he\nmissed all those--too young for Sekigahara, being born\nin 1595. Though he would have been 20 at the siege of\nOsaka, so that gives you something there to work with,\npossibly. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
