It&#39;s about the\n&gt; &gt; movie The Last\n&gt; &gt; Samurai, the lead samurai Katsumoto&#39;s head&#39;s shaven.\n&gt; &gt; I though that\n&gt; &gt; this was a sign of disgrace among samurai, or that\n&gt; &gt; they had\n&gt; &gt; relinquished to a priest&#39;s life...why did he have\n&gt; &gt; his head shaved?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Miburo\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;That bothered me too (and I notice these things,\n&gt; &gt;having no hair and all that). It usually was shaved if\n&gt; &gt;the person took religious vows. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; It might have to do with the fact that he&#39;s been dealing with\nLeukemia for a few \n&gt; years now.....\n\n\n"
