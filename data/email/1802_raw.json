I\njust found out Nottingham castle museum has several\nsets that have been mothballed for maybe 20 years.\nthey havent a clue whats in the crates apart from -\njapanese armour.\n\nThe set they have on display in the castle is\nbeautiful but unfortunately the sunate are upside\ndown. Not that anyone would notice (same as in Trident\narms in nottingham the antique arms dealer there had a\nYoroi mounted back to front LOL)\n\nCheers\n\npaul\n\n--- &quot;shogun.uk&quot; &lt;shogun.uk@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nHi Paul\n\nA quick response which may generate some discussion\nfrom our learnered body!\n\nI remember seeing a strange device at Snowshill Manor,\nBroadway, some years ago - it was a japanese, vertical\ndevice with an arrangement of springs and levers\ndating from the 17th century. On enquiring its\npurposer, I was told it was a device for measuring\ntime elapsed... It appears that our &quot;western&quot; day of\n24hours was divided into two parts, being night and\nday. Nothing strange there until it was pointed out\nthat night = sunset to sunrise and day = sunrise to\nsunset. Now the &quot;clever bit&quot; - of course through the\nyear the number of hours from sunrise to sunset varies\nbut there had to be a similar time period night and\nday {whatever it was say for now 6 periods!} ie\nvarying &quot;hours&quot;. The device was so made to compensate\nfor seasonal changes... I suppose thinking about it we\nhad sundials (but little sun!) before chronometers\ncame along.....\n\nWell thats a start anyway.... and if you are in the\nCotswolds Area make sure you visit Snowshill (National\nTrust) it had a unique collection of &quot;samurai&quot; armour.\n\n          Rod Johnson\n\n\n&lt;Hi\n\nI was wondering what is the medievil Japanese method\nof time keeping.\n\nI have heard of it being in 2 hour segments named\nafter animals but I am unsure if this is correct.\n\nAnd just how did they maintain the method of keeping\ntime.\n\nIn the UK in ancient times they used to mark a candle\nwith one hour segments. I just wondered if they did\nthe same \n\nPaul&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
