Rather they\nlived in an overtly-patriarchal society where masculine virtues were \nheld in high regard (higher than the feminine) and consequently found \na physical outlet.\n\nAll overtly-patriarchal societies are marked by same-gender sexual\nactivity - Greece (as you mention) particularly Sparta, Japan, \nthe English Public School, etc. etc.\n\nMany notable samurai had &#39;close companions&#39; - notably Oda Nobunaga\nand Uesugi Kenshin, and I believe Takeda Shingen and Tokugawa \nIeyasu have been hinted at.\n\nThere are instructions in &quot;Hagakure&quot; for the proper arrangements (can\nwe say courtship) between samurai, and the film Gohatto (which by \nthe way has some splendid sword-play sequences) focusses on just \nthis point.\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
