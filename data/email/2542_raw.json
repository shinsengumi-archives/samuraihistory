The &quot;chi&quot; is not the same Chi you \nare thinking of. Chinese and Japanese are based on pictographs; kanji. \nThey may have different &quot;readings&quot; but usually maintain very specific \nmeanings thus the character for energy, vitality (KI) can also be read \nas chi. Or is it the other way round? Any way I learned the Japanese \nreadings which are in the end based on Chinese ones.\n\tThe character for tachi is usually but not always two characters which \nare read O,Dai (big) and To,Katana(sword) seperately but &quot;tachi&quot; when \nin compound. The tachi in the words Odachi, Nodachi, itodachi and \nkenukigatatachi is all one word one idea with no emphasis on &quot;chi.&quot; \nSeperate the chi and it loses meaning. Don&#39;t feel I&#39;m trouncing on you \neverytime I ask my Japanese friends questions like this I get the same \nlecture...\n-t\n\n\n"
