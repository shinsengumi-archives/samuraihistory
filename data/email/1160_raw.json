Can you give me some information on the orgin of the samurai?\nA: They evolved out of military and house servants of the Heian \nperiod.  The term samurai is the Japanese pronounciation of a sankrit \nword that means &quot;to serve&quot;.  There is a book entitled HIRED SWORDS: \nTHE RISE OF PRIVATE WARRIOR POWER IN EARLY JAPAN by Karl Friday.\n  \n2. What was the final outcome of the civil war between the Taira clan \nand the Minamoto clan?\nA:The Taira were eliminated.  Minamoto Yoritomo was declared Shogun, \nand he ordered his brother Yoshitsune executed, but Yoshitsune took \nhis own life.  Yoshitsune is still considered one of the greates \nwarriors in Japanese history.\n\n3. What weapons and armour were preferred by the samurai?\nA:Durring the time of warfare the spear was the most commonly used \nweapon.  Both foot soldiers and samurai were armed with spears as \nthey were seen as the most practical.  Durring the time of peace \nafter the Tokugawa re-unification is when the sword became the main \nweapon of the samurai, although it had always been a symbol of the \nwarrior, it was secondary until that time.\n\n4. How did the samurai view death?\nA:  The samurai did not seek death in battle, but accepted the fact \nthat he might die.  \n\n5. What eventually led to the downfall of the samurai?\nA:  In a simple way uselessness caused the fall of the samurai.  When \nthe emporer tried to regain power the samurai class had not been in a \nmajor battle in about 200 years and couldnt put up a real fight \nagainst the clans like Choshu and Satsuma that backed the Emporer.  \nBut the emporer did not want to risk the samurai becoming powerfull \nagain so the clas was abolished in 1868.\n\nPlease someone correct me if I am wrong.  I hope these answers will \ngive you at least a starting point.\n\n\n\n"
