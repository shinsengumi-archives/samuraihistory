It was a rescue mission. I&#39;ve heard this from the very mouths \nof those there.\nThat&#39;s nice that you saw sick things on both sides. Its a very \ntragic conflict there, similar to the Israel-Palestine problem. I \ndon&#39;t know which side you were on. So let&#39;s use the Holocaust \nproblem instead. You&#39;re a Jewish man who has led a good life. You \nserved your country (Germany) in peace and war.\nYou are thrown in a concentration camp. There, you make guns. You \nstart to smuggle parts of guns and whole guns away. Eventually, \nbefore being transported to Aushwitz, you riot on the train, \nultimately jumping off to freedom.\nOr say you&#39;re a soldier. You went to war for USA, and you are moving \ninto Poland. You come across a concentration camp. You never knew \nthey even existed. You never knew such a thing COULD exist. You free \nthe prisoners, do what you can for them. You learn there are more \ncamps, with more men, women, and children. With new motivation and \nfervor you drive forward.\nBoth very dishonorable things, indeed. My two uncles were \nrespectively monsters. The Nazis should never have been stopped. \nJeeze, you&#39;re right. I do apologize.\nOh, and neither men even knew anything about the Japanese camps back \nin California.\nNo, I&#39;m too young to have fought in any wars yet. But it&#39;s looking \nlike I will, eventually.\nAnd being the descendant of both the prisoner and the rescuer in a \nwar-time situation, I&#39;ll make as many worthwhile contributions as I \nfreaking please.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, james wallis \n&lt;kentguy212002@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; you call someone an idiot because you dont agree with there \nopinions i spent 8 years fighting in northern ireland i saw many \nsick things on both sides. the allied troops were doing there duty \nthere is a HUGE difference between duty and honour. And wat about \nall the us citizens of japanese origin that were herded up and put \ninto camps in california. If uve fought in a war and seen death and \nwat it does to a person then u may make a worthwhile contribution . \nidiot\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle Segall &lt;klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yeah. God forbid those dishonorable allied troops stopped nazi \n&gt; germany from exterminating six million Jewish people. Jeeze. Why \ndid \n&gt; they have to go and do that? I sure know the life of me and my \n&gt; family would be so much better if they hadn&#39;t done those \n&gt; dishonorable things.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes, I&#39;m being snappy this time, and I won&#39;t applogize. If you \n&gt; think war is all evil and dishonor... you&#39;re an idiot.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kentguy212002&quot; \n&gt; &lt;kentguy212002@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; loyalty and honour are two different things.
