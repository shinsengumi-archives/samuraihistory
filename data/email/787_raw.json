I think someone stuck an extra vowel in there. But\nhonestly, whether it should be &quot;taneko&quot; or even &quot;taniko&quot; I couldn&#39;t say. And\ngiven the great number of homophones in Japanese, the typical response must\nbe, &quot;without the kanji the question &#39;what does it mean&#39; is itself\nmeaningless.&quot;\n\n&gt; As for &#39;Torakami&#39; - it isn&#39;t a word, and if the two characters\n&gt; were seen together they would be read something like &#39;kojin&#39; -\n&gt; although I doubt that&#39;s a word.\n\nFrankly, that was my first inclination, as well. But then again, I&#39;ve been\ndoing too much lately with archaic Chinese stuff, so the Sino-Japanese\nreading came to mind first. I&#39;d like to be able to say &quot;Tora no kami&quot; hit me\nfirst, but I have to get my head back into some Muromachi texts for a while\nto reformat my mind-set. &lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt; Like another poster on here stated,\n&gt; &#39;tora no tamashii&#39; would litteraly mean &#39;spirit of the tiger&#39;.\n\nIndeed it would; but it wouldn&#39;t be a name, either. The thing is, names\ndon&#39;t really literally translate well. Heck, I used to live in Stone Well\nMouth Public Field, commuting to work via Western Samurai Pond Bag and then\nto Circle Center. Later I moved to There Are Turtles, and after that lived\nin Big Eternal Preservation. (That is, Shakujii Koen, Seibu Ikebukuro,\nMarunouchi, Kameari, and Ogikubo &lt;G&gt;.)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Toranokami would be pretty cool, but I don&#39;t know how well it would\n&gt; fit in &#39;reality&#39; since all of the ~no kamis were always preceeded by\n&gt; the name of a province.\n\nAh, but that&#39;s a kami of a different color. &lt;G&gt;\n\nTony\n\n\n"
