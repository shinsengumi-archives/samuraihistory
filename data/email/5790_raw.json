Morse,\noriginally published in 1895, is still one of the best. Profusely\nillustrated by his own drawings, plenty of details of many types of\ntraditional Japanese dwellings in great detail. Morse was an\nincredible observer and very competent draftsman with a wonderful eye\nfor detail.\n\nFortunately this book is available in a fairly inexpensive Dover\nreprint edition that should do well for your son&#39;s purposes.\n\nCraig Harris                                                 Bridge of\nDreams, LLC\nBooks from and about Asia                                     o: 847 696-9774\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com                                        c: 847-846-7701\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 20 Oct 2004 11:21:10 -0700, Allison &lt;peaceluv@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello Samurai Historians,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a homeschooling Mom looking for some specific resources re: Samurai\n&gt; history. Thanks for the great information on this list!\n&gt; \n&gt; My son (11) is quite interested in this subject and would like to build his\n&gt; own miniature &quot;Samurai House&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I am looking for are diagrams, pictures, drawings, floor plans, etc.\n&gt; of what might be considered a typical Samurai House. I realize that in\n&gt; history, most things are rarely &quot;typical&quot; ! Again, this is for a homeschool\n&gt; project, and I have searched the internet many times and really don&#39;t know\n&gt; quite how to get the info I&#39;m looking for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any clues?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Allison\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Yahoo!
