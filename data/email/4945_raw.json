Being Japanese doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re required\nto commit seppuku. \n\nYou&#39;re thinking of Mishima Yukio, the author. It\nwasn&#39;t at a television station, it was at Ichigaya,\nthe then military academy, now the headquarters of the\nJapan Defense Agency (think the Japanese Pentagon).\nI&#39;ve stood in the spot where he did the deed. It\nwasn&#39;t simply a protest, it was a botched and horribly\nfailed attempt to get the students to rise up in a\ncoup--they laughed at him, and he withdrew to attempt\nhis fairly botched suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
