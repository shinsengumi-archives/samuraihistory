I thought this was\na public mail list. I have seen you comment on things\nthat were directed at others before.\n\nI suppose now if an email comes through that does not\nhave my name on it I am supposed to ignore it. Helly\nis in the Bujinkan so am I, he hasnt seen the fdilm I\nhave. \n\nI have supported both of you and also told you where I\nthink you are wrong.\n\nI like you dont think Hayes is a source of good info,\nbut there are others on that film, including manaka \nfumio, a japanese who has researched Ninjutsu history.\n\nHow about we leave this now until its out and people\nknow what they are talking (or maybe think they do)\nhave seen it.\n\npaul\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\n\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; HI \n&gt; \n&gt; if you read what we said then you would not have\n&gt; posted your critism.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did state that this was not anything like the\n&gt; hollywood version of ninja\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul\n\nAnd if you&#39;ll read my reply, it was to Helly, not to\nyou--and was posted before yours was, so I couldn&#39;t\nhave read yours, now could I? \n\nHowever, any connection with Hayes certainly SUGGESTS\nthat the research is questionable, at best. I don&#39;t\nknow Helly--and I&#39;ve seen too many ninja fanatics here\nto accept his say-so that this is legit. Forgive me,\nbut with a connection to Hayes it&#39;s guilty until\nproven innocent. I didn&#39;t reply to you in the same\nmanner, as you&#39;ve been around on the board, post\nintelligently, and don&#39;t strike me as the &quot;wannabe&quot;\nninja type. If you&#39;re endorsing this, then fine--I&#39;ll\nfully admit there is a chance it&#39;s not crap, but\nagain, any connection with Hayes makes it doubtful, at\nleast until I see it. Too many documentaries simply\ntry to capitalize on the hype (exhibit a-n: any\ndocumentary made during the &quot;Last Samurai&quot; hype)\nwithout doing any real research. \n\n\n\n\n            \nYahoo!
