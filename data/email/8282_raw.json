I thought that this \nwas only true when Toyotomi Hideyoshi turned Japan society into a caste \nsystem (so that no one else could do what he did. ;-) ) and that before \nthat there was a lot more fluidity in the social classes.  I know the \nstrict caste system is portrayed for Japan in almost all the &quot;Japanese&quot; \nRPGs that are played these days.  (The only exception I know of is \nLegends of the Samurai, which to me is an excellent RPG).\n\nDan Cooper\n\n\n\n"
