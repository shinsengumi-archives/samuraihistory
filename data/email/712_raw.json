They had there\nGenpuku thus were\nadults and strapped on an adult sword. in the Edo period young boys may have worn a tanto if they were\nof a good family\nbut didn&#39;t wear swords in public until their coming of age.\n    The swords we see in tachi mounts made by well known names are actually kazari tachi. Light elegant\nsometimes flashy\nlittle blades for courtiers or for ceremonial. NOT for boys but for adults who needed to wear a sword but\ndidn&#39;t need to\nlug around a 3 shaku nambokucho blade to attend some eight hour paper wasting ceremony (still\npopular today).\n    Does anyone have evidence or reference to how we came to call these boys&#39; swords or boy&#39;s day\nswords? Is there\nsomewhere definitive scholarship on what boys wore, if anything?\n\nTom &#39;big boy&#39; Helm\n\n\n\n\n"
