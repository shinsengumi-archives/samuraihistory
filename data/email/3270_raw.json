However if\nyou do the Meiji Restoration and Samurai Rebelions of\n1876-1877 you with have a more defined topic. The\nBegining of the Buke and their rise to prominance in\nJapan covers much of the Heian Period. Were as the\nlast years of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Meiji\nRestoration and Satsuma Rebelion is more defined and\nmore accurate information is available. Your talking\nseveral decades as appossed to several centuries. \n\nBut its your paper you do what you feel your most\ncomfortable with.\n--- coeli jimenez &lt;coeli_tensai@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; hi..\n&gt;  \n&gt; i need some help. i am supposed to write an\n&gt; argumentative paper for my language class. my chosen\n&gt; topic is:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Which is better, the &quot;original&quot; samurai (those who\n&gt; started the military class) or the &quot;last&quot; samurai\n&gt; (tokugawa to meiji eras)?\n&gt;  \n&gt; can anybody help me please? i need facts and notes,\n&gt; as well as ideas about the whole thing. i would\n&gt; appreciate it if you can email me personally..\n&gt;  \n&gt; thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Coeli\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Yahoo!
