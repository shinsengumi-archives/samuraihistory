The others are Fujiko Mine and Daisuke \nJigen. Lupin III is the grandson of the infamous Arsene Lupin the suave and \nsophisticated art thief from 1920&#39;s France. The most famous duo to play\nthe roles of Lupin and his nemesis on the Surete in Paris were the \nBarrymores. The father (Lionel) played the Surete inspector whose name I \ndon&#39;t recall (in Lupin III anime he is named Zenigato and is a bumbling \nidiot a la Peter Sellers&#39; Inspector Clouseau character in the &quot;pink Panther&quot; \nfilms) while the son (John) played Lupin himself to perfection. Goemon&#39;s \nvoice is Lex Lang who also voices Sagara Sanosuke on Rurouni Kenshin. In \nLupin Goemon is a &quot;jiti lito&quot;(spelling) master and uses a\nkatana with amazing speed and accuracy. He can also predict Lupin&#39;s fate by \nthe &quot;shadow&quot; on the\nblade. Cool! We never knew that there was a REAL Goemon in Japanese history. \nWonder if Jigen and Fujicakes have similar correlations? There WAS a real \nart thief/swindler named Arsene Lupin in France but he was earlier than the \n1920&#39;s. We believe that David Niven&#39;s &quot;Raffles&quot; character was based on \nLupin. BTW, Lupin III is on Sunday(early Monday) through Thursday(early \nFriday) evenings at 1:30 AM EDT/EST (1 AM on Sundays) on the Cartoon \nNetwork. Channel 58 on Comcast here in\nBrookhaven PA-USA. Check it out if ya want-we&#39;ll answer any questions you \nhave too.

I liked it,\n&gt;but unlike when I watch Hideyoshi or Nobunaga or Aoi\n&gt;Sandai, for example, I&#39;m not all that familiar with\n&gt;the story. Any recommendations (in English, if\n&gt;possible...I&#39;ve got my fill translating military\n&gt;documents for the moment) of books to check out that\n&gt;can give me a roadmap here? I&#39;m vaguely familiar with\n&gt;Sakamoto Ryoma from history class, but was a little\n&gt;confused with Kondo Isami and the guy he was chasing\n&gt;in the beginning of the show, but apparently was\n&gt;friends with 10 years before (when they flashed\n&gt;back--William Letham, I know you watched it last\n&gt;night, help with his name??).\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for the assitance--I was surprised a little\n&gt;with Katori Shingo&#39;s performance (good, so far) and of\n&gt;course as it has Sawaguchi Yasuko in it, I&#39;m happy.\n&gt;Another question for William--is the woman playing\n&gt;Kondo Isami&#39;s mother the same woman who was\n&gt;Mitsuhide&#39;s mother in &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;?? Sokkuri but I\n&gt;couldn&#39;t catch the name.\n&gt;\n&gt;Speaking of Hideyoshi, Kitsuno, I see you&#39;ve got\n&gt;Ishikawa Goemon as the Samurai of the Month on the\n&gt;website--I just watched the episode where he gets\n&gt;boiled in oil...a little different than the\n&gt;description you&#39;ve got, eh?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks all!\n&gt;\n&gt;Mata!\n&gt;\n&gt;Nate\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
