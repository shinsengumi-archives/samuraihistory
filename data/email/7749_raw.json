He changed his name further\ninto Takada Genbe. \n\nHe was short, his jaw and cheekbone was sharp. He was\nalways calm and he was unyielding. And, he was very\ngentle.\n\nThough He was born in Komori Family in Kumamoto, he\nbecame a foster-child of Kawakami Family, and became a\nBuddhist priest. (When there was a big earthquake and\nall people were running away, he extinguished the fire\nof a brazier, and he was accepted by many people. It\nwas said that it was regrettable that He&#39;s a Buddhist.\nBuddhist priest&#39;s position was convenient to study.\nThen, a study of the soldier was learned by Miyabe\nTeizo, and literature and swordsmanship were learned\nby Todoroki Muhe. He didn&#39;t get the permission of his\nclan though he tried to do overseas inspection to know\nthe circumstance of foreign countries. If a foreign\ncircumstance can&#39;t be known, he thought that he should\nexile a foreigner from Japan, and he recommended the\nthought of &quot;Sonno-jyoi(Reverence for the Emperor and\nexpulsion of the foreigner)&quot;. Then, he fought to\noverthrow the shogunate together with &quot;shishi of\nkinno&quot; which his mind was suitable for. Though he\nkilled many people, a clear record about his\nassassination does not exist. (The incident that a\nSakuma Syouzan was assassinated at midday is famous.)\nThen, many battles were finished, and He succeeded in\noverthrowing the shogunate admirably. However, he\nbecame bothering existence for new government because\nhis thought wasn&#39;t changed after the Restoration.(The\ngovernment completely changed a policy suddenly.)\nThen, he was killed by the follower of &quot;Kido\nTakayoshi&quot; who was gensai&#39;s company. At this time, he\ndidn&#39;t have the crime which was worth the death\npenalty. \n\n Best regards.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n\n\n"
