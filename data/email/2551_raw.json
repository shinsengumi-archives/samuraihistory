Timewise the katana was replacing the tachi at the same time that the bow was falling out \nof favor, thoughts anyone?\n\nDave Jackson\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Josh Wilson \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, November 19, 2003 7:31 AM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] TACHI\n\n\n  Yes, the tachi can be used in fights.. it was originally developed as a cavalry sword.. the longer blade and more pronounced curve were designed to be used form horseback.. much like the western examples of a saber in comparisson to the rapier.. the tachi was worn blade down whereas the katana was worn blade up.. the difference was that when you drew the tachi from horseback, the first draw would be a slice.. and the katana&#39;s first draw would be a slice as well, if worn blade down.. as far as dates, it seems that the tachi may be a predeccessor to the katana, but I am NOT sure..\n\n  Wilson\n\n\n  --\n\n  --------- Original Message ---------\n  DATE: Tue, 18 Nov 2003 01:31:43\n  From: &quot;Syun Ukiya&quot; &lt;squartzph@...&gt;\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Cc: \n\n  I&#39;ve been wondering about the Tachi, its different from the usual \n  katana type sword. And bit elegant too in terms of looks. Can Tachi \n  be used in fights? And the timeline of the tachi co-existed with the \n  Katana or it came after the Katana?\n\n\n\n  Yahoo!
