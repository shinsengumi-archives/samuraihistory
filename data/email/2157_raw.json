We had a class discussion after I did a presentation \nin the military history class on Oda Nobunaga&#39;s reunification efforts \nfrom 1560-1582, and professor is a hard-core Roman scholar and an all \naround pro-euro military guy, and his attempts at belittling Nobunaga \nseemed sort of sadly pathetic to me at the time.  He quickly moved \nthe conversation on to the next presentation on the Knights of \nTemplar, which was more to his tastes.\n\n&gt; As to your history prof, I agree with the last\n&gt; post--sounds to me like someone was trying to play\n&gt; down the importance of Japanese innovation. His\n&gt; reasoning makes NO military tactical sense whatsoever.\n&gt; Shoot, even with a tank platoon today you have\n&gt; similiar thinking in the way you&#39;d divide the\n&gt; battlefield between sections and individual\n&gt; tanks--similiar concepts, so that not everyone is\n&gt; shooting at the same target and there is a constant\n&gt; rate of fire. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n\n\n\n"
