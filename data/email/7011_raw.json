I wanted to do a\n&gt; little more learning on the subject. Do any of you know of a good\n&gt; website where I can find legit info. on the subject? How about books\n&gt; are there any good ones on the subject too?\n&gt;\n&gt; Later,\n&gt; Rod\n\nThe academic bible in English is Liza Dalby&#39;s &quot;Geisha;&quot; Downer&#39;s &quot;Women \nof the Pleasure Quarters&quot;, is the closest you can get to a history book \n- but she barely uses Japanese sources.\nMy favorites, however, are still Mineko Iwasaki and Sayo Masuda&#39;s \nautobiographies - mind you, the first will shatter a few of Golden&#39;s \norientalist glitter.\n\nThe best book, anyway is in Japanese:\nKyoto Geiko to Maiko no Okuzashiki, by Aihara Kyouko\nThis is easily found in Japan, costs only 700 yen and it&#39;s written in \nvery plain language. It covers history very well, and has chapters on \nthe arts, the various hanamachi, etc.\n\nIf you are interested in the present condition of geisha in Kyoto, I \nmight be the one to talk to, as I have done research about it less than \ntwo years ago, and I have a couple of geiko I became &quot;friend&quot; with. I \nwrote a paper about it as well, with interviews and appendixes giving \nprobably the most updated date you can get in English.\nCheers,\ncepo\n\nPS = Memoirs&#39; movie is coming out in the fall, featuring a pantheon \nof... Chinese actresses - including the divine Gong Li. :oO\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
