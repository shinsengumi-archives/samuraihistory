Real name&#39;s Sara) and I am a new member to the Samurai Hi=\r\nstory Group. I am very impressed with the knowledge of samurai and feudal h=\r\nistory in the Archives, so I have a few questions pertaining to Ji-samurai,=\r\n the Ikki (the rebellions?) and Sousen.\n\nI don&#39;t think Wikipedia provides e=\r\nnough detail and I may be confused with the samurai society in particular. =\r\nI am too familiar with the popular samurai that go to the capital, and it s=\r\neems that samurai are both the rulers of the provinces and the soldiers und=\r\nerneath the rulers.\n\nWhy/how were there lower-ranked rural samurai [Zi-samu=\r\nrai] ? And Ikki are like those who rebel against the Capital forces and liv=\r\ne in rural villages (I think called Sousen?)? \n\nAlso, I find it a little ha=\r\nrd to believe that few people became samurai and I read about large armies =\r\n;) What was samurai life like? What did they do in an average day?\n\nThank y=\r\nou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n=\r\n\n"
