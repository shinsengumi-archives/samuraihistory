You are definitely 100% correct. I\n&gt; figured that I would get feedback (opinions) and see what\n&gt; you, and everyone else, thinks. Why this certain period vs.\n&gt; that certain period. I figured you  guys can be a compass;\n&gt; point and I&#39;ll go. With enough interest in one period, I\n&gt; might research the other or simply go with the flow.\n&gt;\n\nThen I suggest that you don&#39;t have a story to tell. You just want to tell a\nstory.\n\nAgain, please remember that I speak from years in the business. Unless *you*\nknow what story you want to tell, you are kidding yourself and wasting time.\n\nWhile there may be ideas that you can get from any particular period, it\ndepends on *your* interests and what makes *you* excited.\n\nWe can&#39;t tell you that.\n\nAll we can do is say what *we* find interesting, which does nothing to\nfurther *your* goals of telling a story....\n\nA story *you* don&#39;t even yet know!\n\nFrankly, I could fill a cruise ship with the number of people who wanted to\nwrite the Great American Novel, if they only had something to write about.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n"
