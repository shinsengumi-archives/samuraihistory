This is a mass-produced piece, although it&#39;s nicely\nbalanced and (at the risk of provoking a duel) it does cut well.  After the\ndiscussion that&#39;s gone one here on the subject of spirits perceived in\nblades (or not), I was paying especial attention to any feelings I got from\nthe blade.\n\tIn fact, I perceived very little.  More like a spark ready to be fanned\ninto flame than anything that felt like a genuine &#39;presence&#39;.  (We picked up\na new kitten the same day:  now there [by way of contrast] is a thoroughly\ngenuine little presence.)  The pu-dao feels very much the way a\ndecently-made new weapon usually feels, only hitherto I haven&#39;t been\nanalyzing the sensations so narrowly.  The exceptions to this tendency, in\nmy experience, have been hand-forged blades, of which several have seemed to\nme already to be &#39;present.&#39;\n\tNow I have to verge into theology here, and observe that I don&#39;t believe\nhumans have the power to create the kind of presence that I perceive in\nthese weapons - those weapons, new or well-used, that carry a sense of\ncharacter about them.  But I do believe that everything in the universe\ncarries a certain amount of inherent spirit in it, which is not unreasonable\nif one regards everything as the product of an ultimate spirit. (If that\nterm is vague, it&#39;s also as neutral as I can make it.)  This is a belief\nthat is not out of tune with my understanding of the development of Shinto,\na collection of beliefs that bears a considerable resemblance to European\nand Amerindian nature religions.  The very term &#39;Shinto&#39; is loosely\ntranslated as Way of the Spirits:  a reading of the characters for michi\n(Way) and kami (which can mean everything from humans, to what the classical\nGreeks would have regarded as dryads and naiads, to mountains, gods, and\nfundamental universal principles).   (While humans are not properly\ndescribed as kami, technically we do qualify, along with anything possessing\na spirit.  To the followers of Shinto, and within my faith as well, this\nincludes quite a few things that modern culture regards as inanimate.\n\tSo my current thinking on this subject is that the kind of focus, will and\nlabour involved in hand-crafting a thing, or the loving use of a thing, can\nawaken the spirit inherent in it, and (in some manner that I don&#39;t begin to\ncomprehend) can augment its development of &#39;presence,&#39; or individual\ncharacter.  I do not expect to persuade anyone to adopt this view, but for\nthose who have experienced something similar, it may provide some fresh\ninsight.  And for those interested in the beliefs of the samurai, it may\noffer some insight into just how those beliefs might have developed in the\nfirst place.  For - as I&#39;ve said before - I&#39;ve never known a serious sworder\nwho did not share my sense of a good sword carrying a spirit that eludes\neither easy description or easy dismissal.  It&#39;s simply easier to fit the\nidea into some views of reality than others.\n\tGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
