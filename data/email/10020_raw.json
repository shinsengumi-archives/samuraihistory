I am basing mine off of a suit from the =\r\nOsaka\n&gt;castle museum (as seen on page 128 of Samurai, by Mitsuo Kure), and =\r\nit\n&gt;is in a haramaki-do style. I especially want to ask Anthony J.\n&gt;Bryant-=\r\nwhose website has helped immensely-some questions about plate\n&gt;thicknes, th=\r\nat is if anyone knows how to contact him.\n\nOkay, regarding the thickness of=\r\n the plates in a tatami-dou, I&#39;ve \nexamined several over the years, and the=\r\n plates, when made of iron or \nsteel varied from as little as 0.4mm, going =\r\nup to circa 1.6mm.\n\nThe thinner one was in a private collection and is illu=\r\nstrated on page \n88 of Ian Bottomley&#39;s and Jock Hopson&#39;s book &quot;Arms and Arm=\r\nour of the \nSamurai&quot;. Although extremely thin, they were well domed and har=\r\ndened so \nas to resist deformation. The armour was probably made during the=\r\n very \nearly Edo era  for a samurai as a  travelling piece, as the quality =\r\nof \nthe finishing is very high.\n\nFor a practical fighting armour I&#39;d recomm=\r\nend going with 1.6mm plate if \nyou can. When properly shaped they stand up =\r\nwell even if not hardened \nand tempered. Note that the edge of each plate o=\r\nn an iron or steel \nexample is turned out a tiny amount so it lays flat(ish=\r\n) against the \ntextile foundation, and the plates are arranged in a series =\r\nof curved \nlines so that when worn it follows the contours of the body in \n=\r\nhorizontal rows.\n\nHope your project goes well.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n\nIf the armour=\r\n is of hardened and lacqerred rawhide leather, then \ntypically you are look=\r\ning at using circa 3mm thick hide. Don&#39;t forget to \ncoat the outer shell wi=\r\nth a very thin layer of car body filler before \nlacquering. Okay the Japane=\r\nse didn&#39;t use car body filler, but it&#39;s the \nclosest thing you can get to t=\r\nhe compound of stone and other stuff that \nthey did use:-) This will give y=\r\nou a fine smooth surface to paint.\n\n\n-- \nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight Sch=\r\nool\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
