It drives \n&gt;  me crazy\n&gt;  &gt; reading a response then having to go down into the email to figure \n&gt;  out what\n&gt;  &gt; they are responding to.  \n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Let&#39;s stop the top posting, OK?  Do what Nate and Tony do, post \n&gt;  below each\n&gt;  &gt; section you are responding to. Thanks.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; -----------------------\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ll do the best that I can, though I&#39;ve noticed that others also \n&gt;  have this\n&gt;  &gt; problem. I do snip out the parts of previous postings that aren&#39;t \n&gt;  relevant,\n&gt;  &gt; which I&#39;ve noticed some others don&#39;t do. \n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; I have Outlook, and it&#39;s difficult, but if it&#39;s really so very, \n&gt;  very\n&gt;  &gt; important, then I&#39;ll try to remember to cut-and-paste and move the \n&gt;  original\n&gt;  &gt; posting to the top and my comments to the bottom. \n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Though I will NOT be able to put my comments below each section \n&gt;  that I&#39;m\n&gt;  &gt; responding to. Outlook isn&#39;t set up to allow people to do that, so \n&gt;  I would\n&gt;  &gt; have to format it by hand.  Which might be convenient for you but \n&gt;  is quite\n&gt;  &gt; time-consuming and inconvenient to those who have to do this\n&gt;  &gt; hand-formatting.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Nina\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  It wasn&#39;t aimed at you directly, just a general comment - and I&#39;m \n&gt;  not in attack mode :-D And I use outlook express, and I can&#39;t \n&gt;  imagine it is that much different from Outlook, so I am at a loss as \n&gt;  to what exactly the problem is.  When I hit &#39;reply&#39; in outlook \n&gt;  express, the original text is there with all the &gt;&gt;&gt; and then I can \n&gt;  scroll to wherever I want, click just below the section of text I \n&gt;  want to respond to, hit enter a few times, and voila, I have space \n&gt;  to commment. I guess you are saying that in Outlook you can&#39;t touch \n&gt;  the text you are replying to, and have to type at the top?  Sounds \n&gt;  like a poor excuse for an email system (sorry to the Bill Gates fans \n&gt;  out there) It isn&#39;t a HUGE deal or anything so don&#39;t lose any sleep \n&gt;  over it, but it does keep the format standardized and is easier to \n&gt;  follow.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\nThanks. Not sure what version of Outlook I have at work, but you can&#39;t put \nthe little &gt;&gt;&#39;s in automatically in this version; I would have to do each line \nby hand and that is a huge pain which I simply don&#39;t have time for.  It&#39;s set \nup for business and the way it is set up, that&#39;s standard business practice. \n\nSo if you can pardon me, when I&#39;m posting from work, using their version of \nOutlook, I&#39;m going to go back to the top-posting. I will always try and edit \nout all of the comments I am commenting on, other than the relevant parts, so \nthere won&#39;t be that much to scroll down and read. \n\nHowever, when I&#39;m home, using AOL, AOL will format it for me, so I can \nsprinkle in my responses between the &gt;&#39;s and &gt;&gt;&#39;s that AOL automatically puts in. \nHowever, I am unable to access my AOL account from work. \n\nCheers, Nina\n\n"
