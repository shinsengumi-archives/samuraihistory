Much of his deeds was in part, responsible for the greatness of the\nJapan of nowaddays.\n\nTokugawa was responsible for the end of the several wars inside Japan and\nthe unification of it. Tokugawa did great deeds for the cultural\npreservation of Japan, and there is much of Tokugawa&#39;s hand in therms of\nincentive about the development of Samurai Culture and heritage.\n\nIeyassu Tokugawa is a name to be listed between the great historic statesmen\nleaders just like Julius Caesar Augustus, Alexander The Great and others.\n\nEven Sid Meyer&#39;s Civilization I for Windows95 mentioned Tokugawa.\n\nAnd the Tokugawa procedures against christianism&#39;s infiltration and\npolitical conspiracy avoided the several atrocities that happened against\nthe other religions that christianism promoted in other countries just like\nDenmark, Sweden, Norway, Spain and others, just to name a few cases.\n\nTo be anti-tokugawa is to be against the samurai spirit and culture.\n\nSincerelly\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\n\nMessage: 4\n   Date: Sun, 1 Jun 2003 16:05:07 -0700\n   From: tom helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: hey\n\nPaul et al-\nI like the idea of the story as well. Why not then tell the\ntrue story of the actual American Arms dealer, Thomas Glover, who\nsold Civil war surplus to the anti-Tokugawa forces?(this may be the\none and only time American arms dealers were supplying the forces of\ngood) One of my favorite photographs from the period shows him in\nNagasaki I believe, surrounded by Satsuma shishi, at his side is his\nvery young son. I always wished I could be that kid.\nIf one must create fiction from history imagine all that\ncould be done, telling the tale of that young mans life...\n-t\n\n\n\n\n\n"
