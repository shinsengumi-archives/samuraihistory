Because Outlook automatically puts \n&gt;  &gt; the post\n&gt;  &gt; that you are responding to at the bottom. And they include the entire \n&gt;  &gt; post as\n&gt;  &gt; a default. And thus you have to back into it and delete the parts that \n&gt;  &gt; are\n&gt;  &gt; irrelevant to your response.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  Check your preferences. There should be a way to reset that so the \n&gt;  quoted material is on top.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  That setting of top-posting as &quot;default&quot; is another of Outlook&#39;s evil \n&gt;  features. IE is the same way.\n&gt;  \n\nI&#39;ll check it. And perhaps others using Outlook might have some imput into \nthis discussion. But if you have to do a manual &quot;cut and paste&quot; in order to \nswitch around the order of the post, I don&#39;t really see how this is such a huge \nissue. But if it is, then it can be done.\n\nAnd actually, many using Outlook like the original way it is set up. \nEspecially when using Outlook for business purposes, the preferred format is to have \nthe original post on the bottom and the response on the top. So either the \nOutlook people have to do the cut-and-paste method. Or else, assuming that it&#39;s \npossible to reset the preferences as to format, they would have to constantly \nswitch back and forth in preferences so that they can conduct their other \nemail-related business. \n\nSo let me pose this question in the hopes of coming to a good compromise or \nat least a definite answer: if the people using Outlook and other email systems \nthat are mainly formatted for business -- if they delete from the post they \nrespond to, other than the relevant passages. But leave it at the bottom rather \nthan cut-and-paste to put it on the top. Would that be acceptable? Or are you \nsaying that the part being responded to MUST be on the top and the response \nMUST be on the bottom.\n\nThanks, Nina\n\n"
