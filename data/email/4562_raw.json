The Wei envoys whom visited Japan did so between 220 and 265, with envoys from &#39;Japan&#39; heading to present-day Korea between 238 and 247. The Wei records list thirty &quot;countries&quot; on the Japanese archipelago, primarily in central Honshu and Kyushu, although &quot;dynasties&quot; may be a term unsuited to these largely tribal confederations of the latter Yayoi period, rather than the later, progressively centralised nation-state under the leading tribe (or &quot;country&quot; from the Chinese records), the Yamato.  \nM.Lorimer\n\nCesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\nOn Jun 16, 2004, at 6:37 AM, Nelson Pleitez wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  I mean about  202  A.
