To add perspective,\nthat&#39;s roug=\r\nhly $18,000 or so off the top of my head. \n\nThats\n&gt; 310 man-en, 248 \n&gt; man-=\r\nen and 216 man-en respectively in todays money.\n\nAgain, 3,100,000 yen, 2,48=\r\n0,000 yen, and 2,160,000\nyen.

Where did you get that 25 koku =3D\n200=\r\n=96=9C=89~?
