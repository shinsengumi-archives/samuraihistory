In=\r\n the U.S., this was Lincoln&#39;s proclamation to \n&gt; free African-American slav=\r\nes.

I am of \n&gt;=\r\n course drawing a parallel between the policies and actions of the European=\r\n \n&gt; settlers/US government towards Native Americans and the Emishi/Ainu/ On=\r\ne sa\n&gt; \n&gt; Not just in the land-grabbing and killing--- but we also saw many=\r\n Emishi \n&gt; come to work for the new Emperor(s) --- just like some natives a=\r\nllied with \n&gt; the new US.\n&gt; \n&gt; We also see that the tactics brought in from=\r\n the old country (Europe for \n&gt; US, China for Japan) were no match against =\r\nthe guerilla tactics of the \n&gt; natives---and newer devices and strategies h=\r\nad to be made to fight them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also--the idea that many Ainu hid their e=\r\nthnic origins to avoid problems \n&gt; reminds me of many native families (that=\r\n can) hiding their origins to avoid \n&gt; problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I know thou=\r\ngh...there are not any &quot;Japanese reservations&quot; As far \n&gt; as I know though..=\r\n.there are not any &quot;Japanese res\n&gt; \n&gt; Etc.etc....\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I would say=\r\n this pattern is common anytime a foreign invader \n&gt; comes in and &quot;colonize=\r\ns&quot; an area..\n&gt; \n&gt; But, still..
