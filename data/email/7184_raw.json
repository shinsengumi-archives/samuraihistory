I am not aware if he applied to a Jinenkan\n&gt;&gt; dojo. \n&gt;&gt; I was introduced to him through a couple of\n&gt;&gt; Independent Ninjutsu Instructors\n&gt;&gt;  at the time I talked to him he was 13. \n&gt;&gt; he was also spouting off on some forums, talking\n&gt;&gt; some twisted things. he was\n&gt;&gt; tracked down and found out his real age. he also\n&gt;&gt; asked me about a webpage I\n&gt;&gt; had on making a Sword. he wanted to use it on his\n&gt;&gt; page. but I don&#39;t think he\n&gt;&gt; ever used it though..  good thing..\n&gt;\n&gt;Hmm. Okay then. I suppose accidental parody is better\n&gt;than none at all. \n\nactually... what relevance it has the age of who writes things? does it\nmatter if he was serious or not? does it matter at all what he wanted to\nsay? to me matters more the meaning I give to his words.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.\nVersion: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 267.2.0 - Release Date: 27/05/2005\n\n\n\n\n"
