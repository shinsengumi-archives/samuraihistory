My name is Ty, and I have had an interest in Japan, particularly the samurai since I was a child.  I have been interested not only in the history, warfare, social structure, and food.\n   \n  I will not pretend to be an expert-rather I am hoping to learn from the group and eventually be able to contribute useful information and resources.  I read your rules and the misconceptions list and agree to follow them.  \n   \n  So much for my dreams of being a modern samurai and forcing cowardly ninjas to commit hari-kiri with a butter knife.\n   \n  Thanks for reading,\n   \n  Ty\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nBrings words and photos together (easily) with\n PhotoMail  - it&#39;s free and works with Yahoo!
