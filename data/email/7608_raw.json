A story about some\nindividuals who reacted in certain ways to certain events that happened to\nthem. \n \nSometimes, as either historians or film buffs, we try to over-generalize as\nto what &quot;huge message&quot; has been meant, what &quot;politics&quot; or &quot;propaganda&quot; might\nbe there, and what all of this means in a grand scheme of things. \n \nKobayashi has said that his films are about individuals (not groups or\npolitical tendencies) who resist oppression. So in order to make a film\nabout such a theme, one must set up a particular individual with a\nparticular personality. With particular strengths and weaknesses of\ncharacter. \n \nEven for someone who couldn&#39;t care less about Japanese (or American or\nEuropean or wherever) politics, either in ancient or modern times -- still\nSEPPUKU is a chilling and compelling portrait of individuals and how they\ndeal with the fate meted out to them. \n \nNow to reference actual history to this comment -- because this is a history\nlist and not a list about fictional literature or cinema. Do we study\nhistory as grand themes and tendencies? Or study the lives of individuals?\nDo we study just the lives of influential individuals (i.e.Nobunaga,\nHideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu)? Or try and look at the lives of ordinary\npeople, in whatever ways we may? Or all of the above? \n \nNina \n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of onnagozen\nSent: Friday, September 02, 2005 8:50 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Our &quot;welcoming&quot; attitude\n\n\n\n[snips in a very incisive, interesting post]\n \nBy the time the film was made there were no samurai, yet\nit almost feels like the film-maker was making a propaganda movie\nagainst the feudal era and its practices. \n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
