I strongly\n&gt; believe in freedom of speech but that is a right to\n&gt; be earned and respected not abused. For anyone who\n&gt; is truely interested in the topic I will spend time\n&gt; and effort (both of which are getting very scarce at\n&gt; present} to aid and assist.  I feel certain that\n&gt; there are &quot;groups&quot; more suited to Mr. Heaton&#39;s\n&gt; abilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards to all those who take this topic with\n&gt; some level of seriousness.\n&gt; \n&gt;                                             Rod\n&gt; Johnson\n&gt; \n&gt; Although my English is pretty good {for a\n&gt; Yorkshireman} I find that it is the fingers on the\n&gt; keyboard that let me down at times......\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; this is mr.heaton \n\nin all do respect seriusness is what im seeking.\nfor legend that the chinese spoke in which man has\nmuscles in his feet ,legs and such that can enable him\nto jump great heigths and be as light as a feather may\nbe a myth to some,but in american sports even\nbasketball players have discovered this valuation to\nbe true.and as bruce lee stated in his lecture of jeet\nkun do there is no boundry but in the mind for reality\nclaims not a race or gender but whom are to grasp it\ninstead ,not in exact words ,but the term of reality\nis not a time or limitation of ownership or being\nruled over to be enabled to grasp more than the\nexpectations of today.in kung fu,tai chi,ninjistu,jeet\nkun do,and samurai there is no boundry but what\nindividuals set for themselves as each art is a basic\nconclusion to open the mind to all in order to\novercome anything put in the way of true\nreality.martial arts that we are use to are just basic\nexamples of how a man or women can be more than\nobjects ,fear ,power over or under ,in being able to\novercome any obsticles instead of seeking boundries\nseek a way of no boundries ,but in any lesson we learn\nnot just how dangerous a sword is but in are fragile\nminds we must concern the utmost respect in moral\nconsequince of even just the sword alone as well as\nour bodies ,but most of all our minds. there is no\nspecific way to handle any fight but to keep in mind\nthe stillness prayludes the discipline of speed.and to\ngod believers or any miraculous accomplishment of a\nbody how can anyone claim a place a time or race into\nreality,for it is the other way around.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
