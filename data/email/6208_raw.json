My mistake...Thank \nyou for helping me and tell me what do you think of this site:\nwww.jidai.jp, although I&#39;m having difficulties at this time buying a \n300 Euros sword...So the site is just a dream, besides, since I don&#39;t \ntake any Kendo or any alike, I wouldn&#39;t know what to do with a sword, \nbut to admire its beauty.\n\n  Sorry again, and I hope I have redeemed myself in your eyes :)\n\n  Respectfully,\n\n  Gabriel\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Silk Road School&quot; \n&lt;silk.road.school@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Gabriel -\n&gt; This in answer to both your note here and to a respondent who came \nalong\n&gt; later:  over the past thirty years I&#39;ve handled a number of blades \nmade in\n&gt; Toledo, both good ones and bad, and I&#39;ll assure you that this site \nis simply\n&gt; using the name of the city.  I have no doubt at all that the smiths \nof\n&gt; Toledo in Spain are still forging fine blades, as they have been \ndoing for\n&gt; hundreds of years... and I also do not doubt that some of them are\n&gt; simultaneously turning out pieces of wall-hanger pot-metal for \ntourists&#39;\n&gt; walls.  All the same, I&#39;d hate to see anyone&#39;s opinion of Toledo \nblades,\n&gt; which can be very fine indeed, shaped by this fairly standard \nselection of\n&gt; pop-steel.  Feel free to contact me off-list if you&#39;d like a few \nbetter\n&gt; places to look.\n&gt; And on the other hand, anyone who has contact information for any \nof the\n&gt; smiths of Toledo, please feel free to contact me also.\n&gt; Gereg\n&gt; \n&gt; Message: 8\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 09 Dec 2004 10:19:15 -0000\n&gt;    From: &quot;Dodu Gabriel&quot; &lt;dodu_gabriel@y...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Japan Eras\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter\n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Were you interested, we do have a few sword experts\n&gt; &gt; (I&#39;m not one of them).

I\n&gt; like the www.toledoswords.com site, mostly because it&#39;s one of the\n&gt; few I have visited (so I only know about their opinion). Is it ok?\n&gt;  Oh, and don&#39;t be afraid, as I have no intention on getting freaky, \nI\n&gt; just like to learn about the historical events that have taken place\n&gt; throughout the world, and in that matter the Discovery Channel has\n&gt; been of great help ;)\n&gt;  I am also very interested in sailships, but that does not make the\n&gt; object of this forum, so sorry I&#39;ve mentioned it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Respectfully,\n&gt; \n&gt;  Gabriel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
