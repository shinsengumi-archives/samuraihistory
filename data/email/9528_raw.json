Samurai detested\n\n &gt; spying and any other form of deceit. To this end they usually used \n &gt; Ninjas for this purpose. \n\nCould not be more incorrect. Ninja were often samurai. Me thinks you&#39;ve\nbeen watching too many ninja movies and mistaking them for history.\n\n &gt; Samurai in 1876-1877 still wearing ceremonial armour into battle and \n &gt; allowing an outsider (Cruise as a cavalry captain) to wear the armour\n\n &gt; of the man he killed. I don&#39;t recall Kenshin Himura or even Saitoh \n &gt; Hajime wearing armour on RK or SX.  \n\nYou are correct that samurai didn&#39;t wear armour into battle at this\ntime, but using Kenshin as a source is like me saying that pig-men flew\nplanes in the First World War because Porco Rosso did.\n\n &gt; The battle was laughable. No Samurai will wait for an enemy he is \n &gt; facing to attack first. Especially when he has the advantage of a \n &gt; cavalry charge against infantry. \n\n\nPlenty would and did. Every single instance of a siege is an example of\nthis.\n\n-AngusH \n\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
