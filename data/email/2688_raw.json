Just because it \nwasn&#39;t written down? Sure, it may have varied from region to region and era to era, but the \nsamurai as a caste surely had a set of expectations or ethics - whether self-imposed or \nimposed by others. If I&#39;m way off base, let me know. Related to this, I&#39;d like to know: is there \nany evidence for &quot;bushido&quot; prior to the Hagakure? What are the other main pieces of samurai \nliterature?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n"
