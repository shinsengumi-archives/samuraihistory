He was a Japanese director who took some of his\n inspiration from Western sources.\n \n You are absolutely correct that film are not really good guides to actual\n history. Both films, in many ways, deal with mythologies. But the\n mythologies come from different cultures, different sources. \n \n MAGNIFICENT SEVEN comes from Western American mythology, that of the noble\n gunfighter who helps Mexican peasants. When in fact most Western gunfighters\n were quite mercentary and many of them hated Mexicans. \n \n SEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the noble ronin who helps\n peasants. When in fact, most Japanese ronin were mostly interested in\n connecting with a clan. And they saw themselves as being apart from and\n superior to the farmers. \n \n However, the realities from which these mythologies spring from are quite\n different. Once again: 19th century Western gunfighters were not the same at\n all as 17th century Japanese ronin.\n \n Nina \n \n -----Original Message-----\n From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n On Behalf Of James Eckman\n Sent: Tuesday, January 31, 2006 1:35 AM\n To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Re: Magnificent Seven\n \n \n &gt;   From: nohit@...\n &gt;  \n &gt;\n &gt;But the idea of a &quot;cowboy with a conscience&quot; who has a clear sense of \n &gt;&quot;right and wrong&quot; isn&#39;t at all like a 17th century Japanese ronin.\n &gt;\n I agree, but many Japanese think of Kurosawa as a WESTERN director so his\n chanbara films is some ways don&#39;t either. So maybe when comparing the two\n films they are a bit closer than one would think. Of course a better example\n would be to read Dashiel Hammet&#39;s &#39;Red Harvest&#39; and watch Yojimbo knowing\n that Kurosawa is a fan of detective novels.\n \n &gt;You notice that, in THE SEVEN SAMURAI, when the farmers come to recruit \n &gt;some ronin, most of the ronin turn up their noses -- that last thing on \n &gt;this earth that they would want to do is defend some farmers.\n &gt;\n I think films in general are poor guides to history. Anerican westerns are\n for the most part phony as well having known people who actually lived in\n the period there. For really quick reads Anthony Bryant&#39;s books are pretty\n good and for a sloppy but readily available introduction one of the Turnbull\n books is OK. Just don&#39;t bother with the ninja one, the rest are pretty much\n rehashes of his previous ones.\n \n Jim Eckman\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ---\n Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n \n Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com Samurai Archives store:\n http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n ---\n Yahoo!
