If so, what is the best kind of\noil to use? Is \nthe anything else which should be done? What about \nthe scabbard? \nWhat maintence and care should be taken with it?\nAdvise will be \nappreciated.\n\nIncidentally, this is a modern sword and is sold in\nJapan \nunsharpened. Sholud I leave it that way? Is it\npossible to sharpen \nthese swords? If so is it desirable to have it\nsharpened?\n\nEven though the sword is not sharpened, My friend had\nto get a police \npermit to buy one. This took several months. On the\nway to the \nstates, three times he was required to open the box\nand show it to \ninspectors at various airports.\n\n Even though this this is not a collectors item it is\nvery beautiful \nand authentic looking and I am very proud of it. I\nhave another \nsword, but that was is very cheap looking with lots of\nplastic on the \nhandle. (Also a gift however, so the thought was\nthere.)\n\n\nYahoo!
