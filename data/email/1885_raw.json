Anyone who would go \nto such trouble should be cherished. You need aks him if it is a \n&quot;shinsakuto&quot;or a &quot;Iaito&quot; (mogito). If it is an Iaito then you need \nonly keep it clean, if it is a shinsakuto you&#39;ll need a cleaning kit.\n\tFor a traditionally made Japanese sword a cleaning kit is \ntissue or better yet rice paper, a ball of uchiko and choji oil. \nUchiko is a mild abrasive used to clean off the old coating of oil \nbefore an application of a new one. the Choji oil is usually a \nmineral oil with a hint of choji (clove) for fragrance, this is most \nassuredly NOT the same oil used for toothache so be careful. There is \nalso Tsubaki abura, or camellia oil which some prefer because it has \nlittle or no odor. Uchiko is made from the &quot;sludge&quot; or by product of \nthe uchigomori stone used in polishing. Literally &quot;child of the \nUchigomori&quot;. There are several grades but for Shinsakuto it matters \nlittle.\n\tIf your saya is new, remember that it was likely not made for \nyour climate but that of Japan. If the fit of the habaki or collar on \nyour sword/saya is tight do not force it but leave a 1/4 inch of it \nout of the saya. It is expected that in a new saya the opening will \nbe very tight, in a dryer climate it may contract and crack. There is \nlittle maintence for a well made saya...\n\t-t\n\nif you believe you have a true nihonto I invite you to visit the \nfollowing link and to join the &quot;nihonto@yahoogroups.com&quot; list.\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n\n\n"
