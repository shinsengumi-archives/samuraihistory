The \nangle(s) of the cut to the stomach are highly debatable but the most common \none that I have seen is horizontally left to right then vertically up the \ncenter into the heart.  The general idea is to do this without showing the \npain that this would be causing.\n  The assistant has the most important job.  He watches over the one \nperforming the seppuku and if he sees the man about to lose face by giving \ninto his pain he decapitates him immediately.  If the one performing seppuku \nmanages to go through the whole procedure then the second decapites him to \nend his misery.  The decapitation must be done just right or else the head \nwill roll away and disgrace both men.  Ideally the neck must be cut and the \nhead drop down into the lap.\n  Muso Shinden Ryu, an Iaido (swordsmanship) style, teaches the proper \nmethods and technique of being a second.\n  Just my two sense on seppuku.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nPlanning a family vacation?
