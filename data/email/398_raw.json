He died after fortifying hinself in\nhis castle of takato.  Oda Nobunaga attacked his\ncastle after he refused to surender.  He was killed in\nthe attack against takato.  This was around 1582 so at\nleast we know the clan survivd that long.  Just in\ncase you did not know Nishina Morinobu also died in\nthe action at takato castle with his brother.  Man to\nlose both 4th and 5th sons in the same action.  Even\nknow takeda shingen was dead at the time I am sure the\ntakeda family felt alot of pain that year.\n\nSorry no info on Mon but they might have used the\ntakeda family heraldry....Not sure though.  Doesn&#39;t\nlook like either one had children of their own.\n\nMusashi\n--- &quot;C.W.&quot; &lt;kitsuno@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if Morinobu continued on the clan via\n&gt; blood decendants,\n&gt; however another clansman, who may not be related by\n&gt; blood, is Nishina\n&gt; Moriaki who was active in the 1540&#39;s.  Apparently\n&gt; the Nishina clan\n&gt; were initially enemies of the Takeda, but eventualy\n&gt; became allied with\n&gt; them, or at least fell under thier influence.  That\n&gt; might explain why\n&gt; Morinobu was adopted by them.  Thats about all I\n&gt; have on the\n&gt; Nishina....  Hope it might help...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@y..., acacia753@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I know having used the research at the Samurai\n&gt; archives site that \n&gt; &gt; Nishina Morinobu was the 6th son of Takeda\n&gt; Shingen. Does anyone else \n&gt; &gt; have any information on the Nishina clan? Mon?\n&gt; Other Descendents? It \n&gt; &gt; is part of my family heritage and I am having\n&gt; great difficulty \n&gt; &gt; finding anything out. Any help would be\n&gt; appreciated.
