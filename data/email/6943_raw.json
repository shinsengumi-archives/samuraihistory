There is some information on him in English in the Meiji \nRestoration histories - Choshu in the Meiji Restoration by Albert Craig \nand Jansen&#39;s biography of Sakamoto Ryoma. There&#39;s quite a lot on \nGoogle, especially if you read Japanese. (Just need to distinguish \nbetween the historical figure and the character who appears in \nKenshin!)\n\nI&#39;ve got a couple of Japanese biographies on him - one is published by \nthe Takasugi museum in Yamaguchi-ken, the Tougyouan. If you \ngoogle this name you&#39;ll come up with some more stuff, but you need to \nbe able to read Japanese. What exactly did you want to know? I&#39;ll help \nwith specific questions if I can.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; hello everyone!\n&gt; \n&gt; i know I am in the right place to find some informations about \nTakasugi Shinsaku!\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to know if someone knows some books or pubblications \nabout this man!It is very important for me so if someone could give \nsome help I would appreciate!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks so much\n&gt; \n&gt; Daniele\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
