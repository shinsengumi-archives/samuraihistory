Hideyoshi and 2. Nobunaga. \n&gt; Uesugi Kenshin, Takeda Shingen, \n&gt; Akechi Mitsuhide and Tokugawa Ieyasu would round out\n&gt; my top six, followed \n&gt; closely by Shibata Katsuie and (maybe) Mori Motonari\n&gt; and Saito Dosan, but those two \n&gt; are stretches.\n\nEven if you are in the minority, it&#39;s not heretical to\nhave a better idea...that&#39;s why I asked what the point\nof the question was--if their looking for the &quot;ideal&quot;\nsamurai, etc., then I&#39;d point to Yamanaka Shikanosuke\n(that is, until the very end...). As far as who I\n&quot;first&quot; think of when the word is said, I probably\nthink of Nobunaga, but when I mentioned Musashi, it\nwas not my thinking, but unfortunately what I think\nmost people in the West would say. \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
