That&#39;s what we&#39;re here for--when you ask a\n&gt; question, we&#39;ll try to give you answers or point you\n&gt; in the right direction. However, we&#39;re not going to\n&gt; research anyone&#39;s genealogy for them. I can give you\n&gt; information about the Miura clan of Sagami, but I\n&gt; can&#39;t connect the dots for you to show you how you are\n&gt; related or not related to them. That&#39;s up to the\n&gt; individual who wants to know. \n&gt; \n&gt; If you ask a question here and don&#39;t get an answer,\n&gt; chances are it&#39;s because no one here knows the answer\n&gt; or where to find it. No one has some massive store of\n&gt; &quot;All Information Japanese&quot; and is keeping it from you\n&gt; in a nasty display of spitefulness. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nI posted a list of about 10 genealogy websites, the poster would be \nadvised to look at them, as this is not a genealogy forum.\n\n\n\n\n"
