In terms of having to send stu=\r\nff back\nto Japan, I&#39;m familiar with the situation, we ordered a wakizashi l=\r\nast\nyear, we got the wrong habaki and like you the wrong menuki, so back it=\r\n\nwent. Its still got the wrong habaki, but the menuki got fixed! Oh well,\na=\r\nt least this is something we can correct further down the road.\n\nWith much =\r\nthanks\n\nDean\n\n\nIn message &lt;BAY9-F1000lfepHjon600005a1d@...&gt;, M. R. =\r\nWilliams\n&lt;amacobra@...&gt; writes\n&gt;\n&gt;Mr. Wayland,\n&gt;\n&gt;  Half a dozen of=\r\n the members of my dojo (including myself) have dealt with \n&gt;Tozando.  Thei=\r\nr quality and options are rather nice, especially since you \n&gt;can get the f=\r\nittings from the Nishijin Sword site (their sister company).  \n&gt;However, th=\r\ne language barrier does cause issues.  Every one of us had a \n&gt;problem with=\r\n our final product.  Some of us had the wrong tsuba.  Some had \n&gt;the wrong =\r\nsam=E9.  All minor things, for sure, but sill issues nonetheless.  I \n&gt;was =\r\nthe only one who was determined enough to get what I had ordered so I \n&gt;had=\r\n to mail the tsuka back to Japan for the proper menuki to be attached.\n&gt;  I=\r\nn general they are a good company.  You just have to be prepared to deal \n&gt;=\r\nwith minor problems and to not be surprised if you have to send something \n=\r\n&gt;back.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Peace,\n&gt;\n&gt;Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;_____________________________________________=\r\n____________________\n&gt;Check out Election 2004 for up-to-date election news,=\r\n plus voter tools and \n&gt;more! http://special.msn.com/msn/election2004.armx\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Ar=\r\nchives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;--- \n&gt;Yahoo!
