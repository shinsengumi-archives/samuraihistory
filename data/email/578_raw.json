I used your Sekigahara book as a guide when I \nwalked the Sekigahara battlefield in 1999 during my in-country training as a \nJapan-focused US Army foreign area officer.  It was a lifesaver, especially \nsince the local guidebooks and signs are not particularly &quot;gaijin friendly.&quot;  \nYour other works are equally helpful, and a pleasure to read.\n\nMy MA thesis ended up being about the Japanese 1941-42 Centrifugal Offensive \nin the Southwest Pacific, but I hope to write on the Senkoku Jidai in the \nfuture.  Wouldn&#39;t object to putting together an Osprey book on the Imperial \nJapanese Army in the early 40s (Lord knows I&#39;ve got more than enough source \nmaterial to do one!), but I suspect there&#39;s not much of an English-speaking \naudience for one . . .\n\nKeep on plugging--I can&#39;t wait for your thesis or your first academic work to \ncome out!\n\nCordially,\nPatrick Howard\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
