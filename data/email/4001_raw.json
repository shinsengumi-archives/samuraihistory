Perhaps the admin(s) of this list should\n&gt; consider splitting Samurai\n&gt; History up into two lists, one more pop culture\n&gt; oriented and another more\n&gt; history oriented. That way, the elitist historian\n&gt; types are less likely to\n&gt; be faced with questions that make them roll their\n&gt; eyes and act so rudely.\n\n\nHere is the list right here, it has been around for almost two months, and there \nare no rules on it, so people can feel free to debate if Super Mario could beat a \nninja, and everyone else can feel free to make fun of them: \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/japantoday/\n\nSo have fun!\n\n\n\n"
