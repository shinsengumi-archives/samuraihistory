The answer to this is Tokugawa Japan whose people developed\ntheir o=\r\nwn civilization in a self-contained environment.\n\nThus it comes as no surpr=\r\nise that Japanese expert, Tsunenari Tokugawa,\nthe 18th descendant of the ma=\r\nn who started the Tokugawa period,\nbelieves that Pakistan can only progress=\r\n if it has values and\neducation two things that are essential for the growt=\r\nh of a nation as\nJapan has seen.\n\nTsunenari Tokugawa was invited to speak a=\r\nt an event held by the 21st\nCentury Business & Economics Clubs (21st CBEC) =\r\nand Institute of\nBusiness Administration (IBA) on Friday evening.\n\nTokugawa=\r\n is the director of the Tokugawa Memorial Foundation and lives\nin New York.=\r\n He is also president of NYK America. The topic of his\ntalk was: &#39;Transitio=\r\nn from Tokugawa Shogunate to Modern Japan.&#39;\n\nGiving a historical account of=\r\n Japan&#39;s progress, Tokugawa said that\nthe Tokugawa period in Japan lasted f=\r\nrom 1603 to 1868 during which\ntime it progressed to the heights of which En=\r\ngland had not seen.\n\nFor example, the literacy rate during this period was =\r\nhigh-70 to 80\npercent among males and 40 to 50 percent among females. He sa=\r\nid the\nliteracy rate in most European countries and America was much lower.=\r\n\n\nMore than 15,000 elementary schools, besides 260 Samurai schools and\n2,00=\r\n0 private academies, were established all over Japan. The teaching\nsystem o=\r\nf both regular primary schools and Samurai schools was\nseparate. The standa=\r\nrd of education was very high at that time.\n\nThe top priority of Tukugawa J=\r\napan was its strong consensus on\nnational security. There was strong sense =\r\nof human equality under the\nclass system also, Tokugawa explained.\n\nThe mor=\r\nal standards among the elite were high as well. He said the\nelite followed =\r\nthe teachings of noted Chinese philosopher, Confucius.\nIts people were envi=\r\nronmentally conscious and no one cut down trees.\nAt the most people cut bra=\r\nnches and bark for fuel.\n\nAt that time, a very sophisticated market economy=\r\n was flourishing in\nJapan and a large number of people were living in citie=\r\ns. For example,\nthe population of Tokyo at that time was one million, where=\r\nas other\nimportant cities such as Osaka and Kyoto had a population of over\n=\r\n400,000 people only.\n\nIn 1850, Japan opened up its economy to the world and=\r\n its first\nagreement was signed with the United States. The government invi=\r\nted\ntechnicians, professors and technological experts from the US and\nEurop=\r\nean countries to teach the Japanese nation the latest technology\nand litera=\r\nture. He said that people were taught in French and English\nduring the firs=\r\nt decade, but later on all literature and technical\nmanuals were translated=\r\n into Japanese, and after 20 years all foreign\nexperts were sent back. Duri=\r\nng that period a huge transition took\nplace and education at a higher level=\r\n was also initiated in Japanese.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1945, Japan witnessed 77 yea=\r\nrs of imperial rule during\nwhich it fought many wars, the last being World =\r\nWar II, which it\neventually lost. Still, Tokugawa said the Japanese managed=\r\n to maintain\ntheir values.\n\nTokugawa, nevertheless, admitted that Japan is =\r\nfacing some social\nproblems. For example, young people do not marry, which =\r\nis causing a\nhuge problem for Japanese families. He also said that more tha=\r\nn 25\npercent of the overall Japanese population is older than 65 years.\n\nTo=\r\nkugawa also said that the old buildings were being demolished for\nnew and m=\r\nodern plazas, which was a matter of serious concern.\n\n\n\n\n"
