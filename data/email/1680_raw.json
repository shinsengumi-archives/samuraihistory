Of these I can readily identify five mon, the easiest to describe without a pic would be a circle with eight circles touching and surrounding it - a little like the Hosakawa. A further example would be a single coin (zeni); this is a circle with a small square cut out in the centre. To be a little more accurate you would need to identify the branch of the family or province in which they lived.\n\nI could get some scan of these off to you if you need them.\n\nRegards,\n\n                    Rod Johnson\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
