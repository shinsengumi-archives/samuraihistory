Some were asking why they couldn&#39;t learn left handed. For kyudo it \nis impossible for a number of reasons. First the viewing area is invariably \non the right in the dojo. Second, in battle formation, archers firing from \nany side etc. would cause confusion in the ranks. Third, (and most \nimportantly), the yumi is curved in such a way that it cannot be fired \nproperly from a left-handed stance.\n  In addition, the grip of the yumi is one of the more difficult aspects of \nkyudo for the beginner to master. Being left-handed is actually a bonus in a \nright-handed stance.\n\nM.J.Peters\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
