Bullshit! it is not spirit it is technique. It IS true that \nan idiot can break a sword with an incorrect blow. Hell I know people who \ncan break ball bearings. I regularly trim my yard with the same 1&quot; round \nbamboo staff that I use for practicing kendo forms. It works better than \nloppers on exposed limbs. But it is TECHNIQUE, not some mystical purity in \nmy soul.\n  As for my experience, I am currentlly studying kyuudo in Ibaraki. Again it \nis technique. SOME people use it as a means to focus for Zen, it is a means \nnot a requirement.\n\nMJPeters\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n\n\n\n"
