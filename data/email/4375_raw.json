However, it was a link to\nJapanese resources, of course:\n\nhttp://dra.library.ubc.ca/MARION/auth?fmt_limit=&lng_limit=&index=T&key=Ky%E5oto+Gaikokugo+Daigaku+kenky%E5u+rons%E5o.&limits=\n\nOn the middle of the page are some &quot;machi bugyo\nnikki&quot;, diaries of machi bugyo. Could be very\ninteresting, and there is a chance that it may refer\nto cases of samurai vs. chonin. \n\nEvery other hit was either a short definition of a\nmachi-bugyo, something that just had the words &quot;machi&quot;\nand &quot;bugyo&quot;, or a broken link. \n\nAs I said before, not much would be available in\nEnglish as to the specifics of what the person was\nasking for--namely, townsperson vs. samurai fights and\ntheir outcome/fallout. Of course, he/she can obviously\nrefine the search, or use the Japanese google, or go\nto a library. If I were the one looking for the\ninformation, I&#39;d start on Japanese google for hints,\nand then go to the library.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\nhttp://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/\n\n"
