Nowadays, the drek that is fed people \non TLC, THC, and National Geographic makes me cringe. Even when they do have \nknowledgeable people giving them information, the producers tend to feed the \nmyths rather than rely on research. I spent the better part of 2 hours \nwatching without having to cry *bull$hit* once. I was greatly surprised. It \ndid seem to me that I had seen a lot of this footage previously in shows \nwhere I DID cry bull$hit. It&#39;s almost as if their consultants sat down with \nthem and actually cross checked everything before release. Kind of a \nhistorian&#39;s cut. It seemed that Conlan and Friday had a lot more influence \non this one.\n\n  The title was The Samurai which of course makes it easy to differentiate \nfrom other documentaries about samurai. :)\n\nMichael\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n\n\n"
