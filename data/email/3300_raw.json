Bryant, but Nate Ledbetter,\n&gt; Kitsuno, Tom Helm, Cepo, \n&gt; and Prof Letham are all experts that I am honored to\n&gt; learn from. \n\n*BLUSH* I&#39;m merely a rank (and I mean that in the\nworst way) amateur, but thank you very much. \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On with my question.  It has 2 parts.  \n&gt; First, I have seen some famous statue photos of\n&gt; Masashige Kusunoki.  \n&gt; It is a huge bronze statue of the man, powerfully\n&gt; posed, on a huge \n&gt; horse.  It seems to capture a strength that not many\n&gt; other statues of \n&gt; this type reveal.  I&#39;d like to see it myself but I\n&gt; don&#39;t know where \n&gt; it is at.  I&#39;m living in Tokyo, and I know it&#39;s\n&gt; somewhere around \n&gt; here.  Anyone know exactly where it is?\n\nI can show you, if you&#39;d like. I live in Yoyogi. The\nstatue is right next to the Imperial Palace in the\nAkasaka area. I don&#39;t have my guidebook handy right\nnow (at work) to point out the exact subway stop, but\nI was there about 2 weeks ago with a military tour\ngroup--we went there and to the Boeicho headquarters\nat Ichigaya (the Japanese Pentagon). If you follow the\ndirections to get to the Palace, it&#39;s right there next\nto the bathroom/omiyage store/restaurant. Pretty cool\nstatue, too.\n\n\n&gt; Second, does anyone who has visited the statue have\n&gt; other pictures of \n&gt; it?  I&#39;d like to get a small collection of photos so\n&gt; that I can make \n&gt; a painting.  The staue would be a reference for the\n&gt; horse mainly but \n&gt; I&#39;d like to capture the strength of the samurai in\n&gt; it as well.\n\nNo pics in hand right now, they are all with my stuff\nyet to be shipped from the US. But as I said, if\nyou&#39;re in Tokyo go yourself and take as many pics as\nyou want! Email me off list if you would like to get\ntogether at all for me to show you.\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool.
