It should prove quite \nuseful in clearing this up. \n\nDo you have any other information about samurai usage of weapons \nother than the trio of bow, spear, and sword? I see mention of all \nsorts of exotic polearms, axes like the masakari and ono, and other \nthings. How frequently would these be seen on the field? Were most of \nthese used only in specialized circumstances or by specific types of \npeople?\n\nRespectfully, \n\nAndrew Benton\nhttp://www.spearweasel.com\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; HI\n&gt; \n&gt; the thought that chain weapons were restricted to\n&gt; ninja is very much incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
