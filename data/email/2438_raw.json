They did not look any warrior figures.\nAlso, as far as I know, the reular cavalry did not\nhave armors and their uniforms were probabily same as\nthose of the infantry.\n\nThe reason for not having armors except for commanders\nduring the Yi dynasty was that the main tactical units\nof soldiers were archers with complementary cannon\nunits but mostly in the Navy. If you had seen movie\n&quot;Brave Heart&quot;, you may recall the efficacy of the\nEnlish archers against tough Scottish soldiers armed\nwith swords and spears.\n\nKoreans were originally related to Mongols and\nManchurian at the ancient times. Tradionally, the\narchery had been an important part of arts for the\nnobility. I remember that the Japanese at the ancient\ntimes also put more emphasis on the archery than on\nthe  swordmanship.\n\nBack to your question, if you want to have more\nprecise information, you may check the Korean websites\nof Museums. I wish I could give more input. But, as\nyou know from my earlier message to you, I am pretty\ntight with finishing my paper, now. Good luck on your\nresearch.\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             \n--- burker1@... wrote:\n&gt; I need to tap into the group&#39;s collective knowledge.\n&gt;  What companies make \n&gt; 15mm figures for Samurai and Koreans for the\n&gt; Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592?\n&gt; \n&gt; I know that Two  Dragons, Minifigs, Irregular\n&gt; Miniatures, Tin Soldier, and \n&gt; Naismith, all have samurai lines. The first three\n&gt; would be compatible with each \n&gt; each in terms of size.  Tin Soldier are very large\n&gt; 15s while Naismith are very \n&gt; small 15s.\n&gt; \n&gt; In terms of Koreans, Naismith makes at least 6\n&gt; different packs of Koreans, \n&gt; but I don&#39;t know if they are for the Yi Dynasty or\n&gt; for an earlier period.  East \n&gt; Riding Miniatures has some Yi Dynasty Koreans, but\n&gt; they only make command \n&gt; figures and two types of heavy cavalry (no\n&gt; infantry).\n&gt; \n&gt; Irregular Miniatures makes some Korean figures as\n&gt; part of the Mongol line, so \n&gt; I suspect that they would be too early for the\n&gt; period I am interested in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know of any other manufacturers of 15mm\n&gt; Japanese and Korean \n&gt; figures?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
