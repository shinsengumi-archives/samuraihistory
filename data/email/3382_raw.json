Both call for unquestioned service to \na (L)ord and both have followers very willingly giving their lives for that \n(L)ord if and when the need arises.  It&#39;s just a matter of the direction.  \nBushido, the lord is a human one.  Christianity, a spiritual One.  I do agree that \nmany (most?!) Christians could learn to be braver through studying Bushido, \nthough, myself included.  That Christian samurai were willing to give their \nlives for either (or both) of their (L)ords is testament to how devoted they were \nto their religion and to their code, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.\n       Take care.\n\nL8r.\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
