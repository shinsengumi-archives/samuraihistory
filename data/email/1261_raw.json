Consequently there were a lot \nmore swords\nmade and a lot more survived.   The notion that the Europeans had no \nnotion of\n&quot;protecting things&quot; is simply not true. There are still fabulous collections\nof medieval weapons all over Europe in museums and private hands.  \n\nThe habit of carrying swords in the west, medieval or not, only ended \nabout 150\nyears ago.   Officers in the Civil War carried swords and used them.   When\nthe Queen of Holland gave General Eisenhower a token of her country&#39;s \nesteem,\nit was a highly decorated sword, not a machine gun.\n\nSwordmaking in Japan was a major art form, and is still practiced by \nnumerous\nindividuals, some of whom have been designated &quot;Living National \nTreasures&quot; by\nthe Japanese government.  The skill required to forge a samurai sword \nstaggers\none&#39;s imagination, and requires many years to master.   The allied art \nof making\nthe sword fittings is also astounding in its complexity.    The great \nnames of the\nsword art are as important culturally in Japan as Rembrandt and Picasso are\nin the west.  A recent exhibition of the swords of Masamune, perhaps the\ngreatest of all swordsmiths, drew record crowds at the Tokugawa Art Museum\nin Nagoya.\n\nThere are now numerous books available in English for westerners interested\nin the Japanese sword.   I would be glad to post a bibliography of such \nitems\nif there are sufficient requests.   A good book for beginners is John \nYumoto&#39;s\nclassic work, &quot;The Samurai Sword, A Handbook&quot; published by Tuttle.\n\n\nAnthony J. Bryant wrote:\n\n&gt; midorinotoradesu wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tony,\n&gt; &gt; I was just thinking about all the samurai swords that are in museums\n&gt; &gt; and in great condition.  I&#39;ve heard that european blades are\n&gt; &gt; difficult to come by in good condition due to oxidation from constant\n&gt; &gt; handling.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, not really. Remember that the sword-carrying culture of the medieval\n&gt; mindset went away in the 16th century in Europe, but only about 150 years\n&gt; ago in Japan. Japan also had the advantage of 250 years of peace to turn\n&gt; swords from tools into simple art. Japan also had a tradition of donating\n&gt; armour and weapons to temples and shrines, who then preserved the \n&gt; offerings.\n&gt; Europe had no such tradition that protected things. If things in Europe\n&gt; weren&#39;t kept in the local castle or family attic, they went away.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had heard the similar story about the samurai sword only being\n&gt; &gt; drawn to taste blood... so I&#39;m curious, as this was the explaination\n&gt; &gt; (albiet misinformed) for the condition of samurai swords.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t work. If anything, after being bloodied a sword has to be cleaned\n&gt; or it&#39;ll start rusting *really* fast. Remember, the reason for blood is to\n&gt; get oxygen through the body. Blood is a *great* oxidization agent.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do realize that the samurai regaurded their blades more highly than\n&gt; &gt; any European blade (even x-caliber).  The famous grass cutter and\n&gt; &gt; other blades are the holy grails of Samurai Myth & Legend.  I also\n&gt; &gt; know that if a blade is inspected they have a very special method\n&gt; &gt; (almost cermonial) to preserve the blade after inspection.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not really, there are just &quot;things they do.&quot; Things like holding paper in\n&gt; one&#39;s mouth to deflect one&#39;s breath away from the blade (moist breath is\n&gt; great for oxidizing blades, too).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can you tell us exaclty why Samurai blades have survived so long with\n&gt; &gt; so little oxidation?\n&gt;\n&gt; Because people take care of them. They clean them regularly. That&#39;s it. No\n&gt; secrets, no tricks.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Or you can tell me that I&#39;m on crack and\n&gt; &gt; everything I just said was also misinformed.  You are the expert.  I\n&gt; &gt; trust anything you would tell us more than any other western souce.\n&gt;\n&gt; I appreciate the vote of confidence, but armour is really my \n&gt; specialty. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
