There are many different styles and types of armor, but=\r\n have a look at images on the web and you&#39;ll get some idea.\n\n2: A Samurai&#39;s=\r\n swords were like a badge of their rank, this changed over time. Also, the =\r\nSamurai believed their swords had a soul. But, if you think about it, when =\r\neveryone else has a sword to kill you with, wouldn&#39;t you value your own swo=\r\nrds more?\n\n3: The katana and wakizashi.\n\n4: For killing people and making y=\r\nou look tough so that other people wouldn&#39;t try to kill you. The katana, wh=\r\nich was the longest of the two, was your main weapon, while the wakizashi w=\r\nas your backup and the easiest sword to use in doors. You could use both sw=\r\nords together or just the best for the job at hand. Note that at some times=\r\n the samurai might only have his wakizashi, such as when in court.\n\n7: Bush=\r\nido means &quot;way of the warrior&quot; or &quot;warrior way&quot; and was a set of principles=\r\n Samurai were supposed to live by, very much like the European knights code=\r\n of chivalry. \n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Daniel Seo &lt;DigimonD=\r\naniel0907@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.
