Thansk to all of those\n&gt; question and replies.  I \n&gt; love this forum...\n\nOkay, hockey:\n\nYou&#39;re playing a game against another team, and\nthey&#39;ve got one winger who isn&#39;t deadly, but has the\ngood game now and then, and deserves to have one\ndefenseman tail him the whole game. Instead, you have\nyour whole defensive line follow that one guy around,\nleaving the rest of his team&#39;s offense open. Overkill,\nsince the guy isn&#39;t all that good, really--and you&#39;ve\ngot guys missing in the areas where they could make plays.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
