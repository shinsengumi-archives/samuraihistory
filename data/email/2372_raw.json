However,  two points bothered me from his work.  In \nhis Battles of the Samurai,  he stated that the raid on the army of Takeda \nKatsuyori was staged by Oda Nobunaga the night before the battle of Nagashino in \n1575.  However,  in his The Samurai  Sourcebook he went with the other authors \nand stated it  took place in the morning of the battle.  This was a critical \nraid---since it relieved the castle that Takeda was besieging, and also \ncrippled the Takeda clan forces still back at the castle.  To misstate this would be \nakin to saying that JEB Stuart&#39;s cavalry raid did not affect General Lee&#39;s \nConfederate army at Gettysburg in the American Civil War in 1863.  Furthermore,  \nin his Sourcebook,  Turnbull shows an elaborate painting of a Japanese castle \nsiege, complete with European siege engines, which he says is based on the \nresearch he is doing in the Tower Armories in London. I have not had access to \nthose records---however,  in the research I have done in Japanese pictorial \nsources (again I admit to no language facility!)  I have not yet seen depiction&#39;s \nin the Japanese pictures that show anything similar to what Turnbull \nportrays.  Any comments?
