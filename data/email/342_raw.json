This scene is retold and replayed\nin novels\n&gt; and movies by various characters. The message itself was plaintext\nif I\n&gt; recall.\n&gt;     The Takeda used smoke signals to move info across large\ndistances in a\n&gt; hurry, surely they had codes for this. The info you seek may not be\nin ONE\n&gt; book but in books on specific han Lords and or battles.\n&gt;     pray for surf,\n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; slowest reply in the west....\n\nThanks, I&#39;ll look into Date Masamune. I was beginning to fear that\nsamurai / daimyo never used code.\n\nMaybe Japanese use of codes may be more appropriate to the\nMeiji Restoration or the Sino-Japanese war, possible even the\nRusso-Japanese war.\n\n--\nChris\n\n\n\n"
