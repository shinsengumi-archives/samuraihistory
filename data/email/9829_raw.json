Roman Legions did not vanish: the quality of the army was dilu=\r\nted until the Western Empire fell to the barbarian tribes; the Vikings enjo=\r\nyed much power until the black death arrived in Norway in 13th century, onl=\r\ny for the few to survive to be conquered by Danes and Swedes. The class of =\r\n&quot;Knights&quot; continued, but ceased to be a major force on the battlefield (per=\r\nhaps think of the samurai after the Tokogawa shogunite). Longbows are weapo=\r\nnary, and would have become obsolete when there was something better, cheap=\r\ner and easier to train mass infantry, i.e powder and lead to use Marx&#39;s ter=\r\nms. Same with cavalry. when armoured vehicles could be produced more reliab=\r\nly, quicker and cheaply, horses, cavalry ceased to be an important force on=\r\n the battlefield. Just look at the first great war, most nations use cavalr=\r\ny (think of Lawerence of Arabia), but the second great war, scarcly a horse=\r\n is photographed in the entire campaign. Soldiers and ruins? I think poor l=\r\neadership leads to ruins - not soldiers per se.\n \nRegards T.

After that, Buke had been g=\r\nrowing and increasing power gradualy. Buke did have stronger power than Emp=\r\neror since Heisi ( Kiyomori Taira ) and followed by Genji ( Yoritomo ) , th=\r\nen Asikaga, warriors days to Nobunaga, Hideyosi, and Yeyasu Tokugawa ( Shog=\r\nun ) for over 260 years, ruining Japan . Even under Buke, Emperor has been =\r\nstill aliving.However, at the end of Tokugawa , Edo era, Buke had been vani=\r\nshed completely and disappeared . Then, under new government , MEIJI, Emper=\r\nor returned and started to ruin Japan again .Why did Buke vanish in Japanes=\r\ne history after 1,000 years since birth ? _________________________________=\r\n_________________________Ota nyt k=E4ytt=F6=F6si uuden sukupolven Windows L=\r\nive palvelut!http://get.live.com[Non-text portions of this message have bee=\r\nn removed] \n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________=\r\n_______\nSee the most popular videos on the web \nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go=\r\n/115454061/direct/01/\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n\n\n"
