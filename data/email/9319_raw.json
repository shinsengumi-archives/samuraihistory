It tells a story about Otori Clan. Was there really a clan called Otori? It also tells about people with extraordinary skills (such as duplicating himself, jump as high as 10 metres an so on) called the tribe. Is that true? or it&#39;s just the author&#39;s imagination?\n   \n  well, i guess that&#39;s all for this moment. thank you!\n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n \n---------------------------------\nEveryone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!
