Not\nall films outside of Hollywood are made that cynical=\r\nly, or are you\nmaking a sweeping generalisation here?  And what is wrong wi=\r\nth\nentertainment if it gives you a stepping stone into learning more? \nAnd =\r\nhow does something that inspires an interest, like a good film\ndoes, automa=\r\ntically become suspect?  And how do you know (and I mean\nKNOW, without any =\r\ndoubt) that the historical things you read are\naccurate and truthful and no=\r\nt slanted to suit the political agenda of\nthe writer.  How many documentari=\r\nes have you seen where they get the\nbasic, fundamental things wrong and the=\r\n narrator can&#39;t even pronounce\nsimple things correctly?  How many books abo=\r\nut a specific subject have\nyou read, and then found another with an opposin=\r\ng view?  Does any of\nthis really matter, unless you want to think of yourse=\r\nlf as an\n&quot;expert&quot; or a definitive source of knowledge?  And finally, since =\r\nwe\nare all capable of telling the difference between a film made for pure\ne=\r\nntertainment and one made with loftier ideals, isn&#39;t turning your\nnose up a=\r\nt all films a bit pointless?\n\nWhether Kurosawa used poetic licence or not i=\r\nn order to make a more\nentertaining film, who on earth cares?  I wasn&#39;t awa=\r\nre that he was a\ndocumentary maker who had sworn a blood oath to only depic=\r\nt all the\ntruths that anyone ever wrote about the latter days of Takeda Shi=\r\nngen.\n I&#39;ve seen any number of films about Shingen, all of them give you a\n=\r\ndifferent viewpoint, most are entertaining too.  What&#39;s the bet that\nmost b=\r\nooks about him have just as many viewpoints but slightly less\nentertainment=\r\n value.  Why does it matter?  Are you concerned that we\nare gullible enough=\r\n to believe that a film is equal to the truth?  \nIf I couldn&#39;t tell the dif=\r\nference I&#39;d need locking up.  My point is\nthis, just because films are not =\r\na reliable source, doesn&#39;t mean that\nevery history book IS, and you can&#39;t k=\r\nnow anyway, because you weren&#39;t\nthere, and those that were there won&#39;t nece=\r\nssarily write everything as\nit happened if it doesn&#39;t suit their purpose.  =\r\nSaying, in effect, film\n=3Dlies and half truths, history book =3D 100% corr=\r\nect is still daft. \nAssuming that I believe every film I see to be a docume=\r\nntary is insulting.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter =\r\n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Because film is inherently about entertainment, =\r\nand\n&gt; therefore ticket sales, not about accuracy. Even\n&gt; Kurosawa doesn&#39;t t=\r\nry to do everything\n&gt; &quot;accurately&quot;--his depiction of Nagashino in\n&gt; &quot;Kagemu=\r\nsha&quot; is nowhere near accurate. It&#39;s all for\n&gt; dramatic effect, though, whic=\r\nh suits his purpose. Is\n&gt; that morally wrong? No. However, we should recogn=\r\nize\n&gt; fiction for fiction, and not place too much faith in\n&gt; its historical=\r\n accuracy. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Yahoo!
