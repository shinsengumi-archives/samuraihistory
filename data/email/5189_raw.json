The book was out in the\n&gt; early &#39;70s, before the\n&gt; cresting of the wave of ninja silliness, and it\n&gt; appeared to be fairly\n&gt; solidly researched.  I shed my copy back in &#39;75, so\n&gt; I can&#39;t cite the\n&gt; author&#39;s name.\n&gt; Nate, don&#39;t go thinking I&#39;m one of your &quot;resident\n&gt; ninja masters&quot; on account\n&gt; of this, okay?\n&gt; Gereg\n\nGereg--\n\nI&#39;m glad--I&#39;d be afraid of being killed in the night.\nMy SECOM security system is no match for a ninja\nmaster!\n\nBasically the shaken/shuriken thing is what I meant.\nHaving nothing to quote, I went from memory, and added\nthe caveat about &quot;other names&quot;.
