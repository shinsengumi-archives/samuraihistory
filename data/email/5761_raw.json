Unfortunatly the only experience I have \nwith JAWS is from my ex-girlfriend.  She is totally blind and could use that \ncomputer better than most seasoned pros.  Of course the mouse was never used \nso I leared a LOT of keyboard commands just by watching her.  It was my \nrelationship with her that helped me to decide what I want to do with my \nlife.\n  Anyhow, enough rambling.  Best of luck with getting your upgrades.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet ready for school!
