The akunoya is the most commodious \nalternative, but I know of no evidence supporting the notion that \npeople made a habit of sleeping in the things. There are a couple of \nshelter alternatives which may have been used by some ashigari on \ncampaign, but I doubt that you will want to actually use one of these. \nThey appear to be essentially a low roughly tubular structure of bent \nbamboo lashed together with mino (straw rain capes) thrown over and \nmaybe a bit of matting unrolled on the ground inside. Some Japanese \nbooks on sengoku jidai campaigns suggest that low ranking bushi may \nhave huddled under tate (large shields) or even in holes dug into \nembankments. If you had rank, then you took over a neighboring temple \nor something like that. There are also some suggestions of nagaya being \nset up for some of the troops.\n\n\n\n\n"
