Maybe I&#39;m in a bit of a rush; I\nhaven&#39;t been able to sit down at a library w/enough time. I\nattend school p/t and work f/t; I squeeze the time that I\ncan spare into this! You are definitely 100% correct. I\nfigured that I would get feedback (opinions) and see what\nyou, and everyone else, thinks. Why this certain period vs.\nthat certain period. I figured you  guys can be a compass;\npoint and I&#39;ll go. With enough interest in one period, I\nmight research the other or simply go with the flow.\n\nMelvin\n\n\n--- &quot;Anthony J.

Pre Tokugawa? Tokugawa? After America sought\n&gt; trade?\n&gt; &gt; Between Edo and Kyoto, I am unsure which city would be\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; interesting. Edo is a distance from Kyoto. Did more\n&gt; action\n&gt; &gt; take place in and/or around Kyoto? I can look within an\n&gt; &gt; encyclopedias but I would rather focus on one time\n&gt; period\n&gt; &gt; at a time; I get overwhelmed. You folks can supply me\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; more detail in certain areas than an encyclopedia can.\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; would appreciate your time and knowledge. Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a writer, I&#39;d like to make a few (stupid sounding at\n&gt; first) suggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Know the story you want to tell first.\n&gt; 2. Put the setting in the period where it belongs.\n&gt; 3. Make the setting the place that is appropriate.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can&#39;t tell you anything because we don&#39;t know the\n&gt; story you&#39;re writing.\n&gt; Only you can do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
