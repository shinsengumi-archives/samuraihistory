Silly me not\n\n&gt; seeing in first place.  The site is in Japanese but the links are \n&gt; clear and there is english Language, it is part of the Yasaki Inari \n&gt; shrine, and it has many excellent pictures. Link is \n&gt; www.tctv.ne.jp/uma490/ I hope it works this time.  Anyhow I am glad\nI \n&gt; found this topic as I am finding out loads of interesting stuff.  \n&gt; Soon I want to create a website focusing on the samurai hats and \n&gt; their history and function, it is a bit off the wall but if anyone \n&gt; has pics of samurai hats, can be helmets but mostly civilian and \n&gt; military head wear.  So if any one has any pi ctures I would \n&gt; appreciate them very much.  I have found lots in Ukiyo-e. This\nshould \n&gt; also help Melvin and everyone else for that matter.  Japaense Hats \n&gt; rock ^^^^^^^^. \n&gt; \n\n\nGo to http://www.sengokudaimyo.com and follow the clothing link.\nThere&#39;s a page (in the works) on headgear.\n\nTony\n\n"
