Although cast-iron \ncannon became available ca 1550, these were much more difficult to \ncast, and bronze remained the metal of choice until the mid to late \nC17. Since the &#39;De Liefde&#39; arrived in Kyushu in 1600, is it not highly \nlikely that its cannon were of bronze rather than of iron?\n\nIs there an expert on cannon out there somewhere who can clarify this \npoint for me?\n\nRegards, John L.\n\n--- In nihontostudy@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve just discovered this little gem about the history of Namban \ntetsu (foreign steel) in Japanese history and the involvement of the \nDutch V.O.C. Company. Namban tetsu was used in the making of swords \nand so recorded on the sword tang.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tokensugita.com/NT.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas.\n\n::::::::::::::  CROSS-POSTING FROM TOKEN_KENKYU_KAI LIST  ::::::::::::::\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dr. Philip Vos Fellman&quot; &lt;shirogitsune99@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;token_kenkyu_kai@...&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, February 21, 2007 11:33 AM\nSubject: Re: NAMBAN TETSU\n\n\nHi All:\n\n  You can get a better picture of Japan&#39;s comparative\ntrade position, in part from a book I found in the\nCornell University library (actually translated into\nEnglish believe it or not) &quot;Japan Must Fight Britain&quot;\nby Lt. Commander Tota Isshimaru, Imperial Japanese\nNavy, 1926.  A lot of good discussion on the British\nuse of Singapore to promote trade monopolies.\n\nCheers,\n\nPhil\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
