Then I understand why he brought out\nhis blades.   Katana was considered the soul of the\nsamurai since it was considered what ebodied bushido. \n This is interesting, a samurai think that his sword\nis an extention of his body.  So he consider his sword\na part of it.   Besides, it was his primary weapon,\nhis life depends on it ( think about this carefully ).\n  The katana is that, a weapon !!!   And the samurai\nmore than any one else new that.   \nSomething funny about this is that there is anything\non the Bushido code that have to do with weapons !!!\nIt is a moral and correct conduct code.    Then I\nthink that all this is a romantic tale out of some\nNoh.   \nNow, if you tell me that a samurai fells something\nspecial and spiritual for his sword, I will be with\nyou in a 100%.   \n\nBest regards.    \n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n"
