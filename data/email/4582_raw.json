I know it&#39;s not technically samurai history, but it&#39;s a\n&gt;  great illustration of how the term &#39;samurai&#39; is being bandied about\n&gt;  nowadays.\n&gt;\n&gt;  BERLIN (Reuters) - A camouflage-clad German man wielding a samurai\n&gt;  sword attacked at least seven hikers in forests west of Berlin,\n&gt;  performing sword tricks before ordering them to leave the woods,\n&gt;  police said Friday.\n&gt;  They suspect a 46-year-old local man who trained in martial arts and\n&gt;  survival skills in camps in Papua New Guinea and Vietnam to be the\n&gt;  attacker.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot;He&#39;s dangerous and has been hard to find because he wears\n&gt;  camouflage,&quot; said Catrin Feistauer, spokeswoman for the Nauen police\n&gt;  department. Police have used infrared cameras mounted on helicopters\n&gt;  to try and track him down.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The man pushed two elderly people off their bikes and, flashing his\n&gt;  sword, shouted at them to leave the forest. He later tried to drive a\n&gt;  young couple out of the woods. No one was seriously hurt.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot;It&#39;s frightening because the violence level has increased each\n&gt;  time,&quot; Feistauer said.\n\nWow this is awesome! Let&#39;s do it! Let&#39;s all join, wear samurai armors \nand hide in a forest to scare the hikers!! Sounds like a lot of fun!! \n:oD\ncepo\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
