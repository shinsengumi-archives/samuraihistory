I bought=\r\n it this \nyear on my trip to the bi-annual Kulmbach Zinnfigur Boerse in Ger=\r\nmany. \nUnfortunately it is in Polish!! Polish is as unintelligible to me as=\r\n japanese - but then \nI enjoy the challenge.. but for polish readers worth =\r\na look.  Here is a \nreview I put together:\n\n\n\nKAWANAKAJIMA 1561\n\n\nby : Wito=\r\nld Nowakowski illustrations: Piotr Prominski cost : apx 14 euro\n\n\n1561 was =\r\nthe year of the fourth battle at Kawanakajima between the two \nrivals, Take=\r\nda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin, and one of the most bloodiest, in terms \nof =\r\ncasualties, of the 16th century. What makes this battle more of interest is=\r\n \nthat Shingen drew up his battle lines after nightfall and completed manou=\r\nvers \nbefore first light. However, what should have been a surprise attack =\r\non the \nunwarry Uesugi was thwarted and instead the Takeda were subjected t=\r\no the focus \nof attacks from a well practised tactical development by Kensh=\r\nin.  Kenshin had \nbeen made aware of Shingens night movements and had under=\r\ntaken his own \nplacements under cover of the same darkness. The Takeda forc=\r\nes came under great \npresssure but held firm to &quot;win&quot; the day with a loss o=\r\nf around 14000, including \nmany important family members and generals. The =\r\nUesugi losses were similar but \naccounted for a higher proportion of troops=\r\n engaged.\n\n\nThe book is one of a series of books, produced by Bellona [ \nht=\r\ntp://ksiegarnia.bellona.pl]and published in Poland - in polish, discussing =\r\nthe background and \nthe events leading up to the warfare. &quot;Kawanakajima 156=\r\n1&quot; is well illustrated \nwith colour artwork, maps and prints in a format si=\r\nmilar to Osprey but \nslightly smaller [160x235] - cosisting of 48 pages of =\r\nwhich 8 are in full colour. \nThe new artwork is reminiscient of Angus McBri=\r\nde&#39;s style [almost identical] with \nthe figures represented being rather sq=\r\nuat and short. The work relies heavily \non previously work published in Osp=\r\nrey - Turnbull and Bryant - and the red \nbook Rekishi Series. An ideal book=\r\n for readers who would find reading Polish \neasier than English. However, S=\r\ntephen Turnbull is due to publish an Osprey \nCampaign Series later this yea=\r\nr tittled &quot;Kawanakajima 1553-64&quot;. {truely SRT has been \nvery busy with the =\r\npen this last year!}\n\n\n{Here is the AMAZON pre publication notes on this.}\n=\r\n\n\nTURNBULL Paperback; November 25 2003; 96 pages; ISBN: 1841765627 =A312.99=\r\n\n\n\nKawanakajima is unique in history. In the space of 12 years, between 155=\r\n3 and \n1564, this valley deep in the mountains of central Japan witnessed n=\r\no less \nthan five battles between two of Japan&#39;s greatest warlords. Takeda =\r\nShingen and \nUesugi Kenshin were both descended from great families and wer=\r\ne highly skilled \ntacticians. Both had taken the tonsure and risen to high =\r\nrank in their \nrespective Buddhist sects. When Shingen attempted to seize c=\r\nontrol of Shinano \nprovince they were set on a collision course. Stephen Tu=\r\nrnbull chronicles the see-saw \nstruggle between two men who epitomize the w=\r\narrior daimyo from Japan&#39;s \n&#39;Warring States&#39; period. \n\n\n\nContents \n\n\nOrigin=\r\ns of the campaigns; Chronology; Opposing Commanders; Opposing Armies; \nOppo=\r\nsing Plans; The Kawanakajima campaigns (1553, 1555, 1557, 1561, 1564) ; \nAf=\r\ntermath; The Battlefield Today; Bibliography ; Index\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions=\r\n of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
