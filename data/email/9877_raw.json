I believe there was a similar game by the same publisher entitled Kessen and Kessen 2 that are the period and country he is requesting.\n\nAlso, Samurai Warriors Empires is a fun game, not quite as accurate, but still, entertaining.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com on behalf of Bryan\nSent: Thu 3/5/2009 2:49 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Question for historical wargamers\n \n-This will be slightly off topic on your war-games question, but it is viable and related anyway I feel.\n\nSo my game suggestion is Dynasty Tactics and Dynasty Tactics Two for the Playstation 2.  The sequel is better, and the setting is the Three Kingdoms period in China, but it is arguably a similar time period with the samurai in Japan.  The games is somewhat abstract, turn based, and involves armies lead by officers who convey special movements and tactics.  It is turn based and on tiles almost like a chessboard except with different terrains and fortresses and things. Armies are made up of units like archers, swordsmen, pike men, crossbows, catapults, cavalry, engineers, etc.  Also there are different goals like taking specific castles, capturing specific enemy officers, and more.\n\nThese games are both very fun and easy to get into games, and both are probably very cheap on the web as they are older titles.\n\nKoei who publishes these games does make other samurai related video games, and I always wanted this type of game made with Samurai involved.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nBryan B. \n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
