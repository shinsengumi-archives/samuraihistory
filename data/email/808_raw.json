On one\n&gt; hand I&#39;d think that it would be very effective against laquered\n&gt; bamboo armour due to the crushing wieght of the axe blade, however I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want to fight someone who is carrying a sword with an axe -\n&gt; a heavy unbalanced (and slow) weapon like an axe couldn&#39;t stand up to\n&gt; a well balanced katana, could it?\n&gt;\n\n&lt;rage&gt; Armour! Was! Not! Bamboo! &lt;/rage&gt;\n\nFor all it&#39;s frightening look, the ono doesn&#39;t seem to have had much use. It\nwasn&#39;t a standard weapon the armies were equipped with. I believe that, like\nthe tetsubo, it was something that had been more in use earlier when armies\nwere less rigidly made.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
