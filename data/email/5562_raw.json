Dakota) would be \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;last&quot; samurai derived of the Satsuma Reb.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Huh?  how do you figure?\n\nI&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m trying to learn the post-1865 samurai history mostly \nconcerned with the Japanese American imigrants to the US. I believe \nthe &quot;last&quot; samurai comment is a vague area. I&#39;ll explain.\n  Known facts :1877 Satsuma led by Saigo Takamori attack Kumamoto \nCastle. US tries peace agreements prior to attack.\n  I understand up to this point.(well documented) \nI&#39;m trying to find if the US govt took samarai family names\n(hereditary) + first names of all children in family at this time. \nThen..fast fwd.. to 1941-42 WWII.  Prior to Roosevelt&#39;s Ex. Order \n9066 (forced internment) there were JA men who were &quot;arrested/taken&quot; \naway. No charge against..no explaination(which i want to find). \nThese men were taken to North Dakota. As I have been told these men \nin North Dakota(not sure how many) were all either present or family \nwere present at the time of Satsuma reb. 1877 and were on the side \nof the Imp. Army?? fighting the Satsuma clan. Which makes sense to \nme on the US side to see Samurai in US but loyal to fight for \nMeiji.  But please correct me if my history is in err.  \n So i&#39;m looking for any information about this.  And from my \nunderstanding most of this information was held in both govt. and \nsamurai family secret until ?late 70&#39;s?.  \n  All this information should provide me with the answer to &quot;The \nFastest Hands in Japan&quot;--quoted from a dying 96 yr old man. born 1870\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
