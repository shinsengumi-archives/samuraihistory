Knowledge was job security. Human nature \nbeing what it is, there&#39;s probably a bit of that in the later period \nschools.\n\n&gt;Correct practice makes perfect. A slightly improved saying.\n&gt;G:  I&#39;d say both of those have merit; I don&#39;t think they&#39;re quite the same. The former speaks more to me of training the intuition, the latter of training the form.  The art would be incomplete without both.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m not that mystical, training is training, but what do you expect from \nsome literal minded engineer ;) Several reasons for very indirect in the \nWest, I suspect apply in period Japan as well, we just have documented \nevidence for them in the West. Somebody on the list may know of the \nEastern evidence as well.\n\n1. Job security\n2. I know something you don&#39;t know! Childish, but powerful motives.\n3. Worry about skill being inappropriately used without complete training.\n4. Technique is more effective than the usual methods, more money or \nvictories possible.\n5. Forcing the student to pay attention and respect their teacher.\n\nJust random thoughts.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n"
