At one time, they held appointments in Aki,\nbut it was well before the Mori came to prominence.\nWhen Mori Motonari defeated Sue Harukata at Miyajima\nin 1551 to take control of the former Ouchi lands, the\nTakeda clan was concentrated in Kai under Shingen, and\nwas busy fighting the Uesugi, Hojo, Imagawa, et al.\nThe Takeda were long gone from Aki by this point. \n\nIt gets confusing, because there were about 8 or 9\nfamilies that held multiple Shugo appointments under\nthe Ashikaga, often with no semblance of geographic\nrelations (by design, perhaps). The Shiba held\nappointments in Owari, Totomi, Echizen, and a couple\nother provinces on and off. The Takeda were at various\ntimes Shugo of Aki, Wakasa, Kai (their traditional\nhome, I believe), and possibly somewhere in Kyushu for\na brief period. The Imagawa had Suruga, lands in\nnorthern Kyushu, etc. In the transition from Ashikaga\nShugo to Sengoku daimyo, if the shugo family survived,\nusually in centralized in one location and lost it&#39;s\nland elsewhere. Takeda centralized in Kai, Imagawa in\nSuruga, etc. The Shiba died. Other shugo daimyo like\nthe Shimazu held contiguous holdings (Satsuma, Osumi,\npart of Hyuga) so it was fairly easy to hold onto\ntheir territory and make the transition. Of course,\nthey became Ashikaga Shugo for the same reason\nHideyoshi and Ieyasu later confirmed them in their\nholdings--it would have been harder to uproot them\nthan to just let them stay, since the Shimazu had\nruled the area since, oh, about the time of Jimmu\nTenno, it seems. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
