A larger force (or a\n&gt; large force showing up at the proper time) might have\n&gt; cause a quicker rout from the loyalists there by\n&gt; ending the battle quicker.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Although since the rout first seemed to occur with the\n&gt; Shimazu, and they are not known for their weak\n&gt; spirits, perhaps it would not have had an effect\n&gt; afterall.&quot;\n\nTokugawa had 30,000 of his own troops (and several thousand more \nunder Ikeda, Asano, et al) present on the battlefield that were never \nengaged, so the size of the attacking force was not a problem. \nThe rout began shortly after Kobayakawa turned traitor and other \nnearby Western troops also defected, overunning Otani and getting \ninto the rear of the Konishi and Ukita forces (who had been bearing \nthe brunt of the Eastern assault). The Shimazu had been holding their \nground quite well and only left the battlefield when the Ukita and \nKonishi forces broke up and the Ishida forces had fled. Out of the \n1500 Shimazu troops, very few survived the retreat.\n\n\n\n"
