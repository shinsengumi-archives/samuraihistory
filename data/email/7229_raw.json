I&#39;ve just found out\nI&#39;m going to be an Auntie.\n\nJust to clarify, if you are interested -\n\n&gt; Um...yeah. If I used the name &quot;Jim&quot; in a story, that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean anyone named Jim would be suing me if\n&gt; they didn&#39;t like what I wrote. So yes, you need to\n&gt; say\n&gt; more for me to understand why you can&#39;t use it.\n&gt; Though\n\nThe character in the novel is based very closely on a\ntrue-life person with the name Makoto. \n \n&gt; Canadian-born Japanese, not Japanese-born Japanese.\n&gt; &quot;Tad&quot; isn&#39;t pronounceable to a native Japanese\n&gt; speaker--the only final consonant in Japanese is\n&gt; &quot;N&quot;,\n&gt; so Tad would come out &quot;Taddo&quot;. But, if he&#39;s being\n&gt; given the nickname by non-Japanese, then it would\n&gt; follow their patterns, not Japanese ones. Assuming\n&gt; the\n&gt; American/Canadian/whatever in your story are the\n&gt; ones\n&gt; giving him the nickname, this should be fine.\n\nWell, as I said, the character (and the story) are\nbased on real events and people, and in this &#39;real\nevent / people&#39; situation, believe it or not the name\nTad was used by the persons Japanese speaking/ born\nfriends. Perhaps they didn&#39;t originally give it to\nhim, but there you go. The Japanese in the story/truth\nspent most of their lives in Canada, probably explains\nit.\n\nthanks for your help!\n\nall the best.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDiscover Yahoo! \nGet on-the-go sports scores, stock quotes, news and more.
