Historic accuracy right out the window!  Read on if you dare!\n\nI&#39;ve=\r\n got so much churning around in my head that I need an outlet. \nWell, I&#39;ve =\r\ndedicated my web comic to just such an outlet.  If you&#39;ve\nnever heard of a =\r\n&quot;web comic&quot;, well its a sequential artwork story\n(comic book) on the World =\r\nWide Web; hence web-comic.  eh? eh?  Nice huh :)\n\nanyway, here is something=\r\n fun that some of you might enjoy reading...\nits FREE... just me expressing=\r\n my artistry.\n\nhttp://banditt.uber-geek.us/web-comic.html\n\nI&#39;m trying to re=\r\nally recreate an authentic Manga.  I&#39;ve bought &quot;Manga\nStudio&quot; to do toner a=\r\nnd between that and Photoshop, I&#39;m getting some\nnice effects.  All illustra=\r\ntions are HAND DRAWN.  I scan in my\nmanuscripts and then add the text and t=\r\noner.\n\nIf anyone has some feedback regarding the attempts, by golly, let me=\r\n\nhave it! :)  I love hearing from folks and trying to make myself\nbetter.  =\r\nWho knows?  Maybe Tokyo Pop will pick me up down the road? \n*dear God PLEAS=\r\nE let SOMEBODY pick me up, I NEED the steady work!* \nAnd Please feel free t=\r\no pass the word on, if you know someone who\nmight enjoy the story.\n\nthanks =\r\nand as always, your humble little Sanada wanabe (pun),\n~Jason/Katsu\n\n\n\n"
