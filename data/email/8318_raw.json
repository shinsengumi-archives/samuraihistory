I am glad to see a group like this and I hope to have \nmany g=\r\nood conversations with all of you. I am an American living in the \nbeautifu=\r\nl country side of Kanaya Japan. I am a member of several \nhistorical groups=\r\n which seek to protect and restore old houses as well \nas educate young Jap=\r\nanese in the values of thier heritage. I am in no \nway and expert but if th=\r\nere is any questions on life during the Azuchi \nmomoyama or Edo periods I w=\r\nould be happy to research them for you. \nPeriodically I sell small Japanese=\r\n antiques and frequent many flea \nmarkets and antique shops so I don`t mind=\r\n looking for some particular \nitem for you as long as you`re willing to pay=\r\n the shipping cost which \ncan be quite expensive. Anyway again, I`m glad to=\r\n meet you all.\n\nRobert Hirai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
