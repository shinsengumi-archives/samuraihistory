Part of the reason \nfor this of course is that other cultures didn&#39;t have to pray at exact \ntimes like the Catholic church of the period insisted on. I do remember \nseeing a book on the subject but if I recollect properly, clockmaking \ndoesn&#39;t get started until the Jesuits show up.\n\nStill cool for later period stuff.\n\nSome stuff off a website:\n\nWe have a number of such books on general or specific technologies \npublished during the period, as never existed in the preceding era. \nProgress in printing and the demand for information from industrialists \nstimulated their publication. Number, variety and contents of these \nbooks far more superseded those written in the contemporary China, and \nwe may compare them with the Renaissance and Baroque technical books of \nEurope. Most of them are reprinted with commentary and notes by modern \neditors.\n\nWe can classify these books in several categories: first, compendium or \nencyclopedia; second, picture book; third, practical text; and fourth, \nmemorandum of practioner. Karakuri-kimmo-kagamigusa (automaton) 1730; \nKarakuri-zui (clock & automaton) 1796; &lt;snip snip snip&gt;\n\nIn addition to these books local historians are searching for materials \nof related subjects in unpublished letters or reports.\n\nMore:\n\nThe first mechanical clocks introduced to Japan were probably Italian \nand Dutch clocks presented as gifts by European merchants in the early \nto mid sixteenth century. Between 1550 and 1650 there was a strong \nmissionary influence in Japan, particularly the Jesuits, who taught \nclock making. In 1650 all Europeans were ejected from Japan with the \nexception of a small European enclave at Nagasaki. Early Japanese clocks \ntherefore used Western technology to keep the Chino/Japanese time system.\n\nThis time system divides the day into two parts, each with six two hours \nperiods. The first is from sun up to sun down and the second from sun \ndown to sun up. The problem is obviously that with changing seasons the \ndark hours and the light hours will be relatively longer or shorter. \nThis resulted in two kinds of clock, one with a variable running speed \nand fixed markers or one with a constant running speed and movable markers.\n\nIn 1853 Perry re-established a European presence in Japan and in 1873 \nthe Japanese revoked their traditional time keeping system and adopted \nWestern time keeping. Traditional Japanese clocks have therefore become \nvery collectible.\n\nMore:!\nWhen the Dutch factory chief Isaac Titsingh left Japan in 1784, he \ndecided to take home a local timepiece. He was furious with the \nshogunate for its intransigence and stymieing of trade, and feigned \nillness to be relieved on his post ahead of schedule. But the clocks of \nJapan were something for which he had nothing but admiration. &quot;I \nexamined a clock&quot;, he wrote on his return, &quot;in the palace of the \ngovernor of Nagasaki; and as the construction seemed curious, I was \ndesirous of bringing one with me from Japan.&quot; Yet trade being fettered \nas it was, &quot;the high price demanded for them deprived me of this \ngratification&quot; (Isaac Titsingh, /Illustrations of Japan/, 1822; p.159). \nFortunately later travellers were better heeled, and there are clock \ncollections in the West. But we have waited until now for a proper \nexhibition of Japanese clocks in all their &#39;curiousness&#39;. This wonderful \nshow (which goes far beyond just clocks) should not be missed.\n\nMany items used in Japanese time-keeping are not indigenous, and had \nTitsingh looked closer, he might have seen workings not dissimilar to \nEuropean ones; very possibly the governor&#39;s clock included imported \nparts. Steel springs could not be made in Japan, neither could small \ncogwheels. In fact, clocks and pocket watches were extensively imported \nto Japan, where the latter became known as &quot;London clocks&quot; \n(/rondon-dokei/); it is often forgotten that England lost its \nhorological priority to Switzerland only in the 19th century. A samurai \nand wit, Ota Nanpo, wrote of the situation in Edo at just the moment \nTitsingh was in town. &quot;No-one was without an imported European clock \nslipped in at his breast&quot; (Ota Nanpo, &#39;Ichiwa ichigon&#39;, in /Zoku nihon \nzuihitsu taisei/, supplement, 1978, p.197).\n\nTime is told differently in different parts of the globe, and it was a \nfeature of Japanese time telling to assign six hours to daylight and six \nto darkness. This meant that, other than at the equinoxes, a day-time \nand a night-time hour were not the same, and that they fluctuated \nagainst each other throughout the year. Full time &#39;masters of clocks&#39; \n(/tokeishi/) regulated the weights that hung from the gyrating spindles \nto retard or quicken movement. Not for nothing went the comic verse,\n\n\nHowever cunningly made,\nA clock&#39;s workings\nAre just too many\n\t\t/D� kuf� shite mo tokei/\n/no wa ga amari/\n/Haif� yanagi-daru/\n\n\n\n&lt;JavaScript: newWindow = RevealWin( &#39;P00852_I00721_01123_pop.html&#39;, \n&#39;screech3006_1&#39;,229,455,1);&gt;\n\n\t\n\n&lt;JavaScript: newWindow = RevealWin( &#39;P00852_I00721_01123_pop.html&#39;, \n&#39;screech3006_1&#39;,229,455,1);&gt;*Mechanical Japanese Clock*\nJapan, Edo period (1615-1868)\n\nTime in Japan&#39;s cities was mostly measured by the booming of hour-bells \n(/toki no kane/), either those erected for the purpose, or those \nco-opted from local temples. The bell at the city entrance to Edo rang \nan hour ahead to ensure those going to attend at the castle would never \nbe late. Edo&#39;s main hour-bell was in Kokuch�, which happened to be by \nthe Dutch East India Company&#39;s hostel. This spawned many jokes of a \nculturally relative kind.\n\nThis is fundamentally an art exhibition, and the technical pieces on \ndisplay are mostly given the backdrop of a painting or print \nillustrating them in real spaces. /Ukiyo-e/ prints � the forte of \nTimothy Clark who curated this show � are copiously used in evidence. \nMore than half of the gallery is given over to other instances of \ntime-telling, such as representations of the signs of the so-called \nChinese Zodiac (actually not a zodiac at all), with which most people \ntoday are familiar. These signs (monkey, cock, tiger, etc.) were used in \nfashion ornaments, such as /netsuke/ toggles, or were the subject of \nfull-blown paintings. A painting of a dragon, for example, would be \nappropriate to put out in a Year of the Dragon (like 2000), and as the \nsigns came around every 12 years, it was worth the cost of buying such \nthings, each according to their budget. People might display the sign of \ntheir birth, and the grave of the third Shogun, Iemitsu, is covered with \nhares, as this was his natal sign.\n\nThe cycle of the year has a place in the heart of anyone who has \nreceived a Japanese education, and paintings of the four seasons, the \ntwelve months, or the festivals and events proper to these are all \ncommon in Japanese visual arts. It is a feature of Japanese painting, \nnot seen elsewhere on the Asian continent, to depict a single landscape \nacross a complete year, usually with two seasons per screen across a \npair. Some good examples are on display in the Japan Time exhibition.\n\nYet More!\n\n*/A very rare and unusual watch. The Japanese based their method of \ntimekeeping on a Chinese system which is somewhat eccentric, the length \nof their periods of time altering throughout the year. Each 24 hour day \nis divided into its two natural sections, day and night. These are then \ndivided into six equal parts. This necessitates allowing mechanical \ntimekeepers to have adjustable markings. Timepieces made for the \nJapanese market are rare. This is the only example of a clockwatch we \nhave seen. The case itself is also somewhat odd, being large and deep. \nIt would have originally had a protective case or box made of leather or \nperhaps wood. /*\n\n\nI&#39;ve probably bored you silly now.\nSumimasen,\nJim Eckman\n\n\n"
