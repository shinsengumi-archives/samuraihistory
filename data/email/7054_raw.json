Masaaki\n&gt; Hatsumi is in the film and this is sufficient for\n&gt; me.   Each one is free to administer its knowledge\n&gt; as want.  \n\nAs an Intelligence Officer, I&#39;m trained to research,\nevaluate, analyze, and recommend. The first decision\nto make is &quot;Is this worth my time?&quot; Anyone in academia\nwill tell you that if you want to judge the quality of\nsomeone&#39;s research, check out their sources. Hayes is\nhardly a &quot;source&quot; of anything but Hollywood\nmisinformation. If this documentary is going to use\nhim as a source, then there&#39;s no reason for me to\nwaste my time clicking on the link, much less watching\nthe dang thing. And last I checked, Hayes learned from\nHatsumi. Ergo (That means &quot;therefore&quot;), I don&#39;t see\nmuch reason to be excited about him, either. Let me\nbreak it down: Hayes = fraud. Hatsumi taught Hayes\neverything he knows. That makes Hatsumi a.....?\n\nCriminy, if people would put down the martial arts\nmagazines and pick up a history book, this crap\nwouldn&#39;t keep coming back. \n\n&gt; Or ï¿½it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by\n&gt; the Budo Taijutsu?  \n\nNot a CLUE what you&#39;re saying here. I&#39;m assuming that\nEnglish isn&#39;t your first language. \n\n&gt; In my country we have a thought: &quot;when the words are\n&gt; not better than the silence, is better to silence&quot;. \n\nWhat country are you from? I assume that research\nstandards there aren&#39;t up to par with what you&#39;d\nexpect from REAL historical research, and not\nHollywood or martial arts fantasy, in the US or Japan.\n\n\n&gt; I recommend you see the film and train dogs, not\n&gt; martial arts. Not with a heart closed.\n\nThanks for the pseudo-zen, that really makes me feel\nshamed into reading my fortune cookies next time. Go\nahead, believe the hype--enjoy your &quot;ninjutsu&quot;. As I\nsaid before, I&#39;ll stick to Owl&#39;s Castle. \n\n\n\t\t\nDiscover Yahoo! \nStay in touch with email, IM, photo sharing and more.
