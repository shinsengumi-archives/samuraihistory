In the 1860s, Japan was in tumult as th=\r\ne Tokugawa regime looked to be coming to an end. Anti-shogun feelings were =\r\nrunning high following the capitulation to the Black Ships. =93Revere the E=\r\nmperor, Expel the Foreigners=94 (=93Sonno joi=94) was the slogan of the day=\r\n. \nTo counteract supporters of the emperor, who had gathered in Kyoto, the =\r\nshogunate set up a special police force who were recruited from amongst the=\r\n leading swordsmen of Edo. But after being sent to Kyoto, many turned out t=\r\no sympathise with the opposition. The group was disbanded, though a nucleus=\r\n remained behind to continue. \nThe most prominent member was an arrogant sa=\r\nmurai called Serizawa Kamo who took advantage of his position by running up=\r\n debts, abusing women and picking fights. The gang had such a bad reputatio=\r\nn that it was named =93Mibu-ro,=94 a wordplay referring to their base at Mi=\r\nbu which could mean either =93Mibu ronin=94 or =93Mibu wolves.=94 \nSerizawa=\r\n was assassinated in an internal plot, thought to have been carried out by =\r\nKondo Isami and his right-hand man Hijikata Toshizo, who became the new lea=\r\nders. Though not samurai themselves, they were dedicated men who believed i=\r\nn warrior ethics (bushido) and embodied the group=92s slogan: Sincerity (Ma=\r\nkoto). \nThe group lived by a strict code, known as gohatto. Amongst its sti=\r\npulations was that once you became a member, you could never leave. Brother=\r\nhood was cherished, and private life came a distant second. \nThe most famou=\r\ns incident involving the Shinsengumi was that at Ikedeya (1864). Realising =\r\nthat an anti-shogun group was plotting assassinations, the Shinsengumi atta=\r\ncked the inn where the group was staying and routed them. Outstanding in th=\r\nis was master swordsman, Okita Soji. Five years younger than Kondo and Hiji=\r\nkata, he was a handsome and dashing figure who had tuberculosis. Following =\r\nthis, the fame of the Shinsengumi spread, and recruits flocked to join them=\r\n. Though they fought valiantly, the shogunate collapsed around them and the=\r\ny were driven out of Kyoto. Yet they continued to fight, even after the sho=\r\ngun himself had given up. In the end, almost all were killed or took their =\r\nown lives\n\nijinmibu &lt;ijinmibu@...&gt; wrote:\nDoes anyone know alot about=\r\n them couse i want so if you could tell me \nwhat u know that would help tha=\r\nnk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-a=\r\nrchives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.co=\r\nm\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n=\r\nSPONSORED LINKS \nSamurai Japan Japan airline \n\n----------------------------=\r\n-----\nYAHOO!
