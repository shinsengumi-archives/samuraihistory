Now my question, I was hoping that \nsomebody might know the history of the Hakama, like who started it, \nwhat year and most importantly why that I mean why did the samurai \nchoose the hakama. I hope this question is not ment to be sent to a \nkendo forum. Also I can&#39;t find anything on the history of sojutsu. so \nany help on those two questions would be nice.thanks.-Martin Jr.\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS \n        Samurai   Japan   Japan airline \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
