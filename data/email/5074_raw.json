At least this is what\nSato quoted.\nTo call this=\r\n a &quot;Sword Category&quot; is anyway an overextension of the\n&quot;category&quot; therm. May=\r\n be &quot;Fashion&quot; fit better...\n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: Tom Helm [ma=\r\nilto:junkmail@...] \nInviato: venerd=EC 6 agosto 2004 15.14\nA: sam=\r\nuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] Revenge\n\n&gt;  Anoth=\r\ner poster also mentioned the Uesugi sword.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Aikuchi tanto notwithstandi=\r\nng (being tanto and not\n&gt;  katana, and therefore more of a knife rather tha=\r\nn a\n&gt;  sword, in which case the tsuba isn&#39;t nearly as\n&gt;  functional), I&#39;ll =\r\nchange my statement from &quot;Never&quot; to\n&gt;  &quot;it was so extremely rare that the w=\r\nealth of knowledge\n&gt;  on this board has been able to come up with ONE\n&gt;  ex=\r\nample.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  The point is not &quot;was there ever even ONE example of\n&gt;  this s=\r\nword&quot;, it is to inform the prospective author\n&gt;  that it&#39;s not bloody likel=\r\ny someone would be walking\n&gt;  around with a sword with no tsuba in the late=\r\n Sengoku.\n&gt;  Should she wish to still include it in her story,\n&gt;  well, it&#39;=\r\ns her story--more power to her. But the\n&gt;  answer to her question is no, pe=\r\nople didn&#39;t use these,\n&gt;  generally speaking, ever. One example doesn&#39;t dis=\r\nprove\n&gt;  that statement.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nResponding late to this;\n\tand the thread has =\r\ngone other places. Anyway, Nate et al, when I\n\nmentioned Uesugi it was with=\r\n the three well publicized koshirae which \nhave good provenance to Kenshin.=\r\n I said THESE are called \nUesugi-koshirae because it is a CATAGORY of sword=\r\n, I think you&#39;ll find \nthat when someone as famous as Kenshin adopts this s=\r\ntyle many others \ndid as well. This is not that rare a thing to see. I refe=\r\nr you all to \nUchi-gatana Koshirae, a catalog from a Tokyo National Museum =\r\nexhibition \ndrawn from their extensive holdings. There you will find a numb=\r\ner of \nexamples contemporary to the age of War. And as someone much more \nk=\r\nnowledgeable than I said on the same subject, &quot;There was no other \nreason t=\r\no own a sword in the Sengoku period but for fighting.&quot;\n\n-t\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai =\r\nArchives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://ww=\r\nw.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
