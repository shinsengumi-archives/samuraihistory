My next project for the Genealogy section of the Samurai \n&gt; Archives is the Oda genealogy, although as it stands I only have \nfrom \n&gt; Oda Nobuhide on down (his 10 children and thier decendants).  If \n&gt; you&#39;re interested in this info, let me know.\n\nHello - and thanks for the kind words about the website. It&#39;s very \namateurish but it&#39;s alot of fun for me to work on.\n\nI would indeed be very interested in seeing the info you have on \nNobuhide on down! For now I&#39;ve been focusing on the other direction. \nAs you know, on my site I&#39;ve got some narrative about the early \nhistory of the Oda family, up to about 1400. I am now gathering \ninformation on the 4-5 generations before Nobunaga (from about 1400 \nonwards).\n\nIt&#39;s interesting to see that Nobunaga&#39;s branch of the family was so \nminor that reliable (independant) records of his direct line are very \nsketchy until you get to Nobuhide. In fact it appears the one cannot \ngo much further back than Nobunaga&#39;s own great-grandfather, Sukenobu \n(Toshisada as the great-grandfather appears to be incorrect and may \nbe part of the false family history created by Nobunaga).\n\nJust out of curiousity have you put Nobunaga as the 2nd or third \nchild? Accounts do differ alot.\n\n\n\n\n"
