If  \nwe are talking about the Edo period hairstyles were strictly coded for  \nclass, rank and privaledge. Young men usually did not shave their heads  \nuntil they took the Gempuku, coming of age, even then some might have  \nworn a long forelock. Thus in film we see older &quot;boys&quot; chided for  \nwearing this childish haiirstyle even though they are men or nearly  \nmen. Also not uncommon for &quot;gay&quot; characters to wear the same style even  \nthough they are older.\n      An adult male attached to a lord would shave his forelock, a ronin or  \nnon-conformist, might not. The many different styles mentioned above  \nmeant that a persons class and status were instantly recognizable.  \nSamurai top-knots were set straight while farmers and merchants were  \nset to one side or the other, how the end was cut, the material used to  \ntie it and a dozen other things were proscribed by law.\n      Sasama tells us that the hair could either be worn loose or up, in a  \nknot when wearing Oyoroi. At the time Heian gentlemen worn eboshi, a  \nsoft hat. Because it was soft it would fold over and these were known  \nas hire-eboshi, a stiff lacquered version was worn with kabuto,  \nwrapping the hair it was pulled thru the tehen at the top of the helmet  \nbowl. Being associated with the Bushi class they became known as  \n&quot;Samurai Eboshi.&quot; Heian fashion, not unlike today was a very particular  \nworld with strict rules; a few loose hairs was tantamount to farting in  \nsomeones face, so any loose hairs were plucked.\n      There are several theories as to the rise of Chon-mage. One has it  \nthat shaving was more convenient than plucking for when wearing boshi  \nbut  the hairstyle remained even when the hat fell out of use. Another  \nsays the hat fell out of use because shaving the head became popular.  \nThere is the Nobunaga theory; he got fed up with plucking and said &quot;Oh  \njust shave it!&quot;, and the Jesuit theory; the style adopted by European  \nmonks became a nationwide fad (my favorite).The Mohawk theory; it was  \nconsidered so manly and fiercesome no warrior could do without it.   \nSome say that taking the time to dress the hair before battle in an age  \nof constant warfare was useless and wasteful, so shaved heads were the  \nnorm for warriors ( I think this one is the strongest argument).\n      It all seems to have come about in the Sengoku Jidai, though it  \nstarted earlier, thats why I like the last theory, no one seems to be  \nsaying it was specifically because of or for the wearing of helmets.\n\n-t\n\nPS many Sumo-tori were of Samurai class or recieved promotion to such  \nwhen very successful by the late Edo it was de rigeur...\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
