This was done in 1946 under the auspices of the Supreme\nCommander Allied Powers (SCAP) and was part of SCAP&#39;s Japanese\ndemilitarization efforts. Unfortunately, during the early stages of the\nprogram SCAP did not have a good understanding of Japanese swords and as a\nresult many heirloom swords and historically significant swords went into\nthe melting pot.\n \nAlso note, that not all Japanese swords were samurai swords. Many Japanese\n&quot;family&quot; swords were actually Imperial Japanese Army and Navy officer&#39;s\nswords. The majority of these officers were not descended from samurai\nfamilies.\n \nRobert\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of tamasaka@...\nSent: Sunday, January 24, 2010 1:10 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] how did samurai get their last name?\n\n\n  \n\nWow I appreciate this. Unfortunately, my parents has been doing genealogy\nfor the past 55 yrs. My mother side is a historical samurai family that\nserved under Tokugawa. The bad part is the family did not see or maybe they\ndid, but a family member forgot to pass on the history how the family became\nsamurai & who the original daimyo they served under. I know my mother as a\nchild remember seeing the family katana. This would have been helpful if her\nbrother still had it. The katana would have given us a name who made the\nsword which then could be traced back what period they became samurai. \n\nDuring WW II the Japanese government told everyone to surrender all samurai\nswords & other precious jewelry so the government could us it to purchase\nraw materials from other countries. Japan as u may know did not have a lot\nof raw materials to build there war machines. \n\nMy mother feels this is the reason they do not have the family katana. Her\nbrother only remembers a little history that was pasted down but do not\nrecall how they received the family name. \n\nSteve thank u for this information. If in the future if something in this\nline comes up could u plz send me an email. \n\nSincerely, \nShawn \nSent from my BlackBerryR smartphone with Nextel Direct Connect \n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Steven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@\n&lt;mailto:steven_matsheshu%40yahoo.com&gt; yahoo.com&gt; \nDate: Fri, 22 Jan 2010 08:45:00 \nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\nyahoogroups.com&gt; \nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] how did samurai get their last name? \n\nyea..most of these names go back too far for anyone to really remember why\nor how the name came into being.  The majority of the names, however, are\nbased on a certain geographic location...such as a town or lake...etc.etc. \n  \n  Dont forget that these days, many non-samurai descendants use popular\nsamurai names for last names.... so you need to know if that person&#39;s family\nis actually a historical samurai family...then ask them how their family got\nthe name. \n  \n     \n\n--- On Sun, 1/17/10, Mark Tovsen &lt;betonarchese@\n&lt;mailto:betonarchese%40yahoo.com&gt; yahoo.com&gt; wrote: \n\n\nFrom: Mark Tovsen &lt;betonarchese@ &lt;mailto:betonarchese%40yahoo.com&gt;\nyahoo.com&gt; \nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] how did samurai get their last name? \nTo: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\nyahoogroups.com \nDate: Sunday, January 17, 2010, 11:10 PM \n\n\n  \n\n\n\nMy wife&#39;s family name &quot;Maeda&quot; means in front of a rice field.
