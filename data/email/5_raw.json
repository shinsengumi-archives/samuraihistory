I know that the Takeda family continued through Takeda Kunitsugu 1551-1592. According to the information I have, he was nephew to Takeda Shingen. The problem I&#39;m having here is that None of Takeda Shingen&#39;s brothers had any children that lived, and as far as I can tell, none of them had any sons named Kunitsugu.\n    The best that I can figure is that Takeda Kunitsugu was from the female half of the line . . . the son of one of the married daughters. I don&#39;t know if that works correctly, though. He still bore the name Takeda, and in other societies, a woman married into another family took on the name of that family.\n    If you have the information I&#39;m looking for, please email me. I very much want to trace the line of the Takedas up to Takeda Kunitsugu, going through Takeda Sokichi and finally Takeda Sakaku and his son Takeda Tokemune.\n    I also would not mind it if you had some information on the Aizu clan. The house Saigo specifically. Takeda Sakaku, according to the facts I have, was sent to live with Saigo Tanomo during the wars.\n    Any info you have will be helpful. This is for a martial arts study of Daito ryu. I know that the art passed from Kunitsugu to Soemon, then passed to Sakaku through Saigo Tanomo who had learned it from Takeda Soemon.\n    Again, any info you have would be helpful.\n\nThanks,\nAlex Frazier\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
