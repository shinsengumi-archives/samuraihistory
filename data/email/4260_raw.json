These find their =\r\nprecedents in Japan among the court styles of the Heian-jidai, with earlier=\r\n examples unsurprisingly seen in T&#39;ang China. Many sources perpetuate the t=\r\nheory that the style was adopted, by both samurai and ashigaru to facilitat=\r\ne the wearing of a helmet, and give a greater cushion to the skull (a princ=\r\niple still seen sumo, in which the topknot is also to protect the heads dur=\r\ning falls). In the Edojidai, the topknot was common throughout society, wit=\r\nh the shaved front more than likely a fashion decision for the traditionall=\r\ny flambuoyant samurai.\nM.Lorimer  \n\nOyakata &lt;oyakata@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\nOn Fri, 16 Apr 2004 12:47:41 +0530, miles gilbert=A4=B5=A4=F3 wrote in me=\r\nssage &lt;MKNAKNIBIAPECBAA@...&gt;\n&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;I&#39;ve read a fair amount abo=\r\nut this topic, however most of the infomation \n&gt;seems to be inconsistent.\n\n=\r\nI am by no means an expert on this topic so hopefully you&#39;ll get \nmore know=\r\nelgeable replies. But for what it&#39;s worth:\n\n&gt;Who really wore topknots and w=\r\nhy? I understand the topknot was very important \n&gt;to the samurai class, but=\r\n why in various prints, paintings and historical \n&gt;depictions of the times =\r\npeasants are also showen with semi-shaven heads and \n&gt;topknots?\n\nIt might h=\r\nelp to define what era of Japanese history you&#39;re thinking \nof. In my recol=\r\nlection the top-knot (mage) is something that came \nabout in the Heian peri=\r\nod - about the 12th century and beyond. At \nthat time it seems that it was =\r\nexclusively a samurai-class \nhairstyle. But later - especially very late, s=\r\nuch as the Edo period - \nthe mage became fashionable among broader classes.=\r\n\n\n&gt;I&#39;ve read the reason samurai semi-shaved their heads was for an easier a=\r\nnd \n&gt;more comfortable fit when wearing a helmet. Fact or fiction? \n\nThis is=\r\n definitely the standard explanation. It is also commonly said \nthat the sh=\r\naving came from earlier (again around the Heian \nperiod) and was related to=\r\n the particular hats that were in \nfashion at the time. These were called e=\r\n-boushi and kanmuri. Here is \na good site that shows what they looked like:=\r\n\nhttp://kariginu.jp/kikata/2-2.htm\n\nBut for what it&#39;s worth, in my opinion =\r\nthis is probably just a (very \nwell accepted) urban myth or legend. The sha=\r\nving of the head strikes \nme as essentially fashion. Other cultures had hel=\r\nmets but not \nhead-shaving.\n\n&gt;Whilst all samurai seemed to have a topknot u=\r\nnless they were monks not all \n&gt;seemsd to shave the top part of their heads=\r\n, why?  \n\nAgain it&#39;s basically fashion. There are many different types of s=\r\ntyles \nthat were popular across a long range of years. Some of them have \ns=\r\nhaved heads, some do not. By the way the most commonly depicted style \nof s=\r\nhaved head and the one you are probably thinking of is called the \n&quot;sakayak=\r\ni&quot; style.\n\nHope this helps a little, in the absence of more expert answers.=\r\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.s=\r\namurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samura=\r\niarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
