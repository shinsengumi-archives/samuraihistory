Any way i was wondering if any one can help me wi=\r\nth sword names, was it a common pratice to name swords, i know that one of =\r\nmusashis opponenets ( i forget , very shameful of me i know) names his swor=\r\nd of length, dfrying pole or something like that. Any way im intrested in l=\r\nearning and knowing any swords named by famous samurai and how common the p=\r\nractice was,oh and this isnt a harsh forum as ive been helped many a time b=\r\ny the better educated among as thanks all ,\njames\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer9=\r\n8@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Squall Lionheart &lt;blue_moon_dragon1@...&gt;\nwro=\r\nte:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; well you know, its the subject of the message that\n&gt; hurts not th=\r\ne msg itself.\n\nBelieve it or not, this isn&#39;t the nicest of net\nneighborhood=\r\ns. I&#39;ve been accused of being the\nneighborhood bully once or twice. You&#39;ve =\r\ngot to be\ntough in this business--many people on this email list\nare seriou=\r\ns historians, published authors, people who\nread Japanese history in the or=\r\niginal Japanese--not\nthe anime Shibuya-speak, mind you, but good old\nfashio=\r\nned 12th century stuff. These people don&#39;t\nconsider gaming questions worthy=\r\n of their bandwidth.\nThere have been heated issues when gaming types come\no=\r\nn here and think they know everything about samurai\nsimply because they bea=\r\nt the 17th level of &quot;Samurai\nShowdown&quot; or &quot;Tenchu&quot; or they watched Rurouni =\r\nKenshin\n(&quot;Samurai X&quot;) 25 times. If you want to learn about\nsamurai, start a=\r\nt the website www.samuraiarchives.com\nand find the &quot;Top 10 misconceptions o=\r\nf the samurai&quot;.\nWhen people come here asking gaming or anime\nquestions, oft=\r\nen the assumption is that they are\ndeluded by one or two or all 10 of those=\r\n. Things can\nget painful. \n\nGrow a thick skin, and be willing to learn, and=\r\n this\nis a nice place. If that bothers you, then I dare you\nto say somethin=\r\ng like &quot;Anthony Bryant couldn&#39;t tell a\nsugake odoshi from a obon odori&quot; and=\r\n see what happens.\n\n\n*note to everyone on the board--why am I continuing to=\r\n\nfill your in box? Because if I answered his emails\nsingly instead of on th=\r\ne list, all the others who\nanswered/asked the question wouldn&#39;t get the ben=\r\nefit.\nSorry, and thanks for the patience.\n\nThe just-demoted assistant manag=\r\nement (guess I&#39;ll go\nclean out the bathrooms now...)\n\n\n            \n_______=\r\n___________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
