I am no expert, but I did do a little\n&gt; searchin on the net and found out this about oniwabanshu (can \nsomeone\n&gt; plz tell me what that means?)\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The Oniwabanshuu were a group of ninjas/onmitsus established by \nthe 8th\n&gt; Tokugawa shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune (1684-1751), who is considered \nto be\n&gt; one of Japan&#39;s greatest rulers. His far-reaching reforms totally\n&gt; reshaped the central administration structure and temporarily \nhalted the\n&gt; decline of the shogunate. He was originally the head of Kii, one of \nthe\n&gt; three hereditary Japanese feudal fiefs ruled by descendants of the\n&gt; original Tokugawa ruler not in the main line of succession to the\n&gt; Shogunate. (The other two fiefs/hans were Owari and Mito - \ntogether, the\n&gt; 3 hans were known as the 3 Houses, or Sanke.) A lack of sons in the \nmain\n&gt; branch of the family, though, resulted in Yoshimune&#39;s succession to \nthe\n&gt; position of Shogun in 1716. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yoshimune established the Oniwabanshuu for security, information\n&gt; gathering and spying activities. Originally, members of the \nOniwabanshuu\n&gt; were chosen from the Kii clan, and was passed down in the families -\n in\n&gt; other words, the posts of the Oniwabanshuu were hereditary. They \nacted\n&gt; as security guards in the Edo castle, besides spying on other clans \nof\n&gt; their policies and actions. It was also believed that in Bakumatsu\n&gt; times, Oniwabanshuu members were placed among the missions sent to\n&gt; America.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no knowledge in this area so I cannot verify nor deni its\n&gt; authentisity.\n&gt; This is the link were i found the info.\n&gt; http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/5770/history.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; /// Chris \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;God&#39;s in his heaven.

There has probablu \n&gt; &gt; been something in the general function of the oniwabanshu in \n&gt; &gt; Kyoto. As said in an other mail on sthe subject of &quot;ninjas&quot; \n&gt; &gt; and Shinobu. They have with out a doubt existed. We just dont \n&gt; &gt; know very much about them, and their activites. But then \n&gt; &gt; again, they were sceret spies and guerillas so it would have \n&gt; &gt; been counterproductive to be known.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As a modern paralell, There are 120 suspected spy academies \n&gt; &gt; around the world. But only two publicly known. CIA&#39;s The Farm \n&gt; &gt; outside Washinton DC and i think the other one is in UK or \n&gt; &gt; Russia. Not sure there. Do we know what and who are training \n&gt; &gt; there? Nope. Not a clue. Why? sore wa himitsu des!
