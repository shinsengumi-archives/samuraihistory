I was wondering if you guys could help me fi=\r\nnd a \n&gt; certain samurai? I remember reading aout him but cannot remember hi=\r\ns \n&gt; name. From what I remember he was 13 when he first became a samurai \n&gt;=\r\n and he had a form of yoshi in his name somewhere. If you could ell me \n&gt; h=\r\nis name or even give me some information on him I would appreciate it \n&gt; ve=\r\nry much! Also I would like some really good information on the \n&gt; Minomoto =\r\nfamilly evolving around Yoshitsune Minomoto,as well as \n&gt; something about T=\r\naira no Shigemori and temoe Gozen. Thank you!\n&gt;\n\n\nThe first question, well,=\r\n without more info, you&#39;ve just described\nprobably between 5-15% of every s=\r\namurai ever born. For the rest, take\na look at www.samurai-archives.com\n\n\n"
