While the enemy is dealing with\n&gt; the snake entangled around his body by the rope, the\n&gt; shinobi comes in close to deal an awful death with\n&gt; his kama. though there are set backs to this weapon\n&gt; it&#39;s a one shot sort of thing. So Tom will have to\n&gt; have a whole bag of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:         \n&gt;                         \n&gt;  --- nohit@... wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks,  Nate for doing what I had no patience to\n&gt;  &gt; do.
