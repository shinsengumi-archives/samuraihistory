So I can relate very\n  well with the death poems of the samurai. I believe just like them that\n  a good death is a glorious death when your will is fully surrendered and\n  submitted to the One who gave His son to die for all. Dying is not an end \n  at all but a beginning. But this might be scary for some westerners (I&#39;m\n  from the east so that might explain something) so that&#39;s okay. Sorry, to bring\n  the subject up here. But that&#39;s what amazes me most with the Samurai.\n  I should read the Bushido next. I do admire them for their bravery and art\n  and nobility. And christians could learn so much from them. I look at\n  the cherry blossoms and I am humbled...\n\n  carmen \n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Nate Ledbetter [mailto:ltdomer98@...]\n  Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2004 1:48 PM\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Hi!\n\n\n  Maybe it&#39;s just that I&#39;m Episcopalian, but I never saw\n  &quot;glory in death&quot; as a particularly CHRISTIAN value,\n  except in cases of martyrdom.\n\n  Nate\n\n  --- Thom Jason &lt;cabbit10@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Not to start a religious flamewar Carmen, but those\n  &gt; ideals existed a long\n  &gt; time before the bible was written down.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; -Thom\n  &gt; \n  &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt; From: &quot;Carmen Campo&quot; &lt;carmen_campo@...&gt;\n  &gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt; Sent: Monday, January 26, 2004 10:44 PM\n  &gt; Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] Hi!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new here and dont know a thing abt bushido\n  &gt; (way of the warrior).
