It would be best to put your trust in \nyour teacher, follow his advice as to what suits your body style and \nthe style of swordsmanship you intend to practice.\n\tStay away from swords with plastic handles, anything made in \nSpain or with a &quot;chromed&quot; hamon. I like the folks at Meirin Sangyo, \nthey are a bit cheaper but basically have the same things available \nall over Japan.Bob Elder at East Coast Martial Arts is another good \nguy, I recommend you contact him first. Noshu-Iaido and Bugei are a \nbit pricey but have a selection to choose from. I have seen Gunto and \nShowa-to converted to use as Iaito with good results but would \nstrongly urge against using anything older for martial arts practice.\n\tThe San Francisco Sword show is coming up and can&#39;t say \nenough good things about it. Many of the dealers have swords \noutfitted for iai and or fixer uppers ready for use. It is THE best \nplace to nail a bargain. Hope to see some of you all there...\nTom\n\n"
