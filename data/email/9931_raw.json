Anybody posting clearly h=\r\nas an internet connection and it is a valuable and often first-step in the =\r\nresearch process. A step that would have answered the question itself.Now, =\r\nin spite of that rant, my intention was never actually to insult mc curio, =\r\nbut rather my initial response to AJ&#39;s answer because I initially spaced ou=\r\nt what curio could possibly be referring to and AJ made me laugh.\nWasn&#39;t aw=\r\nare I (nor anyone else for that matter) was expected to censor my response =\r\nfor fear of hurting someone&#39;s feelings (don&#39;t worry, you didn&#39;t hurt mine, =\r\nI&#39;m just explaining my intentions), and if I did I formally apologize to cu=\r\nrio, though that bad karma is likely countered by the silly feelings possib=\r\nly transferred to AJ and a few others.And I actually mainly became interest=\r\ned in the material via much more erudite relatives of the media you mention=\r\ned. Specifically: anime and comics (in the opposite order).
