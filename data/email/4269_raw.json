Again it was:\n\n  &quot;While this is quite vague it could very well be the origins of the \n  mage hairstyle amoung the ruling classes. Tenmu ruled in the late 7th \n  century.&quot;\n\n  But the exchange was also talking about _why_, or rather why not, the \n  mage may have come about.  And I see that in a separate message you \n  do agree with my point (made above) that the mage is not a hairstyle \n  that came about for some benefit in combat.\n\n  It&#39;s nice to know I was essentially correct on both points!\n\n  --\n  Jay Kelly\n  oyakata@...\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
