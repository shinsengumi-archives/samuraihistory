So started asking questions from some of my older relatives, turns out they had a lot of old journals and documents from as far back as the mid 1800s, even found out my family has a coat of arms, now I am hooked on Russian history as well as Japanese. I would recomend anyone to reserch their roots.\n\nDave\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: zevlord \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, November 07, 2004 3:46 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Your own culture\n\n\n\n  Hi everyone,\n  Was just wondering if there are may people that are in the same \n  situation as myself. See I&#39;m an ABC (Australian Born Chinese). Thing \n  is, I know more about Japanese history then I do my own. I know very \n  little about Chinese history and what I do know about Australian \n  history is what I have learnt from school. To me Australian history \n  is very hmm how would you say? &quot;Mind-numbing&quot;, we only have around \n  two hundred years of history so it isn&#39;t as impressive as other \n  cultures. I do have an interest in Chinese history, however is not a \n  priority for me at the moment. One day, sometime in the near future I \n  do plan on correcting this. So I guess what I&#39;m asking is, are there \n  others that know more about a specific culture then they do their own.\n\n  Zev\n\n\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
