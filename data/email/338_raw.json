This scene is retold and replayed in novels\nand movies by various characters. The message itself was plaintext if I\nrecall.\n    The Takeda used smoke signals to move info across large distances in a\nhurry, surely they had codes for this. The info you seek may not be in ONE\nbook but in books on specific han Lords and or battles.\n    pray for surf,\nTom\n\nslowest reply in the west....\n\n\n"
