As a professional historian, Prof Varle=\r\ny explains how various sections of the 40-book text are reliable or less so=\r\n. He relates how Nan-Taiheiki by Imagawa Ryoshun challenged the authority o=\r\nf the Taiheiki&#39;s stance, in that it took an anti-Ashikaga view, and due to =\r\nthat end, its author or authors invented parts of the tale. There are sever=\r\nal versions of the Taiheiki text. One factual difference Varley states is n=\r\numbers of troops quoted as present in battles. The book is on Amazon and av=\r\nailable through Powells.\n\n\n"
