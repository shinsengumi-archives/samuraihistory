Every source I&#39;ve read (including \nthe Japanese ones) echoes this-the Shogunate at the time simply did \nnot have the money to follow through. When I&#39;ve talked to the people \nwho staff Ginkakuji they also state this (but they likely would even \nif it wasn&#39;t true...makes for a better sounding history!).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
