I\ncould &quot;serve&quot; someone, and still not be a sam=\r\nurai if I\nwasn&#39;t a. born into it or b. in rare cases, promoted\ninto it (i.e=\r\n. the bakufu basically gives a declaration\nthat such and such person is now=\r\n a member of the\nsamurai class, and as such has all responsibilities\nand du=\r\nties associated, and so and so&#39;s descendants\nshall be samurai, etc.). \n\nNat=\r\ne\n\n--- Michael Lorimer wrote:\n&gt; Quite so. \n&gt; The term &#39;samurai&#39; does not re=\r\ngard simply to those\n&gt; men (and some women) who trained with, and deployed\n=\r\n&gt; their swords. The word comes from the kanji meaning\n&gt; literally &#39;to serve=\r\n&#39;, whether it was the Emperor, a\n&gt; daimyo, or even one of the equally might=\r\ny temples. \n&gt; However, upon this point of &#39;to serve&#39;, would you\n&gt; classify =\r\nthe likes of the Miyamoto Musashi as a\n&gt; &#39;samurai&#39; since his carrer with th=\r\ne sword was one\n&gt; essentially without a master?? \n&gt; M.Lorimer\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate Led=\r\nbetter wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Mark Arsenault wrote:\n&gt; Specifically, the term &quot;samu=\r\nrai&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; not synonymous with \n&gt; &gt; &quot;swordsman&quot; or &quot;one who tries to adher=\r\ne to\n&gt; Bushido&quot;\n&gt; &gt; or anything similar. \n&gt; &gt; Samurai were a caste, and one=\r\n that no longer\n&gt; exists.\n&gt; &gt; So in the strict \n&gt; &gt; definition of the term,=\r\n one cannot &quot;become&quot; a\n&gt; &gt; samurai any more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Point of fact, if you tol=\r\nd you&#39;re average Japanese\n&gt; person you were a &quot;samurai&quot;, you&#39;d have them\n&gt; =\r\nlaughing\n&gt; until next week.
