I wondered if anyone knows the \n&gt; difference between the Japanese and European versions, besides the \n&gt; language. I have found this website. It is excellent \n&gt; http://shogun23.hypermart.net/index2.htm please click on the 2nd \n&gt; kanji from left then find the units and building pages, is it me or \n&gt; are the units different. There is a unit called the father visitor, \n&gt; bizarre. I wonder if It realtes to a Jesuit father? historically \n&gt; accurate. Plus there are 5 types of castles etc. I am confused \n&gt; greatly. If anyone knows can you message back. I wanted to post this \n&gt; question on the totalwar.org board but I cant get it work, also if \n&gt; anyone knows about this? Last thing I will say I really enjoy total \n&gt; war it is an excellent game, it has I am sure done a great service to \n&gt; Japanese history interest. It is reasonably historically accurate, \n&gt; Stephen Turnbull helped on it, it is one thing I would compliment him \n&gt; for. Now the Medieval version is out on the 30th in the UK I can&#39;t \n&gt; wait. But even though it supposedly rocks, I would have preferred \n&gt; more on the sengoku Jidai, perhaps, all throughout Japans history. We \n&gt; should not forget shogun, now it&#39;s European cousin is around, Me for \n&gt; one will be loyal, well until the 30th anyroad! ohh well I can dream, \n&gt; it will happen one day we all know. Ok then, my next post will be \n&gt; more historical, perhaps, possibly on Japanese mercaneries in India? \n&gt; hmmmm, \n&gt; \n&gt; All the best then Mark\n\n\n"
