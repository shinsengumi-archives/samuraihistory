I didn&#39;t realize the Japanese calendar was that \nmuch =\r\ndifferent than the Gregorian calendar.   This is a really neat \nforum by th=\r\ne way. \n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\nlistown=\r\ner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ke_al_ze&quot; &lt;ke_al=\r\n_ze@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was surfing the web looking for inf=\r\no on Mikatagahara and it \nleft me \n&gt; &gt; unclear on the year it was fought. A=\r\nbout 50% of the sites I \nlooked at \n&gt; &gt; said it was 1572 and the other half=\r\n said 1573. Does anyone know \nwhy \n&gt; &gt; this is and what year the battle was=\r\n actually fought?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ...in fact, when we first start=\r\ned the Samurai Archives, we didn&#39;t \n&gt; discriminate between the two, so a lo=\r\nt of it is mixed between \nJapanese \n&gt; and western dates.  This intro to the=\r\n biographical dictionary \n(which \n&gt; used mostly contemporary Japanese dates=\r\n) helps to explain:\n&gt; \n&gt; DATES \n&gt; Most dates are given in their western equ=\r\nivalents for the sake of \n&gt; clarity for western readers. However, when date=\r\ns are listed by \ntheir \n&gt; contemporary reckoning, they are given as follows=\r\n: era name and \nthe \n&gt; year of that era, followed by the month and day, thu=\r\ns, Eiroku-3 \n6/1 \n&gt; would be the 1st day of the 6th month of the 3rd year o=\r\nf Eiroku. \nEiroku-\n&gt; 3 6 would indicate the 6th month of the 3rd year of Ei=\r\nroku. Where \na \n&gt; month alone is indicated, e.g., the 10th month, that, too=\r\n, is to \nbe \n&gt; considered by the contemporary reckoning (and not, in this c=\r\nase, \n&gt; October by the Gregorian calendar.) There really isn=81ft any simpl=\r\ne \nway \n&gt; to convert these dates into their Gregorian equivalents, although=\r\n \na \n&gt; very rough rule of thumb is to add between 20 and 30 days. For \n&gt; in=\r\nstance, Takeda Shingen, by contemporary Japanese reckoning, died \non \n&gt; the=\r\n 12th day of the 4th month of the 4th year of Genki. By our \n&gt; reckoning, h=\r\ne died on 13 May 1573. However, note that his rival \nOda \n&gt; Nobunaga was ki=\r\nlled on the 2nd day of the 6th month of the 10th \nyear of \n&gt; Tensho, or, 21=\r\n June 1582. That=81fs may give one a sense for the \n&gt; complexities of date =\r\nconversion.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
