Turn\n&gt; east (left if you are going south) and go to\n&gt; Aburanokoji-dori (two blocks or so). This is the\n&gt; northwest corner of the Honno-ji site. It is a four\n&gt; block area bounded by Rokkaku-dori on the north,\n&gt; Nishikinokoji-dori on the south, Aburanokoji-dori on\n&gt; the west, and Nishinotoin-dori on the east. The\n&gt; building with the marker is located on a corner and\n&gt; has a brick first story with a metal upper portion.\n\n\nShould have known to ask you to ask Ayame, Randy.
