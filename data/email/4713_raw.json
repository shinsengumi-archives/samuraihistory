Swords are classified into categories by the =\r\nlength of \nits blade if i&#39;m correct, for example a katana is a katana due t=\r\no its \nblade being over two SHAKU. But what about the style and shape of th=\r\ne \nblade, can a Katana be a Torii Sori style with a Unokubi =96 zukuri \nsha=\r\npe.  Also could you help my with this: \n&quot;Koa Isshin Mantetsu with Buke Zuku=\r\nri Koshirae&quot; \nI think the Buke Zukuri Koshirae is some sort of mounting sty=\r\nle. And \nI guess the Koa Isshin Mantetsu is the shape of the blade maybe? A=\r\nny \nhelp would be great.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-arch=\r\nives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n-=\r\n-- \n\n\nYahoo!
