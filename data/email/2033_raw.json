There\n\nwere honourable samurais and dishonorable samurais,  but only buke or\n\nadopted .\n\n\nTo think that honour was the main condition to be a samurai is like to think\n\nthat in middle age or arthurian europe, knights had to be brave and respect\n\na code of chivalry... knights (especially errants) were just like samurai :\n\nsometimes honourable, sometimes looter, sometimes robbers, sometimes raper\n\nbut  tight as a &quot;class&quot; by some kind of image of the brave &quot;courtois&quot; (sorry\n\ni don&#39;t know how to translate this from french, it is related to love code\n\nof chivalry) knight.\n\n &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
