I was thinking: since a\nfew of this list are in Japan, wouldn&#39;t be nice to get together for\nsome serious historical sightseeing, to be completed with an historical\nfood+booze session at an izakaya in the old capital?? If there are a\nfew of us (and we&#39;re willing to invest a little) I can try to get a\ncouple of my maiko friends to come around for a reasonable price - no\nkidding!!! :oO\nI know some of you are in Kanto, but....c&#39;mon... I am flying 7 hours\nfrom Honolulu; can&#39;t you hop on a shinkansen??\ncepo&gt;&gt;\n\nMarch 19 to the 26 you say. I have some days off from my school on 20-21 and\n25-31. However its a busy season with the new school year starting in April.\nThe best time for me might be Sunday the 21st. Getting to Kyoto is no\nproblem; its only a 30 minute train ride.\n\nWilliam\n\n\n"
