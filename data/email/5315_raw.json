Though greatly outnumbered it must be remembered that these figures are only the number of samurai meeting the Mongols in northern Kyushu at Hakata bay and not the whole Japanese force. The samurai had better weapons and armour as well as the determination of a people defending their homeland, ( the Mongol army had a large percentage of Chinese and Korean conscripts). Where the samurai lacked was in tactics, but by the second invasion they were fighting much smarter, adapting their tactics to this new enemy.\n\njust my two cents\nDave\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: zevlord \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, August 17, 2004 7:11 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Mongols v Japanese\n\n\n  The Mongols have had really bad luck when trying to invade Japan a \n  thunderstorm harassed north Kyushu island in 1274 when the Yuan army \n  was fighting (first invasion attempt), and again in 1281 a typhoon \n  hit north Kyushu island while the Yuan soldiers were on board their \n  ships preparing for a major landing operation (second attempt). In \n  both instances the Yuan armies suffered severe casualties from these \n  natural calamities and the invasions were aborted. In my opinion if \n  not for the &quot;divine winds&quot; the Mongols would of have a good chance of \n  winning. \n  Just to give you some figures:\n\n  First Invasion:\n  Yuan army: 40,000; with 900 ships \n  Japanese army: 10,000\n\n  Second Invasion:\n  Yuan army: 140,000; with 4,400 ships \n  Japanese army: 40,000 \n\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
