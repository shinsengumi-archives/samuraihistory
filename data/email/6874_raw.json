What point did he want\n&gt; to get across?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nahless\n\nAs Kitsuno said, the generally accepted theory is that\nit was Hirate&#39;s last effort (literally) to get\nNobunaga to abandon his wayward ways. Hirate had been\nlike a surrogate father to Nobunaga while Nobunaga was\ngrowing up, being in charge of his education, and\nwhile you could interpret it as an admission of\nfailure and attempt to attone for the bad management\nof his ward, I think it was less that and more an\nattempt at a wake-up call for Nobunaga. The incident\nKitsuno mentions about the horse belonging to Hirate&#39;s\nson is mentioned in Yoshikawa Eiji&#39;s novel &quot;Taiko&quot;.\nEssentially, Masahide&#39;s son (can&#39;t remember the name\nat the moment) had procured a fine white horse, and\nNobunaga rather selfishly ordered Hirate to give him\nthe horse, as the master should have finer things than\nthe retainer. The novel recounts that Masahide&#39;s son\nchafed at having to give up his horse, but Masahide\ninstructed him to do so, because his lord had so\nordered. That night Masahide committed seppuku--the\nhorse incident being just the final straw. The seppuku\nwas a final remonstration from an obedient servant\nwho&#39;d simply seen his lord go too far. \n\nNow, that&#39;s the novel version--reality, I&#39;m not quite\nsure. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard about the horse\nincident anywhere else. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
