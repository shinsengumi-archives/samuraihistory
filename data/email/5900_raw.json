I haven&#39;t done much building myself, my eyesight =\r\nis\nreally bad but I did lead a project to make an armour, for one of my\nfri=\r\nends. As I said in my reply, I was taking the opportunity to get some\nof th=\r\ne data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a few of the\npictures of ou=\r\nr &quot;work in progress&quot; posted to my web site, with a short\nexplanation. When =\r\nI do I&#39;ll post the news here.\n\nMeanwhile, to give you an idea of what you c=\r\nould be letting yourself in\nfor: I started researching back in 1986, starte=\r\nd seriously sorting out\nthe building in 1994 and we still haven&#39;t finished =\r\nthe dam thing yet! In\nthe end we more or less gave up, until last year, whe=\r\nn we got our butts\noff the deck and knuckled down to doing some more resear=\r\nch and work\n(that awful little four letter word). All the parts we had half=\r\n done\nwere finished, and we started to look around for a decent smith who\nc=\r\nould make the other parts for us instead, otherwise Andrew, the friend\nin q=\r\nuestion will be long in his grave by the time we actually finish it! \n\nFor =\r\nmyself, earlier this year I gave in and bought a Japanese festival\narmour a=\r\ns a sort of stop-gap, I was sick of the great theoretical\narmour, I wanted =\r\nthe real thing, well I got it, er.. sort of. The\nreplica in question is way=\r\n under weight and needs a lot of work, just to\nmake it serviceable, but a w=\r\nhole lot less than starting from scratch.\nBut I do intend to replace it wit=\r\nh something much better.\n\nThe problem was we started with the idea of doing=\r\n it as right as\npossible, but of necessity we had to make compromises as we=\r\n went along,\nwhich no doubt you will probably have to do as well. For examp=\r\nle we\ndidn&#39;t use urushi (Japanese lacquer), due to its cost and toxicity. A=\r\nnd\nwhen we did the kote (armoured sleeve), kohire (&quot;little-fin&quot; brigendine\n=\r\nshoulder guards) and the tate-eri (&quot;shield-collar&quot;) we had to use\nAmerican =\r\ndoe skin as we couldn&#39;t get the right thing from Japan. Now, we\ncan and the=\r\n guys who did the sewing are cursing a lot as they know that\nI&#39;m going to &quot;=\r\npersuade&quot; them to replace it. The dou (body armour) we had\nmade is in russe=\r\nt 2mm steel and does look amazing, but it doesn&#39;t have\nany gessan yet, but =\r\nI hope to have that sorted out sometime soon, as\nMichael who answered your =\r\nfirst email does make armour in his spare time\n(spare time? a misnomer I th=\r\nink, would you not agree Michael?).\n\nAnyway I wish you the best of luck, I&#39;=\r\nm sorry I can&#39;t currently be of\nmore help, but as soon as I&#39;ve got the stuf=\r\nf up on the net I&#39;ll let you\nknow.\n\nAll the best\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\n\n\nIn mes=\r\nsage &lt;20041109030428.71697.qmail@...&gt;, mark kd\n&lt;depos42=\r\n300@...&gt; writes\n&gt;    hi,\n&gt;    =A0 Thank you very much for this info. =\r\nI&#39;m gonna try it out asap. Do \n&gt;    you know how to make a full suit of sam=\r\nurai armor? if so, do you \n&gt;    have any pics? Anything to help me would be=\r\n great. Also, in your \n&gt;    step 9 below, you said that you would need lots=\r\n of pics to show me \n&gt;    how to put it all together. Well, i was thinking =\r\nthat the next time \n&gt;    you made samurai armor, you could catalog the proc=\r\ness for \n&gt;    me.(detailed pics and notes). I&#39;m not asking you to do it for=\r\n me \n&gt;    for free if that&#39;s what your thinking. I&#39;ll gladly $pay$ you for =\r\n\n&gt;    your time.(for the pics & notes). I know it might be asking a bit \n&gt; =\r\n   much but if your interested please let me know. I really want to \n&gt;    m=\r\nake samurai armor but i&#39;m affraid of screwing it all up cause i \n&gt;    don&#39;t=\r\n have a lot of info on how to make it. All i got is a lot of \n&gt;    pics of =\r\nfull-scale size armor and not a lot of detailed pics on how \n&gt;    it all go=\r\nes together. Well, like i said if your interested let me \n&gt;    know,....ple=\r\nase be interested. Thanks again,\n&gt;    =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 \n&gt;    Mark\nDean Wayland\nHead =\r\nOf The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
