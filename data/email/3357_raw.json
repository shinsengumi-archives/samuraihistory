Seems to me a ripe opportunity to illustrate how the \nhistoriographic process works (over time) and the necessity of reading \none&#39;s sources critically.  Might be nice to (capitalizing on what many \nstudents bring to introductory classes in the way of baggage) 1) assign \nthis topic, 2) have them read some excerpts from _Bushido_ by Nitobe, and \nthen 3) read G. Cameron (Cappy) Hurst&#39;s article on Bushido, Loyalty, etc.\n\nMy point being that it is not necessarily a bad topic if approached \nproperly.\n\n-Shannon\n\nTom Helm wrote:\n\nAll-\n\tWe have to locate the teacher who is giving this assignment and shut\nhim down...\n-t\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\u001b$BM&#39;C#$H\u001b(B24\u001b$B;~4V%[%C%H%i%$%s!V\u001b(BMSN \u001b$B%a%C%;%s%8%c!&lt;!W!&quot;:#$9$0%@%&%s%m!&lt;%I!*\u001b(B  \nhttp://messenger.msn.co.jp \n\n\n"
