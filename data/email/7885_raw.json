Can you are do you have some historic examples of Samrai do these \nacts  with ot seeking permission first.  I would be very interested in hearing \nthem.   I am thinking that there would be others new to this; who wold also \nlike to hear.  So looking forward to another great post...  although this one \nwas interesting;  hmm it raises questions.
