I would want to know a few things before bidding \nthough; How many pages does this book contain? How many illustrations \nare there? Are we seeing the only ones? Do you read Japanese? If this \nis written in &quot;cryptic&quot; language do you have the resources to translate \nit? Do you even care what it says? What is the title of the book? Who \npublished it? Is this info unavailable in more modern texts? If you are \na book collector then alot of this won&#39;t matter; you only need to \ncompare it to similar things on offer down in Kanda and you&#39;ve already \nsaid something like this has never come up...\n-t\n\n\n"
