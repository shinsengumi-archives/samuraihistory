This is a \nmythic sort of character, which wa=\r\ns blended with the &quot;high concept&quot; \nof professionals helping the helpless.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong. I really liked THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. I saw \nit=\r\n as a teenager (which was a long, long, LONG time ago  :)\nBut the idea of a=\r\n &quot;cowboy with a conscience&quot; who has a clear sense\nof &quot;right and wrong&quot; isn&#39;=\r\nt at all like a 17th century Japanese \nronin. The cowboys with a conscience=\r\n and a clear sense of right and \nwrong weren&#39;t thrust into their roles as h=\r\nired gunfighters. They \nwere American, with the unique American culture of =\r\nhaving freely \nchosen this path. \n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ll also notice the culture diffe=\r\nrence where in Magnificent \nSeven,\n&gt; the protagonists stand at the gates of=\r\n the town and confront the\n&gt; bandits, whereas in Seven Samurai the Samurai =\r\nhide out and ambush\n&gt; them, never once confronting them before the battle.\n=\r\n&gt;\n  I agree with you.  Sorry that what I wrote didn&#39;t make that \nclear.  Ho=\r\nllywood cowboys are famously &quot;free agents&quot; who decide &quot;a \nman&#39;s got&#39;ta do w=\r\nhat a man&#39;s got&#39;ta do&quot; after some outrage committed \nby the bad guy of the =\r\npiece.  To say they are anything like samauria \nas a culture or a class of =\r\nwarriors is just a sloppy \nwestern &quot;shorthand&quot;.  Sorry I didn&#39;t make that c=\r\nlearer.\n\nKJJ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
