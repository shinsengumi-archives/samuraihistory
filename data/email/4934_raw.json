The samurai rose to \npredominance during the late Heian and the Kamakura periods. It was the \nGempei war between two great provincial clans (the Taira and the Minamoto) \nwhich resulted in the establishment of an hereditary Shogunate, and defined \nthe medieval era. In the war, women participated in political, economic and \nnot least, military roles. Standing beside many of the great men was an \nequally great woman, but their stories are often documented unreliably (if \nat all), and rarely filter through to English language sources. What was \nwomen�s role in establishing the supremacy of the Samurai and how did their \nposition change? Discussed with particular emphasis on the martial sphere.\n\nJapan is often thought of as a strong patriarchy with a tradition of \noppression of women. Even today there are many areas of unresolved \ndiscrimination against women. Japanese history centers on the deeds of \nheroic warriors, and the Samurai is perhaps the most widely recognized \nsymbol of Japan internationally. Women, however, were not necessarily always \nkept indoors practicing flower arranging. Alongside some of the most \nlegendary warriors fought women. Before the entrenching of the Shogunate and \nSamurai dominated feudalism, women were soldiers, generals, strategists, \njudges, Empresses and even Regent Shogun. Women contributed significantly to \nestablishing the social structure which would come to repress them.\n\nThere was a significant change in the role of Japanese women over the Heian, \nKamakura and Muromachi eras as society moved from a matriarchal influence to \na patriarchal structure. Representative of this change was the social \nupheaval around the Gempei war of the late twelfth century, and that period \nis the focus of this paper. Were the women warriors of the period acting \naccording to ancient matriarchal principles in an attempt to maintain old \ntraditions in a period of chaotic change? Were they trying to enter a male \nworld upon the collapse of the old order with its certainties and clearly \ndefined roles? Or were they fighting because in an all out war every hand is \nneeded? What reasons may there be for these women either to be largely \nignored in standard historical accounts or for their histories to be turned \ninto myth? In seeking answers to these questions there will be an overview \nof conditions extant in the period under consideration and the lives and \nactivities of a range of female protagonists who were active players during \nthe period will be examined.\n\nBefore discussing these women&#39;s lives, the deeds for which they are \nremembered and the background of the wars in which they fought, there is a \nwider historical context which must be addressed: the status of women. The \ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries were turbulent times of great changes in \nJapan, seeing the rise of the Samurai, Shogunate and warrior ethics and the \ndiminishment of the leisurely court life devoted to the arts for which the \nHeian period is best known.  Not surprisingly, this was also an era of \nsignificant change for women.  The status of women decreased rapidly through \nthis era into the oppression of the Sengoku and Edo (or Tokugawa) periods.  \nIt is the laws of those later years which people generally seem to associate \nwith Japan, projecting women�s status from those eras back to earlier times. \nIn fact, in the opening centuries of the CE the regions which then composed \nJapan were under matriarchal rule (although possibly much earlier also, this \nis the date from which Chinese written records provide primary evidence) . \nThis tradition was so strong that when a man inherited rule a bloody civil \nwar broke out, appeased only when a woman assumed the throne .  Skipping \n1400 years, by the age of Sengoku Turnbull writes that there was no \nequivalent to Tomoe, nor �any woman remotely approaching the status of \nMasako� .  In contrast, Sengoku women were treated as objects, useful only \nfor seiryaku kekkon, political alliance marriages .  He goes on to give \noften graphic examples of the negative treatment of Sengoku women.  The \nperiod with which we are concerned is set between these extremes. Although \nactive in many areas, women were moving increasingly to the periphery of \nsociety.\n\nWith the rise of the Samurai and Bushido warrior ideology, women�s status \ndeclined, and the intellectual women�s networks disappeared . However useful \nwomen may have been on the battlefield they were still inferior. Although \nTomoe was among his last seven defenders, when the time came for him to die, \na man asks her �how would Yoshinaka be shamed if in his last fight he died \nwith a woman?� and sends her away . However, as Bingham and Gross point out, \n�In a curious way�bushido created a parallel ideal for Japanese women of the \nSamurai class� .  It is no coincidence that the legendary women of this \nperiod were themselves warriors or military strategists. War was \nall-important.\n\nIn the lower classes gender was a less significant issue. Women worked \nalongside men, inherited property and had property rights in divorces, which \nwere easily obtained .  After the mid-seventh century Confucian style Taika \nreforms, �women were barred from becoming government officials, and a \nwomen�s share of government-distributed land (kubunden) was set at \ntwo-thirds of that for a man� . Despite this women in rural areas were \nsomewhat better off; if necessary they could hold the office of steward, \nwhich in some areas was the highest local authority, and entailed tax \ncollecting, providing military services, and carrying out all law and also \ninfrastructure .\n\nMarriage had traditionally centered on women, with the husband joining her \nfamily and daughters inheriting and having income rights . Although this \nsystem continued in the lower classes until the nineteenth century, the \nSamurai (increasingly and eventually exclusively) adopted the ie, an \nexclusively patrilineal, primogenitural and hierarchical family structure .\n\nAlthough �Japanese women have traditionally had an unusually prominent role \nin dealing with the supernatural� , Japan: An illustrated Encyclopedia \nattributes the decline in women�s status to Confucianism, Buddhism and the \neconomic changes brought about by protracted warfare, which cause \nprimogeniture to be safer . How did the different religions affect women�s \nstatus?\nReligious beliefs may be assumed to have a significant influence over social \nmorality and values, including gender relations.  In the �native� religion \nof Shintoism the first-born god is in fact a goddess, Amateratsu.  As the \neldest she inherited the earth and sent her grandson to rule Japan, giving \nhim the three items of the Imperial Regalia .  Thus members of the Japanese \nImperial Family are her descendants, and she is Japan�s principal deity.  \nThe best evidence for a positive Shinto attitude towards gender equality was \nthe existence of �female shamans who acted as powerful religious and \npolitical leaders� .  The negative side however is the strong focus on \npollution, which excludes women from certain places and ceremonies because \nof their �unclean� reproductive processes .\n\nIn the early sixth century CE Buddhism was brought to Japan from Korea , and \nbecame a major religion.  Because of the many different sects and \ninterpretations, Buddhism presented a more mixed view of women.  On the one \nhand, Buddhist convents provided a refuge for women whose status had been \nremoved or who were seeking divorce; an outlet for charitable works, \nlearning, and leadership roles, and women even founded temples . On the \nother hand, although some sects preached equality others focused again on \npollution or on female specific sins, elements which prevented female \nenlightenment until they were reborn as men .\n\nAlthough Confucianism arrived in Japan from China at around the same time as \nBuddhism, it did not become a dominant philosophy until much later , its \nrise accompanying that of the Samurai.  According to Bingham and Gross, in \nJapan �Confucianism seems to have been entirely negative for women� , \nalthough they contradictorily discuss some benefits.  For example, in return \nfor her obedience, a woman could expect her male relatives to safeguard her \nwelfare; in old age she would be looked after; and as the mother of sons her \npower within the family could increase . The price was severely reduced \nindependence, expressed through the Triple Obedience Doctrine.  This \nprescribes that a woman should always be under the control of a male \nrelative (father, brother/husband, son) .  In addition, a new bride was \ntotally subservient to her mother-in-law, a system which caused centuries of \nmisery .  It is from Confusion philosophy that a plethora of very sexist \nproverbs stem, and which promoted the idea that husband and wife not display \npublic affection for each other .  The impact of these attitudes is clear in \nlaw and in the Tokugawa �house rules.�\n\nTo take a closer look at some specific Samurai traditions, a philosophy now \nassociated deeply with Japan in general and Samurai in particular is Zen. \nIts focus on austerity and, simplistically put, voidness, appealed to the \nSamurai and became an important philosophical source in notions of \nself-destruction.  In a philosophy that came to have such strong association \nwith warriors, it is interesting that a woman played an important role in \nits early years in Japan.  Mugai Nyodai lived for most of the thirteenth \ncentury , and rarely for a non-literary Japanese woman, is know in her own \nright, rather than by her association with a man (in fact, her father and \nhusband are unknown) .  Although married to a Hojo, for some reason she \nbegan to study Zen under Mugaku Sogen, a Chinese priest who had been invited \nto Japan in 1279 to head a temple .  She became his star pupil, and he \nacknowledged her as the heir to his teachings, giving her the character Mu \nfrom his own name . Mugai was the first women in Japan �fully qualified not \nas a nun but as a Zen priest (Zen so)� . She founded a network of temples \nand convents, and served as Abbess of them .\nThe overarching philosophy of the Samurai was Bushido, and it is symbiotic \nwith martial training. How then did it apply to women? Nitobe Inazo�s text \n�Bushido� on Samurai ethics first appeared in bookshops in 1900 .  It reads \nvery strongly as an attempt to justify Bushido and Japanese culture to \nChristians and Europeans. �Bushido� contains an entire chapter on women,  \nand it is largely concerned with arguing that Japanese women are just as \nchaste and feminine/domestic as their Western counterparts.  Before this \nhowever Inazo makes a revealing comment: �While the Samurai went on \npractising and extolling martial traits�they went so far as to tinge the \nideals of womanhood with Amazonian character� .  His description of the \neducation of young girls� demonstrates many similarities to that of young \nboys.  They �were trained to repress their feelings, to indurate their \nnerves, to manipulate weapons�  and how to commit suicide .  Bushido most \nvalued women who �displayed a heroic fortitude worthy of the strongest and \nthe bravest of men� .  Inazo refers to the triple-obedience doctrine, \nlinking it to self-sacrifice and suicide with numerous examples .  Woman \nannihilates herself for man, and he for his master .  Thus women have the \nsame moral duty as men, but directed by gender, not status.  Also woman were \nthought to provide naijo, inner help, as their primary duty .  The examples \nof many warrior women clearly indicate that a woman�s help was not \nrestricted to naijo � if it seemed necessary her martial training could be \nput to immediate use.\n\nAccording to Tyler most Samurai class women received instruction in the \nmartial arts . Amdur points out that in the early days of the Samurai, women \nwere pioneers in dangerous new lands, where martial skills were extremely \nnecessary . Salmondson claims that every Samurai woman was expected to \nmaster the naginata (see below) by the time she was eighteen . In fact, she \nargues that Samurai women were vital to defense and offence throughout the \nmedieval era . To quote Ribner and Chin:\n�As part of their position, the Samurai women were expected to be as \nexcellent with weapons as the Samurai men of their families. Starting when \nthey were young girls, they were taught how to use several traditional \nweapons- the straight spear, the dagger, and, of course, the naginata. This \nlong weapon was usually hung over the doors of every Samurai household, and \nwomen were expected to protect their homes with it if necessary. More than \nthis, women were sometimes important warriors in their own right, commanding \nlarge numbers of men in huge battles� .\nA naginata is a curved sword blade attached to a spear, is between five and \nnine feet long  and was especially used by women and priests . There were \nother weapons which were particularly favored for women also. The bow was \nuseful for defending the home at long distances, such as from the roof ; a \nsmall dagger was always carried in case suicide became necessary ; and \nfinally the kusari-gama, which resembles a cycle with a weighted chain  and \nis useful against a sword and in close quarters. This shows that although \ntheir presence on a battlefield was unusual (as is shown by Hatakeyama�s \nsurprise at seeing Tomoe) women were actually expected to possess martial \nskills. Samurai women maintained these skills until modernization (see \nbelow).\n\nWithout a doubt, Tome Gozen is the most famous of Japan�s women warriors. \nThere are two primary sources relating to Tomoe: The Heike Monogatari and \nthe Gempei Josui Ki. Sadly the only English translation I could obtain of \nthe Heike Monogatari is abridged and much (although not all) of Tomoe&#39;s \nstory has been left out, and no translation of the other is available, so \nthese works are only accessed through secondary authors. Tyler is a \nparticularly valuable source since his translations are his own. Tyler \ncautions that the story of Tomoe has been much embroidered, and therefore \nnot all of the story which is to follow can be considered historical truth. \nIn the majority it comes, however, from primary sources. Tomoe fought with \nYoshinaka Minamoto. Tomoe is described as a horse-breaker who rode \nfearlessly on the roughest ground; her handling of bow and sword a match for \na thousand warriors; she had won matchless renown in many battles against \nthe bravest captains; in short, she was &quot;fit to meet either god or devil&quot; . \nOther descriptions add that she had commanded large forces ; including that \nshe was �commander of Minamoto forces in the earlier phases of the \nTaira-Minamoto war�  and that her fierce horse kicked up so much snow that \nthe Taira thought they were facing a dozen men . As Yoshinaka retreated from \nKyoto with Yoshitsune in pursuit, Tomoe escaped injury through several \nfierce battles , and in the &quot;last fight, when all the others had been slain \nor had fled, among the last seven there rode Tomoe&quot; . It is for these last \nskirmishes that she is famous.\n\nAfter a disastrous engagement with Yoshitsune, Yoshinaka and his forces rode \nto meet Imai Kanehira who was commanding forces in Seta . They were pursued \nalong the way until, as the quote says, only seven accompanied the \ndishonorably fleeing Yoshinaka . According to The Gempei Josui Ki, the head \nof the force pursuing them was Hatakeyama, who was puzzled to see a \nformidable warrior he did not recognize . Upon being informed that she was \nTomoe, a women, he appears to have been somewhat at a loss how to handle the \nsituation . He eventually decided to engage her in single combat, in the \nprocess concluded that she must be a demon, and as a result retreated . A \nlittle later the band of seven encountered around thirty-five riders, led by \nUchida, who despite being afraid of Tomoe had orders from Yoritomo to \ncapture her alive . This did not prevent him from trying to behead her, but \nshe returned the favor and presented the head to Yoshinaka, who was \nprofoundly unenthusiastic . He commanded her to leave so that dying with a \nwoman would not disgrace him, and sent her to inform his wife of what had \nhappened . The Heike Monogatari differs slightly, placing Tomoe&#39;s duel after \nshe has been ordered to leave, and she searches out a commander to fight to \nprove her worth to Yoshinaka . Any number of naginata schools have claimed \nher as their founder , despite the fact that she is described as using a \nsword, bow and dagger, but not a naginata.\n\nThere in a Noh play titled Tomoe which &quot;is the only nibamme-mono \n[warrior-genre] in which the shite (main character) is a woman&quot; . In the \nplay the cowardliness the chronicles describe in Yoshinaka is ignored; in \nfact he has been deified . Tomoe on the other hand is a ghost tainted by her \nbitterness at his refusal to allow her to die with him . Thus although it \npays tribute to Tomoe&#39;s valor, &quot;she is stained and, in an important sense, \nhumbled. In this manner the play restores proper harmony&quot; . So although \nTomoe captured the popular imagination, it was inconceivable that a woman \ncould display more honor than a man, particularly a great General such as \nYoshinaka. Heroic warrior though she was, she was not worthy spiritually to \ndie with her lord as any male retainer could have done. Yoshinaka needed her \nhelp but seems to have been uncomfortable about it.\n\nTomoe was not, by any means, the only woman to fight in the Gempei war and \nthe surrounding years; it is the great number who did, in fact, which led to \nmy choice of this period. She is the best documented however, and warnings \nabout unreliability must be emphasized even further for the other women \ndiscussed below. Tomoe was not the only woman to ride with Yoshinaka. \nAnother female commander was Aoi, who had however been killed before the \nescape from Kyoto . It is interesting that most women warriors fought on the \nside which lost. Perhaps the desperation of their side�s situation allowed \nthem to put their skills to the test.\n\nOn the other side was Yoshitsune&#39;s mistress Shizuka Gozen, who did use a \nnaginata and to good effect, notably in the defense of Horikawa palace in \n1185 . Shizuka was a very famous Shirabyoshi dancer, a style in which the \ndancer dresses as a man . Her defiance after her capture by Yoritomo, \ndespite her pregnancy, is one of the most romantic episodes in the \nthoroughly romanticized story of Yoshitsune, and two Noh plays Yoshino \nShizuka and Futari Shizuka retell the tale . After her interrogation she was \nordered to dance for Yoritomo and some of his favored vassals . She \naccompanied the dance with a song in praise of Yoshitsune and longing for \ntheir happy days to return, a deliberate insult to Yoritomo and a \npotentially fatal act of defiance . Her life was spared allegedly because of \nthe intercession of Yoritomo�s wife and daughter , but her son was killed at \nbirth and she died a year later . Her decision to face death and remain \nloyal to her lord exemplifies Samurai ethos.\n\nWhen faced with a rebellion in 1221, Masako Hojo over-rode her brother&#39;s \ndefensive plan to enforce her own aggressive tactical decisions, which \nresulted in total victory . The fact that the army supported a female \nGeneral over a male one again indicates that in times of crisis martial \nability was more important than gender. Early in his career Masako�s husband \nYoritomo had his life saved by Ike Gozen, a Zen nun, warrior, and Fujiwara . \nThe famed first Shogun (in the modern sense) seems to have been surrounded \nby strong women.\n\nWomen attempted feats their male counterparts would not, caused desperation \namong their enemies and did their duty as warriors even when death was \ncertain. At the battle of lake Biwa a woman named Koman saved the Minamoto \nbanner from the Taira, swimming to shore with it in her teeth as arrows \nrained about her . In a battle between Yoshinaka and the Taira, a woman \nnamed Hangaku, daughter of Moritsuna, earned renown, and even more so in \n1201 when she defended her father&#39;s stockade with bow and naginata . \nAccording to Jones, the enemy so despaired of felling her that they resorted \nto shooting her in the back, &quot;a very un-Samurai act&quot; . The wife of Kajiwara \nGenda Kagesuya, Fujinoye, defended Takadachi Castle in 1189 and killed two \nfamous warriors, Yemeto Juro and Nagasawa Uyemen-taro in a duel . A naginata \nmaster named Itagaki was a female Taira general who commanded three thousand \nsoldiers in a suicide charge against ten thousand Hojo in 1199, an act which \nhas remained inspirational and maintained respect for her . Han Gaku fought \nin around 1200 (unsuccessfully) against the Kamakura Shogunate . She was \nsentenced to execution but saved when an enemy Samurai asked to marry her , \nshowing that martial valor did not lead the women to be perceived as \nmasculine.\n\nMany Taira women also fought in the sea battle that decimated their clan. \nThe number adds credence to the suggestion that women fought most in \nsituations where there was the least hope of victory and survival. An \ninteresting detail of the history of that battle is that in possibly its \nmost famous incident, where a Minamoto archer shoot down a fan bearing a \ndesign of a red sun on white field (the origin of the national flag) , is \nthat the fan was hung by a teenaged girl in hakama , the split skirt still \nworn by martial artists. More actively involved was Tamaori Hime, Atsumori&#39;s \nwife, who fought on the beach with a naginata . Tenji-no-tsubone fought with \nSagami Goro  and Mochimitsu&#39;s mistress Sasaraye also fought; she is depicted \nsomewhat tragically in prints, wielding a naginata on a sinking ship . \nSalmondson claims that others fought but with somewhat less convincing \nevidence than she presents for the above cases.\n\nIt may be observed that many of the warrior women discussed bare the title \nor surname &quot;Gozen&quot;. According to Salmonson, &quot;Gozen&quot; was &quot;a title of high \nrespect given to many martial women&quot; . However the possession of the title \nby non-warriors shows that it was not isolated to them. The Heike Monogatari \nprovides a clue as to the title&#39;s origins. One of the first stories is that \nof Kiyomori (the great leader of the Taira) and two Shirabyoshi. Shirabyoshi \nwere dancers, the pre-runners of Geisha , and bore the title &quot;Gozen&quot;. These \ndancers had originally danced with a white dagger in their belt, although by \nmedieval times this had been discarded . Given that Samurai class women all \nhad a dagger, often presented as a wedding gift, with which to kill \nthemselves if necessary , perhaps &quot;Gozen&quot; is connected to the possession or \nuse of such a weapon. Tyler either equates it with the English title \n&quot;mistress&quot; or links it (by reverse association) to professional women \nstorytellers who related the tales of the warrior women , while towards the \nend of The Heike Monogatari appears a young boy very confusingly given the \ntitle Gozen .\n\nProbably much used in Japanese warfare (especially from the Sengoku era \nonward), although their use was dishonorable and consequently only \nsporadically recorded, were shinobi or ninja. The thirty-fourth Grand master \nof the Togakure Ryu, Dr. Hatsumi, writes that &quot;kunoichi or female ninja made \nup an important part of the historical ninja families and clans of Japan&quot; . \nKunoichi, while trained fully in fighting techniques, were also trained to \nmake the best use of &quot;their own unique features and strengths&quot; . He gives \nillustrations of bunches of flowers used to conceal daggers and tea kit bags \ncontaining explosives , and one can imagine any number of other advantages \nwomen may have had in concealment, not least in their otherwise restrictive \nlayers of bulky kimono. Because of her sex, enemies often overlooked &quot;her \npotential as a destructive adversary. Women in feudal Japan were often \nunderestimated in terms of their capabilities for power, and this permitted \nthe kunoichi...to gain easy access to the very center of the enemy \nstronghold&quot; .\n\nThe most famous kunoichi lived in the later half of the sixteenth century, \noutside the main scope of this paper, however she has been included because \nshe was not just a female ninja but also a kunoichi jonin, or the commander \nof a group of female ninja . Working for the Takeda family, she was the head \nof a miko (female Shinto shrine attendant) spy-ring: &quot;Chiyome gathered \norphaned and runaway girls...and trained them as miko vestal virgins while \nalso training them as kunoichi female ninja agents&quot; . She is so famous that \nshe even turns up in a children�s book by Mayer titled &quot;Women Warriors&quot; . \nNinja were outcastes, so the participation of women in shinobi activities \nshows that female martial prowess was not restricted to, or necessarily a \nproduct of, the Samurai class alone. In fact, Omi province was especially \nfamous from its strong peasant women such as Okane and Oiko , and there are \nstories of women brawlers and bandits also, such as Oroku and Omatsu \nrespectively .\n\nAn area of martial life where abilities were put to the test was revenge. \nRevenge was in medieval Japan �a solemn duty, both sanctioned and practiced \nat the highest levels of the Samurai class� . Not only was it a duty, but \n�its requirements were by no means confined to the male line of the family� \n. Women avengers include Hatsu-jo, who�s story is the basis of the kabuki \nplay Onoye Iwafuji (her victim was Tsubone Iwafuji) and Tora Gozen who aided \nthe Soga brothers  (The Soga brothers� revenge occurred during an incident \nwhich was initially thought to have killed Yoritomo  ). Revenge was also \npossible between women. Haru-jo, also the basis of a play, avenged an insult \nagainst her mistress that had caused her to commit suicide . The maid took \nher revenge with a sword against the noblewomen who had perpetrated the \ninsult .\n\nThe revenge story that is best documented is that of Miyagino and Shinobu, \nwhich occurred in the Edo period and is told in the kabuki play Gotai Eiki \nShiro Ishi Banashi  . They were daughters of a farmer who was murdered by a \nSamurai; further more Miyagino was a tayu, or courtesan of the highest \nstatus . The sisters ran away from their respective occupations and studied \nthe martial arts . In 1649 they formally asked their Daimyo to authorize the \nrevenge . The Samurai was still in service; he was summoned and the duel was \n�carried out in front of the approving daimyo and his senior retainers� \nMiyagino was armed with a naginata� which by the Edo Period had become the \ntraditional weapon for women. Shinobu wielded a kusari-gama� . Shinobu \nentangled their opponent�s sword in her chain while Miyagino finished him \noff . The combination of these weapons was very popular. Sono-jo and Kiku-jo \nalso avenged their father in an arraigned duel using these weapons . Revenge \nwas made illegal in 1873 .\n\nA female specific form of revenge was uwanari-uchi. This was the socially \nsanctioned custom (common in the Heian period) of a wife attacking a second \nwife, concubine or lover, usually by attacking her house . The rival had the \nright to defend herself and her property . Such attacks were not just \nmotivated by jealousy. Other reasons were to defend the succession of \nchildren  or the family of the first wife�s economic interests . At that \ntime the man joined the women�s family, not vice versa, and they supported \nhim economically . Although the custom continued until the sixteenth century \n, Masako�s command of a small army to destroy Lady Kame�s house  is the \nbest-known example.\n\nMasako�s husband was Yoritomo, who is considered a great example of a \nSamurai, and is acclaimed as the first Shogun and the man who unified Japan \nunder a central government. He was a hard man who executed many, including \nwomen, children and his own brothers. That is what makes it particularly \ninteresting that his wife repeatedly defied him, took armies to his \nmistresses and after his death took over government. Although not a warrior \nby conventional definition, Masako was an able general, and maintained the \nloyalty of the Samurai in preference to male leaders. Because of her \nsignificance, a brief biography in included.\n\nMasako Hojo was Yoritomo&#39;s wife, the daughter of his guardian as mentioned. \nHistorical and popular opinion has been divided on Masako, who is seen as \n&quot;either one of the most tragic or one of the most Machiavellian figures in \nJapanese history&quot; . Her family was quite insignificant, ruling only a small \narea, and although descended from the Taira the Hojo were not of \ndistinguished lineage . Masako was only three when the thirteen year-old \nYoritomo was exiled into the care of her father . Her mother had died when \nshe was young , and when she was twenty her father met and married a woman \nthe same age as her while on guard duty in Kyoto . On his return Masako and \nher stepmother Maki began an enmity which would eventually result in her \nfather�s disgrace and exile . At the same time her father, Tokimasa, also \ndiscovered that Masako and Yoritomo had begun a relationship .\n\nAlthough some authors have maintained that Masako married Yoritomo because \nof political ambition, her father&#39;s reaction shows the foolishness of the \nidea. He was angry at the affair for good reason; Yoritomo was an exile with \nno prospects, an alliance with the Minamoto would seriously jeopardize the \nposition of the Hojo and not least Yoritomo had already fathered a child \nwith the daughter of another local lord of superior power to Tokimasa, and \nthis lord had killed the child to maintain good relations with the Taira . \nMasako and Yoritomo eloped .\n\nTheir first son, Yoriie, was born in 1181 . Yoritomo appointed the daughter \nof his own Menoto as Yoriie&#39;s . This was a great honor, as &quot;the family of \nhis nurse would stand to gain tremendous power and influence...the choice \nwould later prove to have been a poor one&quot; . The family spoilt the child and \ngrew &quot;arrogant in their assumption of power&quot; . Menoto relationships were \ncrucial, providing &quot;an undeniably influential force in Kamakura politics&quot; . \nMasako, coming from a provincial and unimportant family, had not experienced \nthis system . She was already raising her daughter , and as the eldest child \nhad probably raised her brothers after her mother&#39;s death. Her life and that \nof her family was radically changed, as she went from being the wife of an \nexile to the wife of the most powerful man in eastern Japan was . While she \nhad been pregnant Yoritomo had established a house for a mistress, Lady Kame \n. Under Masako&#39;s orders, a small army belonging to Masako&#39;s stepmother&#39;s \nbrother destroyed the house, although the mistress escaped . Yoritomo was \nfurious and snubbed his wife, resulting in the Hojo faction marching back to \nIzu . Unable to lose their support, Yoritomo was reconciled with Masako . \nThe importance of their marital harmony to politics and to the course of \nJapanese history seems bizarre in retrospect. This was the first incident of \nthe conflict which would continue throughout their marriage over the issue \nof Yoritomo&#39;s mistresses. It is also the most famous recorded incident of \nuwanari-uchi, the right of a first wife to defend her interests against \nothers.\n\nYoshinaka sent his eldest son Yoshitaka to Yoritomo, hoping to marry him to \nMasako&#39;s eldest child, Ohime . Masako and Ohime were pleased with the idea \nand continued to grow fonder of the boy over time, but Yoritomo considered \nhim a hostage . Keeping the example of his own life in mind, Yoritomo \ndecided to kill him . Masako and Ohime tried to help Yoshitaka escape, but \nthe plan failed and he was killed . Ohime became seriously ill in grief and \nthis caused another rift between Masako and Yoritomo . Another event which \npitted mother/daughter against Yoritomo was the sentencing of Shizuka. Both \nMasako and Ohime visited Shizuka while she was captive, and according to the \nAzuma Kagami Masako is supposed to have justified the woman&#39;s defiance to \nher husband after the dance, pointing out that she would have done the same \n. Ohime went further, offering to help Shizuka escape, an offer the dancer \nturned down as she was resolved to die . In 1194 Ohime&#39;s parents tried to \nmarry her to her cousin, but she refused and threatened suicide .\n\nOhime died in 1197 aged nineteen . In 1199 Yoritomo died . In the same year \nMasako&#39;s second daughter Sanman, aged fourteen, also died . Yoriie succeeded \nas Shogun, only to be assassinated in 1204 at the instigation of Masako&#39;s \nfather . His brother Sanetomo, who was a minor, replaced Yoriie . This gave \nrise to the position of regent for the Shogun, filled first by his \ngrandfather Tokimasa . The son of Yoriie, who was in turn killed by Masako�s \nyounger brother, the second Regent Hojo Yoshitoki, had purportedly \nassassinated Sanetomo in 1219 . This was the end of Yoritomo&#39;s line, and \nSanetomo was the last Minamoto Shogun . In the debate over who should \nsucceed Sanetomo, Masako and her father, apparently under the influence of \nhis wife, were pitted against each other, and Tokimasa was forced to retire \nby Masako and her brother Yoshitoki . Masako began\n\n&quot;immediately putting the finishing touches to the organizational machinery \nof the Kamakura government which would assure the continued dominance of her \nown family, the Hojo, for more than a century to come&quot; .\n\nThe governmental system seems bizarre, even by medieval standards! \nFitzgerald describes it thus:\n&quot;There was now an Emperor, almost always a child: an ex-Emperor, his father, \nand often a senior ex-Emperor, who had more influence than the junior one. \nThen there was the Minamoto Shogun, now also often a child, and behind him, \nthe real power in the land, the Regent for the Shogun, always...[a] Hojo&quot; .\n\nIf possible, during Masako&#39;s lifetime it was even more complex, because she \nstood behind the Regent.\n\nIn her political maneuvering, she worked with Kaneko no Fujiwara, also \ncalled Kyo no Tsubone, the menoto of Emperor Go-Toba, and who controlled all \ncourt appointments . According to Butler, contemporary sources refer to the \nwomen as &quot;the two women politicians of east and west&quot; and he claims that \nthey were &quot;two of the most powerful figures in Japan&quot; . Kaneko had received \nthe Junior Second Rank (equivalent to the rank of the Three Ministers) in \n1207, a tangible symbol of the influence she wielded at court . One could \nparallel the women with the Emperor and the Shogun, the men they \nmanipulated. Mulhern describes them in these terms: &quot;While Kaneko displayed \nthe quick wit and mastery of social stratagem highly valued in court \ncircles, Masako demonstrated the rugged pride of Bando warriors ...as well \nas their pragmatic attitude&quot; . The women had met in 1218 to find a successor \nfrom the Imperial family, a &quot;joint effort of these formidable women, both in \ntheir sixties&quot; . Keneko also arranged an award of the Junior Third Rank for \nMasako, who, having become a nun on her second son�s death , was the first \ntonsured person to receive court rank since the only other example in the \neighth century .\n\nHer successful tactical decisions in 1221 enhanced her reputation and her \npre-battle speech, maybe created by the authors of Azuma Kagami, shows her \nunderstanding of the warriors� mentality . It is not surprising that she was \nknown as Ama-Shogun, the Nun-General . According to Sansom, �hers was a \nsupreme example of a women�s rise to eminence, but it was by no means \nwithout parallel in early feudal Japan� . She died in 1225 . Dilts describes \nher rule glowingly as an era of justice and lower taxation . Her biography \nwould be almost unthinkable in the Japan of later years, certainly for a \nhero. She disobeyed her father, argued violently with her husband and went \nagainst his direct orders to try and save people he had condemned. After his \ndeath she took government and along with other politically capable women \nsuccessfully ran the country for the rest of her life. The Samurai preferred \nto be commanded by a woman rather than by her brother.\n\nWomen were therefore significant actors in medieval Japanese history, not \nleast in the martial sphere. As Mulhern writes:\n�By no means isolated, unusual cases born of freakish twists of fate or \npreternatural strength, these are�women who exerted their influence on \nsociety, people, and nation far beyond the familial sphere. They are not \nheroes who happened to be female nor who renounced their female identity in \ndefiance to bravely enter the male domain in pursuit of success and power. \nRather, their feminine identity was an essential factor in most of their \ncontributions significant enough to alter or shape the course of Japan�s \nHistory� .\nWomen were pioneers in new lands alongside their husbands in the regions \nwhere the Samurai class developed. They fought in the wars which brought the \nascendancy of the Samurai class, and were political forces to be reckoned \nwith. The course of Samurai, and of Japanese, history would have been \nradically different had later standards regarding gender relations been \nrigorously applied in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\n\nThe Gempei War and aftermath could be seen as the last fling of active, \nparticipatory women in pre-modern Japan. The Heike Monogatari, the primary \nsource for the war, although �labeled as a war tale, described as a story of \nthe rise and fall of men, it is fundamentally a tale about women .  Although \nthere followed many other significant and powerful women, they became \nincreasingly the exception and isolated from one-another. Japanese Samurai \nclass women maintained their martial abilities and preparedness, but tended \nnot to take to the battlefield in such large numbers again. A notable \nexception is the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, which saw a regiment of naginata \nwielding women pitted against the Imperial Army�s artillery . Writing in \n1899, Bacon relates discovering a military uniform, complete with spear \ncover, among the clothes of a Japanese Lady . It was explained to her that \nthey were a vital part of the wardrobe of any Lady, to be used in defense of \nthe premises if necessary in the absence of the men . Another nineteenth \ncentury traveler records a Samurai women showing off her sword. The Lady \nexplained that all high-ranking women wore them for self-defense, calling an \nattendant to attack her daughter in example . Her defense was so energetic \nthat the retainer was �very glad when she cried out �Enough�� . These \nexamples, and the two million women who continue to study the naginata , \nshow that the martial legacy of women such a Tomoe lives on.\n\nAppendix A\nSources\n\nBecause of the mono-linguistic restrictions of the author, it is impossible \nto verify the accuracy of information all of which is based on primary \nsources in Japanese, and most unavailable in translation.  In compensation, \ncare has been taken that the sources listed in the bibliography are of \nscholarly standard. Nearly all of the authors are/were professors at \ninternationally acclaimed Universities, and the validity of those without \nacademic credentials is assured by virtue of their citation in other of the \nsources whose authors do posses them. An example of this is Salmondson, a \ncentral source but not an academic one. She is cited in many of the other \nworks, and her reliance on Mary Beard, an acclaimed author, from whose work \n&quot;Women Who Shaped Japan&quot; most of the stories come (I was sadly unable to \nobtain a copy of this work as it has been out of print for some time), lends \nher legitimacy.\n\nMost of the authors are male, and while this does not necessarily mean that \nthey neglect the agency of women when discussing Japanese history, in this \ninstance it seems to be the case. The few female authors, such as Dilts, \nshow women to have been far more significant when narrating the same events. \nThe approach of many authors may be guessed at when Turnbull, the \npre-eminent authority on Samurai history in English language sources and \nwidely acclaimed for his Japanese works, can write a statement such as &quot;the \nonly &#39;female warrior&#39; in the whole of Samurai history - Tomoe Gozen&quot; . There \nare, of course, many explanations for this. Military history is not a field \nwhich attracts many women and since &#39;women&#39;s history&#39; became a separate \ncategory those not concerned with it have more justification in neglecting \nto mention women. The Japanese sources themselves provide little information \non those women who are mentioned, making it difficult to discuss them \nconfidently in an historical work without specifically researching them. \nTherefore the focus must be somewhat sociological rather than strictly \nhistorical. All Japanese names are given in the western format to save \nconfusion, that is, surname last.\n\nAppendix B\nHistorical Background\n\nAlthough the medieval age was �a time of considerable disintegration and \nwarfare, it also saw great economic, social, and cultural changes� . The \nperiod between the Heian and Kamakura eras is significant because the Gempei \nWar was the crucible in which the Samurai, as they are known today, were \nformed. It replaced the aesthetic court of The Tale of Genji with Shogunal, \nmilitary government which continued in various forms until 1868 . War often \ndefines or alters societal boundaries. Likewise �Japanese history provides \nstriking examples of how changes in the status of women can be linked with \nother broad socioeconomic trends� . The following summery of the period \nillustrates some of these changes.\n\nThe rise of the great houses, the Taira and the Minamoto, occurred against \nthe background of the Fujiwara court dominance. The Fujiwara had modelled \ntheir government on the Chinese (T�ang) model . Life at court was also \nmodelled on the Chinese example, even, as Dilts point out, when it was far \nfrom practical . Maintaining the court�s life-style was very expensive and \nplaced an almost impossible burden of taxation on the peasants . From the \nlate eighth century onwards �aristocrats and princes with no prospects in \nthe Fujiwara dominated capital left to seek their fortunes in the outlying \nregions� . As part of the Fujiwara policy of allotting large portions of \nland to simplify tax collection, provincial territories were allotted to \nthese nobles, who were often younger or less favoured sons of Emperors . \nBecause of their more immediate presence and lower taxation demands (because \nthey no longer had to maintain an expensive court life-style), many peasants \nchose to place themselves under the protection of the provincial lords \nrather than the Fujiwara . These lords became powerful, rich and the centre \nof significant military forces . The Fujiwara used these forces rather than \nchallenging them .\n\nThe courtiers, having turned to more aesthetic pursuits, were unwilling to \naccept a Shogunal commission, so the rural lords were �the men upon whom \nfell the task of maintaining law and order� . In land wars against the Ainu \nand sea battles with pirates, professional, hereditary soldiers (the \nforbearers of the Samurai) emerged, in the service of local lords and not \nthe court . The most powerful of the military clans who emerged from this \nbackground were the Minamoto (who gained territory from the Ainu) and the \nTaira (who fought pirates on the inland sea and coast) . Eventually the \nclans gained a sense of their own power and importance  and inevitably the \nday came when they were called in to settle a court dispute . This battle is \nknown as the Hogen Incident , and occurred in July of 1156 . The conflict \nwas not strictly divided along clan lines, with a significant Minamoto named \nYoshitomo and others supporting the Taira, and vice versa , but the Taira \nfamily was the clear victor .\n\nThe Minamoto retaliated in 1160 led by Yoshitomo and his sons ; he had not \nbeen successful in court politics and moreover had been obliged to execute \nis own father, which was particularly difficult given the cultural emphasis \non filial piety . This was termed the Heiji incident , and again resulted in \ndefeat of the Minamoto, who were subject to �a savage series of executions� \n. Of Yoshitomo�s nine sons , all who were considered adults were executed , \nleaving thirteen year-old Yoritomo (who had fought beside his father) and \nthree younger half-brothers who escaped with their mother before being \ndramatically captured . The younger boys were sent to different monasteries  \nwhile Yoritomo was exiled into the custody of a Taira ally . By 1164 �there \nwas but one adult Minamoto left alive� .\n\nIn 1180 this survivor, then seventy-four, led an insurrection which was the \nopening conflict of the Gempei war . It was not a widespread rebellion and \nwas crushed by the Taira . However, because of the support that the warrior \nmonks of Buddhist temples had lent the Minamoto, the Taira forces indulged \nin a vengeful rampage against the monasteries . In one burning, 3, 500 \npeople of all ages and both genders were killed .  The Taira leader \nKiyomori, Yoshitomo�s old enemy, also ordered that Yoritomo be executed . \nWith the support of his custodian, whose daughter he had married, Yoritomo \nkilled the local Deputy Governor and raised the Minamoto banner, to which \nsupporters flocked . On the ninth of November 1180, the massed armies of the \ngreat houses faced each other for the first time since the war began, and \nthe Taira fled in the night .\n\nOver the following years two other Minamoto played pivotal roles. The first \nwas Yoritomo�s cousin, Yoshinaka. A great general, Yoshinaka and his \nsupporters formed the third power-bloc (between the Taira and Yoritomo�s \nsupporters) in Japan by 1181 . A series of natural disasters interrupted the \nwar until mid 1182, and popular resentment was directed at the monk-slaying \nTaira . As soon as action resumed, Yoshinaka rapidly expanded his territory \nuntil he was only forty miles from Kyoto, the capital . To face him, the \nTaira press-ganged a huge army, which, however, �was probably deserting \nfaster than it was marching� . Yoshinaka defeated this army in a victory \nwhich marked the turning point of the war . He took the capital and the \nTaira escaped with most of the Royal Family and the Imperial Regalia .\n\nThe second man mentioned was Yoshitsune, Yoritomo�s brother. He was the \nyoungest child of Yoshitomo, having been born the year his father died . \nYoshitsune was an exceptionally gifted general; in fact, he won most of \nYoritomo�s battles for him. His first mission from his brother was to \neliminate the rival Minamoto, Yoshinaka . When that was done, Yoshitsune was \nsent after the Taira . On April twenty-fifth 1185 the last battle took place \nat sea, resulting in �the most tragic mass suicide in the history of the \nSamurai� by the Taira and the Royal Family . After their defeat, �the name \nof the Taira disappeared from Japanese history. No other victory in the \nstory of the Samurai was so complete and so decisive� .\n\nYoritomo established a hereditary military dictatorship with the title \nShogun, and removed government to Kamakura . There he established the first \ncentral government of unified Japan, called the Bakufu (tent government), \nand �the institutions of Japanese feudalism derive in a great part from his \nwork� . As reward for his contribution, Yoshitsune was hunted down and \nbeheaded . In 1193 Yoritomo also had killed his last remaining brother . \nHaving eliminated all competition, in 1199 he fell off his horse and died . \nAfter such promising beginnings, �within thirty years of the founding of the \nKamakura Shogunate the third and last Minamoto Shogun had been assassinated, \nand his place taken by the Hojo� .  Thus the outcasts of the Heian court and \nthe warriors who gathered around them became the rulers of Japan.\n\nBibliography\n\nBacon, A., Japanese Girls and Women, Boston: The Riverside Press, 1899.\n\nBenneville, J.
