Do you think that a kaishaku is \n&gt;mandatory or can seppuku be as &quot;pure&quot; without someone you trust being there \n&gt;to make sure you maintain your honor?\n\nMatt,\nI think I am kind of where Tom is. In other words, my answer is \nbasically &quot;it depends&quot;. Seppuku was done in diferent \nways, for different reasons, over a long period of time. You have \nthe death penalty, the following one&#39;s lord into death, the atoning \nfor mistakes/failures, the protest, the ultimate solution on the \nbattle field, and surely others that I can&#39;t think of just now.\n\nSo, it really depends on the specifics. Or, another way to say it is - \nno I don&#39;t see a kaishaku as being mandatory in all cases.\n\nIf you are talking about seppuku as death penalty, in the more \ncrystalized and formalized later ceremony, then yes it was necessary. \nSaying it even more strongly, you couldn&#39;t have had a &#39;seppuku&#39; \nwithout it, since in later cases (as we&#39;ve discussed) the &#39;seppuku&#39; \nwas being performed with a fan or a shinai.\n\nIf we are talking about seppuku as dying at one&#39;s own hands rather \nthan at the hands of one&#39;s enemies, a la Nobunaga, then no a \nkaishaku was not necessary, even if it were possible to round one up.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
