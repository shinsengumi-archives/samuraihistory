And, it is a bi=\r\nt of a tricky one. The answer has often been misunderstood, in the West epe=\r\ncially, with many writings that talk about Zen as THE religion of the samur=\r\nai. There really is no doubt that Zen did have an influence,to what degree =\r\nis debateable, on the medieval samurai class and Japanese society that stil=\r\nl exists to this day. HOWEVER, one should not paint with too broad of a bru=\r\nsh and say that Zen was the religion of the samurai. The samurai class was =\r\na very religiously diverse group which included almost all schools of Buddh=\r\nism as well as some that for the most part rejected Buddhism and relied mor=\r\ne on Shinto beliefs. The most common religious belief would be, like Japane=\r\nse society as a whole, some form of Pure Land Buddhism. Pure Land Buddhism =\r\nis a faith that entrusts future salvation to the Buddha Amida. The belief i=\r\ns that by believing in and chanting the name of Amida Buddha one would be r=\r\neborn in his Pure Land and be able to learn from the Amida Buddha directly =\r\nin order to obtain enlightenment. Now to be fair this is a a very simplifie=\r\nd exaplination. But, in it we can find why it is so popular. Faith in Amida=\r\n&#39;s compassion for all senient beings allows for a much easier path for the =\r\naverage farmer or warrior that might die any moment on the battlefield. In =\r\nsecord place of common religion would proabably be the Nichiren sect. The B=\r\nASIC teaching of the Nichiren sect is that having faith in the Lotus Sutra =\r\nand chanting the name of the Lotus Sutra would lead to salvation. In an att=\r\nempt to keep it simple I may have glossed over some things, but basically I=\r\n am trying to show that when you engage in deadly combat as an occupation t=\r\nhese schools would provide a more attractive path. One must also remember t=\r\nhat medieval Zen was primarily a monastic order, although there certainly w=\r\nere some devout lay practitioners... Also there is generally not the one wa=\r\ny mentality as in the West. In Japan, then and nowm it would not be wrong f=\r\nor a believer in the Pure Land or some other school participating in Zen me=\r\nditation, or Zen influenced arts. While the Nichiren school rejected the pr=\r\nactices of other religious faith there was generally nothing wrong with pra=\r\ncticing aspects of more than one school of Buddhism as well as practicing S=\r\nhinto. I am not believer though in the theory that samurai practiced Zen ON=\r\nLY for a way to culturaly legitimate their power. While I think this is tru=\r\ne in some, perhaps many, cases there were also samurai that did follow Zen =\r\nreligiously. As far as Zen in samurai history I think we need to look somew=\r\nhere in the middle between the two extremes to get closer to the truth. In =\r\nan attempt to save some space I have left out a ton of stuff that could be =\r\nwritten, and at times I feel I went on more then needed. But, my basic poin=\r\nt is that one should not think of Zen as THE religion of the samurai, but r=\r\nather one of many practices that were a part warrior culture during the med=\r\nieval period.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________=\r\n____________\nRakastatko Hotmailia?
