Except for a few historical buildings, very little survives from =\r\nthe Japanese period. Those swords would have been found by now and made the=\r\n newspapers.\n\nA few years after the Japanese departed, the North Koreans fi=\r\nrst, and then the Chinese passed through Seoul before the Korean war ended =\r\nin a stalemate. Maybe they were found then and sold to foreign soldier.\n\nHm=\r\nmm, wonder if I did start a rumor concerning them using used chopsticks to =\r\nstart a bbq fire would anyone be interested in locating those burnt embers?=\r\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Bill \nSent: Saturday, September 29, 2012 2:41 PM\nTo: samuraihist=\r\nory@yahoogroups.com \nSubject: [samuraihistory] Samurai swords in cement\n\n  =\r\n\nGroup,\n\nAccording to a Nisei in 1946, several high-ranking Japanese office=\r\nrs in Korea buried their Samurai swords in cement prior to being repatriate=\r\nd to Japan. These swords were supposedly buried in the third step of a stai=\r\nrway in a building somewhere in Seoul. \n\nThe Nisei, presumably a member of =\r\nthe Military Intelligence Service (MIS), expressed an interest in locating =\r\nthe building and excavating the swords. He thought the swords might be valu=\r\nable.\n\nHas anyone ever heard this rumor before? If so, were the swords foun=\r\nd?\n\nBill Streifer\nThe Flight of the Hog Wild\nhttp://www.my-jia.com/The_Flig=\r\nht_of_the_Hog_Wild\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remove=\r\nd]\n\n\n"
