Some would be sent to=\r\n Edo\n&gt; directly to feed the retainers on sankin kotai duty, some would be s=\r\nold in\n&gt; Osaka to raise funds for the domain&#39;s operating expenses (which I =\r\nam\n&gt; thinking includes stipends for all those samurai) and some would be ke=\r\npt\n&gt; back for the domain itself. As I recall, the Shogun required all domai=\r\nns to\n&gt; pay taxes according to their assessed output, which was also measur=\r\ned in\n&gt; koku (kokudaka). This was terribly inefficient, as the Shogunate ha=\r\nd no\n&gt; means to force audits in most of the domains; their power didn&#39;t ext=\r\nend that\n&gt; far. So those huge tozama domains like Satsuma, Choshu, Kaga and=\r\n so forth,\n&gt; the largest domains, all underestimated their output near the =\r\nvalues first\n&gt; assessed right after the Sengoku period ended. But undoubted=\r\nly the output\n&gt; had gone up over time. The fudai and shimpan domains, the o=\r\nnes more closely\n&gt; associated with the Tokugawa, would be more closely moni=\r\ntored and drained\n&gt; of taxes, and thus domains like Mito would be poorer un=\r\nder the stresses of\n&gt; the shogunal system than a domain like Satsuma, who k=\r\nept rebellions due to\n&gt; shortages and disputes controlled (non-existent in =\r\nSatsuma&#39;s case) and also\n&gt; managed to undertake a fruitful black market tra=\r\nde in Ryukyu goods.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know all that is long-winded and unresourced, but=\r\n my main point is that\n&gt; koku became something of a chimera, more a symbol =\r\nof rank and status than\n&gt; actual income, and it meant different things rega=\r\nrding actual wealth,\n&gt; depending on where one lived. Most domains ended up =\r\ndepending more and more\n&gt; on a merchant economy, turning their rice and oth=\r\ner products into money,\n&gt; which was then pumped into improvements or just u=\r\nsed to keep from going\n&gt; &quot;underwater.&quot; The difficulties with the lord-retai=\r\nner system with regard to\n&gt; stipends was the fact that the lords could &quot;bor=\r\nrow back&quot; any time the domain\n&gt; was in trouble, and thus the individual sam=\r\nurai had to rely on merchant\n&gt; loans to meet their needs, and they fell dra=\r\nstically into debt holes from\n&gt; which they might never emerge.\n&gt;\n&gt; My main =\r\nsources for this information are the two mentioned in the last post\n&gt; and a=\r\nlso Craig&#39;s Choshu in the Meiji Restoration (which has an overview of\n&gt; how=\r\n Choshu&#39;s output was measured), Ravina&#39;s Last Samurai: The Life and\n&gt; Battl=\r\nes of Saigo Takamori includes the note about Satsuma having never had a\n&gt; p=\r\neasant rebellion and the &quot;goshi&quot; system of controls on peasant production.\n=\r\n&gt; Totman&#39;s Early Modern Japan had quite a bit of information on economic an=\r\nd\n&gt; land use initiatives of the Shogunate throughout the Edo period.\n&gt;\n&gt; So=\r\nrry I&#39;m a zero on the Sengoku era, having not yet tackled it in enough\n&gt; de=\r\npth to say anything meaningful without looking silly. I&#39;m sorry to have\n&gt; b=\r\neen so long-winded and rambling, but the subject of koku is linked to the\n&gt;=\r\n very fabric of the apparatus of government and was a constant bugaboo in t=\r\nhe\n&gt; Edo era. I&#39;m not sure how the system functioned before the Tokugawa; t=\r\nhat\n&gt; would be interesting to know. My guess is that it was similar but mor=\r\ne\n&gt; fragmented. As I recall, Osaka, as a rice and goods market, grew in\n&gt; p=\r\nroportion to Edo as a direct result of the centralization of the Edo era.\n&gt;=\r\n So I imagine it must have had a different dynamic in the Sengoku times and=\r\n\n&gt; before. Anyway, I hope this helped some!\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; Onnamusha\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S=\r\n. It is my understanding re: farmer income that each farmer is required\n&gt; t=\r\no submit a portion of the harvest to the domain and can keep some of its\n&gt; =\r\noutput for living (some could be sold at market to bring money as well).\n&gt; =\r\nMany farmers would do side-work like the impoverished lower samurai and man=\r\ny\n&gt; of the farmers were also &quot;on call&quot; to aid with reclamation or repair\n&gt; =\r\nprojects or for corvee duty along the main highways. They were compensated\n=\r\n&gt; for their work (but never enough) and sometimes they had to take jobs tha=\r\nt\n&gt; took them away from the land for a period of time (non producing season=\r\nal\n&gt; jobs). The stresses of such work often caused the land-working farmers=\r\n to go\n&gt; into hock and lose their lands to debtors, becoming tenant-farmers=\r\n, who\n&gt; would not benefit from their harvests but would have to submit it t=\r\no an\n&gt; overlord, who was the one to reap the benefits.
