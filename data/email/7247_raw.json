I was wondering if anyone had anyidea if there was anything of \ninterest n these area&#39;s for a japanese history buff that is NOT to be found \nin the usual tourist guides and history books. if anyone is familiar with \nthese area&#39;s it would be great if you could pass on any info, or words of \nwisdom.\n\n- third and finally (this is a bit of a weird one). i have a large interest \nin the unification of japan, ieyasu and co. i recently heard that written \nmusic originated in china about 600BC. i am well educated in music(grade 8 \ntheory) and am looking for information on medieval japanese munuscripts. i&#39;m \nafter books and websites with examples of the style they used to record \nmusic. i am totally ignorant,as western music is taught with only the \nwestern history. would be great if i could get hold of some medieval \njapanese music in western manuscript, in order to get my tiny brain round \nit. honestly, any information at all would be well appreciated.\n\n\ngreets\nCOMMISSIONER COD\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nBe the first to hear what&#39;s new at MSN - sign up to our free newsletters! \nhttp://www.msn.co.uk/newsletters\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
