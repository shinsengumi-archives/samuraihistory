It is clear=\r\n that the movie suggests \nthe rebellion were being lead in order to preserv=\r\ne tradition and \nhonor (the Emperor=B4s counselours are portraied as greedy=\r\n and \nselfish, whereas the &quot;Samurai&quot; are only honour bound). \nHowever, how =\r\nabsurd is conceiving the rebellion as a device to \nattempt return to the &quot;s=\r\ntatus quo&quot;? Certainly, the &quot;Samurai&quot;, as a \nclass, knew they would lose the=\r\nir prestige and power with the \nRestoration and the open trade (before the =\r\nEmperor, the \nTokugawa Bafuku agreed on trade terms). Would they be fightin=\r\ng \nfor their status rather by just simple plain honour?\n\nBeing the perpetua=\r\nl optimist I tent to be, I would like to think that \nthe leaders of the tim=\r\ne - from the daimyo down the chain to the \n&quot;simple&quot; samurai, had not only t=\r\nheir own interests in mind, but \nthose of their support mechanisms ie:the p=\r\nesants and \nmerchants. This was, and is not always the case, of course.\n\nEv=\r\nen the most dull of samurai should have been aware of the \ntimes - trade wa=\r\ns increasing and merchants were rising in real, \nif not &quot;official&quot; power, e=\r\nven as in modern times. Communication \nwas better than it ever was, which w=\r\nas increasing the education \nof the people.\nIn earlier days, I can see how =\r\na public that had little \ncommunication between han and city might not be a=\r\nware of the \nplight of others around their immediate surroundings.\nIt was i=\r\nn the controlling governments interest to maintain an \nimposed &quot;quarantine&quot;=\r\n so their authority could not be challenged.\nSince the movie does not actua=\r\nlly portray the actual Satsuma \nrebellion, I cringe slightly to suppose wha=\r\nt the motives for those \n&quot;samurai&quot; really could be.\n\nAny person in charge o=\r\nf a group of people might resent, to a \nsmall or large degree,when someone =\r\nor something threatens to \nremove their power. For the samurai, I believe t=\r\nhis to be so.\nThey may have had honor as a partial motive - it would seem \n=\r\ndis-honorable to be removed from a public position. They may \nhave viewed a=\r\nny particular actions they took to defend their \nincome as a necessity, and=\r\n not really saw anything wrong in \ntheir methods, so it may have not occure=\r\nd to them to try to \ncultivate some sort of middle ground between the gover=\r\nnment \nposition, and their own. \nThey tried to give it the &quot;my way or the t=\r\nokaido way...&quot; treatment.\n\nAs to the ministers and the councel being portra=\r\nyed as greedy - \nbut the Samurai position as being honor bound and nobel \ns=\r\neems to be a typical literary mechanism to buy the sympathies \nof the reade=\r\nr (or viewer...) They could not have showed the \nsamurai chastizing merchan=\r\nts and exacting tax money from \nstarving peasants in the first minutes of t=\r\nhe film and keep people \ninterested in the samurai for long. That would hav=\r\ne led to a \nrebellion right there in the theater!! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; These are just =\r\nconsiderations and questions, please do not \ntake them as offensive. I bear=\r\n deep respect for the subject at \nhand.\n\nHow can I, or anyone else take int=\r\nelligent discussion as \noffensive! I hope I did not sound that way...\n \n\nCh=\r\nristopher\n\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thiago  \n&gt; \n\n\n"
