Perhaps you might want to put a link to \n&gt;it in the Edo Period section of the Samurai Archives Citadel.\n&gt;\n&gt;Speaking of film and seppuku: I&#39;ve brought this up before. But Kobayashi&#39;s \n&gt;film SEPPUKU discussed incidents of early Edo-period ronin from disbanded \n&gt;clans coming to clan gateways to request a spot to commit seppuku. In the \n&gt;film, the main fictional character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) mention a name of a \n&gt;ronin who came to the Sengoku clan&#39;s gateway (unfortunately, the man&#39;s name \n&gt;mentioned in the film has escaped me at the moment). This ronin told the \n&gt;clan leaders that he preferred to commit seppuku rather than live on in \n&gt;endless poverty. The Sengoku clan leaders were so impressed that they made \n&gt;him a member of their clan. After that, supposedly scores of impoverished \n&gt;ronin went to clan gates with seppuku requests and the clans would give \n&gt;them &quot;go away&quot; money. Sooner or later most of these seppuku requests were \n&gt;insincere; the ronin involved wanted the money rather than actually wanting \n&gt;to commit seppuku. As many of us know, the film SEPPUKU involves a ronin \n&gt;making such a request -- with tragic consequences.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, I don&#39;t really want to discuss the film. Rather I&#39;m curious to \n&gt;know: did the incident mentioned in the film involving the Sengoku clan \n&gt;actually happen? Or did Kobayashi (and/or novelest Takaguchi) draw a \n&gt;completely fictional event with fictional names out of the hat? I wonder if \n&gt;you&#39;re planing to include this in your work.\n&gt;\n&gt;Nina aka &quot;Wave Tossed&quot; -- Moderator of the Edo Period section of the \n&gt;Samurai Archives Citadel Forum\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   _____\n&gt;\n&gt;From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;[mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 1:30 AM\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] - HOGEN INCIDENT\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for your reply... I will have to check on that film. I am always \n&gt;interested in Japanese film, especially if it is relevant to my study.\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, thanks for mentioning that study. It may help depending on the \n&gt;content. My research is actually on seppuku and the Edo Period, but, in the \n&gt;process, I am comparing several examples ranging from the war chronicles to \n&gt;Yukio Mishima. I would be happy to share my work with anyone who is \n&gt;interested once it is finished--as long as it isnt bashed too much ;)\n&gt;\n&gt;I am specifically looking for text resources other than the Hogen \n&gt;Monogatari. Hogen Monogatari only seems to cover Uno Chikahara briefly. \n&gt;This short passage contains a reference to seppuku which is believed to be \n&gt;the first in the war chronicles. I was hoping to find some information \n&gt;about this individual, but have come up empty so far.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jonathan P.

The list seems to be a little quiet at present so I&#39;ll be\n&gt;indulgent and ramble on a bit about this film, one of my favourites.\n&gt;\n&gt;A thoroughly enjoyable movie, one reviewer commenting &quot;Kinugasa&#39;s sublime\n&gt;control of color intensifies every emotion in his Academy Award�-winning\n&gt;masterpiece, a classic 12th-century tale about a warrior whose love\n&gt;dishonors a married woman. The screen is steeped in fiery reds for chaotic\n&gt;battle scenes, then blanketed in soothing images of white-kimonoed priests\n&gt;beside a calm blue sea. The exquisite compositions and charged performances\n&gt;of Kazuo Hasegawa and Machiko Kyo depict a culture dedicated to order, yet\n&gt;easily rocked by passion.&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Another reviwer\n&gt;http://www.amazon. \n&gt;&lt;http://www.amazon.com/Gate-Hell-Teinosuke-Kinugasa/dp/6303073093&gt; \n&gt;com/Gate-Hell-Teinosuke-Kinugasa/dp/6303073093 comments:\n&gt;\n&gt;In 1953, Teinosuke Kinugasa (1896-1982) directed and co-adapted the\n&gt;historical play entitled &quot;Jigokumon&quot; (English transliteration of the\n&gt;Japanese title), which was written by Kan Kikuchi (1888-1948). The film&#39;s\n&gt;name (the same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, and\n&gt;was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes place in\n&gt;12th-century Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a revolt.\n&gt;During the confusion and fear running rampant through the royal palace in\n&gt;Kyoto, a lady of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescued by a \n&gt;soldier\n&gt;named Moritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revolt fails, Moritoh\n&gt;is told that he can have anything that he wants, and what he wants is Lady\n&gt;Kesa to be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that she is already\n&gt;married to Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Rather than seek\n&gt;something different, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with Lady Kesa.\n&gt;Filmed in beautiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first color films\n&gt;from Japan), the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exquisite. The story \n&gt;is\n&gt;by no means dated, though it does become somewhat predictable. Still, it is\n&gt;both compelling and engaging and the acting is superb, especially Machiko\n&gt;Ky. Memorable scenes in the film include the confusion at the royal palace,\n&gt;Laky Kesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Moritoh meeting Lady Kesa and \n&gt;her\n&gt;aunt after the revolt, Moritoh given the choice of his heart&#39;s desire, the\n&gt;horse races, Moritoh at the home of Lady Kesa&#39;s aunt, and the ending \n&gt;scenes.\n&gt;The makeup used on Moritoh could have been better.\n&gt;\n&gt;The film won several awards including an Oscar for Best Costume Design, an\n&gt;Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the prestigious\n&gt;Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Overall, I rate &quot;Gate of\n&gt;Hell&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars. Hopefully, the film will be fully restored and\n&gt;released on DVD one day. I highly recommend the film.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;Barry Thomas.\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;\n&gt;From: &quot;jonathan ellgen&quot; &lt;jpellgen@yahoo. &lt;mailto:jpellgen%40yahoo.com&gt; com&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 9:28 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory]\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I am working on a section of my master&#39;s thesis dealing with the Hogen\n&gt; &gt;Incident.
