Thanks for the recommendations.  I&#39;d never heard of these.  I\nlook forward to them.\nAs to &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; - not only has it been released with revised\nsubtitles, it&#39;s been restored to its original release length - which had\npreviously not been shown outside of a few major Japanese cities in its\nfirst run.  A student of mine also has a DVD version that includes the\ntheatrical trailer for the film, which is pretty delightful in itself.  But\nboth of these have been out long enough that I&#39;m not sure either one is what\nyou&#39;re referring to.\n\tGereg\n   Date: Wed, 08 Dec 2004 13:43:58 -0000\n   From: &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot; &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: movie list (was new gaijin)\n\n\nA couple of other movies:\n\nAme Agaru (After the Rain) - a gentle story\n\nTwilight Samurai - another gentle story with some nice kodachi work for\nthose who recall\nprevious discussions here...\n\n... and Gohatto, more &#39;gay&#39; than &#39;gentle&#39;, again with some excellent dojo\nfencing which\ncontrasts nicely with the somewhat wild &#39;cut n slash&#39; of &#39;the real thing&#39;.\n\nThe Kurosawas are, of course, mandatory.\n\nI have heard Seven Samurai is being re-released with revised subtitling\nwhich is somewhat\nmore &#39;earthy&#39; than the 50&#39;s version. Anyone know anything about this?\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n"
