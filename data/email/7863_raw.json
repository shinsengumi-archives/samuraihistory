Some=\r\n people, including myself, brought up two films, AFTER\nTHE RAIN\n&gt; and SEPPU=\r\nKU. I remember discussing one of the characters in SEPPUKU\nwho had\n&gt; pawned=\r\n his sword blades in order to try and feed his family.\nAccording to\n&gt; some =\r\nhistorical accounts I&#39;ve read, this seemed to have happened rather\n&gt; freque=\r\nntly during the Edo period, with impoverished ronin and sometimes\n&gt; low-ran=\r\nked (low-paid) clan samurai pawning their sword blades, replacing\n&gt; them wi=\r\nth bamboo.  \n\nTo which historical accounts are you referring?  Written when=\r\n?  In\nJapanese or English?  For a popular or academic audience?  Peer\nrevie=\r\nwed (as in university and other scholarly presses)?\nAll of these (and many =\r\nmore) are the first questions one normally\nwould ask about sources quoted i=\r\nn support of any statement or\nhypothesis.  Without some idea of the sources=\r\n that you are using, a\nstatement such as &#39;some historical accounts I&#39;ve rea=\r\nd&#39; has an\nindeterminate authority and leaves me (and I suspect others) curi=\r\nous\nas to the accuracy that we can expect from the sources.\n\nThe next thing=\r\n that I would point out is that these are just movies. \nWhile I like Kurosa=\r\nwa and Tokugawa-set period pieces, I don&#39;t beleive\nanyone would put much fa=\r\nith in their historical accuracy.  That is not\nto say that the things that =\r\nmovies depict are necessarily untrue, but\nsimply that they can&#39;t be relied =\r\nupon as historical documents in the\nsame way that contemporaneous materials=\r\n can.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So with the statement cited below: can it be inferred that a\nsa=\r\nmurai&#39;s sword\n&gt; -- and keeping it -- would be more important to a samurai&#39;s=\r\n honor than\n&gt; feeding his family? That it was considered better if the samu=\r\nrai&#39;s\nfamily\n&gt; were to starve to death rather than for the samurai to ever =\r\npart\nwith his\n&gt; sword? And thus a samurai who sells his sword blades, even =\r\nto keep his\n&gt; family alive, is acting dishonorably?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina\n\nAnother thin=\r\ng to keep in mind is that the stories that come down to us\nthroug history a=\r\nnd are popularized in  books that treat the samurai\nand the concept of hono=\r\nr (among other things), often uncritically\nchoose those stories/anecdotes/l=\r\negends that support the picture of the\nsamurai that they are trying to pain=\r\nt and do a poor job at addressing\nalternative interpretations of the source=\r\ns that do exist.  I believe\nthat most of us have probably heard that a samu=\r\nrai&#39;s topknot was,\nsimilar to the sword, sacrosanct as a badge of the privi=\r\nleged class to\nwhich he belonged.  If memory serves, Kurosawa in 7 Samurai,=\r\n has one\nof the main characters cut hit hair to impersonate a priest in ord=\r\ner\nto achieve a solution to the hostage stalemate.  Who to believe, the\npop=\r\nular history books or Kurosawa...or are both depictions accurate.\n\nI have b=\r\neen reading and trying to get caught up with the threads that\nI have missed=\r\n during the last year or so, that I have been absent from\nthe list and am e=\r\nnjoying the variety of topics that have come up. \nSome of the recent thread=\r\ns in particular have piqued my curiosity, but\nit seems reasonable for us to=\r\n analyze the assumptions behind some of\nthe questions that we are asking an=\r\nd to be as clear as possible about\nthe sources that we use so that everyone=\r\n has an idea as to the\nrelative accuracy and authority of the information. =\r\n\n\nGranted that many times we don&#39;t have our references to hand when we\nare =\r\ninspired to post, but even in those cases it might be nice to\nfollow up inc=\r\nluding the citations in a later post in the thread.\n\n-Shannon \n\n\n\n\n"
