If you want to buy a TV series here =\r\nin \nJapan you must pay at a minimum $300.\n\nAlso you can run a web search fo=\r\nr Japanese Drama.\n\nGood luck!\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Totok Sudarijanto &lt;totok.sudarij=\r\nanto@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I heard that we can download the NHK taiga dramas=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; for free, is that true? If\n&gt; &gt; so, where should I go (url address)?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Possibly off of a file-sharing server like Kazaa or\n&gt; bittorrent, if you=\r\n can find it. You certainly can&#39;t\n&gt; get them for free from NHK--50 episode =\r\nTaiga dramas\n&gt; sell for around $300-$400 US dollars. \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________=\r\n__________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
