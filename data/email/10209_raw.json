As far as I know those who did own their own horse=\r\ns were allowed to use them for personal travel as they wished. As far as th=\r\ne type of horse, I do not know what they are called in technical terms, but=\r\n the horses of Sengoku period Japan were much smaller than the horses now. =\r\nThey were closer to ponies in size, they may actually be categorized as pon=\r\nies I am not sure, that were originally from the plains of central Asia. Wh=\r\nen you consider that the average height of a Japanese man at the time was s=\r\nhorter than the average height of a Japanese woman today then the thought o=\r\nf them on a modern sized race horse, like those used in yabusame today, is =\r\nkind of an amusing thought. \n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Cearb@=\r\n... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All--\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been looking into how folks got aro=\r\nund in Sengoku-era Japan, and wondered if anyone on the forum could provide=\r\n some clarity. \n&gt; \n&gt; Specifically: was travel pretty much always on foot? W=\r\nere horses reserved for military use / use as pack animals? Would a samurai=\r\n on his master&#39;s business or personal travel have ridden? (Some of the artw=\r\nork I&#39;ve seen from later ages does show both mounted samurai and walking re=\r\ntainers -- was this the exception?)\n&gt; \n&gt; And, if they did travel by horse, =\r\nwhat sort of horses would they have ridden? (A quick Google search shows me=\r\n that a lot of people on the internet are asking these questions, but relia=\r\nble answers are scarce.)\n&gt; \n&gt; As always, any assistance would be GREATLY ap=\r\npreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; --R Michael Burns \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this=\r\n message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message hav=\r\ne been removed]\n\n\n"
