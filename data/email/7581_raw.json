The reason \nthe screenwriter chose the Ii clan could have been a combination of \nseveral factors:\n1)The empty suit of armor in Hara-kiri is one of the most important \nsymbols in the film. The Ii clan red suits of armor were among the \nmost distinctive and famous in Japan, particularly Naomasa&#39;s horned \nsuit (presumably the one featured in the film) and made a perfect \ncinematic fit. It was also interesting that they chose to use the \nincorrect Ii hatch mark standard (only used in wartime, it was the \nfirst character of their name) rather than the peacetime Tachibana \n(flower) standard on the large screen in the courtyard. Thus, when \nthe screen is covered in blood from a fallen Ii retainer, the good \nname of the Ii has also been symbolically stained with blood.\n2)The Ii were renowned for their zeal and steadfastness both in \nbattle (seen when disobeying orders to be the first into battle at \nSekigahara, and using their orders to keep the besieged Osaka castle \nunder control as an excuse to bombard the castle) and in supporting \nthe Tokugawa (`the establishment&#39;). This made them perfect for being \nthe symbol of the `unfair powers that be&#39;.\n3)The Ii were accused (in the person of Ii Naosuke) of being too \nstrict and cruel in dealing with anti-government factions during the \nBakumatsu era (about 230 years after the time period Hara-kiri was \nset in). This formed the basis for the events in the film Samurai \nAssassination. Personally, I&#39;ve always felt it was a bum rap. Naosuke \nwas trying his best to bring Japan into the modern era while still \nkeeping its national identity, but the many factions pulling in \ndifferent directions made it a near impossible job. This helped to \ngive the Ii clan a `bad guy&#39; image.\nI&#39;ve always found the story of Ii Naomasa fascinating. It reads like \na movie. His father was murdered when Naomasa was a child, leaving \nhim the last of his clan. He was sheltered, protected, and brought to \nadulthood by his aunt, a Buddhist nun who assumed the leadership of \nthe clan and brooked no nonsense during his childhood (sometimes even \ndressing as a man to command the respect of those she had to deal \nwith). He became one of the `4 Pillars Of Tokugawa&#39; (in most \nreckonings) and received the wound that eventually killed him while \nengaged in battle with one of the few clans that were the martial \nequals of the Ii (the Shimazu). Interestingly enough, Tokugawa Ieyasu \nblamed that famous suit of armor for being the cause of the wound.\n\n\n\n\n"
