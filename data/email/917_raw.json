I met an artist named\nRoald Knutsen who had just produced a series of B&W prints of samurai and\nsamurai action (I bought most of the series). This was followed by a series\nof full colour prints( only bought a couple because I was earning little!!).\nImagine my surprise when I came across a site still offering them for sale!!\nThe site is fully illustrated with thumbnails and links to larger size\nsamples. Quite a few are of the desired &quot;samurai warrior on horseback and\nwearing a full armour&quot; type....\n\n\nhttp://www.georgedillon.com/kendo/samurai_prints_by_roald_knutsen.shtml\n\nHope it fits the bill....\n\n                            Rod Johnson\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;mlp1897&quot; &lt;mlp1897@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, June 28, 2002 3:18 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] SAMURAI WARRIOR\n\n\n&gt; I have been searching the web for a poster or a painting of a samurai\n&gt; warrior on horseback and wearing a full armour. There are photographs\n&gt; of these warriors in annual festivities in Japan but what I would\n&gt; like to see and have(if i can afford it) is to have this poster or\n&gt; painting.\n&gt; Paging anyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank You\n\n\n\n\n"
