However,\nif that person then refuses to accept multiple\nhistorically accurate arguements to hold on to the\n&quot;ninja can fly&quot; belief that first inspires him/her,\nthen that IS a bad thing. Clavell&#39;s Shogun is what\nstarted me, along with many others, down this path.\nBecause I like the work, I still read it about every\n18 months or so. However, I&#39;ve matured in my studying\nto realize that 90% of his story is preposterous, and\nthough thinly based on the general political situation\ncirca 1600, none of the actual STORY itself is\nanywhere near accurate, not are the details of\nlinguistics, dress, weaponry, etc. I can be inspired\nby it all I want--that doesn&#39;t mean it is correct in\nfact or detail, nor does it excuse me if I claim that\nit is. Inspiration is good-dogmatic clinging to that\ninspiration in the face of fact is bad. While you may\nthink this never happens, I assure you it does on\nabout a weekly basis. You don&#39;t see the posts I and\nKitsuno delete for sheer inanity. \n\nIt won&#39;t help them to continue learning about\n&gt; the subject if\n&gt; their every mistake is howled at, \n\nMistakes aren&#39;t howled at. Unwillingness to correct\nthem is. \n\n  Speaking\n&gt; of shrieking, I&#39;ve\n&gt; read several people on different forums howling with\n&gt; rage because\n&gt; their preferred historical source was not the same\n&gt; as someone else&#39;s.\n&gt;  How can they know which is right, and ultimately,\n&gt; does it matter?  In\n&gt; my clumsy way, that was what I was trying to get at,\n&gt; being dogmatic\n&gt; over a particular version of history to the extent\n&gt; of insulting others\n&gt; who don&#39;t agree, or prefer an alternative source.\n\nThose people you mentioned are arguing over versions\nof history, correct? In that case, I am in your\ncamp--you have to read them, compare them, compare\ntheir sources, and make a reasoned decision, but can\nyou ever know which one is correct and which one\nisn&#39;t? Perhaps--if you&#39;re Tony. Mortals like me,\nprobably not. \n\nHowever, that wasn&#39;t the issue I addressed. I\naddressed the issue of historical works versus fiction\nworks. You can point out all the issues with various\nhistorical works you wish, the simple fact is that\nhistorical works, by definition, in a historical\ncontext, have greater value FOR THE PURPOSE OF\nSEARCHING OUT HISTORICAL FACTS, then fiction works do.\nAnybody who&#39;s more inspired by Sansom&#39;s Volume I than\nby Kurosawa&#39;s Rashomon has no heart--however, Rashomon\nis a work of fiction--inspiration is the point, not\nfacts. Each accomplishes their goal admirably--and\nconfusing the two is where we run into issues. \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
