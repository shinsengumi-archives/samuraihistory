It is possible I can also\nfind someone to fund it\n\nhowever until someone who knows better (maybe yourself\nNate) then we have to make do with a little better\neach time. So far the only nina documentaries I have\nseen are on things ike dicovery and I could have\nchoked at the crap they spouted.\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n--- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\n\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; HI\n&gt; \n&gt; I love this attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; I havent seen it, I know nothing about it, so I will\n&gt; slam it as much as I can.\n\nSince when has skepticism meant &quot;slam it as much as I\ncan&quot;? I&#39;ll slam Hayes all day--I&#39;ve, to date, made 1\ncomment about the documentary. Did you produce this?\nYou&#39;re certainly defending it like you&#39;ve got a vested\ninterest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese\nhistory 101 and knows something now--but I&#39;m\nskeptical. \n\nIf the documentary isn&#39;t built around him, than\nlovely--hopefully it has some useful information. \n\n&gt; My I suggest if you already think its a load of crap\n&gt; before its been released that you go and produce\n&gt; something better.\n&gt; \n&gt; i await your future project on the ninja so we can\n&gt; all\n&gt; insult it\n\nIf you&#39;re willing to pay me to quit my job, fund the\nproject, and pay the production costs, I&#39;d be more\nthan happy to. Of course, it&#39;d be cheaper to just\ntranslate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then\nyou&#39;d take issue with my translation, I&#39;m sure. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
