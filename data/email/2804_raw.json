Everyone is usually familiar with Nagashino\n&gt; (1575) and the rotating firing system, and it is\n&gt; often\n&gt; used as an example of this before it appears in\n&gt; Europe. What most people do not realize is that this\n&gt; wasn&#39;t nearly the first such instance--just the\n&gt; largest stage for it. Rotational fire had occured as\n&gt; early as the mid 1560&#39;s for sure (Ikko-ikki) and\n&gt; Turnbull discusses it as early as 1560 in his\n&gt; Samurai\n&gt; Sourcebook. At Nagashino we see 3000 (though some\n&gt; recent scholarly debate has asserted the number was\n&gt; closer to 1000) guns used in conjunction with\n&gt; natural\n&gt; and man made obstacles (to me, the REAL genius of\n&gt; Nobunaga at Nagashino) to create the perfect defense\n&gt; against a mobile attack. That&#39;s what I meant by my\n&gt; statement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; --- Pamela Grayer &lt;m.grayer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; Can you expand on your statement that Sengoku\n&gt; period\n&gt; &gt; armies were using\n&gt; &gt; firearms &#39;to greater effect than Europeans, and on\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; much more massive\n&gt; &gt; scale&#39;?\n&gt; &gt; What are your sources?\n&gt; &gt; I agree that Japanese armies of this period were\n&gt; &gt; generally more tactically\n&gt; &gt; sophisticated than their European counterparts\n&gt; &gt; throughout this period - at\n&gt; &gt; least until the reforms of Maurice of Nassau in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Dutch Army and the\n&gt; &gt; (slightly later) reforms of Gustavas Adolphus of\n&gt; &gt; Sweden.\n&gt; &gt; Where the Europeans appear to have developed a\n&gt; &gt; definite advantage is in the\n&gt; &gt; use of siege artillery, naval technology and naval\n&gt; &gt; artillery. Gustavus\n&gt; &gt; Adolphus also used lighter, small-calibre field\n&gt; guns\n&gt; &gt; to give his infantry\n&gt; &gt; added firepower.\n&gt; &gt; Michael\n&gt; &gt; BAJS; Asiatic Society of Japan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Nate Ledbetter&quot; &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 09, 2003 3:59 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Samura battle\n&gt; tactics\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai Sourcebook&quot; has some decent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; diagrams for the more common formations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As for any idiot who thinks Europeans were\n&gt; vastly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; superior to the Japanese on the battlefield,\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been filled with too much of the stupid Edo\n&gt; period\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dueling crap that so many samurai geeks are. By\n&gt; &gt; 1575\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Japanese were using firearms on the\n&gt; &gt; battlefield to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; greater effect than Europeans, and on a much\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; massive scale. The only reason Europeans\n&gt; surpassed\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Japanese by the time the two civilizations\n&gt; &gt; re-engaged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the 1800&#39;s is that the Japanese had 200 years\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; peace, no warfare, so no reason to adapt and\n&gt; &gt; change\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the way they did things. ONce they saw that\n&gt; need,\n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did, and defeated a major European power shortly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thereafter (1904-05, Russia).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- CRAZ &lt;crazoftheages@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not deeply versed on the subject of\n&gt; specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formations and the like, but I do know I have\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jpg&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  warfare spoken of in such a negative fashion\n&gt; &gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; days.  It used to be left at &quot;the Japanese\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specialized and better at personal combat\n&gt; &gt; whereas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Europeans were better at keeping order and\n&gt; mass\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combat&quot;, but even that is being challenged\n&gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; days\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by people who insist in the superiorty of\n&gt; &gt; European\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fencing, unarmed combat and actually have the\n&gt; &gt; gull\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compare the european sword to the katana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could rant on, but I&#39;ll do that some other\n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; New Yahoo!
