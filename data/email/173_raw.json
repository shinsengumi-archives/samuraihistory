Its decline was accelerated when the\ngovernment drop the Taiho military system (conscription) and privatised\nmilitary responsibilties to the various clans.\n\nPacification of the Ainu (or Emishi) peoples occurred around 800&#39;s and was\ncomplete by 811. The Emishi of Dewa & Mutsu revolted numerous times over\nthe next 100 years mainly due to famine or economic hardship. All this\noccured in the middle Hein period  before samurai came of age. The use of\nthe oyumi is not recorded after 900 as far as I know.\n\nScott Nicholas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfifthchamber@... on 21 April, 2001 07:47:42 PM\n\nPlease respond to samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n\nTo:   samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\ncc:\n\nSubject:  [samuraihistory] Introductions...\n\n\n\n\nHello all..\n My name is Ben Sharples and I am a student in London, England. I\nhave been fascinated by Samurai history since the age of 8 and have\nbuilt a collection of books and information on Japanese history, But\nI have not as yet managed to visit Japan..\n My question is; I recently read that prior to the Kamakura era\n(around 900-1000ad) the early Samurai clans fought wars against the\nAinu (presumably) and that a weapon used was a primitive design of\nCrossbow.. Does anyone know why this method fell into disuse by the\ntime of the Gempei wars and was replaced by the Longbow?\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
