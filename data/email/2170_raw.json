And of course they are going to\nmuck it up, because accuracy and reality doesn&#39;t sell\nin movies. The American public would rather see Tom\nCruise run around in gusoku, and be fed trite BS about\nbushido, etc., romanticising this rather than treating\nit with any degree of objective reality. I will go and\nwatch, hoping I&#39;m wrong, but expecting that I&#39;ll spend\nmore time noticing incorrect details than appreciating\nanything in the movie.\n\nNate\n\n--- Burker1@... wrote:\n&gt; Spoken like a true wargamer/masochist.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 8/28/03 3:54:53 PM,\n&gt; ltdomer98@... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt; Agreed....I think it will be painful. Horribly\n&gt; Wrong.\n&gt; And that&#39;s on top of how I feel about Tom Cruise in\n&gt; general. It will be the pain of Shogun (the\n&gt; translations, the Edo-jidai uniform kimono, the\n&gt; silliness of the whole love story) on a much grander\n&gt; scale. It will hurt. It will kill me.
