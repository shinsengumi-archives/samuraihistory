Hollywood \nmakes entertainment and history has a tendency to be boringly \ncomplex, so accuracy and authenticity often gets lost on the way to \nthe multiplex. \nSome Hollywood filmmakers, however, are trying harder to get it \nright. One is Edward Zwick -- the director of &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Legends of \nthe Fall&quot; and, as I learned by e-mail from Zwick himself in June \n2002, &quot;The Last Samurai.&quot; Zwick said he needed people in Japan -- \nincluding me -- to help him with the Japanese dialogue and the \nhistorical details. In short, to get as much as right as possible \nwithout sacrificing the drama. \nHe admitted to heavily fictionalizing the real-life rebellion, led by \nSaigo Takamori, that inspired the film. &quot;I know full well that [the \nrebels] took up modern arms to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate, and \nthat I&#39;ve fudged the dates of conscription and the edicts,&quot; he \nwrote. &quot;What I need is for you to highlight those descriptions, \ninteractions, issues that will evoke giggles, if not outrage, from \nthe Japanese audience.&quot; \nThis, he added was not just a commercial consideration, but &quot;a \npersonal and artistic one.&quot; &quot;I honestly believe,&quot; he continued, &quot;(and \nthis is, perhaps, the greatest hubris of all) that I can present \nrounded, complex, heroic Japanese characters to an international \naudience; that 16-year-olds everywhere might just come away with an \nawakened sense that our history and that of Japan were intertwined \nlong before Pearl Harbor; that words like honor and duty have \nresonance throughout history; and that the birth of the modern and \nsuch wrenching transitional moments have resonance and application to \nour present circumstance.&quot; \nHow could I not sign on? My first job was to send Zwick notes on the \nscript. I picked a few nits, found a few howlers. One of the \ncharacters, a young samurai, was called Yoritomo, the name of a \nfamous 12th-century warrior and statesman. It was, I wrote Zwick, \nlike calling a character in a 19th-century British period drama &quot;the \nSheriff of Nottingham.&quot; \nZwick ditched the name. He also accepted several other of my \nsuggestions, such as changing the martial art the samurai practice \nfrom karate -- which was then known only in Okinawa -- to jujitsu. \nSeveral others, however, he passed over in silence. In one scene, the \nrebel leader flings his sword end-over-end at an enemy. Couldn&#39;t \nhappen, I said -- samurai weren&#39;t knife throwers. But Zwick liked the \nimage -- and it stayed in. \nMore importantly, I found him a Japanese scriptwriter who could \nrewrite the Japanese-language script -- a direct translation from the \nEnglish that Zwick admitted was &quot;horrible.&quot; Yo Takeyama is a period-\ndrama veteran whose credits included the hit NHK drama &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; \nand the Kon Ichikawa film &quot;Ka-chan.&quot; Meeting several times during the \nsummer at a Tokyo ryokan, we went over the script line by line. I had \nto make sure Takeyama&#39;s rewrites were reflected accurately in the \nEnglish script. In several scenes, he not only corrected the \nJapanese, but added new dialogue, all of which had to be translated. \nWe also met with Zwick once in Tokyo. Late for our appointment in the \nlobby of the Imperial Hotel, I spotted a short, bearded, dark-haired \nman eyeing me through the crowd, rushed over to him and starting \napologizing in Japanese. \nIt was Zwick. In my panic I had taken him for a vaguely Japanese-\nlooking assistant -- but he loved being mistaken for one of the \nnatives. He also hit it off with Takeyama, a tall, lanky former actor \nwho is an engaging raconteur and had the answers to his questions \nabout Meiji court etiquette. \nEarly in September, Takeyama and I sent off our final batch of \ncorrections. That October, we went to see the final day of shooting \nin Japan, which took place at a temple in Kyoto. When I got to the \nset, at around 7 in the morning, Zwick was preparing a simple scene --\n Tom Cruise walking up the temple steps with two foreign companions. \nBeaming, he introduced me to his star, who was being frantically \nfussed over by three women -- one in charge of his Army officer \ncostume, the other his makeup, the other his hair. \nI had the odd feeling of stepping out of sleepy, early morning Japan \nand into a hyper-charged Hollywood moment. I noticed that Cruise had \ntiny crow&#39;s feet around his eyes, wore a retainer on his teeth and \nwas looking straight at me with that trademark burning gaze. No \nsurprise there; I had never expected Cruise to be laid back. I was \neven ready for the retainer, having read about it on an Internet \ngossip column. \nWhat shocked me, first, however, was his height -- I had thought it \nwas about the same as mine. I later realized that his boots had made \nhim stood several centimeters taller. \nSecond, he really wanted to talk, asking me where I was from, how \nlong I had been in Japan, and how I liked Tokyo. He was trying to put \nme at ease, but a normal conversation with Tom Cruise was my idea of \nthe bizarre. Also, I had my own questions -- but it wasn&#39;t the time \nor place to ask about Nicole. \nThat brief encounter, and a check, were two of my big rewards for \nbeing what Warner Brothers called a &quot;Japanese script liaison.&quot; I also \ngot several later revisions of our own revisions, considerately \nforwarded to me by Zwick&#39;s company, Samurai Pictures. \nAt least one of my ideas made it into the final version, as I \nrecently saw at screening for the press: Samurai practicing jujitsu \nin the tall grass. In Hollywood, scriptwriters commonly get rewritten \nout of existence -- I felt lucky to have, in some small way, \nsurvived. \nBut will they spell my name right in the credits?\n\n\n\n"
