I am not \n&gt; saying they were less honorable.  But the ideal of going off and \n&gt; killing all the bad muslim people (just a statement of the feeling \nof \n&gt; the time of the knights, I have nothing against muslims as a group) \n&gt; for the glory of god and holy mother church or you will burn in \nhell \n&gt; for all eternity does not seem any more honorable.  Just my 2 cents.\n\n\nThere is a book comparing bushido with chivalry:\n&quot;A Comparison of Bushi-Do and Chivalry&quot;\nby Takeshi Takagi\ntranslated by Tsuneyoshi Matsuno\nThis book was written in 1914, but the translation was published 1984 \nin Osaka: TM International Academy.\n\nRegards,\nMax\n\n\n\n\n"
