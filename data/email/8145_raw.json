We want to=\r\n know the actual involvment of peseants/baggage \nhandlers porters etc that =\r\naccompanied the samurai in battles of this \nperiod. We have two trains of t=\r\nhought that these were enrolled in the \narmies and fought along with the as=\r\nhigaru units.  The other that they \nwere a non combative role and remained =\r\nin the rear even though \ntechnically they may have been armed with some wea=\r\npons etc.\n\nAny ideas or responses would be appreciated.\n\nAndrew Collyer\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"
