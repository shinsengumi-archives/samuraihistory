Second was Toyoshima \n&gt; &gt; Nobumitsu in\n&gt; &gt; 1628. Third was Mizuno Ihei in 1670. Fourth was the famous \n&gt; &gt; assassination of\n&gt; &gt; Hotta Masatoshi by Inaba Masayasu. The exact details can be \nfound in \n&gt; &gt; Bito\n&gt; &gt; article pages 154-155 in Monumenta Nipponica 58:2.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aw ok... for a few hours you had me think Dr. Varley was WRONG... \n&gt; hehehe. However, there was another episode of vendetta of \na &quot;lord:&quot; it \n&gt; was actually a lady in waiting who avenged the noble woman she was \n&gt; working for - I don&#39;t have any detail, but I&#39;m positive I&#39;ve read \nabout \n&gt; it. So, it&#39;s 2 out of 200 cases...\n&gt; \n&gt; I can access Monumenta Nipponica Online and download articles on \nPDF \n&gt; (guys let me know if you need something), but... only until 1998. \nDoes \n&gt; anybody know if the last years are online as well?? Or can anybody \n&gt; post/scan...?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; cepo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
