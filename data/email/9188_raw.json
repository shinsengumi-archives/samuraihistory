Secondly: I&#39;m not one of the \nexperts of this list, so don&#39;t take anything I write here too serious, \nthose things are just assumptions.\nWhat about the game of &#39;go&#39;? I think it is of Chinese originese, does it \nin some way fit together with &#39;shogi&#39;?\nJust a thought, but I&#39;d be grateful for a good answer, too.\n\nCheers\nThomas\n\nTom wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Since Japan&#39;s samurai class was a social class with many different \n&gt;&gt; levels, entertainment varied but associating poetry or writing with being a sissy is a silly modern American thought. Lord Byron has a \n&gt;&gt; statue in Greece erected to him not because he was a great poet but because he helped liberate Greece from the Turks. Musashi wrote books and was an excellent painter. Etc. Etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt;\n&gt; First, I don&#39;t remember saying it was sissy.  I said it contrasted.  \n&gt; Second, I don&#39;t recall Julius Ceasar&#39;s &quot;Ode to a Summer Morning&quot; or \n&gt; Richard the Lionheart&#39;s &quot;Study of Roses.&quot;  The point I&#39;m making, it shows duality but not all warrior cultures highly prize artistic expression, especially among the warriors.  Lastly, samurais were warriors.  Japan, of this time, was under a feudal system.  In a feudal society, warriors always maintain the highest rung in society.  With that said, I asked what was their choice of entertainment.  Within that, I mentioned training and the playing of shogi.  Those can&#39;t be the only examples of war like entertainment.  \n&gt; Unlike Rome, the samurai, in particualr before the edo period, \n&gt; prepared for war constantly and were measured more by prowess in \n&gt; combat.  Yet, they didn&#39;t relish in bloodshed as much as their Roman counterparts.  There has to be some other examples.  Drinking, womanizing, and gambling: I don&#39;t view these as war like entertainment because all males participate.  I&#39;m sure wealth merchants endulged as much if not more then the samurai.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nDer fr�he Vogel f�ngt den Wurm.
