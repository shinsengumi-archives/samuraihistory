I&#39;ve \nnoticed that the earliest swords were straight but later ones up to \npreMeijei period were curved. Someone once told me (now I&#39;m not gonna&#39; \nsay who in case they&#39;re wrong) that the tachi were curved due to the \nfolding and cooling process. So actually the curving was supposed to a \nfluke or something, that&#39;s what I was told, it&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying.\n\nWhat do you guys think. Can anybody verify this or is it just bunk?\n\nThanks,\nRod\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
