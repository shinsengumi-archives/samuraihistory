What I meant to say is basically what you underlined:  \nVarley&#39;s book is a great book on the characterization of the Samurai,  \nas it emerges from their wartales.

Even a\n&gt; cursory reading of the text will provide one will the sense that there  \n&gt; is\n&gt; something formulaic to the descriptions of both the warriors&#39;  \n&gt; appearance\n&gt; and many of the encounters. \n&gt;\n&gt; Having personally not read them I cannot speak for the other war  \n&gt; tales, but\n&gt; my understanding is that most (if not all) of them, too, were oral\n&gt; presentations and meant as entertainment.  Although I look forward to\n&gt; reading Varley&#39;s work, I remain skeptical that any book can claim that  \n&gt; that\n&gt; represented in the war tales can be taken to be as you say &quot;what the  \n&gt; real\n&gt; character of the Japanese warriors was&quot;.  More likely the tales  \n&gt; represent\n&gt; the way in which the warriors wanted the other strata of society to  \n&gt; view\n&gt; them, or simply an aggrandizement for dramatic effect in the same way  \n&gt; that\n&gt; we see now police &quot;buddy movies&quot; in which the characters are larger  \n&gt; than\n&gt; life, possess a moral rectitude that defies the corrupt system  \n&gt; surrounding\n&gt; them, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; We must remember that these are monogatari, &quot;tales&quot;, and not meant to  \n&gt; be\n&gt; taken as historically accurate treatises.  Had that been their purpose  \n&gt; they\n&gt; would have been named &quot;ki&quot; or &quot;kagami.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Shannon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; S.
