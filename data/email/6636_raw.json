Tom has already replied \nwith \n&gt; a terrific and informative message. Btw Tom, what&#39;s the reference \nfor \n&gt; the story about Hisamitsu and his silver pipe? Is that in the \nYates \n&gt; biography? I don&#39;t own it and I&#39;m not going into the uni library \nfor a \n&gt; couple of weeks so can&#39;t check up on it.\n&gt; Thanks, but I&#39;m just an amateur who&#39;s fascinated by bakumatsu \n&gt; history, especially the complex relationships between the shishi \nand \n&gt; the han authorities - I know more about Choushuu than Satsuma \n&gt; though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck with your thesis\n&gt; \n&gt; Gillian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
