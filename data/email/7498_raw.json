According\nto some sources he died fighting at Nagashino (as far\nas I remember Turbull&#39;s Sourcebook implies this as do\nother sites and I&#39;m pretty sure he dies there is\nKurosawa&#39;s Kagemusha) however according to the Samurai\narchives he dies when captured by Nobunaga&#39;s troops in\n1852.\n\nI&#39;m hope this isn&#39;t just a splip up or a mis-read from\nme. Thanks for your help.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
