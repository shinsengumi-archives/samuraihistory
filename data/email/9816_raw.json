They said SENGOKU JIDAI, War Days, Turbulent ages=\r\n.\nAmong so many kings of warriors, they used to have Great Two.\nTakeda Shin=\r\ngen versus Uesugi Kensin.\nGreat two used to make wars , 16 times.\nAfter tho=\r\nse those big two were dead, Oda Nobunaga came up and\nthrough conjective war=\r\ns agains other kings of warriors, he came to\nruin all most all Japan . Afte=\r\nr he was killed by his\nsobordinate , named Akechi Mitsuhide just a few days=\r\n before he is\ngoing to Emperor palace to get SHogun status who can have pow=\r\ner to\ncontrol all kings of warriors under government, Toyotomi Hideyoshi\nwh=\r\no was another subordinate of Oda ,killed Akechi Mistsuhide and\nruined all J=\r\napan. He could not become Shogun even he ruined\ncompletely due to the facts=\r\n his ancestor was farmers.\nDuring his ruin, he tried to conquer Korea and i=\r\nnvaded several\ntimes for nothing. He failed and waisted man powers and fina=\r\nncial\nthings. After he died, Tokugawa Ieyasu came up and succeeded\nHideyosi=\r\n and became SHOGUN under the official nomination by\nEmperor because his anc=\r\nestors were Genji group which were the\ndescendants of Emperor Seiwa. He org=\r\nanized new Bakufu ,\nGovernment in Edo and was succeeded by 25 generations f=\r\nor almost\n300 years.\n\nDo you have any question ?\nPlease feel free to ask me=\r\n .\n\nEddie Hiramoto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Dowling=\r\n &lt;vaevictis@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi their history fans!\n&gt;  \n&gt; While I have b=\r\neen a member of this group for a few months now, I \nhave been unable to fin=\r\nd the time to express why I have found the \neurge to join this band of brot=\r\nhers. Well chaps, allow me to reveal \nmy purpose like a shoji door. Next ye=\r\nar (Sept 09), I plan to begin \nmy Phd at the University of Bristol where I =\r\nhave recieved a BA and \nan MA in Ancient History. My Phd will be a comparis=\r\non between the \nwarriors of Homer&#39;s Iliad (Troy etc the ancient history par=\r\nt) and \nthe warriors of 16th century Japan.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Here are a few area&#39;s im =\r\nparticularly interested by with this \nstudy:\n&gt; \n&gt; Divine weapons, and there=\r\n properties which affect/alter/enhance \nthe bearer\n&gt; The interaction/ inter=\r\nferance of gods. spirits, Kami etc to \nwarriors\n&gt; Glory, shame and honour i=\r\nn both cultures\n&gt; Warrior Cultures in general\n&gt; Who commands who? The Gener=\r\nal&#39;s or the famous warriors?\n&gt;  \n&gt; If anyone knows of any good points, or w=\r\nould like to offer \ndifferent suggestions of comparison of these cultures, =\r\nor feel any \nother knowledge could help in this investigation, that would b=\r\ne a \ngrand help.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks (domo arigato)\n&gt; Tom \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ___=\r\n______________________________________________________________\n&gt; Make a min=\r\ni you and download it into Windows Live Messenger\n&gt; http://clk.atdmt.com/UK=\r\nM/go/111354029/direct/01/\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been=\r\n removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
