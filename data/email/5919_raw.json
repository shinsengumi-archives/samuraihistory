R. Williams&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am sending this to multiple lists so I appologize in advance for any \n&gt; multiple posts. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have recently commissioned a friend of mine who is a Shodou student to \n&gt; do some Kanji work for me. However, she does not know how to construct the \n&gt; scrolls once the work has been done on the rice paper. Does anyone on here \n&gt; know how to properly construct a scroll? Any assistance that you can offer \n&gt; will be muchly appreciated. \n\nI&#39;ve only made one, it was not a great job. That was no fault of the teacher who was an expert. It&#39;s not something you will probably get right the first time. You can get them mounted in the US probably for $100-200 each. So if the work is valuable or a gift you probably want to pay a pro or practice several times with it before mounting them. I&#39;m away from my books for a few days so I can&#39;t give really good references now. Some stores listed here though:\n\nhttp://home.comcast.net/~ronin_engineer/sumi.html\n\nI&#39;m also experimenting with unconventional mounting methods that use iron activated interfacing material found in fabric stores. It&#39;s a lot less messy and tedious than the conventional wet mounting methods and irons are used in traditional Japanese bookmaking so it might last a while. I have not developed the procedure fully yet.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
