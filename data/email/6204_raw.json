I have no doubt at all that the smiths of\nToledo in Spain are still forging fine blades, as they have been doing for\nhundreds of years... and I also do not doubt that some of them are\nsimultaneously turning out pieces of wall-hanger pot-metal for tourists&#39;\nwalls.  All the same, I&#39;d hate to see anyone&#39;s opinion of Toledo blades,\nwhich can be very fine indeed, shaped by this fairly standard selection of\npop-steel.  Feel free to contact me off-list if you&#39;d like a few better\nplaces to look.\nAnd on the other hand, anyone who has contact information for any of the\nsmiths of Toledo, please feel free to contact me also.\nGereg\n\nMessage: 8\n   Date: Thu, 09 Dec 2004 10:19:15 -0000\n   From: &quot;Dodu Gabriel&quot; &lt;dodu_gabriel@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Japan Eras\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter\n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Were you interested, we do have a few sword experts\n&gt; (I&#39;m not one of them). Swords can be cool as long as\n&gt; you don&#39;t get all freaky.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nate\n&gt;\n Thank you, Nate, I am interested in swords, can&#39;t say that I&#39;m not.\nI don&#39;t know much, so an expert&#39;s opinion would be most welcome. I\nlike the www.toledoswords.com site, mostly because it&#39;s one of the\nfew I have visited (so I only know about their opinion). Is it ok?\n Oh, and don&#39;t be afraid, as I have no intention on getting freaky, I\njust like to learn about the historical events that have taken place\nthroughout the world, and in that matter the Discovery Channel has\nbeen of great help ;)\n I am also very interested in sailships, but that does not make the\nobject of this forum, so sorry I&#39;ve mentioned it.\n\n Respectfully,\n\n Gabriel\n\n\n\n\n\n"
