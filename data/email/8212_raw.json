I believe hakamas were used=\r\n during duels thus adding more difficulty. Obviously on the battlefield thi=\r\ns would have been a detriment but in a situation like a duel it would have =\r\nbeen more proper. \nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n  --- ROD PA=\r\nVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; The hakama was designed to hide the foot=\r\n movements\n&gt; of the samurai so that an opponent could not see\n&gt; them and pr=\r\nedict the outcome of an attack so easily.\n&gt; That is all I know of their sty=\r\nle choice it was more\n&gt; practical than aesthetic.\n\nRod, where did you get t=\r\nhis from? I&#39;m a little\nskeptical--it sounds like something out of Martial\nA=\r\nrts Illustrated or something. Most images of samurai\nyou see preparing for =\r\na battle or a duel have their\nhakama tied back with leggings to keep them o=\r\nut of the\nway (assuming they aren&#39;t in armor, which would keep\nthe clothing=\r\n out of the way by definition.) Kobakama,\nor shorter, tighter hakama, were =\r\nfrequently worn when\n&quot;expecting action&quot;. \n\nWere hakama worn exclusively by =\r\nthe samurai class,\nthen maybe I could see your answer making sense. But\nhow=\r\n would that explain nagabakama, worn by courtiers\nand samurai during court =\r\nfunctions? I&#39;m no clothing\nhistorian, but I know we&#39;ve got some here. Tony?=\r\n Lady\nSolveig? Care to enlighten us further? \n\nOf course, I could just look=\r\n at Tony&#39;s website: \n\nhttp://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html\n\n&quot;Hakama =\r\nworn by commoners and laborers in Heian were\ntwo panel, and typically only =\r\nreached to the mid-calf\nor a bit lower. During the sixteenth century,\nlow-c=\r\nlass warriors often wore a knee-length two- or\nthree-panel hakama which wer=\r\ne sometimes called\nkobakama, a terminology problem as regular hakama were\na=\r\nlso called kobakama in the Edo period owing to the\nformal nagabakama being =\r\nthe =93formal=94 norm.&quot;\n\nIf hakama were being worn by commoners and laborer=\r\ns,\nthen I hardly think a critical part of their design\nwould be to hide the=\r\n movement of the legs from an\nopponent. \n\nContinuing: \n\n&quot;Earlier hakama, un=\r\nlike modern martial arts hakama,\nhad two clearly defined legs, rather than =\r\nhaving the\npleats overlapping left and right so that one can=92t\ntell where=\r\n one leg ends and the other begins. Another\nmodern feature is the koshita, =\r\nthe solid panel at the\nsmall of the back. This seems to have appeared\nsomet=\r\nime in the early Edo period or at the earliest in\nthe very late days of the=\r\n sixteenth century, as\nearlier hakama were merely cut straight across the\nb=\r\nack as at the front.&quot;\n\nIf these things were developed in the Edo period, an=\r\nd\nhakama were being worn in the Heian period, then they\ncould hardly be par=\r\nt of the development of hakama. \n\nI&#39;d still like to see what Tony and other=\r\ns have to\nsay. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You =\r\nYahoo!?\nTired of spam?
