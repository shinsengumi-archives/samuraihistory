No argument that some swords\nare better than others, now or then.  It&#39;s curious how many people with\nexpensive swords, however, seem to be of the opinion that the quality of the\nsteel decides the fight, rather than the quality of the combatants&#39; skills.\nUnbeatable steel does not make an unbeatable fighter.  Only when there is a\ntremendous disparity between the two blades does that become a significant\nfactor.  So the incident as related, I think, can be better understood in\nthe context of these social and martial attitudes than in the context of\ncomparative blade quality.\nThomas, I browse through that book, but I&#39;ve not read that excerpt before.\nMany thinks.  (Hmm.  That was meant to be &#39;thanks&#39;, but both are accurate\nenough, so I&#39;ll leave the typo.)\n\tGereg\n\nMessage: 1\n   Date: Sun, 12 Dec 2004 12:17:23 -0800\n   From: Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: On naming swords\n\nI agree with you that named swords probably most often got their names from\nan incident involving the sword, but some swords were in fact superior in\nquality to others. Swords were in fact tested on corpses and ranked by how\nwell they cut, the results of the test was sometimes inscribed on the tang\nof the blade. http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/sharp.htm\n\nDave\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: Thomas Davidson\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Saturday, December 11, 2004 3:56 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] On naming swords\n\n\n\n  There is an excerpt from &#39;My Father&#39; by Arai Hasuseki, in Legends of\n  the Samurai&#39; and it relates a story:\n\n  Hasuseki&#39;s father Masanori, lived from 1601-82,  &#39;not far removed\n  from the Sengoku Jidai&#39;, as his son describes it.\n\n  &#39;You should never say ... that you carry a sharp blade ... someone\n  heard someone else say his sword cuts exceptionally well, so said\n  &quot;By Heaven, you act rudely as if no-one else was around you.\n  Do you suppose anyone would carry a sword that does not cut?\n  Come on, man, see for yourself whether my sword cuts or not!&quot;\n  and drew his sword.&#39;\n\n  Apparently, bystanders intervened before blood was spilt.\n\n  It would appear from other details related to named swords, here and\n  elsewhere, that names usually derived from an incident to do with\n  the sword, rather than from any inherent quality of the blade.\n\n  The risk in attributing qualities to the sword itself implies that\n  other swords lack that quality, or rather this sword is superior\n  in that quality to all others, and thus an insult to the owner,\n  and an invitation to a duel.\n\n  They were touchy chaps, in those days.\n\n  Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
