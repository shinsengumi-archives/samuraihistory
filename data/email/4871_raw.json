But are these modern\nkohaze derived from a period version?\n\nWhen did the rear split style of tabi and their related kohaze first\nappear?\n\nWhat sorts of materials where used to make the early kohaze?\n\nI personally haven&#39;t found any information earlier than 1906, when they\nwere being mass produced, probably in copper, by a Japanese company, who\nsay that their design was based upon a style formally made by hand by\nskilled craftsman, which at least pushes them back in to the 19th\ncentury. \n\nAll the modern ones I&#39;ve seen are of aluminium, often plated in nickel,\nand on occasion in brass. I&#39;ve seen very large bone ones for book\nbindings on the net, but so far, nothing else apart from these modern\nvarieties.\n\nAlthough I&#39;ve been informed that such a device was used on a kind of Edo\nperiod &quot;spat&quot; called a kougake, probably some form of kiahan like\ngarment (leggings), apparently illustrated on &quot;page 281 of Edo Fukushoku\nShi. (History of Edo Costume)&quot;, a work that I do not as yet have access\nto. Many modern kiahan made for martial arts practitioners have kohaze\nmounted on elastic to achieve a good fit, possibly a hang over of this\nearlier garment.\n\nConfession: I am trying to arrange the reproduction of these items for a\nmomoyama-jidai living history/role playing project, and if it were\npossible to simply replace the aluminium kohaze of modern tabi with a\ncorrect fitting, this would be much easier than having to make tabi from\nabsolute scratch. Especially as I can now get hold of tabi in\ntraditionally patterned cloth, rather than just plain dark blue and\nwhite.\n\nOkay, that&#39;s it, any input would be most appreciated.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n\n\n"
