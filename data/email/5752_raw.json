Refrain from calling anyone an asshole,\nplease--especially one who has the power of whether or\nnot you can post to this list. The only reason I&#39;m\nletting you by is because you referred to me--had you\ncalled anyone else a &quot;cynical asshole&quot;, I&#39;d\nimmediately ban you from the list. Since you directed\nit at me, you get a second chance. \n\n2. Just because something started IN the Edo period,\ndoesn&#39;t mean it began in the same year the period\nbegan. \n\nTry here:\nhttp://geisya.cutegirl.jp/geisyanorekisi.html\n\nFirst thing on the page says at the &quot;END&quot; of the Edo\nperiod. This is the first webpage that came up in my\ngoogle search. \n\nIn case you can&#39;t read Japanese, here&#39;s another: \n\nhttp://oldworld.sjsu.edu/asiangate/floating_world/geishah.html\n\nThis pins it at 1770, though I&#39;m not sure it could be\nthat exact. However it perfectly explains the\ndifference between &quot;Geisha&quot; (�|�ҁj&quot;art persons&quot;, and\n&quot;Yujo&quot;, prostitutes. \n\n3. It&#39;s no one&#39;s &quot;JOB&quot; to help you. And if you&#39;ll shut\nyour trap and read, you&#39;ll see I was TRYING too--YOU\nNEED TO GIVE US MORE DETAILS THAN THIS. Chances are\nsomeone here can find your samurai, if you have more\ninformation. Telling me he was involved in Sekigahara\ndoesn&#39;t mean squat--there were over 100,000 samurai\ninvolved in Sekigahara, not counting multiple\nside-battles. Telling me he deserted his lord because\nhe was in love with a Geisha tells me squat, because\nyou are using the term incorrectly. GEISHA were a mid\nto late Edo period development. In 1600, the Edo\nperiod BEGAN. ERGO, He couldn&#39;t have been in love with\na geisha. Courtesan, yes. Geisha, no. \n\n4. If you get pissed off everytime someone says this\nsounds like something out of a bad romance novel,\nyou&#39;re going to be in for a lot of anger management\nsessions. Perhaps I should have said &quot;out of a bad\nChikamatsu play&quot; or &quot;Ihara Saikaku&quot; novel. Would that\nhave bruised your ego less? \n\nLISTEN UP, EVERYONE: I&#39;VE HAD IT! If you&#39;re going to\ntake anything said to you personally when you ask a\nquestion with no clarifying information and incorrect\nbackground, then don&#39;t ask the question! This is an\nemail list meant to perpetuate a flow of information\nand KNOWLEDGE! If what you think you know is WRONG,\nsomeone will tell you. DEAL WITH IT! I&#39;ve been wrong,\nKitsuno&#39;s been wrong, Tony&#39;s been wrong...sometime, I\nthink, in 1999...point is, people who study this stuff\nfor a living make mistakes too--therefore, if it is\nyour first time here, DO NOT get bent out of shape,\nokay? \n\nNo one is &quot;yuk(king) it up&quot;. And the only thing\nstanding in your way is your lack of any identifiable\ndetails that can allow others to help identify this\nperson. \n\n���̗͂ł���΂�܂��I\n\n�l�C�g\n\n\n--- &quot;Tenshi, Rose, and Toni&quot;\n&lt;madmadotakuchick@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     Yuk it up. Go ahead and poke fun of the &quot;Bad\n&gt; Romance Novel&quot; \n&gt; story. The art of geishas dates back to 1600 (Edo,\n&gt; Just after \n&gt; Sekigahara), and there were DEFINITLY (whores. I&#39;ve\n&gt; the good \n&gt; consience not to call them such, because msot didn&#39;t\n&gt; want the \n&gt; lifestyle, but got into it to survive.) I&#39;ve\n&gt; irrefutable proof of \n&gt; this story being a real one and I&#39;ll be damned if a\n&gt; cynical asshole \n&gt; like you messes with me. You can help me or you can\n&gt; stay out of my \n&gt; way. What will it be? e_e\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n"
