In fact, the sense of history can be \nalmost overwhelming-with enactments of the samurai period associated \nwith Ieyasu (1542-1616) and the shogunate set up in his family name. \n\nThe remains of the founder of Edo, modern Tokyo, are enshrined at \nToshogu, which every year organizes spectacular parades re-enacting \nrites of old Japan. \n\nThis tops the list of must-see events. The climax comes when more \nthan 1,000 local people in period costume parade down avenues graced \nwith huge pine trees. As many as 53 groups are represented, including \nfully armored warriors from the days of old, as well as shrine \nmaidens and others dressed as lions to guard against evil. \n\nIt is called Sennin Musha Gyoretsu, literally procession of 1,000 \nwarriors. It is said to re-enact a procession in 1617 when Ieyasu&#39;s \nfollowers transported his remains to the newly built Nikko shrine \nfrom the Kunozan mountain in Shizuoka Prefecture, where they had been \ntemporarily enshrined. \n\nAt the head of the procession is a portable shrine that is said to \nhonor Ieyasu&#39;s spirit. The procession makes its way from the shrine \ndown a narrow street for about 1 kilometer and then heads back. \n\nAnother day trip out of Tokyo that features warriors is the \nTsurugaoka Hachimangu shrine&#39;s Reitaisai festival in the old capital \nof Kamakura in Kanagawa Prefecture. \n\nThis is really something. It features yabusame, where mounted archers \nfire arrows at three stationary targets while riding at full gallop \nalong a fenced-off 254-meter narrow strip of dirt. \n\nBe warned, the crowds will be huge. \n\nIt is said this ritual was initiated by Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147-\n1199), founder of the Kamakura Shogunate (1192-1333), in hopes to \nbringing lasting peace to the warring states. \n\nHistorical figures such as the warlord Minamoto no Yoshitsune (1159-\n1189) are also featured in the summer and autumn festivals of Sawara, \nChiba Prefecture. \n\nThey feature elaborately decorated floats with 4-meter dolls of \nfigures from Japan&#39;s ancient past. The dolls, each representing one \nof 14 local communities, are paraded around the city, which is noted \nfor its buildings dating from the Edo Period (1603-1867). \n\n* * * \n\n*The Sennin Musha Gyoretsu is held Oct. 16-17 at the Nikko Toshogu \nshrine in Nikko, Tochigi Prefecture. Nikko Station is on the JR or \nTobu lines. The venue is a 10-minute walk from the Shinkyo bus stop. \n\n*The Tsurugaoka Hachimangu shrine festival is held Sept. 14-16 in \nKamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. The shrine is a 10-minute walk from JR \nKamakura Station, an hour&#39;s train ride from Tokyo Station on the JR \nYokosuka Line. \n\n*The fall Sawara Festival in Sawara, Chiba Prefecture, is held Oct. 8-\n10. The summer festival is held July 16-18. Both events are held near \nthe Onogawa river, a 10-minute walk from JR Sawara Station.\n(IHT/Asahi: July 20,2004) (07/20) \n\n\n"
