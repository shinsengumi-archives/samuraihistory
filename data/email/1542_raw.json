I just recently read that \n&gt; according to one source (=\r\n=8F=E3=90=99&quot;N=95=88) the famous attack on Shingen by \n&gt; Kenshin at the fou=\r\nrth battle of Kawanakajima where shingen blocked \n&gt; with his fan, was actua=\r\nlly made by Kenshin&#39;s &quot;kagemusha&quot;, Arakawa \nIzu \n&gt; no Kami.  In another sou=\r\nrce (=96k=89z=8CR=8BL), Shingen apparently met with \n&gt; the monk Tenkai, and=\r\n told him that the man who fought shingen was \n&gt; HIS &quot;kagemusha&quot;.  So for a=\r\nll anyone knows, they were BOTH \nkagemusha, \n&gt; and Kenshin and Shingen were=\r\n somewhere else completely.\n\n\n"
