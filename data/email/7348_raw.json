It&#39;s a shame that\nIai isn&#39;t very\nwell\n&gt; known as there are so many benefits to be learnt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n\nHi dave\n\n   If you want to train in Japanese Swordsmanship you\nmay want to\nlook \ninto Shinkendo. I have been in Shinkendo For 10+ years\nand and teach\nit \nin Arizona. I have found it a good way to work both\nmind & body.I \nchecked and there are 3 Dojos in the UK For more\ninformation goto. \nhttp://www.shinkendo.com\n\nGood luck\nJeff Harris\n\nHi\nIf your lookking for the Uk guys I have had dealings\nwith Darren Whyley. I sold him katana last year.\n\nVery nice guy, very open and I htink you will do well\nif you get the chance to train with him, He doesnt\nspeak highly of his own training which can in many\nways be a good thing, theres n need to train with a\nsensei who has nothing but ego.\n\npaul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n  \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
