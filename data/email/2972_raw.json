The\n&gt; 2-hour show was much better, and had our own Tony\n&gt; Bryant as a source.\n&gt; \nSounds like a great show. Being high carbon won&#39;t make a blade brittle, its the tempering that does that. Whenever I need studs for my milling machine I always use drill rod, being about a 3rd or more stronger than mild steel in its untempered state. I&#39;m away from my Machinery&#39;s Handbook so I can&#39;t give exact numbers!\n\nJim Eckman\n\n"
