It is like the Virgin Mary job - someone had it - they were well\nknown for it, and the job is abolished. \nI have studied various martial arts, and am still studying. I lived in\nJapan, enjoyed learning the ways and language,and I know a goodly\nchunk of japanese history. I make japanese style armor (note - I did\nnot say I make Japanese armor) and I make Japanese style equipment for\nre-enacting a &quot;samurai&quot; lifestyle.\nRe-enacting, people...\nAnyone who has ethics of any sort lives by a &quot;code...&quot;\nYour code may or may not resemble a &quot;code&quot; followed by Samurai, but\nsince none are living, and none are &quot;Legal&quot; then we do what we can.\nIf you are honest to your goals, and enjoy the asthetics of a\nreasonably Japanese&quot; life style, so be it. A real person can see that\nfor what it is.\nJust because this is the &quot;samurai List&quot; does not mean any one of us\nare Samurai...\nHagakure was written by well meaning people who either saw their jobs\ngetting destroyed, or were sitting around wishing their jobs had not\nbeen destroyed. Guess what - I have had my paid jobs destroyed\nnumerous times...I survived, and my ethics are intact. That says\nsomething about me, not the jobs...\nWas Hagakure an ultimate, end all code that all Samurai followed?\nHell no. It is a mish mash. One could go through modern corporate\nemployee handbooks and find similar things...\nI hope archaeologists in three hundred years don&#39;t think the everyday\n&quot;public servant&quot; of our times followed such things to the letter - let\nalone anyone who has gotten a black belt through a grist mill martial\narts dojo...\n&quot;Bomb Diplomacy&quot;? I could see how modern folk could take that the\nwrong way, and read &quot;Nagasaki...&quot; take that the wrong way, but perhaps\nthe shock value of the truth is what is hinted at...\nThat actually goes to prove my point. It is a politically oriented\nconcept applied to something that was intended in an earlier, more\npure state...referring to shock value and truth.\nI too would hire Tony - and I have very high clearances in the\nU.S.M.C. Ordanance Disposal department...\nI was willing to die for my country and for those I served....did that\nmake me a samurai? No.\nIt might have once...but not now...\nthere are no samurai....\n\n\nDate Saburou yukiie - \nChristopher Wright...\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;midorinotoradesu&quot;\n&lt;bkirkham@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The irony and sarcasm of this group has gone over the deep end.  I&#39;ll \n&gt; try not to tell my wife (who is Japanese) about the theory of &quot;Bomb \n&gt; Diplomacy&quot;.  She probably won&#39;t appreciate it very much.  \n&gt; I would however, like to say that Tony is one of the most eloquent \n&gt; writers I know.  If you ever need a Job, we could certainly use a \n&gt; straight talker like you in the U.S. Military.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brandon\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Anthony J.
