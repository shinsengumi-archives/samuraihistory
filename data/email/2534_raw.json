I meant that all tachi were intended to\nbe u=\r\nsed with one hand only, from horseback, even it could be that once\ndismount=\r\ned the Samurai should have the possibility to handle them with\nboth hands. =\r\nTo stroke with both hands against a target on your side and\nlower than you =\r\nis rather difficult and probably senseless, worst if on\nthe left side !\nBut=\r\n Yumi first and then Yari relegated the Tachi to a (relatively)\nsecondary r=\r\nole in horseback fighting. The assertion you made about the\ncontrol of hors=\r\ne is right when we speak about sword/sword or\ncavalry/infantry close combat=\r\n fight, but a good control could be made\nalso without hands on bridles when=\r\n shooting arrows or fighting with\nYari. \n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa:=\r\n Tom Helm [mailto:junkmail@...] \nInviato: venerd=EC 21 novembre 2=\r\n003 4.44\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] TA=\r\nCHI and tai chi\n\nProf. Murphy-\nI beg to differ, tachi mountings of the Kama=\r\nkura period would seem to \nsupport a single-handed approach.
