In 1979, Professor Noel Perrin wr=\r\note a book called Giving Up the Gun, Japan&#39;s Reversion to the Sword, 1543-1=\r\n879, and in this book he claims that Japan gave up the gun, or &quot;put the gen=\r\nie back in the bottle&quot; as it were, and pushes his theory to show that the c=\r\nontemporary nuclear arms race happening as he wrote the book could be rever=\r\nsed. A great thought, unfortunately in academic circles in the West and Jap=\r\nan, his work is not taken seriously, and the Japanese language version expl=\r\nicitly states that the book is not based on historical fact. Despite this, =\r\nwriters and scholars who do not generally focus on Japan have liberally cit=\r\ned his work, which has kept the myth alive. Add to that the pop-culture ima=\r\nge of Samurai as honor-bound righteous warriors who would never do somethin=\r\ng so dishonorable as shoot an enemy from a distance, and it&#39;s easy to see w=\r\nhy the myth has endured.\n\nJapan in fact didn&#39;t &quot;give up the gun&quot; at all. Gu=\r\nns were being produced and used throughout the Edo period. It was more of a=\r\nn issue of guns not being necessary during this time of peace, and Samurai =\r\nalready being armed with swords as a matter of course anyway - why bring a =\r\nbulky, long-barreled muzzle-loading single-shot arquebus to a sword duel?\n\n=\r\nMentioned in this podcast:\n\nEtheridge, Charles, Reinventing the Sword: A Cu=\r\nltural Comparison of the Development of the Sword in Response to the Advent=\r\n of Firearms in Spain and Japan.
