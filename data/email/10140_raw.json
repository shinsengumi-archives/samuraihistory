Tukuba to see the colored trees in late Autum , or floweres of Tutuji  and others in Spring,  I pass through Moriya .\n   Did you go to Mt. Tukuba which is one of the precious mountains not too high located in Kanto area such a flattered ground.\n   The Tuchiura , Ibaraki Ken is the city  I used to live untill hight school days after I was born.    So ,  you are a my neighbor .    It will be realy wonderful if you could come back to Moriya , or other area near to me  in the near future.\n   \n  By the way,  I used to live in USA  over 15 years with my family  to work as the representative of a Japanese company .   Los Angeles for  6 years ,  Detroit for 6 years and Chicago, New Jersey for  3 years .   I can say  USA is another my home country , considering the days of my job involved\n in the USA market for 25 years totally in cluding staying there as mentioned earlier.\n  My youngest son , actually my third son ,  was born in Hackensack ,  New Jersey , 28  years ago.  (  Other sons  were born in Hong Kong and Japan.)\n   \n  Regarding to Sinto,  you could understand real sotry about it if you read KOJIKI  , or NIHON Shoki.  You are highly recommended to read them.\n   \n    By the way, did you go to Mt. Tukuba ?  Because you can find  the  Jinja of Tukuba, at which Amaterasu Omi  Kami , one of the big God of Sinto is defied .\n  The Jinja of Tukuba is one of the oldest shrines , more than 2,300 years ago ? they believed, in Japan  and  the very famous  prince ,YAMATO TAKERU no MIKOTO, described in KOJIKI  visited that Jinja to pray for the victory to destroy Ezo who were the barbarians at that time, of which story \n still many current Japanese people  believe now.    The statue of YAMATO TAKERU no MIKOTO  is stood there as the celebration for him.\n   \n    Please let me know your memory of days you lived in Ibaraki ,  the places you visited ,  what points you impressed in Ibaraki,  etc, etc.\n   \n    Eddie\n   \n  \n\nCearb@... wrote:\n            Eddie--\n\nI lived in Japan for four and a half years, three in Fukaya, Saitama, and a \nyear and a half in Moriya, Ibaraki. I loved my time there and hope to be \nable to go back sometime soon -- it was an excellent experience. \n\nI recall, for example, that on the grounds of the Asakusa Kannon temple \nthere is a small shrine, as I believe is true on the grounds of Kiyomizu-dera \nin Kyoto, among others. Certainly the various texts I&#39;ve read (Japanese \nReligion by H. Byron Earhart, Shinto: The Kami Way by Sokyo Ono, The Japanese \nExperience by W.G. Beasley, just to name ones that are readily at hand) \nall suggest the overlap of religions I mentioned in my previous e-mail. \nThat&#39;s why I&#39;m surprised that you say that Buddhism and Shinto are completely \nseparate -- your statement contradicts quite literally EVERYTHING I have \nread about Japanese religion.\n\nAs to your final point, I certainly hope you&#39;re right -- that the various \nnations and religions of the world can come together in ever-increasing \npeace and mutual understanding.\n\nKiotsukete!\n\n--RMB\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n            \n \n\n \n---------------------------------\nVANCOUVER 2010 Olympic News [Yahoo!
