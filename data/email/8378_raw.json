Great responses from all! I am glad to join this group. I \nbelieve my =\r\nquestion was not why the Tokugawa control lasted so long \nbut rather do you=\r\n as a group think Japan has benefited from the 200 \nyears of isolation unde=\r\nr Tokugawa control or has it like my friend \ncontends been subjected to unr=\r\nepairable social damage?\n\nRob Hirai\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@...=\r\nm, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\nlistowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, David Kocot &lt;dmkocot@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Governments fall when t=\r\nhey fail to adapt to changing \ncircumstances.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During the Tokugawa =\r\nperiod, though, nothing changed. \nConsequently, they \n&gt; &gt; had no problems (=\r\naside from a few minor hicups early on from a \nfew \n&gt; &gt; malcontents early o=\r\nn, when folks were still adjusting to the new \norder).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would arg=\r\nue that the Tokugawas&#39; longevity was due to \nisolation, which \n&gt; &gt; insulate=\r\nd Japan from change. The minute Commodore Perry hit \nland, the \n&gt; &gt; Tokugaw=\r\na were doomed (well, maybe not doomed. But they obviously\n&gt; weren&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; ab=\r\nle to keep up.).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; David Kocot\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Definately. And &quot;adapting&quot; =\r\nis something that the Japanese \ngovernment,\n&gt; shogunate, bakufu, or any oth=\r\ner power group of ANY era has never \nbeen\n&gt; good at. You almost never see c=\r\nhange, just revolutions and power\n&gt; grabs. In this brave new world of sword=\r\ns into plowshares, it will \nbe\n&gt; interesting to see how far the Japanese ec=\r\nonomy will have to fall\n&gt; before either the country falls into third world =\r\nstatus, or for the\n&gt; government to reorganize and reform. Guns and swords w=\r\nouldn&#39;t go \nover\n&gt; well in this &#39;modern&#39; world. But, most likely, Japan wil=\r\nl continue \nto\n&gt; simply flounder at the status quo for the next few decades=\r\n. It \nseems\n&gt; that no government in any country wants to change until it is=\r\n a \ndecade\n&gt; or two into utter crisis. A pound of cure seems so much more\n&gt;=\r\n worthwhile than that ounce of prevention. Looking at it from the\n&gt; perspec=\r\ntive of history, it will be interesting to see how post-\nmodern\n&gt; revolutio=\r\nns in first world countries are conducted. 120 years ago,\n&gt; when economies =\r\nweren&#39;t tied together guns and steel could work, and\n&gt; did work, they were =\r\nthe agents of change. Not specificaly &#39;samurai&#39;\n&gt; related, but interesting =\r\nnonetheless.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
