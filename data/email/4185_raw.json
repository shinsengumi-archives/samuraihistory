Upon becoming Miura Anjin the samurai, Will Adams was declared dead so that his wife in England in was made a widow and he was free to marry Oyuki, further tying him to Japan, and the construction of the western-style vessels Tokugawa Ieyasu desired. \nThe samurai were not an elite that underwent trials (this is something more akin to modern special forces, or elite military corps such as the Ottoman Janissaries), but a social (with military, bureaucratic, and political roles) class, and their loyalty and economic/military/ administrative values were often than not what decided their fortunes. Therefore Will Adams is a prime example, if obviously unique at the same time. \nM.Lorimer\n\nDaniele Frison &lt;eriel666@...&gt; wrote:\nI think it&#39;s worth to mention the figure of Sir William Adams.\nAn english man, a sailor, who challenge his fate and began a new life in Japan.\nHe became a samurai only for his services and, in particular, obtained a position and the fortune to stay very close to Tokugawa Ieyasu!\nWhat do you think of this man?\nDaniele\n\nMichael Lorimer &lt;mijalo_jp@...&gt; wrote:\nCorrect birth (or adoption), loyalty to a master (very often, or until the time was right to make a move on that lord, or try out for another), war,......\n\ndedgeman4 &lt;four_44@...&gt; wrote:I was just wondering if anyones knows if the Samurai went through \nany trials to enter the elite order?\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
