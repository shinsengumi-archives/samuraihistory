Forgive me for my ignorance but how can I look\ninto =\r\nthe pictures posted in the yahoogroup? Can you please provide a URL\nto the =\r\nsword pictures described below. Thanks so much guys!\n\nGerald \n\n-----Origina=\r\nl Message-----\nFrom: tom helm [mailto:junkmail@...] \nSent: Wednes=\r\nday, May 07, 2003 3:06 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: R=\r\n: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\n\nCarlo-\n\tScott has the translation s=\r\no he can easily straighten us out \nand the mountings are clearly wartime pr=\r\noduction. Without further \ninfo though, I stand by my translation. The Niho=\r\nnto Meikan lists five \nKatsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one who signed=\r\n in this manner. \nThe shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sengo Masa=\r\nshige. \nMasashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa. Banshu Katsuyoshi=\r\n \nwas originally from the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and worked around the \nTen=\r\nna era (1681-1683).\n\tOne would expect to see some characteristics of the Se=\r\nngo \nschool in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and monouchi are \nimport=\r\nant. I agree no final determination can be made without sword \nin hand, but=\r\n I would posit that a faker or &#39;tribute&#39; sword would \nhardly choose to copy=\r\n the work of a late generation smith from a \nlittle known line.\nTom\n\n\n\n[Non=\r\n-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http=\r\n://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an ema=\r\nil to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
