My name is Robert Omura. My grandfather was Kenji Omura who came from the Kagoshima region of Japan and came to Canada in the early 20th C. He was the eldest son of a samurai family. I never knew my grandfather as he died in an internment camp in British Columbia. Before WWII my grandfather held title to property from Vancouver to Montreal, but these were confiscated and sold to Veterans Affairs during the war. My father, who was born in Canada, inherited his estate years ago, and was contacted in the late 1970&#39;s by his cousin there and, because he had never been to Japan, he transferred title to the lands to his cousin. These were in the Kagoshima area. I understand that he was adopted to the Watabe family as a child, but changed his name back to Omura. I am told that my great-grandfather was asked to move to the capital to run the Japanese tax system -- late Meiji period, but refused. I also\n understand that the records are largely complete in Kagoshima, having been largely spared by the war. Any hints or suggestions on tracking more information would be greatly appreciated.\n\njacob gerhard &lt;madbearscave@...&gt; wrote:Hi,\n\nMy name is Jake.

I have a intrest in the Shimazu\nClan of Satsuma province. I was told that Satsuma\nproduced some of the most fearsome No-dachi samurai.\nIs there any truth to this.\n\nAlso were the Shimazu invovled in putting down the\nShimabara Reblion of 1637-1638.\n\nAny help on these questions will be greatly\nappreaciated as well as any other information\nregarding the Shimazu.\n\nNote: I have read the article on Shimazu Yoshihisa and\nIriki-In Shigetomo.\n\nThank you,\n\nJake\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
