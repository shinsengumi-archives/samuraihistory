In\nfact many Japanese movies dont even portray them\nproperly yet\n\nThe term ninja is new - in the past they were called\nshinbo - suppa - kussa - iga no mono - koga no mono,\nthe list is endless.\n\nEvery school/family of ninjutsu was different. some\nspecialised in warfare tactics sop they basically\nceased to exist once wars declined, some maybe even\ncontinued right up to the meiji period to today. Today\nthe katori Shinto ryu has ninjutsu in its training\ncurriculum. One school of ninjutsu, even used young\ngirls to obtain pillow secrets which there then passed\non.\n\nSome Ninja schools did carryout the clandestine\nactivities that you read about, but little is know of\nthese types of ninja as there activities are recorded.\nThree documents written by ninja exist today.\nbansenshukai, ninpiden, Shoninki. however all were\nwritten some  years into the beginning days of the edo\nperiod. \n\nThe last two know recorded activities of ninja was at\nthe Shimabara rebellion where they failed (due to not\nhaving the local accent and old age)and some were even\ninjured, and the last I know of is one ninja climbed\nabout a dutch ship in the 1800&#39;s and stole a menu. if\nhe could read dutch he would not have taken the menu.\n\nHope this helps\n\npaul\n\n\n\n\n--- keyoke_ot_acoma &lt;gandalf_39a@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nCan anyone tell me, preferably based of evidence,\nwhether Ninja \nreally existed? There is no doubt that many nations\nhad assassins and \nhired killers and Japan I&#39;m sure is no exception. But\nI have read \nthat Ninja, as such, are a myth and are the subject of\nstorytellers \nand some fanciful notion that there was a dojo\nspecifically for the \npurpose of training these super human elite. We&#39;ve\nread the stories \nand seen the films, so over to you all, if they did\nexist where is \nthe evidence?\n\nKEYOKE.\n\n\nYahoo!
