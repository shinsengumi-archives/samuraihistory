Does anyone know of a good source for Korean\n&gt; uniforms?  I plan on buying \n&gt; some 15mm Korean miniatures from Eureka Miniatures\n&gt; in Australia and it would be \n&gt; nice if I could find some colour illustrations of\n&gt; the Korean soldiers so I \n&gt; know what the miniatures should look like.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n\nBob--\n\n2 sources I&#39;d check, both by Turnbull--his &quot;Samurai\nInvasion&quot; is exclusively about Hideyoshi&#39;s invasion in\nthe 1590&#39;s, and &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; has a great color\nplate depicting Kato Kiyomasa in action against the\nKoreans. If you can find it online, the War Museum in\nSeoul has some great exhibits, but not sure if it has\na website. I just tried a quick google, but you may\nhave better luck. It&#39;s worth looking. \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail is new and improved - Check it out!\nhttp://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail\n\n"
