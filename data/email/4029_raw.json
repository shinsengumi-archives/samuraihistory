There&#39;s no such thing as a \n&quot;beautiful war&quot;.  That&#39;s an oxymoron if ever I heard one.  If done for personal \ngreed and aggrandisement, yes, to start a war is dishonourable.  It is not, \nhowever, dishonourable to END a war by any means necessary when the party in the \nright is the victor, and it is not wrong to keep a war going until the party in \nthat right (whatever it may be) is victorious.  And I must agree with whomever \nsaid that there are both honourable and dishonourable actions in wartime, on \nthe battlefield and off.  War is another part of life, however ugly it may be, \nand there are honourable and dishonourable acts in everyday life.\n\n\nFair enough but how do you define a &quot;right&quot;side in a war. Surely that is just a matter of oppinion and if so then there is no correct honour, just how you percieve it?\n\nJonny\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
