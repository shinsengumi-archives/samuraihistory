Part of the reason \n&gt; for this of course is that other cultures didn&#39;t\n&gt; have to pray at exact \n&gt; times like the Catholic church of the period\n&gt; insisted on. I do remember \n&gt; seeing a book on the subject but if I recollect\n&gt; properly, clockmaking \n&gt; doesn&#39;t get started until the Jesuits show up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still cool for later period stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some stuff off a website:\n&gt; \n&gt; We have a number of such books on general or\n&gt; specific technologies \n&gt; published during the period, as never existed in the\n&gt; preceding era. \n&gt; Progress in printing and the demand for information\n&gt; from industrialists \n&gt; stimulated their publication. Number, variety and\n&gt; contents of these \n&gt; books far more superseded those written in the\n&gt; contemporary China, and \n&gt; we may compare them with the Renaissance and Baroque\n&gt; technical books of \n&gt; Europe. Most of them are reprinted with commentary\n&gt; and notes by modern \n&gt; editors.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can classify these books in several categories:\n&gt; first, compendium or \n&gt; encyclopedia; second, picture book; third, practical\n&gt; text; and fourth, \n&gt; memorandum of practioner. Karakuri-kimmo-kagamigusa\n&gt; (automaton) 1730; \n&gt; Karakuri-zui (clock & automaton) 1796; &lt;snip snip\n&gt; snip&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to these books local historians are\n&gt; searching for materials \n&gt; of related subjects in unpublished letters or\n&gt; reports.\n&gt; \n&gt; More:\n&gt; \n&gt; The first mechanical clocks introduced to Japan were\n&gt; probably Italian \n&gt; and Dutch clocks presented as gifts by European\n&gt; merchants in the early \n&gt; to mid sixteenth century. Between 1550 and 1650\n&gt; there was a strong \n&gt; missionary influence in Japan, particularly the\n&gt; Jesuits, who taught \n&gt; clock making. In 1650 all Europeans were ejected\n&gt; from Japan with the \n&gt; exception of a small European enclave at Nagasaki.\n&gt; Early Japanese clocks \n&gt; therefore used Western technology to keep the\n&gt; Chino/Japanese time system.\n&gt; \n&gt; This time system divides the day into two parts,\n&gt; each with six two hours \n&gt; periods. The first is from sun up to sun down and\n&gt; the second from sun \n&gt; down to sun up. The problem is obviously that with\n&gt; changing seasons the \n&gt; dark hours and the light hours will be relatively\n&gt; longer or shorter. \n&gt; This resulted in two kinds of clock, one with a\n&gt; variable running speed \n&gt; and fixed markers or one with a constant running\n&gt; speed and movable markers.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 1853 Perry re-established a European presence in\n&gt; Japan and in 1873 \n&gt; the Japanese revoked their traditional time keeping\n&gt; system and adopted \n&gt; Western time keeping. Traditional Japanese clocks\n&gt; have therefore become \n&gt; very collectible.\n&gt; \n&gt; More:!\n&gt; When the Dutch factory chief Isaac Titsingh left\n&gt; Japan in 1784, he \n&gt; decided to take home a local timepiece. He was\n&gt; furious with the \n&gt; shogunate for its intransigence and stymieing of\n&gt; trade, and feigned \n&gt; illness to be relieved on his post ahead of\n&gt; schedule. But the clocks of \n&gt; Japan were something for which he had nothing but\n&gt; admiration. &quot;I \n&gt; examined a clock&quot;, he wrote on his return, &quot;in the\n&gt; palace of the \n&gt; governor of Nagasaki; and as the construction seemed\n&gt; curious, I was \n&gt; desirous of bringing one with me from Japan.&quot; Yet\n&gt; trade being fettered \n&gt; as it was, &quot;the high price demanded for them\n&gt; deprived me of this \n&gt; gratification&quot; (Isaac Titsingh, /Illustrations of\n&gt; Japan/, 1822; p.159). \n&gt; Fortunately later travellers were better heeled, and\n&gt; there are clock \n&gt; collections in the West. But we have waited until\n&gt; now for a proper \n&gt; exhibition of Japanese clocks in all their\n&gt; &#39;curiousness&#39;. This wonderful \n&gt; show (which goes far beyond just clocks) should not\n&gt; be missed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many items used in Japanese time-keeping are not\n&gt; indigenous, and had \n&gt; Titsingh looked closer, he might have seen workings\n&gt; not dissimilar to \n&gt; European ones; very possibly the governor&#39;s clock\n&gt; included imported \n&gt; parts. Steel springs could not be made in Japan,\n&gt; neither could small \n&gt; cogwheels. In fact, clocks and pocket watches were\n&gt; extensively imported \n&gt; to Japan, where the latter became known as &quot;London\n&gt; clocks&quot; \n&gt; (/rondon-dokei/); it is often forgotten that England\n&gt; lost its \n&gt; horological priority to Switzerland only in the 19th\n&gt; century. A samurai \n&gt; and wit, Ota Nanpo, wrote of the situation in Edo at\n&gt; just the moment \n&gt; Titsingh was in town. &quot;No-one was without an\n&gt; imported European clock \n&gt; slipped in at his breast&quot; (Ota Nanpo, &#39;Ichiwa\n&gt; ichigon&#39;, in /Zoku nihon \n&gt; zuihitsu taisei/, supplement, 1978, p.197).\n&gt; \n&gt; Time is told differently in different parts of the\n&gt; globe, and it was a \n&gt; feature of Japanese time telling to assign six hours\n&gt; to daylight and six \n&gt; to darkness. This meant that, other than at the\n&gt; equinoxes, a day-time \n&gt; and a night-time hour were not the same, and that\n&gt; they fluctuated \n&gt; against each other throughout the year. Full time\n&gt; &#39;masters of clocks&#39; \n&gt; (/tokeishi/) regulated the weights that hung from\n&gt; the gyrating spindles \n&gt; to retard or quicken movement. Not for nothing went\n&gt; the comic verse,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; However cunningly made,\n&gt; A clock&#39;s workings\n&gt; Are just too many\n&gt; \t\t/D� kuf� shite mo tokei/\n&gt; /no wa ga amari/\n&gt; /Haif� yanagi-daru/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;JavaScript: newWindow = RevealWin(\n&gt; &#39;P00852_I00721_01123_pop.html&#39;, \n&gt; &#39;screech3006_1&#39;,229,455,1);&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;JavaScript: newWindow = RevealWin(\n&gt; &#39;P00852_I00721_01123_pop.html&#39;, \n&gt; &#39;screech3006_1&#39;,229,455,1);&gt;*Mechanical Japanese\n&gt; Clock*\n&gt; Japan, Edo period (1615-1868)\n&gt; \n&gt; Time in Japan&#39;s cities was mostly measured by the\n&gt; booming of hour-bells \n&gt; (/toki no kane/), either those erected for the\n&gt; purpose, or those \n&gt; co-opted from local temples. The bell at the city\n&gt; entrance to Edo rang \n&gt; an hour ahead to ensure those going to attend at the\n&gt; castle would never \n&gt; be late. Edo&#39;s main hour-bell was in Kokuch�, which\n&gt; happened to be by \n&gt; the Dutch East India Company&#39;s hostel. This spawned\n&gt; many jokes of a \n&gt; culturally relative kind.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is fundamentally an art exhibition, and the\n&gt; technical pieces on \n&gt; display are mostly given the backdrop of a painting\n&gt; or print \n&gt; illustrating them in real spaces. /Ukiyo-e/ prints �\n&gt; the forte of \n&gt; Timothy Clark who curated this show � are copiously\n&gt; used in evidence. \n&gt; More than half of the gallery is given over to other\n&gt; instances of \n&gt; time-telling, such as representations of the signs\n&gt; of the so-called \n&gt; Chinese Zodiac (actually not a zodiac at all), with\n&gt; which most people \n&gt; today are familiar. These signs (monkey, cock,\n&gt; tiger, etc.) were used in \n&gt; fashion ornaments, such as /netsuke/ toggles, or\n&gt; were the subject of \n&gt; full-blown paintings. A painting of a dragon, for\n&gt; example, would be \n&gt; appropriate to put out in a Year of the Dragon (like\n&gt; 2000), and as the \n&gt; signs came around every 12 years, it was worth the\n&gt; cost of buying such \n&gt; things, each according to their budget. People might\n&gt; display the sign of \n&gt; their birth, and the grave of the third Shogun,\n&gt; Iemitsu, is covered with \n&gt; hares, as this was his natal sign.\n&gt; \n&gt; The cycle of the year has a place in the heart of\n&gt; anyone who has \n&gt; received a Japanese education, and paintings of the\n&gt; four seasons, the \n&gt; twelve months, or the festivals and events proper to\n&gt; these are all \n&gt; common in Japanese visual arts. It is a feature of\n&gt; Japanese painting, \n&gt; not seen elsewhere on the Asian continent, to depict\n&gt; a single landscape \n&gt; across a complete year, usually with two seasons per\n&gt; screen across a \n&gt; pair. Some good examples are on display in the Japan\n&gt; Time exhibition.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet More!\n&gt; \n&gt; */A very rare and unusual watch. The Japanese based\n&gt; their method of \n&gt; timekeeping on a Chinese system which is somewhat\n&gt; eccentric, the length \n&gt; of their periods of time altering throughout the\n&gt; year. Each 24 hour day \n&gt; is divided into its two natural sections, day and\n&gt; night. These are then \n&gt; divided into six equal parts. This necessitates\n&gt; allowing mechanical \n&gt; timekeepers to have adjustable markings. Timepieces\n&gt; made for the \n&gt; Japanese market are rare. This is the only example\n&gt; of a clockwatch we \n&gt; have seen. The case itself is also somewhat odd,\n&gt; being large and deep. \n&gt; It would have originally had a protective case or\n&gt; box made of leather or \n&gt; perhaps wood. /*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve probably bored you silly now.\n&gt; Sumimasen,\n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
