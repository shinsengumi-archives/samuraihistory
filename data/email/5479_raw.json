It examined the relationship between Oda Nobunaga and Saito \nDosan, as well as the 4 years leading up to Nobunaga&#39;s invasion of \nMino.  It said recent scholarship points to Nobunaga being heavily \ninfluenced by Dosan (as opposed to his father, Oda Nobutora), who was \nvery brutal in his own right.  Definately an interesting show, anyone \nwith NHK should take a look, although next week is Lawrence of \nArabia...\n\n\n"
