Just wondering something.  In some of the things I have\n&gt;read, although where escapes me, I have seen it attributed to Uesugi \n&gt;Kenshin\n&gt;and Takeda Shingen that they were great rivals with each other.  The \n&gt;evidence\n&gt;y&#39;all have presented paints a somewhat different picture.  Did they ever\n&gt;battle each other than the Kawanakajima series of battles?  And another\n&gt;question: what&#39;s a Kagemusha?  (Or an &quot;onimusha&quot; for that matter -- other\n&gt;than the incredible video game series.)  And this Arakawa Izu no Kami -- am \n&gt;I\n&gt;correct, from what I&#39;ve learned from the Samurai Archives site, in\n&gt;translating this to mean Arakawa, Lord of Izu?  Just wondering.  :-)  \n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;y&#39;all.  Y&#39;all are a wonderful help to me to understand this fascinating\n&gt;period and place in history, especially since the story I&#39;m writing&#39;s set \n&gt;in\n&gt;it.  :-D  Thanks again.  :-D\n&gt;\n&gt;Later.\n&gt;Tim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCharla con tus amigos en l�nea mediante MSN Messenger: \nhttp://messenger.yupimsn.com/\n\n\n"
