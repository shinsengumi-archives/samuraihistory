Convenient too! What\n&gt; about naginata - did\n&gt; they largely disappear amongst retainers and\n&gt; ashigaru after the Gempei\n&gt; Wars, to be replaced by yari?\n\nNot sure when the naginata was replaced--I&#39;d have to\ncheck with Bottomley. I&#39;d think it was a fairly good\nweapon in the street fighting of the Onin. Perhaps it\nwas replaced when the fighting moved out to the\nprovinces and took place more often on horseback?\nanyone?\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nTake Yahoo!
