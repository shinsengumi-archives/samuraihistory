He was playing\nwith the Katana ( that is the best descr=\r\niption of what\nhe was doing ) and he damaged the edge.   So he put\nthe swor=\r\nd on sell and I bought it.   It is around 3\nand a half pounds heavier than =\r\na normal Iaito, but it\nis ok ( my arms are getting stronger, imagine what I=\r\n\ncan do with a Iaito !!! ).\nBefore I kill the sharpenes from the edge, I ca=\r\nn tell\nyou that when I pass a sheet of paper on the mono-\nuchi of the blade=\r\n, when I was close to the final of\nthe mono- uchi I have to stop before cut=\r\nting my\nfingers.   \nIn a scale from 1 to 10 on sharpenes for comercial\nswor=\r\nds, I give Hanwei swords a 9.\nIf you have one, my advice is : do not play w=\r\nith it. \nIt is a weapon (or mean to replay a weapon ) and is\nprimary object=\r\nive is to kill people.\nJapanese swords are beauty to see, to handle and to\n=\r\ncut with it; but always keep in mind that it is a\nweapon.  Be respectful wi=\r\nth it, because it will remind\nyou.\nAbout the ability of the swordsman, I ca=\r\nn tell you\nthis old japanese saying : &quot;An excellent Katana will\ncry in the =\r\nhands of a bad samurai&quot;...\nSo if you are training, train hard.   And if you=\r\n are\ntraining hard, train harder.   There is always\nsomething new to learn.=\r\n\n\nBest regards to all.       \n\n____________________________________________=\r\n______\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam =\r\n=A1gratis! \nReg=EDstrate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n\n---\nSam=\r\nurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http=\r\n://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n------------------------------=\r\n---\nYAHOO!
