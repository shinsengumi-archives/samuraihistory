Let me introduce myself. My name is Martin, \nI&#39;m from Quebec City, Canada. I&#39;ve done a couple of different \njapanese martial arts in the last 15 years. I stopped for a while but \nI&#39;m about to return to it. I&#39;m also in the SCA ans as you probably \nsuspect, my persona is japanese. My SCA name is Fukushima Masanari \nHanzo, a late Heian imperial guard. \n   Now the question.\n   I&#39;m searching about some kind of ceremonial &quot;passing of power&quot;, or \nany info about how the samurai daimyo steps down and how daimyo were \npromoted, etc. In fact, we have a small japanese household here and \nthe leader is stepping down and want to give the power to someone \nelse. We would like to do it the more authentic possible. I know that \nsometimes a Daimyo takes over a household by killing the former \nruler, but we are searching about something more peaceful. \n\n   Than you very much about your future advices.\n\n   Martin \n\n\n\n"
