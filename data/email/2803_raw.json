We cannot help you\n\nor\n\n2. Ask the Yahoo Samurai History list...\n\nPerhaps we can help our very dedicated Webmaster to post some of the \nbasics like what is a samurai (bushi), what is (was) Bushido?The \nanswers being &quot;read the article on death in the culture section&quot; or \nsome such.
