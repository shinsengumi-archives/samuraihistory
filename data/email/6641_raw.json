But he was not yet thinking of Japan as a single entity, \nbecause he was grown up in domestic politics. Only after his meeting \nwith Katsu Kaishuu (&#39;Saigou Takamori Zenshuu&#39;, Tokyo, Daiwa Shobou, \nvol. I, pp. 396-403) he began to think about a Choshu-Satsuma \ncooperation with the foreign powers against bakufu.\n\nI hope to find something more on this argument going on with my \nstudies.\nThe meeting with Katsu seems to have irrevocably altered Saigo&#39;s \nthoughts. Do you know something more about him?\nBye\nDomenico\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Gillian Rubinstein \n&lt;gillian@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;But what were Saigo&#39;s thoughts at this \n&gt; time?
