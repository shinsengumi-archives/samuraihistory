This seems like an interesting story!!\nHow many swords are there??\nI imagine the Japanese soldiers were trapped and preferred to hide the \nswords rather than have them taken away. they might have thought to go \nback get them later on, but looks like they never did... Sure we can \nfind out more by reading the letters!!\nIf you can send a scan, sure I can translate it for you. If there is an \naddress, we can try to deliver it as well.\nAlternatively, you can send via ordinary mail (=post) a photocopy of \nthe letter to me or anyone else in this mailing list willing to do the \ntranslation. I am actually pretty good at translating, plus my wife is \nJapanese and I can have it double-checked at the Japanese Studies \ndepartment here at University of Hawaii.\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
