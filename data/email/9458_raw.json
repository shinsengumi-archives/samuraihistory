I am equipped to\nassist in research, a=\r\nnd recomending sources, and I have the insanely\nimmense University of Hawai=\r\ni&#39;s Japanese history section at my\ndisposal.  And no one should worry about=\r\n thier writing ability or\ngrammar - my punctuation and sentence structure i=\r\ns pretty sub par, but\nthat&#39;s what editors are for, and I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be=\r\n a problem to\nfind people willing to help out with that side of things.
