In that stpory a USA\nmilitary ends up in Japan working witht he satsuma\nsamurai (if I remember right) and even becomes a\nsamurai thats a family - bit of shogun over flow there\nI think\n\nPaul\n\n\n--- tom helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nERIN et al-\n      From what I have seen I am non too hopeful.\nWhile this period \nis ripe for &quot;novelization&quot;, Hollywood it seems always\nchooses the \nwriters and directors who have the least knowledge,\nthe least \naffinity for the subject.As a film it may be great\nentertainment , as \nhistory it is an insult to the subject and the\naudience.\n      The Satsuma rebellion, on which this is loosely\nbased did not \nfeature 16th century cavalry units against 19th\ncentury rifle units. \nThe truth is that the restoration wars, featured a\nmish-mash of \ntechnologies but it was the modern trained and\noutfitted rifle units \nthat proved most effective. It was the Shoguns&#39; army\nthat had the \nmost dead weight in the form of sword, spear and bow\nwielding units.\n      Once the Satsuma men quit the new government,\nthey returned \nto their home but NOT to the 16th century. While some\nof the \nirregulars who fought under Saigo may have worn older\narmour it was \nonly for lack of more modern arms. The units of\nswordsmen that \ndevastated the Emperors troops at Tabaruzaka only did\nso while the \nweather and terrain was advantageous to them.\n      I&#39;ll be there, you may count on that but I am\nafraid that \nonce again faced with presenting a nuanced,\nintelligent, tale from \nhistory, the Hollywood movie machine has chosen to\ndumb it down to a \ntale of good vs. evil.\nTobaku!Tobaku!
