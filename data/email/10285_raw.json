If its oka=\r\ny with you can you enlighten me more on Omoto-no-Saijin based on your opini=\r\non and if possible could you see if there is anyone in your group that can =\r\nalso help me out as well. I do know so far from the links I found on him th=\r\nat he was a strategist for Prince Shotoku Taishi but when looking for years=\r\n he was active and further information on him I can&#39;t find anything on him.=\r\n Other than the links I already have looked at in prior searches regarding =\r\nSaijin Omoto. I can give you these same links that I found they primarily s=\r\nay the same thing about Omoto-no-Saijin but I would like an expert&#39;s opinio=\r\nn on the links that I have looked at and if someone from your group with th=\r\neir expertise can help me out as well on this truly rare person in Japanese=\r\n history. It will be much appreciated because I think there were some samur=\r\nais that weren&#39;t that famous as other ones were and only were local lords i=\r\nn their villages or retainers for their village. The links I found on Omoto=\r\n-no Saijin are right here for everyone to look at just in case:\n\nhttp://tra=\r\nnslate.google.com/translate?hl=3Den&sl=3Des&u=3Dhttp://www.igaryu.com.ar/le=\r\nyendas.html&ei=3Da3ZXTbeRGcqatwf57NnPDA&sa=3DX&oi=3Dtranslate&ct=3Dresult&r=\r\nesnum=3D1&ved=3D0CBgQ7gEwADgK&prev=3D/search%3Fq%3Domoto-no-saijin%26start%=\r\n3D10%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozil=\r\nla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns\n\nhttp://translate.google.com/translate?hl=\r\n=3Den&sl=3Des&u=3Dhttp://www.kogaryu.com.ar/delegacion.html&ei=3DOnRXTfKlLI=\r\nGatge3yOGQDQ&sa=3DX&oi=3Dtranslate&ct=3Dresult&resnum=3D8&ved=3D0CFkQ7gEwBw=\r\n&prev=3D/search%3Fq%3Domoto-no-saijin%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfir=\r\nefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns\n\n(this is the link =\r\nthat I was talking that has his name as Otomo-no-Saijin when other websites=\r\n have it down as Omoto-no-Saijin but it also brings up that he was a strate=\r\ngist for Prince Shotoku Taishi)\n\nhttp://translate.google.com/translate?hl=\r\n=3Den&sl=3Dsv&u=3Dhttp://paranormal.se/topic/otomo-no-saijin.html&ei=3D5Mgm=\r\nTak8kc2eB8-M-JcB&sa=3DX&oi=3Dtranslate&ct=3Dresult&resnum=3D6&ved=3D0CDwQ7g=\r\nEwBQ&prev=3D/search%3Fq%3DOtomo-%2Bno-Saijin%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26clien=\r\nt%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DqQn%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns\n\n=\r\nagain I thank you for your response and hope the best to you and Samurai Ar=\r\nchives its a great site and it goes into a lot of Japanese history no one r=\r\neally knows about hope to speak to you again.\n\nJohnny Hunter\n\n\n"
