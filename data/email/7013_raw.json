I was\n&gt; merely responding to\n&gt; Angus&#39;s point about there being so many with these\n&gt; names. As far as I can\n&gt; ascertain, swordsmiths merely adopted these names,\n&gt; incorperating them into\n&gt; their mei at will, sometimes even using more than\n&gt; one at different times.\n&gt; I will go back to &quot;lurking&quot; and keeping my head down\n&gt; now.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Clive\n\nNo need to keep your head down, Clive--heck, we rely\non you whenever anyone asks ANYTHING about swords (You\nand Carlo, that is). I&#39;m simply a stickler for\nprecision when answering someone&#39;s question, and while\nintroducing new info (ie. about the swordsmiths taking\nthe names) is good and adds to the discussion, it\nhelps if you give it the proper context so as not to\nconfuse the questioner. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
