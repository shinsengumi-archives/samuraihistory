Though Koyuki doing her Samurai duty to TC would be nice as well, as long as TC gets killed. The guy cannot act, I don&#39;t care what anyone says. He plays Tc playing TC playing TC. The mini-series &quot;Shogun&quot; was done far better. david a sigler.\n\nThomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; wrote:\nIf anyone&#39;s interested, how about some alternative scenes from \nThe Last Samurai?\n\nMy favourite would be TC captured and taken to the village, to the\nhouse of the man he has just killed.\n\nTC steps up, the door slams open and Koyuki sinks a short spear\nstraight down his gullet. She is samurai after all, and this is the\nbarbarian who just killed her husband.\n\nAlt.alternative is that the kids stab him to death in his sleep.\n\nRoll credits.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
