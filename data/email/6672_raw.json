The situation cooled \ndown \n&gt; only in the 70s, possibly because wealth tamed most rebellious \n&gt; Japanese. Today, the only form of protest in Japan seem to be \nlimited \n&gt; of individual exploits of violent madness.\n&gt; \nOf course you are right (anyone interested there&#39;s a good brief account \nat\nhttp://www.willamette.edu/~rloftus/ampo.html). \n\nMine was rather a generalised statement based on a politically active \nfriend who regrets it is so hard to get Japanese people to care about \nsocial issues these days. Though the suggestions that the constitution \nmay be changed to allow more military activity seem to be arousing a \nlot of opposition.\n\nre your earlier remark on the Taliban: I often wonder how much the \nsonno joi extremists could be compared with Islamic extremists now - \nhighly xenophobic, impatient with their moderate, compromising \nleadership, hating the disrespect shown to the holy places/ Emperor, \nand believing that acts of violence against individual foreigners would \ncause the whole lot to leave. The differences I suppose are not \nfollowing a monotheistic religion and having far less access to the \nmedia.\n\nContemporary accounts in English are full of terrified descriptions of \nthe &quot;two-sworded ruffians&quot; striding the streets of Yokohama and Edo.\n\nI tried to think of some benevolent despots and came up with: Marcus \nAurelius, Elizabeth I, Kemal Ataturk, Lee Kuan Yew and the Sultan of \nBrunei. (Some of the German princelings might qualify, but I can&#39;t \nremember that history from high school days). Not a very convincing \nlist. Guess we&#39;ll have to stick with democracy: may be sadly flawed but \nit&#39;s better than anything else. :)\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
