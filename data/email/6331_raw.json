However, I trust\nthat the following might be relevant.\n\nAs a student of Japanese swords for many years and having handled and\nclosely studied thousands in this time, this is what I think.\n\nIn the Shinto religion, many things are credited with having a spirit and\nthe sword is not an exception. However, this was then and now is now. When\none picks up a sword of great antiquity and of historical importance, a\nsensitive and sympathetic person cannot help but be greatly impressed. The\nsugata, texture of the steel and the activities in the hamon will convey the\nbeauty and grace of the sword if the viewer has the necessary expertise to\nunderstand and appreciate it. It is possible in some cases to see and begin\nto understand the spirit the maker has imbued in the sword and maybe his\ncharacter also. For instance, a sword from the often flamboyant Osaka Shinto\nschool quite obviously reflects the somewhat brash nature of that city at\nthe time. However, I think in many ways this is similar to seeing the\ntortured emotions of Van Gogh in one of his paintings. But to attribute this\nto a mystical force is probably ill-advised in this day and age. It\nsurprises me that martial arts people feel that a &quot;sword is talking to them&quot;\nwhen this does not seem to be the case with those more familiar with swords\nunless being able to learn when, and where it was made and maybe its\nhistorical context by close scrutiny, may be considered as communication\nwith the sword. I have always considered that in Japanese sword study, kendo\n(or Iai-do) is the practical side of the academic study of Japanese swords,\nbut that it is all kendo in the final analysis and both are equally\nimportant and need to be undertaken together. In other words, kendo people\nare missing a great deal by having no understanding of the Japanese sword\nand the reverse also applies.\n\nWe are taught to view swords calmly and in a relaxed and unexcited manner\nwhether we are looking at a National Treasure or a kazu-uichi-mono. In this\nway we will see everything that the sword has to offer. It may not talk to\nus, but the educated and informed viewer will know the sword intimately.\n\nI hope I&#39;ve not bored you to death with the above and that it at least makes\na modicum of sense.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot; &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, December 14, 2004 12:26 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: swords (was ...Eras)\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a significant difference between appreciation and mystique.\n&gt;\n&gt; One can appreciate the craftsmanship of a sword, a piece of\n&gt; calligraphy, a poem, a blossom, a tank, and F1 racing car ...\n&gt; in fact just about anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of my favourite sights, when working in an office overlooking\n&gt; S London (low skyline) was Conorde on the Heathrow approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; But that does not mean I am subject to the mystique of the thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have often wondered whether the mystique - the mystery - of the\n&gt; sword stands in some way as a marker of man&#39;s removal, or distance,\n&gt; from that which the sword represents.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think the sword carried quite as much &#39;spiritual\n&gt; significance&#39; to the Sengoku and earlier samurai. Their approach was\n&gt; somewhat more pragmatic. The sword represents them, rather than\n&gt; they being symbolised by the sword. The names of sword, as discussed,\n&gt; owe nothing to mystique, more to about how someone came into\n&gt; possession of the blade.\n&gt;\n&gt; There was probably one called &#39;the shop on the corner&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mystique - I don&#39;t think so - just the sepia-tinted voice of\n&gt; ignorance, sentimentality and nostalgia.\n&gt;\n&gt; (If one hand to examine the effect of the sword close up, I bet that\n&gt; goes some way to dispelling the mystique)\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, I wonder whether &#39;mystique&#39; occurs when one doesn&#39;t know\n&gt; enough about the object to appreciate it properly?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thomas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
