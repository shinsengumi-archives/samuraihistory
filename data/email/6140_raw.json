I don&#39;t know much about t=\r\nhe period.  &quot;Why,&quot; then, you ask, &quot;are\nyou on here?&quot;  I suppose I&#39;ll learn =\r\na lot by reading the posts, eh?\nThat&#39;s also why I won&#39;t be saying much, sin=\r\nce at this time, I have\nnothing to draw from to speak.  Wait, I saw a movie=\r\n with Tom Cruise\nin it... it was called, I think, &quot;Top Gun.&quot;  Samurai use F=\r\n14s...\nno, &#39;fraid I&#39;m wrong.  It was a different movie, where he was on an\n=\r\nisland... ah, &quot;Far and Away.&quot;  No.  Wait.  I&#39;ll get it.  Was it\ncalled &quot;The=\r\n Last Scientologist&quot;? (Yes, I know, you&#39;re all grinding\nyour teeth... in un=\r\nison... It&#39;s like when people think that Kate\nBlanchet in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; was a=\r\n good representation of history for\nTudor England.  And Ninjaburger.com is =\r\nthe end-all for learning the\nhistory of the Ninja, you know.  [See #3 below=\r\n.])\n\n2.  You lot are prolific (that is, for you aspiring elementary\nteacher=\r\ns: &quot;pro=B7lif=B7ic (pr-lfk) adj.  Producing abundant works or\nresults: a pr=\r\nolific artist. See Synonyms at fertile.&quot;--\nDictionary.com).  Notwithstandin=\r\ng the literary achievements of\nvarious aspiring elementary teachers and the=\r\nir ilk (look at all them\nthere nickel words!), it appears it&#39;s going to tak=\r\ne me a month or\ntwo to wade through the sheer mass of posts.  I am assuming=\r\n that\nbecause the forum is moderated, the ratio of dross to content will\nbe=\r\n very low, and that much of the content is going to be quite\nspecific, rath=\r\ner than broad generalizations that we should all know\nbecause we read a boo=\r\nk once in school.  (This, of course, does not\neven come close to applying t=\r\no those of you who have WRITTEN the\nbooks, rather than just read them.)\n\n3.=\r\n  Ninjaburger.com?  Even my pet, who has no opposable thumbs, and\ncan barel=\r\ny remember or perceive beyond eat/excrete/sleep, knows this\nis a joke site.=\r\n  Then again, people believe that there are infected\nAIDS needles hidden in=\r\n gas pump handles and that there&#39;s a Nigerian\nwho is going to give them a c=\r\nouple million dollars for one bank\ntransaction...\n\nQ.  No, I don&#39;t study an=\r\ny martial arts (though I&#39;m familiar with,\nbut not a practitioner, of the fr=\r\nuits of that old bigamist, Mr.\nOkazaki, known as Jujitsu).\n\n5.  No, I&#39;m not=\r\n doing a report on Samurai for school and need you\nall to do my research fo=\r\nr me.\n\n6.  No, I&#39;m not doing a website on Samurai and need you all to do my=\r\n\nresearch for me.\n\n7.  No, I&#39;m not in the military, either, but kudos and t=\r\nhank you to\nthose of you who are now serving.\n\n8.  No, I&#39;m not in the S.C.A=\r\n.\n\n9.  Samurai is spelled with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;  Samurai is spelled\nwith =\r\na &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;  Samurai is spelled with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;\n(Thank you M=\r\nS Word spellchecker.)  This should be good enough to\nkeep Mr. Ledbetter mol=\r\nlified... but if I slip and spell it with\nan &quot;a,&quot; may I get a &quot;Get Out of S=\r\npelling Jail Free&quot; card, please?\n\nI look forward to learning about the peri=\r\nod.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll run into\na good reading list somewhere on a recommended =\r\nwebsite and will be\nable to locate the most common texts at my local librar=\r\ny (the Los\nAngeles County Central Library... which has an impressive amount=\r\n of\nbooks, to be sure.  Most of them are not relevant).  In fact, my\nsearch=\r\n method will probably be to start in the Japanese history\nsection and see w=\r\nhat&#39;s there, start broad, and then narrow it down\nas I familiarize myself w=\r\nith who the players are in the history.\n\nCheers.\n\nMatt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai =\r\nArchives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://ww=\r\nw.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n      Yahoo!
