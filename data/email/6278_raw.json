I&#39;ve seen a handful &quot;samurai&quot; movies in the past, (and yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but this is the 2000&#39;s, not the 1900&#39;s (lol). People like to see cool stuff like the Last Samurai even if it isn&#39;t all that accurate. You can&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve seen any better Samurai &quot;battle&quot; scenes in another movies from the past?? (if so, please let me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great movie to boost the Samurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of people to respect them for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate history stuff & think i&#39;m a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome movie. They were like....&quot;Wow, those guys could really kick butt&quot; I don&#39;t know,....maybe i&#39;m wrong??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more insentive to practice kendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in the making,....delayed temp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watch it again and tell me that\n those battle scenes don&#39;t want to make you get up, build a time machine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hopefully a good one), and fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese back then were only like 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(lol). Well, my times up. Have a good one.\n                                                             Yours, \n                                                                Mark\n\nAnthony Bryant &lt;ajbryant@...&gt; wrote:\nmark kd wrote:\n\n&gt; if you buy the movie book(or just go to your local book store and look at\n&gt; it), it will tell you what is accurate and what is not(to some extent). I\n&gt; have the DVD w/ the directors comentary and extra stuff on a 2nd cd, & it\n&gt; goes into some detail on the realness of the movie. \n\nThey have some nerve doing so.\n\n&gt; They said that 1/2 is\n&gt; fake & 1/2 is not.\n\nThey lie. There is so much that&#39;s wrong with it historically that I almost\ncried. Yeah, the armour&#39;s pretty. Yeah, the battles are fancy. But historically\nit was totally crapola.\n\nFrankly, I&#39;d think that Watanabe Ken and Sanada Hiroyuki ought to be\nembarrassed. They&#39;ve each made dozens of films -- some crappy, some really good\n-- and the one they get international reputations for is this American &quot;Dances\nWith Samurai&quot; piece of steaming, fetid poop.\n\nI finally caught it on HBO last night, after months and months of refusing to go\npay to see it, rent it, or buy it.\n\nIt made me sick.\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
