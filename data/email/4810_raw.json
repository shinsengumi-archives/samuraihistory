Yeah!=\r\n you are all correct in almost every point, except about Mori Motonari(woul=\r\nd have been Terumoto).As I check again my references I found myself to be s=\r\no uncareful to give a double checking to every detail I posted.I understand=\r\n that you meant no any intention to embarrass but for the benefit of all th=\r\nose who&#39;ll happen to read what we post in response to our poster&#39;s question=\r\n it is just right to rectify any spotted mistakes in the details given.I le=\r\narned a great deal here.I should have read again and again the materials I =\r\nhave before I would give my contributions.Though I&#39;m tempted to give justif=\r\nications for saying what I&#39;ve said with regards to the issues of titles,I r=\r\nealized that just any issues whether they be political or what,there could =\r\nbe no end to a number of resolutions that scholars or historians give.Wheth=\r\ner a shogun is a title\n that no one can claim except it be given by the imp=\r\nerial court or a person must be of Minamoto,Ashikaga or what,are issues tha=\r\nt could as well amount to a never ending speculative assumptions.We know th=\r\nat the court during those times that we referred to lost a de facto power t=\r\no be considered as actually giving any preponderance to the position that t=\r\nhey conferred to powerful individuals.Hope I wont be wrong again to assume =\r\nthat the sanctions to the positions they confer were just mere formalities =\r\nto legitimize the authority of the persons concerned.But whether a powerful=\r\n individual is sanctioned by the court or not,the strength of their rule & =\r\nauthority still rests with their military and political acumen.But still I =\r\ndo not omit the fact that the throne is still a veritable symbol of Japanes=\r\ne unity invested with prestige & ceremonial authority.Also,as to which is a=\r\n more exalted position;the Shogun or the Kampaku is a subject that&#39;s also s=\r\nurrounded with subjective issues.Again please\n correct me if I&#39;m off the ma=\r\nrk;the title of Kampaku were once the title attached to the head of the Fuj=\r\niwara & its power lasted as long as the Fujawara hegemony lasted.The Fujiwa=\r\nra virtually ruled dictatorially by acting as the power behind the throne i=\r\nnstalling emperors of their choice and forcing others to abdicate as they s=\r\naw fit.But during the reign of the cloistered emperors beginning from Go-Sa=\r\nnjo, who did not submit to this arrangement it dealt a powerful blow to Fuj=\r\niwara dominance from which they never recovered.Then began the feudal syste=\r\nm when another form of leadership emerged.I&#39;m referring to the establishmen=\r\nt of the Shogunate after a long struggle between the two powerful military =\r\nhouses, the Minamoto and the Taira.Well the title of Kampaku still exists b=\r\nut just as the center of power didn&#39;t issue from the court any longer,and s=\r\no also was the corresponding privilege of this once powerful office.I wonde=\r\nr why Hideyoshi could have not become a Shogun.I just stated that he\n is no=\r\nt of a Minamoto birth & didn&#39;t have a courlty family background, but why he=\r\n accepted the title of Kampaku, he is not a Fujiwara either(now I&#39;m not awa=\r\nre if there are Kampaku&#39;s other than the Fujiwara excepting Hideyoshi, thou=\r\ngh I&#39;m aware that the word simply means a regent to an adult emperor;please=\r\n tell me if there are) .Is it not only for political exigency that he chose=\r\n the title Kampaku and not Shogun?Then does it already mean that Kampaku is=\r\n more exalted because it is a title that has closer link to the court? But =\r\nthen again we have to consider that the court doesn&#39;t held sway to the poli=\r\ntical life of Japan during that period.And perhaps most of us are familiar =\r\nthat after Hideyoshi,the title of Kampaku has no more actual power.Still th=\r\ne emperor was the ruler &#39;de jure&#39; but &#39;de facto&#39; rulership fell to the hand=\r\n of the Shogun.\n  \nThanks for all your concerns to accuracy and detail,plea=\r\nse bear with us who may have been careless as to even just minor point of d=\r\netails.With a little amount of knowledge that you have you just dont know h=\r\now far your ignorance will carry you along once you try to share the meager=\r\n knowledge that you possess,but that&#39;s how we actually journey towards lear=\r\nning.First we admit our ignorance,but then after we&#39;ve known a lot we reali=\r\nze how much we still do not know a lot of things unless someone will point =\r\nthat out to us.\n \nWill be glad to read more from you!!   :- )   \n\n&quot;Anthony =\r\nJ.

The emp=\r\neror appointed him sh=F4gun in 1603 (three years after the \nbattle). You ca=\r\nn&#39;t TAKE the title of sh=F4gun any more than any other \nimperially-awarded =\r\noffice or rank.\n\n&gt; This did not pose any difficulty for him since\n&gt; he is o=\r\nf a Minamoto lineage.\n\nWell, maybe. The fact of his multiple genealogies --=\r\n with different backgrounds \n(Taira, Minamoto, Fujiwara, what have you) is =\r\nwell documented. In this case, the \nMinamoto one was more useful, and becam=\r\ne the &quot;official&quot; one. :)\n\nHe obliged the court to sanction his claim.The\n&gt; =\r\ntitle was later passed to his son and down to his descendants until the lat=\r\ne\n&gt; 19th century.The offfice of the Shogun was later abolished under the Me=\r\niji\n&gt; restoration.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was during the Tokugawa period that the daimyo w=\r\nere classified into two\n&gt; categories: the &#39;fudai-daimyo&#39; & the &#39;to-zama dai=\r\nmyo&#39;.\n\nIf I&#39;m not mistaken, Hideyoshi also used that distinction to identif=\r\ny those who \nwere his vassals and those who were his Vassals -- people who&#39;=\r\nd been with him \nsince day one vs. those who joined up later.\n\n&gt; The former=\r\n literally\n&gt; means &#39;heridetary-vassal lords&#39; which implies that they were a=\r\n family of\n&gt; former Tokugawa vassals and more trusted daimyo while the latt=\r\ner literally\n&gt; means &#39;outside lords&#39; which implies that they belong to a cl=\r\nass of daimyo who\n&gt; have not yet gained the complete trust of the Tokugawa.=\r\n\n\nSpecifically, fudai were those who were vassals *before* Sekigahara, and =\r\n\neveryone else -- even those who had been allies then but not vassals -- we=\r\nre \ntozama. There&#39;s also a third category of daimy=F4: shinpan. These were =\r\ndaimyo who \nwere related by blood to the Tokugawa/Matsudaira house. A small=\r\n, but very \ninfluential, group, the shinpan.\n\nThe Tokugawa house itself was=\r\n broken into three branches: the Kii, Owari, and \nMito Tokugawa (the &quot;go-sa=\r\nnke&quot;), which were set to provide an heir for the \nshogunal seat if the main=\r\n line of Ieyasu&#39;s son Hidetada failed to produce an \nheir. A few times (inc=\r\nluding the last sh=F4gun), the heir came from one of the \nbranches. (In fac=\r\nt, one branch itself branched off to form a further three \nsub-houses.)\n\nTo=\r\nny\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
