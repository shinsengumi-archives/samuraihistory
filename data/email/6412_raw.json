This \nmethod was widely used in thes West as well until fairly recently. I \nknew some much older machinists who would let you watch them perform an \noperation but sure as hell wouldn&#39;t explain it. Nowadays students expect \nmore explanations.\n\n&gt;Well, not quite, but the assimilation of knowledge \n&gt;through training and kata is not &#39;head knowledge&#39; \n&gt;but &#39;heart&#39; or &#39;body knowledge&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;but once the hands understand what they&#39;re supposed to do,\n&gt;best leave it up to them.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nCorrect practice makes perfect. A slightly improved saying.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
