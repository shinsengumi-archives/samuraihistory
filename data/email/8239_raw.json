I bel=\r\nieve\n&gt; &gt; hakamas were used during duels thus adding more\n&gt; &gt; difficulty. Ob=\r\nviously on the battlefield this would\n&gt; &gt; have been a detriment but in a si=\r\ntuation like a duel\n&gt; &gt; it would have been more proper. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but as s=\r\ntated, the hakama was invented Heian\n&gt; period or before. Our common image o=\r\nf samurai dueling\n&gt; is from the Edo period. Therefore, this cannot be part\n=\r\n&gt; of the CREATION of the hakama. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, as I stated, the vast majority=\r\n of images I see\n&gt; where samurai are preparing for action, they have\n&gt; thei=\r\nr kosode sleeves and hakama tied up. This\n&gt; statement was meant to include =\r\ndueling. Watch some\n&gt; jidai-geki. If someone knows they are getting into a\n=\r\n&gt; fight, they&#39;re prepared for it. The flowing hakama are\n&gt; usually on peopl=\r\ne not expecting to throw down. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a statue of Miyamoto Musashi, i=\r\nllustrating what\n&gt; I mean:\n&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://www.city.mimasaka.lg.jp/kankou/musa=\r\nsi/kensei.files/kensei.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; Notice the leggings holding in the hakama, =\r\nand the\n&gt; tied sleeves. This is a fairly common sight in\n&gt; contemporary pri=\r\nnts, and the standard jidaigeki\n&gt; indication of someone about to get in a f=\r\night. Here&#39;s\n&gt; another pic, just the top half, unfortunately:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://w=\r\nww.mifuneproductions.co.jp/film/image/film_56_a.gif\n&gt; \n&gt; Regardless, the or=\r\niginal question was about the\n&gt; origins of the hakama. The image you&#39;ve got=\r\n in your\n&gt; head is from the Edo period. \n&gt; \n&gt; _____________________________=\r\n_____________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?  Yahoo!
