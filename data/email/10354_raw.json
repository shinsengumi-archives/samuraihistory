A map would be great, but a general =\r\nsense would be fine too.\n\nAlso, does anyone know how the hostilities began =\r\nbetween Kagetora and Kagekatsu?  Kenshin dies in early 1578... and does con=\r\nflict break out immediately, or is it more gradual?   Kagetora ends up comm=\r\nitting suicide in 1579.\n\nThere is very little information on this conflict,=\r\n even though it essentially marks the end of all Uesugi expansion, while si=\r\nmultaneously allowing Oda expansion from Echizen through to Ecchu.\n\nthanks!=\r\n\n-dennis\n\n\n"
