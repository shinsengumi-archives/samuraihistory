Th=\r\ne Onin wars nearly finished him off, and in the Sengoku the ethos \nreached =\r\nits lowest ebb, and the emerging Tokugawa shogunate set about restoring the=\r\n \nimage as one of virtue and propriety.\n\nBut the heart of the samurai is pe=\r\nrsonal pride and a profound sense of self-determination, \nhis alliances wer=\r\ne always pragmatic - he served whom it suited him most to serve - and \nthe =\r\nregularity with which he changed side and allegiance demonstrates.\n\nAside:\n=\r\nIeyasu seems always even-handed in his treatment of his retainers, which ea=\r\nrned their \nloyalty, because they could trust him. Of course, he had Nobuna=\r\nga&#39;s example to go by.\n\nI wonder, however - if Ieyasu could have done away =\r\nwith the sammurai after the bakafu \nwas safely established - would he have =\r\ndone so?\n\nTo me &#39;the sword is the soul of the samurai&#39; shifts the emphasis =\r\naway from the man, and \nis all part of the &#39;cult of the Tokugawa&#39; in that t=\r\nhe man now has something to live up to \noutside of himself - and the person=\r\n he should aspire to be was founded on Confucian \nethic of service to the s=\r\ntate. - precisely because the Tokugawa did not want a military \nclass with =\r\nsuch a strong sense of self-determination and self-reliance.\n\nThus the occa=\r\nsions when samurai were brought before the court for acting &#39;properly&#39; - th=\r\ne \ninstant redress of perceived offence - always put the bakafu in a diffic=\r\nult position - they \nwanted a samurai bound by his code of honour, but they=\r\n were stuck then when he acted \nwithout asking their permission first.\n\nJus=\r\nt a personal view, but it seems to me the bakafu always &#39;fudged&#39; the issue =\r\nwhen faced \nwith the question of self-determination v subjugation to the st=\r\nate.\n\nJust some thoughts...\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
