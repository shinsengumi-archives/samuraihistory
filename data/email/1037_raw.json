I have a Wak which is very heavy.  It has been put\n&gt;in some made up carved wooden mounts for the tourist market in about\n&gt;1900.  I am about to clean the blade and add lemon juice but I don&#39;t\n&gt;think a hamon will be visible as its condition is quite bad.  It has\n&gt;no signiture and might be from the 19th/18th century as it&#39;s blade is\n&gt;broader than a Koto blade.  Did the Eta Hinin executioners use extra\n&gt;heavy Waks for the job?  I am puzzled as this Wak seems very heavy\n&gt;but doesn&#39;t seem to give any clues as to its origin or period, not to\n&gt;a novice like myself anyway.  Can anyone help?  There is only on hole\n&gt;in the tang and there are file marks going diagonaly across the tang\n&gt;from the back of the tang towards the blade edge (suji-chigai).  The\n&gt;blade lenght is 16 and a half inches (21 and a quater from Kisaki to\n&gt;the Kata-yamagata). Shinogi-zukuri.  No grain is visible.  Anyone\n&gt;help please!\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;Chris\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n\n"
