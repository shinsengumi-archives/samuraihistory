Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure where you guys have been hanging out,\n&gt; but in most of the areas \n&gt; in Tokyo that I frequent (mostly Setagaya-ku) the\n&gt; beer machines have all \n&gt; been taken out or shut down.  Some still exist\n&gt; outside of liquor stores, \n&gt; but are shut off when the store closes.  I admit\n&gt; that I have seen some in \n&gt; the &quot;inaka&quot; or in some back-alley parts of places\n&gt; like shita-machi, but it \n&gt; seems the majority of them have been removed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apologies for the non-samurai-related posting.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Shannon\n&gt; \n&gt; Kitsuno wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Chuuhai was my &#39;test prep&#39; drink of choice when I\n&gt; was in school in\n&gt;  &gt; Japan.
