My all time favorite\nwould have to be SANADA TAIHEIKI about Sanada Yukimura. DOKU GANRYU\nMASAMUNE, about Date Masamune was also a good production.\n    Overall I would have to say the &quot;Soap-opera&quot; factor, including as many\nwomen characters as possible along with romances and comedy has detracted\nfrom the historical atmosphere. Also the faces of the actors and the make\nup on the actresses defies ones suspension of disbelief. They all look like\nsalarymen and office ladies, seems a good Edo or Muromachi period &quot;kao&quot; is\nimpossible to find these days.\n\nTom\n\n\n\n"
