Not illogical\nbut possible not thought out to it&#39;s conclusion.\nLooking for a mideval (sp) relic instead of the actual\nmodern version (i.e. military) I believe is what the\nposter had in mind, but let&#39;s keep in mind that later\non in samurai history guns had an important role in\nbattles so the poster would have to look into earlier\nsamurai history\n\nRick\n\n9-17-2005 ADDED More Books and Videos.
