(this is a long one...)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Where does this social protocal come from.  My point is that social\n&gt; protocol from you might be different then what it is from me. \n&gt;  So how do disagreements get worked out.  If there is no \n&gt; moral bases for us both to live by, then we both can live \n&gt; however we chose, and not be responsible to anyone or \n&gt; anything because we live according to our own needs, wants, \n&gt; culture, up bringing, whatever.  Your logic is flawed, you \n&gt; state that there is a social protocol we must adhere too in \n&gt; one statement, and then you go on to state that each culture \n&gt; has its own standard by which to live by.  So I guess in your \n&gt; logic I (being a country) can invade you (being another\n&gt; country) for reason that are only believed or adhered too by \n&gt; my country and be in the right.  Or I being a thief can \n&gt; invade your house and still money and say that society did it \n&gt; to me, I need to steal to survive, and not get punished.  \n&gt; Thank God there is a an ultimate moral truth or there would \n&gt; be complete anarchy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How are the world wars an example of the moral codes being \n&gt; bent.  They\n&gt; where unjust acts that where wrong.  Simple as that, it \n&gt; doesnt take rocket science to figure out that killing \n&gt; millions of people is evil.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The commandment is Thou shall not murder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Its always easier to do evil then good, and people are by \n&gt; nature going \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; do wrong before they do good.  But then again according to \n&gt; your logic there is no good or evil because we all have \n&gt; different opinions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Greg Quaresma\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; gquaresma@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: \n&gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
