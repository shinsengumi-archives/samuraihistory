There are old\n&gt; folk tales about a great warrior with a army, whom\n&gt; traveled the world. From the information I have, I\n&gt; have been following his tales of either him (his\n&gt; leiniage) from Greece and Rome, I lost the account\n&gt; in Japan and recovered it in Hungry durring the\n&gt; Ottoman Empire.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have informatin or folk tales please email\n&gt; me.\n\nEveryone is telling you that they&#39;ve never heard of\nit, including the Japanese members of this board.
