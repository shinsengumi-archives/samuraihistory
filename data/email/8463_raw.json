Being a man who admits when he is\n&gt; &gt; wrong I concede to the fact that squid may be written in katakana\n&gt; &gt; although I have not seen this in any of the sushiya I frequent.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However I beg you please tell me how ika may be written in kanji.\n&gt; &gt; With all these messages for this one small matter I certainly hope\n&gt; &gt; the original asking member has been satisfied.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I may be expelled from this group for saying this and that would be\n&gt; &gt; truly a shame as I have enjoyed the various conversations immensely.\n&gt; &gt; Far too often the conversations turn away from a pleasant learning\n&gt; &gt; experience into an aggressive &quot;my stick is bigger than your stick&quot;\n&gt; &gt; banter. It is understood that many of the writers hold degrees in\n&gt; &gt; Japanese history. That being said it is also true that many of us\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t. Does that make us somehow unworthy of comment or do you\n&gt; &gt; simply derive pleasure in the belittlement of others?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As the moderator and owner, let it be known right now that I don&#39;t\n&gt;care about &quot;feelings&quot;. Anyone who wants warm fuzzies and emotional\n&gt;coddling can feel free to join this group:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/oprah/\n&gt;\n&gt;As far as I can tell, there are a few things at work here on this\n&gt;list. First, the people who have been here the longest and still post\n&gt;frequently all have known eachother for a few years now. Some of us\n&gt;have even met in real life. Since we are the &quot;in&quot; crowd (being\n&gt;moderators and/or people who are in with the moderator crowd) we tend\n&gt;to not feel the need to &quot;self-edit&quot; our posts for the emotional\n&gt;security of others. We play rough. Another thing at play here is that\n&gt;most of the oldbies here are 1. guys, 2. guys who don&#39;t particularly\n&gt;worry about offending others, and 3. Quite independent, fairly\n&gt;cynical, and don&#39;t mince words.  Some people take this as being\n&gt;insulting or being an outright attack on them. It isn&#39;t.  We are a\n&gt;sarcastic bunch, but a pretty cool group once you get to know us,\n&gt;unless you are the sensitive type that feels that sarcasm is always\n&gt;mean and nasty. Don&#39;t expect us to put on velvet kid gloves when we\n&gt;post. I can&#39;t type with gloves anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt;Remember rule #4, which should have been read when anyone joins the list:\n&gt;\n&gt;4. Have a thick skin and do not take things\n&gt;personally. While we won&#39;t allow personal insults, you\n&gt;must be able to handle being told you are wrong,\n&gt;especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list\n&gt;is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle\n&gt;sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you\n&gt;whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things\n&gt;personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with\n&gt;what is commonly known and accepted as history,\n&gt;then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath\n&gt;of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.\n&gt;\n&gt;Some people may be insulted by this post and leave. Oh well. Don&#39;t let\n&gt;  the door hit you on the way out, or strain your finger clicking the\n&gt;&#39;leave this group&#39; button, or whatever. For the rest of you who aren&#39;t\n&gt;too sensitive to the written word, keep on posting, keep on asking\n&gt;questions, and keep in mind that sarcasm is just because it is funny,\n&gt;it isn&#39;t an attack, and a lot of the time, you may think you are being\n&gt;attacked when all it is is just a straight answer. People here don&#39;t\n&gt;tend to wrap the truth in a warm silk blanket, with perfume and roses.\n&gt;Sometimes we hit bludgeon you with it. I understand that some people\n&gt;are touchy feely, and I have to put up with that in the real world.\n&gt;But this isn&#39;t the real world, this is MY world. That&#39;s what us\n&gt;in-group people have the perrogative to do. Consider it some minor\n&gt;hazing in order to get into the fraternity (although there are women\n&gt;too). I am not PC, and I could give a rat&#39;s ass about being PC. Put up\n&gt;with the hazing long enough, and you might find you accidentaly\n&gt;learned something. And after a while, you too may end up in the in\n&gt;crowd, and sit with us at the cool table in the cafeteria.\n&gt;You have been warned, fortunately or unfortunately (depending on your\n&gt;level of moral indignation) this is the way this place is run, so if\n&gt;you can handle it, you are super kewl. If not, Ted Nugent is\n&gt;dissapointed in you. And maybe I am too.\n&gt;\n&gt;And, for the record: I have only banned one person EVER for being\n&gt;combatitive, and that was because they were emotionaly erratic.\n&gt;\n&gt;And maybe most importantly, don&#39;t forget who you are dealing with:\n&gt;http://tinyurl.com/e2fck\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;Yahoo!
