Although\nmany historical structures were destroyed in WWII, there are still\na number of castles that are more or less &quot;original&quot; construction,\nwith a limited amount of restoration work over the years.  \nThe most famous to westerners is Himeji, sometimes called\nthe &quot;White Heron&quot; castle.   However there are many others, including\nmy personal favorite, Inuyama, a tiny jewel of a castle on the Kiso River,\nnorth of Nagoya.\n\nandrea Smith wrote:\n\n&gt; I have seen how the Japanese castles were built, I\n&gt; would like to see some pictures of some really amazing\n&gt; Japanese castles, like Osaka Castle. In 1614 and 1615,\n&gt; that castle I mentioned was invaded by Tokugawa Ieyasu\n&gt; before he died in 1616.\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
