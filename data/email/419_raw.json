By this I mean that in the \npast the tatto was used as one method in the &#39;five tortures&#39; to brand a \nperson who was convicted of a crime..The samurai themselves would not have \nbeen tattooed unless they had been inprisoned or marked by the authorities in \nthis way..i.e. if he was Ronin it would be a possibility that he was tattooed \nbut otherwise it would be incredibly unlikely and if he was then it would \ncertainly be hidden from sight.\n Tattooing is still viewed along these same lines in Japan today..although \nwith the &#39;westernization&#39; of Japans youth it is becoming more acceptable..The \nTattoo is often associated with the Yakuza clans and various &#39;disreputable&#39; \ntypes rather than the business classes and the same ideas were more in force \nduring the past in Japan.\n Hope this helps ya!\n Abayo.\n Ben.\n\n"
