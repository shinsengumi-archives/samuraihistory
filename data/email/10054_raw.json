Most serious scholars consider Japan&#39;s system semi-feudal in relati=\r\non to the European model, and in reality the &quot;feudal&quot; period in Japan ended=\r\n prior to 1500. Being as I&#39;m in Afghanistan right now I don&#39;t have any acce=\r\nss to my notes or books, so I can&#39;t quote anything for you, but if you&#39;re i=\r\nnterested in the academic take on things, I highly recommend Japan Before T=\r\nokugawa, edited by John Whitney Hall, which covers a lot of the transition =\r\nboth into and out of the feudalistic system. Of course, I already mentioned=\r\n Government in Japan 500-1700, also by Hall. In addition, it&#39;s worth checki=\r\nng out several of the books by both William Wayne Farris and Karl Friday--t=\r\nhey tend to see things from different angles, but Hired Swords by Friday is=\r\n an excellent explanation of how the warrior class came into being. \n\nIt do=\r\nesn&#39;t matter what your primary area of interest is (mine happens to be the =\r\nSengoku, with some deviation into the Ashikaga bakufu), it&#39;s important to u=\r\nnderstand the economic system and how things evolved to that point. I was n=\r\never really interested in pre-Nara period until I read Hall&#39;s book and saw =\r\nhow that initial formation of taxation and government systems laid the foun=\r\ndation for every thing that came after, including the social institutions a=\r\nnd class systems. Now, personally I have no interest in the Edo period, so =\r\nmy research usually stops around 1615, but if that is your cup of tea, it&#39;s=\r\n worth doing at least a little digging into what comes before it so you und=\r\nerstand the framework and WHY certain things came into being. \n\n\n\n\n________=\r\n________________________\nFrom: Dennis Sheridan &lt;ldsheridan@...&gt;\nTo: s=\r\namuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Mon, December 28, 2009 8:13:52 AM\nSubje=\r\nct: Re: [samuraihistory] Koku\n\n   \nOnnamusha, I really appreciate that you,=\r\n and Nate and Deborah, have taken\nthe time to respond to my question.  I ha=\r\nve learned much from your\nresponses, and have references for further readin=\r\ng. So thank you! In my\nlimited reading, I get the impression the feudal sys=\r\ntem in Europe has\nparallels in Japanese history. Both had a small populatio=\r\nn that controlled\nmost of the wealth and power, with everyone else left pre=\r\ntty much to thier\nown devices - as long as there was no boat rocking.\n\nOn S=\r\nun, Dec 27, 2009 at 7:52 PM, Onnamusha &lt;goatndogg@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I guess the point of my way-too-long post was that, even though one koku i=\r\ns\n&gt; technically as you say, in real value, after domainal &quot;borrowing back&quot; =\r\nand\n&gt; pay adjustments, that one koku ends up being significantly less than =\r\nwhat it\n&gt; should be--enough rice to feed one person for a year. Thus, a sti=\r\npend of\n&gt; such-and-such koku ends up being more a measure of rank but not o=\r\nf real\n&gt; income, which varied per retainer household depending on what the =\r\ndomain\n&gt; took out of it before the stipend was paid. And the percentage tak=\r\nen\n&gt; depended at any given time on overall domainal debt and financial cond=\r\nition.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Onnamusha\n&gt;\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have b=\r\neen removed]\n\n\n \n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n\n\n"
