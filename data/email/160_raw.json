Frazier&quot; &lt;punish10@...&gt;\r\n\r\nHey Yuri ...\n    Something you might want to add to your armor and swords would be other\ntypes of weapons. During their initial training, a samurai learned the\nsword, halberd, jo, and boken (although the boken was more for sword\ntraining than anything else, it was still a weapon in its own right). A\nyoung Japanese warrior would be equally proficient in the use of a halberd\nas he would be in the sword.\n    Look back to the province of Aizu. They had two major schools restricted\nto the Aizu and Takeda clans. One was the Takeda school of Ochikiuchi. The\nother was the Aizu school of Onaha Itto ryu, which taught the use of the\nsword and halberd.\n    Please make a note of my email address. When you have the cd rom\ncompleted, I would be interested in purchasing a copy. I am working on a\nficticious novel dated in the mid to late 1500s, and I will need some of the\ninformation you are collecting.\n\nI wish you all the best.\nAlex Frazier\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: lady_lethal &lt;ladylethal@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 05, 2001 1:39 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Samurai Armor?\n\n\n&gt; Hello guys!\n&gt;\n&gt; My name is Yuri and i love the Japanese culture, samurais, animes and\nstuff!\n&gt; Im here to trade infos with you and because Im needing a little help!\n&gt; Im doing a research about Samurais/Armor/Swords/Zen&Art.
