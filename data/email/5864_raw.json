I suggest you study for \na longer length of time. Try reading some of the books by Funakoshi, \nDemura and Nakayama. Or you could e-mail the mother association in \nTokyo the JKA. The web site is www.jka.or.jp\n&gt; \n&gt; I strongly suggest you do more research into the Samurai and \nmartial arts.\n\n\n\nWell if you are talking about the Japanese Karate Association then I \nhave studied with the Australian branch of this affiliation and I \ndon&#39;t think that now after so many years of training I would be \nexposed to bushido. It just doesn&#39;t work like that. If there was \nBushido influences then I would have be made aware of this on the \nvery first day or at least after a few weeks. I have been studying \nmartial arts sine the age of 5, training in many different styles, \nmajority of them being Japanese, However I have studied wing Chun \nbriefly. I agree with continues researching as this broadens the mind \nand help you to realise that not everything you read is correct and \nyou learn to take some things with a grain of salt. A trait, which I \nbelieve, you should inherit.   \n\n\n\n\n"
