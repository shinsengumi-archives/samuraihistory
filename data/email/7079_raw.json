I, personally, have a great fixation with attacking \nanyone who publishes blatant crap about Japanese history with an intent -- or \neven a disinterested lack of concern -- in misleading and lying to his \nreadership. I also have a great apathy for frauds.\n\nSo why SHOULDN&#39;T we, then, have it in for that man?\n\n&gt; I have in my video collection many documantaries on\n&gt; Ninja some conatining personalities such as Karl\n&gt; Friday, Iam Bottomley. now thes eguys are respected\n&gt; historians, however the documentaries are in some\n&gt; cases full of additional crap, do we now ignore and\n&gt; attack the rest of the commentry just because of say\n&gt; one small section of the film.\n\nNo. But the problem is, it&#39;s the bad apple theory. One bad apple spoils a whole \nbarrel. One piece of crap in a documentary or video makes the whole thing \nsuspect. It&#39;s best not to put the crap in to start with.\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
