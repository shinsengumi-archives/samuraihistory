One way to look \n=\r\nat  \n&gt; this though, would be to accept it as a very cool way to find out  \n=\r\n&gt; about your Japanese heritage.\n&gt; \tYou need to look into your family histor=\r\ny and see if you \ncan  \n&gt; identify the people or events responsible for the=\r\n curse. Then of  \n&gt; course you&#39;ll have to learn about esoteric religious pr=\r\nactice in  \n&gt; Japan, which ceremonies of exorcism have been performed and w=\r\nhich  \n&gt; ones might help to lift the curse.\n&gt; \tYou&#39;ll want to study the lan=\r\nguage and necessarily will have \nto know  \n&gt; your  cousins better. this mig=\r\nht make a cool documentary done  \n&gt; correctly or a good book. The idea at l=\r\neast is more interesting \nthan  \n&gt; many of the &quot;I lived in Japan&quot; books out=\r\n there.\n\n\nAlthough I agree with this, I think she would be better off as an=\r\n \nunbiased observer rather than a believer.  Having had firsthand \nexperien=\r\nce with a Japanese family with a &quot;curse&quot; (and therefore, \ncontrary to what =\r\nNatalie says, am less &quot;ignorant&quot; of such things \nthan she is) I noticed tha=\r\nt half the people don&#39;t believe it at all, \nand the other half ONLY bring u=\r\np the &quot;curse&quot; when something goes \nwrong. Then they stress and put bags of =\r\nsalt on the doors and \nwindows, and at least one joined a psuedo-born again=\r\n christian cult \nin order to exorcise the curse.  It would be absolutely in=\r\nteresting \nand worthwhile for her to explore her family&#39;s roots in document=\r\nary \nform, but she seems too caught up in it to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
