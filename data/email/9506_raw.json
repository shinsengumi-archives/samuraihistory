First on the part about the howitzer \ncomment...  b/c I do have some expertise when it comes to american weapons.  \n  The part about the american weapons would probablly  be the most accurate \nstuff in the movie.  More than likely the Howitzer in the movie was supposed \nto be the Model 1841 Field Howitzer - 12 Pounder.   (Hint the 1841 was the \nyear it went into service with the US army) With them even doing a decent \njob of  showing them max elevating the guns to get to their maximum range \nwhich was only about 1000 yards.   As a matter of fact most Field artillery \npersonnel would refer them as guns... i.e. a 4 gun or 6 gun battery.   Not \nas cannons.  There is a difference between guns and howitzers in that guns \nshot higher velocities and flatter trajectories and had greater range.  The \nnomenclature of the weapons themselves started to include both terms gun and \nhowitzer such as the Model 1857 light 12-pdr gun-howitzer and still actually \ncalled that today.\nNow about some of the Japanese references you made.   I cannot speak at all \non the historical accuracy of the timelines and people involved other than I \nknow that there was no american involvement (that I am aware of) in the \nSatsuma rebellion on which the film is loosely based.  Technically speaking \nI wasn&#39;t aware of any samurai ever carrying more than one Katana.   They \ncarried katana and wakizashi and from what I remember every battle scene in \nthe movie, all the samurai are wearing &#39;the two swords&#39;.  The man that \ncommits seppuku is using a wakizashi... not a katana, and samurai would \nnever use a katana to commit seppuku.  It is always was a wakizashi or \ntanto, with the tanto being used quite often.\n\nNinja&#39;s... you might as well get ready to be fragged for that one.\n\nFor the battle...  Calvary with swords vs light infantry with actually \nweapons with with rifled barrels and cartridges... i will stand with the \ninfantry on that one.\n\nOn a personal note, I enjoyed the movie.  I have seen so many people really \ndissect this movie about historical inaccuracies, when I wasn&#39;t aware the \nmovie was suppose to be a documentary.  I didn&#39;t see in the beginning \ncredits &quot;based on actual events&quot;.  How often does a movie get it right \nanyways?  &#39;Blackhawk down&#39; was full of inaccuracies, just like &#39;We were \nSoldiers&#39; was as well, and both of those movies were based on actual events. \n  Movies rarely come close to being right when they are just based on a \nnovel, much less an actual historical event. I also didn&#39;t recall anywhere \nthroughout the movie Tom Cruise gettin up and saying &#39; I am the last \nsamurai&#39;.   I don&#39;t recall him ever refering to himself as a samurai period. \n   I actually thought he did a decent job with the swordplay, being a novice \npractioner of Iaido myself.\n\nGood luck with the anime.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;keiman0&quot; &lt;KeimanZero@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Fwd:  History vs The Last Samurai?\n&gt;Date: Fri, 13 Apr 2007 16:44:56 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In animeontv@yahoogroups.com, &quot;keiman0&quot; &lt;KeimanZero@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;I finally got to see the Tom Cruise/Ken Watanabe flick The last\n&gt;Samurai\n&gt;and I was appalled at all of the stupid historical mistakes that were\n&gt;in it. I recall helping out (with answers) Tom Cruise and some folks\n&gt;connected with the film a few years before it was released to\n&gt;theatres.\n&gt;\n&gt;At least I thought they&#39;d get it to at least resemble Japan after our\n&gt;Civil War. The film was set in 1876-1877. This was the same time as\n&gt;Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X was laid. The animes were more historically\n&gt;correct than the film was.\n&gt;\n&gt;Some examples--\n&gt;\n&gt;(SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN TLS FILM)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Several Samurai wearing only one katana\n&gt;\n&gt;A fallen Samurai committing seppukuu with a tante (dagger or knife)\n&gt;rather than using his katana blade\n&gt;\n&gt;A reference to a field artillery cannon as a &#39;howitzer&#39; years before\n&gt;the howitzer was invented.\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai participating in covert (spying) operations. Samurai detested\n&gt;spying and any other form of deceit. To this end they usually used\n&gt;Ninjas for this purpose.\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai in 1876-1877 still wearing ceremonial armour into battle and\n&gt;allowing an outsider (Cruise as a cavalry captain) to wear the armour\n&gt;of the man he killed. I don&#39;t recall Kenshin Himura or even Saitoh\n&gt;Hajime wearing armour on RK or SX.\n&gt;\n&gt;The battle was laughable. No Samurai will wait for an enemy he is\n&gt;facing to attack first. Especially when he has the advantage of a\n&gt;cavalry charge against infantry.\n&gt;\n&gt;All things considered I think that Richard Chamberlain (The Shogun)\n&gt;did\n&gt;a better job as a Samurai than Tom Cruise. Even Chuck Norris would\n&gt;have\n&gt;been a better choice.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ken Watanabe was robbed. He deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar\n&gt;that year. I did hear he won some anime filming achievement awards\n&gt;earlier this year though.\n&gt;\n&gt;Well more soon.
