My name is Taneiko and it&#39;s a Japanese name, and\n  &gt; I would like to know what it means, so if you could help, I&#39;d greatly\n  &gt; appreciate it.\n\n  Without the kanji, it would be impossible. Frankly &quot;Taneiko&quot; doesn&#39;t sound\n  typically Japanese to me. Taneko would, but Taneiko... something seems odd.\n\n  &gt; I&#39;d also like to know the name for the meaning &quot;spirit\n  &gt; f the tiger&quot;. All I know at this moment is that it begins w/ the\n  &gt; letter &quot;T&quot;. Thank you in advance for your assistance.\n\n  Tiger is &quot;Tora&quot; but as for &quot;spirit of the tiger...&quot; Sorry. This doesn&#39;t seem\n  Japanese.\n\n\n  Tony\n\n\n        Yahoo!
