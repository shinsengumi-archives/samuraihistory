My main interest in this group is that I&#39;m an avid \nwargamer, and am putting together miniatures to recreate samurai \nconflicts from the feudal era (just ordered 800+ miniatures).\n\nAt first, I probably won&#39;t have a good mix of troop types to \nrepresent what would have appeared on the battlefield at any given \ntime.  I have a small contingent of monks, lots of mounted troops, \nand an assortment of ashigaru spearmen, bowmen, and some samurai \nretainers.  While I have a couple ashigaru arquebusiers, my thought \nis that with all the mounted troops I&#39;d best represent earlier \nperiods of warfare (1300-1450ish or so).\n\nMy conundrum is this: I&#39;d like to paint the miniatures so that they \nreflect what a real army would have looked like on the battlefield.  \nWith only a few exceptions, such as Ii&#39;s Red Devil&#39;s in the later \nperiod of samurai warfare, I&#39;ve run across almost no accounts of \norganized uniforms or the like.  I&#39;ve even having a hard time \nfiguring out how sashimono&#39;s and other field standards would be \nused.  Anyone mind giving me some tips on how they would be used, and \nwhat a typical army might look like?  My guess is assorted colors, \nbut I&#39;m not sure.  Like I said, I enjoy the history of the period but \nam not well versed in it.\n\nThanks in advance!\nBen Nason\n\n\n\n"
