The eye skims across the top of a line \nof type like a stone skimmed across the water. As you say, first \nand last letters are important, as is the top half of the line - \ntry reading covering up the top half and bottom half of the line.\n\nThat&#39;s why technical or specialist subject books can be &#39;difficult&#39; \nto read - it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t understand the content, it&#39;s that \nthe brain&#39;s working harder because it doesn&#39;t recognise all the\nshapes, so reading is &#39;difficult&#39; and more tiring.\n\nWe misread things when we mistake the word shape. And as reading \nis a habit, we read easiest what we read most (forming our\nvocabulary), and often mistake strange words for known ones.\n\nI used to illustrate the lecture with the following story:\n\nAs a martial artist, I know every martial art shop in London, \nso I was surprised, riding in a bus one day through a part of \ntown I thought I knew, to see an MA shop that I didn&#39;t know of.\n\nRun downstairs (double decker bus), leap off, run across road and \ninto shop, and whoa! This can&#39;t be right (unless it&#39;s ninja \nsupplies?) Step outside shop and look up at sign, which says not\n&#39;martial arts&#39;, but &#39;marital aids&#39;.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
