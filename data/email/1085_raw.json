I have found some \nexcellent pictures of samurai banners. Maybe some have found it, but \nmaybe some have not. It is of interest to anyone who likes Heraldry \nor mon. Perhaps also to people who research Japanese prefectures. The \nlinks are http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/jp-kuni.html \nalso http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/geo-jp.html -shows a good map \nof Japan.  In general this is a good base for further research.  I am \nstarting a website soon, among the topics I want to look into, will \nbe Japanese prefectures, from Heian to modern day. Mainly \nconcentrating on old maps from adventurers, looking at English \nspellings etc. My goal is one time to have a map of Japan I am happy \nwith for each date in time. If anyone knows of good maps, I would \nappreciate a shout, one site I like is \nhttp://www.davidrumsey.com/view.html\njust type Japan for search topic, you will be rewarded by excellent \nmaps, takes a while though. \nOk then hope this helps.\nTurnbull is not the best in his field, but I suppose until as Kitsuno \nsays the West catches up with Japanese historians, he is at least \nkeeping the subject accesible to people, the problem lies in if by \ndoing this people get the wrong view of the Bushi, I believe it is a \nmatter of compromise, I guess, that if we want to read popular quite \neasy to read books, we will continue to buy each book as it comes \nout.  If we want scholarly books to use for study then I guess the \nadvice is like others have said look to Japanese sources, or to the \npast although there are also some other good Western writers.  Oh \nwell Im not sure, we can&#39;t have the best of both worlds. \n\nhmmm, can we?\n\nall the best\n\nMark \n\n\n"
