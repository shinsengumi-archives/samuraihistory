Can anyone\neither point me to a site, or provide me with a list of the various jobs\netc.\n\nAlso, what do these various titles literally mean, for example, the word\ntaichou, was translated in to &quot;group-chief&quot;, assuming the kanji is the\nsame, does this mean that taisho means something like &quot;group-something\nelse&quot; and if so what?\n\nLikewise, it appeared that kashira and taichou were different words for\nthe same job. Is this simply a function of the era/region/fashion/taste\nof the army using the title, or was there another subtlety at play?\n\nOkay to summarise then, as I understand it ALL sengoku armies (more or\nless):\n\n1) have the same range of required &quot;appointments&quot; within its structure,\nregardless of it&#39;s relative size when compared to another lord&#39;s army.\n\n2) thus there is no difference what so ever, to the titles used within\nthat army, as they merely describe the various tasks being undertaken by\nthe &quot;appointees&quot;.\n\n3) any prestige accrues to these appointees from either:\n\n(a) the comparative social standing of one army when compared to\nanother, or\n\n(b) as a function of the perceived quality/value of some but not all\nappointments within their own army, for example the kudos of being\nappointed as a messenger within the Takeda forces.\n\nThe sorts of jobs that occurred to me included:\n\n1) army overall &quot;manager&quot;, if not the lord himself.\n2) sub-contingent managers, probably defined by inter-personal\nrelationship with the lord.\n3) large sub-unit manager&#39;s, probably defined by function, i.e. units of\ncavalry or infantry (bushi or ashigaru)\n4) smaller sub-unit managers, either as part of a larger one or\nfulfilling a specialist role, messengers, artillery or HQ guards etc.\n\nApart from the main function divisions of cavalry, spearman, gunners and\narchers, the task type roles would include:\n\n1) support personnel such as porters, pack horse and cart handlers,\ndoctors/vets, pages/servants, cooks and other artisans/craftsmen. \n\n2) specialists: such as artillery crews, siege engineers and sailors.\n\n3) communications roles such as messengers, flag bearers (various\nbanners/standards), drummers, conch players etc. \n\nPlus sandal bearers, kitchen sink bearers... You get the idea.\n\nWell I think that&#39;s enough of that, cheer&#39;s for now.\n\nDean\n\n****\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n"
