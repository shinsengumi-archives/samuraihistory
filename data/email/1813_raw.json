Me again.\n  Maybe I can be of some help.  (Maybe not, time will\ntell.  8-)!)  Some time \nago now, I got a copy of the Tale of the Heike. \n(Didn&#39;t finish it: got too \nbogged down with titles and the complicatedness of the\nstory itself.  But I do \nplan to read -- and finish -- it someday.  That, the\nTale of the Genji and the \nTaiheiki.)  In it was a chart listing the times of the\nday, and they were in \ntwelve two-hour blocks, each named with a\ncorresponding part of the Chinese \nZodiac, and went in order of that system (i.e., hour\nof the dragon, hour of the \nsnake, &c.).  Which one started the cycle I don&#39;t\nremember, but it was on the \nodd hours.  If I&#39;m not mistaken, it went as follows:\n\nWESTERN         JAPANESE\n2300 to 0100           Rat\n0100 to 0300           Ox\n0300 to 0500           Tiger\n0500 to 0700           Rabbit\n0700 to 0900        Dragon\n0900 to 1100           Snake\n1100 to 1300           Horse\n1300 to 1500           Goat\n1500 to 1700           Monkey\n1700 to 1900           Rooster\n1900 to 2100           Dog\n2100 to 2300           Pig\n\n  Now whether this was ACTUALLY used or not, and\nwhether or not I&#39;ve got my \ntimes right, I&#39;m not sure.  I don&#39;t want to question\nthe historicity of the \nTale of the Heike, but it is a novel, if memory serves\nme correctly.\n  Hope this helps.  8-)\n\nLater\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
