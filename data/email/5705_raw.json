If \nyou could tell me what type of sword/s you purchased, the cost (using \nUS currency) and the website if they have one, that would help me \nalot. Thank you in advance   \n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
