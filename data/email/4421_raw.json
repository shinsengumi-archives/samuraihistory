In an interview with \nPrimaGames for the \n&gt; PlayStation game Onimusha 2: Samurai&#39;s Destiny, executive producer \nInafune \n&gt; Keiji said that one reason he (Nobunaga) was portrayed as a villain \nwas because, \n&gt; in Japan (and I&#39;m only paraphrasing his answer, not adding my own \npitiful \n&gt; &quot;expertise&quot;), Oda Nobunaga is seen as a hero, even though he was \nconsidered brutal \n&gt; even for the time he lived.  They made him the villain to show \npeople this \n&gt; sometimes-forgotten side of him.  And I wouldn&#39;t knock these games \ntoo much, \n&gt; everyone.  It&#39;s what got ME interested in this time in Japan&#39;s \nhistory in the \n&gt; FIRST place!  :-)  L8r\n&gt; \n\n\nThis is the same case for me as well...I always had an interest in \nthe japanese, samurai especially. But this interest was bolstered 100 \nfold when I actually found my japanese family name in a video \ngame....being &#39;Nobanaga&#39;s Ambition&#39;. A war general in one of the  \nwestern provinces had our family name...&quot;masazumi&quot;. After seeing \nthis, my curiosity began to peak. However, having a young family, \nfull time job, and moving around the city....I can&#39;t find as much \ntime as I would like to satisfy my interest in the culture...past and \npresent.\n\nJust thought I&#39;d share this common point....have a great day everyone\n\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
