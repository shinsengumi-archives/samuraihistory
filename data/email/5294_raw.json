In \nboth instances the Yuan armies suffered severe casualties from these \nnatural calamities and the invasions were aborted. In my opinion if \nnot for the &quot;divine winds&quot; the Mongols would of have a good chance of \nwinning. \nJust to give you some figures:\n\nFirst Invasion:\nYuan army: 40,000; with 900 ships \nJapanese army: 10,000\n\nSecond Invasion:\nYuan army: 140,000; with 4,400 ships \nJapanese army: 40,000 \n\n\n\n"
