And one of the\nother ronin in the group point out that he would have to have been born 100\nor so years ago. &lt;g&gt;\n \nMusashi&#39;s early life is sketchy, so I drew my own conclusions, which may be\nway off base. I didn&#39;t draw the conclusion purely on Musashi&#39;s outlining of\nhis own pedigree; I had other sources I consulted as well. According to\nthese sources, it has seemed logical to conclude that Miyamoto Musashi was\nborn the son of a ronin in a farming village. Like I said, I may be wrong,\nbut I feel more confident to say this rather than to say simply &quot;I don&#39;t\nknow.&quot; \n \nNina\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 9:16 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Miyamoto Musashi was most definitely a samurai. In\n&gt; his own book BOOK OF FIVE\n&gt; RINGS, he listed his ancestry, and he most\n&gt; definitely qualified. \n\nNina, you&#39;re calling out my inner-skeptic. In his OWN\nBOOK, you say? Shocking that he&#39;d give himself a\nsamurai pedigree, oh my!\n\nSeriously, I don&#39;t know one way or the other--he may\nhave been, may not have been. I don&#39;t really care, as\nI&#39;m not a Musashiphile. Had he ever been on the\nwinning side in a battle, or led troops in combat, I&#39;d\ncare--duelists aren&#39;t my &quot;thing&quot;. [/rant] (sorry, I\njust don&#39;t *get* Musashi...compelling character maybe,\nbut Tsukuhara Bokuden or Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, who\nactually led samurai troops in addition to being great\nduelists, are much more interesting, I think). \n\nI&#39;m reminded, however, of Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s &quot;lineage&quot;.\nIt&#39;s accepted as &quot;fact&quot; nowadays that the Tokugawa\nwere descended from the Minamoto, but in truth Ieyasu\nhad several family trees fabricated, claiming lineage\nto the Fujiwara, Taira, Minamoto...to use as best fit\nthe situation. Turns out the best one that suited his\npurposes was the Minamoto one, to strengthen a claim\nat Shogun, so that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got. \n\nPerhaps Musashi was being honest and was a samurai,\nperhaps not. As you said, his early life is extremely\nmurky--I&#39;ll go with a &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; on this one. \n\n\n            \n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs &lt;http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs&gt;  \n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&gt; \nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt; \n--- \n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \nSamurai\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+swords&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Sam\nurai+part&c=2&s=38&.sig=i-aS2VqspDvuosjyLvkOEQ&gt; swords \tSamurai\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+part&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Samur\nai+part&c=2&s=38&.sig=p5v93HNycsLUTd-IlYGqOA&gt; part \t\n\n  _____  \n\nYAHOO!
