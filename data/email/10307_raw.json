Nevertheless formal and clear definitions about the way of the sa=\r\nmurai, the seven principles and thing like that, are written in the Tokugaw=\r\na period, several centuries after.Please, could you help me saying me if th=\r\nere is some code of samurai ways written in the kamakura period (or before)=\r\n, better if accepted and promoted by the bakufu, and what it says more or l=\r\ness?
