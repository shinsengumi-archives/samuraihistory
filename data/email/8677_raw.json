The\n&gt;event\n&gt;is a martila arts event called seni06 (www.senishow.com) Europe&#39;s\n&gt;largest\n&gt;martial arts trade fair. Tatsuya Fujishiro will also give a lecture on\n&gt;sword\n&gt;polishing.\n&gt;\n&gt;This will be followed on Monday the 10th with a special meeting of the\n&gt;To-ken Society of Great Britain, where he will also give a talk.\n&gt;\n&gt;This has been made possible by the joint efforts of Cyberbudo Magazine,\n&gt;European fighting arts international and the To-ken Society of Great\n&gt;Britain. Tatsuya will be at the Cyberbudo stand. Please come and say\n&gt;hello.\n&gt;There will also be good quality uchiko, oil and books for sale.\n&gt;\n&gt;Paul Martin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: Peter A Bleed &lt;pbleed1@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: token_kenkyu_kai@...\n&gt; &gt;To: token_kenkyu_kai@...\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: New book on Japanese Sword Polishing\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 10 Apr 2006 08:11:14 -0500\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Dear Duncan,\n&gt; &gt;       Indeed, I have a copy of the latest Kapp et al contribution to\n&gt;our\n&gt; &gt;understanding of Nippon-to on polishing. I found a copy at Maruzen\n&gt;Sendai\n&gt; &gt;on my recent trip back to the land of the Rising Yen. I read it on the\n&gt; &gt;return flight and was very impressed. We all MUST have this. It is\n&gt;truly\n&gt; &gt;very good, very clear and readable, and handsomely produced. In fact, I\n&gt; &gt;have been meaning to post some comments about the volume on this list,\n&gt;but\n&gt; &gt;you know how best intentions are. I also am writing this without the\n&gt;book\n&gt; &gt;in front of me - since you brought it up - so I won&#39;t be able to give\n&gt; &gt;chapter and verse, but...\n&gt; &gt;       The book covers the polishing process and explains the role and\n&gt;use\n&gt; &gt;of the sequence of stones etc. It also covers the design of the\n&gt;polishers\n&gt; &gt;work station - even allowing for some adjustments that OSHA might\n&gt;approve\n&gt; &gt;and traditionalists abhor! It has good treatments of the styles and\n&gt;kinds\n&gt; &gt;of polish that are the best I&#39;ve ever read. There is also a good\n&gt;section on\n&gt; &gt;how bends and twists are handled.\n&gt; &gt;       Having said all those nice things, there are 3 issues that I\n&gt; &gt;remember\n&gt; &gt;thinking were under treated. First, I would have like more on the\n&gt;nature\n&gt; &gt;and origin of the various stones. There is not even a description of\n&gt;how\n&gt; &gt;they are marketed and where they can be bought. Second, I felt that\n&gt;shape\n&gt; &gt;is addressed too briefly. There is also nothing (really) about how the\n&gt; &gt;polisher can, should and might deal with ji-niku. This is the issue\n&gt;that\n&gt; &gt;has been claimed by experts as the variable that anyone but experts can\n&gt; &gt;screw-up. Yet in this book, it is not addressed. I think the term is\n&gt; &gt;defined, but there is no description. Finally, the whole issue of kizu\n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt;kizu control is ignored. Again, I think there might be a definition in\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt;glossary, but the text says NOTHING about how a polisher deals with\n&gt;flaws.\n&gt; &gt;We all know that a polisher can enhance weak hamon and flatten fukure,\n&gt;but\n&gt; &gt;nothing is said about that kind of work or issues like hako-bori\n&gt;removal.\n&gt; &gt;Maybe those &quot;secrets&quot; are too valuable to publish.\n&gt; &gt;       This is a book for sword collectors and we all need it. I don&#39;t\n&gt;see\n&gt; &gt;it as anywhere close to a &quot;how-to book&quot;. I assume that some people will\n&gt;try\n&gt; &gt;to use it in that way, but it is primarily a description of the craft\n&gt;of\n&gt; &gt;polishing. When it does show up on this side of the Pacific, you will\n&gt;find\n&gt; &gt;enjoy it.\n&gt; &gt;Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Peter Bleed\n&gt; &gt;Professor of Anthropology\n&gt; &gt;810 Oldfather Hall\n&gt; &gt;University of Nebraska\n&gt; &gt;Lincoln, NE 68588-0368\n&gt; &gt;(402) 472-2439\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;Yahoo!
