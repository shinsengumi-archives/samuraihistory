In1585 Hideyoshi\n&gt; was elevated to the court position of Naidaijin; therefore inferior to the\n&gt; Udaijin, Sadaijin, and above them the Dajo Daijin. Could anyone tell me who\n&gt; held those positions at that particular time? Thanks in advance\n\nIn the start of 1585, Nij� Akizane (1556-1619) was sadaijin, but in that year he \nwas also made kanpaku (an office he later resumed in 1615) but resigned it in \nHideyoshi&#39;s favor a few months later.\n\nIn 1585, the udaijin was Kikutei Harusue (1542-1617). It was Harusue who \nproposed Hideyoshi take the office of kanpaku.\n\nOn 7-11-1585, Sadaijin Hashiba Hideyoshi was made kanpaku.\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
