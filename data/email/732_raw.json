I&#39;ve got many choices (and by the\n&gt; way, I&#39;m reading this as who would I wish to have the\n&gt; same circumstances befall me historically and try to\n&gt; live up to what they did. Good compromise?)\n&gt;\n\nThat should work. &lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Being an ex-tanker, Patton is always a choice...love\n&gt; that guy. Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse, just to see\n&gt; Custer&#39;s face as an arrow went through his\n&gt; head...(despite my being a member of 7th Cavalry\n&gt; Regiment...Garryowen in Glory) Maybe MacArthur or\n&gt; Ridgeway, to see the Korean War ended right, unlike\n&gt; the situation now.\n&gt;\n\nI can see that. I always thought that if I were in Marse Robert&#39;s position,\nI would have let Longstreet run a flanking maneuver at Gettysburg, and not\nsend an entire division of infantry across an open field facing cannon\nfire...\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Just my two yen...it is a rather silly, yet\n&gt; interesting question. C&#39;mon, Tony...don&#39;t be so\n&gt; analytical!!!!\n\nI can see that, but to me, this is the historical equivalent of &quot;Which ship\nwould win in a fight, the Enterprise or the Galactica?&quot; &lt;G&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
