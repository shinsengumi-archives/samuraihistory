That&#39;s part of what makes them so uniquely, well, Japanese. What I mean is that one of Japan&#39;s strong points has been their ability to take parts of other cultures and adapt them to their own use, usually improving upon them in the process. Whether it&#39;s kanji, or buddhism, or airplanes, or electronics... the japanese have a knack for learning from other cultures. Yeah, they might be &quot;losing&quot; something in the process, but that&#39;s just part of the inevitable evolution that all cultures undergo. Speaking of which, the loss of the samurai class is part of that process. In a way, getting rid of the samurai was a very Japanese thing to do. LOL. The thing that WASN&#39;T very Japanese-like was their attempt at isolationism practiced before the Meiji restoration. \n&gt; &quot;Anyway we should note that Mishima was not really looking for militarism, but a \n&gt; returnto Japan&#39;s past, what he felt made Japan uniquely Japanese.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; is that really such a bad thing?? Im gonna have to mve to Japan in a few years.. \n&gt; at first I was not looking foreward to it, mostly bcos I dont speak the \n&gt; language.. but many ppl have been telling me I&#39;ll do just fine that they are \n&gt; very westernized and most ppl, especially the younger ones (in my age backet) \n&gt; speak english.. (on a side note, according to the NY times Wed. Oct 23, \n&gt; 2002..&quot;To Grandparents english word trend isnt naissu&quot;) *hooray I actually have \n&gt; a refference* the Japanese are adopting English words into their own language.. \n&gt; History, tradition and a sense of who I am culturaly is really important to me.. \n&gt; so on one hand I was pretty relieved to hear that they are westernizing and that \n&gt; I will get along fine over there, but on the other hand, I feel sorry bcos in a \n&gt; way they are loosing that.. it seems Mishima was in his own....whacko little \n&gt; way, was just trying to point this out to ppl.. does anyone else not see this or \n&gt; see modern Japan as being &quot;sell outs&quot; in a way??\n&gt; \n&gt; Wilson\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________________________________________________________\n&gt; Find what you are looking for with the Lycos Yellow Pages\n&gt; http://r.lycos.com/r/yp_emailfooter/http://yellowpages.lycos.com/default.asp?SRC\n&gt; =lycos10\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
