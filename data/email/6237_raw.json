At least, not anymore. I miss living on \nHokkaido. It was very beautiful there. Especially during the spring. That&#39;s \nvery nice that you like my last name. I traced it back to a very long time \nago...I am related to a Japanese Samurai family. I&#39;m still not sure which \none though. I just need to do more research on that. Anyways. Thank you very \nmuch for your time.\n~Yami\n\n&gt;From: james wilson &lt;johntwo8@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] Japan eras\n&gt;Date: Sat, 11 Dec 2004 07:51:19 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;HAHAHAHA its amazing how we can all be talking about swords and stuff and \n&gt;my spelling some how becomes a topic. Hmm... well in any event Ms. Murasaki \n&gt;that is awsome that you feel this way about your sword. Murasaki is my \n&gt;favorite color and the color of most things I own including my sword. Do \n&gt;you live in Japan? And if so do you live on Kyushu island? Well it was nice \n&gt;hearing someone tell of something we have in common. Well I hope you are \n&gt;well in all that you do hope to hear from you soon.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yami Murasaki &lt;Yami_Bara@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You seem like a true samurai. The way you&#39;re saying thw sword is a part of\n&gt;you. That&#39;s exactly how connected Samurai were with their swords. It&#39;s\n&gt;wonderful someone else thinks that way! Now I don&#39;t feel so alone!\n&gt;~Yami\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: james wilson\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] Japan eras\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 10 Dec 2004 09:16:19 -0800 (PST)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hmm lets see I dont just feel my sword is just a piece of steal. I feel\n&gt; &gt;like its a part of me that needs attention just like a close realative. I\n&gt; &gt;believe that my sword is as strong as me and it can match my capabilities\n&gt; &gt;if need be. It may not be all that to any one else but it smells good and\n&gt; &gt;mackeral or wonderfull I view my swords as a lot more than just tools. \n&gt;GOD\n&gt; &gt;BLESS YOU ALL.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;peace\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Don�t just search.
