Unfortunately for him and his fine works, \nhis swords figured in several accidents and a death or two involving \nthe Tokugawa family. Ieyasu was convinced they were bad luck for him \nand his kin, so forbid anyone to wear them in his presence, this became \nthe law after awhile applied to all who served the bakufu. Playwrights \nand novelists turned this into legend, spreading the infamy of the \nswords and the idea of the mad swordsmith. A shame really because fine \nworks were surely lost or destroyed because of people who took the \ntales too literally or who feared Tokugawa retribution.\n\tFor the real story on the Sengo school and Muramasa I recommend \nvisiting www.jssus.org(www.afuresearch.com) and picking up The Art and \nthe Sword (their annual) with the excellent articles by Dr. Gordon \nRobson DRE.\n-t\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
