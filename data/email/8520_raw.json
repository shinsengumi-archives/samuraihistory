This was also the period of the 47 Ronin and you might want to check out some of the historical sources and commentaries on this famous play.  \n   \n  Probably the most accessable source of the period of Tsunayoshi&#39;s reign would be the well-known memoirs of Engelbert Kaempfer, a Dutch trader who was one of the few people who got see what was happening in Japan outside Nagasaki.\n\n  From the Japanese side, I can only think that Arai Hakuseki&#39;s memoirs might be useful.  \n   \n  As always, my favorite general history of Japan is George Sansom&#39;s Three vol history from the beginning of time through the Meiji Resotration.  There is a brief overview of Tsunayoshi&#39;s career at the beginning of chapter XI.\n   \n  I hope this is a help to you. I would be interested in hearing what others might have to say about these sources. \nGillian Rubinstein &lt;gillian@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;     firstly i am after literature- published workd, or websites- \ncontaining \n&gt; information on the life of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1680-1709). The \nfifth \n&gt; Tokugawa Shogun. \n\nHave been waiting to see if anyone else would answer this as I also find \nTsunayoshi a fascinating character and would like to know more about \nhim. Marius Jansen writes a bit about him in The Making of Modern \nJapan (Harvard UP 2002) &quot;in this case, birth from a plebeian (but highly \nintelligent and famously beautiful) mother and an independent \nupbringing that was not geared for heading the bakufu produced a \nstrong-willed and intelligent, albeit idiosyncratic, shogun.&quot;\n\nJansen&#39;s sources are: Donald Shively &quot;Tokugawa Tsuyanoshi, the \nGenroku Shogun&#39; in Craig and Shively &quot;Personality in Japanese History \nand\nBeatrice Bodart-Bailey &quot;The Laws of Compassion&quot; in Mon Nip 40/2\n\nJansen is very good, in the same book, on the Genroku period, and has \nsome information on the Shoheiko Academy, the bakufu school, \nthough he does not indicate that this was founded by Tsunayoshi.\n\nI guess for insights into contemporary culture the plays of Chikamatsu \nwould be invaluable. Donald Shively has written on this too.\n\nThere is also a very good book called Edo Culture by Nishiyama \nMatsunosuke (U of Hawaii Press 1997). It has all sorts of interesting \ninformation on food, cooking, travel, theatre and music, and so on. Not \nmany references to Tsunayoshi but one of them tells of the Kashima \nOracle&#39;s denunciation of the dog kennels and bad policies of the Dog \nShogun.\n\nThere must be lots of Japanese biographies of him - maybe even a \ntaiga :)\n\nplease post any other information that you&#39;ve discovered.\n\nThanks,\n\nGillian\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
