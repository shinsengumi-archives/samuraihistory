Bryant&#39;s books\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 21 Feb 2002 20:54:55 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Not to attack the sacred cow, but Turnbull can definately not be accused \n&gt;of\n&gt; &gt;being an acedemic, or a &#39;true&#39; historian.  Many of his books are filled\n&gt; &gt;with small errors and innaccuracies that he very obviously took verbatim\n&gt; &gt;from Papinot - although he NEVER mentions Papinot in his sources...\n&gt; &gt;Looking at his books, his information, and his sources together, one has \n&gt;to\n&gt; &gt;wonder if he can even read Japanese at all...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;*ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of \n&gt;Inabayama\n&gt; &gt;took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in Japanese,\n&gt; &gt;including a few he lists in his bibliography state it happened in 1567.  \n&gt;So\n&gt; &gt;you may be thinking, &#39;what&#39;s two or three years?&#39;  Well, what if I told \n&gt;you\n&gt; &gt;the battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;You could write a treatise on just the errors and uncited Papinot sources\n&gt; &gt;alone.  Not to mention a picture listed as an &#39;authors representation&#39; of\n&gt; &gt;something that actually looks suspiciously like a tracing of a picture in \n&gt;a\n&gt; &gt;Rekishi gunzo book. (Dont have his book or the Gunzo book on hand right \n&gt;now\n&gt; &gt;to cite which one)\n&gt; &gt;Guess because he&#39;s the only game in town he thinks he doesn&#39;t have to \n&gt;work\n&gt; &gt;at it anymore...?  I&#39;ve seen him mentioned as Stephen &quot;buy my books&quot;\n&gt; &gt;Turnbull in some post before, and I can see why.  Just take a look at his\n&gt; &gt;website.  You can&#39;t help but get the impression scholarship takes a\n&gt; &gt;definate backseat to profit.  guess I can&#39;t really blame the guy, though.\n&gt; &gt;Gotta put food on the table somehow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Anyway, I&#39;d rather read &#39;dry&#39; histories if they are more accurate than\n&gt; &gt;&#39;popular&#39; histories, although I&#39;d prefer to read an accurate popular\n&gt; &gt;history! (like A.J. Bryant&#39;s stuff!  At least you get the impression that\n&gt; &gt;he has a real interest in the subject, and can actually read japanese, \n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt;actually puts in the research!)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Oh well, just a rant on my part, and I could very well be totally wrong.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;MarshMan6423 is writing to u!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\nMarshMan6423 is writing to u!!\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com\n\n\n"
