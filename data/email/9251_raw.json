A modern analogy would be\nthe old, crusty Colonel who refuses to give up his .45\ncaliber pistol, despite the fact that the Army has\nused the 9mm Beretta M9 for decades now. (this is a\ntrue story, by the way--I know the guy, and he caused\nhis officer in charge of ordering ammunition all kinds\nof heartache trying to find .45 rounds for the darn\nthing.) While unusual, there&#39;s nothing that would\nactually prevent someone from carrying a tetsubo in\n1583, to use Tom&#39;s example of Shizugatake. The guy\nwould probably have thought he was being a badass.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
