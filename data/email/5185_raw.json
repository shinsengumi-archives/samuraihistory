Of\ncourse there were covert messages between Katsuyori\nand said administrator. Incidentally, it&#39;s killing me\nthat I can&#39;t remember his name. For some reason Ota\nYasusuke sticks in my head, but that&#39;s wrong--Yasusuke\nwas a Hojo retainer. I&#39;m currently not able to get to\nmy crutch, the Turnbull book on Nagashino, and when\nthe first hit on Google that comes up is a report that\nI myself wrote (and neglected to mention the name),\nI&#39;m out of luck. \n\n&gt; But I know, I know ... I think the reality is a lot\n&gt; more drab and \n&gt; dreary than we would like, with the occasional\n&gt; flashes of \n&gt; adventure!\n\nGenerally I find reality more interesting. I&#39;d rather\nread about how someone bribed the maid of Lord\nso-and-so to gain access to a room where they\noverheard x conversation, then snuck out dressed as a\nmonk and such, than to hear some silly story about\nsneaking in dressed in black pajamas, killing guards\nwith magical incantations, then disappearing in a\ncloud of smoke. Bah.\n\n\n&gt; In the Cold War days wasn&#39;t &#39;journalist&#39; the \n&gt; common cover? I suppose a Tendai Monk walking the\n&gt; streets of Prague or Vienna to the Harry Lime theme \n&gt; would have stuck out a bit...\n\nPossibly, yeah. However, speaking as a member of the\nUS Intel community, the &quot;journalist&quot; cover is frowned\nupon, though it was used. Too easy to get into\ntrouble. At least you didn&#39;t say Red Cross worker or\nPriest--both of those are right out. \n\n&gt; &gt; Exploding Geisha? I&#39;d pay Y1500 for that ticket!\n&gt; \n&gt; And Tom Cruise could play Shingen!\n\nYou&#39;re trying to give me a heart attack, aren&#39;t you? \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
