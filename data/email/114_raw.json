Do you have any interesting \n&gt; pictures?\n\n\nI&#39;ve uploaded 3 pictures to this list that I had on hand, available \nat the &#39;files&#39; link on the righthand side of the listserve homepage.  \nI can&#39;t find any other of my pictures at the moment, but these were \ntaken at the remains of a caslte in Saiki, Oita prefecture, Japan.  I \ndon&#39;t remember the name of the castle, but I believe it predates the \nSengoku period.  I have to assume that the remains are mostly \nfoundation, because I am under the impression that Japanese castles \nused more wood than European ones.  The &#39;viewfromcastle&#39; picture is \njust that - a view from the castle, just to give an idea of location. \nit had a 360 degree view of the surrounding area, and the hike to the \ntop is a steep, winding and wooded road, ideal for defense.\n\nIt wasn&#39;t until I returned to the USA and took a Japanese Art History \nclass did I learn to take multiple pictures of the same \nbuilding/object from different angles for later study - that helped \nme out later when I returned to Kyoto, but I have yet to return to \nKyushu to get more pics of the castles...\n\nCEWest\n\n\n"
