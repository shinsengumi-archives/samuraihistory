Pretty much all samurai had swords, but they  \nfrequently had something else as their primary weapon. Also, as Tony  \npointed out, before the sword hunts at the end of the sixteenth  \ncentury, lots of peasants had swords. Further, before the end of the  \nsixteenth century, the distinction between peasant and samurai could  \nbe a bit blurry as the &quot;ji-samurai&quot; engaged in farming.\n\n\n\n"
