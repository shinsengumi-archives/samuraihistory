It&#39;s all in good fun, don&#39;t try to read\ntoo much into it. \n\nOkay, here goes. I&#39;ve got many choices (and by the\nway, I&#39;m reading this as who would I wish to have the\nsame circumstances befall me historically and try to\nlive up to what they did. Good compromise?)\n\nBeing an ex-tanker, Patton is always a choice...love\nthat guy. Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse, just to see\nCuster&#39;s face as an arrow went through his\nhead...(despite my being a member of 7th Cavalry\nRegiment...Garryowen in Glory) Maybe MacArthur or\nRidgeway, to see the Korean War ended right, unlike\nthe situation now. \n\nI&#39;d have to say my top choice would be Oda Nobunaga,\nand not just because we&#39;re on the Samurai list. What a\nfascinating man! I&#39;d love to walk in his shoes for a\nlittle while, see what went on in his mind. He, in my\nmind, was the absolute master at integrating tactical,\noperational, and strategic levels of warfare. Just to\nglimpse into his decision making process, his\nanalysis, his IPB...wow. I&#39;d say Hashiba Hideyoshi\nwould be another good choice--not Toyotomi, but\nHashiba Hideyoshi, so I could examine his\ncommander/subordinate relationship with Nobunaga, and\nfigure out why these two opposites worked so well\ntogether. \n\nJust my two yen...it is a rather silly, yet\ninteresting question. C&#39;mon, Tony...don&#39;t be so\nanalytical!!!! \n\nNate\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
