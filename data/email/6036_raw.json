This is my final attempt to prove\n&gt; to you all there is such a strong link between the\n&gt; 2.\n\nNo one has said that there was no link between the\ncurrent martial art of Karate and it&#39;s philosophical\nunderpinnings, and the concept of bushido. What has\nbeen put forth is about its ORIGINS, not the\ndevelopmental path it has taken as an art. Are you\ndenying that it was originally developed by peasants?\nBecause if you are not, then I have no idea why you\nare being argumentative. No one has argued against\nyour thesis stated above. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
