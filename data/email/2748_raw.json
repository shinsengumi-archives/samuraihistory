Quite a few things \nin common with the Samurai.\nAt the same time, some of the UN/US soldiers probably live a very \nsimilar experience.\nSo, I won&#39;t call bushido out as anachronistic, and -even when I will \nNOT suggest it- I suppose that joining the army is the best way to \npractice the &#39;way of the warrior&#39; today.\ncep\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
