It includes the submission of a Code of Conduct. Although \n&gt;you might think all this is rather unnecessary and bureaucratic, believe \n&gt;me, if we are to hang onto our swords and be free to buy, sell and import, \n&gt;this is the sort of thing that we need to do.\n&gt;Comments would be welcome.\n&gt;Regards\n&gt;Clive Sinclaire\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;  All new Yahoo!
