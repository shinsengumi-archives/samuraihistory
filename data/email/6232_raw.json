Ok im a little curious about samurai funerals. erm what i would like to know is on how a Samurai ( or retainers) funeral day is likw, eg what type of wake is there? Whom is present? how the body is buried or cremated? Is it a sorrowful affair or joyful? and how does a normal funeral differ from someone that is forced to commit seppuku ( spelt wrong but very tired), thanks all i enjoy your comments (most times lol)\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
