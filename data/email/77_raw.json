Otherwise, any self-respecting\n&gt; &gt; japanese video store in america will have at least the most recent\n&gt; &gt; taiga dramas available - although minus the subtitles.\n&gt; \n\nWHen I lived in the Bay Area (up until 1998) it was on Channel 26 on Saturday\nand Sunday nights.  the samurai dramas were usually Sunday at 9PM.\n\nbest, Mark Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n"
