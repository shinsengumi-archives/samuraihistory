This is a legit question to any and all scholars out there\n&gt; with access to the right sources.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I was researching over in the university library and there is a\n&gt; notable lack of english sources concerning japanese tactics on a\n&gt; squad-based level in sengoku and muromachi feudal combat.  One I \ncame\n&gt; across giving brief information on the matter was &quot;Samurai, Warfare\n&gt; and the State in Early Medieval Japan (Warfare and History)&quot; by Karl\n&gt; F. Friday, his newest book.  It concerns earlier medieval warfare and,\n&gt; to be realistic, only revealed minimal on the subject (as there are\n&gt; probably little surviving primary sources to draw from).  \n&gt; \n&gt; I got the basic impression that, like many other medieval combat\n&gt; affairs, an army&#39;s maneovering capabilities were not as impressive as\n&gt; may be assumed.  When, if at all, combat was joined, samurai moved \non\n&gt; a squad level, rather independent and not too unlike their european\n&gt; knight-errant counterparts.  It was so, according to Friday, because\n&gt; this small squad would most likely be the same samurai who they\n&gt; locally trained with and thus knew most intimately in terms of\n&gt; tactical capabilities.  I was wondering if anyone else has access to\n&gt; sources going in-depth on this topic, and if they could briefly\n&gt; describe their impressions on the subject.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
