And - to make things clearer, Ako had 380 samurai: \nonly 47 sacrificed their lives...\n\n&gt; If true can anyone provide enlightenment?\n&gt; Who was their lord and why did they become Ronin?\n\nLord Asano of Ako. He had to commit seppuku, and there go your Ronin.\n\n&gt; Who was their\n&gt; target?\n\nKira, a corrupted Master of ceremonies.\n\n&gt; Is it true the only 48 were given a samurai&#39;s death?\n\nAs far as I know, they were 47+one who gave up the night before (to \nbonk repeatedly his girlfriend). The 47 committed ritual seppuku, the \nbonker just killed himself in a backstreet of Edo.\n\n&gt; Where\n&gt; are they buried?\n\nWith Lord Asano, at Sengaku temple, Tokyo.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d be grateful for any relevant information.\n&gt;\n&gt; Keyoke.\n\nI strongly suggest you check out the movie &quot;Chushingura,&quot; the version \nmade in the 6os, with Toshiro Mifune. It&#39;s available on DVD. If you&#39;re \nnot into masochism, check out the 1941-42 version - more than 4 hours, \nand you do not ever see the assault on Kira&#39;s mansion!!! The one with \nKim-taku (titled 47/1) is funny, but highly inaccurate. Finally, the \nbest version on paper is the bunraku libretto, translated by Donald \nKeene. If I am not wrong, the bunraku play was out in Edo TWO WEEKS \nafter the real event took place!\n\nHope it helped,\nBye!\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
