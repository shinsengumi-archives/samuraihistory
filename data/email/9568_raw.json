Although the stor=\r\ny in the film is significantly different from \nwhat actually transpired in =\r\n1877, I found a few themes to be common. \nFirst, the origin of the Satsuma =\r\nrebellion was in the dissatisfaction \nof the samurai at the ending of their=\r\n way of life. Secondly, as with \nKen Watanabe in the movie, Saigo Takamori =\r\ndid indeed have deep \nrespect for the emperor. Finally, the failure of Saig=\r\no&#39;s rebellion \nwas partially due to the fact that he was fighting in an old=\r\n Japanese \nstyle, while the Meiji government had westernized their methods.=\r\n \nHowever, it was not really western weapons versus Japanese weapons on \nth=\r\ne battlefields of the Satsuma rebellion, since both sides used \nguns. Rathe=\r\nr, the Meiji government made much better use of western-\nstyle logistics (r=\r\neinforcements) and communications (the telegraph). \nThe Meiji government wa=\r\ns able to get Saigo bogged down in Kumamoto, \nwhile they sent in reinforcem=\r\nents and eventually overwhelmed him at \nTabaru-zaka.\n\nJoe\n\n--- In samuraihi=\r\nstory@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , jonathan =\r\nellgen &lt;jpellgen@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree there were historical mistakes, b=\r\nut it was a movie and not \nintended to be a documentary or re-enactment. I =\r\nwas actually quite \npleased with the film despite its short-comings. I felt=\r\n that it \ncaptured several powerful emotions which may have been present at=\r\n \nthose last moments of samurai existence. \n&gt; \n&gt; But some of the things you=\r\n mentioned really don&#39;t bother me. For \nexample, the suggestion that an out=\r\nsider would be taken in the way \nTom Cruise&#39;s character was... That is obvi=\r\nously part of what makes \nthe story interesting, not particularly anything =\r\nhistorical. We know \nthat William Adams was taken in, as you alluded too, b=\r\nut that hardly \nwould make it a common thing. As far as seppuku is concerne=\r\nd, there \nwas really no end to what type of bladed instrument a samurai mig=\r\nht \nhave used. \n&gt; \n&gt; So, while I agree that it isn&#39;t the best source of his=\r\ntorical \ninformation, I still found it to be acceptable from an entertainme=\r\nnt \npoint of view. Film is a much more widely accepted form of media than \n=\r\nanime, and I am fairly confident that more English-speaking people \nwere wi=\r\nlling to watch Tom Cruise than watch Japanimation. Cruise&#39;s \ncharacter was,=\r\n afterall, a civil war captain... Not necessarily a \nsamurai. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jonatha=\r\nn P.
