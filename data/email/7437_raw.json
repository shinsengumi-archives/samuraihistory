SHIN\nDAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER \nWednesday, August 3rd, 2005 \n\nKeeping alive the martial traditions of the samurai has been a \nlifelong labor of love for Shozo Kato - a devotion that doesn&#39;t take \na break even for the dog days of summer.\nKato, 50, is one of the highest ranking U.S. practitioners of kendo -\n a form of fencing descended from the swordsmanship of feudal Japan. \nThe immigrant from Hiroshima recently celebrated the 20th \nanniversary of his dojo, Shidogakuin (www.kendoka.org).\n\nEven on the most sweltering of days, Kato and his students can be \nfound working up a fierce sweat - dueling with bamboo foils under \ntheir traditional armor and uniforms at their dojo near the UN \nheadquarters in Manhattan.\n\n&quot;Kendo is not just about training the body, but the spirit also,&quot; \nsaid Kato, an art photographer by day. &quot;Until high school, I did \nkendo because it was exciting, because I wanted to win. But after I \nmet [high-ranking] sensei, I saw that kendo is also an art.&quot;\n\nIn New York and across the country, kendo has seen a steady rise in \nmembership, with recent spikes in interest in the wake of such \nmovies as &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill.&quot;\n\nAnd though A-list stars Tom Cruise and Uma Thurman may have amped up \nthe glamor of Japanese swordplay, Kato&#39;s beginnings as a kendo \ninstructor here were far from glamorous.\n\nIn the early days, finding a space to practice was a challenge \nbecause potential landlords were often scared away by the stomping \nand shouting required in kendo.\n\nThe noise even caused a brush with the law a few years after Kato \nopened a dojo at 21st St. and Sixth Ave., when neighbors called the \ncops after hearing the screams of one of Kato&#39;s female students - an \nopera soprano with a powerful set of pipes.\n\nKendo is great exercise, but its deep appeal lies in its sublime \nmental game that draws heavily from Zen philosophy, said Debi \nFarmer, a former personal trainer and graphic artist who has been a \nstudent of Kato&#39;s for 12 years.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s about timing, with an understanding of the weapon. Power and \nspeed are only going to last when you&#39;re young,&quot; said Farmer.\n\nKato is one of only two American instructors who holds the rank of \nseventh dan - or seventh-degree black belt - in both kendo and iaido \n(pronounced ee-EYE-doh), a companion art in which practitioners \nlearn how to draw and cut with a katana, the traditional Japanese \nsword.\n\nIn kendo and iaido, the sword is a tool of self-refinement rather \nthan a weapon, Kato said. &quot;The sword makes people&#39;s lives happy,&quot; he \nsaid. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n"
