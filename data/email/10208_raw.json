As far as I know those who did own their own =\r\nhorses were allowed to use them for personal travel as they wished. As far =\r\nas the type of horse, I do not know what they are called in technical terms=\r\n, but the horses of Sengoku period Japan were much smaller than the horses =\r\nnow. They were closer to ponies in size, they may actually be categorized a=\r\ns ponies I am not sure, that were originally from the plains of central Asi=\r\na. When you consider that the average height of a Japanese man at the time =\r\nwas shorter than the average height of a Japanese woman today then the thou=\r\nght of them on a modern sized race horse, like those used in yabusame today=\r\n, is kind of an amusing thought. \n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, C=\r\nearb@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All--\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been looking into how folks go=\r\nt around in Sengoku-era Japan, and wondered if anyone on the forum could pr=\r\novide some clarity.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Specifically: was travel pretty much always on f=\r\noot?  Were horses reserved for military use / use as pack animals?  Would a=\r\n samurai on his master&#39;s business or personal travel have ridden?  (Some of=\r\n the artwork I&#39;ve seen from later ages does show both mounted samurai and w=\r\nalking retainers -- was this the exception?)\n&gt; \n&gt; And, if they did travel b=\r\ny horse, what sort of horses would they have ridden?  (A quick Google searc=\r\nh shows me that a lot of people on the internet are asking these questions,=\r\n but reliable answers are scarce.)\n&gt; \n&gt; As always, any assistance would be =\r\nGREATLY appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; --R Michael Burns  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text porti=\r\nons of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
