For instance, a sword from the often flamboyant \nOsaka Shinto\n&gt; school quite obviously reflects the somewhat brash nature of that \ncity at\n&gt; the time. However, I think in many ways this is similar to seeing \nthe\n&gt; tortured emotions of Van Gogh in one of his paintings. But to \nattribute this\n&gt; to a mystical force is probably ill-advised in this day and age.\n\nI have to agree with the above.  Arguing about spiritual \notherworldly forces and divine powers in this situation is \napparently tantamount to arguing about religion. Some believe, some \ndon&#39;t, and there is no way to prove it one way or the other.  I \nthink it is reasonable to say that a crafted sword is a work of art, \nand many people attribute power and emotion to works of art - i.e. \nVan Gogh&#39;s angst.  It is actually quite subjective.  One can &quot;sense&quot; \npower in a sword - but that is very likely because of the symbolism \nof the sword in both Japanese history and world history as well.  We \nLOOK for it. Carl Jung talked about symbolism and the subconcious, \nhumans look for symbolism - objectively speaking a piece of sharp \nmetal should invoke nothing, but subjectively the sword is a symbol \nof power, that can invoke various emotions and feelings.\nI agree that swords are awe inspiring and have an aura about them \nbecause of the history and symbolism, but I think it is reasonable \nto say that a sword doesn&#39;t contain otherworldly spiritual energy.  \nBut again, arguing something like this is tantamount to arguing \nreligion, and will go nowhere.\nSo everyone can feel free to go back and forth on this, but I find \nit doubtful that this will go anywhere too useful.\n\n\n\n\n"
