The Code of Bushido, which was a set of ten \n&gt;    ideals =\r\nfor samurai set down for all with a sword to follow. I think \n&gt;    they wer=\r\ne given to someone by one of the Kami or gods/goddesses, \n&gt;    but I can&#39;t =\r\nquite remember the specifics. Go ahead and e-mail me if \n&gt;    you need any =\r\nmore specifics on the subject.

Although not laws \n&gt;    if I had to choose t=\r\nwo things that were expected of a samurai in \n&gt;    all places and times it =\r\nwould be, obedience and loyalty these \n&gt;    things were core to what a samu=\r\nrai should be, the word samurai even \n&gt;    means &quot;to serve&quot;.\n&gt;    Dave\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n   P.S. Even though a ronin had no lord to serve and be loyal and \n&gt;    obi=\r\nedient to this did not make him any less of a samurai.\n&gt;    =A0 ----- Origi=\r\nnal Message ----- \n&gt;    =A0 From: jeff \n&gt;    =A0 To: samuraihistory@yahoogr=\r\noups.com \n&gt;    =A0 Sent: Friday, October 01, 2004 7:37 PM\n&gt;    =A0 Subject:=\r\n [samuraihistory] laws of samurai\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    =A0 hello im doing a project i n=\r\need to know two laws of a samurai \n&gt;    could \n&gt;    =A0 anyone help\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;    =A0 ---\n&gt;    =A0 Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; =\r\n   =A0 Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;  =\r\n  =A0 --- \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Yahoo!
