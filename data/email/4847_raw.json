The other was headed by\n&gt;&gt; Honda Masanobu, \n&gt;&gt; who wasn&#39;t known as a great warrior (due to an\n&gt;&gt; illness he suffered \n&gt;&gt; during his youth, I vaguely recall reading that this\n&gt;&gt; might have been \n&gt;&gt; polio, but I might be confusing that with Date\n&gt;&gt; Masamune), but \n&gt;&gt; Masanobu acted in a diplomatic and administrative\n&gt;&gt; role for the \n&gt;&gt; Tokugawa. He was also known as a political schemer,\n&gt;&gt; but was very \n&gt;&gt; close to Ieyasu, and later Hidetada. Another fairly\n&gt;&gt; vague \n&gt;&gt; recollection I have is that the founder of Honda\n&gt;&gt; Motor Corp. was \n&gt;&gt; descended from this branch of the family.\n&gt;\n&gt;My understanding, though there is a high chance I&#39;m\n&gt;confused, is that Honda Tadakatsu (\u001b$BK&#92;B?Ci&gt;!!K\u001b(Band Honda\n&gt;Masanobu (\u001b$BK&#92;ED@5?.!K\u001b(Bwere in fact NOT related, as\n&gt;evidenced by the different kanji for &quot;Honda&quot; that you\n&gt;see. What I&#39;m not sure about is the actual kanji for\n&gt;Masanobu&#39;s &quot;Honda&quot;--I&#39;ve seen it both ways, and not\n&gt;sure if it&#39;s just carelessness on one side or the\n&gt;other. I&#39;m currently at work and not able to look for\n&gt;the correct kanji, so if someone could help out?\n&gt;\nI looked in a fairly abriged but well done biographical dictionary I \nhave - \u001b$BF|K&#92;?ML&gt;&lt;-E5\u001b(B by \u001b$B%3%s%5%$%9\u001b(B. It appears that both Tadakatsu \nand Masanobu are written \u001b$BK&#92;B?\u001b(B, and they seem to be vaguely related \nthough it&#39;s not clear how.
