I\n&gt;think the study of Iaido is very important to the deeper understanding of\n&gt;  the martial arts. The selection of the proper Iaito is important. Not\n&gt;quite so important as the selection of Shinken for tamashigiri, but\n&gt;nearly so. As Mr. Helm suggested Bob Elder is a great source. He is a go\n&gt;dan in Toyama Ryu Batto Jutsu. Has his own Dojo. Holds the only Batto Tai\n&gt;Kai outside Japan and owns a martial arts store. We have been friends for\n&gt;many years and will treat you right. He has the selection and pricing\n&gt;with the knowledge to help you very much. He can be reaced at\n&gt;www.ecmas.com or email him at www.ecmas@....\n&gt;Hope this is some help to you.\n&gt;Tom Armour\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________\n&gt;The best thing to hit the internet in years - Juno SpeedBand!\n&gt;Surf the web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!\n&gt;Only $14.95/ month - visit www.juno.com to sign up today!\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  \nhttp://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\n\n\n\n"
