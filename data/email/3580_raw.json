I fully appreciate that the issue of the re-institution o=\r\nf the samurai, or their continued functioning presence within modern Japane=\r\nse society is impossible, even irrational, and the argument is based upon u=\r\nsing a great deal of &quot;what ifs&quot;, but is that a reason for those who have co=\r\nntributed to be told to &quot;give up&quot;?? \nI have enjoyed this forum for over 2 y=\r\nears now, both for the history and culture I have learned, aswell as the pu=\r\nshing-and-pulling between various peoples opinions. There has also been a w=\r\nhole series debates on whether certain authors&#39; books are just rehashes, or=\r\nganizing trips to Kyoto, want-to-be samurai, and sometimes even just plain =\r\nold simple abuse.  Most has been enjoyable, some not so. Not everyone can b=\r\ne interested in the same topics or conversations (however hypothetical), so=\r\n I don&#39;t feel certain members should simply try to put a block on what othe=\r\nr another member, or members, wish to talk about.\nLet the tirades commence.=\r\n\nM.Lorimer \n\nCesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\nOn Feb 2, 2004,=\r\n at 7:19 AM, golfmandan@... wrote:\n\n&gt; It is theoretically possible, tho=\r\nugh, that the class could be \n&gt; restored, either through a legal\n&gt; decision=\r\n, or through a collective revolt by samurai descendents. I&#39;m \n&gt; trying to t=\r\nhink of an\n&gt; historical illustration of this... Can&#39;t. Does anyone else kno=\r\nw of a \n&gt; restoration of a class through\n&gt; revolt or law? In The Three Musk=\r\neteers, this happens with the \n&gt; Musketeers. But that&#39;s fiction,\n&gt; and the =\r\nMusketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there might be some \n&gt; parallels). Loo=\r\nkin&#39; for a real\n&gt; historical example...\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s a different idea...\n&gt; In=\r\n India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real \n&gt; everyda=\r\ny life, the caste\n&gt; system is just as real as it was before the laws. The l=\r\naw only serves \n&gt; its purpose if people obey\n&gt; it, or if it is enforced. So=\r\n it is theoretically possible, also, that \n&gt; descendents of samurai could\n&gt;=\r\n claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would \n&gt; =\r\nfor all intents and\n&gt; purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has bee=\r\nn abolished. Of \n&gt; course, what a samurai\n&gt; today would do or be is ... wel=\r\nl... difficult to imagine. Maybe they \n&gt; would carry two guns instead\n&gt; of =\r\ntwo swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police \n&gt; force.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Theoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the \n&gt; ab=\r\nolishment of the\n&gt; samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and t=\r\nhe public \n&gt; still regarded them as\n&gt; samurai. The government still gave th=\r\nem their stipend, too. \n&gt; (Governments often act in an\n&gt; inconsistent manne=\r\nr like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, \n&gt; would that group of=\r\n\n&gt; people still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I think they would.\n&gt;\n&gt; This has some parallel to the idea of common-law =\r\nmarriages. If a man \n&gt; and woman &quot;shack up&quot;\n&gt; for an extended period of tim=\r\ne, and live as man and wife, even though \n&gt; they have never\n&gt; exchanged vow=\r\ns or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man \n&gt; and wife. That w=\r\nas\n&gt; common practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eventually \n&gt; recogn=\r\nized this and would\n&gt; after said elapse of time pronounce them legally man =\r\nand wife (so the \n&gt; government could get\n&gt; additional taxes out of them).\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the \n&gt; governme=\r\nnt acknowledged\n&gt; them to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one m=\r\nan and wife. \n&gt; It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many\n&gt; cultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of p=\r\naper&quot; from the government to confirm \n&gt; or legitimize the marriage.\n&gt; Publi=\r\nc practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal \n&gt; action.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nSo what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public \n&gt; acce=\r\nptance, apart from\n&gt; law, would in all practicality make one a samurai (lik=\r\ne commonlaw \n&gt; marriage or the Indian caste\n&gt; system), how much of the publ=\r\nic would it take to justify that claim? \n&gt; What&#39;s the critical mass\n&gt; requi=\r\nred for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in \n&gt; the samur=\r\nai&#39;s heyday,\n&gt; there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as =\r\nit was. \n&gt; Maybe 51%? A simple\n&gt; majority? Who decides what the percentage =\r\nwould be?\n&gt;\n&gt; All this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today... but theor=\r\netically, \n&gt; it&#39;s possible.\n\nHonestly, I do not understand the meaning of t=\r\nhe whole discussion. \nTheoretically, you can speculate, but it makes no sen=\r\nse at all.\n\nModern Japan is a democracy, and classes have nothing to do wit=\r\nh it. \nThere is no way the government is going to pay a salary to samurai \n=\r\ndescendants, no way people could go around the country carrying \nweapons, a=\r\nnd once again I remind you that to be a samurai means to \n***SERVE*** a lor=\r\nd.\nSo, who will they serve? Shogun Koizumi?\n\nMoreover, the comparison with =\r\nIndia does not hold up. India is a 75% \nrural country, a pseudo-democracy, =\r\nand a country where the great \nmajority of people are Hindu: classes are de=\r\nfined by religion.\n\nThus, unlike in Japan, Indian society is still structur=\r\ned on a vertical \naxis, especially at the village level. Japan has vertical=\r\n relationships \nin schools, companies, etc. but NOT in its constitution. Th=\r\ne vertical \nrelationships in Japan are of a microcosmic nature, and do not =\r\npermeate \nsociety as a whole.\n\nFinally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not =\r\nyet mollified by Western \ninfluences and got rid of  Buddhism.\n\nThese are t=\r\nhe reasons why Hindu ideology can still continue. (And of \ncourse -as usual=\r\n- there are economic reasons as well.)\n\nAnd talking about economy, being th=\r\ne second wealthiest country in the \nworld, having schools, hospitals, Panas=\r\nonics and Toyotas, do you think \nthe Japanese would care a bit about restor=\r\ning a medieval social class?\n\nGuys: give up.\nLet&#39;s stop confounding history=\r\n with reactionary science fiction.\n\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this messa=\r\nge have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.=\r\ncom\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n=\r\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
