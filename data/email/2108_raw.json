Did Hanzo have a nephew (or uncle)\n&gt; known as the demon Hanzo or is that a mistranslation\n&gt; of Ghost? I know there are very subtle differences\n&gt; in the Japanese language and Demon does not\n&gt; neccessarily  imply Evil.In the Shinto faith there\n&gt; seem to be about a million Demons or spirits for\n&gt; every thing under the sun. Was the Iga Ryu ever\n&gt; formally known as the Shadows of Iga or is that a\n&gt; modern group-I know they exist now as a self defence\n&gt; school decended from Steven Hayes..............I\n&gt; understand that Women were used at some point in\n&gt; Intelligence and &quot;informant&quot; type positions- when\n&gt; did that start?(If I am correct)  thanx - EJ  \n&gt; \n&gt; Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:Hi \n&gt; \n&gt; hanzo hattori did not use women in any way.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was a senior advisor regrading Ninja style\n&gt; activities to Tokugawa ieyasu\n&gt; \n&gt; this is what I have on Hanzo Hattori\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hanzo Hattori came from the Kamihattori branch of\n&gt; the\n&gt; Hattori family. It is not fully known if he came\n&gt; from\n&gt; the Heitaro or the Chigachi line (another branch of\n&gt; the Kamihattori family).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the\n&gt; three branches of the Hattori family dispersed to\n&gt; different area&#39;s of Japan. The Kamihattori fled to\n&gt; Nagaoka in Echigo Hattori Masanari, and his son \n&gt; Hattori Hanzo (both from the Kamihattori), swore\n&gt; allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while working\n&gt; for\n&gt; the Tokugawa held the rank of &#39;Shinobi Metsuke&#39;, and\n&gt; he had served Ieyasu&#39;s grandfather Matsudaira\n&gt; Kiyoyasu. Hanzo later, with a friend, Shiro Tarao\n&gt; who\n&gt; was a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa Ieyasu flee across\n&gt; Japan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely,\n&gt; utilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting\n&gt; up\n&gt; special defensive formations along the road, and by\n&gt; using Ninja methods of running. This all helped the\n&gt; Tokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. The Hattori\n&gt; were not &quot;Watari Ninja&quot; (Ninja who moved around from\n&gt; one Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the\n&gt; Tokugawa, and remained in their service for many\n&gt; generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at\n&gt; night, Hanzo was young man of 16 years. For the\n&gt; skills\n&gt; that he used during the battle, he earned himself a\n&gt; commendation. He was given the name &quot;Hanzo the\n&gt; Ghost&quot;.\n&gt; Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the\n&gt; province of Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely\n&gt; in\n&gt; use. In his later years Hanzo was also known as\n&gt; &quot;Hanzo\n&gt; the great lancer&quot; (Yari no Hanzo).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi\n&gt; Samurai,\n&gt; and then came to be known as &quot;Hattori Hanzo Iwami no\n&gt; Kami&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; At one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with\n&gt; him,\n&gt; each held the rank of Doshin. He developed problems\n&gt; with these Ninja and he found it difficult to\n&gt; control\n&gt; them, and he relieved them of their services. He\n&gt; then\n&gt; employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in\n&gt; his life, he became a Monk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hanzo Hattori was so famous that in the province of\n&gt; Mikawa songs were written about him\n&gt; \n&gt; Some say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th\n&gt; December 1596, while trying to bring the Ninja of\n&gt; the\n&gt; Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must be wrong as Hanzo\n&gt; helped Ieyasu in the early 1600&quot;s. The story of his\n&gt; death says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two\n&gt; protruding\n&gt; teeth), and his Fuma Ryu originally came from\n&gt; Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and his men chased\n&gt; the\n&gt; Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf of\n&gt; Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of\n&gt; water, and several swam under water, and began\n&gt; dismantling the rudders of the boats belonging to\n&gt; Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo&#39;s men\n&gt; decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by\n&gt; shore. When they entered the water, they discovered\n&gt; that the water was covered with oil. To which the\n&gt; Fuma\n&gt; Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the Tokugawa\n&gt; Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; paul Richardson\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
