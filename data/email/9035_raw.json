I&#39;ve been intere=\r\nsted in the \nJapanese Invasion of Korea for a while now.   In fact, I&#39;ve po=\r\nsted a very \ndetailed bibliography about the Imjin War to the group&#39;s files=\r\n.\n\n     The Korean TV miniseries about Admiral Yi is being released on DVD =\r\nnext \nweek.   It&#39;s a two box set.   Originally, it was only going to be rel=\r\neased on \nRegion 3 format (Southeast Asia) which meant we wouldn&#39;t be able =\r\nto watch it \non US DVD players.\n\n     I don&#39;t know if my inquiry had anythi=\r\nng to do with it, but after I \ninquired about the series I was told that it=\r\n was going to be released on an All \nRegion format, so we will be able to w=\r\natch it here in the US.\n\n     Here&#39;s the website if you want to read about =\r\nit &lt;\nhttp://www.dvdfromkorea.com/&gt;.   Just do a search for &quot;Admiral Yi&quot;.\n\nB=\r\nob Burke\n\n\nIn a message dated 8/11/06 4:39:14 AM, tokyodog@... writes:\n=\r\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Bob.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the email question on the Hideyoshi biogra=\r\nphy. Berry&#39;s book does \n&gt; discuss somewhat the Korean invasions, but the au=\r\nthor does not go into \n&gt; intricate detail of the Korean invasions. She does=\r\n not focus on blow by blow of the \n&gt; battles in Korea. She focuses far more=\r\n on the battles within Japan to \n&gt; consolidate Hideyoshi&#39;s power over Japan=\r\n itself, and his forming alliances within \n&gt; Japan. She also focuses more o=\r\nn when Hideyoshi was willing to show clemency \n&gt; even with defeated foes, l=\r\nike Chosokabe Motochika in Shikoku and Sassa Narimasa \n&gt; in Hokuriku. (Of c=\r\nourse, the clemency toward Sassa didn=E2=80=99t last long, as he \n&gt; was for=\r\nced to commit suicide some time later.) She also of course describes \n&gt; the=\r\n more brutal, ruthless side of Hideyoshi, where he defeats and destroys \n&gt; =\r\nShibata Katsuie, and others. She also spends time discussing the social \n&gt; =\r\ntransformation of the disarming of the peasants and monks, as well as the s=\r\ntripping \n&gt; the samurai of their land. She describes how all of these moves=\r\n were designed \n&gt; to stabilize the country by making rebellion by peasants =\r\nand monks less \n&gt; likely. Also, by stripping samurai of land, the samurai t=\r\nhemselves became more dep\n&gt; endent on their lords and daimyo, also making s=\r\namurai less likely to make \n&gt; trouble independent of their daimyo. So the d=\r\naimyo gave up some independence to \n&gt; Hideyoshi as the supreme central powe=\r\nr, but the daimyo also acquired a certain \n&gt; new power vis-=C3=A0-vis those=\r\n peasants and samurai below them on the social \n&gt; hierarchy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you ha=\r\nve a particular interest in Korea, or in those particular Japanese \n&gt; invas=\r\nions of Korea?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; www.nihonshi. www\n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/11/200=\r\n6, &quot;BURKER1@...&quot; &lt;BURKER1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Mike,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How much =\r\ncoverage does the book give to the Imjin War (the Japanese\n&gt; &gt;invasion of K=\r\norea)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Bob Burke\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In a message dated 8/10/06 4:07:35 PM, t=\r\nokyodog@... writes:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The Japan his=\r\ntory reading group, Nihonshi, has just completed reading the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tale of G=\r\nenji. Now this month, we are reading Mary Elizabeth Berry&#39;s bio \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nHideyoshi. I&#39;ve finished reading Berry&#39;s book, and it is excellent. I&#39;ve\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; posted a summary of Hideyoshi&#39;s life at the group website. If any of you=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; notice any inaccuracies or have any suggested amendments to my \n&gt; des=\r\ncription\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Hideyoshi&#39;s life on the Nihonshi website, please email me.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The group&#39;s website is here.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.nihonshihttp:/=\r\n/www.http &lt;http://www.nihonshihttp://wwwhttp&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, anyone who wi=\r\nshes can certainly subscribe to the Nihonshi group and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; join us in our =\r\nreading of Japan&#39;s history.
