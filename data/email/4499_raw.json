Please review the daimyos of Hizen province, including Arima \n&gt;&gt; and Omura clans in the 16th Centure. It was the daimyo Omura who \n&gt;&gt; granted the Portugese Nagasaki port. And the ties with the Portugese \n&gt;&gt; in Nagasaki and Omura. There&#39;s even a St. Omura in the Catholic faith \n&gt;&gt; who is a canonized Saint. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You misread my message (or I miswrote the intention). Nobunaga was \n&gt;&gt; the daimyo in \n&gt;&gt; the greatest position to do good things for the Christians. Yes, \n&gt;&gt; there were \n&gt;&gt; daimyo in Kyushu and elsewhere who converted, but they had little \n&gt;&gt; effect outside \n&gt;&gt; their own domains. Nobunaga was quite different in his sphere of \n&gt;&gt; influence. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tony \n&gt; \n&gt;I think Nobunaga was interested in Christianity mainly for two reasons: \n&gt;1 - Guns. The Portuguese missionaries (and the merchants that arrived \n&gt;with them) brought some, and promised more. I have even read somewhere \n&gt;(but not sure, perhaps the experts of this list can confirm) that \n&gt;Nobunaga wore a Portuguese armor, at times. \n&gt;2 - Nobunaga hated organized Buddhism, not the religion or the \n&gt;philosophy, but the &quot;Buddhist posse&quot; (the ikki). Christianity was thus \n&gt;a convenient &#39;alternative.&#39; \n&gt;I really doubt Nobunaga was interested in the Christian ideals, \n&gt;nonetheless he seemed to have an interest for things from the West, \n&gt;especially if they could give him a political-ideological or martial \n&gt;advantage. \n&gt; \n&gt;cepo \n&gt; \n\n_________________________________________________________\nVoce quer um iGMail protegido contra v�rus e spams? \nClique aqui: http://www.igmailseguro.ig.com.br\nOfertas imperd�veis!
