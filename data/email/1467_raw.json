I&#39;d just add that &quot;Oyakata-\nsama&quot; seems to be used by lower ranking samurai towards thier lord \nwhere &quot;Tono&quot; seems to be used by the higher ranking samurai towards \nthe lord. but I&#39;m also basing my guesses on the various japanese \nsamurai drama I&#39;ve seen. \n\nI KNOW there are others here who should be able to hazzard a guess as \nwell....! (Including at least a small handful of people who have \nactually read sengoku-era documents)\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;iganokami &lt;intp@m...&gt;&quot; \n&lt;intp@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Here&#39;s my guess based on years of watching NHK taiga dramas (and \n&gt; since a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, hopefully there will \n&gt; be others here to confirm or deny my thoughts).\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t recall hearing ~San, but I do remember hearing ~Han used on \n&gt; Samurai in Sengoku period Kyoto/Kansai, so ~San might have been in \n&gt; use in other places...(?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tono or Oyakatasama seems to be used to address a lord directly \n(from \n&gt; samurai to lord), and I think Tono-sama is used to refer to the \nlord \n&gt; when talking to someone else (I don&#39;t know the difference in usage \n&gt; between Oyakatasama and Tono when speaking to a lord, but I think \n&gt; Oyakatasama is even more polite (or puts the lord higher up) \n&gt; than &#39;Tono&#39;.... \n&gt; \n&gt; I think that when &#39;equal&#39; samurai speak with each other, they seem \nto \n&gt; stick ~Dono on the end (Hayashi-dono) etc.  And I think -Sama is \nused \n&gt; this way as well.\n&gt; All this goes for higher up samurai, as most Taiga drama and others \n&gt; mainly deal with that level. I have no idea how ashigaru address \neach \n&gt; other.  \n&gt; \n&gt; hopefully others here can clarify - now I&#39;m curious. But another \n&gt; option in fiction would be to scrap the Japanese titles altogether \n&gt; and use the english equivalents (Lord Hayashi) (Yes, my lord) stuff \n&gt; like that...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Davidson \n&gt; &lt;thomas@t...&gt;&quot; &lt;thomas@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m seeking clarification on forms of address within samurai \n&gt; &gt; circles in the late Sengoku era.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Was &quot;san&quot; used in this period?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is the proper usage of the term &quot;sama&quot;?
