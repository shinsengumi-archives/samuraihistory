I believe Donald Richie has been recently honored in just such \n  a way. However, these awards are not to be construed with knighthood or \n  samurai status.\n        The samurai (with all due respect can we use bushi or buke?) were \n  abolished as a class in the 1870&#39;s by the Emperor&#39;s own government and \n  with the stroke of the Emperor&#39;s own pen(seal). No one can convince me \n  that 8 foreigners have been given the privileges of the class while \n  legitimate descendants of buke families are denied same!\n\n\n  -t\n\n\n  Surely if the Emperor needed the help of the World Full Contact Karate \n  champion so much so that he knighted him, wouldn&#39;t he keep him close at \n  hand? If anything did happen he would be too late to help if travelling \n  from Manchester!?!\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n\n\n  Yahoo!
