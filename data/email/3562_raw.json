I&#39;m \n&gt; trying to think of an\n&gt; historical illustration of this... Can&#39;t. Does anyone else know of a \n&gt; restoration of a class through\n&gt; revolt or law? In The Three Musketeers, this happens with the \n&gt; Musketeers. But that&#39;s fiction,\n&gt; and the Musketeers weren&#39;t a &quot;class&quot; (though there might be some \n&gt; parallels). Lookin&#39; for a real\n&gt; historical example...\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s a different idea...\n&gt; In India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real \n&gt; everyday life, the caste\n&gt; system is just as real as it was before the laws. The law only serves \n&gt; its purpose if people obey\n&gt; it, or if it is enforced. So it is theoretically possible, also, that \n&gt; descendents of samurai could\n&gt; claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would \n&gt; for all intents and\n&gt; purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished. Of \n&gt; course, what a samurai\n&gt; today would do or be is ... well... difficult to imagine. Maybe they \n&gt; would carry two guns instead\n&gt; of two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police \n&gt; force.\n&gt;\n&gt; Theoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the \n&gt; abolishment of the\n&gt; samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public \n&gt; still regarded them as\n&gt; samurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. \n&gt; (Governments often act in an\n&gt; inconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, \n&gt; would that group of\n&gt; people still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think they would.\n&gt;\n&gt; This has some parallel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man \n&gt; and woman &quot;shack up&quot;\n&gt; for an extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though \n&gt; they have never\n&gt; exchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man \n&gt; and wife. That was\n&gt; common practice or &quot;common-law&quot;... the government eventually \n&gt; recognized this and would\n&gt; after said elapse of time pronounce them legally man and wife (so the \n&gt; government could get\n&gt; additional taxes out of them).\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the \n&gt; government acknowledged\n&gt; them to be so. It isn&#39;t a piece of paper that makes one man and wife. \n&gt; It&#39;s the lifestyle. Many\n&gt; cultures don&#39;t have &quot;pieces of paper&quot; from the government to confirm \n&gt; or legitimize the marriage.\n&gt; Public practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal \n&gt; action.\n&gt;\n&gt; So what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public \n&gt; acceptance, apart from\n&gt; law, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw \n&gt; marriage or the Indian caste\n&gt; system), how much of the public would it take to justify that claim? \n&gt; What&#39;s the critical mass\n&gt; required for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in \n&gt; the samurai&#39;s heyday,\n&gt; there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class system as it was. \n&gt; Maybe 51%? A simple\n&gt; majority? Who decides what the percentage would be?\n&gt;\n&gt; All this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today... but theoretically, \n&gt; it&#39;s possible.\n\nHonestly, I do not understand the meaning of the whole discussion. \nTheoretically, you can speculate, but it makes no sense at all.\n\nModern Japan is a democracy, and classes have nothing to do with it. \nThere is no way the government is going to pay a salary to samurai \ndescendants, no way people could go around the country carrying \nweapons, and once again I remind you that to be a samurai means to \n***SERVE*** a lord.\nSo, who will they serve? Shogun Koizumi?\n\nMoreover, the comparison with India does not hold up. India is a 75% \nrural country, a pseudo-democracy, and a country where the great \nmajority of people are Hindu: classes are defined by religion.\n\nThus, unlike in Japan, Indian society is still structured on a vertical \naxis, especially at the village level. Japan has vertical relationships \nin schools, companies, etc. but NOT in its constitution. The vertical \nrelationships in Japan are of a microcosmic nature, and do not permeate \nsociety as a whole.\n\nFinally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not yet mollified by Western \ninfluences and got rid of  Buddhism.\n\nThese are the reasons why Hindu ideology can still continue. (And of \ncourse -as usual- there are economic reasons as well.)\n\nAnd talking about economy, being the second wealthiest country in the \nworld, having schools, hospitals, Panasonics and Toyotas, do you think \nthe Japanese would care a bit about restoring a medieval social class?\n\nGuys: give up.\nLet&#39;s stop confounding history with reactionary science fiction.\n\ncepo\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
