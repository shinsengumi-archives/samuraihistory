I \nlike the www.toledoswords.com site, mostly because it&#39;s one of the \nfew I have visited (so I only know about their opinion). Is it ok?\n Oh, and don&#39;t be afraid, as I have no intention on getting freaky, I \njust like to learn about the historical events that have taken place \nthroughout the world, and in that matter the Discovery Channel has \nbeen of great help ;)\n I am also very interested in sailships, but that does not make the \nobject of this forum, so sorry I&#39;ve mentioned it.\n\n Respectfully,\n\n Gabriel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
