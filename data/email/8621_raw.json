You are better off with =\r\neither: a matchlock, a \n&gt;bow, a naginata, or a yari as your primary weapon.=\r\n Also, free-for-alls \n&gt;are not something that classical and medieval strate=\r\ngists were \n&gt;particularly fond of. Free-for-all approaches came about large=\r\nly after \n&gt;the development of modern firearms when tacticians realized that=\r\n they \n&gt;did not have to mass troops in order to mass strength. If you look =\r\nat \n&gt;battle paintings from Japan you will notice that unless a route is in =\r\n\n&gt;progress that you generally see troops on both sides drawn up in some \n&gt;s=\r\nort of skirmish line or other. Incidentally, battle paintings from the \n&gt;Se=\r\nngogku period pretty clearly show massed formations using similar \n&gt;weapons=\r\n. Think the battle scenes in Kagemusha except in 400 year old \n&gt;paintings. =\r\n\n\n  I know swords are over-rated on the battle feild and that the yari were=\r\n the primary weapons. I myself use a spear in training sometimes, but a swo=\r\nrd is just easyer to use (not all the time tho). As for the free-for-all af=\r\nter the Battle of Sekigahara the losers were hunted by the refugee hunters =\r\nand they were just farmers and other villagers who village had been destory=\r\ned by the samurai fighting. So they really didnt care about one-on-one figh=\r\nts they justed wanted the rewards and must of them were armed with bamboo s=\r\npears. And what I was talking about before was modern swordsmanship and how=\r\n the poeple who study it would fair in a environment like that. And picture=\r\ns aren&#39;t always true. \n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://=\r\nwww.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samura=\r\ni-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarch=\r\nives\n--- \n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
