Most for men\ninvolved shaving the pate of the head, but young boys would leave the\nforelock intact, and draw it over the top and tie it with the rest of\nthe cue...\nKeep in mind that there were samurai woman, too, and they did not\nshave their heads.\nIt has also been an understanding that it was a shamefull thing to\nhave the top knot (wage) removed under combat circumstances, but a\nsamurai, on taking buddhist vows would shave their head.\nThis did not have to be polished, and obviously grew back in over\ntime, requiring maintenance, so could look bushy. I do not think this\nwould have been a disgrace, though.\nAlso, there were men who naturally went bald...and that would hardly\nbe a disgrace...\nSo, I do not think that the Samurai in the movie was living in shame,\nas he had removed his own hair. \nWhen the soldiers removed the son&#39;s wage, it was more of a fact that\nhe was humiliated in public, in front of other people. Not cool...yet\nhe chose to help his father in the final end-game, rather than just\nkill himself.\nJust thoughts\n\nDate Saburou Yukiie\nYama Kaminari Ryu\n\n\n"
