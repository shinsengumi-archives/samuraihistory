You obviously know what you&#39;re talking about and have done a \nlot of =\r\nresearch. \n\n    You&#39;re right.  I did miss the site specifically meant \nfor =\r\n&quot;TENTS&quot;.  Don&#39;t know how that happened, but I&#39;m glad you pointed \nit out to=\r\n me.  This is exactly what I needed.\n\n    It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve watche=\r\nd &quot;Shogun&quot;.  It&#39;s probably time \nI sit through it again.  (As well as make =\r\nthe young men in my \nhousehold, who want to do Samurai persona, do the same=\r\n.) \n\n     One quick question for you...You suggest that, historically, the =\r\n\nJapanese probably used wooden supports for the awning.  I intend to \nuse a=\r\n garage canopy - as you suggested - due to costs, safety, and \nstructural i=\r\nntegrity.  Do you think that covering the piping with \nbamboo would be &quot;per=\r\niod&quot;.\n\nMichael\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
