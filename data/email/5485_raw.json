Too\n&gt; strong of a &quot;national&quot; movement (in the sense of it\n&gt; being spread throughout the populace almost\n&gt; nationwide, rather than being a political force in the\n&gt; &quot;national&quot; capital), I think. \n&gt; \n&gt;   That being the\n&gt; &gt; case, they {the Enryakuji, et al} are as \n&gt; &gt; much an impediment to one uniting the country as an\n&gt; &gt; enemy daimyo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hence their destruction at the hands of Nobunaga.\n&gt; While most still held some respect for their religious\n&gt; position, Nobunaga simply saw them as an impediment to\n&gt; political consolidation (under himself, of course!). \n&gt; \n&gt;   In \n&gt; &gt; which case you either work with them or against\n&gt; &gt; them. And what \n&gt; &gt; would &quot;working with them&quot; entail?\n&gt; \n&gt; Good question. Um...most likely, confirming their land\n&gt; holdings, possibly/probably giving them more, and\n&gt; trying to convince them to at least not attack you\n&gt; from behind, if not help against your enemies. Same\n&gt; things you do to get another daimyo on your\n&gt; side--convince him helping you is to his advantage\n&gt; with land and stuff. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But all that is just a side question/comment to the\n&gt; &gt; original - which \n&gt; &gt; was what would the most likely event be if someone\n&gt; &gt; else not as \n&gt; &gt; completely and utterly iron fisted against the Ikko\n&gt; &gt; Ikki et all as \n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga had tried to unify the country.  Nobunaga\n&gt; &gt; didnt stop at \n&gt; &gt; Enryakuji, it was policy for his armies to slaughter\n&gt; &gt; men, women, \n&gt; &gt; children, and the old who were in any way associated\n&gt; &gt; with the ikko \n&gt; &gt; ikki fortresses he brought down.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think either someone else (Shingen?) would have\n&gt; eventually been just as ruthless. Hideyoshi isn&#39;t\n&gt; played up as a bad guy because he wasn&#39;t nearly as\n&gt; often as Nobunaga, but he could be when he wanted to\n&gt; be. His destruction of the Negoro-ji isn&#39;t talked\n&gt; about as much, because Nobunaga already set the\n&gt; precedent and took the heat. \n\nWell, the ikko ikki, etc. are a little different than a clan headed \nby a Daimyo, they dont really have &quot;lands&quot; per se, nor do they really \nhave a &quot;daimyo&quot; who you can kill to send the armies scattering to the \nwinds. They are almost like a hydra, every time you cut off a head, \ntwo more grow back - just like any good fanatical religious \nmovement.  I think Nobunaga did the only thing that would have really \nworked - wipe them off the map - because they had been independent \nand growing for so long, I doubt they would have bowed to anyone, \nhence the idle thought of a semi-theocracy - but not so much to teach \nand force religion, but just so that they could consolodate political \npower and thier own lands, profits, and holdings, etc.\n\n\n"
