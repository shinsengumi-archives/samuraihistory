The Takeda network of fires was \nimmense...apparently covering southern Shinano, Kai and the surrounding \nprovince borders. Ithink their methods and strategys are contained in &#39;Heiho \nOkugisho&#39; by Yamamoto Kansuke..a legendary retainer of Shingen ko.\n Hope this waffle helps you out....\n\n"
