However, recently we&#39;ve had quite a lot of\n&quot;wat do u lik about teh samuria??? ninja are teh\nsuxors!!!11!&quot; type posts from list members. This is\nunacceptable.\n\nIf you (general &quot;you&quot;, not foxfoil in particular) are\nabove the age of 13, write like it. Otherwise, you\nwill not be taken seriously. Many posters come from\nnon-English speaking countries, and English is not\ntheir native language--we are fully accepting of your\nmistakes, because you try. I&#39;m certainly not capable\nof typing in Spanish or Russian, so I won&#39;t criticize\nyour efforts in English. Likewise for posters who have\nhandicaps such as dyslexia. If someone doesn&#39;t fall\ninto these categories and writes they&#39;re on a Teen\nBeat L33t message board, most of the serious regulars\nwill assume you are 12 years old. If you are not, then\nthe moderators will not take your question seriously\nif you don&#39;t take things like spelling &quot;samurai&quot; (it&#39;s\nnot samuria, saumari, or any other variation I&#39;ve seen\nin the last few days) seriously. \n\nLaziness isn&#39;t an excuse. \n\n--The Mgmt. \n\nNow, to your question:\n\n on how samurai\n&gt; culture is beeing depicted in hollywood \n&gt; cinema. concentrating on film as history, which\n&gt; elements are left out, why and what are the \n&gt; concequences.\n&gt; film wise i plan to look at ghostdog, kill bill, and\n&gt; the last samurai but any other films are very \n&gt; welcome.\n&gt; \n\nIf you want to look at charicatures of samurai foisted\nupon us by Hollywood, those are good movies to look\nat. However, none of them accurately picture anything.\nOf course, no &quot;Hollywood&quot; movies do. Perhaps that can\nbe your main point. \n\n&gt; my question is, what are your opinion on the\n&gt; subject?, do you have any books you can \n&gt; recommend. In short, any information that could be\n&gt; useful.\n\nI recommend watching as many Japanese movies depicting\nthe samurai as you can, and contrasting them with the\ngeneralized &quot;Ooh, check out the exotic Asians doing\nZen and martial arts&quot; put out by Hollywood. \n\nThere&#39;s a fairly recent book out that discusses\nJapanese cinema, especially Kurosawa and other samurai\nfilms--I&#39;m not sure of the name, but someone here\nknows for sure, since I&#39;ve seen it referenced. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
