Lord Byron has a\n&gt; &gt; statue in Greece erected to him not because he was a great poet\n&gt;but\n&gt; &gt; because he helped liberate Greece from the Turks. Musashi wrote\n&gt;books\n&gt; &gt; and was an excellent painter. Etc. Etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First, I don&#39;t remember saying it was sissy.  I said it contrasted.\n&gt;Second, I don&#39;t recall Julius Ceasar&#39;s &quot;Ode to a Summer Morning&quot; or\n&gt;Richard the Lionheart&#39;s &quot;Study of Roses.&quot;  The point I&#39;m making, it\n&gt;shows duality but not all warrior cultures highly prize artistic\n&gt;expression, especially among the warriors.  Lastly, samurais were\n&gt;warriors.  Japan, of this time, was under a feudal system.  In a\n&gt;feudal society, warriors always maintain the highest rung in\n&gt;society.  With that said, I asked what was their choice of\n&gt;entertainment.  Within that, I mentioned training and the playing of\n&gt;shogi.  Those can&#39;t be the only examples of war like entertainment.\n&gt;Unlike Rome, the samurai, in particualr before the edo period,\n&gt;prepared for war constantly and were measured more by prowess in\n&gt;combat.  Yet, they didn&#39;t relish in bloodshed as much as their Roman\n&gt;counterparts.  There has to be some other examples.  Drinking,\n&gt;womanizing, and gambling: I don&#39;t view these as war like\n&gt;entertainment because all males participate.  I&#39;m sure wealth\n&gt;merchants endulged as much if not more then the samurai.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Join the 2007 Samurai Fiction Contest: \n&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n&gt;Yahoo!
