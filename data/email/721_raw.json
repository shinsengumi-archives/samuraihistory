He was both a\ngreat stateman and a strategist. Some people may know\nit. He was the one who wrote a document on how to land\ntroops in France after 1941 which General Eisenhower\nused as a reference for his landing plan. He also\ncorrected some of mistakes made by American Generals\n(like Gen. Marshall) at the initial war planning right\nafter Pearl Harbor.(Gen. Marshall proposed raising one\nmillion Army and Churchill explained why it was a bad\nidea)\n\nMy second choice is Napoleon Bonaparte. I think with\nregard to his ability of organizing and implementing\nthe offensive, there was no equal at his life time.\n(Sir Wellington purely took a defensive posture\nwhenever he faced with Nopoleon. Even this was not\nsuccessful if he had not had a prussian ally.)\n \n--- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Anthony J.

It&#39;s all in good fun, don&#39;t try to read\n&gt; too much into it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, here goes. I&#39;ve got many choices (and by the\n&gt; way, I&#39;m reading this as who would I wish to have\n&gt; the\n&gt; same circumstances befall me historically and try to\n&gt; live up to what they did. Good compromise?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Being an ex-tanker, Patton is always a choice...love\n&gt; that guy. Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse, just to see\n&gt; Custer&#39;s face as an arrow went through his\n&gt; head...(despite my being a member of 7th Cavalry\n&gt; Regiment...Garryowen in Glory) Maybe MacArthur or\n&gt; Ridgeway, to see the Korean War ended right, unlike\n&gt; the situation now. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d have to say my top choice would be Oda Nobunaga,\n&gt; and not just because we&#39;re on the Samurai list. What\n&gt; a\n&gt; fascinating man! I&#39;d love to walk in his shoes for a\n&gt; little while, see what went on in his mind. He, in\n&gt; my\n&gt; mind, was the absolute master at integrating\n&gt; tactical,\n&gt; operational, and strategic levels of warfare. Just\n&gt; to\n&gt; glimpse into his decision making process, his\n&gt; analysis, his IPB...wow. I&#39;d say Hashiba Hideyoshi\n&gt; would be another good choice--not Toyotomi, but\n&gt; Hashiba Hideyoshi, so I could examine his\n&gt; commander/subordinate relationship with Nobunaga,\n&gt; and\n&gt; figure out why these two opposites worked so well\n&gt; together. \n&gt; \n&gt; Just my two yen...it is a rather silly, yet\n&gt; interesting question. C&#39;mon, Tony...don&#39;t be so\n&gt; analytical!!!! \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
