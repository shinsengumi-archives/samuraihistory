I&#39;m talking about so-called knightly swords, not the tradition of smallswords, rapiers, officers&#39; sabres and so on. Actual, knightly-class, swords.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The samurai class in Japan constituted a much greater percentage of the\n&gt; population\n&gt; than the knightly class did in Europe.  Consequently there were a lot\n&gt; more swords\n&gt; made and a lot more survived.   The notion that the Europeans had no\n&gt; notion of\n&gt; &quot;protecting things&quot; is simply not true.\n\nAgain, I&#39;m talking about specifically taking care of swords. How many European swords from the 1300s have a mirror polish on them? There are hundreds of Japanese swords of this age that do. There&#39;s a\ndifference between stashing them somewhere for safekeeping, and keeping them in a treasure house and cleaning them periodically.\n\n&gt; There are still fabulous collections\n&gt; of medieval weapons all over Europe in museums and private hands.\n\nYes, I&#39;ve seen quite a few. But in terms of numbers, they&#39;re still lower (percentage, by date) than those in Japan, and in less good condition. How often do swords in Japan get classified from a battlefield\nfind? Not too often, but many of the examples that Oakenshott and others use to classify types are dug up out of the ground and need to be conserved, rather than preserved.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The habit of carrying swords in the west, medieval or not, only ended\n&gt; about 150\n&gt; years ago.   Officers in the Civil War carried swords and used them.   When\n&gt; the Queen of Holland gave General Eisenhower a token of her country&#39;s\n&gt; esteem,\n&gt; it was a highly decorated sword, not a machine gun.\n&gt;\n\nAgain, I&#39;m talking &quot;knightly swords&quot; not modern swords. The way we regard them and still use them (e.g., still in today&#39;s army and so forth we have officers&#39; dress swords) is irrelevant to a discussion of\nhistorical knightly swords. Comparing these to Japanese swords is apples and oranges; better to compare those to gunto\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There are now numerous books available in English for westerners interested\n&gt; in the Japanese sword.   I would be glad to post a bibliography of such\n&gt; items\n&gt; if there are sufficient requests.   A good book for beginners is John\n&gt; Yumoto&#39;s\n&gt; classic work, &quot;The Samurai Sword, A Handbook&quot; published by Tuttle.\n\nA good book, but rather basic. Personally, I prefer my Japanese books... I think I only have two or three in English.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
