I seem to remember something about him\n&gt; smashing an important tea bowl to prevent it falling\n&gt; into Oda hands as his castle burned around him. \n\nExactly - after he fled kyoto and had time to become a problem for \nNobunaga.  In both cases, it just seems odd that Nobunaga would just \nlet them escape.\n\n\n\n"
