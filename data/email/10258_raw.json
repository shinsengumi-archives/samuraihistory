The=\r\nre are some exceptions : the Shimazu, shugo of Satsuma and =C3&quot;sumi, the Ta=\r\nkeda, shugo of Kai or the Imagawa, shugo of Suruga\n&gt; To take another exampl=\r\ne : Etch=C3=BB and Noto are officially under two members (shugo) of the Hat=\r\nakeyama family but, in fact, the first province is splitted between various=\r\n vassals of the Hatakeyama among which the leading familiers are the Jimb=\r\n=C3=B4 and the Shiina. Similarly, in Noto, the leading families, among othe=\r\nrs, are the Ch=C3=B4 and the Yusa.\n&gt; Hope I have been usefull\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nMessage du 07/11/10 20:39\n&gt; &gt; De : &quot;konohawolfie&quot; \n&gt; &gt; A : samuraihistory@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Copie =C3=A0 : \n&gt; &gt; Objet : [samuraihistory] Simple Seng=\r\noku Daimyo Question\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a simple question about daimyo.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; So each province/kuni had their own leading daimyo, or the kuni functione=\r\nd as a family base...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like the Uesugi has Echigyo, Tokugawa has Mi=\r\nkawa, Rokkaku had Omi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since the kuni are large and are split into=\r\n districts, did the Samurai clans have a leader in each district to spread =\r\ntheir influence? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like, Kenshin could live at his castle (not sure=\r\n where) in one distict and the others can be ruled by his loyal retainers?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or did a province had just one single daimyo leader?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
