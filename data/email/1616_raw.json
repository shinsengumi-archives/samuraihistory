Yet in my research and pratice of sword \narts I have to wonder if there was ever a left handed swordsmen?( I \nuse the term men for that while there where woman bushi they used \nmostly the naginata and shoto forms of tanto)\n\nWhile the movies do show all rightys, I remember seeing a movie, \nChristopher Lambert but a non Highlander, film where he was being \ntaught by a Japanese swords men who knocked the sword from his left \nhand and told him that he must be a righty.\n\nForm my experiance in both European fencing and Kenjitsu at times the \nLefty has an advantage over the righty. So it leads me to wonder if \nthe left handed bushi would have some sort of advantage. If there is \nanyone who is either a lefty, fought a lefty or knows anything about \nsuch things help would be welcome\n\nArigto gozimashita\nAtsi \n\n\n"
