Zen was a key feature for the Japanese and th=\r\ne Samurai like the Dojo Kun in Karate the Samurai were bound to this doctri=\r\nne. Bushido gave them their way of life, how to act and how to honourable. =\r\nEarly Samurai would go into battle shouting of all the deeds they have done=\r\n and hoped an opponent could match their honour. I could go on forever but =\r\nthat would be boring, I strongly recommend that you mention martial arts in=\r\n your essay  because the way of the Samurai is still living with the JKA Ja=\r\npan Karate Association the club I belong to.
