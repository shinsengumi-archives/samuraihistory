I came across samurai-archives.com by browsing the web in search of =\r\nJapan related stuff, I have subscribed to the forum and have been reading t=\r\nhe discussions for approximately 2 weeks now.\n Anyway, since I am digressin=\r\ng, I&#39;ll get to the point. I would like to know the chronologic order of the=\r\n japanese eras, eventually before Heian Period, and up untill The Meiji Res=\r\ntoration, at least the most important ones, since I understand that an era =\r\nwould have started and ended whenever a personality (daimyo, general or mil=\r\nitary prominent person) would have realised something extraordinary (please=\r\n correct me if I am wrong...I realise the probability that I am is high, so=\r\n any correction would be whole heartedly welcome). I am asking this because=\r\n I need a sort of &quot;backbone&quot; from which I can learn more.\nOh, and another t=\r\nhing, I would like to learn the japanese language, but for a self-taught li=\r\nke myself it seems almost impossible. Seeing that I am from the Eastern Eur=\r\nope, and books about Japan hardly get here (on-line shopping is out of the =\r\nquestion for now, because, for example, Amazon does not cover my area - and=\r\n also because I am somehow &quot;financially-challenged&quot; at the moment :D ), I m=\r\nostly use the www. So, here is a list of sites that I use, please tell me i=\r\nf they are ok:\n1. Jeffrey&#39;s Japanese-English Dictionary Server at www.solon=\r\n.org (EDICT)\n2. Jim Breen&#39;s Japanese Page\n3. Nagasaki University Old Pictur=\r\ne Database\n4. www.kanjisite.com\nThese are my &quot;personal favorites&quot;, if I can=\r\n call them that.\n \nI would also appreciate if you could direct me to some o=\r\nnline japanese literature books (public domain, of course), since I can&#39;t b=\r\nuy any ( I know I ask much...but, hey, hope dies last...)\n \nThis beeing sai=\r\nd, I thank you for your time and expect your answers\n \nRespectfully,\n \nGabr=\r\niel\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n The all-new My Ya=\r\nhoo! =96 What will yours do?\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been =\r\nremoved]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
