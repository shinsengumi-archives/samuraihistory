The political repercussion would be chaos, a power vacume, and possibly cival war as what happened in the case when Oda Nobunaga was murdered. As far as swords without tsuba the only type I know of is an aikuchi a type of mounting for a dagger.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Lilith \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, August 03, 2004 9:18 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Revenge\n\n\n  Hey guys,\n\n  You may or may not know I&#39;m a writer, and I&#39;m working on a fantasy \n  novel set in a very late Sengoku-era alternate world. I&#39;d like to \n  make it as real and accurate as possible, even though it is a fantasy \n  world, and some of the questions I have might have instructive \n  answers for the list people.\n\n  The questions I&#39;d like to start off with are:\n\n  1. What were the penalties (if any, social or otherwise) of women \n  dressing like men, and men dressing like women, in Japanese culture \n  of that time?\n\n  2. When did revenge killing become illegal, and what were the \n  penalties?\n\n  3. What would be the penalties for killing a shogun, and likely \n  repercussions politically of a shogun&#39;s murder?\n\n  4. When did a sword without a tsuba (yes, I&#39;ll say it, like Lucy \n  Liu&#39;s sword in Kill Bill) become acceptable, if it ever did?\n\n  I realize these questions might be far more complex than a single \n  post- or even ten posts- could answer. I appreciate any help- and of \n  course, anyone who helps out will be listed in the acknowledgements \n  if and when I get this book to print.\n\n  Lili\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n        Yahoo!
