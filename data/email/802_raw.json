The process in \npainting these\n&gt; is to have a &quot;period expert&quot; paint a master which is then \nreplicated by the\n&gt; chinese master painter and sent to outworkers in China to produce \ncommercial\n&gt; figures. The original castings, particularly the generals if you \nare able to\n&gt; get hold of them, are of an excellent detail and compare well with \nother\n&gt; (sometimes more expensive) 54mm figures. I wish that I could get \nhold of\n&gt; more unpainted castings. If you haven&#39;t already done so have a look \nat the\n&gt; artillery units - great fun!!\n&gt; \n&gt;                                                             Rod \nJohnson\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi Tai Shogun of UK\n\nDid you know that there is a shop in the UK it is on the website \naddress is \n\nMaison Militaire\nContact: Ken Jackson\n25, Main Street,\nSeamer,\nScarborough,\nNorth Yorkshire YO12 4PS\nU.K.\n\nTel: (44) 01723 864453 \nFax: (44) 01723 864453 \nE-mail: maison@...\n\nI live close by again soon, so I may visit it sometime, I&#39;m not sure \nif you can get original caste moulds from here. Probably unlikely, I \nwill ask.  If you email the website they are very friendly, I did and \nwas pleased I got a reply.  I like the T-shirts too with the Fu rin \nka zan slogan of Takeda Shingen.  \n\nAnyway hope this helps, Mark\n\n\n\n"
