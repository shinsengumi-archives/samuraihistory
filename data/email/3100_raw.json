You might try finding\n&gt; them at the Japan Foundation. The Foundation&#39;s office here in Kyoto has a\n&gt; well stocked lending library. I am sure the Tokyo one would have even\n&gt; better.\n\nOn the same subject, Nate, International House in Tokyo has a very good English language library - it&#39;s in between Roppongi and Azabu. Can&#39;t find the phone number at the moment but I do have it somewhere if you can&#39;t get hold of it. It also holds lots of translations of Japanese literature. I read (among other things) &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; there which is a fascinating novel by Shimazaki Toson giving lots of interesting background on the Meiji era.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
