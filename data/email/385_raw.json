Tony can correct me, probably, but I would hazard\na guess that THAT&#39;s the way IT WAS DONE, so that&#39;s the\nway it was. Also, I don&#39;t know the credibility, but I\nread somewhere that bumping scabbards was a big no-no;\nhaving people with scabbards on either side of them\ncreated a whole bunch of problems, so they were all\ntaught to have them on the left, requiring a\nright-handed draw. \n\nI would also hazard a guess that much like Europe\nlefties were considered &quot;odd&quot; and should be trained\nout of it. \n\nNate\n\n--- erik baker &lt;musashieb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I believe this was due to confucian values of\n&gt; conformity in society.
