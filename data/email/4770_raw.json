I&#39;ve noticed a few things in common with some of the \ngroup - I lived in Okinawa from &#39;74-&#39;80 (makiminato and kadena), have \na (barely) passing knowledge of nihongo, and an interest in the \nmartial arts (though I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to study, saving \nmyself for aikido ;) which is notoriously hard to find a master for \nin south Mississippi). That pretty much sums up my expertise, which \nimplies &quot;not much.&quot; I may be able to add illumination on something \nsomewhere, since I tend to collect disjointed trivial bits of \nknowledge but I will probably just keep my fingers tight and \nears/eyes open.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; \n&lt;ajbryant@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tom Stewart wrote:\n&gt; \nI am mostly interested in the moral\n&gt; &gt; code and the discipline they lived by.  &gt; Well, I hate to tell \nyou this, but there was no &quot;discipline&quot; or &quot;spiritual way \n&gt; of life.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ve bought into the myth. \n\nI am trying to remember the book I read which dealt with the \nmilitary/soldier&#39;s attitudes throuhgout Japanese history. It seems \nfar from being over concerned about honor, there are several stories \nwhere what would amount to several companies of &quot;smaurai&quot; switched \nsides the night before a battle. My general impression of pre-sengoku \nperiod, at least, is that martial atitudes in Japan were not much \ndifferent from 11th century Europe - i.e. beat intersts served. I&#39;ll \ntry to track down the book, though doubtless a member owns it (I did \nget it from the public library).\n\n-z\n\n\n\n"
