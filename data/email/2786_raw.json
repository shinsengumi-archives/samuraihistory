Now, the\n&gt; &gt; problem is that, even\n&gt; &gt; today, it would be impossible to have 1,000 people\n&gt; &gt; to shoot exactly in\n&gt; &gt; synchro fashion, especially with a 16th c. weapon.\n&gt; &gt; So, the number of\n&gt; &gt; shooters might have been inflated by Nobunaga&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; side, just to impress\n&gt; &gt; the other daimyo.\n&gt; &gt; Dr.Varley told me that there is a new article by one\n&gt; &gt; of his colleagues\n&gt; &gt; (sorry, forgot to ask who) that examines the battle\n&gt; &gt; from a\n&gt; &gt; historical/martial point of view. It is not\n&gt; &gt; published, but he&#39;ll let me\n&gt; &gt; have a copy--so, I&#39;ll be back to you once I have\n&gt; &gt; read it.\n&gt; &gt; cepo, honolulu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New Yahoo!
