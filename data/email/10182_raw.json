But I have heard the same as you th=\r\nat it being easier for those with Japanese blood to get citizenship.\n\nI had=\r\n complained at Yokohama immigration (after getting my\nvisa) that some of th=\r\ne staff were rude to some of the Asian people\nat immigration.   My second c=\r\nomplaint was about the re-entry permit\nbeing only for one year when the vis=\r\na was for three or in my case now--a permanent visa.\n\nIn my opinion the re-=\r\nentry permit is really just a special tax that\nnon-Japanese have to pay.   =\r\n I think it should be done away with.\n\nThe immigration manager encouraged m=\r\ne to become Japanese which really\nsurprised me.  I am a blue eyed, brown (a=\r\nnd now graying) Canuck.\n\nThe immigration staff are less rude nowadays.  Not=\r\n friendly but not\noutwardly rude.  I was shocked at some of the things that=\r\n happened\n14 years ago in Yokohama.\n\nDefinitely you are correct about the p=\r\nopulation shrinking because of the low birthrate and virtually no immigrati=\r\non apart from some international marriages.   Currently I think 5% of new m=\r\narriages\nper year are international--Japanese and a non-Japanese.  \n\nThe ch=\r\nildren of these marriages will literally change the complexion of Japan and=\r\n probably the politics towards immigration as well.\n\nHatoyama is a step in =\r\nthe right direction (if I can be so bold at this forum).    I think he is a=\r\n sign of the future--a more open and \ninternationally minded Japan.   I hop=\r\ne so anyway!\n\nKev\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Cearb@... wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Kev --\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do you have any Japanese heritage?
