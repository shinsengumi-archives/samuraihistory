It was recently\n&gt; updated, and has some  nice photographs as well.\n&gt; Although it cover many Japanese samurai  films, it\n&gt; also deals with some western films. \n\nThat&#39;s the one I meant, I think. That should be a big\nhelp to Foxfoil. \n\n&gt;   I would also recommend the Akira Kurosawa\n&gt; documentary which can be  found on DVD. No worries\n&gt; for non-Japanese speakers--it is done in  English. \n&gt;   \n&gt;   You may also want to look into adaptations of\n&gt; Kurosawa movies which  were mostly &#39;western&#39; western\n&gt; films. For example... &#39;The Magnificent  Seven.&#39; I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure it would fit into what you are trying to\n&gt; do, but  it might be a unique angle.\n\nThat would be an interesting angle. Off the top of my\nhead, you could also discuss the Clint Eastwood movies\n(&quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, &quot;a Fist Full of Dollars&quot;,\n&quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot;) that were\nadaptations of the Kurosawa &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, &quot;Sanjuro&quot;\nseries. Also of interest would be Kuroawa&#39;s effect on\nStar Wars, which I think Lucas talks about on the\nKurosawa DVD. \n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
