I was bitten by the bug\nat such a young age I cannot remember.  Always been interested in\nJapan as far back as I can remember, but didnt start really reading\nabout it till my teen years.  Just to try to give you some help.  I\ndon&#39;t know if you have found it, but www.japanshoten.com offers a\nnumber of books to help you with Japanese.  I plan to get several of\nthem when I get the money to help suplement my classes at college.  My\nteachers use a series call Yookoso.  The author escapes me at the\nmoment , and I dont have my copy in front of me.  However, it is\navailable through amazon.com.  It does have it&#39;s own flaws, and a\nnumber of people I know that have been to Japan do not like it very\nmuch because of it&#39;s style.  But, it is better then nothing and they\ncome with either tapes or cd&#39;s.  Another good recourse from what I\nhear are the Genki series.  These can be found on japanshoten.com as\nwell as other places.  A Japanese friend of mine tell me that this is\nwhat many Japnese universities use to teach Japanese to their\n&quot;exchange&quot; students from other countries.  Hope this helps you out\nsome, and keep up the study.... just be carefull of where you learn\nfrom.  I am not saying this is you, but, too many kids in my Japanese\nI class have tried to learn Japanese through anime....scary and the\nteachers don&#39;t appreciate hearing &quot;but in _____ anime they said\n&#39;______&#39; and the subtitles said &#39;____&#39; so they must be right&quot;. *Hides\nunder the covers* scary otaku, scary otaku *lol*.  I wish you the best\nof luck.\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
