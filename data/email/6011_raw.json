Something like that to be cute or funny\nis fine. talkin lik u r passin notes in ur study hall\nis annoying. I ask, yet again, that people stop it.\n\n************ I began using that term as a phonetic pronunciation of &#39;cool&#39;.  I like the way it sounds, and it has stuck with me.\n\n&gt; *****Aye, that GPB is quite knowledgeable, and a\n&gt; hoot when he is having a good day.  I finally got my\n&gt; firweall settings to where\n&gt; more of the information on his site will display on\n&gt; my screen.\n\nSSHHHH! Don&#39;t tell him that. He&#39;s got a big enough\nhead as it is...lol.\n\n******** Yah, I know how he can get.  He&#39;s much more fun when he&#39;s not cranky, which is when I either just ignore him, or I fan the \nflames by saying someting silly.*****\n\n&gt; I understand you are in Tokyo.....   would I show my\n&gt; impertinent curiosity again to inquire as to how you\n&gt; got there (not\n&gt; transportation) , what you do, and how you find the\n&gt; daily life?   What do you like best?\n\nEmail me off list if you wish--I won&#39;t take up more\nbandwidth here. Suffice to say I live and work in\nTokyo for the time being, though I&#39;m moving to\nKanagawa soon. Daily life is great, and what is there\nNOT to like in Tokyo? (Except Roppongi. It&#39;s icky)\n\n*****I&#39;ll do just that, but in a few days, when I have some more time off to play.*****\n\nObediently,\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\nNate\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
