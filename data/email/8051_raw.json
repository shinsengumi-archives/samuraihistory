This clearly demonstrates many percepts contained in the book of five rings from knowing your opponent to knowing the lay of the land to applying strategy and more .Unfortunately I cannot quote any sources with any veracity.Hope this helps any way.\n  Yours in bu do\n                      Rob\n\nqin_affs &lt;fhij@...&gt; wrote:\n  --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Totok Sudarijanto\n&lt;totok.sudarijanto@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Guys,\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know the true story of Musashi when he was about to duel \n&gt; with Sasaki Kojiro. He was on the small boat and made a bokken (later \n&gt; called suburito) from an oar?\n&gt; \n&gt; On the movie starring Mifune, he was actually bringing his sword but he \n&gt; picked an oar to use for the duel as he was asked by the boat-man, why \n&gt; do you make a bokken and not use your sword? Musashi said: &quot;I like the \n&gt; size&quot;. While other source on website saying the Musashi actually forgot \n&gt; his sword and he had to make a bokken from an oar.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the excerpt from the site: &quot;Musashi Miyamoto, arguably Japan&#39;s \n&gt; greatest swordsman, overslept one morning. He was due to meet one of\nhis \n&gt; many challengers and was already running late. As he bolted from his\nbed \n&gt; to the door, he, incredibly, forgot his sword!! Hastily, he boarded the \n&gt; small boat that was to take him to a small island (sandbar) where his \n&gt; armed opponent awaited him anxiously. Realizing his predicament along \n&gt; the way, he grabbed one of the boat&#39;s oars and, with a small knife, \n&gt; began whittling a crudely-shaped katana from it. Arriving at his \n&gt; destination, Musashi greeted his adversary. The man laughed and \n&gt; confidently drew his weapon and attacked the awaiting Musashi. With a \n&gt; swift series of graceful movements, Musashi expertly defended himself \n&gt; and quickly dispatched the over-zealous opponent by crushing his \n&gt; skull!!! ... and so was born the Suburito.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The question is, did Musashi actually forget his sword and have to make \n&gt; a bokken from an oar or did he actually like the size of the oar and \n&gt; prefer using it to using his sword?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Totok Sudarijanto\n&gt; http://www.mjer.org\n&gt; email: totok.sudarijanto@m...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The ultimate aim of martial arts is not having to use them.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\nI would recomend a book i just recently read, its called:\nThe Lone Samurai, The life of Miyamoto Musashi. \nWriten by WIlliam Scott Wilson.\n\nIt covers a lot of the aspects of Musashi&#39;s live from his duels to his\nskills in painting. It also mentioned conflicting informations etc.\n\nIf you like to read more about the real man thats a place to start.\n\nQin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
