If there is any way you can leave your\n&gt; dog with your parents or siblings or friend,\n&gt; anything would be better. He won&#39;t pick up the\n&gt; language in a year anyway.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Josh Wilson &lt;lordwilson83@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: 2005/05/03 Tue PM 10:59:23 EDT\n&gt; &gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] REALLY O.T. question\n&gt; about modern Japan....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; what are the logistics to having dogs as pets in\n&gt; Japan? Im moving to hokkaido in about a year and I\n&gt; need to know about bringing my dog with me. its not\n&gt; too big of a dog. are they generally banned from\n&gt; apartments there? since Im moving to a more rural\n&gt; area do I have anything to worry about? hopefully my\n&gt; wife and I will be going with the JET program\n&gt; (Japanese English Teachers) does anyone have any\n&gt; experience with them? thanks for any information..\n&gt; plz mail me off the list.. thank you..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
