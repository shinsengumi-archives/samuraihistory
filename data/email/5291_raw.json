Thanks, Denny.\n\n*blush* thanks, and no, I&#39;m not a teacher, though I&#39;ve\ndone my share of instructing in the Army. I spent two\nyears as exec officer of a basic training company, and\ntaught several classes, including history. If you can\nexplain army history to 17 year olds who barely got\ntheir GED, it makes other things easier. But thanks!\nMaybe one day, I&#39;ll actually get back to school\nmyself, get those impressive degrees like Tony, and\nteach. Until then, I&#39;ll keep living in Tokyo on the\nArmy&#39;s yen. :)\n\n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
