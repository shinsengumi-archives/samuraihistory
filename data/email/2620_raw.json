One person would hoist the banner up to the top of the \nbuilding to\n&gt; show that his brigade was fighting the flames, until either the \nfire was put\n&gt; out, or the fire consumed him...  Or at least, this is what I was \ntaught in\n&gt; Japanese culture class..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wilson\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------- Original Message ---------\n&gt; &gt; DATE: Sat, 29 Nov 2003 16:56:41\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Cc:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering about the origins of the yakuza, I have herd \nthat they\n&gt; originated from porters, (a group\n&gt; &gt; that were easily recognized by their extensive body art). Or \nwere they\n&gt; simply a mixed group of rufians\n&gt; &gt; and wayward ronin? All this is assumeing that they originated in \nthe 18th\n&gt; or 19th centurys, or are they\n&gt; &gt; a much more recent development?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
