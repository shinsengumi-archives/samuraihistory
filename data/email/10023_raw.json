They aren&#39;t usually\n&gt;thought as highly of and though there are exceptions, many are fairly\n&gt;unremarkable, that I&#39;ve seen.\n&gt;That would seem to make it just right\n&gt;for your use.\n\nThe yari I&#39;ve had a chance to examine in the past at museums etc. did \nindeed vary wildly in terms of quality. The issue for us with replicas \nis their authenticity. We&#39;re not looking for perfect copies with \nproperly folded blades and real urushi lacquer, but Hanwei have a habit \nof cutting really big corners, for example in terms of  the materials \nuse, such as plastic and aluminium etc.\n\nAfter a bit more wandering around the web, I&#39;ve so far failed to find \nout anything about the materials used for such things as the haft, which \njudging from the wording of some reviews may not be made of wood as it \nshould be.\n\nSo unless anyone can advise me differently, it&#39;s back to plan &quot;A&quot;:-(\n\nThanks for the input.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n\n-- \nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
