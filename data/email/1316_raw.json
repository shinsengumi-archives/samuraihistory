I just joined this list. Visited two temples in Kyoto last \nsummer (Koshoji and Genko-an) that had ceilings built from the \nfloorboards of Fushimi castle, stained with the blood of those who \ndied in the siege in 1600. I was very affected by the sight, could \nalmost hear the screams and clash of arms. I understand that there \nare several other temples with the same and that the castle was \ndismantled with parts of it incorporated into others all over Japan. \nI have a number of (maybe dumb)questions I haven&#39;t been able to find \nanswers for which you all may know:\n\n*The castle was built by Toyotomi and I read that he died there (not \nin the siege of course). Is that true and was he using it as his \nresidence at the time? Has it ever been determined what he died of?\n\n*How many people on each side died in the siege?\n\n*What other campaigns did Torii Mototada, the castle&#39;s defender, \nfight in? \n     That&#39;s enough for now-thanks-homitsu\n\n\n\n\n"
