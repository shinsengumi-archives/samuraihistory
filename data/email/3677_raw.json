Even christians was =\r\nkilled\n\nthere, between jews, homosexuals, and protestants.\n\n\nNow, as ye sai=\r\nd: we now just go &quot;get back on topic&quot;!\n\n\n\nAbout Oda Nobunaga &quot;just fighting=\r\n military threats&quot;, what secluded monks\n\nwith nenjus and hunting-bows, and =\r\nweaponless villagers could do to be a\n\n&quot;Military Threat&quot; is totally unknow =\r\nto me.\n\n\nPe. Francisco Xavier entered in Japan through LIES and THREASON fr=\r\nom the\n\nbeggining. I&#39;ve read a copy of the original message of him to the p=\r\nope with\n\na translation to portuguese, and he admited that, to introduce ch=\r\nristianity\n\nto japan, they would deliberatelly LIE and ACT WITH FALSEHOOD, =\r\ndisguissing\n\nchristian religious practices with the buddhist ones...\n\n\nThey=\r\n had a conspiratory behaviour since the begining, and Tokugawa just did\n\nwh=\r\nat is right for the Japan national security, avoiding the terror that\n\nhapp=\r\nened in the hands of Nobunaga, and in Europe to the native religions\n\nthere=\r\n.\n\n\nThey even attempted to kill Tokugawa himself.\n\n\nAbout the PC discourse =\r\nthat &quot;many religions did something reprobable in\n\ntheir history&quot;, no one di=\r\nd so much bloodshed than christianism, inclusive in\n\nJapan, and after the e=\r\nnd of the Vietnan War, the catholic administrator put\n\n(again in recent his=\r\ntory) several buddhist monks in concentration champs\n\n(fields), under the e=\r\nxcuse to &quot;fight the communism&quot;. Unlike certain other\n\nreligions who have th=\r\ne habit to burn others when something they don&#39;t like\n\nhappens, the buddhis=\r\nt monks had burned their own bodies!!!!!\n\n\nBushido is a way of Honour and L=\r\nOYALTY! and again, those christians should\n\nnot be called Samurai!\n\n\nStop t=\r\nhe lies.
