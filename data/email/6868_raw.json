There never were any plans to\n&gt; cover it in silver, much to the contrary of what\n&gt; guidebooks and Mr. Turnbull will tell you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; During my last visit to Japan in January, I asked my wife to call\n&gt; Ginkakuji and they said that yes, there were plans to cover it in\n&gt; silver (and went on to give the standard background). This may be a\n&gt; case of them giving the answer they think the asker may want.\n&gt; Short of someone uncovering a contemporary document that specifically\n&gt; mentions plans for covering it in silver foil, I think we&#39;ll never know\n&gt; for sure.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest:\n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
