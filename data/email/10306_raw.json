Nevertheless f=\r\normal and clear definitions about the way of the\n\n&gt; samurai, the seven prin=\r\nciples and thing like that, are written in the\n\n&gt; Tokugawa period, several =\r\ncenturies after.Please, could you help me saying me\n\n&gt; if there is some cod=\r\ne of samurai ways written in the kamakura period (or\n\n&gt; before), better if =\r\naccepted and promoted by the bakufu, and what it says\n\n&gt; more or less? Than=\r\nk you for your help.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; While there appears to be a reference to &quot;bushid=\r\no&quot; before the Tokugawa\n\nperiod, it seems to be very personal and individual=\r\nized.  There was\n\ndefinitely a culture of honor, or &quot;face&quot; in Japanese cult=\r\nure.  For example,\n\n Emp. Godaigo&#39;s spy justified his absence from court by=\r\n intentionally and\n\npublically making a mistake in reading a particular cha=\r\nracter.  That\n\nhumiliation gave him an excuse to retire from the court for =\r\nabout a year.\n\n Other bits can be gleaned from various war tales.\n\n\n\nWe fin=\r\nd evidence of people who dyed their hair black and perfumed it so that\n\nwhe=\r\nn they died in battle their head would be presentable.  Suicide (though\n\nno=\r\nt necessarily harakiri) is a common enough theme--though it is a last\n\nreso=\r\nrt.  Enduring pain and suffering with stoic fortitude are also common,\n\nand=\r\n look to the way Buddhist values--particularly of anti-materialism and\n\nthe=\r\n concept of non-attachment--was idealized among this class.\n\n\n\nOf course, p=\r\neople could find all sorts of reasons to get around such\n\nstrictures.\n\n\n\nFo=\r\nr direct evidence, you&#39;ll need to look to various house instructions\n\nwritt=\r\nen by leaders to their followers and descendants.\n\n\n\nAlso look to Karl Frid=\r\nay and others.\n\n\n\nWhat have you read, so far?\n\n\n\n-Josh\n\n\n\n[Non-text portion=\r\ns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
