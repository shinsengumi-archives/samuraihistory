A shogun is a\n&gt; warlord or governor \n&gt; of a province. This is what happens when you quickly\n&gt; reply to a post \n&gt; at work (you make silly mistakes). \n\nSorry to correct you again, but shogun does *not* mean\nwarlord, or governor of a province. It&#39;s short for\n&quot;sei-i tai shogun&quot;, and means, loosely translated,\n&quot;barbarian subduing general in chief&quot; or some\napproximation. It was the title granted to the\nmilitary dictator of the country, not a province, by\nthe Emperor, ostensibly to rule in the Emperor&#39;s name.\nThree families held the title--first the Minamoto,\nthen the Ashikaga (related to the Minamoto), then the\nTokugawa (supposedly related, though it&#39;s been\nquestioned). Most sources will tell you that direct\nrelation to the Minamoto family was required to be\ngranted the title, but that&#39;s also been questioned. \n\n&quot;Shogun&quot; by itself basically means &quot;general&quot;, or\n&quot;field marshal&quot;. &quot;Taisho&quot; is much more common for\ngeneral, though. \n\n&quot;Daimyo&quot;, literally meaning &quot;big name&quot;, is the word\nyou are thinking of when you think &quot;warlord&quot;--that&#39;s\nabout the most direct translation. However, it didn&#39;t\nnecessarily have a provincial designation. You could\nbe &quot;daimyo&quot; of a province, you could be &quot;daimyo&quot; of\nmany provinces, or of part of a province. Governor is\noften the translation for the title &quot;kami&quot;, and in the\nHeian period did mean actual appointment as a\ngovernor, for the most part. In the 1500&#39;s, it was\nlargely a name only title--you could be &quot;Bingo no\nkami&quot; (Governor of Bingo) without ever having set foot\nin the province of Bingo, and having nothing to do\nwith the administration of it. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
