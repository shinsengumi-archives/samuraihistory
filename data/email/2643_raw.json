His latest movie, &quot;The\n&gt;Last Samurai,&quot; falls squarely into the realm of the\n&gt;previous Zwick bedeviled-hero films, &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Courage\n&gt;Under Fire&quot; and &quot;The Siege.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;And I do mean squarely. &quot;Samurai&quot; is a mythic western that\n&gt;combines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in\n&gt;Japanese culture: John Ford&#39;s &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot; It\n&gt;depicts phalanxes of troops moving with deliberate,\n&gt;terrifying fervor across the very wide screen.\n&gt;\n&gt;And this time Tom Cruise, the can-do idol of millions, uses\n&gt;his polished-chrome smile mirthlessly. At least for the\n&gt;first hour, his grin looks like a faded tattoo. The uneven\n&gt;&quot;Samurai&quot; is a can-do movie that&#39;s far more effective at\n&gt;communicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more\n&gt;intimate ones.\n&gt;\n&gt;Mr. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a burned-out former Army\n&gt;officer and Indian fighter. Having survived Custer&#39;s Last\n&gt;Stand in 1876, he is now a commercial sideshow prop,\n&gt;demonstrating the newest Winchester rifle. As Algren\n&gt;lumbers through the clichï¿½s he&#39;s hired to recite before\n&gt;blasting away at targets - though the whiskey oozing from\n&gt;his pores probably makes him more of a danger than the\n&gt;weapon - a sudden ember of regret flames in this\n&gt;ex-soldier&#39;s eyes. He goes off the script, reciting the\n&gt;horrors of a campaign in which he and his troops\n&gt;slaughtered innocents.\n&gt;\n&gt;Algren looks so wasted and beleaguered that the biggest\n&gt;question is not whether he&#39;ll wing an audience member with\n&gt;a stray shot, but whether he can bear up under the dense,\n&gt;cast-iron plot. After being bounced by the Winchester\n&gt;folks, Algren is hired by his former commander, Colonel\n&gt;Bagley (Tony Goldwyn, playing a salamanderlike ancestor of\n&gt;all the sleazy characters he&#39;s ever portrayed). Bagley\n&gt;wants Algren to travel with him to Tokyo and train Japanese\n&gt;soldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles. The\n&gt;Meiji emperor is ready to accept the ways of the West; he&#39;s\n&gt;actually being pressured to by American business interests.\n&gt;\n&gt;Once in Japan, Algren is forced to send his nervous,\n&gt;underprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against\n&gt;an enemy of the emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken\n&gt;Watanabe). Despite the imperial army&#39;s modern weapons,\n&gt;Katsumoto and his men sweep in with ferocity and wield\n&gt;their arms of the past - swords and spears - with lethal\n&gt;effectiveness. The cinematographer, John Toll, films their\n&gt;arrival through a thick fog in a forest, as if Katsumoto&#39;s\n&gt;men were ghosts from the recent past out to rob Algren&#39;s\n&gt;troops of their backbones - and their lives.\n&gt;\n&gt;In their ritual armor, Katsumoto&#39;s men make quick work of\n&gt;their foes; there&#39;s tragicomic relief as Algren&#39;s\n&gt;conscripted farmers tremble while trying to load their\n&gt;guns. When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto&#39;s second in\n&gt;command, he&#39;s captured by the invaders and, even more\n&gt;bewildering, cared for by Katsumoto&#39;s sister, Taka\n&gt;(Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren murdered.\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s a complicated story, and Mr. Zwick is complicated,\n&gt;too: he loves arrogance slapped out of its self-regard.\n&gt;Algren is full of himself, even though he&#39;s conceived as a\n&gt;man who was second tenor to a legend; he knew and despised\n&gt;Custer. Looking fashionably distressed, with slightly\n&gt;puffy, red-rimmed eyes that at the very least suggest that\n&gt;he&#39;s survived a grueling press junket, Mr. Cruise has a\n&gt;worn cockiness. His aw-shucks virility is a little wilted,\n&gt;if not mildewed, around the edges: a kind of reverse\n&gt;narcissism, since Algren is proud of his dissolution\n&gt;(though Mr. Cruise&#39;s good-boy posture works for a man\n&gt;reared under the disciplinary rigors of the military).\n&gt;\n&gt;Although at times Mr. Cruise comes off as too contemporary\n&gt;for the 19th century - at one point, he seems to be waiting\n&gt;for a cellphone call to confirm his terms for a cover of\n&gt;Details magazine - this displacement fits better when he\n&gt;becomes a prisoner. Algren appears to be reacting to this\n&gt;strange new world through sounds; nothing he&#39;s hearing\n&gt;makes any sense to him. He&#39;s a mangy gaijin that Edgar Rice\n&gt;Burroughs might have invented, though James Clavell got\n&gt;there eventually.\n&gt;\n&gt;The film includes notable performances by actors not\n&gt;drafted to shoulder the burden of the entire production.\n&gt;Billy Connolly, emanating a gamy, sly menace that he&#39;s\n&gt;rarely suggested before, plays Algren&#39;s former sergeant at\n&gt;arms, Zebulon Gant. Gant, used to propping up his old\n&gt;friend and superior officer, joins Algren in the journey to\n&gt;Japan. Mr. Connolly&#39;s loose, hostile vivacity registers so\n&gt;clearly that it&#39;s obvious we won&#39;t be seeing very much of\n&gt;him. But this is crackling, rigorous comic work; he doesn&#39;t\n&gt;have to present the face of tragedy.\n&gt;\n&gt;The far more weighted and daring acting comes from Mr.\n&gt;Watanabe, as Katsumoto. Probably best known outside of\n&gt;Japan as the reedy, restless sidekick in the gourmand\n&gt;classic &quot;Tampopo,&quot; Mr. Watanabe has filled out physically\n&gt;and spiritually. The formality he brings to Katsumoto is\n&gt;hard-won, especially when he&#39;s having pointedly thoughtful\n&gt;conversations with Algren that sound more like translations\n&gt;of ideograms than actual dialogue.\n&gt;\n&gt;The film never really explains how or why this resolute,\n&gt;isolated samurai learned to speak English better than the\n&gt;emperor. His fluency doesn&#39;t quite make sense, though it\n&gt;gives the movie some needed mystique. It plays better than\n&gt;the inexorable pull of romance, drawing Taka and Algren\n&gt;together.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; which Mr. Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz\n&gt;wrote with John Logan, from a story by Mr. Logan,\n&gt;super-glues together a host of contradictions.\n&gt;Unfortunately, as dramatized, they function as conventions\n&gt;that are older than the story the film is weaving. The\n&gt;movie, which opens nationwide today, is most watchable\n&gt;during the majestic brutality of the battle sequences. This\n&gt;is not only because of the handsome staging, but also\n&gt;because the keywords sacrifice and honor are evoked with\n&gt;verve and simplicity, more so than in the &quot;exchange of\n&gt;idea&quot; chats between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like\n&gt;statements being read into the Congressional Record by\n&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n&gt;\n&gt;Mr. Zwick has absorbed the lethal agility of Akira\n&gt;Kurosawa; what registers just as powerfully as the sureness\n&gt;of the combatants is the ugly futility of the battles\n&gt;themselves. When the film sets up the lessons that Algren\n&gt;has to learn, the hero is not really a fish out of water;\n&gt;he&#39;s more like a big fish in a dry pond, picking up a\n&gt;lesson in Eastern deportment and philosophy a step away\n&gt;from the &quot;wax-on, wax-off&quot; curriculum of &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot;\n&gt;In those scenes presaging his Eastern conversion, Algren\n&gt;can&#39;t suppress his eagerness to learn, picking up the ways\n&gt;of the sword and the Samurai code of Bushido with an\n&gt;alacrity that&#39;s mandated for movie stars: flash-card\n&gt;education.\n&gt;\n&gt;The film&#39;s title evokes James Fenimore Cooper, though he\n&gt;had enough perspective not to make a white man &quot;the last&quot;\n&gt;in his novel. Even though &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; opts for\n&gt;Japan&#39;s cultural differences, all of the unmentioned\n&gt;hardships of a feudal society notwithstanding, the\n&gt;remaining honorable native here is an American. Is that a\n&gt;veiled way of saying that Japan&#39;s old ways were doomed\n&gt;after all?\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is rated R (Under 17 requires\n&gt;accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence,\n&gt;including enough ritualistic bloodletting for a week on the\n&gt;History Channel; alcohol use; strong language; and a chaste\n&gt;hint of sexuality.\n&gt;\n&gt;THE LAST SAMURAI\n&gt;\n&gt;Directed by Edward Zwick; written by John Logan, Marshall\n&gt;Herskovitz and Mr. Zwick, based on a story by Mr. Logan;\n&gt;director of photography, John Toll; edited by Steven\n&gt;Rosenblum and Victor du Bois; music by Hans Zimmer;\n&gt;production designer, Lilly Kilvert; produced by Mr. Zwick,\n&gt;Mr. Herskovitz, Tom Cruise, Paula Wagner, Scott Kroopf and\n&gt;Tom Engelman; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.
