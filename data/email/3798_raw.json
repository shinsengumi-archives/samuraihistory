Then click emulaators, and then\n&gt; pick the genesis \n&gt; one.  Sfter you download the emulator, click on roms\n&gt; on the right \n&gt; hand side and pick Genesis.  THe games are arranged\n&gt; in alphabetical \n&gt; order.  They have a lot of games for genesis, and\n&gt; they do not take up \n&gt; much space on the hard drive.   To play you open\n&gt; your genesis \n&gt; emulators, and then click file, open rom, and then\n&gt; pick the game that \n&gt; you have saved to your computer.  Kind of a round\n&gt; about way to get it \n&gt; I guess, but it is free.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
