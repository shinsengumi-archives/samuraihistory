Again it was:\n\n&quot;While this is quite vague it could very well be the origins of the \nmage hairstyle amoung the ruling classes. Tenmu ruled in the late 7th \ncentury.&quot;\n\nBut the exchange was also talking about _why_, or rather why not, the \nmage may have come about.  And I see that in a separate message you \ndo agree with my point (made above) that the mage is not a hairstyle \nthat came about for some benefit in combat.\n\nIt&#39;s nice to know I was essentially correct on both points!\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
