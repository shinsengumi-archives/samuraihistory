The Jidai Geki\n&gt; channel comes with most of them.\n\nHmm...my real estate agent is handling those\nnegotiations, so I&#39;m not really sure, but if it comes\nwith most of them, hopefully I&#39;ll get it. \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking about the list of books I sent you.\n&gt; You might try finding\n&gt; them at the Japan Foundation. The Foundation&#39;s\n&gt; office here in Kyoto has a\n&gt; well stocked lending library. I am sure the Tokyo\n&gt; one would have even\n&gt; better.\n\nI&#39;ll have to check that out, thanks!\n\nNate\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
