But isn&#39;t he worthy of the fame because he created a new martial art, and also because he was such a good swordsman? Just a question for all to ponder. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knew exactly how to draw both swords properly in Niten Ichi Ryu. Also could anyone tell me where I can find sources that will help me teach myself Niten Ichi Ryu, because there aren&#39;t any schools for it in my area.\n \n                                                                                  Thanks,\n \n                                                                                           Joel\n\n\n&quot;Perceive that which cannot be seen with the eye.&quot;\n                       \n                                 - Miyamoto Mushashi\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
