I found that =\r\nin a Japanese history book, but the actual source\nwas not listed.  Since Sh=\r\ninano was Shingen&#39;s only option for movement\nbecause he was allied with the=\r\n Imagawa and couldn&#39;t move soldiers\nthrough Suruga, was he even trying to g=\r\net to Echigo at all (he could\nhave been making moves to the West), or did h=\r\nis foray into Echigo\nsimply bring Kenshin down on him even though he hadn&#39;t=\r\n intended to\neven bother with Echigo?\n\n\n"
