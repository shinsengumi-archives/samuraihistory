At least I think it is the same one.  I have \nseen it advertised as Heaven and Earth.  The movie is at least \nloosely based on the rivaly between Takeda Shingen and Uesugi \nKenshin.  The charater of Kagetora is ,of course, Uesugi.  As to how \nmuch of the movie is real about the battle, and other things I am not \nsure.  But Kagetora&#39;s banner is the same as Uesugi&#39;s, and is a \nreligious fanatic... just like Uesugi was.  Takeda and Uesugi fought \nseveral  battles against eachother, but grew to respect eachother a \ngreat deal.  Another good samurai movie is Taboo.  However, it does \nnot take place durring the Sengoku Jidai.  Rather it takes place \ndurring the Tokugawa period involving the Shinzen Gumi.  1860 \nsomething to be as exact as I can off the top of my head.  Which \nmakes it at the tail end of the Tokugawa period.  Akira Kurasawa \nmovies are really good if you want to see movies set in the Sengoku \nJidai.  I dont know of any other though, and wouldlike to find out as \nwell.\n\n\n\n"
