Even pilots carried Katanas. \n\nMichael Lorimer &lt;mijalo_jp@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:In regard to whether the WW2 officers in the Imperial Army considered =\r\nthemselves &#39;samurai&#39;, I would like to add a specific example of my neighbou=\r\nr in Hiroshima. Over rather a few tokkuri of warm sake in recent months he =\r\nhas been regaling me with stories of when he served in Manchuria, much as m=\r\ny grandfather did with his stories from North Africa, Italy, the Middle Eas=\r\nt and India. He clearly found that while officers were more than often not =\r\nof samurai stock, but considered themselves the successors of that class, p=\r\nerhaps in a similar manner to which many yakuza consider themselves modern =\r\nsamurai.\nSo why did they carry swords? Why do officers in many officers aro=\r\nund the world carry swords? If you view the photographs of the carnage on t=\r\nhe Western Front during WW1 you will still see officers leading their troop=\r\ns sword in hand. Why? Distinction.  Still, the officer has to be seen as su=\r\nperior to his/her men/women (not to be accused of sexism) and the sword is =\r\nan obvious symbol universally of such a principle.  A man with a sword has =\r\nalways ranked higher than one with a spear or musket.\nM.Lorimer \n\nCesare Po=\r\nlenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote: \n\nOn Feb 5, 2004, at 10:54 AM, Josh W=\r\nilson wrote:\n\n&gt; Tony, not to dispute you, but why was your response about t=\r\nhe officers \n&gt; considering themselves samurai incorrect??
