Protagaros was an agnostic in ancient greece. He sa=\r\nid\nthat he could neither say that the gods exist or that they do not exist.=\r\n\nThomas H. Huxly natural scientist and agnostic, said that the knowledge\nof=\r\n the existance of god or any deity can not be obteind by man, for man\nis no=\r\nt advanced enough to be able to obtain that knowled of an\nomnipotent and om=\r\nniscifient beeing.\n\nIn other words I do not accept nor deny the existance o=\r\nf God.\n\nOkay, I should have frased it differntly. For that I apologise. \n\nW=\r\nhat atrocities other than those common to ther era and nature of the\nmideva=\r\nl age, has happend in Sweden? If we were to disseminate all the\nbad things =\r\nthat happend during the mideval ages, I dare to say that all\ncountries are =\r\nguilty to some extent. I mean totally choking massslaying\nof people, that i=\r\nn the mideval ages would be called an autrocity.\n\nSo you found my funny lit=\r\ntle email adress. Yes i am very proud of that\nlittle joke ^_^\nIt was given =\r\nto me by a friend in Estland (Estonia), since baka is the\nword i use when i=\r\n swear, instead of the usual swedish &quot;Faan ocks=E5!&quot; and\nthat the Anime por=\r\ntal he is building in Estland happen to have the same\ndomain name, he gave =\r\nit to me as a joke. I am very proud of it, since it\nis befitting to my sens=\r\ne of humor.\n\nAnd when we are on the topic of emails, you sign your email as=\r\n &quot;Octavio\nAugusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho&quot; but in the From space it says =\r\n&quot;Me=F0al\nMikit St=F3r-ljon Oddhinsson&quot; and that if my maind hasen&#39;t gon YoY=\r\no in the\nlight of day, is an Icelandic name. And that does explain why you =\r\nknow\nmore about Swedish history than I do. I know a bit, but not nearly as\n=\r\nmuch as you do.\n \n\n\n\n/// Chris Peder Danyael Vighagen       who ever has th=\r\ne most names when\nhe dies winns =3D=3D) \n\n&quot;God&#39;s in his heaven. All&#39;s right=\r\n with the world&quot; \n\n\n\n"
