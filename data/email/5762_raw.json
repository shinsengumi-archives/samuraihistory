If you cant give a single\n&gt; detail more on this, or even where you found it, I can\n&gt; guarantee that no one will be able to help you...\n\nWell, granted the original presentation was far from scholarly, but surely\nI&#39;m not the only one to (a) find it intriguing and (b) find a little bell\nringing in my head, not from the Sengoku Jidai but from mid-Edo.  Granted\nthe riposte from our original questioner was a far from measured response,\nbut the replies from Dear List Owner and others whose name/s escape me\nhardly encourages anyone to ask any question at all, no matter how seemingly\nnot PC for the eminent scholars on this list.  Reminds of the lampoons I\nhave got...  So, why do I persist with this list?  Because I love the\nsubject matter and see it as an important adjunct to my sword studies and\ncollecting, and because the awesome knowledge of practitioners in the field\njust takes my breath away.\n\nCan&#39;t we be a little less uptight on this list??\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia - just over the road from Jim Breen&#39;s campus)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
