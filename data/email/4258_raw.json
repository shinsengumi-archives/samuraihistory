But for what it&#39;s worth:\n\n&gt;Who really wore topknots and why? I understand the topknot was very important \n&gt;to the samurai class, but why in various prints, paintings and historical \n&gt;depictions of the times peasants are also showen with semi-shaven heads and \n&gt;topknots?\n\nIt might help to define what era of Japanese history you&#39;re thinking \nof. In my recollection the top-knot (mage) is something that came \nabout in the Heian period - about the 12th century and beyond. At \nthat time it seems that it was exclusively a samurai-class \nhairstyle. But later - especially very late, such as the Edo period - \nthe mage became fashionable among broader classes.\n\n&gt;I&#39;ve read the reason samurai semi-shaved their heads was for an easier and \n&gt;more comfortable fit when wearing a helmet. Fact or fiction? \n\nThis is definitely the standard explanation. It is also commonly said \nthat the shaving came from earlier (again around the Heian \nperiod) and was related to the particular hats that were in \nfashion at the time. These were called e-boushi and kanmuri. Here is \na good site that shows what they looked like:\nhttp://kariginu.jp/kikata/2-2.htm\n\nBut for what it&#39;s worth, in my opinion this is probably just a (very \nwell accepted) urban myth or legend. The shaving of the head strikes \nme as essentially fashion. Other cultures had helmets but not \nhead-shaving.\n\n&gt;Whilst all samurai seemed to have a topknot unless they were monks not all \n&gt;seemsd to shave the top part of their heads, why?  \n\nAgain it&#39;s basically fashion. There are many different types of styles \nthat were popular across a long range of years. Some of them have \nshaved heads, some do not. By the way the most commonly depicted style \nof shaved head and the one you are probably thinking of is called the \n&quot;sakayaki&quot; style.\n\nHope this helps a little, in the absence of more expert answers.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
