I&#39;m surprised that a=\r\n\nkatana is sometimes called as a samurai!\n\n Some western people think a kat=\r\nana is something special weapon. But a\nkatana is just a sword. It is true t=\r\nhat a katana is well forged and it\ncan cut many things.\n\n A samurai is orig=\r\ninally a person who guards aristocrats. They like \nknights. Then they got p=\r\nower and fight each other for concession.Then\nthey became worriers and they=\r\n always have katanas.\n\n In a word, a katana is a sword and a samurai is a k=\r\nnight.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
