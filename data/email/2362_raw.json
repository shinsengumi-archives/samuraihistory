Seems you&#39;ve got a personal\nconnection with the man--that&#39;s great. \n\nTurnbull takes a lot of flak for not being very\n&quot;academic&quot;. That&#39;s fine, as far as most people are\nconcerned--how many of us here REALLY care to read\nabout the shift in the Kokudaka taxation system and\nit&#39;s effects on Sanuki province in 1590? Fascinating\nstuff, let me tell you. \n\nTurnbull has done excellent work in making Samurai\nhistory ACCESSIBLE. It&#39;s popular history--not going to\nwin praise from people who shut themselves in academic\nivory towers, but if someone wants to read about the\nSamurai, they have someone to read--between Turnbull\nand Tony Bryant, that covers about all you&#39;ll find in\nyour average B.Dalton&#39;s. \n\nYes, Turnbull&#39;s work IS repetitive, which can be\nmaddening--sometimes it appears that he is a master at\nrepackaging in order to make more money. He uses the\nsame anecdotes in many of his books--I can find at\nleast one that he uses three seperate times. And\nsometeimes what he writes is flat wrong, or\ncontradictory. I&#39;ve heard many people criticize that,\nas have I in the past. BUT--while I won&#39;t hold him up\nas a paragon of research, did anyone ever stop to\nthink that maybe the reason he wrote one thing in 1979\nand something contradictory in 1995 is that he found\nNEW evidence or realized he was wrong? Could be...\n\nNo one is perfect. But no one else has made available,\nin English, the sheer amount of information that he\nhas--who cares if it&#39;s rehashes of Rekishi Gunzo or if\nthere are minor mistakes? I&#39;m a qualified Japanese\nlinguist according to the US Army (just took my\nrecertification test and passed this morning! go me!)\nand Rekishi Gunzo kicks my behind when I try to read\nit! And I&#39;d rather have people confused or mistaking\nthe date that a particular battle took place because\nthey read Turnbull than believing HALF the crap we see\ncome across the board about &quot;ninjas&quot; vs. &quot;samurais&quot;\nand so forth. \n\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;d use Turnbull as a major source in a\ndoctoral thesis--I&#39;d probably go to HIS sources and\nuse them directly. BUT, I have many of his books, plan\nto get more, and they are great to read to get good\ninformation in an engaging way. \n\n\nNate\n\n\n--- &quot;shogun.uk&quot; &lt;shogun.uk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well..... Seeing battle lines are being drawn up I\n&gt; had better take up my position on the defences!!\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Now, as another english author did say... &quot;let loose\n&gt; the dogs of war!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;                         Rod Johnson  :-)\n&gt; \n&#92;\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"
