I am of course drawing a parallel between the policies and actions of the European settlers/US government towards Native Americans and the Emishi/Ainu/etc....\n\n Not just in the land-grabbing and killing--- but we also saw many Emishi come to work for the new Emperor(s) --- just like some natives allied with the new US.\n\n We also see that the tactics brought in from the old country (Europe for US, China for Japan) were no match against the guerilla tactics of the natives---and newer devices and strategies had to be made to fight them.\n\n Also--the idea that many Ainu hid their ethnic origins to avoid problems reminds me of many native families (that can) hiding their origins to avoid problems.\n\n As far as I know though...there are not any &quot;Japanese reservations&quot;.. but both groups still fight over &quot;indigenous rights&quot;...\n\n Etc.etc....\n\n     However, I would say this pattern is common anytime a foreign invader comes in and &quot;colonizes&quot; an area..\n\n But, still.. I would say that is applies. \n\n Thoughts? \n\n\n\n      \n\n\n"
