The value of a sword with excellent engravings or \nforged by two or more smiths or with historical significance is often \ndoubled. \n\nTrivia Time\n\nDid you know that prior to World War 2 there ware around one and a \nhalf millions swords in existence in Japan, one third being Daito. At \npresent, there are no more than on hundred thousand swords in Japan. \nIn fact, there are more samurai swords in America today than there \nare in Japan. An Estimated 250,000 to 350,000 swords have been \nbrought into the country as souvenirs by returning service men.\n\n\n\n\n"
