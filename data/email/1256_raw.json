The procedure is described in more detail in Nitobe&#39;s famous\nwork, &quot;Bushido.&quot;\n\nCleaning the blade required complete removal from the scabbard, followed\nby application of a light powder (uchigo), which was then cleaned away \nwith a soft\nrice paper, or sometimes with silk. Finally a very fine coat of oil of \ncloves\n(choji abura) would be applied to the steel with a clean cloth.\n\nToramitsu wrote:\n\n&gt;Traditionally a Samurai would only &quot;Break the Seal&quot; if he intended to use the sword. It was the symbol of his soul, not a bragging tool. Besides, the weaponsmiths reputation would speak for itself. At least thats what I&#39;ve come to understand. \n&gt; j cool &lt;jcool58801@...&gt; wrote:A friend and I got into a discusion about when a\n&gt;samurai would draw his sword.
