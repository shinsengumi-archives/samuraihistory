But never forget her primary use : to\nkill trough cutting.   Be very respectful with her and\naround her.   Remember\nwhat you have in your hands is a Shin Ken and although\nit is a recent made blade I know for shore it has a\nvery sharp and excellent edge.\n   Also please avoid trying tameshigiri if you do not\nknow what you are doing, you can ruin your blade and\neven worst, get very seriously injured.\n   Finally, if you are not practicing any martial art\nsuch as Kendo or my beloved Iaido, I strongly\nencourage you to do it in order to learn more about\nyour Shin ken.   Only through the right path you will\nenjoy it the most.\n\n   Best regards.\n\n Federico.\n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n"
