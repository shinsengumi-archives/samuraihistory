Being Japanese doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re required\n&gt; to commit seppuku.\n&gt; A legitimate point, to be sure.  But by way of\n&gt; background, my father used a\n&gt; .30-06 on himself as a way of redeeming his honour\n&gt; (an oversimplification,\n&gt; but pretty accurate), and it&#39;s left me with a\n&gt; profound distaste for that\n&gt; method of departure. \n\nMy condolences. I don&#39;t wish to sound callous, but\nyour feelings seem to be more directed at suicide in\ngeneral, rather than seppuku in particular. Again, you\ndon&#39;t have to be Japanese to commit suicide (as you\ntragically are aware) and you don&#39;t have to commit\nseppuku to be Japanese. \n\nOf course I agree that &quot;sticking it out&quot; is much more\nhonorable than what many in the west call suicide,\n&quot;taking the easy way out&quot;. Even if that way is neither\neasy nor pleasant. \n\n&gt; \tThank you for the corrections.  Is it also\n&gt; incorrect, then, that the act\n&gt; was filmed?  I had understood this to be the case.\n\nIt may have been, I&#39;m not sure. I know that a short\nwhile before, Mishima made a movie where the pivotal\nscene was a seppuku (performed by him), a sort of\nforeshadowing, if you will. The scene was intensely\ngraphic, and if I believe correctly he actually did\ncut himself (on accident this time). Copious amounts\nof fake blood were used. This is third hand info, as\nI&#39;ve not seen the scene, and only had it described by\nmy Japanese lit teacher in college (a few years back).\nThe recreation of the recreation is recreated in the\nbiographical movie of his life. \n\n The poet\n&gt; who wrote _The Narrow\n&gt; Road to the Far North_, even.  (Yet another name\n&gt; I&#39;ve forgotten over the\n&gt; years.)  Again, this is not meant to criticise you. \n&gt; What is it about\n&gt; Mishima that affects you so, if I may ask?\n\nMatsuo Basho is the poet you&#39;re looking for. And I\nagree, I&#39;ve got no desire to emulate Mishima.\nPersonally, he was a nutjob, out of touch with\nreality, as was proven when he attempted to cause a\ncoup and even the students at Ichigaya laughed at him.\nThe books of his I&#39;ve read are, well, disturbing.\nHardly my favorite author, much less someone who&#39;d\nmake me want to be Japanese. \n\nMurakami Haruki, OTOH...\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
