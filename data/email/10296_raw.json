Three S-A forum members, LtDom=\r\ner, LordAmeth, and myself will all be attending, so just to make an event o=\r\nut of it, we&#39;ll bring you live coverage of the event (relatively) via twitt=\r\ner (@samuraiarchives & @toranosukev) and you can also create a twitter sear=\r\nch for #AASConference which we&#39;ll endeavor to add to the tweets. Also keep =\r\nan eye here, the forum, on the facebook page, and the blog will be where th=\r\ne summaries of the most interesting presentations will be posted. I will al=\r\nso have my digital audio recorder, vid recorder, and camera, so I&#39;ll see if=\r\n anyone will give me permission to record, and also we&#39;ll be putting togeth=\r\ner audio for a potential podcast based on the event as well. \n\nHere is a li=\r\nnk to the conference page: \nhttp://www.asian-studies.org/Conference/index.h=\r\ntm \n\nHere&#39;s a recent post on the blog detailing the event:\nhttp://shogun-ya=\r\nshiki.blogspot.com/2011/03/joint-aas-icas-joint-conference-in.html\n\nHere ar=\r\ne some of the presentations I intend to go to: \n\nSession 72: Monks of the F=\r\nive Mountains & Shogunal Patronage of Zen in the Making of Muromachi Cultur=\r\ne \nSession 192: Negotiating One&#39;s Place in Japan&#39;s Long Sixteenth Century \n=\r\nSession 321: Before and After the Banquet: Culinary Discourse in Japan (150=\r\n0-1900) \nSession 541: Elite Patronage and Viewership of Japanese Art in the=\r\n Age of the Toyotomi-Tokugawa Transition \nSession 560: From Horseriders to =\r\nBuddhist Devotees: China, Korea, and Japan at the Intersection of Visual Cu=\r\nlture in the 5th-7th Centuries \nSession 614: History, Literature, and Relig=\r\nion: Toward a New Paradigm for Kokugaku \nSession 659: Nagasaki in the Eight=\r\neenth Century: Commercial and Institutional Change From Inside and Out \n\n\nT=\r\nhat still leaves me with space for at least five more presentations which I=\r\n haven&#39;t decided on yet. The more than 100 lectures and presentations can b=\r\ne found here: \nhttp://www.asian-studies.org/Conference/Print-Program.htm \n\n=\r\n\n"
