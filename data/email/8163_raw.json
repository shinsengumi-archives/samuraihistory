A Japanese historical \nnovel called &quot;Musashi&quot; was published in the 30&#39;s and is also avilable \nin English. I believe that Inagaki&#39;s movie is based on this novel.  \nLast I heard, there is relatively little authoritatively available \nabout Musaashi&#39;s life. He is generally believed to have fought on the \nloosing side of Sekigaraha and both battles of Osaka Castle, but to \nhave later served the Tokugawa&#39;s during the Shimabara no Ran (1637-8). \nThere are a number of artifacts especially paintings and calligraphy  \nwhich are attributed to him. Please do not try to use the traditions of \nmodern martial ryuha to document Musashi. Lots of these groups claim \ndescent from him, but there is often little to show that this descent \nis really authentic.\n\n\n\n\n"
