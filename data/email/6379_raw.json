Still not sure if I can write in a sensible \nmanner, but I&#39;ll try.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had early on in your writing alluded to &#39;the \nartist&#39;s eye&#39;, and to perceptions that others might miss.   Some people seem \nto have an ability to perceive that is so sensitive as to appear \n&#39;supernatural&#39;, or &#39;mystic&#39;.  Artists, particularly those of Eastern arts, \nincluding martial,  are taught (or advised) to learn to put aside their own \nego and absorb their environment, especially in the beginning, of their \ntraining.  Later on they have learned, or should have learned, to \nincorporate their ego into their perceptions &#39;properly&#39;, and &#39;become one&#39; \nwith the world around them.  Clumsily and said in clichï¿½ form, forgive me, \nbut that means to me that the person has become the same ego inside and out, \nand is in a state of &#39;constant harmony&#39; with their environment....   a place \nin their existence where perception of and response to their environment is \nso well ingrained that the individual appears to have some kind of &#39;power&#39;.  \n  It&#39;s not power; it is &#39;mushin&#39;.....   at rest,  this concept is \n&#39;zanshin&#39;.............   but this you know already.\n\nAs a person who has knit, crocheted, embroidered, and sewn since she was 7 \nyears old,  the catalog of impressions my brain has stored about fabrics, \nyarns, and threads is more than I can consciously recall. We in the \nknitter&#39;s realm have a concept of yarn &#39;telling us what it wants to be&#39;  \nsuch that we say the yarn &#39;speaks to us&#39;.  Other knitters I know scoff at us \nabout &#39;mysticism&#39;, and proceed to knit with yarn obviously unsuited to their \nproject and they are wailing and complaining about a &#39;troublesome project&#39;.  \nThey wonder at how others of us can &#39;make it look so easy&#39;.  I try to \ndescribe the way I personally &#39;hear&#39; my yarn or fabric is not in words per \nse, but in a mind-full picture conjured by that store of impressions already \nthere.  If the needle size is wrong for the yarn, it will appear to &#39;fight&#39; \nbeing knit.\n\nAnother person who paints, draws, or writes is tuned to a different store of \ninformation, as are swordsmiths and all other artisans.   Persons who \ndevelop several avenues of pursuit get better at amalgamating information \nand perceptions of those arts into a cohesiveness, a &#39;way&#39; of responding to \ntheir environment that to others can seem a bit unreal, but it is not.  It \nis simply being and staying aware and responsive to the cues given by one&#39;s \nenvironment.\n\nHealth care providers, particularly nurses, also undergo a barrage of \nsensory input that is beyond conscious recall, but some of them can take in \nthe appearance of a patient, and the summation of impressions that &#39;come up \non screen&#39; &#39;tells&#39; them that something is not going well.  It&#39;s that &#39;gut&#39; \nfeeling.\n\nSoldiers also develop that catalog, unfortunately, with experience in \nbattle; Nathan can undoubtedly expound on this subject  much better than I.  \nSome groundwork is certainly laid with intensive training.\n\nWhat do my previous words have to do with swords that  seem to &#39;speak&#39;?\n\nI think it has more to do with the person who is handling the sword, than it \ndoes with the sword itself.  I think it is that awareness, that catalog of \nphysical and visual impressions gathered over time, and the ability to allow \none&#39;s mind to create a meaningful picture.\n\nOf course I have a lot more to say,  also about the way a samurai may have \nperceived his blade,  but it mostly enters into the realm of psychology, so \nI won&#39;t go there unless there is interest in further discussion.  This is, \nafter all, a history list.\n\nOff to work with me....\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
