And since it \nis a Japanese novel, you have to assume that the author has access to \nall sorts of japanese research that doesn&#39;t appear in english, which \nwas why I was wondering if maybe the thing about Nobunaga might have \ncome from some sort of real source.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;William letham&quot; \n&lt;mickey.letham@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yes I think its probably fiction too, but I read manga which \ndepicted a\n&gt; boyhood friendship between Ieyasu and Nobunaga during his years as a\n&gt; hostage. Then in a TV movie about Ieyasu (with Kitaoji Kinya) had \nIeyasu and\n&gt; Nobunaga exchanging fond memories of their childhood together like \ntwo\n&gt; drunken salarymen.\n\n\n"
