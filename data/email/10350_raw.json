That&#39;s fine I guess- I&#39;m a budding writer\n&gt; and you need to know the good things to, but for the life of me I\n&gt; can&#39;t find the appropriate list of matching Sins.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Christianity as a whole has Sins and Virtues, as do most religions\n&gt; and cultures in the world. They always come as a matching pair. So if\n&gt; Samurai have Virtues based on Bushido and the like, it would stand to\n&gt; reason they have Sins, too. But I can&#39;t find them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So...do they exist, and I&#39;m just missing them? If so, does anybody\n&gt; know what they are?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Setting aside the debate about whether Samurai ever really &quot;followed\n&gt; Bushido&quot; for a moment - take whatever virtues you&#39;ve found, and\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t the opposite be the &quot;sin&quot;? I don&#39;t think &quot;sin&quot; in a secular\n&gt; medieval Japanese context is the right word though - not to mention,\n&gt; Bushido is definitely not a religion, although the impression I get is\n&gt; that some modern Western martial artists will little knowledge of\n&gt; Japanese history treat it like it is.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
