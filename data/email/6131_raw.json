I don&#39;t know much about the period.  &quot;Why,&quot; then, you ask=\r\n, &quot;are \nyou on here?&quot;  I suppose I&#39;ll learn a lot by reading the posts, eh?=\r\n  \nThat&#39;s also why I won&#39;t be saying much, since at this time, I have \nnoth=\r\ning to draw from to speak.  Wait, I saw a movie with Tom Cruise \nin it... i=\r\nt was called, I think, &quot;Top Gun.&quot;  Samurai use F14s... \nno, &#39;fraid I&#39;m wron=\r\ng.  It was a different movie, where he was on an \nisland... ah, &quot;Far and Aw=\r\nay.&quot;  No.  Wait.  I&#39;ll get it.  Was it \ncalled &quot;The Last Scientologist&quot;? (Y=\r\nes, I know, you&#39;re all grinding \nyour teeth... in unison... It&#39;s like when =\r\npeople think that Kate \nBlanchet in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; was a good representation o=\r\nf history for \nTudor England.  And Ninjaburger.com is the end-all for learn=\r\ning the \nhistory of the Ninja, you know.  [See #3 below.])\n\n2.  You lot are=\r\n prolific (that is, for you aspiring elementary \nteachers: &quot;pro=B7lif=B7ic =\r\n(pr-lfk) adj.  Producing abundant works or \nresults: a prolific artist. See=\r\n Synonyms at fertile.&quot;--\nDictionary.com).  Notwithstanding the literary ach=\r\nievements of \nvarious aspiring elementary teachers and their ilk (look at a=\r\nll them \nthere nickel words!), it appears it&#39;s going to take me a month or =\r\n\ntwo to wade through the sheer mass of posts.  I am assuming that \nbecause =\r\nthe forum is moderated, the ratio of dross to content will \nbe very low, an=\r\nd that much of the content is going to be quite \nspecific, rather than broa=\r\nd generalizations that we should all know \nbecause we read a book once in s=\r\nchool.  (This, of course, does not \neven come close to applying to those of=\r\n you who have WRITTEN the \nbooks, rather than just read them.)\n\n3.  Ninjabu=\r\nrger.com?  Even my pet, who has no opposable thumbs, and \ncan barely rememb=\r\ner or perceive beyond eat/excrete/sleep, knows this \nis a joke site.  Then =\r\nagain, people believe that there are infected \nAIDS needles hidden in gas p=\r\nump handles and that there&#39;s a Nigerian \nwho is going to give them a couple=\r\n million dollars for one bank \ntransaction...\n\nQ.  No, I don&#39;t study any ma=\r\nrtial arts (though I&#39;m familiar with, \nbut not a practitioner, of the fruit=\r\ns of that old bigamist, Mr. \nOkazaki, known as Jujitsu).  \n\n5.  No, I&#39;m not=\r\n doing a report on Samurai for school and need you \nall to do my research f=\r\nor me.\n\n6.  No, I&#39;m not doing a website on Samurai and need you all to do m=\r\ny \nresearch for me.\n\n7.  No, I&#39;m not in the military, either, but kudos and=\r\n thank you to \nthose of you who are now serving.\n\n8.  No, I&#39;m not in the S.=\r\nC.A. \n\n9.  Samurai is spelled with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;  Samurai is spelled \n=\r\nwith a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;  Samurai is spelled with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot; \n(Thank=\r\n you MS Word spellchecker.)  This should be good enough to \nkeep Mr. Ledbet=\r\nter mollified... but if I slip and spell it with \nan &quot;a,&quot; may I get a &quot;Get =\r\nOut of Spelling Jail Free&quot; card, please?\n\nI look forward to learning about =\r\nthe period.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll run into \na good reading list somewhere on a rec=\r\nommended website and will be \nable to locate the most common texts at my lo=\r\ncal library (the Los \nAngeles County Central Library... which has an impres=\r\nsive amount of \nbooks, to be sure.  Most of them are not relevant).  In fac=\r\nt, my \nsearch method will probably be to start in the Japanese history \nsec=\r\ntion and see what&#39;s there, start broad, and then narrow it down \nas I famil=\r\niarize myself with who the players are in the history.  \n\nCheers.\n\nMatt\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n"
