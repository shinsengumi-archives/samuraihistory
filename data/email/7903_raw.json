If you reply directly to me, I&#39;m \n&gt; going to directly answer, especially when addressed in an \n&gt; argumentative and combative manner.\n&gt; I&#39;ve got no problem if you or he/she or anyone wants to argue the \n&gt; merits and foibles of history books, in specific, or in general. I DO \n&gt; have a problem when this is couched as a counterargument to my \n&gt; statement, because it doesn&#39;t counter my statement whatsoever.\n&gt; \n&gt; What we had was this: \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate: &quot;Tangerines are not red.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dissenter: &quot;Well, neither are all apples red! So how do we really know \n&gt; which ones are red and which ones aren&#39;t? Does it matter?\n&gt; What does it matter if\n&gt; your apple is red and my tangerine is blue, as long as it inspires me? \n&gt; And certain tangerines may be of such hues of orange that they may be \n&gt; very very close to red.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Simple facts: not everyone can tell that tangerines are not red. Many \n&gt; tangerines may be so orange they are close to being red, but being red \n&gt; is not the point of a tangerine. For purposes of this analogy, all \n&gt; apples SHOULD be red--the fact that many are green or brown is a \n&gt; warning to the partaker that they need to check their apples before \n&gt; they eat them, but not grounds for saying that a. all apples are bad, \n&gt; or b.\n&gt; all tangerines are\n&gt; equally red with apples. \n&gt; \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nYahoo!
