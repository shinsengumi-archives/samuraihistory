But only to a point.  If Akechi \nMitsuhide had not intervened, there might have been peace earlier, certainly -- and \nthe key word is MIGHT, because it might NOT have -- but, come earlier or come \nlater, the cost of it would have been so much higher, starting with Nobunaga&#39;s \norder for Akechi to reinforce Toyotomi.  I read somewhere -- and I do not \nremember where -- that Nobunaga&#39;s ultimate goal was to conquer all of Japan and \nthen replace the Emperor with himself.  (Any truth to this, anybody?)\n       According to the readings I&#39;ve done, as for Nobunaga himself, he was a \nbrutal man, one of the two most brutal men alive at the time.  (The other was \nTsar Ivan IV of Russia, whose lifespan nearly mirrored that of Nobunaga, the \nformer barely outliving the latter, Ivan living 1530-1584 to Nobunaga&#39;s \n1534-1582.)  He killed his own brother because of a failed revolt in 1557 (sparing \nhis then-twice-future brother-in-law Shibata Katsuie), forced a sister (O-ichi) \nto divorce Shibata, whom he had forced to MARRY (I believe around the age of \n11!!!!!) to solidify an alliance, so he could marry her off to ANOTHER warlord \n(Asai Nagamasa) to solidify THAT alliance, killed that brother-in-law when he \nbacked an (I believe) ages-old ally (the Asakura at Anegawa, 1570), remarried \nthe sister to her first husband, and rewarded a man (Toyotomi Hideyoshi) who \nused dishonorable techniques to climb to his right hand position.  He \nneedlessly had the captives that Akechi had spared to effect a surrender put to death \n-- including a mother, which was the motivator that cost Akechi his own \nmother, and in effect started the wheels turning which brought Nobunaga to his \nseppuku at Honno-ji.\n       For the good he did, which there was certainly at least some -- \nincluding the invention of the sumo dohyo ring and the start of the unification \nprocess -- it was better in my humble estimation that he not be the one to finish \nthe unification process.  It was accomplished much more peacefully with \nHideyoshi and Tokugawa.  (BTW, I have my thoughts about that 1591 edict, too, but I \ndon&#39;t want to get into them here.)\n       Hope this helps.  :-D\n\nLater\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
