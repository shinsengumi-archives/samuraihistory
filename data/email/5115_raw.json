Same with the \nword &quot;waitress&quot;.  Maybe you should describe her a little the way you \ndid the samurai (An important looking man with a long and short sword \ntied to his waist...) rather than just call her a &quot;waitress&quot;. Not to \nmention the &quot;waitress waiting&quot; sentence is a bit awkward.\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kyle Segall&quot; \n&lt;klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well, since its ok for publishing rights, I guess I should go ahead \n&gt; and post the excerpt I&#39;ve been handing out. Tony, Nate, I know you \n&gt; two will tear it apart best as possible so I won&#39;t bother asking. \n&lt;g&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, this is the very begining of the book, its just kind of meant \n&gt; to set up the time and introduce the people to (basically) what the \n&gt; time and place was like.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"
