His book\r\n&gt; is even banned in some states, cities, and book\r\n&gt; stores. I actually saw the\r\n&gt; book in a book store and I peeked into it for a bit,\r\n&gt; and laughed at it.\r\n&gt; there is not one speck of real Ninpo in the entire\r\n&gt; book. now I read that he\r\n&gt; was found not guilty he hugged the woman that was\r\n&gt; suing him, and then pulled\r\n&gt; down his pants and defecated on the floor on the way\r\n&gt; out of court saying \r\n&gt; that is real ultimate power&quot; and vanished. Now I do\r\n&gt; not know if that is true\r\n&gt; or not but it seems to be in news sites including\r\n&gt; CNN..\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Mike\r\n\r\nHmm. Not sure I buy the last part. I&#39;d think that he\r\nwouldn&#39;t exactly be allowed to &quot;vanish&quot; after\r\ndefecating on the floor of a court room, but maybe he\r\nused his magic ninja powers. If you could find a link\r\nor two, I&#39;d be interested. \r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n__________________________________ \r\nDo you Yahoo!? \r\nYahoo!
