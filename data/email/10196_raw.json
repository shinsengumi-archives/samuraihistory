Most wounds were deep cuts. Some were bullet wounds by=\r\n the rifles\n&gt; provided by the Portuguese. Not much was written about that a=\r\ns far as I\n&gt; know. As for the dead bodies, they were burned to stop the spr=\r\nead of disease\n&gt; and as an act of respect for the fallen warriors. For thos=\r\ne who were highly\n&gt; sought after, a reward for that certain Samurai&#39;s head =\r\nwas offered by the\n&gt; Diamyo of his enemy. It had to be a fresh kill.

Specifically the\n&gt; Harubiyuna. Thier kamon is two arr=\r\now feathers inside a circle. One pointing\n&gt; upwards, and one downwards. I f=\r\nind myself both lucky and honored to be the\n&gt; descendant of Samurai. It&#39;s t=\r\nruly something to be proud of.

But as =\r\na practical matter, men wounded in battle had to be\n&gt; treated. Willingness =\r\nto die notwithstanding, a dead samurai (or ashigaru) is\n&gt; worth less to his=\r\n master than a living one. As I understand it, seppuku was\n&gt; reserved for h=\r\nopeless situations, where the only other option was capture or\n&gt; abject fai=\r\nlure (the death of one&#39;s daimyo, say).\n&gt;\n&gt; I imagine that battlefield medic=\r\nine was very catch-as-catch-can and based\n&gt; as much on Chinese medicine as =\r\nwas practical, but still, the more specifics\n&gt; I can get, the better off I&#39;=\r\nll be.
