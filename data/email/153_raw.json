Tokugawa Ieyasu himself was \napparently a good shot (as much as it was=\r\n possible to be) - but even if not=3D\r\n, he took time to learn how to use \nthe weapon and if it was OK by him it =\r\nwould have been okay by everyone. Com=3D\r\nbat samurai (pre 1600) were \nfar more pragmatic than the image we have tod=\r\nay, and samurai honour, as a c=3D\r\node that was lived rather than \npaid lip-service, reached its lowest ebb j=\r\nust prior to the emergence of the=3D\r\n Oda/Hideyoshi/Tokugawa \ntriumvirate. In those days anything went, as long=\r\n as you won. The emergence=3D\r\n of strong leaders and a unified \ncountry probably did most to bring about=\r\n a restructuring of the warrior eth=3D\r\nic. The later Edo Jidai under \nTokugawa rule completely remodelled the ide=\r\nals of the samurai, and that is =3D\r\nthe image commonly held today.\n\nThere are pictures of samurai using firear=\r\nms (although not many tales), but=3D\r\n I think the honour ethic (which \nexisted as the exception, rather than th=\r\ne rule) was primarily based on the =3D\r\nsamurai&#39;s traditional weapons. The \nproblem with firearms is that the earl=\r\ny models only really worked when used=3D\r\n en masse which made up for their \ninaccuracy, and a skilled individual wa=\r\nrrior would have felt safer with a w=3D\r\neapon he could rely on, and you could \nnot really rely on an arquebus.
