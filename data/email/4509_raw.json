I need to study more on this area. My size is 5&#39; 9&quot; 160 athletic build. I really appreciate the help. I&#39;m just breaking into the study of the Samurai, ancient Japan, Armour, swords , the hole nine yards. I plan on purchasing a horse next spring and attempt to kit the horse out with reproduction custom made saddle and trimmings. So I have a lot of reading to do. First thing is Armour .\n \nTakara \n\nMichael Peters &lt;shdwstel@...&gt; wrote:\nTakara,\n\n  Specifics make things much easier. :) That being said, how big are you? \nUnless you are fairly small antiques won&#39;t fit. Nowadays, Japanese are about \nthe same height as your average American, but 150 or more years ago you&#39;re \nlooking at more like 4&#39;11. Unfortunately the armour Tom wore was the worst \nin the movie. The Dou was poorly shaped and fitted. The lacing was terrible.\n  What you PROBABLY want is a fair modern reproduction. If I remember \ncorrectly a nuinobe dou with everything will run about $5000 from Kozando if \nyou are 5&#39;6 to 5&#39;11. Over 6&#39; you&#39;re probably looking at custom. More \nspecifics will allow me to get you some more info.\n\nMJPeters\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for the info. What I&#39;m looking for is a set of Armour from the Edo \n&gt;Period or just before, that I can use during a living history display. It \n&gt;looks good, functions well and will not fall apart, will last for a long \n&gt;time to be passed on. What has cough my eye is the set that Tom Cruise wore \n&gt;during the movie The Last Samurai. Either Black or in Ox blood color. This \n&gt;Armour will be used on horse and in training. It needs to be good quality.\n&gt;\n&gt;Takara\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
