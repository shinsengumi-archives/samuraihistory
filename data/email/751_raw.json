I&#39;ve created a poll \nwith 12 possible reasons, that you can find here:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/polls\n\nGo vote in the poll, and post your opinions!  I myself think that he \nprobably didn&#39;t intend to at first, but as he gathered power, it sort \nof came as a natural result - fell into place.  Some people, like \nNapoleon, Hitler, and others (Robert Jordan would call them &quot;Ta&#39;veren&quot; \n- to throw in an obscure reference) somehow not only end up on paths \nto greatness (or great evil), but are spectacularly suited for the \njob, and rather than being pulled along with the flow of events, they \ncreate the flow.  I think Nobunaga falls into this category.\n\nWhat are some other views?\n\n\nc.\n\n\n"
