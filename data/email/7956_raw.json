(1968).\n\nSome new=\r\n prints of the samurai films that were struck to produce the \nDVDs have bee=\r\nn shown at film festivals in New York and Washington, \nD.C., and are schedu=\r\nled for Cambridge, Mass., (Nov. 4-10) and San \nFrancisco (Dec. 2-22).\n\nSeve=\r\nral also are being broadcast on the Independent Film Channel as \npart of it=\r\ns Samurai Saturdays series (Kill! airs Saturday at 8 a.m. \nET/5 a.m. PT). I=\r\nn March, IFC will air the Japanese-produced Samurai \n7 series, a sci-fi ani=\r\nm=E9 takeoff on Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Seven Samurai.\n\nA subset of the martial ar=\r\nts genre, samurai films have been made \nsince the early 1930s in Japan. The=\r\ny gained international status \nwhen renowned directors such as Kurosawa (Ra=\r\nshomon) explored the \ngenre.\n\nInterest in Japanese pop culture and easy acc=\r\ness to the films on DVD \nis driving the resurgence. \n\n&quot;It seems they&#39;re jus=\r\nt now, at the dawn of the 21st century, finally \nreceiving the mainstream a=\r\nppreciation in the U.S. that is their \ndue,&quot; says Patrick Galloway, author =\r\nof Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The \nSamurai Film Handbook.\n\n&quot;The popularity h=\r\nas always been there, and when (samurai films) have \nproperly been revived,=\r\n they have always done well,&quot; says Michael \nJeck, an expert on Japanese fil=\r\nms who coordinated the American Film \nInstitute&#39;s samurai cinema series, no=\r\nw in Silver Spring, Md. \n\nSeven Samurai remains a top-requested DVD in Crit=\r\nerion&#39;s 300-plus \nlibrary and sells steadily on Amazon.com. &quot;I have to thin=\r\nk that \n(Quentin Tarantino&#39;s) Kill Bill films spotlighted the genre for man=\r\ny \nof the uninitiated,&quot; says Amazon.com&#39;s DVD editor Doug Thomas. \n\nSwordpl=\r\nay is only part of the attraction of samurai films. &quot;What you \nhave in a sa=\r\nmurai battle is close-in, bladed warfare, the good guy \ngoing against the b=\r\nad guy face to face,&quot; Jeck says. &quot;You have \nkinetic energy, balletic grace =\r\nand brutal force, all conjoined.&quot;\n\nA foreign cousin of the American Western=\r\n, samurai films &quot;have struck \na chord with U.S. audiences,&quot; IFC&#39;s George Le=\r\nntz says. \n\nDirector John Sturges adapted Seven Samurai to make The Magnifi=\r\ncent \nSeven; Sergio Leone adopted Kurosawa&#39;s Yojimbo to create Clint \nEastw=\r\nood&#39;s &quot;The Man with No Name&quot; in three films; and George Lucas \nsays The Hid=\r\nden Fortress (1958) inspired Star Wars. \n\nMore recently, Tarantino has cite=\r\nd the movies starring the blind \nswordsman Zatoichi as an influence for his=\r\n Kill Bill films. And Tom \nCruise took up his sword in 2003&#39;s The Last Samu=\r\nrai.\n\nThese films owe a debt to the counterculture anti-heroes in \nCriterio=\r\nn&#39;s Rebel Samurai box set. &quot;They are asking themselves &#39;Is \nthere a time wh=\r\nen how I&#39;m supposed to act conflicts with what I know \nis right?&#39; It&#39;s not =\r\njust a guy with a sword,&quot; says co-producer Marc \nWalkow. &quot;Life and death ar=\r\ne at stake.&quot;\n\nA new class of filmmakers is carrying on the tradition:\n\n=95S=\r\nhinobi, a special-effects-infused samurai/ninja flick by director \nTen Shim=\r\noyama, is playing well in Japanese theaters.\n\n=95 Yoji Yamada, nominated by=\r\n the Japanese Film Academy as best \ndirector for The Hidden Blade (2004, du=\r\ne on DVD in January), begins \nwork on a new film, One-Line Samurai, early n=\r\next year.\n\n=95When the Last Sword Is Drawn, the winner of last year&#39;s Japan=\r\nese \nAcademy Award for best picture, arrives on DVD Dec. 27.\n\nThese directo=\r\nrs &quot;are revitalizing samurai cinema by making lyrical \nfilms divorced from =\r\nmythology, presenting the samurai as \nrealistically as possible,&quot; Galloway =\r\nsays. &quot;We&#39;re witnessing a new \nchapter in the genre.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
