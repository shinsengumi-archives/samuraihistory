I have\n&gt; read all of your osprey Samurai titles and intend to buy the\n&gt; historical game &quot;Sengoku&quot;.  The inspiration for purchasing your\n&gt; books was the film &quot;Kagemusha&quot; by Kurosawa (probably\n&gt; already know that).  Although I have read many historical fiction\n&gt; stories and watched a whole crapload of Samurai films,\n&gt; Kagemusha made me want to know exactly what happened.\n&gt; Your writing is clear, concise, and direct.  I deeply appreciate\n&gt; your contribution to my education and the western knowledge of\n&gt; Japanese history.\n\nThank you!\n\n&gt; Maybe Shadowhawke should take to reading\n&gt; some of your books to better educate himself with the lineage of\n&gt; the Shogun.  He&#39;s only off by a few hundred years and a few\n&gt; hundred Shogun.\n&gt; Now here&#39;s my spin on his question...  If you were playing\n&gt; Sengoku which daimyo would you play as?\n\nAh. Hmmmm...\n\nWell, I&#39;ve always been a great fan of Shingen, but politically rather than\nmilitarily. He was unable to whup Kenshin despite repeated attempts over the\nsame ground. In terms of military strategy and ruthlessness, I&#39;d go with\nHideyoshi.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
