I think nowaddays christians like ya\nare the same like the Adolf Hitler and that ol&#39; norwegian knew as Olaf, the\nMissionary King (who killed more than 4000 at his own country just because\nthey refused to be baptised on this new faith of &quot;love&quot;). (read Snorri\nSturlusson Olaf&#39;s Saga)\n\nDoes  ye call &quot;some few witchhunts&quot; as just something boring at all?\nIs it not an atrocity?\n\nThe total UNPROVOKED destruction of the Old Holy Upsala Temple of Ingve\nFreyr, lord and the TRUE patron of Sweden of Svi�j�d, like Amaterassu\nOmikami is for the entire Japan is NOT an atrocity?\n\nOf course! I remember! We non christians don&#39;t have a soul, then if we are\nbuddhists or shinto, or any other non christian religion, it is not a sin,\nnor an atrocity if somebody kill us...\n\nTokugawa Ieyassu avoided the total cultural and religious diversity\ndestruction of Japan, don&#39;t allowing this travesty.\n\nTokugawa gave total incentive to cultural development with the peace he\nachieved with his policies. And even much of the Kenjitsu styles enriched\nthemselves in an cultural way that was rarelly compared to other ages.\n\nCome on... mr danyael_x@...  we are people too...\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brasil\n\n\n\nMessage: 3\n   Date: Wed, 4 Jun 2003 19:37:01 +0200\n   From: &quot;Chris Danyael X&quot; &lt;danyael_x@...&gt;\nSubject: Autrocities in Seden by the Catholic Churc? Plz Explain... Was:\nTokugawa Evil? was:/Re: hey\n\nHi!\n\nI&#39;m a lurker of this mailing list; that means i read it but shut up\nsince I realize i really cant add anything to the discussions here.\nUntil now that is.\n\nNote: This is mainly written in an Ironic and sarcastic tone, and the\ndates ar approximately right, I may be off by +\n+/- 75 years or so. Never really botherd with dates.\n\nI just so happen to live in Sweden, the southern part of Sweden. History\nis my favourite hobby, and I really cant recall any autrocities done by\nthe catholic curch to us. In teh begining when some monks came to our\ncountry (were talking 600-800AD) we killed the anoying ones direktly,\nand left the harmless ones to to what ever they wanted, as long as they\ndidnt piss us off. Not untill the 1300AD I think (Not sure on exact\ndates, may be later may be sooner) A swedish king said I&#39;m gonna be\nbaptised, and everybody who has a porblem with it, chop! chop! One head\nshorter. I.E. your king is catholic, now the rest of sweden is catholic.\nThis held up for a time, and we had the usual witchhunts and stuff, but\nnoting to out of place in Europe during 1400-1600. Then a jolly good&#39;ol\nchap named Gustav Wasa, decided to change from catholic to protestant,\nand the chatolic got thrown out. tyhis was maily done outof economic\nreasons. The catholic curch is sinfully rich, but the protestants favour\npoverty, ie more taxes to the King. yay! If i remember correctly this is\nsome where during the begining of 1500. And since then we have had wars\nwith polen, Turkey, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Finland, And a few others\nthat just so happend to be on the way to Polen and Turkey. I have no\nrecoolection what so ever of autrocities of the scale of the spanish and\nportugal in South america, or the english men in China, or the french\nand Dutch in Africa. Who, in the name of the pop enslaved ppl for the\nsake of christianity.\n\nNope, we are friendly, peacefull people in Sweden, and as such we have\nbeen treated nicely by the Father.\n\n Well thats what I remember from my history lessons in my 12 year carer\nof grammar school, junior high and highschool.\n\nNow what was the autricities you were talking about?\nApart from the usual witchhunts and heretic slaying, of the dark ages?\n\n/// Chris D.
