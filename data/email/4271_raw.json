I mainly focused on Hayashizaki since he was enshrined for his \ncontributions to the swordsmanship world.  Everything exists, or has \nexisted, it is just a matter of being the one who gets the credit for it and \nHayashizaki was lucky enough to get the majority of the credit for \nbattou-jutsu.\n\n\nMr. Frison,\n\n  My appologies for applying the wrong gender to your name, I neglected to \nnotice that you are Italian.  I hope I did not offend you.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWatch LIVE baseball games on your computer with MLB.TV, included with MSN \nPremium! \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/mlb&pgmarket=en-us/go/onm00200439ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
