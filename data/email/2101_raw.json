OK then I have one more question: What is the \n&gt; Roshitai?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt; \n&gt; St. John Lord Merridewe\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;serizawakamo&quot; &lt;\n&gt; serizawakamo@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Shinchogumi is not Shinsengumi. Shinchogumi was also \n&gt; derived from the \n&gt; &gt; Roshitai, just like the Shinsengumi, but the Shinsengumi \n&gt; members \n&gt; &gt; stayed in Kyoto while the Shinchogumi ones retreated back to \n&gt; Edo.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe you have already got this book, but if not perhaps you \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; give a look at &quot;Samurai Sketches&quot;, by Romulus Hillsborough. It \n&gt; is a \n&gt; &gt; bit novelized, but still a very interesting depiction (and very \nwell \n&gt; &gt; researched) of some Shinsengumi members, including Isami \n&gt; Kondo and \n&gt; &gt; Kamo Serizawa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope that helped...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new. Hope I&#39;m in the right place to ask this. I&#39;m \n&gt; researching \n&gt; &gt; &gt; key figures of the Shinsengumi, particularly Isami Kondo and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kamo Serizawa. They were of course members of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shinsengumi, but I&#39;ve also run accross something called the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shinchogumi. It that the same thing? If not, what is it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any help much appreciated,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; St. John Lord Merridewe\n\n\n\n"
