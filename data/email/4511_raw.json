It was the title granted to the\n&gt;military dictator of the country, not a province, by\n&gt;the Emperor, ostensibly to rule in the Emperor&#39;s name.\n\nInterestingly the title Sei-i-tai-Shogun actually goes back even \nfurther than the Minamoto. For a while in the Heian period, it was the \ntitle - or rather a sort of temporary title - of people who were \nliterally assigned to quell the northeastern part of Japan. It was not \na life-long position and it was granted and rescinded a few times \nbefore the Kamakura &quot;shogunate&quot; as we think of it today.\n\nThe first was TaJiHi-no-AgataMori in 720. The most famous of these \nearly shogun was probably Saka-no-ue no Tamura Maro in 797.\n\nThere were other, similar military &quot;assignments&quot; that came with \ntemporary titles during this Heian period.\n\n&gt;questioned). Most sources will tell you that direct\n&gt;relation to the Minamoto family was required to be\n&gt;granted the title, but that&#39;s also been questioned. \n\nPersonally I don&#39;t believe that there was a specific &quot;rule&quot; that the \nshogun had to be from the Minamoto line, or Genji. It was more like \nan accepted practice. I talk a little about the relationship between \nthe Minamoto and the Taira families at the &quot;Family Tree&quot; section of my \nwebsite. \n\n&lt;snip very good stuff&gt;\n\n&gt;many provinces, or of part of a province. Governor is\n&gt;often the translation for the title &quot;kami&quot;, and in the\n&gt;Heian period did mean actual appointment as a\n&gt;governor, for the most part. In the 1500&#39;s, it was\n&gt;largely a name only title--you could be &quot;Bingo no\n&gt;kami&quot; (Governor of Bingo) without ever having set foot\n&gt;in the province of Bingo, and having nothing to do\n&gt;with the administration of it. \n\nTo take this a little further: These titles were relics from the \nritsuryo system which had died out several hundreds of years \nearlier. One of my pet projects right now is to study the ritsuryo \nsystem and to follow that through the centuries to try and figure \nout why these titles remained so important that they were kept for \nso long, without any connection to reality.\n\nFinally as you might already know, Bingo-no-kami was actually one of \nthe titles of Nobunaga&#39;s father, Nobuhide. :)\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
