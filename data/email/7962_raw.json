Even if I know this I need your help, and it is not the first time. Well, I am writing a sort of a biography about Takasugi Shinsaku and I am trying to put an end to this. But now I have a problem due to my poor japanese level. I found an exchange of poetries between Takasugi and Nomura Boto. The firts is a poetry wrote by Takasugi while he was lying sick in bed:\n \nomoshiroki koto mo naki yoni         yo=the first kanji of SEKAI-world\nomoshiroku\n \nto this Nomura answered:\n \nsuminasumo nowa\nkokoro narikeri\n \nand then, finally, Takasugi wrote:\n \nomoroinou\n \nI translated the first poetry with in a singular way, trying to underline Takasugi&#39;s spirit\n \neven in a world without matters\ndo something meaningful\n \n(well in italian it sounds a little better...)\n \nbut for the second and third poetry I am in big troubles. So I am looking for someone help to translate it in english...or in french, in italian... in particular the second one it is very important! The third one could also be eliminated from my text.\nI am beggin you all!!!!!!!!!!!!\nPlease ...\nthanks in advance!\nFrison Daniele\n \nps: this is the web link where I was able to find this poetry http://www.webkohbo.com/info3/takasugi/togyoan.html\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n Yahoo!
