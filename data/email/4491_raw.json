Duty was something others had to HIM. OTOH, he was very\nrespectful when dealing with the court.\n\n&gt; He killed several of his older relatives on his way to uniting his \n&gt; own kuni (Owari). He got rid of several long-time family vassals and \n&gt; is famous for his ability to pick and chose followers of ability. \n&gt; This implies that he did not use tradition or loyalty or duty to \n&gt; maintain his retainers.\n\nOn the contrary. He relied on it -- but it was duty and loyalty to HIM that\nmattered. Anyone who betrayed him, plotted against him, or threatened his\nposition was no longer to be trusted, and needed to be dealt with.\n\nRather pragmatic, really.\n\n&gt; This is not the sense of &quot;duty&quot; that is meant in Japan. Duty (in the \n&gt; honorable, admirable sense) is not to a cause, but to a person of \n&gt; autority, or one could say to a structure. Duty to one&#39;s own goal of \n&gt; unifying Japan is not in and of itself an admirable trait that would \n&gt; go down well in the annals of history.\n\nNot if one sees the unification as something that needs to be done, and one sees\noneself as the only one who can do it. It&#39;s the whole &quot;duty to a higher cause&quot;\nthing. Ambition can figure into it, but there&#39;s a duty to one&#39;s vision.\n\n\n&gt; I agree about the unfortunate temptation to compare with Hitler. \n&gt; It&#39;s quite banal. But I would also caution that Nobunaga did kill more \n&gt; than &quot;those who were in his way&quot;. He was ruthless and certainly \n&gt; over the top on more than one occasion.\n\nTrue. But it discouraged a lot more outbreaks. It&#39;s a rather bloody version of\nthe &quot;breaking eggs to make omelettes&quot; thing, with a little bit of &quot;pour\nencourager les autres&quot; as well. You wipe out a village or two now and five other\nvillages down the line will think twice about rising.\n\nIt&#39;s telling that the thing that did Nobunaga in was betrayal and treason rather\nthan an outside enemy. I don&#39;t think anyone but an insider COULD have gotten him.\n\n\n&gt; There are volumes and volumes written about this one incident. Noone \n&gt; will ever know just exactly what happened there. But the accepted \n&gt; story is indeed that Akechi Mitsuhide arranged for the attack. \n\n&quot;Arranged for&quot;? What the heck is that supposed to mean?\n\nMitsuhide *ran* the attack, he ordered it. He didn&#39;t contract for someone from\nNew Jersey or Koka.\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
