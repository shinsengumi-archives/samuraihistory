Al=\r\nso, between now and\nSeptember 15th, the entry fee is only $7 - it will go u=\r\np to $10 after\nthat.

The stories must involve Japan=\r\n or the Samurai,\nand the story may take place any time up to, but no later =\r\nthan the end\nof the 19th century, and may take place at any point in Japane=\r\nse\nhistory before this.\n\n \n\nRequirements:\n\nThis is to be a piece of fiction=\r\n writing taking place within an\nunspecified period in Japanese history up t=\r\no the late 19th century.\nThe available genres are listed below, or along th=\r\ne window on the left\nof this page - the stories must be written in the styl=\r\ne of one of the\ngenres on the listed.\n\nParameters:\n\nThe story is required t=\r\no be more than 1,000 words, with a 5,000 word\ntargeted limit - overages are=\r\n acceptable if necessary, but please\ndon&#39;t overdo it. It can be done in the=\r\n first person, or the third\nperson, and must be a complete short story, not=\r\n an excerpt from a\nlarger story. The genre(s) must be listed at the top of =\r\nthe story\nabove the title - one genre or a combination of two genres are\nac=\r\nceptable. Although the particular genre will not affect judging, all\nentran=\r\nts must make sure that their story follows the requirements of\ntheir chosen=\r\n genre(s) - see details below.\n\nSequels: Sequels to previous stories entere=\r\nd in the contest are\nacceptable - however, the story must be a stand-alone =\r\nshort story, not\na continuation of the previous story.\n\nEntrance Fee and Pr=\r\nize Details:\n\nThe entrance fee depends on when you sign up for the contest:=\r\n\n\nThe current fee is $7\n\nIf you sign up for the contest between September 1=\r\n6th and December\n31st, 2006, the fee will be $10.\n\nIf you sign up for the c=\r\nontest between January 1st and the deadline of\nMarch 31st, 2007, the fee wi=\r\nll be $15.\n\nSo it is to your advantage to sign up early.\n\nAdditionally, for=\r\n every five entries, the Samurai Archives will add\n$50 to the winnings.\n\nTh=\r\ne fee is payable via PAYPAL (www.paypal.com), payable to: webmaster\n@ samur=\r\nai-archives.com.
