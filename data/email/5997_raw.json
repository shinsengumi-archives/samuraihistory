In fact, I&#39;d say likely, once they\ndeveloped into an art and not simply a means of\nbreaking someone&#39;s arm, etc. \n\n \n&gt; ******* Beginner&#39;s mind, I think, is best.  It took\n&gt; a long time for me to learn just to do nothing. So\n&gt; simple, and soooooo much \n&gt; practice needed, lol.****** Yes, I slip up,\n&gt; especially when I get blind-sided by those &#39;hormonal\n&gt; surges&#39;. Don&#39;t like the taste of \n&gt; crow pie, either, when it turns out I am in error.\n&gt; ****\n\nIf someone asks a question here, most of the time they\nget an answer. The problem is when the asker doesn&#39;t\nget an answer that validates a viewpoint they already\nhave. Some people can take it and either accept it or\ndismiss it, based on other knowledge, and move on.\nOthers simply can&#39;t abide hearing that their sensei,\nor anime, or something they read online, or saw in a\nmovie, or even read in a book, may be wrong. Even so\ncalled &quot;experts&quot; can be wrong. \n\n\n&gt; ******** Improper grammar and poor spelling out of\n&gt; ignorance is trainable. Effective but improper\n&gt; grammar and poor spelling in the \n&gt; pursuit of fiction writing is an art.  Deliberate\n&gt; improper grammar and spelling to be hip, kewl, or\n&gt; defiant is lazy and is \n&gt; demonstrative (to me) of someone who is indeserving\n&gt; of my attention and intelligence.  I try to steer my\n&gt; path clear of that type and \n&gt; not waste my energy. I do have my own ways of being\n&gt; obstreperous.*****\n\n&quot;Kewl&quot;? lol. Something like that to be cute or funny\nis fine. talkin lik u r passin notes in ur study hall\nis annoying. I ask, yet again, that people stop it. \n\n&gt; *****Aye, that GPB is quite knowledgeable, and a\n&gt; hoot when he is having a good day.  I finally got my\n&gt; firweall settings to where \n&gt; more of the information on his site will display on\n&gt; my screen.\n\nSSHHHH! Don&#39;t tell him that. He&#39;s got a big enough\nhead as it is...lol. \n\n&gt; I understand you are in Tokyo.....   would I show my\n&gt; impertinent curiosity again to inquire as to how you\n&gt; got there (not \n&gt; transportation) , what you do, and how you find the\n&gt; daily life?   What do you like best?\n\nEmail me off list if you wish--I won&#39;t take up more\nbandwidth here. Suffice to say I live and work in\nTokyo for the time being, though I&#39;m moving to\nKanagawa soon. Daily life is great, and what is there\nNOT to like in Tokyo? (Except Roppongi. It&#39;s icky)\n\nNate\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo! Mail - You care about security. So do we. \nhttp://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail\n\n"
