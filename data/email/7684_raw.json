Actually I was looking for the reason why\nprize-fighting was\n&gt;  dishonor for samurai to engage in before the meiji\nrestoration. Can you \nhelp\n&gt;  me on this? How true is this?\n&gt;   \n&gt;  Thanks again.\n&gt;  \n\nThere is a film, quite good. It&#39;s called AFTER THE\nRAIN, which deals with \nthis subject. I forget the director but it&#39;s not\nreally a sword-slashing \n&quot;chambara film,&quot; it&#39;s a thoughtful film about what\nkenjutsu/kendo actually is. It&#39;s \navailable fairly widely with English subtitles. \n\nThe plot of AFTER THE RAIN basically involves a ronin\nand his wife who are \ntraveling as he is looking for work. It turns out that\nhe had made some income \nin the past by engaging in &quot;prize fighting&quot; also known\nas &quot;dojo crashing.&quot; \nThough you will see in watching the film that this\nronin had a different approach \nrather than the usual brash, outrageous sort of\napproach because this man is \nquite self-effacing. \n\nAt any rate, the local daimyo finds out about this man\nand offers him an \ninterview for an open position he has in his clan of\nbeing a kendo instructor for \nthe clan. The ronin comes for the interview and in the\nprocess, the daimyo \nfinds out that he had engaged in &quot;prize fighting&quot; in\nthe past and decides not to \ntake him into the clan. So yes, &quot;prize fighting&quot; was\nconsidered a dishonor. \nThe film goes on, and I&#39;ll let people watch it to find\nout what eventually \nhappens. \n\nI gather from this that &quot;prize fighting&quot; was\nconsidered a dishonor in the \nsame way that offering your sword services for hire\nwas considered a dishonor. \nThe samurai was supposed to offer his sword skills\nfreely, without consideration \nfor monetary gain, in service to his lord. That was\nthe ethic of the day. \n\nOf course this ethic didn&#39;t provide for any ronin who\nhad lost his lord or \nelse had been dismissed by his lord from his position\n-- how are they supposed \nto survive?  But then it was usually considered a\ndishonor to have become a \nronin, without a lord.  So there really weren&#39;t\nprovisions made for them in \nfeudal society,  particularly Tokugawa-era society.\nThe ronin just had to somehow \ncarry on the best as they could. So frequently,\ndespite the stigma, they were \nforced to offer up their sword skills for money or\nelse engage in &quot;prize \nfighting.&quot; \n\nDuring the Sengoku era, many samurai lost their lords.\nSome of them were able \nto get positions within other clans because there were\nmany battles and a \ngood swordsman, even one without a lord, would be\nwelcomed into a clan, where he \ncould acquire a new lord to serve as a samurai. With\nthe advent of the \nTokugawa period, there were far fewer opportunities,\nalmost none, to acquire a new \nposition with a new clan once a samurai had lost his\nlord.  \n\nHope this helps a bit.  Nina\n\n\nHI\n\nthe sworsmanship in the this movie was choreographed\nby Otake sensei the shihanke of the Katori Shinto Ryu\nwhich is famous for its swordsmanship\n\npaul\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
