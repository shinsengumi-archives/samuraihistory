His face is longer, his lips thinner, and his nose\nstraighter and more prominent than those of the lower class, and there\nis a difference in his manner and bearing. I have had a great deal of\ninteresting conversation with him.&quot;\nAlthough the class has gone, the author notes on a couple of occasions\nthis difference in bearing.\n\nThe other note is the stunning beauty of the countryside on the one\nhand, and the utter and abject squalor, poverty and misery of the\ngeneral rural population on the other. Full of interesting observation.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n"
