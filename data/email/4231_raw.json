Awful. Insulting.\n\n  Black Hawk Down was a great movie, as far as\n  depictions go. Much better than either of these two.\n  Of course, I am a huge fan of Saving Private Ryan, and\n  of course the Band of Brothers series. \n\n  How can you not like PATTON?? I mean, it&#39;s about GOD\n  himself??
