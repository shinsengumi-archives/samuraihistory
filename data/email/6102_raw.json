I guess I wo=\r\nrded \nit wrong, I was looking for something a little more illustrated in \nt=\r\nhe making process. Unfortunatly I am not able to read well. I have \na stron=\r\ng dyslexia that makes your instructions text look like \nEinsteins theory of=\r\n relitivity. I have made 3 sets of armor from \nbarrel plastic just from you=\r\nr patterns as well as others just by \nlooking at the pictures. I would just=\r\n like to make a more genuine \nlooking armor now. \n\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n--- In samur=\r\naihistory@yahoogroups.com, mark kd &lt;depos42300@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; to tony brya=\r\nnt,\n&gt;   lol\n&gt;    from,\n&gt;     mark(aka the guy that asked a similar ? to you=\r\n about 2 months \nago)\n&gt; \n&gt; Anthony Bryant &lt;ajbryant@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Michael =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have been searching the net for quite some time of Arm=\r\nor books \nto \n&gt; &gt; make armor.
