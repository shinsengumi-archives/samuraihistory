So in my opinion, he was the most \n&gt; important, although\n&gt; his death prevented HIM from being the one to complete the mission.\n&gt; Hideyoshi, the one to actually UNIFY Japan, had an heir (Hideyori, \n&gt; Nobunaga&#39;s\n&gt; grandnephew) but the people who succeeded him ultimately were too weak \n&gt; to be &quot;regents&quot;\n&gt; until that child came of age.  But his disarming of  the people helped\n&gt; solidify his hold on things.  (Was Hideyoshi the one to disarm the \n&gt; people?)  So\n&gt; unified Japan was in place when Tokugawa was name Shogun in 1603.  \n&gt; However, I\n&gt; don&#39;t think necessarily it was a case of Ieyasu being in the right \n&gt; place at the\n&gt; right time.  From what I&#39;ve read here on the list and elsewhere, it \n&gt; was a matter\n&gt; of time before Ieyasu challenged Hideyoshi and took command of things,\n&gt; especially after Sekigahara in 1600, which, to my mind, &quot;sealed the \n&gt; deal&quot; as it\n&gt; were.\n&gt;        This may all be conjecture so anyone else have anything to add \n&gt; or\n&gt; correct?\n&gt;        Take care, y&#39;all.  :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; L8r\n&gt; Tim\n\nAgreed.\nNobunaga was the man. Hideyoshi was a great general, but his \ncountry-bumpkin nature came out and he became a megalomaniac (=failure \nin Korea... or was it China??), Ieyasu was an intelligent man but had \nit &#39;relatively&#39; easy.\n\nOne thing about Nobunaga that people do not discuss much: a few years \nbefore being killed, he had adopted an Imperial Prince... who knows \nwhat he was planning...\n\ncepo\n\n\n"
