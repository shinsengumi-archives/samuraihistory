GOD BLESS all and\ngo vote\n\n\n\nPoor lad.  Who gave you the sublime misapprehension that this was a\ndemocracy?\n\n ...And it&#39;s a damned good thing too:  because with no offense to the lady\nin question, and as pleasant as I (for one) find her posts, scholarship does\nnot flourish in such a democracy.  Scholarship - which for our purposes here\nI&#39;ll define as the pursuit of genuine, accurate information - consists of\nuncompromising minds seeking uncaring facts, then double-checking them in a\nvariety of sources:  whereas &quot;democratic scholarship&quot; leads, almost\ninvariably, to consensus misinformation.\nI&#39;ve seen it happen on other lists - the facts that can be documented get\nlost in the ridiculous idea that everybody&#39;s opinion carries equal weight\nand validity, and soon the big mouths have half the readers convinced that\nthey know as much as the experts.\nThat helps no one - it frustrates the experts, it deceives the ignorant, it\nencourages the B.S.ers, and it degrades the transmission of historical\nfacts.  There&#39;s plenty of bad research out there on the web these days,\nproving my point far more decisively than I could wish.  (Look up a few\nsites on Celtic history, for instance, and you&#39;ll find more fantasy than\nfact by a factor of five to one or worse.)  As someone said here not long\nago - and I&#39;ve been quoting it merrily ever since - &quot;If you want\ninformation, this is a good place to get it.  If you want affirmation, get a\ngood therapist.&quot;\nOne of the great things about this site is that there are some genuine\nexperts here, who are not afraid to tell people when they&#39;re wrong.  Now\nwhen the folks don&#39;t take that well, or politely... then they get slammed.\nAnd deservedly so.  If you go to an expert for facts, then do nothing but\ntry and disprove or ignore those facts, _without being able to defend your\nviews as thoroughly as those experts you&#39;ve asked_, then from my point of\nview you&#39;ve asked for whatever you get.  You&#39;ve certainly earned no mercy at\nthat point.  If you disagree, then you&#39;d better be able to offer\ndocumentation to match the documentation of the experts.\nThat&#39;s straightforward enough, one should think.\n        Gereg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
