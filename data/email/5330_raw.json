There were no &quot;ranks&quot;, as such. Often\ntimes you&#39;ll see the same subordinates referred to as\ndifferent &quot;ranks&quot;. For instance, in one passage\nHideyoshi, Katsuie, and Nagahide may be referred to as\nthree of Nobunaga&#39;s &quot;Generals&quot;...later on you may see\nthem described as his &quot;lieutenants&quot; or &quot;captains&quot;.\nThese aren&#39;t meant to delineate rank, but more to show\na relationship--Nobunaga is the boss, and those three\nare his subordinate leaders. \n\nThe problem is that many times you see things\ntranslated into English that appear to be ranks, when\nthey are actually job titles. &quot;Taisho&quot;, often\ntranslated as general, isn&#39;t a rank--it&#39;s a job title.\nIt refers to someone who leads a large body of troops.\nThat could be 10,000 troops, or 300. Obviously if you\nlead 10,000 you are probably more important, and of\nhigher &quot;rank&quot; than the guy with only 300, but you&#39;re\nstill both &quot;Taisho&quot;. \n\nSimiliarly, you&#39;ll see things like &quot;Ashigaru-gashira&quot;,\netc., but again, these are job titles, not ranks. A\n&quot;Kashira&quot; is the head of a particular unit, so the\nashigaru-kashira would be the leader of a small unit\nof ashigaru, kind of like a platoon leader in the\nmodern army. \n\nBottom line, there were no sergeants, lieutenants,\ncaptains, majors, etc. But there were squad leaders,\nplatoon leaders, company commanders, battalion\ncommanders, etc. Of course, there was no standard\n&quot;battalion&quot; size like in a modern army, so if Lord A\nwas a minor lord who only had 200 ment to lead into\nbattle, you might call that a battalion...but you\nmight also call Lord B&#39;s 3,000 men a battalion...\n\nDifficult, no?\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nTake Yahoo!
