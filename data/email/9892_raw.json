For example, the role of the Meiji Restoration leaders seems\nanalogous t=\r\no the founding fathers of the US.  Toshimichi Okubo strikes\nme as a Thomas =\r\nJefferson type of character.  Saigo Takamori reminds me\nof George Washingto=\r\nn.\n\nThe analogies are not, of course, perfect.  But they are strong enough\n=\r\nto be interesting.  This evening I was comparing the Battle of\nSekigahara (=\r\nEast vs West) with the Battle of Gettysburg (North vs\nSouth).  These are th=\r\ne two key large domestic battles in both countries&#39;\nhistories.  I was surpr=\r\nised to learn how close the troop numbers were. \nAt Gettysburg, it was 93K =\r\n(north) vs 71K (south).  At Sekigahara, it was\n88K (east) vs 81K (west).  H=\r\now coincidental that such analogous battles\nhad troop numbers that were so =\r\ncomparable!\n\n\n\n"
