Black, the author writes about witnessing an execution sometime in the 1=\r\n860`s in the Tobe area of Yokohama. Also a journalist in Japan in 1880 wrot=\r\ne a story about the execution ground. You can see the story here: \n\nhttp://=\r\nquery.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=3DFB0B10FA3F551A7493C0A81782D85F448=\r\n784F9 \n\nI have been living in Yokohama for 4 years and was quite surprised =\r\nto hear about this bleak part of Yokohama`s past. I figure there must be so=\r\nme kind of memorial, shrine or, at least a sign marking the site - but, thu=\r\ns far, no luck at all in finding it. \n\nThanks. \n\n\n\n\n"
