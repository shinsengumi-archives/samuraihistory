Keeping that in mind the combination of hard \nedge steel and a softer spine along with differential heating \nproduces curvature in the Japanese sword. Actually it is the cooling \nthat does it, when the sword is heated in the fire the clay keeps the \nback of the sword relatively cool so it doesn&#39;t expand as much as the \nunprotected edge steel. The edge steel expands, the back does not and \nthis produces curve, the sword is then &quot;flash frozen&quot; in this state \nby dropping it in water. The smith gives his sword more or less curve \n(before yakiire) depending on the shape he wants (more or less sori) \nin the finished piece. He can adjust the curve in other ways after \nyakiire as well.\n\tThe combination of different steels and use of clay as \ninsulation may have been an experiment at some point that \nunexpectedly produced curve  in a straight blade, so at that early \nstage at least could be said to have been a happy accident...\n-t\nwww.ncjsc.org\n\n"
