I can&#39;t \n remember nor find Mitford&#39;s tales right now \n (they must be somewhere around here...) and I \n need to check what kind of prose he used in his\n retelling of the 47 Ronin story. Was it exotic? \n Folkloric? Did he try to get across the meaning \n to the anglophone audience in any special way?\n \n Any suggestion will do. You know, this has \n nothing to do with scholarly research. It&#39;s a \n silly bet I want to win in the next few hours. \n \n Thanks again. \n \n Saludos,\n diego d.\n\n\n"
