The wealthier member of the rural peasantry were called &#39;myoshu&#39; (literally &#39;head of a named rice paddy&#39;). When the myoshu moved on to acquire more fields they became &#39;daimyo&#39; (literally &#39;great name&#39;). Their duties included collecting dues for their lord, but by the late 11th Century, many were making the rural situation even more complicated by placing their land under the indirect supervision of a distant lord (eg; a Fujiwara noble or one of the larger Kenmon temples).  These myoshu/daimyo were the foundations of the latter jizamurai/ kokujin (basically the lower echelons of the military class). \nM.Lorimer\n\nrjuri &lt;rjuri@...&gt; wrote:\nGreetings:\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zevlord&quot; &lt;LordZev@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Was just wondering if this is correct. A daimyo ruled over a \nprovince\n&gt; and reported to the shogun, the military leader in Japan during the \n&gt; Edo period. During the Meiji restauration, the institution of the \n&gt; daimyo was abolished and the provinces were replaced by \nprefectures. \n&gt; While The shogun was the highest Japanese military ruler during the \n&gt; Kamakura and Edo period. Although the emperor was officially the \nhead \n&gt; of the state, the shogun rulers had the actual power until the end \nof \n&gt; the Edo period\n\nI would say that a daimyo ruled over a &quot;daimyo land&quot;, that could be a \nprovince, several provinces, part of a province, part of several \nprovinces.\nAnd to the extend of my very small knowledge, I believe that there \nwere no Daimyos in the kamakura period. There were Shugos at that \ntime. Am I wrong?\nIndeed I think that the Daimyo is a title that born to be used by \nfully independent lords during the sengoku jidai, although I am clear \nthat in the Edo period they served like some kind of governors, but \nmore like princes, counts and duches in the european countries.\nRepeat, that is as long a I know, forgive me if I said something \nwrong.\n\nRodrigo Juri A.\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
