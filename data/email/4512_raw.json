For a while in the Heian\n&gt; period, it was the \n&gt; title - or rather a sort of temporary title - of\n&gt; people who were \n&gt; literally assigned to quell the northeastern part of\n&gt; Japan. It was not \n&gt; a life-long position and it was granted and\n&gt; rescinded a few times \n&gt; before the Kamakura &quot;shogunate&quot; as we think of it\n&gt; today.\n\nYeah, I know, but I was going with the &quot;simple answer\nis better&quot; theory for the moment. To explain it in its\nentirety in order to disavow the notion that it was a\nprovincial lord seemed like it might be a bit much. \n\n&gt; Personally I don&#39;t believe that there was a specific\n&gt; &quot;rule&quot; that the \n&gt; shogun had to be from the Minamoto line, or Genji.\n&gt; It was more like \n&gt; an accepted practice. I talk a little about the\n&gt; relationship between \n&gt; the Minamoto and the Taira families at the &quot;Family\n&gt; Tree&quot; section of my \n&gt; website. \n\nAgree--especially since there is evidence in letters\nthat some court nobles extended an offer to Nobunaga\nto secure the position for him. Being as he claimed\nTaira descent and not Minamoto, that would seem to put\nthe nix on that.\n\n\n&gt; Finally as you might already know, Bingo-no-kami was\n&gt; actually one of \n&gt; the titles of Nobunaga&#39;s father, Nobuhide. :)\n\nI did NOT know that...interesting.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
