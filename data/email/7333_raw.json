Since his passing in 1998, the Criterion Collection has \ndone a superb job reissuing some of his most cherished works \nincluding those mentioned above, as well as Red Beard, Throne of \nBlood, Stray Dog, Sanjuro, Yojimbo and High and Low. Most recently \nthe Criterion Collection has released a double disc version of \nKurosawa&#39;s 1980 film Kagemusha. \n\nAlthough the film was plagued with delays during production, it \nstill remains as one of Kurosawa&#39;s most poignant works and is given \nan overdue, brilliant treatment on this reissue. \n\nIn 1968, Kurosawa collaborated with Japanese directors Masaki \nKobayashi, Kon Ichikawa and Keisuke Kinoshita to form the Yonki-no-\nkai company. The company&#39;s only film, Dodes&#39;ka-Den, released in 1970 \nwas a commercial failure. This event, in conjunction with his \ndecision to leave the set of the disastrous Tora! Tora! Tora!, sent \nKurosawa into a deep depression. His depression culminated in an \nattempted suicide in December of 1971. \n\nHowever, three years later Mosfilm (the Soviet national film \nproduction bureau) commissioned Kurosawa to make Dersu Uzala, which \nwent on to win the 1976 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. \n\nRegardless, Kurosawa still lacked the funding for he needed to make \nKagemusha due to the failure of Dodes&#39;ka-Den.\n\nTo relieve the frustration of this situation, Kurosawa began \npainting furiously again. As a young man, Kurosawa had originally \nbeen a painter within the Japan Proletariat Artists Group.\n\nContemporary German Expressionism, Soviet Realism and French Avant-\nGarde influenced his work as a painter. His paintings and \nstoryboards (some of which are featured in the 48-page booklet \npackaged with Kagemusha) have characteristic calligraphic lines and \nbold primary colors. Kurosawa cites political pressure against \nartists and liberal writers, needing to find a dependable livelihood \nand the suicide of his brother as the three factors that made him \nswitch from painting to film.\n\nKurosawa learned film under Yamamoto Kajiro, a relationship he \ndescribes more like that of an elder and younger brother rather than \nan apprenticeship. \n\nIt was based on these brilliant storyboards for Kagemusha that \nFrancis Ford Coppola and George Lucas (huge admirers of Kurosawa&#39;s \nwork) approached Kurosawa about helping him fund the project. \n\nEssentially the funding for Kagemusha was garnered from the success \nof Lucas&#39; first Star Wars film, as well as Coppola&#39;s first two \nGodfather installments and Apocalypse Now. \n\nProduction for Kagemusha began in 1979 and was plagued by an \nargument Kurosawa had with lead actor Katsu Shintaro who demanded \nthat his own personal camera crew be allowed on the set to keep a \nvideo record of his work. Nakadai Tatsuya replaced Shintaro and \nKagemusha was ready to be transformed from static paintings into \nliving, breathing film.\n\nKurosawa describes Kagemusha as a medieval samurai drama loosely \nbased on ideas in Shakespeare&#39;s King Lear. Kurosawa had already \nsuccessfully translated Macbeth in his Throne of Blood film and \nHamlet in The Bad Sleep Well. He would later more fully adapt King \nLear in his 1985 film Ran. \n\nKurosawa made Kagemusha about the historical character of Shingen \nTakeda that would have to display different faces in different \nsituations. \n\nHistorically, Shingen was known to use many kagemusha, or doubles, \nso that he could avoid surprise attacks. In the film, Shingen uses \nhis brother Nobukado as a double, as well as a ruffian from the \nstreets who looks uncannily like him. (Skip to next paragraph to \navoid SPOILERS). \n\nAfter Shingen dies, his brother refuses to continue impersonating \nhim. Having been so affected by Shingen as a person, the thief \nagrees to continue impersonating him in order to keep the Takeda \nclan alive. \n\nHowever, the family of Shingen begins to notice that the thief is \nnot truly their warlord and expel him from the clan. Later in time, \nthe thief is forced to watch the Takeda clan fall to Nobunaga and \nhis Tokugawa clan as they ignore the advice of Shingen and \nstrategist Sun Zi: &quot;Swift as the wind, as silent as the forest, as \nsweeping as fire, as immovable as the mountain.&quot; Kurosawa sees this \nas historically fascinating because Japan would have been a much \ndifferent place had Shingen and the Takeda clan gained control of \nKyoto. \n\nKurosawa&#39;s writing process always involved two or three partners, \nbut he &quot;always left the translation of prose scenes into images to \nhimself.&quot; Since Kurosawa began losing his eyesight around this time, \nhis use of illustrated storyboards greatly aided him in \ncommunicating how he wanted Kagemusha to look. \n\nPerhaps his most visually stunning film, Kagemusha uses brilliantly \ncolored fabrics of blood reds and fiery yellows. In a dream \nsequence, Kurosawa&#39;s use of black lights, Day-Glo paints, surreal \nterrain, otherworldly backdrops and eerie reflections makes for one \nof the most visually stunning scenes in film history.\n\nIn a Tony Rayns interview with Kurosawa, the director shares how he \nfeels about young directors in the Japanese film industry. \n\nHe explains that although these young &quot;indie&quot; directors are limited \nby budget, they try to make their films abrasive to attract an \naudience. \n\nHowever, Kurosawa believes that a director should always make a film \nto attract as large an audience as possible, while sacrificing none \nof his or her artistic vision. \n\nIt is in this way that Kagemusha succeeds so well. It is an \naccessible film with an engaging story based on true history and \nbeautiful cinematography to boot. Kagemusha went on to win the Palm \nD&#39;Or at Cannes in 1980.\n\nDisc one of the Criterion Collection re-release of Kagemusha \nincludes a new, restored high-definition digital transfer, audio \ncommentary, theatrical trailers and improved English subtitle \ntranslation. \n\nDisc two is a fascinating collection of documentaries including a \ndiscussion between Lucas, Coppola and Kurosawa, a making of \nKagemusha, a storyboard to film comparison, a collection of Suntory \nWhiskey commercials and a gallery of storyboards painted by \nKurosawa. \n\n\nhttp://www.thetriangle.org/media/paper689/news/2005/07/22/Entertainme\nnt/Kagemusha.Is.A.Visual.Splendor-963856.shtml\n\n\n\n"
