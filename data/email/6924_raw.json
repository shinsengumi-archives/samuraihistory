You&#39;ll find there that in reality ninja were actually samurai. If you take into consideration that the only class allowed to engage in warfare were the samurai class . There is no such thing a ninja straight sword its Hollywood bunk. The sword a ninja carried was in fact curved because it was a samurai sword carried by a samurai during covert operations.\nLater,\nRod\nPatrick Vetrano &lt;ninja_20049@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\nhello rod,\n\nTo answer your question, yes in one way it could have been because of the shape, or simply because the samurai were destand to master at what ever their job in battle was. and i dont know if that being stealth was the ninjas only advantage to winning a battle, like i said, IM NO EXPERT but i plan to talk to some and learn from some. and also maybe its that the ninja didnt belive in many things the samurai did, like its glorious to die in battle. i dont think the ninja thought that, but i have no room to talk bad about the ninja because im training in akido where we are learning about the ninja and how to fight like one.\n\n            \n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nMake Yahoo! your home page   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
