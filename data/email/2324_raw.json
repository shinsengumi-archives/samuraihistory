He recieved the title of\nCh�nagon in 1594 and acted as overall commander &#39;on the ground&#39; in\nthe 2nd Korean Campaign. He served as one of the five regents (San-\ntairo) following Hideyoshi&#39;s death in 1598 and from Okayama Castle\nruled over Bizen, Mimasaka, and part of Bitch� (yielding an income\nof around 575,000 koku). He sided with Ishida Mitsunari in 1600 and\ncommanded 17,000 troops at the Battle of Sekigahara (the largest\nloyal - and active - &#39;western&#39; contingent present). The Ukita troops\nfought very well in the battle but were overwelmed when attacked by\nthe turncoat Kobayakawa Hideaki. Following the general defeat of\nMitsunari&#39;s army, Hidie went into hiding, seeking refuge with the\nShimazu. In 1603 he was revealed by Shimazu Iehisa and Tokugawa\nIeyasu at first ordered his execution. That sentence was reduced to\nexile, and Hideie died at the age of 90 on Hachij� Island - possibly\nthe last of the Toyotomi-era daimy� to die.\n\nUkita Hideie&#39;s mother was Housenni (Died 12/11/1594) - She was\noriginally the wife of Miura Sadamune. When Sadamune died in 1565,\nshe became the wife of Naoie.\nHideie&#39;s wife was the fourth daughter of Maeda Toshiie and Matsu.\n\nFather -\nUkita Naoie 1529 - 1581 AKA Hachirou\n\nMother -\nHousenni Died: 11 Dec 1594\n\n1st Cousin -\nUkita Motoie\n\nGrandfather -\nUkita Okiie Died: 1536\n\nG Grandfather -\nUkita Yoshiie Died: 1534\n\nGG Grandfather -\nUkita Mikawa no Kami Hisaie\n\nGGG Grandfather -\nUkita Muneie\n\nUncle -\nUkita Haruie\nUkita Tadaie\n\nSon -\nUkita Hidetaka\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Brand&quot; &lt;pitibrand@i...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am currently looking for info about Ukita Hideie relatives. I\nbelieve he\n&gt; is the husband of Maeda Go and was adopted by Hideyoshi. Does\nsomebody knows\n&gt; when he was adopted and have any info about his mother?\n&gt;\n&gt; Brand.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n_____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Envie de discuter en &quot;live&quot; avec vos amis ?
