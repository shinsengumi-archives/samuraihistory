I don&#39;t know about this subject, so I would\n&gt; &gt; like to see your point of view, especially since you are in the\n&gt; &gt; marine, if I remember correctly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cogs and caravelles were no longer being used, I believe, by the mid 16th\n&gt; century. The Iberian ships traveling around Asia were typically \n&gt; referred to as\n&gt; galleons, although in the 1540s they were probably fairly early types \n&gt; with some\n&gt; caravelle features still in place.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt; caravelles Were just being replaced out as you say tony, but \n&gt; portuguese trade post in africa were still actively using them due to \n&gt; the adapted sail (which i think was arabic in origin) which allowed \n&gt; the ship to sail headlong. Galleons became the norm ,and it bacame a \n&gt; kind of arms race in europe to see whom could build the largest and \n&gt; most decorative. Id imagine the sight of these highly decorated and \n&gt; large craft to indiginous peoples would be a sign of strength as well \n&gt; as a practical use. But as you say there maybe be a combination of \n&gt; both galleon and caravelles so it would be intresting to look at the \n&gt; early galleons to see if they retain any features of the caravelle. \n&gt; james willis aka not james wilson lol lizzie\n&gt; -- \n&gt;\nOf course, IIRC, the first Portuguese to step on Japanese soil arrived \non (or from the wreck) of a Chineese Junk. ;-)\n\nDan Cooper\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
