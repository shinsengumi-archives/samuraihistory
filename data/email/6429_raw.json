Kinda weird, kinda wild... Why don&#39;t we \nstep back from the dryads, gnomes and elves, and get back into \nJapanese history for a little while?  Since we are still in the \nholiday season, I don&#39;t feel like playing Forum Nazi, and my Gestapo \nappears to be on vacation anyway, so let&#39;s just do this all amicable \nlike, and sashay our way back to the guys with helmets and swords \nthat we so know and love.\n\n-Kitsuno, AKA The One Who Owns The Medium\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Silk Road School&quot; \n&lt;silk.road.school@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I recently got myself a pu-dao (a Chinese naginata, \napproximately -\n&gt; maybe a nagamaki).  This is a mass-produced piece, although it&#39;s \nnicely\n&gt; balanced and (at the risk of provoking a duel) it does cut well.  \nAfter the\n&gt; discussion that&#39;s gone one here on the subject of spirits \nperceived in\n&gt; blades (or not), I was paying especial attention to any feelings I \ngot from\n&gt; the blade.\n&gt; \tIn fact, I perceived very little.  More like a spark ready \nto be fanned\n&gt; into flame than anything that felt like a genuine &#39;presence&#39;.  (We \npicked up\n&gt; a new kitten the same day:  now there [by way of contrast] is a \nthoroughly\n&gt; genuine little presence.)  The pu-dao feels very much the way a\n&gt; decently-made new weapon usually feels, only hitherto I haven&#39;t \nbeen\n&gt; analyzing the sensations so narrowly.  The exceptions to this \ntendency, in\n&gt; my experience, have been hand-forged blades, of which several have \nseemed to\n&gt; me already to be &#39;present.&#39;\n&gt; \tNow I have to verge into theology here, and observe that I \ndon&#39;t believe\n&gt; humans have the power to create the kind of presence that I \nperceive in\n&gt; these weapons - those weapons, new or well-used, that carry a \nsense of\n&gt; character about them.  But I do believe that everything in the \nuniverse\n&gt; carries a certain amount of inherent spirit in it, which is not \nunreasonable\n&gt; if one regards everything as the product of an ultimate spirit. \n(If that\n&gt; term is vague, it&#39;s also as neutral as I can make it.)  This is a \nbelief\n&gt; that is not out of tune with my understanding of the development \nof Shinto,\n&gt; a collection of beliefs that bears a considerable resemblance to \nEuropean\n&gt; and Amerindian nature religions.  The very term &#39;Shinto&#39; is loosely\n&gt; translated as Way of the Spirits:  a reading of the characters for \nmichi\n&gt; (Way) and kami (which can mean everything from humans, to what the \nclassical\n&gt; Greeks would have regarded as dryads and naiads, to mountains, \ngods, and\n&gt; fundamental universal principles).   (While humans are not properly\n&gt; described as kami, technically we do qualify, along with anything \npossessing\n&gt; a spirit.  To the followers of Shinto, and within my faith as \nwell, this\n&gt; includes quite a few things that modern culture regards as \ninanimate.\n&gt; \tSo my current thinking on this subject is that the kind of \nfocus, will and\n&gt; labour involved in hand-crafting a thing, or the loving use of a \nthing, can\n&gt; awaken the spirit inherent in it, and (in some manner that I don&#39;t \nbegin to\n&gt; comprehend) can augment its development of &#39;presence,&#39; or \nindividual\n&gt; character.  I do not expect to persuade anyone to adopt this view, \nbut for\n&gt; those who have experienced something similar, it may provide some \nfresh\n&gt; insight.  And for those interested in the beliefs of the samurai, \nit may\n&gt; offer some insight into just how those beliefs might have \ndeveloped in the\n&gt; first place.  For - as I&#39;ve said before - I&#39;ve never known a \nserious sworder\n&gt; who did not share my sense of a good sword carrying a spirit that \neludes\n&gt; either easy description or easy dismissal.  It&#39;s simply easier to \nfit the\n&gt; idea into some views of reality than others.\n&gt; \tGereg\n\n\n\n\n"
