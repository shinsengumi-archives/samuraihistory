It helps unbelievably to be\nspecific in what your question is. I was mildly\nannoyed that you said you&#39;d looked and couldn&#39;t find\nanything, when a simple Google search came up with a\nton of sites (admittedly, mostly scanty info like\nWikipedia, but still). However, if you&#39;re looking for\na specific fire at a specific date, that changes\nthings quite a bit. \n\nGood luck, not sure I&#39;ve got anything that can help\nyou with your specific question. \n\n\n\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Nate:\n&gt;   First of all let me thank you for your answer but\n&gt; I think I should have been more specific about my\n&gt; question regarding the fires of the Yoshiwara. Yes I\n&gt; am aware of the great fire of 1657 I have found\n&gt; information on that part of the history but there\n&gt; were also fires during the late nineteenth century\n&gt; one of them I believe occured in the year 1861. You\n&gt; see it has much harder finding that sort of\n&gt; information but if you Nate or anyone else has or\n&gt; knows of where I can find that information I would\n&gt; be most grateful.\n&gt;   Rod\n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Rod Pavez &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello everyone:\n&gt; &gt; Not long ago I posted a question about the fires\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; the Yoshiwara or \n&gt; &gt; pleasure quarter of the city of Tokyo. I really\n&gt; &gt; wanted to know if \n&gt; &gt; someone has information regarding the historical\n&gt; &gt; timeline of those \n&gt; &gt; fires. If anyone does please I&#39;d really like to\n&gt; &gt; know. I&#39;ve searched and \n&gt; &gt; searched but to no avail. Thank you all.\n&gt; &gt; Rod\n&gt; \n&gt; The Edo Taika (Great Fire of Edo) took place in\n&gt; 1657,\n&gt; and gutted the Yoshiwara.
