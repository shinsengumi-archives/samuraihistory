These weapons are not proven &#39;Ninja&#39; tools, indeed why would \nany spy wish to advertise his position as obviously as wearing a straight and \nshorter blade? Their use by ninja is probably as real as their &quot;as used by \nHattori Hanzo&quot; stickers and labels.\n Sensei Hatsumi says in his book that the Ninja families had made their own \nblades due to the costs of getting Katana, and this is believable at \nleast..These swords may have been shorter, or had larger, square, Tsuba \n(guards) but the Katana/Tachi shape of sword has been proven to be far more \neffective than a straight bladed weapon in the way the Katana was used and \nthe Ninja families would probably have kept the basic shape similar.\n Sensei Tanemura&#39;s book &quot;Ninpo secrets&quot; has an photograph of what he calls a \n&#39;Ninja-to&quot; but it is a curved sword, similar to a Wakizashi in length and \nwith concealed pockets on the Saya for &#39;metsubishi&#39; powders or to brath \nthrough underwater.\n As I said, none of this can be proven but check around and generally I think \nmost people see the Ninja-to as a bit of joke. (ala Teenage mutant ninja \nTurtles et al..)\n The debate continues......\n\n"
