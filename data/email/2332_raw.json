Almost all of\n20,000(?) soldiers were killed. \n\nSo, the composition of tactical units does play a role\nin the battle. But, it is still a commander who\ndetermines the fotunes of the battle.\n\n\n\n                        Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Changsub Lee\n\n--- James Eckman &lt;ronin_engineer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   From: Lee Changsub &lt;knorr31@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: The Use of Hand Guns by Samurai\n&gt; Officers in the Senkogu Jidai??\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;However, Machurians who conqured Myung Dynasty used\n&gt; &gt;archery against the firearms of China and proved\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;their archery was superior weaponary than the use\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;firearms. This is one of reasons why the last\n&gt; Chinese\n&gt; &gt;empire(Manchurian&#39;s) did not show much interest in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;western weaponary.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; In the west, I seem to remember that Benjamin\n&gt; Franklin advocated a \n&gt; return to the long bow as late as 1776. It&#39;s easier\n&gt; to train a \n&gt; musketeer, but if you already have trained archers,\n&gt; why bother?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
