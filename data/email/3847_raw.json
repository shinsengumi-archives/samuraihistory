Could the Shogun be directed \nmore or less against the samurai as they are the formal head of \ngoverment?\n\nI think we could relate this situation to modern day politics.  The \nShogun held all of Japan&#39;s power (the Emperor had some minor powers \nthat were dictated by the Shogun), somewhat similar to the U.S. \nPresident.  We could compare Samurai to politicians (unfair \ncomparison, I know) vying for the position of power.  Some \npolitician, let&#39;s say he/she&#39;s a Senator, could have an interesting \nposition.  In most situations, it is best for the Senator to be \naligned with and endorsed by the current president.  To be recognized \nby a person of such power and authority is good for the political \nfuture of the Senator.  If that same Senator were to run for office \nagainst the current president, they would be rivals.  The Senator \nwould then attempt to seperate him/herself from the current \npresident.\n\nIt would be in a samurai&#39;s benefit to be aligned with the Shogun.  \nBut if that samurai wanted to be Shogun (and I&#39;m sure almost all of \nthem had that aspiration) then they would be rivals.  I think this \nwould be on an individual or perhaps sect basis but not the entire \nclass of Samurai againt the Shogun.  The Shogun was the top dog in \nthe Samurai class.  For this reason I&#39;m sure there was jealousy and \nhatred but he still belonged to that class.  At some point, a Shogun \nrealized how dangerous it was to be Shogun.  To reduce rivalry, the \npractice of housing &quot;family guests&quot; (i.e. hostages) in the immediate \nhouse of the Shogun was common.\n\nBrandon\n\nP.S. I&#39;m not an expert on the Meiji period but wasn&#39;t that when the \nSamurai class was abolished.  The Shogun was overthrown first so \nthere would be no Shogun to disagree with.  The Emperor had the \ndisagreement with the Samurai and the Shogun, probably because his \noffice, although diefied, held no power for almost 1000 years.  Here, \nthe direct descendant of the Sun God saw an opportunity, with \ntechnology and the weakness of the current Shogun; to take power back \nand once again rule Japan.  According to &quot;Japanese History, 11 \nexperts reflect on the past&quot; a kodansha book, &quot;The period commenced \nwith the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate... &quot;\n\n\n"
