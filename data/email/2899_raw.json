I have never seen that b4, thank you for that little bit of info.. according to the articles and such that I have read, that is how it was done.. Ive often wondered about it bcos in order to stamp the blade like that, youd hafta heat it up again, which could possibly mess up the temper.. perhaps the smith is the one who places the gold into the tang?? unfortunately I dont know now where I read that, but I have read it in more than one place, if I come across it again I&#39;ll let you know..\nWilson\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Tue, 16 Dec 2003 06:00:18\nFrom: &quot;Matthew E.

I thought that the swords were sent\nto selected individuals after hey had been forged and polished who then\ntested them and inlaid a gold inscription on the tang saying how many\nbodies were cut with the sword. As far as I know the smith had nothing\nto do with that entire process ?\n\n- Matt \n\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: Josh Wilson [mailto:lordwilson@...] \nVerzonden: dinsdag 16 december 2003 3:29\nAan: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwerp: Re: [samuraihistory] Hi\n\n\nYes, after being forged, the blades would then be tested on the corpses\nof criminals. After that, it would be returned to the maker to be\nstamped how well it held up, but it was mroe for a durability test than\na sharpness test, as any sharp blade could cut, but not every blade\nwould stay intact. Some may crack or even break entirely if the\ncraftsmanship was flawed.\n\nWilson\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Mon, 15 Dec 2003 12:13:27\nFrom: Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nActually the blades use to have a symbol for how many\nbodies it could slice through which determined how\nsharp it was.\n\n--- Josh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well AJ, I reckon its my turn *smacks his head on\n&gt; the desk* How sharp is any blade??
