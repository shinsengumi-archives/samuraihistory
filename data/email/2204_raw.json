I mean as \na work of \n&gt; historical FICTION (you know, based on history but mostly made \nup).  Not \n&gt; that I won&#39;t be bugged by all the little things too.  I know I&#39;ll \nbe sitting \n&gt; in the theater shaking my head muttering under my breath &quot;no, no, \nOH \n&gt; gimmeabreak! that could NEVER happen, where did they get this \ninformation?&quot;  \n&gt; Most movies have been like that for me since I became somewhat \nobsessed with \n&gt; Micheal Crichton books :)  Anyways, ya&#39;ll keep saying how you&#39;ll \nhate it but \n&gt; still see it.  It will hurt.  It won&#39;t kill me. I&#39;ll still go.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai?

Horribly Wrong.\n&gt; &gt;And that&#39;s on top of how I feel about Tom Cruise in\n&gt; &gt;general. It will be the pain of Shogun (the\n&gt; &gt;translations, the Edo-jidai uniform kimono, the\n&gt; &gt;silliness of the whole love story) on a much grander\n&gt; &gt;scale. It will hurt. It will kill me. And I will go.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Nate\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- &quot;Anthony J.

But what do you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guys think of it? Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you think it has the potential to be up there with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shogun and The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crapfest to make money\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I look at going to it much as I do going to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dentist. I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t like it. I know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;ll hurt.
