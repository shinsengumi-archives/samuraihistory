Your \nresponse went a great distance in clearing up some date and \nrelationship conflicts I had in my notes. \n\n&gt; This is some of what I have, let me know if you want me to clarify \n&gt; anything, or if you have other questions\n\nIf I may, just a couple/3:\n\nFirst, what is the &#39;Sengoku Jinmei Jiten&#39;--from the context, it&#39;s a \nhistorical record, but to be able note a bit more detail about it \nwould be very helpful (year written, ect.).\n\nSecond, you noted that Obata Nobusada was the son of O. Shigesada--\nonce source I have listed &quot;O. Norishige&quot; as Nobusada&#39;s father. \nAre &quot;Shigesada&quot; and &quot;Norishige&quot; the same person? Also, are there any \ndates (b/d) for him? (BTW, I noted I erroneously wrote &quot;Nobushige&quot; in \nmy earlier post--sumimasen!). \n\nThird, and last, are the Toramori et.al. and Shigesada/Nobusada lines \nrelated at all? If so, how?\n\nThanks again for the past assist, and in advance for any further \ninsights! This is very helpful!\n   Marlene Harris\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"
