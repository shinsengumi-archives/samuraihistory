I am attempting to find out some histories or\n&gt; records of=\r\n the events.  I would particularly like to know some of \nthe\n&gt; prominent fa=\r\nmilies/personas of the Tokugawa period alive in the \nearly\n&gt; 1600&#39;s.  \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I have the following list\n&gt; \n&gt; Iyeysu Tokugawa\n&gt; Mori Terumoto\n&gt; Uyesugi\n&gt;=\r\n Date Masamune\n&gt; Yamnanouchi\n&gt; Ukita\n&gt; Satake\n&gt; \n&gt; I need 2 more and/or com=\r\nments on the families listed.  I already \nhave\n&gt; hit the Samurai Archives f=\r\nor family history.  More help and \ndirection\n&gt; would be, well....helpful.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Wade Ness\n&gt; Social Studies\n&gt; Oak Ridge High School\n&gt;\n=\r\nThere is just one fundamental problem with all of this, although your \nidea=\r\n sounds like a lot of fun. Ieyasu did not close-off Japan. It was \nhis gran=\r\ndson, the third Tokugawa Shogun, Iemitsu, who ultimately \nclosed Japan to a=\r\nll but the Dutch, Chinese and Koreans.\n\nThere are numerous books that touch=\r\n upon this subject. I would \nrecommend one of the general survey-type histo=\r\nry books that George \nSansom wrote on Japan for starters. Volume 3 of his t=\r\nrilogy should do \nthe trick.\n\n\n"
