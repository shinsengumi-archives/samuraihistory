It is part of the &#39;criterion collection&#39;, and they \ndid such a good job with 7 samurai, I already have my order in for \nRashomon. (as opposed to the DVD &#39;Ran&#39;, which was an utter \nabomination)  Rashomon will be released on 3-26 - you can check it out \nat dvdplanet.com.  You&#39;ll have to do a search to find it - it doesn&#39;t \nput the location of the page in my browser&#39;s address bar to post here.\n\nLooks like it will have Japanese/subtitled or a dubb track. Never seen \nit dubbed.  I assume it will be horrible, but interesting to watch at \nleast once.\n\n\n"
