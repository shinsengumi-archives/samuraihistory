My dad also spent time visiting \n&gt; Kummamoto while he was stationed there back in 1947-1951.  \n&gt; I look forward to hearing from Kitsuno-san.\n&gt; Take care,\n&gt; Yoshio\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Kodama-san,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Welcome from another Army guy--I&#39;m stationed in Tokyo\n&gt; &gt; for the moment. Glad to have you aboard. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as helping with your family tree, I know\n&gt; &gt; Kitsuno, the owner of the list, has done some\n&gt; &gt; extensive genealogical work, but mainly with the more\n&gt; &gt; famous families (Oda, etc.). He does have some\n&gt; &gt; resources that may benefit you though. He&#39;s been gone\n&gt; &gt; recently, but maybe he&#39;ll poke his head out and say\n&gt; &gt; something...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Eric &lt;smilingotter_7@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;      I just wanted to take some time to introduce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; comment on how neat it is to know that there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; groups here that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are interested in this topic.  I would like to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if there is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone who can assist me in researching my family\n&gt; &gt; &gt; name.I come from a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; long line of samurai and my ancestors come from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hiroshima \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prefecture, and Kamakura, I believe. My father had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the opportunity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be in Japan while he was in the Army after the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Second World War \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and visit our distant relatives. And had the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; privelige to see the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; family tree in Hiroshima Prefecture.  I know that my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; name can be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; traced back to about 800 years, and that they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samurai. My last \n&gt; &gt; &gt; name is Kodama.  And from what my pop and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grandparents have told me, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it is indeed a very well respected name. Also,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that my direct \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ancestors were over 5feet 11 to 6 feet tall. Which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is very unusual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for Japanese men.  ( I am 5&#39;11 and 3/4 &quot; tall.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s about all for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; now, but I look forward to hearing from you folk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take care and God Bless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoshio Kodama, Sergeant, US Army\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t\t\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
