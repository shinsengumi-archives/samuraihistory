Lyle Parker&quot; &lt;rntihg@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=43901450\r\n\r\nDear O&#39;Keefe,\n\nThe samurai were well aware of the The Art of War from well before the \nSengoku era.  Though the exact entry date into Japan is unclear, the work \nattributed to Sun-Tzu (as well as the other 6 Chinese Military texts from \nancient China) were extant in Japan at least by the 12th century.  Of \ncourse, these texts came to Japan in their original classical Chinese form, \nwhich was unreadable to most.  Only those people with &quot;classical&quot; education \nwould have had any chance to read them.  Before the Tokugawa era it was only \nthe select few, (e.g. - Imagawa Ryoshun, Kusunoki Masashige) who were \nerudite enough warriors to have a chance to have read them for themselves.  \nThese men were generals -- great leaders of men -- and in that sense a bit \ncloser to the courtiers in terms of education.  As for the more &quot;common&quot; \nfighting men, though they may have learned of the strategic principles \ninculcated in Sun-Tzu and the like, there was almost no possibility for them \nto have read them individually.\n\nI heard recently, though, that by the 15th century there existed a sort of \n&quot;cheat book&quot; (Japanese name escapes me) -- similar to the books we have \nnowadays of useful quotations -- that had commonly quoted sayings from \nChinese classics (Military, Confucian and otherwise) as well as works of \nJapanese &quot;high&quot; literature.\n\nI believe that in his book _The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China_, \nRalph Sawyer mentions that there is info in Samuel Griffith&#39;s translation of \nthe Sun-Tzu about its dissemination into Japan.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nCheers,\n\nShannon\n\n\n----Original Message Follows----\nFrom: &quot;O&#39;Keefe&quot; &lt;Viva77@...&gt;\nReply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: [samuraihistory]\nDate: Thu, 13 Dec 2001 20:51:40 -0500\n\nHello. Did the samurai in the olden days know  THE ART OF WAR  from Sun Tzu? \n  and did they know any hipnosis these  questions are on my thoughts thanks\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\n\n\n\n"
