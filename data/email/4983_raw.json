He \nsays, &quot;Hara-Kiri is what you do to a fish, seppuku is what a man does \nto himself.&quot; While poetic, I thought perhaps he was joking, but he \ninsists calling ritual suicide &#39;hara-kiri&#39; is a Western \nmisunderstanding. According to him, the proper term is seppuku.\n\nI also thought that the reason for tying the belt around the legs was \nso that the body would fall forward, since it was considered \nundignified for a bushi to fall backwards. Also, to fall forward and \nput the head down is a much more efficient position for the second to \ncut (or so it would seem.)\n\nCan anyone tell me whether the practice of cutting the neck so as to \nleave a thin string of tissue between the body and the head (to \ndifferentiate the body of a man who committed seppuku from a fallen \nenemy whose head was taken) was ever extant? I&#39;ve read of it in a few \nbooks, but have not seen any scholarly verification.\n\nLili\n\n\n\n"
