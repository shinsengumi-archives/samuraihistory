(My mind is forever stuck\n&gt;in the Bakumatsu.)\n&gt;\tCremation supposedly began with the monk Dosho in 700, spread to the\n&gt;upper classes and slowly\n&gt;&quot;continued with the popularization of Buddhism throughout the\n&gt;Kamakura and Muromachi periods, cremation became a practice of the\n&gt;masses. By the Edo period however the growing influence of Confucian\n&gt;ideology led to a tendency to avoid cremation and in certain areas\n&gt;burial was reinstated (probably the area I was thinking of) . In the\n&gt;Meiji period cremation was prohibited between 1873 and 1875 during\n&gt;the upsurge of anti-Buddhist sentiment that accompanied the early\n&gt;Meiji  governments&#39;s efforts to encourage Shinto (must be where I got\n&gt;the idea), but once again became a common practice after the\n&gt;government directed that fatalities from contagious disease be\n&gt;cremated to halt the spread of epidemics.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\tQuoted from the Kodansha Illustrated Encyclopedia of Japan (Eibun\n&gt;Nihon Daijiten). Not easy to admit when one is wrong but always\n&gt;appreciate the opportunity to learn something more...\n&gt;-t\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWindows-ty�p�yt�haun avulla l�yd�t tiedot koneeltasi silm�nr�p�yksess�. \nhttp://toolbar.msn.fi\n\n\n"
