There&#39;s the occasional error and of course a lot of literary license is taken (the killers who have mastered the touch of death and the killing scream).\nShe can be very brutal in describing samurai arms and armor (many times sounding like she&#39;s describing a European Knight). Her early books are the best-the last few have been somewhat weak, but the latest (released July 31), &quot;The Assassin&#39;s Touch&quot;, was a nice return to form.\nCloud of Sparrows had the background history correct but much of the behavior of the Japanese characters was out of date. It belonged more to the samurai of the Sengoku era. The story was completely outlandish, but very entertaining-I enjoyed the book quite a bit. Autumn Bridge, on the other hand, veered way off the tracks, crashed, and burned.  Another entertaining fiction series is a set of samurai mysteries penned by (hope I get the name right) I. L. Parker. They&#39;re set much earlier, in Heian Japan, and the titles include Rashomon, The Hell Screen, and The Dragon Scroll. One I would avoid like the plague is The Tales Of The Otori Clan series. It has quite a few fans and is supposed to be made into a film, but for me it lacked any sort of Oriental/Japanese flavor (it&#39;s set in a Japan like fantasy land-I suppose it appeals to the Legend Of The Five Rings RPG crowd). It came across much more as European medieval fantasy. \n\n\n\n\n"
