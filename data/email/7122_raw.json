I honestly think that no one really knows what this ninjutsu thing is alk about. No one here is backing their beliefs on the subject just adamantly dissing another individual. Anyone here take authentic ninjutsu who and debunk or refute any of this? If not let it die and let&#39;s discuss things we actually know about. Too much energy is being expended on a topic that in all reality doesn&#39;t matter. Bottom line.....regardless of the instruction real fighting techniques are being taught no I am not one of Hayes students but damn who really cares?\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt;\nDate: Thu, 12 May 2005 23:33:12 \nTo:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: New Ninja documentary\n\nsorry made a slight error there on the first email. I was saying that i got a real kick out of reading your discussions about this new ninja documentary. You guys are really, really passionate about this stuff on both sides of the camp. \nLater!\n\nKitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; My gripe was people were attacking it because Hayes\n&gt; was in it so it had to be bad. If youhavent seen it\n&gt; then you havent a clue whats in it.\n&gt; \n\nThat is the danger of using such a questionable source - you \nautomaticaly throw your entire project into question.  If the New \nYork Times wrote a scientific article about how vitamin X from ABC \ncompany cures breast cancer, but one of the contributors was the \nhead of the ABC PR department who was previously censured for lying \nabout the efficacy of ABC company&#39;s previous vitamins, that would \nautomaticaly call into question the veracity of the entire article.  \nFortunately the veracity of your sources MATTER, and in using Hayes, \nthey display a profound lack of discernment in the eyes of people \ninterested in the actual history.  By default one is forced to \nwonder if this is either A) a thrown together fantasy fest to \nglorify the ninja, sell DVDs of the show, and get Hayes even more \nrecognition and students for his schools, or B) they just didn&#39;t \nknkow any better, which doesn&#39;t speak well for them.\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
