Seeing this from the placement of \n&gt; troops, he proposed a confab with the other general.\n&gt; \tHe spent all night showing the man on maps of the area the precarious \n&gt; position he was in and suggested all the things he might do to resist \n&gt; but showed him in the end the result would always be the same. Seeing \n&gt; he was in no position to resist he surrendered his troop without a \n&gt; single man lost. War without fighting? or the greatest trick ever \n&gt; played by a general?\n\nI don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll tell you this: they were fighting a war with a very \ndifferent concept of values than these days. Can you imagine Rommel and Patton \nhaving gotten together for such a confab? &lt;G&gt;\n\nTony\n\n\n"
