Oda was a warlord \n  that started the drive to unify Japan, beginning at Okehazama.  I believe he \n  did receive the sanction of Emperor Ogimachi (not that it meant anything in \n  terms of real power other than the emperor&#39;s backing), but no, he was neither a \n  dictator or the sole unifier of Japan.
