From that point the sport became an intrinsic part of the martial tournaments, along with equestrianism and archery, with the sumaibito/sumotori drawn from across the country appointed to represent either the Right or Left garrisons of the Imperial Guard. Later Minamoto no Yoritomo was a great fan, holding bouts at the Tsuruoka Hachimangu Shrine, then later Oda Nobunaga who organized a 1,500 strong bout at Azuchi-jou in 1578. During the Edojidai, numerous ronin turned to sumo in the entertainment quarters of Edo or Kyoto, while others served daimyo, receiving a stipend and receiving samurai status. The rikishi are surely continuing their fondness for &#39;traditional Japan&#39;,  but so are those who hold traditional style weddings, wear yukata in the summer, learn ikebana or sado, et alia. Sumo was not a separate institution but part of the fabric of court, and later samurai,\n life, and therefore it is only natural that the fashions and traditions should pass over. \nM.

Is it just another way \nin which the rikishi are showing their affinity for &quot;traditional&quot; Japan, like \nthe reason they wear kimonos?  Thanks.  :-)  Take care.\n\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
