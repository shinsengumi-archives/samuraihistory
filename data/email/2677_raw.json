I give 3 out of 5.\nWe are all grown-ups. I hope that people know what is\nreal and what is not.(although I am aware that there\nare some under-aged people in this group without the\nage restriction)\n\nMy point is this, though. If you want to compare\nyourself with say, Kenshin, limit your comparison\nbetween you and Kenshin. Do not extend it to between\nJapan and America. \nIt is like saying that hey I am from Japan. So,\neverybody here has swords. Or I am from America.\nEverybody here is intelligent... It is just silly.\n\nAs a foreigner, when I meet American friends, I do\nfind very respectful and competent people. But, I do\nmeet some loser who just makes me uncomfortable by\ntying his or her identity to that of America, saying\nthat I am a merely(?!) Korean... These losers have\nobviously have problem with his or her self-esteem,\nwhich I can not help.\n\nBut, when I see America, I think of John. F. Kennedy,\nGeorgy Washington, Kenneth. Galbraith, Walt Rostow,\nand etc... That is why I came to this country. \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi there - I&#39;ve finally seen it. I am not going to\n&gt; discuss the story \n&gt; here yet, because I couldn&#39;t do so without spoilers,\n&gt; but after reading \n&gt; a few comments I&#39;ve seen on IMDB and other movie\n&gt; website, I&#39;d like to \n&gt; say one thing.\n&gt; That is, do not go to see &#39;Last Samurai&#39; with the\n&gt; expectation to see a \n&gt; super-realistic, super-historically-accurate movie.\n&gt; I really do not \n&gt; think that was the idea of the\n&gt; producers/director/Tom.\n&gt; I would really take it for what it is: historical\n&gt; fiction with \n&gt; beautiful photography and cinematography, some\n&gt; memorable scene, a \n&gt; simple plot, and some mainstream cliche&#39;.\n&gt; However, I really enjoyed it. For me, it&#39;s a 4,5/5.\n&gt; cepo, honolulu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
