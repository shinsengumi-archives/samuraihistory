As the person \n&gt; who put together that bio is offline and currently incommunicado, I \n&gt; can&#39;t verify where he got that info.  So I&#39;ll see what else, if \n&gt; anything, I can find.\n\nIf that&#39;s possible, that would be great! As prevoiously noted, I can\nsimply report the relationship between those two individuals (and the \ntwo Obata lines) as &quot;suspect, but unconfirmed&quot;. However, it would \nreally be a treat to be able to settle it all a bit more \ndefinitively. \n\nThanks for your efforts on this--I&#39;ll hold off on the wrap-up of my \nproject for a bit in case any more clues emerge.\n  Arigato!\n   \nMarlene\n\n\n"
