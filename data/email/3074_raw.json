Thank you for the dates on the bolt action rifles, I knew they did not exist as early as the 1870&#39;s..\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Mon, 12 Jan 2004 04:31:32\nFrom: murphymurphyjohn@...\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nThe first practicable US bolt action was the Krag-Jorgensen of 1898 war with \nSpain.  The first British model was the Lee-Metford of 1888.  Therefore, any \nbreech loaders in Imperial Japanese army in 1877 were movie anachronisms.   \nMuskets----rifled muskets------in first battle could have been Civil War surplus \nModel 1861 Springfield percussion muskets.  The US Army in 1877 was using the \nlater 45-70. caliber trap door Springfields,  still single shot.  This is what \nhelped doom Custer at Little Big Horn in 1876:  renegades had armed Indians \nwith the Model 1873 Winchester repeating rifle.
