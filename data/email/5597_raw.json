One day, to his dismay, he is \nordered by his lord to confront and kill an high-ranking warrior. No \nordinary samurai drama, Director Yamada Yioji&#39;s film is an \naffecting, probing study of human relationships and of an individual \ncaught up in the upheavals of a changing world. The winner of \nmultiple awards in Japan, including &quot;Best Picture,&quot; Twilight Samurai \nis the 75th film by one of Japan&#39;s most successful and celebrated \nfilmmakers.
