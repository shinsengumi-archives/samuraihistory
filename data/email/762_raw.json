Would I want to fight a battle with them?  Hell \nNO!!!  \nBeing a genius at a strategic game would simply make one \noverconfident and that would be your downfall.  The marks of a \ngreat military mind, include the abilities to; read the motivations \nof others, to be able to manipulate them to your will, and if they \nchoose not to bend to your will, force them into another pit that \nyou have made for them.  Can I do any of that?  \nThe answer is no again.  I&#39;d have to lie, cheat, and steal (E.G. \nModern Military assets at my disposal but not at thiers).  Then \nand only then would I even stand a glimmer of hope.  Maybe I&#39;m  \njust a retard but I wouldn&#39;t even be able to keep my cool ..I&#39;d \nprobably pull a Katsuyori. :P\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., lee thompson &lt;cmotdibbleruk@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Who else here would like to challenge Nobunaga or Sun tzu to \na game of chess? or a multiplayer on Total War? \n&gt; \n&gt; Who thinks they would win?\n&gt; \n&gt; Lee\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get personalised at My Yahoo!.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
