After that, it would be returned to the maker to be stamped how well it held up, but it was mroe for a durability test than a sharpness test, as any sharp blade could cut, but not every blade would stay intact. Some may crack or even break entirely if the craftsmanship was flawed.\n\nWilson\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Mon, 15 Dec 2003 12:13:27\nFrom: Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nActually the blades use to have a symbol for how many\nbodies it could slice through which determined how\nsharp it was.\n\n--- Josh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well AJ, I reckon its my turn *smacks his head on\n&gt; the desk* How sharp is any blade??
