And even more \nespecially,=\r\n there is little evidence that they were taken to battles. \nThe Japanese ha=\r\nd panelized wooden houses and other buildings which \nwere at times moved fr=\r\nom one place to another.\n&gt; \n\nYou are right.  There is very little evidence =\r\nof the use of Japanese \nusing tents at all - one way or the other - either =\r\nin books, or \nscrolls or T.V or film.  However, I find it somewhat hard to =\r\nbelieve \nthat they &quot;never&quot; slept in their tents or take them to use \nas &quot;co=\r\nmmand posts&quot;.  In my years of studying history from various \nparts of the w=\r\norld, I&#39;ve found that just because there \nisn&#39;t &quot;evidence&quot; that a particula=\r\nr thing was done, it more often than \nnot doesn&#39;t mean that it wasn&#39;t done =\r\neither.  It has also been very \ninteresting to note that things that were s=\r\npouted as &quot;fact&quot; twenty \nyears ago, are sometimes proven to be &quot;fiction&quot;.  =\r\nIt&#39;s one of the \nreasons why I LOVE history!\n\nI belong to a group of histor=\r\nical enthusiasts...Not the SCA....and I \nintend to set up a Japanese Feudal=\r\n Age encampment that is as accurate \nas possible. (I will probably start ou=\r\nt small, and expand as i go.) I \nand the other members in my household, nee=\r\nd a place out of the sun \nand weather (since where I live is humid and rain=\r\ny in the summer - \nkind of like Japan.).  I also need a place that will all=\r\now me to \nprotect weaponry and yoroi (as well as hide other non-historical =\r\n\nperiod stuff like cots and sleeping bags when necessary.) from prying \neye=\r\ns, inquistive hands and those same weather elements.  \n\nLastly, when the pu=\r\nblic comes through the encampment, I want them to \nsay &quot;oooh!&quot; and &quot;Ahhhh!&quot;=\r\n.  When they ask questions, they&#39;ll get the \ninformation like you just gave=\r\n me regarding the use of the akunoya.  \nWhen they leave for the day, and th=\r\ne site closes down to the public, \nI need a place to lay my head and prepar=\r\ne for the next day.  Though \nperhaps historically inaccurate, I&#39;ll probably=\r\n be sleeping in the \nakunoya out of convenience and neccessity.  (I don&#39;t t=\r\nhink the local \nBaptist church would take kindly to my riding up in full yo=\r\nroi and \nkicking them out so I have a place for me and my samurai to stay ;=\r\n-\n)  ) \n\n&gt; As for carports. I understand the allure of using carports. \nHow=\r\never, you should probably come up with simple box beam type posts \nto enclo=\r\nse the aluminium poles. Covering them with wood grain contact \npaper does l=\r\nittle to disguise their essential wrongness.j Another \nproblem with carport=\r\n construction is that the vertical supports may \nnot really be in the right=\r\n places to replicate what we know of \nakunoya from iconographic evidence. I=\r\nf you are more industrious, why \nnot buy lumber and make the frame yourself=\r\n?\n\n&gt; \nI agree with you  - in principle - that using a carport is not very \n=\r\npalatable.  Unfortunately, we have to live in today&#39;s day and age and \nI ha=\r\nve to be concerned with ease of set up and take down, \ntransportability, st=\r\nructural integrity and safety.  Though I like the \nidea of using real lumbe=\r\nr for the framework, I don&#39;t have the luxury \nof having a team of skilled J=\r\napanese carpenters who can produce \nhistorically accurate joinery or the de=\r\nsire to transport the weight \nof the frame work alone. (The truck I use to =\r\ntransport my encampment \nwill only hold so much in both cubic space and in =\r\nweight and I don&#39;t \neven want to go into the logistical challenges that are=\r\n added when I \nbring the horses and all of their accoutrements.) \n\nRest ass=\r\nured, that I will do a very good job of &quot;covering&quot; the poles \nand they will=\r\n look just like wood (from far away).  I was originally \nthinking of using =\r\nbamboo to cover the metal poles. (I have alot of it \navailable and could ho=\r\nllow it out to cover the poles.) BUT Tony said \nthat was definitely &quot;out&quot; s=\r\no I&#39;m thinking of other ways to cover the \npoles to make them look like &quot;wo=\r\nod framing&quot;.\n\nI&#39;ll also look closely at the spacing of the vertical support=\r\ns that \nhold up the top. (Along with the correct width of the fabric.)\n\nI w=\r\nas hoping to have discussions like this and welcome your insight \nand exper=\r\nience.  If you have any pictures or drawings of what that \njoinery looked l=\r\nike, I&#39;d appreciate it.  If you have access to book \ntitles so I have resea=\r\nrch documentation to support my endeavors, \nthat&#39;s even better.  Anything t=\r\nhat will add to the great information \navailable on Tony&#39;s site would be he=\r\nlpful.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
