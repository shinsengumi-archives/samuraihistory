Reign, or  Rule  is collect.  Sorry about this.\n   \n  You pointed out very reasoble things and comprehensive .  I  agree to that without no argument.\n  However,  before Meiji new Government which you pointed out came out  in Japan which ,  something had already been happened in Edo era society.  Let me explain as follows;\n   \n  Considering Buke days for about 1,200 years,  the final stage for them was end of Edo era.  \n   \n   At the first stage when Yeyas Tokugawa, shogun,  opened Government ( Bakufu ) through  200 years after that , which was 1860 AC  , feudalism had been followed  and Buke had been safety.  After 200 years warriors days ,  all Japanese enjoyed peasful life for long times.\n   \n   However,  from the interim of Edo era onward already,  the seed of problem to maintain Buke rank had been born,  which was  the reason , the cause of the change from  feudalism  to money oriented society,  or commodity oriented society and which triggered the situation Buke rank was unable to\n live without having put more heavier land tax to peasants .   Furthermore, the export of textiles, or foods , etc from Japan to overseas had been increasing, which brought more demand for those things and the prices had hiked so much , triggering more poverty to Buke.    And the peasants formed\n their own army and raised riots in everywhere.   Edo government tried to settle those riots, but they could not solved completely.    On the contrary,  the merchants had become  richier and richier  , getting more power.  \n   \n  Buke had been finally facing to the poverty  and formed  hostility groups against Edo  Gernment because Edo Gernment could not help Buke.\n   \n  At that time,  some new thinkers came out who stressed liberalism and said Japan shoud be reigned by the capable man not only by Buke, no matter what ranks were, which tried to change from feudalism to new world implying  new government under new power..  Under these circumstrances, new power\n organised by  Chosu  and  Satsuma,  lower Buke rank ,  formed new government called Meiji .\n   \n  Due to the influence by the change of economic matters such as feudalism economic to capitalism finally,  Buke was forced to give up their rank  and many buke families were forced to sell their lands or assets to rich merchants or, new Meiji Government  and  finally had becom  peasants,  or, \n business man  by  investing money to company newly established under  Meiji  Government.\n   \n  So ,  please remember the seed of problem to bring the change to new world was born already inside the current , old structure,  long time before  next new structure.   Like cancer, the seed of cancer is born before come out to surface, visibility .    Economic matters  are the key factors to\n change the structure.\n   \n  Eddie\n\nJL Badgley &lt;tatsushu@...&gt; wrote:\n          On Sat, Nov 8, 2008 at 9:05 PM, yoshiyuki hiramoto\n&lt;eddiehiramoto@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; However, at the end of Tokugawa , Edo era, Buke had been vanished\n&gt; completely and disappeared . Then, under new government , MEIJI,\n&gt; Emperor returned and started to ruin Japan again .\n&gt;\n&gt; Why did Buke vanish in Japanese history after 1,000 years since birth ?\n\nDo you mean &#39;ruin Japan&#39; (i.e. Destroy Japan) or &#39;rule Japan&#39;?\n\nI think the reason that they &#39;vanished&#39; is clear: The Meiji\ngovernment officially revoked the warrior class. As to *why* they did\nit: The warrior class was seen by many as an old (thousand year)\ninstitution that was preventing Japan from modernizing. Rightly or\nwrongly they believed that to go forward, men should be treated based\non their merits, not their rank (I believe much of this comes from the\nChoshu rebellion, as I recall there were quite a few peasants and\nronin involved in that particular struggle).\n\n-Josh\n\n\n                           \n \n\n \n---------------------------------\nPower up the Internet with Yahoo!
