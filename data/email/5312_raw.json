Perhaps the bakufu\nwould send a message to the heir of the daimyo who\ndied, confirming that he would retain the possessions\nof his father, but there was no &quot;coronation&quot; or\nanything. Dad died, son took over. \n\n&gt; (on the same note, some spell DAIMYO and some\n&gt; DAIMYU. which is correct the correct spelling?)\n\nDaimyo. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
