And the new power defeated the other one to establish New Government ,=\r\n Meiji Government.\n\nBy the way , do you know who did open Japan&#39;s door whic=\r\nh used be closed against foreign countries ?\n\nSince then, Japan really were=\r\n forced to be changed, to be revoluted to face with barbarians through The =\r\npacific Ocean&#39;s war.\n\nJapan got the tiny bud of destiny to fight against th=\r\nem later at that time.\n\nYour comment on the above will be highly appreciate=\r\nd.\n\nEddie\n\n&quot;Haynes, A (Angus)&quot; &lt;angus.haynes@ rabobank. com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;The m=\r\novie The Last Samurai... is it a real part of history or not?\n\nThe movie it=\r\nself is, yes.

No. Some of the characters and events are VER=\r\nY LOOSELY based on real history, but 99% of it is Holywood fantasy.
