Still not sure if I can write in a sensible\nmanner, but I&#39;ll try.\nG:  The evidence is in your favour.  It all looks pretty sensible to me.\nIf I recall correctly, you had early on in your writing alluded to &#39;the\nartist&#39;s eye&#39;, and to perceptions that others might miss.\nG:  I don&#39;t recall the phrase, but I might have used it.  I don&#39;t dispute\nthe gist of this.\nSome people seem\nto have an ability to perceive that is so sensitive as to appear\n&#39;supernatural&#39;, or &#39;mystic&#39;.  Artists, particularly those of Eastern arts,\nincluding martial,  are taught (or advised) to learn to put aside their own\nego and absorb their environment, especially in the beginning, of their\ntraining.  Later on they have learned, or should have learned, to\nincorporate their ego into their perceptions &#39;properly&#39;, and &#39;become one&#39;\nwith the world around them.  Clumsily and said in clichï¿½ form, forgive me,\nbut that means to me that the person has become the same ego inside and out,\nand is in a state of &#39;constant harmony&#39; with their environment....   a place\nin their existence where perception of and response to their environment is\nso well ingrained that the individual appears to have some kind of &#39;power&#39;.\n  It&#39;s not power; it is &#39;mushin&#39;.....   at rest,  this concept is\n&#39;zanshin&#39;.............   but this you know already.\nG:  I&#39;m with you so far, but I&#39;ll note this:  as I see it, that is &#39;some\nkind of power.&#39;  I believe I&#39;ve said (though perhaps not here) that I&#39;ve\nseen a good deal of magic, but I don&#39;t believe in the supernatural.  This is\na nice example of the sort of thing I mean.  The terminology my Aikido\nsensei used to use - centring, grounding, gathering ki (often translated\n&#39;life force&#39;) - always reminded me a great deal of the way my Wiccan friends\ntalked about European paganism.  They called it magic, he always hastened to\nsay it wasn&#39;t.  From their respective approaches, I think they were both\nright.  Focussed will produces results, it&#39;s as simple as that.  And those\nresults are not always limited to obvious - or even rational - cause and\neffect.\nAs a person who has knit, crocheted, embroidered, and sewn since she was 7\nyears old,  the catalog of impressions my brain has stored about fabrics,\nyarns, and threads is more than I can consciously recall. We in the\nknitter&#39;s realm have a concept of yarn &#39;telling us what it wants to be&#39;\nsuch that we say the yarn &#39;speaks to us&#39;.  Other knitters I know scoff at us\nabout &#39;mysticism&#39;, and proceed to knit with yarn obviously unsuited to their\nproject and they are wailing and complaining about a &#39;troublesome project&#39;.\nThey wonder at how others of us can &#39;make it look so easy&#39;.  I try to\ndescribe the way I personally &#39;hear&#39; my yarn or fabric is not in words per\nse, but in a mind-full picture conjured by that store of impressions already\nthere.  If the needle size is wrong for the yarn, it will appear to &#39;fight&#39;\nbeing knit.\n\nAnother person who paints, draws, or writes is tuned to a different store of\ninformation, as are swordsmiths and all other artisans.   Persons who\ndevelop several avenues of pursuit get better at amalgamating information\nand perceptions of those arts into a cohesiveness, a &#39;way&#39; of responding to\ntheir environment that to others can seem a bit unreal, but it is not.  It\nis simply being and staying aware and responsive to the cues given by one&#39;s\nenvironment.\nHealth care providers, particularly nurses, also undergo a barrage of\nsensory input that is beyond conscious recall, but some of them can take in\nthe appearance of a patient, and the summation of impressions that &#39;come up\non screen&#39; &#39;tells&#39; them that something is not going well.  It&#39;s that &#39;gut&#39;\nfeeling.\n\nSoldiers also develop that catalog, unfortunately, with experience in\nbattle; Nathan can undoubtedly expound on this subject  much better than I.\nSome groundwork is certainly laid with intensive training.\n\nWhat do my previous words have to do with swords that  seem to &#39;speak&#39;?\n\nI think it has more to do with the person who is handling the sword, than it\ndoes with the sword itself.  I think it is that awareness, that catalog of\nphysical and visual impressions gathered over time, and the ability to allow\none&#39;s mind to create a meaningful picture.\n\nOf course I have a lot more to say,  also about the way a samurai may have\nperceived his blade,  but it mostly enters into the realm of psychology, so\nI won&#39;t go there unless there is interest in further discussion.  This is,\nafter all, a history list.\n\nOff to work with me....\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\nG:  The yarn analogy is amusing, partly because my wife&#39;s recently started\nspinning, but mostly because I&#39;ve lately found myself regrinding some stock\nblades - mostly Windlass Cutlery swords - that are tip-heavy and unwieldy.\nA student gets a blade, it&#39;s not suited to him or her - but with a little\nwork it could be...  I&#39;ve been told I bring out the &quot;inner blade,&quot; and while\nthat may be a little excessive, I do find I have a pretty clear feeling for\nwhat that sword wants to be.  As far as that goes, I agree with your\nanalysis completely.  That&#39;s the sense that tells me how much taper&#39;s\nneeded, what kind of ricasso to leave, whether a new pommel&#39;s necessary,\netc.\n...But it&#39;s not the same sense as that I get of the personality of the sword\nitself.  Consider your analogy to health care:  that experienced unconscious\nanalysis - to use a clumsy explication of &#39;intuition&quot; - may tell you what\ntreatment a patient will respond to, but it isn&#39;t how you can tell the\npatient&#39;s in the room with you.\nThat analogy isn&#39;t as stretched as it might seem, either, since the obvious\ncounter to that would be:  &quot;Well, I can see the patient.&quot;  Fair enough:  an\nex-wife did hospital work, much of it with seniors; she said she could\nimmediately tell when a patient had died, as soon as she walked into the\nroom, by a feeling of absence that didn&#39;t seem to be related to sound or\nsmell or sight.  I have no trouble believing this, and I doubt that her\nsensitivity is unique:  I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s a pretty common phenomenon among\nnurses - am I right?\nNow I find this idea so credible (even if I&#39;m wrong about it) not because\nI&#39;ve been around enough death to sense the absence myself, but because I\nfeel a corresponding sense of presence in many (not all, but many) blades.\nAfter considering Mr. Sinclaire&#39;s post, I&#39;ve come to wonder if a blade as\nold as he&#39;s speaking of might not have developed sufficient &#39;presence&#39; -\nperhaps a less inflammatory term than &#39;spirit&#39; - that it might be more\nconspicuously perceptible.  It is certainly my experience that a blade that\nhas been lovingly used for any length of time always carries with it a\nproportionately more intense presence.  That focussed will that I mentioned\nearlier is also a factor here.\n\nNow as a general note on this thread, I&#39;d like to apologise for an\nunintentional trap I set.  I didn&#39;t originally want to get into the subject\nof religion here, because that&#39;s not what this list is about.  But it is a\nfact that these ideas are connected to my personal faith, and in retrospect\nI&#39;ve come to think that if I&#39;d been clearer about that to begin with, the\nresponses I got might have been accordingly more respectful, and I wouldn&#39;t\nhave been in a position to take such offense.\nMy regrets and apologies for the resultant unpleasantness:  to Nate in\nparticular, and to the rest of you.  I look forward to more civil\ndisagreements, and to even more civil agreements.\n\tIn honour,\n\t\tGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
