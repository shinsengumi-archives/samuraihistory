L. Horn&quot; &lt;klh1_55@...&gt;\r\n\r\nHello all. I&#39;m new at this and hope i am going about it the right \nway. My name is Kenji and I am the product of a post WW2 \nMarine/Japanese marriage. I have a limited amount of info on my \nJapanese heritage, but here&#39;s what I do know:\n My grandfather (mother&#39;s father) was named Kikuma Maeda. \nUntil my mother&#39;s marriage to my US born father, her family was\nof Samurai lineage. She is from Sasebo and I know that their family \nowned all or part of a MT near there prior to the war. Her brother \nis still in possession of the family Katana, which is about 400 years \nold. Unfortunately, my grandfather died when my mother was a little \ngirl, my grandmother died when I was young, my mother has limited \nknowledge of her ancestry and there is a communication barrier with\nmy \nUncles overseas. Also, at about the time of my grandfather&#39;s death,\nWW2 began and it seems that much of the knowledge never passed on.\nAnyhow, I would greatly appreciate any info anyone can offer dealing \nwith the Maeda clan, their samurai background, lineage, etc. (I have\nread what is available on the Samurai-bigsite-city website). Thanks \nfor your time and sorry for the rambling. \n\n\n\n"
