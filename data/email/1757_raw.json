ALthough it could have \nhappened during the landings made by international forces when they \ntook the Satsuma batteries and destroyed them in August 1863. This \nwas in retribution for firing on foreign vessels. It might also have \noccurred when foreign representatives were in Kagoshima to witness \nthe seppuku of the man responsible for the attack on Richardson \n(Namamugi-jiken). However this would be highly unlikely.\n\tOne event I would like to research more is the incident at \nSakai, where 9 French sailors were massacred by Tosa troops en route \nto attack Edo. BUT because this was late in the game and &quot;the Regime \nchange&quot; followed shortly thereafter the European powers took little \nnotice of the deaths. I&#39;ve not been able to find much on this in \nprint but have always wanted to learn more.(The European governments \nof the time were very much involved in the events of the Restoration, \nthough it suited all concerned to let it play out as a &quot;civil&quot; war.)\n\tI have to agree with Tony and Hiraizumi Sensei, Saigo as \nwarmonger was the story put out by Okubos&#39; propaganda machine. There \nare very good reasons for his wanting to put himself at the center of \nthe Korean question. If you agree with Yates&#39; ideas they are easily \nexplainable. The saddest part is that inspite of the Okubo \ngovernments public protestations to the contrary they followed the \nvery same course of action proposed by Saigo just five years after \nthe Satsuma rebellion was put down.\n\tTom\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
