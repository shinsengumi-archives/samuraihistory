Lyle&quot; &lt;rntihg@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; While the concept of Japanese re-militarization may\n&gt; be &quot;laughable&quot; today -- \n&gt; though I disagree -- the case today is not the same\n&gt; as it was in 1970.  The \n&gt; 30+ intervening years have done much to shape the\n&gt; thoughts of the Japanese \n&gt; (nation and people) as well as the opinions of those\n&gt; looking in from \n&gt; without.  \n\nHaving not lived here in the 70&#39;s (I was only around\nfor the second half of the decade anyways) I can&#39;t\ncomment on that, but I will say the Japan is probably\nthe most adamantly pacifist country I can think of,\nsocially speaking. Many Japanese are barely aware of\nthe existence of their own Jietai, or were before the\nwhole Iraq deployment thing. I find it highly ironic\nthat the countries in Asia still get upset at visits\nto Yasukuni and keep pointing to it as a leftover\nvestige of militarism and a sign that Japan might &quot;do\nit again.&quot; China&#39;s CLEARLY the bigger expansionist\nthreat. \n\n&gt; I contend that the problem sending troops is a\n&gt; political one.  Koizumi, \n&gt; like most politicians, doesn&#39;t want to do anything\n&gt; unpopular with the \n&gt; people and so that is why it took them so long to\n&gt; get off their hands. \n\nOf course. And if it goes badly, he&#39;s toast. But\ninternationally speaking it&#39;s about time Japan got off\nit&#39;s duff and did something in the world. \n \n&gt; That this is not the only outlook in Japan is\n&gt; evidenced by the popularity \n&gt; of Mayor Ishihara.  He has been advocating getting\n&gt; rid of the \n&gt; non-aggression clause in the constituition (article\n&gt; 9 is it?) for some \n&gt; time, and yet remains wildly popular.\n\nYep, Article 9. Limiting Japan&#39;s &quot;defense&quot; spending\nsince 1954. Of course, even when they stay under 1%\n(the unofficial limit--as far as I know Nakasone in\nthe 80&#39;s was the only one to go over that) of their\nbudget, it&#39;s still a huge defense expenditure compared\nto many countries around the world. Japan&#39;s military\nisn&#39;t huge, but it beats the pants technologically off\nof just about anyone. \n\n  Anyway we\n&gt; should note that Mishima \n&gt; was not really looking for militarism, but a return\n&gt; to Japan&#39;s past, what \n&gt; he felt made Japan uniquely Japanese.  And that,\n&gt; more than militarism, was \n&gt; a return to reverence for the emperor and that\n&gt; (military) service should be \n&gt; in those terms, rather than in more secular ones.\n\nSure, got it. You are definitely more up on Mishima\nthan me (not my area of interest, really.) The\nendstate of this discussion is that we agree that the\nfirst poster&#39;s question on this is erroneous--it\nwasn&#39;t a general, it was Mishima, and it wasn&#39;t even\nreally a coup attempt. \n\n&gt; -Shannon\n&gt; &quot;I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle...&quot;\n\nI got spurs, and I even wear them to work sometimes...\n\nIf you ain&#39;t CAV, you ain&#39;t KUSSOO!!!!\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
