I have heard you mock (quite rightly) his book on the Ninja but what do you think of his other books? I have read your book on the Samurai and it is very well written but seems to contradict Turnballs&#39;s books, especially on the basic orgin of the Samurai. Are these just conflicting views? How d you view this work?\nThanks for you time\nJonny\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n  Yahoo! Messenger - Communicate instantly...&quot;Ping&quot; your friends today!
