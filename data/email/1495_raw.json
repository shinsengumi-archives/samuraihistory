Can we move on to relevant subject? Personally I&#39;m not \ngoing to bash you&#39;re chosen way of life, or anyone else&#39;s. But I don&#39;t \nhave to agree with it. I realize that Mr. Heaton is after a state mental \n&quot;wa&quot; so to speak. But this can be found in any philosophy or religion. \nThe path of the samurai is the way of Death. There is no peace in that. \nAnd it&#39;s unimaginably pointless without a &quot;lord&quot;, whether that lord is a \ndaimyo, a creed or a love.\n_joe\n\nTIMOTHY HEATON wrote:\n\n&gt;--- &quot;Anthony J.
