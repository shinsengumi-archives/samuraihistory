Tom has already replied with \na terrific and informative message. Btw Tom, what&#39;s the reference for \nthe story about Hisamitsu and his silver pipe? Is that in the Yates \nbiography? I don&#39;t own it and I&#39;m not going into the uni library for a \ncouple of weeks so can&#39;t check up on it.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt; If you have more opinions on this, please let me know and I will \n&gt; thank you at the end of my thesis ;)\n\nThanks, but I&#39;m just an amateur who&#39;s fascinated by bakumatsu \nhistory, especially the complex relationships between the shishi and \nthe han authorities - I know more about Choushuu than Satsuma \nthough.\n\nGood luck with your thesis\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"
