Korea is my past... I will serve the United States\n&gt;in a due time. So, please, do not misinterpret my\n&gt;email...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                        Sincerely,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                        Changsub Lee\n\nChangsub,\n\n  With all due respect. The text books they complain about are not books for \n*us*. They are the texts for children in Japan. As for most of the medeival/ \nancient history points, I&#39;d be far more inclined to believe real cites \nrather than attempts to disprove through lack of data. Many koreans have a \nsevere dislike for Japan (with good reason), but I am as unlikely to pay \nmuch attention to those who try to use history as a stick rather than a \nlearning tool as those who complain about prime-ministers visiting shrines.\n  From my Korean history class, I DO remember lots of jockeying for \nposition/intrigue/fighting between the 3 kingdoms. Would the kingdoms have \nbanded together to face an outside threat? Possibly, even probably if the \nthreat were great enough. Would one of the kingdoms use outside troops in a \npower play? Probably if they thought the cost benefit ratio were high \nenough.\n\nM.J.Peters\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n\n\n"
