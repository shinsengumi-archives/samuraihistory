My experiments with this technique and \nTameshigiri \n&gt; were conducted in Japan. The idea was first taught to me in English \n&gt; yes, but was confirmed again and again by my teachers in Japan. The \n&gt; language used for the most part was Japanese and the people \ninvolved \n&gt; Eishin Ryu swordsmen. I know it won&#39;t change your mind but may \nallow \n&gt; others to view on balance the two sides...\n\nI totally agree with what you are saying Tom, each to there own \nopinion. However it would be advantages to all if people could open \nthere minds to new ideas.  \n\n\n"
