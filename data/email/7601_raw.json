Thus we have, in retrospect, the idea\nof strictl=\r\ny delineated class boundaries, but I suggest the actuality\nwas a lot more f=\r\nluid.\n\nI would also suggest that Hideyoshi&#39;s edicts, for example, was to so=\r\nme\ndegree inspired by his desire to prevent the emergence of another\nHideyo=\r\nshi. On the other hand, Hideyoshi elevated non-samurai to\nsamurai status, a=\r\ns has been mentioned. Ieyasu did likewise. Who was\ngoing to stop them?\n\nThe=\r\n one abiding fact seems to me that a samurai&#39;s survival depended on\nhis abi=\r\nlity to sustain and defend himself, and then later, it depended\nupon the gr=\r\nace and favour of his superiors. Only then did the status\nbecome seriously =\r\nfixed.\n\nAnother view is that some samurai formed democratic councils with\nf=\r\narmers and artisans, exchanging services for food and goods, and all\nhaving=\r\n a say in the affaris of the han. This proto-democracy was\nquickly stamped =\r\nout as the larger daimyates subsumed the lower.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
