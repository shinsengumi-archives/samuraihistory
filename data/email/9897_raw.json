That war was named as Seinan Senso. The reason of cause of that war=\r\n was attributed to the difference of thought of between Saigo and the leade=\r\nrs of Meiji Government.\nOne was that Saigo proposed to send himself to Kore=\r\na to negotiate with the government of Korea at that time to open her in ord=\r\ner her to contact with foreign countries instead closing , but Meiji govern=\r\nment refuged his proposal. Second was that Saigo hoped to revolute Meiji go=\r\nvernment another time and creat new government formed by just regular civil=\r\nians like France&#39;s revolution instead by ex-buke , Bushi in Meiji Governmen=\r\nt.\n\nHow was Robert Lee ? Did he die because of war against government of U.=\r\nS. at that time ? or what? How did he die ?\n\nSaigo was not the type of just=\r\n guy of military, but rather a polititian.\n\nEddie Hiramoto\n\n--- In samuraih=\r\nistory@ yahoogroups. com, burker1@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Joe,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m glad to see =\r\nthat someone else besides me has noticed the \n&gt; similarities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Taking i=\r\nt one step further, Saigo was commander of Imperial \n&gt; Japaneses armed forc=\r\nes at one time; Lincoln offered the command of the Union armed \n&gt; forces to=\r\n Lee (who turned it down).\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think Lee really wanted to rebel ag=\r\nainst the US, he just \n&gt; couldn&#39;t draw his sword against his native Virgini=\r\na. Similarly, I never got the \n&gt; impression that Saigo wanted to rebel agai=\r\nnst the Imperial Government that \n&gt; he had helped install, but his sense of=\r\n honor would not let him abandon his \n&gt; followers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, Satsuma is =\r\none of the most &quot;southern&quot; provinces in Japan!\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In a =\r\nmessage dated 4/18/09 1:59:53 PM, joemaps@... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, exactly. I&#39;ve thought of that parallel too. In particular, th=\r\nere\n&gt; &gt; is a similar type of &quot;lost cause&quot; romanticism about the Confederate=\r\n Army\n&gt; &gt; and Saigo&#39;s army. Both Saigo and Lee revolted against the central=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; government, but both are now revered in prominent statues. Both of the=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; are thought of as having high moral character, worthy of emulation. A=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; both rebellions figure prominently in films and TV shows. The Boshin=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; War is like the War of Independence, and the Satsuma Rebellion is like=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the Civil War. Saigo played both Washington and Lee, who were both fro=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; Virginia.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Joe\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@ samuraihistosa=\r\nm, burker1@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always seen parallels between the Satsu=\r\nma Rebellion of 1877 and\n&gt; &gt; the US\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Civil War, with Saigo Takamori pl=\r\naying the role of the Japanese Robert\n&gt; &gt; E.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lee.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both wa=\r\nrs resulted in each country having a strong central government.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Bob Burke\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In a message dated 4/17/09 9:55:04 PM, joemaps@ writ=\r\nes:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am often struck b=\r\ny a number of parallels between US and Japanese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; history. For exampl=\r\ne, the role of the Meiji Restoration leaders\n&gt; &gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analogous to=\r\n the founding fathers of the US. Toshimichi Okubo\n&gt; &gt; strikes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me as=\r\n a Thomas Jefferson type of character. Saigo Takamori reminds\n&gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; of George Washington.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The analogies are not, of course, p=\r\nerfect. But they are strong\n&gt; &gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be interesting. This even=\r\ning I was comparing the Battle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sekigahara (East vs West) with th=\r\ne Battle of Gettysburg (North vs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; South). These are the two key larg=\r\ne domestic battles in both\n&gt; &gt; countries&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; histories. I was surprise=\r\nd to learn how close the troop numbers\n&gt; &gt; were.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At Gettysburg, it =\r\nwas 93K (north) vs 71K (south). At Sekigahara, it\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 88K (east=\r\n) vs 81K (west). How coincidental that such analogous\n&gt; &gt; battles\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nad troop numbers that were so comparable!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ************ *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Access 350+ FREE radio st=\r\nations anytime from anywhere on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; web.
