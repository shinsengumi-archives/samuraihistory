I&#39;ve got to do some serious\n&gt; research into what exactly IS out there before finalizing a choice to\n&gt; develop for a doctoral thesis. Preferably sengoku jidai. I expect \n&gt; sekigahara\n&gt; is done to death, but reading the more current analysis&#39; couldn&#39;t hurt.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Of course if I could do a comparative analysis of parallels in armour\n&gt; evolution between Europe and Japan, that would be my first choice.\n&gt; Unfortunately I don&#39;t think that one would fly.\n\nIf you haven&#39;t already, look for JSTOR. (&lt;http://www.jstor.com&gt;, I \nthink). JSTOR keeps online PDFs of the entire contents of HUNDREDS of \njournals, including Asian-related ones like Monumenta Nipponica and so \non. Universities usually subscribe to JSTOR, so you should be able to \naccess the files from your school account. One of the greatest \nfrustrations I&#39;ve experienced since leaving IU is that I no longer have \naccess to JSTOR.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
