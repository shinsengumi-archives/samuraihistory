Most wounds were deep cuts. Som=\r\ne were bullet wounds by the rifles\n&gt; provided by the Portuguese. Not much w=\r\nas written about that as far as I\n&gt; know. As for the dead bodies, they were=\r\n burned to stop the spread of disease\n&gt; and as an act of respect for the fa=\r\nllen warriors. For those who were highly\n&gt; sought after, a reward for that =\r\ncertain Samurai&#39;s head was offered by the\n&gt; Diamyo of his enemy. It had to =\r\nbe a fresh kill. Decomposition made\n&gt; identifying the face difficult.\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n have studied the history of the Samurai not only because it is\n&gt; fascinati=\r\nng but because I am from Samurai bloodlines. Specifically the\n&gt; Harubiyuna.=\r\n Thier kamon is two arrow feathers inside a circle. One pointing\n&gt; upwards,=\r\n and one downwards. I find myself both lucky and honored to be the\n&gt; descen=\r\ndant of Samurai. It&#39;s truly something to be proud of. Not for anything\n&gt; I =\r\nhave done but to be linked to such a rich history as the Samurai. I am\n&gt; ha=\r\nlf American, half Japanese.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good luck in your writing!

But as a practical matter, men wounded in battle had to be\n&gt; =\r\ntreated. Willingness to die notwithstanding, a dead samurai (or ashigaru) i=\r\ns\n&gt; worth less to his master than a living one. As I understand it, seppuku=\r\n was\n&gt; reserved for hopeless situations, where the only other option was ca=\r\npture or\n&gt; abject failure (the death of one&#39;s daimyo, say).\n&gt;\n&gt; I imagine t=\r\nhat battlefield medicine was very catch-as-catch-can and based\n&gt; as much on=\r\n Chinese medicine as was practical, but still, the more specifics\n&gt; I can g=\r\net, the better off I&#39;ll be.

For it is an honor=\r\n to die in battle than to run like a coward!\n&gt; Those who have shamed his cl=\r\nan are expected to commit Harikiri or sepuku!\n&gt; Suicide by his own Tanto.

It was\n&gt; considered &quot;humane&quot; iron=\r\nically!\n&gt;\n&gt; For the Samurai, death is expected of him. Not failure, but dea=\r\nth was thier\n&gt; way of life. They dont glorify death, but accept it as a par=\r\nt of thier duty\n&gt; and honor. Of course they expect to be victorious in batt=\r\nle always! But they\n&gt; also accept death as a part of that victory!\n&gt;\n&gt; As f=\r\nor medicine, if a Samurai was not mortally wounded, I heard they used\n&gt; sal=\r\nt to stop the bleeding.
