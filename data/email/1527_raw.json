I&#39;m\n&gt; writing a samurai legend and I&#39;m still looking on\n&gt; the\n&gt; Internet and I can&#39;t find what I&#39;m looking for, were\n&gt; there samurai that had legends written about them?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Andrea\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several excellent books and sources\n&gt; regarding legends. For a start try &quot;The Nobility of\n&gt; Failure&quot; - Ivan Morris: this work chronicles several\n&gt; personalities from the 4th - 20th centuries. Maybe\n&gt; even &quot;Musashi&quot; - Eiji Yoshikawa: An epic novel of\n&gt; the samurai era {so its blurb states..} Or even look\n&gt; at some of the Japanese Woodcuts, such as those of\n&gt; Kuniyoshi to find legend topics.\n&gt; Good luck with the writing....\n&gt; \n&gt;                                     Rod  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
