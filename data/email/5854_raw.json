It has been dubed the Keepe=\r\nr of Karate&#39;s Highest tradition, that tradition is Bushido. Master Ohta the=\r\n head of our association JKA England says that the way of the samurai has a=\r\n direct influence on Karate. The Okinawan&#39;s despite seeing themselves as a =\r\nseperate nation to the Japanese for a long time, were Samurai. Master Funak=\r\noshi developer of the Shotokan style was a son of a Samurai. It is a common=\r\n misconception that Karate is nothing to do with the Samurai, due to the mo=\r\nre common sport Karate. However if you study Bushido, Zen and traditional K=\r\narate as I do then you will see the Samurai influence. As an Anglo-Japanese=\r\n myself this is very important to me, I hope you can find more information =\r\non the Samurai and Zen. But never take the martial arts at face value.\n\nRic=\r\nhardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\nHi\n\nNo disrespect in tended toward=\r\ns Karate, but I am under\nthe assumption that Karate has nothing to do with =\r\nthe\nsamurai except to fight samurai by the Okinawan\npeople.\n\nMaybe karate D=\r\nojo is related to samurai principles but\ni would say Karate is not a samura=\r\ni art etc per se.\n\nI would say Iaido was more samurai related than\nkarate. =\r\nEven though it is clased as a gendai budo and\nnot Koryu\n\nMaybe if there is =\r\na member of this forum who has\nstudied one of the Koryu which was used by s=\r\namurai\nthey could shed more light on the subject.\n\nPaul\n\n--- luke berryman =\r\nwrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAs a traditional martial artist=\r\n I do have some\nknowledge of this subject, the Samurai&#39;s strict code,\nBushi=\r\ndo, is the underlining of all Japanese martial\narts, particulary Karate. Ze=\r\nn was a key feature for\nthe Japanese and the Samurai like the Dojo Kun in\nK=\r\narate the Samurai were bound to this doctrine.\nBushido gave them their way =\r\nof life, how to act and\nhow to honourable. Early Samurai would go into batt=\r\nle\nshouting of all the deeds they have done and hoped an\nopponent could mat=\r\nch their honour. I could go on\nforever but that would be boring, I strongly=\r\n recommend\nthat you mention martial arts in your essay because\nthe way of t=\r\nhe Samurai is still living with the JKA\nJapan Karate Association the club I=\r\n belong to.
