I have a few friends that practise ninpo and their suggestions have \nbeen pretty much dominated by the Stephen Hayes realm.\n\nAnybody know of a good scholarly book on the subject -- or chapter in a book \n-- in either English or French?\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nShannon\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"
