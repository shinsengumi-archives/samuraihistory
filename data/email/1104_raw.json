I found one email from \n&gt; this forum that Kitsuno put together showing just one of \n&gt; many &#39;innacuracies&#39; Turnbull has:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/message/665\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems that since he is pretty much &#39;the only show in town&#39;, he \n&gt; feels he can slack on the scholarship and get away with it \n(otherwise \n&gt; he is just a poor researcher).  and here is a post I found on \nanother \n&gt; Japanese samurai history forum in response to someone posting about \n&gt; Turnbull having some new material in one of his books:\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------\n&gt; &quot;Turnbull has done &#39;Digging&#39; and has &#39;new material&#39;?!?!?!?!?!? \n&gt; Has the temperature in Hades fallen that much? \n&gt; Hmm... I guess Hiroshi, the gimp Japanese boy Turnbull keeps locked \n&gt; in his basement, has been working overtime at those Rekishi Gunzo \n&gt; translations.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sooo hungly, prease gibu me foodo Tahnbull-sama!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;One more chapter, then you&#39;ll eat, Hiroshi. You&#39;ve almost got me \n&gt; enough information for another book! Heh, heh, heh.&quot;\n&gt; ----------\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a few Rekishi Gunzo books, and even though Turnbull cites \nthem \n&gt; in his books, I HIGHLY DOUBT he actually reads them, or uses them, \nin \n&gt; fact, most of what he has comes from Papinot&#39;s book, including the \n&gt; errors (as stated by kitsuno at the above link - including the fact \n&gt; that Turnbull doesn&#39;t CITE the book in his bibliography, which to \nme \n&gt; is outright plaigiarism) - and after 20 years of &#39;research&#39;, \nTurnbull \n&gt; hasn&#39;t corrected any of his errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, unlike the world of ancient Roman scholarship where \nif \n&gt; someone like Turnbull tried to pass himself off as a scholar he \nwould \n&gt; be hung, then after his corpse is burned at the stake, his remains \n&gt; would fed to lions, there is apparently no similar &#39;peer review&#39; in \n&gt; Japanese history scholarship in &quot;the West&quot;.\n\n\nLOL that is quite a funny writeup. I see your point.\n\n\n\n"
