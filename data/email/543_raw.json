My name is Sally, and I&#39;m very interested in feudal Japan. I&#39;m not\nstudying it in college, though I sometimes wish I was, because I find\nJapanese culture and history fascinating. I guess you could say that at this\npoint, my interest is more on the level of a hobby. I doubt my knowledge is\nanywhere near as expansive as most of the people on this list. But I do know\nmore about feudal Japan (especially Sengoku period) than the average person\nin the U.S.\n\nAnyway, this is my first post here, and I feel bad because I&#39;m not sure if\nit&#39;s totally on topic. As you probably know, the newest taiga drama &quot;Toshiie\nand Matsu&quot; is starting pretty soon. Well, at least here in the Bay Area, it\nstarts next week. ^_^ I&#39;m not going to ask about the historical accuracy of\nthe taiga dramas, at least not yet! I&#39;m sure all sorts of debates have and\nwill come up about such accuracy. After all, they *are* dramas, so they&#39;re\ngoing to be written in such a way to grasp the emotions of those who are\nwatching. (I admit it, I bawled at the end of &quot;Hojo Tokimune&quot;. Ah well.\nEmotional me. ^_^) But the good thing about the dramas, I think, is that\nthey generate a great deal of interest in Japanese history... as it did for\nme when I first laid eyes on &quot;Nobunaga, King of Zipangu&quot; and other such\nshows.\n\nWhew, I like to ramble, don&#39;t I? Actually, what I really want to know is if\nanyone has, or can point me to, a list of all the taiga dramas NHK has\nproduced. I&#39;ve been searching for one everywhere and haven&#39;t been able to\nfind it. It doesn&#39;t help that my knowledge of Japanese language is not very\nbroad. Ah well. If anyone can help me (or if you want to comment on\nsomething I&#39;ve said) it would be much appreciated!\n\nSally\n\n\n"
