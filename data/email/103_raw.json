Of those I think I liked\nTokugawa\n&gt; Yoshinobu the best. I found something a bit tragic in this last Shogun who\n&gt; had all the capabilities to lead but got trapped by  events that no one\n&gt; could control. I thought the openings credits with its moody music and\n&gt; photos really set the tone. It was truly and age of  great opportunity.\nThe\n&gt; story itself was a bit soapy at times and some characters notably the\n&gt; fireman&#39;s family seemed unneeded but I guess that&#39;s the demands of\nprimetime\n&gt; TV. Yes I liked Hideyoshi  too because of Takenaka Naito and Sawaguchi\n&gt; Yasuko. Aoi was good up until Sekigahara than really fell flat. The worst\n&gt; one I saw was the condensed version of 1973&#39;s Kunitori Monogatari. I guess\n&gt; it hurts to squeeze a 50 episode story into 3 hours. One look at 1966&#39;s\n&gt; Minamoto Yoshitsune shows how far TV technology has come\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way Nobunaga was 1992 and Yoshinobu was 1998, Genroku Ryoran was\n&gt; 1999.

I&#39;d have to say that out of those, Mori\n&gt; &gt; Motonari was my favorite - most of it was pretty new to me, and for\n&gt; &gt; the most part it had some excellent acting, but above all else, the\n&gt; &gt; makeup surpasses all the previous drama.  I think they must have\n&gt; &gt; added a little grey or a few wrinkles each episode, making the aging\n&gt; &gt; look so natural.  After it was over, and i went back and watched the\n&gt; &gt; first few episodes again, i was surprised at how young everyone\n&gt; &gt; looked.  Apparently it was more or less a bomb in Japan, but one of\n&gt; &gt; my favorites.  Hideyoshi would come up #2 for the entertainment value\n&gt; &gt; alone - Takenaka Naoto is one of my favorite Japanese actors.  I was\n&gt; &gt; also impressed by Sekigahara at the begining of Tokugawa Sandai,\n&gt; &gt; although apparently others weren&#39;t as impressed as I was...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; CEWest\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"
