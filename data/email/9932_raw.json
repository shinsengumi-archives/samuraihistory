My \npersonal favorite is the way Bushido was twisted to serve the daimyo so they \ncould better control those below them. For example the myth of a &quot;Samurai would \nrather die than face surrender or defeat&quot;. This was not at all true, many \ndiamyo and their forces surrendered, switched sides and lost battles and \nguess what? They live! With no shame. It was later, that this was put in. By \npeople (Nobles) who wanted to ensure loyalty.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nIt&#39;s not often I feel I can contribute to a thread, but I do recall reading that before 1600 an oft heard call on the battlefield was &quot;Uragiri&quot; - treachery, or betrayal!!  Yo - yet another faction had changed sides...\n\nHere is a movie about betrayal:\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304318/\n\nThen at\nhttp://forum.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=messageboard.viewThread&entryID=72639707&groupID=100142598&adTopicID=31&Mytoken=4050B489-3A39-4122-B5005F9602D261414540933\n(tiny url:   http://tiny.cc/qIsZb)\n\nI found this movie title with Toshiro Mifune\nSURONIN MAKARI TORU: YATATE TOGE NI URAGIRI O MITA (1983) Directed by Tachikazu Takamori\nLowly Ronin Returns: Betrayal at Yatate Pass (Toshiro Mifune).\n\nSo it seems betrayal is a strong theme in both samurai history still represented in current cinema.\n\nRegards,\nBarry Thomas\n(Australia)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
