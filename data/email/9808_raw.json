The &quot;name plate&quot; says something TA HISA- and  \nthe ne=\r\nxt kanji could be read kazu, shige, tada, mitsu, or tomi. The  \nfirst somet=\r\nhing is illegible and the fourth character can be read  \nmany different way=\r\ns, so this is likely a name but I can see how  \npeople would be unable or u=\r\nnwilling to posit a definitive reading.\n\tAs for the seal script the second =\r\ncharacter looks to be Hatake (=E7=95=A0) \n=E3=80=80not sure what the first =\r\nis. I don&#39;t have a good reference for this  \nkind of script. Would love to =\r\nhave recommendations if anybody on this  \nlist knows of a good book for tra=\r\nnslating seal script BTW. Even with  \nthe references available, since this =\r\nis very stylized there may not  \nbe a one to one translation that is clearl=\r\ny what the original writer  \nhad in mind. Adding to the problem is the fact=\r\n that the Japanese love  \nwordplay, if they are able to identify the charac=\r\nters they may be  \nnonsense to us but to a person of the Edo period would b=\r\ne an  \ninstantly recognizable name or punchline.\n\tI am just dumb enough to =\r\nspeculate on this while I suspect the  \nauthorities you have spoken to are =\r\ntoo smart to offer any kind of  \nanswer unless they are absolutely sure and=\r\n that is most likely why  \nthey didn&#39;t give you a name.\nTom Helm\ntoryu@tory=\r\nu-mon.com\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;\n- Vergil\n\n\n\nOn Oct 10, 2008, =\r\nat 2:18 AM, Travis Good wrote:\n\n&gt; I have an old yumi and I need help in tra=\r\nnslating its name.
