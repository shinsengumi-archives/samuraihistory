From wha=\r\nt I remember he was 13 when he first became a samurai \nand he had a form of=\r\n yoshi in his name somewhere. If you could ell me \nhis name or even give me=\r\n some information on him I would appreciate it \nvery much! Also I would lik=\r\ne some really good information on the \nMinomoto familly evolving around Yos=\r\nhitsune Minomoto,as well as \nsomething about Taira no Shigemori and temoe G=\r\nozen. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n"
