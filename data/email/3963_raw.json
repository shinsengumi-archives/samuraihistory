What you had said seemed \nnot only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  \nYou had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense \nof honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos \nwere well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their \nsystem of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  \nIn fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a \nconformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must \nfit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is \nlost.\n  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   \nThat&#39;s not because teenage boys couldn&#39;t find a girlfriend.  \nStudents, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot \nbear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.\nFor someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such \nblindness will prevent learning.  That&#39;s what this group is all \nabout.  Not making a snappy remark to make someone else look stupid.  \nIn this case, it was the snappy remark thet made Kyle look stupid.\n\nBrandon  \n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; To Kyle Segall:\n&gt; \n&gt; What I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see \nbelow) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. \nThe point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it \nin the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai \nclass placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and \ntheir familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against \nNobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his \nfamily. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your \nfather were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad \nfamily. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your \npedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has \ndozens of acounts. I ain&#39;t no kid, I have read about this subject for \nmany years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with me \nfine but a little manners on your part would be nice.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Kyle Segall \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 8:56 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Holy crap kid, do some freaking research.

If you were \n&gt;   dishonorable this would effect not only you but it would tarnish \nthe \n&gt;   names of your sons and their familys too. The peasants followed \nthe \n&gt;   same code of honor as well so it was not something just to keep \nthe \n&gt;   troops loyal.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; best regards\n&gt;   &gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   &gt;   From: jonathan lee \n&gt;   &gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   &gt;   Sent: Sunday, March 21, 2004 4:02 AM\n&gt;   &gt;   Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Hello Vladilen,\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Out of interest, what does this word &quot;honor&quot; mean to you? I \n&gt;   believe this concept is a sort of fake conciencnesse created \ncreated \n&gt;   by the people at the top to make loyal soldiers to die for their \n&gt;   battles battle. And in fact this &quot;honor&quot; is the most dishounarble \n&gt;   thing to follow.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   I believe the only honor is the honor to all of mankind and \nour \n&gt;   fellow human beings. This honor includes not to kill another.\n&gt;   &gt;   What does everybody else think?\n&gt;   &gt;   Thanks for listening\n&gt;   &gt;   Jonny\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Vladilen Blackthorne &lt;vladilen_blackthorne@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;   I&#39;m new to this site and I do not know much about samurai. \nBut I \n&gt;   &gt;   hope I have found a group that does know. From what I know \nfromt \n&gt;   &gt;   hesite and others is it is the perfect life. at least for me  \nto \n&gt;   die \n&gt;   &gt;   for the word honor. I only wish I had been born about 250 \nyears \n&gt;   &gt;   ago.. So maybe I could have fought int he battle of \nShiroyama.. \n&gt;   and \n&gt;   &gt;   died with the one thing I understand well I joined to learn  \n&gt;   more.. \n&gt;   &gt;   So I guess.. hi\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   ---\n&gt;   &gt;   Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;   &gt;   Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/\nsamuraiarchives\n&gt;   &gt;   --- \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Yahoo!
