I believe That if you\ncheck any stephen turnbull book especially the\n&quot;samurai sourcebook&quot; you will find this to be true. \nHe did however have the men doing his lineage &quot;find&quot; a\nlink to the fujiwara/minamoto name allowing him to\nbecome shogun.  Are you sure that Nobunaga was related\nto the taira.  The taira/minamoto battles ended with\nthe complete destruction of the taira lineage.  Also I\nbeleive that nobunaga&#39;s family was a &quot;gekokujo&quot; family\nhaving risen from being a simple family to a small\ndaimyo family.\n\nThanks for listening to my humble words.\n\nmusashi\n--- The Dragon of Eternal Rain\n&lt;Shourinou@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;      You bring up some valid points. It is a\n&gt; well-established fact that Hideyoshi could never be\n&gt; shogun. You brought up about his own lineage & I can\n&gt; confirm that not only HE but Ieyasu were not of\n&gt; Minamoto blood. Tokugawa basically threatened the\n&gt; life\n&gt; of the emperor into altering his lineage. Since the\n&gt; shogun was considered to be the source of all &#39;true&#39;\n&gt; power during the era, the emperor had no choice but\n&gt; to\n&gt; make Tokugawa a &#39;Minamoto.&#39;\n&gt;      I find it interesting that centuries after the\n&gt; great Minamoto-Taira wars that people wished to use\n&gt; these names, not only to exploit them for personal\n&gt; gain, but, also for sovereign protection. Meanwhile,\n&gt; they clearly held no reverence for the honor which\n&gt; their names derive from a mere mention. Yet, it\n&gt; eludes\n&gt; me that Oda Nobunaga, of Taira descent did not so\n&gt; clearly connect himself with his heritage in both\n&gt; name\n&gt; and nostalgia. It is no wonder then that he is the\n&gt; most famous of all Japanese, for the simple fact\n&gt; that\n&gt; he is both an enigma and a wonder to us all...\n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; &quot;I am Mikhal no Shourinou, son of Toshiro of the\n&gt; village of Rin, and loyal retainer of the Maeda\n&gt; clan.
