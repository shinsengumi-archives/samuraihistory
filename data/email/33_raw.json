Also notice\nthe use of the first character in the given name (Toshi)\n\nToshiie Maeda had at least four sons:\n\n1. Toshinaga [1562-1614(?) ] - had no son (he adopted his younger brother\nToshitsune to succeed him)\n\n2. Toshitsune [1593 - 1658] - had three sons Mitsutaka, Toshitsugu &\nToshiharu\n\n3. Toshimasa {or Takamasa}  - was on the wrong side at Sekigahara and was\ndisposessed hence no history...\n\n4.
