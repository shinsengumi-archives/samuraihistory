So\n&gt; far your the only one thats made sense. One guy told me that all peoples\nin\n&gt; japan wore them, or the variations of them. I&#39;ve seen many movies where\nthey\n&gt; didn&#39;t wear hakama. For instance Seven Samurai....Akira Kurisawa was a\n&gt; perfectionist he wanted everything accurate so I&#39;m inclined to think they\n&gt; didn&#39;t all have to wear them. But I needed some second oppinions on the\n&gt; matter.

There were different forms of hakama that\n&gt; &gt; were worn  at different times.  There was even a long\n&gt; &gt; version worn in the shoguns palace during the edo\n&gt; &gt; period that were very hard to move around in.  During\n&gt; &gt; the summer some samurai would wear kimono or a shorter\n&gt; &gt; version of the hakama.  These were common to foot\n&gt; &gt; soldiers in the summer.  For very formal occassions\n&gt; &gt; during the late sengoku jidai and the tokugawa/edo\n&gt; &gt; period they would wear something called kamishimo\n&gt; &gt; which was essentially a hakama and a stiff shouldered\n&gt; &gt; top that covered there kimono or whatever particular\n&gt; &gt; shirt they were wearing.  These could be formalized\n&gt; &gt; for a particular daimyo and or family.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope this is helpful\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Musashi\n&gt; &gt; --- oblivion@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to know if samurai had to wear Hakama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or was it by rank\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or preference? Or was it so that if they didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; follow bushido then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they didn&#39;t wear them?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
