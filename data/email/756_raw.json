I am reading James Clavell&#39;s book shogun for the \nsecond time. What I am wondering is why he has mixed up the names of \nthe Minomoto and Fujiwara clans. In the book the names are printed as \nFujimoto and Minowara. There are also other name innacurracies. Does \nanyone know if this was done because the book is a work of fiction?\n\nJeff M.\n\n\n\n"
