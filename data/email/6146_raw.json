I find it curious that, assuming you are a\nChinese emperor, you are so insistent upon using an article.  If\nanything, most Chinese who are not native speakers of English tend\nto omit articles, flinging them on the ash heap of lingual\nmisunderstanding (as I am sure that English speakers similarly\nbutcher Chinese, or Japanese).  But, because of your exalted\nposition, I will endeavor to not become too familiar and slip and\nuse your first name, &quot;The.&quot;\n\nPerhaps I was misunderstood: I meant, a movie treating the subject\nthat was less than two hours, in English, not subtitled.  You know,\nthe way a serious researcher would go about things.  (I seriously\ndoubt there&#39;s anything out there.)\n\nWhich would drag me to the OT subject of THE Ming Dynasty, and the\nthing that has me curious as to its meaning and why in the world the\nMings were so short-sighted that they completely failed to\nunderstand and utilize trade:\n\n&quot;Although merchants and trade in general were looked down upon,\nChina had established sea routes that were used for trade with Japan\nand south Asia. Starting in 1405 A.D., Zheng He began a series of\nseven naval expeditions that went as far as the east coast of\nAfrica. These trips followed established routes and were mainly\ndiplomatic. The last of these voyages was completed in 1433 A.D. At\nthis point, China was far ahead of the rest of the world in naval\ncapabilities. Their ships could carry as many as 500 men. However,\nafter the last voyage was completed none were ever again attempted.\nIn fact, records of the trips were destroyed and shipbuilding was\nrestricted to small-size vessels. As a result, China&#39;s coast was\nfrequently attacked by pirates.&quot;  --\nhttp://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/china/later_imperial_china/min\ng.html\n\nNow, paint me with purple dog excrement sideways, but doesn&#39;t that\nseem to be a bit, well, insular?  And, even more to the point,\nfoolish?  Bah, peasants, always thinking of peasant things, and not\nthinking of the big picture.  I think they managed to screw things\nup pretty royally, so to speak.\n\nI&#39;m going to extrapolate that the end of the Ming Dynasty&#39;s ability\nto extend themselves through naval power probably coincided with a\nrise in Japanese fortunes?  Any evidence to this effect in Japanese\nhistory, from 1433-1470 or so?\n\nMy apologies for dragging the discussion into the neighbor state and\noutside the confines of the Samurai (&quot;u&quot;, not &quot;a&quot;), but I suspect\nthis group will probably have some insight into this particular\nevent in history, even if colored by a heavy emphasis on the\nJapanese history of the time.\n\nAh, but this isn&#39;t researching papers for the youth of America (or\nanywhere else).  As a side note, I recall a webpage with an idea oft-\nduplicated which presented history. ALMOST as it was, but with a few\nfacts twisted around so that anyone who failed to read the\nintroduction at the top ended up with something that would probably\nget them an &quot;F&quot; on their paper.  It would have things like, &quot;Abraham\nLincoln freed the slaves, then invented the microwavable burrito\nwith hot sauce, but not too hot because the newly freed slaves had\nsensitive stomachs.&quot;  And it serves the little bastards right, since\nI had to go to a brick and mortar library to look things up, and so\nshould they if they want to get credit for doing some work.  Er,\nexcuse me, was I musing out loud again?\n\nI&#39;m off to lunch, and to start Ch. 1 of Mr. Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai, a\nMilitary History.&quot;  Wish me luck.\n\n-- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter\n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Matt &lt;yeomanforbes@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Ming (can I call you Ming?):\n&gt;\n&gt; No, no.

If you can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; mock badly\n&gt; &gt; compiled history, what can you mock?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not much, I suppose. Japanese popstars are always good\n&gt; for a laugh, though.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot;reading is so boring... is there a video I\n&gt; &gt; can watch to get\n&gt; &gt; all this information in a two hour or less setting?\n&gt; &gt; Without\n&gt; &gt; subtitles in English?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m kidding about that last.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can suggest a few things without subtitles in\n&gt; English. Though unless you speak Japanese, the\n&gt; subtitles in English would be beneficial :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
