There is a Japanese samurai television series \ncalled Toshie and Matsu.  I would like to know if what is depicted of \nthe relationship between Oda Nobunaga and Toshie Maeda is \nhistorically accurate, or rather, what is the story between the two \nsamurai.  The television drama depicts a sense of true friendship, \nthough stormy relationship in that Maeda is a kind, pure, \nsincere &quot;bullet&quot; for Oda, the reason the latter saw in the young \nMaeda capability beyond bullet concept--that hear is a man he could \ndepend and necessarily be a yes man.  I like to hear from a member \nwho could direct to read something on Toshie Maeda. I hope someone \ncan be kind to me and help me to understand better.\n\nMost sincerely, \n\n\n\n"
