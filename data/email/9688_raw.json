I can&#39;t believe how phenomenally =\r\n\ndifficult it is to piece together all this information...  Clearly, \nrecor=\r\nd-keeping was not a priority for Samurai or Peasants during the \nturbulent =\r\n1620&#39;s...  \n\nCan you recommend any well-organized books, periodicals, and/o=\r\nr \nwebsites that provides comprehensive lists of Daimyos per regions?  \ni.e=\r\n. I am looking for a list Daimyos on Kyushu only.  \n\nAlternatively, do you =\r\nknow where I can locate information on all the \nDaimyos in Japan in control=\r\n in the 1620&#39;s only?  I could then sort \nthe regions manually myself.\n\nAt p=\r\nresent, all I can find is some big old Alphabetical list of \nDaimyos and/or=\r\n Samurai families across all of Japan and across \nmultiple centuries...  wh=\r\nich isn&#39;t very helpful.  Overall, I&#39;d hate \nto reinvent the wheel if there =\r\nalready exists comprehensive records \nor study in this area.\n\nAny advice wo=\r\nuld be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nShaun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
