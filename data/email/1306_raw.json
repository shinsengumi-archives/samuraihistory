Had one eye, was nominally allied to Tokugawa\nIeyasu, though he was primarily out for himself. A\nvery able daimyo. That&#39;s all off the top of my head,\nif you check Turnbull&#39;s Samurai Sourcebook, it\nprobably has a blurb on him, or the website associated\nwith this discussion board. \n\nNate\n\n--- &quot;Scott &lt;scottc_4@...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;scottc_4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The specifing post reminded me of a question I had. \n&gt; Could somene \n&gt; here tell me who Date Masamune was?
