I need direction\n&gt; towards sites that focus on the raising of a young male in the samurai\n&gt; caste, probably for a son of a hatamoto, as well as a site defining\n&gt; the structure of the samurai caste.  The other thing that I am trying\n&gt; to work out, I&#39;ve seen references to both Shinto and Buddhism being\n&gt; practiced by samurai, but nothing clearly stating which was prefered\n&gt; and the time periods they were prefered in.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only other thing I was looking for, I&#39;ve seen lots of pictures of\n&gt; castle cities, however I am having a hard time finding a blueprint\n&gt; type deal - A layout, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help anyone can give I would appreciate it!\n&gt;\n&gt; Apollo\n\nIf you&#39;re serious about the topic of (military) power and religion in \nJapan the 16th century, the crucial text is Neil McMullin&#39;s BUDDHISM \nAND THE STATE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY JAPAN.\nThis is actually a book that I would suggest to anybody. Is very \ninformative and well written - half of it is about Nobunaga.\n\ncepo\n\n\n"
