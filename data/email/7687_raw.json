It&#39;s called AFTER THE RAIN, which deals with \nthis subject. I forget the director but it&#39;s not really a sword-slashing \n&quot;chambara film,&quot; it&#39;s a thoughtful film about what kenjutsu/kendo actually\nis. It&#39;s \navailable fairly widely with English subtitles. \n\n\nHope this helps a bit.  Nina\n\n\nTalking about good movie, have you watched  &quot;when the last sword is drawn&quot;?\nThis is a good movie too (at least that what i think).\n \nhere is the synopsis:\nkanichiro Yoshimura is a family man and a samurai who can no longer feed his\nwife and children due to the low wages paid by his small town clan.\nReluctantly, he decides to leave his loved ones and heads to the city to\njoin the large and renowned samurai faction, the Shinsen-gumi. Here he is\nforced into a difficult existence during one of the most tumultuous times in\nJapanese history. This wonderful gem of Japanese cinema is directed by\nYojiro Takita and written by Asada Jiro.\n \nTotok S\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
