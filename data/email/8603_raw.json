When someone says\nth=\r\ne &quot;sword just isn&#39;t that important&quot; and that &quot;its more of a weapon of\nlast =\r\n  resort&quot;. And if you had read the post &quot;meaning&quot; you would have \nseen I wa=\r\ns saying that in the &quot;waring states&quot; era you didn&#39;t know what\nyour opponent=\r\n would be armed with or if he&#39;d be on foot and there could\nhave been more t=\r\nhen one, there could have been 3 or 5. And if you \n&gt;thought the sword was a=\r\n last resort, you&#39;d better had a gun or your one\ndead dumdass.   Musashi an=\r\nd Ito Ittosai knew this and thy&#39;re famous! And\nkendo was formed around Ito&#39;=\r\ns techings, but when poeple got \n&gt;worried about their &quot;moneybags&quot; they soft=\r\ned it up.\n&gt;       So thanks you for pissing me off day!\n  \nEver heard of a =\r\nyari? If not, I&#39;d suggest you look it up, because that&#39;s\nwhat the primary w=\r\neapon used by samurai armies until guns gradually\nreplaced them in the seco=\r\nnd half of the 16th Century.\n\nAlso, please invest in a spellchecker.\n\n-Angu=\r\nsH\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis emai=\r\nl (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, su=\r\nbject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended r=\r\necipient only.
