Check  \nout; http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm and if you&#39;d like  \nto ask me questions online or off I am always happy to talk swords  \nand I am happy to introduce you to others willing to do the same  \n(www.nihonto.yahoogroups.com)...\n-t\nTom Helm AKA DrachenFadder\nwww.ncjsc.org\ntoryu@...\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamas&quot;\n- Virgil\n\n\n\nOn Apr 2, 2008, at 11:56 AM, cannonfodder_1980 wrote:\n\n&gt; This is not an history question! but I am looking to start a  \n&gt; collection\n&gt; of samuria swords, and since i am a bit short of cash i was looking in\n&gt; to some thing like a Paul Chen sword or a Ryumon katana, Is there any\n&gt; one here that can suggest a nice cheap alternative for around 200 to\n&gt; 300 british pounds???\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
