The family destroyed all copies so as far \nas we know none exist at this time. The same year he died, he appeared \nin &quot;Hitokiri&quot; starring Katsu Shintaro as Okada Izo. Mishima played \nTanaka Shinbei a real life ronin who killed himself when confronted by \nthe police, check it out.\n\tAnother method of seppuku, for the battlefield, was to grip the \nwakizashi with right hand reversed, passing the blade behind the head, \nlaying the cutting edge on the neck and pull. The left hand could be \nplaced on the back of the blade to insure a deep cut. Remember Nobunaga \nwalked into the heart of a conflagration rather than give himself up, I \nthink most would agree his was an honorable choice.\n-t\n\n\n"
