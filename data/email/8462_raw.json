My name is Ty, and I \nhave had an interest in Japan, particularly th=\r\ne samurai since I was \na child.  I have been interested not only in the his=\r\ntory, warfare, \nsocial structure, and food.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I will not pretend to=\r\n be an expert-rather I am hoping to learn \nfrom the group and eventually be=\r\n able to contribute useful \ninformation and resources.  I read your rules a=\r\nnd the misconceptions \nlist and agree to follow them.  \n\nDon&#39;t lose any sle=\r\nep over it, we&#39;re just one big dysfunctional \nfamily. It&#39;s a blast to watch=\r\n &lt;g&gt;.\n\n   \n&gt;   So much for my dreams of being a modern samurai and forcing =\r\n\ncowardly ninjas to commit hari-kiri with a butter knife.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Thanks =\r\nfor reading,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Ty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; Brings words and photos together (easily) with\n&gt;  PhotoMail  - it&#39;s f=\r\nree and works with Yahoo!
