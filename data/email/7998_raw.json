Running southward, it \n=\r\nmakes a big horseshoe curve near Ebisu and heads north to Roppongi. \nAt Ich=\r\ni-no-hashi, it abruptly bends east to eventually pour into \nTokyo Bay. The =\r\nriver&#39;s upper reaches are now culverts, but water \nemerges just south of Sh=\r\nibuya Station in a concrete conduit. In its \nlower reaches the river (menti=\r\noned in this column Oct. 7, 2005) has \na different name -- Furukawa.\n\nAlong=\r\n the middle reaches -- in the Harajuku, Shibuya and Hiroo \nareas -- the wat=\r\ners used to be abundant and were used to run mills, \na crucial source of po=\r\nwer in preindustrialized Japan. In this region \non the border between Edo C=\r\nity to the east and farming villages to \nthe west, mills were important for=\r\n grinding grain into flour or in \nremoving the hulls of harvested rice. As =\r\njust about everyone ate \nsteamed rice as their staple food three times a da=\r\ny, preparing kome \nfor the daily dinner table was a profitable business. \n\n=\r\nThe accompanying woodcut print, titled &quot;Hiroo Mizuguruma (The Hiroo \nMill),=\r\n&quot; depicts the largest mill along the Shibuya River. As the \nmill house is h=\r\nalf hidden behind trees, the viewer might be \nattracted first by a lively b=\r\nunch of people just about to walk over \na bridge. Carrying fruit and bottle=\r\ns tied to a pole are two men, one \nof whom is looking back and finishing of=\r\nf a joke, with the others \nbursting into laughter. The clumps of susuki gra=\r\nss growing near the \nbridge suggest the season is autumn.\n\nA short distance=\r\n upstream on the left is a dam. The water is guided \nbetween white-walled b=\r\nuildings to reach the mill -- which has a \nthatched roof -- and hits the wh=\r\neel at its bottom. Afterward, the \nwater returns to the river via a drain.\n=\r\n\nInstalled in a corner of a spacious garden facing the handsome tile-\nroofe=\r\nd building, the 7-meter-in-diameter mill turned out hefty \nprofits for its =\r\nowner, Tamagawa Kinzaburo, who had 10 employees to \ntend to the almost 100 =\r\npounding pestles that were linked to the \npowerful wheel.\nAs of 1888, 34 mi=\r\nlls existed along the Shibuya River, and they were \nlater applied to new us=\r\nes, such as cotton-spinning, but all \ndisappeared by the turn of the 20th c=\r\nentury when electricity was \nperceived as a more efficient power source. Th=\r\ne depicted bridge, \ncalled Yamashita-bashi, still exists, but it fails to r=\r\nemind you of \nthings past.\n\nWhen you start your walk, go from JR Ebisu Stat=\r\nion&#39;s north exit (or \nHibiya Line Ebisu Station, Exit 1 or 2). Go under the=\r\n elevated rail \ntracks by the station. Turn right at the second stoplight a=\r\nnd follow \nMeiji-dori till the road veers to the right. Pause to look for a=\r\n \nsmall playground off to your right and then turn right just before \nthe s=\r\ntoplight there to find Yamashita-bashi, now in drab concrete. \nFrom the bri=\r\ndge&#39;s other side, the wooded park is vaguely reminiscent \nof Tamagawa&#39;s gar=\r\nden without the mill.\n\nBack at the stoplight, cross Meiji-dori, bear left t=\r\no cross another \nstreet and turn left. At the next stoplight, go right, pas=\r\nsing by \nRinsen Elementary School, the third oldest public school in Shibuy=\r\na-\nku, founded in 1879 by local volunteers. \n\nIn the wake of the 1868 Meiji=\r\n Restoration, enthusiasm ran high among \ncitizens for the introduction of m=\r\nodern school systems. The decree \nof universal education had been issued in=\r\n 1872, but with its \nimplementation being delayed owing to budgetary and ot=\r\nher reasons, \nconcerned citizens took the initiative for school constructio=\r\nn in \ntheir respective locales once issued with a license from the mayor \no=\r\nf Tokyo. The first elementary school in Shibuya-ku was built in \n1875 near =\r\nthe present Shibuya Station with funds raised extensively \nby local leaders=\r\n, including Hachiroemon Mitsui, the head of the \nMitsui financial and indus=\r\ntrial conglomerate. Mitsui paid for the \npersonnel and maintenance expenses=\r\n, too, with funds from a mill \nhouse he had at what is now Tokyu Department=\r\n Store until the \nmunicipal budget became ready several years later.\n\nTamag=\r\nawa Kinzaburo&#39;s own involvement in Rinsen Elementary School is \nnot known; =\r\nthough, he is likely to have supported the school in his \nvillage as well.\n=\r\n\nThe construction site was farmland owned by the nearby Shoun-ji \nTemple. T=\r\nhe temple donated half of the 305 tsubo (about 1,000 sq. \nmeters) of land a=\r\nnd leased the other half. Much expanded since then, \nthe school continues t=\r\no stand at its birthplace.\n\nShoun-ji, too, remains in thick woods on your r=\r\night. To reach its \nfront gate, turn right at the T ahead and follow the ro=\r\nad hugging \nthe stone-buttressed edges of condominium compounds and the Sac=\r\nred \nHeart University campus. At the crossing with a shopping street, \nturn=\r\n right to pass through a roofed wooden gate and then left to \nfind Shoun-ji=\r\n at the end of the lane. \n\nThe unassuming temple is a quiet center of Zen B=\r\nuddhism. It was \npatronized by prominent daimyo lords in Edo. It was founde=\r\nd by Lord \nKuroda Tadayuki, daimyo of the Fukuoka domain, in honor of his \n=\r\nfather, Kuroda Nagamasa (1568-1623), who had contributed greatly to \nJapan&#39;=\r\ns unification under Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Tadayuki \ndesignated Shoun-ji a=\r\ns the burial place for the Kuroda family, and \nthe Kuroda&#39;s branch families=\r\n followed suit. As a result, an amazing \nvillage of quaint tombstones make =\r\nup the cemetery to this day. \nNagamasa&#39;s tomb is a plain stone slab, housed=\r\n in a fenced-in shed at \nthe far end of the cemetery. \n\nLeaving the temple =\r\ngrounds via the roofed gate, walk straight to \nreach Hiroo Station on the H=\r\nibiya Line. Nearby is Kato Gallery & \nFramer, which is famous for contempor=\r\nary prints and paintings. Time \npermitting, extend your steps to visit the =\r\nlovely Arisugawa-no-miya \nMemorial Park, originally a daimyo&#39;s suburban res=\r\nidence. Backtrack \nto Hiroo Station to return.\n\nThe Japan Times: Nov. 11, 2=\r\n005\n(C) All rights reserved \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
