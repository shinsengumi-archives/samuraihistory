I have\nno universi=\r\nty affiliation, so I have no &quot;colleagues&quot; to call on. Also,\nI am putting sp=\r\necial and hard emphasis on quality sources and\nreferences.  The sources an =\r\narticle are based on will be evaluated as\nwell as the article itself.\n\n3) C=\r\novered this in an old post, but only established PhDs can get\npublished in =\r\nMonumenta Nipponica - I can&#39;t, and I don&#39;t know anyone\npersonally who can. =\r\n It will be a forum for independent scholars as\nwell as academic scholars. =\r\n Also, to put it simply (the old post goes\ninto greater detail) - this woul=\r\nd be purely a &quot;history&quot; journal,\npre-20th century narrative history, biogra=\r\nphy, military, events.  Most\nJapan related journals don&#39;t cover &quot;just&quot; hist=\r\nory.  The goal is to\ndevelop something interesting, readable, and useful fo=\r\nr research.  The\nquality of writing, and veracity of ideas is more importan=\r\nt than a PhD\nor lack thereof.  But I am also not disallowing any subjects r=\r\nelated\nto Japanese history - anything regarding pre-20th century Japan will=\r\n\nbe evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nI call it a &quot;journal&quot;, but the real=\r\nity is that they will essentially\nbe books, more similar to a multi-volume =\r\nset than a journal as far as\nexecution goes.\n\nNot to mention, a print publi=\r\ncation is the next logical step for the\nSamurai Archives, which is one of t=\r\nhe main reasons I am moving forward\nwith this.\n\n\n"
