I noticed that swords have something like a crest on the hilt and handle. Usually it is a dragon. Did they ever place anyother sort of animal or symbol on the swords?\nThanks,\nRod\n\nTotok Sudarijanto &lt;totoks@...&gt; wrote:\nROD PAVEZ  wrote: \nHi there Samuel:\nI&#39;m sorry but  this movie is out on DVD?

I also never\nheard that he has trained samurai swordsmanship exclusively other than those\nincluded in his aikido mokuroku (or i may be wrong?).\n\nHowever, this one is also good if you really like watching samurai movies:\n\nSamurai Resurrection:\nThis is the story of a Christian martyr who is killed when the uprising he\nis leading is put down. Vowing vengeance he returns from the dead and with\nthe help of other unhappy souls he tries to destroy the shogun responsible\nfor his death. Opposing him is swordsman Jubei, who has to fight his way\nthrough the undead minions in order to stop the plot to bring chaos to the\nworld. (The Jubei character was a real person and shows up in other Japanese\ntales) This is the second version of a historically based supernatural\nnovel. The earlier film starred Sonny Chiba and was an action packed film\nthat made very little sense but was fun to watch. Here we have a nice blend\nof action and plot, then again maybe its too much plot. While this is an\nexcellent action film, though the larger implications of who some of the\ncharacters really are was lost on me since I&#39;m not as well versed in\nJapanese history. This is a film that assumes you know the period that the\nfilm takes place since it brings many real people and places into play. Who\never put the DVD I saw together must have been aware of the need to be\ninformed on Japanese history and customs so they included, as part of the\nsubtitled track, helpful tidbits about terms and people and places. It helps\nin the short term but by half way into the film I was feeling a bit lost.\n\nStill this is a very good movie. The action is spectacular, the opening\ncastle assault is amazing, and the horror is scary, how the dead come back\nwill probably creep you out. This is a well thought out and well made\nsupernatural action film. I recommend it, with the understanding that you\nmay feel a bit lost (Though that&#39;s not a reason to pass this by since it is\na good film)\n\n\nTotok Sudarijanto\nhttp://www.samurai.or.id\nemail: totok.sudarijanto@...\n\n&quot;The ultimate aim of the martial arts is not having to use them.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
