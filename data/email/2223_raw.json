In what year did Tokugawa Ieyasu pass the edict that allied lords \nhad to spend some time in or near Edo?\n\n2. How much time did they have to spend there?\n\n3. Where did these lords stay? A kind of &quot;guest&quot; castle, or where...?\n\n4. One of the fictional lords I will use has the surname Iwamura. I \nknow Iwamura was the place of a battle (I think this battle even took \nplace near the time frame of my story), I would like to know what \ndoes Iwamura mean (or perhaps Iwa and mura separated, I think it has \nto do something about a hawk?)\n\n5. Is an army of some five thousand men and six hundred cavalry big \n(for one single lord)? I think that, at least, six hundred horses \nsound like a lot...\n\n6. How many riflemen did lords have at their disposal? I know this \ndepends on the lord, but if you guys know of examples...\n\nMiburo Sam\n\n\n"
