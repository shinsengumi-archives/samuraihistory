I&#39;ll have to add the &lt;rage&gt; tag to my HTML list!\nsorry, just checked your pages, and sure enough: \n&quot;One thing that needs to be addressed first is probably my biggest \nbutton: Japanese armour was never made of wood or bamboo. It was \neither leather, steel, or a combination of the two.&quot;\nWell, with that out of the way, it is a bit off subject, but would an \naxe be any good in battle?  Seems to me it would be like wielding a \nbig hammer - swing - miss - stagger - readjust grip - repeat. \nObviously axes existed in Japan - they had to cut firewood somehow, \nbut was the reason it didn&#39;t appear in battle because of its \nunweildlyness (my new word for the day)?  Or did they just not think \nof it as a weapon?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;rage&gt; Armour! Was! Not! Bamboo! &lt;/rage&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; For all it&#39;s frightening look, the ono doesn&#39;t seem to have had \nmuch use. It\n&gt; wasn&#39;t a standard weapon the armies were equipped with. I believe \nthat, like\n&gt; the tetsubo, it was something that had been more in use earlier \nwhen armies\n&gt; were less rigidly made.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n"
