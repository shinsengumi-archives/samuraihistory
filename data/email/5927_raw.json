It is my favorite story \nof all time. If you haven&#39;t read it, I recommend it highly. For \nthose of you who have, and enjoyed it as much as I did, these \nposters are a must have. They are in mint condition, all in \nJapanese. This was purchased on site at the burial grounds. I also \nhave a tea cup, depicting a scene from the story. I have no idea \nwhat these are worth, but a recent divorce forces me to sell.All \noffers will be considered, but do not insult me, I really hate to \nget rid of these. I have lots of other art work of the 47 ronin, by \nan artist Hisashi Otsuka. If you are familiar with his work, we \ncould talk.\nMy email is terryw98241@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"
