The historian &quot;expert&quot; was \nStephen \n&gt; Turnbull and the &quot;Ninja Master expert&quot; was Stephen Hayes.  I would \nlike to \n&gt; know what everyone thought of it.  Personally, it hurt me inside.\n\n\nDidn&#39;t see it, I may have in the past but can&#39;t remember. But why did \nit hurt you on the inside, was there something you didn&#39;t agree on?\n\n\n"
