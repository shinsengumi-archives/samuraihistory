You will receive a confirmation email that your submission has been rece=\r\nived. A maximum of two stories per author are acceptable. \n\nJudging and Win=\r\nning the contest: \n\nSubmissions will be judged by a panel of Yahoo Group an=\r\nd/or Samurai Citadel community members who are not submitting stories. The =\r\njudges will not be told who the authors of each respective submision are un=\r\ntil after the judging has closed, to avoid any swaying of the judges. The r=\r\necipient of the submissions (The Samurai Archives webmaster) will not be a =\r\njudge, and will only moderate the proceedings, to keep entries anonymous. T=\r\nhe winning story will be featured on the Samurai Archives site as the winne=\r\nr of the 2011 Samurai Fiction contest. All stories will be placed in the &#39;F=\r\nan Fiction&#39; section of the Samurai Archives as well.
