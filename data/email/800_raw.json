The process in painting these\nis to have a &quot;period expert&quot; paint a master which is then replicated by the\nchinese master painter and sent to outworkers in China to produce commercial\nfigures. The original castings, particularly the generals if you are able to\nget hold of them, are of an excellent detail and compare well with other\n(sometimes more expensive) 54mm figures. I wish that I could get hold of\nmore unpainted castings. If you haven&#39;t already done so have a look at the\nartillery units - great fun!!\n\n                                                            Rod Johnson\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Anthony J.

It really does.  It is basically a site\n&gt; &gt; selling minatures of the samurai in 54mm scale, this in itself may be\n&gt; &gt; interesting to some, but it is the detail and depth that the\n&gt; &gt; minatures go to that makes it so good.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mwa ha ha!!\n&gt;\n&gt; I love it. Take a look at the first graphic on\n&gt; http://www.eastofindia.com/spring2001_1.htm and then plate J-K in my first\n&gt; book (&quot;The Samurai&quot;). I wonder where they get their inspiration... &lt;G&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Right down to the poses...\n&gt;\n&gt; I gotta tell you, though. That level of detail is what I&#39;d expect in a\n24mm.\n&gt; Not a 54.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
