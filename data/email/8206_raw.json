As a moderator, it&#39;s sometimes\nfrustrating when people come on here and ask\nopen-ended, general questions without doing any\nresearch, like &quot;Can someone tell me everything about\nthe Samurai???????&quot; \n\nObviously yours is not a case like this--have no fear,\nthere will be no smiting. It&#39;s much more\nunderstandable that you can&#39;t find many sources if\nyou&#39;re looking for a specific fire (1861). When people\nask general questions (Tell me about fires in Edo!)\nand say they can&#39;t find anything, I tend to do a quick\ngoogle search to see what comes up. In this case, I\nfound quite a bit about fires in Edo, most referencing\nthe 1657 fire. Your mention of a timeline, as opposed\nto a specific time, indicated to me you didn&#39;t know\nwhat year you were looking for. Since I found several\npages of hits in less than 2 minutes, it made me doubt\nhow hard you actually looked. Looking for specific\ninformation about the fire in 1861, I can see how the\npages that came up (most of the Wiki variety) didn&#39;t\nhelp at all, and you&#39;d turn here for more specifics. \n\nMost of the regulars (and you&#39;ve been here a while, so\nyou probably are familiar with the problem) will tell\nyou that we often get people here who have spent a\ntotal of 30 seconds online, haven&#39;t found the answer\nto whatever question they have, and ask here when if\nthey&#39;d invested 5 minutes with a decent search engine,\nthey could find it. Again, I&#39;m glad we are not dealing\nwith that--I&#39;ll poke around some more and see what I\ncan find for you, though. Will Japanese\nsources/webpages work for you? \n\nNate\n\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Nate:\n&gt;   I feel bad that my question annoyed you or anyone\n&gt; else. I guess I assumed if I mentioned timeline it\n&gt; would be enough to mean the entire history of the\n&gt; Yoshiwara fires in Tokyo since there was more than\n&gt; one in the entire history of the Yoshiwara since its\n&gt; creation in the seventeenth century. But again let\n&gt; me apologize and assure that in the future I will be\n&gt; more specific and not allow myself to assume\n&gt; anything when it pertains to an inquiry. Thank you\n&gt; anyway for your help in this matter. Everybody have\n&gt; a great day.\n&gt;   Rod\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   Rod--\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but there&#39;s quite a\n&gt; difference between &quot;Give me info about fires in Edo\n&gt; and the Yoshiwara&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m specifically interested\n&gt; in\n&gt; the fire of 1861&quot;. It helps unbelievably to be\n&gt; specific in what your question is. I was mildly\n&gt; annoyed that you said you&#39;d looked and couldn&#39;t find\n&gt; anything, when a simple Google search came up with a\n&gt; ton of sites (admittedly, mostly scanty info like\n&gt; Wikipedia, but still). However, if you&#39;re looking\n&gt; for\n&gt; a specific fire at a specific date, that changes\n&gt; things quite a bit. \n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck, not sure I&#39;ve got anything that can help\n&gt; you with your specific question. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Nate:\n&gt; &gt;   First of all let me thank you for your answer\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; I think I should have been more specific about my\n&gt; &gt; question regarding the fires of the Yoshiwara. Yes\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; am aware of the great fire of 1657 I have found\n&gt; &gt; information on that part of the history but there\n&gt; &gt; were also fires during the late nineteenth century\n&gt; &gt; one of them I believe occured in the year 1861.\n&gt; You\n&gt; &gt; see it has much harder finding that sort of\n&gt; &gt; information but if you Nate or anyone else has or\n&gt; &gt; knows of where I can find that information I would\n&gt; &gt; be most grateful.\n&gt; &gt;   Rod\n&gt; &gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Rod Pavez &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello everyone:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not long ago I posted a question about the fires\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Yoshiwara or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pleasure quarter of the city of Tokyo. I really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to know if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone has information regarding the historical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; timeline of those \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fires. If anyone does please I&#39;d really like to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know. I&#39;ve searched and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; searched but to no avail. Thank you all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rod\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Edo Taika (Great Fire of Edo) took place in\n&gt; &gt; 1657,\n&gt; &gt; and gutted the Yoshiwara.
