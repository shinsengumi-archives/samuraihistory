The\nmost familiar to English-speaking audiences is CHUSHINGURA, directed by\nInagaki. There are several others available on DVD from the &quot;fan-subbers&quot;\nwho have managed to get prints and been able to sub-title them. Being very\ninterested in the 47 Ronin event, I&#39;ve collected quite a few of these.\n \nThe problem with most of the 47 Ronin films is the mythology in them. In\nmost of these films, the local Edo samurai and townspeople are shown to be\nquite knowledgeable of the revenge and its planning, almost as if they have\nformed &quot;Ako Ronin Fan Clubs&quot; to cheer them on. It seems, according to the\nfilms, that everyone and his brother and sister throughout Japan just KNOW\nexactly what the Ako ronin are planning. The problem with these sorts of\ndepictions is that, if all these folks in Edo knew exactly what was going\non, wouldn&#39;t Kira and his associates also know? And thus they would have\nbeen able to easily thwart the revenge plans. \n \nIn fact, the planning and execution of the Ako ronin&#39;s revenge was carried\non in great secrecy. It was the only way that a sorely out-numbered handful\nof ex-Ako retainers could achieve what they wanted to achieve. So they\ndeliberately set out on a course of action to make it appear that the LAST\nthing on their minds would be a revenge. Oishi Kuranosuke was known to have\nengaged in an extended pretense of dissipation, divorcing his wife and\ngetting drunk and disorderly at various Kyoto teahouses. The idea was to\nlull Kira and his allies into thinking that the Ako ronin were a bunch of\nne&#39;er do-wells who had no intention of avenging their lord. That way, they\ncould have the element of surprise on their side to successfully carry out\ntheir attack. \n \nNina\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of bellaireroad\nSent: Wednesday, August 31, 2005 8:06 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies\n\n\n\nThanks,\nI have to agree on &quot;Hara Kiri&quot;  I just saw this the other night...the\nCriterion version....great storyline, acting, and fantastic ending. \nI&#39;m somewhat an armor fan, and Kagemusha was great eye candy...also\nreally liked the hidden fortress...no one seems to have mentioned it\nso far...\n\nI&#39;m kind of suprised there is not an epic film based on the 47 Ronin,\nespecially since this event is so steeped in Samurai tradition and honor.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@s...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Hello everyone, coming out of lurk-dom. I just joined the email\ngroup though\n&gt; I&#39;ve been posting on the Delphi message board under the tag line\n&gt; &quot;Nevermore...&quot; (which is a NFL football reference, as I participate\nin some\n&gt; other Delphi forums and we discuss football. But needless to say, I\nwon&#39;t\n&gt; discuss football here). I also participate (I&#39;m a moderator) in the\nNinja\n&gt; Dojo Samurai Film message board on EZBoard and there, I&#39;m known as &quot;Wave\n&gt; Tossed&quot; (which I use for Amazon.com book and movie reviews and IMDB\nmovie\n&gt; reviews). Email me if you want more information on the Ninja Dojo site.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So just a little introduction: My name is Nina Boal, I&#39;m female,\nAmerican\n&gt; (live in the Baltimore, Maryland region), in my late fifties. I became\n&gt; interested in Japanese history many years ago when I was studying\nkendo. I\n&gt; studied kendo for around ten years, achieving the rank of shodan. A\nsevere\n&gt; back injury has taken me out of kendo study. Now I have severe\narthritis of\n&gt; the knees and am wondering if I could ever take up the study of iaido at\n&gt; this late stage, even with crippled knees. I do participate in swimming\n&gt; exercise and physical therapy to try and make my knees stronger but\nI still\n&gt; cannot sit in the seiza position because of my knees. \n&gt;  \n&gt; In the meantime, I became a fan of Japanese cinema, particularly period\n&gt; dramas, jidai-geki and chambara films. The swordfighting in chambara\nfilms\n&gt; is not usually related to real kenjutsu or kendo; one of my kendo\nsenseis\n&gt; used to admonish his students by telling us, &quot;that&#39;s not kendo, that&#39;s\n&gt; chambara!!&quot; Still, I like watching these films. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Which have inspired me to begin writing period pieces. I started out\nwriting\n&gt; in fantasy/science fiction and have had several short stories\npublished in\n&gt; anthologies that have been available on the mass market. But my\ndirection in\n&gt; writing has shifted to writing historical pieces, particularly about\n&gt; Japanese samurai. One of my efforts is &quot;Stray Dogs,&quot; which you can\nread on\n&gt; the Samurai Archives web site. It won the First Samurai Fiction\nShort Story\n&gt; contest. It is about a man whom I&#39;ve been interested in for years, Fuwa\n&gt; Kazuemon, one of the Forty Seven Ronin. I&#39;m currently working on a novel\n&gt; involving completely fictional characters that takes place in 18th\ncentury\n&gt; Japan. \n&gt;  \n&gt; So, finally to get to the topic here. I&#39;m a huge film buff. So here\nare my\n&gt; Top Ten Samurai Movies. The order is not static, though SEPPUKU (&quot;Hara\n&gt; Kiri&quot;) always remains on the top:\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. Seppuku (aka &quot;Hara Kiri&quot;): The best movie made, period, on any\nsubject\n&gt; from any country. Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshiro) and Ishihama (Chijiiwa\nMotome)\n&gt; were both stunning, as was Tamba (Onodaka Hikokuro) playing a real\n&gt; slimeball. A study of false &quot;bushido&quot; versus the real way of the\nwarrior. A\n&gt; film made in 1962 about some 17th century Japanese people, and we&#39;re\nstill\n&gt; avidly discussing it in 2005 all over the world. Illustrates the staying\n&gt; power of a true classic.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. The Seven Samurai: Another real classic and deservedly so. The first\n&gt; samurai film I had ever seen. \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. The Last Samurai directed by Misumi, not the one by Zwick with\nCruise in\n&gt; it (don&#39;t get me started on that one... ) A truly epic film that\ncaptures\n&gt; the end of the feudal era and the beginning of a more modern era in\nJapan. \n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Three Outlaw Samurai: I believe that this was Gosha&#39;s first film.\nThis\n&gt; time, Tamba Tetsuro plays the oppressed good guy who comes to the aid of\n&gt; those even more oppressed than he is. \n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Tange Sazen: I&#39;m just listing the character&#39;s name because all of the\n&gt; versions I&#39;ve seen of this tale are tied for this position: Gosha&#39;s two\n&gt; films (with Yorozuya Kinnosuke and also with Nakadai Tatsuya), the older\n&gt; films with Otomo Ryutaro plus another with Tamba Tetsuro; and the\nnew one\n&gt; with Toyokawa: all are quality films about this fascinating one-eyed,\n&gt; one-armed swordsman.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Goyokin: Nakadai again, playing a man haunted by his role in the\n&gt; slaughter of a fishing village, and how he makes amends for what he\nhas done\n&gt; as he saves another fishing village from slaughter.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. Samurai Wolf: Natsuyagi Isao is great as a scroungy, hungry ronin\nnamed\n&gt; Kiba Okaminosuke (&quot;Fangs of the Wolf&quot;) who comes into town working\nfor food.\n&gt; He wants to be a fierce &quot;wolf&quot; but in many ways, is more like a sweet,\n&gt; wistful puppy dog. Though he does wield a really mean sword.\nNatsuyagi also\n&gt; plays Fuwa Kazuemon in the TV special DAI CHUSHINGURA and does an\nexcellent\n&gt; job there as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; 8. Shogun&#39;s Samurai: The Yagyu Conspiracy: Grand tragedy with a big\ncast of\n&gt; stellar performers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tied for ninth/tenth place:\n&gt; Hidden Blade: A recent film about a man who must decide between\nloyalty and\n&gt; doing the right thing according to his beliefs. \n&gt; After The Rain: A ronin and his wife find that there are more important\n&gt; things than fame or position. \n&gt; Twilight Samurai: Sanada is magnificent as a low-ranked, impoverished\n&gt; samurai (who is an excellent swordsman) who must deal with raising his\n&gt; family as a single parent, and also must deal with a difficult task\ngiven to\n&gt; him by his lord. \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n[mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of bellaireroad\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 30, 2005 12:58 AM\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Top Ten Samurai Movies\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s your pick 1-10?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&gt; \n&gt; &lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com &lt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt; \n&gt; &lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&lt;http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives&gt; &gt; \n&gt; --- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; YAHOO!
