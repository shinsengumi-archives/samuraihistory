If someone puts forth a set of criteria and an\nargument as to why Musashi were to best fit that\ncriteria for GSE(tm), then we&#39;d have an intelligent\ndiscussion going on. The problem is that it&#39;s\nimpossible to define GSE(tm) whatsoever.\nUnfortunatlely, the fanboy crowd has this perception\ngained from hollywood/games/etc. that is fed by the\nBushido mystique and Edo-period concepts of, as\nTurnbull said, the &quot;Lone Samurai&quot;, heavy on martial\narts and philosophical ideals that were codified in\nthe mid/late Edo period. Sadly, this neglects almost\n600 years of samurai history. (If you take 1000 as a\nbase, 1877 as the end, that&#39;s almost 900 years. 600\nyears would be 2/3 of the history of the samurai, when\n99% of the development, wars, etc. took place, and\nwe&#39;re just going to IGNORE IT? Insanity.)\n\nUsing superlatives is always dangerous. It&#39;s hard\nenough to define someone like Michael Jordan as the\nbest basketball player ever, and most people will\nagree with you. It&#39;s infinitely harder to say that X\nwas the GSE(tm), especially when you don&#39;t explain\nyour reasoning and criteria. \n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
