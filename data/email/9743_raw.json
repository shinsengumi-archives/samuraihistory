Very good. at least now we have someone who \nwrites th=\r\ne real stuff about Zen. Zen is derived from the teravada \nbuddhism. Just li=\r\nke the tibetan buddhism, chinese/japanese \nbuddhism.After buddhism came to =\r\ntheir countries, it mixed with their \nculture. That is why i always encoura=\r\nge people to learn from the \noriginal. The root of all. besides the teravad=\r\na buddhism(original), \nall are called/catogorised under the Mahayana. Some =\r\nhave lost the \nessense of the Buddha&#39;s teaching.  \n\n           The story is=\r\n long. Just know that Zen is a type of \nbuddhism. Like all types of buddhis=\r\nm. There is no god. So it is not \nright to say that Zen is a religion. Like=\r\n all Budhism, the mind is \nutmost important. Yoga practisioner, Kung Fu mas=\r\nters, martial \natists.....blah blah blah.....etc are practicing Samatha med=\r\nitation. \nOnly buddhist do Vipasana meditation. \n\n\n\n&quot;The religion of the fu=\r\nture will be a cosmic religion. The religion \nwhich based on experience, wh=\r\nich refuses dogmatic. If there&#39;s any \nreligion that would cope the scientif=\r\nic needs it will be Buddhism.&quot;-\nAlbert Einstein \n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;Scott&quot; &lt;scottc_4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I apologize to other memb=\r\ners of this list for not letting go of \nthis. \n&gt; This group is probably not=\r\n the proper place for is. That being said \n&gt; though I have to mention some =\r\nof the faluts in the arguement \npresented \n&gt; agasint Zen as a religion. The=\r\nre are teachings. A follower of \n&gt; religious Zen takes part in such rituals=\r\n as the Boddhisatva vow and \n&gt; seeking refuge in the three jewels. There ar=\r\ne books. Just to list a \n&gt; few: Shobogenzo, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Pat=\r\nriarch, Perfection \nof \n&gt; Wisdom is also used sometimes, some times even th=\r\ne Lotus Sutra. I \nwill \n&gt; ignore the argument about gods because that is co=\r\nmplex and I want \nto \n&gt; keep this short, other than saying you are correct =\r\nthat generally \ngods \n&gt; are not represented. If you have the 27 years of ex=\r\nperience you \nclaim \n&gt; to have, I would think you would have heard of at le=\r\nast a few books \n&gt; written by Chinese and Japanese Zen masters. Such master=\r\ns also do \n&gt; write about past and future lifetimes and karma and duhka and =\r\n\nsamsara \n&gt; and many other core Buddhist concepts. One thing Zen strongly \n=\r\nrejects \n&gt; that is often common in Chinese/Japanese Buddhism is the comcept=\r\n of \n&gt; mappo.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
