Some are Aluminium and some are steel, i&#39;ll talk about \nshapening in a moment. Either way the blade should be taken out of \nit&#39;s funishings every once in a while for a whole cleaning though \nmostly leave it as is and do the blade. As to blade care, it should \nbe rubbed clean with silk or someother non marking cloth before being \noiled.This will remove any old oil or bits of dirt, dust ect. I know \nyou can buy various cleaning kits( i don&#39;t remember at the moment \nwhich is the best oil, though likely rice oil or some such thing.\n\nAfter figuring out what type of metal the blade is then you can think \nabout sharpening. Aluminium you SOULD NOT SHARPEN as it will ruin the \nblade and cause it to rust very quickly. As for steel if you intened \nto use it in any sort of combat or otherwise you should get someone \nto professionaly sharpen it. \n\nBut maybe you should check with your friend see what they think, some \nfeel it to be a dishonor to sharpen something that came unsharpend. \nIt&#39;s likely that they could not have even gotten it to you if it was \nsharpend, laws about that are very strict and every nihon has to be \nregistered anyway.\n\nI hope that helps\n\nPeace and Wisdom\n\n\nAtsi \n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
