Gives\na view of the losing side.\n\nFor novels try Shiba Ryotaro. he is Japans most popular historical writer.\nTwo books set in the bakumatsu period have been translated into English,\n`The Last Shogun`and `Drunk as a lord`.\n\nYou might already be familiar with the works of Totman, Beasley, Huber,\nStatler, Akamatsu, Harootunian, Busch, Miyoshi, Barr, Williams.\n\nAs for places to visit, well I live here in Osaka so I can recommend places\nin Kansai. There is a Bakumatsu museum in Kyoto called Reizan Rekishikan. In\nOsaka there is a new Prefecture Historical Museum. There are so many\npreserved houses and buildings its hard to include them all, but there is\none newly reconstructed samurai house from the edo period near my home in\nNeyagawa.\n\nAs for people, there is a man here in Osaka, not an historian but a gude\ninterpreter with a good knowledge of local history. he organizes tours of\nthe area. His name is Paul Satoh, and his address is 3-6 Kori-Moto Machi\nNeyagawa City 572-0083 Osaka Japan. He might not be available for personal\ntours though. If not I could show you around. I have been here 8 years and\nknow my way around esp Kyoto, I go there almost twice month. If you are\ninterested let me know.\n\n\n"
