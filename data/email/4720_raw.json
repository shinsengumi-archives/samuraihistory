A sort of Japanese Jeanne D&#39;Arc? The answer is \nnegative, so far as I know. It would be difficult to imagine, given \nJapanese gender conventions in the medieval and early modern \nperiods, but might have been conceivable in earlier periods when \nwomen had higher and more independent status and the boundaries of \nthe samurai class were quite elastic.\n\n--\n\nWhile there isn&#39;t a huge amount of material that can corroborate the \nstories told about her deeds, what about Tomoe Gozen?\n\n\n"
