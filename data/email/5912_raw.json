I might sound stupid, but, i never even \n&gt;    thought of going to a museum to see armor. That&#39;s a great idea!!! \n\nDon&#39;t feel too bad about that one, most of us at one time or another had\nno idea that museums could be that helpful:-)\n\n&gt;    Again, thanks a lot for all of the advice. I&#39;ll post some pics up \n&gt;    as i go along. Hope to hear some good replies about it. Thank you.\n\nNo problem, good luck, and most importantly of all, have fun!\n\n&gt;    Greatfully yours,\n&gt;                                                                  Mark\n&gt;\n&gt;    P.S.- do you guys ever go to any of the SCA events? I live in \n&gt;    Buffalo N.Y. so if you go to any in Rochester N.Y. or most other \n&gt;    cities in N.Y.,i might see ya there.\n\nSorry Mark, like Paul I&#39;m in the UK and I&#39;ve never seen the SCA in\naction, although I have bumped in to one or two of the local membership\nover the years. I run a tiny Japanese re-enactment group under the title\nof &quot;Shogun&quot;, using my own fighting system which I&#39;ve been teaching for\nsome twenty years or so now. Plus I run other events, so time is not\nwhat I&#39;ve got, so unless you ever get over here, we&#39;ll have to settle\nfor meeting here on this wonderful list.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
