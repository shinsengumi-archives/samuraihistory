Where is the Byodo-in, in \nrelation to the Uji bridge and the box representing Nara shown on the \nmap? Does anybody have a more detailed map of the region with the \nplaces marked and the topography?\n\n3) Turnbull states that the Minamoto forces at the battle numbered \n300. Does anybody know the composition of these forces? He does \nmention that some were monks. How many?\n\n4) Turnball states that at the time of this battle the Taira were \nraising an army of 20,000. How many fought at the Battle of Uji and \nwhat was the composition of those troops?\n\nWhile I like the book and his writing style I do think that it lacks \nthe detail of a true military study. Any help with the above \nquestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNow for a couple of technical questions:\n\n1)\tWhat was the average range for archers of the time? Turnbull \nstates 350 yards. Then in the chapter covering the Mongol invasions \nhe states that due to the period of relative peace between the Mongol \ninvasions and the Gempei War that this range had degraded and that \narchers from Kyushu did not have the skill or range than archers from \nthe east.\n\nCan anybody shed any light on this?\n\nWell enough for now. Back to the book.\n\nCheers\nBill M.\nhttp://www.russojapanesewar.com\n\n\n"
