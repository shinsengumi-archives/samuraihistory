This points up the value of this list, firstly, with the learned scholars generously giving of their knowledge, and secondly to realise that most English references are not to be relied upon for accuracy.  Is there any recent equivqlent publication in English that updates Papinot???\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Kitsuno \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, May 19, 2007 5:13 AM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Death of Nobuhide?\n\n\n  --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Papinot says 1549, which date you already have, and beyond that I\n  know nothing more.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n\n  This would be another example (unfortunately) of Papinot being wrong.\n  The Shinchokoki (A contemporary record of the life of Oda Nobunaga\n  and a primary source) has Nobuhide&#39;s death the third month, third day\n  of Tenbun 20, which was 1551. The Sengoku Jinmei Jiten also has 1551.\n  Papinot&#39;s book is good, but is dated and does have a lot of errors.\n  .._,___ \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
