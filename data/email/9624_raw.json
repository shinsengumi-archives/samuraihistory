Marchionni\nwww.maximom.com.ar\nMaximo@...\n\nKeigen-Shinto period (1596 - 1623)\nKeigen is a name of an era in Shinto time made by mixing the initial part of\nthe eras Keicho and Genna. Swords made during these eras, Keicho and Genna,\nare called Keigen-Shinto. In this period a lot of Tachi made in the\nNanbokucho period were shortened to adjust the size at about 70cm in order\nto wear them in the waist as requested by the new fighting style (and\nfashion). Mihaba near the Kissaki and near Nakago is almost same size and\nKissaki is O-Kissaki. This shape became to be popular, but the difference\nbetween Nanbokucho blades and Keigen-Shinto is Kasane. Kasane in now is\nthick. These shape will appear again in the end of Edo Era The influence of\nthe European culture increased with the increasing of commercial exchanges.\nGoods where excanged between Europe and Japan in this period and european\niron was imported, too. The japanese name for this iron is Nanban-Tetsu,\n&quot;steel of the Southern Barbarians&quot;. Smiths begun to proudly sign on the tang\nof their creatures &quot;made with NanbanTetsu&quot; because european items were\nreally fashinating japanese people, but Kokan Nagayama quotes in his &quot;Token\nKantei Dokuhon&quot; that such a steel wasn&#39;t better then Tamahagane for making\nNihonTo due to the impurities in it, especially phosporus. This foreign\nsteel is brigter then the japanese one and soon the fashion went out.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
