However, I think it is most commonly believed that he died at Honnoji. Whether he committed seppuku or died from an arrow, or perished in the fire, I guess we have no way of knowing. There are several Japanese sites and articles related to different theories on this matter (from why Mitsuhide did it to what actually happened to Nobunaga). \n\nIn a related matter... Can anyone tell me the exact location of the original Honnoji? I have been to the re-built site on several occassions, but it would be nice to see the landscape of where the original actually rested.\n\nJonathan P.
