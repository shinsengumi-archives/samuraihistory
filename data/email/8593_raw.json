Medieval Japanese armies were feudal. In general, and Japanese \nfeudal armies are not an exception, medieval military units are \ngenerally known by their unit commanders. You can see this sort of \nthing in the Sekigahara Kasen book which you can purchase at the \nSekigahara museum. The battle formations are given in terms of their \ncommanders and troop strengths. Similarly you will find lists of \nmilitary leaders in terms of troop strengths and incomes. Military men \ncould hold a variety of rank bearing offices from a variety of sources \nincluding: the imperial court, the kuge families, the bakufu, and at \nleast later on through the military households. Not to mention those \nwho were employed by religious institutions.\n\n&gt;  There&#39;s no denying that the chef outranks a busboy.\n&gt;  But neither chef nor busboy are ranks.\n\nThe word &quot;chef&quot;is etymologically related to &quot;chief&quot; and derives from \nthe word for &quot;head&quot;. It really is a kind of rank. It is also a job.\n\n&gt;  A taicho (lit. &quot;group-chief&quot;) can have five people or 50\n\nSounds like a bit of wandering there. \u001b$BBbD9\u001b(B taichou is the leader of a \nmilitary formation called a \u001b$BBb\u001b(B TAI. It is also a modern word.\n\n&gt;  In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and  duties are held \n&gt; at the pleasure of the overlord in question.\n\nNot quite so simple. A medieval unit commander can &quot;own&quot; his unit and \nowe service to his overlord. Medieval commanders did not have quite the \npersonnel reassignment capability as that of a modern army. Regardless, \nwhat was going on in Japan can be quite complex having to do with shiki \nrights, parallel rank and appointment systems, and all sorts of other \nstuff.\n\n\n"
