Was there any elder brothers\n&gt; that died in the insurrection/disturbance?\n\nYoshitsune was the ninth son.\n\nEldest was Yoshihira, then Tomonaga, then Yoritomo, Yoshidako, Mareyoshi,\nNoriyori, Zenjou, Gien, and Yoshitsune. There were also two daughters.\n\nYoshihira (1140-60). Executed after the Heiji insurrection.\nTomonaga (1144-1160). Killed by his father after the Heiji insurrection\nrather than be left behind.\nYoritomo -- nuff said. &lt;G&gt;\nYoshikado (?) Died young (early teens?) after appointment as lieutenant of\nthe Left Palace Guard.\nMareyoshi (?-1182) As yet a noncombatant, he was murdered in Tosa by Heike\nloyalists.\nNoriyori (1156-1193). Executed on Yoritomo&#39;s orders.\nZenjou  (ne Imamaru, 1160-after 1180) Took Buddhist orders, supported\nYoritomo during the Genpei War.\nGien (ne Yoshimaru, 1160-1187).\nYoshitsune -- nuff said.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also - in my readings i have found that it states that yoshitsune and\n&gt; yoritomo are half brothers. Is this fact? If so - does this make\n&gt; Noriyori Yoshitsunes half brother also?\n\nUnfortunately, the genealogical chart I have on hand doesn&#39;t say who was\nmother to which. I&#39;m not sure off the top of my head if Noriyoshi was\nYoshitsune&#39;s full brother or half, or Yoritomo&#39;s.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
