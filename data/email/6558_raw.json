Ostensibly,\n Each side learned\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; the other--Hideyoshi learned that any attempt to\n&gt; move\n&gt; &gt; against Ieyasu would be difficult at best, and\n&gt; he&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; lost a lot of time and men doing it. Ieyasu\n&gt; learned\n&gt; &gt; that he could hold off Hideyoshi for a long time,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; if push came to shove he&#39;d eventually lose. So the\n&gt; &gt; campaign was essentially a draw. Tactical victory\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; Ieyasu, strategic victory for Hideyoshi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bingo. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\nI pride myself on accuracy...usually I don&#39;t have too\nmuch to be proud about...\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
