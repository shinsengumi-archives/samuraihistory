I \ndon&#39;t have any dates for the births or deaths of the sister or \nToshitada, and the only reference I can find to him was the fact \nthat he was the father of Saito Toshimitsu and married to Akechi \nMitsuhide&#39;s younger sister.  My Sengoku Samurai biographical \ndictionary only lists him as Saito Toshimitsu&#39;s father.  The Rekishi \nGunzo book on Akechi Mitsuhide has info on him in the Chosokabe \nsection, but I don&#39;t actually own that book, I just took some quick \nnotes out of it with my palm pilot at the Japanese bookstore (so if \nanyone has it, take a look for me).  I&#39;m sure he is related to Saito \nDosan, but just not sure how, probably a son, but not sure. \n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt; When did this marriage occur and how old was the bride?
