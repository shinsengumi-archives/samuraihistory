The purpose of the advertising \ncampaigns are to get peopel to join.  You may be right that they \naren&#39;t completly seperate.  While they may also convince others that \nthe military is a good thing that is not their primary purpose.  What \nreally justifies the military is the contingencies we are involved \nin, the honorable behavior of the men and women who serve, and the \nfamily members/friends who support the U.S. citizen soldiers in \nservice.  I don&#39;t believe that congress has ever voted the military a \npayraise because some constituant wrote their congress person, who \nwas so completely moved by a commercial.  &quot;Dog gonnit, that Army of \none thing is pretty snappy.  The military needs more money.  I&#39;m \nwriting my congressman.&quot;  Supporters of the military have been: those \nwho have served themselves, those who have family or friends serving, \nor those who wish they could have served.\n\nNow don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not attacking YOU.  You have valid points \nand I did agree that early Japan may have attempted to justify the \nsamurai class by changing their role.  You are entitled to an \nopinion.  In this case, I think I may be closer to the issue and may \nbe more informed.  I have not based what I told you purely on \nspeculation.  I know how some of the money is budgeted and why they \nuse it a certain way.  Any communication may serve multiple purposes \nbut not all those purposes were the driving factor for creating the \ncommunication.  You believe that the military advertises to get more \nmoney.  It doesn&#39;t hurt my feelings that you think that.  In some \nround about way, the military may get more money.  But the purpose of \nthose advertising campaigns is to recruit.  I don&#39;t know if it could \nbe more obvious, since the end of those commercials tell you to \ncontact a recruiter not a congress person.\n\nBack to the topic.  Samurai didn&#39;t have to worry about advertising \ncampaigns and raising money from the public.  They were in the \nsamurai class.  They didn&#39;t need more people in it and they didn&#39;t \nrequire the support of the general public to get paid.\n\nBrandon\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, golfmandan@a... wrote:\n&gt; Brandon, I don&#39;t know what your motivation is in disagreeing with \nme. I think I&#39;ve only stated the obvious. It&#39;s not like I made any \ngiant assuming leaps. First of all, I said &quot;kinda like&quot;... not \nEXACTLY like. Second of all, YES the military advertises itself to \nbuild up its image so it can maintain its numbers AND get more money \nfrom Congress. It&#39;s not like the two things are completely separate. \nThird, as for there &quot;always&quot; being a need for military... I never \nsaid there wasn&#39;t. But the need is greater or lesser at any given \ntime when compared with other times, and certainly PERCEIVED to be \ngreater or lesser at any given time. In a time of &quot;perceived&quot; lesser \nneed, spending gets cut. \n&gt; \n&gt;  My point was just that without all the civil wars to fight, the \nrole of the samurai changed. \n&gt; &gt;  Kinda like for america, if we don&#39;t have any perceived military \n&gt; &gt; threats, we want to cut military spending. So what does the \nmilitary \n&gt; &gt; do? Come up with all the &quot;be all you can be&quot; and &quot;army of one&quot; \nand \n&gt; &gt; &quot;we&#39;re looking for a few good men&quot; advertising campaigns... which \n&gt; &gt; glorifies the military in the public&#39;s eye, and gives it a \npurpose \n&gt; &gt; apart from war... namely the bettering of our citizens by \neducation \n&gt; &gt; and experience. Bushido made samurai out to be &quot;honorable \ncitizens&quot; \n&gt; &gt; or something to that effect...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have to disagree with you here.  The military does not come up \nwith \n&gt; &gt; advertising campaigns to glorify the military in the public&#39;s \neye.  \n&gt; &gt; How does spending more of the military budget on advertising give \nthe \n&gt; &gt; military any more money.  A portion of the budget is allotted to \n&gt; &gt; recruit and retain personnel through these campaigns.  This was \nan \n&gt; &gt; important issue about 5 years ago.  The military branches were \nall \n&gt; &gt; significantly under mandated strength numbers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you want to cut military spending (or more aptly if congress \nwants \n&gt; &gt; to do so) there isn&#39;t much the military can do about it.  \nCongress \n&gt; &gt; makes laws about force budgets and limitaions on force strength \n(the \n&gt; &gt; number of personnel in each branch).  Perception is an important \n&gt; &gt; issue and some people do percieve that we aren&#39;t in need of a \n&gt; &gt; military.  Perceptions are not always the truth.  Your perception \nand \n&gt; &gt; my perception may be completely different.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Relating back to the samurai, there is always a need for military \n&gt; &gt; power.  In the samurai days it may have been for civil obedience \n&gt; &gt; outside the existance of a war.  As for America&#39;s military, I&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; challenge you to name a period in recent history that they \nweren&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; invovled in some conflict.  U.S. forces have been reduced by more \n&gt; &gt; than half.  The military performs the same job with less people. \nThe  \n&gt; &gt; military also serves the purpose of civil protection, aid natural \n&gt; &gt; disaster victims, and any other emergency of national or local \n&gt; &gt; importance. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  The U.S. military is very different from the samurai.  Japan was \n&gt; &gt; isolated from most of the world.  By their own choice and because \nof \n&gt; &gt; geography.  The U.S. military deals with global issues.  A \nmilitary \n&gt; &gt; dealing only with its own country&#39;s problems has different \ndemands. \n&gt; &gt; In which case your second assertion may bear some truth.  Only \nsome \n&gt; &gt; truth becuase I believe the samurai were in a postion like many \n&gt; &gt; dictatorships in the world.  They possessed the frightening might \nor \n&gt; &gt; the military and didn&#39;t require justifying themselves to the \n&gt; &gt; population they ruled.  If the peasants didn&#39;t like it; what \nwould \n&gt; &gt; they do about it?  They odd situation with Japan is that they had \n2 \n&gt; &gt; positions of power.  Shogun and Emperor.  Periods existed when \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Emperor possessed all the power and there were times when the \nEmperor \n&gt; &gt; was only a puppet.  The peasants were&#39;nt the only ones who didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; like the system.  The Emperor didn&#39;t and he did something about \nit.  \n&gt; &gt; No matter how the samurai class may have been &quot;justified&quot; the \nEmperor \n&gt; &gt; decided that the weren&#39;t needed and that a new military needed to \nbe \n&gt; &gt; formed to progress the nation into modern times.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Important to note that he still thought a military was important \njust \n&gt; &gt; not the one they had.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Brandon\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; --- \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
