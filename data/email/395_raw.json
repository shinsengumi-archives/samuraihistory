They shaved their heads, or wore fanciful \nhairstyles, or just let their hair flow loose, and they wore \nover-long swords with bright red saya and frequently were the \ncause of street fights.\n\nSo the seasoned old samurai sees one of these hotheads coming \ntowards him, the distinctive red saya sticking out a mile! As \nthey are about to pass on the saya side, the old man, who&#39;s \nleft hand has been resting easily on top of the saya, grips, \ntwists his knuckles outward, and at the same time pulls his \nhand up towards his shoulder. This move ends with the sword \nparallel to the body, close to the side, and has two \nadvantages:\n\n1 - It avoided the saya clash (and thus a fight)\n2 - Some men carried saya that were designed to split. They \nwould brush passed and bump their victim, twisting the body and \nlevering the hilt as they did so. The saya would split and the \nblade would be in contact with their victim&#39;s waist as the \nassasin turned, and thus deliver a debilitating wound.\nIf this was the hothead&#39;s intention, the old man&#39;s own sword, \ncarried vertically from chest to knee alongside the body&#39;s \nedge, would act as a shield.\n\nEither way the hothead, tricked by the sudden defensive move, \nwould lose the initiative and the old man could cut him down at \nhis leisure (or walk away).\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n"
