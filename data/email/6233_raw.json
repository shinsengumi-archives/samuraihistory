There are some problems with having a list such as this\none which is so well-connected, such as when you misspell someone&#39;s name in\npassing and... you can see the results.  My apologies.  Regardless of the\nupdating needed, the articles I found to be quite excellent and interesting\nreading.  I&#39;m pleasantly surprised that you, Mr. Sinclaire (with an &quot;e,&quot; with\nan &quot;e&quot;) are here on the Samurai (with a &quot;u&quot; not an &quot;a&quot;) list. \n\nMatt\n--- Clive Sinclaire &lt;CSinclaire@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Gentlemen\n&gt; I think some of those articles could probably take some up-dating! However,\n&gt; the mass-produced blades (Showa-to) are easy enough to spot.

It also gave me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some insights on the folks who claim to have a &quot;Japanese Samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sword from World War Two.&quot;  According to Mr. Sinclair, 90% of Showa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; swords are, essentially, little more than mass-produced blades,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which is a pity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Matt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Davidson&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;tom.davidson@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Gabriel -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The toledo sword site looks a bit too commercial for my liking -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; marketing what &#39;looks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good&#39; and will sell, rather than what is correct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a one-time iaidoka, I am not enamoured of their products - by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the look of it there&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more wrong than there&#39;s right.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest searching for &#39;nihonto&#39; rather than &#39;samurai sword&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or &#39;katana&#39; or the like, at least\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you might get to a somewhat knowledgeable site.
