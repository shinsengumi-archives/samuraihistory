But, I would say\nthat the decision of whether or not taking offensive\nor withdraw must be &quot;independent of&quot; information on\nthe troop size obtained through recon.\n \nThe troop size is only one of factors that the field\nmarshall has to consider for her or his tactical\ndecision. But, it is not the only factor that will\ndetermine the success or the failure of any type of\ntactical decisions that would be made by the field\nmarshall.\n\nYes, historically or statistically, in most of\nbattles, the larger sized troop have been quoted as\nwinners over the smaller sized troops. But,also in\nmany of famous battles directed by those &#39;famous&#39;\ngenerals, you would find that they often had to fight\nagainst the more powerful or larger sized enemy\ntroops. I think that this is where we can distinguish\nbetween competent and incompetent field marshalls.\nRemember Nopoleon Bonaparte&#39;s 1805 Ulm-Austerlitz\ncampaign. Also Judah King Abijah&#39;s war againt Israel\nKing Jeroboam. (You will find plenty of such\nreferences if you try.)\n\nIn general, I would say that the field marshall must\ntry to avoid facing and fighting the larger sized\nenemy if possible because of there is more odds for\ndefeat. But, if his or her tactical decision\nforces(you will need more interpretation for this\nword) him or her to take offensive or defensive, then\nhe or she would need to excercise his or her ingenuity\nwith all efforts. That is why we train generals and\nofficers at the academy.\n\n\n--- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- westce@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It may be obvious from hindsight, however how\n&gt; &gt; effective were scouts and\n&gt; &gt; scouting methods in determining the number of\n&gt; &gt; opposition forces?  With no\n&gt; &gt; radios, no airplanes, or any other ways to take in\n&gt; &gt; the big picture, how\n&gt; &gt; would they know they are outnumbered?  Would they\n&gt; &gt; have a general idea of\n&gt; &gt; available troops based on who the opposing general\n&gt; &gt; was, or maybe count the\n&gt; &gt; standards and estimate?  I personally couldn&#39;t\n&gt; count\n&gt; &gt; 38,000 troops on my\n&gt; &gt; fingers ;) \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not an expert in samurai scouts. I&#39;ve only\n&gt; studied\n&gt; what has been written by others on how they employed\n&gt; them. But I DO know scouting. I served as a tank\n&gt; platoon leader in a division cavalry squadron, and\n&gt; worked extensively with cavalry scouts. I&#39;m now an\n&gt; intelligence officer and my job is to gather\n&gt; information about the enemy, using scouts to do so.\n&gt; Yeah, radios, UAV&#39;s, etc are great, but the\n&gt; principles\n&gt; of recon don&#39;t change. You&#39;d have strategic and\n&gt; operational recon (otherwise known as spies) and\n&gt; have\n&gt; an idea of what the opposing force had. Katsuyori\n&gt; had\n&gt; to know the available forces that Nobunaga and\n&gt; ieyasu\n&gt; had, and would make a guess as to how many of them\n&gt; he&#39;d have to face. \n&gt; \n&gt; Next you&#39;d have tactical scouts, what we think of as\n&gt; scouts. If I was surrounding an enemy emplacement,\n&gt; you&#39;d be darn skippy that I would not only focus on\n&gt; that. I&#39;d have scouts out in all directions, waiting\n&gt; to report on that reliving force I KNOW would\n&gt; probably\n&gt; be coming. You wouldn&#39;t have to count to 38,000,\n&gt; especially not with a Sengoku army. Look at the\n&gt; banners....yeah, that&#39;s hashiba&#39;s banner, and he has\n&gt; 8,000 men under him...I know that from my strategic\n&gt; recon. Okay, that&#39;s Sakakibara, and he has 1000. The\n&gt; banners made it easy, because not only could you get\n&gt; an idea of unit size, you knew who was in command.\n&gt; Nowadays I have to count vehicles, and maybe I&#39;ll\n&gt; get\n&gt; lucky and identify a certain type  of vehicle that\n&gt; is\n&gt; only in at a certain echelon, and I can determine\n&gt; the\n&gt; size. \n&gt; \n&gt; so in a battle such as Nagashino, at what\n&gt; &gt; point does one realize\n&gt; &gt; they are outnumbered? (not only that, but by the\n&gt; &gt; time you are close enough\n&gt; &gt; to count, you have to contend with bullets and\n&gt; &gt; arrows.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; c.w.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, you&#39;re not. You&#39;ve seen Kagemusha, I assume.\n&gt; Remember the scouts from Ieyasu and Nobunaga? The\n&gt; dingy little peasant spies and the monk? There you\n&gt; go...there is your HUMINT. They observe and report\n&gt; back...behind them, you have actual scouts, maybe\n&gt; your\n&gt; tsukai-ban or another group, mounted for\n&gt; speed...it&#39;s\n&gt; amazing how easy it is to sneak up on someone, even\n&gt; mounted...and get away unnoticed. If I can do it in\n&gt; a\n&gt; bradley fighting vehicle, he can do it on a horse. \n&gt; \n&gt; My point is this: Takeda Katusyori had to know full\n&gt; well how many men Nobunaga and Ieyasu had. He would\n&gt; have had an idea of the composition, ie weapons and\n&gt; the like. He would have known this all before 0500\n&gt; on\n&gt; the 28th of June when he launched his charge. He\n&gt; could\n&gt; have retreated the night of the 27th. And he should\n&gt; have, in my opinion. Yes, it&#39;s hindsight, but\n&gt; speaking\n&gt; as a military officer, you simply don&#39;t attack\n&gt; 38,000\n&gt; men when you have 15,000. Not unless they have\n&gt; spears\n&gt; and you have tanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; nate Ledbetter\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
