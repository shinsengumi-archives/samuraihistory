I must admit the way you at least worded your message did raise \nmany thoughts and ideas.  It certainly is an umm.. interesting \ncomcept you have there.  Far be it from me though to tell you how to \nlive your life.  However, I think the book LIVING THE MARTIAL WAY: A \nMANUAL FOR THE WAY A MODERN WARRIOR SHOULD THINK by Forrest Morgan \n(intended for martial artists, but aspects can be adapted by non-\nmartial artists) will be able to help you in fuguring out how to \nthink and act like a warrior in the modern times.  Remember do not \nfollow things you read blindly because a book says that it was how \nthe samurai acted.  In my personal opinion you should be more \nconcrened about living a life of honor rather then a samurai since it \nwould be (to say the least) nearly impossible unless you were to find \nsome unusual people in this world.  Read on samurai philosophy, and \nthen use your own mind to figure out what it means.  As was suggested \nyou might also want to read on Confucianism and Buddhism.  For \nBuddhism, look into mainly the Zen, Tendai, and Shingon schools \nbecause they had the biggest impact on the samurai.  And look into \nNeo-Confucianism since it evetually took the place of original \nConfucianism in East Asia.\n\n\n\n"
