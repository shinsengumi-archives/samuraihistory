I have to disagree.  There are all kinds\n&gt; of ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise movement\n&gt; or position.  This is simply not true.  The Samurai\n&gt; when going in to combat without armor preffered to\n&gt; were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.  This\n&gt; allowed full movement without tripping on the hakama\n&gt; itself.(anyone who practices Aikido has had this\n&gt; happen)  When wearing armor they didn&#39;t even wear\n&gt; hakama so it did not apply.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Word &quot;ninja&quot; is not hstorically correct and\n&gt; neither is their movie incarnation.  They were usually\n&gt; reffered to as Shinobi and originally were not as\n&gt; specialized as the movies make them appear.  They were\n&gt; used to set fire to enemy encampments and castles in\n&gt; order to cause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they would\n&gt; be employed to kill.  But I have heard of very few if\n&gt; any cases with the latter.  A good book on the subject\n&gt; of the origin and truths behind the &quot;Ninja&quot; is Stephen\n&gt; Turnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold of and\n&gt; has to be ordered from Europe but is worth the price.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are alot of myths regarding the history of the\n&gt; Martial arts.(Ninja Especially)\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone looks back through the emails they will find\n&gt; an explanation given by me on the general usage of the\n&gt; hakama as well as from Anthony J. Bryant, Both of\n&gt; these are good.  There was really nothing mysterious\n&gt; about it.  If you look at the clothing from the yayoi\n&gt; period forward you will see similarity&#39;s leading to\n&gt; the advent of the Hakama.  The Japanese as with every\n&gt; othr nation were very practical in the development of\n&gt; their clothing.  A good example of this is the Long\n&gt; Hakama worn in the Shoguns palace during the Tokugawa\n&gt; period which restricted movement making attacks on\n&gt; others impossible.  Also the short hakama worn in the\n&gt; Summer by some foot soldiers and attendants in the\n&gt; kamakura period.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;\n&gt; Musashi\n&gt;\n&gt; P.s. I left out alot of other examples.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- KUM0 &lt;kum0@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Konnichi-wa,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It has been my experience of martial arts (for 11\n&gt; &gt; years, through 8 different arts), that the samurai\n&gt; &gt; used to wear them for all\n&gt; &gt; of the above purposes, but also for one other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is a sitting posture that the ninja adopted\n&gt; &gt; when impersonating a samurai, so that it was easy to\n&gt; &gt; move if attacked\n&gt; &gt; unexpectantly, or preparing to attack unexpectantly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although I can&#39;t reveal the seated posture, I can,\n&gt; &gt; however, tell you about it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This seated posture looks identical to the casual\n&gt; &gt; seated posture in modern day Japan, with the legs\n&gt; &gt; crossed at the shins, and\n&gt; &gt; knees almost resting on the ankles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is still alive in martial arts that have\n&gt; &gt; techniques adopted from the samurai arts. The hakama\n&gt; &gt; hid whether or not they\n&gt; &gt; were seated like this in particular, or  _however_\n&gt; &gt; they were seated in fact.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kumo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Natsu Kusa Ya\n&gt; &gt; Tsuamono Domo Ga\n&gt; &gt; Yume No Ato\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Basho.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: konos\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Besides it&#39;s ocassional apperance at the Edo Period\n&gt; &gt; and in the hitatare of 12th century, hakama is not\n&gt; &gt; obligatory. It&#39;s not a\n&gt; &gt; daimyo&#39;s command. Nevertheless samurai were more or\n&gt; &gt; less obliged to follow the &quot;rich and famous&quot; status\n&gt; &gt; of the court they were\n&gt; &gt; implicated in. First of all samurai were warriors.\n&gt; &gt; So even the obi was the right dressing only if it\n&gt; &gt; could carry tanto or\n&gt; &gt; wakizashi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Greetings from Greece, especially to Amphipolis.\n&gt; &gt; Konstantinos\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
