I managed to \nget to it on Friday. It&#39;s really worth a visit, with some memorable exhibits: there is \na special exhibition on at the moment on Sakamoto Ryoma. It&#39;s a shame that \nthere are no English explanations at all. I didn&#39;t really leave enough time to \ndecipher every sign. The tombstones of the Meiji heroes behind the museum \nare also very interesting.\n\nI went to the Osaka Prefectural History museum too. It&#39;s terrific and gives lots of \ninsights into the daily life of the city. If anyone&#39;s visiting Osaka I&#39;d recommend \nspending a few hours there. \n\nNow I&#39;m back in Yamaguchi, thinking about Choshu: if anyone wants to discuss \nChoshu&#39;s role in the Meiji Restoration it would be good to exchange ideas.\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
