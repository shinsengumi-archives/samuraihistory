I believe Donald Richie has been recently honored in just such \na way. However, these awards are not to be construed with knighthood or \nsamurai status.\n\tThe samurai (with all due respect can we use bushi or buke?) were \nabolished as a class in the 1870&#39;s by the Emperor&#39;s own government and \nwith the stroke of the Emperor&#39;s own pen(seal). No one can convince me \nthat 8 foreigners have been given the privileges of the class while \nlegitimate descendants of buke families are denied same!\n\n\n-t\n\n\nSurely if the Emperor needed the help of the World Full Contact Karate \nchampion so much so that he knighted him, wouldn&#39;t he keep him close at \nhand? If anything did happen he would be too late to help if travelling \nfrom Manchester!?!\n\n\n"
