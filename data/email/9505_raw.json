I recall helping out (with answers) Tom Cruise and =\r\nsome folks \nconnected with the film a few years before it was released to \n=\r\ntheatres. \n\nAt least I thought they&#39;d get it to at least resemble Japan aft=\r\ner our \nCivil War. The film was set in 1876-1877. This was the same time as=\r\n \nRurouni Kenshin/Samurai X was laid. The animes were more historically \nco=\r\nrrect than the film was. \n\nSome examples--\n\n(SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVE NOT =\r\nYET SEEN TLS FILM)\n\nSeveral Samurai wearing only one katana\n\nA fallen Samur=\r\nai committing seppukuu with a tante (dagger or knife) \nrather than using hi=\r\ns katana blade\n\nA reference to a field artillery cannon as a &#39;howitzer&#39; yea=\r\nrs before \nthe howitzer was invented.\n\nSamurai participating in covert (spy=\r\ning) operations. Samurai detested \nspying and any other form of deceit. To =\r\nthis end they usually used \nNinjas for this purpose.\n\nSamurai in 1876-1877 =\r\nstill wearing ceremonial armour into battle and \nallowing an outsider (Crui=\r\nse as a cavalry captain) to wear the armour \nof the man he killed. I don&#39;t =\r\nrecall Kenshin Himura or even Saitoh \nHajime wearing armour on RK or SX. \n\n=\r\nThe battle was laughable. No Samurai will wait for an enemy he is \nfacing t=\r\no attack first. Especially when he has the advantage of a \ncavalry charge a=\r\ngainst infantry. \n\nAll things considered I think that Richard Chamberlain (=\r\nThe Shogun) \ndid \na better job as a Samurai than Tom Cruise. Even Chuck Nor=\r\nris would \nhave \nbeen a better choice. \n\nKen Watanabe was robbed. He deserv=\r\ned the Best Supporting Actor Oscar \nthat year. I did hear he won some anime=\r\n filming achievement awards \nearlier this year though. \n\nWell more soon.
