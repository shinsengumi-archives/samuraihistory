It includes the submission of a Code of Conduct. Although you might think all this is rather unnecessary and bureaucratic, believe me, if we are to hang onto our swords and be free to buy, sell and import, this is the sort of thing that we need to do.\nComments would be welcome.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n         \n\n \t\t\n---------------------------------\n All new Yahoo!
