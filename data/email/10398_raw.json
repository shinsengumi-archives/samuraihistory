In particular, locations of battles, castles, temp=\r\nles, and other significant sites.\n\nSamurai Archives has a number of decent =\r\nmaps, but I am looking for other sources too.  Books, websites, etc...\n\nOne=\r\n thing I have noticed is that if you look at multiple sources you often get=\r\n multiple (slightly different) accounts of stories or locations/names.  So,=\r\n I am trying to broaden my sources.\nFor example, there is a map from Turnbu=\r\nll documenting Hojo expansion in the Kanto, and it really isn&#39;t clear if he=\r\n is being overly generous or not since he &quot;gives&quot; them the Satomi domain pr=\r\nior to the final siege of Odawara.\n\nAlso, I would be okay with looking at m=\r\naps in japanese, if anyone knows of some good ones.  My Japanese is not gre=\r\nat, but I can usually do enough translation on individual words/terms/place=\r\ns to get the gist.\n\nAnyways, thanks in advance.\n-dennis\n\n\n"
