Our kind host has a very good set of maps at \nwww.sengoku-archives.com For instance there is this one that shows the \nnames of the Daimyo (but not the names of the &quot;kuni&quot;) in 1545:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/1545.html\n2. There is a great map that shows the outlines of the kuni and \ntheir old names at http://flagspot.net/flags/jp(k.html\n3. If I new anything about mapping software I would make for myself \na map which combines the two, plus included modern prefecture \nboundaries and names. It&#39;s been on my mind for about a year now but \nit&#39;s one of those projects that I guess I&#39;ll get to &quot;one of these \ndays&quot; (like my translation of the ShinChou KouKi....)\n\nBut, recognize that even though the Sengoku period was rather short, \nit was quite turbulent. So, the answers to your questions are all \npretty much &quot;it depends on exactly what date you are looking at&quot;. \nAre you interested in a specific time period/date, or the overall \nflow of events during the entire late 15th-16th centuries?\n\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
