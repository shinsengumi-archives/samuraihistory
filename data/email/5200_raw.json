But 1493 makes sense too because it was the \nyear that Jundouji&#39;s (the younger brother killed by Chachamaru) older \nbrother Ashikaga Yoshizumi took control as Shogun, and that would \nhave given Soun the &#39;justification&#39; for invasion - to avenge the \nmother and brother of the Shogun.  Not to mention 2 years of civil \nwar in Izu would take a toll on everyone involved, given Soun an \neasier time of it all.\n\nSo which is it, 1491 or 1493?\n\n\n"
