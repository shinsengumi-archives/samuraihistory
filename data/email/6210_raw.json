I was merely thinking \nof what I commonly do with kitchen knives, and one of them is \nchopping garlic for a good soffrito, after you&#39;ve cooked the onions \nin oil to a nice pale transparency (because the onions need to cook \nlonger than the garlic).  No cross necessary for that.  The whole \nvampire myth- vampires wouldn&#39;t last a week in Italy, would they?\n\n  No problem, I do not take offense at jokes, I really thought it WAS \nfunny.
