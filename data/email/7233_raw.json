A \ngroup of dissatisfied samurai begin murdering prostitutes and even \nthe restaurant&#39;s owner. When a prostitute named Oshin tries to fight \nback and is captured, three swordsmen come to her defense. \n\nReview: The Japanese are true masters of cinema and Roningai is \nproof positive. Director Kazuo Kuroki paints a rich and detailed \ntapestry of flawed characters and brutal violence nearing the end of \nthe age of samurai that carefully builds up to an eruption of \nintense swordplay in the final act. \n\nIt is a period on Japanese history marked by transition from the \nfeudal era where samurai were near the top of the social ladder to \nan era of relative stability leading into the Meiji Restoration. \nRoningai follows the pitiful lives of a number of people who \nconverge on a restaurant just outside of Edo and must contend with \nmurderous samurai. Aramaki Gennai, a wild ronin reminiscent of \nToshiro Mifune&#39;s Kikuchiyo from Seven Samurai arrives to resume a \nbawdy relationship with a high-priced prostitute named Oshin. She&#39;s \nalso the object of desire for a more reserved ronin named Horo \nGombei. A third warrior known as &quot;Bull&quot; has become the self \nproclaimed protector of Oshin and all of the prostitutes who \nfrequent the eatery. Another frustrated warrior named Doi lives with \nhis sister and has become a breeder of smelly birds. Trouble begins \nas one by one; the prostitutes begin to turn up dead. Growing fear \nand uncertainty reaches a fever pitch when the restaurant&#39;s owner is \nalso killed. The killers themselves, a group of samurai and their \nretainers crash the funeral and declare both their distaste for the \nworld&#39;s oldest profession and their intention to kill any more who \ncontinue the practice. Incensed, Oshin and Doi&#39;s sister plot their \nrevenge by setting a trap in order to shoot the first samurai who \nattacks with a pistol. Bull, who has sold himself to the samurai \nfoils the attempt and the two girls are captured. After \nincriminating evidence of the samurais&#39; illicit activities come into \nthe hands of Doi, his sister is released and Oshin comes in danger \nof being torn apart by real bulls unless the ronin turn up with the \nevidence. Still in a drunken stupor, Gennai shows up first to \nchallenge over 100 men single-handedly. Learning of Oshin&#39;s plight, \nGombei then plows into the fray. Finally, Doi in full armor rides in \non horseback and the three warriors fight furiously to save Oshin. \n\nKazuo apparently chose filmmaking over a career in the ministry \nafter becoming inspired by the films of Akira Kurosawa. This film \nclearly displays those influences and perhaps most noticeable are \nthe details. Everything from the sets and costumes to the story \nstructure and camera work is meticulously recreated and used. Also \nlike Kurosawa&#39;s films, the characters are dark and tragic. One \ndifference is that instead of watching them descend into darkness, \nthey begin there and rise out to become noble. It&#39;s hard to describe \njust how well this is done. Initially, Oshin is frivolous and Gennai \nis a drunkard seemingly uncaring about the murders or anything else. \nGombei is cowardly in his secret affections for Oshin and later \nendures humiliation as a result. Bull is both a coward and an \nopportunist who sells himself to the samurai. Even Doi, who has \nactually managed to earn a living, browbeats his supportive sister \nwhile dreaming of being a samurai again. All of these characters are \nfairly unlikable. But as they become challenged by the murderous \nsamurai, they all eventually rise to the challenge and prove to be \nbetter than the samurai who scorn them. \n\nAs a chambara film, the swordplay action is fairly sparse until the \nfinal scene, but it more than makes up for it. Holding back on the \naction actually has the positive effect of making the finale fight \nseem all the more startling. You&#39;ve almost come to expect nothing \nfrom these swordsmen and when they leap into action, the result is \nincredible. The actor who plays Gennai gives a wonderfully \nexpressive physical performance as he stumbles around flinging \nbloodied swords about. His hair which is out of control reminded me \nof Max Mok in The Assassin and although that is no compliment, his \nfrenzied role is definitely a highlight. \n\nRoningai is a terrific chambara film and also a fine example of how \ncharacter and depth need not be sacrificed for action and \nexcitement. With excellent production values, acting and a simmering \nplot topped off with an incredible finale, you are strongly advised \nto seek this film out.\n\nhttp://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/roningai_053105.htm\n\n\n\n"
