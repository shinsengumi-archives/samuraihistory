An exact\nsource and names could I not find it. But, I found the\npicture at\nhttp://www.dkbnews.com/img/2005/03/123/w1.jpg.\n\nThe picture is pretty accurate in a description of the\nweaponery and battle uniforms of two countries during\nthe war.\n\nThis picture describes the battle where Admiral Lee\nSun-Shin defeated 136 ships with only 12 ships\nimmediately after a major defeat of the Korean Navy\nunder another Korean Admiral with Admiral Lee himself\nimprisoned due to the political attack against him.\n\nAlthough I am origianlly a Korean national and am\nplanning to become an American citizen, I personally\nadmire the Japanese culture and outstanding martial\ntradition. \nJapanese and Koreans are most close relative to each\nother linguistically, culturally, and ethnically.\nI do believe that the prosperity of two countries and\nthe stability of the North East Asia depends on how\nJapan and Korea cooperate and support each other\nbecause of their geographical proximity and ecnomic,\npoltical, and military interdependence.\n\nThe past is the past. What lies ahead is our future\nand the future of our next generation.\n\n\n\n \n                     Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                     Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
