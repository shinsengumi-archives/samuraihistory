I am \nabout to give a speech on the Sengoku Period and the Battle of \nSekigahara for my Speech class.  One of my requirements is getting \ntestimony from experts.  These experts could be peers or \nprofessionals.  When they mean peer experts, it means people who done \nor are doing research about finding out information on a certain \ntopic.\n\nI only have three questions.  Although some of these questions might \nsound ridiculous, MY audience know nothing about Sengoku Period and \nSekigahara.  So I don&#39;t want to confuse the hell out of them.  Know \nwhat I mean.\n\nAnyways....\n(In the e-mail, Could you put your name, and how long you have been \nresearching or have been interested in this topic.  It is to show \nthat I am giving you credit about your knowledge)\n\n1)  The Sengoku Period was known as the age of Warring States.  Why \nis it one of the more fascinating part of Japan&#39;s history?\n\n2)  Why was the Battle of Sekigahara such a decisive battle?  Why not \nthe other battles that occurred before it?\n\n3)  Why was there a clash between Toyotomi and Tokugawa?  Wasn&#39;t \nTokugawa under the rule of Toyotomi?\n\nThat&#39;s all the questions I have.  Please send the answers to \nschhy84@... or schhy84@..., or both).  I ask this, b/c \nmy teacher wants a copy of it.  Don&#39;t worry, I will not disclose any \ninformation to the world.  This is STRICTLY for school purposes.  \nThanks in advance\n\nChhy\n\n\n"
