The rebels inflicted a \n&gt;series\n&gt;of ignominious defeats on the besieging samurai armies and so alarmed \n&gt;the Shogunate that\n&gt;help was requested from the Dutch, who obliged by attacking the rebels \n&gt;from the sea\n&gt;with naval cannon.\n&gt;\n&gt;Matsudaira Nobutsuna, the commander sent by the Shogunate to end\n&gt;the uprising, opted for a lengthy siege, only concluding with a final \n&gt;assault when\n&gt;the rebels supplies had been exhausted and starvation had set in.\n&gt;\n&gt;There is a good description of the Shimabara rebellion in Ivan Morris&#39; book\n&gt;&quot;The Nobility of Failure&quot; in the chapter entitled, &quot;Amakusa Shiro - \n&gt;Japanese Messiah.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;gabriel d gabaya wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does anybody here have indepth knowledge about the Shimabara rebellion \n&gt;&gt; of 1637-38?
