The \n&gt; &gt; caption reads &quot;Scene of Nagamasa&#39;s seppuku,\n&gt; directly outside Odani&#39;s Apartment.&quot; \n&gt; &gt;  Two questions: is it the site of Asai&#39;s seppuku\n&gt; and what exactly IS &quot;Odani&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; Apartment&quot;?  The picture is here...\n&gt; \n&gt; It was the room occupied by Odani no kata.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
