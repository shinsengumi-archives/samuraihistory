Glad to find this place. I do have\n&gt; a question, although not really history related, hope the OT is OK -\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in taking the Japanese language exam - not sure exactly\n&gt; what it is called, but the test that has 4 levels.  I&#39;m interested in\n&gt; taking the 1st or 2nd level depending (I believe the lower the #, the\n&gt; harder the test). I can read Japanese pretty well, and deal in Japanese\n&gt; through my job, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;d knock out the 3rd and 4th levels in my\n&gt; sleep. Just checking to see actually when and where you can take the\n&gt; test - I&#39;d like to take it in the second half of 2006 - I&#39;ll be moving\n&gt; to Oahu, Hawaii, so maybe the University of Hawaii Manoa does the\n&gt; test?\n\nThe test is called the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.  You can \nfind information here:\nhttp://www.jees.or.jp/jlpt/en/\n\nUnfortunately, the test is only given once per year (in December), with \nregistration occurring between July and early September.  I don&#39;t know \noff-hand whether they give it in Hawaii, but would be surprised if they \ndidn&#39;t.  In any event, the above site should have whatever information \nyou need.\n\nShannon\n\n\n"
