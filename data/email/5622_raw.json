But in any case, my time is limited in trying to \nfind his family name before his own kids(my grandma/siblings) pass \naway.  See he wouldn&#39;t even tell them.  Only one son knew about his \npast and wouldn&#39;t talk about it till 2000.  One hundred years after \nhe came to america.  Either by old age or never being told the \nfamily name isn&#39;t known.  So my search will go on... thank you for \nyour help.\nT. Shimizu\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Falcone-\n&gt; \tIt is well known that a group of Aizu samurai immigrated to \nthe US \n&gt; after being defeated in the restoration wars. Is it possible that \nthis \n&gt; is the group your are thinking of? They settled in California and \nhard \n&gt; a very hard time of it.\n&gt; \tWhile your story sounds unlikely to me, the one place I \nwould go with \n&gt; such questions is the Japanese American History Archive; \n&gt; http://www.jcccnc.org/facility/tenants.htm#jaha. Very kind and \nhelpful \n&gt; folks,\n&gt; -t\n\n\n"
