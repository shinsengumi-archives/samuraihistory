Lyle&quot; &lt;rntihg@...&gt; wrote:\n  In order to\n&gt; get an idea of what was \n&gt; going on in the literary circles of the later 20th\n&gt; century one really cant \n&gt; get away without reading some Mishima (and Kawabata\n&gt; and Oe the Murakamis, \n&gt; etc.)  \n\nTrue. And I stomached Kinkakuji, because I had to.\nJust as I stomached Kenzaburo Oe, who isn&#39;t\nnecessarily whacko, just boring. (I fully grant that\nthis is simply my own opinion). Murakami Haruki, on\nthe other hand, stands as the greatest writer of all\ntime (again, my opinion--not really, he&#39;s just my\nFAVORITE writer of all time. Allow me a little\nhyperbole.) Kawabata is VERY good and fully deserving\nof the Nobel he won--I loved Yukiguni and own a copy. \n\nOn another side, it was an interesting side\n&gt; course for my study as I \n&gt; am interested in the ways that the\n&gt; samurai/bushido/martial tradition in \n&gt; Japan has been co-opted by people for their specific\n&gt; ends.  As such, \n&gt; Mishima is very important. \n\nThat I will definitely grant. He&#39;s a case study in it.\n\n\n He wrote a comment on\n&gt; Hagakure, he started to \n&gt; lift weights and study Kendo in his 30s (as a way to\n&gt; exemplify bunbu \n&gt; ryodou), and wrote a book called wakaki samurai no\n&gt; tame ni.  \n\nThis is also the same time he became homosexual, is it\nnot? I believe, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, that he felt\nthat masculine love was a virtue, like many samurai\ndid, and Ihara Saikaku (speaking of authors). \n\nInsane or not, \n&gt; there is much to mine their for material for\n&gt; research and such.  Besides \n&gt; many great writers were &quot;whacko.&quot;  Flaubert and\n&gt; Akutagawa come to mind.\n\nTrue. I fully grant that many writers were wacko. He&#39;s\none of them. \n\n&gt; As for the play, it was called _Patriotism_ and a\n&gt; film was made of it that \n&gt; had such a graphic and realistic (as far as one\n&gt; would guess) depiction of \n&gt; seppuku that Mishima&#39;s widow had all extant copies\n&gt; of it (that she could \n&gt; get her hands on) destroyed.  My former University\n&gt; has one of the few \n&gt; surviving copies.   \n\nI think I&#39;ve seen the scene--that or it was recreated\nin his biography I saw, I can&#39;t remember which. It&#39;s\nbeen too long. \n\nI&#39;m not trying to debate his literary merits--he&#39;s\ndefinitely got a place in the pantheon of Japanese, if\nnot world, literature. Many writers who are &quot;great&quot;\nare writers who I wouldn&#39;t read if stranded on a\ndeserted island with their collected works--pick a\nRussian writer and give me his name and I&#39;ll\nimmediately fall asleep. That&#39;s not a reflection on\ntheir writing per se, it&#39;s a reflection on my attitude\ntowards their writing. As I said, I&#39;ve got nothing\nagainst Japanese modern fiction--while I think Oe\nKenzaburo and Abe Kobo are boring and I&#39;d rather pluck\nmy eyelashes out, I simply LOVE Murakami Haruki,\nKawabata Yasunari, Natsume Soseki, etc. My FAVORITE\nbook of all time is probably either &quot;South of the\nBorder, West of the Sun&quot; or &quot;Sputnik Sweetheart&quot; by\nMurakami or &quot;All She Was Worth&quot;, the best mystery I&#39;ve\never read, by Miyabe Miyuki. I LOVE that book...\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance: Get your refund fast by filing online.\nhttp://taxes.yahoo.com/filing.html\n\n"
