As in any warrior class or \nmilitary group; you have both good and bead individuals.  There were \nsome Samurai that intimidated and murdered.  There were others that \nwe well known for being sophisticated and artful.  \n\nIt is difficult to say that Samurai affected Japanese Society because \nthey were very much a product of society.  Japanese society today \nstill has some &quot;Samurai&quot; values incorperated and ingrained in their \nimage as individuals and society accepted group behavior.  I&#39;m not an \nexpert but even after the Meiji Restoration (when the Emperor crushed \nthe Samurai class and returned Military power to the throne) Samurai \nvalues were still important to the Japanese.  \n\nIf you wanted to talk about the ways that Samurai values have \nsurvived into modern Japan, I&#39;d discuss the ideas of honor, chivalry, \nservice, and ferocity in battle(in the business world now).\n\nThe Samurai were a wide and varied class of warriors.  There were low \nClass Ashigaru to the very high class Nobles.  But I think that the \nconditions the Japanese were subjected to caused a unique \nspecialization of the feudal system.  The harsh weather, constent \ninternal military conflict, and repeated invasion attempts, changed \nthe Samurai and Japanese culture both.  They can&#39;t quite be seperated \nbecause the occured simultaniously.  To simplify; until the lat 1800s \n(Meiji Restoration) they were the same.  Samurai ruled the society at \nthat time and the Samurai Culture was Japanese Culture.\n\nBrandon  \n--- In samuraihistory@y..., eraysir@a... wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; Thank you for your reply.\n&gt; After agreeing to help my son with this, I found myself lost in \ninformation.\n&gt; I was dumbfounded.\n&gt; I asked him what kind of evil teacher would give a child a task \nlike this.\n&gt; He said &quot;I just made up the subject myself&quot;\n&gt; Everything in the world has a reason. Perhaps the experts should \nlook at the \n&gt; effects of the Samurai on society. Was it good? Bad? Etc.\n&gt; some say they intimidated and murdered. He says they taught them \nZen\n&gt; Interesting topic, don&#39;t you think?\n&gt; Lacking information, he is just making up something so he can get \nhis paper \n&gt; finished and a good grade.\n&gt; If you experts would like any input on the matter the paper will be \npresented \n&gt; 12-8-02\n&gt; I think it&#39;s a very important history lesson and would not like to \nsee anyone \n&gt; get the wrong information.\n&gt; Thanks For your help ~Ray~\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
