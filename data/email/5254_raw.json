I did find \none more books that went into more detail.  It almost seemed to be a \ncombination of the two theories, stating that After the attack on \nUnno Munetsuna, for some reason they went to Suruga, and \nunfortunately I couldnt read the key kanji in the key sentence, but \nit seemed to be something about Nobutora going to Yoshimoto to \ndiscuss the boarder between Kai and Suruga province, at which time he \nis retired in favor of shingen.  So it appears that Yoshimoto had \nsome hand in it, but it still is pretty inconclusive.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\nlistowner@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have been researching exactly how Shingen overthrew his father, \nand \n&gt; actually came up with two different versions of events.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The first version goes roughly like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; in the 5th month of 1541, Harunobu (shingen) and his father \nNobutora \n&gt; attack Unno Munetsuna in Shinano.  By the sixth month, the battle \nis \n&gt; won, and Munetsuna flees the province.  They depart for Kai on 6/4, \n&gt; and on the journey back, on 6/14, Shingen, along with his Ashigaru, \n&gt; drive Nobutora off, and he was forced to flee to Imagawa Yoshimoto, \n&gt; in Suruga (Yoshimoto was married to one of Nobutora&#39;s daughters).\n&gt; \n&gt; The second version goes like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; In the 6th month of 1541, Nobutora and Harunobu (shingen) went to \n&gt; visit Nobutora&#39;s daughter, who was married to Imagawa Yoshimoto, in \n&gt; Suruga province.  Little did Nobutora know, Yoshimoto and Shingen \nhad \n&gt; plotted against him. When they got there, Nobutora was forcibly \n&gt; retired in favor of Shingen, and he was put under the &quot;patronage&quot; \nof \n&gt; Yoshimoto.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure why there are two versions, one seems to come from a \n&gt; specific historical record, maybe the other comes from more than \none \n&gt; sources.  does anyone know which is more likely?\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
