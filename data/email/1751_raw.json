The only death close to such settings of a cliff, can be that of the ritual suicide of Saigo Takamori during September of 1877 on a hilltop in Kagoshima, which is a coast city. He was the aristocratic politician who led the Satsuma rebellion, but was one of 3 samurai who helped form the Japan army whom he turned against. This murder story your friend mentioned, have the liking of a rumor. The rebellion had nothing to do with another country. Only Samurai faught against the Meiji laws of the Japan army, in 1877 where about 21thousand perished...mmm...but I will follow this story up.\n\nDeon\n\n \n\n\nWarrior_of_bushido &lt;warrior_of_bushido@...&gt; wrote:\nHi, a college friend posed this question to me, and  as i dont know of any such story,  i wondered if any of you have any information. She heard the story years ago and is now trying to trace it again, and get more facts. \nThe event is purported to have taken place in the 1860s or 70s, and concerns the murder, on a beach hidden by wooded cliffs, of two or three &quot;shishi&quot; during the Satsuma rebellion or related events, by 5 Americans. \nThats all my friend can remeber of the story, if it rings any bells please let us know - we would be fascinated.\n\nLaura\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
