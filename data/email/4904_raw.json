I have two. \n\n\nIf you can&#39;t find anything, you didn&#39;t look. \n\nTyping in &quot;Zen Buddhism&quot; on Google US got me 397,000\nwebsites. www.zenguide.com is one of the first ones,\nand judging by it&#39;s name, looks like a decent enough\nstarting place. \n\nEveryone here is more than happy to help someone with\nspecific questions or provide guidance to someone who\nis willing to do their own research. But it would have\ntaken you just as much time to do a google search as\nit would have to type your email. Zen Buddhism is an\nEASY topic to find information on. If you were looking\nfor the specific quotes of a certain Zen cleric, or\nopinions on how Zen relates to something else, I&#39;m\nsure no one would have an issue. But no one is going\nto just hand you everything--if you want to know about\nsomething as general as Zen, you need to look yourself\nbefore you start asking. \n\nNot trying to sound too harsh, but in the end it saves\neveryone involved time and frustration.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nTake Yahoo!
