My next project for the Genealogy section of the Samurai \n&gt; &gt; Archives is the Oda genealogy, although as it stands I only have \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; Oda Nobuhide on down (his 10 children and thier decendants).  If \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re interested in this info, let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello - and thanks for the kind words about the website. It&#39;s very \n&gt; amateurish but it&#39;s alot of fun for me to work on.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would indeed be very interested in seeing the info you have on \n&gt; Nobuhide on down! For now I&#39;ve been focusing on the other \ndirection. \n&gt; As you know, on my site I&#39;ve got some narrative about the early \n&gt; history of the Oda family, up to about 1400. I am now gathering \n&gt; information on the 4-5 generations before Nobunaga (from about 1400 \n&gt; onwards).\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s interesting to see that Nobunaga&#39;s branch of the family was so \n&gt; minor that reliable (independant) records of his direct line are \nvery \n&gt; sketchy until you get to Nobuhide. In fact it appears the one \ncannot \n&gt; go much further back than Nobunaga&#39;s own great-grandfather, \nSukenobu \n&gt; (Toshisada as the great-grandfather appears to be incorrect and may \n&gt; be part of the false family history created by Nobunaga).\n&gt; \n&gt; Just out of curiousity have you put Nobunaga as the 2nd or third \n&gt; child? Accounts do differ alot.\n\n\n"
