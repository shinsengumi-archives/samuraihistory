However, the\nsteel making process often adopted in the manufacture\nof the cannons were more popularly used in China and\nKorea.\nThat is why the major firearms for China and Korea\nduring this period was cannons instead of arquebus\nunlike Japan.\n\nHowever, Machurians who conqured Myung Dynasty used\narchery against the firearms of China and proved that\ntheir archery was superior weaponary than the use of\nfirearms. This is one of reasons why the last Chinese\nempire(Manchurian&#39;s) did not show much interest in the\nwestern weaponary.\n\nAs for Korea, their major weaponary was archery same\nas that of Manchurians, which proved to be effective\nin fighting the well trained Japanane soldiers until\nJapanese adopted arquebus and used it during their\nKorean invasion of the 16th(?) century. But, like\ntheir continental neighbor, Koreans were also better\nin manufacturing  cannons rather than arquebus due to\ntheir peculiar steel making process. The heavy and\nefficient use of cannons especially by Korean Navy was\none of factors that made Japanese decide to withdraw\nfrom the Korean peninsula.\n\nLastly, there is a recent English translation on the\nbook on the Japanese invasion of the Korea written by\nthe then Korean (royal court) prime minister, who was\na famous theoretical confucianist and well versed in\nthe military strategy during that time. I remember it\nwas published throught the grant offered by either UC\nBerkeley or Stanford (not sure, but some well standing\nuniversity in the west coast). You might like to look\nfor the book if you are interested. For the specific\ninformation on the book, you can try www.chosun.com,\nwhich is the website of the Korean(largetst) daily\nnewspaper. I hope that this will help.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Changsub Lee\n\n\n--- murphymurphyjohn@... wrote:\n&gt; In my research into Japanese firearms,  I know the\n&gt; use of arquebus match lock \n&gt; muskets is well documented, following the importing\n&gt; of the first ones by the \n&gt; Portuguese in 1543 at Tanegashima.  However,  there\n&gt; seems little (if anything) \n&gt; on the use of match lock pistols or hand guns by the\n&gt; samurai officers who \n&gt; captained Teppu-shu, the firearms corps of\n&gt; commanders like Oda Nobunaga at \n&gt; Nagashino in 1575.  Can anyone enlighten me here? \n&gt; Prof.  John F.
