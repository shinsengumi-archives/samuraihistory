I see your point. I think I\n&gt; settled the thing for\n&gt; now anyway. The thread the whole thing took place in\n&gt; got really quiet since\n&gt; i came up with some minor citations to prove my\n&gt; point.\n&gt; That of course doens�t mean that I lost the interest\n&gt; in finding material to\n&gt; have a closer look on jurisdiction and laws\n&gt; concerning those of samurai\n&gt; status in the edo-period.\n&gt; So if anyone has further material on that (perhaps a\n&gt; little easier), please\n&gt; don�t hesitate...\n&gt; \n&gt; Karsten\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, February 02, 2004 11:19 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Rules and restrictions\n&gt; for the samurai in\n&gt; edojidai\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Karsten Helmholz wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The other day I had a discussion on the rules\n&gt; and restrictions the\n&gt; samurai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; faced in daily life concerning the use of\n&gt; swords. The guy I was talking\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; insisted on the idea, that they were forbidden\n&gt; by law to draw their\n&gt; swords,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unless told to by their superiors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My point was that there were only resctrictions\n&gt; to the drawing of swords\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain occasions like being at the shoguns\n&gt; palace or in the court. I\n&gt; guess\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there are many more times when it was forbidden\n&gt; but those are the points\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that instantly came to my mind. I think that\n&gt; apart from that, there were\n&gt; no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; laws that restricted the drawing or the use of\n&gt; the sword. One example\n&gt; here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be kirisute gomen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My request to the members of this list would be\n&gt; to name any kind of\n&gt; source\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that proves my point as I don�t want to rely\n&gt; only on one or two sources\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have at hand right now. I can use english,\n&gt; german, french or japanese\n&gt; texts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially original sources or their modern day\n&gt; transcriptions would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great (i.e. osadamegaki, buke shohatto). Any\n&gt; help will be appreciated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s hard to find that sort of thing; you&#39;re\n&gt; looking for a negative.\n&gt; (e.g.,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;prove that UFOs don&#39;t exist&quot;). Tell your friend\n&gt; to find citations for his\n&gt; point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tony\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; Samurai Archives store:\n&gt; http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
