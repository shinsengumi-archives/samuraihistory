I&#39;d \n&gt; definately be interested if you have any interesting thoughts or \n&gt; insights on the subject.\n\nIn a nutshell: the basic materials of stone timber and \nearth employed in castle building were the same, although \nthe way in which they were used i.e. methods of \nconstruction and layout were quite different.\n\nThe principle similarity is in a functional sense in that \nboth European and Japanese castles were the defended \nresidences of feudal lords, and therefore were \nmultifunctional complexes fulfilling  administrative, \neconomic, residential, and probably only occasionally, \nmilitary roles.\nI must say I am envious, as I haven&#39;t seen any Japanese \ncastles &quot;in the flesh&quot;. Do you have any interesting \npictures?\nJon Freeman\nUniversity of Exeter\n\n\n\n"
