I feel \n&gt;like its a part of me that needs attention just like a close realative. I \n&gt;believe that my sword is as strong as me and it can match my capabilities \n&gt;if need be. It may not be all that to any one else but it smells good and \n&gt;mackeral or wonderfull I view my swords as a lot more than just tools. GOD \n&gt;BLESS YOU ALL.\n&gt;\n&gt;peace\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDonï¿½t just search. Find.
