One excellent video is made by the Nippon\nBudokan on the Negishi Ryu\n\npaul\n\n\n\n--- Silk Road School &lt;silk.road.school@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; ...Also, if the tip\n&gt; had enough of an edge, it could be used as a\n&gt; shuriken since the original\n&gt; shuriken were merely short knives, not throwing\n&gt; stars.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, as I understand it, the true shuriken is a\n&gt; spike (or dart) for\n&gt; throwing, pointed at one or both ends.  The throwing\n&gt; star is technically a\n&gt; shaken. (Would anyone care to translate the two\n&gt; terms literally?  I&#39;d be\n&gt; very curious to understand the distinction between\n&gt; shaken and shuriken,\n&gt; linguistically.)  I&#39;ve only seen one book discuss\n&gt; the matter - _Spike and\n&gt; Chain_ (it&#39;s an overview of shaken, shuriken and\n&gt; manriki-gusari), so if\n&gt; anyone has any information to the contrary I&#39;d be\n&gt; interested in that as\n&gt; well.\n&gt;         Gereg\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
