There\n&gt;&gt;is rank, yes, but that&#39;s SOCIAL rank, not military\n&gt;&gt;rank.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; EXACTLY!

And... waitaminnit... what do you mean your family is more prestigious \nthan mine? :P\n\n&gt; Again, exactly. Positions weren&#39;t given objectively,\n&gt; and could be taken away at any time. Even in European\n&gt; armies at this time, there wasn&#39;t a coherent rank\n&gt; structure as we see today--you might have a few\n&gt; &quot;lieutenants&quot; or &quot;captains&quot; as subordinate managers,\n&gt; and a &quot;sergeant at arms&quot; or two to enforce discipline,\n&gt; but again, there weren&#39;t ranks like they developed\n&gt; into, not yet. \n\nI think people would generally be surprised at how modern the concept of \nrank-structure in armies is. Actually, the Romans were very rank/office set with \nthe way they did their legions (the first modern armies, afterall), and after \nthem it was centuries before anything like it was recreated. I think that it \nmight be a factor of the &quot;equality&quot; of a republican form of government that \ncreated that modern army, as it was certainly not a typical feudal structure \nlike that which pervaded Europe from the Normans on, until GA&#39;s &quot;new model army&quot; \n-- and even then it was looser than we think of ranks today. It&#39;s interesting to \nnote that the forerunners of many of our modern &quot;ranks&quot; were actually rather \nunique positions and functions under older armies (like your example of sergeant \nat arms, or color sergeant or ensign, or...\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
