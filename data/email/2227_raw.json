In what year did Tokugawa Ieyasu pass the edict that allied lords\n&gt;had to spend some time in or near Edo?\n&gt;\n&gt;2. How much time did they have to spend there?\n&gt;\n&gt;3. Where did these lords stay? A kind of &quot;guest&quot; castle, or where...?\n&gt;\n&gt;4. One of the fictional lords I will use has the surname Iwamura. I\n&gt;know Iwamura was the place of a battle (I think this battle even took\n&gt;place near the time frame of my story), I would like to know what\n&gt;does Iwamura mean (or perhaps Iwa and mura separated, I think it has\n&gt;to do something about a hawk?)\n&gt;\n&gt;5. Is an army of some five thousand men and six hundred cavalry big\n&gt;(for one single lord)? I think that, at least, six hundred horses\n&gt;sound like a lot...\n&gt;\n&gt;6. How many riflemen did lords have at their disposal? I know this\n&gt;depends on the lord, but if you guys know of examples...\n&gt;\n&gt;Miburo Sam\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet 10MB of e-mail storage!
