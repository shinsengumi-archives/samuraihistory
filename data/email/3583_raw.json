I fully appreciate that the issue\n&gt; of the re-institution of the samurai, or their\n&gt; continued functioning presence within modern\n&gt; Japanese society is impossible, even irrational, and\n&gt; the argument is based upon using a great deal of\n&gt; &quot;what ifs&quot;, but is that a reason for those who have\n&gt; contributed to be told to &quot;give up&quot;?? \n\nYES, IT IS!!!! You want a tirade, I&#39;ll give you\none--and it&#39;s not necessarily directed at YOU, per se,\nbut come on--do YOU ENJOY PUTTING UP WITH IDIOTS? I\nsure don&#39;t. Everyone has a right to their thoughts, no\nmatter how stupid they may be. That doesn&#39;t mean they\nare welcome to inflict them on us TIME AND AGAIN. If\nyou&#39;ve been here for several years, you know darn well\nthis comes up over and over. It&#39;s FRICKING\nRIDICULOUS!!!! I&#39;m not going to encourage someone to\nbe stupid--I&#39;m going to tell them like it is. YOU\nCANNOT BECOME A SAMURAI. SAMURAI NO LONGER EXIST.\nSAMURAI IS NOT A &quot;STATE OF MIND&quot;. It was a SOCIAL\nCLASS THAT WAS LEGISLATED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN THE LATE\n1800&#39;S. END OF STORY!!!! &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
