Do you practice any\n &gt; Japanese Sword Martial Art ???   \n &gt; A real samurai never killed another person just\n &gt; because.   There was always a reason and certanly he\n &gt; never stain the edge of his shinken with out a reason.\n &gt;   So he never kill as an assasin.   In previous Japan\n &gt; eras, Hitokiri were in their majority Ronin paid by\n &gt; someone to kill another person due to usually\n &gt; political reasons.\n &gt; \n &gt; And if some one wants to kill his self, please do not\n &gt; use Sepukku.   Sepukku is a ritual designed to give\n &gt; back the dignity of a person who falls in disgrace by\n &gt; showing that his blood is red (then pure, and no\n &gt; stained or black blood ).   \n \nOh dear.\n \nLook, samurai were every bit as human and corrupt as everybody else. I\nsuggest you throw your copy of Hagakure in to the fire and buy yourself\nsome history books.\n \n-AngusH \n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
