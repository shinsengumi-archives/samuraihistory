I&#39;m researching the Shimabara Rebellion, \nparticularly in regard to the interaction between the samurai&#39;s lifestyle/beliefs and his newfound \nChristian faith. Sort of comparable, I suppose, to the Roman Legionnaires that converted in the \n3rd century (before Xianity was legal in Rome). I&#39;m trying to find out to what extent the rebellion \nwas religiously motivated, and how they justified their rebellion (what was the 17th century \nJapanese Christian&#39;s &quot;Just War Theory&quot; - or something along those lines). And just all kinds of \ngeneral stuff... like what were the common misconceptions of Christianity that the anti-\nChristian Japanese had. (The Romans thought they were atheists and cannibals). And to what \nextent was the oppression that prompted the rebellion religiously motivated versus nationally \nmotivated (anti the religion versus anti the foreigners... in defense of Japanese religion versus \nin defense of governmental Japan... though there&#39;s probably a mix of all these motivations...) \nWhat role did the Jesuits play in the rebellion? Etc, etc...\n\nWhich, anybody that has suggestions for books to read that deal with these ideas or \nparticularly the Shimabara Rebellion, I&#39;d love your suggestions. Just started researching the \ntopic, so I&#39;m pretty ignorant of the details. Found some websites, but don&#39;t know the good \nbooks to read. Anything I get I&#39;ll have to order, since my bookstore carries NADA dealing with \nJapanese history.\n\nDan.\n&gt; Dear Dave, Tom, Karsten, Tim, Jake, Luis, Edy, Thom, Nate et al ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Many many thanks for all of your posts. \n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly, to the others who are offended because I brought up this\n&gt; subject, I am very sorry I did not mean to preach to you, convert you \n&gt; or convince you into my beliefs. No person can do that. Again, I am \n&gt; very sorry. \n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, to those who were eager to help me with such beautiful\n&gt; material (eg top 10 misconceptions, Christian samurais) I am extremely\n&gt; grateful.  Thank you so much! I&#39;m learning a lot from you guys. I will\n&gt; check out the sites and the info you&#39;ve given me and will hope to share\n&gt; what I think of them in the  near future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thirdly, I was able to get hold of a copy of the book &quot;A Higher Honor&quot; by\n&gt; Robert Boardman. I&#39;ve just read through the preface and it looks like a highly\n&gt; enjoyable read! The author used to fight against the Japanese army until\n&gt; he was sent back to the land of the rising sun in a different capacity and he\n&gt; wrote about the honor and commtiment of the people who used to be his enemy \n&gt; but whom he has now come to love.\n&gt; \n&gt; Domo arigato!\n&gt; \n&gt; Carmen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ===========================================\n&gt; Yeah,christians could learn a lot from Bushido.They could be braver.....Edy\n&gt; \n&gt; ====================================\n&gt; Hi Carmen.\n&gt; \n&gt;  If you&#39;re new to this subject (as I also am) I would sugest &quot;The top 10\n&gt;  misconceptions of the samurai&quot; -\n&gt;  http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\n&gt; \n&gt;  That certainly cleared some things up, like the bushido code for\n&gt;  example.   ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Luis\n&gt; ======================================\n&gt; Brave men and cowards alike, exist in all religions. Many samurai and followers \n&gt; of bushido \n&gt; were christians, some of which died very bravely for their religion........\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt; \n&gt; ======================================\n&gt; Carmen et al-\n&gt; \tIf christians have lots to learn from Samurai, then I would suggest \n&gt; they could learn it ALL from Christian Samurai. I would examine the \n&gt; history of christianity in Kyushu and the lives of the Christian \n&gt; Daimyo, sounds like a natural subject for your interests...\n&gt; -t\n&gt; =====================================\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Carmen,\n&gt; please keep in mind that bushido was only what people made out of it. First\n&gt; of all its a rather hollow shell and it depends on what you do with it.\n&gt; Otherwise it�s just an ideal that some reached and some didn�t.\n&gt; Remember also all the bad things that happened when certain people called on\n&gt; the bushido &gt; WWII is only one example...\n&gt; \n&gt; Karsten Helmholz\n&gt; Germany\n&gt; \n&gt; =======================================\n&gt; Hey.\n&gt;        I was thinking about this as I read some of the posts on this topic.  \n&gt; It seems that there are at least one or two very large similarities between \n&gt; Christianity (which I am by no means an expert on) and Bushido (99.9999% of my \n&gt; knowledge of which came from this list).  Both call for unquestioned service to \n&gt; a (L)ord and both have followers very willingly giving their lives for that \n&gt; (L)ord if and when the need arises.  It&#39;s just a matter of the direction.  \n&gt; Bushido, the lord is a human one.  Christianity, a spiritual One.  I do agree \n&gt; that \n&gt; many (most?!) Christians could learn to be braver through studying Bushido, \n&gt; though, myself included.  That Christian samurai were willing to give their \n&gt; lives for either (or both) of their (L)ords is testament to how devoted they \n&gt; were \n&gt; to their religion and to their code, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.\n&gt;        Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; L8r.\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; =======================================\n&gt; Hey Carmen,\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are some prominant Christian Samurai that I know\n&gt; of:\n&gt; Otomo Sorin\n&gt; Kuroda Yoshitaka\n&gt; Arima Harunobu\n&gt; \n&gt; Also check out the Shimabara Rebelion 1637-1638\n&gt; \n&gt; Also though there may have been Christain Samurai,\n&gt; Christianity was viewed as a potential threat(foreign\n&gt; powers namely the Portuguese) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi\n&gt; and the Tokugawa Shogunate. Their crack down on\n&gt; christianity wasn&#39;t so much hatred toward christains\n&gt; as much as eliminating a disruptive force. The\n&gt; samurai(Oda Nobunaga) also cracked down on the Buddist\n&gt; Ikko Sect for the same reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jake\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
