Most of the news groups and \n  web-based discussion boards that discuss &quot;Japan&quot; are hopeless. \n  They basically seem to be structured flame wars. The few fj. \n  newsgroups that deal with history tend to focus on discussions of more \n  recent history. So I&#39;m really happy to have stumbled upon this mailing\n  list. I actually found it by visiting the home page of samurai-archiv\n  es.com - which I normally don&#39;t do, because I usually hit particular p\n  ages via web searches.\n\n  I am an amateur student of Japanese history. That is to say I don&#39;t \n  have any particular expertise or academic qualifications on the \n  subject - and it also means I have a day job. :)\n\n  My interest within Japanese history are pretty wide. I&#39;ve been \n  interested in the late-Bakufu/Meiji Restoration period and the Heian \n  Period. Mostly political and military history. These days my focus \n  is on the Sengoku Jidai. Particularly I&#39;ve become fascinated with Oda \n  Nobunaga.\n\n  I look forward to asking lots of questions on the forum. Maybe \n  once in a while I&#39;ll be able to answer one, too.\n\n  Thanks and \u001b$B$h$m$7$/$*4j$$$7$^$9!#\u001b(B\n\n  --\n  Jay Kelly\n  oyakata@...\n\n\n\n  ---\n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  --- \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Yahoo!
