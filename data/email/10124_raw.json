(Hence the fact that Shinto shrines are such a common  \nfixture in so many Buddhist temples).\n \nI got the impression that this changed substantially during the Meiji  \nrestoration and into WWII, when the government pressed the notion of the  \nImperial lineage (the descent from Amaterasu-o-Mikami) as evidence that Japan  was \nunder the unique protection of the gods / kami, as a result of which a very \n strict separation of church and state was written into the post-war  \nconstitution...\n \nAm I missing anything substantial here?  My personal experience of  Japan \nwas that the temples and shrines were largely appreciated for their  historic \nnature; I seldom saw religious ceremonies going on (apart from New  Year&#39;s \nDay, when people arrived, made their offerings, and departed) the way I  did \nin Korea, for example.  (BTW -- I don&#39;t mean this as any sort of  judgment, \nmerely an observation...)\n \n--RMB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
