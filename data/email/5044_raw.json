As to Basho, I&#39;m guessing\nthat the &quot;he slept here&quot; phenomenon is connected to the fact that he appears\nto have been a popular travel writer.  _Narrow Road_ reads like kind of a\npre-photographic travelogue. (Granted that woodcuts were in vogue; still,\nyou can&#39;t have every view [for example] of Fujiyama on your walls.)\n\t\tGereg\nMessage: 9\n   Date: Mon, 2 Aug 2004 19:33:24 -0700 (PDT)\n   From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\nSubject: RE: Digest Number 889 - more suicide notes (so to speak)\n\n\n--- Silk Road School &lt;silk.road.school@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n\n&gt;               Damn, was that Basho?  I&#39;d completely forgotten\n&gt; that.  That was the only\n&gt; Japanese poet whose name I could remember, and I\n&gt; didn&#39;t think it was he.\n\nYup, that was him. I haven&#39;t read it, so I just know\nhe wrote it, and the only other thing I remember about\nhim is that he wrote the &quot;frog/pond&quot; haiku that is so\noften quoted. That, and he seems to be the &quot;George\nWashington&quot; of Japan, in the sense that there seems to\nbe a &quot;Matsuo Basho slept here&quot; sign in every corner of\nthe country.*snip*\n\n&gt; Murakami Haruki, OTOH...\n&gt;               A name with which I am unfamiliar (one of many, as\n&gt; is obvious by now).  Do\n&gt; tell!\n\nMy favorite Japanese author--modern work, not anything\nto do with samurai or anything, though I think a\nhistorical wourk by him would be absolutely hilarious.\nRanges from absurdist (&quot;A Wild Sheep&#39;s Chase&quot;, &quot;Dance\nDance Dance&quot;, &quot;Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of\nth World&quot;) to the poignant mid-life crisis tale with\njust a touch of the absurd (The Wind-up Bird\nChronicle, Norwegian Wood, South of the Border, West\nof the Sun, Sputnik Sweetheart...)\n\n&quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot; rivals Miyabe\nMiyuki&#39;s &quot;All She was worth&quot; for my favorite book of\nall time.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"
