Being Japanese doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re required\nto commit seppuku.\nA legitimate point, to be sure.  But by way of background, my father used a\n.30-06 on himself as a way of redeeming his honour (an oversimplification,\nbut pretty accurate), and it&#39;s left me with a profound distaste for that\nmethod of departure.  I watched my mother deal with the emotional\nconsequences of the act for another ten years.  So I&#39;ve looked at the idea a\nlittle more intimately than most gaijin, I think, and my personal belief is\nthat there are better ways to go, no matter what the problem.  I feel - and\nit is strictly my feeling - that it&#39;s better to stand back up again and go\non, trying to heal one&#39;s honour in life, or (in warfare) to go down\nfighting.\nI compare Asano&#39;s seppuku in Inagaki&#39;s &quot;Chushingura&quot; with Mishima&#39;s - thank\nyou one and all for reminding me of his name - and in Mishima&#39;s I see a very\nhuman reaction to a degree of pain that I think excessive.  Within my own\npersonal structure of honour, and without slighting a number of very great\nmen who took this way out, seppuku is not a valid way of making a statement.\nWithout doubt it requires courage and immense fortitude (&#39;guts&#39; would be too\ncruel a pun), but by and large it still seems to me ultimately less\ncourageous than the ongoing effort to live and continue to grow, and to\nredeem honour in life.  Referring once again to &quot;Chushingura,&quot; I have more\nrespect for the bushi who elected not to die at once, but instead to make\ngood the pledges and debts of the han, than I do for Asano&#39;s inflexible\npride that took him to that end, at the cost not only of his life but of the\nlivelihoods of his samurai, his wife and children, and the commoners under\nhis care.  I regard power as properly an obligation, rather than a\nprivilege.  Giri - as I see it - requires a greater care for one&#39;s\ndependents.\nDon&#39;t mean to start a big philosophical argument, but you did ask why...\n\n\nYou&#39;re thinking of Mishima Yukio, the author. It\nwasn&#39;t at a television station, it was at Ichigaya,\nthe then military academy, now the headquarters of the\nJapan Defense Agency (think the Japanese Pentagon).\nI&#39;ve stood in the spot where he did the deed. It\nwasn&#39;t simply a protest, it was a botched and horribly\nfailed attempt to get the students to rise up in a\ncoup--they laughed at him, and he withdrew to attempt\nhis fairly botched suicide.\n\tThank you for the corrections.  Is it also incorrect, then, that the act\nwas filmed?  I had understood this to be the case.\n\n\nMessage: 8\n   Date: Sun, 01 Aug 2004 01:09:38 -0500\n   From: &quot;Anthony J. Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Re: on suicide...\n\n Seppuku is considered a more genteel and less plebean or vulgar term.\nCompare\nthe use in English of some French terms instead of regular English. Some\nexamples: &quot;mutton&quot; to replace the good old Anglo-Saxon &quot;sheep meat&quot;; &quot;It has\na\ncertain &#39;je ne sais quois&#39;&quot; rather than &quot;it has a certain &#39;I don&#39;t know\nwhat&#39;&quot;;\nor &quot;that was its raison d&#39;�tre&quot; rather than &quot;that was its reason for being.&quot;\n\nTony\n\n\tOf course in the case of &#39;mutton&#39; vs. &#39;sheep meat,&#39; we have the Norman\nconquest to consider as well.  Englishmen were growing the sheep, but it was\ntheir Norman masters eating it:  so with &#39;cow&#39; and &#39;beef&#39;, &#39;sheep&#39; and\n&#39;mutton&#39;, &#39;pig&#39; and &#39;pork&#39;, we have the English term for the animal, but the\nFrench-derived term for the meat.\n\tThe comparison I&#39;ve made is between &quot;he ended his life&quot; and &quot;he blew his\nbrains out.&quot;  My understanding - notwithstanding my semi-flippant &#39;glad to\nbe gaijin&#39; comment - is that the peasantry didn&#39;t find the practise any more\nadmirable or comprehensible than many gaijin do, and hence used\n&#39;belly-slitting&#39; rather than a more polite term for the act.  Again, please\nfeel free to correct me.\n\n\nMessage: 11\n   Date: Sun, 1 Aug 2004 10:25:06 +0200 (MEST)\n   From: &quot;nattilla the nun&quot; &lt;nattilla@...&gt;\nSubject: RE: on suicide...\n\n&#39;&#39;An inglorious and messy end for a\ndedicated man.&#39;&#39;\nNo way!\n\tWith no disrespect intended, I&#39;ll stick to my opinion on this - I refer you\nto Nate&#39;s summary of the &quot;fairly botched suicide&quot;.  If you attempt to follow\nthe traditions of your ancestors in your departure, and those traditions\ncall for a calm and composed reaction to horrible pain, while your emulation\nof the act results in being unable to hold still enough to do it with style\nand grace, then I think my description pretty accurate.  Note that I do not\ncriticise his honour:  but I cannot think that Mishima meant to make his\nexit so different from the calm and resolute endurance that seppuku is\nsupposed to entail.  I would have wished him a better ending, for it is\napparent that it meant a very great deal to him.\n\n\n&#39;&#39;This is one of those things that makes me intensely glad to be a gaijin,\n&#39;&#39;\nMishima is the person who makes me regret mostly that I am a gaijin.\n\n\tOf all the people in Japanese history who have evoked that feeling in me, I\nconfess that Mishima is not on the list.  Musashi, yes.  Hidetsuna, yes.\n(He&#39;s the one who reportedly shaved his head to rescue a peasant child,\nscorning class privilege and social rank, in the episode Kurosawa borrowed\nfor &quot;Seven Samurai.&quot;)  Hiroshige and Hokusai, yes.  Mifune, yes again -\nbecause only in Japan, I think, can you have one of your great dramatic\nactors in the same person as one of your leading action stars:  Spencer\nTracy and John Wayne in one, so to speak.  The poet who wrote _The Narrow\nRoad to the Far North_, even.  (Yet another name I&#39;ve forgotten over the\nyears.)  Again, this is not meant to criticise you.  What is it about\nMishima that affects you so, if I may ask?\n\n\n &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Has nothing to do with the weapon being used.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Unless the blade is really dull, in which case it would be � &quot;j��.\n&gt;\n&gt; :P\n\nhara-yaburi -- � &quot;j�� - Which didnt seem to transfer well.  I tell\nya, yahoo can put a real damper on jokes sometimes.\nPerhaps, but even with my pitiful smattering of Japanese, I got a chuckle\nout of it.  Mostly a matter of context.  &quot;Belly-bashing&quot; or the like, I\npresume?\n\nMy thanks to all of you who reminded me of Mishima Yukio&#39;s name, and\ncorrected my history.\n\n\n"
