Although the story in the film is significantly different from\n&gt; &gt; what actually transpired in 1877, I found a few themes to be common.\n&gt; &gt; First, the origin of the Satsuma rebellion was in the dissatisfaction\n&gt; &gt; of the samurai at the ending of their way of life. Secondly, as with\n&gt; &gt; Ken Watanabe in the movie, Saigo Takamori did indeed have deep\n&gt; &gt; respect for the emperor. Finally, the failure of Saigo&#39;s rebellion\n&gt; &gt; was partially due to the fact that he was fighting in an old Japanese\n&gt; &gt; style, while the Meiji government had westernized their methods.\n&gt; &gt; However, it was not really western weapons versus Japanese weapons on\n&gt; &gt; the battlefields of the Satsuma rebellion, since both sides used\n&gt; &gt; guns. Rather, the Meiji government made much better use of western-\n&gt; &gt; style logistics (reinforcements) and communications (the telegraph).\n&gt; &gt; The Meiji government was able to get Saigo bogged down in Kumamoto,\n&gt; &gt; while they sent in reinforcements and eventually overwhelmed him at\n&gt; &gt; Tabaru-zaka.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Joe et al -\n&gt;\tWe are talking about the modern period (post 1868) and we are still\n&gt;talking about that silly movie, but I hope the moderators will\n&gt;indulge us a bit longer. The Saga and other earlier rebellions were\n&gt;about the loss of privileges, really the loss of income as the\n&gt;government cut back on the stipends they paid out to disenfranchised\n&gt;bushi. Satsumas rebellion was started by students of the shigakko\n&gt;(most had never had Samurai status) who were convinced the central\n&gt;government meant to assassinate Saigo. They were of course joined by\n&gt;ex-army types that had come home with Saigo and others with a grudge\n&gt;against the new leadership. What I find interesting is that Saigo\n&gt;(and the new Meiji police forces) knew that if he were to reach\n&gt;Honshu he would have of course been joined by all those out of work\n&gt;samurai and would have been an unstoppable force. He could have\n&gt;easily skirted Kumamoto-jo or even taken an Eastern route to Dazaifu\n&gt;but chose not to.\n&gt;\tThis begs the question why did he insist on investing Kumamoto?\n&gt;Tabaru-zaka was not the decisive battle but it was 17 days of hard\n&gt;fighting where he spent much of his force. Was his loyalty to the\n&gt;Emperor, whom he raised from a boy, so strong that he intentionally\n&gt;fought a battle of attrition rather than risk actually threatening\n&gt;him and the government Saigo himself had set up for him to lead?\n&gt;Samurai pigheadedness is hardly an explanation for his siege of the\n&gt;castle.\n&gt;\tI agree that once they paused at Kumamoto the outcome was inevitable\n&gt;for the very reasons you cite above; Government logistics and\n&gt;communications. I would point out though that the fierce fighting at\n&gt;Tabaru-zaka is where the image of sword versus gun comes from.\n&gt;Because of the heavy weather and the thick bamboo groves there the\n&gt;government guns and numbers were ineffective. So much so that a\n&gt;special Batto-tai was formed of Aizu men who went in to fight sword\n&gt;to sword against the rebels. The weather broke and new artillery was\n&gt;brought to bear on the area breaking the Satsuma hold on the road,\n&gt;but it was only weeks later that the army broke up and all that was\n&gt;left was to chase Saigo and his little band back to Shiroyama.\n&gt;\tWhat drives me mad about this film and others is how Hollywood\n&gt;always feeds us entertaining tripe like this even though the real\n&gt;history is so much more interesting. And this story has so many great\n&gt;stories within it it is just amazing that they seem to have missed\n&gt;them all!\n&gt;Makes me want to throw my sword at someone...\n&gt;-t\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWindows Live Messenger - kivuttoman viestinnï¿½n puolestapuhuja. \nhttp://www.communicationevolved.com/fi-fi/\n\n\n"
