First he asks a vague \nquestion, which is fine. but he also later mentions that he has more \ninformation that he then refuses to release, which tells me he isnt \nvery interested in getting information.  The response that offended \nhim seemed pretty benign to me, but that is just my humble opinion.  \nRegardless, it makes sense to me that if you ask a question, you try \nto include as much information as possible, which he apparently \ndidnt do if he is now bragging about having other information.  \nAnyway, these groups are pretty easy, but not always a one way \nstreet. Just because you ask for someone to do your homework for you \ndoesnt mean they will do it willingly. People tend to want a reason \nto do you work for you. That was part of what I was trying to say.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@i...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Brothers,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regardless of your emotional state, this:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; is brutally vague in the extreme.  If you cant give a single\n&gt; &gt; detail more on this, or even where you found it, I can\n&gt; &gt; guarantee that no one will be able to help you...\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, granted the original presentation was far from scholarly, \nbut surely\n&gt; I&#39;m not the only one to (a) find it intriguing and (b) find a \nlittle bell\n&gt; ringing in my head, not from the Sengoku Jidai but from mid-Edo.  \nGranted\n&gt; the riposte from our original questioner was a far from measured \nresponse,\n&gt; but the replies from Dear List Owner and others whose name/s \nescape me\n&gt; hardly encourages anyone to ask any question at all, no matter how \nseemingly\n&gt; not PC for the eminent scholars on this list.  Reminds of the \nlampoons I\n&gt; have got...  So, why do I persist with this list?  Because I love \nthe\n&gt; subject matter and see it as an important adjunct to my sword \nstudies and\n&gt; collecting, and because the awesome knowledge of practitioners in \nthe field\n&gt; just takes my breath away.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can&#39;t we be a little less uptight on this list??\n&gt; \n&gt; Barry Thomas\n&gt; (Melbourne, Australia - just over the road from Jim Breen&#39;s campus)\n\n\n\n\n"
