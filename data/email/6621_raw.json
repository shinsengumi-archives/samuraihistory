Post-1590&#39;s, The\nonly requirement to be a samurai was to be born a\nmember of the samurai class. Very rarely, if ever, was\nsomeone granted &quot;samurai status&quot; as a reward for\nservice, etc, in the Edo period. Will Adams is an\nextremely rare case, even if you ignore the fact that\nhe wasn&#39;t Japanese. \n\nPrior to the Edo period, the line between Samurai and\nother classes was much less clear. Samurai could farm,\nand peasants could go to war, and some individuals did\nboth and could have been considered both samurai and\nwell-to-do peasant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
