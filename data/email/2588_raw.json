Face to\nface, the draw becomes an over hand slice to the\nopponents head. On horseback the opponent could be a\nfootmen thus lower than the rider. The initial draw\nwith the blade down would lead to a upward slice. \n\n--- Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perhaps the tachi was worn edge down so as to make\n&gt; space for the bowstring to be drawn and released?\n&gt; Just a thought I had, but I would think that a large\n&gt; katana tsuka would get in the way especially when\n&gt; shooting to your left,\n&gt; but then again I could be wrong. Timewise the katana\n&gt; was replacing the tachi at the same time that the\n&gt; bow was falling out \n&gt; of favor, thoughts anyone?\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Josh Wilson \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, November 19, 2003 7:31 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] TACHI\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Yes, the tachi can be used in fights.. it was\n&gt; originally developed as a cavalry sword.. the longer\n&gt; blade and more pronounced curve were designed to be\n&gt; used form horseback.. much like the western examples\n&gt; of a saber in comparisson to the rapier.. the tachi\n&gt; was worn blade down whereas the katana was worn\n&gt; blade up.. the difference was that when you drew the\n&gt; tachi from horseback, the first draw would be a\n&gt; slice.. and the katana&#39;s first draw would be a slice\n&gt; as well, if worn blade down.. as far as dates, it\n&gt; seems that the tachi may be a predeccessor to the\n&gt; katana, but I am NOT sure..\n&gt; \n&gt;   Wilson\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --\n&gt; \n&gt;   --------- Original Message ---------\n&gt;   DATE: Tue, 18 Nov 2003 01:31:43\n&gt;   From: &quot;Syun Ukiya&quot; &lt;squartzph@...&gt;\n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Cc: \n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;ve been wondering about the Tachi, its different\n&gt; from the usual \n&gt;   katana type sword. And bit elegant too in terms of\n&gt; looks. Can Tachi \n&gt;   be used in fights? And the timeline of the tachi\n&gt; co-existed with the \n&gt;   Katana or it came after the Katana?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Yahoo!
