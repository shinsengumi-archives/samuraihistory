Also there will be a talk on &quot;Reading Japanese inscriptions&quot;. This is again held in conjunction with the SHOGUN exhibition in conjunction with the Nikko Toshogu Shrine.\nAs museums are notoriously bad at the very specialised conservation and restoration of Japanese swords, with very few knowledgable experts in the field, it may be interesting to hear what they have to say, so I am considering attending.\nFor further info and to reserve a place, the tel no. is 0113 220 1985 from the UK.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
