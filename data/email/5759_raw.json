A dam fine contribution by yourself\ncausing much enlightenment.\n\nI wrote:\n&gt;&gt;Now the screw has been known for thousands of years, but all previous\n&gt;&gt;examples were carved from other softer materials like wood. The early\n&gt;&gt;iron and later steel screw had to be pains takingly built up around a\n&gt;&gt;core with a &quot;V&quot; sectioned piece of wire or bar. I know a guy who has\n&gt;&gt;done it, and it isn&#39;t easy at all. But once you know how.... BOOM!\n\nYou replied:\n&gt;This sounds confusing to me. Is it not one piece?\n\nEr sorry about the confusion, but nope, and\n&gt; Or was it cast? \n\nNope again. \n\nAs I understand it these early screws were made in two pieces, firstly a\nseparate spiral of V sectioned wire, which was in turn wrapped around\nthe cylinder of in this case the breach plug, and soldered/welded in to\nposition to form a screw; sorry, don&#39;t know how, neither an engineer nor\na metallurgist. But this was done so that the V shaped wire would engage\nto the inside face of the tube. Whether or not the tube was pre cut, or\nif the screw was self tapping, not being intended for removal I don&#39;t\nknow.\n\nSorry that I can&#39;t be of anymore help than that.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n(Dean Wayland)\n\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
