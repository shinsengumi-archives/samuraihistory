Osaka=\r\n, known for many things=97takoyaki, bargaining, \njaywalkers, and snoopy peo=\r\nple=97is also famous for its Bunraku. \n\nI was excited for a number of reaso=\r\nns. One of course was the bunraku \nitself. I&#39;d attended a small introductor=\r\ny seminar the day before by \na bunraku troupe showing how the puppets moved=\r\n and so on. It&#39;s not \nlike marionettes in the least. There is the head pupp=\r\neteer who \ninserts his hand into the body of the puppet [which is about 4 f=\r\neet \ntall] and controls the facial movements of the wooden head and the \nri=\r\nght arm. There are two underling puppeteers, one who controls the \nother ha=\r\nnd and hands props to the right hand the true underling who \ncontrols only =\r\nthe feet. I think the troupe said it takes about 10 \nyears of apprenticeshi=\r\np working on just the feet before you can \ngraduate up to left hand. A pupp=\r\neteer is trained in using only one \nparticular puppet and plays that role f=\r\nor his career=97such as the \nmiddle age man, young girl, married woman, and=\r\n so on. \n\nThe head puppeteer is the only one who shows his face while the \n=\r\nunderlings are dressed in black with black gauze covering their \nfaces to p=\r\nerpetuate the willing suspension of disbelief that in \nfact, they don&#39;t eve=\r\nn exist. As apprentices, their contribution to \nthe puppetering is consider=\r\ned anonymous, and only the master is \nallowed credit. [On a random note, on=\r\n Japanese TV game shows, you \ncan sometimes see a random prop guy going out=\r\n to hand something to \nthe contestants, and if that is the case, he wears a=\r\n black gauze hat \nthing covering his face. I wonder if it&#39;s a modern outgro=\r\nwth of the \nbunraku thing.] The troupe demonstrated a puppet crying, arrang=\r\ning \nher hair, and reading a letter, and all her gestures were so in \nkeepi=\r\nng with real human movements that it was really quite eerie. \n\nThe bunraku =\r\nplay I went to see was called Chushingura or, as it&#39;s \ntranslated in Englis=\r\nh, The 47 Ronin. It&#39;s based on a real incident \nthat occurred in Tokugawa J=\r\napan [1600&#39;s or so]. In the presence of \nthe shogun, it was forbidden to dr=\r\naw swords. A young nobleman was \nbeing bullied by an older courtier and was=\r\n so insulted he pulled out \nhis sword and attacked the elder. For violating=\r\n the rule, the \nyounger nobleman was forced to commit seppuku [ritual suici=\r\nde] while \nthe elder was unpunished. In order to prevent violence, accordin=\r\ng to \nthe laws of that time, whoever engaged in a fight, the attacker as \nw=\r\nell as the attacked both would be forced to commit seppuku. That \nthe corru=\r\npt elder courtier was not punished at all upset many \npeople. \n\nTo reinstat=\r\ne the honor of their lord and avenge his death, 47 of his \nloyal retainers =\r\nplanned, over the course of 2 years, an elaborate \nscheme to kill the elder=\r\n courtier. They avenged their lord&#39;s death \nand paraded through town with t=\r\nhe head of the elder courtier. All 47 \nwere forced to commit seppuku as wel=\r\nl. The play explores the initial \nstories of several of the 47, focusing pa=\r\nrticularly on the life of \nthe leader of the ronin [lordless samurai]. The =\r\nlead role was \nperformed by a master puppeteer who is in his 80&#39;s and was \n=\r\ndesignated a Living National Treasure. It&#39;s simply soaked in bathos. \nA kin=\r\nd of who can outdo who in self-inflicted suffering. By the way, \nthe above =\r\nsummary is of the play, not of the actual historical event=97\nwhich obvious=\r\nly differs from the play in many key places, for \nexample, the young lord w=\r\nho&#39;s death was being avenged, was in fact \nstupid and cowardly.\n\nThe story =\r\nhas been wildly popular in Japan ever since. It was made \ninto both a Kabuk=\r\ni and Bunraku play, and airs in dorama form on TV \nevery few years. Because=\r\n it has so many good roles, Chuushingura is \na good way for a TV station to=\r\n bring out and showcase all of its \nmajor actors. Every year, there&#39;s a Chu=\r\nushingura parade in the town \nof Yamashina [a little south of Kyoto] becaus=\r\ne that&#39;s where the \nleader of the 47 ronin lived. It&#39;s held on Dec. 14, the=\r\n day they \nfinally avenged their master&#39;s death. The parade was interesting=\r\n \nbecause it was just random people from the town of Yamashina dressed \nas =\r\nvarious ronin. You could see families in the crowd saying &quot;look, \nthere&#39;s d=\r\nad&quot; as men marched by in costume. \n\nAnyway, back to the bunraku. The puppet=\r\nry truly was enchanting. The \nstage is huge and elaborate, with layers and =\r\nlayers to indicate the \noutside, the outside of a building, and rooms insid=\r\ne, all of which \nthe puppets and puppeteers can pass through. In one of the=\r\n scenes \nnear the end, white confetti drifted down in just the &quot;outside&quot; \nl=\r\nayer to look like snow. On the right of the stage are chanters, who \nchant =\r\nthe dialogue much in the same way that Noh plays are done, \nexcept that it&#39;=\r\ns much faster than the elongated drawls of Noh. \nThere&#39;re also shamisen pla=\r\nyers who provide accompaniment for the \nchanters.\n\nA full Bunarku play is a=\r\n whole day-long affair. I was only going for \nthe second half of it, which =\r\nstarted at 4. I thought it would end by \n6 or 7 and then could eat dinner i=\r\nn and explore Osaka. It carried on \nuntil 9 pm. I really enjoyed Bunraku, b=\r\nut 5 straight hours of it \npushed me a little over the edge. It was a battl=\r\ne not to fall asleep \nespecially because I&#39;d stayed up much of the night be=\r\nfore reading \nthe English translation of the play. And so, my only experien=\r\nce of \nOsaka was the subway and the Bunraku theater! But fear not, I did \ne=\r\nventually explore Osaka, and will write it all up, probably several \narticl=\r\nes from now.\n \n\n\n\n"
