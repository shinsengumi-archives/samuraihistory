Probably because to me it \ndidn&#39;t really &#39;look&#39; like Japan - the mountains and scenery didn&#39;t \nlook right (probably because it was filmed in New Zealand) and the \nplot treated the &#39;samurai&#39; almost like a backwards indian tribe \nrather than any sort of politically or socially viable group - \ntaking the &#39;dances with wolves&#39; bit a little too far.\n\nIt was good pop fiction, but I dread to think how many people will \ntake it as pure history...\n\n\n"
