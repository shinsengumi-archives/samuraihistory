The\n&gt;definition of junshi, as I understand it, is the\n&gt;specific act of suicide (usually seppuku) committed by\n&gt;a retainer upon the death, natural or otherwise, of\n&gt;his lord.\n\nJunshi is a bit of a tricky word. It certainly holds the meaning \nthat you describe above. It also is used to refer to ritual \nsuicide in a looser way. It is my understanding - and I could be \nwrong - that the edict from Ietsugu was meant to stop all forms of \nritual suicide not just the one you describe.\n\n&gt;It wouldn&#39;t make sense to outlaw the act of punishment\n&gt; (i.e. seppuku) the bakufu used to punish it&#39;s own\n&gt;retainers. \n\nAgreed. Although I&#39;m not keen on Edo history, this has always been \nan interesting thing to me. It has always struck me that the Bakufu \noutlawed (or prohibited) seppuku, but felt comfortable making \nexceptions to the edict whenever the circumstnaces made sense. But \nmaybe I&#39;ve been interpreting the situation incorrectly?\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
