Thansk to all of those\n&gt; question and replies.

Instead, you have\nyour whole defensive line follow that one guy around,\nleaving the rest of his team&#39;s offense open. Overkill,\nsince the guy isn&#39;t all that good, really--and you&#39;ve\ngot guys missing in the areas where they could make plays.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
