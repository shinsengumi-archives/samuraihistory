The two that I \ncurrently own (the one previously cited and one I picked up today but \ndont have with me) basically say something to the effect of &quot;after \nthe death of Masatomo in 1491, Chachamaru killed his younger half-\nbrother and his (the younger half brother&#39;s) mother.\n\nOn the other hand, Japanese internet sources I have seen in the past \nmade it look like he was killed by Chachamaru.\n\n\n"
