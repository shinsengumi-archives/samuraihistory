Do you have any=\r\n suggestions where to\nstart?\n\nBest wishes,\nGyula Sofi\n\n\n2011/9/1 bbradf3021=\r\n &lt;BBradford1973@...&gt;\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not think it has b=\r\neen mentioned here, but for a few months my book,\n&gt; Hideyoshi&#39;s Korean Inva=\r\nsion, has been available. While this is a supplement\n&gt; for Killer Katanas, =\r\nit is still a valuable source for anyone studying the\n&gt; period.\n&gt;\n&gt; This bo=\r\nok deals with the Imjin War, fought between the invading Japanese\n&gt; and the=\r\n Ming and Choson Dynasties. Within the 90+ pages is Army organization\n&gt; and=\r\n game rules for the Ming and Choson Armies under KK2, game ratings for\n&gt; ov=\r\ner 120 Ming and Choson leaders, supplemental siege rules that introduce\n&gt; t=\r\nhe use of chinese siege engines, and seven scenarios withn maps and\n&gt; compl=\r\nete orders of battle: Chungju, Imjin River, 2nd Pyong-yang, Pyokje,\n&gt; Haeng=\r\nju, Chiksan, and Sachon. The book also includes Imjin War playing\n&gt; charts =\r\nfor KK2.\n&gt;\n&gt; A major part of the book deals with modeling the armies of the=\r\n period and\n&gt; contains seven black and white plates illustrating the appear=\r\nance of the\n&gt; Ming and Choson Armies, along with their flags. According to =\r\nan email sent\n&gt; to me from Kenneth Swope, even he can&#39;t wait to see the fin=\r\nished product.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nearly 10 years of research has gone into creating this =\r\nbook and much of\n&gt; the information inside it is being presented in English =\r\nfor the first time.\n&gt; While intended for use with Killer Katanas 2, the boo=\r\nk is by no means\n&gt; limited to these rules, and the information inside can b=\r\ne used for many\n&gt; other rule sets. This book is also valuable to any painte=\r\nr or modeler who is\n&gt; looking for uniform and flag information on the Ming =\r\nand Choson Armies of\n&gt; the war.\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, the book has been created w=\r\nith assistance from Stephen Turnbull\n&gt; and Kenneth Swope.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are in=\r\nterested send an email to BBradford1973@.... You can also\n&gt; find the bo=\r\nok under Heartbreaker28 at Ebay.\n&gt;\n&gt; Arrigato,\n&gt;\n&gt; Brian\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
