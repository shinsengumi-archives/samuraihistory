The\n&gt; Code of Bushido, which was a set of ten ideals for\n&gt; samurai set down for all with a sword to follow. I\n&gt; think they were given to someone by one of the Kami\n&gt; or gods/goddesses, but I can&#39;t quite remember the\n&gt; specifics. Go ahead and e-mail me if you need any\n&gt; more specifics on the subject. I spent a past life\n&gt; during some of feudal japan, and was alive during\n&gt; Sekigahara.\n\nPut the peyote down, and check yourself into rehab,\nplease. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
