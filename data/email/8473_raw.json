I did not think this to\n&gt; &gt; be true, but another\n&gt; &gt; friend said that before Adams arrived they were\n&gt; &gt; using arquebus, and that\n&gt; &gt; Adams had introduced the flintlock. Can someone set\n&gt; &gt; me straight please?\n&gt;\n&gt;Nope. The flintlock was introduced in Europe around\n&gt;1630\n&gt;\n&gt;From Wiki (though I hate to use them):\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;&quot;Flintlock&quot; is the general term for any firearm based\n&gt;on the flintlock mechanism. The type is now obsolete.\n&gt;Introduced about 1630, it rapidly replaced earlier\n&gt;types, such as the matchlock and wheellock, and\n&gt;continued in common use for over two centuries,\n&gt;replaced by cap and cartridge-based systems. The last\n&gt;major use of flintlocks in the Americas occurred in\n&gt;the first years of the American Civil War; however, a\n&gt;few guns of this type are still manufactured for black\n&gt;powder enthusiasts.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flintlock\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve read that some of the cannon from the ship Adams\n&gt;arrived on were used at Sekigahara, but I don&#39;t recall\n&gt;if this is myth or fact. However, I&#39;ve never heard of\n&gt;them being a decisive factor in any way. No other guns\n&gt;from the ship would have made a difference, as the\n&gt;Japanese had plenty themselves already.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tony, any more info on the cannon, Mr. Sekigahara?\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Tired of spam?
