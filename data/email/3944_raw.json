I \nbelieve this concept is a sort of fake conciencnesse created created \nby the people at the top to make loyal soldiers to die for their \nbattles battle. And in fact this &quot;honor&quot; is the most dishounarble \nthing to follow.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I believe the only honor is the honor to all of mankind and our \nfellow human beings. This honor includes not to kill another.\n&gt;   What does everybody else think?\n&gt;   Thanks for listening\n&gt;   Jonny\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Vladilen Blackthorne &lt;vladilen_blackthorne@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   I&#39;m new to this site and I do not know much about samurai. But I \n&gt;   hope I have found a group that does know. From what I know fromt \n&gt;   hesite and others is it is the perfect life. at least for me  to \ndie \n&gt;   for the word honor. I only wish I had been born about 250 years \n&gt;   ago.. So maybe I could have fought int he battle of Shiroyama.. \nand \n&gt;   died with the one thing I understand well I joined to learn  \nmore.. \n&gt;   So I guess.. hi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ---\n&gt;   Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;   Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;   --- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Yahoo!
