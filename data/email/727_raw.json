It&#39;s all in good fun, don&#39;t try to read\n&gt; too much into it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, here goes. I&#39;ve got many choices (and by the\n&gt; way, I&#39;m reading this as who would I wish to have\n&gt; the\n&gt; same circumstances befall me historically and try to\n&gt; live up to what they did. Good compromise?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Being an ex-tanker, Patton is always a choice...love\n&gt; that guy. Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse, just to see\n&gt; Custer&#39;s face as an arrow went through his\n&gt; head...(despite my being a member of 7th Cavalry\n&gt; Regiment...Garryowen in Glory) Maybe MacArthur or\n&gt; Ridgeway, to see the Korean War ended right, unlike\n&gt; the situation now. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d have to say my top choice would be Oda Nobunaga,\n&gt; and not just because we&#39;re on the Samurai list. What\n&gt; a\n&gt; fascinating man! I&#39;d love to walk in his shoes for a\n&gt; little while, see what went on in his mind. He, in\n&gt; my\n&gt; mind, was the absolute master at integrating\n&gt; tactical,\n&gt; operational, and strategic levels of warfare. Just\n&gt; to\n&gt; glimpse into his decision making process, his\n&gt; analysis, his IPB...wow. I&#39;d say Hashiba Hideyoshi\n&gt; would be another good choice--not Toyotomi, but\n&gt; Hashiba Hideyoshi, so I could examine his\n&gt; commander/subordinate relationship with Nobunaga,\n&gt; and\n&gt; figure out why these two opposites worked so well\n&gt; together. \n&gt; \n&gt; Just my two yen...it is a rather silly, yet\n&gt; interesting question. C&#39;mon, Tony...don&#39;t be so\n&gt; analytical!!!! \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!

Second, I have Native\nAmerican blood in my heritage or family tree.\n         You also mentioned Patton; its odd but when\nmaking my choices I too thought of Patton; maybe its\nbecause George read the book written by Rommel on Tank\nWarfare.\n        As I&#39;m writing this, another military leader\ncomes to mind- Maj. Greg Boyington of the &quot; Black\nSheep Squadron&quot;.- the tv series left out that right\nafter becoming an ace he was shot down and spent most\nof his time in Japan in a POW camp; it wasn&#39;t until\n1945(?) that he was released.\n        I watched an interview of Major Boyington; in\nreal life he looks more like Sly Stone with glasses or\nmaybe Clark Kent without the uniform ( I think you get\nthe picture) than Robert Conrad, ( the guy from the\nseries WiLd Wild West).\n         Write back and let me know what you think;\nany way keep in touch it seems we have a lot in\ncommon.\n         Shadow\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
