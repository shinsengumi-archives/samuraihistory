Thnx, in advance (and thnx to everyone else who&#39;s written\n&gt;and recommended books/offered clarification).\n&gt;\n\nCan&#39;t be sure which was meant here, but the classic (if a bit dated) is by \nGeorge Sansom.  It is three volumes, the third of which deals with the \nperiod that you are concerned with (1615-1868?).  It is a very nice piece of \nnarrative history and useful as a ready reference.\n\nShannon\n\n&gt;X-Sender: sjcarpediem@...\n&gt;X-Apparently-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, andrea Smith\n&gt;&lt;andjoysmith@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yeah, I watch the anime Runouni Kenshin on TV and I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; also read the biography of Sakamoto Ryoma.
