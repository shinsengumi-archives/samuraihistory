Is allowing for left-handedness \n&gt; a modern practice?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a designer, and being right-handed is a disadvantage! Left\n&gt; handedness is supposedly a sign of creativity (left brain/right brain \n&gt; thing). Whilst I am partially ambidextrous the only &#39;benefit&#39; I know \n&gt; is an absolutely crap sense of direction!\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\n---\nMirumoto Kojiro\nThe Isawa&#39;s Pet Dragon\n\nIn my strategy, the training for killing enemies is by way of many contests, fighting for survival, discovering the meaning of life and death, learning the Way of the sword, judging the strength of attacks and understanding the Way of the &quot;edge and ridge&quot; of the sword. \n\n--Miyamoto Musashi\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nBuy the perfect holiday gifts at Yahoo!
