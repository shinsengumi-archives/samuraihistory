It&#39;s the only castle still owned by a\n&gt; private\n&gt; &gt; family, and is one of the few that are still\n&gt; original\n&gt; &gt; (most were bombed out in WWII) and is the only one\n&gt; &gt; that is original AND predates the Tokugawa period,\n&gt; &gt; having been constructed in the late 1400&#39;s. \n&gt; \n&gt; Not just any private family... the castle is owned\n&gt; by a descendant of the family \n&gt; that governed it through the Edo period --\n&gt; Naruse-dono. It&#39;s one of my favorite \n&gt; castles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
