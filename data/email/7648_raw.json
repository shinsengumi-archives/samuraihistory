The most ambitious exhi=\r\nbition so far held in Koldinghus \nMuseum, presented under the patronage of =\r\nHis Royal Highness Crown \nPrince Frederik of Denmark, has been prepared in =\r\nconjunction with \nthe National Museum of Denmark and displays a large numbe=\r\nr of \nJapanese artefacts such as Samurai equipment, kimonos, paintings, \nwo=\r\nodcuts and refined craftwork. The exhibits are lent by museums in \nDenmark =\r\nand abroad, and some of them come from the historical museum \nin the Japane=\r\nse town of Anjo, which is Kolding&#39;s twin town. \n\nJapan has an unusual and f=\r\nascinating history, and the Edo period is \nconsidered to be an era of cultu=\r\nral blossoming in which the art and \nculture of the elite spread to large s=\r\nections of society. The \nexhibition provides a rare insight into many of th=\r\ne old traditions \nthat have continued to play a major role in modern Japane=\r\nse society. \nStories about the Samurai concept of honour and images of the =\r\n\nbeautiful courtesans of the Edo period are enduring picturesque \ncomponent=\r\ns of our knowledge about Japan. The exhibition will be \nshown from 20 Augus=\r\nt 2005 until 8 January 2006. \n\nhttp://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.a=\r\nsp?\nint_sec=3D2&int_new=3D14680\n\n\n\n"
