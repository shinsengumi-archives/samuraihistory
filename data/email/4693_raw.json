I&#39;m a\nhistory junkie from a family of history junkies, and when I have a student\npractising kenjutsu, I want it to be understood in a larger cultural\ncontext.  My main obsession - my own Way - lies in the comparative study of\nsword arts from all cultures, and the ways in which the underlying\nprinciples manifest themselves in similarities and differences from nation\nto nation and blade type to blade type.\n(I found this list, for example, because I was looking for information on\n16th-century samurai clothing among the lower ranks of samurai - I want an\nolder style of hakama than some of the modern arts practise in, because\nexperience from other cultures&#39; historical clothing tells me the old hakama\nand dobuku will feel different to move in.)\nMy particular obsession in Japanese arts is Musashi Miyamoto, and the ways\nin which his Book of Five Rings represents both divergences from the main\nstream of Japanese martial practises (on the one hand) and the very essence\nof those practises (on the other).  So the Silk Road School practises (among\nother things) a great deal of nito technique based on my imperfect\nunderstanding and reconstruction of Musashi&#39;s niten ichi.\n...All right, not so brief as I&#39;d hoped.  But for me... pretty darned brief.\nI did not come here to advertise, so anybody with further questions, or who\nwants to take up the subject with me further, please feel free to contact me\noff-list.\nFor the moment, and with an eye toward moving back onto topic, allow me to\nsay that it&#39;s a great pleasure to find a list with so many well-informed and\narticulate contributors.  I&#39;m new here, and I&#39;m looking forward to learning\na great deal.\nGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
