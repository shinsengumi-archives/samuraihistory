I&#39;ve read the first five of them\n&gt; (Shinju, Bundori, The Way of the \n&gt; Traitor, The Concubine&#39;s Tattoo and The Samurai&#39;s\n&gt; Wife) and they&#39;re all great \n&gt; books from a story perspective.  (Someone like Tony\n&gt; could verify their historicity \n&gt; better than I.)\n&gt;        They&#39;re set during the reign of shogun\n&gt; Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (Shinju set \n&gt; in approximately 1689 through to 1691 as of\n&gt; Samurai&#39;s Wife).  About the \n&gt; biggest deviation from history -- and the biggest\n&gt; delight from a fiction standpoint \n&gt; -- is Sano&#39;s wife, Reiko, who is very much an\n&gt; ATYPICAL Japanese wife for the \n&gt; time period, although their marriage is the\n&gt; traditional arranged one and \n&gt; doesn&#39;t come until early in The Concubine&#39;s Tattoo. \n&gt; The rest of the series is \n&gt; Black Lotus, The Pillow Book of Lady Wisteria, The\n&gt; Dragon King&#39;s Palace and, \n&gt; coming out I believe in March, is the so-far-titled\n&gt; ninth book, The Perfumed \n&gt; Sleeve.  And yes, I plan to read them.  Rowland is\n&gt; of Japanese (I believe) and \n&gt; Korean descent.\n&gt;        Hope this helps!!!!!  8-D\n&gt; \n&gt; L8r\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
