I was\nspecifically thinking more of the established temples\nlike the Enryakuji, which DO have a daimyo (an abbot),\nDID have lands, etc. You&#39;re correct, the Ikko-ikki\nwere more a localized phenomenon that spread\nnationally, but they DID have a national HQ in the the\nIshiyama-Honganji, and a national leader in Abbot\nKenyo. I&#39;ll point out that once he surrendered to\nNobunaga, you don&#39;t hear too much about Ikko\nuprisings. \n\nI think Nobunaga did the only thing that\n&gt; would have really \n&gt; worked - wipe them off the map - because they had\n&gt; been independent \n&gt; and growing for so long, I doubt they would have\n&gt; bowed to anyone, \n&gt; hence the idle thought of a semi-theocracy - but not\n&gt; so much to teach \n&gt; and force religion, but just so that they could\n&gt; consolodate political \n&gt; power and thier own lands, profits, and holdings,\n&gt; etc.\n\nDid he wipe them off the map? I think they just\naccepted they weren&#39;t going to win. They continued to\nexist--apparently strong enough that Ieyasu had to\nmanufacture a split in the sect later on, hence the\nNishi and Higashi Honganji temples...\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
