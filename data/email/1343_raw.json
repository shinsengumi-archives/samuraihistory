The\nterrain was not conducive to a Takeda charge, the\ncombination of the Rengo-gawa river, the mud, and the\nOda positions in the foothills, combined with the\npalisade, made for a great disruptor. The effect with\nthe firearms was definitely a huge factor, but\nconsidering the Oda had the terrain advantage in\nADDITION to outnumbering the Takeda 2 to 1, I firmly\nbelieve that they would have won. Would it have been\nas lopsided? No, it would have been much closer. As it\nwas, the fighting was very fierce, and the Oda had\nover 6,000 casualties as it was. \n\n\n--- Edwin Angulo &lt;mayalan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi!!\n&gt; got a question: do you think that without the teppo\n&gt; could Nobunaga won the battle of Nagashino?\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; Edwin Angulo. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
