I htink Patrick\n&gt; needs to not only appologise for passing out\n&gt; inaccurate information but also needs to appologise to\n&gt; Tony of his bad language.\n&gt; \n&gt; Patrick, in case you dont know, Tony is a well known\n&gt; internationally published author on Japanese history,\n&gt; he is also recognised for his knwoledge and studies\n&gt; (and skills) with regards to making japanese armous,\n&gt; and I also believe a member of the SCA \n&gt; \n&gt; Paul\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\nHe has been banned, as will anyone else who can&#39;t control themselves \nhere.  Things have been getting pretty ridiculous and out of hand \nlately, and it is about time that the moderators start tightening \nthe chains again for a while until things get back to status quo.  \nThe moderators have the right to ban anyone they feel necessary, and \nwill do so without hesitation or warning. Let&#39;s keep everything on \ntrack - this is a &quot;Samurai HISTORY Forum&quot;, and flames will not be \ntolerated.  Furthermore, unless directly applicable to the Samurai, \nor Samurai history from the heian period on to the end of the 19th \ncentury, the purely martial arts posts need to stop.  Iaido, etc. is \nadmissable for conversation as that has direct roots in the topic at \nhand, but random martial arts conversations most definately don&#39;t.  \nLet&#39;s all try to get along and stay on track.  We look forward to \nmore questions and conversation relating to the Samurai and Japanese \nhistory.\n\nCarry on, \n\nSamurai History Moderators\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html\n\n\n\n"
