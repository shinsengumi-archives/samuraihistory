If\n&gt; general public acceptance, apart from \n&gt; law, would in all practicality make one a samurai\n&gt; (like commonlaw marriage or the Indian caste \n&gt; system), how much of the public would it take to\n&gt; justify that claim? What&#39;s the critical mass \n&gt; required for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent,\n&gt; because even in the samurai&#39;s heyday, \n&gt; there were people who didn&#39;t agree with the class\n&gt; system as it was. Maybe 51%? A simple \n&gt; majority? Who decides what the percentage would be?\n&gt; \n\nBut as previously stated, anyone who made the claim\nwould be looked at as if they had a certain appendage\nprotruding from their forehead instead of their fly.\nYou make a wonderful semantical argument that has no\nbasis in reality.\n\n&gt; All this to say, &quot;NO!&quot; Samurai DON&#39;T exist today...\n&gt; but theoretically, it&#39;s possible.\n\nIt&#39;s possible for me to be named King of Prussia, too,\nbut I doubt it will happen anytime soon. (I did go to\nKing of Prussia Mall near Philly, though, about a\nmonth ago.)\n\nNate\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool.
