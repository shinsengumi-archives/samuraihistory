Sorry, I have been corrupted by the &quot;westernization&quot; of \nninja, that&#39;s why I ask...although, now that I think of it, the Oniwa \nBanshuu in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; did dress &quot;normally&quot; (if the Gambit coat \nthat Aoshi used can pass as &quot;normal&quot;)...\n\nThis ninja stuff is certainly interesting, I would like to get rid of \nthe stereotypes.\n\nTHe Wolf of Mibu\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the main problem is that most of what is known\n&gt; as general facts about the ninja in th ewqest was\n&gt; promoted by members of the Bujikan in the early 80&#39;s \n&gt; - mis-translated from Japan, and also soe facts spread\n&gt; that was obtained from manga. the you also have the\n&gt; crap hollywood put out which people belived. Then 20\n&gt; years later when some people have done serious\n&gt; research to fix the problem you get sites like\n&gt; www.entertheninja.com sprouting up and sites made by\n&gt; 15 year old school boy wannabe ninja&#39;s and every one\n&gt; reads these and they must be real - I mean why would\n&gt; any one make a false web page.\n&gt; \n&gt; The truth of the matter is Iga and Koga were the main\n&gt; areas of development. some fo these &#39;clans&#39; did sell\n&gt; thesleves out per contract, then there were some\n&gt; schools that were created within a samurai domain and\n&gt; was either made up of samurai or peasents. picked for\n&gt; certain skills they had or were told to develop. many\n&gt; of these schools survived for several generation many\n&gt; were only in existance for a small number of years. \n&gt; \n&gt; some of them did have codes of ethics, some didnt.\n&gt; some used there skills to be cat burglers, after all\n&gt; some ninjutsu skills required the skill to enter a\n&gt; building and escape unseen. Then you have the ninja\n&gt; that were information gatherers. Kagemusha by kurosawa\n&gt; is a great film to see this. there is a scene where 3\n&gt; men are watching the samurai army. All dressed in\n&gt; common every day cloths watching from a distance. all\n&gt; from different clans. some of these guys couldnt even\n&gt; fight properly other than the same skills of the\n&gt; everyday man or samurai. and before any one asks.\n&gt; Ninja did not run around wearing black suits with\n&gt; masks. That is a Meiji period Myth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Look at a street scene out of a kurosawa movie.\n&gt; Imagine someone dressed in pure black in the middle of\n&gt; that. he would be as moticeable as if he were naked.\n&gt; the men in kagemusha are a good example of the way\n&gt; Ninja dresssed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some records by ninja have survived - Shoninki -\n&gt; Ninpiden - Bansenshukai. Translation example are\n&gt; available from www.ninpo.org\n&gt; \n&gt; paul\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- dnastaj &lt;dnastaj@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Weren&#39;t some ninja&#39;s (shinobi?) servants of hans? And\n&gt; they weren&#39;t \n&gt; all bad were they? They had a code of ethics, I mean,\n&gt; not engagment-\n&gt; wise, but they&#39;re based around a type of\n&gt; militia/guerilla tactics. \n&gt; Generally speaking, I don&#39;t think all samurai were\n&gt; honorable either. \n&gt; I&#39;m sure there must have been a handful of &quot;dirty&quot;\n&gt; samurai.\n&gt; ;) Dustin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Masamori\n&gt; Masami&quot; \n&gt; &lt;oni_shogun@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Generally samurai looked down on ninjas.

Since\n&gt; discovering \n&gt; Rurouni \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kenshin we have been amazed at the attention to\n&gt; historical fact \n&gt; &gt; &gt; involved with this series. We have just started\n&gt; becoming \n&gt; &gt; interested \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the Samurai histories but can find no info on\n&gt; this group of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; misunderstood Samurai. Any help will be\n&gt; appreciated and \n&gt; &gt; reciprocated. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kei and I are somewhat of an expert on anime in\n&gt; general and \n&gt; Lovely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Angels/Dirty Pair in particular as well as romanji\n&gt; script in \n&gt; &gt; Japanese \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and its English translations.
