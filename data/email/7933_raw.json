But however, fiction has inspired me to read \nand \n&gt; explore and even hear this arguments out. Because of the two sides here it \n&gt; makes history as a whole I guess that much more real. Hmm. In any event, I \n&gt; lived in Japan for almost 3yrs and tried to visit every musume and castle I \n&gt; could but didnt even know enough Nihongo to know that being a samurai was \n&gt; abolished. Isn&#39;t that something? Well most people here that have never been \n&gt; to Japan with out much historical studies get their based on historical \nfacts \n&gt; from anime and various movies? Its what started me out. There is a saying i \n&gt; have read once and dont remember from where it came but it goes like this: \nTo \n&gt; the novice all things seem posible; but to the expert not so much.\n&gt;  We have to start somewhere\n\nExactly. Watching films or reading novels can be an excellent starting-off \nplace to start studying actual history. \n\nNina\n\n"
