And that self same weapon (exa=\r\nct) was featured in Geena \nDavis&#39;s film &#39;Cutthroat Island&#39; which is where D=\r\nepp&#39;s &#39;Pirates&#39; \ntrilogy drew a lot of its stuff from. \n\nComments? Thanks f=\r\nor all the help and interest in Japanese history \ngang. SFN/SYS and Kami bl=\r\ness ya all. Toodles-K&K\n\n-- In animeontv@yahoogroups.com, &quot;keiman0&quot; &lt;Keiman=\r\nZero@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have just discovered that at the start of every Samurai=\r\n Deeper \nKyo \n&gt; eppy we are told the exact year the adventure began. Yuya i=\r\ns \n&gt; narrating and says something like &#39;the great war was ravaging the \n&gt; l=\r\nand and it is now four years since the great Battle of Sekigahara \n&gt; where =\r\nthe legend of Demon Eyed Kyo was born etc&#39;. Well that battle \n&gt; was in 1600=\r\n so SDK is set in the year 1604. Now in 1545 firearms \nwere \n&gt; introduced i=\r\nnto Japan so Yuya and Megeira are not violating any \nlaws \n&gt; yet albeit Meg=\r\n&#39;s is futuristic in nature and Yuya&#39;s is a rare \n&gt; flintlock called a &#39;duck=\r\nfoot&#39; for its unique shape. If you&#39;ve ever \n&gt; seen the Geena Davis film &#39;Cu=\r\ntthroat Island&#39; (which was used as a \n&gt; drawing ground for pirate stuff whe=\r\nn Depp&#39;s Pirates trilogy was \ndone) \n&gt; there is a scene in it which shows a=\r\n genuine four-\n&gt; barrelled &#39;duckfoot&#39; flintlock pistol although the barrels=\r\n are \nlined \n&gt; up side by side rather than over each other in a triangular =\r\n\nformation \n&gt; like Yuya&#39;s gun. Megeira (BIG SPOILER ALERT)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; we=\r\nll he is a time traveller from the future- right? So he would \nhave \n&gt; a st=\r\nate-of-the-arts weapon, wouldn&#39;t he? Ever notice he resembles \n&gt; Kakashi Se=\r\nnsei from Naruto? I think so anyway. \n&gt; \n&gt; I mentioned that Megeira and Yuy=\r\na had not violated any Japanese \nlaws \n&gt; regarding firearms- yet. In 1615 w=\r\nhen the great NobuNaga (the real \n&gt; Shogun who united the clans after the c=\r\nivil war not the weirdo in \nthe \n&gt; Kyo series) came to power he did many th=\r\nings to pave the way for \nthe \n&gt; nation as it is known today but two key la=\r\nws he passed were to \n&gt; restrict foreign trade and visits and to ban all fi=\r\nrearms from the \n&gt; entire country and these laws stood for a few more centu=\r\nries too. I \n&gt; have since learned that he banned guns not because of their =\r\ndanger \n&gt; but because NobuNaga wanted to expound the virtues of the Samurai=\r\n \n&gt; blade (katana as a rule) and its noble tradition in Japan. \n&gt; \n&gt; Well t=\r\nhat&#39;s my two cents worth for today. Have a swell day hazu and \n&gt; Kami bless=\r\n you all. Toodles-K&K\n&gt;\n\n--- End forwarded message ---\n\n\n\n"
