I can&#39;t say w=\r\nasted, for in retrospect I learned much.  The Deputy will understand \nwhen =\r\nI say I am a former army field medic (and instructor), and former PLDC inst=\r\nructor.   The segue into those slots was natural for \nme, because of my upb=\r\nringing.  I had much to undo, as I was once a macho-smart-mouth brat who li=\r\nked control moreso than the usual \nperson, and had &#39;something to prove to t=\r\nhe men&#39;.\n\nIn my early years of Shotokan training I was engaged to a nidan w=\r\nho was an Angry Young Man.  My development of kumite skills was the \nresult=\r\n of regular &#39;training sessions&#39; by my intended mate and his friends.  I did=\r\n learn,  became tough, and as a purple belt (4th \nkyu) was capable of defea=\r\nting many who outranked me by a wide margin.  However, I may have had techn=\r\nique, but there was no peace, no \nserenity in my heart. That relationship d=\r\nidn&#39;t survive, thank the fates, and let&#39;s just say his anger and attitude h=\r\nas brought him \nno happy life.\n\nI&#39;ve had the good fortune to have excellent=\r\n tutelage and example set for me in several dear friends.   I don&#39;t know th=\r\nat I follow \n&#39;The Way&#39;, but I strive to be the same person from the core of=\r\n my being to what others see, and with my actions.  I try to be \nhonest, an=\r\nd act with integrity. I don&#39;t claim a permanent state of serenity, kindness=\r\n, dignity, or clarity of mind.  I have learned \nthe concept of &#39;beginner&#39;s =\r\nmind&#39;, and have been rewarded with teachers of all ages, cultures, and spec=\r\nies.\n\nI&#39;m grateful to be here, and look forward to learning more from some =\r\nvery fine people.  I may not be very knowledgeable, but if \nsomeone else be=\r\nnefits from my input,  the clich=E9 &#39;I am honored&#39; applies.\n\nObediently,\n\nL=\r\nizzie\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Silk Road School\nTo: samuraih=\r\nistory@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Friday, December 03, 2004 12:22 AM\nSubject: RE=\r\n: [samuraihistory] : History/Shotokan Re: new subject\n\n\n\nMilady (and there,=\r\n in oblique answer to an earlier question of yours, is a\ntelltale sign of m=\r\ny SCA days back in the &#39;70s) -\nI want to sincerely congratulate you on sayi=\r\nng the following rather more\nnicely than I managed to do, the last time he =\r\nbrought this subject up.\nYou&#39;ve covered much the same ground I did, and don=\r\ne it very neatly:  but\nsince you&#39;ve managed to express it so much more kind=\r\nly, maybe - just maybe -\nhe&#39;ll believe you.
