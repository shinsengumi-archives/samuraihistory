However, I didn&#39;t mind it at all.  Thought it was kinda &quot;funky&quot; - if a 63 year old bloke can use modern words he doesn&#39;t really understand...  Perhaps I should say &quot;kawai desu&quot;.  AND if a website builder goes to an enormous amount of work - ENORMOUS - he/she can choose their own &quot;language mode&quot; I reckon.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Boal, Nina \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, March 21, 2007 10:57 PM\n  Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] SAMURAI WEBSITE DISCOVERED...\n\n\n  Here is the proper link:\n\n  http://uk.geocities.com/rainforestwind/legends\n\n  Interesting site. Though they could have dispensed with the modern &quot;cool&quot; language i.e. &quot;Showdown In Old Tokyo&quot; (in the 47 Ronin section). Also, when you click on Miyamoto Musashi, you get some information about Sanada Yukimura (who was &quot;one heck of a guy&quot; according to the site).\n\n  Nina aka &quot;Wave Tossed&quot; \n\n  ________________________________\n\n  From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Barry Thomas\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 20, 2007 10:05 PM\n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] SAMURAI WEBSITE DISCOVERED...\n\n  James,\n\n  In your reply I notice a space between &quot;geocities&quot; and &quot;.com&quot; in the url address. This should not be there. Press and hold your left mouse button and run the cursor over that entire address line and copy it to the clipboard (press &quot;Ctrl&quot; and &quot;C&quot; together). Then paste it into your browser address bar (click to put the cursor there - the entire address bar should then be selected - then press &quot;Ctrl&quot; and &quot;V&quot; together to paste the address AND REMOVE ANY SPACES (I see another space between the &#39;i&#39; and &#39;n&#39; in &quot;wind&quot;). Then press &quot;Enter&quot; and it should work. It appears to have worked for others already. Please get back to me offline if this does not work.\n\n  Regards,\n\n  Barry Thomas.\n  (Melbourne, Australia)\n  . \n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
