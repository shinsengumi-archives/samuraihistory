She never told us kids til we were older \n&gt; and c=\r\nould understand.  The Japanese culture is ridden with many \n&gt; strange conce=\r\npts, my mother believes some really strange things.  \n&gt; But if I wasn&#39;t aff=\r\nected, I wouldn&#39;t be asking.  I do not believe in \n&gt; most things, but this =\r\nis not a joke.I also have 2 grown daughters \n&gt; that are affected by this cu=\r\nrse.  Also my brother and 2 sisters.  \n&gt; It&#39;s not possible for all of us to=\r\n have common ailments, all \n&gt; obtained in different manners.  I still have =\r\nfamily in Japan, they \n&gt; have come her to the states and the language barri=\r\ner is a true \n&gt; obstacle.  The ways of life that they have is so different =\r\nthan what \n&gt; we have here.  So don&#39;t make light of it, it just shows your \n=\r\n&gt; ignorance.  \n\nYes. Uh-huh.\n\n&gt; All I want is to know if it&#39;s possible to r=\r\neverse it.  \n\nHave you tried salt?\n\n\n\n\n"
