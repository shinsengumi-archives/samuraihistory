Were there \nother \n&gt; forms of executions practiced (apologies for the morbidity of \ntopic) \n&gt; other than seppuku, crucifixion?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, lots of them. Not so much during the Edo period where \n&gt; crucifixtion was the standard, but during the Sengoku period and \n&gt; before, the forms of execution were pretty much subject to the \nlocal \n&gt; warlord&#39;s whims. Just about anything was done...one of the most \n&gt; gruesome being one of the Saito clan boiling an enemy to death in a \n&gt; large cauldron (much like Lord Yabu did in Clavell&#39;s Shogun). This \n&gt; also happened to the notorious bandit Ishikawa Goemon. Another \n&gt; warlord (sorry, don&#39;t recall who) was buried up to his neck with a \n&gt; bamboo saw placed next to him and a sign inviting passersby to feel \n&gt; free to have a go at him (Clavell used this too, for Lord Ishida). \n&gt; Beating a man to death was common as was death during torture \n(which \n&gt; wasn&#39;t a planned execution, but just sped up the process).\n\n\n"
