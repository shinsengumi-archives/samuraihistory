However, in the West there is still a tendancy \n(although not always, and it seems to be decling slowly) for men, \neven when walking side by side with a woman, to walk on the side that \nthe road is on.  There may be others, but the explaination that I \nhave heard for this social phenomenea stems from the time in which \nhorses were used, and could easily go off the street and cause \nserious injury or death.  So there is a possiblity of some form of \nprotection with women walking a step behind a man (please don&#39;t flame \nme feminists :D).  \n\n\n"
