I read a story in a book of \nJapanese mythology that featured vampires that looked like children \nthat had a water receptacle in the top of their heads. As far as I \nknow, Japan didn&#39;t have legends of traditional western style \nvampires. I have read a few legends about the vampiric Death Ninja \nbut it seems they were written in the 20th century and were somewhat \nbased on Stoker&#39;s novel (sort of like what you see in the Hammer/Shaw \nBrothers film &quot;The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula&quot;...one of my all time \nfavorites).\n\n\n\n\n"
