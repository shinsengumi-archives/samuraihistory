They suggested habotai and silk taffeta. \n&gt;My question is, when I went to www.silkconnection.com, they had all \n&gt;kinds of weights for these two. They also mentioned that Habotai was \n&gt;good for scarves and lining, which sounded kind of odd to me since I \n&gt;wouldn&#39;t classify armor clothing and scarves together. \n\nIf &quot;habotai&quot; is a corruption of the Japanese &quot;habutae&quot;\u001b$B!!1)Fs=E\u001b(B, then \nthis could be right. Habutai is a kind of silk that is sometimes \nused in kimono, especially formal clothing like &quot;dai-mon&quot;.\n\nAs you know, hitatare or kosode is just a type of kimono with a \nparticular shape. The hitatare wasn&#39;t armor itself. Could it make \nsense that a heavier weight of a particular weave could be used for \nclothing and a lighter one for scarves?\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
