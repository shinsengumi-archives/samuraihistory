These elite warriors where called many\ndifferent things in many different records.  The terms\nthat we start to see arrising the most out of these\nrecors is &quot;bushi&quot; and &quot;Kyuba no Michi&quot;.  These two\nterms as far as I know are the main precursors to the\nfamed &quot;Samurai&quot; and &quot;bushido&quot;.  While there are many\nterms used to describe ancient warriors of Japan these\nappear to be the most common.  Samrai does come from\nthe meaning &quot;to serve&quot; and sybolized this idea\nthroughout the history of Japan.\n\nHumble words\n\nMusashi\n--- fifthchamber@... wrote:\n&gt; &#39;Samurai&#39; as a title comes from the verb &#39;Saburau&#39;\n&gt; (to serve) so presumably \n&gt; the point being made is that these men were moving\n&gt; up in control rather than \n&gt; being simply &#39;attendants&#39; to the nobility at the\n&gt; time. Although I am \n&gt; certainly not sure about this...Perhaps &#39;Samurai&#39;\n&gt; should be applied to the \n&gt; warriors of the Muromachi era onwards as their role\n&gt; here was clearly defined \n&gt; as being &#39;Vassal&#39; members of various clans, thus\n&gt; &#39;serving&#39; rather than \n&gt; &#39;uprising&#39; to control...But the point is uncertain.\n&gt; For me anyway! Sorry that \n&gt; I could not be more help!\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
