I knew that the dailect was very old and has \nchanged =\r\nin meaning or is forgotten.  Also people said that it could \nbe Chinese.  I=\r\n have a answer to your question (probaly with some \nembelishment) about the=\r\n pull strength.  It was problay about 20 \npounds stronger than when the yum=\r\ni was refined and made with the same \ncare as a sword i.e weight and balanc=\r\ne to the person and the like.  \nBut &quot;history&quot; shows of a samurai named Mina=\r\nmoto no Tametomo.  He was \na very large and powerful man.  They said that H=\r\ne ultimately provoked \nthe central government into sending an armada of twe=\r\nnty small \nwarships in an attempt to force him to pay.  As a gesture of \nde=\r\nfience, Tametomo decided to shoot a large, bulbed arrow over the \nbow of on=\r\ne of the ships, but it struck the wooden hull a few inches \nabove the water=\r\nline instead.  The shot was so powerful that the arrow \npenetrated both sid=\r\nes of the vessel, creating two gaping holes.  Sea \nwater poured in and the =\r\nship began to sink.  The sight of the warship \nbeing sunk by a single arrow=\r\n so frightened the other ships&#39; captains \nthat they retreated.  That was wh=\r\nat Japanese history said anyway.  \nAgain thank you for helping me.  I know =\r\nalot about Kyudo so if you \nwant to know more just let me know.\n\nTravis\n\n--=\r\n- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Takezo Getsu &lt;getsutakezo@...&gt; \nwrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Things like that have a=A0way of working=A0themselves out, so you will=\r\n \nprobably find out when you don&#39;t expect an answer.=A0=A0I would look at \n=\r\ndifferent dialects of japanese, some that have died out.=A0 Afterall, \nit h=\r\nas changed alot in the past few hundred years.=A0 It might even be \nan enti=\r\nrely different language.=A0=A0I actually have a question.=A0 What \nwas the =\r\naverage pull strength the war bow during the sengoku jidai? \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fr=\r\ni, 10/10/08, Travis Good &lt;mrtravisgood@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Travis Good &lt;=\r\nmrtravisgood@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Yumi\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yah=\r\noogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, October 10, 2008, 9:18 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI have an old yumi and I need help in translating its name. I have \n&gt; talke=\r\nd to many japanese people while I lived there. I talked to \n&gt; archaeologist=\r\n that I worked with over there and they could not \nafter \n&gt; researching for=\r\n months. I even contacted Tokyo University. They \nsaid \n&gt; that it was 364 y=\r\nears old when they looked it up on the imperial \n&gt; records of the imperial =\r\nbowmaker Shibata Sensi XX. They even said \nit \n&gt; was stolen about 200 years=\r\n ago. But they could not even give me the \n&gt; name or procounce it. Wether o=\r\nr not the story is true, I do not \nknow. \n&gt; But could someone please help m=\r\ne out in finding its name. I believe \nit \n&gt; has a soul just like a katana a=\r\nnd would like to honor it by calling \nthe \n&gt; yumi by its name. thank you al=\r\nl very much. Also I have been \n&gt; researching for about three years now. The=\r\n Yumi pictures are in the \n&gt; Photos under Yumi and Asano Family Clan Kimono=\r\n.
