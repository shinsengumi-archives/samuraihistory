You best bet \nwould be to save , your uk based so if clive picks this up he maybe able to help out. but like all good things you get what you pay \nfor. Personally buy a few books and learn what to look for in a good blade also check out the excellent sword display at the british \nmuseum. To cap it off better to invest in some good books on the subject and save for a better blade that way you wont get ripped \nof. james\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
