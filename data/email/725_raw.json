Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   My second choice, Erwin Rommel, known as the\n&gt; &gt; Desert Fox, again according to my research, was one\n&gt; &gt; of Hitler&#39;s smartest generals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Who had to commit suicide.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frankly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to be one of\n&gt; &gt; Hitler&#39;s *anything* regardless of his career.\n&gt; \n&gt; That was my thought...great general, top of the line\n&gt; operational commander, but I sure as heck would NOT\n&gt; want to deal with Hitler as my superior...it&#39;s bad\n&gt; enough some of the people I have to work with in the\n&gt; US Army.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry, these type of questions annoy me. &lt;G&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tony\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony, relax! It&#39;s all in good fun, don&#39;t try to read\n&gt; too much into it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, here goes. I&#39;ve got many choices (and by the\n&gt; way, I&#39;m reading this as who would I wish to have the\n&gt; same circumstances befall me historically and try to\n&gt; live up to what they did. Good compromise?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Being an ex-tanker, Patton is always a choice...love\n&gt; that guy. Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse, just to see\n&gt; Custer&#39;s face as an arrow went through his\n&gt; head...(despite my being a member of 7th Cavalry\n&gt; Regiment...Garryowen in Glory) Maybe MacArthur or\n&gt; Ridgeway, to see the Korean War ended right, unlike\n&gt; the situation now. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d have to say my top choice would be Oda Nobunaga,\n&gt; and not just because we&#39;re on the Samurai list. What a\n&gt; fascinating man! I&#39;d love to walk in his shoes for a\n&gt; little while, see what went on in his mind. He, in my\n&gt; mind, was the absolute master at integrating tactical,\n&gt; operational, and strategic levels of warfare. Just to\n&gt; glimpse into his decision making process, his\n&gt; analysis, his IPB...wow. I&#39;d say Hashiba Hideyoshi\n&gt; would be another good choice--not Toyotomi, but\n&gt; Hashiba Hideyoshi, so I could examine his\n&gt; commander/subordinate relationship with Nobunaga, and\n&gt; figure out why these two opposites worked so well\n&gt; together. \n&gt; \n&gt; Just my two yen...it is a rather silly, yet\n&gt; interesting question. C&#39;mon, Tony...don&#39;t be so\n&gt; analytical!!!! \n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
