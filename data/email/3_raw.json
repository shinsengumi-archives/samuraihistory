This updated version \nwill convert the Japanese Era names and numbers to the &#39;western&#39; year \nequivalents as well as the &#39;western&#39; year to the Japanese era name \nand number equivalents. It isn&#39;t case sensitive, and long &#39;O&#39; and &#39;U&#39; \nsounds can be written as either &#39;o&#39; and &#39;ou&#39; or &#39;u&#39; and &#39;uu&#39; \nrespectively. The Japanese &#39;N&#39; can also be written as &#39;m&#39; where such \na substitution would be logically possible. Apostrophe&#39;s can be \nomitted after the &quot;N&quot; or left in. Either way. \nThis version also corrected a few minor mistakes that came up in the \noriginal. Let me know if there are any problems with, or mistakes in \nthis version. \nCEWest\n\n\n\n"
