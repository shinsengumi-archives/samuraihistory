I don&#39;t know much about the period.  &quot;Why,&quot;\n&gt; then, you ask, &quot;are \n&gt; you on here?&quot;  I suppose I&#39;ll learn a lot by reading\n&gt; the posts, eh? \n\nWe&#39;re all here to learn. If we were all experts, what\nwould there to be to discuss? :)\n \nWait, I saw a movie\n&gt; with Tom Cruise \n&gt; in it... it was called, I think, &quot;Top Gun.&quot;  Samurai\n&gt; use F14s... \n&gt; no, &#39;fraid I&#39;m wrong.  It was a different movie,\n&gt; where he was on an \n&gt; island... ah, &quot;Far and Away.&quot;  No.  Wait.  I&#39;ll get\n&gt; it.  Was it \n&gt; called &quot;The Last Scientologist&quot;? (Yes, I know,\n&gt; you&#39;re all grinding \n&gt; your teeth... in unison... It&#39;s like when people\n&gt; think that Kate \n&gt; Blanchet in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; was a good representation of\n&gt; history for \n&gt; Tudor England.  And Ninjaburger.com is the end-all\n&gt; for learning the \n&gt; history of the Ninja, you know.  [See #3 below.])\n\nThis kind of sardonic humor could be most welcome...it\nis humor, right?\n\n&gt; I am\n&gt; assuming that \n&gt; because the forum is moderated, the ratio of dross\n&gt; to content will \n&gt; be very low, and that much of the content is going\n&gt; to be quite \n&gt; specific, rather than broad generalizations that we\n&gt; should all know \n&gt; because we read a book once in school.\n\nNow, now, you know what they say about assuming. Makes\na donkey out of you and Ming. And the Ming don&#39;t like\nthat. \n\nSome things are quite specific. Some things are very\ngeneral. And more things than should probably get let\nin, including inside jokes. I&#39;m trying to cut down on\nthose, but sometimes I just can&#39;t help it.\n\n&gt; 3.  Ninjaburger.com?  Even my pet, who has no\n&gt; opposable thumbs, and \n&gt; can barely remember or perceive beyond\n&gt; eat/excrete/sleep, knows this \n&gt; is a joke site.  \n\nYeah, but I bet if his ninjutsu sensei told him it was\ntrue, he&#39;d believe it. \n\n&gt; 5.  No, I&#39;m not doing a report on Samurai for school\n&gt; and need you \n&gt; all to do my research for me.\n\nLike the guy who posted right after you? :)\n\n&gt; 7.  No, I&#39;m not in the military, either, but kudos\n&gt; and thank you to \n&gt; those of you who are now serving.\n\nThanks.\n\n&gt; 9.  Samurai is spelled with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot; \n&gt; Samurai is spelled \n&gt; with a &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot;  Samurai is spelled with a\n&gt; &quot;u,&quot; not an &quot;a.&quot; \n&gt; (Thank you MS Word spellchecker.)  This should be\n&gt; good enough to \n&gt; keep Mr. Ledbetter mollified... but if I slip and\n&gt; spell it with \n&gt; an &quot;a,&quot; may I get a &quot;Get Out of Spelling Jail Free&quot;\n&gt; card, please?\n\nHmm...incorrectly spelling the main topic of this list\nIS a heinous offense, being as you can just look at\nthe email address and get it right. However, minor\nmistakes are acceptable--nobody is perfect. The issue\nis wilfull abuse of spelling, punctuation, and\ngrammar. If you slip and type &quot;samarai&quot; once, that&#39;s\nfine. If over the course of 5 emails you spell it that\nway 25 times, we have a problem. \n\n  I&#39;m\n&gt; sure I&#39;ll run into \n&gt; a good reading list somewhere on a recommended\n&gt; website \n\nwww.samuraiarchives.com has a great list. Start there.\n(This recommendation brought to you by\nwww.samuraiarchives.com)\n\nWelcome to the board!\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
