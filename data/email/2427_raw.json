I am new at this \nand could use a little guidence. when my father was young, (he&#39;s \napproaching 70) the japanese consulate gave him 2 samurai dolls as \nhe was the eldest son of the eldest son etc. decendant of 2 \ndifferent samurai. WWII came and he had to abandon most of his \nposessions including the dolls. He was sent to manzanar. I thought \nit would be nice to trace his history back to to those samurai and \ngive the info to him for his 70th birthday. Can anyone help me? His \nfathers name was will kumagai. thanks \n \n\n\n"
