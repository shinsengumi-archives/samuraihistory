It is very\nmuch a mans weapon.\n\nit was used by women when they defended the home.\n\nThe Sohei - male monks favoured the naginata, Kukishin\nRyu which was headed by the kuki family was founded by\nhaving a blade cut from a naginata, and the staff\nbeing used. The male line of the Toda ha Buko ryu also\nclaim the staff was created by a blade being broken\noff a naginata.\n\nIts a great weapon. I have an old one here at home as\nwell as several wood ones I use in my Kukishin Ryu\ntraiing and I am not a female.\n\npaul\n\n\n\n--- Edward Alexander &lt;edyhiphop@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nHow&#39;&#39;s about the Naginata???????It&#39;s a polearm and it\nwas mainly used by women.\n \nEdy\n\n\nAndrew Benton &lt;spearweasel@...&gt; wrote:\nWhich is why I said &quot;seems to be&quot;. ;D\n\nThanks for the information and the links.
