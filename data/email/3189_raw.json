Bet that was the last place the \nattacking Samurai would have thought to look, &quot;Tono, Hideyori \ncouldn&#39;t be in the elevator, it says &#39;in case of fire, use stairs&#39;!&quot;\n\n&gt; and besides it&#39;s better\n&gt; than Nagoya-jo (How many Daimyo had ELEVATORS\n&gt; installed????)\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n\n\n\n"
