What does this mean?\n&gt; A certain encyclopedia on japanese history said that Samurai emerged\n&gt; around the 10th century and became the ruling class around the 12th\n&gt; century. However, the chronology begins in 645. Does that begin before the\n&gt; samurai, or is the encyclopedia incorrect?\n\nNengo, or &quot;era names&quot; have been in use in Japan since the 7th century, when they \nwere introduced by the Court following the Chinese custom of era names. They \nchanged periodically due to some auspicious (or inauspicious) event. Since the \nMeiji period in the 19th century, era names have coincided with the reigns of \nemperors -- we are now in the Heisei era.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Japanese calendar and era reckoning, see my \ncalendar page on the Online Japanese Miscellany at \nhttp://www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany/index.html\n\nTony\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
