It has English subtitles \n(optional) and the best commentary track I&#39;ve ever heard.  It has \nalso been remastered, and looks far more crisp than any prior \nversion.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0780020685/104-4493474-\n3183960?vi=glance\n\nCriterion also did a new DVD version of &quot;rashomon&quot;, and that is not \nonly excellent, but it also has an English dubbed track that \n(shockingly) is perfect! (I almost always despise English dubbing on \nJapanese movies) So I&#39;d also recommend Rashomon from Criterion.  I \njust can&#39;t wait until RAN gets done by Criterion.  The existing DVD \nfor RAN is the most pathetic and disapointing DVD transfer I&#39;ve ever \nseen, no option to turn off the subtitles, and no quality \nrestoration for the picture or sound...!\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Howard Beasley &lt;howard@b...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;  Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know if there is a definitive version of the Seven \nSamurai to \n&gt; get on DVD (english subtitles), what it is and where to get it \nplease...I \n&gt; keep seeing versions with different play times on the websites \nwith R2 some \n&gt; 20 minutes short on R1 in some cases.  There seem to be several \ndifferent \n&gt; versions available although that may be the add ons rather than \ncuts for \n&gt; the different licencing regimes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was blown away the first time I saw this film...I have other \nfilms where \n&gt; there are clear cuts for violence which annoy me because they&#39;re \nso obvious \n&gt; and I don&#39;t recall them having been there before...eg in one film \na rider \n&gt; being toppled off a fallen horse is missing because they thought \nthe UK \n&gt; public would find it distressing....(it wasn&#39;t hurt apparently).  \nHe&#39;s \n&gt; shown getting up but the incident is missing here...but not in the \nUS.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t want my memory of this film to be tainted in a similar \nway...I&#39;m in \n&gt; the UK but have a Multi Region player.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Howard\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n&gt; Version: 6.0.495 / Virus Database: 294 - Release Date: 30/06/03\n\n\n"
