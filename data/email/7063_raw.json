Hatsumi taught Hayes\n&gt; everything he knows. That makes Hatsumi a.....?\n\nHayes a fraud. I agree with you, I just watched his\nBojustu DVD and I think he should be sued for what he\nsays in that DVD. Lie after Lie. Lets get one thing\nstraight - I know from your past quotes you know\nnothing really about The Bujinkan or Hayes or even\nHatsumi. Hatsumi did not Teach Hayes everything he\nknows, It has been discussed openly on Bujinkan forums\nand its been pointed out that hayes has fabricated a\nlarge amount of information, he is also credited with\ninventing the straight sword theory. \n\nJust because Hayes is in it does not mean it is bad.\nAgain if you havent seen it why attack it.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or ï¿½it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by\n&gt; &gt; the Budo Taijutsu?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend you see the film and train dogs, not\n&gt; &gt; martial arts. Not with a heart closed.\n\nVery insulting. Helly is a martial artist who so\nhappens to be in Budo Taijutsu, so what. I suggest\nthat you shut up , stop insuulting people you dont\nknow, stop insulting material you have yet to see. As\na moderator in this forum your behavior here is\ndisgusting. In the past you have told people to stop\nsuch behavior and here you are - the sole cause of all\ninsults.\n\nIf your noit interested in it you should just have\nsaid I am not interested in the Ninja,, and I\npersonally wont be watching it.\n\nI am quite shocked at your comments and behavior,\nespecially as you  are a moderator - not the what we\nwould expect.\n\nPaul\n\n\n&gt; \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
