I do find it interesting that you\n&gt;don&#39;t find =\r\nany reference to Yoritomo&#39;s &quot;head&quot; being\n&gt;stuck anywhere. \n\nI can&#39;t quite u=\r\nnderstand why Takauji is thought of as such a villain. I\ndon&#39;t feel he ever=\r\n really &quot;back-stabbed&quot; the imperial restoration. The\nKamakura Bakufu had gr=\r\nown weak and needed to be replaced, which Takauji\ndid, with a good deal of =\r\nhelp from the Imperial Court & it&#39;s allies to\nbe fair... But after it was r=\r\nemoved, Tajauji pretty much straight away\nstepped in to the previous Bakufu=\r\n&#39;s shoes and kept things moving much as\nthey had been before. It doesn&#39;t so=\r\nund to me like he ever even pretended\nto have any kind of Imperial restorat=\r\nion in mind, and I think most of\nthe other warriors around the nation also =\r\ngave up on that idea pretty\nquickly too, if they ever truly had it in the f=\r\nirst place. It&#39;s not like\nGo-Daigo proved to be any kind of great ruler or =\r\nanything. The only\nthing Go-Daigo and his administration seemed to do reall=\r\ny well was anger\nthe warrior class...\n_____________________________________=\r\n________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be con=\r\nfidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the inte=\r\nnded recipient.
