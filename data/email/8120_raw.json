Its a bit of a King A=\r\nrthur\nmyth that rolled on and got bigger in time.\n\nBut the man has excisted=\r\n, clan records mention him, works of his art\nare still on display today. An=\r\nd most people cant deny that he was one\nof the greatest warriors alive, he =\r\nwas not just skilled with weapons,\nhe also understood how to manipulate his=\r\n enemies psyche to his\nadvantage. His skills in woodcarfing and inkt painti=\r\nng where very good. \nHe was an exceptional warrior, in many ways, and altho=\r\nugh he did not\nseek it, and only served a few years under a Lord, i think h=\r\ne is one\nof the few who could claim the title of best samurai.\n\nHe has my v=\r\note *grins*\n\n\nQin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
