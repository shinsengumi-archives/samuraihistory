He must\n&gt; have known that \n&gt; they could come back to haunt him, and I am sure he\n&gt; could have had \n&gt; them both killed had he wanted to, with little or no\n&gt; impact on \n&gt; himself.\n\nYoshiaki was more of a hindrance than a help to anyone\nhe colluded with. And didn&#39;t he eventually kill\nMatsunaga? I seem to remember something about him\nsmashing an important tea bowl to prevent it falling\ninto Oda hands as his castle burned around him. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
