I joined this history group for my love =\r\nof history, and I believe in the ways of the old. So I can personally answe=\r\nr your question: yes, the ways are still followed, and although there are t=\r\nhose that say that the ways of the samurai are obsolete, or don&#39;t function =\r\nin these times, they will not likely die out as long as people still believ=\r\ne in them. In fact, the spirit of old Japan seems to be coming back in popu=\r\nlarity (even after the nightmares of world war 2 and the communist and soci=\r\nalist movement in Japan).\n\n--- On Wed, 9/24/08, james mathies &lt;unhappiclown=\r\n04@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: james mathies &lt;unhappiclown04@...&gt;\nSubjec=\r\nt: [samuraihistory] (unknown)\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Wedn=\r\nesday, September 24, 2008, 3:11 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you letting me join the grou=\r\np.My question who started the samurai?What does the name samurai mean and d=\r\no they practice it today\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remo=\r\nved]\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been =\r\nremoved]\n\n\n"
