The family were very \npoor, partly due to a debt incurred by their grandfather, and became \n&quot;half farmers. half bushi&quot;. Taki worked endlessly on the farm and in \nraising the children. After Shoin was imprisoned in Noyama jail in Hagi, \n(1854 -55) she visited him with gifts of food, warm clothes etc. When \nhe was released and allowed to start the Shoka Sonjuku Taki looked \nafter the students, fed them, bought sake for them, and mended their \nclothes. By all accounts, even though Shoin was adopted by the \nYoshida family at 4 years old (according to Craig) his relationship with \nhis birth family was always very close and loving. There is a moving \npoem inscribed in his shrine in Hagi which reads in English:\n&quot;The concerns of parents for their children are deeper than those of \nchildren for their parents.\nHow much will it grieve my parents to hear today&#39;s tidings.&quot;\n(written just before his execution in Edo)\n\nDespite her hard life Taki lived to the age of 84 and was famous for her \nunassuming kindness.\n\n&gt; can I ask you something? The book from where you take all those \ninformations are only in japanese? \n\nThere&#39;s so much more material available in Japanese and it is written \nfrom such a different viewpoint. This probably sounds like a truism but \nit&#39;s worth emphasising, I think. My Japanese reading is very slow but I \npersevere with it because I think it&#39;s so important. For sources in \nEnglish, there are far more in University libraries and academic papers \nand journals than I have access to. I&#39;m sure other people on this forum \ncan advise you where to look. But if you can read Japanese so much \nmore is available to you both on the web and in books.\n\ngambatte kudasai:)\n\nGillian\n\n \n\n"
