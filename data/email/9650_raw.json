There are books and books of information on each of these to=\r\npics. However, you at least have a starting point. \n\nRegarding Confucius...=\r\n I think the most significant element of interest to you would be the influ=\r\nence of Neo-Confucianism on the development of &quot;bushido-like&quot; codes of beha=\r\nvior during the Edo period. The combination of Shinto, Buddhism, and Neo-Co=\r\nnfucianism led to a combination of beliefs and attitudes that were unique t=\r\no the samurai class during that time period. Loyalty and gi are two concept=\r\ns that are deeply rooted in Confucian thought, for example.\n\nI hope that he=\r\nlps you somewhat. Good luck!\n\nJonathan P.
