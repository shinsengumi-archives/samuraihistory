The music and cinematography are great, and you&#39;ll enjoy \nthe performances by Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka)... and Cruise (as Nathan \nAlgren) ain&#39;t half bad, either. \n\nYou actually won&#39;t know most of the cast unless you&#39;re really into Asian theatre. Good actors, \nbut, of course, since it&#39;s set in Japan, not a lot of American actors in there.\n\nIs it based on a true story? Well...sort of. The movie IS historical fiction, so a little history, a \nlittle (a lot) of fiction. Don&#39;t expect it to be completely true to the actual Satsuma Rebellion \ntimeline and history. Plus you&#39;ve got a few oddities in there, like the Ninja attack, shuriken \na-flying and all...\n\nBut basically it gives a nice romantic portrayal of Saigo Takamori (Katsumoto), through the \neyes of the western observer, Nathan Algren. Action abounds, romance is subtle, and \nemotional contact is good. It&#39;s a bit melodramatic at points (like Braveheart and The Patriot) \nbut not intolerably so. What to expect? Think &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; reset in 19th century \nJapan. If you liked &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot;, you&#39;ll love &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;\n\nBest scene: Partway through the movie, Katsumoto is with Algren in a temple courtyard, \nsurrounded by blossoming cherry trees. And he tells Algren, &quot;One may search his entire life \nfor the perfect blossom, and he will not find it. But if he did find it, it would not be time wasted.&quot; \nSo then, towards the end of the movie, when Katsumoto lies dying, and his army has fallen, he \nsees the wind blow through a blossoming cherry tree, and sweep all the blossoms away... he \nsees it and says, in his dying breath... &quot;Perfect&quot; - speaking not so much of the cherry \nblossoms as his samurai warriors. His army of samurai, like the bough of cherry blossoms, fell \nin their beautiful prime... a samurai&#39;s glory.\n\nI&#39;ll give it **** \nDo I want to see it again? &quot;Hai.&quot;\nSo grab a popcorn, a coke, a date, and a ticket (and don&#39;t forget your wakizashes) and have a \ngood time.\n\n\n\n\n"
