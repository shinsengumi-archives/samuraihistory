I&#39;m reading through that at the moment=\r\n. I \nfind it fascinating that Adams&#39; Dutch shipmates have largely been \nneg=\r\nlected as major figures in contemporary fiction and historical \ndiscussions=\r\n. It&#39;s a bit of a shame really that none of his \ndescendants can be traced.=\r\n\n\nI&#39;m aware of the underclasses - corpse handlers, butchers, \nshoemakers an=\r\nd suchlike, although I didn&#39;t consider them when I \nposted as it seems fair=\r\nly unlikely that one of them could rise to \nsamurai class given their paria=\r\nh status. I believe there is still \nsome discrimination against their desce=\r\nndants even to this day?\n\nI will have to see if the Leeds Royal Armouries l=\r\nibrary has copies \nof the books that you cite. They have a fairly extensive=\r\n Oriental \ncollection, so I hope they&#39;ll be a bit more comprehensive (I&#39;m \n=\r\ngetting a little frustrated with relying on Turnbull, as he&#39;s \nnowhere near=\r\n as in-depth as I would like).\n\nShane.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Will O&#39;Neil &lt;w.d.oneil@p...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; This question has certainly gene=\r\nrated some lively and interesting \ndiscussion!\n&gt; \n&gt; I find it helpful to th=\r\nink back over the evolution of the samurai. \nRecall that the first samurai =\r\n(really bushi, since the kind of socio-\npolitical organization implied by t=\r\nhe term &quot;samurai&quot; had not really \nevolved yet) were essentially outlaws on =\r\nthe rugged and unsettled \nnortheastern frontier of Honshu, where the writ o=\r\nf the imperial \ncourt did not run, nearly 1,000 years ago. (Some people hav=\r\ne tried \nto trace their roots further back than that, but not entirely \ncon=\r\nvincingly to my mind. Martin Collcutt reviewed several relevant \nbooks a fe=\r\nw years ago -- full citations for this and other works at \nend of this post=\r\n.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of the leaders of bushi bands made good and established \nthems=\r\nelves as overlords of one or more villages. In other cases \nlocal magnates,=\r\n recognizing their value, took bushi into their \nservice (as &quot;samurai&quot; per =\r\nse -- the word comes from one meaning &quot;to \nserve&quot;). The logic of big battal=\r\nions fostered the formation and \ngrowth of samurai/bushi networks and hiera=\r\nrchies.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point it was largely true that a samurai was as a samu=\r\nrai \ndid. If you showed up with a mount, armed cap-=E0-pie,  and \ndemonstra=\r\nted the skills and courage to fight effectively no one was \nlikely to be in=\r\nclined to inquire closely about your ancestry. And if \nsomeone got rude abo=\r\nut it you, as a proper samurai, demonstrated how \ngood your bloodline reall=\r\ny was by fighting him to the death, then \nand there. Of course it took a go=\r\nod deal of capital, in a society \nwithout much movable wealth, in order to =\r\nequip and train yourself. \nBeing the son of a successful bushi was the most=\r\n common route, but \nby no means the only one.\n&gt; \n&gt; After the Onin Wars, and=\r\n particularly after the introduction of \ngunpowder weapons, entry at the bo=\r\nttom became even more porous -- a \nsturdy physique and pugnacious dispositi=\r\non could win you access to \nthe lowest rungs of warrior status. Were these =\r\nfellows &quot;real \nsamurai&quot;? It was a question that didn&#39;t seem to bother anyon=\r\ne \nespecially -- their military utility was enough to recommend them in \nan=\r\n era where it was very much a matter of dog eat dog. And of course \nability=\r\n could carry you a long way up the social hierarchy. \nHideyoshi never felt =\r\nquite secure enough to claim the very topmost \nrung, but if anyone despised=\r\n such a man for his humble origins he \nneeded to be very, very circumspect =\r\nin saying so.\n&gt; \n&gt; (BTW, the point of the sword hunt was not to close the s=\r\namurai \nclass in social terms but rather to secure the countryside and \nens=\r\nure that no challenges to Hideyoshi&#39;s order could arise. Ieyasu \nand his su=\r\nccessors followed Hidedyoshi&#39;s lead for like reasons. Of \ncourse Nobunaga h=\r\nad really set the precedent through his vigorous \nsuppression of the milita=\r\nrized ikki.)\n&gt; \n&gt; All this changed a great deal between the establishment o=\r\nf the \nTokugawa bakufu in 1603 and its full consolidation in power (about a=\r\n \ngeneration later). By 1630, the actual military functions of the \nsamurai=\r\n were largely moot and the members of this numerous class \n(probably 7% or =\r\nso of the total population, although varying greatly \nfrom han to han) were=\r\n employed (when employed at all) solely in \nbureaucratic or ceremonial duti=\r\nes. The Tokugawa order still rested \non military dominance -- the term &quot;bak=\r\nufu&quot; directly implies as much -\n- so the military functions of the samurai =\r\ncould not be dispensed \nwith, but they remained in abeyance for more than t=\r\nwo centuries.\n&gt; \n&gt; In these circumstances, the samurai became two things: a=\r\nn \nessentially hereditary social class and a collective term for those \nocc=\r\nupying the top 100 or more of the levels of authority in a deeply \nhierarch=\r\nical socio-political structure. The picture was complicated \nby the decentr=\r\nalized nature of authority under the Tokugawa, since \neach daimyo&#39;s househo=\r\nld or o-ie was a largely a law unto itself \nregarding its own composition a=\r\nnd structure. That is, if your local \ndaimyo said you were a samurai, that =\r\nwas all it took to make you a \nmember of the authority hierarchy, entitled =\r\nand required to behave \naccordingly. And if no daimyo (recalling that the s=\r\nhogun himself was \nalso a daimyo, head of his own great o-ie) claimed you, =\r\nthen you \nwere an outcaste, at least officially -- a ronin. \n&gt; \n&gt; (A ronin =\r\nremained a sort of samurai-by-courtesy, owing to social \norigin, and might =\r\nby good fortune or exceptional ability gain the \npatronage of some other da=\r\nimyo and thus regain official standing. \nBut many drifted to other employme=\r\nnt, including agriculture, trade, \nor less reputable fields.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The prac=\r\ntice of the daimyo varied a great deal. In fact, no one \nhas yet mapped out=\r\n the patterns of all 260+ daimyo households. But \nit is clear that at least=\r\n some of them altered the status order a \nlot. First of all, of course, the=\r\nre was a general trend toward \nreducing many samurai from independent holde=\r\nrs to stipendiaries \nwholly dependent on the daimyo -- a major shift (downw=\r\nard) in terms \nof status and autonomy. On the other hand, various individua=\r\nls or \ngroups might be granted samurai status (and stipends, although the \n=\r\nlatter were usually meager) in return for benefits bestowed on the \nhan. To=\r\n put it bluntly, in a lot of cases you could very well buy \nyour way into s=\r\namurai status. (How far &quot;real&quot; hereditary samurai \nwould go in cashing your=\r\n status claims is another matter, of course.)\n&gt; \n&gt; For the most part, it wa=\r\ns pretty difficult to move more than one \nor perhaps two rungs up the samur=\r\nai status ladder in the Tokugawa \nera -- and most han had at least a score =\r\nof rungs, with hundreds in \nsome of the larger ones. But one could ascend a=\r\n long way in certain \ncases. For one thing, homosexuality was relatively wi=\r\ndespread among \nthe samurai (both before and during the Tokugawa era) and a=\r\n young \nfavorite of the daimyo might rise to high status.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the sam=\r\nurai structure was swept away after the Restoration, \nthe samurai social cl=\r\nass did not entirely disappear. Indeed, the \nMeiji elite, in one of their c=\r\noncessions to the old order, gave \nofficial recognition to the class. This =\r\ncreated the problem of \ndeciding who should be so designated, which was the=\r\n source of many \nheadaches due to the variation among han practices. It was=\r\n \noriginally proposed to have some gradation in official class, \nreflecting=\r\n former rank distinctions. This was eventually given up as \na bad job and a=\r\nll former daimyo were ranked in one class, with \neveryone else lumped in an=\r\nother. Even so, there were many gray areas \nand many who were dissatisfied =\r\nwith the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; While I think I&#39;ve addressed most of the points rais=\r\ned by others, \nthere are two specific questions deserving separate treatmen=\r\nt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naomasa298&quot; \n&lt;shanesuebsahak=\r\narn@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At that stage, you were either born a samurai or y=\r\nou weren&#39;t, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure there were exceptions. I&#39;m not sure what sta=\r\ntus Will \nAdams \n&gt; &gt; achieved, but if anyone has any examples of people pro=\r\nmoted to \n&gt; &gt; samurai status (and what they did to achieve it), I&#39;d be \nint=\r\nerested \n&gt; &gt; to hear.\n&gt; \n&gt; In regard to Master Adams (and many other matter=\r\ns) I can \nthoroughly recommend _Learning from Shogun_, a marvellous book \ne=\r\ndited by Prof. Henry Smith, who has now very kindly posted it in \nPDF form =\r\non the Web! If you are not familiar with it, do go at once \nto\n&gt; http://www=\r\n.columbia.edu/~hds2/learning/\n&gt; \n&gt; [I had the pleasure of playing a very mi=\r\nnor role in getting this \non the Web in its present form.]\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Adoption =\r\nsprings to mind - could an Edo period samurai adopt a \nnon-\n&gt; &gt; samurai? Wi=\r\nth all of the economic hardships that many families \n&gt; &gt; suffered later in =\r\nthe period, it seems like adopting a rich \n&gt; &gt; merchant&#39;s son might have be=\r\nen a good way out of debt - or, \nsince \n&gt; &gt; merchants were officially the l=\r\nowest rung of society, was this a \n&gt; &gt; social no-no?\n&gt; \n&gt; Could and often d=\r\nid. Might marry a merchant&#39;s daughter, too. \n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, the merchant class w=\r\nas not the lowest in official status -- \nthere were several under classes. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Will O&#39;Neil\n&gt; \n&gt; Sources:\n&gt; \n&gt; Collcutt, Martin. &quot;The &#39;Emergence of t=\r\nhe Samurai&#39; and The Military \nHistory of Early Japan.&quot; Harvard Journal of A=\r\nsiatic Studies. 56, No. \n1 (Jun 1996): 151-64.
