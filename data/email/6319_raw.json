Before I could not understand your criticism but now I see things\nin a whole new light. That is of course what learning is about. And I am\nwell knowledgeable of &quot;bunbu&quot;. I was thought it was the twin ways of the pen\nand sword but that the same thing you are saying.\nPretty much - I think &#39;ichi&#39; means &#39;one,&#39; which has always led me to\nquestion the &quot;harmony&quot; translation.  Tony, or any other speakers of the\nlanguage - I remain most curious about this.\nHowever, I have already took these into consideration and since this issue\nof my spelling aroused when I spelled a Japanese word wrong it seemed you\ngot picky. Not to start any thing but alot of people make spelling mistakes.\nNo argument - but by planning to be a teacher, you place yourself outside\nthe category of those in whom it can reasonably be accepted.  As I may have\nmentioned, my mother and her father both taught elementary school.  It&#39;s\ngiven me a certain sense of what&#39;s expected of teachers.\nBut enough about that let me talk about culturalistic Japan some too. I\nloved Japan and lets see I have a bit I want to share. Hmm lets see how to\naproach... when you guys train do you train first your how do you say\nexternal or internal. What I am saying is do any one here do any traing of\nthe chi or Ki, for it a Japanese site. OK wait I know that if you train in\nexternal arts then you will be naturally strengthening your internal\nabilities but i guess you already see the question thank\n you. We are the same in so much yet different in so many aspects. GOD BLESS\nALL\n\tWhether I start a student on internal or external training largely depends\non the student.  By and large, as an American teaching Americans, that means\nstarting with the externals... but there have been one or two exceptions\nover the years.  In some cases, I never bring it up at all, as I simply\ndon&#39;t think these folks can wrap their heads around the idea.  (Some\nChristians, for example, believe ki to represent diabolic power, and I don&#39;t\nwant to get into that argument.)\n\tThe gods bless you as well.\n\npeace\n\tAnd peace be on your house.\n\nGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
