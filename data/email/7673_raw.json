On the screen it &quot;is&quot; shown as per the above illustration.\n2. However, the actual object does not have the red sun, it is quite\nplain gold leaf. There was a note to the effect that it has often been\nincorrectly illustrated with the sun on it.\n\nBTW the dam thing is huge! We measured the length of the limbs of the\nfan, and they came out to circa 7 feet! And IIRC a caption stated that\nit was carried attached to the side of a pole 5.35m (17.5 feet) tall!\nWhich having recently carried a simple linen uma jirushi (5 x 6 feet) on\na 15 foot pole in a display, is no mean feat.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
