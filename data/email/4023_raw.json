Can anyone confirm (or deny) this?\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kyle Segall&quot; \n&lt;klancesegall@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Try a little more than Shogun. Akechi Mitsuhide wouldn&#39;t have been \n&gt; thought so poor had he actually succeeded in becoming Shogun (his \n&gt; alliances not fallen apart, the mori finding out about nobunaga&#39;s \n&gt; death before hideyoshi). Don&#39;t kid yourself into think he really \ndid \n&gt; anything special. Just dumb.\n&gt; The daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai \n&gt; really believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to \nsee \n&gt; that. But these guys weren&#39;t the soldiers, they were the \n&gt; peacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.\n&gt; You claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its true \n&gt; that confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far \n&gt; from a system of honor, especially what you&#39;re thinking about. \nThink \n&gt; about it; if you&#39;re a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what \n&gt; little time you have off, what room is there for the &quot;honor&quot; that \n&gt; you think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do \n&gt; anything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure preaches \n&gt; about may be true... but that wasn&#39;t really out of a sense of honor.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the noble \n&gt; ones. I doubt an ashigaru wielding a spear was shouting, &quot;I am so-\n&gt; and-so, from so-and-so village! Come get some!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And sorry about the snappy remarks... I&#39;m just SICK of all these \n&gt; kids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for every \n&gt; age, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his actions. \n&gt; Only famous for who he killed and how dumb he was in doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n"
