Or did the name die out with the death of the last (former) Shogun, \nYoshinobu, in 1913?  Same thing, and this will probably sound really, REALLY \nstupid, but does anyone know if the Oda or Toyotomi family names have survived \ninto the present day?\n       And Tony, I&#39;m not offended by your comment about the books.  They&#39;re \none of only two mystery series I can stand myself, the other being Janet \nEvanovich&#39;s Stephanie Plum series.  I normally read romance, although I&#39;m trying to \nbranch out this year and read different authors and genres.\n       Take care.  8-D\n\nL8r.\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
