The source I&#39;m getting this info from (the\nIriki-In documents) doesn&#39;t show the word that is being translated for\nthe 5,068 personal followers of the mounted samurai. This figure would\nprobably encompass ashigaru as well as higher ranking non-mounted\nmilitary men and samurai, and the higher ranking mounted samurai brought\nmore men with them than the lower ranking mounted samurai. \n \nIf I had to throw out a completely unscientific guess I would maybe\nsuggest an average of 2-3 followers per mounted samurai being men\nranking higher than ashigaru. That seems reasonable to me, but it\nwouldn&#39;t shock me too much if I was completely wrong. As for the\nlandless men and squires, I&#39;m really not sure. Landless men would\nprobably count as ashigaru, or non-samurai footmen to be more accurate,\nbut without knowing too much about the kaji kosho (squires) it&#39;s hard to\nsay what their function would be. \n \nThe translator used the english term &#39;squire&#39; for the kaji kosho, which\ncould mean they were semi-aristocratic men who may have in turn had\ntheir own followers, or they could have been non-combatant general\nattendants. They were listed as having their own labourers assigned to\nthem, so that suggests that maybe they were likely the former - men of\nsome standing who may not have been direct retainers of the Shimazu,\nmaybe village headmen and the like. In that case some may have worn\narmour, but they probably would have functioned as ashigaru assigned\nunder a samurai commander.\n \nAgain though, I&#39;m just guessing here. Maybe someone else might be able\nto shed some light on some of this?\n \n-AngusH\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
