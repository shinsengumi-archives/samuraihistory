His latest movie, &quot;The\nLast Samurai,&quot; falls squarely into the realm of the\nprevious Zwick bedeviled-hero films, &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Courage\nUnder Fire&quot; and &quot;The Siege.&quot; \n\nAnd I do mean squarely. &quot;Samurai&quot; is a mythic western that\ncombines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in\nJapanese culture: John Ford&#39;s &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot; It\ndepicts phalanxes of troops moving with deliberate,\nterrifying fervor across the very wide screen. \n\nAnd this time Tom Cruise, the can-do idol of millions, uses\nhis polished-chrome smile mirthlessly. At least for the\nfirst hour, his grin looks like a faded tattoo. The uneven\n&quot;Samurai&quot; is a can-do movie that&#39;s far more effective at\ncommunicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more\nintimate ones. \n\nMr. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a burned-out former Army\nofficer and Indian fighter. Having survived Custer&#39;s Last\nStand in 1876, he is now a commercial sideshow prop,\ndemonstrating the newest Winchester rifle. As Algren\nlumbers through the clichï¿½s he&#39;s hired to recite before\nblasting away at targets - though the whiskey oozing from\nhis pores probably makes him more of a danger than the\nweapon - a sudden ember of regret flames in this\nex-soldier&#39;s eyes. He goes off the script, reciting the\nhorrors of a campaign in which he and his troops\nslaughtered innocents. \n\nAlgren looks so wasted and beleaguered that the biggest\nquestion is not whether he&#39;ll wing an audience member with\na stray shot, but whether he can bear up under the dense,\ncast-iron plot. After being bounced by the Winchester\nfolks, Algren is hired by his former commander, Colonel\nBagley (Tony Goldwyn, playing a salamanderlike ancestor of\nall the sleazy characters he&#39;s ever portrayed). Bagley\nwants Algren to travel with him to Tokyo and train Japanese\nsoldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles. The\nMeiji emperor is ready to accept the ways of the West; he&#39;s\nactually being pressured to by American business interests.\n\nOnce in Japan, Algren is forced to send his nervous,\nunderprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against\nan enemy of the emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken\nWatanabe). Despite the imperial army&#39;s modern weapons,\nKatsumoto and his men sweep in with ferocity and wield\ntheir arms of the past - swords and spears - with lethal\neffectiveness. The cinematographer, John Toll, films their\narrival through a thick fog in a forest, as if Katsumoto&#39;s\nmen were ghosts from the recent past out to rob Algren&#39;s\ntroops of their backbones - and their lives. \n\nIn their ritual armor, Katsumoto&#39;s men make quick work of\ntheir foes; there&#39;s tragicomic relief as Algren&#39;s\nconscripted farmers tremble while trying to load their\nguns. When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto&#39;s second in\ncommand, he&#39;s captured by the invaders and, even more\nbewildering, cared for by Katsumoto&#39;s sister, Taka\n(Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren murdered. \n\nIt&#39;s a complicated story, and Mr. Zwick is complicated,\ntoo: he loves arrogance slapped out of its self-regard.\nAlgren is full of himself, even though he&#39;s conceived as a\nman who was second tenor to a legend; he knew and despised\nCuster. Looking fashionably distressed, with slightly\npuffy, red-rimmed eyes that at the very least suggest that\nhe&#39;s survived a grueling press junket, Mr. Cruise has a\nworn cockiness. His aw-shucks virility is a little wilted,\nif not mildewed, around the edges: a kind of reverse\nnarcissism, since Algren is proud of his dissolution\n(though Mr. Cruise&#39;s good-boy posture works for a man\nreared under the disciplinary rigors of the military). \n\nAlthough at times Mr. Cruise comes off as too contemporary\nfor the 19th century - at one point, he seems to be waiting\nfor a cellphone call to confirm his terms for a cover of\nDetails magazine - this displacement fits better when he\nbecomes a prisoner. Algren appears to be reacting to this\nstrange new world through sounds; nothing he&#39;s hearing\nmakes any sense to him. He&#39;s a mangy gaijin that Edgar Rice\nBurroughs might have invented, though James Clavell got\nthere eventually. \n\nThe film includes notable performances by actors not\ndrafted to shoulder the burden of the entire production.\nBilly Connolly, emanating a gamy, sly menace that he&#39;s\nrarely suggested before, plays Algren&#39;s former sergeant at\narms, Zebulon Gant. Gant, used to propping up his old\nfriend and superior officer, joins Algren in the journey to\nJapan. Mr. Connolly&#39;s loose, hostile vivacity registers so\nclearly that it&#39;s obvious we won&#39;t be seeing very much of\nhim. But this is crackling, rigorous comic work; he doesn&#39;t\nhave to present the face of tragedy. \n\nThe far more weighted and daring acting comes from Mr.\nWatanabe, as Katsumoto. Probably best known outside of\nJapan as the reedy, restless sidekick in the gourmand\nclassic &quot;Tampopo,&quot; Mr. Watanabe has filled out physically\nand spiritually. The formality he brings to Katsumoto is\nhard-won, especially when he&#39;s having pointedly thoughtful\nconversations with Algren that sound more like translations\nof ideograms than actual dialogue. \n\nThe film never really explains how or why this resolute,\nisolated samurai learned to speak English better than the\nemperor. His fluency doesn&#39;t quite make sense, though it\ngives the movie some needed mystique. It plays better than\nthe inexorable pull of romance, drawing Taka and Algren\ntogether. \n\n&quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; which Mr. Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz\nwrote with John Logan, from a story by Mr. Logan,\nsuper-glues together a host of contradictions.\nUnfortunately, as dramatized, they function as conventions\nthat are older than the story the film is weaving. The\nmovie, which opens nationwide today, is most watchable\nduring the majestic brutality of the battle sequences. This\nis not only because of the handsome staging, but also\nbecause the keywords sacrifice and honor are evoked with\nverve and simplicity, more so than in the &quot;exchange of\nidea&quot; chats between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like\nstatements being read into the Congressional Record by\nNathaniel Hawthorne. \n\nMr. Zwick has absorbed the lethal agility of Akira\nKurosawa; what registers just as powerfully as the sureness\nof the combatants is the ugly futility of the battles\nthemselves. When the film sets up the lessons that Algren\nhas to learn, the hero is not really a fish out of water;\nhe&#39;s more like a big fish in a dry pond, picking up a\nlesson in Eastern deportment and philosophy a step away\nfrom the &quot;wax-on, wax-off&quot; curriculum of &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot;\nIn those scenes presaging his Eastern conversion, Algren\ncan&#39;t suppress his eagerness to learn, picking up the ways\nof the sword and the Samurai code of Bushido with an\nalacrity that&#39;s mandated for movie stars: flash-card\neducation. \n\nThe film&#39;s title evokes James Fenimore Cooper, though he\nhad enough perspective not to make a white man &quot;the last&quot;\nin his novel. Even though &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; opts for\nJapan&#39;s cultural differences, all of the unmentioned\nhardships of a feudal society notwithstanding, the\nremaining honorable native here is an American. Is that a\nveiled way of saying that Japan&#39;s old ways were doomed\nafter all? \n\n&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is rated R (Under 17 requires\naccompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence,\nincluding enough ritualistic bloodletting for a week on the\nHistory Channel; alcohol use; strong language; and a chaste\nhint of sexuality. \n\nTHE LAST SAMURAI \n\nDirected by Edward Zwick; written by John Logan, Marshall\nHerskovitz and Mr. Zwick, based on a story by Mr. Logan;\ndirector of photography, John Toll; edited by Steven\nRosenblum and Victor du Bois; music by Hans Zimmer;\nproduction designer, Lilly Kilvert; produced by Mr. Zwick,\nMr. Herskovitz, Tom Cruise, Paula Wagner, Scott Kroopf and\nTom Engelman; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.
