It is about the first ships arived in japan in 1600. In particular it tells the story of William Adams.\nI haven&#39;t finished it yet, but I can tell you something about his wives.\nThe one who remained in England survived with the provents that the Company of the Calls Oriental (compagnia delle Indie Orientali in italian...I don&#39;t know if this is the right traslation!) but I still don&#39;t know what happens to her next.\nThen, Adams had another wife...a japanese one, who lived in his estate in Hemi.\nAs soon as I finish the book I&#39;ll tell you more!\nSALUT!\nDaniele\n\nEponymous13@... wrote:\nHey.\n       Just a question.  Is anything more known about what happened to \nAdams&#39;s widow after he died?  I.e. did she remarry or is this not known?  Just \nwondering.  :-)\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
