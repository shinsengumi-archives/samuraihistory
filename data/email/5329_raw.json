So we&#39;ve established one\nfact--you can see the Japanese in the original email,\nbut not when it&#39;s rerouted as a reply. Hmm.\n\nNate\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo! Enter now.\nhttp://promotions.yahoo.com/goldrush\n\n"
