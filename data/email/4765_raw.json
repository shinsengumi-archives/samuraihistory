Remember, that sometimes it takes a little courage to post\nin a field where you know nothing, and receiving such a hostile\nreception can kill a budding interest in a subject stone dead. I would\nsuggest that if you feel a questioner&#39;s enquiry is not worthy of your\ntime and efforts to reply to, then, simply don&#39;t. Leave it to someone\nelse, and if no one wishes to reply, so be it. Sometimes I find dealing\nwith so-called &quot;simple&quot; questions makes me rethink my own assumptions\nabout the knowledge that I &quot;think&quot; I have in the subject being\nconsidered, and thus helps me to master it:-)\n\nFinally to add a piece to Nate&#39;s answer re daimyo: the required income\nduring the Tokugawa shogunate or Edo era (1600-1868) to be considered as\na daimyo was 10,000 koku. One koku was the amount of rice required to\nfeed one person for one year, and served as a measure of wealth for what\nwas fundamentally an agricultural society. A koku is a fraction over 180\nlitres of rice or about 300 pounds in weight. Will Adams, the first\nEnglishman in Japan, in a letter dated 1611 recounted that he and his\ncrew were each given an income of &quot;2 pounds of rice a day&quot;, which is 2.4\nkoku a year. IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income exceeding\n1,000 koku, while the richest daimyo in the land Tokugawa Ieyasu, the\nfirst of the Edo era shogun&#39;s had an income of over 4 million koku a\nyear!.\n\nI hope the chap who posted has hung around to read this, if so I hope\nyou find this stuff useful.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n&gt;    Ladies and Gentlemen, as temporary list moderator,\n&gt;    I&#39;ve had to reject two messages from a certain\n&gt;    individual in the past day. Granted, these were\n&gt;    emotional childish outbursts laced with the &quot;f&quot; word,\n&gt;    but the underlying issue is that we weren&#39;t kind\n&gt;    enough to answer what a &quot;daimyo&quot; is for the young man.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Yes, I understand that if you do a google search you\n&gt;    should find an answer in about .03 nanoseconds. Yes, I\n&gt;    also understand that we are not a crutch for people\n&gt;    who don&#39;t want to do research. That being said, here&#39;s\n&gt;    a short answer that hopefully will suffice:\n&gt;\n&gt;    Daimo: &quot;Great Name&quot; a feudal lord of the samurai class\n&gt;    in pre-Meiji Japan. Daimyo were generally considered\n&gt;    the pre-eminent ruler in their fief, and controlled\n&gt;    everything that happened therein. Prior to the\n&gt;    Tokugawa Shogunate, the Daimyo were essentially\n&gt;    &quot;warlords&quot; controlling territory by force of arms,\n&gt;    enlarging it as they could. Subsequently, they held\n&gt;    their fiefs either by being granted them by the\n&gt;    Shogunate, or with the Shogunate&#39;s permission,\n&gt;    anyways. Daimyo had an army of samurai retainers,\n&gt;    generally speaking, to maintain order in their domains\n&gt;    and to fight wars when necessary. Once the Tokugawa\n&gt;    period began, there was a minimum income to be\n&gt;    considered a &quot;daimyo&quot;--I don&#39;t know off hand what it\n&gt;    was, but I&#39;m sure you can look it up somewhere.\n&gt;\n&gt;    There&#39;s a basic answer. \nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
