What I haven&#39;t come across is a &#39;samurai bootcamp&#39;.  I notice \nmartial artists like to talk about &#39;training like the samurai&#39; but \ncan&#39;t help but think there wasn&#39;t any real sort of &#39;regiment&#39; that \nthey followed.  It&#39;s not like china where you have a courtyard of 500 \nbald warriors in white robes practicing spear techniques.  I just get \nthe impression that the samurai of the sengoku period lived war and \ndidn&#39;t particularly train for it - at least not in the &#39;boot camp&#39; \nsense...\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;d be surprised. There is an old martial art (the name of which \nescapes\n&gt; me for the moment) which is, essentially, &quot;wrestling in armour.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a very practical thing to learn to do, if you&#39;re an armoured \nwarrior\n&gt; who periodically has to fight in close quarters. You learn how to \ngrab and\n&gt; secure people wearing armour (where to grab, etc.) and how to avoid \nbeing\n&gt; grabbed while in armour.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n"
