The kanji I used in my message were \u001b$B==2|\u001b(B, the \nTen Commandments. I used it as an example to show how ten, which is \npronounced jyuu, becomes jikk in compound words. The Ten Commandments \nare not &#39;jyuu-kai&#39;, but rather &#39;jikkai&#39;, Ten minutes are not \n&#39;jyuppun&#39;, but rather &#39;jippun&#39;, etc.\n\n&gt;A very close friend of  mine is a member of the Masaki\n&gt;Ryu In Japan which is famous for its Jutte and edo\n&gt;machikata jutte, they use the term Jutte (or at least\n&gt;he does when discussing the matter with me)\n\nHere of course there can be no argument. They either use that \npronuncation or not, and either way it&#39;s just a fact. But, jutte could \nbe kind of a &#39;jargon&#39; or specialized pronunciation that is used in \nthat ryuu-ha only.\n\nAlternatively, this could be a tomato - tomahto kind of thing. The \nword brings up enough discussion from time to time that it&#39;s \nprobably impossible to declare with finality what is the &#39;right&#39; \npronunciation.\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
