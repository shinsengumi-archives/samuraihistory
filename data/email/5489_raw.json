It took him four\n&gt; years to pay off the \n&gt; sword which cost him 100 Kan which equals 25 Ryo or\n&gt; 25 Koku of rice or \n&gt; 200 man-en in todays money.\n\nTom--\n\nFor those who don&#39;t live in Japan or aren&#39;t familiar\nwith spending yen, you might want to explain that 200\nman en (�Q�O�O���~�jmeans 2,000,000 yen. &quot;Man-en&quot;\nwouldn&#39;t mean anything to you if you&#39;re not used to\ncounting out Japanese bills. To add perspective,\nthat&#39;s roughly $18,000 or so off the top of my head. \n\n Thats\n&gt; 310 man-en, 248 \n&gt; man-en and 216 man-en respectively in todays money.\n\nAgain, 3,100,000 yen, 2,480,000 yen, and 2,160,000\nyen. Current yen rate is about 109 to the US dollar, I\nthink--haven&#39;t checked recently. \n\nOne thing--how did you come up with the conversion\ninto today&#39;s money? Where did you get that 25 koku =\n200���~? Just curious, since I&#39;ve always seen money\nconversion like this treated as some sort of sorcery\nthat can&#39;t ever be trusted to be really accurate. \n\nNate\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
