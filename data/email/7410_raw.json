Also, if Stephen\n&gt; Hayes\n&gt; is so poorly \n&gt; &gt; regarded, then I suspect that his &quot;Master&quot; Masaaki\n&gt; Hatsumi is equally \n&gt; &gt; vilified.  I ask because I bought a Sojutsu DVD\n&gt; that\n&gt; was made by him \n&gt; &gt; because there is very little material available on\n&gt; that martial art \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; English.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you\n&gt; \n&gt; I picked it up in a bookshop, glanced at the\n&gt; numerous\n&gt; pictures of black \n&gt; pyjama clad warriors with throwing stars and put it\n&gt; back down again. \n&gt; And went home and took a shower.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seriously though, having briefly leafed through it,\n&gt; it\n&gt; does seem to \n&gt; contradict itself in that it tries to debunk some of\n&gt; the myths and ends \n&gt; up perpetuating those very same myths.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; considering 10 years ago Yurnbull wrote a bigger\n&gt; book\n&gt; on the Ninja this one was a seriously pathetic\n&gt; attempt\n&gt; at just making money\n&gt; \n&gt; He has taken comic book principles bits of hollywood\n&gt; and tried to pass it off as Ninja related material.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was shocked to see that he states that Ninja\n&gt; carried\n&gt; straight bladed swords. He obviously has done no\n&gt; research whatsoever into anything regarding ninja\n&gt; weapons, and he definately has not had any timeon\n&gt; his\n&gt; hands to read forums etc. \n&gt; The straight ninja sword was 100% debunked by\n&gt; members\n&gt; of the Ninjutsu training community 15 years ago,\n&gt; with\n&gt; the source of that creation going back to Steve\n&gt; Hayes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was given the book as a gift and I wish I could\n&gt; have\n&gt; given it back. \n&gt; \n&gt; I wouldnt waste my money on it\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul\n&gt;\nPaul,\n\nAs I look through the book I see that the artist drew\na picture of a square tsuba style sword in one panal\nbut also shows katana in the very next panal. \nTurnbull makes a point to mention katana, although on\npage 18 under the heading of &quot;\nStandard ninja equipment&quot; he says &quot;... for convenience\nthe ninja would choose a blade that was shorter and\nstraighter then usual.&quot;\n\nMichael\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
