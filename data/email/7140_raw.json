I wrote this post... like... months ago? quite a slow reply lol.\n&gt; anyway mine was just a historical citation of a pretty angry \ndamyo.. :D\n&gt; nothing to lose your sleep for.... wonder why you took it so bad... \nwhat\n&gt; if, for real, ninjas was only a myth? I think it would be funny :D\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n \nIt would be really funny if the shinobi were really just plain old \nsamurai, just with specialized training, simmilar to our special \nforces. I think it would also be funny if they used roughly the same  \nexact weapons as the samurai, give or take 1 or 2. I would also laugh \ntoo if they didn&#39;t wear black but dressed like the enemy to blend in,  \nand not be found out by a guard saying &quot;Who is that in the black \npajamas with a sword, coming towards us?&quot;\n\nGuard 2: &quot;I don&#39;t know, we could just kill him then ask.&quot; \n\nThat would be an awesome joke.\n\nMaikeru\n\n\n\n"
