I \n\nHaha - no that&#39;s ok. Actually I wasn&#39;t clear. What I meant is, in \nmost accounts we see that Nobuhiro is the oldest son which \nmakes Nobunaga the second son (but first son of Nobuhide&#39;s \nofficial wife or &quot;seishitsu&quot; \u001b$B@5&lt;&lt;\u001b(B. But some verbal accounts add a \nmystery son, which makes Nobunaga the third son. \n\nSo I wasn&#39;t really asking about the order per se, but about the \nnumber of sons.\n\nMy guess is that this is based on the fact that Nobunga took the name \nSaburo Nobunaga, which implies he was the third son. But I lean \ntowards thinking that there was no mystery older brother (or perhaps \nhe died in childbirth or very young).\n\nThanks again!\n\n&gt;have where the actually fit in (who is the child of who, who married \n&gt;who, etc.) but this view is more interesting - it is copied directly \n&gt;from the genealogy software printout, so the formatting might end up \n&gt;a bit wierd:\n&gt;\n&gt;Last Name   First Name\tBirth Date   Death Date\t\n&gt;===============================================\n&gt;Father -\n&gt;Oda\tNobuhide\t\t\t\n&gt;\n&gt;Brother -\n&gt;Oda\tHidenari\t\t1574\t\n&gt;Oda\tNagamasu\t1547\t1621\t\n&gt;Oda\tNagatoshi\t\t1582\t\n&gt;Oda\tNobuhiro\t\t\t\n&gt;Oda\tNobukane\t1543\t1614\t\n&gt;Oda\tNobuoki\t\t21 Nov 1570\t\n&gt;Oda\tNobuyuki\t\t\t\n&gt;\n&gt;Sister -\n&gt;Oda\tOichi\t\t\t\n&gt;Oda\tOkatsu\t\t\t\n&gt;\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
