He is dead\nnow but his son Robert has all of his material amd set\nup this site http://www.robertg.com/\n\nthe book was based on masaki ryu and had a lot  in it\nabout Nawa Fumio who is still alive (in his 90&#39;s) and\nonly recently retired from teaching. He will be the\nlast soke of his ryu as he has split it into 4 shihan\nlines. At leas 2 photos in the book feature Hatsumi\nmasaaki who left the ryu and later gained fame as a\nninja dude - Bujinkan Dojo.\n\nThank you for the reminder - and the link.  I&#39;ll have to check it out and\nsee what I think of it thirty years later.  It&#39;s unclear from this, though,\nwhether you regard Gruzanski&#39;s information as legitimate or not; nor on what\nbasis you make your judgement.\n\nDont worry about being a wanna be ninja - it got the\nbets of us hooked at one time or another\n\nI&#39;ll assume you don&#39;t intend that to be insulting.  But I&#39;m no wanna-be\nanything, Paul, and your comment is not calculated to go over well with any\nserious martial artist.  I earn my meager bread as a teacher of\ninternational sword arts (as well as naginata, spear, assorted peasant\nweapons from Europe and Asia, Chinese weapons, archery, empty-hand, and\nknife and stick styles - I even teach crutch self-defense from time to\ntime), and I&#39;m pretty serious about my accuracy.  I also come from a family\nof academics, so bad research is a very sensitive subject for me.  I&#39;ve been\nteaching one style or another for about thirty years, pretty informally\nuntil the last ten years or so; and I&#39;ve been practising longer than I can\nremember offhand.  I got hooked, as you put it, on Japanese combat arts at\nan art house that screened Inagaki&#39;s &quot;Chushingura&quot; every year back in the\nlate &#39;60s and early &#39;70s.  Musashi&#39;s _Book of Five Rings_ had a hell of a\nlot more influence on me than the ninja craze that hit a few years later.\n(And of course, my mother had Hiroshige and Hokusai prints around the house\nfrom the time I was born.)\nA few years ago, someone asked another teacher in the area, &quot;What does it\ntake to open a Ninjitsu school?&quot;  The teacher thought about it a second and\nsaid, &quot;A black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a business license.&quot;  Which pretty\nwell sums up my attitude to 90-plus % of what is called Ninjitsu today.\nI&#39;ve talked with Steve Hayes, and one of my old students ran Frank Dux&#39;s\nsecond school back in the &#39;80s, before he got disillusioned with Dux&#39;s cult\nof personality.  Neither of them impressed me much with the quality of his\nbackground.  (Dux&#39;s fighting skill was remarkable, but it was mostly\nmilitary; and &quot;Bloodsport&quot; represented neither his style nor his\nwish-fulfillment history with any accuracy.)  As far as the craze for\nNinjitsu goes, in fact, I have seen precisely one &quot;Ninja&quot; film - some Sho\nKosugi silliness that turned up on late-night TV a few years back - and my\ncomment to Nate was precisely in hopes that I would _not_ be lumped in with\nthis sordid batch of bad research and willful myth-information by the\nserious minds on this list.\nSo if being a ninja wanna-be got &quot;the best of us&quot; hooked, then I guess I&#39;m\nnot one of the best of you.  And if that really were the best of you, I\nwouldn&#39;t be on this list.\n\nthe spikes and the stars are all known as shuriken.\n\nThat is certainly true:  at least outside of Japan:  but then a great many\nthings are &quot;known&quot; inaccurately.  (Witness the person who found a web-site\nclaiming the 47 Ronin killed the Shogun!)  So permit me to ask if you have\npositive knowledge that the term &#39;shaken&#39; is incorrectly applied to the\nstars, etc., and likewise that &#39;shuriken&#39; is correctly applied to them.  As\nI say, I&#39;m pretty serious about my accuracy, and I always desire to learn\nmore and to refine my knowledge.\n\n\nthe spikes are better know as Bo-shuriken\n\nAgain, I&#39;m interested in learning the sources for this information.  No\noffense, but what I have is your word on one hand, and Gruzanski&#39;s\nMasaki-Ryu information on the other (and I do thank you for providing me\nwith that footnote).  If what you say about Masaki-Ryu as the source for\n_Spike and Chain_ is correct, then why should that not be regarded as\naccurate?  Have you reason to believe that Masaki-Ryu is not a legitimate\nstyle, and that its terminology is therefore to be dismissed?  And if so, on\nwhat grounds do you make that claim?  Another style&#39;s terminology that you\nprefer, perhaps, or a genuinely superior knowledge of standard Japanese\nmartial terminology?  I&#39;m prepared to adopt new terms and thank you for it -\nbut I&#39;ll need some documentation beyond what you&#39;ve said here.  You&#39;ve said\nwhat your &quot;correct&quot; terms are without saying why the terms I cited are\n&quot;incorrect&quot;.\n\n\nHavent we discussed Shuriken etc in the recent past -\nmaybe worth looking at the archive onthe yahoo site.\n\nYes, we have.  I believe I mentioned the same thing about shaken vs.\nshuriken then, but nobody responded to it that time.  Look forward to your\nresponse now.\n\n\nPaul\n\n\tGereg Jones Muller, Master-at-Arms\nThe Silk Road School of Sword and Self-Defense\nHome:  831-335-1395    Mobile:  831-234-5216\n\n\n\n\n\n"
