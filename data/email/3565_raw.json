Or did the name die out with the death of the last (former) \n&gt;Shogun,\n&gt; &gt; Yoshinobu, in 1913?  Same thing, and this will probably sound really, \n&gt;REALLY\n&gt; &gt; stupid, but does anyone know if the Oda or Toyotomi family names have \n&gt;survived\n&gt; &gt; into the present day?\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh, heck. There are scads of Tokugawa out there.\n&gt;\n&gt;One of the ladies being courted at one time by the current Crown Prince was \n&gt;a\n&gt;Tokugawa. The Toyotomi were annihilated in 1615, and there are lots of Oda \n&gt;out\n&gt;there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        And Tony, I&#39;m not offended by your comment about the books.  \n&gt;They&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; one of only two mystery series I can stand myself, the other being Janet\n&gt; &gt; Evanovich&#39;s Stephanie Plum series.  I normally read romance, although \n&gt;I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; &gt; branch out this year and read different authors and genres.\n&gt;\n&gt;The trouble is, it&#39;s hard to find good historic Japan lit in English. The \n&gt;market\n&gt;is small, and the trap is to explain *enough* so that people unfamiliar \n&gt;will\n&gt;understand the concepts while not turning off the handful of people who \n&gt;*do*\n&gt;understand and want the lit.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m currently working on a novel that leads up to Sekigahara (in my copious\n&gt;spare time &lt;wry g&gt;) which I would describe as a Japanese version of &quot;Killer \n&gt;Angels.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Tony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLet the new MSN Premium Internet Software make the most of your high-speed \nexperience. http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=byoa/prem&ST=1\n\n\n\n"
