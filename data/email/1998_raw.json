Usually consisting of the master and a few\n&gt;students. A really large operation might also include a few flunkies.\n\tTom I would beg to differ, in the Mid to late-Muromachi there \nwerre very large operations at Osafune in Bizen and in Mino. Witness \nthe innurable smiths signing Sukesada, then imagine each as a group \nof artists working together and you can get an idea of their numbers. \nThe work from these shops is known a Kazu-uchi-mono and while derided \nby some as pedestrain work, they are still very much &quot;true Samuari \nswords&quot;.\n\n\n&gt;I\n&gt;do not know of the place you seek but it may be in Taiwan or really just\n&gt;some sort of modern knife factory.\n\n\nToday in Mino (Gifu) there are still many smiths cranking out blades \nof all types for sale. Many of these shops are open to the public, \nsince they are still playing on the reputation of being a center of \nsword production. Perhaps thru the TOZANDO website or NOSHYUIAIDO \nyou&#39;ll find links to these.\n\n&gt;Someone on this group might be able to\n&gt;direct you to someone that could get you in to see some modern\n&gt;swordsmithing operation like Yoshindo Yoshihara in Tokyo. Or perhaps one\n&gt;of the other toko working in the area. There are quite a few in the Tokyo\n&gt;area.\n\nIf you travel to Kamakura on the &quot;Backside&quot; of Kamakura station is \nthe shop of the 24th generation Masamune swordsmith, Yamamura \nTsunahiro. Yamamura Sensei doesn&#39;t speak much English but welcomes \nvisitors. They always fire up the furnace on Sundays.\n\n&gt;  Do be sure to go to the Japanese sword museum or Nihonto\n&gt;Hakobutsukan and the Tokyo National Museum while there. They are terrific\n&gt;for viewing the best in japanese swords and art.\n\nThe sword museum is closed mondays and holidays. Also check out the \nEisei Bunka (Hosokawa family collection), Nezu Bijutsukan, Seikado \nbijutsukan and Sano Bijutsukan (in Mishima) for rotating exhibits of \nswords.\n\n&gt;  Also a place called Aoi\n&gt;art is right around the corner from the Sword museum it is a sword shop.\n&gt;They have a web site www.aoi-art.ab.psiweb.com/index.html they are\n&gt;retailers but may be able to arrange a tour for you.\n&gt;      Hope you enjoy your trip. It is a great place to go.\n&gt;Tom Armour\n\nCheck out the Japanese sword index for more info on these and lots more...\n-t\n\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/nihonto.htm\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
