Again=\r\n, it contradicts some &quot;accepted history&quot;... so fair warning.=A0 For example=\r\n, it says that Toyotomi was actually working as a spy for the Hachisuka in =\r\nthe beginning--- that he was not a peasant at all, but a low ranking samura=\r\ni working as a spy. He was hired by the Ikoma Family and it was Ikoma&#39;s dau=\r\ngher that introduce Toyotomi to Oda Nobunaga.\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 He worked =\r\nwith the Hachisuka and Maeno later on as a combination of soldier/spy. .. i=\r\nn fact, many of the samurai families from the upper Owari area (the Hachisu=\r\nka, Fukushima, Kawajiri, Kumazawa, Nojiri, Nakagawa, Maeno=A0etc.etc) of no=\r\nrthern Nagoya, Ichinomiya, Konan, etc.etc---- most of their family history =\r\nfollows the &quot;spy&quot; version of the story--- not the &quot;peasant&quot; version..but th=\r\nen again, these families are known to have been spies themselves-- - so I g=\r\nuess that it makes sense.\n=A0\n=A0So, it is worth looking into to get a very=\r\n different look on it all.\n\n--- On Wed, 4/8/09, kojalMtirta@ gmail.com &lt;koj=\r\nalMtirta@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: kojalMtirta@ gmail.com &lt;kojalMtirta@ gma=\r\nil.com&gt;\nSubject: [samuraihistory] one night castle\nTo: samuraihistory@ yaho=\r\nogroups. com\nDate: Wednesday, April 8, 2009, 6:43 AM\n\nCan anybody tell me a=\r\nbout the story of one night castle at sunomata which hideyoshi constructed.=\r\n I read that it is still a matter of debate among historians.
