Samurai archives (dic=\r\ntionary) mentions Michiyori, based in Iyo province in the second half of XV=\r\nIth century. Yorikatsu was an officer of Kobayakawa Hideaki at the battle o=\r\nf Sekigahara (Sadler, The life of Tokugawa Ieyasu). The Kobayakawa were bas=\r\ned in the south of Aki province and were separated from Iyo province by the=\r\n Inland sea but had a long and friendly relationship with clans of Iyo (not=\r\nably Kawano/Kono and Murakami). I presume Michiyori and Yorikatsu were memb=\r\ners of the same family or of branches of the Hiraoka, as well as Yoriyasu w=\r\nho, circa 1620 held a domain of 10.000 koku in Mino (Mass and Hauser, The B=\r\nakufu in Japanese history). As usual, the family had a special kanji : yori=\r\n in this case.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Message du 29/12/10 06:58\n&gt; &gt; De : &quot;Paul Martin&quot; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; A : samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Copie =E0 : \n&gt; &gt; Objet : RE: [sa=\r\nmuraihistory] Simple Sengoku Daimyo Question\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; Doe=\r\ns anyone have any information on this guy: Hiraoka Yorikatsu Born 1560.
