That is (very) unlikely, since the tamahagane would\nhav=\r\ne had to be folded 20 or 21 times depending how you count. The point\nbeing =\r\nthat everytime the steel is folded you are adding carbon (and\nlosing impuri=\r\nties), making it tougher / harder and thus more difficult\nto fold each time=\r\n, and making the swords cutting edge eventually more\nbrittle. (the inner co=\r\nre of a sword is not folded as often as the\noutside &#39;skin&#39; for this reason =\r\n- keeping it simple). \n\nI believe you will find that the average no. Of tim=\r\nes the outer steel is\nfolded will range from 12 - 16. Indicating just over =\r\n65.000 layers of\nsteel when folded 16 times.......... \n\n- Matt\n\n \n\n    Z Re=\r\ncruiting Services\n    =93Zurich Toren=94 Muzenstraat 89\n    2511 WB Den Haa=\r\ng\n    T: +31 70 4262273\n    F: +31 70 4262111\n    W: zrecruiting.com\n    E:=\r\n info@...\n    Kijk ook op monsterboard.nl, jobbingmall.nl en \n =\r\n   nationalevacaturebank.nl voor actuele vacatures!\n\n\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk =\r\nbericht-----\nVan: Jack McElwee [mailto:KeimanZero@...] \nVerzonden: =\r\ndinsdag 23 december 2003 18:19\nAan: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOnderwer=\r\np: RE: [samuraihistory] RE: Sharpness in soul or in the steel?\n\n\nWe see you=\r\n saw the Samurai Warriors special on History Channel running\nthis \nmonth on=\r\n ComcastOnDemand/Cable Faves.
