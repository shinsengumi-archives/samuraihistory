He \nrefreshingly suggests that Saigo had little intention of making war on \nKorea and was simply doing his best to gain control of the council left \nin charge in the absence of Okubo and others.\n\tHe argues, I think convincingly, that Saigo had a history of placing \nhimself in danger to demonstrate his sincerity (makoto), and thereby \nwinning the trust of his enemies, forged alliances. This may have been \nhis intent when arguing for a mission to Korea. The Okubo led \ngovernment quashed the idea and later trumped up the image of a \n&quot;Hawkish, unreasonable&quot; Saigo. Who quit the government not because of \nthe failure of the Korea mission but because he clearly saw who was now \nin control and wanted no part of the administration under his old \nfriend.\n\tNot ten years after the Seinan no Ran, the emissary to Korea was \nkilled while on a mission there and this was used as an excuse by that \nsame Okubo government to annex the peninsula...\n-t\n\n\n"
