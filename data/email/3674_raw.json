They have a direct linneage of tranmission direct from\nBoddhidharma who also transmitted the Bodhisattva Vajramukti that is the\nroot of the majority of several asiatic martial systems, including Karate\nwhose movements are based on the paterns of the Maha-Mandala that is the\nembodyment of the three holy bodies of Dai-nichi Nyorai (Maha Vairocana\nTathag�ta) and Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni Tathag�ta).\n\nstudy more before saying ignorant things about Japan.\n\nI was a Mikkyo follower, including Shugendo, for several years in my past,\nand even if no longer a buddhist, I still respect this way due to their\ntolerance towards others religions, unlike certain ones that promoted a real\nbloodshed in Europe, Japan, Brazil, etc...\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\nMessage: 10\n   Date: Wed, 4 Feb 2004 02:58:59 -0800 (PST)\n   From: Lee Changsub &lt;knorr31@...&gt;\nSubject: One minor point\n\nDear Group:\nI often have read discussions involving Buddihism as a\npart of the Japanese culture.\nWith regard to the connection of the Japanese Buddhism\nto that of India, South Asia, and Tibet, I want to\npoint out that they are significantly different.\n\nThe Japanese Buddism results from intellectual\ninteraction among Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism\nitself throughout centuries, the first two of which\ndid not really have much effect on India, South Asia,\nand Tibet.\nThrough this interaction, primitive Taoism and\nConfucianism was reborn as more subtle and complex\nphilosophy with rigorous logical structures in 5 and\n12 centuries respectivly.As for the proper terminology\nfor the present Taoism and Confuncianism for the\nWesterners, I personally think that words like\n&#39;Theoretical&#39; Taoism and Confuciansim would suit.\n\nThis is one of reasons why I think that we need to\nconsider having a distinctly different cultural\nclassification covering Japan, China, and\nKorea.(something like North Asia or North East Asia)\nThis may be one of fertile area of research for\nWestern scholars for the coming years. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Changsub Lee\n\n--- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Finally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not yet\n&gt; mollified by Western\n&gt; influences and got rid of  Buddhism.\n\n\n"
