Also, god only knows how many hundreds or thousands of\npages of firsthand information kept in temples and shrines around\njapan was destroyed by allied bombers during WWII - who knows what\nsort of information was lost.  Not to mention the fact that in some\ncases, some actual decendants of various clans are STILL holding\ntightly to personal letters and firsthand accounts from the 16th\ncentury without letting scholars getting a look at it because it is\n&#39;family matters&#39;.  The Sengoku era is still being slowly pieced\ntogether bit by bit, many temples have storage rooms that probably\nhavent been gone through in decades.  Last time I was in Japan, I went\nto a temple in Yamashina, Kyoto that after over 100 years brought out\na contemporary wood carving of Tokugawa Ieyasu that had been sitting\nin one such storage room.  Believe it or not, new Sengoku era\ninformation is still coming to light.  Within the past 8-10 years I\nread somewhere that some new documents found in a temple shed some new\nlight on one of the sengoku clans (can&#39;t remember any details.)  This\nis probably why all the bookstores not only have shelves and shelves\nof books exclusively on the Sengoku period, but also why there are new\nSengoku period books coming out yearly, if not monthly.  The\nscholarship in the West is decades and decades behind Japan -\nespeciallly when you have almost all of the &#39;classics&#39; about the\nSengoku in the West were written between 20 - 40 years ago, including\nSansom, Berry, Hall, etc.\n\nI&#39;m still waiting for the new Sengoku scholarship renaissance to hit\nthe West.\n\n\n"
