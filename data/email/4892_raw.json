Possibly made of stone.  I believe that the\n&gt; figurines represented either ancestorial or spiritual significance. \n&gt; If anyone knows of these figurines, could you please let me know the\n&gt; name of them.  Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \n_______________________________________________\nFind what you are looking for with the Lycos Yellow Pages\nhttp://r.lycos.com/r/yp_emailfooter/http://yellowpages.lycos.com/default.asp?SRC=lycos10\n\n\n\n"
