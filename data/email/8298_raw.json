He was a Japanese director who took some of his\ninspiration from Western sources.\n\nYou are absolutely correct that film are not really good guides to actual\nhistory. Both films, in many ways, deal with mythologies. But the\nmythologies come from different cultures, different sources. \n\nMAGNIFICENT SEVEN comes from Western American mythology, that of the noble\ngunfighter who helps Mexican peasants. When in fact most Western gunfighters\nwere quite mercentary and many of them hated Mexicans. \n\nSEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the noble ronin who helps\npeasants. When in fact, most Japanese ronin were mostly interested in\nconnecting with a clan. And they saw themselves as being apart from and\nsuperior to the farmers. \n\nHowever, the realities from which these mythologies spring from are quite\ndifferent. Once again: 19th century Western gunfighters were not the same at\nall as 17th century Japanese ronin.\n\nNina \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of James Eckman\nSent: Tuesday, January 31, 2006 1:35 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: Re: Magnificent Seven\n\n\n&gt;   From: nohit@...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;But the idea of a &quot;cowboy with a conscience&quot; who has a clear sense of \n&gt;&quot;right and wrong&quot; isn&#39;t at all like a 17th century Japanese ronin.\n&gt;\nI agree, but many Japanese think of Kurosawa as a WESTERN director so his\nchanbara films is some ways don&#39;t either. So maybe when comparing the two\nfilms they are a bit closer than one would think. Of course a better example\nwould be to read Dashiel Hammet&#39;s &#39;Red Harvest&#39; and watch Yojimbo knowing\nthat Kurosawa is a fan of detective novels.\n\n&gt;You notice that, in THE SEVEN SAMURAI, when the farmers come to recruit \n&gt;some ronin, most of the ronin turn up their noses -- that last thing on \n&gt;this earth that they would want to do is defend some farmers.\n&gt;\nI think films in general are poor guides to history. Anerican westerns are\nfor the most part phony as well having known people who actually lived in\nthe period there. For really quick reads Anthony Bryant&#39;s books are pretty\ngood and for a sloppy but readily available introduction one of the Turnbull\nbooks is OK. Just don&#39;t bother with the ninja one, the rest are pretty much\nrehashes of his previous ones.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com Samurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
