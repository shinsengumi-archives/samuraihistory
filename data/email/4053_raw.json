Can you imagine Rommel and Patton \n&gt;having gotten together for such a confab? &lt;G&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo. Nor can I imagine Lee and Grant doing the same!\n\nIn the West from time to time, there has been efforts to limit the \ndamage to civilians and each other. In most of Asia this is a foreign \nconcept for the most part even today.\n\nJim\n\n\n"
