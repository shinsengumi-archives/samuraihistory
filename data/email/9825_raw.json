This group is probably not the proper place for is. That be=\r\ning said though I have to mention some of the faluts in the arguement prese=\r\nnted agasint Zen as a religion. There are teachings. A follower of religiou=\r\ns Zen takes part in such rituals as the Boddhisatva vow and seeking refuge =\r\nin the three jewels. There are books. Just to list a few: Shobogenzo, Platf=\r\norm Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, Perfection of Wisdom is also used sometim=\r\nes, some times even the Lotus Sutra. I will ignore the argument about gods =\r\nbecause that is complex and I want to keep this short, other than saying yo=\r\nu are correct that generally gods are not represented. If you have the 27 y=\r\nears of experience you claim to have, I would think you would have heard of=\r\n at least a few books written by Chinese and Japanese Zen masters. Such mas=\r\nters also do write about past and future lifetimes and karma and duhka and =\r\nsamsara and\n many other core Buddhist concepts. One thing Zen strongly reje=\r\ncts that is often common in Chinese/Japanese Buddhism is the comcept of map=\r\npo. \n\n____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _\nLiit=\r\ny nyt uuteen Windows Live Messenger perheeseen\nhttp://get.live. com\n\n[Non-t=\r\next portions of this message have been removed]\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[N=\r\non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
