Few days ago I stated a question and there\n&gt; was now feedback so I&#39;ll try to ask again and in different way. I&#39;m\n&gt; doing some research on Toyotomi Hideyoshi and I&#39;d like to write\n&gt; something about those men who helped him on his way. Undoubtedly he was\n&gt; the warrior with great talent and he is the one who managed to rule the\n&gt; whole country. But there were also some man who figured as advisors or\n&gt; helped him or just acted in way, which gave Hideyoshi great chance to\n&gt; accomplish his mission (for example Sakuma Morimasa). I don&#39;t think that\n&gt; without those men, Hideyoshi won&#39;t be the ruler of Japan, but I just to\n&gt; know something about them and for my work I&#39;d like to know opinions of\n&gt; you on this subject. So if you could write me some names and the reason\n&gt; why do you think they helped him, I&#39;ll be grateful to you.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
