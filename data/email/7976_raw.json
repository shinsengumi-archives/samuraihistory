It is derived from the Hindu re=\r\nligious swastika, but it is not identical in meaning. \nThe Manji is made up=\r\n of several elements- a vertical axis representing the joining of heaven an=\r\nd earth, a horizontal axis representing the connection of yin and yang, and=\r\n the four arms, representing movement- the whirling force created by the in=\r\nteraction of these elements.\nWhen facing left, it is the Omote (front facin=\r\ng) Manji, representing love and mercy. Facing right, it represents strength=\r\n and intelligence, and is called the Ura (rear facing) Manji. \nIn Zen Buddh=\r\nism, the Manji represents the ideal harmony between love and intellect.&quot;\n  =\r\n   I found it interesting that even though the manji is not the wheel of Dh=\r\narma, it still represents part of the concept. The manji also seemingly has=\r\n different meanings for different Japanese sects (which really shouldn&#39;t su=\r\nrprise me, but does). \n\n\n\n\n"
