He is now writing a book on the Sengoku\n   Daimyo--I have read a chapter, and it&#39;s indeed awesome.\n   Bye, cepo\n\nIf you havent done so already, you should read Kenneth Butler&#39;s works on \nthe Heike Monogatari, specifically &quot;The Heike Monogatari and the Japanese \nWarrior Ethic&quot; In Harvard Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 29 (1969), pp. \n93-108.\n\nIn it, Butler makes a good case about the origins of the descriptions of \nwarriors in the Heike coming from the oral performers of the tale -- the \nrepetition a tool for  both effect and ease of memorization.  Even a \ncursory reading of the text will provide one will the sense that there is \nsomething formulaic to the descriptions of both the warriors&#39; appearance \nand many of the encounters.  \n\nHaving personally not read them I cannot speak for the other war tales, but \nmy understanding is that most (if not all) of them, too, were oral \npresentations and meant as entertainment.  Although I look forward to \nreading Varley&#39;s work, I remain skeptical that any book can claim that that \nrepresented in the war tales can be taken to be as you say &quot;what the real \ncharacter of the Japanese warriors was&quot;.  More likely the tales represent \nthe way in which the warriors wanted the other strata of society to view \nthem, or simply an aggrandizement for dramatic effect in the same way that \nwe see now police &quot;buddy movies&quot; in which the characters are larger than \nlife, possess a moral rectitude that defies the corrupt system surrounding \nthem, etc.\n\nWe must remember that these are monogatari, &quot;tales&quot;, and not meant to be \ntaken as historically accurate treatises.  Had that been their purpose they \nwould have been named &quot;ki&quot; or &quot;kagami.&quot;\n\nCheers,\n\nShannon\n\n\nS.
