I haven&#39;t read &#39;The Last Shogun&#39; yet (right now\ni&#39;m reading &quot;A History of Japan, 1615-1867&quot;) but &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;\nis an excellent book. It describes Saigo Takamori&#39;s life and the War\nof the Southwest (also known as the Satsuma Rebellion). It&#39;s\ninteresting to note that Saigo used several names when corresponding\nwith other people. One of the names Saigo Takamori used when writing\npoetry was &#39;Saigo Nanshï¿½&#39; which means Saigo of the South. With\nthis name Saigo refers to the Southern Court (Go-Daigo&#39;s Southern\nline). Torn between truly unifying (under the Emperor) and\nmodernizing Japan and his loyalty towards the ideals of the samurai\nclass and his Lord Shimazu, Saigo&#39;s life was interesting indeed.\n\nNahless\n\nP.S. Should you have specific questions about this book, just let me\nknow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\nYahoo!
