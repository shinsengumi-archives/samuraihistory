The second blade a medium sized one, was\ncalled &quot;Wakisashi&quot;, it was a small katana made as\ncompanion for the &quot;Katana&quot; which is the third one and\nthe longest in this fashion.\nA double sword kake: whit a Wakisashi and a Katana, is\ncalled a &quot;Daisho&quot; ( also when a person is using this,\nit is said he is wearing a daisho ) in a Daisho \nswords are called Daito and Shoto respectively.\nBest regards.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nCorreo Yahoo!\nEspacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis! \nReg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/ \n\n\n\n\n"
