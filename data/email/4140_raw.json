Ieyasu surely did. \n\nAs was stated before, the story about Japanese mothers\nusing Nobunaga to scare their kids into obeying is\nplain silliness--William&#39;s never heard of it, I&#39;ve\nnever heard of it, I doubt Kitsuno, Tony, et al have\nheard of it. I doubt Kitsuno&#39;s Japanese wife,\nWilliam&#39;s Japanese wife, their Japanese families,\netc., have heard of it. My Japanese friends haven&#39;t\nheard of it, either. \n\nYesterday I picked up several manga with Nobunaga as\nthe HERO. Characterizing him as a terrorist is naive.\nThe Japanese surely don&#39;t see him that way. Harsh\nsometimes, yes. So was Alexander the Great. So was\nSuleiman. So was Ghengis Khan. That hardly makes any\nof them, including Nobunaga, evil. We went over this\nbefore when someone compared him to Hitler--which is\nabsolutely RIDICULOUS. \n\nYeah, Nobunaga killed Buddhist priests--the same ones\nthat defied his rule, harbored his enemies, attacked\nhis supply lines, and openly declared themselves his\nenemies. He destroyed MT Hiei to eliminate it as a\nTHREAT, not because he was satan incarnate. Oh my\ngosh, he had women and children killed! So did\neveryone else at the time--nobody then operated under\nthe Geneva or Hague conventions. \n\nNobunaga didn&#39;t enact a &quot;final solution&quot; against the\nIga ninja, aimed at systematically eliminating them as\na people by destroying anyone born in Iga. They defied\nhis control, so he acted to control them. Reality of\n16th century Japan. \n\nQuit thinking in terms of modern media. You can&#39;t\napply modern battlefield ethics to 1945 (could you\nIMAGINE the outcry that wholesale firebombing of\ncities would creat today??), much less 1575. \n\nNate\n\n--- Me�al_Mikit_St�r-ljon_Oddhinsson\n&lt;medhal8@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The one who brought peace to Japan and unified it\n&gt; was not Nobunaga Child-Eater Terrorist!\n&gt; \n&gt; Was Ieyassu Tokugawa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ask the remainds of the IIGA clan who killed this\n&gt; assassin, what they think\n&gt; about him as a &quot;unifier&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone who do a massacre and genocide against\n&gt; weaponless civilians should\n&gt; not desserve to be respected.\n&gt; \n&gt; Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\n&gt; S�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
