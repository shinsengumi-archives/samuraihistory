However, if you know they are not a Worldly Prote=\r\nctor, but a Dharma Protector, then you understand they are paying refuge to=\r\n a Buddha.=C3=82=C2=A0 So you need to know if that being is a worldly prote=\r\nctor or a dharma protector. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 In the earlier letter, it sounded like he=\r\n (Eddie?)=C3=82=C2=A0was saying that Buddha&#39;s God was Amida ?

(Hence the fact that Shinto shrines a=\r\nre such a common \n&gt; fixture in so many Buddhist temples).\n&gt; \n&gt; I got the im=\r\npression that this changed substantially during the Meiji \n&gt; restoration an=\r\nd into WWII, when the government pressed the notion of the \n&gt; Imperial line=\r\nage (the descent from Amaterasu-o- Mikami) as evidence that Japan was \n&gt; un=\r\nder the unique protection of the gods / kami, as a result of which a very \n=\r\n&gt; strict separation of church and state was written into the post-war \n&gt; co=\r\nnstitution. ..\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I missing anything substantial here? My personal exp=\r\nerience of Japan \n&gt; was that the temples and shrines were largely appreciat=\r\ned for their historic \n&gt; nature; I seldom saw religious ceremonies going on=\r\n (apart from New Year&#39;s \n&gt; Day, when people arrived, made their offerings, =\r\nand departed) the way I did \n&gt; in Korea, for example.
