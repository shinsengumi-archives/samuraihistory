As I recall, the sword-hunt was in\n&gt; the 1590&#39;s but the \n&gt; Tokugawa really didn&#39;t get into power for a couple\n&gt; of decades or so. \n\nThe Edo period began in 1600 or 1603, depending on\nwhether you date from Sekigahara or the beginning of\nthe Tokugawa Shogunate. You&#39;re correct, the sword hunt\nwas in 1588--12 to 15 years earlier. However, it&#39;s not\nlike he gave the order and *poof* things were\nsolidified. Major social changes like this take a\nlittle time to take effect. You could argue that up\nthrough the Osaka campaign, it was possible to change\nstatus through armed conflict--certainly enough\noutside the establishment joined the Toyotomi cause in\norder to make a name for themselves. The majority\nwould have been ronin, and you could say they were &quot;in\nthe samurai class&quot;, but I hardly think they checked\nfor Samurai ID cards at the door. \n\nI&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m considering 12 years as an\ninsignificant stretch of time in the 1000 years of\nsamurai history. Especially in this case, the Sword\nHunt and the social concepts it heralded were direct\nprecursors to the social order of the Tokugawa period,\nand not part of the Sengoku. Hideyoshi wasn&#39;t merely\nbefore the Tokugawa, he set the stage for it. The idea\nwas there, the law was there, but it really only\nbecame something solid after peace. People up unto the\n1630&#39;s still had the institutional memory of the\nprevious social order--I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a\ncoincidence that the last major rebellion against the\nTokugawa, the Shimabara Rebellion, was a\ncommoner/lower-class samurai rebellion that took place\nin the 1630&#39;s. Past this, anybody who had any memory\nof commoners carrying weapons and partaking in combat\nwas dead--the rest accepted the status quo because\nit&#39;s all they knew. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
