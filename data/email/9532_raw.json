Numbers aren&#39;t everything of course, and it was\ngood strategy on the Oda&#39;s part in using the terrain as they did, but to\nme it just seems that the Oda took the &quot;obvious&quot; strategy. As an army\ncoming to break a siege, they did what any army would have, or at least\nshould have, done.\n \n&gt;No one at this time had &quot;rifles&quot;, as they hadn&#39;t been\n&gt;invented yet. The arquebus was a smoothbore weapon.\n\nAye, It&#39;s a bad habit that I should break.\n \n&gt;And while the Nagashino scene in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; is\n&gt;completely ridiculous, do not discount the effect of a\n&gt;cavalry charge against unprotected arquebusiers. \n \nMy problem is with the whole image of the samurai cavalry charge.\nSupposedly mounted samurai dismounted in combat and didn&#39;t fight from\nhorseback and rarely, if ever, formed units of pure cavalry. This comes\nfrom descriptions taken from They Came to Japan, the size of Japanese\nhorses, and comments by Prof. Karl Friday in several usenet posts.\n\n&gt;...Add in the aura of the\n&gt;Takeda Cavalry, and the fact that most ashigaru\n&gt;(before Nobunaga made them a major factor in battle,\n&gt;anyways) were poorly trained and disciplined, and\n&gt;there was no real reason for the Takeda to expect they\n&gt;couldn&#39;t succeed. \n\nAye, I agree, I&#39;m sure they did expect to win, especially considering\nthat the Takeda and Oda both believed that the Takeda army was more\nnumerous. But it wasn&#39;t, not even close in fact, and they were\nthoroughly routed.\n \n&gt;If what you want is political repercussions, see\n&gt;Sekigahara. Tactically, it bores me, while Nagashino\n&gt;fascinates me. No one ever talks about the Sakai\n&gt;Tadatsugu raid behind the Takeda, or the actual siege\n&gt;of Nagashino itself--fascinating maneuvers. The Takeda\n&gt;operation was sound, actually, had the traitor in\n&gt;Okazaki Castle not been uncovered. \n \nI find the events around the actual battle of Nagashino more interesting\nthan the battle itself, but maybe that&#39;s just my taste in history, which\nmight explain why I prefer Sekigahara to Nagashino. The story of how\nNobunaga learnt of the siege and came to break it is interesting, as is\nthe damage to the Takeda caused by the battle. Maybe hindsight is 20/20,\nbut the actual battle itself, once it took place, heavily favoured the\nOda and they came out on top. I don&#39;t find much interesting about it,\nbut again maybe that says more about my tastes in history than the\nbattle itself.\n \n-AngusH\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
