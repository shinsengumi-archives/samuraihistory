A \ndevoted scholar he dedicated himself to the study of Japanese history, \nsponsored the writing of the Dai Nihon Shi, and &quot;discovered&quot; Kusunoki \nMasashige making him a national hero. His Mito school of history \nfavored things Japanese over Chinese, Shinto over Buddhism and the \nEmperor over the Shogun. The spread of this school of thought laid the \nfoundations for the national debate that arose when the Americans came \nand showed the Bakufu to be lacking in leadership, and thus the Meiji \nRestoration.\n\tHe may have travelled in cognito ,&quot;as a commoner&quot;, once or twice and \nthat fact has given rise to a series of books which then became a TV \nshow and there has been a movie as well I believe. The gimmick is that \nno commoner could wear or carry the Tokugawa mon, so in the climactic \nscenes he whips out his inro to the shock of all, who now see that he \nis a Lord and not just some meddling old man...\n-t\n\n\n"
