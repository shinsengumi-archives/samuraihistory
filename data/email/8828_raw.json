I call it the &#39;Sir Walter Scott&#39; effect though it \ngoes back even further in history than that.\n\n&gt;2)       Can we &quot;market&quot; the samurai list in such a way that the purpose of\n&gt;the list is better communicated to list members and potential members? How\n&gt;can we better communicate our purpose as discussion of serious (but fun)\n&gt;Japan history, as opposed to discussion of the ninja crowd, or video game\n&gt;aficionados, or martial artists, or manga?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGive them to Tony along with a flensing knive? Change the group name to \nsomething so obscure that nobody can find it? Force people to take a \nlangauge test showing that they can write in their native tongue? Have \nthem prove that they have read the FAQ? We have moderators when it comes \ndown to extremes.\n\n&gt;4)       Can we create a discussion environment where we encourage more open\n&gt;free discussion without intimidation, and yet still raise the level of\n&gt;discourse?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat requires communication both ways. Some people require an \napplication of brute force for this to occur. I haven&#39;t found the &#39;beat&#39; \nkey on my computer yet, but if I ever do, I&#39;m going back to books!\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
