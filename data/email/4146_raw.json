Seeing \nNobunaga as a &quot;demon&quot; and all of that is definitely a modern, and it \nseems to me western, way to interpret what he accomplished. But even \ncontemporary and Japanese sources do agree that Nobunaga was \nsomething fierce. The Hiei-zan incident in particular is pointed to \nas being well over the top, but there are several others.\n\nSo I think it is fair to say that Nobunaga&#39;s methods were indeed \nfearsome and from time to time were quite out of the norm even \nwithin the context of the time period in Japan.\n\nMy own interpretation of it is that Nobunaga really did go further \nthan most people of the time. One the one hand, this could be seen \nas &quot;terrorism&quot; or something similar by those people who can read \nhistory only in the context of their own personal, modern \nexperiences. On the other hand, this willingness to do these kind \nof deeds probably is a symptom of whatever it was that Nobunaga &quot;had&quot; \nthat allowed him to play the historical role that he did.\n\n&gt;i believe he was just a man of his time who managed to rise above his lowly\n&gt;start in the same way as Genghis Khan and is just seen through the eyes of a\n&gt;modern man as a murderer, even though he wasnt at the time.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
