I&#39;m targeting this at anyone currently studying \nJapanese history in a university / college, (particularly A.J. \nBryant).  I doubt that the sources used are the 20 - 40 year old \nVarley, Sansom, Reischauer, Berry, etc...?   \nNew scholarship in Japan comes out yearly, so are there books in \nenglish (textbooks, etc.) for students currently being written by \nprofessors for these Japanese history students?  I have been getting \nmost of my info from varous books in Japanese, including the Rekishi \nGunzo series, and other sources, by historians such as Kuwada \nNagachika and Kasaya Kazuhiko among others, but would like to find \nout what sort of resources &#39;university students&#39; of Japanese \nhistory / sengoku actually get. I doubt that students are required to \nactually learn Japanese, read Japanese sources, including old \njapanese, or are they?\n\nAs you can tell, I&#39;m particularly interested in the type of (and \navailability of) these textbooks, if they exist.  Hey, why reinvent \nthe wheel?  if the sort of info I&#39;m getting from Japanese sources is \nthe same as what is hidden away in University libraries in english, \nI&#39;d choose english!\n\n\n"
