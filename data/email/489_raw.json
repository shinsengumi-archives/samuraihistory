She wasn&#39;t modified into a\ncarrier till 1935. The Akagi was also originally built as a battle cruiser\nand converted to a CV, so her name isn&#39;t consistent with Japanese CV names.\n\nThe &quot;ry�&quot; was common in CVs; it means &quot;dragon.&quot; Other common elements in CV\nnames were &quot;kaku&quot; (crane), &quot;h�&quot; (phoenix), and &quot;sh�&quot; (soar).\n\nS�ryu is &quot;blue dragon&quot;; Hiry� is &quot;flying dragon&quot;; Sh�kaku is &quot;soaring\ncrane&quot;; Sh�h� is &quot;soaring phoenix&quot;; Zuikaku is &quot;felicitous crane.&quot;\n\nTony\n\n\n\n"
