I will look through these \nlinks and see what I can discover.  As for the scrolls/books show by Mr. \nRichardson I think we might be on a different page.  The kind of scroll I am \ntalking about is the decorative one hung on the wall with Shohou work done \non it.  I could be wrong and the information I seek might very well be in \nyour links.  Either way, thank you both.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n\n\n&gt;From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Digest Number 996\n&gt;Date: 23 Nov 2004 20:05:21 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There are 5 messages in this issue.\n&gt;\n&gt;Topics in this digest:\n&gt;\n&gt;       1. is sephiroth a samurai\n&gt;            From: &quot;Sephiroth&quot; &lt;o0o0sephiroth0o0o@...&gt;\n&gt;       2.

However, she does not know how to construct \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; scrolls once the work has been done on the rice paper. Does anyone on \n&gt;here\n&gt; &gt; know how to properly construct a scroll? Any assistance that you can \n&gt;offer\n&gt; &gt; will be muchly appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve only made one, it was not a great job. That was no fault of the \n&gt;teacher who was an expert. It&#39;s not something you will probably get right \n&gt;the first time. You can get them mounted in the US probably for $100-200 \n&gt;each. So if the work is valuable or a gift you probably want to pay a pro \n&gt;or practice several times with it before mounting them. I&#39;m away from my \n&gt;books for a few days so I can&#39;t give really good references now. Some \n&gt;stores listed here though:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://home.comcast.net/~ronin_engineer/sumi.html\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m also experimenting with unconventional mounting methods that use iron \n&gt;activated interfacing material found in fabric stores. It&#39;s a lot less \n&gt;messy and tedious than the conventional wet mounting methods and irons are \n&gt;used in traditional Japanese bookmaking so it might last a while.
