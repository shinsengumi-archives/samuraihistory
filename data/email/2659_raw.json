Now, the problem is that, even \ntoday, it would be impossible to have 1,000 people to shoot exactly in \nsynchro fashion, especially with a 16th c. weapon. So, the number of \nshooters might have been inflated by Nobunaga&#39;s side, just to impress \nthe other daimyo.\nDr.Varley told me that there is a new article by one of his colleagues \n(sorry, forgot to ask who) that examines the battle from a \nhistorical/martial point of view. It is not published, but he&#39;ll let me \nhave a copy--so, I&#39;ll be back to you once I have read it.\ncepo, honolulu\n\n\n"
