Depending on \nrequirements, System A and/or System B can be used. When operating \nSystem A, depress lever and a plastic dalkron unsubscriber will be \ndispensed through the slot immediately underneath. When you have \nfastened the adhesive lip, attach connection marked by the large &#39;X&#39; \noutlet hose. Twist the silver-colored ring one inch below the \nconnection point until you feel it lock.\n\nThe kit is now ready for use.\n\nThe Cin-Eliminator is activated by the small switch on the lip. When \nsecuring, twist the ring back to its initial condition, so that the \ntwo orange lines meet. Disconnect. Place the dalkron unsubscriber in \nthe vacuum receptacle to the rear. Activate by pressing the blue \nbutton. The controls for System B are located on the opposite side. \nThe red release switch places the Cin-Eliminator into position; it \ncan be adjusted manually up or down by pressing the blue manual \nrelease button. The opening is self-adjusting. To secure after use, \npress the green button, which simultaneously activates the evaporator \nand returns the Cin-Eliminator to its storage position.\n\nYou may log off if the green exit light is on over the evaporator. If \nthe red light is illuminated, one of the Cin-Eliminator requirements \nhas not been properly implemented. Press the &quot;List Guy&quot; call button \non the right of the evaporator . He will secure all facilities from \nhis control panel.\n\nTo use the Auto-Unsub, first undress and place all your clothes in \nthe clothes rack. Put on the velcro slippers located in the cabinet \nimmediately below. Enter the shower, taking the entire kit with you. \nOn the control panel to your upper right upon entering you will see \na &quot;Shower seal&quot; button. Press to activate. A green light will then be \nilluminated immediately below. On the intensity knob, select the \ndesired setting. Now depress the Auto-Unsub activation lever. Bathe \nnormally. The Auto-Unsub will automatically go off after three \nminutes unless you activate the &quot;Manual off&quot; override switch by \nflipping it up. When you are ready to leave, press the blue &quot;Shower \nseal&quot; release button. The door will open and you may leave. Please \nremove the velcro slippers and place them in their container.\n\nIf you prefer the ultrasonic log-off mode, press the indicated blue \nbutton. When the twin panels open, pull forward by rings A & B. The \nknob to the left, just below the blue light, has three settings, low, \nmedium or high. For normal use, the medium setting is suggested. \nAfter these settings have been made, you can activate the device by \nswitching to the &quot;ON&quot; position the clearly marked red switch. If \nduring the unsubscribing operation, you wish to change the settings, \nplace the &quot;manual off&quot; override switch in the &quot;OFF&quot; position. You may \nnow make the change and repeat the cycle. When the green exit light \ngoes on, you may log off and have lunch. You will then be \nunsubscribed from Yahoo samuraihistory.\n\nThe second option is to follow the directions included at the bottom \nof every email message from this group:\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n\n\n"
