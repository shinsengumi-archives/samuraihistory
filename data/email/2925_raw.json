After that, it would be returned to the maker to be stamped how \n&gt;well it held up, but it was mroe for a durability test than a sharpness \n&gt;test, as any sharp blade could cut, but not every blade would stay intact. \n&gt;Some may crack or even break entirely if the craftsmanship was flawed. \n&gt; \n&gt;Wilson \n&gt; \n&gt;-- \n&gt; \n&gt;--------- Original Message --------- \n&gt;DATE: Mon, 15 Dec 2003 12:13:27 \n&gt;From: Chris Ketterling \n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Cc: \n&gt; \n&gt;Actually the blades use to have a symbol for how many \n&gt;bodies it could slice through which determined how \n&gt;sharp it was. \n&gt; \n&gt;--- Josh Wilson wrote: \n&gt;&gt; Well AJ, I reckon its my turn *smacks his head on \n&gt;&gt; the desk* How sharp is any blade??
