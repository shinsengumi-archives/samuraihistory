Apparently when Perry came in and opened up with Cannon Fire in the Harbor, the Emperor took notice, as did everyone in Edo. The general gist is they figured there was no way to avoid the changes around them and they better catch up to protect themselves. This meant going from &quot;Warrior to Soldier&quot; as it was put. But it also impacted them culturally with the Western styles and traditions coming into play. It opened up more &quot;freedom&quot; but much was lost along the way.\n   \n  The system in place (feudal, Hierarchy) in my opinion is a natural and stable point for humans. It has worked for thousands of years in every part of the world and only in the last 500 years has &quot;Democracy&quot; come en-vogue&#39;. Even then, the Emperor still ruled, but the Council moved the country to a more European style because the saw some good to the people in some of the ways of the foreigners. \n   \n  The discipline was there on a personal/clan level, but the country as a whole was not united and I think this was another reason for the changes. &quot;Divided we Fall&quot; seems to be a definite issue on the mind of the ruling class. \n   \n  All in all, I think they could have made a certain amount of a western move without destroying the system or the Samurai, but the external influences to me proved to overwhelming to do so. It was easier to give in.\n   \n  I am sure there is much more to add that I have missed, but I am still in the early stages of study. I am open to correction and addition. The whole point of a group like this is to learn...\n  \n\ncathamstershadow &lt;cathamstershadow@...&gt; wrote:\n  why did japan get rid of the shoguns and emperors japan was well off \nwithout the united states forcing them to open their country if you \nask me the japanese had more control and were more diciplined than the \namericans. one of our presidents once said the only way to keep our \ngovernment honest was to have a rebelion every once in a while  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
