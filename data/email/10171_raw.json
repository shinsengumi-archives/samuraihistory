Maybe in some parts of=C2=A0 Japan itself people ge=\r\nt tight about this..\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0.. but... lets look at a different situat=\r\nion..\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0For many Japanese-living in American and Japanese=C2=A0A=\r\nmericans (immigrants and citizens) it is simply a matter of being brought i=\r\nnto the family AND being trusted/liked enough.=C2=A0 Basically, the more im=\r\nportant you are, the more &quot;inside&quot; you get... etc.etc.. Especially if that =\r\nfamily branch only had daughters and they need an &quot;adopted son&quot; to continue=\r\n the line.. you think you won&#39;t get the crest?=C2=A0 I can&#39;t imagine someon=\r\ne being so ethnocentric/xenophobic as to let their family line DIE than to =\r\nplace it in the hands of their trusted &quot;adopted son&quot;.\n=C2=A0Grant it.. we a=\r\nll have probably seen situations where the DAUGHTER will pass it down to th=\r\ne kids, and the non-japanese guy is completely skipped over.. This DOES hap=\r\npen.. but does not HAVE to happen. The key factor is usually the guys invol=\r\nvement in the wife&#39;s family... does he really fit into the family as a &quot;cla=\r\nn member&quot; or.. is he just that white guy that the daughter happened to marr=\r\ny ?\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Devotion to the cause plays a big role in this equat=\r\nion. How many white husbands have Japanese wives --but don&#39;t have any inter=\r\nest in Japanese culture or the family affairs ? That is why they are not &quot;i=\r\nn&quot;... because they don&#39;t want to be. \n=C2=A0\nANyway.... \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0The c=\r\nhoice rest with the family. It is THEIR crest, they decide who wears it. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0Somone might say that a family does not count if they are outs=\r\nide of Japan--- and to this, all I can say is :\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0&quot;Wow.. I didn&#39;=\r\nt realize that the simple act of crossing a political border could erase th=\r\nousands of years of family history ... thats is amazing !\n=C2=A0Ooohh oohh.=\r\n.. If we go BACK to Japan, will that history magically reappear ?&quot;\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 Again... it is not about swords, borders, or doctrine... It is=\r\n about the family itself. If the family authorizes you to wear the crest, y=\r\nou wear the crest. \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 So.. like I said before--- either a family takes you in and gives=\r\n you authorization to wear the crest..\n=C2=A0.. OR.. you just make one up y=\r\nourself (like most commoners did at the beginning of the Meiji)=C2=A0 and p=\r\nass it down..\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n\n--- On Sun, 4/18/10, Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n=\r\nFrom: Cearb@... &lt;Cearb@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory]\nTo: samur=\r\naihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Sunday, April 18, 2010, 5:36 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n=\r\n\n\nMy GUESS is that you don&#39;t.\n\nIt&#39;s very nearly impossible for foreigners t=\r\no even get Japanese \ncitizenship, much less become a member of a traditiona=\r\nl family.
