It \nwas close by to the capital and thus was important to protect the \nShogun and the emperor. The Ashikaga were shoguns in control during \nthe early Sengoku period, they retained control until 1573 when \nNobunaga marched into Kyoto. It is a complicated area, as the Miyoshi \nand Matsunaga clans + Hatakeyama, Hosokawa, Rokkaku all were \ncompeting for land and power. The Tsuitsui had to resist all these \nefforts, but in 1568 when Nobunaga entered the Kinai region he allied \nwith him, and became daimyou of the Yamato territory. As regards to \nhis retainers, their is not much info as to many but Shima Sakon is \nwell known a retainer of Tsutsui Junkei&#39;s later became one of \nIshida&#39;s lieutenants for Sekigahara.\n\nI thought I knew more, but can&#39;t think of anymore, does this help?\nI think you have to realise it won&#39;t be easy finding info about this \nfamily unless you speak Japanese or find a good source book.\n\n\n"
