And the lines that \n&gt;are in the beginning or a little on the hokey side. Although the art work \n&gt;is very good. I am not sure about the monster thing. Will be interesting to \n&gt;see what comes next and if it helps to make the story itself make more \n&gt;sense.\n&gt;\n&gt;I will forward this post to my daughter; she is a Comic Book store owner \n&gt;and is friend with alot of people in the business. She also has a screen \n&gt;name for this forum; but I have never scene her post on here. Could be a \n&gt;first. Keep at it. I am certainly not saying that you do not have potential \n&gt;and the art work as I said before is very good. I am thinking that there \n&gt;may be a market for a Historical Japanese comic book. Sure would save alot \n&gt;of post on here LOL.

Historic accuracy right out the window! Read on if you dare!\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve got so much churning around in my head that I need an outlet.\n&gt;Well, I&#39;ve dedicated my web comic to just such an outlet. If you&#39;ve\n&gt;never heard of a &quot;web comic&quot;, well its a sequential artwork story\n&gt;(comic book) on the World Wide Web; hence web-comic. eh? eh? Nice huh :)\n&gt;\n&gt;anyway, here is something fun that some of you might enjoy reading...\n&gt;its FREE... just me expressing my artistry.\n&gt;\n&gt;http://banditt. uber-geek. us/web-comic. html\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m trying to really recreate an authentic Manga. I&#39;ve bought &quot;Manga\n&gt;Studio&quot; to do toner and between that and Photoshop, I&#39;m getting some\n&gt;nice effects. All illustrations are HAND DRAWN. I scan in my\n&gt;manuscripts and then add the text and toner.\n&gt;\n&gt;If anyone has some feedback regarding the attempts, by golly, let me\n&gt;have it! :) I love hearing from folks and trying to make myself\n&gt;better. Who knows? Maybe Tokyo Pop will pick me up down the road?\n&gt;*dear God PLEASE let SOMEBODY pick me up, I NEED the steady work!*\n&gt;And Please feel free to pass the word on, if you know someone who\n&gt;might enjoy the story.\n&gt;\n&gt;thanks and as always, your humble little Sanada wanabe (pun),\n&gt;~Jason/Katsu\n&gt;\n&gt;____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _\n&gt;AOL now offers free email to everyone.
