Katsumoto is supposed to \nrepresent Saigo Takamori. \n&gt; Check out this site:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.emory.edu/HISTORY/RAVINA/lastsamurai.html\n&gt; \n&gt; You said, &quot;the way of the samurai and all was working just fine! \nWhy were they trying to \n&gt; become so modern???&quot; Here&#39;s an answer:\n&gt; \n&gt; The samurai were feudal warriors... basically Japanese fighting \nother Japanese, hidden behind \n&gt; a curtain of isolationism. Well, the long-practiced isolationism \nended with the intrusion of  \n&gt; Perry&#39;s ships. When that curtain fell, Japan saw a bigger world \nwith a lot of potential enemies. \n&gt; Japan realized it could not defend itself. Japan had to unify and \nmodernize in order to defend \n&gt; itself from invasion. The samurai tactics of war were well-suited \nfor fighting other sword-bearing \n&gt; foes on the island of Japan. But if could do very little against a \nnavy fleet.  \n&gt; The Japanese were no longer concerned with how to defend \nthemselves from other Japanese. \n&gt; They had to know how to defend themselves from everybody else. \nEmperor Meiji simply \n&gt; responded to the impetus of potential attack from other nations.\n\n\n"
