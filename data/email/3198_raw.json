I \nwould highly recommend the Open University based in the UK for any \ndistance learning. I got an English Literature degree with them and \ntheir standards are very high. I also did it while travelling around \nEurope (posted essays via UPS). So I don&#39;t think it matters which \ncountry you&#39;re in. Again, I don&#39;t know if they do a course on \nJapanese history. Take a look at their website. \nhttp://www.open.ac.uk/\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Randall Edwards&quot; \n&lt;tcma66@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I am relatively new to the group so this might be a stupid question \nbut I \n&gt; was wondering if any of you could point me in the right direction \nof getting \n&gt; a degree in Japanese history.  I know I should check out my local \ncollege  \n&gt; but it seems they do not have a program.  Also do any of you know \nif it is \n&gt; possible to get a degree by doing distance learning?  I would \nappreciate any \n&gt; help I could get.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Randall Edwards\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Rethink your business approach for the new year with the helpful \ntips here. \n&gt; http://special.msn.com/bcentral/prep04.armx\n\n\n"
