That&#39;s just a working \ntitle, though, I&#39;m sure something else will come up.\n\nThanks to all for the most excellent information, it helps \ntremendously; and yet I have many more questions. (I&#39;ll ask those in \ndue time, though.) As for the book, I was wondering: I know this \nisn&#39;t a writing critique group, but if I posted the backstory- about \nhow the revenge gets set up, the basic kernal of the story- would you \nguys be willing to take a look and tell me if it&#39;s _logical_ enough? \nI know there is a definite component of fantasy, and I am making very \nfree with some aspects of the Japanese culture, but I&#39;d at least like \nto get as close as I can to _some_ kind of historical accuracy.\n\nI realize this is off-subject, but this is the best resource I have \nfor this book and I want to do it right. So you know I&#39;m not a \nweirdo: (or at least, I am a successful weirdo, LOL) my website is at \nhttp://www.lilithsaintcrow.com . I have three ebooks out, a four-book \ncontract with a romance publisher (even writers have to eat, guys) \nand am negotiating with an agent for another book. If the \nnegotiations go successfully I might be able to sell this book to a \npublisher too. So there is a very real chance of this thing acheiving \nfruition- all of which I tell you so that you know I won&#39;t be wasting \nprecious list time and posts.\n\nI&#39;d also be grateful for any help anyone would want to give offlist, \nas I know this isn&#39;t the sort of thing you guys usually do here. If \nI&#39;ve offended by asking for this, please let me know, and forgive me. \nI&#39;m just really excited by this book and the characters, and I want \nto do them justice.\n\n\n"
