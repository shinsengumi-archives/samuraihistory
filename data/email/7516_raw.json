According\n&gt; to some sources he died fighting at Nagashino (as far\n&gt; as I remember Turbull&#39;s Sourcebook implies this as do\n&gt; other sites and I&#39;m pretty sure he dies there is\n&gt; Kurosawa&#39;s Kagemusha) however according to the Samurai\n&gt; archives he dies when captured by Nobunaga&#39;s troops in\n&gt; 1852.\n&gt;\nThanks for reminding me.\n\nI&#39;m just starting to get back to the e-mail (and I have a hellacious \nbacklog!), and am getting the books out.\n\nAccording to the Sengoku jinmei jiten, he was killed in 1582 during \nNobunaga&#39;s attack on Kai.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \nYahoo!
