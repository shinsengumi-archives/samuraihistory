I am \ngoing back and relooking at my information to ensure accuracy.  \n\nWith regards to The Battle of Hitotori Bridge between the Date and \nHatakeyama, I am unable to find a map scale or any references to \ndistances in the sources I have.  When I made a scenario for this a \ncouple years ago I went by a painting and an &quot;estimated guess&quot; on the \ndistances.  I&#39;d like to be accurate this time.\n\nIf anyone could point out the distances between any of the following \nplaces I can use that as a guide.\n\nPlaces in the battle:\n\nTown of Arai\nTakakura Castle\nSetogawa mansion\nMotomiya Castle\nMount Daimyokura\nHitotori Bridge\nMount Kannondo\n\nThanks,\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
