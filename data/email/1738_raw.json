When the \nJapanese surrendered they stockpiled the weapons (firearms, blades, etc) \nusually at harbors, airfields, or some other major location so that the \nAmerican forces could easily collect them.  In most cases the officers in \ncharge of the local military units would allow the soldiers to pick through \nthe piles and take what they wanted.  That is how my grandfather got his \nrifle and sword.\n  Very rarely did a soldier kill an officer on the battlefield and take his \nsword then.  For two reasons.  One, killing an officer would require getting \nclose enough to have killed all the other soldiers around him.  Two, they \nwere in the middle of a war, they would not have had time to bend down and \npick up a sword while avoiding flying bullets.\n  I hope that this helps you determine how the weapons were acquired.  The \nmore posts I read about it the more I believe that you have a very nice \nfind.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt Williams\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
