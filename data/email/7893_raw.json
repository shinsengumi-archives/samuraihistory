And\nalso be judged as to what sort of source that it is.\n\nTo use an example: is the film SEPPUKU &quot;entertainment?&quot; Who has seen this\nfilm and could say that they were &quot;entertained&quot; by it? It is tenuous in the\nextreme to say that its purpose was to depict absolute fact i.e. that a real\nperson named Tsugumo Hanshiro existed in history and he avenged the death of\nthis son-in-law against the Ii clan. But to say that the film (and the novel\non which it is based) was made only to entertain, not in any way to discuss\nhistory, would be equally tenuous to state. \n\nNina  \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 10:16 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai? (was RE: R\ne: h itokiri kawaka\n\n[snips]\n\nMy statements were originally to the effect that fiction is fiction, history\nis history, and that if you want the facts of history, go study history. The\nonly argument to that that I can see would be the opposite: historical facts\nare better found in fiction than in history books. Is this what you, Nina,\nand you, Onnagozen, are indeed saying? Can you please explain how in the\nworld you would reach this conclusion? I think it&#39;s fairly cynical (and\ntrust me, I&#39;m as cynical as they come, so you can imagine my shock) to say\nthat watching a move would teach you more about actual, factual history than\nopening a history book would. While today&#39;s kids may embrace that method of\nteaching, personally, I&#39;d be horrified if for history class everyday my kids\nchucked the textbooks and popped in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; to learn about the\nUS Civil War. As much as I love Taiga Drama, I don&#39;t see Japanese students\nwatching &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; as definitive fact of the rise of Toyotomi. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nYahoo!
