Now, letting others admire and appreciate the\nblade of the sword I really don&#39;t, I think it could be\nthat he wanted to show the blade.\n\n\n\n--- Herb Lison &lt;HerbLison@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; A samurai could unsheath his sword for a number of\n&gt; non-violent reasons,\n&gt; the most common of which were to allow others to\n&gt; appreciate the blade,\n&gt; and the regular cleaning which was mandatory in\n&gt; Japan&#39;s notoriously damp\n&gt; climate to prevent rust.\n&gt; \n&gt; Examination of the blade was supposedly performed\n&gt; according to strict\n&gt; rules of etiquette whereby the blade was withdrawn\n&gt; from the scabbard\n&gt; by degrees. The procedure is described in more\n&gt; detail in Nitobe&#39;s famous\n&gt; work, &quot;Bushido.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cleaning the blade required complete removal from\n&gt; the scabbard, followed\n&gt; by application of a light powder (uchigo), which was\n&gt; then cleaned away \n&gt; with a soft\n&gt; rice paper, or sometimes with silk. Finally a very\n&gt; fine coat of oil of \n&gt; cloves\n&gt; (choji abura) would be applied to the steel with a\n&gt; clean cloth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Toramitsu wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Traditionally a Samurai would only &quot;Break the Seal&quot;\n&gt; if he intended to use the sword. It was the symbol\n&gt; of his soul, not a bragging tool. Besides, the\n&gt; weaponsmiths reputation would speak for itself. At\n&gt; least thats what I&#39;ve come to understand. \n&gt; &gt; j cool &lt;jcool58801@...&gt; wrote:A friend and I\n&gt; got into a discusion about when a\n&gt; &gt;samurai would draw his sword.
