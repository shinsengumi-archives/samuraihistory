There&#39;s\nplenty of honor shown by many of those who fight it.\nNot every soldier is honorable, just like not every\nsamurai was honorable. But usually it&#39;s not the\nsoldiers who want to go fight the war. Anyone who\ndoesn&#39;t believe that, I&#39;ll take a poll of my friends\nand colleagues, and get back to you--I&#39;ll ask how many\nof them in Iraq and Afghanistan right now are enjoying\nthemselves, how many wanted to go and be separated\nfrom their families, etc. I doubt I&#39;ll get many\npositive responses. \n\nNate Ledbetter\nCPT, US Army\n\n\nNate,\n\nI would totally agree with this, soldiers/service personnel rarely start a\nwar, but bear the brunt of the outcome.\n\nAs Samurai spent a considerable part of their time doing things other than\nactual war, I would suggest they, like all soliders through time, accepted\ntheir duty with good grace and loyalty to their Lord/Commander, when asked\nto serve in combat.\n\nI am currently reading Karl Fridays new/recent book, Samurai, Warfare and\nthe State in Early Medieval Japan, and there he discusses how Samurai were\nmore interested in progressing up the Court polictical ladder of power and\nviewed service in war as a means to an end..\n\nWhilst I am only into the second chapter, based on what I have read so far,\nI would recommend it and am looking forward to finishing it off, along side\nthe various other titles I have to read.\n\nKind regards\n\nRob\n\n\nRob Broom\nWarhammer Historical General Manager\nrobb@...\nwww.warhammer-historical.com\n\n\n"
