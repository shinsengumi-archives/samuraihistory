Though the parties of each agenda are separate as to their intentions, they nonetheless seem to operate side by side. Sometimes it seems as if the missionaries are leading the way, and the imperialists are riding along in hopes of using the mission religion as a foothold for their economic plans. And sometimes it seems the other way around, like the Imperialists are leading the way and the missionaries are riding along to use the new colonization as an attempt to gain a foothold for religious purposes. Don&#39;t make the mistake of blending the two together, though. Missionaries and Merchants/Ambassadors are often like siamese twins that can&#39;t stand eachother. Always in the same place, but for totally different reasons, often despising the goals of the other. The Jesuits in Japan were there for love of the people. But they were accompanied by others who were there for the love of money.\n&gt; Religions have historically been used to control and manipulate the masses.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you look at religious conflict, there is almost always a political reason \n&gt; behind the influx of a new religion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please note that this is not an attack on the validity of anyone&#39;s religion. \n&gt; Rather, I&#39;m just pointing out that there are always people an organizations who \n&gt; eagerly manipulate people&#39;s beliefs for their own profit.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Thom \n&gt; &gt; Hey.\n&gt; &gt;         It&#39;s not necessarily a need, per se, unless you look at it that the \n&gt; &gt; missionaries were simply doing what their faith/religion commanded them to do \n&gt; &gt; in spreading their message &quot;to the ends of the earth&quot;.  From the Japanese \n&gt; &gt; standpoint, it certainly wasn&#39;t necessary.  8-)!
