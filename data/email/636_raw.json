I live in\n&gt; Dallas, Texas and work for The Crow Collection of Asian Art.  We are having\n&gt; an Armor exhibition opening on March 21st.\n&gt; I work in the Education Department for the museum.  As a result I am helping\n&gt; to develop a lesson plan for teachers and students and also putting together\n&gt; background information for the tour guides.  I do have some information, but\n&gt; am very interested in learning more.  One of the perks of my job is getting\n&gt; to see some of the exhibits before they go on display.  I am blown away by\n&gt; the armor and masks. This stuff is sooo amazing and cool.  I can&#39;t wait to\n&gt; see the public&#39;s reaction.  The reason I am writing this is to hopefully get\n&gt; information from those with more knowledge on this subject matter.  In\n&gt; addition to the Samurai Archives on the web, I was wondering if anyone might\n&gt; have suggestions for more information (i.e. websites, books, movies, etc).\n&gt; I am also looking for pertinent information that might be especially\n&gt; interesting to children.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks so much!  I look forward to being a part of this group!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Warm regards,\n&gt; Zehra Ahmad\n&gt; Outreach Coordinator\n&gt; The Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection Of Asian Art\n&gt;\n\nYou can start by taking a look at my website:\n\nhttp://www.sengokudaimyo.com/katchu/0.Home.html\n\nIf there&#39;s anything I can do to help, let me know.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
