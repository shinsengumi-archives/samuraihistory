You were makeing an example of your\nbeliefs and how another set of beliefs affected you.\nNot many can look outside themselves and find truth in\nother sources. Truth being in my opinion what we\nperceive it to be. I myself am a recovering Catholic.\nGave it up for lent(private joke). \n\nAnother christian samurai that I came across it Omura\nSumitada. Check him out! Also any info on Francis\nXzavier will help in your quest for info. I myself am\nresearching the Shimazu clan and the samurai of\nSatsuma province(southern Kyushu). \n\nFor more insight into the mind of Kyushu samurai read\n&quot;Hagakure&quot; written by Yamamoto Tsunetomo. He wasn&#39;t a\nchristian but he is a Kyushu samurai. Tsunetomo was a\nretainer of the Nabeshima Clan of Hizen Province. They\ntook over the Ryuzoji clan when the Ryuzoji met defeat\nat the hands of the Shimazu Clan in 1584.\n\nThe Iriki-in documents may also be a help to. They\nwere a noted retainer family of the Shimazu clan and\ntheir documents are very extensive.\n\ngood luck Carmen!!\n\nJake\n--- Carmen Campo &lt;carmen_campo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear Dave, Tom, Karsten, Tim, Jake, Luis, Edy, Thom,\n&gt; Nate et al ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Many many thanks for all of your posts. \n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly, to the others who are offended because I\n&gt; brought up this\n&gt; subject, I am very sorry I did not mean to preach to\n&gt; you, convert you \n&gt; or convince you into my beliefs. No person can do\n&gt; that. Again, I am \n&gt; very sorry. \n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, to those who were eager to help me with\n&gt; such beautiful\n&gt; material (eg top 10 misconceptions, Christian\n&gt; samurais) I am extremely\n&gt; grateful.  Thank you so much! I&#39;m learning a lot\n&gt; from you guys. I will\n&gt; check out the sites and the info you&#39;ve given me and\n&gt; will hope to share\n&gt; what I think of them in the  near future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thirdly, I was able to get hold of a copy of the\n&gt; book &quot;A Higher Honor&quot; by\n&gt; Robert Boardman. I&#39;ve just read through the preface\n&gt; and it looks like a highly\n&gt; enjoyable read! The author used to fight against the\n&gt; Japanese army until\n&gt; he was sent back to the land of the rising sun in a\n&gt; different capacity and he\n&gt; wrote about the honor and commtiment of the people\n&gt; who used to be his enemy \n&gt; but whom he has now come to love.\n&gt; \n&gt; Domo arigato!\n&gt; \n&gt; Carmen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ===========================================\n&gt; Yeah,christians could learn a lot from Bushido.They\n&gt; could be braver.....Edy\n&gt; \n&gt; ====================================\n&gt; Hi Carmen.\n&gt; \n&gt;  If you&#39;re new to this subject (as I also am) I\n&gt; would sugest &quot;The top 10\n&gt;  misconceptions of the samurai&quot; -\n&gt;  http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\n&gt; \n&gt;  That certainly cleared some things up, like the\n&gt; bushido code for\n&gt;  example.   ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Luis\n&gt; ======================================\n&gt; Brave men and cowards alike, exist in all religions.\n&gt; Many samurai and followers of bushido \n&gt; were christians, some of which died very bravely for\n&gt; their religion........\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt; \n&gt; ======================================\n&gt; Carmen et al-\n&gt; \tIf christians have lots to learn from Samurai, then\n&gt; I would suggest \n&gt; they could learn it ALL from Christian Samurai. I\n&gt; would examine the \n&gt; history of christianity in Kyushu and the lives of\n&gt; the Christian \n&gt; Daimyo, sounds like a natural subject for your\n&gt; interests...\n&gt; -t\n&gt; =====================================\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Carmen,\n&gt; please keep in mind that bushido was only what\n&gt; people made out of it. First\n&gt; of all its a rather hollow shell and it depends on\n&gt; what you do with it.\n&gt; Otherwise it�s just an ideal that some reached and\n&gt; some didn�t.\n&gt; Remember also all the bad things that happened when\n&gt; certain people called on\n&gt; the bushido &gt; WWII is only one example...\n&gt; \n&gt; Karsten Helmholz\n&gt; Germany\n&gt; \n&gt; =======================================\n&gt; Hey.\n&gt;        I was thinking about this as I read some of\n&gt; the posts on this topic.  \n&gt; It seems that there are at least one or two very\n&gt; large similarities between \n&gt; Christianity (which I am by no means an expert on)\n&gt; and Bushido (99.9999% of my \n&gt; knowledge of which came from this list).  Both call\n&gt; for unquestioned service to \n&gt; a (L)ord and both have followers very willingly\n&gt; giving their lives for that \n&gt; (L)ord if and when the need arises.  It&#39;s just a\n&gt; matter of the direction.  \n&gt; Bushido, the lord is a human one.  Christianity, a\n&gt; spiritual One.  I do agree that \n&gt; many (most?!) Christians could learn to be braver\n&gt; through studying Bushido, \n&gt; though, myself included.  That Christian samurai\n&gt; were willing to give their \n&gt; lives for either (or both) of their (L)ords is\n&gt; testament to how devoted they were \n&gt; to their religion and to their code, and there&#39;s\n&gt; nothing wrong with that.\n&gt;        Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; L8r.\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; =======================================\n&gt; Hey Carmen,\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are some prominant Christian Samurai that I\n&gt; know\n&gt; of:\n&gt; Otomo Sorin\n&gt; Kuroda Yoshitaka\n&gt; Arima Harunobu\n&gt; \n&gt; Also check out the Shimabara Rebelion 1637-1638\n&gt; \n&gt; Also though there may have been Christain Samurai,\n&gt; Christianity was viewed as a potential\n&gt; threat(foreign\n&gt; powers namely the Portuguese) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi\n&gt; and the Tokugawa Shogunate. Their crack down on\n&gt; christianity wasn&#39;t so much hatred toward christains\n&gt; as much as eliminating a disruptive force. The\n&gt; samurai(Oda Nobunaga) also cracked down on the\n&gt; Buddist\n&gt; Ikko Sect for the same reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jake\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
