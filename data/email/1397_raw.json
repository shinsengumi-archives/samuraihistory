I don&#39;t remember where I got that from, \nbut did I misread &quot;Aburagawa&quot; as &quot;Yugawa&quot; or was &quot;Yugawa&quot; his \ngrandfather&#39;s correct last name?\n\nAlso, I have the mothers for all of Shingen&#39;s children now except for \nTakeda (Kadoyama) Yoshihisa and the daughter that married Uesugi \nKagekatsu (I don&#39;t have her actual name either - my sources all \nsay &quot;Onna&quot;) - anyone have thier mother(s)?.\n\nAs for Oda Nobutaka&#39;s mother, Saka-shi - does the -shi just denote \nthat she is from the Saka clan, or does the -shi have another meaning?\n\nThanks for the help.  I&#39;m up to 98 related samurai so far (Takeda \nShingen is the &#39;source person&#39; for the extended family tree - I&#39;m \nusing genealogy software, it makes it a lot easier to keep track of).\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shinsei &lt;sinseism@y...&gt;&quot; \n&lt;sinseism@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello\n&gt; Kitsuno(Ikoma-no-kata) was the mother of Nobutada ,Nobuo(Nobukatsu) \n&gt; and Toku-hime(Gotoku).\n&gt; Nobutaka&#39;s mother was Saka-shi whose familly rank was relatively \nlow \n&gt; and his birth was reported late,so Nobutaka,actually the 2nd \nson,was \n&gt; treated as the 3rd son.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sanjo was the mother of Yoshinobu,Nobuchika,Nobuyuki.\n&gt; Katsuyori&#39;s mother was Suwa-Goryonin(Koi-hime)whose father,Suwa \n&gt; yorishige had been killed by Shingen.\n&gt; Morinobu(Nishina)&#39;s mother was Aburagawa-bunin.\n&gt; \n&gt; hope this helps\n&gt; \n&gt; Shinsei\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kitsuno &lt;cewest@s...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;cewest@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to put together an extended genealogy of the Sengoku \n&gt; &gt; Daimyo - - most seem to have been related by marriage or \noffspring, \n&gt; &gt; including the Toyotomi, Takeda, Hojo, Oda, etc.  Right now I&#39;m \n&gt; trying \n&gt; &gt; to figure out two things - which of Takeda Shingen&#39;s children \nwere \n&gt; &gt; born from Lady Sanjo, and which of Oda Nobunaga&#39;s children were \n&gt; born \n&gt; &gt; from Kitsuno.  Also trying to figure out who Kitsuno&#39;s father is -\n \n&gt; &gt; probable someone obvious that I&#39;ve overlooked.  \n&gt; &gt; Any help is appreciated.\n\n\n"
