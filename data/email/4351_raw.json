My name is Natan Ruiz, I=B4m brazilian student (architecture). Obviously =\r\nin deep interest on japanese ancient culture and samurai tradicion. Iaijuts=\r\nu and Kenjutsu student as well. \n\n    I found this group on Samurai Archive=\r\ns page, and I feel really pleased to join this mailing list, which it seems=\r\n to be an outstanding source of knowledge and communication with people jus=\r\nt like me. Domo Arigat=F4 Gozaimashit=E1! =3D)\n\nAnyway, I invoque the atten=\r\ntion of experts and &quot;sempais&quot; to call some help!!\n\nI=B4m in need of some ma=\r\nterial about the European influence over Japan. And I say I=B4m REALLY in n=\r\need of it, in order to accomplish a project. Portuguese arrivals and the je=\r\nsuits, so as the trade relations with daymios, but specially in care of the=\r\n introduction of Christianism, and the great cultural conflict with buddhis=\r\nm, and japanese manners, IN DETAILS. I=B4ve spent lot of time in reserch, b=\r\nut not very sucessfull. Maybe because it=B4s a very specific subject, I kno=\r\nw that. I=B4ve had some contact with portuguese authors (Rainer Dahnenhardt=\r\n) and some institutions, but It=B4s pretty hard to find support. Since I jo=\r\nined the group, I=B4m looking all the messages sent here, to see If I find =\r\nsomething. (sorry if i=B4m repeating this subject) Anyway, It would help me=\r\n a lot if anyone could point me author, books, sites, or even better, spend=\r\n some time writing about it for me! hehehehe\n\nPlease mail me (rnascimento@t=\r\nriang.com.br) \nAnd once again, thank you for accepting me! I hope to be hel=\r\npfull around here!\n\nPS - Sorry about poor english! =3D/\n\nNatan Ruiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[=\r\nNon-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
