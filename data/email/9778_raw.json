Shingen and Kenshin&#39;s Five Battles\n\nSengoku Daimyo Takeda=\r\n Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin are two well known\nfigures from Japan&#39;s Sengoku=\r\n period who fought five battles on the\nKawanakajima plain in Shinano provin=\r\nce (Modern day Nagano prefecture)\nbetween 1553 and 1564. (The fouth battle =\r\nwas depicted in the 1990\nKadokawa Haruki movie Heaven and Earth) Why did Ka=\r\nwanakajima become\nthe main battleground for these two warriors? What made K=\r\nawanakajima\nsuch a contested area? I thought I&#39;d tackle this question for m=\r\ny blog\npost this week. After a combination of poking around and deductive\nr=\r\neasoning, I can come up with a few reasons. Although, there is no way\nto re=\r\nally know which reasons might be correct, a little theoretical\nguesswork ne=\r\nver hurt anyone.\n\nThe rest here:\nhttp://shogun-yashiki.blogspot.com/2008/09=\r\n/why-kawanakajima-shingen-and-kenshins.html\n\n\n"
