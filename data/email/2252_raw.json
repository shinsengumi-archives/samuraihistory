However, I would recommend a recently pub=\r\nlished book to give you an overall feel and vision of the times: &quot;Samurai, =\r\nan illustrated history&quot; by Mitsuo Kure, 2001; published by  Tuttle - plenty=\r\n of full coloured photos of re-enactors, banners and battle plans.  And I s=\r\nuppose reading a few novels of the time would provide some faction base - C=\r\nlavell&#39;s &quot;SHOGUN&quot; must be regarded as essential..\n\nGood luck with the writi=\r\nng....\n                                                    Rod Johnson\n\nAs =\r\nan aside I used to enjoy the old western movies - I knew they were mostly f=\r\nactually incorrect - but it was entertainment!! So it is not unexpected tha=\r\nt I look forward to &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; [and I will probably buy the video (=\r\nor DVD) when it comes out]. I didn&#39;t look for wrist watches, telegraph pole=\r\ns and jet trails in the sky on &quot;Waterloo&quot;, so I enjoyed it....  Treat &quot;The =\r\nLast Samurai&quot; as entertainment, we couldn&#39;t look to Shakespear for history =\r\nlessons! And it may even give another generation interest in &quot;our&quot; subject =\r\nas the novel SHOGUN did........\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have b=\r\neen removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
