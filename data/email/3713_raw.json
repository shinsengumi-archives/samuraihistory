So here goes.\n\nWhile the concept of Japanese re-militarization may be &quot;laughable&quot; today -- \nthough I disagree -- the case today is not the same as it was in 1970.  The \n30+ intervening years have done much to shape the thoughts of the Japanese \n(nation and people) as well as the opinions of those looking in from \nwithout.  \n\nI contend that the problem sending troops is a political one.  Koizumi, \nlike most politicians, doesn&#39;t want to do anything unpopular with the \npeople and so that is why it took them so long to get off their hands.  \nThat this is not the only outlook in Japan is evidenced by the popularity \nof Mayor Ishihara.  He has been advocating getting rid of the \nnon-aggression clause in the constituition (article 9 is it?) for some \ntime, and yet remains wildly popular.  Anyway we should note that Mishima \nwas not really looking for militarism, but a return to Japan&#39;s past, what \nhe felt made Japan uniquely Japanese.  And that, more than militarism, was \na return to reverence for the emperor and that (military) service should be \nin those terms, rather than in more secular ones.\n\n-Shannon\n&quot;I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle...&quot;\n\n\nFrom: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n\n--- &quot;Anthony J.

Come on...the Japanese\nfind it hard enough to deploy an engineer battalion to\nIraq to build roads...I&#39;ve gotten junkmail from the\nCommunist Party with their platform on why they\nshouldn&#39;t send troops.
