I&#39;ve been accused of being the\nneighborhood bully once or twice. You&#39;ve got to be\ntough in this business--many people on this email list\nare serious historians, published authors, people who\nread Japanese history in the original Japanese--not\nthe anime Shibuya-speak, mind you, but good old\nfashioned 12th century stuff. These people don&#39;t\nconsider gaming questions worthy of their bandwidth.\nThere have been heated issues when gaming types come\non here and think they know everything about samurai\nsimply because they beat the 17th level of &quot;Samurai\nShowdown&quot; or &quot;Tenchu&quot; or they watched Rurouni Kenshin\n(&quot;Samurai X&quot;) 25 times. If you want to learn about\nsamurai, start at the website www.samuraiarchives.com\nand find the &quot;Top 10 misconceptions of the samurai&quot;.\nWhen people come here asking gaming or anime\nquestions, often the assumption is that they are\ndeluded by one or two or all 10 of those. Things can\nget painful. \n\nGrow a thick skin, and be willing to learn, and this\nis a nice place. If that bothers you, then I dare you\nto say something like &quot;Anthony Bryant couldn&#39;t tell a\nsugake odoshi from a obon odori&quot; and see what happens.\n\n\n*note to everyone on the board--why am I continuing to\nfill your in box? Because if I answered his emails\nsingly instead of on the list, all the others who\nanswered/asked the question wouldn&#39;t get the benefit.\nSorry, and thanks for the patience.\n\nThe just-demoted assistant management (guess I&#39;ll go\nclean out the bathrooms now...)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
