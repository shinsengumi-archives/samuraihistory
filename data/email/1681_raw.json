I recall a map of that time was\nalso in the article.  I do have the particular issue in my archives but it would\ntake me some time to find it!!  You may be rewarded by searching the National\nGeographic site for HAGI and also YOSHIDA SHOIN, who features prominently in the\narticle if I remember correctly.  Also MORI as the Mori castle was pictured - or\nrather, its ruined foundations after it was burnt on the Daimyo&#39;s orders after\nthe Meiji Restoration.\n\nFinally, if reference cannot be found please get back to me - offlist or\nonlist - and I&#39;ll search for the issue.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;ragboy@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 24, 2003 3:27 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Nagato 1550\n\n\nGreetings,\n\nI&#39;m working on a project concerning the Ouchi-Mori conflict starting about\n1550, a year before Ouchi Yoshitaka was deposed by Sue Harukata. I&#39;m\nreally interested in some pretty specific information, any references\nwould be much appreciated:\n\nThe town of Hagi: Anyone know of a good resource on this town before the\nMori clan took over the area?\n\n\n"
