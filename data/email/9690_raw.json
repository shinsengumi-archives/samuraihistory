Samur=\r\nai record-keeping appears to be quite \nmeticulous, and there appears to be =\r\na lot of information, albeit I \ncan&#39;t seem to find it in &quot;summary&quot; form, or=\r\n in a fashion that \ndoesn&#39;t require a lot of filtering... and a lot of work=\r\n...\n\nI think my &quot;turbulence&quot; statement was a relative one.\n\nThanks,\n\nShaun\n=\r\n\nP.S.  As recommended, I purchased the books by G.B. Sansom.  I&#39;m \nalso con=\r\nsidering purchasing the History of Japan volumes by James \nMurdoch.  Have y=\r\nou read these?  Are they any good?\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-\nlistowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;shaundlcurry&quot;\n&gt; &lt;Shaun.Curry@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Kitsuno,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your reply.  I can&#39;t believe how phenomenally \n&gt; &gt; dif=\r\nficult it is to piece together all this information...  \nClearly, \n&gt; &gt; reco=\r\nrd-keeping was not a priority for Samurai or Peasants during \nthe \n&gt; &gt; turb=\r\nulent 1620&#39;s...  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you recommend any well-organized books, peri=\r\nodicals, and/or \n&gt; &gt; websites that provides comprehensive lists of Daimyos =\r\nper \nregions?  \n&gt; &gt; i.e. I am looking for a list Daimyos on Kyushu only.  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Record-keeping has always been an obsession throughout Japanese\n&gt; hist=\r\nory. Every clan has detailed genealogies and detailed clan\n&gt; histories. If =\r\nyou can&#39;t read Japanese, you are more limited, but \nI&#39;d\n&gt; just be creative =\r\n- I would first find a map something like this \none:\n&gt; http://www.samurai-a=\r\nrchives.com/maphome.html\n&gt; Then I would write down the names of all of the =\r\ndaimyo I see on\n&gt; Kyushu, and then I would get various library books that d=\r\neal with\n&gt; Japanese history, flip to the index, and try to find out who was=\r\n in\n&gt; charge of the clan during the 1620s - off the top of my head, \nGeorge=\r\n\n&gt; Sansom&#39;s 2nd and/or 3rd book (History of Japan) would be one place \nto\n&gt;=\r\n look. It&#39;s pretty basic research. If you read Japanese, the \nJapanese\n&gt; wi=\r\nkipedia and harimaya.com has detailed family trees for almost \nevery\n&gt; majo=\r\nr clan, and the Sengoku Jinmei Jiten edited by Abe would be\n&gt; another resou=\r\nrce. I&#39;d help out, but I don&#39;t have the time. Maybe\n&gt; someone else around h=\r\nere?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I&#39;m curious - what &quot;turbulence&quot; are you talking about durin=\r\ng \nthe\n&gt; 1620s? I can&#39;t think of much of anything overly turbulent \nhappeni=\r\nng in\n&gt; the 1620s aside from the non-event of Iemitsu becoming shogun, and =\r\n\nthe\n&gt; start of Sakoku.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
