This is not the case, \neither in the past or now. \n\n&gt;It is not in videogames or in manga, and anime... \n\nYes, it is. Obviously. That&#39;s where the whole conversation got \nstarted. Plus it is seen in at least one &quot;cult movie&quot; as you have \ntaught me (see below).\n\n&gt;Some parents still tell nobunaga tales to scare ill behaved children at \n&gt;Japan, and he is an very used character in some occult movies such as \n&gt;Kujaku-Ou! \n\nNo. Of course I can&#39;t deny that some parents somewhere \nmight &quot;tell nobunaga stories&quot;. But if they do I&#39;ve never heard \nof it. It is certainly not a common practice.\n\nI&#39;ve never heard of Kujaku-Ou. Anyway if the &quot;Nobuanga as villain&quot; \ntheme is used in this movies and others like it, it exactly fits my \npoint -- these are examples of this theme being used in very light \nentertainment or pop culture.\n\n&gt;And HEROIC is the tales about those brave ninjas who exterminated the \n&gt;bastard! \nThis is a different use of the word heroic that is outside of the \nscope of the current conversation.\n\n&gt;Nobunaga had the vicious addiction to do genocide against buddhist temples \n&gt;and against vilages near those temples, and killed and maimed many just \n&gt;because they dwelt near those temples, until he decided to mess with the \n&gt;vilages inside the Iiga mountain... *a very big grim*... \n\nThis paragraph again exactly illustrates my point. This is a western, \nmodern way of viewing what Nobunaga did.\n\n&gt;The rest of the history\nIndeed.\n\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
