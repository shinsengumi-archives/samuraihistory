Hiei was far too extreme solution, but is also neccesary mention that the Ikko-Ikki was a great obstacle between any daimyo and an effective shogunate. If Nobunaga had&#39;nt destroyed the Ikko-Ikki, another daimyo would, we also could go as far as wonder: what if Nobunaga were killed trying to destroy them?, would hideyoshi become the next power on the land?\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!
