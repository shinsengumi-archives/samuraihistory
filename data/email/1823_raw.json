N=\r\never really botherd with dates. \n\nI just so happen to live in Sweden, the s=\r\nouthern part of Sweden. History\nis my favourite hobby, and I really cant re=\r\ncall any autrocities done by\nthe catholic curch to us. In teh begining when=\r\n some monks came to our\ncountry (were talking 600-800AD) we killed the anoy=\r\ning ones direktly,\nand left the harmless ones to to what ever they wanted, =\r\nas long as they\ndidnt piss us off. Not untill the 1300AD I think (Not sure =\r\non exact\ndates, may be later may be sooner) A swedish king said I&#39;m gonna b=\r\ne\nbaptised, and everybody who has a porblem with it, chop! chop! One head\ns=\r\nhorter. I.E. your king is catholic, now the rest of sweden is catholic.\nThi=\r\ns held up for a time, and we had the usual witchhunts and stuff, but\nnoting=\r\n to out of place in Europe during 1400-1600. Then a jolly good&#39;ol\nchap name=\r\nd Gustav Wasa, decided to change from catholic to protestant,\nand the chato=\r\nlic got thrown out. tyhis was maily done outof economic\nreasons. The cathol=\r\nic curch is sinfully rich, but the protestants favour\npoverty, ie more taxe=\r\ns to the King. yay! If i remember correctly this is\nsome where during the b=\r\negining of 1500. And since then we have had wars\nwith polen, Turkey, Russia=\r\n, Norway, Denmark, Finland, And a few others\nthat just so happend to be on =\r\nthe way to Polen and Turkey. I have no\nrecoolection what so ever of autroci=\r\nties of the scale of the spanish and\nportugal in South america, or the engl=\r\nish men in China, or the french\nand Dutch in Africa. Who, in the name of th=\r\ne pop enslaved ppl for the\nsake of christianity.\n\nNope, we are friendly, pe=\r\nacefull people in Sweden, and as such we have\nbeen treated nicely by the Fa=\r\nther.\n\n Well thats what I remember from my history lessons in my 12 year ca=\r\nrer\nof grammar school, junior high and highschool. \n\nNow what was the autri=\r\ncities you were talking about?\nApart from the usual witchhunts and heretic =\r\nslaying, of the dark ages?\n\n/// Chris D.
