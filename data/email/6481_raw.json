(The eleventh one came \nlater, after by some strange coincidence about 3 or 4 people on the \nforum starting saying how &#39;samurai loved and served the emperor with \ntheir life, every single one&#39;. And they&#39;ve kept coming.) As for my \nsources, basically just common real knowledge on the samurai.
