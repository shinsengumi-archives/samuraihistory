This\n&gt; was\n&gt; what I meant by being &#39;Indepedent&#39;. The use of\n&gt; suprise, mass, and etc would be some of options\n&gt; available to a field commander. \n\nI agree completely\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As for me, I am not a trained military historian. I\n&gt; have background in political science, statistics,\n&gt; and\n&gt; mathematics. I liked reading a lot of books on\n&gt; ancient\n&gt; Chinese stategies and military history (both eastern\n&gt; and western). Now, I am working on a Ph.D. in\n&gt; mathematics. I intend to work on something\n&gt; interdisciplinary in the future. Anyway, it was good\n&gt; to hear from you. \n\nGood Luck to you! \n\n&gt; \n&gt; ps. My father was also a Lietenant Colonel in the\n&gt; South Korea Army. So, I have very friendly sentiment\n&gt; toward the military figures.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ve always been impressed with the ROK Army.\nExpecially after being stationed in Korea, near\nMunsan, myself. All I&#39;ve seen from the South Korean\nArmy, and I&#39;m sure your father was the same, has been\noutstanding!!!\n\nNathan Ledbetter\nCPT, US Army\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
