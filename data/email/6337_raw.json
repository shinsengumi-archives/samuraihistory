Samurai Asukai Shiro spends the \nlast night before the battle with his lover Yoshiko. He promises \nher, no matter what, he will allow &quot;nothing in heaven or on earth to \ncome between us&quot;. The next day, Tokudaiji and his men fight to their \ndeaths. Asukai survives when he&#39;s buried in rubble from the castle. \nHe learns that Hsiao kidnapped Lady Yoshiko. Before he can join his \nlord and comrades in death, he must fulfill the vow he made to his \nlove.\n\nThis looks and feels like a CrossGen comic. Not only does Marz \nwrite `Samurai&#39; in a style similar to CrossGen&#39;s `Scion&#39;, but \ncolorist Jason Keith was also `Scion&#39;s colorist. Add to that Luke \nRoss&#39; art looking almost exactly like Greg Land&#39;s (who provides the \ncover), and I&#39;d swear this was an unpublished CrossGen comic.\n\n`Samurai: Heaven and Earth&#39; has a samurai that puts his love ahead \nof his honor. I&#39;ve often seen samurai portrayed as intense warriors \nwho value their code of honor more than anyone&#39;s life, including \ntheir own. It&#39;s refreshing to see a samurai portrayed as a lover \ninstead of a fighter. It&#39;s his love for Yoshiko that drives Asukai \nto fight, rather than loyalty to his lord and country. \n\nAccording to the text piece at the end of the issue, Asukai&#39;s quest \nfor Yoshiko takes him through Europe. Why is a Japanese samurai \nsearching for a Chinese warlord in Europe? I don&#39;t know. That should \nbe revealed in future issues. And since there&#39;s no sign of this trip \nin this issue, nor does any character appear in Europe, I give this \nbook 4 bullets instead of 5. I think that&#39;s an important element of \nthe story and should have been included in the opening chapter.\n\nAs it stands, this is a fine comic. It&#39;s well worth your money and \nyour time. And I&#39;m not just saying that because Ron Marz sent it to \nme for free. If you like samurai stories, quests for lost loves, or \npenciled art from Brazilians, you&#39;ll like this book. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
