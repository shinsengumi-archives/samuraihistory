A few may go,\n&gt; God help them, \n&gt; because they liked Tom Cruise&#39;s tired exercise in\n&gt; emotional \n&gt; manipulation, The Last Samurai. These people do not\n&gt; know what they&#39;re \n&gt; in for.\n&gt; \n&gt; They&#39;ll get their swooshing swords and their copious\n&gt; blood. But \n&gt; they&#39;ll be scratching their heads at Zatoichi&#39;s\n&gt; sudden bursts of \n&gt; slapstick humor, or when the entire cast partakes in\n&gt; a thunderous tap \n&gt; dance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could be that only those folks going to see a film\n&gt; by the awesome \n&gt; Japanese talent &quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi Kitano will be\n&gt; content with this new \n&gt; version of the famous Japanese hero. Kitano\n&gt; audaciously takes on the \n&gt; celluloid persona of the blind, justice-seeking\n&gt; swordsman created in \n&gt; the 1960s and played for decades by Shintaro Katsu.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zatoichi&#39;s story is taken from the very first Katsu\n&gt; film in the \n&gt; 1960s, about warring factions in a small town. The\n&gt; blind swordsman \n&gt; (played by Kitano) comes to town as a humble masseur\n&gt; and gambler, \n&gt; biding his time with the dice-playing nephew of the\n&gt; woman who takes \n&gt; him in. Soon, he&#39;s in the middle of a gang war.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Kitano&#39;s samurai universe we&#39;re given wonderfully\n&gt; flawed and \n&gt; dimensional characters. The film is populated with\n&gt; bums and \n&gt; prostitutes, guys who hurt themselves because they\n&gt; don&#39;t know how to \n&gt; hold a sword, put-upon working-class folks, and an\n&gt; idiot or two.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kitano has the odd ability to appeal to both the\n&gt; art-film lover and \n&gt; the action-film fan (though not all of his films are\n&gt; gangster \n&gt; flicks). He allows bullets to fly and blood to spurt\n&gt; in the midst of \n&gt; silly humor, solid storytelling and stunningly\n&gt; beautiful visuals. \n&gt; Like blind Zatoichi&#39;s sword sheathed in a rickety\n&gt; old cane, Kitano \n&gt; shows us the extraordinary hidden within the\n&gt; ordinary. His Zatoichi \n&gt; is no ordinary samurai story. \n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/custom/showtime/sfl-\n&gt;\nshzatoiaug20,0,251117.story?coll=sfla-features-showtime\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!
