As for\ntheir being a single actual last samurai, no. All samurai alive at the\ntime became the last samurai as soon as the Meiji government did away\nwith the samurai caste.\n \n-AngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
