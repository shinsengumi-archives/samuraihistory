Perhaps I phrased my question in a way that is too simplistic. \nSome time ago I attended a tea ceremony with a Japanese master of this art. \nMy family was honored by recieving the first taste of the tea. The man who \nperformed the tea ceremony explained that the art of tea was often taken up by \nsamurai as they grew older and took up the pursuits of maturity. For this reason \nI thought that the stages of a samurai&#39;s life might be named in some way, and \nthat there might be a partiular label given to the samrai as he matured.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
