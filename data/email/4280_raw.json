Japanese infantrymen wore a dark blue \nkepi, a short jacket=\r\n with French style field pack, and dark blue \npants. The cavalry wore red k=\r\nepis with a small white plume in the \nfront, dark blue jackets, red pants w=\r\nith a yellow stripe, and black \nboots.

I&#39;d like to build this army to fight against my \nexisting s=\r\namurai army. It would be an interesting game.\n\n\n\n\n"
