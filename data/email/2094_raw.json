Historically they seem to be bitter enemies -but is that accurate? ---\nAlso-suggest any Dirty Pair sites?\n\nkeiman0 &lt;KeimanZero@...&gt; wrote: \nKonnichiWa to all-We were wondering about the real historical facts \nof the oniwabanshuu in Japanese history.

Any help will be appreciated and reciprocated. \nKei and I are somewhat of an expert on anime in general and Lovely \nAngels/Dirty Pair in particular as well as romanji script in Japanese \nand its English translations.
