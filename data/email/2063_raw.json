A geisha deals with sexiness, as \nopposed to sex. A geisha will flirt, tease, and joke with men, but \nalways artfully, with finesse. A geisha will make herself a living \nwork of art, and the goal they work for is one that can never be \nreached; perfection in their chosen skill, whether of music, dance, \nor singing. A geisha attempts to make her life art, and polish her \ncharacter until she shines with it. She sells ideas, dreams, and \nfantasies. She will hint at her sexuality, but never flaunt it.\n\nThis is a large part of the ideal that geisha aspire to, a style \ncalled &quot;Iki&quot;. Iki is a subtle elegance that intrigues, an alluring \nstyle that reflects a whole philosophy of life, not mere \nsubmissiveness as of a prostitute. The translation and explanation \nof the many Japanese words for &quot;prostitute&quot; and geisha, were all \nexplained as &quot;courtesans&quot;, Which resulted in obvious confusion.\n\nA courtesan or concubine are in essence a prostitute, which also \nexisted along side the geishas. And even though a geisha might \nplease a man sexually on occasion, generally you had to see a \nconcubine for that service.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matthew E.
