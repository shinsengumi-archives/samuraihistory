My initial thought was that it must be in \n1868, during the Mejii restoration.\n\nBut upon further reflection, it might have been during the 1877 Satsuma \nRebellion.  That was the last samurai rebellion.  Basically, you had samurai \non one side and Imperial troops on the other.  However, the Tokyo policemen \nwere brought in to fight with the Imperials and they were all samurai (or \nformer samurai).\n\nSo it gets tricky depending on your definition of samurai.\n\nPerhaps someone else can shed more light on the subject for you.\n\nBob Burke\n\n\nIn a message dated 4/13/03 11:05:10 AM, cathy@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; Hello to anyone that might be able to help me!?\n\nMy son is set a question every week and this weeks is..&quot;When was the \n\nlast samurai against samurai battle and what was it called?\n\nMuch appreciated with any help I can get.\n\nCathy. &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"
