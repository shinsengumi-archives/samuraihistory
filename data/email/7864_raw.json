From what I can see, you were questioning the\nusefulness of citing two films, AFTER THE RAIN and SEPPUKU as possible\nhistorical sources for dealing with the lives and conditions of Edo-period\nronin and also the Edo period ethic of &quot;the sword is the soul of the\nsamurai.&quot;\n\nFor your information: I cannot read in Japanese so my written sources are in\nEnglish or in English translation. \n\nUsing fiction and film as historical sources: You are correct in that they\nare films and not the same as historical documents. But many times\nhistorical documents from the time period do not exist. As for the two films\nI cited, they concern the life of Edo-period ronin. There are hardly any\nhistorical sources that outline the lives of Edo period ronin. So therefore,\nhistorians have usually had to read what little is available and draw\nconclusions from little bits of information that they have found, here and\nthere. \n\nOne historical source I did find was in SOURCES OF JAPANESE TRADITION, which\nis a compilation of historical sources in English translation. Included in\nthis book are some writings of Fumazawa Banzin, a ronin and scholar who\nlived in the 17th century. He wrote about the conditions of people during\nthe Edo period and particularly discussed the conditions for the ronin, many\nwhom he said were starving to death. There are loads of other historical\ndocuments in this book on various topics. \n\nAnother source of historical writings is LEGENDS OF THE SAMURAI compiled by\nHiroaki Sato. He compiled English translations of many original documents,\nincluding the 18th century scholarly debates that occurred concerning the 47\nAko ronin and their revenge.   \n\nAs for using films and other historical fiction: You cannot draw definitive\nconclusions from anything seen in a film or a piece of fiction. For the most\npart, films and other fiction aren&#39;t designed to give out definitive\nconclusions about history. What they do is &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; in many cases,\nand they raise issues and possibilities. The films SEPPUKU and AFTER THE\nRAIN are made by Japanese, in Japanese. I have to use sub-titled versions as\nmy understanding of Japanese is quite limited. \n\nSo therefore as an example: in SEPPUKU, the author of the orignal novel, and\nthe director of the film, challenge the concept of &quot;the sword is the soul of\nthe samurai&quot; as a precept that has been frequently empty of any true\nmorality, as a hypocritical &quot;hammer&quot; used by those in positions of privilege\nduring the Edo period, over those who are powerless. In the novel and the\nfilm, there is a depiction of an impoverished 17th century ronin forced by\nthe Ii clan to commit seppuku with his bamboo-blade wakizashi (because he\nhad pawned his real blade, replacing it with bamboo) after he came to their\nmansion begging for money. So this does raise a question: did this sort of\nevent ever actually happen in historical times, or is this event purely from\nthe imagination of the author, echoed by the movie director? On an ethical\nlevel, would this response by the Ii clan, be considered by those living in\nthe time, as an apropriate response? In modern times, would this be\nconsidered an appropriate response? There are no proven answers, just\nspeculations. But they can be valuable to ponder, at least to some.\n\nOr we could dismiss this whole thing, stating that it&#39;s from a novel and a\nfilm, and say that it&#39;s just fiction, unproven. And move on, using only\ndefinitive historical documents in their original language for the study of\nhistory. Which is fine as well. To each their own.\n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of rntihg\nSent: Tuesday, October 18, 2005 4:31 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai? (was RE: [samuraihistory] Re: h\nitokiri kawaka\n\nHello,\n\nI have been absent from the list for at least a year, but have decided to\nsee what&#39;s what here (albeit from a new email address).\n\nI wanted to comment on the premise of Ms. Boal&#39;s questions.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@s...&gt;\nwrote:\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n\n&gt; Back in the earlier thread, we were discussing the qualities of a &quot;good&quot;\n&gt; samurai. Some people, including myself, brought up two films, AFTER\nTHE RAIN\n&gt; and SEPPUKU. I remember discussing one of the characters in SEPPUKU\nwho had\n&gt; pawned his sword blades in order to try and feed his family.\nAccording to\n&gt; some historical accounts I&#39;ve read, this seemed to have happened \n&gt; rather frequently during the Edo period, with impoverished ronin and \n&gt; sometimes low-ranked (low-paid) clan samurai pawning their sword \n&gt; blades, replacing them with bamboo.\n\nTo which historical accounts are you referring?  Written when?  In Japanese\nor English?  For a popular or academic audience?  Peer reviewed (as in\nuniversity and other scholarly presses)?\nAll of these (and many more) are the first questions one normally would ask\nabout sources quoted in support of any statement or hypothesis.  Without\nsome idea of the sources that you are using, a statement such as &#39;some\nhistorical accounts I&#39;ve read&#39; has an indeterminate authority and leaves me\n(and I suspect others) curious as to the accuracy that we can expect from\nthe sources.\n\nThe next thing that I would point out is that these are just movies. \nWhile I like Kurosawa and Tokugawa-set period pieces, I don&#39;t beleive anyone\nwould put much faith in their historical accuracy.  That is not to say that\nthe things that movies depict are necessarily untrue, but simply that they\ncan&#39;t be relied upon as historical documents in the same way that\ncontemporaneous materials can.\n&gt; [snips] \n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
