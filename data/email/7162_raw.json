Here is Hayes&#39;s\nprofile. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371230/\n\nMike\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Randy Schadel&quot;\n&lt;ayamechiba@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &quot; hey,i was just lookin at the shogun page,hahaha coincidentally did \n&gt; you know that\n&gt; mr hayes,was actually an actor in the original movie shogun?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, Hayes CLAIMS he was, anyway. He is uncredited and the detailed \n&gt; list of cast & crew (including stunt personnel) I have gives no mention \n&gt; of him. The only other place I&#39;ve ever seen it mentioned was in an \n&gt; interview with Hayes (of course) in Kick magazine back in the 80&#39;s \n&gt; where among other things he claims to have been living in Japan for \n&gt; years, given the Shogun production crew ninja history and choreography \n&gt; for the ninja attack sequence, and just totally impressed the whole \n&gt; crew with his grasp of Japanese history and martial arts. The part he \n&gt; was supposed to have played was a stuntman part-the crewman that falls \n&gt; off the mast of the Erasmus into the ocean.\n&gt; Perhaps some clever Japanese solution to get rid of the \n&gt; gaijin &#39;expert&#39;...\n\n\n\n\n\n"
