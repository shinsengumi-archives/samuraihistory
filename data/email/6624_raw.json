This is a legit question to any and all scholars out there\nwith access to the right sources.  \n\nI was researching over in the university library and there is a\nnotable lack of english sources concerning japanese tactics on a\nsquad-based level in sengoku and muromachi feudal combat.  One I came\nacross giving brief information on the matter was &quot;Samurai, Warfare\nand the State in Early Medieval Japan (Warfare and History)&quot; by Karl\nF. Friday, his newest book.  It concerns earlier medieval warfare and,\nto be realistic, only revealed minimal on the subject (as there are\nprobably little surviving primary sources to draw from).  \n\nI got the basic impression that, like many other medieval combat\naffairs, an army&#39;s maneovering capabilities were not as impressive as\nmay be assumed.  When, if at all, combat was joined, samurai moved on\na squad level, rather independent and not too unlike their european\nknight-errant counterparts.  It was so, according to Friday, because\nthis small squad would most likely be the same samurai who they\nlocally trained with and thus knew most intimately in terms of\ntactical capabilities.  I was wondering if anyone else has access to\nsources going in-depth on this topic, and if they could briefly\ndescribe their impressions on the subject.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
