For example master Funakoshi who\n&gt; developed the Shotokan style was from a long line of\n&gt; Samurai, he even wore the traditional top not as a\n&gt; sign of his heritage. \n\nI studied Shotokan for a while, and have a tremendous\nrespect for it and Master Funakoshi. And I&#39;m aware of\nhis samurai heritage. However, he didn&#39;t &quot;INVENT&quot;\nKarate. He adapted it from Okinawan open-hand\nfighting. He DEVELOPED it, but didn&#39;t create it. \n\nI belong to the JKAE (japan\n&gt; karate association of england) master Funakoshi set\n&gt; up the JKA the first Karate association in the\n&gt; world. And if you go to www.jka.or.jp it will tell\n&gt; you that true Karate is derived from Bushido, the\n&gt; Dojo Kun and the 20 Precepts all come from Bushido,\n&gt; so I suggest you study more in the art of Karate and\n&gt; it&#39;s history.\n\nOf course it does. It&#39;s going to say it has no ethical\nvalue system, or mode of behavior? Of course not--it&#39;s\ngoing to use the one it can most easily associate\nwith. I&#39;m sure they do their best to incorporate the\nvalues in Bushido that they feel are worthy. Nothing\nwrong with that. However, that doesn&#39;t make karate a\nsamurai art based in bushido anymore than my living in\nShibuya makes me an Edokko.\n\nThis is the difference I talked about when I said\nkarate became and art, and not simply breaking the\nlimbs of an attacker. I hardly think the Okinawan\npeasants who first started putting together techniques\ncared much about bushido--they probably cared a whole\nlot more about other people beating them up and taking\ntheir crops, etc. If you want to focus on history,\nthen take a look at when Master Funakoshi lived--1868\nto 1957. He was born in the same year the Meiji\nRestoration took place, and was a youth when the\nSamurai were abolished. \n\nI suggest YOU study a little bit more about bushido.\nHardly a pervasive ethical value system through much\nof Japanese history. Fine ideals if you care, but much\nof bushido post-dates the beginning of the Tokugawa\nperiod, and was hardly the concern of the\naforementioned Okinawan peasants. \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours do?\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
