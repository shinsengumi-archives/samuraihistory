At th=\r\nat same time 1701 when the 47 ronin did their thing, it\ncaused a real heada=\r\nche for the government as, bushido, was just an\nideal, not something that y=\r\nou should really do! \n\nOkay, my own view is that the various ideas containe=\r\nd in bushido, along\nwith the obsessive reverence for the sword, over and ab=\r\nove all other\nweapons, especially the gun, was nothing more than a socio-po=\r\nlitical\ndevice created by the Tokugawa intended to ensure peace. Which it\na=\r\nctually did, for nigh on 250 years, which isn&#39;t bad, bearing in mind\njust h=\r\now long they had all been kicking the &quot;do do&quot; out of one\nanother:-)\n\nBushid=\r\no crippled the samurai class, turning them from battle winning,\nteam playin=\r\ng &quot;soldiers&quot;, unafraid to embrace new ideas and new\ntechnologies to help th=\r\nem win, to nothing more than an ineffective and\nquarrelsome bunch of indivi=\r\ndual &quot;warrior-administrators&quot;, unable to\nthreaten the Tokugawa hegemony.\n\nI=\r\n mean, look at the attitude to firearms, it is often said that the\nEuropean=\r\ns wrecked the Japanese way of war by introducing them to the\ngun, which the=\r\n samurai of the Edo era then consequently rejected. Well\napart from the fac=\r\nt that we didn&#39;t introduce them to the gun at all,\nthey had it long before =\r\nwe got there, all we did was show them how to\nmake an iron screw thread (an=\r\nother story), there is the story from the\nKorean campaign which if I recall=\r\n correctly there&#39;s a letter from a\nwarrior stating something like &quot;don&#39;t bo=\r\nther bringing swords, just bring\nguns&quot;, which is a heck of a different atti=\r\ntude to the later samurai.\nAgain, the promotion of a distaine for firearms =\r\nmakes alot of sense if\nyou are the Tokugawa, hanging on to power by your fi=\r\nngernails.\n\nThe whole sword thing, was blown out of all proportion, again I=\r\n think to\naid the cause of peace, Tokugawa peace that is. To explain by way=\r\n of an\nanalogy: if we translate the samurai in to the equivalent of today&#39;s=\r\n\nmodern soldier, and then encouraged them to think of all weapons with\nthe =\r\nexception of the pistol, as just work-a-day tools, and that &quot;real\nmen&quot; figh=\r\nt with hand guns, upon which they lavish great time effort and\nexpense, in =\r\nmastering the art of the solo pistol shoot out, how\neffective would they be=\r\n when it came to waging a serious war as part of\na large army? Answer, see =\r\nthe Shinabara revolt 1638 and the cancellation\nof the invasion of the Phili=\r\npines, followed by the absolute sealing of\nthe country!\n\nI know that the ab=\r\nove is a bit of a sweeping generalisation, but as such\nI feel it to be a wo=\r\nrking hypothesis.\n\nOkay, ducking for cover:-)\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\nIn message &lt;cjs=\r\nvnq+oetc@...&gt;, Saitoh Hajime\n&lt;the_sam_99@...&gt; writes\n&gt;\n&gt;    S=\r\npeaking of bushido, the samurai didn&#39;t have a code per se in the \n&gt;    late=\r\n\n&gt;    sixteenth century during the last great wars for the shogunate, did\n&gt;=\r\n    they? It just came to my mind because in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (the \n&gt;    =\r\nDVD\n&gt;    menu of the second disc) it says that &quot;for 1100 years the samurai =\r\n\n&gt;    have\n&gt;    lived by seven principles...&quot; or whatever, and I seem to re=\r\nmember \n&gt;    that\n&gt;    the &quot;code&quot; was established after the samurai stopped=\r\n serving a true\n&gt;    military purpose with the peace of the Tokugawa era.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;    Miburo Saitou\n&gt;\n&gt;    --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledb=\r\netter \n&gt;    &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt;\n&gt;    wrote:\n&gt;    &gt; \n&gt;    &gt; --- Ruby Harper &lt;ma=\r\ndmadotakuchick@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;    &gt; \n&gt;    &gt; &gt; \n&gt;    &gt; &gt; Well, aren&#39;t you jus=\r\nt so smart, Dave. ^_^ There\n&gt;    &gt; &gt; weren&#39;t very specific laws on Samurai,=\r\n but there was\n&gt;    &gt; &gt; only on consistency in their codes and rules. The\n&gt;=\r\n    &gt; &gt; Code of Bushido, which was a set of ten ideals for\n&gt;    &gt; &gt; samurai=\r\n set down for all with a sword to follow. I\n&gt;    &gt; &gt; think they were given =\r\nto someone by one of the Kami\n&gt;    &gt; &gt; or gods/goddesses, but I can&#39;t quite=\r\n remember the\n&gt;    &gt; &gt; specifics.
