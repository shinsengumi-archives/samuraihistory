To show the quality of his craft, \nMuramasa placed his blade in the streambed in such a way that the \nedge just broke the surface. As the leaves floated by, they were\nneatly cut in two, and Muramasa recovered his blade, proud of his\ncraftsmanship.\n\nMasamune then placed his blade in the stream. This time, as the\nleaves floated along, the were deflected to the left and right,\nslipping past the blade, as it were, without harm.\n\nThis story is used to exemplify the difference between the two\nsmiths, but the tale is apocryphal, the two men lived about 200 years \napart, but it does demonstrate the reputation of their blades.\n\nMuramasa was noted for &#39;bad luck&#39; blades, and I have read somewhere\nhe might have suffered from some mental disability, perhaps\nschizophrenia (quite how this is arrived at, I have no idea).\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu had an antipathy towards Muramasa blades, he cut\nhimself with one as a child, his grandfather was killed with one and\nwhen his son committed seppuku, the kaishaku used a Muramasa blade. \n\nIeyasu let it be known that his men should get rid of them if they\nowned one, and Muramasa blades became prized possessions amongst his\nenemies.\n\nMy question - is the &#39;ill luck&#39; reputation of Muramasa blades founded\non Ieyasu&#39;s antipathy, or is there evidence of this prior to the\nTokugawa?\n\nThomas \n\n\n\n\n"
