I found the Samurai pages through my Sensei&#39;s web page link, and \n&gt; before this, I didn&#39;t know people studied the Samurai and Japanese \n&gt; history with such enthusiasm. It&#39;s an eye opener for me. :-) Good to \n&gt; have one&#39;s eyes opened. \n&gt; My name is Sharon Hayakawa, aka Shuri Hayakawa. I live in Missouri, \n&gt; USA. My Sensei is Doshu Shiro Shintaku from Wakayama Japan. \n&gt; Before studying with him, I studied with Seiyu Oyata. About 17 years \n&gt; or so. \n&gt; Hajimemashite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
