Certainly, as Noh was a theatre of the samurai elite, there was also Kyogen and Kabuki as a theatre of the people.  I leave it to the Moderator to decide the relevance of this post to samurai history...\n\nI was &quot;just trawling&quot; a link from one of my Nihonto links on sword swallowing\nhttp://www.swordswallow.com/index.php\n\nfollowed a link on that page\nhttp://www.swordswallow.com/history.php\n\nand found a link there to sword swallowing in Japan ca 750\nhttp://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/japan/DanceDrama/Japanese_Drama_Noh.html\n\nwhere I found the following introduction:\n\n&quot;Welcome to Horace Mann&#39;s Webpage on\nDrama in Medieval through 19th century Japan:\nKyogen, Noh, Kabuki, and Puppets (Bunraku)&quot;\n\nI&#39;d never heard of Horace Mann, but it appears he was a great and famous American educator (1796-1859).  Live and learn...\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
