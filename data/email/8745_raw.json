It was \nof a=\r\n group of warrior monks running along a beach, I think, with a \nwide assort=\r\nment of polearms held up. I believe one was a large war \naxe, an ono I thin=\r\nk. The other polearms may have been similar to the \nweapons that were suppo=\r\nsed to be carried by Benkei. If anyone can \nprovide me with information abo=\r\nut this painting or an image it would \nbe greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n\nSin=\r\ncerely,\n\nIsaias\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
