I have read all but the last ones mention..  I have \nnot read the last of the Laura joh Rowland books ;  will check it out..  \n\nI had a hard time reading Autumn Bridge at first...  but then about mid way \nthrough the book the light kicked on; after that I could not stop turning the \npages.   \n\n   Will look into the series you spoke of also.  I kinda thought about \nweahter are not that much prtocal would be going on in the era that Clound of \nSparrows was in.   but like you enjoyed it..  Was a fun read. although as in shogun. \n I doubt that an american would be able to get away with taht much in Jpan \nsuring the era.  Was the only thing I did not care for in the book.  Thanks \nagain for the post...  Liketoknow what I am reading even though fiction is showing \nthe time and era in a hsitorical pretext.  \n\n  blessing from an old Taoist Man...\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n"
