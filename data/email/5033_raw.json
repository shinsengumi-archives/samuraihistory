I love his early books like Dance, \nDance, Dance and The Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the \nWorld. \n\nI think it&#39;s really important in coming to understand a culture to read \nwidely in its literature - especially if you want to write about it. I was \nreminded again last night, watching Aoyama&#39;s film Eureka, how \ndifferent Japanese narrative style is from Western - which is why some \npeople find Japanese novels hard going. It&#39;s worth thinking yourself \ninto the necessary different mindset. And just to try reading in kanji is \nworth it too, to realise the vividness and graphic nature of this way of \nwriting.\n\nLili and the other writers, I&#39;ve had a sort of historical fantasy published \nrecently set in an alternative mediaeval world based on Japan. It&#39;s \nunder the pseudonym Lian Hearn and is called Tales of the Otori. Our \nexcellent moderator was kind enough to post the first chapter of the \nfirst book some time ago. If there&#39;s anything I can help you with in \ndiscussing some of the issues involved in writing this sort of novel \nperhaps you would like to contact me off board. I&#39;m going away in 10 \ndays but will try to reply before then.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n\n"
