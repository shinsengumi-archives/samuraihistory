I&#39;ve read of it in a \nfew \n&gt; books, but have not seen any scholarly verification.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lili\n\nLili\n\tI have heard of this also however can&#39;t remember where, I \nbelieve this to be the formal method of performing seppuku. Also \nanyone whom have done any form a martial arts will be able to tell \nyou this is no easy task, however with practice and dedication is not \nimpossible to carry off. Actually when first starting to learn \nmartial arts one of the first things you are taught is self control. \nWe are drilled again and again to perfect our control and when \nentering the higher grades we are expected to have that perfect \ncontrol. At this stage we are no longer stoping our punches or kicks \ninches away from the punching bag but instead we are stoping our \npunches and kicks half and inch away from classmates faces. What I am \ntrying to say is if we could have that kind of control now then image \nwhat they could do back then when there whole life where dedicated to \nthe art. \n\n\n\n"
