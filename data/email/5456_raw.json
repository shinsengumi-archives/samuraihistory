From your description it is very hard to say \nanything at all about your sword, however if you can share some \npictures with us there are people on the list who are happy to share \ntheir knowledge. You&#39;ll need several photos; one of the whole sword in \nit&#39;s scabbard, one of the naked tang/signature, one of the backside of \nthe tang, and if possible one of the first five or six inches above the \nhamachi and one of the kissaki (preferably a close up showing the \nhamon). Kantei from photos is always pretty dicey but as I said we are \nhappy to share what we can.\nTom\n\nPS the powder is likely uchiko which is used to clean the blade...\n\n\n"
