He personally did \nnot lose nor win the long-standing campaign against Nobunaga. But his \nsons could not match him and the Uesugi family became a non-factor \nrather quickly.\n\n\nOur kind host has a very nice summary of this at \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/kenshin.html\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
