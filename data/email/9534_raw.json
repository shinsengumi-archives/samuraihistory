In other\nwords, \n &gt; what percentage of the forces, if any, were mounted samurai, samurai\non foot \n &gt; and the different types of ashigaru (and their weapons: bow, spear,\nswords, or \n &gt; arquebus).\n \nOthers might have better overall statistics, but the Shimazu listed the\nfollowing for 1591:\n \n300 yari (200 of which are long yari), 200 hand-spears (not sure what\nconstitutes a hand-spear), 1,500 guns, 1,500 bows. That only describes a\nforce of 3,500, but perhaps might be typical, meaning 43% guns, 43%\nbows, 14% yari. Swords would not have been primary weapons and would be\na personal weapon not counted in these registers.\n \nAs for mounted men vs foot soldiers, from 1597 the Shimazu listed the\nfollowing (I&#39;m excluding labourers from this list):\n \n262 mounted men, with 5068 personal followers on foot. 800 other foot\nsoldiers (landless men, muashi, and squires, kaji ko-sho), and 665\nweapon bearers. If we exclude weapon bearers (or dogu, who may or may\nnot have actually fought in battle, I&#39;m not sure), then that&#39;s 4%\nmounted samurai with 96% foot soldiers. \n \n-AngusH\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
