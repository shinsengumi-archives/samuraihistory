So as an ashigaru, your taisho \noutranks you with his job position, like the employee-manager setup, \nbut it isnt &quot;rank&quot;, it is just a job, or job title.\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; For the benefit of Oyakata, here&#39;s the original post\n&gt; again.
