I am being driven crazy over\n&gt; this, so i was\n&gt; wondering if you guys could help me out and try to\n&gt; set me straight on\n&gt; this subject.  Thanks for your help.\n\nCan&#39;t say I blame you--after a quick search, I came up\nwith a billion hits for Onimusha or other video games,\nbut only found one or two things that had any claim to\nreality. 2 sites mention the &quot;Toshiie to Matsu&quot; NHK\ndrama from 2002. Apparently Maeda Keijiro made an\nappearance in one episode, though it doesn&#39;t explain\nmuch. While it is a TV show, generally the NHK dramas\ncan be viewed as &quot;mostly&quot; historical, and so I&#39;d\nassume that he was a real person. \n\nA little while later I found this site:\nhttp://shungansho.fc2web.com/meguruhito/maeda.htm\n\nI&#39;ve not got the time to get out the denki jisho and\ntranslate it, but a brief glance shows he was an\nadopted son of Maeda Toshiie, and at the time of\nSekigahara served Uesugi Kagekatsu. \n\nHope that helps. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
