I have so often heard \nthis ide=\r\na that Zen is a philosophy, not a religion. This comes in \nAmerica mostly f=\r\nrom the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s and the explosion of what one \nof my teachers called =\r\nCalifornian Buddhism. Psuedospirtual wannabes \nwho wanted to rebel against =\r\nJeudo-Christian thought read a book or \ntwo and started teaching their misu=\r\nnderstandings to others. A \nperfect example that is thrown around a lot in =\r\nAmerica... &quot;the world \nis only an illusion&quot;. No the world is very real, Zen=\r\n does not teach \nthat the world is in any way an illusion. What is the illu=\r\nsion is \nhow we see the world due to our own mental attachments, which keep=\r\n \nus from seeing how it really is. Zen is a religion, just because \nthere i=\r\ns usually no mention of god/s, devil/s, heaven or hell doe \nnot keep it fro=\r\nm being a religion. Zen does not teach these things \ndo not exist, but rath=\r\ner if they do or not is unimportant to the \ngoal of Zen. With some alterati=\r\nons Zen can be practiced as a \nphilosophy instead of a religion, i mean the=\r\n idea of rebirth life \ntime after life time is religious and would have to =\r\nbe removed to \npractice it purely as a philosophy, in its original context =\r\nZen is a \nreligious teaching. This is not to say that the idea of \nphilosop=\r\nhical Zen is wrong.... rather keep in mind that it is a \nphilosophy based o=\r\nn a religion. As much as I don&#39;t like to do \nthis... it would KIND OF (and =\r\nI am stressing kind of)be like someone \nsaying they followed the teachings =\r\nof Jesus without believing he was \nthe son of God. That&#39;s the best Western =\r\ncomparison I can think of. \nSo yes, if you change some things Zen can be pr=\r\nacticed as a \nphilosophy and not a religion.... but to say that it IS NOT a=\r\n \nreligion is a misunderstanding of Zen.\n\n\n"
