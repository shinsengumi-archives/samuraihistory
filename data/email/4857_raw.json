His father&#39;s name was\n&gt; Yasutsugu (=8DN=8E=9F). Toshitsugu was=\r\n born in 1595 as the\n&gt; oldest son. In 1621 he inherited Yasutsugu&#39;s 35,000\n=\r\n&gt; koku fief in Mikawa. In 1636 he moved to Kameyama-jo\n&gt; in Ise, and his fi=\r\nef increased to 50,000 koku. In 1651\n&gt; he moved to Omi province, and increa=\r\nsed to 70,000\n&gt; koku. In 1664 he relinquished head of the family to\n&gt; his 2=\r\nnd son, Yasu(?) =81i=8DN=8F=AB) (Someone help me with the\n&gt; reading...&quot;sho&quot;=\r\n is the only one I know), and died in\n&gt; 1668.\n\nWould that be any relation t=\r\no the Honda Yasutoshi who is currently \nthe featured samurai on the Samurai=\r\n Archives homepage? It would \nsuggest that Yasutoshi was Toshitsugu&#39;s (adop=\r\nted) uncle, but I&#39;m \ngetting confused with all these Hondas now...\n \n&gt; And =\r\nthat settles my question about the different &quot;da&quot;\n&gt; kanji also--both Masano=\r\nbu and Tadakatsu used `=BD. =96{&quot;c,\n&gt; with the &quot;field&quot; character, however, =\r\nis the Motor\n&gt; Company (I checked), so it&#39;s doubtful that it&#39;s\n&gt; connected =\r\nwith the Honda family above. Unless, of\n&gt; course, as is possible, someone c=\r\nhanged the character.\n\nIt&#39;s a very, very vague recollection of mine - I thi=\r\nnk I only saw \nthe reference in passing once and that was some time ago, so=\r\n I could \nvery easily be wrong about that.\n\n\n"
