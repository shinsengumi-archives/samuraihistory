Perhaps you might want to put a link to=\r\n it in the Edo Period section of the Samurai Archives Citadel.\n \nSpeaking o=\r\nf film and seppuku: I&#39;ve brought this up before. But Kobayashi&#39;s film SEPPU=\r\nKU discussed incidents of early Edo-period ronin from disbanded clans comin=\r\ng to clan gateways to request a spot to commit seppuku. In the film, the ma=\r\nin fictional character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) mention a name of a ronin who cam=\r\ne to the Sengoku clan&#39;s gateway (unfortunately, the man&#39;s name mentioned in=\r\n the film has escaped me at the moment). This ronin told the clan leaders t=\r\nhat he preferred to commit seppuku rather than live on in endless poverty. =\r\nThe Sengoku clan leaders were so impressed that they made him a member of t=\r\nheir clan. After that, supposedly scores of impoverished ronin went to clan=\r\n gates with seppuku requests and the clans would give them &quot;go away&quot; money.=\r\n Sooner or later most of these seppuku requests were insincere; the ronin i=\r\nnvolved wanted the money rather than actually wanting to commit seppuku. As=\r\n many of us know, the film SEPPUKU involves a ronin making such a request -=\r\n- with tragic consequences. \n \nAnyway, I don&#39;t really want to discuss the f=\r\nilm. Rather I&#39;m curious to know: did the incident mentioned in the film inv=\r\nolving the Sengoku clan actually happen? Or did Kobayashi (and/or novelest =\r\nTakaguchi) draw a completely fictional event with fictional names out of th=\r\ne hat? I wonder if you&#39;re planing to include this in your work. \n \nNina aka=\r\n &quot;Wave Tossed&quot; -- Moderator of the Edo Period section of the Samurai Archiv=\r\nes Citadel Forum\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:=\r\nsamuraihistory@yahoogroups.com] \nSent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 1:30 AM\nTo=\r\n: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] - HOGEN INCI=\r\nDENT\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your reply... I will have to check on that film. I am a=\r\nlways interested in Japanese film, especially if it is relevant to my study=\r\n. \n\nAlso, thanks for mentioning that study. It may help depending on the co=\r\nntent. My research is actually on seppuku and the Edo Period, but, in the p=\r\nrocess, I am comparing several examples ranging from the war chronicles to =\r\nYukio Mishima. I would be happy to share my work with anyone who is interes=\r\nted once it is finished--as long as it isnt bashed too much ;)\n\nI am specif=\r\nically looking for text resources other than the Hogen Monogatari. Hogen Mo=\r\nnogatari only seems to cover Uno Chikahara briefly. This short passage cont=\r\nains a reference to seppuku which is believed to be the first in the war ch=\r\nronicles. I was hoping to find some information about this individual, but =\r\nhave come up empty so far.\n\nJonathan P.

The list seems to=\r\n be a little quiet at present so I&#39;ll be \nindulgent and ramble on a bit abo=\r\nut this film, one of my favourites.\n\nA thoroughly enjoyable movie, one revi=\r\newer commenting &quot;Kinugasa&#39;s sublime \ncontrol of color intensifies every emo=\r\ntion in his Academy Award=AE-winning \nmasterpiece, a classic 12th-century t=\r\nale about a warrior whose love \ndishonors a married woman. The screen is st=\r\neeped in fiery reds for chaotic \nbattle scenes, then blanketed in soothing =\r\nimages of white-kimonoed priests \nbeside a calm blue sea. The exquisite com=\r\npositions and charged performances \nof Kazuo Hasegawa and Machiko Kyo depic=\r\nt a culture dedicated to order, yet \neasily rocked by passion.&quot;.\n\nAnother r=\r\neviwer \nhttp://www.amazon. &lt;http://www.amazon.com/Gate-Hell-Teinosuke-Kinug=\r\nasa/dp/6303073093&gt; com/Gate-Hell-Teinosuke-Kinugasa/dp/6303073093 comments:=\r\n\n\nIn 1953, Teinosuke Kinugasa (1896-1982) directed and co-adapted the \nhist=\r\norical play entitled &quot;Jigokumon&quot; (English transliteration of the \nJapanese =\r\ntitle), which was written by Kan Kikuchi (1888-1948). The film&#39;s \nname (the=\r\n same as the play) translates into English as &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, and \nwas rele=\r\nased theatrically in the U.S. in 1954. The story takes place in \n12th-centu=\r\nry Japan during the Heian period and at the start of a revolt. \nDuring the =\r\nconfusion and fear running rampant through the royal palace in \nKyoto, a la=\r\ndy of the court, Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyo), is rescued by a soldier \nnamed Mo=\r\nritoh (Kazuo Hasegawa, 1908-1984). After the revolt fails, Moritoh \nis told=\r\n that he can have anything that he wants, and what he wants is Lady \nKesa t=\r\no be his wife. He is quickly told, however, that she is already \nmarried to=\r\n Wataru Watanabe (Isao Yamagata, 1915-1996). Rather than seek \nsomething di=\r\nfferent, Moritoh becomes dangerously obsessed with Lady Kesa.\nFilmed in bea=\r\nutiful & vibrant color (probably one of the first color films \nfrom Japan),=\r\n the cinematography in &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; is exquisite. The story is \nby no mea=\r\nns dated, though it does become somewhat predictable. Still, it is \nboth co=\r\nmpelling and engaging and the acting is superb, especially Machiko \nKy. Mem=\r\norable scenes in the film include the confusion at the royal palace, \nLaky =\r\nKesa hiding from traitorous soldiers, Moritoh meeting Lady Kesa and her \nau=\r\nnt after the revolt, Moritoh given the choice of his heart&#39;s desire, the \nh=\r\norse races, Moritoh at the home of Lady Kesa&#39;s aunt, and the ending scenes.=\r\n \nThe makeup used on Moritoh could have been better.\n\nThe film won several =\r\nawards including an Oscar for Best Costume Design, an \nHonorary Academy Awa=\r\nrd for Best Foreign Language Film and the prestigious \nGrand Prize at the C=\r\nannes Film Festival in France. Overall, I rate &quot;Gate of \nHell&quot; with 4 out o=\r\nf 5 stars. Hopefully, the film will be fully restored and \nreleased on DVD =\r\none day. I highly recommend the film.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry Thomas.\n\n----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \n\nFrom: &quot;jonathan ellgen&quot; &lt;jpellgen@yahoo. &lt;mailto:j=\r\npellgen%40yahoo.com&gt; com&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 9:28 AM\nSubj=\r\nect: Re: [samuraihistory]\n\n&gt;I am working on a section of my master&#39;s thesis=\r\n dealing with the Hogen \n&gt;Incident.
