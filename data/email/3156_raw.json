The\ncastle is located in Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture, just a short walk from\nthe train station. I&#39;m sure if you look under castles of Japan and look up\nKofu castle, you might find something there.\n\nI&#39;m new at this and am really interested in the subject. I was born in Kofu\njust after the war and spent nine years growing up there before moving to\nthe states. My mother claims that one of the lords that ruled the castle was\nmy  great -----. grandfather. She claims we were samurai but who knows the\nreal truth. Our family crest is the same as the Tokugawa clan. \n\nI have played at the castle as a child and have recently visited the castle\ntwo years ago. They are making a concerted effort to restore the place but\nit will never be able to bring it back to it&#39;s early state.\n\nI don&#39;t doubt my mother&#39;s story about the samurai line since my cousin has\nthe family &quot;katana&quot;. He received it since he is the son of oldest male in\nthe Takezawa family. Just before my uncles death, he explained to me his\nfamily has always hidden the swords since the Japanese were never allowed to\nown a true katana that was handed down through the generation. Another\nfamily myth?  \n-------Original Message-------\n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Thursday, January 15, 2004 07:53:15 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Castles in Japan\n\nHi,\nCan anyone tell me something about the following castles:\n1.Iwadono-jo(I&#39;m not sure it existed)\n2.Odawara-jo\n3.Kofu-jo\n4.Gifu-jo\n5.Inuyama-jo\n\nAny help will be appreciated.Thanks,Edy.\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
