It started in 1963. Most of the\ndramas take place in the sengoku or bakumatsu period. They usually have the\nbiggest stars in Japan. This years which just finished here in Japan was\nMusashi, next years will be Shinsengumi. A condensed version is often shown\nat the end of the year, and this it was is available on video and DVD (Tobu\nGa Gotuku is one of them). the only full length one I have seen released is\n1983s Tokugawa Ieyasu. The ones available here are of course without\nsubtitles.\n\nAnother miniseries about Saigo Takamori is Takarazaka with Satomi Kotaro.\nIts about 4hrs long and is on Video. Its also shown frequently on cable. The\nFamily Channel here in Japan will repeat it as well as some other recent\njidai geki over the shogatsu holidays.\n\n\n"
