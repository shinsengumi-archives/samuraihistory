One of the ideals of the samurai was\n&gt; _bunbu ichi_ (I&#39;ve also seen that transliterated as _bunbu no ichi_, \n\nYou shouldn&#39;t. That makes no sense in Japanese, where it is, strictly, &quot;bunbu \nichi.&quot;\n\n&gt; This has been translated as &quot;pen and sword\n&gt; in harmony.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s as good as anything, I guess.\n\n&gt; You see, it is not enough to know how to swing a sword.  Even if you regard\n&gt; your blade with the deepest respect, even if you practise endlessly, that is\n&gt; only a beginning.  You must also attain some cultural accomplishments:  to\n&gt; be able to compose poetry, say, or to draw well.  A samurai who couldn&#39;t\n&gt; exhibit basic literacy would not have been well regarded in polite society.\n\nAh, but that&#39;s the whole point. &quot;Bunbu ichi&quot; was not a set rule. It was a \ncontroversy. There were many houses that openly eschewed any appearance of the \n&quot;soft, poofy stuff&quot; -- Some houses even maintained draconian punishments like \nbanishment or forced seppuku for those caught studying literature or playing \ngames or musical instruments; they deemed these pastimes as &quot;unworthy&quot; of the \nwarrior.\n\nOther houses felt that, well, &quot;bunbu ichi.&quot;\n\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
