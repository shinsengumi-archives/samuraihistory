You can see a lot of recreations of\nvarious Edo and Meiji houses and buildings. Also in Gifu there is Meiji mura\nwhere many buildings from the Meiji period have been transplanted and\npreserved. That was quite an amazing place.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Gillian Rubinstein &lt;gillyru@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, August 17, 2002 9:29 AM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] bakumatsu background\n\n\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve received a cultural exchange fellowship to spend three months in\n&gt; Yamaguchi-ken from October to December this year to research a novel\n&gt; which will be based on events in Choshu in the 1850s and 1860s. I&#39;ll\n&gt; also be in Tokyo,  Osaka, Nagoya and Kagoshima for short periods. I&#39;ve\n&gt; been to the area I&#39;m staying in before and know Hagi and Yamaguchi quite\n&gt; well. I&#39;ve been reading Craig, Jansen, Wilson etc. Has anyone got any\n&gt; suggestions for:\n&gt; 1)further reading, especially social and women&#39;s history, or historical\n&gt; novels (Japanese is a bit of the one page a day variety, but it&#39;s not\n&gt; impossible - I&#39;ll have plenty of time for reading in rural Japan, and\n&gt; can either buy books in Tokyo or get friends to order them for me)\n&gt; 2) places to visit that give a sense of everyday life in pre-Meiji and\n&gt; Meiji times. museums, samurai houses, villages etc.\n&gt; 3) historians or writers who&#39;d have time to talk to me (preferably in\n&gt; English, but again, Japanese is not impossible.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; btw I&#39;ve got a second hand copy of a book called Secrets of the Samurai\n&gt; by Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook, published by Tuttle in 1973. Does\n&gt; anyone know this book and what&#39;s your opinion of its accuracy?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Gillian\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
