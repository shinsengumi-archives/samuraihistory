And they can have=\r\n their own castles too?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What about Takeda of Kai? He had the kuni =\r\nall to himself?!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Francois B=\r\nOUTRY wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From 1336 up to about 1500/1520, each kuni had a l=\r\neading daimyo : the shugo (see the list in Grossberg&#39;s Japan&#39;s Renaissance)=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The shugo title appears almost up to 1570 but, in most cases, it i=\r\ns an empty one during the XVIth century and a kuni belongs either to one or=\r\n to several Sengoku daimyo who do not possess the shugo title i.e Mino to S=\r\nait=C3=83=C2=B4 and Izumo to Amako but Shinano, Mikawa, Harima or Aki to se=\r\nveral warrior families. There are some exceptions : the Shimazu, shugo of S=\r\natsuma and =C3=83&quot;sumi, the Takeda, shugo of Kai or the Imagawa, shugo of S=\r\nuruga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To take another example : Etch=C3=83=C2=BB and Noto are officia=\r\nlly under two members (shugo) of the Hatakeyama family but, in fact, the fi=\r\nrst province is splitted between various vassals of the Hatakeyama among wh=\r\nich the leading familiers are the Jimb=C3=83=C2=B4 and the Shiina. Similarl=\r\ny, in Noto, the leading families, among others, are the Ch=C3=83=C2=B4 and =\r\nthe Yusa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope I have been usefull\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messa=\r\nge du 07/11/10 20:39\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; De : &quot;konohawolfie&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A : samuraihistor=\r\ny@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Copie =C3=83 : \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Objet : [samuraihistory] =\r\nSimple Sengoku Daimyo Question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just a simple question ab=\r\nout daimyo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So each province/kuni had their own leading da=\r\nimyo, or the kuni functioned as a family base...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like the =\r\nUesugi has Echigyo, Tokugawa has Mikawa, Rokkaku had Omi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSince the kuni are large and are split into districts, did the Samurai clan=\r\ns have a leader in each district to spread their influence? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Like, Kenshin could live at his castle (not sure where) in one distict a=\r\nnd the others can be ruled by his loyal retainers?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or did =\r\na province had just one single daimyo leader?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
