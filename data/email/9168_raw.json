I know when 2 samurai battled, they\n  did t=\r\nhis by riding out to mid field, stating their\n  &gt;name and lineage, then att=\r\naching. How would this be stated?\n  &gt;&quot;I am Sanematsu Yoshihide of the clan =\r\nMinamoto from the Satsuma\n  Provinces---(now I&#39;m lost. Does he say en guard=\r\n\n  &gt;or what?? Or is this anywhere near what he&#39;d say?&quot;)\n  &gt;Thanks in advanc=\r\ne\n  &gt;Kay Swanson w/a Kei Swanson\n\n  If the war tales like the Heike Monogat=\r\nari and the Taiheiki are to be\n  believed, then a samurai might ride ahead =\r\nof the army, announce his name\n  and pedigree, and challenge someone from t=\r\nhe opposing army to attack\n  him. One example from Helen Craig McCullough&#39;s=\r\n translation of the\n  Taiheiki, where two warriors race ahead of their own =\r\narmy to be first in\n  to battle:\n\n  &quot;We are the lay monk Hitomi Shiro On&#39;a,=\r\n aged seventy-two, a resident of\n  the province of Musashi, and Homma Kuro =\r\nSukesada, aged thirty-six, a\n  resident of the province of Sagami, who sinc=\r\ne leaving Kamakura have been\n  resolved to perish in battle ahead of our co=\r\nmrades! Let those who are\n  self-confident come forth to observe the degree=\r\n of our skill!&quot;\n\n  Challenges like this were an attempt to earn recognition=\r\n on the\n  battlefield, which was the best way for a samurai to be rewarded =\r\nfor his\n  service. If the samurai died the rewards earned by his valour wou=\r\nld be\n  passed on to his family, which was the intent of the two warriors a=\r\nbove.\n\n  Acts like this would likely have been far more usual in Kamakura &=\r\n\n  Muromachi (12th through 15th C.) times when armies were smaller and\n  ba=\r\nttles more intimate than in Sengoku times when armies consisted mainly\n  of=\r\n ashigaru foot soldiers acting in mass formations.\n\n  -AngusH\n\n\n\n\n"
