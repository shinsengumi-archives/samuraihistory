And they weren&#39;t \nall bad were they? They had a code of ethics, I mean, not engagment-\nwise, but they&#39;re based around a type of militia/guerilla tactics. \nGenerally speaking, I don&#39;t think all samurai were honorable either. \nI&#39;m sure there must have been a handful of &quot;dirty&quot; samurai.\n;) Dustin\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Masamori Masami&quot; \n&lt;oni_shogun@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Generally samurai looked down on ninjas. They considered ninjas \n&gt; underhanded, deceitful, and un-honorable. Basically everything \n&gt; Bushido was not.  But where a samurai&#39;s goal in life was to \nmaintain \n&gt; his honor, a ninja&#39;s goal was to get the job done, honorable or \nnot. \n&gt; \n&gt; by the way a great site for ninja facts and anything ninja related \n&gt; is http://www.entertheninja.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, eric johnson \n&gt; &lt;ronin121293@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; hey-i love the dirty pair and am also relatively new to this \n&gt; particular group. i am also looking for samurai sites and sites \nthat \n&gt; are HISTORICALLY accurate concerning &quot;the men in the shadows&quot; \n&gt; or &quot;men of shadows&quot;- the ninja. i have learned a little of the \n&gt; history of a samurai called, i believe, &quot;the demon hanso&quot; (?) \nhatori \n&gt; hanso(?) who started a subversive group dedicated to intelligence, \n&gt; infiltration and guerrilla warfare.Apparently he used men (& women) \n&gt; who were willing to leave honor at home and do whatever it took to \n&gt; get an advantage over the enemy.Anybody with info on the ninja in \n&gt; relation to the samurai? Historically they seem to be bitter \n&gt; enemies -but is that accurate? ---\n&gt; &gt; Also-suggest any Dirty Pair sites?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; keiman0 &lt;KeimanZero@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; KonnichiWa to all-We were wondering about the real historical \n&gt; facts \n&gt; &gt; of the oniwabanshuu in Japanese history. Since discovering \nRurouni \n&gt; &gt; Kenshin we have been amazed at the attention to historical fact \n&gt; &gt; involved with this series. We have just started becoming \n&gt; interested \n&gt; &gt; in the Samurai histories but can find no info on this group of \n&gt; &gt; misunderstood Samurai. Any help will be appreciated and \n&gt; reciprocated. \n&gt; &gt; Kei and I are somewhat of an expert on anime in general and \nLovely \n&gt; &gt; Angels/Dirty Pair in particular as well as romanji script in \n&gt; Japanese \n&gt; &gt; and its English translations. We also collect lyrics in both \n&gt; &gt; languages and download music and video for animes too. Domo \n&gt; arigato \n&gt; &gt; for your assistances.
