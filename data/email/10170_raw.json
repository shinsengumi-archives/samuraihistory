It isn&#39;t  enough to \nlive there, become fluent in the language, even get married and have  kids.  \n \nI keep thinking of Lafcadio Hearn.  He eventually became a Japanese  \ncitizen, after doing all of those things AND writing numerous books on Japanese  \nmythology and folklore.  He essentially had to become a national cultural  \ntreasure to become a Japanese citizen.  \n \nSimply put, unless you&#39;ve got Japanese heritage, you&#39;re almost certainly  \nout of luck.\n \n--RMB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
