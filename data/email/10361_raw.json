Do I understand\ncorrectly that the Japanese did not acquire this technology until the mid\n16th century with Portuguese guns? (The route would be from China to Arabia\nto Europe and from there all the way back to Japan..  This is not at all\nintuitive.)  Similarly, the Chinese had movable type and a crude printing\npress (via India) by the mid 11th c., the Koreans the same 3 centuries later\nand apparently the Japanese even later than that.  Given the geographical\njuxtaposition, the treaties, diplomatic missions, the trade, and countless\nother factors, I am completely mystified that a technological advance by one\ncountry would not be almost immediately adopted by the other two.  I demand\nan explanation.  (But if that is impolite I meekly beg one.)\n\n-d\n\nRide wanted, off planet. Will share driving/expenses\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
