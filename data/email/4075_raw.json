As many other\npowerful peoples who left historic marks(excluding\nMAAAAD Al Queda or equivalently INSAANE terrorists), I\nthink that there are many things we can learn from\neach other, especially between the West and the East.\n\nOne more thing,(excuse me for my digression, Ahem..)\nthough. During World War Two, the power of China had\nbeen overestimated by the American politicians. Now, I\nhave observed the opposite. Her power has been\nunderestimated by the comtemporary American\nPoliticians and Westerners.\n\nFor a bright future for a mankind, I think that\nWesterner should give a proper respect to them.\nI think that this Samurai &#39;networks&#39; is one of\nchannels of communication we can use for better\nunderstanding each other. \n\n\nps. I am very impressed with what British did in the\nFalklands.\n\n\n\n\n                           Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n--- Thomas Davidson &lt;tom.davidson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; During the Falklands campaign the Parachute Regiment\n&gt; \n&gt; overstretched itself and launched an unsupported\n&gt; frontal attack \n&gt; from a hilltop upon a heavily defended Argentinian\n&gt; position.\n&gt; \n&gt; (The account I heard was given by a survivor now\n&gt; running a \n&gt; rehab charity for trauma victims.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Brits spent a cold, wet, hungry and terrifying\n&gt; night on a \n&gt; bare hillside, knowing they would be going in again\n&gt; at first \n&gt; light, and knowing they didn&#39;t pack enough men nor\n&gt; enough \n&gt; firepower to carry the position without a desperate\n&gt; and bloody \n&gt; fight. The survivor in question had lost both his\n&gt; best mates, \n&gt; (and was sticky with the gore of one of them, who\n&gt; was blown up \n&gt; at his side) and held little chance of either their\n&gt; success or \n&gt; his own survival.\n&gt; \n&gt; At first light their major walked down the hillside\n&gt; under a \n&gt; white flag. He explained to the Argentinian officer\n&gt; that they \n&gt; were Brit Paratroops and his men were champing at\n&gt; the bit to \n&gt; &#39;get stuck in&#39;. He further explained that they were\n&gt; going to \n&gt; attack within the hour, and that once they did he\n&gt; would not be \n&gt; held responsible for the conduct of his men, and\n&gt; quite frankly \n&gt; it was likely they would be taking no prisoners. \n&gt; \n&gt; His best advice to his opposite number was to\n&gt; surrender.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which is precisely what happened.\n&gt; \n&gt; The survivor&#39;s voice changed audibly when talking of\n&gt; the \n&gt; courage and sheer bravura of his officer, he was in\n&gt; awe of the \n&gt; man&#39;s nerve. No doubt the reputation of the Red\n&gt; Devils went \n&gt; before them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
