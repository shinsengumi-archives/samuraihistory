As far=\r\n as romantic fans of the samurai \nwould always be disappointed when looking=\r\n at the pragmatic Meiji \nrestoration, the alternative would have been a mas=\r\nsacre at the hands of \nthe Western powers. There was in fact NO WAY the Jap=\r\nanese could have \nresisted the weapons the Europeans had developed, and the=\r\n only city \nthat was actually attacked by the British (Kagoshima) was badly=\r\n damaged \nin a few hours of cannoning. Fear of invasions and blockades was =\r\n\nexactly was pushed the Tokugawa government to deal with the foreigners \nfi=\r\nrst (treaties), and to modernize as quick as possible.\nOne last note: there=\r\n is yet another East Asia country that managed to \nstay indipenedent, actua=\r\nlly in the long run even longer than Japan \n(that was occupied in 1942-1952=\r\n). It&#39;s Thailand (Siam). In fact, in the \n19th c., after British and French=\r\n had occupied Burma and Indochina, \nrather than entering Siam, they preferr=\r\ned to use it as a buffer zone. \nFor this reason (=3Dit was not an European =\r\ncolony) the Japanese did not \ninvade in the 1940s, but rather settled for a=\r\nn agreement. Thus, \nThailand independence is remarkable, but mainly due to =\r\nrather casual \nfactors--Meiji Japan, instead, had pull itself out of the mi=\r\nddle-age.\n\ncepo, honolulu\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been re=\r\nmoved]\n\n\n"
