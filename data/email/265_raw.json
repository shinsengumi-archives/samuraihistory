Bryant&quot; &lt;ajbryant@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; fredjnsn@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Indirectly on topic, but a question/comment\n&gt; nonetheless. . . In all\n&gt; &gt; my years of reading and studying Japanese Samurai\n&gt; history, I have\n&gt; &gt; NEVER come accross anything even remotely\n&gt; resembling &#39;a group of\n&gt; &gt; samurai practicing karate together in a dojo&#39;\n&gt; (quote is my own).  I\n&gt; &gt; have never seen any references to unarmed combat\n&gt; training, and don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; see much use for it anyway.  The samurai studied\n&gt; weapons, which is\n&gt; &gt; common sense, of course.  I don&#39;t believe (and\n&gt; this is opinion) that\n&gt; &gt; even &#39;powerful samurai families&#39; employed &#39;martial\n&gt; artists&#39; to teach\n&gt; &gt; them unarmed combat.  from my limited (6 years of\n&gt; martial arts\n&gt; &gt; training about 10 years ago or so - and my\n&gt; studying of martial arts\n&gt; &gt; history) is that unarmed combat originated in\n&gt; Okinawa, and at best\n&gt; &gt; 200 - 300 years ago.  I&#39;m sure that judo or\n&gt; jujitsu-like &#39;wrestling&#39;\n&gt; &gt; probably existed, but I doubt that Takeda Shingen\n&gt; or Oda Nobunaga\n&gt; &gt; hired martial arts experts to train there armies\n&gt; in the way of\n&gt; &gt; unarmed combat.  I would hazzard to guess based on\n&gt; what I&#39;ve read\n&gt; &gt; (and thus on what I &#39;haven&#39;t&#39; come accross) that\n&gt; mass training for\n&gt; &gt; the armies wasn&#39;t too common - even weapons\n&gt; training.  most ashigaru\n&gt; &gt; probably went out and cut themselves a bamboo\n&gt; spear and just charged\n&gt; &gt; into battle hoping for the best.  I would assume\n&gt; that any martial\n&gt; &gt; training with weapons was done on one&#39;s own, and\n&gt; not through\n&gt; &gt; a &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or\n&gt; closest to the lord,\n&gt; &gt; who would receive sword training.  Anyway, my\n&gt; point is that I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; never seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts\n&gt; training in\n&gt; &gt; the &#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books.  At best\n&gt; the subject comes up\n&gt; &gt; in the VERY questionable &#39;martial arts history\n&gt; books&#39;.  If someone\n&gt; &gt; has info on martial arts training from a\n&gt; &#39;reputable source&#39; PLEASE\n&gt; &gt; respond to this post.  I am curious about this\n&gt; simply because it is\n&gt; &gt; not something covered by Hall, Varley, Sansom,\n&gt; Berry, or the others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;d be surprised. There is an old martial art (the\n&gt; name of which escapes\n&gt; me for the moment) which is, essentially, &quot;wrestling\n&gt; in armour.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a very practical thing to learn to do, if\n&gt; you&#39;re an armoured warrior\n&gt; who periodically has to fight in close quarters. You\n&gt; learn how to grab and\n&gt; secure people wearing armour (where to grab, etc.)\n&gt; and how to avoid being\n&gt; grabbed while in armour.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
