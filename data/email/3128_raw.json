Here is what \nt=\r\nhe Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan has about their history: &quot;The geisha \nsys=\r\ntem emerged around the mid-Edo (=3DTokugawa) period (1600=961868). The \nfir=\r\nst geisha were male entertainers and thus the first such women were \ndesign=\r\nated onna (female) geisha. Gradually such entertaining became a \nfemale occ=\r\nupation. By the 1700s the profession of geisha was associated \nwith the gov=\r\nernment-licensed brothel quarters. From the end of the Edo \nperiod to the p=\r\nresent, geisha have had considerable connection with \npolitics, as the teah=\r\nouses provided convenient gathering places for \npolitical meetings. Geisha =\r\nfind it professionally in their interest to \nbe closemouthed about what goe=\r\ns on at these gatherings, but even so, \nopposition factions seldom patroniz=\r\ne the same geisha.&quot;\n--- So, as you see, they are a 18th c. phenomenon, as I=\r\n wrote in a \nprevious message.\n\n(2) The areas you mention, the Pleasure Qua=\r\nrters as well, were \norganized once again during the Tokugawa period. The w=\r\nhole popular \ngenroku cultured emerged from such settlements.\n\n(3) Geisha h=\r\nad played an important role politically, during the Meiji \nRestoration, and=\r\n even in more recent times in 20th c. Tokyo (tea \npolitics).\n\n(4) Finally, =\r\nI believe is a good idea to point out how today&#39;s geisha \n(and maiko) are N=\r\nOT prostitutes, but high-class entertainers. While \nsexual services were a =\r\npart of their work in the past, they had always \nbeen different from ordina=\r\nry prostitutes, for the simple reason that \ngeisha are trained in the tradi=\r\ntional arts - prostitutes are not. \nToday&#39;s geisha are professional musicia=\r\nns and dancers, and testimonial \nof a disappearing past. I know a few of th=\r\nem personally, and I can \nguarantee they&#39;re fantastic women, whose lives ar=\r\ne dedicated to art - \nnot to selling their bodies.\ncepo\n\n[Non-text portions=\r\n of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
