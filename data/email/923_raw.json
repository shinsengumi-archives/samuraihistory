What Ashigaru \n&gt; units were more likely to wear them? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Nuno Pereira\n\n\nSome Ashigaru were supplied with Sashimono by their Daimyo. Some \nDaimyo did not. Uniformed ashigaru seemed to be used during the main \nperiod of Sengoku about 1570-1600. My dates might be a bit off but it \nseems to me to coincide with the rise of professional ashigaru during \nthe later years. Each ashigaru would have one if so organized.\n\nBTW is your real name Nuno Pereira??? I ask because I am Portuguese \nand that name rings a bell regarding a general by I believe the same \nname during the wars vs Castille in the late 14 th century.\n\n\n"
