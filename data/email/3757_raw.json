There are four ranks: j� (purity), mei\n&gt;(brightness), sei (righteousness), and choku (uprightness). Regulations for\n&gt;ranking are fixed by the Jinja Honch�.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jinja Honch�\n&gt;Association of Shinto Shrines organized when the nation&#39;s shrines were\n&gt;disestablished as a result of the Occupation order issued in 1945.\n&gt;Membership includes most of all shrines in Japan (about 80.000 shrines) and\n&gt;about 20.000 priests. Guided by the spiritual leadership of Ise no Jing�.\n&gt;The Jinja Honch� works to preserve Shrine Shinto (Jinja Shinto) and to\n&gt;Maintain Principles of integrity. Its head office is in Tokyo, and local\n&gt;brances (jinjach�) are located throughout Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jinja Shint�\n&gt;Shrine Shinto. The traditional religious practices carried on in shrines\n&gt;throughout Japan&#39;s history, as well as the attitudes toward life which\n&gt;support these practices. At the core of this religion exists a reverent\n&gt;religious experience which has prevailed from antiquity and which leads\n&gt;Japanese believers to experience the will and activity of the gods through\n&gt;various events of everyday life. Shrine Shinto claims no founder, but\n&gt;through the interpretation of classical mythology and the re-evaluation of\n&gt;folk ways, it is gradually organizing its own theology. The\n&gt;politico-theoretical side of Jinja-Shint� is called Kokka Shint� or State\n&gt;Shinto. At present there are in Japan some 80.000 shrines of which some 97\n&gt;percent belong to the Jinja Honch�.\n&gt;\n&gt;Kugutsu and Kugai, I didn&#39;t found anything about.\n&gt;\n&gt;I found however Asagutsu:\n&gt;A kind of shoe worn by nobles in ancient times, and by Shinto priests \n&gt;during\n&gt;the performance of certain religious ceremonies today. Believed to have\n&gt;originally been constructed of leather, asagutsu have been made of hollowed\n&gt;paulownia wood finished in black lacquer since the Heian period.\n&gt;\n&gt;You can perhaps have more acess to shinto mysticism without becoming a\n&gt;priest, through shugendo, but you will surelly face the Honji Suijaku Setsu\n&gt;cosmogony inside the Shinbutsu Sh�g� that I already have mentioned before.\n&gt;\n&gt;regards\n&gt;\n&gt;Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\n&gt;S�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n&gt;\n&gt;Post Scriptum: I could put the kanji of the japanese mentioned names here,\n&gt;but does not have any apropriate software do input such data in the email.\n&gt;Does anybody know any freeware download I can do for that purpose?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Message: 15\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 31 Jan 2004 07:28:51 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;    From: Joseph Salvador &lt;jdsalvador3@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re:Gasaraki/shintoism mysticism questions\n&gt;\n&gt;Do a websearch for &quot;Japanese Journal of Religious\n&gt;Studies&quot; and find the publisher&#39;s site. They have most\n&gt;if not all of their article online as PDF&#39;s that you\n&gt;can check. I ran across an entire issue on Shugendo,\n&gt;but I didn&#39;t actually read them yet, that might help\n&gt;you.\n&gt;I think it was an issue from the late 1980&#39;s, not\n&gt;sure...\n&gt;Joe\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- keiman0 &lt;KeimanZero@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Can any of ya explain the meanings and historical\n&gt; &gt; significance of\n&gt; &gt; Shintoism mysticisms most notably Gasar or Gasaraki\n&gt; &gt; rituals? What\n&gt; &gt; does Gasar or Gasaraki mean? How about kai, kugutsu,\n&gt; &gt; kugai? The OT\n&gt; &gt; from Gasaraki is &quot;Message #9&quot;. Does this refer to\n&gt; &gt; the Samurai\n&gt; &gt; handbook &quot;Haga Kure&quot;? We have seen up to the\n&gt; &gt; penultimate ep and will\n&gt; &gt; see the final one soon. Arigato a lot and ja\n&gt; &gt; mata-Keiman and Kei.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nChoose now from 4 levels of MSN Hotmail Extra Storage - no more account \noverload! http://click.atdmt.com/AVE/go/onm00200362ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
