History books can be rife with \ninaccuracies,\n&gt; no matter how many years the author may have studied in Japan or \neven if the\n&gt; author is a native Japanese. Believe me, as an American, I&#39;ve read \nplenty of\n&gt; books on American history. If simply having the author being an \nAmerican\n&gt; were automatic proof of accuracy in historical research: I think \nthat most\n&gt; of the American people on this list know that there are scores of \ninaccurate\n&gt; books written about the U.S. by native-born Americans. So the same \nwith\n&gt; Japanese history works or the works about the history of any \ncountry or\n&gt; culture. \n\nThe reality is, we really don&#39;t have a clear picture of what went on \nduring the Sengoku period. It is a collection of letters, history \nwritten by the victors, history written 100 years after the fact, \nand conjecture.  I read an article about a year ago that talked \nabout a family who had family documents for a prominent Samurai \nfamily of the Sengoku who finally released it to scholars about 9 \nyears ago, and it turned out that a lot of what was thought to be \ncorrect history of that clan was actually incorrect. Also, there \nwere tons of documents destroyed by US bombing raids of temples that \nwere never examined, and even today there are decendants of samurai \nfamilies who have historical documents who refuse to release them to \nscholars because it is thier own &quot;family matters&quot;.  So there were \npotentially a lot of historical revelations destroyed during WWII, \nand historical documents that exist but are inaccessible to \nscholars.  When you think about it, some of what happened in the \nSengoku is both so epic and fortuituous, the only real explanation \nhas to be that there was more to the event(s) than what the \ndocuments currently tell us.  Too many people died of &quot;illness&quot; at \nperfect times for opportunists, and too many miraculous turnings of \nthe tides of war happened for me to believe that we have the &#39;whole&#39; \nstory.\n\n\n\n"
