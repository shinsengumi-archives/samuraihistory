If Ryoma had lived would the history of Japan \n&gt;have been different? (I suppose someone else would have assassinated \n&gt;him sooner or later.)\n\n\tI was afraid you would ask this. I am convinced I read or was \ntold that Rousseau was an influence on Ryoma. However in checking my \nreferences I can only find that Nakae Chomin was a student of French \nin Nagasaki at the same time Ryoma was there. At the time Nakae was \nstudying under Tosa sponsorship. He is famous for his liberal \npolitics in the Meiji period and his translations of French Code of \nLaw and &quot;The Social Contract&quot;. Clearly the democratic ideal inspired \nhim, but how early?  Thus there was likely no Japanese translation \navailable to Ryoma and he certainly didn&#39;t read it in the original \nlanguage. I will keep looking but may have shot down my own theory...\n\tI believe he would have been a positive influence on the new \nage. I imagine him growing fat and corrupt at the head of a \nMitsubishi type shipping concern and his own political party or \nperhaps leading elements of the new navy against the forces of Okubo \nin concert with Saigo and the forces of Satsuma or maybe staking a \nclaim as a world famous rogue after circumnavigating the globe with \nfrequent stops in the capitols and parlors of the worlds great \nNations.\n\ttom\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
