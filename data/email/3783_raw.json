The\n&gt; number before it \n&gt; is the actual number of rooms.  If the rooms are a\n&gt; standard 6 Tatami \n&gt; size then a 4 LDK mansion is a good sized apartment.\n&gt;  Not huge by \n&gt; western standards but very large by Japanese\n&gt; standards.  Am I right \n&gt; William?\n&gt;\nOkay, got it. I&#39;ve seen it in apartment adds, but\nnothing to explain it. Thanks.\n\n&gt; Brandon\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S.  I saw Inoue Waka on TV the other day.  I don&#39;t\n&gt; think that she&#39;s \n&gt; much more than eye candy.  Or maybe she was having a\n&gt; bad day.  \n\nNothing is wrong with just eye-candy. She&#39;s not the\nbrightest girl, but then again on most of her TV\nappearances Iijima Ai doesn&#39;t come across as smart\neither, and she really is. I think Inoue Waka is just\nas cute as can be--she&#39;s no Sawaguchi Yasuko, but then\nagain, no one else is. \n\nNate\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
