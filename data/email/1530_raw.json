How do you get one lifestyle from this variety?\n\n&gt;To be honest, I doubt Confucius had that much effect on our culture(Samurai in Edo shogunate could be an exception, or could not be).\n&gt;\nIt&#39;s more of a later period thing for sure, I forgot the Japanese for \nhis name, hmmm,... seems to be several! Jiha, Koushi, Sensei (not the \nusual kanji).\n\n&gt;Shinto might be a background, but how could it be distinguished from Animizm ?\n&gt;Or should them be treated as same?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nRites and customs differ tremendously among the few remaining groups \nthat are animists, that&#39;s probably how I&#39;d classify them.\n\n&gt;# National-Shinto by Imperial Japan was something different, I think.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes very. It seemed to be a method that the militarists used to justify \nrampant fascism.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n"
