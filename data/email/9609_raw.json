If you=\r\n have an interest in seeing an English-language book written about \nthem, p=\r\nlease send them an email.  You can get their conact info at \nwww.ospreypubl=\r\nishing.com.  Just a few minutes of your time and we might be able to \npersu=\r\nade them to make a valuable contribution to military history students.  \n\n\n"
