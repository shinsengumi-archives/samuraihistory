Whatever I feel from my blades is only one person&#39;s\nperception - and a modern person&#39;s at that, however deeply immersed (some\nwould say submerged) I might be in ancient traditions.  Whether anybody\nbelieves me or not can make no difference to my perception, of course; and\nlikewise, my individual - and entirely subjective - perception is highly\nunlikely to sway anyone else&#39;s belief.  And that&#39;s fine too.\n\tWhat I&#39;m seeing here is, I think, of more importance to the group.  I\ndidn&#39;t intend to start - or to contribute to - an argument.  I did hope to\nsee this dialogue come up:  informed discussion of the idea in the context\nof Japanese (and, by way of perspective, other cultures&#39;) beliefs in the\nmatter.\n\tI&#39;m learning here, gentlemen; and I thank you.\n\t\tGereg\n\nP.S.  For you other &#39;digest&#39; recipients:  _please_, when you&#39;re answering a\npost, delete the other irrelevant posts.  I&#39;ve been getting a string of five\nor six consecutive messages unrelated to current topics for the better part\nof a week.  I mean, sure, those are some good messages:  but.\n\tG.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
