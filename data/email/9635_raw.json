I am attempting to find out some histories or\n&gt; records of the events. I would particularly like to know some of \nthe\n&gt; prominent families/personas of the Tokugawa period alive in the \nearly\n&gt; 1600&#39;s. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have the following list\n&gt; \n&gt; Iyeysu Tokugawa\n&gt; Mori Terumoto\n&gt; Uyesugi\n&gt; Date Masamune\n&gt; Yamnanouchi\n&gt; Ukita\n&gt; Satake\n&gt; \n&gt; I need 2 more and/or comments on the families listed. I already \nhave\n&gt; hit the Samurai Archives for family history. More help and \ndirection\n&gt; would be, well....helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Wade Ness\n&gt; Social Studies\n&gt; Oak Ridge High School\n&gt;\nThere is just one fundamental problem with all of this, although your \nidea sounds like a lot of fun. Ieyasu did not close-off Japan. It was \nhis grandson, the third Tokugawa Shogun, Iemitsu, who ultimately \nclosed Japan to all but the Dutch, Chinese and Koreans.\n\nThere are numerous books that touch upon this subject. I would \nrecommend one of the general survey-type history books that George \nSansom wrote on Japan for starters. Volume 3 of his trilogy should do \nthe trick.\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
