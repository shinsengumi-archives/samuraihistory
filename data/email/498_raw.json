I don&#39;t think nobunaga actually sent mitsuhide&#39;s mother, I think he\njust took advantage of that fact when he found out.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From:\tNate Ledbetter [SMTP:ltdomer98@...]\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, January 23, 2002 11:36 AM\n&gt; To:\tsamuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [samuraihistory] Akechi Mitsuhide\n&gt; \n&gt; Those more knowledgeable on this board will probably\n&gt; have more information, but the information you cited\n&gt; is incorrect. Nobunaga I believe had signed a truce\n&gt; with the Bessho family in Harima, and as was customary\n&gt; each side sent hostages (hitojichi?). Bessho Nagaharu\n&gt; was sent to Nobunaga, and Nobunaga sent Akechi\n&gt; Mitsuhide&#39;s mother. Some time later Nobunaga decided\n&gt; to go back on this truce and killed Nagaharu. The\n&gt; obvious response for the Bessho was to kill\n&gt; Mitsuhide&#39;s mother. \n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, Mitsuhide suffered several humiliations\n&gt; at the hands of Nobunaga, who seemed to enjoy\n&gt; &quot;screwing with him.&quot; noted incidents include his\n&gt; firing of Mitsuhide as the organizer of one of\n&gt; Nobunaga&#39;s big wig parties in Kyoto in 1582, shortly\n&gt; before his betrayal. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Jeff Mayo &lt;irishman_2k@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Question: I seem to recall reading from one source\n&gt; &gt; that the reason Mitsuhide \n&gt; &gt; slew Nobunaga is that while Nobunaga was besieging a\n&gt; &gt; castle he decided to \n&gt; &gt; burn it down. From what I remember, Mitsuhide&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; mother was inside and while \n&gt; &gt; Nobunaga knew this he still set the castle on fire.\n&gt; &gt; Problem is I cannot find the source that I read this\n&gt; &gt; from. Does anyone know \n&gt; &gt; if this is indeed what happened?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeff M.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device:\n&gt; &gt; http://mobile.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send FREE video emails in Yahoo!
