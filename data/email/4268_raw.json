If  \nwe are talking about the Edo period hairstyles were =\r\nstrictly coded for  \nclass, rank and privaledge. Young men usually did not =\r\nshave their heads  \nuntil they took the Gempuku, coming of age, even then s=\r\nome might have  \nworn a long forelock. Thus in film we see older &quot;boys&quot; chi=\r\nded for  \nwearing this childish haiirstyle even though they are men or near=\r\nly  \nmen. Also not uncommon for &quot;gay&quot; characters to wear the same style eve=\r\nn  \nthough they are older.\n\tAn adult male attached to a lord would shave hi=\r\ns forelock, a ronin or  \nnon-conformist, might not. The many different styl=\r\nes mentioned above  \nmeant that a persons class and status were instantly r=\r\necognizable.  \nSamurai top-knots were set straight while farmers and mercha=\r\nnts were  \nset to one side or the other, how the end was cut, the material =\r\nused to  \ntie it and a dozen other things were proscribed by law.\n\tSasama t=\r\nells us that the hair could either be worn loose or up, in a  \nknot when we=\r\naring Oyoroi. At the time Heian gentlemen worn eboshi, a  \nsoft hat. Becaus=\r\ne it was soft it would fold over and these were known  \nas hire-eboshi, a s=\r\ntiff lacquered version was worn with kabuto,  \nwrapping the hair it was pul=\r\nled thru the tehen at the top of the helmet  \nbowl. Being associated with t=\r\nhe Bushi class they became known as  \n&quot;Samurai Eboshi.&quot; Heian fashion, not =\r\nunlike today was a very particular  \nworld with strict rules; a few loose h=\r\nairs was tantamount to farting in  \nsomeones face, so any loose hairs were =\r\nplucked.\n\tThere are several theories as to the rise of Chon-mage. One has i=\r\nt  \nthat shaving was more convenient than plucking for when wearing boshi  =\r\n\nbut  the hairstyle remained even when the hat fell out of use. Another  \ns=\r\nays the hat fell out of use because shaving the head became popular.  \nTher=\r\ne is the Nobunaga theory; he got fed up with plucking and said &quot;Oh  \njust s=\r\nhave it!&quot;, and the Jesuit theory; the style adopted by European  \nmonks bec=\r\name a nationwide fad (my favorite).The Mohawk theory; it was  \nconsidered s=\r\no manly and fiercesome no warrior could do without it.   \nSome say that tak=\r\ning the time to dress the hair before battle in an age  \nof constant warfar=\r\ne was useless and wasteful, so shaved heads were the  \nnorm for warriors ( =\r\nI think this one is the strongest argument).\n\tIt all seems to have come abo=\r\nut in the Sengoku Jidai, though it  \nstarted earlier, thats why I like the =\r\nlast theory, no one seems to be  \nsaying it was specifically because of or =\r\nfor the wearing of helmets.\n\n-t\n\nPS many Sumo-tori were of Samurai class or=\r\n recieved promotion to such  \nwhen very successful by the late Edo it was d=\r\ne rigeur...\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
