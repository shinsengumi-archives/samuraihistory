I think it was soemthing like the Saigo or Meji Rebellion,\nsince those were the two involoved. It was in 1877 when the new\nimperial geovernment was taking the samurai&#39;s swords from them. A\nbunch of samurai rebelled, but were defeated rather easily with the\nimperial armies guns. \n\nOne other one you might be thinking of happened earlier on, when the\ncountry was being unified. The Hogen Rebellion, a samurai rebellion\nagainst the imperial succession. \n\nThose are the two I remember with guns vs. swords. \n\nI hope Tom Cruise dies at the end.\n\n\n\n"
