Yamaga \nSoko wrote different things about bushido than Daidoji Yuzan or \nYamamoto Tsunetomo. And Nitobe Inazo&#39;s discussion of bushido is again \ndifferent. As a matter of fact, the term &quot;bushido&quot; was not even used \nvery much before the end of the 19th century, when there was no \nwarrior class any more. All authors who write on bushido are saying a \nlot of similar things, but when you read the details, where they \ndiffer, you notice that they had rather different thoughts on this \nmatter. \nI would really like to read your impressions on this.\n\nRegards,\nMax\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, TIMOTHY HEATON \n&lt;jahladracul@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;shogun.uk&quot; &lt;shogun.uk@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I really do consider that there should be some\n&gt; &gt; degree of exclusion in operation to prevent\n&gt; &gt; stupidity and ignorance, such as that exhibited by\n&gt; &gt; this person, poluting the &quot;group&quot;. I strongly\n&gt; &gt; believe in freedom of speech but that is a right to\n&gt; &gt; be earned and respected not abused. For anyone who\n&gt; &gt; is truely interested in the topic I will spend time\n&gt; &gt; and effort (both of which are getting very scarce at\n&gt; &gt; present} to aid and assist.  I feel certain that\n&gt; &gt; there are &quot;groups&quot; more suited to Mr. Heaton&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; abilities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kind regards to all those who take this topic with\n&gt; &gt; some level of seriousness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                                             Rod\n&gt; &gt; Johnson\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Although my English is pretty good {for a\n&gt; &gt; Yorkshireman} I find that it is the fingers on the\n&gt; &gt; keyboard that let me down at times......\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; this is mr.heaton \n&gt; \n&gt; in all do respect seriusness is what im seeking.\n&gt; for legend that the chinese spoke in which man has\n&gt; muscles in his feet ,legs and such that can enable him\n&gt; to jump great heigths and be as light as a feather may\n&gt; be a myth to some,but in american sports even\n&gt; basketball players have discovered this valuation to\n&gt; be true.and as bruce lee stated in his lecture of jeet\n&gt; kun do there is no boundry but in the mind for reality\n&gt; claims not a race or gender but whom are to grasp it\n&gt; instead ,not in exact words ,but the term of reality\n&gt; is not a time or limitation of ownership or being\n&gt; ruled over to be enabled to grasp more than the\n&gt; expectations of today.in kung fu,tai chi,ninjistu,jeet\n&gt; kun do,and samurai there is no boundry but what\n&gt; individuals set for themselves as each art is a basic\n&gt; conclusion to open the mind to all in order to\n&gt; overcome anything put in the way of true\n&gt; reality.martial arts that we are use to are just basic\n&gt; examples of how a man or women can be more than\n&gt; objects ,fear ,power over or under ,in being able to\n&gt; overcome any obsticles instead of seeking boundries\n&gt; seek a way of no boundries ,but in any lesson we learn\n&gt; not just how dangerous a sword is but in are fragile\n&gt; minds we must concern the utmost respect in moral\n&gt; consequince of even just the sword alone as well as\n&gt; our bodies ,but most of all our minds. there is no\n&gt; specific way to handle any fight but to keep in mind\n&gt; the stillness prayludes the discipline of speed.and to\n&gt; god believers or any miraculous accomplishment of a\n&gt; body how can anyone claim a place a time or race into\n&gt; reality,for it is the other way around.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
