I just got through discussing this myth\nin a post I just posted, so I won&#39;t repeat it here.\n \nYeah, the whole &quot;black-robed ninja&quot; thing. Arrrggghhh!!!  &lt;gross eye\nrollage&gt;\n \nBack to the farmer/samurai thing, however. It is true that the distinctions\nbetween the two classes were a bit more blurred before Hideyoshi&#39;s infamous\n&quot;sword hunt.&quot; Fumazawa Banzin (17th/18th century Japanese political\nreformer), in some of his works, discusses an age of &quot;farmer-soldiers&quot; in\nadvocating that Japanese society be structured along these lines rather than\nhaving the clear-cut distinction between farmers and samurai.   \n \nNina\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Nate Ledbetter\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 8:39 AM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [samuraihistory] Our &quot;welcoming&quot; attitude\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@...&gt; wrote:\n  \n&gt; To try and sum up, in studying history, one must\n&gt; consult many sources. And\n&gt; then use logic to decide the weight to be put on\n&gt; each source that is\n&gt; consulted.\n\nGood points. I&#39;ll also add that hearing the same wrong\ninformation over and over doesn&#39;t make it any more\nright.  You&#39;ll see it written many places that ninja\nand samurai were enemies, and all samurai were\nhonorable, etc, etc. Baloney. Stay away from broad\ngeneralizations like that, and you&#39;re probably on okay ground.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
