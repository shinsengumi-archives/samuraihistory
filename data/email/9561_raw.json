Christianity was spreaded very qu=\r\nickly in the hands of the jesuits.\nAnd soon some daimyos were converted. Ma=\r\nybe some of them really found truth in the western faith, but most of them =\r\naccepted to become baptized in order to get economical advantages in their =\r\ndeals with the portugueses.\nWhatever the reason was, obviuosly, when the lo=\r\nrd was baptized soon all their retainers followed his example. In that way,=\r\n in fact, most of the catholic samurais (there were not protestant samurais=\r\n) become christian only because it was his duty toward his lord. Some few e=\r\nxceptions exist anyway.\nAnd when the Tokugawa regime banned the christianit=\r\ny the vast majority of them just changed their faith as soon as his lord ch=\r\nanged.\nThe few ones that chose to persist in their beliefs (samurais and fa=\r\nrmers) were persecuted and most of them were indeed baptized in blood (mart=\r\nyrized).\n\nAsanga Chameera &lt;chameera@...&gt; wrote: Deal All,\n\nI got =\r\nknow that there were Christian Samurais , If you let you let me\nknow their =\r\nHistory , it would be interesting.
