I&#39;ve \n&gt; noticed that the earliest swords were straight but later ones up to \n&gt; preMeijei period were curved. Someone once told me (now I&#39;m not gonna&#39; \n&gt; say who in case they&#39;re wrong) that the tachi were curved due to the \n&gt; folding and cooling process. So actually the curving was supposed to a \n&gt; fluke or something, that&#39;s what I was told, it&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you guys think. Can anybody verify this or is it just bunk?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rod\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
