They existed in the Shin=\r\nano\nprovince.\n\nOf coarse Ive read everything the Samurai archives has and I=\r\nve read\nthe wiki info on Takeda shingen and the Sandas proper.  Ive gone ov=\r\ner\nthe &quot;general info&quot; books so prevailant in the libraries, but Im having\nt=\r\nrouble finding specific info on the Sanada themselves, despite being\nquite =\r\na famous family!  Im trying to get some books on Kawanakajima as\nwell, but =\r\nour library doesnt carry osprey :)\n\nI only do English :(  poor Gaijin that =\r\nI am.  \n\nIf anyone has some good books or other media to point me to, pleas=\r\ne do\nso! :)  I would be extremely appreciative.  \n\nAs a side note, Im engag=\r\ning this project for the purpose of living\nhistory.  Ive been involved in l=\r\noving history education for almost 13\nyears doing American Civil War and un=\r\ntil the last couple of years,\nWWII.  Ive set my sights on something that is=\r\nnt done a lot, especially\non the Eastern part of the U.S.  I dig &quot;dresing u=\r\np&quot; and doing\nconferences at high schools and elementary schools (the little=\r\n ones\n*love* it) and the like and I think World history teachers would\nreal=\r\nly get a kick out of me bringing in a samurai kit!  Ive done my\nCivil War s=\r\nchpeel at quite a few schools and I need something fresh\nthats more my thin=\r\ng.  I like Civil War, but Im a real nut for this!\n\nIve been studying sengok=\r\nu jidai for a few yeas now.  Ive poured\nthrough turnbull and bottomly and a=\r\n few translated works.  I am\nrecreating my own gear as authentically as pos=\r\nsible.  Im on another\nyahoo group e-list and Ive bounced some questions off=\r\n of a board or\ntwo.  Any little bit helps!!\n\nAnyway, if anyone has books th=\r\nat deal with &quot;daily life&quot; articles, I\nwould love to learn of those too.  Tu=\r\nrnbulls&#39; &quot;Samurai Sourcebook&quot; is\nmy favorite!\n\nKindest regards!\n-Jason\n\n\n"
