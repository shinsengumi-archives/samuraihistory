The \nByakko Tai were members of an irregular unit made up of boys 13-17 \ncreated for the defense of Aizu han. In 1868 when the forces of the \nTokugawa Shogun and those supporting his cause were pushed out of \nEdo, many fled north and gathered around the banner of Matsudaira \nKatamori,the lord of Aizu. As the Impperial armies of Satsuma, Choshu \nand others pushed north one by one the northern han opposed to them \nsuccumbed.\n\tThe Byakko Tai were sent to the outer line of defense on the \nfar side of iimoriyama hill, on the outskirts of Wakamatsu, to \nrelieve/reinforce regular troops fighting there. They were too little \ntoo late, suffering many losses they were put in retreat. When they \nreached the crest of the hill they could see Wakamatsu-jo burning. \nThinking all was lost, their homes, their mothers and sisters, they \nresolved to die like men. 19 young boys either stabbed each other in \nthe throat or committed seppuku on the spot.\n\tWe know their story because one of their number survived into \nold age, though he moved far from Aizu as an adult he asked to be \nburied among his friends as his dying wish. So there are 20 Names on \nthe memorial.\n\nTom\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
