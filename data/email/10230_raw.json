What I&#39;m tryi=\r\nng to figure out is the distinctive hairstyles of samurai.\n\nApparently, I r=\r\nead that samurai shave their hair in a &quot;half moon style&quot; when they reach a =\r\nparticular age or rank? This is also very noticed in Feudal Japan art.\n\nIs =\r\nthis the only hairstyle or are there others? I am also especially curious i=\r\nn youths hair (like teen samurai).\nAlso, why decide on shaving their head?\n=\r\n\nIf they have very short hair, can they keep it?\n\n\n"
