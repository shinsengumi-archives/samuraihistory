Sew the=\r\n outer shell to the hessian.\n\n2. Make up a wooden frame, like that for a pi=\r\ncture, pin the sewn panel \nto it, to keep it taught while you sew the finis=\r\nhed metalwork to it. \nThat way you don&#39;t get any wrinkles or folds accident=\r\nally permanently \nunder the armour. They would drive you nuts when you wear=\r\n it!.\n\nBTW use a simple running stitch through the flat round rings of the =\r\n\narmour. Otherwise you will be sewing forever! See #5\n\n3. Remove from the f=\r\nrame and cut it to shape.\n\n4. Sew a narrow leather or textile edging about =\r\n20-25m wide around the \nedge of the foundation, so that the edging fabric a=\r\nnd the foundation&#39;s \nedges match up. This will mean that the edging lays ov=\r\ner the top of the \narmour at this stage.\n\n5. Now &quot;paint&quot; the back of the he=\r\nssian with a thin layer of PVA glue \n(they would have used rice or fish glu=\r\ne, but you don&#39;t want to go \nthere). This glues the threads holding the arm=\r\nour in position, so that \nwhen one breaks the whole thing won&#39;t unravel. Th=\r\nis is why you don&#39;t \nhave to sew each plate individually. Seeing how the Ja=\r\npanese had done \nthis was a real revelation, as we had originally thought t=\r\nhe sewing \nwould take forever. Back then labour was cheap, so we thought it=\r\n wasn&#39;t \na problem - for them. This short cut really saves a tremendous amo=\r\nunt of \ntime, and for the Japanese it would have enabled them to make these=\r\n \narmours by the tens of thousands.\n\n6. Now cut out and lay the inner linin=\r\ng on the back of the armour.\n\n7. Fold the edging leather or fabric back on =\r\nitself and sew through it \nand all the fabric. This means that from the out=\r\nside of the armour you \nwon&#39;t see any stitching on the edging material, as =\r\nit is covered by the \nfolded back leather. The stitches that close the whol=\r\ne thing up are \nideally running parallel to the edging fabric, but not thro=\r\nugh it on the \nfront face.  Again use a simple running stitch to in effect =\r\ntack it \nclosed.\n\nThe idea is three fold, to protect the stitching holding =\r\nthe armour in \nplace from abrasion, by firstly having the entire back free =\r\nof exposed \nthreads, and secondly by having the thickened edge of leather o=\r\nr what \never you use to shield the edge thread from harm. Finally, and so \n=\r\ntypically Japanese, to permit the lining to be easily removed for \nwashing:=\r\n-)\n\nBTW if you need to access the inside to do repairs, all you have to do =\r\n\nis unpick the closest edge and move the lining aside.\n\nThis knowledge was =\r\nacquired with the help of Ian Bottomley formally of \nthe Royal Armouries, a=\r\nnd Mike Jessop, former keeper of the Wade \nCollection at Snowshill Manor, w=\r\nho over several year&#39;s arranged access \nfor myself and Dave Gavin, to close=\r\nly study various Tatami Do and other \npieces. The least I can do is pass th=\r\ne information around, otherwise \nit&#39;s just a self-indulgent waste.\n\nAnyway,=\r\n hope this helps, and all the best with your project.\n\nDean\n__\n&gt;\n&gt;--- On Tu=\r\ne, 11/3/09, Dean Wayland &lt;dean@...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;From:=\r\n Dean Wayland &lt;dean@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] =\r\nTatami-dou Tosei Gusoku\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Date: Tuesday,=\r\n November 3, 2009, 6:58 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=A0I am currently making a sui=\r\nt of tatami/karutakane armor (my first suit of\n&gt;&gt;armor), and I was wonderin=\r\ng if I could get any tips or cool photos of\n&gt;various\n&gt;&gt;sengoku armor pieces=\r\n. I am basing mine off of a suit from the Osaka\n&gt;&gt;castle museum (as seen on=\r\n page 128 of Samurai, by Mitsuo Kure), and\n&gt;it\n&gt;&gt;is in a haramaki-do style.=\r\n I especially want to ask Anthony J.\n&gt;&gt;Bryant-whose website has helped imme=\r\nnsely-some questions about\n&gt;plate\n&gt;&gt;thicknes, that is if anyone knows how t=\r\no contact him.\n&gt;\n&gt;Okay, regarding the thickness of the plates in a tatami-d=\r\nou, I&#39;ve\n&gt;examined several over the years, and the plates, when made of iro=\r\nn or\n&gt;steel varied from as little as 0.4mm, going up to circa 1.6mm.\n&gt;\n&gt;The=\r\n thinner one was in a private collection and is illustrated on page\n&gt;88 of =\r\nIan Bottomley&#39;s and Jock Hopson&#39;s book &quot;Arms and Armour of the\n&gt;Samurai&quot;. A=\r\nlthough extremely thin, they were well domed and hardened\n&gt;so\n&gt;as to resist=\r\n deformation. The armour was probably made during the very\n&gt;early Edo era f=\r\nor a samurai as a travelling piece, as the quality of\n&gt;the finishing is ver=\r\ny high.\n&gt;\n&gt;For a practical fighting armour I&#39;d recommend going with 1.6mm p=\r\nlate if\n&gt;you can. When properly shaped they stand up well even if not harde=\r\nned\n&gt;and tempered. Note that the edge of each plate on an iron or steel\n&gt;ex=\r\nample is turned out a tiny amount so it lays flat(ish) against the\n&gt;textile=\r\n foundation, and the plates are arranged in a series of curved\n&gt;lines so th=\r\nat when worn it follows the contours of the body in\n&gt;horizontal rows.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ho=\r\npe your project goes well.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yours\n&gt;\n&gt;Dean\n&gt;\n&gt;If the armour is of hardened=\r\n and lacqerred rawhide leather, then\n&gt;typically you are looking at using ci=\r\nrca 3mm thick hide. Don&#39;t forget to\n&gt;coat the outer shell with a very thin =\r\nlayer of car body filler before\n&gt;lacquering. Okay the Japanese didn&#39;t use c=\r\nar body filler, but it&#39;s the\n&gt;closest thing you can get to the compound of =\r\nstone and other stuff that\n&gt;they did use:-) This will give you a fine smoot=\r\nh surface to paint.\n\n-- \nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.t=\r\nhefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
