I wont go into\ndetails to\n&gt;    much as I assume you are not a member of either\nryu.\n&gt;\n&gt;    kukishinden Ryu (KSDR) Kodachi has only 3 kata\nfor the\n&gt;    use of the kodachi. Once source I know may try to\nsay\n&gt;    there are a further 7 ura gata for these 3 omote\ngata,\n&gt;    but i have seen a Kukishin ryu densho and no ura\ngata\n&gt;    were listed in it.\n&gt;\n&gt;    In each one the attacker will come at you with a\n&gt;    katana and he is trying to cut across at your\ntorso.\n&gt;    The reason for this is you are moving around him\nand\n&gt;    you decide when to expose a weak point therefore\n&gt;    making him attack the area you choose. Once he\ndoes in\n&gt;    all three you rush in fast and thrust the kodachi\ninto\n&gt;    him.\n&gt;\n&gt;    In Hon Tai Yoshin Ryu (HYR), I have not studied.\nI\n&gt;    have been shown the kata once and I have them on\n&gt;    video. therefore cant describe them properly.\n&gt;\n&gt;    There are five omote kata and I am told maybe\nsome ura\n&gt;    gata (which I have not seen or know of). They\nlike the\n&gt;    Kuki kodachi involve thrusting and a few slashing\nsuch\n&gt;    as to the neck or torso.\n&gt;\n&gt;    The HYR tend to sink lower in kamae than the\nKSDR.\n&gt;\n&gt;    However there is a historical link between the\ntwo\n&gt;    ryu.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Kukishinden Ryu is really called Kukishinden\nHappo\n&gt;    Biken, and originates from Kukishin ryu (main\nbranch\n&gt;    of that is now Kukishinden Tenshin Hyoho) This\nall\n&gt;    originates from the Kuki family who are today\nstill\n&gt;    soke of the tenshin hyoho branch, and also head\n&gt;    priests of the Kuki shrine. IN the 1600s Ohkuni\nOnihei\n&gt;    was a shihan in the Kukishin ryu and met with\nTakagi\n&gt;    Gennoshin from Takagi Yoshin ryu. together they\n&gt;    exchanged ideas etc and Takagi Yoshin ryu was\nchanged.\n&gt;    Kukishin ryu Bojutsu was added to Takagi. In the\nearly\n&gt;    1900&#39;s Ishitani (Ishiya) sensei on his death bed\n&gt;    handed menkyo kaiden makimono for the Takagi\nYoshin\n&gt;    ryu to Takamatsu Toshitsugu, they were to be\npassed to\n&gt;    Kakuno one of his students. Both Kakuno and\nTakamatsu\n&gt;    held menkyo Kaiden in Takagi Yoshin Ryu and\nkukishin\n&gt;    Ryu. sort time later Minaki sensei is handed\nmenkyo\n&gt;    kaiden in the kakuno takagi ryu and from him him\nthe\n&gt;    HYR is developed.\n&gt;\n&gt;    for more indepth info and lines history check out\n&gt;    these sites.\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.hontaiyoshinryu.com/\n&gt;    http://www.hyrusa.com/index2.html\n&gt;    http://www.shinjin.co.jp/kuki/hyoho/index_e.html\n&gt;    http://kobe.cool.ne.jp/ikkansai/takagiryu.htm\n&gt;    http://www.hanako.co.uk/History.htm� (my web\nsite)\n&gt;\n&gt;    paul\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    --- andrea Smith &lt;andjoysmith@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    ---------------------------------\n&gt;    what&#39;s the difference between the Kukishinden Ryu\n&gt;    Kodachi and the Hon Tai Yoshin Ryu Kodachi?
