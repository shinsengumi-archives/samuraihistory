Politely put, hogwash.\n\n&gt;Thus it comes as no surprise that Japanese expert, Tsunenari Tokugawa,\n&gt;the 18th descendant of the man who started the Tokugawa period,\n&gt;believes that Pakistan can only progress if it has values and\n&gt;education two things that are essential for the growth of a nation as\n&gt;Japan has seen.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat might be true.\n\n&gt;Giving a historical account of Japan&#39;s progress, Tokugawa said that\n&gt;the Tokugawa period in Japan lasted from 1603 to 1868 during which\n&gt;time it progressed to the heights of which England had not seen.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n???  Who&#39;s better off? A Japanese peasant or a British farmer? \nEspecially later I think the answer is easy.\n\n&gt;For example, the literacy rate during this period was high-70 to 80\n&gt;percent among males and 40 to 50 percent among females. He said the\n&gt;literacy rate in most European countries and America was much lower.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nInteresting quote, how is it figured? Does it count peasants or is it \njust people, i.e. merchants and samurai... Following figures are from a \nwebsite, bs alert!\nThe situation in America roughly parallels that in England. In 1650, \nmale literacy in America was 60%. Between 1800 and 1840, literacy in the \nNorthern States increased from 75% to 90%, and in Southern States from \n60% to 81%.\n\n&gt;More than 15,000 elementary schools, besides 260 Samurai schools and\n&gt;2,000 private academies, were established all over Japan. The teaching\n&gt;system of both regular primary schools and Samurai schools was\n&gt;separate. The standard of education was very high at that time.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;ve seen Meiji textbooks, funny man.\n\n&gt;The top priority of Tukugawa Japan was its strong consensus on\n&gt;national security. There was strong sense of human equality under the\n&gt;class system also, Tokugawa explained.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nRotfl This sentence is awesome!!! My peasants love me, pull!\n\n&gt;The moral standards among the elite were high as well. He said the\n&gt;elite followed the teachings of noted Chinese philosopher, Confucius.\n&gt;Its people were environmentally conscious and no one cut down trees.\n&gt;At the most people cut branches and bark for fuel.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis guy is really so full of it that I almost can&#39;t stand it... How did \nthey rebuild Edo which had a tendency to burn down every few years.\n\n&gt;At that time, a very sophisticated market economy was flourishing in\n&gt;Japan and a large number of people were living in cities. For example,\n&gt;the population of Tokyo at that time was one million, whereas other\n&gt;important cities such as Osaka and Kyoto had a population of over\n&gt;400,000 people only.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat part is true. The rise of the great cities and the merchant class \nare the major event in this era.\n\n&gt;and after 20 years all foreign experts were sent back. \n&gt;\nNot even.\n\n&gt;During that period a huge transition took place and education at a higher level was also initiated in Japanese.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI forget which private university in the 1900s had an Anglo dean with \nthe saying like &quot;Be bold or conquer&quot; or something along those lines.\n\n&gt;&gt;From 1868 to 1945, Japan witnessed 77 years of imperial rule during\n&gt;which it fought many wars, the last being World War II, which it\n&gt;eventually lost. Still, Tokugawa said the Japanese managed to maintain\n&gt;their values.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI wonder which ones he&#39;s talking about? Post-war Japan is an actual \ndemocratic nation with a very modern outlook. Nobody has to sell their \ndaughters anymore to make ends meet.\n\n&gt;Tokugawa, nevertheless, admitted that Japan is facing some social\n&gt;problems. For example, young people do not marry, which is causing a\n&gt;huge problem for Japanese families. He also said that more than 25\n&gt;percent of the overall Japanese population is older than 65 years.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nRaising a family in a 400 square foot apartment would tend to put a \ndamper on things. A friend of mine thought Stanford had made a mistake \nand put her in married housing and we told her no, a 550 square foot \nstudio is a fairly normal size for one person in the US.\n\n&gt;Tokugawa also said that the old buildings were being demolished for\n&gt;new and modern plazas, which was a matter of serious concern.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSome of them should be demolished, they are firetraps! While I like old \nbuildings, I can sympathize with my Japanese friends who can only \nremember smelly toilets, poor lighting and heating.\n\nThanks for sharing, it was good for a few laughs. Of course press \nreleases have a tendency to be overly upbeat.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n"
