Both these books \nhave quite a lot about Takasugi Shinsaku in them, especially the Craig. To \nget more information on Shinsaku - I don&#39;t know what else to suggest \nunless you read Japanese abd can look at Japanese amazon for what \nthey&#39;ve got there. I think someone (Hide?) gave a link once before.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n\n"
