British.\nAmericans taught agriculture.\n\nThe samurai who fought=\r\n against the government in the rebellions that \nfollowed the restoration, w=\r\nere not from a single village, never controlled \nterritory or terrorized th=\r\ne Imperial Army as depicted, they fought with \nmodern weapons and they abso=\r\nlutely did not wear armour two hundred years\nout \nof date.\n\nNone of the reb=\r\nellion leaders I know of spoke English.\n\nWhite men weren&#39;t left alone with =\r\nJapanese women of the time unless they \nwere &quot;in the trade.&quot; A Japanese wom=\r\nan of the time would gouge your eyes out \nif you killed her husband, not se=\r\nrve you rice in a soup bowl. Japanese \nchildren wouldn&#39;t eat at the same ta=\r\nble as &quot;the man of the house&quot; and the \nwoman probably wouldn&#39;t even eat in =\r\nthe house, more likely in the dirt \nfloored kitchen. The actress used would=\r\n have been a giant in Meiji Japan, \nshe was far too tall and well fed to be=\r\n a nineteenth century female.\n\nNo man, not even Tom Cruise, would be allowe=\r\nd in the presence of the \nEmperor, unanounced and carrying a sword!\n\nThe tr=\r\nue last charge on which the films finale was based amounted to six \nmen, th=\r\neir leaders seppuku was conducted with a sword so dull from use that \nhis n=\r\neck looked like a stair-step.\n\nWhite Tiger!?!
