They still let those guys do Jidai Geki?? I would\nhave\nthought after KimuTaku played Oda Nobunaga, they would have been\nbanned from Jidai Geki for eternity. Or should be.&quot;\n\nI guess you hadn&#39;t heard that Kusanagi Tsuyoshi of SMAP played Toyotomi\nHideyoshi in another jidai geki this past Shogastu. This makes Nakai\nMasahiro the only member not to play jidai geki.\n\nPersonally I like the fact that they are getting younger people to play\nthese parts. Its strains credulity to watch ojisans like Kitaoji Kinya and\nMastukata Hiroki play these roles.\n\nAs per your other question whether Shinsengumi is worth watching. Well the\nfirst episode was alright. Kinda of hard to believe Kondo, Hijikata, Ryoma,\nKastura, and Sakuma Shozan going on road trip to see Kurofune. Nevertheless\nI will sit through anything with chonmage (The jidai collection is pass the\n250 mark).\n\n\n\n"
