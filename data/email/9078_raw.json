But if  anyone has any comments about the liklihood and/or \nfeasibility of women  actually passing as men (as opposed to being women who \noccasionally wear what  normally would be male accoutrements in certain situations) \nin Japanese  history -- I&#39;d like to see them.\n&gt;\n\nWhen all of the Ii clan except  for Ii Naomasa were killed by the Imagawa \nduring the 1560&#39;s, Naomasa&#39;a older  cousin Girohoshi &#39;Naotora&#39; took custody of \nhim and sheltered him in the  Ryutanji temple where she had been living. Since \nIi was far too young to take  effective leadership of the clan, Girohoshi took \non the male name &#39;Naotora&#39;  and masqueraded as a man, effectively running the \naffairs of the Ii clan from  1564-1575 when Naomasa took over (granted, this \ndidn&#39;t amount to much-just  pretty much getting Naomasa an education, training, \nand keeping him safe from  the Imagawa).\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the information. I&#39;ve heard of this, women taking on men&#39;s  names, \nwearing men&#39;s clothing, etc. when put into positions of leadership.  My \nquestion still is: Were these symbolic actions -- would a woman in  such a position \nact as a &quot;man&quot; so to speak, and yet underneath it all, everyone  knew that \nshe was a woman and knew who she actually was? Or would she actually  be able to \nbind her breasts and actually fool everyone into literally believing  that \nshe was a man? \n \nI&#39;m not an expert, but I tend to think that taking a male name, wearing  \nmen&#39;s clothing, etc. were symbolic actions -- most everyone would know what  a\nctually was going on and knew inside themselves who she was and that she was a  \nwoman. Because if she were to actually disguise herself as a man at that point  \n-- she would have to engage in &quot;identity-theft&quot; and take over the identity of \na  real, living (or recently-deceased) man. I have doubts that this sort of  \nidentity-theft could take place. \n \nHmmm. more of a movie/fiction plot, but I suppose the following scenario  \ncould happen. A strange, lone ronin wanders into a castle town, beats the pants  \noff of everyone in kenjutsu, in duels. He gets hired by the local clan, works  \nhimself up through the ranks -- mysteriously keeps himself private as far as  \ndressing, etc. (has no servant), discourages marriage proposals. Eventually  \nsomeone finds out the secret -- &quot;he&quot; is a woman!!!!\n \nSounds a lot more like a movie plot than anything that would actually have  \nhappened. \n \nComments anyone? Especially from anyone who actually is an expert?\n \nNina aka &quot;Wave Tossed&quot;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
