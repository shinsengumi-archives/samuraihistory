This means my own swords are useless.&quot; So \nsaying, he tied up his swords=\r\n and dropped them out of the \ngatehouse.\n\nAfter 10 or so days, he was convi=\r\nnced of their innocence. They \nwerew deemed unfit for service, however, and=\r\n dismissed.\n\nWhen the time came for them to leave, they approached \nMasanor=\r\ni:\n\n&quot;How unspeakably worthless did out master find us, that he \nshould put =\r\nus in the hands of one man? We must mnake him \nrealise our worth, we though=\r\nt, but if we killed you when you \nweren&#39;t even carrying your swords, he wou=\r\nld conclude we were \nworthless after all, and that pained us. So we decided=\r\n, if we were \nput to death, that weould be that.&quot;\n\n&quot;As it turned out, becau=\r\nse of your compassion we were not \ndeprived of our swords, and now we can m=\r\ningle among samurai \nonce again.&quot;\n\nI think the point here is that the self-=\r\nview of the samurai was \nperceived according to his social status, nothing =\r\nto do with any \nnotion of the &#39;sword as his soul&#39;, rather more to do with t=\r\nhe fact of \nhow the world will view a man who lets his property be taken \nf=\r\nrom him - it&#39;s a matter of pride, not virtue.\n\nSomewhere else I read of a s=\r\namurai who commented, quite \ninnocently, about the sharpness of his sword. =\r\nAnother rounded \non him angrily. &quot;How dare you! Are you suggesting that my =\r\nsword \nis not sharp?&quot; This kind of comment could easily lead to \nbloodshed,=\r\n for the most stupid reasons - too much testosterone \npumping all the time!=\r\n\n\nSaya-ate - scabbard clashing - was an insult  beyond all \napology. The on=\r\nly accceptable response was a drawn sword. \nWhy? Because it&#39;s akin to bumpi=\r\nng into someone, which means \nyou didn&#39;t even notice them.\n\nThe &#39;yahoo&#39; boy=\r\ns (especially in Edo and later) would wear their \nswords in scarlet scabbar=\r\nds that stuck out almost horizontally to \nthe side, and then try and clash =\r\nwith someone. The wise heads, \nwho wore their swords facing as near as poss=\r\nible forward, so \nthe scabbard sticks out behind, could grasp the guard, an=\r\nd in a \ntwisting motion lift it to the shoulder, so the sword runs parallel=\r\n \nto, and very close to, the body, thus avoiding the contact.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"
