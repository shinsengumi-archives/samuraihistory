The=\r\nre is a chance within the next 6 weeks that it \nwill get put together into =\r\na giant online database, but that is still \nsort of up in the air.  For the=\r\n moment, here is info on Otani \nYoshitsugu:\n\nYoshitsugu&#39;s origins are uncle=\r\nar but one theory holds that \nYoshitsugu&#39;s family were former retainers of =\r\nthe =D4tomo family of \nBungo Province. He was recommended to Toyotomi Hidey=\r\noshi (possibly by \nthe young Ishida Mitsunari) around 1574 and quickly rose=\r\n through the \nranks. He attacked Takigawa Kazumasu in the 1583 Shizugatake =\r\nCampaign \nand afterwards, follwing Hideyoshi&#39;s defeat of Shibata Katsuie, w=\r\nas \ngiven Tsuruga in Echizen Province. He assisted in the logistical \naspec=\r\nts of Hideyoshi&#39;s 1587 invasion of Kyushu and was present for \nthe siege of=\r\n Odawara Castle in 1590. He was later dispatched to the \nnorthern provinces=\r\n as a land survey officer, though his activities \nduring the 1590&#39;s are oth=\r\nerwise obscure, possibly due to a worsening \ncase of leprosy he was sufferi=\r\nng from by this point. While in the \nnorth he was forced to quell the resis=\r\ntance of Onodera Yasumichi in \n1599, whose castle of =D4mori Yoshitsugu bes=\r\nieged. In 1600 he at first \nthought of joining Tokugawa Ieyasu&#39;s side in th=\r\ne coming war but was \nconvinced by Ishida Mitsunari to follow the latter in=\r\nstead. Though \nsuffering from now-advanced leprosy, he joined the &#39;western&#39;=\r\n forces \non the battlefield at Sekigahara and directed his troops from with=\r\nin \na palanquin. After the defection of Kobayakawa Hideaki to Tokugawa \nIey=\r\nasu&#39;s side, he ordered a retainer to cut off his head and spirit \nit away. =\r\nHis daughter was married to Sanada Yukimura.\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; http://www.samurai-archives.co=\r\nm/searchst.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this listing any help?\n&gt; -t\n\n\n"
