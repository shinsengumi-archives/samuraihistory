This of course influenced the development of armor, \nand yes, most Japanese weaponry is two-handed. But plenty of other \nhorse-mobile warrior cultures did use shields of one sort or another, \nin addition to bows. \n\nIn the case of the Japanese, shields are conspicuous in their \nabsence. With shield-using Korean and Chinese neighbors, it almost \nseems like a rejection of shields. \n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Have you never noticed that Japanese weapons tend to be weapons \nthat \n&gt; require the use of BOTH hands?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; Anthony J.
