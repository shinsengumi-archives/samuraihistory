There are som=\r\ne exceptions : the Shimazu, shugo of Satsuma and =C3=94sumi, the Takeda, sh=\r\nugo of Kai or the Imagawa, shugo of Suruga\nTo take another example : Etch=\r\n=C3=BB and Noto are officially under two members (shugo) of the Hatakeyama =\r\nfamily but, in fact, the first province is splitted between various vassals=\r\n of the Hatakeyama among which the leading familiers are the Jimb=C3=B4 and=\r\n the Shiina.
