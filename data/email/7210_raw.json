(http://\n&lt;http://&gt;  \n &gt; www.ency-japan.com) Some universities subscribe to it, so students  \n &gt; can access it for free. perhaps, some of the members of this ML might\n\n &gt; want to consider a &quot;group&quot; subscription.\n &gt; \n &gt; Or else, here is another criminal idea, in the name of culture: since\n\n &gt; the encyclopedia has a free 30 days trial, every month a different  \n &gt; member of this list should go for that, and share with the others.\n &gt; \n &gt; Not sure if it takes your I.P to let you connect, but i doubt it.\n &gt; Well, one day to find out it would be to try!!\n \nCepo, our devious minds think alike! I found this website earlier too\nand \nlooked at the 30-day sign-up, however it&#39;s not quite as simple as just \nputting an e-mail address and PRESTO you have a username and password.\nAmong \nthe details you need to submit are an  &#39;Institution name&#39; (and I don&#39;t\nthink \n&#39;Samurai History Forum&#39; will cut it!) as well as &#39;Insitution IP\nAddress&#39;. \nBut hey, you&#39;ve got to give them some points for looking like they are\ncluey \nenough to lock down on activities like we both managed to plot in our\nheads!\n \nAngus\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged, and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient.
