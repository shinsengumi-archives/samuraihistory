His books are cheap and full of plenty\nof basic man on the street style info.\n\nI am sorry but I think a lot of the attacks on him are\njealous because he is out there knocking the info out\nand making moneyout of it. I am on several lists and\napart form one or two names that have a dig at him I\ncant find anything published by the others who\ncomplain. If you can do better then do it. Just think\nof how many who are interested in Japanese history\nwouldnt be with out Turnbull\n\nI will add however that his ninja books are crap and\nso full of bad informatiion I was amazed he actually\nput some of the stuff in them which he did\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n--- Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt; wrote:\n\n---------------------------------\nPersonally I like his books and I credit him with\nturning me on to this subject many years ago with his\nbook,\nSamurai a Military History. It is a nice big thick\nbook with a fair bit of information in it, his best\none I think.\n\nregards\nDave Jackson\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: cepooooo \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, October 25, 2003 5:51 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] An opinion on Stephen\nTurnbull&#39;s work\n\n\n  After studying premodern Japanese history for a few\nyears through the texts of the \n  classic American historians (Keene, Varley, Hall,\netc.), I finally got me a couple of \n  books from Stephen Turnbull. While he is not\nassociated with any great University, his \n  work seems to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is\nnot an amazing writer ( imean; his \n  style), but he seems to be truly in love with the\nsubject, and I really like the way he \n  fills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind\nof (perhaps?) self-made scholarship \n  is available.\n  Since this is the first time I write, I was\nwondering what you &quot;samurai-maniacs&quot; public \n  think of Turnbull in general.\n  Any book you would suggest in particular?\n  Thanx,\n  cepo\n\n\n        Yahoo!
