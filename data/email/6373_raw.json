One of the things we love about him.)\nIf the spirit of the film were moderately accurate, he might be inclined to\nmake allowances.  Let me put this another way:  do you actually _like_\nmovies that distort history and strain - or defy - credibility?\nGereg\n\n   Date: Fri, 17 Dec 2004 06:03:44 -0800 (PST)\n   From: Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: The Last Samurai, the movie.\n\n\nAll brain no heart.\n\nAnthony Bryant &lt;ajbryant@...&gt; wrote:mark kd wrote:\n\n&gt; if you buy the movie book(or just go to your local book store and look at\n&gt; it), it will tell you what is accurate and what is not(to some extent).
