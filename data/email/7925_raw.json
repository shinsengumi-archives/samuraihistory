Though I \npersonally don&#39;t see it as &quot;entertainment&quot; but we&#39;re probably just talking \nsemantics here.]\n\n&gt; I agree with one of the other posters that in this regard, films are best \n&gt; used as &#39;jumping off points&#39; to inspire someone to conduct further research.\n\nThat&#39;s exactly the point I was trying to make. And probably was not very \nclear about it. Which actually is the reason why I see SEPPUKU as more than just \n&quot;entertainment.&quot; It certainly isn&#39;t claiming to be a depiction of exact \nhistory. It&#39;s not saying that, in real life, there truly existed a ronin named \nTsugumo Hanshiro who avenged the death of his son-in-law Chijiiwa Motome by taking \nseveral top-knots and slaying several other members of the Ii clan. \n\nThere are some points of entertainment. I also loved the part where Tsugumo \ntosses the topknots at the Ii clan, and loved their shocked reaction. But \nunlike most &quot;noble ronin&quot; chambara films (which I LOVE, by the way), SEPPUKU goes a \nlot further. I don&#39;t get that &quot;jumping off&quot; inspiration to study real history \nwhen watching most of the chambara/jidai-geki films that I watch.   \n\nSEPPUKU goes way beyond just &quot;noble ronin&quot; entertainment. It has raised \nissues. It has made me want to do actual historical research. It was a &quot;jumping \noff&quot; point. And in that way, it has value to me as a tool for studying history. \n\nI hope I&#39;m making myself a bit more clearer than mud.  :)\n\nNina\n\n"
