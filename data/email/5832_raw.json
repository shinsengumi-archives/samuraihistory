One (or more) layers of really heavy paper were laid \ndown over a form and lacquered to within an inch of their lives. I&#39;ve seen some \nreally impressive modern jingasa made in that way where the &quot;core&quot; is just a \nsingle layer of what amounts to posterboard glued into shape (e.g., either a \nsingle piece that&#39;s rolled into a cone and secured with glue or staples [!], or \nseveral pie-wedge shapes likewise attached, and then lacquered with eight or ten \nlayers of lacquer. These things end up about 1/4&quot; thick or more, and are hard as \na rock.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
