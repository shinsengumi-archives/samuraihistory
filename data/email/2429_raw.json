I compared and contrasted the samurai with the english knight. The samurai were not only interested in gaining notoriety through battle and conquest, but also in beautifing their life through the arts. Where as the english knights were just interested in fame, glory and riches.. there are many other similarities and differences that you could work on too.. such as bushido and chivalry..etc.. hope that gives you some ideas...\n\n\nWilson\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nEnter now for a chance to win a 42&quot; Plasma Television!\nhttp://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;6413623;3807821;f?http://mocda1.com/1/c/563632/113422/313631/313631\nAOL users go here: http://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;6413623;3807821;f?http://mocda1.com/1/c/563632/113422/313631/313631\nThis offer applies to U.S. Residents Only\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
