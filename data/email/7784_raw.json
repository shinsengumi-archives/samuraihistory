The genre is \ncompletely open from comedy to sci-fi.\n\nParameters: \n\nThe story is required to be more than 1,000 words, with a 5,000 word \ntargeted limit - overages are acceptable. It can be done in the \nfirst person, or the third person, and must be a complete short \nstory, not an excerpt from a larger story. The genre(s) must be \nlisted at the top of the story above the title - one genre or a \ncombination of two genres are acceptable. Although the particular \ngenre will not affect judging, all entrants are required to make \nsure that their story falls within their chosen genre(s).\n\nFurther Info:\n\nThe entrance fee is $10 - the winner will receive the combined total \nof all entrance fees minus 5% to conver the paypal fees, therefore, \nthe more entrants, the larger the payoff for the winner.\n\n2005 Samurai Fiction Winner:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/sdg.html\n\nTimeline:\n\nDeadline for entrance fee: 3/28/2006 \nDeadline for fiction submission: 4/01/2006\nJudging starts: 4/05/2006\nJudging ends: 4/15/2006\nWinner to be Announced at or before: 4/17/2006 \n\nTimelines are subject to change. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
