Then this sparked off a load of non Japanese related \nhistory.  Which is interesting as it shows how inter related all \nhistory is.  \n\n        I am interested in the warring states periods of china and \nJapan, recently I read the romance of the three kingdoms which \nhighlights how destructive and the scale of warfare was at this \ntime.  Mostly I \ndo read academic books like Friday, Farell, Owen, etc.  \n        \n        But Sometimes these books go so far into the detail of the \nperiod I lose sight of the big picture, forgetting that as Japan was \ninvolved in the Sengoku Jidai the rest of the world was forming it&#39;s \nown bounderies.  \n\n        This got me thinking of another question slightly off topic \nbut I am following the flow of this debate.  The question is the \ninternal wars of Japan and China helped to form it&#39;s identity and \nit&#39;s position in the world today, it was probably a very neccesary \nthing.  But my problem is theoretically how much stronger would Japan \nhave been without these internal wars?.\n\n       I mean the Kamakura shogunate was succesful but it had to \ncontend with Kublai Khan and Japan was not as well developed as it \nwas by say 1530.  Can you imagine if the daimyo&#39;s all got on \n(actually immposible) but if they all worked together it would be an \nincredible power.  If china was united throughout it&#39;s history too \nwhat would that have done to the boundaries of the world today.  I am \nonly theorizing but it is obvious that wars are part of human \nsociety.  But if those wars had only been external (invasions etc) \n(like Hideyoshi Korea) I \nwonder how much stronger the samurai as a class would have been.  \nPerhaps the Sengoku Jidai enabled Ieyasu to come to power and hold \nit, but it also inevitably made Japan stronger but in contradiction \nless able to deal with the Black ships when they arrived.  I \ncertainly am not descrediting the Bushi just stating a point.  \n\nAnyone wanna comment.  I have loads more research to do. \nThanks Mark  \n\n\n\n"
