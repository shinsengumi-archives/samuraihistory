Just as for swo=\r\nrds that require a specialist knowledge of readings I&#39;m sure the same is tr=\r\nue for bows and that whole specialised area of kyudo.  I have a mate who is=\r\n &quot;into&quot; this kind of object and I&#39;ll run it past him.  I&#39;ve made a note of =\r\nyour post, the replies and saved your images and while I won&#39;t forget it is=\r\n likely to take a while to find the right &quot;Round Tuit&quot;!!!  Like Tom, I imme=\r\ndiately thought of seal characters and I do have Hawley&#39;s chart on this scr=\r\nipt - somewhere - but as Tom says the real meaning is more likely locked in=\r\n the time and place of the culture that made the bow, rather than in a lite=\r\nral translation of the characters.\nBest regards,\nBarry Thomas.\n\n  ----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- \n  From: Tom Helm \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n  Sent: Sunday, October 12, 2008 4:58 PM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] =\r\nYumi\n\n\n  Travis -\n  Two problems here; One is the handwriting is pretty poo=\r\nr on the \n  &quot;name plate&quot; and the other is it looks like Seal Script is bein=\r\ng used \n  for the lacquered name. The &quot;name plate&quot; says something TA HISA- =\r\nand \n  the next kanji could be read kazu, shige, tada, mitsu, or tomi. The =\r\n\n  first something is illegible and the fourth character can be read \n  man=\r\ny different ways, so this is likely a name but I can see how \n  people woul=\r\nd be unable or unwilling to posit a definitive reading.\n  As for the seal s=\r\ncript the second character looks to be Hatake (=E7=95=A0) \n  =E3=80=80not s=\r\nure what the first is. I don&#39;t have a good reference for this \n  kind of sc=\r\nript. Would love to have recommendations if anybody on this \n  list knows o=\r\nf a good book for translating seal script BTW. Even with \n  the references =\r\navailable, since this is very stylized there may not \n  be a one to one tra=\r\nnslation that is clearly what the original writer \n  had in mind. Adding to=\r\n the problem is the fact that the Japanese love \n  wordplay, if they are ab=\r\nle to identify the characters they may be \n  nonsense to us but to a person=\r\n of the Edo period would be an \n  instantly recognizable name or punchline.=\r\n\n  I am just dumb enough to speculate on this while I suspect the \n  author=\r\nities you have spoken to are too smart to offer any kind of \n  answer unles=\r\ns they are absolutely sure and that is most likely why \n  they didn&#39;t give =\r\nyou a name.\n  Tom Helm\n  toryu@...\n  &quot;Moriamur, et in media arma =\r\nruamus&quot;\n  - Vergil\n\n  On Oct 10, 2008, at 2:18 AM, Travis Good wrote:\n\n  &gt; =\r\nI have an old yumi and I need help in translating its name.
