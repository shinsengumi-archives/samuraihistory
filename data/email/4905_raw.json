I cant \nfind anything on that particular subject.my email is also \nyoda1100@l... I have two.\n\n\nHi Josh -  A good start might be D.T. Suzuki&#39;s  &quot;Zen and \nJapanese Culture&quot; and Eugen Herrigel&#39;s &quot;Zen in the Art of \nArchery&quot;. Both books are a bit old but regarded as classics. You \nmight also want to check out Philip Kapleau&#39;s &quot;Three Pillers of \nZen&quot; which is a much beloved primer in the West.\n\nIf you live near an urban area, you might want to check and see if \nthere is a Japanese tea ceremony group in town. Personally, I \nthink you might get a deeper understanding of Zen by practicing \nchado - i.e., The Way (do) of Tea (cha) than simply reading a \nbook on it..\n\nIn &quot;Zen and Japanese Culture&quot;, Suzuki  - in addition to such \nchapters as &quot;Zen and the Samurai&quot;, &quot;Zen and Swordmanship&quot; - \nhas two chapters devoted to Zen and the Art of Tea and also a \nseparate chapter on &quot;Sen no Rikyu&quot;  the legendary Sengoku-jidai \ntea master. The Japanese film director, Teshigahara Hiroshi&#39;s \ncritically acclaimed movie &quot;Rikyu&quot; is based on the relationship \nbetween Sen no Rikyu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi...\n\nGood luck! It&#39;s impossible to get into this &quot;stuff&quot; without a good \ngrounding in Zen, isn&#39;t it? :-)\n\n-ryhorikawa\n\n\n"
