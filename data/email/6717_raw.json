You know, the whole feudal \n&gt;&gt; pyramid structure with a daimyo at the top? Simply looking at the \n&gt;&gt; dictionaries seems to indicate &#39;batsu&#39; but I would like some\n&gt;&gt; confirmation on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Where do you get &quot;batsu&quot;? I can think of a number of\n&gt; meanings for &quot;batsu&quot; (X being one of them) but clan\n&gt; isn&#39;t one of them. Most places I&#39;ve seen &quot;uji&quot; Ž.\n\n   My guess is that he&#39;s thinking of 閥 (batsu; meaning clique, clan, \nfaction).\n\n   I&#39;m not sure about specific Sengoku-era usage, but my Japanese books \non Sengoku history tend to favour &quot;-shi&quot; (氏: uji, shi) as a suffix \nappended to the family name of the head of the clan. I also see &quot;-ke&quot; \n(家: ie, ya, uchi, ka, ke) and occasionally &quot;ichizoku&quot; (一族) or the \n&quot;-zoku&quot; part thereof used as a suffix, and even more rarely &quot;ichimon&quot; \n(一門), but I&#39;d be hard pressed to identify the subtle distinctions \nthose might have carried during the relevant time period.\n\n   The question, however, doesn&#39;t provide sufficient context to provide \nan accurate answer.\n\nPhil\n\n\n\n\n"
