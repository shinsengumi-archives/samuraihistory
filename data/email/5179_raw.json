Presumably \nTakeda &#39;ninja&#39; were working the subversion operation, and \nTokugawa &#39;ninja&#39; were working counter-insurgency? Or am I \nbeing over-romantic?\n\nSuch being the case, the Tokugawa managed to manouvre the \nTakeda into overplaying their hand, as it were, which might be \ncounted as a highly successful ninja operation, based on sound \nintelligence rather than assassinations, wall-climbings, etc.\n\nLikewise the eventual seppuku of Tokugawa Hideyasu was \nbrought about by a &#39;plot&#39; that was believed unlikely (by Sadler, \nanyway), but was considered a necessary expedient by Ieyasu to \nsecure the Oda-Tokugawa alliance. Might this not have been a \nplot to destabilise the two, and where would history have gone \nif they had fought each other?\n\nAgain, as Paul pointed out an age ago (hi Paul) there&#39;s a scene \nin Kagemusha where 3 peasants (in the employ of the Oda and \nthe Tokugawa) are watching &#39;Shingen&#39; review his troops and are \nconvinced it is he, which is the report that goes back to HQ.\n\nNo doubt Hollywood would have them attempt to assassinate \nShingen with blow darts, exploding geisha, or something of that \nilk.\n\nThomas.\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
