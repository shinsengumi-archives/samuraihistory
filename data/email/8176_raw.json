I&#39;m doing family genealogy research and \nwill be =\r\nglad to share any relevant findings.  I recently had a 30-\nyear old family =\r\nletter translated between my Japanese aunt and her \nsister (my deceased mot=\r\nher).  I only speak English.  My great-great-\ngrandfather was a Hatamoto Sa=\r\nmurai who had a rank/reward/status of \n1500 koku.  The family name is Shima=\r\nda.  His given name is Sugo.  \nHis other name(perhaps imani?) is Naoaki.  I=\r\n have independently \nconfirmed all the kanji characters in the name transla=\r\ntion \nexcept &quot;Sugo&quot;.  The first kanji is &quot;su&quot;, but the second one (&quot;go&quot;) \ni=\r\ns the best guess of the translator.  Sugo Shimada served in the \nearly 1800=\r\n&#39;s in the Edo (Tokyo) area, likely in/near Honjo.  He had \na son (Nobushi N=\r\naoharu Shimada) born in 1858, who served under \nGeneral Nogi.\n\nMy questions=\r\n are:\n1.  What additional resources (beyond this very helpful site) are \nre=\r\ncommended for this type of researching?  I&#39;ve done extensive web \nbrowsing =\r\nand have begun to get some books.\n2.  Today, Shimada is a relatively common=\r\n surname in Japan.  In the \nSamurai days, was there only one Shimada clan, =\r\nor perhaps one \nShimada clan per city/area?  I don&#39;t know how unique the na=\r\nme was \nduring the Samaurai period.  I have read that this surname is \ncont=\r\nained in ancient Japanese family name records.  If there is any \nSamurai hi=\r\nstory about the Shimada family, and if there is some sort \nof connection be=\r\ntween &quot;those&quot; Shimada&#39;s and my family, I would love \nto learn about it.\n3. =\r\n Is there a kamon associated with the Shimada family/clan?  Where \nmight I =\r\nlook for a copy of it?  I have not found it among the \nsamurai-archives and=\r\n other helpful web sites.\n4.  Can someone confirm what the second names (Na=\r\noaki and Naoharu) \ntypically represent for Samurai, especially in a society=\r\n where many \nhad only one or two names at that time?  Were their names asso=\r\nciated \nwith the Samurai coming of age ceremony, or perhaps names given to =\r\n\nthem after their deaths?  I&#39;m just not clear about that.\n5.  Can a tell an=\r\nything about the status in society (or other \nthings) of Sugo Shimada as a =\r\nHatamoto in the Edo area with 1500 \nkoku?  Whatever they possessed (and it =\r\nappeared to have been much), \nsurvived the Meiji restoration, but did not s=\r\nurvive the US strategic \nbombing campaign during WWII.  The surviving famil=\r\ny members were \nback to &quot;ground zero&quot; in 1945.\n\nAny perspectives would be g=\r\nreatly appreciated,\n\nDave Cain\nCincinnati, Ohio, USA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
