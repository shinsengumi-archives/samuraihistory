Even pilots carried Katanas. \n&gt;\n&gt;Michael Lorimer &lt;mijalo_jp@...&gt; wrote:In regard to whether the WW2 officers in the Imperial Army considered themselves &#39;samurai&#39;, I would like to add a specific example of my neighbour in Hiroshima. Over rather a few tokkuri of warm sake in recent months he has been regaling me with stories of when he served in Manchuria, much as my grandfather did with his stories from North Africa, Italy, the Middle East and India. He clearly found that while officers were more than often not of samurai stock, but considered themselves the successors of that class, perhaps in a similar manner to which many yakuza consider themselves modern samurai.\n&gt;So why did they carry swords? Why do officers in many officers around the world carry swords? If you view the photographs of the carnage on the Western Front during WW1 you will still see officers leading their troops sword in hand. Why? Distinction.  Still, the officer has to be seen as superior to his/her men/women (not to be accused of sexism) and the sword is an obvious symbol universally of such a principle.  A man with a sword has always ranked higher than one with a spear or musket.\n&gt;M.Lorimer \n&gt;\n&gt;Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt;\n&gt;On Feb 5, 2004, at 10:54 AM, Josh Wilson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tony, not to dispute you, but why was your response about the officers \n&gt;&gt; considering themselves samurai incorrect?? In WWI, the cavalry still \n&gt;&gt; consisted of horses, but by WWII, the cavalry was tanks and such.. if \n&gt;&gt; yor in a tank w/ a biiiiiiiiig cannon on the front, whats the point of \n&gt;&gt; a sword?? hence why the sword became a dress item, it no longer had a \n&gt;&gt; functional purpose.. However I have seen many pictures in textbooks \n&gt;&gt; and on the history channel and such showing the Japanese at prison \n&gt;&gt; camps using the swords to behead POWs.. I also heard on the history \n&gt;&gt; channel that they did consider themselves samurai, even tho they knew \n&gt;&gt; they werent.. So I jsut wondered what else you had to say about the \n&gt;&gt; subject and where you got your info.. I am, unfortunately, notorious \n&gt;&gt; for not having specific referrences, sorry I cant supply any..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Wilson\n&gt;\n&gt;I am taking a graduate seminar on Modern Japanese history, and I am \n&gt;sure the above will be a big issue for discussion.
