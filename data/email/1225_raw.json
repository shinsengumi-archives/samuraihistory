More than simply a defender of the homestead in time \nof necessity, she is described as a warrior of peerless skill, going \ninto battle like a man. She was either the wife of Minamoto Yoshinaka, \nor by some sources a female attendant, but in either case is described \nas one of Yoshinaka&#39;s senior captains. Yoshinaka was one of the Minamoto \nlords who fought against the Taira in the Gempei War, and after the \nMinomoto victory at Kurikawa in 1084 placed Kyoto in Minamoto hands, \nYoshinaka felt that he should become the overall leader of the clan.\n\nYoshinaka&#39;s feeling was contested by Minamoto Yoritomo. Yorimoto&#39;s \nforces attacked Yoshinkaka and Gozen at Awazu, and despite putting up a \ntremendous fight, their forces were overwhelmed. With only a handful of \nwarriors standing, Yoshinaka ordered his wife to flee the field rather \nthan face capture and death. Accounts vary of what followed. Some say \nthat Gozen stayed and died with her husband, while others state that she \nfled the battlefield. In the latter instance, there is further \nuncertainty. Most accounts state that she fled with a severed head, but \nagain sources vary between claiming that she took the head of an enemy \nsoldier named Onda no Hachiro Moroshige, or that of her husband taken to \nkeep him from capture. A final debate surrounds the fate of Gozen after \nher escape, as some state that she cast herself into the sea with her \nhusband&#39;s head, while others assert that she became a nun.\n\n\n\nCharisse Linsangan wrote:\n\n&gt; I have a question.
