The tachi evolved into the blade down, \ncavalry sword worn by emperors and generals in the late Heian / early \nKamakura period. There is some debate about the dating and the \nreasons for it assuming the shape it did. I still agree with the idea \nthat it was developed as a cavalry weapon. Chinese and Korean \nstraight bladed swords that came to Japan in earlier times were worn \n&quot;slung&quot; from the belt and this custom was followed with the Japanese \ntachi that developed from them. I don&#39;t think the edge down sword was \nsomething &quot;new&quot; that was found to aid a mounted warrior.\n\tIn the earliest days there was little distinction between \ncourtier and warrior, but by the Kamakura period there was a distinct \nwarrior class. The tachi they wore were heavier and less ornate than \nthe Kazari-tachi worn at court. While we think of better swords and \nkoshirae in the &quot;tachi&quot; class there were in fact many &quot;workin-man&#39;s&quot; \ntachi with plain iron fittings and leather wrapped tsuka and saya.\n\tWhile mounted combat gave way to large scale infantry \nbattles, generals and cavlry units continued to wear the tachi as \nside arm. &quot;Fighting&quot; tachi were worn right up until the end of the \nSengoku Jidai and High ranking persons wore tachi right up until the \nMeiji Restoration. What your sword will llok like will depend on what \nperiod you want to recreate. I am happy to help if I can,\nTom\n(obviously the sword nut...)\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
