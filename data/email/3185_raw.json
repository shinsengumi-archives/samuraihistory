I&#39;m learning just as\nyou are and this is what I have discovered thus far.\nThe early Japanese bushi used the spear(yari) and\nbow(yumi) as his main weapons of choice. The sword or\nkatana developed into his weapon of choice in later\nperiods. Especially when the military class was\ngaining more and more power(Kamakura Shogunate). Note,\nthis is just a general over view.\n\nNow for a good book on Japanese sword techniques I\nrecommend &quot;Secrets of the Samurai&quot; by Oscar Ratti and\nAdele Westbrook. This is a very good book and it gives\nallot of information on Bujutsu as a whole from\nsamurai to ashigaru to sohei.\n\nAlso Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s book &quot;The Book of the Five\nRings&quot; is dedicated not just to strategy but to the\nway of the sword and Musashi&#39;s style of kenjutsu.\n\nI&#39;m currently researching the Shimazu Clan and samurai\nof Satsuma in southern Kyushu. They were well known\nfor their bravery and ferocity in combat. These\nsamurai were great swordsmen as well and so as part of\nmy research I would love to discover their fighting\ntechniques.\n\nAlso besides the Katana another sword popular with\nsamurai was the No-dachi or field sword. This was more\nor less a two handed sword and in the hands of a well\ntrained samurai proved quite deadly.\n\nHope this helps. Let me know what you find.\n\nJake\n--- Christin Agustini &lt;qunyux@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m curious all about japanese sword, when did it\n&gt; begin, is it still being used? I like bushido, what\n&gt; bushido which uses sword as its main device? Is\n&gt; there anyone mastered in Battojutsu? Can we\n&gt; communicate because I want to know more about it?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerly,\n&gt; \n&gt; Christin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
