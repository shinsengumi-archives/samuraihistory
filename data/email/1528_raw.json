Salvador&quot; &lt;musashi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Andrea,\n&gt; You should check out the book &quot;Legends of the\n&gt; Samurai&quot; by Hiroaki Sato. \n&gt; It&#39;s a great read, but most of the happenings in it\n&gt; are more realistic \n&gt; than fantasy. Definately a good start. Also, head\n&gt; out to Barnes and \n&gt; Noble (or Amazon) and check the mythology section\n&gt; for books like \n&gt; &quot;Japanese Fairy Tales&quot; by Keiske Nishimoto and other\n&gt; such books. A \n&gt; little study of Shinto will reveal some interesting\n&gt; Japanese tales as well.\n&gt; _Joe\n&gt; \n&gt; ps - be sure to check out the &quot;kappa&quot;\n&gt; turtle-demon!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Andrea Smith wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hey, I put my mind into what I&#39;m writing and now I\n&gt; &gt;need some help with Japanese legends, I live in the\n&gt; &gt;real world but my mind wanders into the fantasy.\n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;writing a samurai legend and I&#39;m still looking on\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;Internet and I can&#39;t find what I&#39;m looking for,\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt;there samurai that had legends written about them?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
