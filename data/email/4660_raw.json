It was also called the Kotetsu when it\nwas first acquired as a \nTokugawa ship.  I have been researching this ship for\nabout a year now, \nthough not as well as I possibly could considering my\nlack of being about to \nread Japanese (yet).  If you know anything about this\nship please let me \nknow.  I would love to talk with you about it and swap\nnotes.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMake the most of your family vacation with tips from\nthe MSN Family Travel \nGuide! http://dollar.msn.com\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
