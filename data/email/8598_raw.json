It really is a kind of rank. It is also a job.\n\nSigh. Etymology is irrelevant.  I&#39;m talking about the job.\nWould it make any difference if I said &quot;the cook outranks\nthe busboy,&quot; or are you going to find something from the\ndictionary for that?\n\n&gt;  &gt;  A taicho (lit. &quot;group-chief&quot;) can have five people or 50\n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds like a bit of wandering there. \u001b$BBbD9\u001b(B taichou is the leader of a\n&gt; military formation called a \u001b$BBb\u001b(B TAI. It is also a modern word.\n\nTell that to all those sengoku guys who were &quot;ashigaru\ntaicho,&quot; and &quot;teppo taicho,&quot; and &quot;yumitori taicho&quot;...\n\n&gt;  &gt;  In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and  duties are held\n&gt;  &gt; at the pleasure of the overlord in question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not quite so simple. A medieval unit commander can &quot;own&quot; his unit and\n&gt; owe service to his overlord. Medieval commanders did not have quite the\n&gt; personnel reassignment capability as that of a modern army. Regardless,\n&gt; what was going on in Japan can be quite complex having to do with shiki\n&gt; rights, parallel rank and appointment systems, and all sorts of other\n&gt; stuff.\n\nAnd how does ANY of that change the facts as I&#39;ve stated them?\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
