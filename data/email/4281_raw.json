They suggested habotai and silk taffeta. \nMy question is, when I went to www.silkconnection.com, they had all \nkinds of weights for these two. They also mentioned that Habotai was \ngood for scarves and lining, which sounded kind of odd to me since I \nwouldn&#39;t classify armor clothing and scarves together. Can anyone \ninform me if Habotai is in fact a good idea, and if so, what weight \nI should try and buy it in? Mucho domo in advance.\n\n\n"
