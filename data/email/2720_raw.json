I have a question about samurai movies.  Have \nthere been any movies made about the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877?\n\n    I just saw &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; today and I enjoyed it very much, despite \nthe historical liberties that were taken.  But I was wondering if anyone in \nJapan has made a more historically accurate movie about that period?\n\nBob Burke\n\n\nIn a message dated 12/7/03 9:46:51 AM, kyosuke_miyamoto@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; Hello Everyone, Im Kyosuke. I&#39;m new to the forum and all, but I know \n\na great lot about samurai, weapons, and ancient japan. I myself, \n\nfollow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real life Samurai, though \n\nSamurai&#39;s have been outlawed since the late 1800&#39;s, I still consider \n\nmyself one. I&#39;ve been to Japan, and studied the fighting skills from \n\nSensei Ichi Hayamatsu, learned the old culture and the respects. And \n\nwith this, I&#39;ve become a Samurai. I want to be the one to say how Im \n\nhonored in joining this forum, and expect a lot of great stuff from \n\nyou all as well. \n\n\nThat is all.\n\n-Kyosuke Miyamoto\n\n\nP.S. Im also A fanatic of old Samurai Movies. If you&#39;d like we can \n\ntalk of them.\n\n\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
