Though you \nget points for not owning a car.\n\n&gt;i strongly believe in the way of the samurai\n&gt;and i choose to be a true samurai no matter what i\n&gt;must do, the way of a samurai in which i have\n&gt;attempted has made me feel a like i found were i\n&gt;belong and it means more to me than anything else in\n&gt;all of which ive learned in life.\n&gt;\nYou do realize that for most of history that samurai were \nwarrior/soldiers that basically killed for their lords and later on were \nused to oppress the commoners. If that&#39;s something you think is cool, \nwell hmmmmm. You may want to study up on Confucius/Zen/etc. Otherwise I \nsuspect you will find this list of little use since we are interested in \nhistory and except for a few weekend play samurai I doubt that anybody \nhere has your goal of being a samurai.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"
