Although, the information was rather basic. That is available on DVD in  a 3-part series, and I believe all the HC documentaries are available  for purchase on their site or can be ordered through Border&#39;s. They can  be expensive though.\n  \n  Jonathan \n\nMichael Peters &lt;shdwstel@...&gt; wrote:             I caught (most of) a reasonably well done documentary on the history \n  channel on the samurai Saturday night. Nowadays, the drek that is fed people \n  on TLC, THC, and National Geographic makes me cringe. Even when they do have \n  knowledgeable people giving them information, the producers tend to feed the \n  myths rather than rely on research. I spent the better part of 2 hours \n  watching without having to cry *bull$hit* once. I was greatly surprised. It \n  did seem to me that I had seen a lot of this footage previously in shows \n  where I DID cry bull$hit. It&#39;s almost as if their consultants sat down with \n  them and actually cross checked everything before release. Kind of a \n  historian&#39;s cut. It seemed that Conlan and Friday had a lot more influence \n  on this one.\n  \n    The title was The Samurai which of course makes it easy to differentiate \n  from other documentaries about samurai. :)\n  \n  Michael\n  \n  _________________________________________________________________\n  FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \n  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n  \n  \n  \n            \n\n    ---\n  Join the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\n  http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n  \n  Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n  Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n  ---  \n\n                      \n\n          SPONSORED LINKS    \n                                                        Samurai                                          Japan                                          Japan airline                                                                             \n        \n---------------------------------\n    YAHOO!
