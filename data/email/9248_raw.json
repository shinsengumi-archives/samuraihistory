I am wondering if &quot;Amada&quot; is a different (or  \nwrong) reading of the characters that are usually read as &quot;Shunshin.&quot;\nAnyway, at this point I would be curious as well to know about the  \nseveral books and battles you mentioned...\n\ncepo\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
