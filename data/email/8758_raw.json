Only &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;. Show me one o=\r\nther\nreference that says &quot;Sword&quot;.  \n\n&quot;All the Heavenly deities summoned the=\r\n two divine beings, Izanagi and\nIzanami, and bade them descend to the nebul=\r\nous place, and by helping\neach other, to consolidate it into terra firma. &quot;=\r\nWe bestow on you,&quot;\nthey said, &quot;this precious treasure, with which to rule t=\r\nhe land, the\ncreation of which we command you to perform.&quot; So saying they h=\r\nanded\nthem a spear called Ama-no-Nuboko, embellished with costly gems. The\n=\r\ndivine couple received respectfully and ceremoniously the sacred\nweapon and=\r\n then withdrew from the presence of the Deities, ready to\nperform their aug=\r\nust commission. Proceeding forthwith to the Floating\nBridge of Heaven, whic=\r\nh lay between the heaven and the earth, they\nstood awhile to gaze on that w=\r\nhich lay below. What they beheld was a\nworld not yet condensed, but looking=\r\n like a sea of filmy fog floating\nto and fro in the air, exhaling the while=\r\n an inexpressibly fragrant\nodor. They were, at first, perplexed just how an=\r\nd where to start, but\nat length Izanagi suggested to his companion that the=\r\ny should try the\neffect of stirring up the brine with their spear. So sayin=\r\ng he pushed\ndown the jeweled shaft and found that it touched something. The=\r\nn\ndrawing it up, he examined it and observed that the great drops which\nfel=\r\nl from it almost immediately coagulated into an island, which is,\nto this d=\r\nay, the Island of Onokoro. Delighted at the result, the two\ndeities descend=\r\ned forthwith from the Floating Bridge to reach the\nmiraculously created isl=\r\nand. In this island they thenceforth dwelt and\nmade it the basis of their s=\r\nubsequent task of creating a country.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then came the female God, Izanami,=\r\n and the male, Izanagi. They stood\non the floating bridge of heaven and sti=\r\nrred the ocean with a jewelled\nspear until it curdled, and so created the f=\r\nirst island, Onokoro. They\nbuilt a house on this island, with a central sto=\r\nne pillar that is the\nbackbone of the world. Izanami walked one way around =\r\nthe pillar, and\nIzanagi walked the other. When they met face to face, they =\r\nunited in\nmarriage.\n\nTheir first child was named Hiruko, but he did not thr=\r\nive, so when he\nwas three, they placed him in a reed boat and set him adrif=\r\nt, he\nbecame Ebisu, God of fishermen.\n\nThen Izanami gave birth to the eight=\r\n islands of Japan. And finally\nIzanami began to give birth to the Gods who =\r\nwould fashion and rule the\nworld -- Gods of the sea and Gods of the land, G=\r\nods of wind and rain.\nBut when Izanami gave birth to the God of fire, she w=\r\nas badly burned\nand died.&quot;\n\n&quot;According to Japanese Shinto Mythology, at the=\r\n beginning of time, the\nheavens and the earths were mixed together in a gre=\r\nat cloud. Slowly,\nthe clearer, lighter parts of the cloud rose up and becam=\r\ne heaven. The\nheavier parts of the cloud descended and became an ocean of m=\r\nuddy\nwater. Between the heavens and the earth, a pale green sprout began to=\r\n\ngrow. It grew swiftly and was extremely strong. When the plant&#39;s\nflower bu=\r\nrst open, the First God emerged. This First God then created\nIzanagi, is th=\r\ne god of all that is light and heavenly. Izanagi, whose\nname means &quot;the mal=\r\ne who invites&quot;, and his wife and sister Izanami,\nwhose name means &quot;the fema=\r\nle who invites&quot;. The First God gave Izanagi\nthe task of finishing the creat=\r\nion of the world.\n\nStanding on rainbow called Ama-no-ukihashi (the floating=\r\n bridge of the\nheavens), they plunged a jewel crested spear into the ocean.=\r\n When they\npulled it free, the water that dripped from the spear coagulated=\r\n and\nformed the first island of the Japanese archipelago. Izanagi and\nIzana=\r\nmi went down to this island and settled down on it. Together, on\nthis islan=\r\nd, they made the islands of Japan.&quot;\n\n&quot;Izanagi and Izanami stood on the migh=\r\nty floating bridge of Heaven. \nThey looked down into the murky waters of th=\r\ne ocean below and wondered\nif there was anything down there.  Izanagi turne=\r\nd to Izanami and\nquestioned &quot;How should we explore the waters we see?&quot;  She=\r\n responded\nwith a gesture to the jeweled spear that sat on the opposite sid=\r\ne of\nthe bridge.  Izanagi smiled and moved to retrieve the spear.  He took\n=\r\nit in his hands and leaned over the corner of the bridge.  Reaching as\nfar =\r\ndown as he could he plunged the spear into the ocean waters. \n&quot;Anything?&quot; I=\r\nzanami asked. &quot;Not yet.&quot; he answered.  She moved to his\nside and put her ha=\r\nnds on the spear with him.  Together they stirred\nthe waters below in broad=\r\n sweeping strokes.  &quot;Maybe there is just\nnothing to be found.&quot; Izanami said=\r\n sounding disappointed.  She let go\nof the spear and let Izanagi search the=\r\n waters on his own.  He decided\nthat he had searched enough and began to pu=\r\nll the spear up.  As he\ndid, the brine and sludge clinging to the tip of th=\r\ne spear dripped\nback onto the surface of the water.  These pieces floated o=\r\nn the water\nrather than sinking.  They began to harden and form permanent l=\r\nand. \nIzanami saw the newly formed island and got very excited.  &quot;Oh brothe=\r\nr\nwe have created our own land!  Let us move there to make a home!&quot; \nIzanag=\r\ni agreed and they set out for their new home.  On arrival they\ndecided to b=\r\ne wed so they could make more land and more countries.\n\nAs brother and sist=\r\ner Izanagi and Izanami populated the earth with\nmountains, rivers more isla=\r\nnds and many gods.  The original islands\nthey created were thought to be Ja=\r\npan.&quot;\n\n&quot;and the myth of Japanese creation in which Izanagei, and his sister=\r\n\nIzanami, watch the first land form from ocean water dripping from\nIzanagi&#39;=\r\ns spear.&quot;\n\n&quot;While standing on the floating bridge of heaven, the pair looke=\r\nd down\nupon the face of the earth and pondered whether or not a potential\nc=\r\nountry was beneath them. Higher still above them, the primordial\ndeities re=\r\nalized that there actually was no place for their emissaries\nto land, so th=\r\ney cast down to them a magnificent jeweled spear.\nIzanagi thrust the jewel-=\r\nspear of heaven down into the ocean and\nstirred. With a &quot;curdle-curdle&quot; sou=\r\nnd, he stirred up the brine of the\nocean, and when he lifted the spear the =\r\nbrine coagulated and dripped\noff. It soon hardened and formed the island of=\r\n Onogoro\n(&quot;spontaneously-congealing&quot;) island in Japan. This mythical island=\r\n,\nsupposedly located somewhere off the northeastern coast of today&#39;s\nShikok=\r\nu, became Izanagi&#39;s and Izanami&#39;s home (Kojiki 20, note 5, and\n22, note 5).=\r\n&quot;\n\n&quot;Also known as the &#39;Prince Yamato Myth&#39; (Nihan Shoki / Kojiki), the\nfoun=\r\nding myth of Japan involves the relation between man and the Kami\nor Natura=\r\nl Spirits/&#39;gods&#39;. The Kami came into existence on a plane\nparallel to the P=\r\nrime Material, whence Japan is created after Izanagi\n(the male) &#39;dips his s=\r\npear into the ocean&#39; and creates Japan along\nwith Izanami (the female).&quot;\n\n&quot;=\r\nThe Japanese creation myth is an example of creation from a cosmic\negg. In =\r\nthe beginning, the world was a chaotic\nmass, an undefined egg, full of seed=\r\ns.  Gradually, the lighter parts\nbecame heaven and the heavier parts starte=\r\nd to form\nthe earth.  The heavens gave birth to three deities called the th=\r\nree\ncreating deities.  More gods were born and around\nthe seventh generatio=\r\nn two siblings were born, Izanagi and Izanami. \nThe gods had nothing to do =\r\nas long as the earth\nremained in a chaotic state.  The gods gave the siblin=\r\ngs, Izanagi and\nIzanami, a spear embellished with costly gems\nand told them=\r\n to create the land. \n\n&quot;They went to the floating bridge of heaven.  When t=\r\nhey looked below,\nthey saw a sea of filmy fog floating in the air.\nIzanagi =\r\npushed the spear into the fog and found that it touched\nsomething.  When he=\r\n pulled it back, clumps of mud fell\nand almost immediately hardened into th=\r\ne island Onogoro.&quot;\n\n&quot;The gods created two divine siblings, brother Izanagi =\r\nand sister\nIzanami, who stood upon a floating bridge above the primordial o=\r\ncean.\nUsing the jeweled spear of the gods, they churned up the first island=\r\n,\nOnogoro.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
