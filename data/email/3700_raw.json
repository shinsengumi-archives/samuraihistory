All ties to the the class of samurai had been legally severed. Why take a chance of validating a soldier&#39;s claim to that status by bringing back the &quot;soul of the samurai&quot;? In essence the Japanese government was reinstating the rank of samurai without the class or privileges by letting them carry swords again. A person might humbly say that they are not samurai but in their heart of hearts they feel they are and that no matter what the government says they still remain samurai.\n Now on the darker side:\nThere was a military uprising in the 1970&#39;s by a general who wanted to go back to the days of Imperial japan and reinstate the class of samurai by force. But only a handful of soldiers joined him. Everyone else shouted him down as a crazy man. He committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Okay, but why a Katana instead of a Calvary sword\n&gt; like other (US) militaries. Even pilots carried\n&gt; Katanas. \n&gt; \n\nTurn the question around: Why do we in the US military\ncarry cavalry sabers as our ceremonial weapons (and\nwhy did they carry them back in the day when they\nactually used them?) Because that&#39;s what we\nused--that&#39;s what fit with our Army. Why should the\nJapanese Army change what had worked for their culture\nfor 1000 years?\n\nNate\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
