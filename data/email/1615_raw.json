Then IIga Clan Master inserted his sword on the soil and take the\noath that IIga would no longer continue teaching the art of Ninpo and thus,\nin this way both IIGA and Koga ended their existences, at least as Ninpo\nClans.\n\nIt is difficult to find online reference or books with such aspects of\njapanese history. Ya knows... Ninpo issue tend to be very secretive... &lt;=o(\n\nOctavio Augusto\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n---\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
