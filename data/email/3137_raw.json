Two notable predecessors to geisha were the Saburuko, who came onto \nthe scene at the end of the seventh century, and the Shirabyoshi, who \nemerged during the late Heian � early Kamakura period (1185-1333AD).\n\nSaburuko, (ones who serve), were the result of an increasing social \ndisplacement towards the end of the seventh century. Many women found \nthemselves having to become wanderers, who, in order to survive, had to \nresort to trading their sexual favours. Whilst most of these women were from \nthe lower class, there were among them women who were quite educated and \ntalented. These particular Saburuko who were talented dancers and singers \noften found themselves invited to entertain at aristocratic gatherings.\n\n\n\n&gt;From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Sengoku game\n&gt;Date: Thu, 15 Jan 2004 00:03:05 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;Eric, hate to tell you bud, but no, in fact, they\n&gt;weren&#39;t. Geisha, just like &quot;ninja&quot; are a Edo Jidai\n&gt;phenomenon. There were entertainers, prostitutes, and\n&gt;the like, but no formal &quot;geisha&quot; group existed. They\n&gt;weren&#39;t settled into quarters, and the word wasn&#39;t\n&gt;even used, as Cepo said, until the 1700&#39;s. And of\n&gt;course they aren&#39;t connected with super ninja or\n&gt;anything--it&#39;s a freaking game, people need to get\n&gt;over it.\n&gt;\n&gt;nate\n&gt;\n&gt;--- &#65417;ric Ch&#39405;ard\n&gt;&lt;ericvietnam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; If I may.
