How exactly does\nthe term relate to Japan? I&#39;m used to discussing\nJapanese history in terms of Jidai (muromachi,\nSengoku, Azuchi-Momoyama, Tokugawa, whatever) or,\nsomewhat less familiar, by &quot;Chusei&quot;, &quot;Kinsei&quot;, etc. \n\nWhere does &quot;renaissance&quot; fall in this?\n\nNate\n\n\n--- murphymurphyjohn@... wrote:\n&gt; With the reliance on firearms by Kenshin and Takeda,\n&gt; I believe that \n&gt; Kawanakajima ought to be considered a Renaissance\n&gt; era battle.  Indeed,  I would submit \n&gt; that, although a middle point in the Age of the\n&gt; Country at War,  the \n&gt; introduction at Tanegashima in 1543 of Portuguese\n&gt; firearms ought to be considered the \n&gt; beginning of Modern War in Japan,  as the large use\n&gt; of cannon in Italy in 1494 \n&gt; by the French is often considered the beginning of\n&gt; the epoch of modern war in \n&gt; Europe.  I know Chinese firearms were there from\n&gt; approximately 1511 [pace \n&gt; Turnbull],  but they were not nearly as\n&gt; sophisticated as the Portuguese,  and the \n&gt; large contracts vetted for Oda Nobunaga after their\n&gt; introduction seems to bear \n&gt; out my point.  I hope Tony Bryant has some thoughts\n&gt; he can share here?  \n&gt; Regards,  Profmurf\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
