Then, Japanese people , ancestors of present Japanese , opened big party with funny dances, singing as well at that\n time.  She came out from the cave  because she  liked to see that party and Japanese people got a lot of sunshine finally.\n   \n  One of their desendants , was belived as the first Emperor  ,  named JINM TENNOR, (  Emperor  JINM )  .  He succeeded consective Emperors , resulting the current Emperor  AKIHITO   as   the  125th ones.   These kinds of story, myths, were written in the below mentioned KOJIKI , and  NIHON  SHOKI.\n   \n  KOJIKI  , and  NIHON SHOKI  ,both are the books written firstly and completed in AC 712,  AC 720  respectively  by some Japanese author  abide by the order of Emperor  TENMU  in order to show the myths talked from mouth to mouth since the birth of Japanese race  in the book style using real\n KANJI  transferred from China via  Korea. \n\n  I think only a few , present Japanese  ,  belive the above story.  \n  In my case,  I understand as ancestors of Japanese  including the leaders of BUSHI , like MINAMOTO  YORITOMO,  TAIRA KIYOMORI,  ASHIKAGA &#39;s,  ODA,  even  TOKUGAWA  believed these  myths  .   That&#39;s why Japanese  Emperors can succeed Emperism  untill now   since BUSHI tookover the government from\n Emperor rein .    I don&#39; believe Emperors  came out before  JINTOKU   existed really.   \n   \n  As you realize now by this explanation,  SINTO is a kind of religion of Japanese related to Japanese made old Gods.\n   \n  That is totally different religion from  BUDDHISM which was imported from China , initiated in INDIA.   BUDDA  created  his ism , God ,  named OSHAKA-sama,  or AMIDA  NYORAI.  \n   \n  SINTO  is for Japanese only,  but  BUDDHISM  is for every races , all over the world.\n   \n  I , myself, don&#39;t belive Ehova, Christ,  ISLAM,  BUDDHISM,  SINTO.  However,  I can feel sacred things whenever I face to Sun Rising  early in the morning  and  I look up full of  Stars spread in sky  high without clouds in the night .   \n   \n  Which means,  I  and my old , old ancestors who belived SINTO look like same , identical.\n   \n  Eddie  Hiramoto\nSteven Matsheshu &lt;steven_matsheshu@...&gt; wrote:\n            Do you mean that the otherway around, that the Southern Court was the one holding out? The Northern Court (the imposters) were the ones who &quot;won&quot; and continued into the present day... the Southern Court (the real court) was the court that allegedly disappeared. YES, we do know that the\n two courts allegedly merged back into one, however...&#65533;&#65533;the truth is that the southern line&#65533;&#65533;was not given the authority... The&#65533;&#65533;101st&#65533;&#65533;Emperor was Shoko, who was&#65533;&#65533;the NORTHERN LINE son of&#65533;&#65533;of Go-Komatsu... this\n means that the pretender Northern court actually never really did disappeared. The Imperial line is thus still a pretender line.\n&#65533;&#65533;\n&#65533;&#65533;However, many families to this day still maintain a &quot;Southern Court Loyalty&quot; (such as my family)&#65533;&#65533; and ... even if only in philosophy, still maintain a &quot;hold out&quot; ideology.&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; There is a little town called Ichinomiya&#65533;&#65533; in\n north-west Aichi prefecture which used to a haven for southern court princes and southern court loyalists (and if you are still interested, many of the supporters held land in Kawachi as well as in Owari). During WW2, one branch of the Southern Court descendents tried to lay claim to their\n rightful place, and while the imposter Northern Court acknowledged their claim as authentic and issued a statement as such, they refused (of course) to ceed the throne to them. \n&#65533;&#65533;\n&#65533;&#65533; I hope that answered your question. \n&#65533;&#65533;\n&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; In terms of the sword..

(In fact, swords seem to appear more \nfrequently in various mythologies than other weapons, but perhaps that&#39;s because \nthey were common to many cultures.)\n\nYou also make it sound as if Buddhism and Shinto are mutually exclusive, \nbut if that were true, it seems unlikely that so many Buddhist temples \nthroughout Japan would include Shinto shrines somewhere on their grounds. It \nseems to me -- from both study and personal experience -- that Shinto is as \ndeeply ingrained in the national character as Conficianism is in the Chinese \nculture. I&#39;m saying this not only based on texts by both foreigners and \nJapanese, but on the simple basis of how ubiquitous Shinto symbolism is \nthroughout the country. \n\nOn another matter... Speaking of the northern Imperial line, can you (or \nanyone on the forum) tell me who, if any of them, might still have clung to \ntheir claim to the throne around 1500? I know that in theory that line had \nbeen &quot;reabsorbed&quot; into the southern line, but I can&#39;t help thinking there \nmust have been holdouts...\n\nAny help?\n\n--RMB\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  \n            \n \n\n \n---------------------------------\nVANCOUVER 2010 Olympic News [Yahoo!
