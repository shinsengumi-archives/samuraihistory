The Sengoku \nSamurai touches the depths as well as the heights, and here we \nfind the best and the worst ... and most of the &#39;names&#39; have a bit \nof both about them, which to me adds the depth and colour to the \ntales.\n\nI can&#39;t remember precisely the where or when, but there was a \ntime when Ieyasu went to visit Hideyoshi(?) and a number of \nHideyoshi&#39;s women were the hostages of the Tokugawa.\n\nSakai used to go and sit with them, chat and pass the time to \nease their nerves, meanwhile outside Honda was stacking \nfirewood against the walls, ready to torch the place if anything \nshould happen to his lord. What days!\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
