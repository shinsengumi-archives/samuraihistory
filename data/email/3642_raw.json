Williams&quot; &lt;amacobra@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Re:Iaito vs Katana\n&gt;Date: Thu, 05 Feb 2004 23:41:39 -0500\n&gt;\n&gt;Keiman and Kei,\n&gt;\n&gt;   Iaido is a style of swordsmanship that deals, primarily, with the \n&gt;concept\n&gt;of drawing and acting (cutting, blocking, etc) in one motion.  The term\n&gt;itself comes from a man named Nakayama Hakudo who was one of the greatest\n&gt;swordsmen of the early 20th century.  Prior to that, schools of\n&gt;swordsmanship were loosely called Kenjutsu (sword technique) schools.  Not\n&gt;to be confused with Kendo, the &quot;fencing&quot; style identified by the armor and\n&gt;the bamboo shinai (fencing sword).\n&gt;   And Iaito is the training blade used by Iaidoka (practicioners of \n&gt;Iaido).\n&gt;It is, in these modern times, made out of a zinc/aluminum composite and \n&gt;does\n&gt;not have a sharp edge.  These swords are made to equal the weight of an\n&gt;actual combat blade but without the danger of losing a body part to a\n&gt;mistake.\n&gt;   A katana is the easily identifiable Japanese sword with the single edge\n&gt;and the gentle curve.\n&gt;   As for the double edged sakabatou...I know not of such a thing.  Though \n&gt;I\n&gt;have, in my studies, seen a description of one katana with a short cutting\n&gt;edge on the back of the kissaki (last few inches of the blade).\n&gt;   The similarities and differences between the Iaido/Kenjutsu schools \n&gt;could\n&gt;fill many, many books.  My knowledge only goes as far as Muso Shinden Ryu\n&gt;(which I have trained in) and what few other styles I have witnessed.\n&gt;   I hope this was helpful in some way.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Peace,\n&gt;\n&gt;Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Keep up with high-tech trends here at &quot;Hook&#39;d on Technology.&quot;\n&gt;http://special.msn.com/msnbc/hookedontech.armx\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCreate your own personal Web page with the info you use most, at My MSN. \nhttp://click.atdmt.com/AVE/go/onm00200364ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
