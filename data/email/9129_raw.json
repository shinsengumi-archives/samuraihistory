Howev=\r\ner there were Chokuto submitted for \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Shinsakuto competitions, thos=\r\ne I am afraid might cost you as \nmuch \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; the originals. Still if yo=\r\nu have to have one I would look to the \n&gt; modern \n&gt; &gt; swordmakers,\n&gt; &gt; -t\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; www.ncjsc.org\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; centuryfitness.com there are about 4 hand forged kat=\r\nanas  for \nabout 300-500$ (depending on wich one you want) i have the one f=\r\nor \n350$ and it is well worth my money  it holds a NICE edge & will flex \no=\r\nver 3&quot; before bending but its not like a cheap replica you have to \ntake ca=\r\nre of it lol and just a warning fingerprints left on it \novernight WILL sta=\r\ny on it forever (its like rust)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
