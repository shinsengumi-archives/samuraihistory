Gladiator: not much. The setting \nis historically sound, the events are pure Hollywood fiction, but why \nnot? People loved it!! I think all over it was a good movie, even with \nall its inconsistencies. I especially enjoyed the part when Algren is \n&quot;prisoner&#39; in the Japanese village, and &quot;learns&quot; to be Japanese. The \nfirst battle (in the forest) was EXCELLENT as well. The scene with the \nsamurai coming out of the mist... Kurosawa himself would have loved \nthat.\n\n*** SPOILER DOWN HERE ***\n\nThe lamest part was at the end, when the Emperor refused to sign a deal \nwith the Americans just because of Algren bringing back Katsumoto&#39;s \nsword. That was a bit like... mmmmhhhh... I was happy thou that Algren \nwent back to his girlfriend (Ok, ok, I know I&#39;m cheesy...)\n\nAnyway, good movie, and I&#39;ll buy the DVD as soon as it comes out.\ncepo\n\nOn Jan 10, 2004, at 7:48 AM, spud10000 wrote:\n\n&gt; I have just seen The Last Samurai.
