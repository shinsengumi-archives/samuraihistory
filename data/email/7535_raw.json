If, like the above poster\ndid, you are replying with a general reply (&quot;Thanks,\nappreciate the info&quot;, etc.) then DELETE all except a\nline or two of the message to which you are replying,\nso we can identify the person to whom you are\nreplying. \n\nIf, for instance, I was replying to someone&#39;s email on\ntop 10 movie choices but only wanted to comment on\ntheir #4 choice, I&#39;d delete the rest of it in the\nreply, and only leave the relevant comments on choice\n#4. \n\nAnd please, the proper way to reply is to BOTTOM post.\nConversations work when A makes a comment, B replies.\nThe natural order is A then B. If B writes his comment\nbefore A&#39;s message, it&#39;s more difficult to ID exactly\n*what* B is referring to. \n\nThis isn&#39;t hard, and makes things easier on the reader\n(you) and the moderator (me). \n\nThe MGMT.\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n"
