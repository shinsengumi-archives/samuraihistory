If the latter, then if I am asked\na question about military tactics, then it has a\nserious bearing on how I will answer the question. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there any military leaders in the U.S army that\n&gt; you could compare to any of the great military\n&gt; leaders of the past?\n&gt; \n\nI am assuming you mean currently? The US Army has had\nits share for its short history (Grant, Washington,\nLee most of his life, Patton, Eisenhower, etc.) If you\nmean currently, that&#39;s rather hard to say. Most of the\nabove mentioned wouldn&#39;t be considered great if there\nhad not have been wars for them to fight. I believe\nmany great leaders don&#39;t stand out until the bullets\nstart to fly. But if I had to say anybody that I&#39;ve\nhad contact with, a COL Michael Formica comes to mind.\nHe was my squadron commander in a cavalry unit in\nKorea. Tactical genius, and we would have followed him\nanywhere. If he had decided to go to Pyongyang, we&#39;d\nhave followed him all the way. \n\nAnother might be LTC H.R. McMaster. If you&#39;ve\nresearched the Gulf War at all, he was the cavalry\ncompany commander that destroyed an Iraqi Republican\nGuard battalion at the Battle of 73 Easting. He&#39;s been\npublished many times, and is regarded as quite the\nrising star. And I&#39;ve talked with people who work for\nhim (he commands a cavalry squadron in Germany now)\nand they say he really is the tactical genius everyone\nsays he is. \n\nThose are just personal observations, and I can only\nspeak for what I have seen. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
