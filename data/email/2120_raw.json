They could be anyone from a lowly kitchen worker, \nto a fully ranked and privleged Samurai.\n\nFor a historical example of how ninja and samurai worked, read the book &quot;Taiko&quot; \nit contains fairly accurate accounts of how ninja and samurai worked together.\n\nFYI: Ninja rarely if ever wore outfits like the movies show them wearing. They \nsimply dressed like everyone else did.\n\n-Thom\n&gt; I am also sure ninjas casted samurai in a negative light as well. \n&gt; Generally ninjas were not of samurai class, (anyone know any \n&gt; exceptions?) they were made up of the other classes, since they \n&gt; couldn&#39;t become samurai, they trained and became ninjas instead, and \n&gt; I&#39;m sure being oppressed by the samurai class led to animosity \n&gt; towards them, therefore once again, &quot;bitter enemies.&quot;\n\n"
