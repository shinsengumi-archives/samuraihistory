Is this true?\n\nFirst off: No problem if people want to reply to an\nemail and introduce a new thread--much easier than\ngoing through the website. PLEASE change the subject\nheading at the top though. This question is NOT abut\nBushido or kanji characters--help us help you, by\nproperly identifying it. \n\nSecondly: You&#39;ll get better response if you clarify\nwhat, who, and when you are talking about. To Mr.\nRogers--There were about a dozen different Saito\nfamilies at various different times, not necessarily\nrelated. When are you talking about? If you mean\naround 1561 or so, I&#39;d assume you meant the Saito of\nMino, and were asking if they had an alliance with the\nMatsudaira (later Tokugawa) of Mikawa. If you mean\nlater than that (for you obviously can&#39;t mean before\nthat), then I&#39;m not entirely sure which Saito clan you\nmay mean, or what type of alliance you&#39;d be asking\nabout. Post 1600 it wouldn&#39;t be an alliance--it&#39;d be\nthe Tokugawa telling the Saito to do something, if\nthey knew what was good for them. \n\nTo Mr./Ms. Vahabi: I don&#39;t wish to be offensive, but\nthe utter vagueness of your response leads me to\nbelieve it&#39;s a random thought with no back-up. A\nrebellion in the north? When was this? Was it in the\nTohoku region? Who was this Saito clan which &quot;allied&quot;\nwith the Tokugawa (not the Tukugawa, mind you)?\nPlease, provide some hard facts---though admittedly,\nyour answer is only as vague as the question. \n\nTo all: While digressions are acceptable to an extent,\nand we&#39;ve been known to pass our fair share of jokes\nand inane banter, it&#39;s been brought up by several\npeople that we need to get back to some serious\nHISTORY discussion. This question provides and\nexcellent opportunity to DO just that, as long as we\ncan define the question better. It&#39;s certainly better\nthan bushido kanji--does NO ONE know how to look up\nonline Japanese dictionaries?\n\nNate\nAssistant Dictator/Obergruppenfuhrer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours do?\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
