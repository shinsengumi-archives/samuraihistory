Then 20\n&gt; years later when some people have done serious\n&gt; research to fix the problem you get sites like\n&gt; www.entertheninja.com sprouting up and sites made by\n&gt; 15 year old school boy wannabe ninja&#39;s and every one\n&gt; reads these and they must be real - I mean why would\n&gt; any one make a false web page.\n&gt; \n&gt; The truth of the matter is Iga and Koga were the\nmain\n&gt; areas of development. some fo these &#39;clans&#39; did sell\n&gt; thesleves out per contract, then there were some\n&gt; schools that were created within a samurai domain\nand\n&gt; was either made up of samurai or peasents. picked\nfor\n&gt; certain skills they had or were told to develop.\nmany\n&gt; of these schools survived for several generation\nmany\n&gt; were only in existance for a small number of years. \n&gt; \n&gt; some of them did have codes of ethics, some didnt.\n&gt; some used there skills to be cat burglers, after all\n&gt; some ninjutsu skills required the skill to enter a\n&gt; building and escape unseen. Then you have the ninja\n&gt; that were information gatherers. Kagemusha by\nkurosawa\n&gt; is a great film to see this. there is a scene where\n3\n&gt; men are watching the samurai army. All dressed in\n&gt; common every day cloths watching from a distance.\nall\n&gt; from different clans. some of these guys couldnt\neven\n&gt; fight properly other than the same skills of the\n&gt; everyday man or samurai. and before any one asks.\n&gt; Ninja did not run around wearing black suits with\n&gt; masks. That is a Meiji period Myth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Look at a street scene out of a kurosawa movie.\n&gt; Imagine someone dressed in pure black in the middle\nof\n&gt; that. he would be as moticeable as if he were naked.\n&gt; the men in kagemusha are a good example of the way\n&gt; Ninja dresssed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some records by ninja have survived - Shoninki -\n&gt; Ninpiden - Bansenshukai.

They had a code of ethics, I\nmean,\n&gt; not engagment-\n&gt; wise, but they&#39;re based around a type of\n&gt; militia/guerilla tactics. \n&gt; Generally speaking, I don&#39;t think all samurai were\n&gt; honorable either. \n&gt; I&#39;m sure there must have been a handful of &quot;dirty&quot;\n&gt; samurai.\n&gt; ;) Dustin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Masamori\n&gt; Masami&quot; \n&gt; &lt;oni_shogun@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Generally samurai looked down on ninjas.
