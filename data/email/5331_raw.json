There were no &quot;ranks&quot;, as such. \n\nNate I agree with you in the main here. I would have probably chosen \na different set of words - that is, there was no &quot;rank an promotion&quot; \nsystem where a person with x amount of experience or know-how would \nget promoted to the next &#39;level&#39;.\n\nAt the same time I think it&#39;s fair to say that there were certainly jo\nbs, or posts, or stations that were more important or prestigious, and \njobs that were less important and prestigious. In that sense it can be \nsaid that there were &#39;ranks&#39;.\n\nOn top of that there were of course the ranks in terms of the \nShoku-i \u001b$B?&0L\u001b(B system.\n\n&gt;The problem is that many times you see things\n&gt;translated into English that appear to be ranks, when\n&gt;they are actually job titles. &quot;Taisho&quot;, often\n&gt;translated as general, isn&#39;t a rank--it&#39;s a job title.\n\nThis is very well said! In fact (as you and I have exchanged on this \nlist before), even the title Shogun is not in essence a &quot;rank&quot;. It \nis really a job description. IN fact the title &quot;Shogun&quot; is not even \npart of the Shoku-i ranking system.\n\n&gt;It refers to someone who leads a large body of troops.\n&gt;That could be 10,000 troops, or 300. Obviously if you\n&gt;lead 10,000 you are probably more important, and of\n&gt;higher &quot;rank&quot; than the guy with only 300, but you&#39;re\n&gt;still both &quot;Taisho&quot;. \n\nAh - here&#39;s what I was getting at. But beyond this, of course an \nashigaru is lower than a taisho. So at some level wouldn&#39;t you be \nable to call this a &#39;rank&#39;?\n\nThen of course to confuse matters more we have that Ashigaru \nTaisho.....\n\n&gt;Similiarly, you&#39;ll see things like &quot;Ashigaru-gashira&quot;,\n&gt;etc., but again, these are job titles, not ranks. A\n&gt;&quot;Kashira&quot; is the head of a particular unit, so the\n&gt;ashigaru-kashira would be the leader of a small unit\n&gt;of ashigaru, kind of like a platoon leader in the\n&gt;modern army. \n\nThis specific example seems in my way of thinking to blur the lines a \nbit. It seems to me that once &#39;promoted&#39; to ashigaru-gashira a person \nwould not go back to being a plain ashigaru. In other words this one \nseems more like a permanent promotion rather than just a \nbattle-by-battle job assignment. What do you think?\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
