I know it&#39;s confusing, but I&#39;ll try to help.\n\nEmperor isn&#39;t a rank--you don&#39;t get &quot;promoted&quot; to it.\nIt&#39;s a JOB, really. A hereditary one. \n\nShogun, also, isn&#39;t a rank--not in the sense of a\ncourt rank, which is what was being discussed. Kampaku\nalso isn&#39;t a &quot;rank&quot;, it&#39;s a job. Ieyasu didn&#39;t\nnecessarily &quot;outrank&quot; Hideyoshi because he made it to\nShogun and Hideyoshi was Kampaku--the two are\nessentially seperate entitites, with little or no\nties. \n\nDaimyo, again, is a description of someone&#39;s military,\neconomic, and political status, but not necessarily a\n&quot;rank&quot;. A daimyo was a daimyo was a daimyo, whether\nyou held 15,000 koku in Sado, or 3 million koku in the\nKanto--you were still a daimyo. What mattered was your\nincome and military strength. \n\nTaisho, again, is translated as general, but not in\nthe &quot;Brigadier General, Major General, etc.&quot; sense. It\nmeans someone who led a large group of soldiers into\nbattle. If you led 1,000 or 15,000, you were a taisho\neither way. It describes someone who led the\ntroops--in other words, like the rest, a job.\n\nRanks, as we mean with &quot;lower second rank&quot;, were ranks\naccording to the imperial ranking system devised in\nthe Heian period. I&#39;m by no means an expert--actually,\nI know very little. However, there were various\ngradations of rank, and each gradation was further\nsubdivided into lower, middle, and upper. So you could\nbe of &quot;Lower 5th rank&quot;, but that was more impressive\nthan someone of &quot;Upper 7th rank&quot;. \n\nTony&#39;s website, www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany \nhas a pretty good explanation on this, much better\nthan I could do. \n\nHope that helps.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
