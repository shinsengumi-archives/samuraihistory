Gakken, the\n&gt; publishers of the rekishi gunzo series, has come out witha new volume that\n&gt; is a compliation of old screens depicting several sengoku battles. It has\n&gt; full color fold reproductions as well as closeups. It numbers and\nidentifies\n&gt; all the major samurai. Besides Sekigahara it includes Kawanakajima,\n&gt; Nagashino, Yamazaki, and Shimabara.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: JJ &lt;DarkJJ@...&gt;\n&gt; To: samuraihistory &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 5:27 PM\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] Sekigahara\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Konbanwa,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     I was wondering if anyone out there knows of any complete guides to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; battle of Sekigahara.
