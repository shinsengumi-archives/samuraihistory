Basically, and breifly it is a fairly recent samurai \nmovie that is in part based on the struggles between Takeda \nShingen and Uesugi Kenshin.  I taped it, and really enjoy it.  I am \nnow looking for it on DVD, but cannot find it under Heaven and \nEarth, all I get is the Oliver Stone one.  I remeber a while back on \nhere someone metioning it by a different title.  If anyone knows it \nplease help.  Thanks\n\n\n"
