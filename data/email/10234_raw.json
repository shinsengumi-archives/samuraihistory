This year we will be doing things a little differently. There are six plots to choose from, and the stories must be based on one of these. The genre is completely up to the author. \n\nRequirements: \n\nThis is to be a piece of fiction writing taking place within an unspecified period in Japanese history. The plot choices are listed below - the stories can be written in any genre. \n\nParameters: \n\nThe story is required to be more than 1,000 words, with a 5,000 word targeted limit - overages are acceptable if necessary, but please don&#39;t overdo it. It can be done in the first person, or the third person, and must be a complete short story, not an excerpt from a larger story. The chosen plot number must be listed at the top of the story - only one &quot;plot&quot; per story. Although the particular plot will not affect judging, all entrants will be judged on how well they utilize thier chosen plotline.\n\nDisqualifications: Stories with numerous blatant misspellings or poor grammar may be immediately disqualified at the judges discretion. Please spellcheck and proofread your stories. You have until November 2010, plenty of time to correct spelling mistakes and grammar issues.\n\nThere is no fee to enter the samurai fiction contest. The contest is completely free and open to all. The entries will be published on Samurai Archives.com, with the winner featured. Writers will retain all rights to their stories. A maximum of two stories per entrant are allowed. \n\nPlease note that any stories that are disqualified for bad grammar or spelling will not be published on the website. \n\nSubmission Information: \n\nSubmissions are to be sent via email to webmaster |at| samurai-archives.com in a WORD .Doc format, .TXT file OR HTML. At the top of the first page, please include your full name, your Yahoo ID, and Samurai Archives Citadel ID (or whichever is applicable) your email address, as well as the plot number the story falls under, and the title of your story. You will receive a confirmation email that your submission has been received. A maximum of two stories per author are acceptable. \n\nJudging and Winning the contest: \n\nSubmissions will be judged by a panel of Yahoo Group and/or Samurai Citadel community members who are not submitting stories. The judges will not be told who the authors of each respective submision are until after the judging has closed, to avoid any swaying of the judges. The recipient of the submissions (The Samurai Archives webmaster) will not be a judge, and will only moderate the proceedings, to keep entries anonymous. The winning story will be featured on the Samurai Archives site as the winner of the 2010 Samurai Fiction contest. All stories will be placed in the &#39;Fan Fiction&#39; section of the Samurai Archives as well. The winner will be announced at the Yahoo Group and the Samurai Archives Citadel at the end of judging in November. \n\nPrizes:\n\nPrizes are supplied by Animeigo:\n\nGrand/First Prize: The Musashi Boxed Set and an Animeigo T-shirt\n\nSecond: Samurai Vendetta and an Animeigo T-shirt\n\nThird: Blind Menace and an Animeigo T-shirt\n\nAll Animeigo T-shirts are size XL.
