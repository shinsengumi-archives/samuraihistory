In th=\r\ne rearly \norigin ,some poor  farmaers armed strongly  were hired as the gar=\r\nd \nmen , or small family of peerage as well.  So, no body knows who was \nth=\r\ne first Samurai , the name of person of first Samurai.\n    In fact, Samurai=\r\n were , originally ,  the lowest  rank of social \nstratum ( higher than sla=\r\nves ) .  Isn&#39;t it interesting  for you ?\n   In Japan, before the birth of S=\r\namurai, Emperor , Peerage, Farmers, \nMerchant, Producers were the main stra=\r\ntum . \n\n    And then, gradually, Buke became more people  and stronger and =\r\n\nstronger and had power to control Farmers, Merchant, Producers.\n\n    So,  =\r\nSamurai means Buke , to protect or gard somebody others.\n\n      The histori=\r\ncal story about Samurai is over for today.  TO BE \nCONTINUED.  (   After th=\r\ne above history, another interesting thing you \ncan know ).\n    Looking for=\r\nward to hearing your comment on the above.\n\n  (  At present,  of cause, no =\r\nmore  Samurai exists.  Please see &quot; Last \nSamurai &quot;  ,  the famous movie.  =\r\nHow to terminate, I&#39;ll let you know \nlater.)\n\n   Eddie  Hiramoto\n    \n\n\n\n\n"
