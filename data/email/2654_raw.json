Katsumoto is supposed to represent Saigo Takamori. \nCheck out this site:\n\nhttp://www.emory.edu/HISTORY/RAVINA/lastsamurai.html\n\nYou said, &quot;the way of the samurai and all was working just fine! Why were they trying to \nbecome so modern???&quot; Here&#39;s an answer:\n\nThe samurai were feudal warriors... basically Japanese fighting other Japanese, hidden behind \na curtain of isolationism. Well, the long-practiced isolationism ended with the intrusion of  \nPerry&#39;s ships. When that curtain fell, Japan saw a bigger world with a lot of potential enemies. \nJapan realized it could not defend itself. Japan had to unify and modernize in order to defend \nitself from invasion. The samurai tactics of war were well-suited for fighting other sword-bearing \nfoes on the island of Japan. But if could do very little against a navy fleet.  \nThe Japanese were no longer concerned with how to defend themselves from other Japanese. \nThey had to know how to defend themselves from everybody else. Emperor Meiji simply \nresponded to the impetus of potential attack from other nations.\n\n\n"
