When Ieyasu was given a banner of the\nPure Land sect, would that be a raalying point for his followers? \n\nAgain in the west when facing the impossible, the colours were sent to\nthe rear (a great morale boost, I&#39;m sure!) as there was dishonour in\nallowing the colours to fall into enemy hands.\n\nIs it Kagemusha in which the defeat army throw their banners down and\nretreat? (I can picture the image, but not the film).\n\nJust a curiosity. I&#39;ve never come across this.\n\nExcept, of course, the planting of the flag in Seven Samurai - this is\nprobably the kind of thing I&#39;m wondering about.\n\nAnd if the standard did not have an equivalant emotive value, was\nthere anything, apart from the person of the commander, that did?\n\nAnd again, there is a famous tale of a clash between samurai and sohei\nin which the samurai fired an arrow at the portable shrine carried by\nthe monks (so famous it completely escapes me) which might be read in\na similar vein.\n\nTom\n(been offscene for a while)\n\n\n\n\n"
