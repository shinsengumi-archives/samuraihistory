I like it \nhere.\n\nSo far my favourite is Shogun or Samurai Swords by Milton Bradley. \nBut I haven`t played so many yet. I have also played a Japanese\ngame called Sekigahara by 6 Angles. Another game by 6 Angles\ndepicted the Mongol invasion of Japan--the one where the &quot;Kamikaze&quot;\nor Divine Wind intervened. Another good simulation--it game one the\nfeeling of being there, as much as a game can.\n\nYour thoughts on games please.\n\nKevin\nhttp://www009.upp.so-\nnet.ne.jp/englishschool/hisgamingopeningpage.html\n\n\n\n"
