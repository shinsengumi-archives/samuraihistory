I might have to get Turnbull&#39;s Samurai Sourcebook. \n\nThere is still some confusion over whether the Shimazu clan banner was\na black mon on white field or white on black. Could it be both?\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- russcat9 &lt;snowcat9@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Would Shimazu samurai and retainers bear the clan\n&gt; &gt; mon on their\n&gt; &gt; sashimonos or their lord&#39;s personal version?\n&gt; \n&gt; Shimazu specifically, I don&#39;t know. Usually it\n&gt; depended on the personal loyalties of that particular\n&gt; soldier--if he was a personal retainer of, say,\n&gt; Iehisa, he could potentially where a device specific\n&gt; to Iehisa. But more often than not it&#39;d be a general\n&gt; device. The Hojo are the best example of this, I\n&gt; think--all the Hojo bigwigs used the same fish-scale\n&gt; mon, in different colors to identify their\n&gt; contingents. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and then there&#39;s this from the Asian War group:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Turnbull, in his Sourcebook (always handy) reports\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shimazu: white mon of cross in ring on black\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yoshihiro: short red fukinuki (hollow streamer\n&gt; &gt; banner) and banner of\n&gt; &gt; white &quot;ju&quot; on black\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Retainers&#39; mon vary according to the whim of the\n&gt; &gt; lord equipping them.\n&gt; &gt; My impression (just that) is that more personal\n&gt; &gt; troops (hatamoto, etc)\n&gt; &gt; would carry a particular lord&#39;s banner while more\n&gt; &gt; routine troops\n&gt; &gt; (ashigaru) the clan. But remember, samurai retainers\n&gt; &gt; often carried\n&gt; &gt; their own insignias!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The standard described by Turnbull there for Yoshihiro\n&gt; isn&#39;t what his soldiers wore--it was HIS personal\n&gt; standard, or &quot;Uma-jirushi&quot;. An attendant carried it,\n&gt; and it marked HIS location on the battlefield, just\n&gt; like Hideyoshi&#39;s Gourd Standard or Ieyasu&#39;s Golden\n&gt; Fan. His retainers would wear the Shimazu mon on a\n&gt; sashimono, in whatever color combination. \n&gt; \n&gt; Turnbull is usually really good with heraldry--I\n&gt; haven&#39;t checked his book specifically on that yet, but\n&gt; the stuff in the sourcebook and others is solid. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
