They engaged in prize-fight sorts of matches.\nThis particular article discusses female ex-samurai in particular and the\ndevelopment of various schools of naginata. But the article discusses these\nmatches. Here would be the relavant section of the article. \n\nhttp://koryu.com/library/wwj4.html\n\n-------------------------------\nIn the early Meiji period, there was another impetus for the development of\ncompetitive martial sports This was the phenomenon of roving martial\n&quot;carnivals&quot; known as gekken kogyo (gekken means &quot;attacking sword&quot;; kogyo\nmeans &quot;a show&quot;). Some former samurai, down on their luck, joined forces in\ntraveling exhibitions, giving demonstrations and taking challenges from the\naudiences. Mounting the stage, fighters would challenge all comers from the\naudience, using wooden or bamboo swords, naginata, spear, chain-and-sickle,\nor any other weapon selected by the challenger. These fights were very\npopular and well written up in the newspapers. Although the fighters\nprobably tried to exert some control, there were many injuries. In addition\nto challenge matches, members of the troop would engage each other in\n&quot;combat,&quot; and among the most popular would be a woman with a wooden naginata\nagainst a man armed with a wooden or bamboo replica of a sword.\n-------------------------------\n\nAs for during the actual samurai eras (before 1868): I know that there were\nincidences of &quot;dojo crashing&quot; which have been portrayed in various samurai\nmovies (chambara). Other than that, I know very little.\n\nHope this helps, Nina  \n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \nSamurai\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+swords&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Sam\nurai+part&c=2&s=38&.sig=i-aS2VqspDvuosjyLvkOEQ&gt; swords \tSamurai\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Samurai+part&w1=Samurai+swords&w2=Samur\nai+part&c=2&s=38&.sig=p5v93HNycsLUTd-IlYGqOA&gt; part \t\n\n  _____  \n\nYAHOO!
