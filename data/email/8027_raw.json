Though the openei=\r\nng scenes \nhave an encampmnet surrounded by beautiful jinmaku (camp curtain=\r\ns), \nthere was never a tent shown.  According to Mr Bryant, they  usually \n=\r\ntook over some neighboring Temple or hous to sleep in. \n\n  I would think th=\r\nat they would also have tents of some sort.
