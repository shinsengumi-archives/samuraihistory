But I\nknow people, I know a bit of the market and I know a bit of how things goes\nin the world.\n\nninjas are market. the target usually is between 10-20 years. they sell\ngood in any form (see under power rangers or ninja turtles). and they\ngenerate a decent amount of hype when paired with martial arts in a\nserious-looking cover. Also research of the &#39;truth&#39; discovering ancent\nhidden misteries or riddles generates hype.\n\nnow, my question is:\nthis Hayes, is an archeologist or a historian or a student of martial arts\nwho is genuinely interested in ninjas and published freely his own results\non internet making sure he makes unassuming statements on ninjas in a\ngenuine search for the truth? or he put on the market products to gain\nmoney, thus having to bend his work to the publishers will?.\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.\nVersion: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.11.6 - Release Date: 06/05/2005\n\n\n"
