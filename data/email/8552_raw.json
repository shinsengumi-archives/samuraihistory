GOD BLESS\n  \n\nJim Hathaway &lt;hathaway@...&gt; wrote:\n  I saw this item yesterday on Navy News, and thought it might be of \ninterest-\n\nFrom USS Kitty Hawk Public Affairs\n\nUSS KITTY HAWK (NNS) -- Famous Japanese swordmaker, Yoshi Yoshihara, \nand Vice Adm. Tsutomo Tamura, president of the Japan Maritime Self \nDefense Force (JMSDF) Staff College, saw firsthand the U.S. Navy&#39;s \nquality craftsmanship in action when they visited USS Kitty Hawk (CV \n63) March 7. \n\nTamura and Yoshihara were invited to visit Commander, Fleet \nActivities, Yokosuka and Kitty Hawk by Rear Adm. James D. Kelly, \ncommander, Naval Forces Japan. Kelly, who has a deep interest in the \nJapanese culture and swordmaking, was eager to have Tamura and \nYoshihara visit and see what U.S. 7th Fleet American Sailors do.\n\n&quot;It was a great honor to have Vice Adm. Tamura and Mr. Yoshihara \naboard Kitty Hawk,&quot; said Capt. Ed McNamee, Kitty Hawk commanding \nofficer, who led the tour.\n\nMcNamee kicked off the ship tour with a brief in Kitty Hawk&#39;s combat \ndirection center. Following the brief, the group visited the ship&#39;s \nflight deck.\n\n&quot;Because the ship is undergoing maintenance right now, it was a \ngreat opportunity to show off a lot of work being done by our \nSailors, Japanese contractors and Ship&#39;s Repair Facility (SRF) \npersonnel,&quot; said McNamee.\n\nFollowing a tour of the flight deck, Tamura and Yoshihara visited \nthe ship&#39;s No. 4 Main Machinery Room.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t know how many Sailors it takes to keep a ship this size \noperating, such as on the flight deck and in engineering,&quot; said \nYoshihara.\n\n&quot;It was a great honor to have Vice Adm. Tamura and a craftsman of \nMr.Yoshihara&#39;s caliber visit our propulsion plant,&quot; said Capt. Pete \nSchupp, Kitty Hawk&#39;s chief engineer.\n\nSchupp, along with McNamee, led Tamura and Yoshihara to see No. 4 \nmain condenser in the process of being re-tubed, a significant \namount of maintenance on a boiler water drum. \n\n&quot;We&#39;re currently undergoing considerable work, so we had the \nopportunity to highlight the work of our Japanese contractors, SRF \nworkers, and Kitty Hawk Sailors,&quot; Schupp added.\n\n&quot;I was surprised to learn and see how young most of the Sailors are \naboard the ship,&quot; said Yoshihara. \n\nBorn in 1945, Yoshihara started making swords at the age of 12. \nSince then he has become recognized as one of Japan&#39;s finest master \nswordmakers. \n\n&quot;There was much I didn&#39;t know about the closeness of the cooperation \nbetween the JMSDF and the U.S. Navy,&quot; said Yoshihara, &quot;and how much \nwork our Sailors do together.&quot;\n\nThe Kitty Hawk Strike Group is the largest carrier strike group in \nthe Navy and is composed of the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, Carrier \nAir Wing (CVW) 5, the guided-missile cruisers USS Chancellorsville \n(CG 62) and USS Cowpens (CG 63), and Destroyer Squadron 15. \n\nTo find more news about the Kitty Hawk Strike Group, visit the Navy \nNewsStand at www.news.navy.mil/local/cv63. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2006 Samurai Fiction contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\n\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS \n        Samurai   Japan   Japan airline \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
