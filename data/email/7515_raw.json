H&#39;mm even though my eyesight is pretty\ndam bad, I went and had a look at the illustrations, which were very\ninteresting, but would you or anyone else like to proffer some\ninterpretations? Apart from the TSUKA (sword grip), YA (arrow) and YUMI\n(bow), I was on the whole a bit lost. What the heck was the thing that\nlooked like a dog kennel next to the JIN MAKU (camp curtain), and the\nseemingly miniature TAIKO (drum), a container maybe? And as to the other\nstuff...?\n\nYours curiously\n\nDean\n***\nIn message &lt;a0621028cbf318186da39@[192.168.1.114]&gt;, tom helm\n&lt;junkmail@...&gt; writes\n&gt;http://tinyurl.com/cdgcl\n&gt;\n&gt;       Interesting but...\n&gt;-t\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;--- \n&gt;Yahoo!
