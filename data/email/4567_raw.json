This is just one of the things that makes researching Jap=\r\nanese\nhistory sometimes difficult. Original source material, unless you can=\r\n read\nJapanese. Even then it depends on when it was written. For example, I=\r\n have\nmanaged to get my hands on a set of the Official Japanese Naval Gener=\r\nal\nStaff Report written after the Russo-Japanese War! What a score.\n\nProble=\r\nm is, it is written in Meji era Japanese and even my Japanese friends\nand a=\r\nssociates have a very hard time translating it. But! And this is a big\nbut!=\r\n I have since found a copy that was published in Germany in 1912-1914.\nLuck=\r\ny for me the set was published before the start of WWI. The field staff\nrep=\r\nort was never finished being translated due to the war. My parents were\nfro=\r\nm Germany an d we soke and read German as children do it was not hard\nfor m=\r\ne to get back into reading it. All it took was a chart of the Fraktur\nalpha=\r\nbet and I was off to the races.\n\nI will list the books that I have managed =\r\nto collect covering the samurai\nand Japanese early history in another email=\r\n.\n\nCheers\nBill M.\n\nOriginal Message:\n-----------------\nFrom: Oyakata oyakat=\r\na@...\nDate: Thu, 17 Jun 2004 21:10:12 -0400\nTo: samuraihistory@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Greetings from a new guy\n\n\nOn=\r\n Thu, 17 Jun 2004 20:30:54 -0400, billm@...=1B$B$5$s=1B(B\n=\r\nwrote in message &lt;59730-22004651803054565@...&gt;\n\n&gt;Right now =\r\nI am reading &quot;Samurai a Military History&quot; by Stephen Turnbull. I\n&gt;heard it =\r\nis a good place to start.\n\nYou&#39;ll probably hear mixed reviews. Turnull is k=\r\nind of one of the \naccepted &quot;gurus&quot;. I kind of like his &quot;Samurai Warfare&quot;. =\r\nBut at the \nsame time something about his style strikes me as somewhat flak=\r\ney.
