The survivor in question had lost both his best mates, \n(and was sticky with the gore of one of them, who was blown up \nat his side) and held little chance of either their success or \nhis own survival.\n\nAt first light their major walked down the hillside under a \nwhite flag. He explained to the Argentinian officer that they \nwere Brit Paratroops and his men were champing at the bit to \n&#39;get stuck in&#39;. He further explained that they were going to \nattack within the hour, and that once they did he would not be \nheld responsible for the conduct of his men, and quite frankly \nit was likely they would be taking no prisoners. \n\nHis best advice to his opposite number was to surrender.\n\nWhich is precisely what happened.\n\nThe survivor&#39;s voice changed audibly when talking of the \ncourage and sheer bravura of his officer, he was in awe of the \nman&#39;s nerve. No doubt the reputation of the Red Devils went \nbefore them.\n\nThomas\n\n\n"
