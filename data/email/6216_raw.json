I don&#39;t know about this subject, so I would \n&gt; like to see your point of view, especially since you are in the \n&gt; marine, if I remember correctly.\n\nCogs and caravelles were no longer being used, I believe, by the mid 16th \ncentury. The Iberian ships traveling around Asia were typically referred to as \ngalleons, although in the 1540s they were probably fairly early types with some \ncaravelle features still in place.\n\nTony\n caravelles Were just being replaced out as you say tony, but portuguese trade post in africa were still actively using them due to the adapted sail (which i think was arabic in origin) which allowed the ship to sail headlong. Galleons became the norm ,and it bacame a kind of arms race in europe to see whom could build the largest and most decorative. Id imagine the sight of these highly decorated and large craft to indiginous peoples would be a sign of strength as well as a practical use. But as you say there maybe be a combination of both galleon and caravelles so it would be intresting to look at the early galleons to see if they retain any features of the caravelle. james willis aka not james wilson lol lizzie\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
