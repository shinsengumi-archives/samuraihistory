I am trying to get caught up on my \nlist-reading, and am doing a fairly bad job.  Maybe when winter break \ncomes...\n\nAnyway, my understanding is that what later becomes referred to as Bushido \nhas many precursors that appeared prior to _Hagakure_.  It is a little out \nof my period, but I recall that Yamaga Soko (1622-1685) wrote a treatise (or \nportion thereof) that was entitled &quot;shido&quot;.  In it he sets out what he \nbelieves to be the correct comportment of a member of the samurai class.\n\nApart from these all-encompassing &quot;this is what a warrior is (or should be)&quot; \ntype of texts, there are many ways in which warrior ideals were disseminated \nand/or propaganidized.  Not the least of which would have been the war tales \n-- albeit, as originally oral tales meant for nonliterate audiences.  Also, \nmany high-ranking warrior leaders from the Kamakura era onward wrote buke \nkakun &quot;warrior house codes&quot; which were short treatises usually with a target \naudience of the writer&#39;s successor/descendants as well as the higher ranking \nretainers.  This is not to suggest, however, that there was anywhere near a \nconsensus as to &quot;a warrior is X type of person, dresses in Y type of \nclothing, and comports himself in Z manner&quot;, and as such no tidy overarching \nideal of a samurai to which all aspired.  So the kakun, although exhibiting \nsome similarities to one another, really reflected the inidividual \npredilections of the author and to some extent the prevailing beliefs of the \ntime period in which they were written.\n\nAn example of this is that the kakun from the early Medieval period often \nstressed the importance of samurai improving their ability in letters \n(writing, music, poetry, etc.)  This was likely due to the fact that the \nwarriors (mostly from the Eastern part of Japan) were coming into increasing \ncontact with the people of high breeding from Kyoto and found their \nabilities in this area lacking. As the courtiers had had a monopoly on \ngovernmental positions until the Kamakura period, their tastes and \nrefinements were, to a certain extent synonymous with governmental \nauthority.  The case is drastically different as regards kakun from the \nGekokujo period (1467 onward), at least as far as those written by samurai \nthat held court rank.  These men were highly literate and as such were not \nconcerned with whether their kids could read or write.  These house codes \nare much more pragmatic in tone and generally deal with issues of immediate \nconcern to the preservation of the &quot;clan&quot; and its territories .\n\nSo I guess, my points for this rant are as follows.  1) There were certainly \nprecursors to the ideals set forth in Hagakure, those from the period \nimmediately preceeding it being the closest in both form and tone.  2) There \nwas some sense of a warrior identity as far back as the Kamakura period, but \nits specific articulation varied by person, geography and time period.\n\nIn closing please allow me to aopologize for the incomplete reference, but I \nam currently at &quot;work&quot; and dont have access to my files.  I will look into \nthe Yamaga Soko thing and will try to send more complete info in a day or \ntwo.\n\nShannon\n\n\nPS - Might be a good idea to check out the kakun translated in _Ideals of \nthe Samurai_ by William Scott Wilson\n\nFrom: golfmandan@...\nReply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] New Member Arrival\nDate: Sun, 07 Dec 2003 19:03:47 +0000\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nX-Sender: golfmandan@...\nReceived: from n36.grp.scd.yahoo.com ([66.218.66.104]) by \nmc9-f15.hotmail.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC(5.0.2195.6713); Sun, 7 Dec 2003 \n11:56:39 -0800\nReceived: from [66.218.66.97] by n36.grp.scd.yahoo.com with NNFMP; 07 Dec \n2003 19:56:22 -0000\nReceived: (qmail 31749 invoked from network); 7 Dec 2003 19:56:17 -0000\nReceived: from unknown (66.218.66.167)  by m14.grp.scd.yahoo.com with QMQP; \n7 Dec 2003 19:56:17 -0000\nReceived: from unknown (HELO n7.grp.scd.yahoo.com) (66.218.66.91)  by \nmta6.grp.scd.yahoo.com with SMTP; 7 Dec 2003 19:56:16 -0000\nReceived: from [66.218.67.253] by n7.grp.scd.yahoo.com with NNFMP; 07 Dec \n2003 19:56:16 -0000\nReceived: (qmail 18459 invoked from network); 7 Dec 2003 19:03:48 -0000\nReceived: from unknown (66.218.66.167)  by m18.grp.scd.yahoo.com with QMQP; \n7 Dec 2003 19:03:48 -0000\nReceived: from unknown (HELO mtiwmhc12.worldnet.att.net) (204.127.131.116)  \nby mta6.grp.scd.yahoo.com with SMTP; 7 Dec 2003 19:03:48 -0000\nReceived: from 204.127.135.43 ([204.127.135.43])          by \nworldnet.att.net (mtiwmhc12) with SMTP          id \n&lt;2003120719034711200isv5ue&gt;; Sun, 7 Dec 2003 19:03:47 +0000\nReceived: from [67.248.208.87] by 204.127.135.43;Sun, 07 Dec 2003 19:03:47 \n+0000\nX-Message-Info: JGTYoYF78jHCPzkI8jVDS+k852q45yDk\nX-eGroups-Return: \nsentto-2247946-2689-1070826979-rntihg=hotmail.com@...\nX-eGroups-Return: golfmandan@...\nX-Apparently-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nMessage-Id: &lt;120720031903.13979.3501@...&gt;\nX-Mailer: AT&T Message Center Version 1 (Oct 10 2003)\nX-Authenticated-Sender: Z29sZm1hbmRhbkBhdHQubmV0\nX-eGroups-Remote-IP: 204.127.131.116\nX-Yahoo-Profile: twheels2many\nX-eGroups-Approved-By: kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; via \nweb; 07 Dec 2003 19:56:15 -0000\nX-eGroups-Remote-IP: 66.218.66.91\nMailing-List: list samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com; contact \nsamuraihistory-owner@yahoogroups.com\nDelivered-To: mailing list samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nPrecedence: bulk\nList-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nReturn-Path: \nsentto-2247946-2689-1070826979-rntihg=hotmail.com@...\nX-OriginalArrivalTime: 07 Dec 2003 19:56:39.0365 (UTC) \nFILETIME=[3A5FE750:01C3BCFC]\n\nHey Angry Lllama\n\nThat is true what you said about the hagakure being a rather late \ndevelopment (1716), but I\nfigure Yamamoto Tsunetomo was &quot;standing on the shoulders&quot; of those who went \nbefore him.\nTo say that there was no bushido before 1716... is it really fair to claim \nthat? Just because it\nwasn&#39;t written down? Sure, it may have varied from region to region and era \nto era, but the\nsamurai as a caste surely had a set of expectations or ethics - whether \nself-imposed or\nimposed by others. If I&#39;m way off base, let me know. Related to this, I&#39;d \nlike to know: is there\nany evidence for &quot;bushido&quot; prior to the Hagakure? What are the other main \npieces of samurai\nliterature?\n\nThanks.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWonder if the latest virus has gotten to your computer?
