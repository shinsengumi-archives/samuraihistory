And yes, it was Yoshitsune.\nG:  Thank you.\n Does anybody\n&gt; better-informed than I am happen to\n&gt; recall these books, and have any views on their\n&gt; historical value?\n\nDon&#39;t know that I&#39;m better informed, but I recall\nreading one at one point. It was decent fiction, but\nhistorically....um, it was decent fiction with a\nhistorical background, how&#39;s that?\nNate\nG:  That would be better than most, but not suited for Thomas&#39;s list, is how\nthat sounds to me.   (By the way, all, I&#39;m starting to identify my comments\nwith an initial initial, because I don&#39;t like the way some of my posts come\nacross:  it&#39;s hard to tell who&#39;s said what.  I conceive that this may\nclarify things a trifle.  If what it does instead is irritate or confuse,\nlet me know.)\nGereg\n\n\n\n\n\n"
