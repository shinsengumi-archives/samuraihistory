His love \nand ability for the arts.  I have seen some of his artwork and carvings they are \nbeautiful..  \n\nI think that someone in this forum turned me on to a webpage; that has some \nof these things on it and there are also some in a version of The book of five \nrings.  which I plan on reading again soon..  \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
