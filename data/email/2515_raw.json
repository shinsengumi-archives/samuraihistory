For a long time, &quot;tachi&quot; seems to have been the \ngeneric word for sword. It wasn&#39;t until much later (probably no earlier than the \n15th C.) that the samaurai began to wear upside-down swords thrust through their \nsashes like they occasionally did with shorter weapons.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
