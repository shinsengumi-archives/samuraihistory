Was Ox North? Thanks-K&K\n\nSorry I got carried away with my answer, but hopefully you&#39;ll find it\nall useful:\n\nThe same 12 animals as used in the zodiac and for marking the hours of\nthe day were used for directions as follows:\n\n1st direction/hour Rat = nezumi = north = 23:00-01:00 (midnight @ 00:00)\n2nd direction/hour = ox = ushi = 01:00-03:00\nox/tiger = ushi tora = north east = 03:00\n3rd hour = tiger = tora = 03:00-05:00\n4th hour = rabbit = usagi = east = 05:00-07:00 (sunrise @ 06:00)\n5th hour = dragon = tatsu = 07:00-09:00\ndragon/snake = tatsu hebi = south east 09:00\n6th hour = snake = hebi = 09:00-11:00\n7th hour = horse = uma = south = 11:00-13:00 (midday = 12:00)\n8th hour = sheep (not goat) = hitsuji = 13:00-15:00\nsheep/monkey = hitsuji saru = south west 15:00\n9th hour =  monkey = saru = 15:00-17:00\n10th hour = garden bird (rooster) = niwa tori (sometimes just &quot;tori&quot;) =\nwest = 17:00-19:00 (sunset @ 18:00)\n11th hour = dog = inu = 19:00-21:00\ndog/boar = inu inoshishi = north west 21:00\n12th hour = boar = inoshishi = 21:00-2300\n\nOkay when folks say &quot;at the hour of the X&quot;, what they mean is the mid-\npoint of that time slot. So the hour of the rat is in fact midnight. But\nyou also get &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; rat. Its important to note that the\ntimes specified above only apply at the spring and summer equinoxes, as\nthe day and the night were divided in to 6 equal &quot;hours&quot;. Which means\nthat at mid-summer the daylight hours were twice as long as the nightime\nones! Actually the easier way to grasp this system, is to forget the\nnumbers above and simply go outside and look up at the daytime sky. Then\ndivide the path of the sun&#39;s travel across it from sunrise to sunset as\nthough it were super-imposed upon the top half of an old style clock\nface. Sunrise as the middle of the hour of the rabbit, midday is the\nmiddle of the hour of the horse, and sunset is the middle of the hour of\nthe bird. The others just slot in between (one and two thirds up the\ncurve of the sky). The hour of the rabbit actually starts with the first\nlight of the day (morning twilight) and the hour of the bird ends with\nthe last light of the day (evening twilight).\n\nAgain I hope all this stuff helps\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\n\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n"
