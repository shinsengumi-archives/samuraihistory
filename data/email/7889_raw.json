We&#39;re not talking pulp history\nhere. When I say &quot;History Book&quot;, Osprey (no offense\nTony) is on the low end of that spectrum. Turnbull&#39;s\nediting errors alone clearly put them into question at\ntimes--you&#39;ve really got to read and evaluate. We&#39;re\ntalking things that researchers are writing, who look\nat primary sources. Sansom, Sadler, Farris, Varley,\nKeene, etc...this is what we mean by &#39;History&#39;. (Okay,\nI&#39;ll include Bryant, so he doesn&#39;t hurt me.) As much\nas I love Rekishi Gunzo, it&#39;s pulp history--a recent\ncopy about ninja made me gag. \n\n&gt; Nina wrote:\n&gt; How many times have you read history books that, for\n&gt; instance, state \n&gt; that\n&gt; &quot;the following IS the story of the 47 Ako ronin&#39;s\n&gt; revenge&quot; and then \n&gt; read a\n&gt; description that is full of suppositions,\n&gt; assumptions, unfounded facts.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Not in many many years.\n\nHere here. Nina, Nina--that reads like the intro to a\ntabloid or a murder mystery, not a history book. Pulp\nhistory, if anything. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Nina wrote:\n&gt; I don&#39;t \n&gt; know how\n&gt; many contrasting and conflicting &quot;historical&quot;\n&gt; accounts of the revenge \n&gt; of the\n&gt; 47 ronin that I&#39;ve read in who knows how many\n&gt; history books.\n\nGOOD history books would acknowledge the lack of\nfacts, present several of the most likely/commonly\nrelated theory, and go from there. \n\n&gt; Nina wrote:\n&gt; There really isn&#39;t any problem with historical\n&gt; writers doing some \n&gt; &quot;filling\n&gt; in&quot; with suppositions and assumptions when actual\n&gt; sources aren&#39;t \n&gt; available.\n&gt; If a writer is actually trying to write a correct\n&gt; account, then he/she \n&gt; will\n&gt; tell us that the account that has been written is\n&gt; speculative. What is\n&gt; probably the best way to tell us about a certain\n&gt; event is to present \n&gt; several\n&gt; versions that could be deducted from what empirical\n&gt; facts are available \n&gt; and\n&gt; then discuss which version makes the most sense to\n&gt; the writer.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Indeed.\nThirded. And any good, credible historian would be\ndoing this. \n\n\n&gt; Nina wrote:\n&gt; But in my experience, most history writers don&#39;t do\n&gt; this. Instead, they\n&gt; present a single version of an event as THE FACTS.\n&gt; And thus there are \n&gt; about\n&gt; 50 or so &quot;factual&quot; versions (at least) in several\n&gt; &quot;history&quot; books of \n&gt; how the\n&gt; dispute between Lord Asano and Lord Kira took place,\n&gt; what caused Lord \n&gt; Asano\n&gt; to draw his sword, what happened afterward, how the\n&gt; 47 Ako retainers who\n&gt; planned an attack on Kira actually accomplished\n&gt; this, what happened \n&gt; after\n&gt; the attack, etc.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; I am not sure if I mentioned it in my last post, but\n&gt; what you say here \n&gt; is one of the difficulties that I see in narrative\n&gt; histories.  It is \n&gt; incredibly difficult from extant textual sources to\n&gt; give an account of \n&gt; any event -- complex or otherwise -- that reads like\n&gt; a novel or other \n&gt; type of fiction.  That kind of detail either doesn&#39;t\n&gt; make it into \n&gt; documents (official documents and contracts), or is,\n&gt; as you have \n&gt; pointed out, unreliable (diaries, parodies).  So,\n&gt; while I am interested \n&gt; in the incident of the 47 ronin and the fascination\n&gt; that it holds as a \n&gt; bit of cultural legacy, I wouldn&#39;t expect an\n&gt; historical account to be \n&gt; able to provide me with he-said/she-said kind of\n&gt; details.  Who said \n&gt; what to whom and how 47 guys planned a &#39;secret&#39;\n&gt; attack, nearly 4 \n&gt; centuries ago is (and should be) beyond the powers\n&gt; of historiography.\nPut down the Turnbull, and slowly back away. \n\nThis has turned into a criticism of history work,\nwhich is fine. Unfortunately, I&#39;m at a loss as to why\nit became this. My statements were originally to the\neffect that fiction is fiction, history is history,\nand that if you want the facts of history, go study\nhistory. The only argument to that that I can see\nwould be the opposite: historical facts are better\nfound in fiction than in history books. Is this what\nyou, Nina, and you, Onnagozen, are indeed saying? Can\nyou please explain how in the world you would reach\nthis conclusion? I think it&#39;s fairly cynical (and\ntrust me, I&#39;m as cynical as they come, so you can\nimagine my shock) to say that watching a move would\nteach you more about actual, factual history than\nopening a history book would. While today&#39;s kids may\nembrace that method of teaching, personally, I&#39;d be\nhorrified if for history class everyday my kids\nchucked the textbooks and popped in &quot;Gone with the\nWind&quot; to learn about the US Civil War. As much as I\nlove Taiga Drama, I don&#39;t see Japanese students\nwatching &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; as definitive fact of the rise of\nToyotomi. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
