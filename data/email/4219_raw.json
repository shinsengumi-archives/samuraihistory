But get the Norton Paperback \nversion.  From what I understand, it&#39;s the first American edition to include the \nentire book.  For some reason known only to God Himself, the FIRST American \nedition (the one Kubrick&#39;s adaptation is based on) left off the last chapter.\n       I did rent Kubrick&#39;s ACO for my dad when I worked there, but he didn&#39;t \ncare for it.  As I said, not being a movie fan (aside from the occasional), \nI&#39;ve not seen it, but I may buy the DVD someday just to have it.  And who \nknows, I may watch it someday.  :-)  And even like it as much as the book.  :-)\n\nL8r\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
