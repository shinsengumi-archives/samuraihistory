But, as for your response, I do\nnot know where to start to touch if I am a surgeon to\noperate on the patient.\n\nTo make things clearer, the framework I placed in the\ndistinction and the interaction among Taoism,\nConfucianism, and Buddihism has been quite\nconventional and been well known facts among scholars\nin the continent. \nIt is just not known to the Western scholars because\nmost of sources were written for people who are\nfamiliar with the Chinese literature. Let&#39;s consider\nyour case:\n\n&gt; Where is your sources?\n&gt; Had ye at LEAST studyed anything about japanese\n&gt; buddhism?\nWhat is the meaning of the &#39;Japanese&#39; Buddhism? Can we\ntalk about the Japanese Buddhism without linking to\nChina or India? \nYes, we can, but depending on the specificis of\nanalysis on the given topics, we leave out China or\nIndia. So, given the scopes of studies, we can\nformulate the wide, intermediate, and the short ranged\nanalytical scopes. \nIf we say that the studies of the Japanese Buddhism\nincluding India and China are the wide-ranged studies,\nwe may say that studies leaving out India, but\nincluding China are the intermediate ranged studies. \nMy argument becomes clearer if you superimpose this\nintermediate scope on your mind, which probabiliy\nrequires the understanding of the &#39;theoretical&#39; Taoism\nand Confucianism in addition to the &#39;Japanese&#39;\nBuddhism.(Mere understaning or reading of primitive\nTaosim and Confucianism books would not help as I\npointed out before)\n\n&gt; Yes, taoism had an influence in japanese culture,\n&gt; but buddhism is another\n&gt; case.\nCan we discuss the Japanese culture without Buddhism?\nYes, we can. But, as I said, it depends on your scope\nof analysis.\n\n&gt; Your information is incorrect, specially if ye take\n&gt; in an absolute degree.\nI never draw my argument in an absolute degree.\nHowever, I was absolute in my scope of observation.\n\n&gt; We can say at certain points that in popular sence,\n&gt; due to the Shinbutsu\n&gt; Shugo historical phenomena, there was some\n&gt; syncretisms between buddhism and\n&gt; shindo (way of the gods, the indigenous faith of\n&gt; japan, also know as\n&gt; shintoism) \nTrue. But in the sense of short-ranged(not meant for\nany negative sense) studies on &#39;Pure&#39;(if any) Japanese\nBuddihism. (I do not need to reiterate that it is the\nrelative judgement)\n\n&gt; If you read the Shingon-shu founder Kubo Daishi\n&gt; K�kai Great Treatise about\n&gt; the three religions, including Buddhism, Taoism and\n&gt; Confucionism, you would\n&gt; see his great knowledge about these three\n&gt; philosofical systems, but showing\n&gt; Buddhism as supperior, so discouraging mixes and\n&gt; saladas\nEven on the continent(China and Korea), there were\n&#39;mixes and saladas&#39;. But, it simply looked like it\nwhen we did not make a rigid distinction between\nBuddhism and &#39;Folk&#39; Buddhism. Recall that many of\ncommon people in the North Asis were illiterate\nwhereas the nobility class exhibited intelligence of\nhigh complexity and rigor until the modernization\nperiod.\n\nLastly, what is the meaning of these?\n&gt; Are you nuts Mr Lee?\n&gt; study more before saying ignorant things about\n&gt; Japan.\nMy current research area is on quantum mechanics and\nit application to social sciences. I have been working\nlately until last Friday night and opened your message\nnow.\nDo you think that I should be &#39;nice&#39; with you?\n\nI remind you that I once told that if you had any\npersonal stuff with me, you&#39;d better email me\ndirectly.\n\n\n\n\n                         c.s.\n\n\n--- Me�al Mikit St�r-ljon Oddhinsson\n&lt;medhal8@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Are you nuts Mr Lee?\n&gt; Where is your sources?\n&gt; Had ye at LEAST studyed anything about japanese\n&gt; buddhism?\n&gt; \n&gt; With the exception of the Nichiren Shoshu (Not\n&gt; Nichiren Shu), that I will\n&gt; give no comments for politeness reasons...\n&gt; \n&gt; Your information is incorrect, specially if ye take\n&gt; in an absolute degree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, taoism had an influence in japanese culture,\n&gt; but buddhism is another\n&gt; case.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can say at certain points that in popular sence,\n&gt; due to the Shinbutsu\n&gt; Shugo historical phenomena, there was some\n&gt; syncretisms between buddhism and\n&gt; shindo (way of the gods, the indigenous faith of\n&gt; japan, also know as\n&gt; shintoism) like the Shichifukujin, in special the\n&gt; Daikokuten, that is a\n&gt; translation of the sanskrit Mah�kala, a wrathful war\n&gt; deity, called to fight\n&gt; evil spirits, grant victory against evil enemies,\n&gt; and to ensure prosperity\n&gt; with an image of an shinto god of weathiness whose\n&gt; name is something like\n&gt; &quot;...onushin no kami&quot; or something like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you read the Shingon-shu founder Kubo Daishi\n&gt; K�kai Great Treatise about\n&gt; the three religions, including Buddhism, Taoism and\n&gt; Confucionism, you would\n&gt; see his great knowledge about these three\n&gt; philosofical systems, but showing\n&gt; Buddhism as supperior, so discouraging mixes and\n&gt; saladas.\n&gt; \n&gt; He went to China, to receive the transmission of the\n&gt; Tantric Vajrayana\n&gt; Buddhism from Hui-kwo, who received from\n&gt; Subhakarasimha, who have a direct\n&gt; lineage to Nagarjuna himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; The same happens with the Zen (chinese: Chaan\n&gt; Sanskrit: Dhyana) Shu\n&gt; buddhism. They have a direct linneage of tranmission\n&gt; direct from\n&gt; Boddhidharma who also transmitted the Bodhisattva\n&gt; Vajramukti that is the\n&gt; root of the majority of several asiatic martial\n&gt; systems, including Karate\n&gt; whose movements are based on the paterns of the\n&gt; Maha-Mandala that is the\n&gt; embodyment of the three holy bodies of Dai-nichi\n&gt; Nyorai (Maha Vairocana\n&gt; Tathag�ta) and Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni Tathag�ta).\n&gt; \n&gt; study more before saying ignorant things about\n&gt; Japan.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was a Mikkyo follower, including Shugendo, for\n&gt; several years in my past,\n&gt; and even if no longer a buddhist, I still respect\n&gt; this way due to their\n&gt; tolerance towards others religions, unlike certain\n&gt; ones that promoted a real\n&gt; bloodshed in Europe, Japan, Brazil, etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; Octavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\n&gt; S�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Message: 10\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 4 Feb 2004 02:58:59 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;    From: Lee Changsub &lt;knorr31@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: One minor point\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Group:\n&gt; I often have read discussions involving Buddihism as\n&gt; a\n&gt; part of the Japanese culture.\n&gt; With regard to the connection of the Japanese\n&gt; Buddhism\n&gt; to that of India, South Asia, and Tibet, I want to\n&gt; point out that they are significantly different.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Japanese Buddism results from intellectual\n&gt; interaction among Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism\n&gt; itself throughout centuries, the first two of which\n&gt; did not really have much effect on India, South\n&gt; Asia,\n&gt; and Tibet.\n&gt; Through this interaction, primitive Taoism and\n&gt; Confucianism was reborn as more subtle and complex\n&gt; philosophy with rigorous logical structures in 5 and\n&gt; 12 centuries respectivly.As for the proper\n&gt; terminology\n&gt; for the present Taoism and Confuncianism for the\n&gt; Westerners, I personally think that words like\n&gt; &#39;Theoretical&#39; Taoism and Confuciansim would suit.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is one of reasons why I think that we need to\n&gt; consider having a distinctly different cultural\n&gt; classification covering Japan, China, and\n&gt; Korea.(something like North Asia or North East Asia)\n&gt; This may be one of fertile area of research for\n&gt; Western scholars for the coming years.
