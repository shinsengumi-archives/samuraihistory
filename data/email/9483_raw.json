Here \n&#39;tis:-\n\nWhat year is Inu yasha laid in? I mean I know it&#39;s the warring states era \ntwixt 1500 and 1600 something but is it before Sekigahara in 1600, the Osaka \nbattle in 1604, the uniting of the clans in 1615 (Tokogowa era) or is it \nearlier or later than that? The only clue seems to be that in the eppy about \nthe Toad Prince the kid NobuNaga (Kag thinks he&#39;s &#39;the&#39; NobuNaga) may the \nyoung warlord himself. He could be unrelated or a descendant or even an \nancestor of old NN. Anyone know for sure when IY is set? I say around 1550 \nwhen the seven samurai were prevalent. I believe Kurogawa did in fact base \nhis 7 Samurai fim and later the Samurai 7 anime on a real life incident in \nhistory. By the way the Risen 7 leader Bankotsu is voiced by Matt Hill. He&#39;s \nbest known as the voices of Eddie and Big Ed on the cartoon shows Ed, Edd \nand Eddie. The gal doing Jakotsu&#39;s voice is familiar and I know her name but \ncannot place her in any animes I&#39;ve seen. Any help greatly appreciated as \nMom is sure that IY is laid after Demon Eyed Kyo (Samurai Deeper Kyo). \nToodles-K&K\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWatch free concerts with Pink, Rod Stewart, Oasis and more.
