Can anyone tell me what Kiyomori&#39;s \n&gt; parents address him as? It sounds like Heita: is this a title (eldest son??) \n&gt; or a family name?\n\nThe oldest son is usually named (in the family) as Ichiro or Taro. To this is \noften added a sort of protheme that is either auspicious (Dai=big, Kin=gold, \nRyu=dragon) or showing attachment to one of the ancient houses (Tou=Fujiwara, \nGen=Minamoto, Kitsu=Tachibana)... in this case, it&#39;s &quot;Hei&quot; for Taira, and the \n&quot;-ro&quot; is dropped. Essentially, its his name for use within the family and by \nclose childhood friends.\n\n&gt; Incidentally, with reference to a couple of other threads, the word used \n&gt; in this film for clan is &quot;ichimon&quot; and what is translated in the subtitles \n&gt; as &quot;samurai&quot; seems to be invariably &quot;bushi.&quot;\n\nIchimon is the common word translated as &quot;clan&quot; these days.\n\n&gt; I thought Kurosawa might have been responsible for popularising \n&gt; samurai as a word in the West, but in fact the early writers like Satow \n&gt; and Mitford (1870s) all use it as a term for the daimyo&#39;s retainers, and \n&gt; already seem to invest it with a great deal of romantic feeling (see \n&gt; Tales of Old Japan and A Diplomat in Japan) which they presumably \n&gt; picked up from contemporary Japanese. I don&#39;t know enough about \n&gt; Edo period to know how the two words were used then and what \n&gt; difference there was. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nThere was no difference. Bushi just sounded more fancy, being a Sino-Japanese \nword -- much as an Englishman who&#39;s a knight might like to style himself as a \nchevalier.\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
