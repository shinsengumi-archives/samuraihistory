I am very much interested in Japanese history and I look forward to \nlearning all I can on the subject. To keep this on topic, who do you think was the most tallented general in the Korean\ninvasions.........my vote is for Kato Kiyomasa. I would be interested to here your views on the subject.\n\nBest Regards Dave \n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
