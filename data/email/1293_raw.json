It&#39;s a \ngood read if mostly nonsense, although some find it insulting \nand playing up to the idea of the &#39;exotic orient&#39;.\n\nIeyasu was a very patient, vcery diplomatic, very skillful \nleader who knew his own mind and exactly what he wanted and \nhow he was going to do it.\n\nHistory suggests he would listen at length to the council of \nhis hatamoto, and then do precisely what he intended all along. \nWhilst he and Adams did become friends of sorts, I reckon it \n\nwas always on the basis that Adams was such an outsider that he \ncould pose no threat as such. I doubt whether Adams ever got a \ngrip of the convoluted politics of Sengoku Japan, let alone the \ndeeper workings of Ieyasu&#39;s mind. \n\nRegardless of what Adams thought of the Jesuits, Ieyasu played \nhis own game, and if anything Adams would have supplied the \ninformation Ieyasu wanted to make a case for or against.\n\nIn short, his closest retainers rarely knew what was in his \nmind, and I doubt any opinion Adams might have held would have \nswayed him one iota.\n\nAs far as I know, Adams was the only foreigner to make the rank \nof samurai, let alone hatamoto.\n\nIf you&#39;re really interested get hold of &quot;The Needle-Watcher&quot; by\nRichard Blaker, a fictional biography of Adams and much, much \nmore accurate.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n"
