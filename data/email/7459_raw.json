In the section \n&gt; called &quot;Ueda Castle&quot;, on page 43 the sentence reads\n&gt; &quot;He was under \n&gt; orders to &quot;mask&quot; the loyalist stronghold of Ueda\n&gt; castle...&quot;.  I have an \n&gt; idea what is meant by bask but could anyone (author\n&gt; included) clarify \n&gt; that term for me?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, the Sanada Masayuki is the same as the Takeda\n&gt; general... correct?\n\n&quot;Masking&quot; is the same as &quot;guarding&quot; or &quot;covering&quot; in a\nmodern military doctrinal context--the idea was to\nleave a force strong enough to prevent the Sanada from\nleaving Ueda Castle and attacking the the Tokugawa\nmain bottle in the rear.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
