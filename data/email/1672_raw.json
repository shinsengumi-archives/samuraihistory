There were so many people\ncoming into Japan at that time as well as quite a few Japanese travelling\nlegally and illegally to America and Europe. Also Japan was fairly well\ninformed of outside events during the saikoku period thanks to the Dutch.\nThe Uyehara book was quite interesting discussing the different western\npolitical theories debated in the Meiji period. George Sansoms Japan and the\nWestern World was quite good on this general topic as well\n\n\n"
