Whether Gothic or Maximilian,  German or Italian \n&gt; or French, the armourers seemed to take more care in what we would call the \n&gt; ergonomics of armor than did their contemporaries in Japan.  If one studies \n&gt; merely the arm defenses of both knight and samurai...not getting into the \n&gt; technical terms French or Japanese..it seems apparent (at least to me)  that there \n&gt; was more technical sophistication, including armpit armor,  in the armor shops \n&gt; of Augsburg than in Sakai.  Of course, the question arises also did Japan have \n&gt; the mineral resources to produce all the steel armor  that Europe had?  Jack\n\nSpeaking as one who&#39;s worn both types of armour, I can see little difference \nwhen it comes to the armpit. Both European and Japanese were exposed there, so \nboth had alternate methods of dealing with it; the Japanese had the manjuwa or \nwakibiki worn under the armour, and the Europeans had arming doublets with \nintegral mail gussets.\n\nI assure you: if articulation is important, you can&#39;t articulate better than a \ncloth foundation. The difference is the amount of *solid* protection on the \nsleeves. European were solid, with upper and lower canons and articulated elbow \ncops, while the Japanese didn&#39;t provide the same amount of solid protection. \nIt&#39;s an exchange: the Japanese as a rule was looser and provided a far greater \nrange of motion, while the European was more protective and in all but the \nhighest quality suits a slightly restricted range of motion.\n\nWere I fighting Europeans, I&#39;d prefer their armour; but fighting the Japanese, \nI&#39;d prefer *theirs*. They were each admirably suited to the milieu in which they \nwere used.\n\n(But, yeah, Augsburg armourers made *damn* nice looking stuff!)\n\nTony\n\n\n"
