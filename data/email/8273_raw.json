Otherwise, you will not be taken seriously. Many posters come\nfrom non-English speaking countries, and English is not their native\nlanguage--we are fully accepting of your mistakes, because you try. I&#39;m\ncertainly not capable of typing in Spanish or Russian, so I won&#39;t criticize\nyour efforts in English. Likewise for posters who have handicaps such as\ndyslexia. If someone doesn&#39;t fall into these categories and writes they&#39;re\non a Teen Beat L33t message board, most of the serious regulars will assume\nyou are 12 years old. If you are not, then the moderators will not take your\nquestion seriously if you don&#39;t take things like spelling &quot;samurai&quot; (it&#39;s\nnot samuria, saumari, or any other variation I&#39;ve seen in the last few days)\nseriously. \n\nLaziness isn&#39;t an excuse. \n\n--The Mgmt. \n\n\nI think laziness is not their excuse but mistype is. If you type samurai\nusing ten fingers fast, sometimes you mistype samurai as samuria. :-) I\nsometimes do, but not in this group as I can recall. But if the poster type:\n&quot;wat do u lik about teh samuria???&quot;, that&#39;s another case :-)\n\nTotok S\n\n\n\n\n\n"
