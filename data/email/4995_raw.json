It is easy to fall into the trappings of romanticism with \nsomething like seppuku.  The seppuku I described was, as taught to be, the \nway it would be done given the best possible situation.  High ranking \nofficial given the opportunity to have a kaishaku.\n  I would love to discuss the philosophy (or lack thereof) in seppuku with \nyou if you feel up to it.\n\nLillith,\n\n  The only time I have ever heard of leaving the small piece of tissue is so \nthat, once the head has flopped over, it can be cut and the head will fall \ninto the lap of the one committing seppuku making for a very &quot;clean&quot; and \norderly seppuku.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page ï¿½ FREE \ndownload! http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
