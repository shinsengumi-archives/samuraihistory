Since it \nwas during the bakumatsu it still, techincally, involves samurai but I do \nnot think Okita (the character I admire from this story) himself was a \nsamurai which is why I did not vote for him in the famous/favorite samurai \npoll.  The part of the event that captures my attention is the actions of \nOkita Souji, first squad leader of the Shinsengumi.  He was in his very \nearly 20s, mayhaps even late teens, when he participated in that raid.  He \nhad been suffering from tubercluosis for years but had kept it hidden from \nall but the highest members of the Shinsengumi.  He fought that night and \nmanaged to survive unharmed up until he took out his last opponent.  From \nwhat I understand after he delivered the killing blow he coughed up a \nsubstantial amount of blood and proceeded to pass out.\n  Call it what you will.  Bushido.  Honor.  Loyalty.  Whatever.  I call it \nbeing a man.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nMatt\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page ï¿½ FREE \ndownload! http://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"
