An\n&gt; exact\n&gt; source and names could I not find it. But, I found\n&gt; the\n&gt; picture at\n&gt; http://www.dkbnews.com/img/2005/03/123/w1.jpg.\n&gt; \n&gt; The picture is pretty accurate in a description of\n&gt; the\n&gt; weaponery and battle uniforms of two countries\n&gt; during\n&gt; the war.\n&gt; \n&gt; This picture describes the battle where Admiral Lee\n&gt; Sun-Shin defeated 136 ships with only 12 ships\n&gt; immediately after a major defeat of the Korean Navy\n&gt; under another Korean Admiral with Admiral Lee\n&gt; himself\n&gt; imprisoned due to the political attack against him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although I am origianlly a Korean national and am\n&gt; planning to become an American citizen, I personally\n&gt; admire the Japanese culture and outstanding martial\n&gt; tradition. \n&gt; Japanese and Koreans are most close relative to each\n&gt; other linguistically, culturally, and ethnically.\n&gt; I do believe that the prosperity of two countries\n&gt; and\n&gt; the stability of the North East Asia depends on how\n&gt; Japan and Korea cooperate and support each other\n&gt; because of their geographical proximity and ecnomic,\n&gt; poltical, and military interdependence.\n&gt; \n&gt; The past is the past. What lies ahead is our future\n&gt; and the future of our next generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;                      Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                      Changsub Lee\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
