Most likely, he would have had\n&gt; to give up some \n&gt; control or authority to please them, I dont see him\n&gt; being able to \n&gt; defeat them the way Nobunaga did, and I dont see\n&gt; them idly sitting by \n&gt; as Yoshimoto cuts into thier power and profits.\n\nWell, that&#39;s assuming Yoshimoto would have made it\npast the Saito, Rokkaku, Asai, Miyoshi, et al. But\nsaying he did, who knows? Let&#39;s remember that Nobunaga\nwasn&#39;t just occupied with war for that 10 years--he\nwas defeating people, yes, but then he was taking\ntheir lands, getting stronger, etc...conceivably, if\nYoshimoto had taken Kyoto and environs and all points\nin between, then HE would be the one getting stronger.\nAnd eventually, conceivably, he would be the one with\nthe better generals, the bigger battalions, and would\nbe able to subdue the Honganji, et al. \n\nOf course we all know that Yoshimoto was no Nobunaga,\nso it&#39;s not bloody likely. I think with no Nobunaga,\nit would have been much easier for a certain Tiger of\nKai to attack Yoshimoto from the rear and march into\nKyoto himself. And I think it&#39;s safe to assume that\nthe Takeda clan was no less talented general-wise than\nthe Oda, nor less spectacular in martial prowess. Who\nknows?\n\nI think you&#39;re point is not necessarily about\nYoshimoto, it&#39;s more that anyone stepping into the\nbreach would be hard pressed to subdue the monastic\narmies, and would be forced to compromise at some\npoint--right? I&#39;d agree that most likely WOULD\ncompromise--if the burning of Mt. Hiei was as shocking\nas the chroniclers would have us believe, then it&#39;s\nnot likely someone else would have come up with that\nextreme methodology. And being as the only other way\nwas to work with the various militant monastics, I&#39;d\nagree that would be likely. The religious groups had\nsecular power since before the Heian jidai--why stop\nthen? \n\n&gt; Maybe Japan would \n&gt; have ended up as a semi-theocracy?\n\nOkay, now you&#39;re just being silly. Not even Yoshimoto\nwould have bowed to that one. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nTake Yahoo! Mail with you!
