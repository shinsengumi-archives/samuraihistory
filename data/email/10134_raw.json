Did you enjoy  \n&gt; during you stayed in Japan ?\n&gt;\n&gt; I appreciate you a lot if you could let me know the names of Temples  \n&gt; or Shrines who became interwoven each other in Japan ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Shrines have no monks at all whatsoever as Temples have . Temples in  \n&gt; Japan ,or in China, Korea, Thailand ---- have monks always.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please remember that Shinto has nothing to do with Buddhism , since  \n&gt; the begging and untill now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please remember the God of Shinto and Buddhism is totally different.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, the different Gods of the two cannot stay in the same building.  \n&gt; Can you understand ?\n&gt;\n&gt; The religion of Yuda and the one of Christ is different. Same thing.\n&gt; Who is the God of Yuda, Mose\u001b$B!)!!!!\u001b(BWho is the God of Christ ?\n&gt;\n&gt; My final answer about religion is that you can believe your own God  \n&gt; in your heart as you like , and you don&#39;t deny any religion  \n&gt; whatsoever.\n&gt; Any way, humanbeing is so weak finally and , which being resulted in  \n&gt; that you cannot do anything but rely on some God or, the more  \n&gt; stronger sprit , or thing than you to get relief and happiness to  \n&gt; keep living.\n&gt;\n&gt; Japanese Emperors were nothing to do with Buddhism and they were  \n&gt; from the God of Shinto.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I mentioned before, Japanese people , unfortunately, believed The  \n&gt; Emperor is God and the desendants of Japanese Gods. So Japanese  \n&gt; Imperials used this concept leading to Banzai, going to death for  \n&gt; Emperor , Kamikaze. That was tragedy for Japanese. Meiji Ishin,  \n&gt; restoration was wrong\n&gt; for that point. Meiji Emperor was used by low class Bushi like  \n&gt; Sathuma, Choshu, Tosa, etc to get upset Japan with some kind of help  \n&gt; to succeed the revolution , so called, the fake revolution though I  \n&gt; say. It was not like the real revolution triggered by civilians in  \n&gt; France.\n&gt; Which means, even now Japanese government have limitted power to  \n&gt; govern Japanese people and lead to the best performance  \n&gt; politically , which resulting in maybe changing the government again  \n&gt; in the near future untill Japanese people realize what is the real  \n&gt; democracy which almost all European ,\n&gt; and Americans enjoy now, whic I predict.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I still believe that Japanese people are forwarding to the  \n&gt; same destination as the European and Americans , so do all Asians ,  \n&gt; Africans, South Americans, and in the future, all human being s will  \n&gt; get together to live and exist to enjoy mutual understanding , co-  \n&gt; prospering,\n&gt; and pease like Mr. Obama aims now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eddie\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Eddie\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nHEISEI ISSHIN!!\n\nTom Helm\ntoryu@...\n&quot;Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus&quot;\n- Vergil\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
