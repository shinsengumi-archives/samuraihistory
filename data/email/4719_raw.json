Let me parse it into three:\n\n1. Were there at any time females who, posing as men, fought in whatever manner was then practiced by samurai? The answer is very probably yes, although I do not happen to know of any specific instances. But we know that this sort of thing has been prevalent throughout history, in many different cultures.\n\n2. Was there any way that a female could be recognized as a woman legitimately entitled to wear the long and the short, dress as a samurai male, etc.? A sort of Japanese Jeanne D&#39;Arc? The answer is negative, so far as I know. It would be difficult to imagine, given Japanese gender conventions in the medieval and early modern periods, but might have been conceivable in earlier periods when women had higher and more independent status and the boundaries of the samurai class were quite elastic.\n\n3. Were females of samurai households recognized as members of the samurai class and expected and required to conduct themselves in distinctive and &quot;honorable&quot; ways? Absolutely. There was even a recognized female counterpart to seppuku, involving use of the short (shortest) sword to sever the jugular. And in certain cases female members of the samurai class could perform distinctly military functions.\n\nWill O&#39;Neil\n\nBTW, the usual plural of &quot;samurai&quot; in English is (following Japanese practice, which does not vary noun form with number) &quot;samurai&quot;, not &quot;samurais&quot; -- although &quot;samurais&quot; is not technically incorrect if you prefer it.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
