Real name&#39;s Sar=\r\na) and I am a new member to the Samurai History Group. I am very impressed =\r\nwith the knowledge of samurai and feudal history in the Archives, so I have=\r\n a few questions pertaining to Ji-samurai, the Ikki (the rebellions?) and S=\r\nousen.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think Wikipedia provides enough detail and I may be con=\r\nfused with the samurai society in particular. I am too familiar with the po=\r\npular samurai that go to the capital, and it seems that samurai are both th=\r\ne rulers of the provinces and the soldiers underneath the rulers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why/=\r\nhow were there lower-ranked rural samurai [Zi-samurai] ? And Ikki are like =\r\nthose who rebel against the Capital forces and live in rural villages (I th=\r\nink called Sousen?)? \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I find it a little hard to believe that fe=\r\nw people became samurai and I read about large armies ;) What was samurai l=\r\nife like? What did they do in an average day?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
