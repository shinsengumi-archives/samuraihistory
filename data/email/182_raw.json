It is a\nwell-established fact that Hideyoshi could never be\nshogun. You brought up about his own lineage & I can\nconfirm that not only HE but Ieyasu were not of\nMinamoto blood. Tokugawa basically threatened the life\nof the emperor into altering his lineage. Since the\nshogun was considered to be the source of all &#39;true&#39;\npower during the era, the emperor had no choice but to\nmake Tokugawa a &#39;Minamoto.&#39;\n     I find it interesting that centuries after the\ngreat Minamoto-Taira wars that people wished to use\nthese names, not only to exploit them for personal\ngain, but, also for sovereign protection. Meanwhile,\nthey clearly held no reverence for the honor which\ntheir names derive from a mere mention. Yet, it eludes\nme that Oda Nobunaga, of Taira descent did not so\nclearly connect himself with his heritage in both name\nand nostalgia. It is no wonder then that he is the\nmost famous of all Japanese, for the simple fact that\nhe is both an enigma and a wonder to us all...\n\n=====\n&quot;I am Mikhal no Shourinou, son of Toshiro of the village of Rin, and loyal retainer of the Maeda clan.
