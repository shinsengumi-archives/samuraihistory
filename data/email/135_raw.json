By the 16th Century this had become mostly honorific, \nthough certain lords carried a given governorship from generation to \ngeneration that was based in fact (such as the Shimazu of Satsuma, who were \nstyled &#39;Satsuma no kami&#39; and the So of Tsushima, who were styled &#39;Tsushima \nno kami&#39; - as well as Chosokabe Motochika, who assumed the title &#39;Tosa no \nkami&#39; after being confirmed in that province by Toyotomi Hideyoshi).  While \nany number of men in Japan might have the same title at any one time, they \ntended to be unique within a given clan - that is, and for example, Takeda \nretainer Baba Nobufusa became &#39;Mino no kami&#39; after the death of the previous \nholder of that title within the Takeda, Hara Toratane.  This occured in 1564 \n- from this point on Nobufusa is almost always described as &#39;Baba Mino&#39; or \n&#39;Baba Mino no kami&#39;.  An individual might in fact be awarded a number of &#39;no \nkami&#39;s in his life time, depending on his fortunes.  We know that, for \nexample, Hatakeyama Takamasa (1527-1576) carried the titles Kii no kami, \nHarima no kami, and Owari no kami at various points in his career.\nAnother, similar, title, was &#39;Deputy Governor&#39; - or &#39;no suke&#39;, which \napplied, among other things, to certain provinces in the Kanto (such as \nKozuke).\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"
