While he is not associated with any great University, his \nwork seems to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is not an amazing writer ( imean; his \nstyle), but he seems to be truly in love with the subject, and I really like the way he \nfills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind of (perhaps?) self-made scholarship \nis available.\nSince this is the first time I write, I was wondering what you &quot;samurai-maniacs&quot; public \nthink of Turnbull in general.\nAny book you would suggest in particular?\nThanx,\ncepo\n\n\n"
