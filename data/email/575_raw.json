I have \nbeen studying the last Samurai Rebellion (the Satsuma Reb=\r\nellion) of 1877 for \nthe past several years.\n\n    Below is a bried article =\r\nI wrote several years ago about the organization \nof the Imperial and Samur=\r\nai armies that took part in the battle.  I hope to \nexpand the article into=\r\n a booklet someday, complete with OBs and descriptions \nof the main battles=\r\n.\n\n    Bob Burke\n\n\n THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IMPERIAL AND SATSUMA ARMIES\n\n=\r\n=A9  by Robert W. Burke, Jr.            May 21, 1991\n\n        After the Res=\r\ntoration of 1868, one of the top priorities of the new \nImperial government=\r\n was the formation of a national army under its control.  \nOn October 2, 18=\r\n70, one month after the French defeat at Sedan, the \ngovernment announced t=\r\nhat its army would be modeled after the French Army \n(the announcement also=\r\n stated that the new navy would be modeled after that \nof Britain).  One of=\r\n the major considerations in choosing the French system \nover that of Pruss=\r\nia was that more Japanese military men spoke French than \nGerman.\n\n        =\r\nBy the time of the Satsuma Rebellion, the Imperial Japanese Army \nnumbered =\r\nover 34,000 men and consisted of both line and imperial guard \ntroops.  The=\r\n line infantry was divided into 14 regiments of 3 battalions \neach.  Each b=\r\nattalion consisted of 4 companies.  In peace time, each company \nhad approx=\r\nimately 160 privates and 32 officers and non-commissioned officers. \n Durin=\r\ng war time a company&#39;s strength was to be increased to 240 privates.   \nA b=\r\nattalion had 640 men in peace time and was supposed to have 960 men in war =\r\n\ntime.\n\n        There were two &quot;regiments&quot; of line cavalry and one &quot;regimen=\r\nt&quot; of \nimperial guard cavalry.  The two line regiments each contained 120 m=\r\nen in \npeace time and were to be increased to 150 men each during war time.=\r\n  \nContemporary illustrations show the cavalry armed with lances.\n\n        =\r\nThe Imperial Artillery consisted of 18 batteries divided into 9 \nbattalions=\r\n, with 120 men per battery during peace time.  During war time, the \nmounta=\r\nin artillery was supposed to have 160 men per battery and the field \nartill=\r\nery was supposed to have 130 men per battery.\n\n        Due to the suddennes=\r\ns of events in Satsuma, the line units of the \nImperial Army seem to have t=\r\naken the field at their peace time strength.\n\n        The Imperial Guard (m=\r\nost of whom were ex-samurai) was always \nmaintained at war time strength. T=\r\nhe guard infantry was divided into 2 \nregiments of 2 battalions each.  A ba=\r\nttalion was 672 men strong and was \norganized as per the line battalions.  =\r\nThe cavalry regiment consisted of 150 \nmen.   The artillery battalion was d=\r\nivided into 2 batteries with 130 men per \nbattery.\n\n        The Japanese Ar=\r\nmy did not have a brigade or corps system like the \nFrench or many other Eu=\r\nropean armies.  Japan was divided into six military \ndistricts: Tokyo (Yedo=\r\n), Sendai, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima and Kumamoto.  \nThere were usually two =\r\nor three regiments of infantry, plus artillery and \nother auxiliary troops,=\r\n assigned to each district.  The Imperial guard was \nassigned to the Tokyo =\r\ndistrict.\n\n        The uniforms of the Japanese Imperial Army resembled tho=\r\nse of the \nFrench Garde Mobile in appearance.  Japanese infantrymen wore a =\r\ndark blue \nkepi, a short jacket with French style field pack, and dark blue=\r\n pants (in \nsummer, the uniform was white).  They were armed with breechloa=\r\nding Snider \nrifles and could fire approximately six rounds per minute.  Th=\r\ne cavalry wore \nred kepis with a small white plume in the front, dark blue =\r\njackets, red pants \nwith a yellow stripe, and black boots.  At least one il=\r\nlustration shows their \nsaddle blankets as being red with yellow trim and t=\r\nheir lance pennants were \nred over white.  Artillery consisted of over 100 =\r\n\nartillery pieces, including 5.28 pound mountain guns, Krupp field guns of =\r\n\nvarious calibers, and mortars.\n\n        In addition to the army, the centr=\r\nal government also used marines and \nTokyo policemen in its struggle agains=\r\nt the Satsuma samurai.  The police were \nprimarily comprised of ex-samurai =\r\n(many of whom were from Satsuma) and were \narmed only with wooden batons an=\r\nd swords (Japanese police did not carry \nfirearms until the Rice Riots of 1=\r\n918).  The police were mobilized in units \nranging from 300 to 600 men.\n\n  =\r\n      The Satsuma samurai army was initially organized into six battalions =\r\n\n(or regiments) of 2,000 men each.  Each battalion was divided into ten \nco=\r\nmpanies of 200 men, which were further divided into four platoons of 50 \nme=\r\nn.  On its march to Kumamoto Castle, the army was divided into three \ndivis=\r\nions; an advance guard of 4,000 men, another division of 4,000 men, and \na =\r\nrearguard of 2,000 men.  There were 200 artillerymen and 1,200 laborers in =\r\n\nthe army.  In April 1877, Saigo reorganized the army into nine infantry un=\r\nits \nof 350 to 800 men each.\n\n        The samurai attempted to dress in a s=\r\nimilar manner to give the \nappearance of uniformity.  Their dress consisted=\r\n of their own clothes and \narmor was not worn, except by a few officers who=\r\n wore a breastplate.  Saigo \nand some of his officers wore their military u=\r\nniforms.  Each samurai wore a \nwhite cloth on his upper arm so that they co=\r\nuld identify themselves.\n\n        The samurai were armed with Enfield muzzl=\r\ne loading rifles and could \nfire approximately one round per minute.  Their=\r\n artillery \nconsisted of 28 mountain guns, 2 field guns (15.84 pounders), a=\r\nnd 30 assorted \nmortars.\n\n        When the students raided the Kagoshima ar=\r\nmories a large number of \nsword blades were seized.  Many of these blades w=\r\nere of inferior quality and \nwere fitted with blackened iron hilts.  The hi=\r\nlts were bound with rough braid \nor canvas.  Some samurai who later joined =\r\nthe Satsuma army may have carried \nyaris (spears).\n\n        Although the Sa=\r\ntsuma Army did not contain any cavalry, a few officers \nsuch as Saigo were =\r\nmounted.\n\n\n\n"
