Two \n&gt; different performances based on kabuki plays will be\n&gt; held during a \n&gt; 10-day period ending Jan. 16 at the Benisan Pit in\n&gt; Koto Ward, Tokyo. \n&gt; \n&gt; There will be 11 performances of Sakurahime Omoteura\n&gt; Daikitan, \n&gt; adapted by Norihiko Tsukuda. The second play,\n&gt; Kamikakete Sango \n&gt; Taisetsu (The Love-Crazed Samurai), adapted by\n&gt; Kiyokazu Yamamoto, \n&gt; will be performed three times, with subtitles in\n&gt; English (Jan. 13), \n&gt; Chinese (Jan. 15) and Russian (Jan. 16). Both plays\n&gt; are based on \n&gt; stories originally written by Tsuruya Namboku. \n&gt; \n&gt; Japan, and in particular Tokyo, boasts a large\n&gt; number of smaller \n&gt; experimental theater groups and individuals who are\n&gt; part of a \n&gt; creative underground. \n&gt; \n&gt; Led by avant-garde artists, these small theater\n&gt; movements emerged in \n&gt; the 1960s, born out of a rebellion against\n&gt; overregimented postwar \n&gt; Japanese society. Ryuzanji Company shares the\n&gt; research-oriented and \n&gt; experimental approach that characterize independent\n&gt; underground \n&gt; theater movements. \n&gt; \n&gt; Director Ryuzanji is an energetic theater artist who\n&gt; has been active \n&gt; in Japan&#39;s small theater movements since 1970. He is\n&gt; an accomplished \n&gt; actor, producer and director, having directed over\n&gt; 200 plays during \n&gt; his career, including Educating Mad Persons, written\n&gt; by Shuji \n&gt; Terayama. He started Ryuzanji Company with the\n&gt; intention \n&gt; of &quot;facilitating a horizontal affiliation among\n&gt; small theater \n&gt; activists.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Consequently, Ryuzanji Company produces performances\n&gt; using talent \n&gt; from different genres: traditional and contemporary,\n&gt; dance and \n&gt; theater. They are also active internationally, and\n&gt; in 2000 were \n&gt; awarded the grand prix &quot;Best Of Fringe&quot; for their\n&gt; performances of \n&gt; Educating Mad Persons at the Victoria Fringe\n&gt; International Theater \n&gt; Festival in Canada. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sakurahime Omoteura Daikitan is the complicated\n&gt; story of a high-\n&gt; ranking priest who, after failing to commit suicide\n&gt; with his male \n&gt; lover, falls in love with a beautiful young\n&gt; princess. Chased by the \n&gt; princess&#39; evil rogue lover, the two escape only to\n&gt; meet very \n&gt; different fates. The priest accidentally dies, and\n&gt; the princess \n&gt; becomes a prostitute for a short time. The central\n&gt; appeal of the \n&gt; play is the idea of a princess becoming a\n&gt; prostitute, which was met \n&gt; with fascination by audiences when the play was\n&gt; first performed in \n&gt; 1817. \n&gt; \n&gt; The main character in The Love-Crazed Samurai is\n&gt; taken from a famous \n&gt; kabuki play, Chushingura, which is based on one of\n&gt; Japan&#39;s most \n&gt; famous revenge vendetta episodes. The real-life\n&gt; incident took place \n&gt; in 1702, when 47 samurai avenged their master&#39;s\n&gt; death. \n&gt; \n&gt; The protagonist in The Love-Crazed Samurai is one of\n&gt; these 47 \n&gt; samurai. He is a ronin, or a samurai without a\n&gt; master, who is kicked \n&gt; out of his clan when a large sum of money is stolen\n&gt; while he is on \n&gt; guard duty. He sets about retrieving the money in\n&gt; order to regain \n&gt; his status and lead an attack upon a rival clan that\n&gt; had killed his \n&gt; master. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ryuzanji Company describes The Love-Crazed Samurai\n&gt; as a play about \n&gt; wrongdoers, the fate of men and a woman blinded by\n&gt; money and about \n&gt; men who deceive and kill each other in the\n&gt; furtherance of uchiiri, a \n&gt; justified raid for a noble cause. This play is full\n&gt; of atrocities, \n&gt; laughing at didactic stories where good always wins\n&gt; in the end. The \n&gt; Namboku world created by playwright is dry and\n&gt; vacant. Kamikakete \n&gt; Sango Taisetsu is full of wickedness and eros, and\n&gt; is a very \n&gt; modernistic play. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ryuzanji and his company believe that kabuki is &quot;the\n&gt; fountainhead of \n&gt; Japanese stage art.&quot; They are inspired by the\n&gt; parallel themes \n&gt; dealing with human interaction that exist in the\n&gt; ancient stories of \n&gt; kabuki plays and modern-day society. Written in the\n&gt; language of the \n&gt; time, kabuki plays often take many hours to perform,\n&gt; and therefore \n&gt; the adaptation process requires a reduction in\n&gt; length of the plays \n&gt; while maintaining the essence of the story itself. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;By thoroughly modernizing the language of kabuki,\n&gt; we can \n&gt; reconstruct kabuki from the Edo period (1603-1868)\n&gt; into a \n&gt; contemporary play,&quot; says Ryuzanji. He adds that\n&gt; performing a kabuki \n&gt; play written 180 years ago in the present day poses\n&gt; an inviting \n&gt; challenge as to how people today breathe life into\n&gt; words written so \n&gt; long ago. \n&gt; \n&gt; In adapting the stories, Ryuzanji has sought to\n&gt; create a unique \n&gt; style of contemporary &quot;Ryuzanji Kabuki.&quot; This he\n&gt; achieves first by \n&gt; simplifying and reducing the elaborate visual\n&gt; spectacles often found \n&gt; in kabuki plays. Second, the play is re-created\n&gt; through the combined \n&gt; effort of all the members of the ensemble. The\n&gt; result is a unique \n&gt; and entertaining style of performance in which the\n&gt; actors&#39; physical \n&gt; expression carries the story of the play. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Originally in kabuki there were no directors. The\n&gt; actors themselves \n&gt; are largely responsible for creating their own\n&gt; part,&quot; explains \n&gt; Ryuzanji. &quot;Our performances follow this example by a\n&gt; very open \n&gt; attitude to stage direction where the ideas of the\n&gt; actors, \n&gt; choreographers and musicians are all given\n&gt; consideration in the \n&gt; rehearsal process. The actors&#39; movements and\n&gt; emotional expressions \n&gt; become more important than the story itself. Our\n&gt; performances are \n&gt; experimental but at the same time very\n&gt; entertaining.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Traditional kabuki is performed only by male actors.\n&gt; Obvious \n&gt; adaptations that Ryuzanji has made in The\n&gt; Love-Crazed Samurai \n&gt; include his casting a female actress, Hiroko Ito, in\n&gt; the lead \n&gt; samurai role, and his conscious combination of\n&gt; elements from kabuki \n&gt; and the all-female Takarazuka Revue. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The main theme for both plays is war and universal\n&gt; judgment,&quot; \n&gt; Ryuzanji says. &quot;I feel that these themes can\n&gt; sometimes be more \n&gt; \n=== message truncated ===\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"
