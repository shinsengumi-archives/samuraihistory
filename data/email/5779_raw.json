There was a\ngood deal learned on my part during the research of\nthe subject, enough to the point that I didn&#39;t include\nnearly all of it for fear of making the paper too long\nand droning.  However, this good deal learned are\nthings that Katsuchiyo-sama and myself are confident\nthat we can apply to our mok combat, and thereby\npresent a more accurate and realistic account of how\nthe Japanese actually fought in battle.  I hope that\nanyone who chooses to read finds it at least somewhat\neducating on a subject that I had a good deal of\ndifficulty researching myself: Very few documents I&#39;ve\never seen even begin to approach how battle formations\nwere structured and what their purpose was.\n\nOf course, I expect there to be mistakes.  The paper\nwas thrown together in haste, and numerouse accounts\nof the same battles were referenced before deciding\nwhich ones seemed the most realiable.  Anyone who&#39;d\nlike to point anything out to me should feel free to\ndo so in the next couple of days before I leave for\nthe military.\n\nAnd on a final note, please forgive the lack of\nreferences.  I plan on adding them before I leave so\nthat the paper might be able to be displayed without\nany worries of plagarism charges, but for now I\nthought I&#39;d just represent it to the Society.  Enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
