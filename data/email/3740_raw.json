What if samurai existed simply as a non hereditary title without the sword wearing rights and stipends, as a way for Japan to bestow upon its citizens, recognition for personal acomplishments or service to the nation?\n\nDave Jackson\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Chris Ketterling \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, February 09, 2004 6:59 PM\n  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Trying to learn\n\n\n  Because the general deafening consensus is that not only are there no samurai and that it&#39;s an absurd thought to even ponder but that no one, even Japanese with samurai ancestorage would consider themselves samurai. All ties to the the class of samurai had been legally severed. Why take a chance of validating a soldier&#39;s claim to that status by bringing back the &quot;soul of the samurai&quot;? In essence the Japanese government was reinstating the rank of samurai without the class or privileges by letting them carry swords again. A person might humbly say that they are not samurai but in their heart of hearts they feel they are and that no matter what the government says they still remain samurai.\n  Now on the darker side:\n  There was a military uprising in the 1970&#39;s by a general who wanted to go back to the days of Imperial japan and reinstate the class of samurai by force. But only a handful of soldiers joined him. Everyone else shouted him down as a crazy man. He committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.\n\n  Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  --- Chris Ketterling &lt;chrisketterling1@...&gt;\n  wrote:\n  &gt; Okay, but why a Katana instead of a Calvary sword\n  &gt; like other (US) militaries. Even pilots carried\n  &gt; Katanas. \n  &gt; \n\n  Turn the question around: Why do we in the US military\n  carry cavalry sabers as our ceremonial weapons (and\n  why did they carry them back in the day when they\n  actually used them?) Because that&#39;s what we\n  used--that&#39;s what fit with our Army. Why should the\n  Japanese Army change what had worked for their culture\n  for 1000 years?\n\n  Nate\n\n  __________________________________\n  Do you Yahoo!?\n  Yahoo!
