Sign says &quot;No bathers after 21:45&quot; and &quot;No \npersons with tatoos&quot;. I always got to stay after ten on Tuesdays \nbecause like clockwork at 22:15, a young man with half-sleeve tattoo \nwould come in and take his bath. Though we were the only two people in \nthe place we never spoke, never shared the same bath and I never asked \nthe proprietess about him. I KNEW he was Yakuza full stop.\n-t\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
