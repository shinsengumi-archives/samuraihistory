I \nwould also like to put in a plug for the work of Karl Friday, specifically \n_Hired Swords: The Rise of Private Warrior Power in Japan_.  One caveat \nbeing that this book as well as the book book by William Wayne Farris deal \nprimarily with pre-Kamakura period developments.\n\n-Shannon\n\n----Original Message Follows----\nFrom: Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt;\n\nI think Paul Varley&#39;s &quot;Warriors of Japan&quot; and Wayne Ferris &quot;Heavenly\nWarriors&quot; are two other crucial works. &quot;Japan Before Tokugawa&quot; (edited\nby Hall) has a lot of great stuff as well. Of course, it all depends on\nwhat aspect of the samurai history one is interested in.\nCepo, Honolulu\n\nOn Nov 20, 2003, at 7:39 AM, murphymurphyjohn@... wrote:\n\n &gt; Welcome aboard to samurai history. The best books as introduction are\n &gt; those\n &gt; by our Anthony Bryant at Indiana University, clearly written and\n &gt; factual.\u001b$B  \u001b(B\n &gt; Dr. Turnbull has a high reputation in the field, but I deem only so\n &gt; because,\n &gt; until the advent of Tony B. he was the only one who wrote in the field\n &gt; in\n &gt; English. I have found Turnbull to be distressingly contradictory\n &gt; about the Battle\n &gt; of Nagashino, in that an important raid that Oda Nobunaga launched\n &gt; against\n &gt; Takeda Katsuyori Turnbull said in one book the raid was launched the\n &gt; night\n &gt; before the battle. In another book, he said it was the morning of the\n &gt; battle.\n &gt; Also, his research on Japanese castle sieges seems way out of line\n &gt; with the\n &gt; contemporary battle screens which depicted such sieges! Therefore, go\n &gt; by Bryant\n &gt; in your research, and keep Turnbull for the supply train.
