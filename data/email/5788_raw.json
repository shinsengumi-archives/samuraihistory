The Shogun himself is a daimyo, and he sits \nat the apex of power.\n\nThe layers beneath can be very complex. Tokugawa Ieyasu, for example, when he \nset up his shogunate, put those he wanted to keep on his side in positions of great \nwealth, whilst those he could tust, his allies from the beginning, had relatively frugal \nrewards, but were placed in positions of great strategic importance should trouble \nflare up. I would also suggest they received rewards &#39;in kind&#39; that made any sacrifice \nworthwhile.\n\nAs for middlemen - the Tokugawa house had daimyate houses who were allies from \nthe very first - Ishikawa, Sakai, Sakakibara and notably the Honda. The latter family, \nuntil they fell from grace, possessed considerable authority as middlemen between \nIeyasu and the rest, and if you fell out of favour with a middleman you might count \nyour days as numbered.\n\nPut another way - the shogun is the daimyo at the top, the daimyo at the bottom \nprobably doesn&#39;t even get a mention in the history books, and EVERY other daimyo is \nsomewhere &#39;in the middle&#39; between these two and working hard to preserve if not \nadvance his position along an often very greasy pole, whilst his every neighbour \nseeks and hopes for his dislodgement.\n\nThomas.\n\n-- \n\nWhatever you Wanadoo:\nhttp://www.wanadoo.co.uk/time/\n\nThis email has been checked for most known viruses - find out more at: http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/help/id/7098.htm\n\n"
