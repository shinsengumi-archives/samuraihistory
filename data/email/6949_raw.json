I had two choices: Takasugi Shinsaku or Kogoro Katsura.\nAt first I&#39;d rather prefear write about Kogoro Katsura but when I began the research I couldn&#39;t find almost anything about him. So I am trying to understand why this man is so less important than, for exemple Takasugi or Ryoma.\nIf someone is able to give me an answer would be nice!\nThank you!\nDaniele\n\n \n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
