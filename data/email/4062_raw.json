I think I&#39;ve only stated the obvious. It&#39;s not like I made any giant assuming leaps. First of all, I said &quot;kinda like&quot;... not EXACTLY like. Second of all, YES the military advertises itself to build up its image so it can maintain its numbers AND get more money from Congress. It&#39;s not like the two things are completely separate. Third, as for there &quot;always&quot; being a need for military... I never said there wasn&#39;t. But the need is greater or lesser at any given time when compared with other times, and certainly PERCEIVED to be greater or lesser at any given time. In a time of &quot;perceived&quot; lesser need, spending gets cut. \n\n My point was just that without all the civil wars to fight, the role of the samurai changed. \n&gt;  Kinda like for america, if we don&#39;t have any perceived military \n&gt; threats, we want to cut military spending. So what does the military \n&gt; do? Come up with all the &quot;be all you can be&quot; and &quot;army of one&quot; and \n&gt; &quot;we&#39;re looking for a few good men&quot; advertising campaigns... which \n&gt; glorifies the military in the public&#39;s eye, and gives it a purpose \n&gt; apart from war... namely the bettering of our citizens by education \n&gt; and experience. Bushido made samurai out to be &quot;honorable citizens&quot; \n&gt; or something to that effect...\n&gt; \n&gt; I have to disagree with you here.  The military does not come up with \n&gt; advertising campaigns to glorify the military in the public&#39;s eye.  \n&gt; How does spending more of the military budget on advertising give the \n&gt; military any more money.  A portion of the budget is allotted to \n&gt; recruit and retain personnel through these campaigns.  This was an \n&gt; important issue about 5 years ago.  The military branches were all \n&gt; significantly under mandated strength numbers.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to cut military spending (or more aptly if congress wants \n&gt; to do so) there isn&#39;t much the military can do about it.  Congress \n&gt; makes laws about force budgets and limitaions on force strength (the \n&gt; number of personnel in each branch).  Perception is an important \n&gt; issue and some people do percieve that we aren&#39;t in need of a \n&gt; military.  Perceptions are not always the truth.  Your perception and \n&gt; my perception may be completely different.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Relating back to the samurai, there is always a need for military \n&gt; power.  In the samurai days it may have been for civil obedience \n&gt; outside the existance of a war.  As for America&#39;s military, I&#39;d \n&gt; challenge you to name a period in recent history that they weren&#39;t \n&gt; invovled in some conflict.  U.S. forces have been reduced by more \n&gt; than half.  The military performs the same job with less people. The  \n&gt; military also serves the purpose of civil protection, aid natural \n&gt; disaster victims, and any other emergency of national or local \n&gt; importance. \n&gt; \n&gt;  The U.S. military is very different from the samurai.  Japan was \n&gt; isolated from most of the world.  By their own choice and because of \n&gt; geography.  The U.S. military deals with global issues.  A military \n&gt; dealing only with its own country&#39;s problems has different demands. \n&gt; In which case your second assertion may bear some truth.  Only some \n&gt; truth becuase I believe the samurai were in a postion like many \n&gt; dictatorships in the world.  They possessed the frightening might or \n&gt; the military and didn&#39;t require justifying themselves to the \n&gt; population they ruled.  If the peasants didn&#39;t like it; what would \n&gt; they do about it?  They odd situation with Japan is that they had 2 \n&gt; positions of power.  Shogun and Emperor.  Periods existed when the \n&gt; Emperor possessed all the power and there were times when the Emperor \n&gt; was only a puppet.  The peasants were&#39;nt the only ones who didn&#39;t \n&gt; like the system.  The Emperor didn&#39;t and he did something about it.  \n&gt; No matter how the samurai class may have been &quot;justified&quot; the Emperor \n&gt; decided that the weren&#39;t needed and that a new military needed to be \n&gt; formed to progress the nation into modern times.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Important to note that he still thought a military was important just \n&gt; not the one they had.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brandon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
