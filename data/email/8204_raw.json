I guess =\r\nI assumed if I mentioned timeline it would be enough to mean the entire his=\r\ntory of the Yoshiwara fires in Tokyo since there was more than one in the e=\r\nntire history of the Yoshiwara since its creation in the seventeenth centur=\r\ny. But again let me apologize and assure that in the future I will be more =\r\nspecific and not allow myself to assume anything when it pertains to an inq=\r\nuiry. Thank you anyway for your help in this matter. Everybody have a great=\r\n day.\n  Rod\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n  Rod--\n\nDon&#39;t tak=\r\ne this the wrong way, but there&#39;s quite a\ndifference between &quot;Give me info =\r\nabout fires in Edo\nand the Yoshiwara&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m specifically interested in\nt=\r\nhe fire of 1861&quot;. It helps unbelievably to be\nspecific in what your questio=\r\nn is. I was mildly\nannoyed that you said you&#39;d looked and couldn&#39;t find\nany=\r\nthing, when a simple Google search came up with a\nton of sites (admittedly,=\r\n mostly scanty info like\nWikipedia, but still). However, if you&#39;re looking =\r\nfor\na specific fire at a specific date, that changes\nthings quite a bit. \n\n=\r\nGood luck, not sure I&#39;ve got anything that can help\nyou with your specific =\r\nquestion. \n\n\n\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Nate:\n&gt;   Fir=\r\nst of all let me thank you for your answer but\n&gt; I think I should have been=\r\n more specific about my\n&gt; question regarding the fires of the Yoshiwara. Ye=\r\ns I\n&gt; am aware of the great fire of 1657 I have found\n&gt; information on that=\r\n part of the history but there\n&gt; were also fires during the late nineteenth=\r\n century\n&gt; one of them I believe occured in the year 1861. You\n&gt; see it has=\r\n much harder finding that sort of\n&gt; information but if you Nate or anyone e=\r\nlse has or\n&gt; knows of where I can find that information I would\n&gt; be most g=\r\nrateful.\n&gt;   Rod\n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- Rod Pavez &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello everyone:\n&gt; &gt; Not long=\r\n ago I posted a question about the fires\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; the Yoshiwara or \n&gt; &gt; ple=\r\nasure quarter of the city of Tokyo. I really\n&gt; &gt; wanted to know if \n&gt; &gt; som=\r\neone has information regarding the historical\n&gt; &gt; timeline of those \n&gt; &gt; fi=\r\nres.
