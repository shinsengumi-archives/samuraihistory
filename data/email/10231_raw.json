There were some before, and =\r\nit was starting to become popular in the late 16th century, however it was =\r\nnot the &quot;set&quot; hairstyle until later. There were a number of ways in which t=\r\no fashion the top knot. From descriptions the most popular in the pre-Edo p=\r\neriod was the &quot;tea whisk&quot; which was named that because that is what it look=\r\ned like. I have a picture of a portrait that a friend sent me of Oda Nobuna=\r\nga. It was done by an Italian Jesuit who was commissioned by Nobunaga to do=\r\n a realistic picture of him, which was something that Japanese art was lack=\r\ning. While we of course cannot say for sure that it is 100% accurate, it is=\r\n safe to say, since it was done under Nobunaga&#39;s orders and probably his ap=\r\nproval, that it is more than likely the closest that we will have of an acc=\r\nurate picture of him. The portrait shows him with his typical mustache, and=\r\n even though he is wearing a top knot, the top of his head is not shaved. \n=\r\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;konohawolfie&quot; &lt;Greywolf456@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Sam Archives!\n&gt; \n&gt; This was something I meant to ask a long lon=\r\ng time ago, but I luckily came across a sticky note that made me remember. =\r\nWhat I&#39;m trying to figure out is the distinctive hairstyles of samurai.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Apparently, I read that samurai shave their hair in a &quot;half moon style&quot; w=\r\nhen they reach a particular age or rank? This is also very noticed in Feuda=\r\nl Japan art.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this the only hairstyle or are there others? I am also=\r\n especially curious in youths hair (like teen samurai).\n&gt; Also, why decide =\r\non shaving their head?\n&gt; \n&gt; If they have very short hair, can they keep it?=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
