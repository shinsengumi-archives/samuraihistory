Perhaps I phrased my question in a\n&gt; way that is too simplistic. \n\n\nIt&#39;s not a foolish question. Just one with a simple\nanswer. What is foolish is when the answer is given,\npeople want to argue or play semantical games with it.\nI didn&#39;t mean to imply it was a stupid question--it&#39;s\njust that many times that kind of question comes from\nthose who have a ridiculously romanticized idea of\nwhat being a samurai is--that it&#39;s some lofty thing\nthat only those who live by Hagakure and so forth can\nobtain. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a hereditary social class.\nPlain and simple. \n\nYour question is fine. The answer is that you don&#39;t\n&quot;retire&quot; from being a samurai, anymore than I would\nretire from being American. It&#39;s something you are\nborn as. If you&#39;re looking for a particular word that\ndescribes a samurai who is no longer active in the\nworld, then there isn&#39;t one, specifically. There are\nwords for monk, if he becomes one, or recluse, or so\nforth, but not anything that means &quot;a samurai who no\nlonger does anything&quot;. \n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
