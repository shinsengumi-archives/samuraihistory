What I  should \nhave said is if you want a cheap one to display, a Hanwei sword is the  best \nquality out there for a reasonably low price. Hanwei are of good quality  and \nhold true to the traditions of the makers. Now with that said, compromises  \nhave to be made to keep the cost of them reasonable. Hanwei swords were never  \nintended to be collector swords, they are made for practitioners and your  \naverage Joe with an interest in them.\n \nGreg\n&quot;Saigo Made Eizoku Suru&quot;\n \n\n\n\n**************Planning your summer road trip?
