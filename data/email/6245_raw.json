And I believe that to understand \nTakamori steps, and about samurai culture about family name, to maybe be \nable to understant their ancients steps\nThey know that when Takamori told something about China representing \ndanger for Japan, he decided to atack China. So, showing that he was a \ngreate leader, he and his army moved to south Japan to group lots more of \nsamurais.\nSome people did not agree with Takamori idea, and some fights occourred in \nJapan, near Satsuma. Due this, it was necessary more samurai warriors to \nkeep fighting!!\nSo... my wife&#39;s grand-grandfather was a samurai, but he choosed do not fight. \nTo do not fight he changed his family name from Miyaji clan to Waricoda clan.\nWaricoda was another samurai clan that was desapearing, because there \nwas no other man in the family to keep the family name.\nIn japanese family name ranking, Waricoda is one of a rare family name!! The \nlastest Waricoda in all world are my wife parents, uncles, ...\nHowever we must to understand why exactly the family changed to Waricoda, \nand we would like to know a litle more about samurai Miyaji clan.\nThere&#39;s anywebsite where could I find informations about old japanese \nfamilies? Or more about Takamori?\nI found only: http://www.samurai-archives.com/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
