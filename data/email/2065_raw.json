For \ni=\r\nnstance, why would Nobunaga want to replace the Emperor, if he \nconquered J=\r\napan he would have gotten the title of Shogun, which \ncarries all the power=\r\n. The Emperor is just a figure head. It would \nseem to make more sense to b=\r\ne Shogun than to try and over throw the \nEmperor, where everyones ultimate =\r\nloyalty laid.\n\nSecond, Nobunaga is betrayed twice by two brothers. In 1556,=\r\n \nNobuhiro, Nobunaga&#39;s elder brother, plotted with the new (and \nhostile) l=\r\nord of Mino, Sait=F4 Yoshitatsu, an act Nobunaga would later \npardon him fo=\r\nr. In 1557, Oda Nobuyuki and Shibata Katsuie plot \nagainst Oda Nobunaga in =\r\nOwari. Though Shibata is spared, Nobuyuki is \nkilled. Back in feudal japan =\r\nits more surprising that Nobuhiro was \nspared, rather than Nobuyuki being k=\r\nilled.\n\nThirdly, why trust his sister (O-ichi) to some one who betrayed his=\r\n \ntrust (Katsuie) when he could marry her off to Asai Nagamasa to \nsolitify=\r\n an allaince (which was a very common practice). Then when \nAsai back an en=\r\nemy of Nobunaga, he became an enemy and by that time \nKatsuie had earned ba=\r\nck Nobunaga&#39;s trust, so why not reunite them?\n\nForthly, you say Toyotomi Hi=\r\ndeyoshi used dishonorable techniques to \nclimb to his right hand position. =\r\nI was just wondering if you could \ngive some examples?\n\nLastly, you say, &quot;H=\r\ne needlessly had the captives that Akechi had \nspared to effect a surrender=\r\n put to death -- including a mother, \nwhich was the motivator that cost Ake=\r\nchi his own mother.&quot;\n\nIf you could elaborate on how the death of a mother w=\r\nas \nthe &quot;motivator that cost Akechi his own mother.&quot; I would appreciate \nit=\r\n.\n\nNow I am not saying everything Nobunaga did was morally right. Its \ntrue=\r\n he used burtal tactics, but when the country has been at war \nfor 250 year=\r\ns, &quot;death is necessary if you want peace.&quot;\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Eponymous13@a... wrote:\n&gt; Hi there.\n&gt;        I agree with you to a =\r\npoint.  But only to a point.  If \nAkechi \n&gt; Mitsuhide had not intervened, t=\r\nhere might have been peace earlier, \ncertainly -- and \n&gt; the key word is MI=\r\nGHT, because it might NOT have -- but, come \nearlier or come \n&gt; later, the =\r\ncost of it would have been so much higher, starting \nwith Nobunaga&#39;s \n&gt; ord=\r\ner for Akechi to reinforce Toyotomi.  I read somewhere -- and I \ndo not \n&gt; =\r\nremember where -- that Nobunaga&#39;s ultimate goal was to conquer all \nof Japa=\r\nn and \n&gt; then replace the Emperor with himself.  (Any truth to this, \nanybo=\r\ndy?)\n&gt;        According to the readings I&#39;ve done, as for Nobunaga \nhimself=\r\n, he was a \n&gt; brutal man, one of the two most brutal men alive at the time.=\r\n  \n(The other was \n&gt; Tsar Ivan IV of Russia, whose lifespan nearly mirrored=\r\n that of \nNobunaga, the \n&gt; former barely outliving the latter, Ivan living =\r\n1530-1584 to \nNobunaga&#39;s \n&gt; 1534-1582.)  He killed his own brother because =\r\nof a failed revolt \nin 1557 (sparing \n&gt; his then-twice-future brother-in-la=\r\nw Shibata Katsuie), forced a \nsister (O-ichi) \n&gt; to divorce Shibata, whom h=\r\ne had forced to MARRY (I believe around \nthe age of \n&gt; 11!!!!!) to solidify=\r\n an alliance, so he could marry her off to \nANOTHER warlord \n&gt; (Asai Nagama=\r\nsa) to solidify THAT alliance, killed that brother-in-\nlaw when he \n&gt; backe=\r\nd an (I believe) ages-old ally (the Asakura at Anegawa, \n1570), remarried \n=\r\n&gt; the sister to her first husband, and rewarded a man (Toyotomi \nHideyoshi)=\r\n who \n&gt; used dishonorable techniques to climb to his right hand position.  =\r\n\nHe \n&gt; needlessly had the captives that Akechi had spared to effect a \nsurr=\r\nender put to death \n&gt; -- including a mother, which was the motivator that c=\r\nost Akechi \nhis own \n&gt; mother, and in effect started the wheels turning whi=\r\nch brought \nNobunaga to his \n&gt; seppuku at Honno-ji.\n&gt;        For the good h=\r\ne did, which there was certainly at least \nsome -- \n&gt; including the inventi=\r\non of the sumo dohyo ring and the start of \nthe unification \n&gt; process -- i=\r\nt was better in my humble estimation that he not be \nthe one to finish \n&gt; t=\r\nhe unification process.  It was accomplished much more peacefully \nwith \n&gt; =\r\nHideyoshi and Tokugawa.  (BTW, I have my thoughts about that 1591 \nedict, t=\r\noo, but I \n&gt; don&#39;t want to get into them here.)\n&gt;        Hope this helps.  =\r\n:-D\n&gt; \n&gt; Later\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been r=\r\nemoved]\n\n\n"
