It has a bit too much \nof the one true way for me to feel comfortable with it.\n\nQuote from JKA site &quot;Bushido: The Way of the Samurai /Bushido/ has been \nthe samurai code of conduct in Japan for centuries. Based firmly on the \nteachings of Zen, /Bushido/ was intended to help the samurai master \ntheir nature and understand their minds and the universe through direct \nexperienceï¿½as well as through fostering strength, self-control and wisdom.&quot;\n\nIs Bushido really based on Zen? Or is it just a nasty perversion created \nto justify brutality and the abdication of personal responsibility? Zen \ncovers a wide range even in Japan, not counting some of the Chinese \nversions.\n\n&gt;     Because of recent e-mails about the relationship between Bushido and Karate, I have decided to write an essay on this subject, using evidence from JKA masters as well as extracts from respected books. \n&gt;\nLooking forward to it, I will read it if you write it.\n\n&gt;This is my final attempt to prove to you all there is such a strong link between the 2. I hope you all will then decide to do your own research to compliment this essay. Thank you very much.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
