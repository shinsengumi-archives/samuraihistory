Im gonna have to mve to Japan in a few years.. at first I was not looking foreward to it, mostly bcos I dont speak the language.. but many ppl have been telling me I&#39;ll do just fine that they are very westernized and most ppl, especially the younger ones (in my age backet) speak english.. (on a side note, according to the NY times Wed. Oct 23, 2002..&quot;To Grandparents english word trend isnt naissu&quot;) *hooray I actually have a refference* the Japanese are adopting English words into their own language.. History, tradition and a sense of who I am culturaly is really important to me.. so on one hand I was pretty relieved to hear that they are westernizing and that I will get along fine over there, but on the other hand, I feel sorry bcos in a way they are loosing that.. it seems Mishima was in his own....whacko little way, was just trying to point this out to ppl.. does anyone else not see this or see modern Japan as being &quot;sell outs&quot; in a way??\n\nWilson\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nFind what you are looking for with the Lycos Yellow Pages\nhttp://r.lycos.com/r/yp_emailfooter/http://yellowpages.lycos.com/default.asp?SRC=lycos10\n\n\n"
