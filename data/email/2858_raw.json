A\nyear ago, I injured my left knee cartridge by a moving\ncar. Since then, I had a surgery and rehab only after\nsix months later due to my workload.\nI want to resume my training especially with kick\nmovements.\nWhat is the best way or safe way to do so without\nreinjuring myself. My favorite skill was 540 degree\njump kick. I am very dynamic in nature. \n\nI will appreciate if you give any advice or personal\nexperience with this type of injury. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n                   \n                               Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Changsub Lee\n\n\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; who are they\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- sean_03809 &lt;sean_03809@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt;     What type of martial arts did they learn?
