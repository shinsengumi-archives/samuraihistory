However, the actual meaning\n&gt; would depend upon the kanji and hiragana used to form the name. I know a bit\n&gt; of spoken Japanese but am quite illiterate in written Japanese. Your best\n&gt; bet would be to have someone who is literate in Japanese kanji/hiragana to\n&gt; look at the written name.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps, Nina\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Cearb@... &lt;Cearb%40aol.com&gt;\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com &lt;samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wed, Dec 30, 2009 2:01 am\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Rokuro Kubi\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings All--\n&gt;\n&gt; First, I must say that despite having lived for almost 5 years in Japan and\n&gt;\n&gt; having read what seemed at the time like a great deal about Japanese\n&gt; history and the samurai legacy, I feel rather like a rank novice compared\n&gt; to the\n&gt; depth of information I&#39;ve found here -- so forgive me if I sound niave.\n&gt;\n&gt; My principle interest in samurai history is as a jumping-off point for fi\n&gt; ction, so my interests are roughly 50% history, 50% mythology and folklore.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which overlong self-introduction brings me to this question: I gather that\n&gt; the name Rokuro Kubi translates as &quot;Six (ro) neck&quot; -- which suggests to me\n&gt; that a &quot;ro&quot; is a unit of length. But numerous sources (including good ol&#39;\n&gt; Google) have NOT led me to any definition of how long a &quot;ro&quot; might be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help?\n&gt;\n&gt; --R. Michael Burns\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nActually, it turns out this &quot;roku&quot; has nothing to do with six at all. The\nkanji used are shown in Joly&#39;s &quot;Legend in Japanese Art&quot; under his entry for\nRokurokubi:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/7Kj6QG\n\nThe link is to the scanned copy at archive.org, which is the 1908 edition,\non p. 291. It&#39;s on p. 433 of the reprint editions by Tuttle. Joly\ncategorizes Rokurokubi, &quot;long-necked goblin,&quot; as Bakemono, or &quot;transformed\nthings,&quot; which include all manner of ghosts, goblins, etc., which he covered\nmore fully in a paper presented to the Japan Society, printed in the\nTransactions, Vol. IX.\n\nHappy (scholarly) hunting!\n\nCraig\n\n-- \nCraig Harris\nBridge of Dreams, LLC\nBooks from and about Asia\nwww.bridgeofdreams.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
