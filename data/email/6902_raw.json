I \nmight have said &quot;not completely&quot; and left it at that. As we know from \nOgasawara Sensei and the fine exhibition at the Sanno Museum; the \nshape and construction of the early Japanese warabite-to combined \nwith continental swordmaking techniques to give us the Wan-to \n(Japanese sword).\n\tPart of that process was combining different steels and \nlearning to control the curvature in a blade sometimes over thirty \ninches in length. The explanation for the presence of uchisori \n(reverse curve at the tip) on tanto, as given to me, is that the \nsmiths, understanding that the blade would curve on yaki-ire, made \ntheir blades with reverse curve. A little too much and the blade \nwould still have a hint of that reverse curve when finished, done \njust right the sori produced when the blade was heated and cooled \nproduced a perfectly straight blade. As time went on tanto too took \non more curvature.\n\tNow how much of this was experimentation and how much was \napplication of knowledge learned in the field, I don&#39;t think we can \nsay though later changes in shape show just how quickly popular \nstyles of construction spread.Favoring the idea that it was work by \ndesign. In fact in my original post I didn&#39;t say just where or when \nthat &quot;happy accident&quot; might have happened. I am more inclined to \nbelieve that it was a Chinese smith who first put a hard edge into a \nsoft bodied sword and produce curve in the process. The Japanese \neither learned it from their neighbors, in which case it was likely \nwell understood by the time it got to Japan, or they had to &quot;relearn \nit&quot; for themselves, getting that curve to &quot;work for them&quot; as Dean \nsaid...\n-t\n\n"
