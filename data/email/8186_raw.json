Weinberg, translations\nand =\r\nessay by Alfred H. Marks, Foreword by B.W. Robinson. Amsterdam:\nHotei Publi=\r\nshing, 2005, 192 pp., map, pictures, color plates. 39.50\neuro (paper).\n\nThi=\r\ns is the paperback edition (first published in 2000) of one of the\nmost int=\r\neresting of the many finely designed portfolios published by\nthe Dutch publ=\r\nishing house Hotei. It is devoted to the portraits of 47\nloyal masterless s=\r\namurai or ronin.\n\nTheir story is well known. In 1701 there was an altercati=\r\non in Edo\nCastle. A provincial lord, perceiving insult, drew his sword, an =\r\nact\nconsidered a capital offense. He was ordered to commit suicide,\nleaving=\r\n his samurai leaderless.\n\nOn a snowy day at the end of 1702, these ronin ma=\r\nrched to the mansion\nof the man they held responsible, decapitated him and =\r\noffered his head\nat the grave of their leader, thus completing their famous=\r\n revenge.\n\nBut revenge had in the otherwise fairly peaceful 18th-century be=\r\nen\nmade a capital offense, leaving Tokugawa authorities no recourse but\nto =\r\norder the loyal ronin to kill themselves, hara kiri being the\ndesignated me=\r\nthod. Such an order, however, contradicted one of the\nstipulations of the s=\r\namurai code: that one should not live under the\nsame heaven nor tread the s=\r\name earth as the enemy of one&#39;s lord.\n\nThe suicide of the ronin thus became=\r\n a social issue. Many were the\npleas for lenience and petitions for pardon.=\r\n These feelings were\nignored, yet as David Weinberg puts it in his commenta=\r\nry to this book\nof Kuniyoshi woodblock portraits of the ronin, &quot;something f=\r\nundamental\nin the character and spirit of the culture had suddenly and\ndram=\r\natically been expressed by these warriors.&quot;\n\nIts newsworthy importance was =\r\nhighlighted two weeks after the fact,\nwhen a stage version of the episode w=\r\nas performed. Although all the\nnames were changed, everyone knew what the p=\r\nlay was about, and its\npopularity was enormous for the three days it ran be=\r\nfore the theater\nwas summarily closed by the authorities.\n\nFurther renditio=\r\nns on both the bunraku and the kabuki stages appeared\nshortly thereafter, a=\r\nnd the saga of &quot;Chushingura,&quot; (&quot;The Treasury of\nLoyal Retainers&quot;) had begun=\r\n.\n\nIts popularity has long continued. There have been many later versions\no=\r\nf &quot;Chushingura,&quot; including an opera, a ballet and some 85 film\nadaptations,=\r\n most of them originally intended for a January release,\nas this seemed the=\r\n most appropriate season for the snow-filled\nvendetta, the climax of the pl=\r\nay. This is no longer true, however, and\nsuch celebratory film versions hav=\r\ne ceased to be made. Now the tale is\nthe property of television.\n\nInitially=\r\n, &quot;Chushingura&quot; was so popular that, in addition to the\nvarious written and=\r\n staged versions, ukiyo-e artists were soon turning\nout best-selling prints=\r\n. Hokusai, Utamaro, Hiroshige, Toyokuni,\nKunisada and many others did illus=\r\ntrations.\n\nThey had their differences, however. The use of mitate or parody=\r\n was\nseen in a number of prints.\n\nUtamaro had a series in which &quot;beautiful =\r\nwomen&quot; stood in for the\nwarriors and the recondite might recognize this ref=\r\nerence or that. In\naddition, there was the agenda of the artist himself.\n\nH=\r\niroshige was mainly interested in landscape, so his prints illustrate\nmainl=\r\ny the outdoor sections of the play.\n\nHokusai, on the other hand, was intere=\r\nsted in psychological anecdote;\nconsequently, his series creates a storyboa=\r\nrd-like narrative --\nsomething like manga.\n\nAmong the most popular of these=\r\n series were those of Kuniyoshi\n(1797-1861) who, nearly a century after the=\r\n actual event, was able to\nreturn to the story something of its original po=\r\nwer and pathos. In\nall, he produced more than 20 &quot;Chushingura&quot; triptychs an=\r\nd several\nseries of single-sheet prints devoted to individual portraits of =\r\nthe\nbrave band -- a total of some 266 works on the &quot;Chushingura&quot; theme.\n\nIn=\r\n &quot;Kuniyoshi,&quot; we are given the two portrait series of the\nindividuals who m=\r\nake up the story. Although the &quot;Seichu Gishi Den&quot;\n(the faithful samurai) is=\r\n more inclusive than the later &quot;Seichu Gishin\nDen&quot; (the faithful hearts), t=\r\nogether they comprise practically the\nentire cast of the kabuki version of =\r\nthe play.\n\nEach woodblock print is separately treated with a facing page\nde=\r\ndicated to the text and a commentary on the text itself, followed by\na numb=\r\ner of appendixes devoted to such matters as calligraphy and\nlanguage. In ad=\r\ndition, the particularities of each role are listed and\nthe drama is reveal=\r\ned.\n\nOne might wonder how these particularities managed to survive for a\nce=\r\nntury, but such speculation (along with the fact that all the ronin\nlook al=\r\nike) is beside the point. The point is that something large and\nimportant i=\r\ns being celebrated -- by the actors, the print-artists, and\nby us.\n\nThis co=\r\nuld well be that &quot;something fundamental&quot; suggested by Weinberg:\nfidelity ab=\r\nove all. At the same time it is also possible to see\n&quot;Chushingura&quot; as prote=\r\nst, as an objection to the shogunate&#39;s dictates\nand as a demonstration of a=\r\nnti-authoritorial opinion. This sympathetic\nvalidation of men that the gove=\r\nrnment had deemed criminal is in itself\nantigovernment.\n\nThis is what one a=\r\nlso sees in the heroic poses, the powerful lines and\nthe gleaming colors of=\r\n these Kuniyoshi prints. These demonstrate that\nthis valiant band was break=\r\ning the law for a worthy cause -- for\nsomething higher than mere law, for t=\r\nhe virtue of faithful loyalty.\n\nThe Japan Times: Jan. 8, 2006\n(C) All right=\r\ns reserved\n\n\n\n\n\n"
