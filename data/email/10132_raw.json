I loved my time there and hope to be  \nable to go back sometime soon -- it was an excellent experience. \n \nI recall, for example, that on the grounds of the Asakusa Kannon temple  \nthere is a small shrine, as I believe is true on the grounds of Kiyomizu-dera \nin  Kyoto, among others.  Certainly the various texts I&#39;ve read (Japanese  \nReligion by H. Byron Earhart, Shinto: The Kami Way by Sokyo Ono, The Japanese \n Experience by W.G. Beasley, just to name ones that are readily at hand) \nall  suggest the overlap of religions I mentioned in my previous e-mail.  \nThat&#39;s  why I&#39;m surprised that you say that Buddhism and Shinto are completely \nseparate  -- your statement contradicts quite literally EVERYTHING I have \nread about  Japanese religion.\n \nAs to your final point, I certainly hope you&#39;re right -- that the various  \nnations and religions of the world can come together in ever-increasing \npeace  and mutual understanding.\n \nKiotsukete!\n \n--RMB\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
