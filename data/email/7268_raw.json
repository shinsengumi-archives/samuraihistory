Jackson will produce and voice the hotly \nanticipated five episode anime series Afro Samurai with Japanese \nanime studio Gonzo and Fuji Television. \n\nThe tale spins around a black samurai, Afro, to be voiced by \nJackson, who is on a quest to avenge his father&#39;s death, \nmeeting &quot;enemies, friends and challenges along the way&quot;. Hopefully \nthe series will be more original than the storyline of &quot;antisocial \nwarrior avenging the wrongful death of his (insert relative of your \nchoice here)&quot;.  Jackson overflows with talent on the big screen, but \nAfro Samurai will need to pack a lot more punch than its initial \npress release to stand out in the anime crowd, even with his gravely \nvoice bringing life to the lead role.\n\nThe series blends samurai style with hip-hop, something the Spike TV \nfolks claim in their press release &quot;American audiences have never \nseen before&quot;. Guess the Spike TV guys haven&#39;t been keeping up with \nShinichiro Watanabe&#39;s latest effort, Samurai Champloo.\n\n\n\n\n"
