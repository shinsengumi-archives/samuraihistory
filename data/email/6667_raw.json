I wish to illustrate (in my humble \n&gt; &gt; opinion) how a melding of aspects of both societies doctrines \nwould \n&gt; &gt; produce a better 21st century America. My query is this: should i \njust \n&gt; &gt; explain it point to point (i.e., Japan&#39;s feudal caste system vs. \n&gt; &gt; America&#39;s free democratic society) or should i find an actual period \n&gt; &gt; in Japan&#39;s history to compare to 20th Century America? Like the \nHeian \n&gt; &gt; period or the Kamakura period? Any assitance or constructive \ncriticism \n&gt; &gt; will be greatly appreciated.\n\nCan&#39;t help feeling intrigued by this -partly because an economist friend \nof mine is studying how the Japanese economy arrived at the 21st \ncentury by a different route to Western countries, but competitive with \nthem. \n\nMy next thought was that a feudal system is not really a stable system \nin itself as it is usually in a constant state of self-defence and then \nreplaced fairly rapidly by centralised government.\n\n The Japanese central government under the Tokugawa shogunate was \nsuccessful in that it brought 250 years of peace.\n\nMaybe you could look at the Tokugawa period (1603 to 1868) and \nconsider the characteristics of the Tokugawa system which made it \nrelatively easy for the Meiji government to strong-arm the country into \nmodernising: vertical hierarchies, neo-Confucianism, a relatively docile \nand obedient population, a thriving pre-industrial merchant economy \netc, and some of the costs to the population - stifling of individual \nopinion and protest, often with great cruelty, a repressive society with \nelements of a police state, much informing on neighbours and so on, \nall of which have made it really hard for the Japanese to embrace \nWestern style democracy in any realistic fashion or to have many forms \nof public protest.\n\nI wonder if this relative ease with which government decisions are \nenforced won&#39;t make life simpler  for countries like Japan and China as \nthe century continues and really difficult decisions re consumption and \nenvironment have to be made by the world&#39;s governments. A tokugawa \nstyle despot who can make laws and enforce them may be the &quot;best&quot; \nform of government, but I hope he/she is an enlightened one!\n\nJust some random thoughts. Anyone want to discuss further?\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"
