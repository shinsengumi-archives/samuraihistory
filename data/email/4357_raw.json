Lidin? published by Nias Press (www.niaspress.dk)\n\nI recently bought a copy from Kinokuniya (the Japanese chain bookstore) but have only had time to skim it. It seems to have a very good bibliography and notes.\n\nAnyone else here read it? Opinions?\n\nAlso some time ago I read Deus Destroyed by George Ellison which gives a very dramatic picture of the differences between European and Japanese religious belief and ways of thinking.\n\nA very useful Japanese history bibliography page is\n\nhttp://www.oriental.cam.ac.uk/jbib/bibtitle.html\n\nHope this is of some help - sorry can&#39;t write more for you!!\n\nGillian\n\n"
