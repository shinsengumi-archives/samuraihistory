That&#39;s just a working\n&gt; title, though, I&#39;m sure something else will come up.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks to all for the most excellent information, it helps\n&gt; tremendously; and yet I have many more questions. (I&#39;ll ask those in\n&gt; due time, though.) As for the book, I was wondering: I know this\n&gt; isn&#39;t a writing critique group, but if I posted the backstory- about\n&gt; how the revenge gets set up, the basic kernal of the story- would you\n&gt; guys be willing to take a look and tell me if it&#39;s _logical_ enough?\n&gt; I know there is a definite component of fantasy, and I am making very\n&gt; free with some aspects of the Japanese culture, but I&#39;d at least like\n&gt; to get as close as I can to _some_ kind of historical accuracy.\n&gt;\n&gt; I realize this is off-subject, but this is the best resource I have\n&gt; for this book and I want to do it right. So you know I&#39;m not a\n&gt; weirdo: (or at least, I am a successful weirdo, LOL) my website is at\n&gt; http://www.lilithsaintcrow.com . I have three ebooks out, a four-book\n&gt; contract with a romance publisher (even writers have to eat, guys)\n&gt; and am negotiating with an agent for another book. If the\n&gt; negotiations go successfully I might be able to sell this book to a\n&gt; publisher too. So there is a very real chance of this thing acheiving\n&gt; fruition- all of which I tell you so that you know I won&#39;t be wasting\n&gt; precious list time and posts.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d also be grateful for any help anyone would want to give offlist,\n&gt; as I know this isn&#39;t the sort of thing you guys usually do here. If\n&gt; I&#39;ve offended by asking for this, please let me know, and forgive me.\n&gt; I&#39;m just really excited by this book and the characters, and I want\n&gt; to do them justice.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Yahoo!
