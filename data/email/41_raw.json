Octogonal, I have one=\r\n made out of\nPeach wood. Strange choice I know but it was a gift, the usual=\r\n Rokushakubo,\nand a Bo wihich has nine rings on it. 4 at each end spaced ap=\r\nart evenly, and a\nninth one in the middle. Not too sure why they have the r=\r\nings, maybe to\nreinforce it. They have also in the past used kyushakubo. I =\r\ntried to twirl one\nonce. I found it hard being 6ft (180cm)m so how a smalle=\r\nr Japanese managed,\nwho knows. Not very practical. Mostly the Bo are made f=\r\nrom Oak.\n\nPaul Richardson\n\n\n&quot;Dr. Antenor Camili Penteado&quot; &lt;acpenteado@hotma=\r\nil.com&gt; wrote:\nHello My name is Penteado, Antenor Penteado.

I know that there is a french edition, but I am \nnot quite sure=\r\n if there is an english edition yet.\nI have just read the new biography wri=\r\ntten about Miyamoto Musashi that has \nsome information about &quot;Bo-jutsu&quot;.\nI =\r\nlike Bo-jutsu and I would like to receive some information about the \nwoode=\r\nn bastons, its size and interesting information about this art!\nso, once mo=\r\nre nice to meet you!\nI am sorry for my poor english\nbest wishes.\nAntenor C.=\r\n Penteado\n_________________________________________________________________=\r\n________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotma=\r\nil.com.\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nsamuraihistory=\r\n-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________=\r\n______________________\nGet free email and a permanent address at http://www=\r\n.netaddress.com/?N=3D1\n\n"
