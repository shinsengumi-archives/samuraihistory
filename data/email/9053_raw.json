Do you claim that during say, the \nmomoyama period, tattoos were socially acceptable by the bushi? The japanese \nperception of tattoos as unclean is a modern only sensibility? The analogy \nworks unless of course he *is* into torturing small animals. My point was \nsimply something perfectly acceptable to someone in one time and culture \n(tattoos, now, in the West) could be taken as bizarre at the least by \nsomeone from another time and culture (tattoos in honor of something, then, \nJapan).\n\n\nTo further play Satan&#39;s\n&gt;Lawyer, are you saying that &quot;respectable&quot; people don&#39;t get tattoos?\n&gt;You&#39;ve dug yourself a bit of a hole, can you get out? ;)\n\n  Whether *I* feel respectable people don&#39;t get tattoos isn&#39;t the issue. The \nissue is how tattoos are percieved in Japan. Note *I* have a tat and even \nthough most rules Japanese apply to themselves are ignored as baka gaijin \nthings when foreigners are concerned, there aren&#39;t many onsen I can visit \ndue to 1 small tat. Can you cite any &quot;respectable&quot; japanese who have tats \n(entertainers excluded of course)? Note: respectable as it would be applied \nin Japan. I have some japanese friends who have tats and they are great \npeople, but none are politicians, CEOs etc.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
