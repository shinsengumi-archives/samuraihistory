It is not until within the last 2\nyears, however, that I have begun to really look into it.  I am a rather\ngood writer and plan to use the late Sengoku period in one of the episodes\nof a series my friends and I are going to begin writing.  I wish to know\nwhere I can get ALL of the info I need such as Historical data, Language\nand systems of counting used by the people, as well as all of their\nimportant customs.  I&#39;ve read &quot;SHOGUN&quot; by James Clavell, but besides the\nobvious renaming of historical figures such as Will Adams (James\nBlackthorne in the book) and Tokugawa Ieyasu (the character Yoshi\nToranaga) a few things were kind of inaccurate and even I picked up on it\nwith my limited knowledge.  Things such as -san and -sama for polite\nconversation and addression superiors instead of using -sama and -dono as\nI understand they are the correct way of seperating politeness from\nrespect.  Also they said &quot;Domo&quot; could be used instead of &quot;Domo Arigato&quot; by\nmen to say &quot;Thanks&quot;.  This was the first thing that caught my eye as a\nproblem since &quot;Domo&quot; means &quot;Very much&quot; it didn&#39;t make sense to me.  Am I\nmistaken??  I wish to know how much of the counting systems given were\ncorrect as well (a Koku is the amount of rice needed to feed 1 man for 1\nyear, and days are divided into 12 sets of 2 hours each and named in order\nof the Oriental Zodiac, etc.)  Also the correct measurement of &quot;Ri&quot; is\nimportant.  The book said it was &quot;1 mile&quot; the glossary of the samurai\narchives said it was &quot;2.445 miles&quot; I&#39;m more inclined to believe the\nArchive though.  It being official and all.  Is there any other advise as\nto what I should incorporate into my book and places where I could accuire\nthis info.  Any information that any of you could give me would be greatly\nappreciated.  My intention is to make this as Historically accurate as\nhumanly (or Americanly ::sigh::) possible.\n\nP.S.  By the way, any infant can speak better Japanese than me which is a\nbig problem so I have a question about a certain title.  If I was to call\nsomeone &quot;Shogun of the Six Divine Virtues&quot; would it be writen as &quot;Roku\nShintoku no Shogun&quot; or the other way around???\n\nDomo Arigato,\nTorakami Bloodfang\n\n\n=================================================\nDelphi.com: Home to the Web&#39;s most vibrant online\ncommunities.
