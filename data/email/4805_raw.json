Takeda Shingen died in 1573, and\n&gt; the Takeda clan \n&gt; fell to a Toyotomi/Tokugawa invasion in 1582.\n\nNot to be picky, but to be picky, it was an\nOda/Tokugawa invasion (aided and abetted by the more\nsurvival-focused Takeda relatives). Not only was\nHideyoshi still using the name &quot;Hashiba&quot; and not\n&quot;Toyotomi&quot;, he was clear across Honshu fighting the\nMori at the time. \n\nI know you probably know this, Nao--this is more for\nthe benefit of the person asking the original\nquestion. Don&#39;t want them to get confused. \n\nDuring \n&gt; all of this, Yukimura&#39;s elder brother Nobuyuki (who\n&gt; had earlier been \n&gt; sent as a hostage to the Tokugawa) fought for Ieyasu\n&gt; at the battle \n&gt; of Sekigahara itself.\n\nI always find this interesting--especially during\nSekigahara and so forth, there seemed to be a lot of\n&quot;well, I&#39;ll fight on this side, and brother, you fight\non that side, so one of us will have to be on the\nwinning side, and our family will continue.&quot; \n\nPretty pragmatic, I suppose.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
