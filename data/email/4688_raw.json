Women and \ntradesmen used them as protective weapons. Commonly called as hara-\nkiri knives. They are usually the hira-zukuri (without ridgeline) \ntypes.\n\nWas just wondering if anyone can elaberate on the names, styes and \ntypes of these swords used between the Muromachi period and the Edo \nperiod.\n\n\n\n"
