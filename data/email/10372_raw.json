I have previo=\r\nusly posted here regarding this topic, and a few people were kind enough to=\r\n respond (in public or personally), but in the end most were also left wond=\r\nering &quot;what happened exactly&quot;.\n\nEssentially, what transpired from Kenshin&#39;s=\r\n death (or before) until Kagekatsu fully takes control of the Uesugi, force=\r\ns Kagetora&#39;s suicide, and eventually stabilizes the Uesugi domain.  So, ~15=\r\n78-1580.\nBased on Samurai Archives, it sounds like both Kagetora and Kageka=\r\ntsu manage to gain at least some support amongst the Uesugi retainer band.\n=\r\n\nAlternatively, if anyone else has found some information, I would love to =\r\nhear what you have found.\n\nthanks!\n-dennis\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope you&#39;ve been ge=\r\ntting something out of the Samurai Archives Podcast so far -- next we&#39;ll be=\r\n covering the Sengoku period, and will be hosting a Q&A, so send your quest=\r\nions along, and we&#39;ll answer them on air.  For anyone not familiar with the=\r\n Sengoku period, remember those sweeping epic Samurai battles you saw in mo=\r\nvies and Anime?  That&#39;s the Sengoku period, populated by such famous figure=\r\ns as Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Uesugi Kenshin, and a ton of others.  So=\r\n send along your questions, easy, basic, complex, or hard, doesn&#39;t matter, =\r\nand we&#39;ll do our best to answer them!\n&gt; \n&gt; http://samuraiarchives.podbean.c=\r\nom/\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
