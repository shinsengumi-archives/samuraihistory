Did they have to be trained from young ages, or were there any famous samurai who decided to become one later on?  I know there was a strict four-part caste system during the Edo/Tokugawa dynasty and that one of those classes was the samurai, or warrior class.  And, purportedly kendo lost its flare and popularity immediately after the Meiji Restoration; how true is that?  Certainly it had to have a large enough group of followers that it survived to today...\n\nHi Stephanie,\n\nThe concept of training a samurai to a predefined level (such as an NVQ in swordsmanship) would be rather alien to this warrior class. The level of training was more of a personal matter and was dependant on the teacher or the Daimyo in whose fife he served. For the early samurai, with some personal wealth, the art of the bow and its perfection were the ultimate aim {mounted archery [yabusame] is still practised to a high level of skill - and a pleasure to watch}.  Later samurai perfected their skill with the sword and lance but the leveller came with powder and shot. There was very little skill required to fire the early firearms - the skill was to make sure you didn&#39;t kill yourself!  With the massed armies and formations training would have been in the reaction to orders and mobility.\n\nThere is an excellent book which looks at the martial arts of feudal japan and illustrates the complexity and wealth of fighting skills available and is well worth a read = &quot;Secrets of the Samurai&quot;; Ratti & Westbrook, published by Tuttle 1973 (and after). For a little light reading!! read &quot;Musashi&quot;; Yoshikawa (trans. by Terry), published by Harper&Row - this is the story {faction}of the most famous japanese swordsman to date, a son of a samurai whose aquired skills helped him survive from Sekigahara through Shimabara, a period of almost 40 years.\n\nThat should be enough to get you moving on that little topic!!\n\nBest wishes\n    \n                    Rod Johnson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
