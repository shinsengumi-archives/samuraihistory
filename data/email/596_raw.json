Basically I&#39;m not a historian just a guy who\nloves reading history so the type of history books I would prefer to read\nare &#39;popular&#39;. I guess trained historians are interested in such academic\nbooks, but I&#39;m just looking for a good story. So in reply to Mr. Byants\ncomment that people don&#39;t delve farther into the feild my feeling is those\nbooks arn&#39;t very interesting to an amatuer historian. As for Massie, James\nMcpherson who wrote the Civil War history &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; said that\nthere was proffesional envy that his book sold well. Maybe this is the case\nwith Massie (maybe not). In any event I&#39;m not that interested in what the\nAHA thinks about an author, I liked his books and will read him again. As\nfor Ambrose well I live in Japan (for some 8 years) so I haven&#39;t seen\nanything about his case. If true its sad because he is a good writer. So\nwhat I want to say is that I wish there were more popoular histories written\nabout Japan. Imagine if someone wrote a book on the Meiji Restoration the\nway Simon Schama wrote about the French Revolution, or a biography of Oda\nNobunaga on the scale of Massies Peter the Great.  Wishful thinking.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Mark E.

Bryant&#39;s books\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The problem is is that these and other books are often dreary academic\n&gt; &gt; texts. I have read &quot;Gates of power&quot; and might read the book on\n&gt; Yoritomo. I\n&gt; &gt; saw it in the bookstore and the apprehension I have is that it&#39;s not\n&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; a flesh and blood biography of him. I would much rather prefer to read\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; book on him written say in the style Amy Kelly wrote on Eleonor of\n&gt; Aquitane.\n&gt; &gt; If she could write that kind of book on a famous person in the 12th\n&gt; century\n&gt; &gt; somebody could write one on Yoritomo. The other apprehension is that\n&gt; &gt; Yoritomo book is 8000 yen. For me a least its not a question of not\n&gt; wanting\n&gt; &gt; to delve deeper into more serious works. Its that the feild of\n&gt; Japanese\n&gt; &gt; historigraphy is lacking in truly talented writers that can be found\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; other fields eg Robert Massie, Simon Schama, Stephan Ambrose. That is\n&gt; &gt; something that disappoints me.\n&gt;\n&gt; You either want popular history or an academic history; you\n&gt; unfortunately can&#39;t get both.  Out of the list you give above, Schama is\n&gt; the only exception to the generalization.  While Ambrose was trained as\n&gt; a historian, you need to be checking the newspapers more, he is under\n&gt; heavy fire for plagiarism and getting his facts screwed up.  I have yet\n&gt; to meet any AHA members who liked Massie&#39;s books as an ACADEMIC book.\n&gt; Maybe they are out there, but I haven&#39;t seen them come forward.  The\n&gt; same criticisms are leveled at Tuchman and Cantor&#39;s recent works.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best, Mark Hall\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
