The people expected it, and so it was done. But the blade would\nhave suffered too many damages or even bending after such an\nunbelievable cut. Even in before WWII are reported some complete cuts of\ngun barrels or heavy blades or even maces, in Axis propaganda (even\nItalian) but I think it was fiction. I don&#39;t know which way the cutted\nold gun barrel was made, but the only reference about a damage to a\nmachine gun barrel I once had, referred to a partial cut and little\nbending of the barrel (Bren gun in Malaya campaign). No information\nabout the blade&#39;s damages.     \n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: David Heller [mailto:olasnah@...] \nInviato: domenica 11 gennaio 2004 5.48\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai\n\nIn one of my books, there is an old drawing of a katana slicing through\na steel helmet. This is a different situation, but not terribly so. I\nhave also seen video demonstrations of custom made Katanas being used to\nbreak clean through rapiers/broadswords of top quality European\nmanufacture. It&#39;s not above such a sword&#39;s capability to do something\nlike that given enough force, like you said. (The rifles these guys were\ncarrying could also have been cheaply made)\n \nI think that from the film&#39;s perspective, and for that of the public\nviewing it, this was almost a necessary scene. The Samurai sword has\nalways had a reputation for hardness and cutting power, but most of the\nWestern world doesn&#39;t know about it, no matter how many episodes of\n&#39;Highlander&#39; they might have watched. It was a nice example of one of\nJapan&#39;s main contributions to military technology. \n\nJosh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:\nI still dont think it could happen, it looked to me as if it sliced thru\nthe action.. true, it probably was the best on the field that day (well\nexcept for after about the first 15 minutes that Tom had been fighting),\nbut how hard Tom could swing that sword, momentum and downward force and\nstrength have a lot to do w/ that as well..\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Sat, 10 Jan 2004 15:22:02\nFrom: David Heller &lt;olasnah@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nCutting through a rifle is not an unknown event. As for the movie, if\nthe blade impacted just behind the action of the rifle, I would say that\nit&#39;s almost easy. Maybe we can see that on the DVD. The sword that\nAlgren carried was freshly forged and probably had the sharpest and\nstrongest blade on the field of battle that day. \n\nJosh Wilson &lt;lordwilson@...&gt; wrote:I know the movie was\ninaccurate, and I tried to put that past it, and judge it as a\nmovie..even then it still sucked.. like when Tom cruise sliced thru a\nrifle w/ a sword?? or all the sword fights striking the blades edge on\nedge repeatedly.. that was all crap.. there was lots of other stuff\ntoo.. \n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Sat, 10 Jan 2004 13:23:17\nFrom: Mmupton1@...\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nI do not think &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is historically accurate, but I think\nthe \nbattle at the very end of the movie actually did take place, something\nlike the \ngun powder rebellion. Well, anyway I also thought it was a good movie.\nIt was \nquit touching. I went to go see it with my friends when it first came\nout, \nthey try to act as if they are tough, but when we walked out of the\ntheater they \nwere balling their eyes out. We dont talk about that to this day though.\nYeah \nit was a good movie.\n-Matthew Upton\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
