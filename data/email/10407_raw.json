The land in that area is really beautiful, but there was not =\r\n(at the time) too much preservation or many displays.  Supposedly there may=\r\n have been some renovation of the site(s) since then.\n\nI thought Gifu was a=\r\n really great site.  I loved the sky cable car I had to take to get to the =\r\ntop, and you could see how powerful of a position the castle was.  This gre=\r\nat little mountain surrounded by lush fields and a nearby river (or at leas=\r\nt that&#39;s how I remember it).\n\nI also saw Nagahama.  It was nice, nothing sp=\r\necial.  The best part of Nagahama was a map they had inside the castle show=\r\ning the locations of other important castles (and how far away they were). =\r\n It really hit home that the big players were fighting over very small stre=\r\ntches of land--and the major castles were often no more than a day or two a=\r\npart (by horse) and no more than a few hours away by car.\n\nI skipped Sekiga=\r\nhara (train went by it) because it looked toooo touristy.  I like to be abl=\r\ne to explore on my own, and my japanese was good enough back then to talk w=\r\nith the occasional random person when I got lost or confused.\n\n\n--- In samu=\r\nraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scott_rekishika&quot; &lt;scottc_4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As =\r\nfar as I know Himeiji Castle will still be under reconstruction for a coupl=\r\ne more years at least. I am not sure how much of it they have open at the m=\r\noment, or will when you get there. Not to discourage you from going, just k=\r\nnow that you probably will not be able to see all of it. As far as I know i=\r\nt is not completely closed off. They are just closing down the sections the=\r\ny are working on as they do them I think. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Tanuki &lt;Cearb@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not sure about battle sight=\r\ns off the top of my head, but Himeji Castle is a must-see...
