Was there relevant differentiation\n&gt;  between the military system and the &quot;social&quot; system, or was the \n&gt; military\n&gt;  system &quot;driven by&quot; the social one?\n\nSo then, he is asking about feudal structures. Further, the term \n&quot;saburau&quot; which is the anticedent of the term &quot;samurai&quot; shows up during \nthe Heian period. More importantly, Wayne Ferris in &quot;Heavenly Warriors&quot; \nargues for a continuity of military development instead of some sort of \ndisjuncture between the Heian period and the Kamakura period. Finally, \nin terms of the actual question at hand, you should understand that \neven pre-700 CE titles were still hanging around at the time of the \nMeiji Restoration in 1868. \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
