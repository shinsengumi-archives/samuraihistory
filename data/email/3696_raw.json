Of the officers and nco&#39;s,\n&gt;(the people who actually took swords into battle in WW2) many of them had\n&gt;training in iado, kendo and kenjutsu. They complained that the kyugunto, a\n&gt;western style saber used during the Russo-Japanese war until the mid 1930s\n&gt;was to brittle and inflexable for combat and it also did not allow for a two\n&gt;handed grip. \n&gt;\nAlso many of the Western sabre patterns had degenerated into inferior \nshapes that were dressy rather than useful. If I remember correctly \nGeorge Patton redesigned it in the early 20th century so that it was a \nbetter weapon!\n\n&gt;   From: Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Turn the question around: Why do we in the US military\n&gt;carry cavalry sabers as our ceremonial weapons (and\n&gt;why did they carry them back in the day when they\n&gt;actually used them?) Because that&#39;s what we\n&gt;used--that&#39;s what fit with our Army. Why should the\n&gt;Japanese Army change what had worked for their culture\n&gt;for 1000 years?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt is interesting about how the social aspects of being in the cavalry \nvary from country to country. Being in England it&#39;s considered \nprestigious, while for a long time in the US it was the province of \nrunaways, neer-do-wells and criminals. (My grandfather and granduncle \nwere in the US horse cavalry prior to WW1) Was there ever this split \nbetween foot and horse in the various Japanese periods? Or was it just a \nmatter of money and usage when you used a horse?\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"
