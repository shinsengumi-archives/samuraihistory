This is my favorite area of Japanese \nhistory so I may be too harsh a critic.  &quot;Restaurant&quot;, &quot;waitress&quot; and \n&quot;bathroom&quot; are all too modern and invoke the &quot;groan&quot; and  catapult the \nreader back into his world rather than keep him in yours. &quot;Public \nHouse&quot;, &quot;Tea room&quot; or even &quot;eatery&quot; might work better, as would \n&quot;servant-girl&quot; and &quot;outhouse&quot; (privy). If it is 1854 then the language \nyou use should invoke the 1850&#39;s, since we are close enough in time \nthat most readers know what it should sound like (as opposed to the \n1550&quot;s).\n\t A single sailor strolls into a bar? All joking aside, in 1854 it is \nunlikely that Commodore Perry would have allowed any of the men of his \ncommand this kind of casual contact. Servant girls didn&#39;t hang around \nthe table and &quot;unn&quot; was likely all the thanks she expected to receive. \nDomo Arigato-doitashimashite are again too modern, and jolt the reader \nout of the story. I think a samurai of these times would not call \nhimself a &quot;samurai&quot; but rather &quot;Bushi&quot;, if he has a good command of \nEnglish then &quot;warrior.&quot; However if he is giving Japanese lessons he \nshould say &quot;Bakufu&quot;,  I do not think he would have command of words \nlike &quot;Shogunate&quot; which is afterall an English word.\n\tMono Kenshu? Okinawans have funky names true, but farming samurai from \nOkinawa? Satsuma. Yes, I don&#39;t buy Okinawa. Josiah Louis, Joseph Louis, \nJebediah Louis I could accept, &quot;Joe&quot; again sounds too modern. I also \nwonder how open-minded a working class white male from the American \nSouth of the 1850&#39;s might be toward Asians and their culture. If he \nwere black he wouldn&#39;t be walking around with an interpreter and if he \nwere important enough to be granted an interpreter he would likely not \nbe strolling into a pub. And what about the interpreter!?! What does he \ninterpret? When the Samurai speaks, is it his English we hear or is \nthat the interpreter?\n\tI know I am picking nits here, so don&#39;t take me too seriously. Alot of \nmy questions/concerns could easily be answered by the tale that is \nabout to unfold. Tom Cruise movies aside this is certainly a period and \nplace in history that is ripe for literary and theatrical dramatization \nand I for one am all for it.\n-t\n\nPS- I feel that the US was looking to beat the Europeans to Pacific \nWhaling to replace that lost in the Atlantic which was &quot;overfished&quot;, \ncoaling stations in Japan were vital to that effort, &quot;trade and amity&quot; \nwere the sugar-coating used to sell the idea of open ports to Japan...\n\n\n"
