Im so proud they are trying to better themselves&quot; so showing off tattoos is nothing to them.. if they own businesses, the symbols are on the buildings. They dont hide the fact that they are organized, they just hide what their organizations do. Whereas in the West, ppl denied for decades, even centuries about even being organized...\n\nWilson\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\nDATE: Thu, 04 Dec 2003 04:10:45\nFrom: &quot;Kitsuno&quot; &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\nThat&#39;s what long sleeve shirts are for.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; \n&lt;the_sam_99@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; So this yamaguchi group just roams about japan showing everyone \nthat \n&gt; they are part of a yakuza with their body tattoos?\n&gt; \n&gt; Miburo\n\n\n\nYahoo!
