There is a chou that is a unit of length that \nis roughly 109 meters. But there is another chou which is a unit of \nareas. They both can be written with the kanji \u001b$BD.\u001b(B, although it&#39;s \nusually more common to see the unit of length written as \u001b$BCz\u001b(B.\n\n&gt;shaku) which equals 109.08 metres. Assuming that the unit of land area\n&gt;is derived by squaring this we get: 11898.446 metres, or call it 1.19\n&gt;hectares, not eight. A hectare being a lump of turf measuring 100 x 100\n\nAs with all measures in Japan, much depends on the era and the \nlocality that is under discussion. But in modern terms, one chou is \n9917.4 square meters, or 991 &#39;ares&#39;, just slightly under 1 hectare.\n\nAgain the precise system and modern equivalent depends greatly on \nthe era of Japanese history that is under discussion. but in general \nthe pattern is:\n\nBasic unit of area is one &#39;bu&#39; \u001b$BJb\u001b(B = 3.3 square meters.
