The spear was used by many of the great\n&gt; samurai which is why their is so many different styles of sword\n&gt; fighting. The sword was a sacred weapon to the samurai but if you read\n&gt; the rules of some old clans some of them say certain things like\n&gt; nobody but a certain group was allowed to use the sword(shinsengumi).\n&gt; the shogun was normally a master of a certain style of fightingand\n&gt; taught the soldiers themselves. I still don&#39;t know why they choose\n&gt; farmers to become samurai all the books that i read say that samurai\n&gt; were just farmers with a sword. im not sure wheather or not they had\n&gt; berserkers for soldiers but normally if a samurai goes into to many\n&gt; fights the samurai went completely berserk. \n\n\nPlease read more and spout less.\n\nTony\n-- \n\nAnthony J.
