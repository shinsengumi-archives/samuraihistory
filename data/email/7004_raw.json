I had wondered why\n&gt; there were so many\n&gt; Minamoto and Taira in the history books, and it was\n&gt; a Wikipedia article\n&gt; on &#39;Minamoto&#39; that I was looking at earlier that\n&gt; stated that the name\n&gt; was honorary... proving once again to take all\n&gt; Wikipedia articles with a\n&gt; grain of salt...\n\nInterestingly enough, I had to go to a Wikipedia\narticle to jog my memory on the Emperor the Taira were\nprimarily descended from--I couldn&#39;t remember Kammu,\nfor some reason. \n\nWikipedia is great for fast, shallow knowledge, but\nyou do need to take it with a grain of salt.\nUnfortunately, like many people here who have read a\nlot for pleasure but not for research, it&#39;d hard for\nme to remember where I read what :) \n\nWhen in doubt, I plead with Tony to give me a source.\nOr I just use him, and the blame goes his way. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
