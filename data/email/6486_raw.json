I asked some people from my school about what they know about the samurai, and most of them, if not all, told me things that they probably got by watching Rurouni Kenshin or by playing games like Onimusha. One or two even told me that they thought the samurai were invincible warriors until they got to see The Last Samurai.\n\nKyle Segall &lt;klancesegall@...&gt; wrote:\nTo be honest, I just couldn&#39;t help but notice a pattern in idiocy. \nEVERYONE was making the same basic mistakes. (The eleventh one came \nlater, after by some strange coincidence about 3 or 4 people on the \nforum starting saying how &#39;samurai loved and served the emperor with \ntheir life, every single one&#39;. And they&#39;ve kept coming.) As for my \nsources, basically just common real knowledge on the samurai.
