My mom was born at the foot of Mt. Fuji and \nlived there until she was 8. My grandmother was a fascinating women \nwho stayed very true to her culture.  Before she died, I remember \nher talking of some kind of history of Samurai in her family.  Is \nthere any way I can find out if it was true?  It&#39;s not that I doubt \nher honesty, it&#39;s just that she was sick in the end, and not as \nsharp as before.  Her Japenese name was Akiko Takeuchi.  I think I \nspelled that right.  Any help would be appriecated!\n\n\n"
