I am a life long martial artist=\r\n. I thank you for \n&gt; letting me join this group. I only discovered the Samu=\r\nrai in 2003, \n&gt; ofcourse I had heard of them before, but I didnt really kno=\r\nw anything \n&gt; about them. As corney as it may sound, the film The Last Samu=\r\nrai got \n&gt; me intrested, after that I discovered my calling. I started to r=\r\nead \n&gt; any book I could find on the Samurai and their code of moral conduct=\r\n, \n&gt; Bushido. The more I read, the more they fascinated me. How, with a \n&gt; =\r\nfew exceptions, these brave men (and sometimes even women to) lived \n&gt; by a=\r\n strict moral code, from the time they woke up in the moring to \n&gt; the time=\r\n they went to sleep. The trained in the art of the sword, and \n&gt; help honor=\r\n above all. I felt alonging to become like this, but \n&gt; ofcourse I thought =\r\nthe Samurai were gone, just like most warriors of \n&gt; old. But then I discor=\r\nverd that people were still practicing their \n&gt; ways, and tring to live as =\r\nmuch like a Samurai as one could in this \n&gt; day and age. This is a goal in =\r\nwhich I would like to strive for. I am \n&gt; doing my best to study the philos=\r\nophy of Bushido and to learn the Art \n&gt; of the Sword on my own, unfortunatl=\r\ny there are no dojos in columbia \n&gt; South Carolina that teach such things. =\r\nIf there is anyone on this \n&gt; group that could help me I would be greatly h=\r\nonored. Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jacob Ross\n&gt;\n\n\nApparently you haven&#39;t done enough r=\r\neading. Long story short, you are\ntalking about a few people during the Edo=\r\n period, who lived long after\nthere were any battles to fight, and they cou=\r\nld therefore afford to\nmake a religion out of being a &quot;Samurai&quot;.\n\nMight wan=\r\nt to take a look at the &quot;Misconceptions of the Samurai&quot;, on\nthe front page =\r\nof this group, and start reading history books, rather\nthan philosophy.  \n\n=\r\nOtherwise, welcome!\n\n\n\n\n"
