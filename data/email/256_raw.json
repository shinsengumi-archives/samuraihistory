Frazier&quot; &lt;punish10@...&gt;\r\n\r\n    In regard to the ninja straight sword, something I would like to add to\nthis discussion may shed some light on the subject. I couldn&#39;t say\nspecifically or without doubt that ninja did or did not use some different\nsort of weapon.\n    What I CAN say, though, is that ninja, if you consider them with some\nmodicum of common sense, were samurai. The &quot;Ninjitsu&quot; art is very skilled\nand shows traces of the higher teachings of other martial arts belonging to\nfamilies of very high social status, including the Imperial family.\n    Arts such as these were not taught to the common soldier. More\nspecifically, they were rarely, if ever, taught to people outside the family\nor clan. The ninja arts you see on the hyped up television shows are more\nlike karate, an art developed by peasants. The actual art of ninjitsu is\nMUCH different. It is more like jujutsu, involving joint locks, pressure\npoints, balance breaking, and all the other fundamental principles of the\nsecret arts of the samurai clans.\n    What you must consider here is that ninja were not assassins sent to\nmurder the common folk. Soldiers would have done just fine for that task.\nNinja were assassins designated for murdering members of the higher social\nstatus.\n    Send an ill-trained man to take out someone like Oda Nobunaga, Ieyesu\nTokugawa, Shingen Takeda, etc, and what you would likely end up with is a\nbotched assassination. Yes, it&#39;s true that any man can be gotten to, but men\nof such stature were not so easy to kill, and only a fool would send a lacky\nfor such an important task knowing that if he failed, the blame might come\nback on him. Japanese bravery or not, torture can motivate a lot of people.\n    Therefore, it is my educated guess that ninja had to be of at least\nsamurai status in order to have the training necessary to lay low someone so\nwell trained in the martial arts as the people they were sent to\nassassinate. If they are samurai, then it is not likely they used anything\ndifferent than the typical samurai katana.\n    IF they used something different, it would have been for some sort of\npractical purpose, like ease of movement, or the ability to move unhindered\nin tight quarters. After all, they did not walk up to the front door and\nannounce that they were there to assassinate someone, and I imagine it would\nhave been cumbersome trying to scale a castle wall in the fancy samurai garb\nand protruding katana at the hip. A shoulder harness would have been\nappropriate for such tasks, and a curved katana blade would have been more\ndifficult to draw from such a position.\n    Sooo, although I am of the opinion that the ninja did not carry straight\nswords, I can see the practicality in it given their task and the\ncircumstances surrounding the completion of it. The curved katana might have\nbeen a better weapon, but the ninja did not intend to pitch battle. They\nintended a sword in the back.\n    This, of course, is all just opinion and conjecture, but as with most\nthings, if you take a look at the root of something, a lot of truths come to\nthe surface.\n\n\nAlex\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: erik baker &lt;musashieb@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001 9:51 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] The origins of the Ninja straight sword.\n\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; The ninja straight sword is a myth.  They used some\n&gt; interesting tools but for the most part their entire\n&gt; legend is movie myth.\n&gt;\n&gt; Steven turnbull wrote a hard to get book called the\n&gt; ninja that sets out all the myth and seperates it from\n&gt; the truth.\n&gt;\n&gt; The ninja were called shinobi among other things and\n&gt; it is believed that this idea came from sun tzu among\n&gt; other old chinese sources.  Usually the &quot;ninja&quot; were\n&gt; guys that would sneak in to a castle and set fire or\n&gt; cause confusion in an enemy camp.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is more but you can get the bokk by ordering\n&gt; from amazon.uk\n&gt;\n&gt; Musashi\n&gt; --- Eamon Murray &lt;eamonbm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hey listka,\n&gt; &gt;                Does anyone here know the origin of\n&gt; &gt; the ninja straight sword?\n&gt; &gt; And would they share this information?
