To be honest, I&#39;m not a big movie person, and I&#39;m \neven less of a Tom Cruise fan, even if I do like some of his older work (Top \nGun and A Few Good Men being personal faves).  I&#39;d much rather read the book.  \nHence, the question about Clavell&#39;s novel, Shogun.  I&#39;m thinking of seeing \nJason v Freddie, but only because it&#39;s been anticipated for how long now?.  (And \nI&#39;m not a slasher fan either.)  To be honest, if I thought back on the last \nfive movies I saw in the theater, I&#39;d be hardpressed, it would go back nearly \nthree years and the only non-cartoon would be My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\n       Anyway,  thanks for the info on Shogun at any rate.  (Yeah, I know \nthis is the third time I&#39;ve said that.  :-)!)\n\nLater\nTim\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
