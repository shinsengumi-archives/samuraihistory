Thank you for that information. I will probably \n&gt;have time to look for it next month. I have always wanted to find it, even \n&gt;if there is nothing there but a marker stone. I had never seen that \n&gt;photograph either.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jonathan P Ellgen\n&gt;\n&gt;tokyo dog &lt;tokyodog@...&gt; wrote:                                  With a \n&gt;google search, I found a photo of the stone marker for the original\n&gt;  Honnoji. The stone marker is bigger than I had recollected. Funny how \n&gt;memory\n&gt;  can play tricks. But the brick columns of the building behind it looks \n&gt;just\n&gt;  like the commercial office building I remember. To my recollection, the\n&gt;  commercial office building looked like it had been built relatively\n&gt;  recently.\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://www.sankei-kansai.com/03_kikaku/kyoto/26/pic01_2.html\n&gt;\n&gt;  _____\n&gt;\n&gt;  From: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;[mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt;  On Behalf Of tokyo dog\n&gt;  Sent: Friday, February 09, 2007 5:31 AM\n&gt;  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Subject: [samuraihistory] location of original Honnoji, marker for\n&gt;  Nobunaga&#39;s death\n&gt;\n&gt;  Regarding the marker for the site of Nobunaga&#39;s death, I walked out there\n&gt;  and found it when I was visiting Kyoto last March or April, on a weekend\n&gt;  visit. First, I made the mistake of going directly to the current \n&gt;Honnoji,\n&gt;  but was told that Honnoji had been relocated since Nobunaga&#39;s death. The \n&gt;guy\n&gt;  at the temple pointed me in the general direction to go, but I really \n&gt;didn&#39;t\n&gt;  know the exactly location. So with some difficulty, I eventually figured \n&gt;out\n&gt;  where the marker was located so I could hike out to find it. I found the\n&gt;  location by visiting a nearby museum of history that was very close to\n&gt;  Honnoji. The museum had historical maps and tourist maps for sale, and I\n&gt;  asked a woman at the museum information booth where the old Honnoji was.\n&gt;  Between the two of us, we searched one of the maps and we figured out \n&gt;where\n&gt;  the old Honnoji was. If I recall correctly, it was about a twenty minute\n&gt;  twenty-five minute walk from Honnoji. When I found it, the marker was \n&gt;pretty\n&gt;  non-descript. The marker was relatively modest grey stone, to my\n&gt;  recollection perhaps 70-80 centimeters tall, located in a very \n&gt;non-descript\n&gt;  residential neighborhood. The marker itself was located immediately in \n&gt;front\n&gt;  of the commercial office of a model house showroom and an elementary \n&gt;school.\n&gt;  The kids were laughing, playing, shouting in the background. I don&#39;t \n&gt;think\n&gt;  that I have a photo of it. I&#39;m not much of a photography kind of guy.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;  Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;  _____\n&gt;\n&gt;  From: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;  yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@\n&gt;  &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt; yahoogroups.com]\n&gt;  On Behalf Of Anthony Bryant\n&gt;  Sent: Friday, February 09, 2007 4:54 AM\n&gt;  To: samuraihistory@ &lt;mailto:samuraihistory%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;  yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: death of nobunaga and jube yagyu\n&gt;\n&gt;  On Feb 7, 2007, at 4:07 PM, Nate Ledbetter wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Actually, theres&#39; a small marker in front of some\n&gt;  &gt; building--I thing it&#39;s a hotel--that marks the former\n&gt;  &gt; spot of the Honnoji.
