One group dealt with barbarians like\nMongols and Manchurians in the North, which favored\ncombining calvary and archers(usually on horse) and\nthe other group in the South was specialized in\ndealing with the Japanese pirates who were very\nskilled in using swords and spears.\n\n300,000 Ming soldiers were from the Southern group\nspecialized in the Japanese warfare.\nAfter the war, Yi dynasty also adopted and started\nmanufacturing arquebus and put more emphasis on\ntraining the use of swords and spears.\n\nWith regard to the topics of diplomatic issues among\nMing, Japan, and Yi dynasty, the following book will\nbe of use:\n\nThe Book of Corrections: Reflections on the National\nCrisis During the Japanese Invasion of Korea,\n1592-1598 (Korea Research Monograph, No 28)\nby Song-Nyong Yu, et al (Paperback - December 2002) \n\nSong-Nyong Yu was a prime minister during the war and\nwas also a very close friend to Admiral Yi, Sun-Shin\nfrom the childhood. Admiral Yi did not hold any higher\ncommanding position until he was appointed to command\nthe western fleet through Prime minister Song&#39;s strong\nrecommendation only a few years before the war. He was\nnot even trained for the Navy.\n\nAlso, the Yi Royal court published the military\ntraining manual for the use of spears and swords after\nthe war. Its English translation is also available:\n\nMuye Dobo Tongji : Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of\nMartial Arts of Ancient Korea\nby Muye Dobo Tongji, et al (Paperback - October 2000) \n\nLastly, for the TV series on the war, MBC broadcasted\nthe TV series on the war in the late 80&#39;s when I was\nin the middle school. It was so good that it got an\nair through NHK(Japan). You may check both of\nbroadcasting companies for more information.\nAlso, KBS aired the documentray series on the war in\n1995(?). It was not superb, but you can see real\nweapons used and the battle scenes not great in\npicture but constructed by a group of contemporary\nmilitary officers and war experts.  I hope that this\nwill help.\n\n\n\n\n \n                         Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Changsub Lee\n\n\n--- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; It actually happened, in Korea, 1592-98. The Ming\n&gt; celestial army \n&gt; crossed the Yalu River and pushed the Japanese\n&gt; samurai army way back \n&gt; south. It might be said, thou, that the Chinese were\n&gt; 300,000, while the \n&gt; whole Japanese troops who entered the conflict\n&gt; numbered some \n&gt; 150,000-and by no means they were all there to fight\n&gt; the Chinese. After \n&gt; the push South, the situation stalemated, basically\n&gt; until Hideyoshi&#39;s \n&gt; death in 1598.\n&gt; A very good article on these battles is in the\n&gt; &quot;Cambridge History of \n&gt; Japan&quot; vol .4. The book costs $150,- but its easily\n&gt; found virtually in \n&gt; every university library.\n&gt; Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai Invasion,&quot; instead, concentrates\n&gt; mostly on Japanese \n&gt; and Korean sources-very few words abt the Ming army.\n&gt; I am not aware of any movie about the Japanese\n&gt; invasion of Korea. Does \n&gt; anybody know of any?? Maybe made in Korea or in\n&gt; China??\n&gt; Cepo, Honolulu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 15, 2003, at 5:13 PM, Atisi Kazuari wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know I haven&#39;t posted in a while, but in reading\n&gt; the latest posts\n&gt; &gt; regarding European Knight vs Samurai, one has to\n&gt; wonder how a Samurai\n&gt; &gt; vs his Chinese fighting equavilent. This stems\n&gt; from spending the last\n&gt; &gt; 48 hours reading and watching both old school\n&gt; kung(also gung)-fu\n&gt; &gt; movies and Kurasawa films.
