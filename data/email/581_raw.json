(School of Oriental and \nAfrican studies-Try a search for it). \n It is in central London and runs some very good courses on Japanese History, \nart, Eastern philosophies, and other subjects..The history section would \ninclude the Heian period, through to the Showa period and this includes \nobviously the Sengoku Jidai..Although I have never seen a course specifically \nfocussed on that era alone...I would find that amazing if there is one..Much \nof my knowledge is specifically on that period and the course would be very \nworthwhile to do..Keep us informed if you find one like this.\n Abayo.\n Ben Sharples.\n\n"
