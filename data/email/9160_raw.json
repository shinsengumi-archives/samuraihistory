I know when 2 samurai battled, they\ndid this by riding out to mid field, stating their \n&gt;name and lineage, then attaching. How would this be stated?\n&gt;&quot;I am Sanematsu Yoshihide of the clan Minamoto from the Satsuma\nProvinces---(now I&#39;m lost. Does he say en guard \n&gt;or what?? Or is this anywhere near what he&#39;d say?&quot;)\n&gt;Thanks in advance\n&gt;Kay Swanson w/a Kei Swanson\n \nIf the war tales like the Heike Monogatari and the Taiheiki are to be\nbelieved, then a samurai might ride ahead of the army, announce his name\nand pedigree, and challenge someone from the opposing army to attack\nhim. One example from Helen Craig McCullough&#39;s translation of the\nTaiheiki, where two warriors race ahead of their own army to be first in\nto battle:\n \n&quot;We are the lay monk Hitomi Shiro On&#39;a, aged seventy-two, a resident of\nthe province of Musashi, and Homma Kuro Sukesada, aged thirty-six, a\nresident of the province of Sagami, who since leaving Kamakura have been\nresolved to perish in battle ahead of our comrades! Let those who are\nself-confident come forth to observe the degree of our skill!&quot;\n \nChallenges like this were an attempt to earn recognition on the\nbattlefield, which was the best way for a samurai to be rewarded for his\nservice. If the samurai died the rewards earned by his valour would be\npassed on to his family, which was the intent of the two warriors above.\n \nActs like this would likely have been far more usual in Kamakura &\nMuromachi (12th through 15th C.) times when armies were smaller and\nbattles more intimate than in Sengoku times when armies consisted mainly\nof ashigaru foot soldiers acting in mass formations.\n \n-AngusH\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis email (including any attachments to it) is confidential, legally privileged, subject to copyright and is sent for the personal attention of the intended recipient only.
