First, negptiations were going on between the\nToyotomi and Hojo for at least two years prior to\nHideyoshi&#39;s invasion of the Kanto. Ieyasu was a the\nintermediary between the two as he was allied to both.\nHe had even sent relatives to live with Hojo. Ieyasu,\nhowever aligned himself with Hideyoshi and urged the\nHojo to submit. They of course did not do that, though\nUjimasa had plenty of opportunity to do so.\n\n2; Given Hideyoshi&#39;s past conduct, Ujimasa may have\nexpected to remain in power even after a war.\nHideyoshi generally treated his defeated foes well,\nleaving them in power in exchange for oaths of\nallegiance (shimazu, chosokabe, mori, etc.). Once the\nHojo submitted, however, he confiscated all of their\nlands, and installed Ieyasu in the Kanto. Hideyoshi\nseems to have decided the fate of the Hojo well\nbeforehand. \nIt&#39;s also interesting that Hojo Ujimori eventually\nreceived a fief in Kawachi. Not sure what happened to\nhim...\n\n3: this brings up the point of position. The Kanto is\nwell removed from the Kinai, and did not offer a good\nposition from which to gain control of the country.\nThat seems to be why Hideyoshi put Ieyasu there, he\ndidn&#39;t trust him. Of course, the Kanto is the most\nproductive region of Japan and I would imagine that\nwhoever controlled it could affect the rice market,\nalthough I&#39;ve never read anything about that...maybe\nthe rest of the nation produced enough.\n\n4: During the seige, lords came out of the north to\npledge allegience to Hideyoshi, including Date,\nUtsunomiya and Satake, thus the Hojo were the last\nholdouts. They must have seen that they could expect\nno help.\n\nthe way things turn out...! Soun would&#39;ve been ticked!\n\n-JDS\nps- thanks for the info on Tsutsui.\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"
