He tells me he needs money to send the\n&gt; sword for inspection, \n&gt; \n&gt; If the item is as he said, I would probably do the\n&gt; same thing.  It would \n&gt; keep it from being a total lost if it was sent to\n&gt; someone who did not \n&gt; return it.

HE&#39;S A\nSCAM ARTIST. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME EMAILING HIM! As\nCEPO said, he&#39;s baaack....when someone posts that, it\nshould be a clue to you that we&#39;ve dealt with him\nbefore. Anyone stop to think why he emailed you\nindividually? It&#39;s because he CANNOT post on the\nlist--us moderator types will immediately delete his\nemail and ban him, AGAIN. \n\nQuit wasting your time with him. \n\nNate\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
