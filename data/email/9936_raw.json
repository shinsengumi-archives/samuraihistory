A step that would have answered =\r\nthe question itself.Now, in spite of that rant, my intention was never actu=\r\nally to insult mc curio, but rather my initial response to AJ&#39;s answer beca=\r\nuse I initially spaced out what curio could possibly be referring to and AJ=\r\n made me laugh.\n&gt; Wasn&#39;t aware I (nor anyone else for that matter) was expe=\r\ncted to censor my response for fear of hurting someone&#39;s feelings (don&#39;t wo=\r\nrry, you didn&#39;t hurt mine, I&#39;m just explaining my intentions), and if I did=\r\n I formally apologize to curio, though that bad karma is likely countered b=\r\ny the silly feelings possibly transferred to AJ and a few others.And I actu=\r\nally mainly became interested in the material via much more erudite relativ=\r\nes of the media you mentioned. Specifically: anime and comics (in the oppos=\r\nite order).
