If you were left-handed, you\nsimply \ntrained to be proficient either way.\n\nDid the Japanese &#39;train out&#39; left-handedness as the Europeans used\nto? I don&#39;t know.\n\nHaving said that the a swordsman would be proficient with either hand\n- as for example Miyamoto Musashi who is credited with founding the \nNiten Ichi Ryu (Two Heaven School) in which both swords are drawn - \nhis argument being if you have two swords why only use one? Even so, \nhe continued to wear both swords on the left side.\n\nI do not know the draw technique.\n\nI was once told by a collector he came across a short sword with the\ntang (the bit that goes into the hilt) curved the opposite way to the \nblade (so the whole thing looked vaguely S-shaped). He had been \ntold the sword had probably been made for a one-armed man, the \ncounter-curve of the tang helping the balance of the blade.\n\nUnfortunately it was impossible to tell which arm the man used!\n\nThomas \n\n\n\n"
