I should have given further amplification. The \n&gt;original conversation between a friend and I was mainly concerning \n&gt;art and architecture. I am a carpenter studying traditional \n&gt;farmhouse restoration. My friend in speaking of unrepairable damage \n&gt;was referring to restrictions in advancement enforced by the \n&gt;Tokugawas. \n&gt;\nThat&#39;s interesting, I have a fair collection of books on the subject \nalong with a fairly good working collection of tools. I use Western \nplanes, its what I learned on but I love the Japanese pull saws for \nbenchwork and cutting joints. The chisels and marking gauges are nice as \nwell.\n\n&gt;Our joke was that had Japan advanced at the same level as \n&gt;the west they would have central heating by now! In my view however \n&gt;much of Japans beauty lies in the lasting results of those \n&gt;enforcements. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMost gaijin love traditional Japanese houses, but most of the Japanese \nI&#39;ve talked to hate them so it might be a wash. It would be unlikely for \nme to meet an extremely traditional Japanese in the US though so my \nsample is biased.\n\n&gt;I could write a book of references here but I think these will \n&gt;suffice. Tsukahira -The sankin kotai system of Tokugawa Japan\n&gt;Totman- Politics in the Tokugawa bakufu.\n&gt;Nakamura- Ieyasuden\n&gt;Hall- Government and Local power in Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt;It was highly enjoyable and very interesting reading all the great \n&gt;responses. Thank you all!! \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo problem. It&#39;s easy for me to run off at the keyboard.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Ijin Mibu&quot; &lt;ijinmibu@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Benkei and Ushiwakamaru\n&gt;\n&gt;   I wanted to ask if anyone knows of Benkei and Ushiwakamaru the two \n&gt;tragic heroes of the kamakura period. The famed warriors of Kyoto, I \n&gt;think they lived sometime around the Genpei War. If you know anything \n&gt;please type back, thank you.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nType Yoshitsune into google and step back, Yoshitsune and Benkei are \nlike Robin Hood and Little John. You will be overwhelmed with \nwebsources. Ushiwakamaru works fairly well also. A quick peek shows some \nreasonable sites near the top.\n\nAlso since the Taiga drama that just finished is about them, anybody who \nwatches Japanese TV has probably heard of them.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n\n"
