May I post a photo of it? It \n\nAnn,\nThanks for sending the file to me. This is a kamon of the &quot;me-yui&quot; \ntype (\u001b$BL&#92;7k$$\u001b(B for those following along at home).\n\nThis one in particular is called &quot;ito-wa ni musubi yottsu-me&quot; (\u001b$B;eNX$K\u001b(B\n\u001b$B7k$S;M$DL&#92;\u001b(B). If it didn&#39;t have the circle around it it would just be \ncalled &quot;musubi yottsu-me&quot; (\u001b$B7k$S;M$DL&#92;\u001b(B).\n\nI&#39;m not sure what family this is associated with, other than to say \nthat many of the me-yui types of kamon are related to the Sasaki \nfamily of Shiga Prefecture (used to be called Oumi).\n\nHope this helps a little - and hope that others can provide even \nmore information for you.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
