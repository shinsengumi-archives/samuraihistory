In the Book Shogun by James Clavell, who was a prisoner of War in a Japanese WW II Prisoner Camp, where he learned a lot about the Japanese and saw many autrocities, later as a Novelist he wrote Shogun and made the  Lord Yabu a Shogun throughout the book,  but he is actually a ficticious figure and feudal lord.\n\nShaku-Oh-Cho\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Allan \n  To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, June 12, 2003 5:17 PM\n  Subject: [samuraihistory] just joined\n\n\n  Hello. I&#39;m looking for a historical japanese figure by the name \n  of &quot;Yabu&quot;. He was either a samurai or shogun. Can anyone help?\n\n\n        Yahoo!
