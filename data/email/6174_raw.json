It can be amusing... for a few minutes, if &quot;Desperate housewives&quot; isn&#39;t on at the moment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think you could watch &quot;Ooku&quot; and get the same effect, just in period \nclothes instead ;)\n\n&gt;   From: Gabriel Dodu &lt;dodu_gabriel@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hello everybody!\n&gt; \n&gt;I have long thought whether to &quot;break the silence&quot; and ask something, seeing as newcomers (newbies) are not always welcome and especially because english is not my native language...\n&gt;\nI think Nate and some others object to bad English only from people who \nshould know better. Second languages are tough, I still can get a laugh \nwith some of my mistakes in Japanese.\n\n&gt;Seeing that I am from the Eastern Europe, and books about Japan hardly get here (on-line shopping is out of the question for now, because, for example, Amazon does not cover my area - and also because I am somehow &quot;financially-challenged&quot; at the moment :D ), I mostly use the www. So, here is a list of sites that I use, please tell me if they are ok:\n&gt;2. Jim Breen&#39;s Japanese Page\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis is a great site.\n\n&gt;3. Nagasaki University Old Picture Database\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis is a great site.\n\n&gt;4. www.kanjisite.com\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThank you, I was unaware of this site and the random testing function is \nvery good.\n\n&gt;I would also appreciate if you could direct me to some online japanese literature books (public domain, of course), since I can&#39;t buy any ( I know I ask much...but, hey, hope dies last...)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m spoiled rotten for libraries, so I usually get my history from them. \nI think there is a site that reprints old Japanese texts in Japanese but \nI forgot the link name.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n\n\n\n"
