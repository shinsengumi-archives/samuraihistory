I am a graduate school student at\nCalifornia Sta=\r\nte University (CSUDH). My graduate research/thesis is on\nthe topic of seppu=\r\nku. I did about 2 years of research on the topic\nboth here and in Japan. Ho=\r\nwever, my advisor really doesnt like my\nideas. I need something more ground=\r\n-breaking to really make this a\ngood project. It is a difficult subject to =\r\ndevelope new ideas around.\nI am moving back to Japan in March, so it would =\r\nbe nice to get some\nmomentum before I leave. I am just wondering if anyone =\r\nhas any\ninnovative ideas on this topic. My   original plan was to show that=\r\n\nthe spirit of bushido is embodied in the practice of seppuku even to\nmoder=\r\nn times (ex. Yukio Mishima). \n\nThanks for reading and God Bless.\n\nJpellgen@=\r\nyahoo.com\nJpellgen@...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
