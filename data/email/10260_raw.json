He had the kuni all to himself?!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In sam=\r\nuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Francois BOUTRY wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From 1336 up to=\r\n about 1500/1520, each kuni had a leading daimyo : the shugo (see the list =\r\nin Grossberg&#39;s Japan&#39;s Renaissance). \n&gt; &gt; The shugo title appears almost up=\r\n to 1570 but, in most cases, it is an empty one during the XVIth century an=\r\nd a kuni belongs either to one or to several Sengoku daimyo who do not poss=\r\ness the shugo title i.e Mino to Sait=C3=83=C2=B4 and Izumo to Amako but Shi=\r\nnano, Mikawa, Harima or Aki to several warrior families. There are some exc=\r\neptions : the Shimazu, shugo of Satsuma and =C3=83&quot;sumi, the Takeda, shugo =\r\nof Kai or the Imagawa, shugo of Suruga\n&gt; &gt; To take another example : Etch=\r\n=C3=83=C2=BB and Noto are officially under two members (shugo) of the Hatak=\r\neyama family but, in fact, the first province is splitted between various v=\r\nassals of the Hatakeyama among which the leading familiers are the Jimb=C3=\r\n=83=C2=B4 and the Shiina. Similarly, in Noto, the leading families, among o=\r\nthers, are the Ch=C3=83=C2=B4 and the Yusa.\n&gt; &gt; Hope I have been usefull\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message du 07/11/10 20:39\n&gt; &gt; &gt; De : &quot;konohawolfie&quot; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; A : samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Copie =C3=83 : \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Objet : [=\r\nsamuraihistory] Simple Sengoku Daimyo Question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just a simple=\r\n question about daimyo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So each province/kuni had their own le=\r\nading daimyo, or the kuni functioned as a family base...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Like =\r\nthe Uesugi has Echigyo, Tokugawa has Mikawa, Rokkaku had Omi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSince the kuni are large and are split into districts, did the Samurai clan=\r\ns have a leader in each district to spread their influence? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; L=\r\nike, Kenshin could live at his castle (not sure where) in one distict and t=\r\nhe others can be ruled by his loyal retainers?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or did a provin=\r\nce had just one single daimyo leader?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n[Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n\n\n"
