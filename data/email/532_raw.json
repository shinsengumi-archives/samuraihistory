He claims to be &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; a Koga Ninja even though he is of Chinese\ndecent.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; i have this on Hanzo &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; HATTORI RYU&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; The Hattori Ryu, Momochi Ryu, and Fujibayashi\nRyu, were all descended &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; from Otomo no Saijin, who himself was a leading\nmember of one of &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Japans highest ranked families. As the Hattori,\nand Momochi families &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; were all commoners they used the same Mon (coat\nof arms).&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Iga Heinaizaemon no jo Ienaga one time, the head\nof the Hattori &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; family, gave permission for his sons to start\ntheir own lineage. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; These three were called Hattori Heitaro Koreyuki,\nHattori Heijiro &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Yasuyori, and Hattori Heijiro Yasunori. The\neldest son Koreyuki, &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; called his family &#39;Kamihattori&#39;, the middle son\nYasuyori named &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; his &#39;Nakahattori&#39;, and the youngest Yasunori,\ncalled his &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; family &#39;Shimohattori&#39;. The descendants of the\nHattori family &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; originated many centuries early from China, and\nwere at that time the &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; warlords of many provinces. For this reason they\nwere known by many &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; names, amongst which they were known as &quot;Kan\nKuni no Kami&quot; (Hattori &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; lords of Kan). &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Heitaro Koreyuki was the oldest son of Iga no jo\nIenaga, and as such &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; on his fathers death became the head of the\nKamihattori. The &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Kamihattori mon (crest) was known as Yahazu\nNihon, or, &quot;The two arrow &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; heads&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Heijiro Yasuyori, of the Nakahattori, had ties\nwith the Chinese Go &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; province, their Mon was called Ichitomoe, or,\n&quot;an arc&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Heijiro Yasunori, of the Shimohattori, was also\ncalled &quot;Ae Kuni no &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hattori&quot;, (The Hattori of Ae). The\nShimohattori Mon was called &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Yaguruma, &quot;The eight arrowheads in a\ncircle&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hanzo Hattori came from the Kamihattori branch of\nthe Hattori family. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; It is not fully known if he came from the Heitaro\nor the Chigachi &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; line (another branch of the Kamihattori\nfamily).&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; As well as the Hattori family, the Momochi, and\nFujibayashi were also &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; very prominent within the Ninja schools of\nIga.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; In 1567, Oda Nobunaga ordered his Samurai to\nattack the Iga province. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; The three Hattori families Kami, Naka, and Shimo\nwere almost &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; destroyed. Only 80 members of these three\npowerful families survived.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; As Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the\nthree branches of &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; the Hattori family dispersed to different area&#39;s\nof Japan. The &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Kamihattori fled to Nagaoka in Echigo. The\nNakahattori split into two &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; groups. One group went to went to Mikawa, to the\nprotection of, and &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; work in the service of the&nbsp; Tokugawa family,\nthe other half of the &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; group went to the Oichi family in Takatori, in\nYamato. The &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Shimohattori escaped to the safety of the\nmountains of Takano in &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Kishu.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hattori Masanari, and his son&nbsp; Hattori Hanzo\n(both from the &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Kamihattori), swore allegiance to Tokugawa\nIeyasu. Hanzo while &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; working for the Tokugawa held the rank of\n&#39;Shinobi Metsuke&#39;, and he &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; had served Ieyasu&#39;s grandfather Matsudaira\nKiyoyasu. Hanzo later, &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; with a friend, Shiro Tarao who was a Koga Ninja,\nhelped Tokugawa &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Ieyasu flee across Japan. They helped get Ieyasu\nto Okazakijo safely, &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; utilising the five ways of fleeing, and by\nsetting up special &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; defensive formations along the road, and by using\nNinja methods of &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; running. This all helped the Tokugawa eventually\nsucceed as Shoguns. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; The Hattori were not &quot;Watari Ninja&quot;\n(Ninja who moved around from one &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the\nTokugawa, and remained in &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; their service for many generations.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Masanari Hanzo, head of the Hattori family,\nreceived his training in &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; the martial arts, and Ninjutsu, from his father\nHattori Hanzo &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Yasunaga, when he was a child. He virtually grew\nup in the practice, &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; and tradition of the martial arts. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; When Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at\nnight, Hanzo was &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; young man of 16 years. For the skills that he\nused during the battle, &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; he earned himself a commendation. He was given\nthe name &quot;Hanzo the &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Ghost&quot;. Even Ieyasu recognised his skill.\nToday in the province of &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in use. In\nhis later years &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hanzo was also known as &quot;Hanzo the great\nlancer&quot; (Yari no Hanzo).&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi\nSamurai, and then came &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; to be known as &quot;Hattori Hanzo Iwami no\nKami&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; At one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with\nhim, each held the &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; rank of Doshin. He developed problems with these\nNinja and he found &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; it difficult to control them, and he relieved\nthem of their services. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; He then employed many more Ninja from Iga.\nSometime later in his &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; life, he became a Monk.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hanzo Hattori (above) was so famous that in the\nprovince of Mikawa &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; songs were written about him. One contained these\nlines:&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord Tokugawa has the finest warriors&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hanzo Hattori is Demon&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hanzo is Hanzo the Yari&quot;&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Some say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th\nDecember 1596, while &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; trying to bring the Ninja of the Fuma Ryu to\njustice. The date must &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; be wrong as Hanzo helped Ieyasu in the early\n1600&quot;s. The story of his &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; death says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two\nprotruding teeth), and &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; his Fuma Ryu originally came from Kanagawa. In\nsmall boats Hanzo and &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; his men chased the Fuma out to sea. This was a\nmistake on the behalf &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; of Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use\nof water, and &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; several swam under water, and began dismantling\nthe rudders of the &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; boats belonging to Hanzo. As their boats were now\ndisabled Hanzo&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; men decided to jump overboard, and swim to the\nnear by shore. When &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; they entered the water, they discovered that the\nwater was covered &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; with oil. To which the Fuma Ryu Ninja set fire,\nkilling all of the &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Tokugawa Samurai and Ninja including Hattori\nHanzo.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: &lt;a\nhref=&quot;http://www.samurai-archives.com&quot;&gt;http://www.samurai-archives.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email\nto:&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
