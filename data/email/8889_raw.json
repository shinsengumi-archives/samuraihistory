You also wrote:\n&gt;    Also interesting are the various positions in which a katana is \n&gt;    placed on\n&gt;    the floor at one&#39;s side when kneeling in front of another.\n\nI can hazard a few guesses at what would be involved, but I would be\nvery interested to hear what would have been the correct practise in\nthis circumstance.\n\nAlso on the topic of mounting tachi on a tachi-kake, you wrote:\n&gt; It is \n&gt;    incorrect\n&gt;    as is often seen, for the tsuka to be at the top when placed on a \n&gt;    proper\n&gt;    tachi stand.\n\nWhen I owned but one sword, my other half bought me a tachi-kake to\ndisplay it. I was aware at the time of how to correctly use it, but out\nof curiosity I experimented with mounting it the wrong way round, to see\nif I could deduce the reasoning behind the practise. I found two things,\n(a) the end of the saya (kojiri?) would try to escape from the small\nindentation in the base, and (b) due to the point of balance being\nsomewhat higher than it should be, the sword was easily dislodged.\nNeedless to say ever since, I&#39;ve always done as you previously outlined.\n\nIncidentally would I be right in thinking that a large weapon like a no-\ndachi/ou-dachi would also be displayed on a tachi-kake?\n\nYours\n\nDean\n\n***\nDean Wayland\n\n\n"
