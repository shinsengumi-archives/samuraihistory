It&#39;s ANIME. \n\nAnime: Japanese cartoons. Drawn. Inherently FICTION.\nDoesn&#39;t matter HOW realistic the artist wants to make\nit, it&#39;s still ART--not life.\n\n2. What anime are you watching? Most I&#39;m familiar with\n(Samurai X, Rurouni Kenshin)take place in the Edo\nperiod. No major wars occured during the Edo period.\nWhy would you walk around in armor if there weren&#39;t\nbattles to fight? Samurai wore armour when they needed\nto, didn&#39;t when they didn&#39;t. \n\n3. I&#39;m in the Army--I don&#39;t walk around all the time\nwith a helmet and flak vest on, even though that&#39;s\nwhat I would wear if I went into combat. Same with\nthem. \n\nApply a little common sense, and it all becomes clear.\n\n\n\nNate\n\n--- Syun Ukiya &lt;squartzph@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; why are some samurai wearing armor and some doesn&#39;t?\n&gt; the samurai \n&gt; animes I&#39;ve seen they hardly wear armor?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
