Its tragic, very serious and very well done. This \nversion of Kenshin shows us the &quot;man-killer&quot; side of him that he once \nwas. I would recommend this to anyone, even those not &quot;into&quot; anime.\n\nThe TV series version of Kenshin is quite different and takes place \nseveral years after the events in the OAV.  It is long (96 or so \nepisodes) and although overall the plots are serious, the Kenshin of \nthe TV series now wields the &quot;sword that protects&quot; and the characters \ntend to be more over the top as only anime characters can be.  The TV \nseries has great characters, good storylines and Kenshin displays a \nwonderful (if idealistic) code of honor that we would all wish to \nlive up to.  This series would appeal mostly though to those already \nversed in anime and all that this style of animation entails or to \nthose just looking for a great story with great characters. Those \nlooking strictly for &quot;history&quot; would not be into it.\n\n\n"
