When searching around \non the web, or reading through books I see mention of court titles \nsuch as Gyobusho (court minister), and ranks such as vassals and \nretainers. However, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to actually find a \nlayout of the ranks in these sorts of hierarchies and what came above \nthem, below them. Such as: The Daimyo, below him he had vassals (how \ndid he choose who were to be his vassals?) and what is the difference \nbetween a Vassal and a Retainer? Ideally I&#39;d like to find out what \nthe ranking system was for both the court and the countries military \nwas (not just the Daimyos). And, even better, the Imperial Guards.\nAlso, does anyone know if this hierarchy changed when Yoritomo began \nthe trend of Shogun leaders rather then Royal heads of state?\n\n\n\n"
