Thus I hope I \nam not going off-topic here. Ok, once I am done with my excuse, here is \nmy question: the Japanese campaign in East Asia and in the Pacific was \nclearly a hopeless hyperbole. There was NO WAY the Japanese could \ncontrol and man such a vast area. After Guadalcanal, then, it was clear \nthat the wind had changed, still there was room for diplomacy, either \nwith the US and perhaps with what was left of China and the Soviets. \nBut the Japanese kept fighting and dying until August 1945.\nWhy?\nI have my own theories, but before throwing them on the table, I&#39;d love \nto hear from some of you.\nThanks\ncepo\nPS= subquestion; is the &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; a good movie? Worth 3 hours of \nmy life and the $3,99 at block buster?\n\n\n"
