Both these books \nhave quite a lot about Takasugi Shinsaku in them, especially the Craig. To \nget more information on Shinsaku - I don&#39;t know what else to suggest \nunless you read Japanese abd can look at Japanese amazon for what \nthey&#39;ve got there. I think someone (Hide?) gave a link once before.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
