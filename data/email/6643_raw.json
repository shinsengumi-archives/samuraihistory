Jansen has some very good stuff \non him and his background (S.R. and the Meiji Restoration pp154 et \nseq). Is this book in your library? Might be worth buying if not.\n\nMy Dictionary of Modern Japanese History has the following:\n\n1823-1899\nnative of Edo and bakufu retainer, K trained in Dutch studies and \nWestern military science. In 1855 he became an official translator of \nWestern books then a naval student at Nagasaki. 1860 captained the \nKanrinmaru on first Japanese crossing of Pacific.On his return taught \ngunnery and naval affairs and established first naval school at Hyogo in \n1863, Built up bakufu navy. Students came from different han - one \nwas Sakamoto (who legend has it went to assassinate Katsu but ended \nup an ardent disciple). This was the start of Katsu&#39;s strong contacts \nwith the loyalists. The degree of modernisation which he propounded \nand the divergence of his views from many servants of the bakufu led \nconservatives to press for his dismissal in 1864, but was restored to \nfavour under Tokugawa keiki and served as major contact with \nbakufu&#39;s opponents. In 1868 negotiated with Saigo for peacefull \nsurrender of Edo. Acted as deputy navy minister for new regime 1872\n-73 and in various other government posts. Wrote histories of army, \nnavy, bakufu, opening of country and memoirs.\n\n(which I would like to read!)\n\nOne time I was in Japan I saw a &quot;Sonotoki&quot; documentary on him which \nmight still be in the NHK website archives.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n\n"
