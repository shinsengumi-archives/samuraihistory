The \n&gt; word brings up enough discussion from time to time\n&gt; that it&#39;s \n&gt; probably impossible to declare with finality what is\n&gt; the &#39;right&#39; \n&gt; pronunciation.\n\nJay, I think that seems to be the case. It&#39;s like\npeople who romanize an &quot;n&quot; before a b as a &quot;m&quot;,\nbecause it gets blended that way, versus those of us\nwho write it as an &quot;n&quot;, because that&#39;s what an �� IS,\ndang it, no matter how you SAY it. \n\nDifference here is that it changes the actual vowel\npronunciation. However, like the difference between\njuupun 10 min and jippun 10 min, I think it is\nprobably regional--I never *heard* jippun when I was\nfirst studying Japanese, until someone made a point of\nit. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
