I would agree with you if\n&gt; he was in/=\r\ngoing to Japan and/or wanted to show off his tattoos to\n&gt; Japanese people t=\r\no show how much of a Samurai he is, but I didn&#39;t\n&gt; really get that impressi=\r\non. It seemed pretty innocent, actually. So\n&gt; since it seemed to me that it=\r\n was an innocent request by an american\n&gt; in america, it was easy for me to=\r\n take your statement as a statement\n&gt; of your personal feelings for tattoos=\r\n.  And I&#39;ve seen plenty of people\n&gt; in Japan with tattoos, it isn&#39;t as bad =\r\nas it used to be.  I even knew\n&gt; a Japanese highschool teacher with tattoos=\r\n around his collarbone,\n&gt; where he could hide it.  Schoolteachers are &quot;supp=\r\nosed&quot; to be\n&gt; respectable. Anyway, you really can&#39;t make a blanket statemen=\r\nt that\n&gt; &quot;NO &#39;respectable&#39; Japanese person would get a tattoo&quot;, because it\n=\r\n&gt; would only take one person to get one to make your entire statement\n&gt; fal=\r\nse. I just percieved a subjective argument and played devil&#39;s\n&gt; advocate an=\r\nd tried to poke holes in it.  That&#39;s all.\n&gt;\nREPLY\nSo funny how some people =\r\nlove to judge others!\nthis is my way of honoring my masters! and thats it!\n=\r\n\nT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
