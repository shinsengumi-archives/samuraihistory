Hussars used the saber.  The\npoint of the straight sword was used most often, while the saber was\nprobably used more for slashing.  Obviously, we are drifting far from Japan.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From:\ttom.davidson@...

Oh for a well-\n&gt; made tachi then!\n&gt; \n&gt; Nate - do you know why (and am I right in thinking) that the US never took\n&gt; up the lance?
