But perhaps Prof Murphy was referring to its first use on \nthe battlefield?\n\nBob Burke\n\n\nIn a message dated 1/14/04 1:07:11 AM, murphymurphyjohn@... writes:\n\n&lt;&lt; The Gatling gun was apparently first used at Petersburg, VA, in the \nAmerican \nCivil War in 1864-5.  It was formally adopted in 1866 by the US Army.  \nIndeed, \none of the factors that brought about Custer&#39;s disastrous defeat in 1876 was \nthat he apparently disdained to bring along a Gatling gun detachment because \nit would slow  him up!  Thus,  it is entirely possible that a friendly \ncountry \nlike Meiji Japan could have been shipped some by the 1877 rebellion.
