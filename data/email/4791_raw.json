Where \ndid they live?  Amongst who, villages, farms?  Who did they rule?\n\nHalf the time, as per the &quot;alternate residence&quot; rule instituted by \nthe Tokugawa, they spent their time in Edo. At other times, they \nwould have had residences either in towns or mansions of their own. \nOnly one castle was permitted per province during this period, which \nled to a large number of castles being torn down, although many had \ntheir keeps moved and incorporated into other castles.\n\n&gt; 200-300 Daimyo families during the Tokugawa era.  How many were in \nthe family?  Who and why did they fight?  Who trains Daimyo?\n\nIt varies from family to family. Other than immediate family \nmembers, a household would also consist of retainers. Several \nfamilies had multiple, often distantly connected, branches. The \nMatsudaira for example - there were a lot of Matsudaira daimyo.\n\nFor the most part, they didn&#39;t fight. Apart from a few peasant \nuprisings, the Edo period was mostly peaceful.\n\nAs for &quot;training&quot;, households would have retainers, or hired \nscholars for that. In earlier times, it wasn&#39;t uncommon for children \nto be sent to temples for their education - Uesugi Kenshin, for \nexample, spent seven years at the Rinzen-ji between the ages of 7-\n14, although that was partly forced by the civil war in his own clan.\n\n&gt; Did they train their young?\n\nOf course.\n\n&gt; I realize the simplicity of the questions again, and maybe some of \nthem don&#39;t make any sense -- but, I need this information.  I&#39;m \nhaving a hard time getting a grasp on what a daimyo samurai is.  I \nnot retarded, I&#39;ve read up on samurai.  I&#39;ve done google searches as \nsuggested. \n\nIn *very* simplistic terms:\nA &quot;samurai&quot; is a member of the military class of feudal Japan. Note \nthat you didn&#39;t need to know how to fight to be a samurai in Edo-\nperiod Japan - you simply had to be a member of that social class.\n\nA &quot;daimyo&quot; was a military governor, who administered lands on behalf \nof/by the grace of the Shogun&#39;s government. Daimyo were appointed \nfrom samurai families, but not every samurai was a daimyo - in the \nsame way that not every member of the military is a general.\n\n\n"
