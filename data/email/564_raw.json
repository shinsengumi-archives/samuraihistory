I&#39;ve found this books,\n&gt; -Samurai Warriors,   Guild Publishing; 1987\n&gt; -The Book of the Samurai - The Warrior Class of Japan,   (?)1982\n&gt; -The Sumurai: A Military History.   Guild (BCA) , 1988, at a good\n&gt; price and would like to know if anyone has them and if they are any\n&gt; good. I ordered &quot;Samurai Warfare&quot; and &quot;The Samurai Source Book&quot;\n&gt; through Amazon and was wondering if the above complete each other or\n&gt; are redundant.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Nuno\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
