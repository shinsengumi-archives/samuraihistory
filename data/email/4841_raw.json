The other was headed by\n&gt; Honda Masanobu, \n&gt; who wasn&#39;t known as a great warrior (due to an\n&gt; illness he suffered \n&gt; during his youth, I vaguely recall reading that this\n&gt; might have been \n&gt; polio, but I might be confusing that with Date\n&gt; Masamune), but \n&gt; Masanobu acted in a diplomatic and administrative\n&gt; role for the \n&gt; Tokugawa. He was also known as a political schemer,\n&gt; but was very \n&gt; close to Ieyasu, and later Hidetada. Another fairly\n&gt; vague \n&gt; recollection I have is that the founder of Honda\n&gt; Motor Corp. was \n&gt; descended from this branch of the family.\n\nMy understanding, though there is a high chance I&#39;m\nconfused, is that Honda Tadakatsu (�{�������jand Honda\nMasanobu (�{�c���M�jwere in fact NOT related, as\nevidenced by the different kanji for &quot;Honda&quot; that you\nsee. What I&#39;m not sure about is the actual kanji for\nMasanobu&#39;s &quot;Honda&quot;--I&#39;ve seen it both ways, and not\nsure if it&#39;s just carelessness on one side or the\nother. I&#39;m currently at work and not able to look for\nthe correct kanji, so if someone could help out?\n\nEither way, I believe the car company is �{�c, so\npossibly a relation to Masanobu, but definitely not\none of Tadakatsu. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
