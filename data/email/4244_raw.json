I GUARANTEE you will be awed by it. It&#39;s the best ww2 movie ever made... there&#39;s no close second. It&#39;s based on actual events, too. The interviews with the actual guys who were there are pretty good, too. But remember it&#39;s a ten part miniseries, with hour long episodes.  So rent it and watch a couple of the episodes a night, and you&#39;ll knock it out pretty quick. Sounds really good on surround sound, too. But there aren&#39;t any japanese in it if I remember right... it happens on the European front...\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There are 7 messages in this issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Topics in this digest:\n&gt; \n&gt;       1.

By this point Japan has been\n&gt; mucking about in Korea and China for decades and showing their talent\n&gt; for colonial administration. I.E. virtually none. Previous to this they\n&gt; had already attacked Americans, read up on the Panay. These actions and\n&gt; others lead to the embargoes and other sanctions. Military dictatorships\n&gt; don&#39;t make good neighbors and are generally poor at diplomacy.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I also feel that the US has to bear a good portion of the blame -\n&gt; &gt;you have to remember that the Japanese people&#39;s only experience of the US\n&gt; &gt;was being forced to trade at gunpoint, and the US invasion of Hawaii because\n&gt; &gt;they were holding a referendum which would have made Hawaii a Japanese, not\n&gt; &gt;American, state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; The original treaty also dealt with treating shipwrecked sailors like\n&gt; humans and other things along those lines, this is close to 90 years\n&gt; before, I&#39;ve never heard of the referendum to make Hawaii a Japanese\n&gt; state, I doubt it would have come close to passing since the number of\n&gt; anglos, Hawaiians and Chinese far exceeded the number of Japanese on the\n&gt; island. Even if just the Hawaiians voted, they felt they could stay an\n&gt; independent country at the time. The US backed coup came as an\n&gt; unpleasant surprise. P.S. Look up the difference in the US between a\n&gt; territory and a state, It took about 60 years for Hawaii to become a state.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Plus in nearby Phillipines they had seen the Americans\n&gt; &gt;invade the islands and then keep it as a colony. Are they the actions of a\n&gt; &gt;state that you would trust in their position?? I suppose it is little wonder\n&gt; &gt;that no diplomatic solution was ever reached.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; We were late to the colonial game, so we got the leftovers that the UK,\n&gt; France and Germany didn&#39;t want. We should have freed them like we did\n&gt; with Cuba. This still has little bearing on Japan&#39;s actions, they were\n&gt; an aggressive, expansionist, military dictatorship that had set out to\n&gt; conquer Asia, this would have lead to war no matter what and the US\n&gt; tried diplomatic means to prevent it including not going to war over\n&gt; attacking US citizens and soldiers.\n&gt; \n&gt; In some ways these does show samurai spirit, a bunch of bloody minded\n&gt; killers who are going to take what they want and only understand force\n&gt; as an argument. Which makes them no different from their European\n&gt; counterparts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Message: 2\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2004 14:54:52 +0300\n&gt;    From: &quot;Edward Alexander&quot; &lt;edy@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Tsuruga-jo and other forgotten castles\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey all,\n&gt; Can you tell me more about castles like Tsuruga-jo,Hirosaki-jo.....\n&gt; Please!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Edy\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Message: 3\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2004 08:40:52 -0700\n&gt;    From: Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: OT? = Re: WWII... why?\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with Nate Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers are great, Two others \n&gt; I liked were Enemy at the Gates as well as Stalingrad.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Nate Ledbetter \n&gt;   To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, April 14, 2004 1:48 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: OT? = Re: [samuraihistory] WWII... why?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Windtalker was hideous.
