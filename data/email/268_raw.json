There is an old martial art (the name of which \nescapes\n&gt; me for the moment) which is, essentially, &quot;wrestling in armour.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a very practical thing to learn to do, if you&#39;re an armoured \nwarrior\n&gt; who periodically has to fight in close quarters. You learn how to \ngrab and\n&gt; secure people wearing armour (where to grab, etc.) and how to avoid \nbeing\n&gt; grabbed while in armour.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n\n\n"
