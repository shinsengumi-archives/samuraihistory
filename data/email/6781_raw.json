I know that after Hideyoshi Toyotomi died in \n1598 his son took command but then quickly lost it to Ieyasu \nTokugawa. I&#39;ve learned that Osaka castle, which was Hideyoshi&#39;s \nheadquarters, was destroyed by Tokugawa. Now my question here is how \nwas it destroyed was it burned to the ground? Oh yeah one more thing \nhow did Hideyoshi die was he murdered or did he die of natural \ncauses?\n\nThanks everybody,\nG3mneye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
