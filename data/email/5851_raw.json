Like you all are, I am too, familiar with Shaku etc. I was \ninterested (seeing as what Japans secondary measurement is) seeing what your \nsecondary measurement was. Harry, I laughed myself to within a gnats c**k of \na heart attack, and you can&#39;t put that into metric either.\n\nCan I just use this airtime to remind you all of the forthcoming &quot;Tosho: The \nYoshihara Tradition of Japanese Swordmaking&quot; Exhibition at the Pacific Asia \nMuseum in Pasadena CA. It is from March to June next year.(Just a little \ntopical side-note about myself, I cared for the swords in the British Museum \nexhibition from when they were newly polished in 2000, up until Feb 2003).  \nAdditionally the Pacific Asia Museum is a private, non-profit museum. They \nare trying to raise the final $10,000 at the moment for the exhibition \ncatalogue, if anyone can assist it would be greatly appreciated. If you \nwould like to make a donation, please contact the Museum and specify that \nthe donation is for the catalogue. The catalogue will contain historically \ninteresting pictures of Shodai Kuniie, as well as photography of great \nswords including A  large katana by shodai Kuniie with a fantastic horimono, \nOno Yoshimitsu&#39;s Yamatorige (photographed by Fujishiro Okisato) and many \nswords by the Yoshihara family members and former deshi. Please keep an eye \non the Pacific Asia Museum website for updates.\n\nhttp://www.pacificasiamuseum.org/calendar/exhibits.htm\n\nYours, trying to bring Japanese sword exhibitions to the west.\n\nPaul Martin\n\nwww.traditionaloshigata.com\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Paul Martin&quot; &lt;pmartin6@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: token_kenkyu_kai@...\n&gt;To: token_kenkyu_kai@...\n&gt;CC: mastersword53777@yahoogroups.com, nihonto@yahoogroups.com,   \n&gt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Gendai Measurements ;-)\n&gt;Date: Sat, 30 Oct 2004 10:32:53 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;My American Fellows\n&gt;\n&gt;I was wondering what system do you all use to measure your blades, seeing \n&gt;as no-one really wants to use shaku and Japans secondary unit is CMs. I \n&gt;believe that you are doggedly keeping the feet and inches part of \n&gt;imperialism (as well as gallons), is this still the case when it comes to \n&gt;Japanese swords, or do you make the exception in this case and use the \n&gt;metric system?\n&gt;\n&gt;Paul\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
