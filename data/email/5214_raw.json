In fact I shy away from that. This old ninja\nis doing quite well with invites to some of the more\nfamous ryu in japan than the average wannabe could\npossibly imagine possible. \n\nI am wondering what makes a serious martial artist\nfrom your comment. Belive me when I tell you I am more\nserious about what I have studied and what i do study\nmore than the average martial artist in any dojo. I am\nnot one of those who turn up train and go away till\nnext lesson.\n\npaul\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Silk Road School &lt;silk.road.school@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\n   Date: Thu, 12 Aug 2004 16:06:43 -0700 (PDT)\n   From: Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: shuriken vs. shaken\n\nHi\n\nthe book was writen by Charles Gruzanski. He is dead\nnow but his son Robert has all of his material amd set\nup this site http://www.robertg.com/\n\nthe book was based on masaki ryu and had a lot  in it\nabout Nawa Fumio who is still alive (in his 90&#39;s) and\nonly recently retired from teaching. He will be the\nlast soke of his ryu as he has split it into 4 shihan\nlines. At leas 2 photos in the book feature Hatsumi\nmasaaki who left the ryu and later gained fame as a\nninja dude - Bujinkan Dojo.\n\nThank you for the reminder - and the link.  I&#39;ll have\nto check it out and\nsee what I think of it thirty years later.  It&#39;s\nunclear from this, though,\nwhether you regard Gruzanski&#39;s information as\nlegitimate or not; nor on what\nbasis you make your judgement.\n\nDont worry about being a wanna be ninja - it got the\nbets of us hooked at one time or another\n\nI&#39;ll assume you don&#39;t intend that to be insulting. \nBut I&#39;m no wanna-be\nanything, Paul, and your comment is not calculated to\ngo over well with any\nserious martial artist.  I earn my meager bread as a\nteacher of\ninternational sword arts (as well as naginata, spear,\nassorted peasant\nweapons from Europe and Asia, Chinese weapons,\narchery, empty-hand, and\nknife and stick styles - I even teach crutch\nself-defense from time to\ntime), and I&#39;m pretty serious about my accuracy.  I\nalso come from a family\nof academics, so bad research is a very sensitive\nsubject for me.  I&#39;ve been\nteaching one style or another for about thirty years,\npretty informally\nuntil the last ten years or so; and I&#39;ve been\npractising longer than I can\nremember offhand.  I got hooked, as you put it, on\nJapanese combat arts at\nan art house that screened Inagaki&#39;s &quot;Chushingura&quot;\nevery year back in the\nlate &#39;60s and early &#39;70s.  Musashi&#39;s _Book of Five\nRings_ had a hell of a\nlot more influence on me than the ninja craze that hit\na few years later.\n(And of course, my mother had Hiroshige and Hokusai\nprints around the house\nfrom the time I was born.)\nA few years ago, someone asked another teacher in the\narea, &quot;What does it\ntake to open a Ninjitsu school?&quot;  The teacher thought\nabout it a second and\nsaid, &quot;A black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a business\nlicense.&quot;  Which pretty\nwell sums up my attitude to 90-plus % of what is\ncalled Ninjitsu today.\nI&#39;ve talked with Steve Hayes, and one of my old\nstudents ran Frank Dux&#39;s\nsecond school back in the &#39;80s, before he got\ndisillusioned with Dux&#39;s cult\nof personality.  Neither of them impressed me much\nwith the quality of his\nbackground.  (Dux&#39;s fighting skill was remarkable, but\nit was mostly\nmilitary; and &quot;Bloodsport&quot; represented neither his\nstyle nor his\nwish-fulfillment history with any accuracy.)  As far\nas the craze for\nNinjitsu goes, in fact, I have seen precisely one\n&quot;Ninja&quot; film - some Sho\nKosugi silliness that turned up on late-night TV a few\nyears back - and my\ncomment to Nate was precisely in hopes that I would\n_not_ be lumped in with\nthis sordid batch of bad research and willful\nmyth-information by the\nserious minds on this list.\nSo if being a ninja wanna-be got &quot;the best of us&quot;\nhooked, then I guess I&#39;m\nnot one of the best of you.  And if that really were\nthe best of you, I\nwouldn&#39;t be on this list.\n\nthe spikes and the stars are all known as shuriken.\n\nThat is certainly true:  at least outside of Japan: \nbut then a great many\nthings are &quot;known&quot; inaccurately.  (Witness the person\nwho found a web-site\nclaiming the 47 Ronin killed the Shogun!)  So permit\nme to ask if you have\npositive knowledge that the term &#39;shaken&#39; is\nincorrectly applied to the\nstars, etc., and likewise that &#39;shuriken&#39; is correctly\napplied to them.  As\nI say, I&#39;m pretty serious about my accuracy, and I\nalways desire to learn\nmore and to refine my knowledge.\n\n\nthe spikes are better know as Bo-shuriken\n\nAgain, I&#39;m interested in learning the sources for this\ninformation.  No\noffense, but what I have is your word on one hand, and\nGruzanski&#39;s\nMasaki-Ryu information on the other (and I do thank\nyou for providing me\nwith that footnote).  If what you say about Masaki-Ryu\nas the source for\n_Spike and Chain_ is correct, then why should that not\nbe regarded as\naccurate?  Have you reason to believe that Masaki-Ryu\nis not a legitimate\nstyle, and that its terminology is therefore to be\ndismissed?  And if so, on\nwhat grounds do you make that claim?  Another style&#39;s\nterminology that you\nprefer, perhaps, or a genuinely superior knowledge of\nstandard Japanese\nmartial terminology?  I&#39;m prepared to adopt new terms\nand thank you for it -\nbut I&#39;ll need some documentation beyond what you&#39;ve\nsaid here.  You&#39;ve said\nwhat your &quot;correct&quot; terms are without saying why the\nterms I cited are\n&quot;incorrect&quot;.\n\n\nHavent we discussed Shuriken etc in the recent past -\nmaybe worth looking at the archive onthe yahoo site.\n\nYes, we have.  I believe I mentioned the same thing\nabout shaken vs.\nshuriken then, but nobody responded to it that time. \nLook forward to your\nresponse now.\n\n\nPaul\n\n      Gereg Jones Muller, Master-at-Arms\nThe Silk Road School of Sword and Self-Defense\nHome:  831-335-1395    Mobile:  831-234-5216\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store:\nhttp://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\n\nYahoo!
