Berry&#39;=\r\ns book does discuss somewhat the Korean invasions, but the author does not =\r\ngo into intricate detail of the Korean invasions. She does not focus on blo=\r\nw by blow of the battles in Korea. She focuses far more on the battles with=\r\nin Japan to consolidate Hideyoshi&#39;s power over Japan itself, and his formin=\r\ng alliances within Japan. She also focuses more on when Hideyoshi was willi=\r\nng to show clemency even with defeated foes, like Chosokabe Motochika in Sh=\r\nikoku and Sassa Narimasa in Hokuriku. (Of course, the clemency toward Sassa=\r\n didn=E2=80=99t last long, as he was forced to commit suicide some time lat=\r\ner.) She also of course describes the more brutal, ruthless side of Hideyos=\r\nhi, where he defeats and destroys Shibata Katsuie, and others. She also spe=\r\nnds time discussing the social transformation of the disarming of the peasa=\r\nnts and monks, as well as the stripping the samurai of their land. She desc=\r\nribes how all of these moves were designed to stabilize the country by maki=\r\nng rebellion by peasants and monks less likely. Also, by stripping samurai =\r\nof land, the samurai themselves became more dependent on their lords and da=\r\nimyo, also making samurai less likely to make trouble independent of their =\r\ndaimyo. So the daimyo gave up some independence to Hideyoshi as the supreme=\r\n central power, but the daimyo also acquired a certain new power vis-=C3=A0=\r\n-vis those peasants and samurai below them on the social hierarchy.\n\nDo you=\r\n have a particular interest in Korea, or in those particular Japanese invas=\r\nions of Korea?\n\nRegards,\nMike\n\nwww.nihonshi.org/\n\n \n\n\nOn 8/11/2006, &quot;BURKER=\r\n1@...&quot; &lt;BURKER1@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt;     How much coverage does=\r\n the book give to the Imjin War (the Japanese\n&gt;invasion of Korea)?\n&gt;\n&gt;Bob B=\r\nurke\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In a message dated 8/10/06 4:07:35 PM, tokyodog@... writes:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The Japan history reading group, Nihonshi, has jus=\r\nt completed reading the\n&gt;&gt; Tale of Genji. Now this month, we are reading Ma=\r\nry Elizabeth Berry&#39;s bio of \n&gt;&gt; Hideyoshi. I&#39;ve finished reading Berry&#39;s bo=\r\nok, and it is excellent. I&#39;ve\n&gt;&gt; posted a summary of Hideyoshi&#39;s life at th=\r\ne group website. If any of you\n&gt;&gt; notice any inaccuracies or have any sugge=\r\nsted amendments to my description \n&gt;&gt; of Hideyoshi&#39;s life on the Nihonshi w=\r\nebsite, please email me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The group&#39;s website is here.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://ww=\r\nw.nihonshihttp://www.http &lt;http://www.nihonshihttp:/www.http&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also,=\r\n anyone who wishes can certainly subscribe to the Nihonshi group and\n&gt;&gt; joi=\r\nn us in our reading of Japan&#39;s history. We take our history seriously,\n&gt;&gt; b=\r\nut we do it in a casual and sometimes irreverent way. Politically incorrect=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; and outlandish comparisons and debate about Japan are most welcome.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Cheers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mike\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; tokyodog@...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of t=\r\nhis message have been removed]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n\n\n"
