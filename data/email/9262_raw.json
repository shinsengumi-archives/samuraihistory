I was \n&gt; going to interview someone with samurai ancestory, but I lost =\r\nthe phone \n&gt; number and now I can&#39;t interview her. So, I remembered you guy=\r\ns and \n&gt; thought you could help. I need to ask you a series of questions:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 1. What made you interested in samurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Do you have any samurai=\r\n ancestors?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.Do you have any artifacts? If so, describe them.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4.=\r\nWhat were the early samurai like?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. What are the different types/rank=\r\ns of a samurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. How does the life of a samurai differ from the life=\r\n of a non-samurai?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Respond ASAP!!!! It&#39;s due=\r\n tomarow!!!!!\n&gt;\nIt is my understanding that the samurai lived a very strict=\r\n and\nritualistic lifestyle. They were under the service of and dedicated\nfu=\r\nlly to a daimyo or lord. most Were paid in rice, which was farmed by\nthe un=\r\nderclass which were not allowed to wear the swords. Any samurai\nwho wished =\r\nto test out his new shinken or (real sword),for a price\ncould cut down a cr=\r\niminal who had been caught as Japan had no prisons.\nDeath was the customary=\r\n punishment for every offense. Sometimes\nsamurai would cut down innocent pe=\r\nople to test their steel if no one\nwas looking but this was most likely not=\r\n the norm. Samurai means to\nserve and a samurai was also called bushi being=\r\n the plural or bujin\nfor one of them. Most of Japan&#39;s population consisted =\r\nof lower class\nfarmers however until later on in the history when Japan beg=\r\nan to\nadopt more western ways. Guns were introduced by the first europeans\n=\r\nbut not given or sold to them one man made a sketch of one of the guns\nand =\r\nwithin 6 months there were guns aplenty. The samurai adopted their\nuse for =\r\na short time until they were considered dishonorable and the\nsamurai abando=\r\nned there use willingly. The use of a jo or staff was\nthe weapon used by al=\r\nmost all japanese poeple and the main weapon of\nthe lower class to defend a=\r\ngainst the samurai. Then there were the\nNinja. This was an illegal occupati=\r\non but Hattori Hanzo who was ninja\nis mentioned in the history as bushi. Th=\r\ney were the spies and assasins\nof old japan and were hired out by a diamyo =\r\nto obtain information or\ndeal with an enemy lord. They employed many dishon=\r\norable tactics and\ndevices including throwing venomous snakes on their foes=\r\n. Samurai\nwould stand and state their name and such before fighting in duel=\r\ns\nwhich usually lasted 30 seconds or less.Ninja did not and snuk around\nand=\r\n disguised themselves and such. Ninja were more effective in combat\nthan mo=\r\nst samurai though and usually acted alone. Slaying a sleeping\narmy and othe=\r\nr similar antics. Honor meant everything to the samurai\nand they would not =\r\nhesitate to commit hara kiri done with the\nwakizashi one would stick the bl=\r\nade into his gut with the goal of\ncutting the spine from the front then ano=\r\nther would end his suffering\nwith a beheading. Someone the former had chose=\r\nn to assist him in\nrestoring his honor. A samurai could probably take down =\r\na charging\nbull but I would not expect the could have tussled succesfully w=\r\nith a\ngrizzly bear. \n\n\n"
