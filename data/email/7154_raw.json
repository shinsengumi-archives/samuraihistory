He is uncredited and the detailed \nlist of cast & crew (including stunt personnel) I have gives no mention \nof him. The only other place I&#39;ve ever seen it mentioned was in an \ninterview with Hayes (of course) in Kick magazine back in the 80&#39;s \nwhere among other things he claims to have been living in Japan for \nyears, given the Shogun production crew ninja history and choreography \nfor the ninja attack sequence, and just totally impressed the whole \ncrew with his grasp of Japanese history and martial arts. The part he \nwas supposed to have played was a stuntman part-the crewman that falls \noff the mast of the Erasmus into the ocean.\nPerhaps some clever Japanese solution to get rid of the \ngaijin &#39;expert&#39;...\n\n\n\n"
