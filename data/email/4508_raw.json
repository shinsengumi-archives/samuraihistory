Nowadays, Japanese are about \nthe same height as your average American, but 150 or more years ago you&#39;re \nlooking at more like 4&#39;11. Unfortunately the armour Tom wore was the worst \nin the movie. The Dou was poorly shaped and fitted. The lacing was terrible.\n  What you PROBABLY want is a fair modern reproduction. If I remember \ncorrectly a nuinobe dou with everything will run about $5000 from Kozando if \nyou are 5&#39;6 to 5&#39;11. Over 6&#39; you&#39;re probably looking at custom. More \nspecifics will allow me to get you some more info.\n\nMJPeters\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for the info. What I&#39;m looking for is a set of Armour from the Edo \n&gt;Period or just before, that I can use during a living history display. It \n&gt;looks good, functions well and will not fall apart, will last for a long \n&gt;time to be passed on. What has cough my eye is the set that Tom Cruise wore \n&gt;during the movie The Last Samurai. Either Black or in Ox blood color. This \n&gt;Armour will be used on horse and in training. It needs to be good quality.\n&gt;\n&gt;Takara\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"
