The Satsuma army were samurai, and Saigo Takamori is often called the last samurai. Both of these battles have a heroic, noble failure, last stand, feel about them.\n\nBy the way, Takasugi Shinsaku was quite a high ranking Choushuu samurai and seems to have been very conscious of his own rank. It doesn&#39;t seem accurate to see him as a democratic figure. Like most of the Choushuu Meiji heroes, many of whom rose from being commanders of the shotai (samurai-farmer militia) he was a brilliant opportunist. Ito and Inoue were quite low-rank: Inoue&#39;s upbringing as described in Choushuu no Tenka was that of a farming-samurai family. Many samurai did not want to join the militia as the new methods of rifle drill and so on were considered too boring. Farmers on the other hand found this less boring than the hardship of their lives and possibly also saw it as a way to enter the samurai class. \n\nI&#39;d be interested to know if any of the Meiji leaders were interested in western-style democratic ideas.\n\n"
