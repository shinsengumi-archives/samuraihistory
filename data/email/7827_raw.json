Let&#39;s say the \nsame \n&gt; thing \n&gt; &gt; too.\n&gt; &gt; Myself, I see myself as a modern dinosaur. Well I can promise \n&gt; anybody \n&gt; &gt; here I perfectly follow the same duty code, I am pretty good at \n&gt; doing \n&gt; &gt; nothing, just eating stuff and waiting for my own extinction or \n&gt; &gt; reincarnation in a theme park on some desert island.\n&gt; &gt; So I am a modern dinosaur. So cool :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What about you ? What you guys will be?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds good to me - everyone is entitled to thier own fantasies \n&gt; after all.  I&#39;ll modify the start page of this yahoo group \n&gt; accordingly.\n&gt;\n\nFrom this point on, if anyone wants to debate whether or not you can \nbe a &quot;modern Samurai&quot; JOIN THIS GROUP:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/japantoday/\nThat is what it is there for.
