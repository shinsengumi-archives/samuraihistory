These days a sword &quot;for practice&quot; and \nmost are machine made replicas like those from Noshu-iaido and other \nvendors, often mogi-to, are called Iaito and are what most people think \nof. Many distinguish Iaito as being unsharpened while swords for \nBatto-do are for cutting and are sharp. People who can afford it get \nIaito made to order by modern swordsmiths and so carry shinsaku-to \nIaito. My iaito is late Edo period shinken and is quite sharp, IMHO...\n-t\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\nYahoo!
