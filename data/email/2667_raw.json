In the modern terms, they all got black\nbelts(really qualified not just those who got due to\nseniority nowdays) and Ph.D.&#39;s before the age of at\nleast 20 year old.\nIn the west, Napoleon also mastered mathematics,\ntactics, stragegy, and literatures before the age of\n17, which resembles some of traditions of the North\nEast countries before the industrial revolution.\n\n&gt; i was wondering if any of it was real?\n\nYes, it is real, even now for some people. That is why\nsome Southerners in America have hard time accepting\nsome foreign students(Not White) superior to them.\n\n&gt; Why were they trying to  become so Modern???\n\nThis question must be thrown to the government. After\nthe success of the British industrial revolution in\n1820, everything had changed. A few highly qualified\nindividuals can no longer face with many above average\nmultitudes. They had to set up the public school\nsystem, which degraded the physical and intellectual\nstandards but still give opportunity to more people.\n\nOne last point to Cepo:\n&gt; yet another East Asia  country that managed to stay\nindipenedent, actually in the long run even longer\nthan Japan (that was occupied in 1942-1952). It&#39;s\nThailand (Siam).\n\nThe indepence of Siam was indeed remarkable. But, in\nmany ways, the North East Asians are strictly\ndifferent from the South East Asians culturally. This\ndifference has been diluted becuase of many Chinese\nimmigrants to the South during 17-18 centuries. But,\nthe tradition survives. \nNote that the only countries in Asia which made\nsuccess in modern economy are North East Asian\ncountries like Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, and\na few other southern countries but whose economy is\ndominated by Chinese descendents.\nThat is why people from Taiwan would get offended very\nmuch if they are confused with Thais in the actuall\nlife circumstance or in TV shows.\n\n\n\n\n                            Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Changsub Lee\n\n\n\n\n\n question is if such remara\n--- Cesare Polenghi &lt;cepo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Dec 5, 2003, at 1:20 PM, Marshall lilly wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey gang,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   I had some questions that i thought you guys\n&gt; might be able to answer.\n&gt; &gt; First i jsut saw the last samurai and i was\n&gt; wondering if any of it was \n&gt; &gt; real?\n&gt; &gt; and  Why was the meiji Gov. trying to change? the\n&gt; way of the samurai \n&gt; &gt; and all\n&gt; &gt; was working just fine!Why were they trying to\n&gt; become so Modern???\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thanks all!!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Captain\n&gt; &gt; Marshall Lilly\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Capt.,\n&gt; Japan was the only country in East Asia who managed\n&gt; to save its butt \n&gt; thru modernization. I believe the kick came from\n&gt; seeing what the \n&gt; British were doing in China. As far as romantic fans\n&gt; of the samurai \n&gt; would always be disappointed when looking at the\n&gt; pragmatic Meiji \n&gt; restoration, the alternative would have been a\n&gt; massacre at the hands of \n&gt; the Western powers. There was in fact NO WAY the\n&gt; Japanese could have \n&gt; resisted the weapons the Europeans had developed,\n&gt; and the only city \n&gt; that was actually attacked by the British\n&gt; (Kagoshima) was badly damaged \n&gt; in a few hours of cannoning. Fear of invasions and\n&gt; blockades was \n&gt; exactly was pushed the Tokugawa government to deal\n&gt; with the foreigners \n&gt; first (treaties), and to modernize as quick as\n&gt; possible.\n&gt; One last note: there is yet another East Asia\n&gt; country that managed to \n&gt; stay indipenedent, actually in the long run even\n&gt; longer than Japan \n&gt; (that was occupied in 1942-1952). It&#39;s Thailand\n&gt; (Siam). In fact, in the \n&gt; 19th c., after British and French had occupied Burma\n&gt; and Indochina, \n&gt; rather than entering Siam, they preferred to use it\n&gt; as a buffer zone. \n&gt; For this reason (=it was not an European colony) the\n&gt; Japanese did not \n&gt; invade in the 1940s, but rather settled for an\n&gt; agreement. Thus, \n&gt; Thailand independence is remarkable, but mainly due\n&gt; to rather casual \n&gt; factors--Meiji Japan, instead, had pull itself out\n&gt; of the middle-age.\n&gt; \n&gt; cepo, honolulu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
