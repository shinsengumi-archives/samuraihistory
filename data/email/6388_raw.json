With all due \nrespect, this is a topic that should not get started. it will be a \nsee-saw battle and no one will win. somebody has something different \nto say on who is right and who is wrong. I have seen stories on \nevery Ninjutsu instructor out there from Frank Dux to Shoto \nTanamura, to Hatsumi Sensei himself. so wheather you are Dux-Ryu, \nGenbukan, Bujinkan, Toshindo, Koga ryu, or even *sigh* Ashida Kim \nlets keep the political bickering out of this one and just focus on \nthe true ninja history, please?\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; HI\n&gt; \n&gt; the Dux movie where he claims to have ocme form a\n&gt; ninja family fought the ultimate contest has since\n&gt; been proven fake. He even had a well publicised court\n&gt; case between himself and Van Damm which he lost. Even\n&gt; Dux military past has been proven fake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hayes, well reading his books, and oing my own\n&gt; research it has to say somehting if Hayes and my self\n&gt; are in the same org as each other and I wont train\n&gt; with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; paul\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; --- Silk Road School &lt;silk.road.school@i...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, if you want to start quoting Stephen\n&gt; Hayes\n&gt; (Explanation: I&#39;m currently putting myself through the\n&gt; agony of reading his book--and I use that term only\n&gt; because it has pages and is bound--about the mystical\n&gt; origins of Ninjutsu--insert appropriate oohs and ahs\n&gt; here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Years ago, when I was working in a bookstore in L.A.,\n&gt; I knew some fellows\n&gt; studying with Frank Dux as well as some studying with\n&gt; Stephen Hayes.  As I\n&gt; was certain that Dux was a fraud (a very fast,\n&gt; legitimately deadly fraud,\n&gt; with some frighteningly effective moves, but still\n&gt; nothing like the adopted\n&gt; son of an Old Ninja Family that he pretended to be), I\n&gt; called up Hayes at\n&gt; his studio and asked him something about research.  I\n&gt; was thinking about\n&gt; getting the store to stock some of his books.  I have\n&gt; rarely made anyone so\n&gt; nervous in a first conversation.  It set off my\n&gt; internal alarms, and I never\n&gt; did order the books.\n&gt;       Gereg\n&gt; P.S.  Ooh.  Ah.
