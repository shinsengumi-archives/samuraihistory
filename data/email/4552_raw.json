While I am a big Japanese \nhistory fan I have mostly studied the naval history from the \nformation of the Japanese navy up till WWII.\n\nI am the founder of the Russo-Japanese War Research Society and have \nauthored several naval wargames dealing with Japanese history. I \nknow, what am I doing here? Well I try not to limit myself and have \nrecently developed a great interest in the samurai period of Japan.\n\nA quick question, are there any samurai miniatures players here. If \nso what set of rules would you suggest? I am willing to help out with \nany naval matters that I can address and I am looking forward to \ninteracting with the group if you do not mind my stupid questions.\n\nOff to start researching!\n\nCheers\nBill M.\nhttp://www.russojapanesewar.com\n\n\n\n"
