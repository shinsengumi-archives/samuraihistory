Since discovering Rurouni \n&gt; Kenshin we have been amazed at the attention to historical fact \n&gt; involved with this series. We have just started becoming \ninterested \n&gt; in the Samurai histories but can find no info on this group of \n&gt; misunderstood Samurai. Any help will be appreciated and \nreciprocated. \n&gt; Kei and I are somewhat of an expert on anime in general and Lovely \n&gt; Angels/Dirty Pair in particular as well as romanji script in \nJapanese \n&gt; and its English translations. We also collect lyrics in both \n&gt; languages and download music and video for animes too. Domo \narigato \n&gt; for your assistances. Keiman and Kei.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
