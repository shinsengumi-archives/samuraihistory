And yes Japanese web sources wou=\r\nld be alright. Finding this specific date is tougher than I thought it was =\r\ngoing to be. I had encountered the timeline dating from the seventeenth cen=\r\ntury to the nineteenth concerning the fires in a book years ago and remembe=\r\nred that the yoshiwara had burned several times but never got the specific =\r\nmonths in that timeline. I didn&#39;t care then but now my nonchalance has come=\r\n back to haunt me when I require the information. Serves me right.\n  Again =\r\nthanks Nate and sorry for my comment on the hakamas. I had read about that =\r\nfact in a book I had found in a library once. I can remember facts just not=\r\n details like titles of books, I should improve that fault of mine. Thanks =\r\nfor you help.\n  Rod\n   \n  Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n  \nRo=\r\nd--\n\nIt&#39;s no big deal. As a moderator, it&#39;s sometimes\nfrustrating when peop=\r\nle come on here and ask\nopen-ended, general questions without doing any\nres=\r\nearch, like &quot;Can someone tell me everything about\nthe Samurai???????&quot; \n\nObv=\r\niously yours is not a case like this--have no fear,\nthere will be no smitin=\r\ng. It&#39;s much more\nunderstandable that you can&#39;t find many sources if\nyou&#39;re=\r\n looking for a specific fire (1861). When people\nask general questions (Tel=\r\nl me about fires in Edo!)\nand say they can&#39;t find anything, I tend to do a =\r\nquick\ngoogle search to see what comes up. In this case, I\nfound quite a bit=\r\n about fires in Edo, most referencing\nthe 1657 fire. Your mention of a time=\r\nline, as opposed\nto a specific time, indicated to me you didn&#39;t know\nwhat y=\r\near you were looking for. Since I found several\npages of hits in less than =\r\n2 minutes, it made me doubt\nhow hard you actually looked. Looking for speci=\r\nfic\ninformation about the fire in 1861, I can see how the\npages that came u=\r\np (most of the Wiki variety) didn&#39;t\nhelp at all, and you&#39;d turn here for mo=\r\nre specifics. \n\nMost of the regulars (and you&#39;ve been here a while, so\nyou =\r\nprobably are familiar with the problem) will tell\nyou that we often get peo=\r\nple here who have spent a\ntotal of 30 seconds online, haven&#39;t found the ans=\r\nwer\nto whatever question they have, and ask here when if\nthey&#39;d invested 5 =\r\nminutes with a decent search engine,\nthey could find it. Again, I&#39;m glad we=\r\n are not dealing\nwith that--I&#39;ll poke around some more and see what I\ncan f=\r\nind for you, though. Will Japanese\nsources/webpages work for you? \n\nNate\n\n-=\r\n-- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Nate:\n&gt;   I feel bad that my=\r\n question annoyed you or anyone\n&gt; else. I guess I assumed if I mentioned ti=\r\nmeline it\n&gt; would be enough to mean the entire history of the\n&gt; Yoshiwara f=\r\nires in Tokyo since there was more than\n&gt; one in the entire history of the =\r\nYoshiwara since its\n&gt; creation in the seventeenth century. But again let\n&gt; =\r\nme apologize and assure that in the future I will be\n&gt; more specific and no=\r\nt allow myself to assume\n&gt; anything when it pertains to an inquiry.

It helps unbelievably to be\n&gt; specific in what=\r\n your question is. I was mildly\n&gt; annoyed that you said you&#39;d looked and co=\r\nuldn&#39;t find\n&gt; anything, when a simple Google search came up with a\n&gt; ton of=\r\n sites (admittedly, mostly scanty info like\n&gt; Wikipedia, but still). Howeve=\r\nr, if you&#39;re looking\n&gt; for\n&gt; a specific fire at a specific date, that chang=\r\nes\n&gt; things quite a bit. \n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck, not sure I&#39;ve got anything that c=\r\nan help\n&gt; you with your specific question. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkb=\r\noyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Nate:\n&gt; &gt;   First of all let me thank you f=\r\nor your answer\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; I think I should have been more specific about my\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; question regarding the fires of the Yoshiwara. Yes\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; am aware of =\r\nthe great fire of 1657 I have found\n&gt; &gt; information on that part of the his=\r\ntory but there\n&gt; &gt; were also fires during the late nineteenth century\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nne of them I believe occured in the year 1861.\n&gt; You\n&gt; &gt; see it has much ha=\r\nrder finding that sort of\n&gt; &gt; information but if you Nate or anyone else ha=\r\ns or\n&gt; &gt; knows of where I can find that information I would\n&gt; &gt; be most gra=\r\nteful.\n&gt; &gt;   Rod\n&gt; &gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; --- Rod Pavez &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello everyone:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not long ago I posted a question about the fires\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Yos=\r\nhiwara or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pleasure quarter of the city of Tokyo.
