I also believe they made a shorter tv movie of Shogun, that \nprobaly isnt that good since they would have to cut out 8-7 hours of \nthe storyline.  \n\nKagemusha is infact about Takeda Shingen and how after he died, due \nto a bullet wound, his head generals got a double to pretend to be \nhim. They managed to hide his death for a year, I believe. The movie \nhas Nobunaga and Ieyasu in it, but its not about Nobunaga. By the \nway, this did actually happen.\n\nIve seen a few Kurosawa films, and they seem very accurate. I \nrecommend any Kurosawa film.\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Saitoh Hajime&quot; \n&lt;the_sam_99@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Is Shogun also a movie? I thought it was only a book...\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you guys think of the Kurosawa samurai movies, are they \n&gt; historically accurate? I hear that Kagemusha is about using a \ndouble \n&gt; of Oda Nobunaga to hide his death. Was this fiction or are there \nat \n&gt; least some rumors to it?\n&gt; \n&gt; The Wolf of Mibu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Nate Ledbetter \n&gt; &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Agreed....I think it will be painful. Horribly Wrong.\n&gt; &gt; And that&#39;s on top of how I feel about Tom Cruise in\n&gt; &gt; general. It will be the pain of Shogun (the\n&gt; &gt; translations, the Edo-jidai uniform kimono, the\n&gt; &gt; silliness of the whole love story) on a much grander\n&gt; &gt; scale. It will hurt. It will kill me. And I will go.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nate\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- &quot;Anthony J.

But what do you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guys think of it? Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you think it has the potential to be up there with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shogun and The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seven Samurai? Or is it just a big Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crapfest to make money\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and draw in crowds with big battle scenes?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I look at going to it much as I do going to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dentist.
