As the seppuku ceremony evolved and\n&gt;  changed, there were cases where instead of a sword, a fan was placed\n&gt;  in front of the person committing seppuku. In other words there was\n&gt;  not a bit of the ideal described above. The man was trotted out and\n&gt;  his head sliced off without any opportunity to show his bravery.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nJay et al-\n\tas you say there were any number of ways for this to be done, many of \nthe different styles were developed to take into account rank and \npriviledge, the circumstances of the &quot;crime&quot; and  any number of other \nfactors. In the case mentioned above I think it is wrong to say there \nwas no opportunity to display ones courage. My understanding of the use \nof the fan was that it was often used for ladies or persons of high \nrank who weren&#39;t expected to perform the same rough ceremony of the \nrank and file soldier. Whether man or woman by reaching for the fan one \nsignalled for all to see their sincere intent to cut themselves, there \nwas no further need for a demonstration and the coup de grace was \ndelivered.\n-t\n\n\n"
