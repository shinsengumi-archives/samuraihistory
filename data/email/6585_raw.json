After that \nsave your money up and invest the real deal after you have come to \nunderstand just what makes a true and collectible nihonto. I pormise \nyour money will be better spent, the swords and the culture will mean \nso much more to you and you&#39;ll find the journey a real pleasure.\n\tWas it Lizzie with an interest in the construction of the sword? The \nCraft of the Japanese Sword by Yoshindo and Kapp is THE book for would \nbe hammer-monkeys lots of great photos, technical details and still \nsurprisingly readable for those of us not into all the tech talk. Again \nI steer anyone interested in Nihonto to check out the following site;\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm\n\nGood articles, the one on eBay fakes is a must read, and in addition to \nan on line primer as it were, enough linkage to other sites to satisfy \nany curiosity, good hunting,\nTom\nmember NCJSC\nwww.NCJSC.org\n\n\n"
