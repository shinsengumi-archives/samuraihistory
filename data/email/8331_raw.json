However, if you are looking for historical information on  the Shinsengumi... You should read Shinesengumi: The Shongun&#39;s Last Samurai Corps by Romulus Hillsborough. I couldnt put it down. Hillsborough has written at least three fantastic samurai-related books. \n  \n  Jonathan\n\nTotok Sudarijanto &lt;totok.sudarijanto@...&gt; wrote:          I&#39;ve just bought taiga drama - Shinsengumi VCDs, however the VCDs haven&#39;t\n  arrived yet.
