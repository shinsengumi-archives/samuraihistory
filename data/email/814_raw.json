Pre Tokugawa? Tokugawa? After America sought trade?\nBetween Edo and Kyoto, I am unsure which city would be more\ninteresting. Edo is a distance from Kyoto. Did more action\ntake place in and/or around Kyoto? I can look within an\nencyclopedias but I would rather focus on one time period\nat a time; I get overwhelmed. You folks can supply me with\nmore detail in certain areas than an encyclopedia can. I\nwould appreciate your time and knowledge. Thank you.\n\nMelvin\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Health - your guide to health and wellness\nhttp://health.yahoo.com\n\n\n"
