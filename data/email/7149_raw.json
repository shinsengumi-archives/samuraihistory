And supposing I was \n&gt;    dumb \n&gt;    enough to want to teach his stuff at a dojo I would have to buy the\n&gt;    dvd on which class I want to teach, watch it, then send mor emoney \n&gt;    to \n&gt;    have a curriculum sent to me. \n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.skhquest.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;    Sorry to ressurect the whole Hayes thing, but god is there no \n&gt;    decency.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Maikeru\n\nFirstly, thanks for posting Hayes&#39; URL, it was interesting to visit the\n&quot;horse&#39;s mouth(?)&quot;:-)\n\nI think the answer to your last question is sadly no. However, Kitsuno\nhad previously put up the following link as an antidote for such woes,\nso if you missed it, please go and enjoy:\n\nhttp://www.realultimatepower.net/index4.htm\n\nNow, seriously, as a re-enactor of Japanese history I am forever having\nto explain, that in my opinion virtually the whole &quot;ninja&quot; thing is pure\nbaloney, although I do put it more politely than that normally. Does\nanyone know of a web site that deals with this topic in a genuinely\nscholarly fashion? So far, all I can find are the usual crop of ninja\nwanabe dojo&#39;s, or those frothing at the mouth with their pre-pubescent\nfantasies, as for the rest: - silence.\n\nCepo wrote that he had read mountains of books for his Phd, and not one\nmention of the ninja, which to me is dam fine evidence. But what I need\nto be able to point folks at is a reputable and scholarly discussion of\nthe subject, preferably short, putting the ninja in (or out of) their\nhistorical context, citing the evidence one way or another. The trouble\nis when I tried to write a short piece for my website, I realised, that\nI&#39;m massively unqualified to do it any kind of credible justice. So,\nhelp!\n\nI suspect that there is nothing out there as this whole subject has a\npariah quality about it, meaning that to date any scholar worth their\nsalt, treats it like a hot potato and leaves the topic well alone! Oh\nwell...\n\nYours\n\nDean\nDefinitely not a secret mystical ninja master from England, unless you\nknow otherwise:-)\n***\n\nDean Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n---\nJoin the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n--- \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
