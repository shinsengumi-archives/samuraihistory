King\nThe best book I&#39;ve read for discribing the phyche of the samurai.  It also goes into the making of\nkatanas which was very interesting.\n\n2) Secrets of the Samurai by Oscar Ratti & Adele Westbrook\nTo be honest, I was hesitent to recommend this book since it was a $2 special at half-price books\nbut I was surprised at how much information was in this book.  It is written like a thesis paper\nfor the most part and very dry but contains a lot of history about the various training and\nMartial arts of the Samurai.\n\n--- Francisco Manuel Luna Zapata &lt;swarzdraken@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; HI SCOTT:\n&gt; I HAVE ONE TITLE OF BOOK ABOUT SAMURAY HISTORY:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.
