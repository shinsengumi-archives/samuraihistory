But for the most\n&gt; part, a samurai was born, not \n&gt; &gt;made.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Okay, this is something that is now confusing me.  I\n&gt; thought that this \n&gt; was only true when Toyotomi Hideyoshi turned Japan\n&gt; society into a caste \n&gt; system (so that no one else could do what he did.\n&gt; ;-) ) and that before \n&gt; that there was a lot more fluidity in the social\n&gt; classes.  \n\nCorrect, Dan--up until Hideyoshi&#39;s edicts, most\nsamurai of the lower and middle levels were also\ninvolved in agriculture. The common term is\n&quot;Jizamurai&quot;, �n��, indicating the samurai had a\nconnection with the land. These warrior-farmers could\ninclude peasant farmers who only served as ashigaru\nwhen called up, and returned to the rice paddies when\nnot at war, but mostly refer to samurai who owned\nfields and may have been small plantation owners. \n\nThe strict division Nina mentions is largely an\nEdo-period construct--prior to the edicts, there was\nmuch more ambiguity, and the right combination of\nopportunity and skill could lead a lower-class peasant\nor merchant to not only become a samurai, but to\nbecome a daimyo, a la Saito Dosan (a former oil\nmerchant) or Toyotomi Hideyoshi***. If these famous\ncases exist, it&#39;s certainly likely that many more\npeople were able to transition from peasant to\nlower-level warrior, ashigaru, etc. \n\nThat being said, we shouldn&#39;t assume that prior to the\nEdo period you could, as Nina says, &quot;enroll in Samurai\n101&quot; and become a samurai. It was definitely easier in\nperiods of national turmoil, such as the Sengoku\nperiod, when anyone of skill would be utilized, and\ncould make a name for themselves (and then invent a\nlineage later). You don&#39;t hear of too many situations\nlike Dosan and Hideyoshi in the Heian or Kamakura\nperiods, for example. This was due to many factors,\nmost of which changed during the Sengoku. Previously,\nashigaru weren&#39;t considered &quot;samurai&quot;--they were cheap\nfootsoldiers recruited from the peasantry to put\nspears in the field, but weren&#39;t a professional or\neven semi-professional fighting force. As the scale of\nwarfare grew, new weapons (guns, the longer spears\ncarried by ashigaru, etc.) and new tactics were\ndeveloped, and consequently you couldn&#39;t just round up\na bunch of farmers, give them spears, and send them\noff to fight. While early guns didn&#39;t require as much\ntraining as the sword or bow, they still required\ntraining--and once trained, a daimyo isn&#39;t just going\nto release his new ashigaru to their own devices.\nSamurai combat became more and more an ashigaru\nfight--led by upper level samurai, but the footsoldier\nwas vitally important to the success of Oda Nobunaga,\netc. As this importance was realized, ashigaru were\ngranted more status, gradually separated from their\nfarming duties (though warfare frequently stopped so\nfields could be tended up into the 1570&#39;s), and\nsigning up as an ashigaru became a way to &quot;get\nnoticed&quot;--Hideyoshi&#39;s path to glory, along with many\nwho he brought up with him, started this way. As I\nsaid before, in the period of civil war a good soldier\nwas a good soldier, regardless of his parentage, and\nwould be promoted and given leadership roles and\nprestige if warranted. \n\nAt the end of the Sengoku, this need to utilize\ntalented people regardless of background ends.\nHideyoshi&#39;s edicts made the separation between the\nclasses, and recognized the ashigaru as the lowest\nlevel of samurai. Those jizamurai who both fought and\nfarmed were forced to choose between the two\nprofessions, and more chose farming than you would\nthink. \n\nAlso, even those who &quot;rose from the masses&quot; took great\npains to either hide or compensate for their humble\nbackgrounds. Hideyoshi had himself &quot;adopted&quot; by a\nFujiwara nobleman, to legitimize his position. \n\n***It should be noted that the notion of Hideyoshi\nbeginning life as a vagabond peasant is mostly\nromantic fiction. Research indicates his father was an\nashigaru under Oda Nobuhide, so while he may have\nfloated between classes early in his life (different\nstories have him selling needles as an itinerant\nmerchant, farming, training as a priest, traveling\naround for work as a stableboy, etc.), he had a\nconnection to the warrior class from the beginning. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
