If youhavent seen it\n&gt; then you havent a clue whats in it.\n&gt; \n\nThat is the danger of using such a questionable source - you \nautomaticaly throw your entire project into question.  If the New \nYork Times wrote a scientific article about how vitamin X from ABC \ncompany cures breast cancer, but one of the contributors was the \nhead of the ABC PR department who was previously censured for lying \nabout the efficacy of ABC company&#39;s previous vitamins, that would \nautomaticaly call into question the veracity of the entire article.  \nFortunately the veracity of your sources MATTER, and in using Hayes, \nthey display a profound lack of discernment in the eyes of people \ninterested in the actual history.  By default one is forced to \nwonder if this is either A) a thrown together fantasy fest to \nglorify the ninja, sell DVDs of the show, and get Hayes even more \nrecognition and students for his schools, or B) they just didn&#39;t \nknkow any better, which doesn&#39;t speak well for them.\n\n\n\n"
