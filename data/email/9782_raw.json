I found that in a Japanese history book, but the actual source\n&gt; was not listed.  Since Shinano was Shingen&#39;s only option for movement\n&gt; because he was allied with the Imagawa and couldn&#39;t move soldiers\n&gt; through Suruga, was he even trying to get to Echigo at all (he could\n&gt; have been making moves to the West), or did his foray into Echigo\n&gt; simply bring Kenshin down on him even though he hadn&#39;t intended to\n&gt; even bother with Echigo?\n\nIs it possibly related to the &#39;salt&#39; episode? Perhaps simply an\nextrapolation of an identified need by later historians that goes\n&quot;Takeda needed + Takeda was intelligent = Takeda must have wanted...&quot;,\nregardless of the truth of the matter.\n\n-Josh\n\n"
