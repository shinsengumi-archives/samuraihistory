He loved Japan, since he lived\nat Brazil since his adulthood, but speaking japanese, but dealed things of\nthe past as it was already buried.\n\nAnd searching on the web, it was the only place I saw &quot;okimoto&quot; mentioned in\nHistory at the Samurai site..\n\nThis was the only clue I have, and I take it  a little serious enough to\nask, because Okimoto family (not a clan) had its origin at the same region\nof the Motonari&#39;s one. So, I am researching a possible conection.\n\nVery around Fukuoka region. If is a mistake or not, I don&#39;t know yet.\n\nIt is about oyakoko. Even to know a little more about my origins, is to know\nmore about my soul, soul of my family, and the conection with one of my\nroots that is Japan.\n\nBTW, does anybody know any online reference to Byankottai History?\n\nthanks in Advance\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\n\n   Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2003 03:05:40 -0000\n   From: &quot;iganokami&quot; &lt;intp@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Okimoto and Byankottai\n\nOkimoto clan and the Mori?
