How did a typical village \nlook, what kind of industries were prevelant, what did an average \nhome look like? (particularly keen to \nfind out information about what life in the mountainous areas of \nJapan was like).\n\nI&#39;ve collected thousands of pages of information on the history of \nJapan so far but I&#39;m looking for information from people who have a \ntrue passion for this particular era. I&#39;m hoping you can perhaps \nintroduce me to some interesting characters and stories which I might \nnot have picked up before.\n\nThanks,\n\nNez.\n\n\n"
