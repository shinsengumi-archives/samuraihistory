If they were more\nthan pleased to leave me (a Brit) all alone for\nseveral hours with no one watching over my back while\nI did drawing, measurements and photos then I am sure\nthey will be more than happy to let a fellow\ncountryman in.\n\nThey also have a nice collection of Yari and Naginata,\nas well as a scroll which contains many drawing in\nfull colour, of tthe different parts of a suit of\narmour.\n\nIf any one is in the milwaukee area they may wish to\ncheck this stuff out. My friend deals with the museum\nwith regards to Native Indian items and recently\nseveral talks etc have been cancelled due to lack of\nfunds. He says this is now going to have a knock on\neffect to other departments and other displays. It\nwould be a shame if the museum suffered as I\npersonally felt it was one fo the best I have seen on\nmy travels in the USA.\n\npaul\n\n--- mark kd &lt;depos42300@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n---------------------------------\nHello, \n  here&#39;s my ?\n     - are there any museums in the United States that\ndisplay authentic samurai armour?\n           (i&#39;ve been told the best way to get to know\nhow to make samurai armour is to see the real thing up\nclose)(problem is,...i don&#39;t know where to look)\n     - the museum would also have to be friendly\nenough for me to look up close, maybe handle, and take\nclose up pic&#39;s of the armour for a better reference.\n      (i&#39;ve tried to make dif. parts of samurai armour\nbut they never seem to come out right,....basically\nthe things that you can&#39;t really make out how it was\ndone by just by looking at a picture in a book)( it&#39;s\nthese simple little things that would be solved if i\njust got a look at the real thing) (i live in Buffalo,\nNY & there are no museums around me that have\nauthentic samurai armour on display) Hope to get some\ngreat idea&#39;s.\n                                                      \n               Thank you very very much,\n                                                      \n                    MARK\n                                                      \n                    depos42300@... \n    \n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
