Obata Nobusada was the so=\r\nn of Obata Shigesada. \nObata Kagenori was the son of Obata Masamori.\n\nOBATA=\r\n Toramori 1505?-1561\nToramori first served Takeda Nobutora, from whom he wa=\r\ns granted the \nuse of &#39;tora&#39; in his name. He fought in many battles for Tak=\r\neda \nShingen under the leadership of Baba Nobufusa and was said to have \nbe=\r\nen wounded no fewer then forty times over the course of career, \nwhich came=\r\n to an end when he died of illness in June 1561 at Kaizu \nCastle.\n\nOBATA Ma=\r\nsamori 1534-1582 \nMasamori was the son of Obata Toranori and a noted genera=\r\nl of Takeda \nShingen. For some time he acted as Kosaka Masanobu&#39;s second in=\r\n \ncommand at Kaizu Castle in northern Shinano Province. He was wounded \nat =\r\nthe Battle of Nagashino and eventually died of illness. He was \nmarried to =\r\na daughter of Hara Toratane.\n\nOBATA Nobusada 1540-1592 \nNobusada joined the=\r\n Takeda around 1560 after fleeing his lands in \nK=F4zuke Province. He had h=\r\nis old fief restored to him by Shingen the \nfollowing year and proved to be=\r\n one of Shingen&#39;s most dependable \ngenerals. He led large forces at the Bat=\r\ntles of Mimasetoge and \nMikatagahara and was very useful in the Takeda&#39;s K=\r\n=F4zuke campaigns. He \ncommanded somewhere around 500 men at the Battle of =\r\nNagashino for \nTakeda Katsuyori. When the Takeda fell in 1582, he joined fi=\r\nrst \nTakigawa Kazumasa and then the H=F4j=F4, finally ending up with Sanada=\r\n \nMasayuki (1590).\n\nOBATA Kagenori 1570-1644\nKagenori became a Tokugawa ret=\r\nainer following the fall of the Takeda \nand was made a page to Tokugawa Hid=\r\netada. He is reputed to have been \nsent to the Osaka garrison as a spy by t=\r\nhe Tokugawa. Kagenori is \nattributed with writing at least part (if not mos=\r\nt) of the Koyo \nGunkan, the well-known history of the Takeda of Kai in the =\r\n16th \nCentury (which is sometimes also attributed to Kosaka Masanobu).\n\n\n\n-=\r\n-- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jeff_l_harris&quot; \n&lt;edenquest@j...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; Konnichi wa,\n&gt;    I&#39;m trying to put together a project that includes =\r\na discussion \nof\n&gt; Obata(s) Kagenori, Toramori, Masamori, Nobusada, & Nobus=\r\nhige, but \nI&#39;m \n&gt; having a difficult time finding information and untanglin=\r\ng some \n&gt; features of how (or if) they are related. In sum, I have the \n&gt; f=\r\nollowing questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1). Are they all from the same (general) lineage? =\r\nAny details \n&gt; available?\n&gt; 2). More specifically, how are Toramori, Masamo=\r\nri, and Kagenori \n&gt; related? I have found conflicting info. on this.\n&gt; 3). =\r\nDoes anyone happen to know anything about them and their \n&gt; activities beyo=\r\nnd dates of birth/death and other surface info.? Or, \n&gt; are there any decen=\r\nt sources in English (beyond Samurai Archives--\n&gt; I&#39;ve farmed as much as I =\r\ncan from there!) where I might find \n&gt; something a bit more in-depth?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThanks much in advance for any assistance and/or clues! \n&gt; \n&gt; Marlene Harri=\r\ns\n\n\n"
