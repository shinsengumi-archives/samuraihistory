And also there\n&gt; was a class of people, I \n&gt; believe they were called &quot;Ji-samurai&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;farmer-samurai&quot; who worked the fields \n&gt; but also could fight in battles. Not sure, please\n&gt; anyone feel free to correct \n&gt; me.\n\nSee my post--you&#39;re close. \n\n&gt; But definitely after Hideyoshi&#39;s &quot;sword-hunt,&quot; a\n&gt; samurai was definitely born, \n&gt; not made.\n\nAgreed, 150%. While there *were* the *EXTREMELY RARE*\nexception, 99.9999999999999999999999999999% of the\ntime, post-1600 one had to be born into the samurai\nclass to be a samurai. That was the only requirement,\nas well--behavioral codes, martial arts, etc. had\nnothing to do with it. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
