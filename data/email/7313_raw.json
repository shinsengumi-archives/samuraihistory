Under John Ray Sensei in \nDenton, Tx.  Iaijutsu and Iaido obviously have the same roots, but are \ndifferent just like Judo and Jujutsu are different.  It is an awesome art to \nstudy, especially if given in the tradional atmosphere.  Just my two cents \nworth..\nRob\n\n&gt;From: &quot;merridewe&quot; &lt;merridewe@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [samuraihistory] Re: Just joined\n&gt;Date: Mon, 18 Jul 2005 23:52:01 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey that&#39;s great, you&#39;re studying iaijutsu (is that the same as\n&gt;iaido?). Anyhow, it&#39;s drawing the sword, making your movement and then\n&gt;replacing the sword in the scabbard, yes? Shintaro Katsu and\n&gt;Tomisaburo Wakayama were experts in this style. Have you seen any of\n&gt;their movies? Read my book if you want to learn more.\n&gt;\n&gt;Patrick Galloway\n&gt;http://cyberpat.com/samurai/\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, federico trejos\n&gt;&lt;federicotrejos@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Hi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I also train in Iaijutsu, Eishin Ryu style.   Under\n&gt; &gt; Patricia Gallo sensei in Costa Rica.\n&gt; &gt;  I will be taken my first exam in september or\n&gt; &gt; october, I hope.\n&gt; &gt;  What�s your style ???\n&gt; &gt;  Any doubt or comment you have, please let me know.\n&gt; &gt;  I will be glad to help you and learn from you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Around 22 days ago, we have a visit from a guy who\n&gt; &gt; study Araki ryu Iaijutsu.   And although his style is\n&gt; &gt; very different, it was quite nice to see him showing\n&gt; &gt; us his kata.   It is must ceremonious than our style.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Bye know, but let�s be in touch...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Correo Yahoo!\n&gt; &gt; Espacio para todos tus mensajes, antivirus y antispam �gratis!\n&gt; &gt; Reg�strate ya - http://correo.espanol.yahoo.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
