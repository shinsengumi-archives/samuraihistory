I know how much my life and sword interests broadened when I \n&gt; found\n&gt; the first sword lists back in 1995.  This Samurai History list came much\n&gt; later.  But to your question re the Yakuza and their history.  I have only\n&gt; one book and it seems to cover them from Go to Whoa (well, still going!).\n&gt; They began to attract the attention of officials around 1612...  Well, go\n&gt; find a copy of the (paperback, 414 pages):\n&gt;\n&gt; YAKUZA\n&gt; The explosive account of Japan&#39;s criminal underworld\n&gt; Alex Dubro and David E Kaplan\n&gt; Futura (1986)\n&gt; ISBN 0 7088 3573 2\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
