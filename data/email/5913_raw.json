I am a member of a mainly German based organisation, but with international members, also with the name Shogun. We combine a group of &quot;like minded people&quot; who have interest in the Samurai - whether it be research, modelling, flatfigure collecting, wargaming or re-enactment.....  \n\nWe broke away from the German KLIO zinnfigur organisation to create a seperate &quot;Arbeitsgruppe&quot; in 1985, so next year will be our 20th anniversary. I have been trying to get a web site up and running for three years but decided to save the registration/hosting fee until its finished!! We actually produce a range of 30mm zinnfigur (tin figures) and meet up every year in Goslar for a &quot;private&quot; weekend and every two years at Kulmbach in Bavaria at the Zinnfigur Borse.\n\nPerhaps we should compare notes and have a chat...... because what is even more remarkable is that I do also dwell in Stevenage, UK !!  Have I even met you in the past??\n\nRegards,\n                    Rod Johnson :-)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
