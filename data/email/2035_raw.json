All sorts of nasty consequences flow from this\nincluding import bans.  A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is available by mail\nor via the Justice Department&#39;s website.  I urge all Australian collectors to\nrequest a hard copy by mail and/or download the documents and read them\nthoroughly.  Submissions close on Monday September 8th.\n\nThis is particularly important for ALL Australian collectors.  I believe that\nany law passed in any State jurisdiction can then be immediately written into\nlaw WITHOUT PUBLIC CONSULTATION by any other State.  As the proposed banning of\nswords arises out of an all-Australian Police Commissioners meeting you may be\nsure that if this gets up in Victoria we will see swords declared prohibited\nweapons without notice all over Australia.\n\nAny lover of swords anywhere in the world is also quite free to download the RIS\nand make a submission to the Victorian Government.  I would be eternally\ngrateful to anyone who did so and the cause of Nihont� as Art swords will surely\nbe advanced.  Important swords have been found in Australia and will continue to\nbe found - unless they wind up being broken and melted down.\n\nCalling Colonel Cadwell, where are you.\n\nI will try to set something up on a website - Richard Turner??\n\nGo here to find the Regulatory Impact Statement.\n\nhttp://www.justice.vic.gov.au/CA2569020010922A/Homepage?OpenForm\n\nClick on the top link labelled\n\n&quot;Draft Control of Weapons and Firearms (Search Powers) Regulations 2003&quot;\n\nand you will pull up three documents as follows:\n\nRegulatoryImpactStatement.pdf (173kb)\nProposedControlofWeapons(Amendment)Regulations2003.pdf (14kb)\nProposedFirearms(SearchPowers)Regulations2003.pdf (12kb)\n\nBest regards,\nBarry Thomas\n(Melbourne, Australia)\n\n\n\n"
