Mitsunari was born about 1560 or so.  He would have been 18 when Kenshin died... You are probably thinking about Kenshin&#39;s adopted son Kagekatsu, who was named one of the 5 regents.\n\n\n&gt; If Kenshin was one of the men in charge of Hideyori when Hideyoshi \n&gt; died then Mitsunari would not have been a teen. Since Hideyoshi only \n&gt; died a few years before Sekigahara\n&gt; \n&gt;      Ryan\n\n\n"
