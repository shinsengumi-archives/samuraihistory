Indeed,  I would submit \nthat, although a middle point in the Age of the Country at War,  the \nintroduction at Tanegashima in 1543 of Portuguese firearms ought to be considered the \nbeginning of Modern War in Japan,  as the large use of cannon in Italy in 1494 \nby the French is often considered the beginning of the epoch of modern war in \nEurope.  I know Chinese firearms were there from approximately 1511 [pace \nTurnbull],  but they were not nearly as sophisticated as the Portuguese,  and the \nlarge contracts vetted for Oda Nobunaga after their introduction seems to bear \nout my point.  I hope Tony Bryant has some thoughts he can share here?  \nRegards,  Profmurf\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
