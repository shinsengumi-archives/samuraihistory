Frazier&quot; &lt;punish10@...&gt;\r\n\r\nThis much I know ...\n    There were two schools that taught martial arts that I know of, the\ninformation passed down through verbal transmission in the Takeda line. Aizu\nhad a school that taught Oshikiuchi, a weaponless martial art, and the other\nwas, I THINK, Onaha Itto-ryu. These schools were very prized, and they\ntaught to all the high ranking members of the Aizu and Takeda clans; the\ndignitaries and political members specifically.\n    In direct regard to &quot;martial arts training&quot;, Judo is an offspring of\nDaito-ryu. Although it is powerful in and of itself, it&#39;s initial creation\nwas through a student of Daito-ryu, and all the original &quot;advertisement&quot; so\nto speak, was a display of Daito-ryu by Shiro Tanomo, son of Saigo Tanomo.\n    Certain members of the higher ranking samurai, like Shingen Takeda, not\nonly learned their heritage art passed down through the family, but they\nstarted at eight years old. The Daito-ryu art in particular, which is the\none Shingen would have studied through his youth and young adulthood, has\nbeen in existence as far back as 1200 AD, formalized by Minamoto Yoshimitsu.\nThe original form included some weapon study, but it was still a form of\njujutsu, and jujutsu happens to be one of the most potent and deadly arts in\nthe history of the world. Just watch The Ultimate Fighting Championships if\nyou doubt that. :oP\n    As far as high ranking members of the Samurai tradition hiring martial\nartists to teach them ... Tokugawa did just that. In the 1640s(?), following\nhis amnesty, Tokugawa sought out the remnants of the Takeda clan to train\nhis personal body guards.\n    The majority of this information is complements of Kondo Sensei. These\nare his oral trasmissions as best as I know them, passed down from the\ndirect Takeda line.\n\nAlex\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;fredjnsn@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, July 22, 2001 3:52 PM\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Re: The origins of the Ninja straight sword.\n\n\n&gt; Indirectly on topic, but a question/comment nonetheless. . . In all\n&gt; my years of reading and studying Japanese Samurai history, I have\n&gt; NEVER come accross anything even remotely resembling &#39;a group of\n&gt; samurai practicing karate together in a dojo&#39; (quote is my own).  I\n&gt; have never seen any references to unarmed combat training, and don&#39;t\n&gt; see much use for it anyway.  The samurai studied weapons, which is\n&gt; common sense, of course.  I don&#39;t believe (and this is opinion) that\n&gt; even &#39;powerful samurai families&#39; employed &#39;martial artists&#39; to teach\n&gt; them unarmed combat.  from my limited (6 years of martial arts\n&gt; training about 10 years ago or so - and my studying of martial arts\n&gt; history) is that unarmed combat originated in Okinawa, and at best\n&gt; 200 - 300 years ago.  I&#39;m sure that judo or jujitsu-like &#39;wrestling&#39;\n&gt; probably existed, but I doubt that Takeda Shingen or Oda Nobunaga\n&gt; hired martial arts experts to train there armies in the way of\n&gt; unarmed combat.  I would hazzard to guess based on what I&#39;ve read\n&gt; (and thus on what I &#39;haven&#39;t&#39; come accross) that mass training for\n&gt; the armies wasn&#39;t too common - even weapons training.  most ashigaru\n&gt; probably went out and cut themselves a bamboo spear and just charged\n&gt; into battle hoping for the best.  I would assume that any martial\n&gt; training with weapons was done on one&#39;s own, and not through\n&gt; a &#39;teacher&#39; exept for perhaps the &#39;richest&#39; or closest to the lord,\n&gt; who would receive sword training.  Anyway, my point is that I&#39;ve\n&gt; never seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts training in\n&gt; the &#39;scholarly&#39; Japanese history books.  At best the subject comes up\n&gt; in the VERY questionable &#39;martial arts history books&#39;.  If someone\n&gt; has info on martial arts training from a &#39;reputable source&#39; PLEASE\n&gt; respond to this post.  I am curious about this simply because it is\n&gt; not something covered by Hall, Varley, Sansom, Berry, or the others.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.hn.org/samurai-archives/index.html\n&gt; ---\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
