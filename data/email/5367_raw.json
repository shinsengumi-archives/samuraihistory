(I&#39;m also iterested\n&gt; &gt; in battle paintings or\n&gt; &gt; prints from this time frame)\n&gt;\n&gt;Someone may have already mentioned it, but Varley&#39;s\n&gt;&quot;The Onin War&quot; is THE source in English. I reread it a\n&gt;few months back.\n&gt;\n&gt;For armor, etc., try Stephen Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai\n&gt;Warriors&quot;. For all of Turnbull&#39;s faults, that&#39;s a real\n&gt;good one as far as showing the particular armor of\n&gt;each time period, and how it adapted and evolved.\n&gt;Great color prints.\n&gt;\n&gt;Also for weapons/armor I&#39;d try Bottomley and Hopson&#39;s\n&gt;&quot;Arms and Armour of the Samurai&quot;, as that does a good\n&gt;job of showing time periods also.\n&gt;\n&gt;For tactics, there isn&#39;t a whole lot out there for\n&gt;this time period--mainly because there wasn&#39;t a whole\n&gt;lot documented about the actual tactics of the time\n&gt;period. Of course, most of the fighting at the\n&gt;beginning of the Onin War as house to house street\n&gt;fighting in the capital, which doesn&#39;t take much\n&gt;tactical genius--circle a house, light it on fire, and\n&gt;kill the enemy as he comes out seems to be a common\n&gt;version.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
