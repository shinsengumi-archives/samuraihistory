The exhibition is on until 27th February 2005.\n&quot;The exhibition features about 100 blades and mountings which were polished and otherwise conserved in Japan during 1998, with guidance from the government of Japan and the Society for the Preservation of Japanese Art Swords (the NBTHK) in Tokyo.&quot;\nTo find out more about the exhibition, visit www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/japaneseswords\nThe cattalogue still proves to be elusive. I have heard it will be available about 2nd week in October. I sincerley recommend a visit if you are in London over the next few months.\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n"
