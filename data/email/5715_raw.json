Did Hidemitsu fight at the battle\n&gt; of Yamazaki or Honnoji temple?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again\n&gt; \n&gt; Jonn\n\nNo problem--I guess I should clarify, when I said &quot;I&#39;m\nfascinated by him&quot;, I meant Mitsuhide, not Samanosuke.\nSamanosuke is really nothing more than a footnote in\nhistory, video games aside, while Mitsuhide single\nhandedly changed the course of Japanese (and hence\nworld) history. Imagine a Japan united under Nobunaga,\nno sakoku, Jesuits free to preach...\n\nAnyways, I&#39;ve heard conflicting things. My\nrecollection is that Samanosuke was holding\nSakamoto-jo during the battle of Yamazaki, after\nparticipating in the sack of Azuchi. The bio states he\nwas at Sakamoto when Mitsuhide was trying to escape\nafter Yamazaki, and I trust FW Seal&#39;s research. \n\nI just did a google search in both English and\nJapanese, and 96% of what I find is related to the\nOnimusha game. 2% of the remainder is related to other\ngames, like Taiko-ki. What in the hell possessed them\nto use some nobody like this guy? Other than he&#39;s got\na famous painting of him, you barely even get a\nmention of him even in relation to sources on his\ncousin/brother/uncle Mitsuhide (even on the\nrelationship there is confusion!). Mitsuharu is much\nmore prominent. The only other story I&#39;ve heard about\nhim is that he hid under some dead bodies when he was\ndefeated, in order to stay alive to attack the\nopposing general, but this may have been someone else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n"
