In this case, the change of BUKE had been attributed mainly to the change of economy .    \n\n\n  In the interim of Edo Bakufu days, the economy had been changed gradually to Money oriented economy , Commodity oriented economy from longcontinued Feudal economy .   And so , Buke were forced to be poorer and poorer as a result of the fact that BUKE got only registered income from BAKUFU , but\n Merchants had began to be richer and richer.\n  In order to get more income , BUKE got impose heavier tax on Farmers, facing to the poverty of BUKE.   so sever, resulting in Farmers riots against such heavier tax imposed by BUKE.\n  On the top of that , BUKE borrowed more loan from Merchants and BUKE soon  became in a position not be able to return loan to them.   And at the end of Edo Bakufu days, Bakufu lost power to get back the social order to be ruined to be transformed to new Meiji Government.\n   \n  Facing to the change, Meiji Government issued public bonds and gave to BUKE to sell and become capitalist newly , or BUKE newly were assigned to be Governors under the new constitutes.\n   \n  As I pointed out earlier,  the main reason why BUKE were forced to be changed to other ranks was the change of economy. \n   \n    By the way,  what part of England are living ?  I visited  London several times on business  quite a long time ago.\n   \n  Eddie\n\nTom Dowling &lt;vaevictis@...&gt; wrote:\n          \nEddie,\n\nInfo assimulated! As to your supposition on the role of the emperor, perhaps the views pre-Tokogawa and a glimps into Roman history may provide illumination for you. Consider the opinion of the first Westerners in Japan: Zavier and his associates, traders etc. What was their perception of the\n emperor? They called him the &quot;pope of Japan&quot;. The title suggested a man of respect, of holyiness and position, but someone who lacked real power, more influence perhaps. And a quick consideration of the later Roman Emperors: they too often were figure heads, and lacked quantifiable power. Looking\n in these area may help refine your questions and answers. Drop me an email if you want to bounce ideas off me. P.s, I&#39;m an Englishman, not an American.\n\nTom Dowling\n\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.comFrom: eddiehiramoto@...: Tue, 25 Nov 2008 11:19:21 +0900Subject: RE: [samuraihistory] Why did Buke ( Samurai ) vanish in Japanese History at end of Edo era ?\n\nHi Tom, and All,Your saying, evolve , or assimulated into something else, is right word , I agree.( Even I used to live in US for 15years and have been involving the business with US over 30 years , using English, I can&#39;t use right English. Sorry about that.However, thanks to you and other\n American friends in this community, I&#39;m glad to learn and find more unknown word of English and increase the vocaburary.)In fact, lastly, Buke, Samurai were forced to become Governer, Policeman, Farmer, Businessmen, Teacher, etc , due to the fact that New Meiji government formed and issued new\n constitution , resulted in non existence of occupation of Buke. Before Meiji revolution , Buke was the top rank of class next to Emperor, then Farmers, Merchants, etc. However, after Meiji revolution, Buke class evolved to others like above mentioned.Now, my next question is then , does Emperor\n exist from now on ?After Buke took over the power of reign firstly about 1,200 years ago, Emperor continued to alive , exist without doing things but just doing the things related to religion in somewhere in Kyoto. And, after WW II, Emperor keep doing just smiling , eating with visiters from\n overseassometimes without the right to vote, because he was appointed as the symbol In fact, Japanese needed something like symbol , mercy , for the time being after collapse by WW II , however, Japan recovered completely and now , most of Japanese don&#39;t need mercy, symbol any more. So, one day,\n there will be no reason to exist . Maybe, one day, they are forecedto become just civilian and take some job to alive.How do you think ?EddieTom Dowling &lt;vaevictis@...&gt; wrote:Things tend not to vanish, rather evolve, or they are assimulated into something else. Roman Legions did not\n vanish: the quality of the army was diluted until the Western Empire fell to the barbarian tribes; the Vikings enjoyed much power until the black death arrived in Norway in 13th century,only for the few to survive to be conquered by Danes and Swedes. The class of &quot;Knights&quot; continued, but ceased\n to be a major force on the battlefield (perhaps think of the samurai after the Tokogawa shogunite). Longbows are weaponary, and would have become obsolete when there was something better,cheaper and easier to train mass infantry, i.e powder and lead to use Marx&#39;s terms. Same with cavalry. when\n armoured vehicles could be produced more reliably, quicker and cheaply, horses, cavalry ceased to be an important force on the battlefield. Just look at the first great war, most nationsuse cavalry (think of Lawerence of Arabia), but the second great war, scarcly a horse is photographed in the\n entire campaign. Soldiers and ruins? I think poor leadership leads to ruins - not soldiers per se.Regards T.

After that, Buke had been\n growing and increasing powergradualy. Buke did have stronger power than Emperor since Heisi ( Kiyomori Taira ) and followed by Genji ( Yoritomo ) , then Asikaga, warriors days to Nobunaga, Hideyosi, and Yeyasu Tokugawa ( Shogun ) for over 260 years, ruining Japan . Even under Buke, Emperor has\n been still aliving.However, atthe end of Tokugawa , Edo era, Buke had been vanished completely and disappeared . Then, under new government , MEIJI, Emperor returned and started to ruin Japan again .Why did Buke vanish in Japanese history after 1,000 years since birth\n ?__________________________________________________________Ota nyt k\u001b$B&gt;-!W\u001b(Bytt\u001b$B&gt;-%b&gt;-%b\u001b(Bsi uuden sukupolven Windows Live palvelut!http://get.live.com[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] __________________________________________________________See the most popular videos on the web\n http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/115454061/direct/01/[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]---------------------------------Power up the Internet with Yahoo!
