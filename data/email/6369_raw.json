Don&#39;t know what to do with\nthat straight sword of yours? Join Black Market\nBabies.com!\n\n\n&quot;Ryu Hayabusa \n\nBackground: Ryu&#39;s past is shrouded in secrecy. It is\nknown that he attended the last surviving school of\nninjitsu near Mt. Fuji in Japan but was expelled for\n&quot;inappropriate behavior.&quot; It is assumed that this\ndishonor may have caused him to lose connection with\nhumanity, but this is mostly an inference drawn from\nthe 20-30 ninja corpses he left littered throughout\nJapan. He joined BlackMarketBabies.com in order to pay\noff his credit card debt. \nFavorite Requisition Tactic: Ninja swiftness. \nGoal in Life: Death. &quot;\n\nhttp://www.black-market-babies.com/employees.html\n\n(If you can&#39;t tell this is a satirical website, you\nprobably need to be sterilized. But then, you&#39;d just\nbe trying to get babies through the website, wouldn&#39;t\nyou? So I&#39;ll spell it out: IT&#39;S A JOKE!)\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nAll your favorites on one personal page ï¿½ Try My Yahoo!\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"
