Or two.\n\nAnd how many spaces do we have? Do we get a free spin?\n\nWhat I am enjoying is all the suggestions of Miyamoto\nMusashi and so forth--the original message (below)\nsays 200 years ago. That would put it around 1800 or\nso. Being as Musashi was around in the early 1600&#39;s,\nthese suggestions are only about 200 years off. As are\nthe ones for any Mori (or Mouri, for that matter), or\nMatsunaga Hisahide, etc. \n\nNate\n\n&gt; &gt;   bty302953 &lt;ralfy@t...&gt; wrote:Hi I need help\n&gt; search for a samurai, \n&gt; the only info I have is that he \n&gt; &gt;   was alive about 200 years ago and his name began\n&gt; with the letter \n&gt; M.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
