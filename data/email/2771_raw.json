Gustavus\nAdolphus also used lighter, small-calibre field guns to give his infantry\nadded firepower.\nMichael\nBAJS; Asiatic Society of Japan\n\n\n\n ----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Nate Ledbetter&quot; &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, December 09, 2003 3:59 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Samura battle tactics\n\n\n&gt; Turnbull&#39;s &quot;Samurai Sourcebook&quot; has some decent\n&gt; diagrams for the more common formations.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for any idiot who thinks Europeans were vastly\n&gt; superior to the Japanese on the battlefield, they&#39;ve\n&gt; been filled with too much of the stupid Edo period\n&gt; dueling crap that so many samurai geeks are. By 1575\n&gt; the Japanese were using firearms on the battlefield to\n&gt; greater effect than Europeans, and on a much more\n&gt; massive scale. The only reason Europeans surpassed the\n&gt; Japanese by the time the two civilizations re-engaged\n&gt; in the 1800&#39;s is that the Japanese had 200 years of\n&gt; peace, no warfare, so no reason to adapt and change\n&gt; the way they did things. ONce they saw that need, they\n&gt; did, and defeated a major European power shortly\n&gt; thereafter (1904-05, Russia).\n&gt;\n&gt; --- CRAZ &lt;crazoftheages@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not deeply versed on the subject of specific\n&gt; &gt; formations and the like, but I do know I have about\n&gt; &gt; 8\n&gt; &gt; jpg&#39;s\n&gt;\n&gt;  warfare spoken of in such a negative fashion these\n&gt; &gt; days.  It used to be left at &quot;the Japanese were more\n&gt; &gt; specialized and better at personal combat whereas\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Europeans were better at keeping order and mass\n&gt; &gt; combat&quot;, but even that is being challenged these\n&gt; &gt; days\n&gt; &gt; by people who insist in the superiorty of European\n&gt; &gt; fencing, unarmed combat and actually have the gull\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; compare the european sword to the katana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I could rant on, but I&#39;ll do that some other time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; New Yahoo!
