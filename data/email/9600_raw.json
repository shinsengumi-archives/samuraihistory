This is an auction for 3 Sengoku Daimyo related\n&gt; manga =\r\n- Oda Nobunaga, Hojo Soun, and Takeda Shingen.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Oda Nobunaga manga =\r\nis the first issue of a series and is also a\n&gt; first edition, in great cond=\r\nition.  Takeda Shingen is issue #5, and is\n&gt; 20 years old, but in good cond=\r\nition, with some signs of wear and age. \n&gt; Hojo Soun is probably the most i=\r\nmpressive (to me at least), it is a\n&gt; stand-alone issue (and first edition)=\r\n, which covers Hojo Soun&#39;s life\n&gt; from the Onin war onward.  It has great a=\r\nrtwork, and is from the series\n&gt; &quot;Sengoku Busho Retsuden&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; All three a=\r\nre imported from Japan and in Japanese.  Here is the auction\n&gt; URL for more=\r\n info and for bidding:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&i=\r\ntem=3D190125691876\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this messa=\r\nge have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
