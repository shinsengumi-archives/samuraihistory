Unfortunately only 3 of his books have been translated into\nenglish. As well as The Last Shogun, &#39;Drunk as a lord&#39; a collection of four\nstories set in the bakumatsu period was published by Kodansha last year I\nbelieve. I highly recommend that one. The third book &quot;The heart remembers\nhome&quot; I haven&#39;t read but I don&#39;t think its an historical novel.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Robert Sanfilippo &lt;robertsanfilippo@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, August 15, 2002 8:46 PM\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] Suggested Authors\n\n\n&gt; Has anyone mentionedRyotaro Shiba?
