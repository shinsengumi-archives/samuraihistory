I mean I know it&#39;s the=\r\n warring\nstates era \n&gt; twixt 1500 and 1600 something but is it before Sekig=\r\nahara in 1600,\nthe Osaka \n&gt; battle in 1604, the uniting of the clans in 161=\r\n5 (Tokogowa era) or\nis it \n&gt; earlier or later than that? The only clue seem=\r\ns to be that in the\neppy about \n&gt; the Toad Prince the kid NobuNaga (Kag thi=\r\nnks he&#39;s &#39;the&#39; NobuNaga)\nmay the \n&gt; young warlord himself. He could be unre=\r\nlated or a descendant or even an \n&gt; ancestor of old NN. Anyone know for sur=\r\ne when IY is set? I say\naround 1550 \n&gt; when the seven samurai were prevalen=\r\nt. I believe Kurogawa did in\nfact base \n&gt; his 7 Samurai fim and later the S=\r\namurai 7 anime on a real life\nincident in \n&gt; history. By the way the Risen =\r\n7 leader Bankotsu is voiced by Matt\nHill. He&#39;s \n&gt; best known as the voices =\r\nof Eddie and Big Ed on the cartoon shows\nEd, Edd \n&gt; and Eddie. The gal doin=\r\ng Jakotsu&#39;s voice is familiar and I know her\nname but \n&gt; cannot place her i=\r\nn any animes I&#39;ve seen. Any help greatly\nappreciated as \n&gt; Mom is sure that=\r\n IY is laid after Demon Eyed Kyo (Samurai Deeper Kyo). \n&gt; Toodles-K&K\n&gt; \n\nI=\r\n gather that Inuyasha takes place in the early Sengoku, more like pre\n1500,=\r\n because the time portal in the well supposedly goes back 500 years.\n\n\n"
