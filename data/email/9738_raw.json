I have so often hear=\r\nd this idea that Zen is a philosophy, not a religion. This comes in America=\r\n mostly from the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s and the explosion of what one of my teachers=\r\n called Californian Buddhism. Psuedospirtual wannabes who wanted to rebel a=\r\ngainst Jeudo-Christian thought read a book or two and started teaching thei=\r\nr misunderstandings to others. A perfect example that is thrown around a lo=\r\nt in America... &quot;the world is only an illusion&quot;. No the world is very real,=\r\n Zen does not teach that the world is in any way an illusion. What is the i=\r\nllusion is how we see the world due to our own mental attachments, which ke=\r\nep us from seeing how it really is. Zen is a religion, just because there i=\r\ns usually no mention of god/s, devil/s, heaven or hell doe not keep it from=\r\n being a religion. Zen does not teach these things do not exist, but rather=\r\n if they do or not is unimportant to the goal of Zen. With some alterations=\r\n Zen can be practiced as a philosophy instead of a religion, i mean the ide=\r\na of rebirth life time after life time is religious and would have to be re=\r\nmoved to practice it purely as a philosophy, in its original context Zen is=\r\n a religious teaching. This is not to say that the idea of philosophical Ze=\r\nn is wrong.... rather keep in mind that it is a philosophy based on a relig=\r\nion. As much as I don&#39;t like to do this... it would KIND OF (and I am stres=\r\nsing kind of)be like someone saying they followed the teachings of Jesus wi=\r\nthout believing he was the son of God. That&#39;s the best Western comparison I=\r\n can think of. So yes, if you change some things Zen can be practiced as a =\r\nphilosophy and not a religion.... but to say that it IS NOT a religion is a=\r\n misunderstanding of Zen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________=\r\n_______________________\nN=E4etk=F6 yst=E4vi=E4si tai perhett=E4si liian har=\r\nvoin?
