So\n&gt; far your the only one thats made sense. One guy told\n&gt; me that all peoples in\n&gt; japan wore them, or the variations of them. I&#39;ve\n&gt; seen many movies where they\n&gt; didn&#39;t wear hakama. For instance Seven\n&gt; Samurai....Akira Kurisawa was a\n&gt; perfectionist he wanted everything accurate so I&#39;m\n&gt; inclined to think they\n&gt; didn&#39;t all have to wear them. But I needed some\n&gt; second oppinions on the\n&gt; matter. Thanks a bunch.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;erik baker&quot; &lt;musashieb@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 20, 2001 11:24 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [samuraihistory] Concerning Samurai\n&gt; clothing\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hakama were never formalized into a must wear\n&gt; &gt; necessity.  There were different forms of hakama\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; were worn  at different times.  There was even a\n&gt; long\n&gt; &gt; version worn in the shoguns palace during the edo\n&gt; &gt; period that were very hard to move around in. \n&gt; During\n&gt; &gt; the summer some samurai would wear kimono or a\n&gt; shorter\n&gt; &gt; version of the hakama.  These were common to foot\n&gt; &gt; soldiers in the summer.  For very formal\n&gt; occassions\n&gt; &gt; during the late sengoku jidai and the tokugawa/edo\n&gt; &gt; period they would wear something called kamishimo\n&gt; &gt; which was essentially a hakama and a stiff\n&gt; shouldered\n&gt; &gt; top that covered there kimono or whatever\n&gt; particular\n&gt; &gt; shirt they were wearing.  These could be\n&gt; formalized\n&gt; &gt; for a particular daimyo and or family.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope this is helpful\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Musashi\n&gt; &gt; --- oblivion@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to know if samurai had to wear\n&gt; Hakama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or was it by rank\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or preference? Or was it so that if they didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; follow bushido then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they didn&#39;t wear them?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
