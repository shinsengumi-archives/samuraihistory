I, too, believe that I should get this \nsword and its blade into the ha=\r\nnds of an expert. I am working on a \nway to do that and think that I will w=\r\nithin a couple of weeks.\n\nScott\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ca=\r\nrlo Tacchini&quot; \n&lt;TSUBAME1@T...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; So much time passed... I suggest th=\r\nis :\n&gt; - Do not make anything to the blade or the tang in order to discover=\r\n\n&gt; better details or, worst, in order to let it sharper. Do not touch \nthe\n=\r\n&gt; blade, clean it with paper nose tissue, maintain it in the scabbard\n&gt; cut=\r\nting edge up. \n&gt; - Search for easy and near To-ken fun club, give it person=\r\nally \n(without\n&gt; leaving them alone in their hands) for a first, direct kan=\r\ntei if \nthey\n&gt; agree to make it free. If they agree the blade is a traditio=\r\nnal\n&gt; hand-made and is in recoverable conditions, ask for a qualified \ntogi=\r\nshi\n&gt; (polisher).\n&gt; -Get in touch with the togishi, asking for polish price=\r\ns, usually \nXY U$\n&gt; at inch (both sides included) of the sharp part of the =\r\nblade. At the\n&gt; finish of the work all the mystery of the blade will be unv=\r\neiled.\n&gt; Personally, I gave to polisher also a blade that is not at present=\r\n \nday\n&gt; an investment. The price paid and the polish was superior to the \nm=\r\narket\n&gt; price.\n&gt; But is a personal thought. To give back a blade to their d=\r\nignity is \nfor\n&gt; me enough for the price paid...\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Messaggio or=\r\niginale-----\n&gt; Da: Scott Moore [mailto:sgmoore@e...] \n&gt; Inviato: domenica 1=\r\n1 maggio 2003 19.29\n&gt; A: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Oggetto: Re: [sam=\r\nuraihistory] History of a Sword\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thank you for your inform=\r\nation and thoughts.

In most cases the \nofficers\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; charge =\r\nof the local military units would allow the soldiers to \npick\n&gt; through\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n the piles and take what they wanted.  That is how my grandfather \ngot\n&gt; hi=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; rifle and sword.\n&gt; &gt;   Very rarely did a soldier kill an officer on t=\r\nhe battlefield and\n&gt; take\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; sword then.  For two reasons.  One, kil=\r\nling an officer would \nrequire\n&gt; getting\n&gt; &gt; close enough to have killed al=\r\nl the other soldiers around him.  \nTwo,\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; were in the middle of a =\r\nwar, they would not have had time to bend \ndown\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; pick up a sword w=\r\nhile avoiding flying bullets.\n&gt; &gt;   I hope that this helps you determine ho=\r\nw the weapons were \nacquired.\n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt; more posts I read about it the more=\r\n I believe that you have a very\n&gt; nice\n&gt; &gt; find.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peace,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Matt Williams\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________=\r\n_____________\n&gt; &gt; STOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; http://join.msn.com/?page=3Dfeatures/junkmail\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Samurai A=\r\nrchives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from th=\r\nis group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
