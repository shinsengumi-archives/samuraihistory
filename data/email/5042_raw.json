Local museums may have some that\nyou can get a close up and may even allow for you to\ntake a pic of it on display. Also consider just what\nyou intend to do with your armour. Is it display, or\nis for living history like I&#39;m trying to do now ? Will\nit need to function like the real thing? or will it be\nstood in a class case to be admired ? Also you need to\nconsider your sizes and how all the armour comes\ntogether. Dont forget what needs to be worn under it\nall. Thats starting from the ground up. Underware to\nfinally your sword. Each piece needs hours of research\nand development. Good luck and have fun.\n\nTakara \n--- depos42300 &lt;depos42300@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello, \n&gt;   I put up a message about 3 days ago trying to get\n&gt; some help on \n&gt; making samurai armour.
