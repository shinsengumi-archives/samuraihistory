Totman talks quite a bit (so far) about\nShimazu Hisamitsu, but I&#39;m wondering when these guys\nfade out of the picture and how--you don&#39;t hear of any\ndaimyo becoming leaders in the Meiji govt. I&#39;m\nwondering why.\n\nNate&gt;&gt;\n\nOff hand I recall some of them became governors of the prefectures that\ntheir domains became (though most of those didn&#39;t last too long in that\npost). All of them got a lump sum salary from the Meiji. Most used this to\ninvest back into state enterprises (which was what was intended) and became\nvery rich and managed to live comfortably on that. Also they were given\nvarious ranks in the new peerage. I don&#39; recall any that contributed\nanything significant in the Meiji era. Most daimyo of the bakumatsu era were\nnot exactly to smart. Hence the reasons their kerai mostly ran the show.\n\n\n\n"
