Please enlighten us with your\nvast knowledge, and lead us from the dark path of Paul\nChen! \n\nThink about it people: you want a SAMURAI sword. If\nyou&#39;re looking for swords that resemble samurai\nswords, fine, go with these 3rd class reproductions.\nIf you don&#39;t have the cash to put up for the real\nthing, and don&#39;t care that it&#39;s not the real thing, go\nfor it. But I know for a fact you can get decent real\nswords for under $5000 through various dealers.\nCarlo&#39;s probably the expert--where are you????\n\nNate\n\n--- Anthony Escobar &lt;kondo_isami@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I for one am a big sword collector. My opinion\n&gt; however on Paul Chen is that yes he makes alright\n&gt; practical katana, but there are swords out there a\n&gt; hell of alot better. I\n&gt; recently bought a new iaito as i do study iaido, but\n&gt; that was about an $800 sword.\n&gt; It really depends on what you want to do with it.\n&gt; You also have to consider your budget\n&gt; as they can get extremely pricey. So if you&#39;re\n&gt; looking for something to cut with, you&#39;ll \n&gt; want to get a live blade. If you are intersted in\n&gt; Iaido or just a decorative item, you might \n&gt; get an iaito. Regardless of what purpose you&#39;re\n&gt; getting it for, you will be spending alot.\n&gt; As for practical blades, yes Paul Chen has some good\n&gt; ones, but Pual Chen isn&#39;t very\n&gt; authentic. I myself have had 2 Paul Chen blades for\n&gt; Tameshigiri (rice straw cutting) and \n&gt; I wasn&#39;t very impressed or satisfied. Not to mention\n&gt; that one of them came with scratches \n&gt; already imbeded in the blade. So try to stear clear\n&gt; of those; to expensive for crap. But if you&#39;re\n&gt; looking for a good practical katana, or even an\n&gt; iaito, go to www.swordstore.com,\n&gt; www.bugei.com, www.samurai-store.com, and\n&gt; www.tozando.com. Bottom line, you&#39;re not \n&gt; going to get even a decent sword for under $250.\n&gt; Well good luck! \n&gt; \n&gt; Robert Birker &lt;snipersergeant2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; www.888knivesrus.com The best I&#39;ve seen.  Paul Chen\n&gt; swords are sold there and Paul Chen is very good for\n&gt; quality and authenticy.  Just my opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robert\n&gt; \n&gt; zevlord &lt;LordZev@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; As you all know there are quite a few sites selling\n&gt; sword on the net. \n&gt; I am looking at purchasing a set of swords from a\n&gt; reputable supplier. \n&gt; So would like to ask you guys who have purchased\n&gt; your own sword/s \n&gt; where you got them from and if you would recommend\n&gt; that supplier. If \n&gt; you could tell me what type of sword/s you\n&gt; purchased, the cost (using \n&gt; US currency) and the website if they have one, that\n&gt; would help me \n&gt; alot.
