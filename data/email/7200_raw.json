This was\n&gt; the only article I&#39;ve seen, and I had to hunt that\n&gt; one down. I was mistaken\n&gt; that it was CNN. when it was MSNBC, for that I\n&gt; apologize. \n\nYou had to hunt it down, because it&#39;s not REAL. It&#39;s\nhosted off the UCLA website, which leads me to believe\nit&#39;s the creation of one or more UCLA students, as a\njoke. NOTHING comes up on the MSNBC site if you look\nfor anything related to this. \n\nNot only is the website a parody, but all this\nbusiness about being in court and defecating is ALSO a\nparody/joke. My only question is this: is it the same\nperson/people as those who created the site, or is it\nsomeone making their own spinoff to the saga?\n\n*sigh*\n\nAnd people get upset when I lament the failure of\ntoday&#39;s youth to grasp irony... \n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDiscover Yahoo! \nHave fun online with music videos, cool games, IM and more.
