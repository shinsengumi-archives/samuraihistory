That is not the act of someone who\nwants answers. The impression is that this person read\nsomething somewhere, potentially fictional, and\nbelieves it to be real. Fine--no problem. To me, it\ndoesn&#39;t sound real. It certainly doesn&#39;t sound like\nanything I&#39;m familiar with, at least with no further\ninformation to draw from. However, I&#39;m fully willing\nto grant it may be a story based on some real events,\nand would be happy to help find what those events\nwere, if I could. I cannot, especially when told &quot;I\nknow more about this, but won&#39;t tell you.&quot; Please.\n\nIt is not the responsibility of anyone on this board\nto soothe egoes or confirm erroneous beliefs. You have\nthe right to incorrectly believe geisha existed in\n1600--you do not have the right to call people who\ntell you that you are incorrect and present facts\ndirty names. \n\nMy reply may have been sardonic, but was not\noffensive. I didn&#39;t call anyone any names. As a\nsubordinate list moderator, I was well within my\nrights granted by Kitsuno to simply delete the email\nand ban the person from posting. I did not, as it was\nan attack directly on me--I chose not to act so I\ncould not be accused of acting out of malice. Kitsuno\ncan decide to ban or not ban, delete or not delete. \n\nIf you want information, this is a great place to be.\nIf you want affirmation, go see a therapist. \n\n\n--- Kitsuno &lt;samurai-listowner@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It really is not an issue of scholarship.  First he\n&gt; asks a vague \n&gt; question, which is fine. but he also later mentions\n&gt; that he has more \n&gt; information that he then refuses to release, which\n&gt; tells me he isnt \n&gt; very interested in getting information.  The\n&gt; response that offended \n&gt; him seemed pretty benign to me, but that is just my\n&gt; humble opinion.  \n&gt; Regardless, it makes sense to me that if you ask a\n&gt; question, you try \n&gt; to include as much information as possible, which he\n&gt; apparently \n&gt; didnt do if he is now bragging about having other\n&gt; information.  \n&gt; Anyway, these groups are pretty easy, but not always\n&gt; a one way \n&gt; street. Just because you ask for someone to do your\n&gt; homework for you \n&gt; doesnt mean they will do it willingly. People tend\n&gt; to want a reason \n&gt; to do you work for you. That was part of what I was\n&gt; trying to say.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barry\n&gt; Thomas&quot; &lt;warlord@i...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Brothers,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regardless of your emotional state, this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is brutally vague in the extreme.  If you cant\n&gt; give a single\n&gt; &gt; &gt; detail more on this, or even where you found it,\n&gt; I can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee that no one will be able to help\n&gt; you...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, granted the original presentation was far\n&gt; from scholarly, \n&gt; but surely\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not the only one to (a) find it intriguing and\n&gt; (b) find a \n&gt; little bell\n&gt; &gt; ringing in my head, not from the Sengoku Jidai but\n&gt; from mid-Edo.  \n&gt; Granted\n&gt; &gt; the riposte from our original questioner was a far\n&gt; from measured \n&gt; response,\n&gt; &gt; but the replies from Dear List Owner and others\n&gt; whose name/s \n&gt; escape me\n&gt; &gt; hardly encourages anyone to ask any question at\n&gt; all, no matter how \n&gt; seemingly\n&gt; &gt; not PC for the eminent scholars on this list. \n&gt; Reminds of the \n&gt; lampoons I\n&gt; &gt; have got...  So, why do I persist with this list? \n&gt; Because I love \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; subject matter and see it as an important adjunct\n&gt; to my sword \n&gt; studies and\n&gt; &gt; collecting, and because the awesome knowledge of\n&gt; practitioners in \n&gt; the field\n&gt; &gt; just takes my breath away.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can&#39;t we be a little less uptight on this list??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Barry Thomas\n&gt; &gt; (Melbourne, Australia - just over the road from\n&gt; Jim Breen&#39;s campus)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n\n"
