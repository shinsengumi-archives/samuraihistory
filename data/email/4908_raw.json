Herrigel went to Japan in search of mysticism and \nzen. Zen has very little to do with Kyudo. As a book on zen it&#39;s ok, \nbut don&#39;t fall into the &quot;zen  trap&quot;. Things overlap, but Kyudo is NOT \nzen. Nor is Zen Kyudo.\nM.J.Peters\n\n\nHi Michael - I think there might be  quite a few Japanese \npractitioners who would disagree with you a bit. As a student in \nTokyo back in the early 80&#39;s I once attended a kyudo and kendo \ndemonstration at Yasukuni-jinja which was followed by a   \nlecture  on the philosophical underpinnings of kyudo, kendo, \nchado, etc.  by Nakamura Hajime (whose authority in Japan on \nthis subject is unquestioned). Nakamura-sensei (Toyo Bunka \nKenkyu-jo, Tokyo Daigaku) described the relationship between \nkyudo-Zen, kendo-Zen, etc as being co-terminus. It seems that \nyou practice kyudo, desho? Wouldn&#39;t you say that the &quot;goal&quot; of \nkyudo lies in the &quot;cultivation&quot; of &quot;mushin&quot;, &quot;munen&quot;? These are \ncentral Zen terms ... In fact, as you well know, the suffix &quot;do&quot; (kyu-\ndo) is a translation of the Sanskrit term &quot;marga&quot; which means \nthe &quot;path to enlightenment&quot;. Also, the training halls of kyudo, \nkendo, etc is called &quot;dojo&quot; which is translation of &quot;bodhimanda&quot; \n(the site where Buddhas attain enlightenment ...\n\nA  member of our tea ceremony group in Tokyo back in the day \nwho was studying kyudo once asked our tea sensei about the \nrelationship between tea and kyudo. He answered, &quot; Onaji desu \n- Mattaku onaji&quot;. I think if you contacted a judan kyudo sensei, he \nwould probably answer the same way if asked about the \nrelationship between Zen and kyudo...\n\nThis might irritate you a bit but it is intended with a bit of humor \nand certainly much love: You wrote &quot;bear in mind the agendas of \nwriters&quot;. The goal in Zen is to abandon all agendas. I think if a \nperson has an &quot;agenda&quot;, he or she might  certainly learn - and \nlearn well -  the mechanics of a Japanese martial arts. However, \nthere is a point beyond where no progress is possible until \n&quot;agendas&quot; are abandoned..\n\nStill working on my own agendas,\nryhorikawa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
