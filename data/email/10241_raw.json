In a book I \nwa=\r\ns recently reading, &quot;Young Japan: Yokohama and Yedo&quot; by John R. Black, the =\r\n\nauthor writes about witnessing an execution sometime in the 1860`s in the =\r\nTobe \narea of Yokohama. Also a journalist in Japan in 1880 wrote a story ab=\r\nout the \nexecution ground. You can see the story here: \n\n\nhttp://query.nyti=\r\nmes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=3DFB0B10FA3F551A7493C0A81782D85F448784F9\n \n\nI=\r\n have been living in Yokohama for 4 years and was quite surprised to hear a=\r\nbout \nthis bleak part of Yokohama`s past. I figure there must be some kind =\r\nof \nmemorial, shrine or, at least a sign marking the site - but, thus far, =\r\nno luck \nat all in finding it. \n\n\nThanks. \n\n[Non-text portions of this mess=\r\nage have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have=\r\n been removed]\n\n\n"
