I lived in Japan with\nto different families of Samurai\nancestors.  I will reply to your question from what they told me and\nfrom an encyclopedia of Japan for English speakers I purchased in\nJapan.  But, first I have to take care of a few household chores and\neat dinner.  What is her deadline for her homework?\n\nBlue Skies,\n\nDavid\n\n\nOn Oct 26, 2006, at 3:21 PM, Lin Bates wrote:\n\n&gt; My daughter has a History Day question.\n&gt;\n&gt; What would be considered a Samurai triumph??\n&gt;\n&gt; Would would be considered a Samurai tragedy??\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n---\nSamurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\nSamurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n---\n\nJoin the 2007 Samurai Fiction Contest:\nhttp://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html\nYahoo!
