There are four ranks: j� (purity), mei\n(brightness), sei (righteousness), and choku (uprightness). Regulations for\nranking are fixed by the Jinja Honch�.\n\nJinja Honch�\nAssociation of Shinto Shrines organized when the nation&#39;s shrines were\ndisestablished as a result of the Occupation order issued in 1945.\nMembership includes most of all shrines in Japan (about 80.000 shrines) and\nabout 20.000 priests. Guided by the spiritual leadership of Ise no Jing�.\nThe Jinja Honch� works to preserve Shrine Shinto (Jinja Shinto) and to\nMaintain Principles of integrity. Its head office is in Tokyo, and local\nbrances (jinjach�) are located throughout Japan.\n\nJinja Shint�\nShrine Shinto. The traditional religious practices carried on in shrines\nthroughout Japan&#39;s history, as well as the attitudes toward life which\nsupport these practices. At the core of this religion exists a reverent\nreligious experience which has prevailed from antiquity and which leads\nJapanese believers to experience the will and activity of the gods through\nvarious events of everyday life. Shrine Shinto claims no founder, but\nthrough the interpretation of classical mythology and the re-evaluation of\nfolk ways, it is gradually organizing its own theology. The\npolitico-theoretical side of Jinja-Shint� is called Kokka Shint� or State\nShinto. At present there are in Japan some 80.000 shrines of which some 97\npercent belong to the Jinja Honch�.\n\nKugutsu and Kugai, I didn&#39;t found anything about.\n\nI found however Asagutsu:\nA kind of shoe worn by nobles in ancient times, and by Shinto priests during\nthe performance of certain religious ceremonies today. Believed to have\noriginally been constructed of leather, asagutsu have been made of hollowed\npaulownia wood finished in black lacquer since the Heian period.\n\nYou can perhaps have more acess to shinto mysticism without becoming a\npriest, through shugendo, but you will surelly face the Honji Suijaku Setsu\ncosmogony inside the Shinbutsu Sh�g� that I already have mentioned before.\n\nregards\n\nOctavio Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho\nS�o Paulo - SP Brazil\n\nPost Scriptum: I could put the kanji of the japanese mentioned names here,\nbut does not have any apropriate software do input such data in the email.\nDoes anybody know any freeware download I can do for that purpose?\n\n\nMessage: 15\n   Date: Sat, 31 Jan 2004 07:28:51 -0800 (PST)\n   From: Joseph Salvador &lt;jdsalvador3@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Re:Gasaraki/shintoism mysticism questions\n\nDo a websearch for &quot;Japanese Journal of Religious\nStudies&quot; and find the publisher&#39;s site. They have most\nif not all of their article online as PDF&#39;s that you\ncan check. I ran across an entire issue on Shugendo,\nbut I didn&#39;t actually read them yet, that might help\nyou.\nI think it was an issue from the late 1980&#39;s, not\nsure...\nJoe\n\n\n\n--- keiman0 &lt;KeimanZero@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Can any of ya explain the meanings and historical\n&gt; significance of\n&gt; Shintoism mysticisms most notably Gasar or Gasaraki\n&gt; rituals? What\n&gt; does Gasar or Gasaraki mean? How about kai, kugutsu,\n&gt; kugai? The OT\n&gt; from Gasaraki is &quot;Message #9&quot;. Does this refer to\n&gt; the Samurai\n&gt; handbook &quot;Haga Kure&quot;? We have seen up to the\n&gt; penultimate ep and will\n&gt; see the final one soon. Arigato a lot and ja\n&gt; mata-Keiman and Kei.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
