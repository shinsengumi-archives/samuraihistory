Not now, though; at least no=\r\nt entirely.\nMTV-generation directors such as Hiroyuki Nakano (&quot;Red Shadow&quot;)=\r\n and\nRyuhei Kitamura (&quot;Aragami&quot;) have decided that the essence of the genre=\r\n\nis action -- with all those swords coming out.\n\nTheir jidai geki are arcad=\r\ne fight games on film, set to thumping,\npulsing electronic scores. Forget t=\r\nhe long, slow build-up to a\none-against-all climax. These guys start with a=\r\n bang -- or, rather,\nblood spurts -- and never let up.\n\nHideaki Sunaga&#39;s &quot;N=\r\nagurimono: Love and Kill&quot; is in this line: The\nfirst scene is of two man-mo=\r\nuntains slamming the bejesus out of each\nother. His film, however, was prod=\r\nuced by Dream Stage Entertainment\n(DSE), which also manages Pride Fighting =\r\nChampionships -- mixed\nmartial arts bouts fought by champions in their resp=\r\nective\ndisciplines: judo, wrestling, karate and so on. This, folks, is the\n=\r\nreal deal and the heart of the film is bouts between real Pride\nfighters --=\r\n Kazushi Sakuraba, Yoshihiro Takayama, Wanderlei Silva,\nQuinton Jackson and=\r\n Don Fry -- that make most martial-arts movie\naction look as choreographed =\r\nas ballet.\n\nThis is also not the sort of thing usually found in a real jida=\r\ni geki\n-- a problem the film only papers over.\n\nThe story: A foppish Englis=\r\nh businessman (Christian Storms) stages a\nmartial-arts contest between cham=\r\npions of two rival yakuza gangs to\nresolve a dispute over a wonder drug he =\r\nis dealing and that both sides\nwant.\n\nThe leader of one gang, the short-fus=\r\ned, pistol-packing Aijiro\n(Takanori Jinnai) is mad for a new anything-goes =\r\nfighting style in\nwhich two opponents punch, kick, wrestle and choke each o=\r\nther until\none is unconscious -- or dead. His loyal, dandyish lieutenant An=\r\nrai\n(Hiroshi Tamaki) scouts new fighters, but never steps in the ring\nhimse=\r\nlf. On the day of the big event, Anrai spots the businessman\ndallying with =\r\na beautiful prostitute (Asami Mizukawa) with whom he was\nraised, and has lo=\r\nng loved. There is more at stake here, we start to\nsee, than who whups who.=\r\n\n\nThe plot complications exist in a parallel universe from the fighting\nact=\r\nion -- making &quot;Nagurimono&quot; a strange, if intermittently watchable,\nhybrid. =\r\nProducer Nobuyuki Sakakibara, who also heads DSE, should have\nput the one P=\r\nride fighter with rudimentary acting skills -- the\nlikable but scarily powe=\r\nrful Kazushi Sakuraba -- at the center of the\nfilm. Then he might have had =\r\na &quot;Rocky,&quot; not a curiosity.\n\nMore in the traditional jidai geki line is Mit=\r\nsuo Kurotsuchi&#39;s &quot;Semi\nShigure,&quot; a film based on a novel by Shuhei Fujisawa=\r\n that has already\nbeen made into an NHK drama with a prizewinning script by=\r\n Kurotsuchi.\nSet in Tohoku in the late Edo Period, the film has as its hero=\r\n, not\nthe usual historical figure or super swordsman, but a young samurai,\n=\r\nBunshiro Maki (Takuya Ishida), near the bottom of the status ladder.\nHe fal=\r\nls even farther down when his kindly father (Ken Ogata) is\naccused of plott=\r\ning against the clan lord and is forced to commit\nseppuku (ritual suicide).=\r\n\n\nMore than Bunshiro&#39;s struggle to regain family honor, however, the\nstory =\r\nfocuses on his relationship with Fuku (Aimi Satsukawa), a\nservant girl he f=\r\nalls for as a 15-year-old, but says nary a word to.\nThe bashful Fuku can ha=\r\nrdly bring herself to speak to him as well,\nthough she loves him madly. The=\r\nn she is sent away to Edo to serve in\nthe lord&#39;s household. Meanwhile, Buns=\r\nhiro and his patiently enduring\nmother (Chieko Baisho) struggle on in pover=\r\nty and disgrace. Bunshiro&#39;s\none salvation is his swordsmanship, which he pr=\r\nactices to the point of\nexhaustion, as though to sweat out his pain.\n\nSkip =\r\nahead a few years. Fuku (Yoshino Kimura) is now the lord&#39;s\nconcubine -- and=\r\n the mother of his child. She has also become the\nfocus of a clan successio=\r\nn struggle, with one side wanting her and her\nson violently removed from th=\r\ne power equation. Hearing of her danger,\nBunshiro (Somegoro Ichikawa) and t=\r\nwo childhood pals plan to rescue\nher. The swords finally come out.\n\nThis pa=\r\nttern -- an ordinary samurai placed under extraordinary\npressure, with the =\r\nstress more on basic human emotions than\nslice-and-dice action -- is also t=\r\nhat of Yoji Yamada&#39;s &quot;Tasogare\nSeibei (The Twilight Samurai)&quot; and &quot;Kakushik=\r\nen Oni no Tsume (The\nHidden Blade),&quot; both likewise based on fiction by Fuji=\r\nsawa.\n\nKurotsuchi, a veteran TV scriptwriter and director, uses Yamada&#39;s wo=\r\nrk\nas a model and succeeds, much as Yamada did, in humanizing his people\nan=\r\nd moving his audience. In key emotional scenes, as when Fuku and\nBunshiro p=\r\nush a cart carrying the body of Bunshiro&#39;s father up a\nmountain path, the s=\r\nimplicity of word and image and the &quot;timeless&quot;\npace open up the tear ducts,=\r\n uncontrollably. (Not that I tried to hold\nit in.)\n\nKurotsuchi risks underc=\r\nutting his story&#39;s power by using two sets of\nactors for the roles of Bunsh=\r\niro and Fuku. Somegoro Ichikawa -- a\nkabuki star who has branched out succe=\r\nssfully into contemporary dramas\nand films -- makes a smooth transition fro=\r\nm the actor playing his\nyounger self, while Yoshino Kimura is prim, pretty =\r\nand completely\ndifferent from the shy, pudgy-faced girl of the opening scen=\r\nes. It is\nonly in the film&#39;s charged climax that she bridges the gap, and t=\r\nhe\ntears start flowing again.\n\nMany recent Japanese films about star-crosse=\r\nd love only dress up\nancient genre conventions in new fashions, from MTV an=\r\nd elsewhere. The\nmore conventionally shot &quot;Semi Shigure&quot; strips away the cl=\r\niches to the\nplain, unbearable truth: Some goodbyes are forever, even at 15=\r\n.\nEspecially at 15.\n\nThe Japan Times: Oct. 21, 2005\n(C) All rights reserved=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"
