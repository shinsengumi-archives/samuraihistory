I was informed by some \nof you that the one form of vampire is the ghost woman who sucks the \nblood of children during the night. \n\nI remember hearing or reading I think about female vampires who \nstalked lords and dranktheir blood. The only guise they had was cat  \nand when in it you could tell them apart from an ordinary cat by the \ntwo tails they had instead of just one.\n\nDoes anybody know about this? I&#39;ve looked and looked around but \nhaven&#39;t found this information again. Help.\n\nThanks,\nRod\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
