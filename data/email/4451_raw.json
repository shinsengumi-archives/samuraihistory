That&#39;s great! One thing to keep in mind \nis that we have to think about this topic over a very long period of t\nime. It&#39;s very rare to be able to state with 100% confidence that \nsomething is &quot;just so&quot;. \n\nOn Fri, 04 Jun 2004 06:11:57 -0000, zevlord\u001b$B$5$s\u001b(B wrote in message &lt;c9p3rd+pe4n@...&gt;\n\n&gt;They were both: \nAgreed.\n\n&gt;Three major ranks: \nWhy three? How do you define &quot;major&quot;?\n\n&gt;kenin - meaning &quot;housemen&quot;. They were the administrators or vassals.\nKenin had different meanings over a period of some 1000+ years. When \ntalking about Japanese history we need to be pretty clear exactly \nwhat period we&#39;re referring to.\n\n&gt;mounted samurai - Only high-ranking samurai warriors were allowed to \n&gt;fight on horse-back, and then foot soldiers. Sorry can&#39;t remember the \n&gt;Japanese Name&#39;s\n\nMounted samurai is not a &quot;rank&quot;. Higher level samurai (who were by \ndefinition rich) might have horses that they fought on from time to \ntime, or used for transportation.\n\nBy foot soldiers I&#39;m sure you mean ashigaru. This we can agree was \nusually the lowest rank of samurai or quasi-samurai, across alot of \nJapanese history.\n\nThere are plenty of other ways to group samurai, and many different \nranks or titles. For instance there is the ritsuryo system where each \ntitle was given a very specific, and numbered, rank. These titles \nexisted for a thousand years after the ritsuryo system disintigrated. \nObviously the titles were in name only since the risturyo system \nitself was gone.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
