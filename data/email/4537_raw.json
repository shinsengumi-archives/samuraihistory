Always when certain portions of \n&gt;&gt; his ideal map are in the \n&gt;&gt; hands of germans, other portions was independent. \n&gt;&gt; Some would say that he did \n&gt;&gt; attempted to do with the entire world what the \n&gt;&gt; bastard of Nobunaga attempted \n&gt;&gt; with Japan. \n&gt; \n&gt;Comment: I do not agree. Hitler identified the cause \n&gt;of the defeat of the previous German Empire as the \n&gt;racial impurity, which he generalized into a larger \n&gt;sphere of historical context. \n&gt;In essence, in his book, &#39;Mein Kampf&#39;, he claimed that \n&gt;in order for an empire to last, it was necessary to \n&gt;eliminate the racial impurity, the mass bulk of which \n&gt;he also associated with Jews. \n&gt; \n&gt;As a practical realization of his &#39;theoretical&#39; \n&gt;reasoning, he devised a systematic mass execution, \n&gt;which his followers &#39;efficiently&#39; implemented. \n&gt; \n&gt;His ideal map of German nation, which I also believe \n&gt;was on Hitler&#39;s mind, therefore was not the cause of \n&gt;his &#39;mass&#39; execuation in a strict sense whereas as for \n&gt;Nobunaga, the reunification itself was the primary \n&gt;cause of the execution. The expansive warfare \n&gt;motivated by his ideal territory can be quoted at most \n&gt;as the secondary cause of the mass exectution. \n&gt; \nAlthough it may be apparently a race issue, notes on his mein kamph proves \nwrong. \n\nHitler mentioned in his mein kamph that no matter the race, an certain \npeople can be &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; deppending on their cultural background. He \nalso said &quot;the first step to destroy a nation, is to destroy its culture&quot;. \n\nHe fought non christians in general at Germany, Jews, homosexuals, people \nwho was freethinkers and didn�t supported the Nazi Regime (they was sent to \nconcentration camps despite if they was &quot;pure race&quot;-dogs with pedigree or \nnot). So, more than racial, it was even more about an ideological \nabsolutism. \n\nIn this way, he was very alike Nobunaga, Oda. \n\n\n&gt;&gt; Hitler killed jews not due to racist motivations \n&gt;&gt; only, but also religious, \n&gt; \n&gt;Question 1: I do not understand what you meant by \n&gt;&#39;religious&#39;. \nOctavio: Means: NO CHRISTIAN! Although the precedent catholic concentration \ncamps at Yugoslavia killed not only jews, non christians, homosexuals and \npeople who though differently of the interests of the Rebel Catholic \nUstashi, they also killed protestants, lutherans, catholic orthodox as well, \nGermany under Adolph Hitler, killed just no christians. Other denominations \nof christianity was more safer than it was in Yugoslavia. Religion is also a \nset of morals and ideas, not only simple an belief system. If he was an \nabsolutist, he fough also, what he considered inconvenient religions for his \npurposes. \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; And... Although this is offtopic, Cesar, you may \n&gt;&gt; criticise my History View \n&gt;&gt; Points as much as ye want, but was not any \n&gt;&gt; non-christian religion who always \n&gt;&gt; was conspiring to change history logs, doing \n&gt;&gt; adulteration and falsification \n&gt;&gt; on the documents, such as what whas done with \n&gt;&gt; certain doccuments by Taccitus \n&gt;&gt; and others to &quot;prove&quot; that Jesus existed. As well, \n&gt;&gt; to accuse several others \n&gt;&gt; religions (including judaism) of &quot;human sacrifice&quot; \n&gt;&gt; and all the same rant as \n&gt;&gt; aways. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The japanese remember very well their history. \n&gt;&gt; Thanks to Tokugawa again. \n&gt; \n&gt;Question 2: Do you mean that the Japanese remember \n&gt;well that Nobunaga = Hitler? Is this how many Japanese \n&gt;historians interpret the historical postion of \n&gt;Nobunaga and teach young Japanese students in their \n&gt;history classes? \nOctavio: I mean exactly what I mean. You added meaning to my stated phrases. \nJapanese people does not taunt, at least at the time I learn japanese \nhistory, things like &quot;loosers was the evil&quot; and &quot;winners was the good&quot;, but \njust telling the facts. They also din�t put in their history books that \nShinto do human sacrifices, and buddhists do the same as well. But if \nchristianity would take over Japan as it happened with my country, and \nseveral scandinavian ones, Shinto and Buddhism would be despicted in history \nbooks as &quot;absolute EVIL&quot;. That was my point. \n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; And although I am not a communist... \n&gt;&gt; &quot;the people who don�t know their true history \n&gt;&gt; deeply, are fated to repeat it \n&gt;&gt; in circles&quot; \n&gt;&gt; Mao Tse Tung \n&gt; \n&gt;Question 3: How is this quotation of Mao related to \n&gt;your argument? \nOctavio: Think better, and you will realize what I mean. \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Don�t go around spreading \n&gt;&gt; that I am telling lies. \n&gt;&gt; Stand up and PROVE I am wrong. \n&gt;&gt; The History of the Church \n&gt;&gt; is full of conspirations of ambition and power&quot; \n&gt;&gt; Goetche \n&gt; \n&gt;Question 4: How does this quotation PROVE that you did \n&gt;not lie when you said that the Japanese parents quote \n&gt;Nobunaga to scare their children? \n&gt; \nOctavio: I saw it with my own eyes when at Japan 14 years ago, and also \nmentioned in some mangas as well at that time. Can you prove the contrary? I \ndon�t care if you do not believe me, or even if you believe as well. I am \nnot a preacher. My life�s meaning will not end if you don�t believe me. \nThose who want know the truth, not only about what I stated, but about every \nsubject, must just not simply believe in what me or other people affirmed, \nor skeptically disbelieve, but do their own research in all the sources they \ncan access. Including public libraries and internet. \n\nFor an example... Who cares if you didn�t believe in what I stated about \nBuddhism history in Japan and their co-relaction with Samurai? The sources, \nlike Kalama Sutta, shingon-tendai references are available even in english \nnowaddays. And if one want study the tripitaka, one can become a monk, learn \nPali and spend a life reading it. In fact, is what even Buddha recomended to \ndo in Kalama Sutra. Don�t believe me, go and read it. he he he \n\n&gt; Sincerely, \n&gt; \n&gt; Changsub Lee \n&gt; \n\nNot hypocritally...
