Their crack down on\n&gt; christianity wasn&#39;t so much hatred toward christains\n&gt; as much as eliminating a disruptive force. The\n&gt; samurai(Oda Nobunaga) also cracked down on the Buddist\n&gt; Ikko Sect for the same reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jake\n&gt; --- Tom Helm &lt;junkmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Carmen et al-\n&gt; &gt; \tIf christians have lots to learn from Samurai, then\n&gt; &gt; I would suggest \n&gt; &gt; they could learn it ALL from Christian Samurai. I\n&gt; &gt; would examine the \n&gt; &gt; history of christianity in Kyushu and the lives of\n&gt; &gt; the Christian \n&gt; &gt; Daimyo, sounds like a natural subject for your\n&gt; &gt; interests...\n&gt; &gt; -t\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
