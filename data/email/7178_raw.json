This was\r\n&gt; the only article I&#39;ve seen, and I had to hunt that\r\n&gt; one down. I was mistaken\r\n&gt; that it was CNN. when it was MSNBC, for that I\r\n&gt; apologize. \r\n\r\nYou had to hunt it down, because it&#39;s not REAL. It&#39;s\r\nhosted off the UCLA website, which leads me to believe\r\nit&#39;s the creation of one or more UCLA students, as a\r\njoke. NOTHING comes up on the MSNBC site if you look\r\nfor anything related to this. \r\n\r\nNot only is the website a parody, but all this\r\nbusiness about being in court and defecating is ALSO a\r\nparody/joke. My only question is this: is it the same\r\nperson/people as those who created the site, or is it\r\nsomeone making their own spinoff to the saga?\r\n\r\n*sigh*\r\n\r\nAnd people get upset when I lament the failure of\r\ntoday&#39;s youth to grasp irony... \r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n__________________________________ \r\nDiscover Yahoo! \r\nHave fun online with music videos, cool games, IM and more.
