A friend bought it for \nme in a second hand bookshop. This copy was printed in 1951 and \nwent through several reprints immediately. I think the author must \nhave been nissei from Hawai who got conscripted into the Imperial \nArmy as the book was written in English.\n\nIt&#39;s one of the best war books I&#39;ve ever read and the descriptions of the \nindoctrination and the brutality are quite detailed.  I wanted to know \nmore about Tasaki and what happened to him after the war.\n\nI&#39;ll see what else I can find from the Australia-Japan conflict \nperspective.\n\n(and I would love to read the results)\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
