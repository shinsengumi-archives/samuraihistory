You didn&#39;t even opponent would be on foot he could =\r\nhave\n&gt;  &gt;came at you on horseback! How effective would any of our fancy\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt;modern sword styles have been, back then? While we were still edging\n&gt;  &gt;o=\r\nur toes forward gauging the distance between our swords... some\n&gt;  &gt;armored=\r\n samurai on a warhorse would skewer us with his spear!&quot;\n\nWhile some of the =\r\nfootwork techniques of kend=F4 do not work particularly \nwell in some of th=\r\ne conditions described, I think that the analysis \nimplicit above is based =\r\non modern ideas about warfare. In a LOT of \npre-modern warfare you didn&#39;t j=\r\nust go around willy nilly killing \neverybody in sight. In Western Europe, a=\r\n man at arms could get himself \nhung by his own lord for killing an enemy k=\r\nnight! In Japan, it was \noften important to identify your opponent before k=\r\nilling him or to even \ncapture him alive so that he or his head could be ex=\r\nhibited for the \nreward. Also, despite anything that kend=F4 instructors mi=\r\nght tell you, \nswords just were not that important. They were seldom the pr=\r\nimary \nweapon. Rather, they were generally a weapon of last resort. The \nbu=\r\nsiness about toe edging and maintaining distance does make sense in \nthe co=\r\nntext of dueling during the Edo period.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this messag=\r\ne have been removed]\n\n\n"
