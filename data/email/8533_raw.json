Politely put, hogwash.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Thus it comes as no surprise that Japanese =\r\nexpert, Tsunenari \nTokugawa,\n&gt; &gt;the 18th descendant of the man who started =\r\nthe Tokugawa period,\n&gt; &gt;believes that Pakistan can only progress if it has =\r\nvalues and\n&gt; &gt;education two things that are essential for the growth of a \n=\r\nnation as\n&gt; &gt;Japan has seen.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; That might be true.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Giving a=\r\n historical account of Japan&#39;s progress, Tokugawa said \nthat\n&gt; &gt;the Tokugaw=\r\na period in Japan lasted from 1603 to 1868 during which\n&gt; &gt;time it progress=\r\ned to the heights of which England had not seen.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ???  Who&#39;s bet=\r\nter off? A Japanese peasant or a British farmer? \n&gt; Especially later I thin=\r\nk the answer is easy.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;For example, the literacy rate during this peri=\r\nod was high-70 to \n80\n&gt; &gt;percent among males and 40 to 50 percent among fem=\r\nales. He said \nthe\n&gt; &gt;literacy rate in most European countries and America =\r\nwas much \nlower.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Interesting quote, how is it figured? Does it =\r\ncount peasants or is \nit \n&gt; just people, i.e. merchants and samurai... Foll=\r\nowing figures are \nfrom a \n&gt; website, bs alert!\n&gt; The situation in America =\r\nroughly parallels that in England. In \n1650, \n&gt; male literacy in America wa=\r\ns 60%. Between 1800 and 1840, literacy \nin the \n&gt; Northern States increased=\r\n from 75% to 90%, and in Southern States \nfrom \n&gt; 60% to 81%.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;More th=\r\nan 15,000 elementary schools, besides 260 Samurai schools \nand\n&gt; &gt;2,000 pri=\r\nvate academies, were established all over Japan. The \nteaching\n&gt; &gt;system of=\r\n both regular primary schools and Samurai schools was\n&gt; &gt;separate. The stan=\r\ndard of education was very high at that time.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen Meiji t=\r\nextbooks, funny man.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;The top priority of Tukugawa Japan was its stron=\r\ng consensus on\n&gt; &gt;national security. There was strong sense of human equali=\r\nty under \nthe\n&gt; &gt;class system also, Tokugawa explained.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Rotfl T=\r\nhis sentence is awesome!!! My peasants love me, pull!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;The moral stand=\r\nards among the elite were high as well. He said the\n&gt; &gt;elite followed the t=\r\neachings of noted Chinese philosopher, \nConfucius.\n&gt; &gt;Its people were envir=\r\nonmentally conscious and no one cut down \ntrees.\n&gt; &gt;At the most people cut =\r\nbranches and bark for fuel.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; This guy is really so full of it th=\r\nat I almost can&#39;t stand it... \nHow did \n&gt; they rebuild Edo which had a tend=\r\nency to burn down every few years.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;At that time, a very sophisticated=\r\n market economy was flourishing \nin\n&gt; &gt;Japan and a large number of people w=\r\nere living in cities. For \nexample,\n&gt; &gt;the population of Tokyo at that time=\r\n was one million, whereas \nother\n&gt; &gt;important cities such as Osaka and Kyot=\r\no had a population of over\n&gt; &gt;400,000 people only.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; That part is=\r\n true. The rise of the great cities and the merchant \nclass \n&gt; are the majo=\r\nr event in this era.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;and after 20 years all foreign experts were sent=\r\n back. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Not even.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;During that period a huge transition took pla=\r\nce and education at \na higher level was also initiated in Japanese.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; I forget which private university in the 1900s had an Anglo dean \nwith=\r\n \n&gt; the saying like &quot;Be bold or conquer&quot; or something along those \nlines.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;From 1868 to 1945, Japan witnessed 77 years of imperial rule \nduring\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;which it fought many wars, the last being World War II, which it\n&gt; &gt;even=\r\ntually lost. Still, Tokugawa said the Japanese managed to \nmaintain\n&gt; &gt;thei=\r\nr values.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I wonder which ones he&#39;s talking about? Post-war Japa=\r\nn is an \nactual \n&gt; democratic nation with a very modern outlook. Nobody has=\r\n to sell \ntheir \n&gt; daughters anymore to make ends meet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Tokugawa, nev=\r\nertheless, admitted that Japan is facing some social\n&gt; &gt;problems. For examp=\r\nle, young people do not marry, which is \ncausing a\n&gt; &gt;huge problem for Japa=\r\nnese families. He also said that more than 25\n&gt; &gt;percent of the overall Jap=\r\nanese population is older than 65 years.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Raising a family in a =\r\n400 square foot apartment would tend to put \na \n&gt; damper on things. A frien=\r\nd of mine thought Stanford had made a \nmistake \n&gt; and put her in married ho=\r\nusing and we told her no, a 550 square \nfoot \n&gt; studio is a fairly normal s=\r\nize for one person in the US.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Tokugawa also said that the old buildin=\r\ngs were being demolished \nfor\n&gt; &gt;new and modern plazas, which was a matter =\r\nof serious concern.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Some of them should be demolished, they are=\r\n firetraps! While I \nlike old \n&gt; buildings, I can sympathize with my Japane=\r\nse friends who can only \n&gt; remember smelly toilets, poor lighting and heati=\r\nng.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for sharing, it was good for a few laughs. Of course press =\r\n\n&gt; releases have a tendency to be overly upbeat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Eckman\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"
