An Akaido proverb goes lik=\r\ne this: There is many roads that lead to the top of the Mountain. But once =\r\nat the top the look up at the say moon. theres many ways to look at this bu=\r\nt i hope all can relate\n this meaning. \n \npeace\nGOD BLESS U\n\n\nNate Ledbette=\r\nr &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n--- james wilson wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello how r u. =\r\ni am not a samurai but i train very\n&gt; hard in Japanes art and i do my studi=\r\nes like many\n&gt; others on this forum. n e who i did name my Katana.\n&gt; i thin=\r\nk even before i got it. i named it Sabarashi.\n&gt; however i have no name for =\r\nmy short blade. well as\n&gt; for help on did actual samurai name theres well i=\r\n\n&gt; dont know. but good luck on ur searching.
