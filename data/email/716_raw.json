Published in 1969 First edition.\n\nThe title is Sengoku bushi jiten by Sasama Yoshihiko (translated by a \nJapanese friend here at work).\n\nMy question, does anyone know if an English Language translation of \nthis book exists?\nIf so can you provide some details for me.\n\nIf not any detail on the book and if it is worth me getting it \ntranslated. (Note looking at the book, and illustrations, I think the \nanswer is yes, I also assume it might be valuable.)\n\nMuch appreciated, and Nate if you want any other info on the other \nbook and its sources, just ask.\n\nthanks\nRob\n\nRob Broom\nWarhammer Historical General Manager.\nrobb@...\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rob:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, but I think I have all I need at this\n&gt; point...just trying to package it. I&#39;d forgotten how\n&gt; hard translation was, I haven&#39;t done it in several\n&gt; years. But I am chugging along.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am interested about the claim of only 1000\n&gt; arquebusiers...everything, including the Japanese\n&gt; sources I have, says 3000. \n&gt; \n&gt; nate\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
