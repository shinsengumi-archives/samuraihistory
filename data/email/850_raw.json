&lt;ray@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello Rod\n&gt; \n&gt;                My name is Ray King and I&#39;m from Washington in Tyne \n& Wear.It&#39;s pointless descibing myself so I will   \n&gt;                ask around first for the North Herts scale modelling \nclub and then for you.It would be great to meet up\n&gt;                with you and any other fellow members of the \nsamuraihistory group.\n&gt;                As you already know I am interested in the battle of \nNagashino (Shidarahara) and own Ospreys\n&gt;                Campaign Book No.69 &quot;Nagashino 1575 (Slaughter at \nthe Barricades) writen by Stephen Turnbull&quot;.\n&gt;                This book is of great value in my research,but the \nbattlefield diagram on page 70-71 shows the charge\n&gt;                and Sakai Tadatsugu as being on the right flank \nbehind Okubu Tadayo.This is misleading as Sakai\n&gt;                was in overall command of the raiding party on the \nforts of Tobigasuyama.\n&gt;                I am also having problems acounting for all the \ntroops involved in the battle.As yet I have only\n&gt;                researched the Oda/Tokugawa contingents as \nfollows...............................................................\n..\n&gt;

\n&gt;                In the text Shibata Katsuie is mentioned as \nsupporting Hashiba Hideyoshi when the Takeda\n&gt;                cavalry under the command of the Sanada brothers \nmanaged to break through into the Oda\n&gt;                lines where they engaged in hand-to-hand combat for \na short time before being killed.\n&gt;                Unfortunately there is no mention of him being in \ncharge of any contingent,but being one of\n&gt;                Oda Nobunaga&#39;s Fudai-shu (Hereditary Vassals) along \nwith Niwa Nagahide and Sakuma\n&gt;                Nobumori who both had positions in the battle \nline,surely Shibata Katsuie had the same amount\n&gt;                of men under his command and was given a position on \nthe battlefield.\n&gt;                It is estimated that Oda Nobunaga had 30,000 men and \nthat Tokugawa Ieyasu had 8,000 men\n&gt;                which gives me a shortfall even allowing for \n(Shibata Katsuie having 2,000 men) of 4,200 men.\n&gt;                I realise that the mounted samurai of the allied \nsides fought dismounted during the 8 hour \n&gt;                battle supporting the ashigaru spear and arquebus in \ntheir position behind the palisade fence\n&gt;                and only mounted for the pursuit of the Takeda once \nthese had begun their retreat.\n&gt;                Are these unaccounted men therefore horse holders \nfor the dismounted samurai ?\n&gt;                Of the Tozama-shu (the &quot;Outer Lords&quot;) only Takigawa \nKazumasu is mentioned and given a \n&gt;                position in the battle line, so where were the \nothers &quot;Nagaoka Fujitaka,Akechi Mitsuhide,\n&gt;                Ando Noritoshi and Mori Yoshinari&quot;.\n&gt;                My last question concerns the colours of various \nsashimono&#39;s, the samuraihistory group\n&gt;                have provided the mons of the lords and their clans, \nbut what of the colours ?\n&gt;                Was Tokugawa Nobuyasu&#39;s mon the same as his fathers \nat the battle and was Hashiba\n&gt;                Hideyoshi&#39;s mon the same as his later Toyotomi mon.\n&gt;                Sorry this has been so long winded,but I do need \nthis information!!!\n&gt;                See you on Sunday at the Royal Armouries at Leeds.\n&gt; \n&gt;                                                                     \n                                                       Ray King.\n&gt;                 \n&gt;                \n&gt; \n&gt;
