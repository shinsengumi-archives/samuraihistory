And it&#39;s an\nadjective--most named things aren&#39;t given ad=\r\njectives\nas names. \n\nhe just thought us the\n&gt; importance of karate just lik=\r\ne Master Funakoshi. i\n&gt; have a few of his books and he never metions it in\n=\r\n&gt; the ones i have abt his karate being linked with the\n&gt; samurai. \n\nThat&#39;s =\r\nbecause karate, unarmed defense, was developed\nby peasants as self-defense =\r\nagainst armed samurai.\nPeasants weren&#39;t allowed to have weapons. Well, that=\r\n&#39;s\nthe simple version, anyways. \n\nlast but not least i also studied some\n&gt; =\r\nchinese martial arts and they have very simular\n&gt; princeples. so that lets =\r\none know just because the\n&gt; teaching is simular the two r not the same.\n\nMa=\r\nny martial arts and traditions have the same values.\nYou can find that all =\r\nover the world. \n\nAn\n&gt; Akaido proverb goes like this: \n\nNot to be picky, bu=\r\nt its &quot;Aikido&quot;, not &quot;Akaido&quot;. \n\nNate\n\n\n\n__________________________________ =\r\n\nDo you Yahoo!? \nTake Yahoo!
