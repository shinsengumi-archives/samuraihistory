Samurai Rebellion was made in 1967 and was \ndirected b=\r\ny Masaki Kobayashi. It stars Toshiro Mifune, Yoko Tsukasa, \nand Tatsuya Nak=\r\nadai. Mifune, a legend in Japan cinema, stars as \nIsaburo, an aging swordsm=\r\nan living a quiet life. When his lord \nbegins making unreasonable demands, =\r\nhowever, Isaburo has enough and \nthe peaceful family man takes a stand agai=\r\nnst injustice.\n\nThe second film in the series is Hidden Fortress, which wil=\r\nl screen \non Wednesday, Sept 7 and Sept. 8 at 7:00, 9:40 nightly. Director =\r\n\nAkira Kurosawa&#39;s 1958 film stars Toshiro Mifune and Minoru Chiaki as \na ge=\r\nneral and a princess that must dodge enemy clans while smuggling \nthe royal=\r\n treasure out of hostile territory with two bumbling, \nconniving peasants a=\r\nt their sides. The film inspired Star Wars.\n\nThe series continues with a ne=\r\nw 35mm print of Harakiri from Friday, \nSept 9 through Monday, Sept 12, at 7=\r\n:00, 9:40 nightly; and Saturday \nat 1:30, 4:15. Harakiri was produced in 19=\r\n62 by director Masaki \nKobayashi and stars Tatsuya Nakadai and Rentaro Miku=\r\nni. Following \nthe collapse of his clan, unemployed samurai Hanshiro Tsugum=\r\no \n(Nakadai) arrives at the manor of Lord Iyi, begging to commit ritual \nsu=\r\nicide on his property. Iyi&#39;s clansmen, believing the desperate \nronin is me=\r\nrely angling for charity, try to force him to eviscerate \nhimself=97but the=\r\ny have underestimated his honor and his past. Winner \nof the 1963 Cannes Sp=\r\necial Jury Prize, the films portrays feudal \nauthority and hypocrisy.\n\nA ne=\r\nw 35mm print of Sword of Doom follows on Thursday, Sept 15 \nthrough Sept 17=\r\n, at 7:20, 9:40 nightly; and Saturday at 2:30, 5:00. \nThe film was produced=\r\n in 1966 by director Kihachi Okamoto and stars \nTatsuya Nakadai and Toshiro=\r\n Mifune in the story of a wandering \nsamurai who finds violence at every tu=\r\nrn. Full of carnage and not \nfor the faint of heart, the film traces the sl=\r\now disintegration of \naristocratic, savage loner Ryunosuke (Nakadai), whose=\r\n murderous \ndetermination bypasses any sense of mercy or remorse. This samu=\r\nrai \nclassic is a jaw-dropping exploration of good and evil.\n\nThe series co=\r\nntinues on Sunday, Sept 18 and Monday, Sept 19 with a \nnew 35mm print of &quot;K=\r\nill!&quot; at 7:20, 9:40 nightly. The film was \nproduced in 1968 by director Kih=\r\nachi Okamoto and stars Tatsuya \nNakadai and Etsushi Takahashi. This dark-hu=\r\nmored action film follows \nthe story of a pair of down-on-their-luck swords=\r\nmen arrive in a \nwindblown town and become involved in a local clan dispute=\r\n. One \nlongs to become a noble samurai while the other prefers living \nanon=\r\nymously with gangsters. But when they discover the wrongdoings \nof the nefa=\r\nrious leader, they side with a band of rebels who are \nunder siege at a rem=\r\note mountain cabin. Though true to samurai \nconvention, Okamoto&#39;s film tech=\r\nnique borrows from chanbara classics \nand has a bit of Spaghetti Western fe=\r\nel.\n\nLong considered the epic masterpiece of samurai film, director Akira \n=\r\nKurosawa&#39;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; will be screened on Sept 21 and Sept 22 \nat 7:30=\r\n nightly. The 1954 film stars Toshiro Mifune and Takashi \nShimura in a film=\r\n that seamlessly weaves philosophy and \nentertainment, delicate human emoti=\r\nons and relentless action. Seven \nSamurai became the foundation for action =\r\nfilms from the Spaghetti \nWestern to the urban shoot-em-ups of the 1980s. \n=\r\n\nOak Street Cinema is a nonprofit single-screen movie house in \nMinneapolis=\r\n. It is located at 309 Oak Street SE at the corner of Oak \nSt. & Washington=\r\n Ave SE.
