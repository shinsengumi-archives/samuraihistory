But I have another question: how many shots per \nminute (depending on your speed of reload) could these guns fire at \nthe beginning of the 1600s? Or more to the point: how much time did \nyou need to reload? In the commentaries to the 7 Samurai DVD it is \nsaid that 2 minutes were needed, but I would like to confirm that, if \npossible.\n\nThe Wolf of Mibu\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Dave Jackson &lt;nihontonut@s...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Volly fire of guns was first used in Japan at the battle of \nNagashino in 1575. My question is, \n&gt; is this the first time it was employed anywhere? When was this \ntactic first used in Europe?\n&gt; I know the europeans were using the &quot;broadside&quot; in naval warfare \nbut when was in first used\n&gt; by infantry, anyone know?\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave Jackson\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\nYahoo!
