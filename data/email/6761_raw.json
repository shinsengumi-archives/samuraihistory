Hidetada was officially shogun by now (1605-23) but \nIeyasu still dominated policy until his death in 1616 (and intended to \ncarry on doing so afterwards in spirit). So the  executions of 1622, \ncame after Ieyasu&#39;s death and were authorised by Hidetada, but were a \nfollow-up to Ieyasu&#39;s policy and intentions. This fierce anti-Christian \npolicy continued under Iemitsu (1623-51), by which time most \nChristians had been killed, had recanted, or gone underground in \nremote villages in Kyushu.\n\nI got the gist of this from McClain: A Modern History of Japan.  McClain \nsays as many as 4,000 died,\n\nIf whoever started this thread is still reading: to compare and contrast \nTokugawa Ieyasu and Lee Kwan Yew would make an interesting topic!\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, Angel Elibureau \n&gt; &gt; &lt;angel_nbi@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As we know, it was Tokugawa Ieyasu who ordered the killing of \n&gt; &gt; Christians in Japan. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmmm....
