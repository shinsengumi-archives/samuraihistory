In a book I \nwas recently r=\r\neading, &quot;Young Japan: Yokohama and Yedo&quot; by John R. Black, the \nauthor writ=\r\nes about witnessing an execution sometime in the 1860`s in the Tobe \narea o=\r\nf Yokohama. Also a journalist in Japan in 1880 wrote a story about the \nexe=\r\ncution ground. You can see the story here: \n\nhttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/a=\r\nbstract.html?res=3DFB0B10FA3F551A7493C0A81782D85F448784F9\n\n\nI have been liv=\r\ning in Yokohama for 4 years and was quite surprised to hear about \nthis ble=\r\nak part of Yokohama`s past.
