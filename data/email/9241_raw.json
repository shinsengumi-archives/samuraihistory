I have been discussing the actual existence/use of tetsubo with \nsome f=\r\nellow RPG players.\n\nTetsubo (&quot;iron staff&quot;?) are those big and heavy iron st=\r\nudded staves \noften seen in old samurai prints. They seem to have been popu=\r\nlar \nduring the Gempei war and/or Kamakura period. I have also read that \nt=\r\nhey were used as a kind of psychological weapon, to intimidate the \nenemies=\r\n with a &quot;big fu*king club&quot;. (I seem to remember that nodachi \nblades were a=\r\nlso used for a similar purpose, in later eras).\n\nAccording to another sourc=\r\ne found on the internet, the tetsubo was \nalso - and foremost - employed fr=\r\nom horseback (which surprised me, \nbecause I would have thought that a such=\r\n a weapon would be too \ncumbersome to be used effectively from the saddle),=\r\n so the wielder \ncould add the mount&#39;s momentum to his swing, for a truly d=\r\nevastating \nblow.\n\nI still wonder to what extent the tetsubos were actually=\r\n used on the \nbattlefield.\nWere they a common sight on the battlefield or w=\r\nere they limited \nto earlier historic periods and/or specific tactical purp=\r\noses? \nWere there a specific martial style associated with the tetsubo, suc=\r\nh \nas to allow something like basic parries, counterattacks or &quot;called \nsho=\r\nts&quot;, or their use was simple and straightforward (a- lift weapon; \nb- lower=\r\n weapon on enemy&#39;s head; 3- repeat from 1.)? They don&#39;t look \nlike they cou=\r\nld be used like a naginata, a bo staff or anything like \nthat.\n\nAny info on=\r\n the subject is appreciated.\nThanks.\n\n--\nC E Z\n\n\n"
