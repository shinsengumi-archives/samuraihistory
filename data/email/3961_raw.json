The true warrior must believe that his most\nimportant goal\n&gt; in life is to  serve others before himself. This is done by a man&#39;s\nadherance\n&gt; to a system of beliefs that he blankets with &quot;honor&quot; and holds more\nprecious\n&gt; than even life itself!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Yahoo!
