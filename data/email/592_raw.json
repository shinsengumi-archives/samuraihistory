I used your Sekigahara book as a guide when I\n&gt; walked the Sekigahara battlefield in 1999 during my in-country training as a\n&gt; Japan-focused US Army foreign area officer.  It was a lifesaver, especially\n&gt; since the local guidebooks and signs are not particularly &quot;gaijin friendly.&quot;\n&gt; Your other works are equally helpful, and a pleasure to read.\n&gt;\n\nThank you. My particular favorite is Sekigahara. Did you visit the &quot;Warland&quot;?\nSome nice armours, but some really cheesey statuary. &lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My MA thesis ended up being about the Japanese 1941-42 Centrifugal Offensive\n&gt; in the Southwest Pacific, but I hope to write on the Senkoku Jidai in the\n&gt; future.  Wouldn&#39;t object to putting together an Osprey book on the Imperial\n&gt; Japanese Army in the early 40s (Lord knows I&#39;ve got more than enough source\n&gt; material to do one!), but I suspect there&#39;s not much of an English-speaking\n&gt; audience for one . . .\n&gt;\n\nYou never know. &lt;G&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Keep on plugging--I can&#39;t wait for your thesis or your first academic work to\n&gt; come out!\n\nThanks. I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing them, too. &lt;G&gt;\n\nTony\n\n\n"
