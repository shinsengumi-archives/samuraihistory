Out there in SAMURAI WORLD? In Korea another\n&gt; dumb war, our unit \n&gt; or at least some of us in a B.J.U.were trained and\n&gt; worked with two \n&gt; Samurai in mind control and mental img. as we got to\n&gt; know each other \n&gt; we learned these men for the last few 100years came\n&gt; from people who \n&gt; were brought up from birth to do a job like most of\n&gt; us, they loved  \n&gt; each other and ladys also could control there minds\n&gt; to sit in winter \n&gt; cold water in nothing on but undergarments for an\n&gt; hour or more. They \n&gt; were probably good fighting men in the close arts of\n&gt; killing. but \n&gt; they were men like all of us no more no less do not\n&gt; make somthing out \n&gt; of them they were not? Kind of tunnel vis. like a\n&gt; monk with out being \n&gt; limited to a monk&#39;s life style.\n&gt;  2003 WOW! the guy that lives with out a car prob.\n&gt; lives inner city i \n&gt; have lot&#39;s on N.Y. friend&#39;s who have not had a car\n&gt; for 30 years do \n&gt; you think a Samurai would not ride a horse because\n&gt; it poops on the \n&gt; road? Or not get in a Jeep to go some were, or use\n&gt; some of our winter \n&gt; gear when cold? You sound like the people that went\n&gt; back to mother \n&gt; earth in the late 50 & 60 to live with out elec,\n&gt; grow, and kill there \n&gt; own food i was there what a joke that was.Most\n&gt; lasted about 2to3 \n&gt; weeks and a few 4to6months and back to MOM & DAD and\n&gt; $$$$.I work out \n&gt; with some people that you might call 2003 Samurai\n&gt; they make a liveing \n&gt; as body guards and teaching murk&#39;s. but when the go\n&gt; home they have a \n&gt; comp, car, lights, and mybe a Big Mack WOW! You\n&gt; should do what my son \n&gt; did when he was young, GO to CHINA and live at a\n&gt; monestery for a year \n&gt; to learn healing with herbal healing and\n&gt; understaning life. OR for \n&gt; the real SAMURAI out there go around the world as a\n&gt; pit fighter as \n&gt; some of my friends have. [Live the good life with\n&gt; honor and careing  \n&gt; and be true to your self we are not and can never be\n&gt; Samurai!  \n&gt; Remember reading is not doing it&#39;s the problem in\n&gt; the U.S. to much \n&gt; reading and liveing in ones mind, life is short go\n&gt; out and enjoy it.I \n&gt; lived in Hong K.for 2 years in the 50&#39;s never saw\n&gt; any of the \n&gt; Hollywood stuff that&#39;s out there.and very few\n&gt; have.In 50 Hong K. was \n&gt; china today it&#39;s a shopping mall how sad.     \n&gt; Cheers Joseph\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
