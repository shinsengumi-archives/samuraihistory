I too am a fan of \nthe samurai X/Rurouni Kenshin saga.  It seems to me that there \nis very little information about this period available (or maybe I \njust don&#39;t know where to look?).  But there is hope; NHK Japan \nhas announced a TV drama in production based on the \nShinsengumi.  It is projected for release sometime in 2004.  I&#39;m \nnot sure about a release to the US or on DVD but I&#39;m hopeful.  A \nrecently released film on the subject, by director Beat Takeshi \n(who also stars), is called &quot;Gonin&quot;.  Haven&#39;t seen the film myself \nbut have read some reviews of it.  \n\nBrandon\n\n--- In samuraihistory@y..., &quot;asstrotep&quot; &lt;asstrotep@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi...I&#39;ve been doing research on the Japanese Civil War \n&gt; (Bakumatsu)...i&#39;ve got a timeline of what went on, however, I&#39;m \nstuck \n&gt; on the groups and the alliances made, namely by the \nShinsengumi and \n&gt; Ishinshishi...also the battle statistics, the types of fighters (just \n&gt; Samurai or were the Hitokiri like in Rurouni Kenshin?), where \nbattles \n&gt; took place (is it just Edo and Kyoto?), I&#39;ve been looking for a \nsite \n&gt; or book that will provide all the iformation im looking for, with \n&gt; pictures and sketches. if anyone can help, it would be greatly \n&gt; appriciated...thank you\n\n\n\n"
