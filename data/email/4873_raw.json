Since the era name and date \nwas still clear I made a note out of it out of curiosity just to see \nhow old the thing was.  It was marked &quot;Jokyou 5&quot;.  So I went to my \ncomputer, used my handy-dandy era converter, and lo and behold, \nthe &quot;Jokyo&quot; era ended in the 4th year.  There was no &quot;Jokyou 5&quot;!  \nJokyo ended in the 4th year - 1687, and 1688 was the first year of \nGenroku.  So I was perplexed, and I asked around.  The answer was \nactually quite simple - islanders and other people in isolated \nvilages sometimes went 2 or 3 years before getting word that the era \nhad changed, and so during that time any headstones or stone lamps or \ntorii gates or other stone monuments that were created would be dated \nin the era the villagers THOUGHT it was.  So they apparently hadnt \ngotten word that the Jokyou era had ended and the Genroku era had \nbegan.  \n\nJust an interesting (well, I thought so, anyway) tidbit I came across \nduring my travels.\n\n\n"
