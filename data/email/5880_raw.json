Bryant\n\nIf you&#39;re using decent software, it *does* interject a marker. See the little\ndoohickies off to the left? That&#39;s because I&#39;m using Netscape. Other software\ndoes other things. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re using, but I notice that it doesn&#39;t\nwrap your messages, either. I have to do that. Fortunately, again, good software\nhas a &quot;rewrap&quot; feature to automatically take care of that. :)\n\n***** Outlook Express, the introverted version. I swear it&#39;s bi-  can&#39;t make up it&#39;s mind to do plain text or rich text. Yeah, I \nhave it set to reply in the format the mail is received, and I like messing with pretty fonts to my friends. Friggin&#39; mail program \nis bull-dookie, but it&#39;s the only one I know of that will let me monitor my different e-mail addresses in one place. It&#39;s like \nhaving a lazy husband....  who at least takes the garbage out once a month and doesn&#39;t pee on the floor. *******\n\n\n&gt; What sayeth the ListGods? How shall we do obeisance to Thy Wills?\n\n&lt;pedant&gt; &quot;Thy&quot; is singular, not plural. &lt;/pedant&gt;\n\n\nTony\n-- \n\n*****So, Lord Pedant,  where were you during Sunday school grammar?  I coulda used the help. And just what would be the correct \ntense?  I&#39;m too tired to look it up......... long day....   got home 0300 from work last night; did NOT see the &#39;we&#39;re sweeping the \nstreets today to don&#39;t park your butt here or we&#39;ll tow you&#39; signs....   both sons home from school with colds and I gotta go pay \nthe ransom at the impound lot.... and go to the SCA meeting....   humor me, please.....   go ahead and be a crank, but please humor \nme **********\n\nLizzie\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.786 / Virus Database: 532 - Release Date: 10/29/2004 \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
