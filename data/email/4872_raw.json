LOL. \n\nSo perhaps the \n&gt; real, ongoing cultural history of the country should\n&gt; be seen separately \n&gt; from the admiration of bushido which is more common\n&gt; among \n&gt; foreigners than among Japanese where, I suspect, it\n&gt; is seen as verging \n&gt; towards fascism.\n\nThis is an excellent point--&#39;samurai&#39; does not equal\n&#39;bushido&#39;. While there is an almost 1000 year old\nhistory of samurai/bushi culture to draw upon,\n&quot;Bushido&quot; as a codified system is only a few hundred\nyears old, and wasn&#39;t popularized until preWWII\nfascists got a hold of it. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!\nhttp://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/\n\n"
