There was\nno significant milarty event worthy of a record except\nfor one incidence when a low rank officer of Chosun\ndynasty scrared off some Japanese soldiers who shot\nmuskets for fun by shooting several arrows across the\nriver.\nI also don&#39;t remember seeing any movies on the Imjin\ncrossing although I was in Korea only until 1998.\n\n\n\n                            \n                         Sincerely,\n\n\n\n                         Changsub Lee\n\n\n--- burker1@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Does anyone know of any Samurai movies about the\n&gt; Imjin War, Japan&#39;s invasion \n&gt; of Korea in the 1590s?\n&gt; \n&gt; If so, where can I find a copy with English\n&gt; subtitles?  I live in the US \n&gt; (near San Francisco).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob Burke\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
