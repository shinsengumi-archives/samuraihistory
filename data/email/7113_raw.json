In this case for\nexample, say t=\r\nhat you are aware that Hayes&#39; word is, and let&#39;s be\ngenerous here &quot;unreliab=\r\nle&quot;, and that you do not know the other quoted\nsources, how the heck are yo=\r\nu then supposed to judge what these other\npeople say? I&#39;m sorry, if one of =\r\nyour sources is severely flawed and the\nothers are unknown to you, then you=\r\n have to ignore the lot. Unless of\ncourse you have the time to become an au=\r\nthority yourself. And let&#39;s face\nit most of us don&#39;t, so we have to make ju=\r\ndgements about the sources we\nhave access to. For example I don&#39;t speak or =\r\nread Japanese, which means\nthat I have to read a variety of English sources=\r\n just to make sure, that\na &quot;fact&quot; is generally supported by those who have =\r\n&quot;earned&quot; my respect.\nHayes and his supernatural, future viewing, PJ wearing=\r\n wonder warriors\nfirmly belongs in the land of &quot;wu-wu-yibble&quot;, not that of =\r\nthe rising\nsun!\n\nThere are images of history that become rooted in the popu=\r\nlar culture,\nwhich are quite simply, wrong. For example the commonly heard/=\r\nseen term\n&quot;chainmail&quot;. It doesn&#39;t make them right simply because a lot of p=\r\neople\ndon&#39;t know their history well enough, nor is it their fault. Ninja ar=\r\ne\none of these images, and it is down to students of history to popularise\n=\r\nthe &quot;truth&quot; (as far as we know it, that is).\n\n&gt;oh,by the way the \n&gt;    warr=\r\niors creed sure is a great thing to quote :)\n\nOh give me a break, for if by=\r\n the warrior&#39;s creed, you mean &quot;Bushido&quot;,\nyou need to get a grip, when real=\r\n warriors go to war, there&#39;s only two\nobjectives victory and survival. Deat=\r\nh before dishonour only applies\nwhen death and dishonour is guaranteed. The=\r\n &quot;way of the warrior&quot; belongs\nto the era of &quot;wasn&#39;t it wonderful way back w=\r\nhen&quot; and not to the age of\nbattles.\n\n&gt;    John Hidalgo &lt;oniyama@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:You know, even if Hayes is \n&gt;    on it, so is Manaka.=A0 Are you goin=\r\ng to \n&gt;    discount Manaka as well as Hayes.=A0 \n\nYep, but only because I d=\r\no not have a clue who Manaka is, see my\nstatement about sources above. And =\r\nno, I don&#39;t have the time to read\nhim, I have a backlog of books a mile hig=\r\nh and a seemingly equally long\ncue of students to teach.\n\n&gt;    I have an id=\r\nea.=A0 How about watching the video when it comes out (or \n&gt;    at least ge=\r\nt some reviews from a few people who have seen it) \n&gt;    before \n&gt;    outri=\r\nght dismissing it?=A0 I am sure that the people who produced \n&gt;    this \n&gt; =\r\n   video put a lot of time, energy, money and heart into it.=A0 I am \n&gt;    =\r\nsure \n&gt;    they did not go into that process merely to produce crap.=A0 Let=\r\n&#39;s \n&gt;    give it a chance.\n\nHello people, TV companies exist to make money,=\r\n not to make historically\naccurate documentaries, especially small outfits,=\r\n and even if their\nintentions were perfect, they probably can&#39;t afford to g=\r\net it right. You\nneed big bucks to take the time, and do the travelling, pa=\r\ny experts for\ninterviews etc. to get it anywhere near right. And unless thi=\r\ns is a big\nbudget, or a dilettante production with a rich patron with time =\r\nto\nspend, I don&#39;t hold out much hope for its academic rigor. I know how\nthe=\r\nse things go, I&#39;m about to do a tiny, tiny part in a god awful low\nbudget d=\r\nocumentary series of ten 60 minute programs for the Discovery\nChannel*, and=\r\n believe me accuracy is the last thing on the producer&#39;s\nmind. He wants it =\r\ncheap and he wants it last week! Many years ago I, for\nmy sins also did a t=\r\nhing for Channel 4, which was no better.\n\n*BTW the program isn&#39;t about hist=\r\nory, but speculative disaster\nscenarios, eek!\n\nNow if they had folks like V=\r\narley, Friday, Bottomley or our old pal\nTony, then maybe it would be worth =\r\nwatching.\n\nOkay I go hide from the ninja&#39;s wroth now:-)\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\nDe=\r\nan Wayland\nHead Of The Fight School\nhttp://www.thefightschool.demon.co.uk\n\n=\r\n\n"
