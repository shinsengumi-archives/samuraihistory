So\nI&#39;ll comment up here to the two specific points that I copied below:\n\nFirst, Why do you think that the main character reflects what a western view\nof a samurai should be? Was the director western? Was the scriptwriter\nwestern? I don&#39;t believe so. So what makes the viewpoint &quot;western&quot;?\n\nSecond, a ronin had (not &quot;has&quot;; we don&#39;t have any more ronin or samurai in\nthis present day) the right to commit seppuku, just as any member of the\nbushi class had. \n\nThe question involving the 47 Ako ronin who avenged their lord, then turned\nthemselves in, was a question that faced any samurai or commoner who\nperformed a vendetta without registering it first with the bakufu; doing a\nvendetta without registering it first was a criminal act in 1702 that would\nmerit execution as a common criminal. So the bakufu had to decide whether\nthe Ako ronin were to be executed as common criminals or allowed to go free\nor what the punishment should be. According to what I&#39;ve read, there was a\nsharp debate about this. A compromise was reached that the ronin had to die,\nbut instead of being executed as criminals, they would be allowed to die by\nseppuku. \n\nNina\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Michael Wood\nSent: Thursday, October 06, 2005 12:47 PM\nTo: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [samuraihistory] What can we define as the best samurai ???\n\n--- federico trejos &lt;federicotrejos@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Good afternoon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have anyone seen the last movie written by Akira\n&gt; Kurosawa : &quot;Ame Agaru&quot; ( After the Rain )???\n\n[snips]\n\nI love this movie, but the main character only reflects what a western view\nof a samurai should be.\n\n[snips]\n\n\n(ronin do not have the right to seppuku)\n\n[snip to end]\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nYahoo!
