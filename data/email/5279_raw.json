He wanted to replicate his\n&gt; greatest work but in \n&gt; keeping with the idea of not putting himself over\n&gt; his ancestors \n&gt; planned to finish it in silver instead of gold. \n&gt; As you point out though, many times it&#39;s the better\n&gt; story that ends \n&gt; up becoming the &quot;accepted history&quot;. \n\nThe Ginkakuji website states it was because he visited\nthe Rokuonji (the official name of the Kinkakuji) on\nan inspection and decided to copy the design. Mentions\nnothing about covering it in silver, which I still\nfind odd. When I can get on a computer that I can\nsearch in Japanese, I&#39;ll look more. I&#39;d just like to\nsee something besides Turnbull and &quot;every source I&#39;ve read&quot;...\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
