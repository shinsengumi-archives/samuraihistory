In 9/64 Craig (Choshu \nin the Meiji Restoration p312) says Saigo and Katsu discussed  the \nimpotence and temporising of the bakufu. Also I think all  the future \nMeiji leaders shared characteristics of flexibility, pragmatism, even \nopportunism which along with their undeniable physical and mental \ntoughness enabled them to survive the turbulent bakumatsu years \nwhen so many more stubborn and unyielding personalities went under.\n(see Craig. p 268)\n\nThere was a lot of confusion (understatement!) in the bakumatsu \nperiod and decisions were often made on emotional and instinctive \ngrounds. Craig quotes Ito Hirobumi: &quot;if one speaks logically of the \nthings (that happened then) they are impossible to understand...but \nemotionally it had to be that way.&quot; (op cit.p198)\n\n(rather like the argument that going to war should be like jumping off \nthe veranda.)\n\nPerhaps  Saigo&#39;s personality in the end proved too &quot;strong&quot; to be able \nto accommodate the drive to modernism of the Meiji government: \nhence his last stand as &quot;last samurai&quot; .\n&gt; Thank you for everything\n\nNo problem, I enjoy discussing these things, it helps me clarify my \nthoughts.\n\n and once more sorry for my English...\n\nDon&#39;t apologise for your English: it is brilliant.\n\nCheers,\n\nGillian\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"
