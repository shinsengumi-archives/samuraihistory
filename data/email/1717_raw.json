The\nintroduction=\r\n date has not been established; one source suggests 1874,\nwhich must be reg=\r\narded as doubtful - otherwise, the kyu-gunto would have\npreceded the 1877 p=\r\natterns. Dating to the end of the nineteenth century\nis more likely. \nEarly=\r\n examples are thought to have mass-produced blades but most\nsurvivors origi=\r\nnate from the Russo-japanese War (1904-5) and usually\ndisplay hand-forged o=\r\nr ancestral blades. They were carried until\nsuperseded by shin-gunto in the=\r\n early 1930s, though many senior officers\ncontinued to carry them during th=\r\ne Second World War. The hilts are\ngilt-finished brass with a small pierced =\r\nobverse guard of sakura (cherry\nblossom) design and a long, thin knucklebow=\r\n. The backstrap is wholly or\npartially engraved according to rank, a genera=\r\nl officers&#39; pattern\nincorporating a kiku or chrysanthemum blossom near the =\r\npommel. The grips\nare rough or polished white same (rayskin) or, in rare ca=\r\nses, tortoise-\nshell -normally confined to swords of field and generai offi=\r\ncers. Black\nsame is also sometimes found. Gilt-wire binding fills the grip =\r\ngrooves.\nHilts of extreme length can be found when traditional blades are\nu=\r\ntilised. They are retained by a removable bamboo peg, the mekugi, which\npas=\r\nses through the blade tang. Swords with mass- produced blades have\nshorter =\r\nhilts that may be removed by unscrewing the pommel-top nut in\nthe same mann=\r\ner as a &#39;parade sabre&#39;. A few hand-forged blades have been\nfound with tangs=\r\n tapered and threaded far this kind of fixing. A\ndecorated press stud with =\r\na spring clip, set in the fuchi (collar),\nengages a slot in the scabbard mo=\r\nuth to retain the sword. Secondary\nretention by means of a leather strap an=\r\nd press studs is also found. The\nmetal scabbards are painted or nickel or c=\r\nhromium-plated, and have wood\nliners. A second (lower) ashi or suspension m=\r\nount, when present, is\nnormally removable; a slot on the top of the mount s=\r\nlides aver the\nscabbard shoe. Contemporary photographs seem to indicate tha=\r\nt the\ntwo-ashi sty/e was used with the two-sling full dress sword belt, whi=\r\nle\nthe one-ashi fitting was confined to the service belt with its single\nha=\r\nnger of chain or leather. Non-commissioned officers carried a similar\nsword=\r\n with plain brass mounts, the backstrap often lacking the side\nears. Mass- =\r\nproduced blades and painted metal scabbards are prevalent.\nThere are many v=\r\nariations of this sword pattern, differing largely in\nquality of fittings a=\r\nnd the amount of decoration.\n...unquote.\nAs you can read, still remain a go=\r\nod possibility to have found an\nancestral blade, but more details are neede=\r\nd.\n\n\n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: Scott Moore [mailto:sgmoore@...=\r\n] \nInviato: marted=EC 6 maggio 2003 4.28\nA: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n=\r\nOggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword\n\nCarlo,\n\n  Take a look at =\r\nthe photo of the tang that I posted.

You truly have a treasure =\r\nin\nyour \n      possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have i=\r\nt\n      professionally \n      cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that c=\r\nurrently exist on the\n    blade\n\n      mean little in comparison to the bla=\r\nde itself.  If you do manage\nto\n    get\n      it \n      cleaned and polishe=\r\nd you should also get it placed into a\nShirasaya.\n        Bear in mind that=\r\n this is not a cheap or fast process.\n  Professional\n\n      polishers are v=\r\nery backlogged and very expensive.  It could take\ntwo\n      years \n      an=\r\nd $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It\nwill\n      ke=\r\nep \n      any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.\n   =\r\n     I hope this helped you.\n\n\n      Peace,\n\n      Matt\n\n      ____________=\r\n_____________________________________________________\n      The new MSN 8: =\r\nsmart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \n      http://join.msn.com/?page=\r\n=3Dfeatures/junkmail\n\n\n\n      Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives=\r\n.com\n      ---\n      To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    =\r\n  samuraihistory-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\n      Your use of Yahoo!
