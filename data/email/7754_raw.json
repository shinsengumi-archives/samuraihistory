He changed his name further into Takada Genbe. \n\nHe was short, his jaw and cheekbone was sharp. He was always calm \nand he was unyielding. And, he was very gentle.\n\nThough He was born in Komori Family in Kumamoto, he became a foster-\nchild of Kawakami Family, and became a Buddhist priest. (When there \nwas a big earthquake and all people were running away, he \nextinguished the fire of a brazier, and he was accepted by many \npeople. It was said that it was regrettable that He&#39;s a Buddhist. \nBuddhist priest&#39;s position was convenient to study. Then, a study of \nthe soldier was learned by Miyabe Teizo, and literature and \nswordsmanship were learned by Todoroki Muhe. He didn&#39;t get the \npermission of his clan though he tried to do overseas inspection to \nknow the circumstance of foreign countries. If a foreign \ncircumstance can&#39;t be known, he thought that he should exile a \nforeigner from Japan, and he recommended the thought of &quot;Sonno-jyoi\n(Reverence for the Emperor and expulsion of the foreigner)&quot;. Then, \nhe fought to overthrow the shogunate together with &quot;shishi of kinno&quot; \nwhich his mind was suitable for. Though he killed many people, a \nclear record about his assassination does not exist. (The incident \nthat a Sakuma Syouzan was assassinated at midday is famous.) Then, \nmany battles were finished, and He succeeded in overthrowing the \nshogunate admirably. However, he became bothering existence for new \ngovernment because his thought wasn&#39;t changed after the Restoration.\n(The government completely changed a policy suddenly.) Then, he was \nkilled by the follower of &quot;Kido Takayoshi&quot; who was gensai&#39;s company. \nAt this time, he didn&#39;t have the crime which was worth the death \npenalty.\n  \n\nhttp://www.sword.ne.jp/swordsmen/bushi/gensai.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
