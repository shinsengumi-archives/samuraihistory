As a film it may be &gt;great\nentertainment, as history it is an insult to &gt;the\nsubject and the audience.\n\nTom-\nThis was my fear as well, unfortunately, I&#39;m not as\ninformed with this aspect of japanese history as I&#39;d\nlike to be, so seeing the movie, I wouldn&#39;t be able to\nconclude much on the historical accuracy.  Now if an\nindependant company had produced this, maybe I would\nhave had a bit more faith.\n \nPaul-\nWas the Christopher Nicol trilogy really good?
