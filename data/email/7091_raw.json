This group can be a very productive and above all interlectual experience. Unfortunatly if like me you make the odd grammatical error you can also be corrected, which can be a little insulting. In all this is a productive group to be a part of and although I havent posted in a while I always enjoy reading the regulars opinions. I myself moderate on a huge gamingg forum and it can be a little frustrating, but all in all this is a cool group as long as we all stay on subject.....\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi all\n&gt; \n&gt; the one thing I hate about mail list and forums is\n&gt; because people are sat at keypoards and not\n&gt; discussing\n&gt; face to face, then there is a tenancy to be very\n&gt; insulting and offensive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even moderators can get rude at times, some time a I\n&gt; think taking their position as an excuse.\n\nAnd the one thing this moderator hates is people who\nhide in the herd. Especially when I&#39;ve asked, offline,\nfor you to list any insults I&#39;ve directed at you, and\nI&#39;ve tried, repeatedly, to clarify anything you were\nmisreading. And now, I get publicly threatened on the\nlist. See below: \n\nSomeone who once insult me on the web\n&gt; then\n&gt; got a shock some time later when I introduced my\n&gt; self.\n&gt; The shock was because they thought they were very\n&gt; safe\n&gt; insulting me 3000 miles away from where I live from\n&gt; them. They were not keen at all to insult me then.\n\n*snip* \n\n&gt; I just think we should all be aware that we may one\n&gt; day meet and it may not be too friendly due to our\n&gt; behaviour.\n\nThis is very junior high school. I&#39;d think a 36 year\nold would be above that. \n\n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nYahoo! Mail Mobile \nTake Yahoo! Mail with you!
