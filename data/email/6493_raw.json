In an \namusing scroll, a 17th century samurai impresses passing women by \nshowing off the hawk perched on his sleeve while Mount Fuji towers \nin the background. \n \n     Three centuries later, presidential candidates posture as \nregular guys by duck hunting or attending NASCAR. \n \n     The exhibit&#39;s several large folding screens on the subject of \nfalconry combine revelatory beauty with subtle social observation. \n \n     The samurai&#39;s powerful identification with the solitary hunters \nbecomes obvious. \n \n     In a 17th century six-panel folding screen, &quot;Hawk Eagle in a \nPine Tree,&quot; the winged subject&#39;s glinting eye and curved beak, \ncaptured in remarkable detail with ink on paper, stare down on \nviewers, conveying an impression of unquestionable authority. \n \n     &quot;Samurai used falconry as a way to reinforce their position as \nthe dominant political force,&quot; Morse said. \n \n     One can only wonder whether ordinary citizens regarded samurai, \nlike the winged hunters they admired, as merciless exemplars of \nnatural law. Rather than focus exclusively on falcons, the exhibit \nincludes art featuring eagles, goshawks and other hunting birds to \nexamine the changing roles samurai played in Japanese society. \n \n     The word &quot;samurai&quot; means &quot;those who serve&quot; and originally \nreferred to a military caste that adhered to a strict code of \nloyalty, courage and cultivation of traditional arts. \n \n     Starting around the 12th century, samurai served large \nlandowners called daimyos. After the feudal system was abolished in \n1869 and Japan was united under a military leader or shogun, samurai \nwere reduced to ceremonial roles as reminders of a heroic past. \n \n     The samurai&#39;s changing role from fighters to highly regarded \ncivil servants can be seen through the evolution of their body armor \nfrom purely functional equipment to largely ceremonial suits. \n \n     Once samurai had no more wars to fight, Morse said, they used \nrituals and art associated with falconry to cultivate an image of \nrefined strength. \n \n     As war became a thing of the past, Morse said extended falcon \nhunts became both &quot;outlets&quot; for martial energy and ceremonies that \nconfirmed loyalty and status. \n \n     A finely wrought fan is decorated with a scene of a royal hunt \nfrom the classic novel &quot;The Tale of the Genji&quot; by Lady Murasaki. A \nfabulously detailed horizontal painting, &quot;Horse Racing at Kato \nShrine,&quot; depicts several levels of Japanese life with the subdued \ncomplexity reminiscent of Flemish master Pieter Bruegel. \n \n     The exhibit reveals Japan&#39;s ability to absorb and refine \nactivities and art borrowed from Asian neighbors. \n \n     According to the informative wall , falconry came to Japan from \nKorea in the sixth century. Chinese scroll painting was adapted by \nJapanese artists who changed the proportions to suit homes where \npeople sat on floor mats rather than chairs. \n \n     Morse observed both exhibits record the samurai&#39;s changing \nworld in times of relative peace when they used valued objects like \nswords and hunting birds to assert the status their forebears earned \nduring the brutal civil wars of the past. \n \n     After social reforms restricted falconry to the imperial family \nin the late 19th century, great hunting birds remained potent \nsymbols in new art forms. \n \n     The exhibit includes a striking sculpted bronze eagle with a \nsilver patina given to the emperor in 1917. \n \n     Over time, images of hunting birds that once adorned samurai \narmor were used to decorate gowns worn by merchants and courtesans. \n \n     At its best, &quot;Pursuits of Power&quot; provides aesthetic thrills and \nhistorical insights. \n \n     The gold-dappled, six-panel folding screen &quot;Goshawk Mews&quot; \nreveals the splendor of imperial Japan. At the height of the Edo \nperiod, a yellow-eyed hawk soars down upon a raccoon. In a charming \n19th century woodblock print, a child cries when his hawk-shaped \nkite becomes entangled in a tree. \n \n     One of Japan&#39;s greatest warriors, Tokugawa Ieyasu, said &quot;a true \nsamurai must do more than act courageously in the heat of the \nmoment. The Way of the Warrior is fully achieved in times of peace \nas well as times of conflict.&quot; \n \n     This exhibit offers informed glimpses into both worlds. \n \n     The Essentials: \n \n     The exhibit &quot;Pursuits of Power&quot; is on view through June \n13. &quot;Lethal Elegance&quot; is open through Sept. 26. \n \n     Open seven days a week, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is \nopen Saturday through Tuesday, 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.; and Wednesday \nthrough Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:45 p.m. On Thursday and Friday after 5 \np.m., only the West Wing is open. \n \n     General admission (which includes two visits in a 30-day \nperiod) is $15 for adults, $13 for senior citizens and students 18 \nand above, and free for children 17 and under when school is not in \nsession. \n \n     For general visitor information, call 617-267-9300 or visit the \nWeb site, www.mfa.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
