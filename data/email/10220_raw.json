Only traditionally made Japanese swords are allowed in Japan. It is the law. Particularly, as a non-Japanese you do not want to contravene this law. All Japanese swords must be licensed. Your swords do not meet the licensing requirements, so would be designated as offensive weapons. \n\n&gt; To: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: veritas.quest@...\n&gt; Date: Fri, 30 Jul 2010 11:47:25 +0000\n&gt; Subject: [samuraihistory] OFF TOPIC\n&gt; \n&gt; To anyone in the group who lives in Japan. Ihave a chance to become employed at a english language school in Japan Iam curious as to how they treat Gaijin and what to expect?
