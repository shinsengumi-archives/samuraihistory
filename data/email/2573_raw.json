I \nbelieve that with the interest at hand,  we can consider this the founding of a \nsubgroup specifically on Japanese Arms and Armour.   Since there is so much in \nmuseums on these subjects,  like the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the \nVictoria and Albert Museum in London,  I think we have a precedent here.  \nSpeaking of armor, you  can&#39;t beat the two books by H.  Russell Robinson,  \nOriental Armor and   Japanese Arms and Armor.  They have stood the passage of time as \n splendid chronicles of the Age of the Country at War.  Japanese Arms and \nArmor is--of and in itself--a work of art!  I extend a courteous invitation to \nTom Helm and to Donovan to bring their research to the attention of the group.  \nAnd as Tom Bodett said about Motel 6,  &quot;we&#39;ll leave the light on for ya.&quot;  \nLater and greater,   Jack Murphy\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"
