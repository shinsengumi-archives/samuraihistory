However, just because you want \nJapanese tents does not mean that the historical Japanese are going to \nhave done much if anything to oblige you. Japan is 90% mountainous and \nhas, to the best of my knowledge, never supported a particularly \nnomadic or otherwise pastoral culture. There is even reason to believe \nthat the Jomon Jidai hunter gatherers were essentially sedentary. Such \npeople have relatively little reason to embrace tents. This is \nespecially true when you realize that much of Japan was thickly \nforested.\n\n\n\n\n"
