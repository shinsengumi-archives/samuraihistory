S=\r\no this contest works wonders for this. And I liked the different categories=\r\n. And you gave plenty of notice as far as deadlines.\n\nSuggestions: \n\n1) Cla=\r\nrify the issue about stories that are sequels or prequels to an author&#39;s pr=\r\nevious contest story. Either allow such stories, as long as the prequel/seq=\r\nuel can stand completely as an independent story. Or else make a rule that =\r\na writer cannot write a story about any character who was in any of his/her=\r\n previous years&#39; entries.\n\n2) You might want to allow a writer to enter mor=\r\ne than one story, as long as each of an entrant&#39;s stories are in a differen=\r\nt category.  \n\n3) I would make at least a suggestion that, as this is the &quot;=\r\nSAMURAI Fiction Contest&quot;, that the main character of any story actually be =\r\na samurai. Or else, if the POV character isn&#39;t a samurai, that the story ce=\r\nnters on some sort of samurai character. I realize that in earlier eras of =\r\nJapanese history, that samurai didn&#39;t exist as a distinct, separate class. =\r\nSo for these stories, it should center on a person who would perform a role=\r\n that a samurai would perform i.e. fight in battles or studies a martial ar=\r\nt.\n\nJust a few comments and suggestions. These contests are a lot of fun an=\r\nd I look forward to the 2007 Samurai Fiction Competition.\n\nNina Boal \n\n----=\r\n-Original Message-----\nFrom: samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com [mailto:samurai=\r\nhistory@yahoogroups.com] \nSent: Thursday, May 04, 2006 7:36 AM\nTo: samuraih=\r\nistory@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [samuraihistory] Samurai Fiction 2007\n\nI am=\r\n in the tentative stages of planning the third annual Samurai Fiction conte=\r\nst for 2007.
