What I was looking \nfor is whether the Emperor ever formally rescinded the title of Shogun \nfrom Yoshiaki?\n\nI found this site on the web (in Japanese)\nhttp://homepage1.nifty.com/heiankyo/yomo19.html\nand others, which indicate that Yoshiaki&#39;s title was never stripped \nfrom him.\n\nDoes anyone have any other documentation (primary or otherwise) \nabout this?\n\nIt&#39;s often stated that the end of the Muromachi Shogunate came in \n1573, and this is probably true de facto. But it&#39;s interesting to me \nthat Yoshiaki lived on until 1597s and he was in fact the \n&quot;de jure&quot; Shogun for the entire time.\n\n--\nJay Kelly\noyakata@...\n\n"
