A koku is a fraction \n&gt;    over 180\n&gt;    &gt;litres of rice or =\r\nabout 300 pounds in weight. \n&gt;\n&gt;    In much of Japan (except the region imm=\r\nediately around Kyoto) the \n&gt;    assessment in the Sengoku was in kandaka, =\r\nwhich is to say in money \n&gt;    terms rather than rice. I&#39;m still digging in=\r\nto the story of the \n&gt;    transition to the kokudaka system, which took pla=\r\nce under \n&gt;    Hideyoshi.\n&gt;\n&gt;    &gt;Will Adams, the first\n&gt;    &gt;Englishman in=\r\n Japan, in a letter dated 1611 recounted that he and \n&gt;    his\n&gt;    &gt;crew w=\r\nere each given an income of &quot;2 pounds of rice a day&quot;, which \n&gt;    is 2.4\n&gt; =\r\n   &gt;koku a year. \n&gt;\n&gt;    There was a difference between one&#39;s kokudaka and =\r\nincome. The \n&gt;    kokudaka was the nominal productive capacity of the fief,=\r\n while the \n&gt;    tax revenues varied but were usually around 30% to 40% of =\r\nthe \n&gt;    kokudaka. If you were a low-ranked stipendiary rather than a \n&gt;  =\r\n  fief-holder your stipend might be reckoned in hyo of 0.35 koku, so \n&gt;    =\r\nthat a man with a stipend of 100 hyo actually received 35 koku \n&gt;    (when =\r\nnot required to make a &quot;loan&quot; to his daimyo or shogun). \n&gt;    Generally, on=\r\ne whose stipend was stated in koku rather than hyo had \n&gt;    higher status,=\r\n but got no more. That is, a stipend of 100 koku \n&gt;    would bring in about=\r\n the same net income as one of 100 hyo.\n&gt;\n&gt;    According to _Learning from =\r\nShogun_, William Adams (he never called \n&gt;    himself &quot;Will&quot;, noble a name =\r\nthough it be) held a fief with a \n&gt;    kokudaka of 250 koku, comprising the=\r\n villiage of Hemimura in what \n&gt;    is today Yokusuka. This was quite a sub=\r\nstantial property and \n&gt;    implies a certain dignity to his station. Indee=\r\nd, there is reason \n&gt;    to believe that he wore the two swords of the samu=\r\nrai, although he \n&gt;    almost certainly was not regarded as a samurai per s=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt;    &gt;IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income exceeding\n&gt;    &gt;1=\r\n,000 koku, \n&gt;\n&gt;    No. It is reckoned that the greatest number of shogunal =\r\nhousemen \n&gt;    had stipends of only 30 to 70 hyo. Needless to say, this mea=\r\nnt \n&gt;    miserable poverty unless one found other ways to augment it. In \n&gt;=\r\n    1700 in Okayama han, 93 samurai were recorded as having less than \n&gt;   =\r\n 10 hyo, and in 1840-44 there were more than 1,000 with less than 20 \n&gt;    =\r\nhyo. It was quite impossible to live on less than 10 hyo (3.5 koku \n&gt;    of=\r\n rice income) and impossible to do more than merely subsist on \n&gt;    less t=\r\nhan 20 -- all these men had to find some way of supplementing \n&gt;    their i=\r\nncomes quite substantially. In some rural han, stipends as \n&gt;    low as 4 h=\r\nyo equivalent were recorded, although it is thought that \n&gt;    these were m=\r\nen with only nominal samurai duties who really were \n&gt;    farmers.\n&gt;\n&gt;    A=\r\n swordsmith (who was not a samurai, of course) might have 100 hyo, \n&gt;    an=\r\nd other valued specialist craftsmen often got 50 or more.\n&gt;\n&gt;    &gt;while the=\r\n richest daimyo in the land Tokugawa Ieyasu, the\n&gt;    &gt;first of the Edo era=\r\n shogun&#39;s had an income of over 4 million koku \n&gt;    a\n&gt;    &gt;year!\n&gt;\n&gt;    T=\r\nhis was Iyasu&#39;s kokudaka, not his income. Recall that the entire \n&gt;    dire=\r\nct expense of the bakufu was borne out of the shogun&#39;s lands, \n&gt;    since h=\r\ne received no tax revenues from the han. Thus his kokudaka \n&gt;    was not so=\r\n munificent as might seem.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Will O&#39;Neil\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    [Non-text portio=\r\nns of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    ---\n&gt;    Samurai Archives:=\r\n http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt;    Samurai Archives store: http://www.ca=\r\nfeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt;    --- \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Yahoo!
