Too\nmany times on this board we hear people asking or\ntalking about things that are FICTION like it&#39;s real.\nPeople have idealized visions of samurai and\ncomic-book perceptions of ninja. If people read more\nscholarly works on the subjects a lot of these\nmisconceptions would be avoided. Starting with the\nbooks by Anthony Bryant and Stephen Turnbull would\nhelp, especially as they are easy reads. \n\nI don&#39;t mean to put down Samurai X or anime--I know\nmany people are fans, and I quite like Samurai X. I\nthink it is extremely well done. But even Kurosawa has\nhistorical flaws (i.e. the Nagashino scene in\nKagemusha). \n\n--- Talon11339@... wrote:\n&gt; It may be an Anime, but it is a historical fiction. \n&gt; The OAV Samurai X is \n&gt; quite factual, but the series of Kenshin is more\n&gt; towards the speculative \n&gt; fiction side.  Please keep that in mind before\n&gt; dismissing what is said in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"
