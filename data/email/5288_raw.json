I don&#39;t expect to be able to contribute\n&gt; &gt; very much as, quite frankly, most of you guys seem\n&gt; &gt; WAY out of my league.\n&gt;\n&gt; Heh, we talk a good game...seriously, most of us here\n&gt; are amateurs who read a lot. Feel free to jump in\n&gt; anytime!\n&gt;\n&gt;  If\n&gt; &gt; Kublai Khans invasion force had not been destroyed\n&gt; &gt; by the &quot;Divine wind&quot; in 1281. Who and why do you\n&gt; &gt; think would have emerged victorious, the Mongols or\n&gt; &gt; the Japanese ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Good question.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have thought about this a good deal\n&gt; &gt; and I think It would have been the Japanese, mainly\n&gt; &gt; because of the Mongols not being able to maintain a\n&gt; &gt; supply line. On the other hand, apart from a\n&gt; &gt; relatively minor clash in 1221, there had been no\n&gt; &gt; real warfare in Japan since the Gempei war. Where as\n&gt; &gt; the Mongols were battle hardened. However, I am sure\n&gt; &gt; this is all very open to debate. Any takers?\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Mongol supply lines: The Mongols sure were not\n&gt; seamen, but neither were the samurai. Apart from a\n&gt; handful of pirates, most Japanese didn&#39;t venture into\n&gt; the water, and &quot;sea battles&quot;, even Dannoura, etc.,\n&gt; were merely land battles fought on boats. Crash into\n&gt; the enemy, hop aboard, take his head...not much\n&gt; seamanship involved (Yeah yeah, tides at Dannoura,\n&gt; whatever...it was no Trafalgar).\n&gt;\n&gt; Being as the Mongols relied on Korean and Chinese who\n&gt; had much more sailing experience than either the\n&gt; Mongols or the Japanese, I think it&#39;s conceivable they\n&gt; could have maintained their supply lines. If they\n&gt; could transport supplies 1,000&#39;s of miles between\n&gt; China and Poland, I don&#39;t think the Strait of Tsushima\n&gt; was that difficult for them.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Lack of Japanese combat since 1221...\n&gt;\n&gt; In individual combat, this wasn&#39;t a problem. The\n&gt; Japanese matched up quite well, once they realized\n&gt; that shouting their lineage to a foe who didn&#39;t\n&gt; understand it was just making them vulnerable to\n&gt; archers. The problem wasn&#39;t so much lack of\n&gt; experience, it was lack of experience in the KIND of\n&gt; warfare the Mongols fought. I don&#39;t think the army of\n&gt; Minamoto Yoshitsune would have done well in a pitched\n&gt; battle against Mongol armies. I really don&#39;t think\n&gt; anyone would have had a chance until the Sengoku\n&gt; period. Japanese simply didn&#39;t fight in organized\n&gt; formations, reacting to signals, etc., like the\n&gt; Mongols did. Had the Mongols been able to land in\n&gt; force and establish a coherent beachhead, the course\n&gt; of history would be very different. Of course, you\n&gt; have to look at the fact that much of the &quot;mongol&quot;\n&gt; army were Korean and Chinese conscripts who had no\n&gt; desire to be there, and wouldn&#39;t have been all that\n&gt; effective, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that a Mongol\n&gt; army would have had it&#39;s way with an equivalent\n&gt; samurai army in a pitched battle on open terrain.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. HOWEVER...as Kusunoki Masashige would prove 50\n&gt; years later, the Japanese could adapt to guerrila\n&gt; warfare very easily. The Mongols would have found it\n&gt; very hard to garrison Japan, and wouldn&#39;t have ever\n&gt; had a true hold on it, I believe. Their usual\n&gt; techniques of razing the main cities would only harden\n&gt; Japanese resistance against them. Think Mongols =\n&gt; Russians, Japanese = Afghans.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New and Improved Yahoo!
