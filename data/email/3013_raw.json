I only\nhad a minute to flip through it, but it looks like Oda Nobunaga had\n26 children.  I only know about 13--\n\nNobutada\nNobuo\nTokuhime (wife of Tokugawa Nobuyasu)\nTouyama-Bunin [adopted] (Wife of Takeda Katsuyori)\nFuyuhime (Wife of Gamou Ujisato)\nHidekatsu\nKatsunaga\nNagatsugu\nNobukatsu\nNobutaka (Died 1602)\nGyokusen-in (Wife of Maeda Toshinaga)\nNobutaka (2 sons named Nobutaka)\nHideko (AKA Nichiei) (Wife of Tsutsui Sadatsugu)\n\nDoes anyone know anything about the other 13 children of Nobunaga?&quot;\n\n\nSaigen Nihonshi Vol. 19 page 39 lists 23 children, 11 boys and 12 girls.\nRekishi Gunzo series # 1 page says 24 kids (12 boys and 12 girls) but gives\nno names. It also mentions on the following page that Nobunaga himself was\none of  24 children and does list his brothers and sisters). One thing I\nhave noticed is that some books get confused between real children and\nadopted children hence the various numbers. Anyway the children listed in\nSaigen Nihonshi not on your list are:\n\nNobuhide\nNobuyoshi (spelled 信吉)\nNobusada\nNobuyoshi (spelled 信好)\nNagatsugu\n\nthe list goes on with several &#39;onna&#39;\nmarried to Takigawa Kazumasa\nm. Niwa Nagashige\nm. Hideyoshi\nm. Mizuno Tadatane\nm. Kanpaku Nijo Akizane\nm. Madenokouji Mitsufusa\nm. Tokudaiji Sanefuyu\nm. Takeda Shingen\n\n\n\n\n\n"
