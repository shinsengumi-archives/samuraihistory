I have been looking through \nsomethings a=\r\nnd have a question.  I don&#39;t think this has been asked but \nI could be wron=\r\ng.  What did the samurai do for entertainment?  I \nunderstand plays, writin=\r\ng, poetry, and training.  However, these \ncontrast in some ways with the ch=\r\naracter of a warrior culture.  Is \nthere anything else they would have used=\r\n to be entertaied?  Shogi, for \ninstance, or something of this nature would=\r\n make sense.  It is \nessentially chess.  However, the reason I ask is that =\r\nan archaeologist \nonce said to understand a culture look at how they entert=\r\nained \nthemselves.\n\n\n\n\n"
