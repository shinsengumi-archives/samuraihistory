There seems to be a lot of conflicting \n&gt; information on Dousan. This &quot;Two Generation Theory&quot; (\u001b$BFsBe@b\u001b(B) is \ngainin\n&gt; g more momentum recently, I think. The common knowledge about \n&gt; Dousan, while older are more established, is likely to be wrong, in \n&gt; my opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;(A quick and easy translation from Japanese - \u001b$B@o9q;~Be\u001b(B by \u001b$B6bC+=SlO\u001b(B\n&gt; &gt;2003 p.50-51)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot;Saito Dousan&#39;s father Shinzaemonjou\n&gt; This is likely to be Shinzaemon-no-jou, but it can be very hard to \n&gt; be sure.\n\n(Your Japanese didnt come out in the post for me, but anyway) that \noccured to me, but the furigana was included, and left out the &#39;no&#39; \nfor: &#26032;&#24038;&#34907;&#38272;&#23561;\n\n\n&gt; &gt;at this time was known as Nagai Shinkurou Norihide, succeeded his \n&gt; Dousan had a ton of names. If you are looking at this one, \u001b$BD9f?76eO\u001b(B&gt; \u001b$BMx@/\u001b(B, it would be Norimasa, not Norihide\n\n\nThis is clearly Norihide, and has the furigana to prove it :D &#35215;&#31168;\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Is it too much to ask for an english source or two??  :P\n&gt; It probably is - which is, I would guess, why you make the English \n&gt; sources. :) But if you put &quot;dosan oil father&quot; (without the quotes) \n&gt; into Google, a few sites pop up, including this one:\n&gt; http://www.sengoku-expo.net/text/person/E/054.html\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;However the history book I&#39;m reading seems to be saying that his \n&gt; &gt;father was Nagai Shinzaemon, and I cant find any other sources to \n&gt; &gt;confirm or deny this, or the fact that it was dousan&#39;s father, and \n&gt; &gt;not dousan himself who was the oil merchant. \n&gt; \n&gt; This is probably because historians (as a group) are in the middle \nof \n&gt; revising the accepted theory. Just give it about 10 years or so and \n&gt; things should be settled by then. :)\n\n\nAnd I was hoping to put together a Dousan biography today... :( Guess \nI could make it complicated and cover the different theories...\n\n\n&gt; For now I personally am convinced of the Two Generation Theory, but \n&gt; unfortunately they don&#39;t make me the arbitor of these things....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Jay Kelly\n&gt; oyakata@O...\n\n\n"
