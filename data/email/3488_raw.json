I&#39;ve been watching it \noff and on for about a year now.  Mitokomo is probably the most \nfamous period drama on Japanese television.  It is very interesting \nand I&#39;ve made several observances.  It is obviously set in the Edo \nJidai.  They have had 3 or 4 different series of the show, marked by \ndifferent actors playing the important roles.  Mitokomo himself is \nvery important.  And his importance is what I am trying to figure \nout.  They pull out his seal at the end of every show and say, &quot;Kono \nmon dokoro ga mei ne hairanuka?&quot;.  Translation something like: Can \nyour eyes not see this mark?  It is the Tokugawa Mon.  So is Mitokomo \none of the Tokugawa Shoguns or just a high level retainer? If he is \none of the Tokugawa Shoguns, which one is he?  \n\nBrandon\n\n\n\n\n\n"
