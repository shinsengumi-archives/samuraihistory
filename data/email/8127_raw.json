His sumi-e is very good \nif you like the free Zen styles. His book is at least interesting in \nEnglish. Haven&#39;t read it in the original. The Taiga drama was good as well.\n\n&gt;   From: &quot;Sensei J.

If I gave the impression the \nebooks= self-published I apologize since I often read academic journals \nonline which are probably as far away from self-published as you can get \nin terms of handling.\n\nJim Eckman\n\n"
