I hope i am making sense. Look forw=\r\nanrd to your response. Thank You.\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:  Rod--\n\nDon&#39;t take this the wrong way, but there&#39;s quite a\ndifference be=\r\ntween &quot;Give me info about fires in Edo\nand the Yoshiwara&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m specific=\r\nally interested in\nthe fire of 1861&quot;. It helps unbelievably to be\nspecific =\r\nin what your question is. I was mildly\nannoyed that you said you&#39;d looked a=\r\nnd couldn&#39;t find\nanything, when a simple Google search came up with a\nton o=\r\nf sites (admittedly, mostly scanty info like\nWikipedia, but still). However=\r\n, if you&#39;re looking for\na specific fire at a specific date, that changes\nth=\r\nings quite a bit. \n\nGood luck, not sure I&#39;ve got anything that can help\nyou=\r\n with your specific question. \n\n\n\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n\n&gt; Hi Nate:\n&gt;   First of all let me thank you for your answer but\n&gt; I thin=\r\nk I should have been more specific about my\n&gt; question regarding the fires =\r\nof the Yoshiwara. Yes I\n&gt; am aware of the great fire of 1657 I have found\n&gt;=\r\n information on that part of the history but there\n&gt; were also fires during=\r\n the late nineteenth century\n&gt; one of them I believe occured in the year 18=\r\n61. You\n&gt; see it has much harder finding that sort of\n&gt; information but if =\r\nyou Nate or anyone else has or\n&gt; knows of where I can find that information=\r\n I would\n&gt; be most grateful.\n&gt;   Rod\n&gt; Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Rod Pavez &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello ev=\r\neryone:\n&gt; &gt; Not long ago I posted a question about the fires\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; the Y=\r\noshiwara or \n&gt; &gt; pleasure quarter of the city of Tokyo. I really\n&gt; &gt; wanted=\r\n to know if \n&gt; &gt; someone has information regarding the historical\n&gt; &gt; timel=\r\nine of those \n&gt; &gt; fires.
