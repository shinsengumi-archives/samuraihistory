The audience was ex=\r\npected to admire the virtuoso\nchoreography and bravura turns, while ignorin=\r\ng the absence of blood,\njust as they would at a Kabuki play. \n\nNow the samu=\r\nrai movie and its variants are back, but the model has\nchanged. Films like =\r\nHiroyuki Nakano&#39;s &quot;Red Shadow,&quot; Hideyuki\nHirayama&#39;s &quot;Makai Tensho (Samurai =\r\nResurrection)&quot; and Ryuhei Kitamura&#39;s\n&quot;Azumi&quot; are closer to video games than=\r\n Kabuki or ballet. The fighters\nhave highly distinct powers, costumes and p=\r\nhysiques, but little depth\n-- they are types, not individuals. The story is=\r\n a series of fight\nscenes, with the supporting players falling by the waysi=\r\nde (or\nvanishing into a clouds of pixels), until only the hero and the lead=\r\ner\nof the bad guys are left to duel it out. The ending, unlike the final\n&quot;b=\r\noss&quot; stage of a game, is a foregone conclusion.\n\nTen Shimoyama&#39;s &quot;Shinobi,&quot;=\r\n with its story of two warring ninja clans\nin the early days of the Tokugaw=\r\na era, follows this game formula --\nbut with differences that make it a cut=\r\n above the genre run. A\nking-of-all-media type who has directed everything =\r\nfrom TV dramas to a\ntheme-park attraction, Shimoyama aspires to the epic, m=\r\nythic quality\nof Zhang Yimou&#39;s &quot;Hero&quot; or Ang Lee&#39;s &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden=\r\n Dragon&quot;\n-- and attains it surprisingly often. I say &quot;surprisingly&quot; because=\r\n\nmost Japanese films in this genre settle for the surface flash and\ndazzle =\r\nof the arcade. Shimoyama may be aiming at the same teen gamer\nmarket, but t=\r\nakes his material more seriously.\n\nAlso, the effects supplied by CG directo=\r\nr Hiroyuki Hayashi are in the\nservice of the story and characters, not simp=\r\nly for eye-popping\ndisplay. Some are dazzling, as when the hero, Gennosuke =\r\n(Joe Odagiri),\nuses superhuman powers of concentration to see water tumblin=\r\ng over a\nwaterfall in ultravivid slow motion. Or as when the heroine, Oboro=\r\n\n(Yukie Nakama), pierces a foe with her glance (her eyes changing color\nin =\r\nthe process) and shorts out his synapses, in a sequence that\nresembles an a=\r\nnimated medical drawing in hyper-realistic 3-D.\n\nThese and other feats deri=\r\nve from the ninjas&#39; training and abilities,\nnot simply from cartoonlike sup=\r\nerpowers. Impossibly exaggerated, yes;\nverging on the absurd, no. Also, the=\r\ny defeat each other more with\ntheir smartness than brute power displays. Ag=\r\nain, not the standard\nzap-&#39;em-till-they-vaporize model.\n\nFinally, Yukie Nak=\r\nama, a TV drama queen whose film work has been on\nthe light comic side, exu=\r\ndes dynamism, passion and sensuality, as\nthough she prepped with the films =\r\nof Zhang Ziyi. The usual strategy\nfor an actress in a superhero role is to =\r\nbutch up, either successfully\n(Angelina Jolie in &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;) or unconvin=\r\ncingly (Aya Ueto in\n&quot;Azumi&quot;). Nakama never abandons her femininity, even wh=\r\nen she is being\nthe fiery warrior. Conversely, she never loses her steely n=\r\ninja\nspirit, even as a woman in love.\n\nShe plays Oboro, a granddaughter of =\r\nOgen (Lily), the matriarch of the\nIga clan. Early in the story, she meets a=\r\nnd falls in love with\nGennosuke, the son of Danjo Koga (Minoru Terada), the=\r\n leader of the\nKoga clan. Living in the remote mountains, these two clans h=\r\nave, over\nthe centuries, perfected the arts of ninjutsu (or shinobi), which=\r\n is\nfar beyond the reach of mere mortals. They are also ancestral rivals\nan=\r\nd, under the order of Hanzo Hattori (Yutaka Matsushige), chief ninja\nto Sho=\r\ngun Tokugawa Ieyasu, are forbidden to exchange secret techniques\n-- not tha=\r\nt they would anyway.\n\nSeeking to consolidate Tokugawa rule and seeing the t=\r\nwo clans as a\nthreat to it, a powerful Tendai priest and Tokugawa adviser, =\r\nNankobo\nTenkai (Renji Ishibashi), schemes to set them against each other. H=\r\ne\ncommands the two clans to each choose five champions who will battle\nto t=\r\nhe death. The survivor will be elevated in rank and power.\n\nBoth Oboro and =\r\nGennosuke are selected as champions, but neither are\naware, at least initia=\r\nlly, of each other&#39;s position. Also, Gennosuke\ndoubts the shogunate&#39;s good =\r\nintentions and refuses to take part in the\ncontest. But when his comrades b=\r\negin to fall, he is forced into\naction. He cannot, however, bring himself t=\r\no battle at least one Iga\nwarrior: Oboro.\n\nThe 10 contestants in this ultim=\r\nate death match are radically\ndifferent from both the common run of humanit=\r\ny and each other, such as\nthe bizarro Saemon Kisaragi (Hoka Kinoshita) of t=\r\nhe Kogas, who can\nchange faces without cosmetic surgery, and the mysterioso=\r\n Yashamaru\n(Taku Sakaguchi) of the Igas, who is the long-haired ninja equiv=\r\nalent\nof &quot;The Incredibles&#39; &quot; Elastigirl.\n\nThe most memorable, however, are =\r\nones with the closest relationships\nto the two principals, including the lo=\r\nvely-but-creepy Kagero (Tomoka\nKurotani), who is poison to her enemies, but=\r\n sweet on Gennosuke, and\nTenzan Yakushi (Kippei Shiina), a silver-haired ni=\r\nnja master who knows\nall and sees all, including Oboro&#39;s conflicted heart.\n=\r\n\nFor those less interested in the emotional interplay than the action,\n&quot;Shi=\r\nnobi&quot; has much to offer beyond the usual wirework leaps and\nbounds. Action =\r\ndirector Yuji Shimomura has created fresh variations on\nfamiliar ninja stun=\r\nts that will have hard-core genre fans doing &quot;did I\nreally see that?&quot; takes=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Shinobi&quot; does not require shinbo (patience): It flies across the\nscreen=\r\n and ends, after all the mayhem, with a poignant moment of\nremembrance and =\r\nhope. Super ninjas may not be forever, but love endures.\n\nThe Japan Times: =\r\nSept. 30, 2005\n(C) All rights reserved\n\n\n\n\n"
