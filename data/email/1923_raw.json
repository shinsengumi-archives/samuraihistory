It&#39;s amazing the cost of DVDs and videos in\nJapan. For example: Onmyoji is being released here on DVD in two months. It&#39;s\nless than $23 for the deluxe edition with documentaries and all that. The same\nedition in Japan is about 5400 yen -- over twice the price.\n\nIf you want to order them, you can from Amazon.co.jp (the Japanese Amazon). They\nhave a button you can hit to get English readings. The rest of the interface is\nidentical to the American version, so even if you can&#39;t read Japanese, that\nshouldn&#39;t be too hard. Note, though, that you can&#39;t get whole NHK series --\nthey&#39;re 52 hours long. They have a digest version that&#39;s usually three or four\ntapes, but will cost you about 30-40 bucks per tape. You can also buy full sets,\nIIRC, from NHK&#39;s website, but they cost about 500 bucks for a series.\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n"
