Any imperfections in forging a symmetrical blade, tends to\ncause it =\r\nto bend. A problem that has to be then corrected. I am told\nthat some of my=\r\n swords have come from the hardening and tempering\nprocess looking like cor=\r\nk-screws! The real art is then learning to make\nthis effect work &quot;for&quot; you =\r\nrather than against. And I think we can all\nagree that the Japanese smiths =\r\nreally know how to make it work &quot;for&quot;.\n\nYours\n\nDean\n***\n\nIn message &lt;a06110=\r\n424be75149c7d0d@[10.0.1.2]&gt;, tom helm &lt;junkmail@toryu-\nmon.com&gt; writes\n&gt;   =\r\n Rod et al-\n&gt;    =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 A skilled smith ultimately has control ove=\r\nr all aspects of \n&gt;    the finished product. Keeping that in mind the combi=\r\nnation of hard \n&gt;    edge steel and a softer spine along with differential =\r\nheating \n&gt;    produces curvature in the Japanese sword. Actually it is the =\r\n\n&gt;    cooling \n&gt;    that does it, when the sword is heated in the fire the =\r\nclay keeps \n&gt;    the \n&gt;    back of the sword relatively cool so it doesn&#39;t =\r\nexpand as much as \n&gt;    the \n&gt;    unprotected edge steel. The edge steel ex=\r\npands, the back does not \n&gt;    and \n&gt;    this produces curve, the sword is =\r\nthen &quot;flash frozen&quot; in this state \n&gt;    by dropping it in water. The smith =\r\ngives his sword more or less \n&gt;    curve \n&gt;    (before yakiire) depending o=\r\nn the shape he wants (more or less \n&gt;    sori) \n&gt;    in the finished piece.=\r\n He can adjust the curve in other ways after \n&gt;    yakiire as well.\n&gt;    =\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 The combination of different steels and use of clay as \n&gt;  =\r\n  insulation may have been an experiment at some point that \n&gt;    unexpecte=\r\ndly produced curve=A0 in a straight blade, so at that early \n&gt;    stage at =\r\nleast could be said to have been a happy accident...\n&gt;    -t\n&gt;    www.ncjsc=\r\n.org\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    ---\n&gt;    Join the 2005 &#39;Samurai Fiction&#39; contest: \n&gt;    http:=\r\n//www.samurai-archives.com/writcon.html\n&gt;    Samurai Archives: http://www.s=\r\namurai-archives.com\n&gt;    Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/s=\r\namuraiarchives\n&gt;    --- \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Yahoo!
