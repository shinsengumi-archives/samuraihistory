It is possible I can also\r\nfind someone to fund it\r\n\r\nhowever until someone who knows better (maybe yourself\r\nNate) then we have to make do with a little better\r\neach time. So far the only nina documentaries I have\r\nseen are on things ike dicovery and I could have\r\nchoked at the crap they spouted.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Nate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n--- Richardson Paul &lt;umaryu@...&gt; wrote:\r\n&gt; HI\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I love this attitude.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I havent seen it, I know nothing about it, so I will\r\n&gt; slam it as much as I can.\r\n\r\nSince when has skepticism meant &quot;slam it as much as I\r\ncan&quot;? I&#39;ll slam Hayes all day--I&#39;ve, to date, made 1\r\ncomment about the documentary. Did you produce this?\r\nYou&#39;re certainly defending it like you&#39;ve got a vested\r\ninterest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese\r\nhistory 101 and knows something now--but I&#39;m\r\nskeptical. \r\n\r\nIf the documentary isn&#39;t built around him, than\r\nlovely--hopefully it has some useful information. \r\n\r\n&gt; My I suggest if you already think its a load of crap\r\n&gt; before its been released that you go and produce\r\n&gt; something better.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; i await your future project on the ninja so we can\r\n&gt; all\r\n&gt; insult it\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re willing to pay me to quit my job, fund the\r\nproject, and pay the production costs, I&#39;d be more\r\nthan happy to. Of course, it&#39;d be cheaper to just\r\ntranslate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then\r\nyou&#39;d take issue with my translation, I&#39;m sure. \r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
