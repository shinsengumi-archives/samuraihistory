Descended from a grandson of Emperor Kammu, Takamoc=\r\nhi (governor of Kazusa), by 1180, the Taira/Heike possessed 30 of the 66 pr=\r\novinces through being zuryo, as well as possessing an alleged 500 shoen. Af=\r\nter the successful defeat of Sutoku (the Hogen no ran, 1156), and Fujiwara =\r\nno Nobuyori (the Heiji no ran, 1159), Taira no Kiyomori sat at the head of =\r\na vast network of provinces and shoen, throughout Honshu, but primarily con=\r\ncentrated in the west. He was not like a later daimyo centred upon a partic=\r\nular province, although it is clear that he considered Fukuhara on the Inla=\r\nnd Sea as his base (for both poltical and Song-Chinese trade control), atte=\r\nmpting to permenantly move the capital there in the late 1170s), but domina=\r\nted positions and posts across the country; from regional officials, and es=\r\ntate owners, to family members and vassals within the North Gate bushidan. =\r\n\nM.Lorimer  \n\nKenshi Zey &lt;spectresinthefog@...&gt; wrote:\nhello everybod=\r\ny,\n\ni admit that i&#39;d make any sort of introduction when i joined the group =\r\nsince reading a few topics on the group&#39;s page,i understood i knew very lit=\r\ntle about the samurai and their history along with japan&#39;s history.and i ad=\r\nmit that i didn&#39;t want to start posting and say something stupid until i le=\r\narned more.well,here i am :).\n\nmy name is zeynep (all my friends call me ze=\r\ny and my friend gave me the japanese name &#39;kenshi&#39; as i wanted one).i&#39;m fro=\r\nm turkey and i&#39;m very interested with the samurai and their history,so i jo=\r\nined this group.i am currently unable to order books about the samurai via =\r\nthe internet and have difficulty finding them in turkey and in bulgaria (wh=\r\nere i currently reside since my father works here),though i did come across=\r\n ihara saikaku&#39;s &#39;the comrade loves of the samurai&#39; in turkish (and bought =\r\nit) but i still am doing research on the net to broaden my knowledge concer=\r\nning the samurai.\n\ni&#39;ve been checking out the maps on the samurai archives =\r\nwebsite and i wondered whether anyone knows the geographical location of th=\r\ne taira clan.what i mean is where exactly was the head of the clan located =\r\non the map of japan.i admit that i don&#39;t know much about japan&#39;s geography =\r\nand studying the map of old japan&#39;s provinces didn&#39;t help.can anyone commen=\r\nt on this?\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Like these blossoms,we all die...&quot; - Katsumoto,Moritsugu\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
