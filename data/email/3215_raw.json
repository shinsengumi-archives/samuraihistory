Do you know who came up\n&gt; this? I couldn&#39;t find it on the site. Interesting that\n&gt; the ~no suke and ~ no kami titles seemed to rank below\n&gt; Taisho and so forth. Maybe I&#39;m just thinking in terms\n&gt; of landed titles (which by that point they were not)\n&gt; but it seemed to me that you would have to be a taisho\n&gt; before you could gain enough prestige before you got a\n&gt; title like that. \n\nThat&#39;s because daj�-daijin was a code position. Kanpaku wasn&#39;t. It was created \nad hoc outside the system.\n\nTony\n\n\n"
