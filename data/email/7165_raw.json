His book\n&gt; is even banned in some states, cities, and book\n&gt; stores. I actually saw the\n&gt; book in a book store and I peeked into it for a bit,\n&gt; and laughed at it.\n&gt; there is not one speck of real Ninpo in the entire\n&gt; book. now I read that he\n&gt; was found not guilty he hugged the woman that was\n&gt; suing him, and then pulled\n&gt; down his pants and defecated on the floor on the way\n&gt; out of court saying \n&gt; that is real ultimate power&quot; and vanished. Now I do\n&gt; not know if that is true\n&gt; or not but it seems to be in news sites including\n&gt; CNN..\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n\nHmm. Not sure I buy the last part. I&#39;d think that he\nwouldn&#39;t exactly be allowed to &quot;vanish&quot; after\ndefecating on the floor of a court room, but maybe he\nused his magic ninja powers. If you could find a link\nor two, I&#39;d be interested. \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
