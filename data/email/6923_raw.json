I read in the misconceptions link that ninja carried samurai swords since they were samurai. But when I read this email about someone saying that a samurai was the superior fighter because of the sword I had to ask exactly what they meant. Samurai vs nija is really samurai vs. samurai.\n \nlater,\nRod\n\nNate Ledbetter &lt;ltdomer98@...&gt; wrote:\n\n--- ROD PAVEZ &lt;grfkboyz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi:\n&gt; I read you email about how ninja where inferior to\n&gt; samurai when it came to sword fighting, do you mean\n&gt; because of the sword shape?\n\nFor crying out loud, people! GO READ THE\nmisconceptions page. 1. &#39;Ninja&#39; WERE samurai--they\nsimply did covert ops much like today&#39;s Rangers, etc\ndo covert ops but are still soldiers. Any concept of\n&#39;ninja&#39; as separate from samurai and an &#39;outcast&#39;\nclass is pure Hollywood myth. 2. There was no\ndifference in sword shape--the straight &#39;ninja&#39; sword\nis a myth. \n\nRead here before you go any further:\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
