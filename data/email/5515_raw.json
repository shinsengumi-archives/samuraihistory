Men and women are \nmixed together but without=\r\n anything to indicate their status in the \ngroup or with whom they might be=\r\n associated (women were more like \npossessions in those days so one would e=\r\nxpect a female to stand \nrespectfully behind her father or husband while he=\r\n was seated or in \nsome other way indicate her place in the group). A woman=\r\n of good \nbreeding would never expose that much skin or any hint of her \nun=\r\nderclothes in so public a display as a photograph.\n\tTo me at least this is =\r\nnot a photograph of samurai but one of many \nposed photos taken by photogra=\r\nphers like Beato and others who were in \nJapan just after the fall of the S=\r\nhogun...\n-t\n\nOn Sep 12, 2004, at 11:19 AM, dcress wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;  Can a=\r\nnyone help me identify the persons in the URL below.
