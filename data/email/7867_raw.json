Some movies are plain\nentertainment, no=\r\nthing wrong with that.  Others have been made by\nsomeone with their own pol=\r\nitical or social agenda.  Still more have\nbeen made by people with access t=\r\no research material and reflect some\nkind of truth.\nI am also interested to=\r\n understand why you prefer archive material,\nand how you are assured of its=\r\n veracity. Since every contemporaneous\nwriter would have reflected whatever=\r\n particular axe he (or his\nsuperior) wished to grind, how are you sure that=\r\n they are writing the\ntruth and not tweaking, spinning or slanting?  I don&#39;=\r\nt think spin is\nanything new, it&#39;s been going on for as long as we have.  T=\r\nhus, any\nhistorical piece written by someone who was there (IF you can find=\r\n it)\nhas to be seived through, and a large pinch of salt added.  If it\nhapp=\r\nened 300, 500 or 800 years ago, and there are several sources\navailable who=\r\n contradict each other, what makes you choose one side?  \n\nCompared to most=\r\n people I&#39;m an ignoramous, but I&#39;m not so stupid as to\nbelieve something th=\r\nat is unprovable.  I prefer to go with my gut\ninstincts, and then doubt the=\r\nm too!  Ultimately, that&#39;s all any of us\nhave, a feeling that the source wh=\r\nose view we prefer is the one that\nis correct.  But we can&#39;t KNOW, so relyi=\r\nng on it, quoting on it or\nswearing on it is just plain daft.  Why would yo=\r\nu doubt that a film\nmaker has spent years of research in order to present h=\r\nis film in the\nmost accurate possible light?  \n\nAll verions of history are =\r\nfascinating, interesting and worthy of\nexploration, if for no other reason =\r\nthan to see how opposing views\nevolve.  Definitive decisions about what is =\r\nreal and what is not is\nbeyond our field of expertise, and the sooner we un=\r\nderstand that, the\nsooner we stop criticising others for not toe-ing our pa=\r\nrticular party\nline.\n\n\n\n-- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rntihg&quot; &lt;rnt=\r\nihg@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been absent from the list for at le=\r\nast a year, but have decided\n&gt; to see what&#39;s what here (albeit from a new e=\r\nmail address).\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to comment on the premise of Ms. Boal&#39;s questi=\r\nons.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Boal, Nina&quot; &lt;Nina.Boal@s.=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Back in the earlier thread, we were discuss=\r\ning the qualities of a\n&quot;good&quot;\n&gt; &gt; samurai. Some people, including myself, b=\r\nrought up two films, AFTER\n&gt; THE RAIN\n&gt; &gt; and SEPPUKU. I remember discussin=\r\ng one of the characters in SEPPUKU\n&gt; who had\n&gt; &gt; pawned his sword blades in=\r\n order to try and feed his family.\n&gt; According to\n&gt; &gt; some historical accou=\r\nnts I&#39;ve read, this seemed to have happened\nrather\n&gt; &gt; frequently during th=\r\ne Edo period, with impoverished ronin and\nsometimes\n&gt; &gt; low-ranked (low-pai=\r\nd) clan samurai pawning their sword blades,\nreplacing\n&gt; &gt; them with bamboo.=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; To which historical accounts are you referring?  Written when?  In\n=\r\n&gt; Japanese or English?  For a popular or academic audience?  Peer\n&gt; reviewe=\r\nd (as in university and other scholarly presses)?\n&gt; All of these (and many =\r\nmore) are the first questions one normally\n&gt; would ask about sources quoted=\r\n in support of any statement or\n&gt; hypothesis.  Without some idea of the sou=\r\nrces that you are using, a\n&gt; statement such as &#39;some historical accounts I&#39;=\r\nve read&#39; has an\n&gt; indeterminate authority and leaves me (and I suspect othe=\r\nrs) curious\n&gt; as to the accuracy that we can expect from the sources.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe next thing that I would point out is that these are just movies. \n&gt; Whi=\r\nle I like Kurosawa and Tokugawa-set period pieces, I don&#39;t beleive\n&gt; anyone=\r\n would put much faith in their historical accuracy.  That is not\n&gt; to say t=\r\nhat the things that movies depict are necessarily untrue, but\n&gt; simply that=\r\n they can&#39;t be relied upon as historical documents in the\n&gt; same way that c=\r\nontemporaneous materials can.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So with the statement cited below=\r\n: can it be inferred that a\n&gt; samurai&#39;s sword\n&gt; &gt; -- and keeping it -- woul=\r\nd be more important to a samurai&#39;s honor than\n&gt; &gt; feeding his family? That =\r\nit was considered better if the samurai&#39;s\n&gt; family\n&gt; &gt; were to starve to de=\r\nath rather than for the samurai to ever part\n&gt; with his\n&gt; &gt; sword? And thus=\r\n a samurai who sells his sword blades, even to keep his\n&gt; &gt; family alive, i=\r\ns acting dishonorably?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nina\n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing to keep in mind is =\r\nthat the stories that come down to us\n&gt; throug history and are popularized =\r\nin  books that treat the samurai\n&gt; and the concept of honor (among other th=\r\nings), often uncritically\n&gt; choose those stories/anecdotes/legends that sup=\r\nport the picture of the\n&gt; samurai that they are trying to paint and do a po=\r\nor job at addressing\n&gt; alternative interpretations of the sources that do e=\r\nxist.  I believe\n&gt; that most of us have probably heard that a samurai&#39;s top=\r\nknot was,\n&gt; similar to the sword, sacrosanct as a badge of the privileged c=\r\nlass to\n&gt; which he belonged.  If memory serves, Kurosawa in 7 Samurai, has =\r\none\n&gt; of the main characters cut hit hair to impersonate a priest in order\n=\r\n&gt; to achieve a solution to the hostage stalemate.  Who to believe, the\n&gt; po=\r\npular history books or Kurosawa...or are both depictions accurate.\n&gt; \n&gt; I h=\r\nave been reading and trying to get caught up with the threads that\n&gt; I have=\r\n missed during the last year or so, that I have been absent from\n&gt; the list=\r\n and am enjoying the variety of topics that have come up. \n&gt; Some of the re=\r\ncent threads in particular have piqued my curiosity, but\n&gt; it seems reasona=\r\nble for us to analyze the assumptions behind some of\n&gt; the questions that w=\r\ne are asking and to be as clear as possible about\n&gt; the sources that we use=\r\n so that everyone has an idea as to the\n&gt; relative accuracy and authority o=\r\nf the information. \n&gt; \n&gt; Granted that many times we don&#39;t have our referenc=\r\nes to hand when we\n&gt; are inspired to post, but even in those cases it might=\r\n be nice to\n&gt; follow up including the citations in a later post in the thre=\r\nad.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Shannon\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"
