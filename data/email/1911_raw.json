This\nfifty episode?miniseries followed the life of the Hojo Shikken Tokimune plus\ngave considerable time showing the Mongol side as well. The battle scenes\nnear the end were quite good. I could tape the entire series from TV. I know\nthat a condensed version (about four hours) is available on tape and DVD\nhere in Japan. What might be available in your area I don&#39;t know. Other\nposters to this forum have said some of these Taiga Drama&#39;s are available in\nsome areas of the states.\n\nAnother film about this subject is called &#39;The Divine Wind Blows&#39; (Japanese\ntitle &#39;Kakute Shinpu wo Fuku&#39;) made in 1944. Its mostly propaganda, made\nnear the end of World war II. The copy I saw was pretty well worn. The sound\nand picture were of poor quality. I have not seen this on video or DVD. The\ncopy I have was shown on TV some time ago. Better to see the NHK version.\n\n\n\n"
