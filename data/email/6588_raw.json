It seems to me that the urge to collect Japanese swords should be\ncurbed until a decent sword may be obtained. I think to collect anything,\nyou must buy the best quality you can with the money available. Therefore if\nyou only have �200-�300 you might be better advised to buy a reasonable\nkogai or tsuba rather than a repro sword which really is not a Japanese\nsword at all, only a pale facsimile. Early collectors are rather vulnerable\nin this respect and should curb their enthusiasm until they can make\ninformed judgements. Now, although I am a lifetime collector of Japanese\nswords, I know that the swords that I really would like to have, are way\nbeyond my reach unless a miracle involving the national lottery occurs and\nprobably even then, they are unobtainable. However, this by no means\nprevents me seeing, handling, studying and appreciating these objects and\nthe need to possess them becomes less of an issue. As has been said many\ntimes before, as the swords will outlast our lifetimes, we never really own\nthem and are simply caretakers for a certain time. Further, I would advise,\nonly look at good swords and do not waste your time on poor quality swords\nsuch as Showa-to. Looking at poor quality swords will effect your judgement\nin a negative way.\nThere is no short cut to learning about swords, even with the help of the\ninternet. The internet will provide vast amounts of information but this\nwill not give you knowledge. For instance, you may read that there is a\nfeature in swords by certain Rai school swordsmiths known as Nie-utsuri and\nyou will know this fact but until you see this on a sword, you will never\nreally know what Nie-usturi is or be able to recognise it.\nReading the above it sounds rather pompous and I don&#39;t mean it to be. Many\nthese days, influenced by films and other things, glimpse the fascination of\nthe Japanese sword but are not prepared for the long and hard study involved\nin the subject. My concern is that they get their hands onto swords and\nunintentionaly but through ignorance, impart ireperable damage on these\nartistic and cultural icons. Ignorance is the greatest enemy of the Japanese\nsword in the 21st centuruy.\nTime to get off my soap box\nRegards\nClive Sinclaire\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Elizabeth Chase&quot; &lt;lizzirrd@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, January 21, 2005 6:55 AM\nSubject: Patience --- Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai Swords\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d have to vote along Mr. Wallis&#39; line of reasoning....  learning all you\ncan by reading,  going to museums, and politely pestering\n&gt; your sword-owning friends for proper viewings.....   and remember... you\nasked:  you buy dinner and refreshments.  Sword handling\n&gt; etiquette would help.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the meantime, tithe yourself each payday and hide that money.  If you\npay attention to your environment,  the sword you should\n&gt; have will make its way to you.

You best bet\n&gt; would be to save , your uk based so if clive picks this up he maybe able\nto help out. but like all good things you get what you pay\n&gt; for. Personally buy a few books and learn what to look for in a good blade\nalso check out the excellent sword display at the british\n&gt; museum. To cap it off better to invest in some good books on the subject\nand save for a better blade that way you wont get ripped\n&gt; of. james\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Samurai Archives: http://www.samurai-archives.com\n&gt; Samurai Archives store: http://www.cafeshops.com/samuraiarchives\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Yahoo!
