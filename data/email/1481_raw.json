People are just nuts. The Japanese aren&#39;t bushido-crazy \nsword-carrying, Karate-chopping Kimono-wearers anymore (No matter \nwhat your ninja master tells you) - if anything they are the somewhat \nsad end result of 250 years of xenophobic self-isolation, and for the \nmost part have forgotten their past except for what shows up in the \nhistory books or on the NHK Taiga dramas. Oops, probably stepped on \nsome toes there.  I&#39;m generalizing heavily to make a point, don&#39;t \ntake me too seriously ;)  \n\nAnd as a side note, I&#39;m starting to have trouble telling the \ndifference between non-native english speakers, native english \nspeakers who can&#39;t spell or use punctuation worth a damn, and three \nyear olds who logged in under thier parent&#39;s sign-in.\n\n\n\n--- In samuraihistory@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Anthony J.
