There are others here far more qualified.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  What I would say however, is as soon as we start talking about \n&gt;  &#39;the soul of the samurai&#39; or &#39;the way of bushido&#39; then we are \n&gt;  talking about something that is absent, such terms belong to the \n&gt;  notions of &#39;the good ol days&#39; or &#39;the golden age of&#39; and invariably \n&gt;  romanticises the reality.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &quot;People in the old days would talk when they had something to \n&gt;  say, and would not say unnecessary things...&quot;\n&gt;  Arai Hakuseki &quot;My Father&quot; (from &quot;Legends of the Samurai&#39;)\n&gt;  \n\nThis all may very well be true. But this is the &quot;samurai history list,&quot; which \nmeans that it&#39;s designed to talk about &quot;the good ol&#39; days.&quot; \n\nSome of these notions i.e. &quot;the sword is the soul of the samurai,&quot; &quot;bushido,&quot; \netc. have gotten distorted in current times. But I don&#39;t care about these \ncontemporary distortions of these terms, as I want to study history here. So the \nlegitimate questions remain: how did these concepts affect samurai in \nhistorical times? \n\nMyself, I believe that the concepts came out of the Edo period, when fighting \nwas scarce or else non-existent. Still, samurai existed for around 250 years \nduring this time and their history is interesting to study.\n\nNina\n\n"
