I can remember that, but I can&#39;t remember to\nbring home toilet paper from the store. I suppose\nthat&#39;s why my wife gets frustrated. *sigh*\n\nIt&#39;s important to keep in mind that it was a feudal\nmaster-retainer relationship. I would take you into my\nservice, give you land or a stipend, etc. In return,\nyou&#39;d provide military service--and that included\nproviding your own equipment, horse, weapons, armor,\nand sub-retainers (your attendants, etc., depending on\nyour station) and their equipment. Since it&#39;s all\ncoming out of different pockets, it&#39;s highly unlikely\nI would be able to tell all my retainers &quot;You must all\nbe the same&quot;. You could standardize your band of 5\nguys or so, but at that time, why? Even the sashimono\ndidn&#39;t really come into being prior to the end of the\nOnin War, when armies got bigger and bigger and needed\nclearer ways of identifying. Uniforms seem natural to\nus today, but even in European armies, you didn&#39;t\nreally see uniforms until the late 17th/early 18th\ncenturies. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
