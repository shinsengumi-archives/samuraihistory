My\n&gt; name is Moses and I am looking forward to some interesting discussion.\n&gt; Up to this point I have only read Hagakure but I am looking to expand my\n&gt; knowledge of the samurai as far as is possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a senior Literature major so any books that you can recommend to me\n&gt; I would be more than happy to read.  Hoping for good things.  Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Moses\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; &quot;Of all that is written I love only what a man has written\n&gt; with his blood.
