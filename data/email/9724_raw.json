You could try \n  centuryfitness.com, they have a new signature sword collection, and since it \n  is in dollars it would be pretty cheap in \n  pounds. Also, I would give Bugei.com a try. Be warned about century \n  though, their swords are not traditionally forged.\n  DO NOT BUY A SWORD FROM CENTURY!!! The Signature Series is made by Hanwei. \n  The rest is just junk. Bugei, also gets their swords from Hanwei. Check out \n  _www.casiberia.com_ (http://www.casiberia.com) . If you are looking for \n  replica&#39;s, Hanwei is the way to go. Not cheap, but a high level of quality.\n\n  Greg\n\n  **************Planning your summer road trip?
