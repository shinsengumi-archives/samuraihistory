He becomes a\nsocial pariah, is mistrusted and disliked, and someone turning up,\noffering to fight for money, can only mean one thing ... trouble.\n\nLet alone the insult of assuming that a samurai would fight for\nsomething like ... money?\n\nThere is the added social stigma of losing to such a man. How can a\nsamurai hold his head high when he&#39;s been beaten by a beggar?\n\nOn the other hand, swordsmen of renown (or independent means) might\nengage in a musa shugyo (musha shugyo?) which I have seen translated\nas &#39;warrior pilgrimage&#39;; &#39;dojo tour&#39; and &#39;warrior way&#39; (&#39;michi&#39;, as\nopposed to &#39;do&#39;).\n\nIt is recorded of Bokuden, for example, that he travelled in style, a\ncaravan of some 60-odd in attendance, the equivalent of a daimyo\nprocession. Nobutsuna Kamiizumi did the same.\n\nIn either case, the chance to engage in a friendly match with a master\ncan do one&#39;s reputation no harm, and there is always something to\nlearn. Both men would have been welcomed, even if technically &#39;ronin&#39;,\ntheir reputations had won them social status.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n"
