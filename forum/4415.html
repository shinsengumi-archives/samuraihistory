I went to Kublacon in Burlingame, CA this weekend to find someone to play<br/>
Clan War with me. I brought over 28mm 1500 Clan War figures to Kublacon this<br/>
weekend, each and everyone was at the pro-painted level. Lots of interest<br/>
but no one brought their Clans with them to play or were ready to play with<br/>
my figures. It seems that Clan War is dead on the West Coast. And that's a<br/>
real shame because I enjoyed playing it very much.<br/>
<br/>
However, as a historical miniatures player, I was always disappointed that<br/>
most Clan War players never took the time to paint their armies. Maybe<br/>
that's why a lot of the historical players by-passed the game system and<br/>
just purchased the figures to create their samurai armies and used other<br/>
rules systems.<br/>
<br/>
We played WAB and Katana. A lot of the former Clan War players in my area<br/>
are getting their armies converted over to Warhammer Ancient Battles. Our<br/>
samurai are awesome in WAB. So if you can't find any Clan War players at the<br/>
next CON you attend, maybe you should look at putting together a WAB Samurai<br/>
list. At least you'll be able to field your army on the tabletop and you'll<br/>
get some use out of them. Also, be sure you take the time to paint your<br/>
figures.<br/>
<br/>
When my son offered to display a pro-painted level ion / Crane / Crab /<br/>
Unicorn / Dragon / Yoritomo armies he was ignored by the guys who put on the<br/>
Legends of the 5 Rings card game. I guess the lead figures are  no longer of<br/>
interest to the WofC folks.<br/>
<br/>
I got a chance to chat with Jervis Johnson this weekend at Kublacon in<br/>
Burlingame, CA (SF Bay Area) and discuss Samurais in WAB. He pointed out<br/>
that it's not too often that a games author gets to do something special in<br/>
a rules set. He loves the Japanese armies and of course the movie Seven<br/>
Samurai and the 47 Ronin.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai are an unbalanced army in WAB but there will be a new Samurai list<br/>
as soon as Robert figures out what he wants to put it, maybe next summer at<br/>
the earliest/latest. Jervis states that he will make changes as needed, but<br/>
sees no need to make any further changes at this time to the Samurai Army<br/>
List.<br/>
<br/>
Jervis points out that war is never balanced. Real world or historical<br/>
armies are/were never tweaked until they are equal on the battlefield. The<br/>
best general is the one who takes what he has to fight with and uses his<br/>
skills to achieve victory. If an Egyptian goes up against a Samurai Army and<br/>
pulls a draw or a victory, then it's a well earned victory. However, if you<br/>
the Samurai Army commander fails to achieve victory, then it says something<br/>
about your understanding of how to use Samurai properly.<br/>
<br/>
So use what you have to your best advantage in your next WAB tournament.<br/>
Exploit all the strengths that your WAB Samurai army has to offer. And if<br/>
your opponent loses, it's not because he has the best army, it's because he<br/>
let his fear of your army list defeat him.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes, I did get both of my WAB books autographed by Jervis.<br/>
<br/>
BANZAI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
