<br/>
    My name is Bob Burke and I am a recent subscriber to this list.  I have <br/>
been studying the last Samurai Rebellion (the Satsuma Rebellion) of 1877 for <br/>
the past several years.<br/>
<br/>
    Below is a bried article I wrote several years ago about the organization <br/>
of the Imperial and Samurai armies that took part in the battle.  I hope to <br/>
expand the article into a booklet someday, complete with OBs and descriptions <br/>
of the main battles.<br/>

 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE IMPERIAL AND SATSUMA ARMIES<br/>
<br/>
Â©  by Robert W. Burke, Jr.            May 21, 1991<br/>
<br/>
        After the Restoration of 1868, one of the top priorities of the new <br/>
Imperial government was the formation of a national army under its control.  <br/>
On October 2, 1870, one month after the French defeat at Sedan, the <br/>
government announced that its army would be modeled after the French Army <br/>
(the announcement also stated that the new navy would be modeled after that <br/>
of Britain).  One of the major considerations in choosing the French system <br/>
over that of Prussia was that more Japanese military men spoke French than <br/>
German.<br/>
<br/>
        By the time of the Satsuma Rebellion, the Imperial Japanese Army <br/>
numbered over 34,000 men and consisted of both line and imperial guard <br/>
troops.  The line infantry was divided into 14 regiments of 3 battalions <br/>
each.  Each battalion consisted of 4 companies.  In peace time, each company <br/>
had approximately 160 privates and 32 officers and non-commissioned officers. <br/>
 During war time a company's strength was to be increased to 240 privates.   <br/>
A battalion had 640 men in peace time and was supposed to have 960 men in war <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
        There were two "regiments" of line cavalry and one "regiment" of <br/>
imperial guard cavalry.  The two line regiments each contained 120 men in <br/>
peace time and were to be increased to 150 men each during war time.  <br/>
Contemporary illustrations show the cavalry armed with lances.<br/>
<br/>
        The Imperial Artillery consisted of 18 batteries divided into 9 <br/>
battalions, with 120 men per battery during peace time.  During war time, the <br/>
mountain artillery was supposed to have 160 men per battery and the field <br/>
artillery was supposed to have 130 men per battery.<br/>
<br/>
        Due to the suddenness of events in Satsuma, the line units of the <br/>
Imperial Army seem to have taken the field at their peace time strength.<br/>
<br/>
        The Imperial Guard (most of whom were ex-samurai) was always <br/>
maintained at war time strength. The guard infantry was divided into 2 <br/>
regiments of 2 battalions each.  A battalion was 672 men strong and was <br/>
organized as per the line battalions.  The cavalry regiment consisted of 150 <br/>
men.   The artillery battalion was divided into 2 batteries with 130 men per <br/>
battery.<br/>
<br/>
        The Japanese Army did not have a brigade or corps system like the <br/>
French or many other European armies.  Japan was divided into six military <br/>
districts: Tokyo (Yedo), Sendai, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima and Kumamoto.  <br/>
There were usually two or three regiments of infantry, plus artillery and <br/>
other auxiliary troops, assigned to each district.  The Imperial guard was <br/>
assigned to the Tokyo district.<br/>
<br/>
        The uniforms of the Japanese Imperial Army resembled those of the <br/>
French Garde Mobile in appearance.  Japanese infantrymen wore a dark blue <br/>
kepi, a short jacket with French style field pack, and dark blue pants (in <br/>
summer, the uniform was white).  They were armed with breechloading Snider <br/>
rifles and could fire approximately six rounds per minute.  The cavalry wore <br/>
red kepis with a small white plume in the front, dark blue jackets, red pants <br/>
with a yellow stripe, and black boots.  At least one illustration shows their <br/>
saddle blankets as being red with yellow trim and their lance pennants were <br/>
red over white.  Artillery consisted of over 100 <br/>
artillery pieces, including 5.28 pound mountain guns, Krupp field guns of <br/>
various calibers, and mortars.<br/>
<br/>
        In addition to the army, the central government also used marines and <br/>
Tokyo policemen in its struggle against the Satsuma samurai.  The police were <br/>
primarily comprised of ex-samurai (many of whom were from Satsuma) and were <br/>
armed only with wooden batons and swords (Japanese police did not carry <br/>
firearms until the Rice Riots of 1918).  The police were mobilized in units <br/>
ranging from 300 to 600 men.<br/>
<br/>
        The Satsuma samurai army was initially organized into six battalions <br/>
(or regiments) of 2,000 men each.  Each battalion was divided into ten <br/>
companies of 200 men, which were further divided into four platoons of 50 <br/>
men.  On its march to Kumamoto Castle, the army was divided into three <br/>
divisions; an advance guard of 4,000 men, another division of 4,000 men, and <br/>
a rearguard of 2,000 men.  There were 200 artillerymen and 1,200 laborers in <br/>
the army.  In April 1877, Saigo reorganized the army into nine infantry units <br/>
of 350 to 800 men each.<br/>
<br/>
        The samurai attempted to dress in a similar manner to give the <br/>
appearance of uniformity.  Their dress consisted of their own clothes and <br/>
armor was not worn, except by a few officers who wore a breastplate.  Saigo <br/>
and some of his officers wore their military uniforms.  Each samurai wore a <br/>
white cloth on his upper arm so that they could identify themselves.<br/>
<br/>
        The samurai were armed with Enfield muzzle loading rifles and could <br/>
fire approximately one round per minute.  Their artillery <br/>
consisted of 28 mountain guns, 2 field guns (15.84 pounders), and 30 assorted <br/>
mortars.<br/>
<br/>
        When the students raided the Kagoshima armories a large number of <br/>
sword blades were seized.  Many of these blades were of inferior quality and <br/>
were fitted with blackened iron hilts.  The hilts were bound with rough braid <br/>
or canvas.  Some samurai who later joined the Satsuma army may have carried <br/>
yaris (spears).<br/>
<br/>
        Although the Satsuma Army did not contain any cavalry, a few officers <br/>
such as Saigo were mounted.</div>
