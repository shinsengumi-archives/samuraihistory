<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116029417">A new poster's question. Does anyone who frequents this discussion <br/>
group have any formal experience in the field of historical japan? Or <br/>
are the majority just people of appreciation?<br/>
<br/>
Either way is cool to me. I just find the vast range of the knowledge <br/>
of you all extremely remarkable. It's very inspiring to read this <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129152385">I myself have no "formal" education in Japanese history, I just read <br/>
and research Japanese history because I find it extremely <br/>
interesting. I've read a few books on Japanese history and I'm <br/>
constantly searching the internet for facts. Just recently I've <br/>
found this group, which has acted as both a source of knowledge, and <br/>
an outlet to express my knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
And Hello back<br/>

(A.J. Bryant) is a published author on the subject and<br/>
is currently working on yet another degree at IU; he's<br/>
probably the most academic of us all, by far. <br/>
