| A New Biography of Oda Nobunaga<br/>
|<br/>
| Jeroen Lamers has written a biography of Oda Nobunaga, the<br/>
| sixteenth century warrior who was the first of the so-called<br/>
| three great unifiers of early modern Japan.  The study focuses<br/>
| particularly on the policies and actions of Nobunaga during the<br/>
| years of his national ascendancy, 1568-82.  Mr. Lamers has<br/>
| consulted a wide range of contemporary sources: in addition to<br/>
| numerous official documents, these include the Shincho Kyou-ki<br/>
| by Oota Gyuuichi, Nobunaga's first chronicler, the Jesuit<br/>
| records, and diaries like the Kanemi Kyou-ki and Tokitsugu<br/>
| Kyou-ki.  Mr.  Lamers has also taken full measure of the works<br/>
| of Japanese and western historians in his treatment of this<br/>
| important figure.<br/>
|<br/>
| This monograph contributes in several important ways to the<br/>
| literature on Nobunaga and sixteenth century Japan.  First, it<br/>
| is the only thorough treatment of Nobunaga's career and<br/>
| achievements in a western language.  Although we have read about<br/>
| Nobunaga, or at least Nobunaga's policies, in the context of the<br/>
| Sengoku period and are aware of his main achievements, it tends<br/>
| to be mainly as a forerunner to Hideyoshi and Ieyasu that he is<br/>
| remembered.  In a full treatment of his life his achievements<br/>
| are better appreciated not only for what came after him but for<br/>
| what he achieved in his own times.  Second, we can better<br/>
| appreciate Nobunaga's genius as a military and especially<br/>
| political tactician when we see the tremendous odds against<br/>
| which he struggled all his adult life, besieged by enemies on<br/>
| all sides.  Although the Japanese political scene fell into<br/>
| disarray once Nobunaga was assassinated, his policies and<br/>
| campaigns had indeed unified great portions of the country by<br/>
| the time Hideyoshi took control.  In his drive to take Kyoto and<br/>
| in his decision to settle in Azuchi, near but not in the ancient<br/>
| capital, Nobunaga defined himself as a national leader and not<br/>
| simply as the head of a coalition of warriors.  Finally, by<br/>
| giving close attention to the years 1568 through 1573, Mr.<br/>
| Lamers shows the Muromachi shogunate under the active leadership<br/>
| of the last shogun, Yoshiaki, to have been much more vital and<br/>
| politically significant even immediately prior to its demise<br/>
| than is usually thought.<br/>
|<br/>
| Mr. Lamers approaches the story of Nobunaga's life primarily as<br/>
| a series of scholarly debates which he presents, analyzes and,<br/>
| often, dismisses in whole or in part.  He then puts forth his<br/>
| own revisionist conclusions, some of which are persuasive and<br/>
| carefully considered, and certainly demonstrate familiarity with<br/>
| both Japanese and western scholarship.  Nevertheless, this<br/>
| approach, however valid it may be in a dissertation, imparts a<br/>
| pedantic quality to a biography and detracts from what should be<br/>
| the narrative thrust of Nobunaga's life.  Some of the scholarly<br/>
| judgments, moreover, come across as excessively dismissive. Asao<br/>
| Naohiro's thinking on the concept of tenka, for instance, should<br/>
| not be dismissed out of hand (p. 128) simply because the author<br/>
| is determined to refute the theory of Nobunaga's<br/>
| self-deification.  It is quite possible, it seems to me, that<br/>
| Nobunaga had the intellectual capacity, not to mention political<br/>
| shrewdness, to apply concepts of statehood to his rule.  Mr.<br/>
| Lamers, however, seems determined to portray him at all costs as<br/>
| a pragmatist.<br/>
|<br/>
| Mr. Lamers has extensively mined contemporary Jesuit writings in<br/>
| his study.  These are valuable if biased sources, as he reminds<br/>
| the reader frequently: they record events that corroborate<br/>
| Japanese sources and they contain some descriptions of Japanese<br/>
| life not found elsewhere, but their interpretation of events is<br/>
| often self-interested.  Unfortunately, Mr. Lamers too frequently<br/>
| gets sidetracked into a determination to undermine these<br/>
| sources, and in the process the narrative of Nobunaga's life is<br/>
| relegated to the wings: for instance, the author attacks at<br/>
| length the Jesuits' portrayal of Nobunaga as a supporter of<br/>
| Christianity, and later refutes Luis Frois' assertion of<br/>
| Nobunaga's self-deification.  Nobunaga's relationship with the<br/>
| Jesuits was indeed one part of his consolidation of power and<br/>
| isolation of certain enemies.  The author might have analyzed it<br/>
| to explicate aspects of Nobunaga's character germane to his hold<br/>
| on power: his shrewdness, his fascination with the unknown and<br/>
| the exotic, and at the same time his prudence.  Instead, Mr.<br/>
| Lamers gets caught up in showing the Jesuits to be vain and<br/>
| misguided in their belief that Nobunaga supported them.  (This<br/>
| argument, incidentally, turns out to be a non-starter: some of<br/>
| the sources cited show in fact a very accurate and sober Jesuit<br/>
| understanding of Nobunaga's motives in granting them favorable<br/>
| treatment.)  Ultimately, the space devoted to critiquing the<br/>
| Jesuit sources is disproportionate to this relatively minor<br/>
| aspect of Nobunaga's life.<br/>
|<br/>
| As the subtitle suggests, Mr. Lamers is at pains to challenge<br/>
| the standard view of Nobunaga as a cruel and brutal tyrant.<br/>
| Again, he implicates the Jesuits as the original culprits, with<br/>
| the label sticking even in the most recent scholarship on<br/>
| Nobunaga.  To refute this, Mr.  Lamers presents events as they<br/>
| may have appeared to Nobunaga and argues, often persuasively,<br/>
| that the actions he took were (simply) those of a pragmatic,<br/>
| decisive, non-ideological, and extremely ambitious warrior.<br/>
| Perhaps so, but in the end there are enough cases of massive<br/>
| slaughter, deliberate disgrace and humiliation of less worthy<br/>
| vassals, ruthless treatment of enemies, and, to put it mildly,<br/>
| iconoclastic treatment of Buddhist groups that the original<br/>
| label remains quite apt.  But after all, brutality was<br/>
| widespread in the sixteenth century, and not only in Japan.  Yet<br/>
| is this the best yardstick by which to assess Nobunaga?  By<br/>
| focusing so heavily on brutality Mr. Lamers places central<br/>
| emphasis on a moral evaluation of Nobunaga's character, in the<br/>
| process missing other standards by which to consider his place<br/>
| in history.  In his conclusion, which is too mild considering<br/>
| the weight of the story he has just told, Lamers ends by merely<br/>
| saying that "the best adjectives to characterise Nobunaga's rule<br/>
| and personality are not "callous and brutal" but "pragmatic and<br/>
| ruthless" (p. 232).  Surely there is more that could be said of<br/>
| the career and contributions of this brilliant military and<br/>
| political tactician.  Mr. Lamers points out that the treatment<br/>
| of Nobunaga by early modern Japanese chroniclers and historians<br/>
| in the early modern period is a huge topic requiring a separate<br/>
| study.  Nonetheless, a summary, at least, of the early modern<br/>
| Japanese writings on Nobunaga would have balanced the attention<br/>
| given to Jesuit writings, and perhaps helped better define a<br/>
| historical niche for Nobunaga.<br/>
|<br/>
| Nobunaga's reputation as a cruel and ruthless warrior rests in<br/>
| part on his treatment, audacious for its times, of institutional<br/>
| Buddhism.  In 1571 his forces attacked and burned Enryakuji, the<br/>
| great Tendai monastery on Mt. Hiei, and slaughtered its<br/>
| thousands of monks.  This study portrays the event as payback<br/>
| for Enryakuji's monks joining forces opposed to Nobunaga in<br/>
| earlier conflicts--"a matter of restoring his military<br/>
| credibility and saving his personal honor" (p. 76).  While<br/>
| allowing that this was an unprecedented act of sacrilege,<br/>
| however, Mr.  Lamers does not convey Enryakuji's powerful<br/>
| position in the medieval economy and religion, and thus somewhat<br/>
| underrates the importance of the event.  Quite simply, no<br/>
| earlier ruler could have even contemplated such a move.  By<br/>
| sacking Enryakuji, Nobunaga obliterated one of the foundations<br/>
| of the medieval order.  His other "encounter" with Buddhism was<br/>
| his long struggle against the well-organized and persistent<br/>
| forces of the Honganji.  It is true that these forces lacked the<br/>
| monastic character of the monks at Hiei, but ascribing<br/>
| Nobunaga's motives in this campaign partly to a loathing for<br/>
| "farmers" is less than satisfying, especially given the carnage<br/>
| at Nagashima.  Nobunaga had a clear vision of the religious<br/>
| obstacles that stood in his way, and he pursued them<br/>
| relentlessly.<br/>
|<br/>
| Finally, one comes away from this study with a much greater<br/>
| appreciation for Nobunaga's achievements, but without much of a<br/>
| sense of Nobunaga as a person.  Premodern sources are, of<br/>
| course, notoriously intractable about shedding light on<br/>
| individuals, and Mr. Lamers eschews at the outset a<br/>
| psychohistorical approach.  Nevertheless, more discussion of<br/>
| Nobunaga's character and times would have yielded a fuller<br/>
| portrait of him without requiring a foray into psychoanalysis.<br/>
| For instance, one wonders about the sixteenth century warrior<br/>
| family and its ethos: was it unusual for a younger brother to<br/>
| overshadow the eldest son, as Nobunaga did?  And was Nobunaga<br/>
| unusual in sometimes favoring collateral relatives over his own<br/>
| sons?  The case of Nobunaga's first marriage, dissolved over<br/>
| inter-familial politics, cries out for some discussion of<br/>
| marriage practices.  The role in the Araki Crisis of the<br/>
| Christian daimyo with their high regard for loyalty offers an<br/>
| opportunity to discuss this virtue in the context of late<br/>
| sixteenth century Japanese warrior society.  Despite some missed<br/>
| opportunities, however, Mr. Lamers has produced a comprehensive<br/>
| and illuminating account of Nobunaga's career and policies.<br/>
