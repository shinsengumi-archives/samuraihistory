<h3>Unlisted Kamon on Katana?</h3>
by <i>pttp2</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194600793">I have spend a lotta time searching through hundreds of Kamon and cannot find one like the one on the WW2 Katana I bought ftrom an elderly American WW2 soldier's family this weekend at a garage sale.  May I post a photo of it? It is kinda like the four squares in a circle Kamon but each of the four squares is split and the split line in each square points to the next square.  The line splitting each square is emerging from a tiny square hole in each of the larger squares but it comes out off center to the small square.  Looking at the katana with it held blade down the lines come out pointing to the ssquare on the left.  If anyone has seen this family crest or knows anything about It I would like to know more.  The Ka-mon is on the rear of the Kabuto-gane. <br/>

I have a passing interest in kamon. If you would like to post the <br/>
file to the yahoo groups site, I'd love to take a look and let you <br/>
know if I recognize it, or can track it down.<br/>

Thanks for sending the file to me. This is a kamon of the "me-yui" <br/>
type (&#30446;&#32080;&#12356; for those following along at home).<br/>
<br/>
This one in particular is called "ito-wa ni musubi yottsu-me" (&#31992;&#36650;&#12395;<br/>
&#32080;&#12403;&#22235;&#12388;&#30446;). If it didn't have the circle around it it would just be <br/>
called "musubi yottsu-me" (&#32080;&#12403;&#22235;&#12388;&#30446;).<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what family this is associated with, other than to say <br/>
that many of the me-yui types of kamon are related to the Sasaki <br/>
family of Shiga Prefecture (used to be called Oumi).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a little - and hope that others can provide even <br/>
more information for you.<br/>
