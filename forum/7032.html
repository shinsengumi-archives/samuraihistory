<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-678884653">I'm currently working on a peice of fiction set back in the time <br/>
period right before Oda Nobunaga rose to power.  I need direction <br/>
towards sites that focus on the raising of a young male in the samurai <br/>
caste, probably for a son of a hatamoto, as well as a site defining <br/>
the structure of the samurai caste.  The other thing that I am trying <br/>
to work out, I've seen references to both Shinto and Buddhism being <br/>
practiced by samurai, but nothing clearly stating which was prefered <br/>
and the time periods they were prefered in.<br/>
<br/>
The only other thing I was looking for, I've seen lots of pictures of <br/>
castle cities, however I am having a hard time finding a blueprint <br/>
type deal - A layout, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Any help anyone can give I would appreciate it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696177308">Zen Buddhism was the sect preferred by most samurai. The majority would <br/>
have also practiced both Shinto and Buddhism. The two religions <br/>
complement each other well.</div>

 </span></blockquote>If you're serious about the topic of (military) power and religion in <br/>
Japan the 16th century, the crucial text is Neil McMullin's BUDDHISM <br/>
AND THE STATE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY JAPAN.<br/>
This is actually a book that I would suggest to anybody. Is very <br/>
informative and well written - half of it is about Nobunaga.<br/>
