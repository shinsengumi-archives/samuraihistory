<h3>Looking for a warrior monk image.</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752245048">Hi, I'm looking for an image I remember seeing in a book once. It was <br/>
of a group of warrior monks running along a beach, I think, with a <br/>
wide assortment of polearms held up. I believe one was a large war <br/>
axe, an ono I think. The other polearms may have been similar to the <br/>
weapons that were supposed to be carried by Benkei. If anyone can <br/>
provide me with information about this painting or an image it would <br/>
be greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
