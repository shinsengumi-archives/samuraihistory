<h3>New Ninja documentary</h3>
by <i>ahelly69</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-413378247">Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
I received today a great notice from "Hanako" newsletter about a new <br/>
documentary about the Shinobi (Ninja).<br/>
<br/>
This proyect was made by Mr. Brandon Alvarez and is based in a deep <br/>
research and interviews with real ninja masters like Dr. Masaaki <br/>
Hatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Bud Malmstrom, Isamu Shiraishi between <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
I think will be a great and interesting material about one of the <br/>
most intriguing and misterious Arts from the feudal Japan.<br/>
<br/>
The website to inquire about the film is  www.shinobiwinds.com<br/>
and the website to require the Hanako Newsletter one of the most <br/>
comprensive and complete material about the Shinobi today is:<br/>
www.hanako.co.uk<br/>
<br/>
All the best to all,<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777490945">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
I would like to mention something more about this<br/>
documentary. There has been some discussion in the<br/>
past on the this forum regarding shinobi (ninja)<br/>
including comments by myself.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to stress that this documentary is not a<br/>
chessy wannabe ninja film, it is a serious project. I<br/>
have the rough cut and I like what i have seen. Even<br/>
though I am a senior ranked member of the bujinkan<br/>
which was famous in the 80's for its publication of<br/>
ninjutsu I am highly critical of ninjutsu wannabes.<br/>
Even to the point where I do not mention ninjutsu to<br/>
my students and it is never discussed, I even<br/>
advertise my dojo as Jujutsu to keep away form the<br/>
ninja element of my Org.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with Brandon last night on the phone, the dvd<br/>
should be available at the end of may.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case everyone quickly jumps in and starts<br/>
shouting ninja in black suit and masks then wait, the<br/>
film discusses the origin of that image and even<br/>
states it is not correct and that it was only used in<br/>
theatre for the pubic image, Brandon visited several<br/>
sites in Japan associated with ninjutsu, even visiting<br/>
the home of the famous 16th century Ninja Momochi<br/>
Sandayu and meeting with the current 19th generation<br/>
head of that family (the fmaily no longer practises<br/>
ninjutsu lol). There he was shown items that once<br/>
belonged to Momochi.<br/>
<br/>
Brandon is going to approach the tv networks to try<br/>
and get it aired for all to see eventually. But he<br/>
would prefer it if you bought it (of course)<br/>
<br/>
Brandon is a serious martial artist as well, and<br/>
together we have discussed future projects. One of<br/>
these will be hopefully started this year, with the<br/>
aid of several of my friends who have lived in Japan<br/>
for several years and study Koryu. The first 3<br/>
projects we are looking at are <br/>
<br/>
1. Famous Samurai swordsmen there schools and items<br/>
belonging or rewlating tot hem<br/>
2. Various Koryu - sort of a intro to each school and<br/>
what they do and who they are - 6 old schools have<br/>
been contacted and 5 have already said yes.<br/>
3. production of a kata from start to finish including<br/>
the making of the koshirae and polishing. (We have<br/>
access to one of the most senior polishers in Japan)<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well we are hoping to then do one on<br/>
armour production. <br/>
<br/>
If these projects do get off the ground I will be<br/>
asking members of this list whom I have noticed are<br/>
involved in various subjects relating to what we are<br/>
currently working on for help or advise.<br/>
<br/>
As for the shinobi documentary please reserve<br/>
judgement until you have seen it. Brandon has worked<br/>
for 3 years to produce something that is not like the<br/>
rest of the crap we have seen before.<br/>
<br/>
samples of the film are available to be viewed at<br/>
Brandons web page - www.shinobiwinds.com - (I say<br/>
samples they are still editing the film)<br/>

Who  speak of straight swords or estupids running in black pajamas?  <br/>
 <br/>
Is really important if Hayes is in the film? Masaaki Hatsumi is in the film and this is sufficient for me.   Each one is free to administer its knowledge as want.  <br/>
 <br/>
Or ¿it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by the Budo Taijutsu?  Hayes will be wrong in his vision,  but by him many people knew to Sensei and they went to Japon to study true Budo.  Malstrolm as example.<br/>
 <br/>
How important is Hayes for the Bujinkan?  The people who train in the Bujinkan, do that - I think- from heart not because they have a shorter curved saber, it does not matter it of form but it of fund.  <br/>
 <br/>
In my country we have a thought: "when the words are not better than the silence, is better to silence".  I recommend you see the film and train dogs, not martial arts. Not with a heart closed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As an Intelligence Officer, I'm trained to research,<br/>
evaluate, analyze, and recommend. The first decision<br/>
to make is "Is this worth my time?" Anyone in academia<br/>
will tell you that if you want to judge the quality of<br/>
someone's research, check out their sources. Hayes is<br/>
hardly a "source" of anything but Hollywood<br/>
misinformation. If this documentary is going to use<br/>
him as a source, then there's no reason for me to<br/>
waste my time clicking on the link, much less watching<br/>
the dang thing. And last I checked, Hayes learned from<br/>
Hatsumi. Ergo (That means "therefore"), I don't see<br/>
much reason to be excited about him, either. Let me<br/>
break it down: Hayes = fraud. Hatsumi taught Hayes<br/>
everything he knows. That makes Hatsumi a.....?<br/>
<br/>
Criminy, if people would put down the martial arts<br/>
magazines and pick up a history book, this crap<br/>
wouldn't keep coming back. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a CLUE what you're saying here. I'm assuming that<br/>
English isn't your first language. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > In my country we have a thought: "when the words are<br/>
> not better than the silence, is better to silence". <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What country are you from? I assume that research<br/>
standards there aren't up to par with what you'd<br/>
expect from REAL historical research, and not<br/>
Hollywood or martial arts fantasy, in the US or Japan.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I recommend you see the film and train dogs, not<br/>
> martial arts. Not with a heart closed.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would "logic" fit what you are looking for? Have you<br/>
read his "Secret Ninja Fighting Arts"? It's a joke.<br/>
Aside from the fact that the man claims to have lived<br/>
in Japan and speak Japanese and yet he can't romanize<br/>
anything correctly, nor does he understand the<br/>
simplest of phrases. As somebody who's studied the<br/>
Japanese language for over 10 years and Japanese<br/>
history for 22, I find it ridiculous to think that an<br/>
"expert" doesn't know how to pronounce/spell<br/>
vocabulary inherent to his topic. His "research" into<br/>
"ninja history" is comical at best--Japanese school<br/>
children could set him straight, yet he's a published<br/>
author? If I had the book in front of me now, I could<br/>
generate you a list 3 pages long--however, I can't<br/>
stomach the thought of reading that putrid excuse for<br/>
"research" again. <br/>
<br/>
I am particularly interested in what<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > is the specific Hollywood<br/>
> misinformation you attribute to Mr. Hayes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1. Straight "Ninja-to". Didn't exist. He is, as far as<br/>
I can tell, the proponent of the myth. He discusses it<br/>
in his books, and the use of it in movies seems to<br/>
date from around the same time he became a Hollywood<br/>
"consultant". Seen many Japanese produced movies<br/>
involving Shinobi/Ninja? You don't find any straight<br/>
swords. You don't see any in museums, you don't find<br/>
any in flea markets. They didn't exist.<br/>
<br/>
2. The "Black Uniform" phenomenon. Black outlines at<br/>
night, which is why a. modern special forces units do<br/>
not use black uniforms even at night, and b. the<br/>
Iga-Ueno Ninja museum specifically displays a blue<br/>
nightsuit for covert work. Hayes won't be seen outside<br/>
of his black pjs. It's well documented (Turnbull, for<br/>
one, if you'd like an English source) that the common<br/>
image of "ninja" in black stems from Kabuki/Bunraku<br/>
stage conventions. Both stage formats have assistants<br/>
on stage in black--their wearing of all black<br/>
indicates to the audience that they are "not seen",<br/>
and are to be ignored. When faced with the problem of<br/>
portraying assasins with mythical skills, playwrights<br/>
hit upon the idea of putting them in black, to<br/>
indicate they were "invisible". It stuck. <br/>
<br/>
Let's use some common sense here--you're a doshin in<br/>
Edo, and you see some guy walking down the street in<br/>
black kimono, kobakama, tabi, and a mask. Aren't you<br/>
going to be the least bit suspicious and take him in<br/>
for questioning? <br/>
<br/>
  If I am<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > reading your post<br/>
> correctly, you seem to indicate that Masaaki Hatsumi<br/>
> is a fraud.  Could you<br/>
> also present your basis for this as well?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Connection with Hayes? Both Hatsumi and Hayes may very<br/>
well be excellent martial artists. Historians they are<br/>
not, and it is my opinion--note I said opinion--that<br/>
"ninjutsu" is a marketing tool for them. <br/>
<br/>
 Who has<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Mr. Hayes or Mr. Hatsumi<br/>
> drefrauded and how? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anyone who believes their versions of history, for<br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
You also mentioned history<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > books.  What specific history<br/>
> books do you feel we should be reading so that "this<br/>
> crap wouldn't keep<br/>
> coming back" and while we are at it, to what<br/>
> specific "crap" are you<br/>
> referring?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anything not connected with "Martial Arts Weekly"<br/>
would be a start. Turnbull is an acceptable starting<br/>
place, I suppose, though his research is questioned by<br/>
many. I've got no problem with his research per<br/>
se--only his repetitiveness from book to book and his<br/>
horrible editing. But, he's a good place to start. AJ<br/>
Bryant is pretty good too. GB Sansom, Mary Berry,<br/>
Bottomley & Hopson...out of the group, only Turnbull<br/>
has put out a book on "ninja". Why? Because you can<br/>
get enough about special operations, assasinations,<br/>
etc. in Japanese history without focusing on the word<br/>
"ninja". The word is a later phenomenon--check out<br/>
texts from the Sengoku or before. Koyo Gunkan,<br/>
Shinchoukouki, etc. You might find "shinobi no mono",<br/>
but often enough you either get "kusa" (grass--an<br/>
allusion to their role as scouts) or simply a<br/>
description of the act, not the person who acted.<br/>
Ninja weren't some secret peasant society, either.<br/>
Hattori Hanzo? A samurai retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br/>
Yagyuu Jubei? From the Yagyuu family, a samurai family<br/>
from Iga, who controlled the fief around Ueno and<br/>
later served as kenjutsu instructors to the Tokugawa<br/>
bakufu. Sure, they probably trained in a wider arrange<br/>
of war-making skills than your average samurai, to<br/>
include subterfuge, stealth, etc., but is this any<br/>
different than military units/operatives who study the<br/>
same things now? Are Rangers or Green Berets a<br/>
mystical cult? No--they're military operatives with<br/>
different training and missions than your normal<br/>
soldier. What we call ninja now were no different than<br/>
that. Could you call a maid hired to pass information<br/>
she overhears in her ladies chamber a shinobi? Sure<br/>
you could. Does she necessarily have to be trained to<br/>
administer death 37 different ways with a chopstick?<br/>
Of course not. <br/>
<br/>
 Your post gives the impression that you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > have reseached Mr. Hayes<br/>
> and Mr. Hayes.  What methodolgy did you use for this<br/>
> reseach?  How much time<br/>
> was put into it?  What qualifications do you<br/>
> personally hold to make a valid<br/>
> assesment whether or not the activities of Mr. Hayes<br/>
> or Mr. Hatsumi are<br/>
> fraudlent?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You mean, other than a functioning brain and a working<br/>
level knowledge of Japanese and Japanese history?<br/>
None, I suppose. If you want to buy into the hype, be<br/>
my guest. However, this is a HISTORY email list, not a<br/>
martial arts list. I study Japanese HISTORY, not<br/>
martial arts. Hayes or Hatsumi may have excellent<br/>
techniques for arm locks or foot sweeps--however, when<br/>
you can't accurately reproduce historical facts that I<br/>
could ask of the 5 year old girl next door, then you<br/>
lack credibility. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, since you brought it up, for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > whom are you an<br/>
> intellegence officer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*I* didn't bring it up. Helly did. I simply responded<br/>
to him. As for who employs me, there's a "I'd tell<br/>
you, but I'd have to kill you" joke in there just<br/>
dying to get out, but I don't really think it's worth<br/>
it. I'm in the US Army stationed in Japan. No<br/>
relevance to this discussion whatsoever except in the<br/>
context in which Helly, making a personal attack,<br/>
addressed me, and I responded.  <br/>
<br/>
I also suggest that if you want to see ninja done in a<br/>
fun way, check out some Japanese movies. I've<br/>
mentioned "Owl's Castle" (Fukuro no shiro in<br/>
Japanese). Excellent flick that does play around with<br/>
the mystical side of ninjutsu, but for the most part<br/>
keeps things...somewhat real. <br/>

How important is Hayes for the Bujinkan?  The people<br/>

fully admit there is a chance it's not crap, but<br/>
again, any connection with Hayes makes it doubtful, at<br/>
least until I see it. Too many documentaries simply<br/>
try to capitalize on the hype (exhibit a-n: any<br/>
documentary made during the "Last Samurai" hype)<br/>
without doing any real research. <br/>

Bojustu DVD and I think he should be sued for what he<br/>
says in that DVD. Lie after Lie. Lets get one thing<br/>
straight - I know from your past quotes you know<br/>
nothing really about The Bujinkan or Hayes or even<br/>
Hatsumi. Hatsumi did not Teach Hayes everything he<br/>
knows, It has been discussed openly on Bujinkan forums<br/>
and its been pointed out that hayes has fabricated a<br/>
large amount of information, he is also credited with<br/>
inventing the straight sword theory. <br/>
<br/>
Just because Hayes is in it does not mean it is bad.<br/>
Again if you havent seen it why attack it.<br/>

happens to be in Budo Taijutsu, so what. I suggest<br/>
that you shut up , stop insuulting people you dont<br/>
know, stop insulting material you have yet to see. As<br/>
a moderator in this forum your behavior here is<br/>
disgusting. In the past you have told people to stop<br/>
such behavior and here you are - the sole cause of all<br/>
insults.<br/>
<br/>
If your noit interested in it you should just have<br/>
said I am not interested in the Ninja,, and I<br/>
personally wont be watching it.<br/>
<br/>
I am quite shocked at your comments and behavior,<br/>
especially as you  are a moderator - not the what we<br/>
would expect.<br/>

history mailing list is going to ruffle some feathers. The "history" (a<br/>
word used very lightly in this case) in his books is so incorrect that<br/>
it'd be laughable if it weren't for the fact that there are people out<br/>
there who buy in to it.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would *love* to make a documentary that pointed out the myths behind<br/>
these mystical "ninja" guys, but really who would watch it? The idea of<br/>
a black-clad ninja dropping 40-feet from a tree while raining ninja<br/>
stars down at the unsuspecting Uesugi Kenshin before removing his head<br/>
with a swift blade of his straight Ninja-To and then quickly<br/>
disappearing in a puff of smoke in a hell of a lot more exciting than<br/>
saying he died of stomach cancer.<br/>
 <br/>
If this documentary does indeed dispel the rumours, great. But surely<br/>
you can see why we might be sceptical...<br/>

That book is littered with serious inaccuracies,<br/>

Hayes has also tried to introduce Daoist. and tibetan<br/>

indirectly to claim its ninjutsu<br/>

He is also currently issuing menkyo in various ryuha<br/>

comment about the documentary. Did you produce this?<br/>
You're certainly defending it like you've got a vested<br/>
interest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese<br/>
history 101 and knows something now--but I'm<br/>
skeptical. <br/>
<br/>
If the documentary isn't built around him, than<br/>
lovely--hopefully it has some useful information. <br/>

project, and pay the production costs, I'd be more<br/>
than happy to. Of course, it'd be cheaper to just<br/>
translate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then<br/>
you'd take issue with my translation, I'm sure. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would "logic" fit what you are looking for? Have you<br/>
read his "Secret Ninja Fighting Arts"? It's a joke.<br/>
Aside from the fact that the man claims to have lived<br/>
in Japan and speak Japanese and yet he can't romanize<br/>
anything correctly, nor does he understand the<br/>
simplest of phrases. As somebody who's studied the<br/>
Japanese language for over 10 years and Japanese<br/>
history for 22, I find it ridiculous to think that an<br/>
"expert" doesn't know how to pronounce/spell<br/>
vocabulary inherent to his topic. His "research" into<br/>
"ninja history" is comical at best--Japanese school<br/>
children could set him straight, yet he's a published<br/>
author? If I had the book in front of me now, I could<br/>
generate you a list 3 pages long--however, I can't<br/>
stomach the thought of reading that putrid excuse for<br/>
"research" again. <br/>
<br/>
I am particularly interested in what<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > is the specific Hollywood<br/>
> misinformation you attribute to Mr. Hayes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1. Straight "Ninja-to". Didn't exist. He is, as far as<br/>
I can tell, the proponent of the myth. He discusses it<br/>
in his books, and the use of it in movies seems to<br/>
date from around the same time he became a Hollywood<br/>
"consultant". Seen many Japanese produced movies<br/>
involving Shinobi/Ninja? You don't find any straight<br/>
swords. You don't see any in museums, you don't find<br/>
any in flea markets. They didn't exist.<br/>
<br/>
2. The "Black Uniform" phenomenon. Black outlines at<br/>
night, which is why a. modern special forces units do<br/>
not use black uniforms even at night, and b. the<br/>
Iga-Ueno Ninja museum specifically displays a blue<br/>
nightsuit for covert work. Hayes won't be seen outside<br/>
of his black pjs. It's well documented (Turnbull, for<br/>
one, if you'd like an English source) that the common<br/>
image of "ninja" in black stems from Kabuki/Bunraku<br/>
stage conventions. Both stage formats have assistants<br/>
on stage in black--their wearing of all black<br/>
indicates to the audience that they are "not seen",<br/>
and are to be ignored. When faced with the problem of<br/>
portraying assasins with mythical skills, playwrights<br/>
hit upon the idea of putting them in black, to<br/>
indicate they were "invisible". It stuck. <br/>
<br/>
Let's use some common sense here--you're a doshin in<br/>
Edo, and you see some guy walking down the street in<br/>
black kimono, kobakama, tabi, and a mask. Aren't you<br/>
going to be the least bit suspicious and take him in<br/>
for questioning? <br/>
<br/>
  If I am<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > reading your post<br/>
> correctly, you seem to indicate that Masaaki Hatsumi<br/>
> is a fraud.  Could you<br/>
> also present your basis for this as well?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Connection with Hayes? Both Hatsumi and Hayes may very<br/>
well be excellent martial artists. Historians they are<br/>
not, and it is my opinion--note I said opinion--that<br/>
"ninjutsu" is a marketing tool for them. <br/>
<br/>
 Who has<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Mr. Hayes or Mr. Hatsumi<br/>
> drefrauded and how? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anyone who believes their versions of history, for<br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
You also mentioned history<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > books.  What specific history<br/>
> books do you feel we should be reading so that "this<br/>
> crap wouldn't keep<br/>
> coming back" and while we are at it, to what<br/>
> specific "crap" are you<br/>
> referring?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anything not connected with "Martial Arts Weekly"<br/>
would be a start. Turnbull is an acceptable starting<br/>
place, I suppose, though his research is questioned by<br/>
many. I've got no problem with his research per<br/>
se--only his repetitiveness from book to book and his<br/>
horrible editing. But, he's a good place to start. AJ<br/>
Bryant is pretty good too. GB Sansom, Mary Berry,<br/>
Bottomley & Hopson...out of the group, only Turnbull<br/>
has put out a book on "ninja". Why? Because you can<br/>
get enough about special operations, assasinations,<br/>
etc. in Japanese history without focusing on the word<br/>
"ninja". The word is a later phenomenon--check out<br/>
texts from the Sengoku or before. Koyo Gunkan,<br/>
Shinchoukouki, etc. You might find "shinobi no mono",<br/>
but often enough you either get "kusa" (grass--an<br/>
allusion to their role as scouts) or simply a<br/>
description of the act, not the person who acted.<br/>
Ninja weren't some secret peasant society, either.<br/>
Hattori Hanzo? A samurai retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br/>
Yagyuu Jubei? From the Yagyuu family, a samurai family<br/>
from Iga, who controlled the fief around Ueno and<br/>
later served as kenjutsu instructors to the Tokugawa<br/>
bakufu. Sure, they probably trained in a wider arrange<br/>
of war-making skills than your average samurai, to<br/>
include subterfuge, stealth, etc., but is this any<br/>
different than military units/operatives who study the<br/>
same things now? Are Rangers or Green Berets a<br/>
mystical cult? No--they're military operatives with<br/>
different training and missions than your normal<br/>
soldier. What we call ninja now were no different than<br/>
that. Could you call a maid hired to pass information<br/>
she overhears in her ladies chamber a shinobi? Sure<br/>
you could. Does she necessarily have to be trained to<br/>
administer death 37 different ways with a chopstick?<br/>
Of course not. <br/>
<br/>
 Your post gives the impression that you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > have reseached Mr. Hayes<br/>
> and Mr. Hayes.  What methodolgy did you use for this<br/>
> reseach?  How much time<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You mean, other than a functioning brain and a working<br/>
level knowledge of Japanese and Japanese history?<br/>
None, I suppose. If you want to buy into the hype, be<br/>
my guest. However, this is a HISTORY email list, not a<br/>
martial arts list. I study Japanese HISTORY, not<br/>
martial arts. Hayes or Hatsumi may have excellent<br/>
techniques for arm locks or foot sweeps--however, when<br/>
you can't accurately reproduce historical facts that I<br/>
could ask of the 5 year old girl next door, then you<br/>
lack credibility. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, since you brought it up, for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > whom are you an<br/>
> intellegence officer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*I* didn't bring it up. Helly did. I simply responded<br/>
to him. As for who employs me, there's a "I'd tell<br/>
you, but I'd have to kill you" joke in there just<br/>
dying to get out, but I don't really think it's worth<br/>
it. I'm in the US Army stationed in Japan. No<br/>
relevance to this discussion whatsoever except in the<br/>
context in which Helly, making a personal attack,<br/>
addressed me, and I responded.  <br/>
<br/>
I also suggest that if you want to see ninja done in a<br/>
fun way, check out some Japanese movies. I've<br/>
mentioned "Owl's Castle" (Fukuro no shiro in<br/>
Japanese). Excellent flick that does play around with<br/>
the mystical side of ninjutsu, but for the most part<br/>
keeps things...somewhat real. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-338686880">Hi nate<br/>
<br/>
you seem to have a fixation with attacking Hayes.<br/>
<br/>
thats your right.<br/>
<br/>
I have in my video collection many documantaries on<br/>
Ninja some conatining personalities such as Karl<br/>
Friday, Iam Bottomley. now thes eguys are respected<br/>
historians, however the documentaries are in some<br/>
cases full of additional crap, do we now ignore and<br/>
attack the rest of the commentry just because of say<br/>
one small section of the film.<br/>
<br/>
As for soley directing it as Helly. I thought this was<br/>
a public mail list. I have seen you comment on things<br/>
that were directed at others before.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose now if an email comes through that does not<br/>
have my name on it I am supposed to ignore it. Helly<br/>
is in the Bujinkan so am I, he hasnt seen the fdilm I<br/>
have. <br/>
<br/>
I have supported both of you and also told you where I<br/>
think you are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I like you dont think Hayes is a source of good info,<br/>
but there are others on that film, including manaka <br/>
fumio, a japanese who has researched Ninjutsu history.<br/>
<br/>
How about we leave this now until its out and people<br/>
know what they are talking (or maybe think they do)<br/>
have seen it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And if you'll read my reply, it was to Helly, not to<br/>
you--and was posted before yours was, so I couldn't<br/>
have read yours, now could I? <br/>
<br/>
However, any connection with Hayes certainly SUGGESTS<br/>
that the research is questionable, at best. I don't<br/>
know Helly--and I've seen too many ninja fanatics here<br/>
to accept his say-so that this is legit. Forgive me,<br/>
but with a connection to Hayes it's guilty until<br/>
proven innocent. I didn't reply to you in the same<br/>
manner, as you've been around on the board, post<br/>
intelligently, and don't strike me as the "wannabe"<br/>
ninja type. If you're endorsing this, then fine--I'll<br/>
fully admit there is a chance it's not crap, but<br/>
again, any connection with Hayes makes it doubtful, at<br/>
least until I see it. Too many documentaries simply<br/>
try to capitalize on the hype (exhibit a-n: any<br/>
documentary made during the "Last Samurai" hype)<br/>
without doing any real research. <br/>

martial arts. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Just because Hayes is in it does not mean it is bad.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I've said in another reply to you, I've made 1 post<br/>
regarding the documentary. I've REPLIED to many posts<br/>
now with comments about Hayes. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learn to attribute the correct insult to the correct<br/>
person, my friend. Helly said what you quoted above to<br/>
ME, not the other way around. I quoted it in response<br/>
to him to ask him what he was talking about. The only<br/>
thing I've said insulting to Helly, possibly, is<br/>
questioning his grasp of the English language--and<br/>
since he's a native of another country, it's not meant<br/>
to be insulting. I simply had no idea what he said in<br/>
a certain passage. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I am quite shocked at your comments and behavior,<br/>
> especially as you  are a moderator - not the what we<br/>
> would expect.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, learn to recognize who is typing what. Shall I<br/>
repost Helly's reply to me for you? Here you go: <br/>
<br/>
"Or �it is that perhaps did You more than Hayes by the<br/>
Budo Taijutsu? I recommend you see the film and train<br/>
dogs, not martial arts. Not with a heart closed."<br/>
<br/>
I'm still not sure I understand what the heck he's<br/>
talking about, at least in the first sentence. If<br/>
you're both members of the Budo Taijutsu, then please<br/>
set your fellow martial artist straight about Hayes,<br/>
for one. Secondly, you can pass on to him that both of<br/>
my dogs are trained, though not in martial arts. Sit,<br/>
down, stay...these they can do. <br/>
<br/>
NOW, if there is any further issue with the above<br/>
quote, then please direct it to me offline. <br/>

I'm not attacking it. The comments in the post were<br/>
specifcally in response to Oniyama's pointed questions<br/>
regarding my assertions against Hayes. I responded,<br/>
point by point. If the documentary has the correct<br/>
info, then a point in it's favor; if it employes<br/>
Hayes, than that's a point against. Evens out so far. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396189175">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I have no worries with people attacking ayes for his<br/>
bad info, I have doe it for year, my annoyance here is<br/>
a moderator who has jumped on people in the past for<br/>
being arrogant about info posted for the rest of us to<br/>
enjoy is doing just that - attacking it in quite an<br/>
offensive manner.<br/>
<br/>
Hayes can **** my **** for the bad info he has put<br/>
out. His book Ninja secrets is fine (not good just<br/>
fine) but in that he implies he lived in Japan, his<br/>
first trip I believe was for 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I have the discovery program on Ninja. biggest load of<br/>
crap I have seen, its a disgrace.<br/>
<br/>
In english there is little to be read on Ninja and<br/>
what they really were. Turnbulls first book was fine,<br/>
buthe concentrated on writing about samurai who did<br/>
one feet of ninja behavior once in there life, he did<br/>
not explore the history properly. Then his 2nd book on<br/>
ninja was a joke, even he after all these years of<br/>
people in and out of the martial arts saying no<br/>
straight swords - went and printed just that.<br/>
<br/>
One person has for the first tiem tried to gain a<br/>
little info for us all, it is mainly directed towards<br/>
the (supposed) history within the bujinkan but covers<br/>
general ninja info, including that black suit thing as<br/>
complete crap and stating what it really is.<br/>
<br/>
Look what happens - people who havent seen it attack<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Very unfair.<br/>

Hayes in a samurai<br/>
history mailing list is going to ruffle some feathers.<br/>
The "history" (a<br/>
word used very lightly in this case) in his books is<br/>
so incorrect that<br/>
it'd be laughable if it weren't for the fact that<br/>
there are people out<br/>
there who buy in to it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  > insult it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would *love* to make a documentary that pointed out<br/>
the myths behind<br/>
these mystical "ninja" guys, but really who would<br/>
watch it? The idea of<br/>
a black-clad ninja dropping 40-feet from a tree while<br/>
raining ninja<br/>
stars down at the unsuspecting Uesugi Kenshin before<br/>
removing his head<br/>
with a swift blade of his straight Ninja-To and then<br/>
quickly<br/>
disappearing in a puff of smoke in a hell of a lot<br/>
more exciting than<br/>
saying he died of stomach cancer.<br/>
 <br/>
If this documentary does indeed dispel the rumours,<br/>
great. But surely<br/>
you can see why we might be sceptical...<br/>

<br/>
I do not have anything to lose if this documentary<br/>
does turn out ot be crap and loses every penny<br/>

<br/>
My point is that you just attacked it for no reason<br/>
when you have not seen it.<br/>
<br/>
if you can find one single accurate documentary that<br/>
is genuine that was produced in Japana nd you can find<br/>
the owners of the film, I think i can get some one to<br/>
translate and narrate it. It is possible I can also<br/>
find someone to fund it<br/>
<br/>
however until someone who knows better (maybe yourself<br/>
Nate) then we have to make do with a little better<br/>
each time. So far the only nina documentaries I have<br/>

choked at the crap they spouted.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since when has skepticism meant "slam it as much as I<br/>
can"? I'll slam Hayes all day--I've, to date, made 1<br/>
comment about the documentary. Did you produce this?<br/>
You're certainly defending it like you've got a vested<br/>
interest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese<br/>
history 101 and knows something now--but I'm<br/>
skeptical. <br/>
<br/>
If the documentary isn't built around him, than<br/>
lovely--hopefully it has some useful information. <br/>

project, and pay the production costs, I'd be more<br/>
than happy to. Of course, it'd be cheaper to just<br/>
translate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then<br/>
you'd take issue with my translation, I'm sure. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Again, you're doggedly defending the documentary when<br/>
I'm not attacking it. The comments in the post were<br/>
specifcally in response to Oniyama's pointed questions<br/>
regarding my assertions against Hayes. I responded,<br/>
point by point. If the documentary has the correct<br/>
info, then a point in it's favor; if it employes<br/>
Hayes, than that's a point against. Evens out so far. <br/>

HI<br/>
<br/>
I do not have anything to lose if this documentary<br/>
does turn out ot be crap and loses every penny<br/>
invested in it.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that you just attacked it for no reason<br/>
when you have not seen it.<br/>
<br/>
if you can find one single accurate documentary that<br/>
is genuine that was produced in Japana nd you can find<br/>
the owners of the film, I think i can get some one to<br/>
translate and narrate it. It is possible I can also<br/>
find someone to fund it<br/>
<br/>
however until someone who knows better (maybe yourself<br/>
Nate) then we have to make do with a little better<br/>
each time. So far the only nina documentaries I have<br/>
seen are on things ike dicovery and I could have<br/>
choked at the crap they spouted.<br/>

You're certainly defending it like you've got a vested<br/>
interest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese<br/>
history 101 and knows something now--but I'm<br/>
skeptical. <br/>
<br/>

lovely--hopefully it has some useful information. <br/>

translate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then<br/>

comments to Oniyama were about HAYES, not the<br/>
documentary. And yes, we can go on about this all day<br/>

people misquote/misattribute my comments. <br/>
<br/>
Especially when they take an insult used against me,<br/>

anyone who publishes blatant crap about Japanese history with an intent -- or <br/>
even a disinterested lack of concern -- in misleading and lying to his <br/>
readership. I also have a great apathy for frauds.<br/>
<br/>
So why SHOULDN'T we, then, have it in for that man?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. But the problem is, it's the bad apple theory. One bad apple spoils a whole <br/>
barrel. One piece of crap in a documentary or video makes the whole thing <br/>
suspect. It's best not to put the crap in to start with.<br/>

contributor to the documentary was a famous Holocaust-debunker, I wouldn't have <br/>
to see the video to know that it's likely crap. Or, at least, it contains more <br/>
crap (in this case, any unit over "one") than I care to see.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you get it? In anything that claims to be a *real* documentary or history <br/>
of ninja, *mentioning* Hayes can be done -- in the context of fraud and total <br/>
bogusness. But to use him as one of the sources and actually present him as one <br/>
automatically makes the film suspect.<br/>
<br/>
It's the job of the producers to make people want to see it, and as a historian <br/>
specializing in Japan's military history, I find the inclusion of Hayes in *any* <br/>
documentary suspect. I have no interest in seeing it. It's not *my* fault I <br/>
don't trust him or anything connected with him. It's the producers who made that <br/>
choice.<br/>

ninjas are market. the target usually is between 10-20 years. they sell<br/>
good in any form (see under power rangers or ninja turtles). and they<br/>
generate a decent amount of hype when paired with martial arts in a<br/>

<br/>
now, my question is:<br/>
this Hayes, is an archeologist or a historian or a student of martial arts<br/>
who is genuinely interested in ninjas and published freely his own results<br/>
on internet making sure he makes unassuming statements on ninjas in a<br/>

I never met Hayes and he is nothing to me.  I agree with Paul in the reference about Hayes. The think that I can´t understand is how an offensive forist like Ledbetter could be "moderator".  The function of the moderator is the "moderation"! he must be the equilibrium in the relation of several people who share the same interests in a forum, ins´t?<br/>
 <br/>
And by the way I´m not guilty for not speak english.  Is the spanish a easy idiom to you?<br/>
In the Bujinkan the idiom is not really important (Thank´s God!)<br/>
 <br/>
Really which is the problem with the black pijamas? ( I dislike guys in black pijamas) is because they are for the world running and saying "I´m a ninja... I´m a ninja!" is for that?<br/>
 <br/>
This is like the guy who run for the world saying "I´m a IO!... I´m IO!!!"  the same thing.<br/>
 <br/>
I´m don´t know how are the things in your country but in my country if you say "I´m a IO" the consecuences coul be bad... here the situation is real.<br/>

to accept his say-so that this is legit. Forgive me,<br/>

intelligently, and don't strike me as the "wannabe"<br/>
ninja type. If you're endorsing this, then fine--I'll<br/>
fully admit there is a chance it's not crap, but<br/>
again, any connection with Hayes makes it doubtful, at<br/>
least until I see it. Too many documentaries simply<br/>
try to capitalize on the hype (exhibit a-n: any<br/>
documentary made during the "Last Samurai" hype)<br/>
without doing any real research. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934467679">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reponses.  I appreciate the clarifications.  I started<br/>
training in the Bujinkan in the early/mid 80's.  I have no illusions about<br/>
Stephen Hayes.  While I would certainly agree that he had his own<br/>
interpretation of Ninjutsu, he did bring the art to the United States in a<br/>
big way.  So let's give him some credit.  One can certainly see him going<br/>
his own direction in "Ninja Realms of Power".  While I stop short of calling<br/>
him a fraud, I do think it wise that any information from him be cross<br/>
checked.  I had a long gap in trianing and came back a few years ago.  When<br/>
I did, I found that there were many holes in my knowledge and many peices of<br/>
infomrtion I found to be incorrect.  Some of that, I suppose could be<br/>
attributed to Hayes.  However, I think that at the time a good portion of it<br/>
was that we just plain do not live in Japan and get impressions (not just<br/>
from Hayes) and 2nd and 3rd hand information.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, for what it is worth, Paul, your book "History of the Schools of<br/>
the Bujinkan" is required reading for my students.<br/>

I think the issue over the past 24 hours might be that people were <br/>

well be an excellent martial artist and instructor, but as far as <br/>
scholarship goes, he is a fiction writer at best.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917444844">Let's beat the dead horse briefly:<br/>
<br/>
1. Traditional Ninja were supposedly SECRET agents and HIDDEN assassins. <br/>
That means we don't know much about the real thing, it was all secret.<br/>
2. Since there were no open and aboveboard schools, there is no way to <br/>
prove descent from a real school.<br/>
3. Ninja = money, either for Hollywood or for martial arts schools. <br/>
Motive for fraud.<br/>
4. I can't imagine a group of assassins allowing people to spread their <br/>
REAL information freely, so the group is either dead or non-existent.<br/>
5. The burden of proof is not on us, it's on the so-called Ninja masters <br/>
who have never presented sufficient proof any anything. When I was much <br/>
younger I looked at some of that, I don't need to hurt my eyes anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Of course these questions are all screening questions for the REAL NINJA <br/>
SCHOOL tm. If you want to join please send $50,000 to 1600 Pennsylvania <br/>

I'm not attacking it. The comments in the post were<br/>
specifcally in response to Oniyama's pointed questions<br/>
regarding my assertions against Hayes. I responded,<br/>
point by point. If the documentary has the correct<br/>
info, then a point in it's favor; if it employes<br/>
Hayes, than that's a point against. Evens out so far. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I hear someone has made a documentary about Auschwitz and a key publicized <br/>
contributor to the documentary was a famous Holocaust-debunker, I wouldn't have <br/>
to see the video to know that it's likely crap. Or, at least, it contains more <br/>
crap (in this case, any unit over "one") than I care to see.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you get it? In anything that claims to be a *real* documentary or history <br/>
of ninja, *mentioning* Hayes can be done -- in the context of fraud and total <br/>
bogusness. But to use him as one of the sources and actually present him as one <br/>
automatically makes the film suspect.<br/>
<br/>
It's the job of the producers to make people want to see it, and as a historian <br/>
specializing in Japan's military history, I find the inclusion of Hayes in *any* <br/>
documentary suspect. I have no interest in seeing it. It's not *my* fault I <br/>
don't trust him or anything connected with him. It's the producers who made that <br/>
choice.<br/>

good martial artist, but no, that's not what people<br/>
remember me saying, even though they can go back and<br/>
check. As far as him being a great guy, I doubt<br/>
it--but then again, that's my personal opinion of<br/>
someone who'd "invent" history and mislead people for<br/>
personal gain. I'm sure he could teach me a thing or<br/>
two about choke holds, but as stated before, the<br/>
Japanese kindergardener next door to me could teach<br/>
him a thing or two about history. <br/>

that's your issue, not mine. I didn't personally<br/>
insult you, despite your insults to me. Crap is crap<br/>
and bunk is bunk and a hack historian is a hack<br/>
historian, and as far as history goes Hayes is all of<br/>
the above, and immediately puts anything he's in<br/>

have said the same things about Hayes as I have, for<br/>
crying out loud why is this such an issue for you? <br/>
<br/>
As for English, I wasn't criticizing you for not<br/>

better than my Spanish. However, several places in<br/>
your post to me I couldn't understand what you are<br/>

Does "IO" stand for Intelligence Officer? I didn't<br/>
bring that up--YOU DID. You also insulted me by<br/>
talking about training dogs, and not the martial arts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THIS ISN'T A MARTIAL ARTS LIST. IT'S A JAPANESE<br/>
HISTORY LIST, FOCUSED ON THE TIME FRAME FROM 1100 TO<br/>
1868, WITH SOME VARIANCE ALLOWED. If Hayes or anyone<br/>
else is going to be brought up, most of us here will<br/>

create something totally unique. This can be found in<br/>
almost all aspects of Japanese industry and culture --<br/>
and it is nowhere more apparent than in the pottery<br/>
born in Kyushu. Of course, ancient kilns dating back<br/>
to the dawn of Japanese civilization are to be found<br/>
on Kyushu, yet it wasn't until the late 1590s with the<br/>
influx of Korean potters -- in the "Pottery Wars" --<br/>
that the island's pottery really matured. <br/>
 <br/>
Those Korean potters -- many of whom became Japanese<br/>
citizens -- brought with them new kiln designs, the<br/>
ability to create porcelain, and ash glazes that have<br/>
delighted ceramic enthusiasts ever since. The glory of<br/>
Kyushu's ceramic art from the Edo Period (1603-1867)<br/>
to the early Showa Era is now on display in Tokyo at<br/>
the Nihon Mingeikan (Japan Folk Crafts Museum) until<br/>
June 26 in an exhibition titled "Ceramics in Kyushu." <br/>
<br/>
Those who have not yet been to the Mingeikan, are<br/>
missing one of Japan's most charming museums. Its<br/>
intimate and timeless atmosphere is the perfect place<br/>
to discover the beauty of folk arts, and it's a<br/>
pilgrimage any lover of Japanese art should make no<br/>
matter what exhibition they have on offer. Anyone with<br/>
an interest in traditional ceramic art will be<br/>
captivated by this exhibition that introduces visitors<br/>
to the many styles of pottery fired in Kyushu,<br/>
including Imari and Karatsu from Saga, Hasami from<br/>
Nagasaki, Koishiwara from Fukuoka, Onta from Oita,<br/>
Shodai from Kumamoto, and Naeshirogawa and Tanegashima<br/>
from Kagoshima. <br/>
<br/>
There are two basic kinds of ceramics in antique<br/>
Kyushu -- pottery fired by part-time farmers/part-time<br/>
potters creating vessels for daily life, and Tea<br/>
pottery fired originally for daimyo, with the style<br/>
that best represents the latter category being<br/>
Karatsu-yaki.<br/>
<br/>
Karatsu is a port city in Saga Prefecture which is<br/>
very close to Korea. In eastern Japan, the generic<br/>
term to describe pottery is setomono, the Kyushu<br/>
equivalent is karatsumono, showing just how important<br/>
this potting center was, and, of course, still is. <br/>
<br/>
The noborigama (chambered climbing kiln) was<br/>
introduced from Korea to Japan -- via Karatsu -- in<br/>
the 17th century and forever changed the ceramic<br/>
landscape. It allowed various glazed wares such as<br/>
madara-garatsu (speckled straw-ash glaze),<br/>
chosen-garatsu (Korean-style, two-tone glazing),<br/>
e-garatsu (painted) or kuro-garatsu (black) to be<br/>
created on these shores. <br/>
<br/>
Karatsu became important in the tea world with many<br/>
tea-ceremony devotees considering it one of the top<br/>
four styles along with Raku, Ido and Hagi. An<br/>
unassuming e-garatsu jar in the exhibition aptly<br/>
illustrates the philosophy of the "unknown craftsman,"<br/>
made famous by mingei founder Yanagi Soetsu<br/>
(1889-1961) -- its fully rounded tranquil form and<br/>
spontaneous iron-brush rendition of reeds are the<br/>
epitome of Japanese folk pottery. Originally it was<br/>
used as a salt-cellar, yet is now more commonly used<br/>
as a mizusashi (fresh water jar) in a Way of Tea<br/>
gathering. <br/>
<br/>
One of the outstanding pieces in the exhibition is a<br/>
large 18th-century Shodai-yaki tea jar. Shodai-yaki<br/>
takes its name from Mount Shodai (Arao City, Kumamoto<br/>
Prefecture) where the clay has a high iron-content and<br/>
is perfect for sturdy pottery. <br/>
<br/>
Over the iron-rich clay, a dark-brown iron glaze is<br/>
applied, and then a rice-straw ash-glaze is either<br/>
ladled or dramatically dripped on, here creating an<br/>
unintentional abstract rendering of birdlike figures. <br/>
<br/>
Representative of Kyushu forms is a large spouted<br/>
vessel called an unsuke of which there are a few<br/>
outstanding examples on show. One was made at<br/>
Koishiwara and has a wild white-and-yellow splash<br/>
glazing over the base iron glaze; it was originally<br/>
used to hold soy sauce, vinegar, or sake. Another<br/>
unsuke has a magical overlapping of a green glaze with<br/>
tinges of blue over the iron glaze. It's almost<br/>
impossible to find potters able to create this effect<br/>
today due to changes in materials and methods of<br/>
firing. <br/>
<br/>
Unsuke were commonly used in Kyushu households until<br/>
the early Showa Era, mini-versions of them called a<br/>
karakara are still used for pouring shochu throughout<br/>
Kyushu.<br/>
<br/>
World-famous Imari porcelains are more than adequately<br/>
represented here. There are several large subdued<br/>
underglaze blue landscape bowls -- one of which is a<br/>
masterpiece in terms of design, color and the balance<br/>
of the two -- and also the more colorful underglaze<br/>
blue with overglaze enamel paintings. <br/>
<br/>
Korean potter Ri Sampei (1579-1655) located a cache of<br/>
suitable porcelain clay in the early 1600s in Northern<br/>
Kyushu and Japan, and, finally, was able to produce<br/>
porcelain. The neighboring port town of Imari was<br/>
where many 17th-century Dutch merchants loaded up<br/>
their ships with Arita-made porcelain, so the term<br/>
Imari and Arita wares are often interchangeable. <br/>
<br/>
No one piece in the exhibition is as haunting as a<br/>
17th-century Tataro-yaki burial urn from Saga. It's<br/>
crudely formed with a somber dark brown body and has a<br/>
maze-like coil motif; giving the whole a gothic feel.<br/>
<br/>
By quietly observing the outer strength and inner calm<br/>
of all the pieces on display, a serene majestic mood<br/>
will guide you back home to where (hopefully) your<br/>
daily utensils offer you not only usefulness, yet also<br/>
take you to some place where beauty and life can<br/>
intertwine.<br/>

located in the funky old Okuno Building. It was built<br/>
in 1932 and has housed many famous artists and<br/>
writers. Since the decrepit elevator only goes to the<br/>
sixth and seventh floors (Ecru + HM is on the fourth),<br/>
it's better idea to take the stairs -- you'll be<br/>
surprised at how short they are. Then you can also pop<br/>

  HI<br/>
<br/>
  I do not have anything to lose if this documentary<br/>
  does turn out ot be crap and loses every penny<br/>
  invested in it.<br/>
<br/>
  My point is that you just attacked it for no reason<br/>
  when you have not seen it.<br/>
<br/>
  if you can find one single accurate documentary that<br/>
  is genuine that was produced in Japana nd you can find<br/>
  the owners of the film, I think i can get some one to<br/>
  translate and narrate it. It is possible I can also<br/>
  find someone to fund it<br/>
<br/>
  however until someone who knows better (maybe yourself<br/>
  Nate) then we have to make do with a little better<br/>
  each time. So far the only nina documentaries I have<br/>
  seen are on things ike dicovery and I could have<br/>
  choked at the crap they spouted.<br/>

<br/>
  Since when has skepticism meant "slam it as much as I<br/>
  can"? I'll slam Hayes all day--I've, to date, made 1<br/>
  comment about the documentary. Did you produce this?<br/>
  You're certainly defending it like you've got a vested<br/>
  interest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese<br/>
  history 101 and knows something now--but I'm<br/>
  skeptical. <br/>
<br/>
  If the documentary isn't built around him, than<br/>
  lovely--hopefully it has some useful information. <br/>

<br/>
  If you're willing to pay me to quit my job, fund the<br/>
  project, and pay the production costs, I'd be more<br/>
  than happy to. Of course, it'd be cheaper to just<br/>
  translate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then<br/>
  you'd take issue with my translation, I'm sure. <br/>

I know nothing about how it will be distributed - this<br/>

him. <br/>
<br/>
I am not involved in the ninja project, I never was<br/>
and I will never be. It was started and 95% finished<br/>
before I was introduced to Brandon.<br/>
<br/>
I think your reading something i didnt say.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other projects, I have contacts and sources<br/>
in Japan that can make other projects he wants to do<br/>
happen. Because of my Contacts I have agreed to help<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
As for other comments by myself I dont think i once<br/>
saiid hayes was a viable source of info, in fact read<br/>
them and you will see I wrote against him agreeing<br/>
with Nate.<br/>
<br/>
My gripe was people were attacking it because Hayes<br/>
was in it so it had to be bad. If youhavent seen it<br/>
then you havent a clue whats in it.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example of that type of attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Lets make one on armour, lets have Anthony Bryant who<br/>
in my opinion is possibly the most knwoedgeable person<br/>
we could talk to in the west on the history and<br/>
production of Katchu. I bet you would all love this. I<br/>
think it would be a great idea myself, then lets get<br/>
hayes or Harunaka Hoshino in there wearing armour<br/>
showing what it looks like when worn by a man.<br/>
<br/>
Now by some peoples attitudes it has to be crap<br/>
without a doubt, purely because one person is int here<br/>
we dont like.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day if your not interested in any<br/>
film dont watch it. if you are watch it.<br/>
<br/>
and just to claify. I was never involved in any wany<br/>
and never will be involved in any way with the<br/>
production and distribution. If you can find a post<br/>
where I say that i was I will appologise. Just because<br/>
I spoke to the maker and got some info does not make<br/>
me a part of it.<br/>

If these projects do get off the ground I will be<br/>
asking members of this list whom I have noticed are<br/>
involved in various subjects relating to what we are<br/>

<br/>
-In the above you say "we" alot, sounds like you are<br/>
involved in this project and 3 or 4 future projects as<br/>
well, no wonder you defend it so much.<br/>

  HI<br/>
<br/>
  I do not have anything to lose if this documentary<br/>
  does turn out ot be crap and loses every penny<br/>
  invested in it.<br/>
<br/>
  My point is that you just attacked it for no reason<br/>
  when you have not seen it.<br/>
<br/>
  if you can find one single accurate documentary that<br/>
  is genuine that was produced in Japana nd you can<br/>
find<br/>
  the owners of the film, I think i can get some one<br/>
to<br/>
  translate and narrate it. It is possible I can also<br/>
  find someone to fund it<br/>
<br/>
  however until someone who knows better (maybe<br/>
yourself<br/>
  Nate) then we have to make do with a little better<br/>
  each time. So far the only nina documentaries I have<br/>
  seen are on things ike dicovery and I could have<br/>
  choked at the crap they spouted.<br/>

<br/>
  Since when has skepticism meant "slam it as much as<br/>
I<br/>
  can"? I'll slam Hayes all day--I've, to date, made 1<br/>
  comment about the documentary. Did you produce this?<br/>
  You're certainly defending it like you've got a<br/>
vested<br/>
  interest. Perhaps Hayes has finally taken Japanese<br/>
  history 101 and knows something now--but I'm<br/>
  skeptical. <br/>
<br/>
  If the documentary isn't built around him, than<br/>
  lovely--hopefully it has some useful information. <br/>

<br/>
  If you're willing to pay me to quit my job, fund the<br/>
  project, and pay the production costs, I'd be more<br/>
  than happy to. Of course, it'd be cheaper to just<br/>
  translate a Japanese documentary. Of course, then<br/>
  you'd take issue with my translation, I'm sure. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tony, I hate to say it, but people are going to keep<br/>
missing the point. It appears, with a few exceptions,<br/>
that on this topic we're going to stay divided into<br/>
two camps: the historians, and the martial artists. As<br/>
long as everyone recognizes where they belong, then we<br/>
can move on. <br/>
<br/>
Me? I'm a skeptic--that's my nature. If I saw a<br/>
documentary on Korean/Japanese history  that listed<br/>
Wong-Tak Hong as a source, I'd avoid it like the<br/>
plague simply based on that. Of course it's entirely<br/>
possible that he's simply the "dissenting view" in the<br/>
documentary and that more credible historians are<br/>
given the lion's share of the screen time, but even<br/>
acknowledging him as a small source is extremely<br/>
questionable. Same with Hayes. <br/>
<br/>
This may end up being a great documentary, with Hayes<br/>
as a minor player--fine, and good for it. However, if<br/>
it wants viewership in the larger history community,<br/>
and not just in the martial arts community, then<br/>
sources like Hayes are a detriment. <br/>

No one's going to admit to it, but some people can't<br/>
get over their romantic first-notions of "ninja". I<br/>
thought they were cool when I was 5 also, but because<br/>
there is so much misinformation out there, I cringe<br/>
whenever the topic comes up now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811937549">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I just know that I'm going to regret this but...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    i agree.i think that discrediting someones project just because of <br/>
>    the involvement of mr hayes,is straight ignorant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, but no, it is not. <br/>
<br/>
This is just how academic rigor works, that's all. In this case for<br/>
example, say that you are aware that Hayes' word is, and let's be<br/>
generous here "unreliable", and that you do not know the other quoted<br/>
sources, how the heck are you then supposed to judge what these other<br/>
people say? I'm sorry, if one of your sources is severely flawed and the<br/>
others are unknown to you, then you have to ignore the lot. Unless of<br/>
course you have the time to become an authority yourself. And let's face<br/>
it most of us don't, so we have to make judgements about the sources we<br/>
have access to. For example I don't speak or read Japanese, which means<br/>
that I have to read a variety of English sources just to make sure, that<br/>
a "fact" is generally supported by those who have "earned" my respect.<br/>
Hayes and his supernatural, future viewing, PJ wearing wonder warriors<br/>
firmly belongs in the land of "wu-wu-yibble", not that of the rising<br/>
sun!<br/>
<br/>
There are images of history that become rooted in the popular culture,<br/>
which are quite simply, wrong. For example the commonly heard/seen term<br/>
"chainmail". It doesn't make them right simply because a lot of people<br/>
don't know their history well enough, nor is it their fault. Ninja are<br/>
one of these images, and it is down to students of history to popularise<br/>
the "truth" (as far as we know it, that is).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >oh,by the way the <br/>
>    warriors creed sure is a great thing to quote :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh give me a break, for if by the warrior's creed, you mean "Bushido",<br/>
you need to get a grip, when real warriors go to war, there's only two<br/>
objectives victory and survival. Death before dishonour only applies<br/>
when death and dishonour is guaranteed. The "way of the warrior" belongs<br/>
to the era of "wasn't it wonderful way back when" and not to the age of<br/>
battles.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, but only because I do not have a clue who Manaka is, see my<br/>
statement about sources above. And no, I don't have the time to read<br/>
him, I have a backlog of books a mile high and a seemingly equally long<br/>
cue of students to teach.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello people, TV companies exist to make money, not to make historically<br/>
accurate documentaries, especially small outfits, and even if their<br/>
intentions were perfect, they probably can't afford to get it right. You<br/>
need big bucks to take the time, and do the travelling, pay experts for<br/>
interviews etc. to get it anywhere near right. And unless this is a big<br/>
budget, or a dilettante production with a rich patron with time to<br/>
spend, I don't hold out much hope for its academic rigor. I know how<br/>
these things go, I'm about to do a tiny, tiny part in a god awful low<br/>
budget documentary series of ten 60 minute programs for the Discovery<br/>
Channel*, and believe me accuracy is the last thing on the producer's<br/>
mind. He wants it cheap and he wants it last week! Many years ago I, for<br/>
my sins also did a thing for Channel 4, which was no better.<br/>
<br/>
*BTW the program isn't about history, but speculative disaster<br/>
scenarios, eek!<br/>
<br/>
Now if they had folks like Varley, Friday, Bottomley or our old pal<br/>
Tony, then maybe it would be worth watching.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I go hide from the ninja's wroth now:-)<br/>

peer review.  You put out your hypothesis/theory/work and get <br/>
feedback. If it sucks, you go back and fix it.  It is nothing to cry <br/>

10 mins on how samurai armor was made from bamboo. And he did all his <br/>

I do not remember what college he was from, but in my eyes he soiled <br/>
their reputation. It reminds me of an incident that happened to me in <br/>
MA. I was in the amrory getting pictures of a daisho and some early <br/>
Edo period armor for a project. The tour guide had a group with him, <br/>
and he pointed out the armor, while I was writing down some notes. He <br/>
said that samurai armor was made from bamboo since there was not alor <br/>
of good iron in Japan (I wonder how they got all those yari, katana <br/>
and kabuto.) so armor was made from bamboo. Clearly he was wrong, <br/>
escpecially when the information plate next to the armor said it was <br/>
made from metal and silk. So in the end I do not listen to tour <br/>
guides much, I always check and double check info and thats that.<br/>
<br/>
So in the end BA,MA or PHD someone can be wrong.<br/>
