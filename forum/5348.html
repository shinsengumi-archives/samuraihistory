family? Maybe it's just very "traditional"...or maybe<br/>
he also had that name, but used the "Katsu" from the<br/>

It does not appear that 信頼 was one of the names used by Katsuyori. <br/>
There was a Takeda Nobuyori, son of Nobutake 信武 - but Nobutake died <br/>
in 1359 so this Nobuyori could not the same as Katsuyori.<br/>
<br/>
Other than just a regular old typo, another possibility is that it <br/>
might not be a name but just the word 信頼 - that is, trust, believe, <br/>
depend on, etc.<br/>

<br/>
Hmm. Definitely looks like a name. One other possibility is that this <br/>
is not referring to Katsuyori, but rather it's referring to Mochizuki <br/>
Nobuyori &#26395;&#26376;&#20449;&#38972;. Nobuyori was the eldest son of Takeda Nobushige 武<br/>
&#30000;&#20449;&#32321;, who is the younger brother of Takeda Harunobu (Shingen).<br/>
<br/>
What is the timeframe of this conversation? The 'tatakainuita' may <br/>
be referring to the battle of Kawanaka-Jima&#12288;&#24029;&#20013;&#23798;&#12398;&#25126;&#12356;. in 1561?<br/>
<br/>
There doesn't appear to be a lot of information out there about this <br/>
Nobuyori, who apparently died at 18 (1547-1564).<br/>
<br/>
Does this provide any help?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This took place when Shingen was near death, and giving his advice to <br/>
Katsuyori about trusting in Kenshin's chivalrous nature.  He told <br/>
katsuyori that katsuyori can trust kenshin, because he is one of the <br/>
most honorable men in the realm, if Katsuyori asked for his help, <br/>
kenshin would give it.  Obviously, Katsuyori decided not to follow <br/>
his father's advice.</div>
