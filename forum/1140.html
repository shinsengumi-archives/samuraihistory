<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630027247">Email them to me here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:samuraihistory-owner@yahoogroups.com">samuraihistory-owner@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
and I'll post them for you, and announce on the list when they go up.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes this list truncates the email addresses in messages (for 'privacy', I suppose), so i'll put it here with spaces, in case the above email address doesnt come through. just close up the spaces when you send it:<br/>
