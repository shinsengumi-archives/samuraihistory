 </span></blockquote>Michael Jordan won 6 NBA Championships. He was 5 time<br/>
NBA Most Valuable Player. 6 time NBA finals MVP.<br/>
1987-88 Defensive player of the year, and voted all<br/>
NBA defensive team 9 times. Voted All-NBA first team<br/>
10 times. Holds the NBA record for most seasons (10)<br/>
leading the league in scoring. 13 time All-Star.<br/>
There's not enough space to go into all the records<br/>
he's got. He dominated the NBA the way no one with the<br/>
possible exception of Wilt Chamberlain did--and not<br/>
even Wilt made his teammates better like Jordan. The<br/>
vast majority of sports pundits don't even question<br/>
that Jordan is/was the best NBA player ever. There is<br/>
too much evidence, both statistics and championships,<br/>
that show he was the best. <br/>
<br/>
Now, I'll grant that modern sports documents things<br/>
much better than 17th century martial arts. However,<br/>
that's EXACTLY why your argument is flawed, James. You<br/>
can't say "Musashi was like Michael Jordan, so he was<br/>
the best ever", because you can't show me WHY he was<br/>
like Michael Jordan. Did he set records? Win<br/>
championships? No--because he wasn't competing in<br/>
sports. It's apples and oranges. <br/>
<br/>
There are researchers who claim that Musashi's famous<br/>
duel with Sasaki Kojiro didn't actually take place,<br/>
others who claim that Musashi actually ordered some of<br/>
his disciples to ambush Kojiro, etc. I don't see<br/>
anyone claiming that Jordan didn't take the final shot<br/>
of the 1998 NBA Finals against Utah, that it was<br/>
really Scottie Pippen. <br/>
<br/>
Rather than relying on a flawed analogy to a modern<br/>
sports icon (an analogy which gets blocked faster than<br/>
me trying to take on Shaq one-on-one), why doesn't<br/>
anyone build a real case for why Musashi is The<br/>
Greatest Samurai Ever(tm)? Why, if you try, will you<br/>
fail to convince me that he is said The Greatest<br/>
Samurai Ever(tm)? <br/>
<br/>
PRECISELY for the reason that James's analogy fails.<br/>
You can list out Jordan's accomplishments, records,<br/>
championships, etc. They are directly quantifiable and<br/>
comparable to other NBA players. You can debate<br/>
whether Jordan's 6 MVP's are better than Bill<br/>
Russell's 5 MVP titles, etc. Maybe you have to take<br/>
into account different era's, level of competition,<br/>
position played, etc., but you're still comparing<br/>
apples to apples. <br/>
<br/>
Contrast this with the Greatest Samurai Ever(tm)--what<br/>
are the criteria? For some, it might be impact on<br/>
history--Minamoto Yoritomo, Hojo Tokimune, Tokugawa<br/>
Ieyasu, etc. might be your nominees. For some, it may<br/>
be patronage of the arts--Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Oda<br/>
Nobunaga, etc. Perhaps it's tactical and strategic<br/>
acumen as displayed as a commander of troops--Oda<br/>
Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Minamoto Yoshitsune,<br/>
Takenaka Hanbei, Uesugi Kenshin, Takeda Shingen....and<br/>
on....and on... Maybe it's individual courage and<br/>
loyalty? Benkei, Torii Suneemon, Kusunoki Masashige,<br/>
Torii Mototada, Yamanaka Shikanosuke, the 47 loyal<br/>
retainers of Ako, and many more would apply.<br/>
Individual prowess on the battlefield? Benkei again,<br/>
Yoshitsune, Kato Kiyomasa, Kamiizumi Nobutsuna... Made<br/>
the most of themselves? I think Toyotomi Hideyoshi<br/>
would win that hands down, but I'm sure some could<br/>
argue for others. Contibutions to samurai thought?<br/>
Yoritomo, Ieyasu, Kusunoki, Imagawa Ryoshun, Kato<br/>
Kiyomasa...and yes, for GoRin no Sho you could put in<br/>
Musashi.<br/>
<br/>
There are those, perhaps, that consider individual<br/>
contributions to the martial arts, and Musashi would<br/>
definitely be a candidate for this. But so would about<br/>
3 members of the Yagyuu family, Kamiizumi Nobutsuna,<br/>
Tsukahara Bokuden, and others. Is that enough to give<br/>
Musashi GreatestSamuraiEver(tm) status? Over all the<br/>
other criteria I've mentioned, and all the other<br/>
samurai I've mentioned? In my mind, no--to give him<br/>
Best Ever status, you've got to explain WHY he's<br/>
better than every other samurai in history. <br/>
<br/>
Michael Jordan? We can show (and anyone who saw him<br/>
play knows) why he was the best to ever play<br/>
basketball. Miyamoto Musashi? Being the most<br/>
well-known and talked about duelist doesn't even make<br/>
him the best duelist, much less the Greatest Samurai<br/>
Ever(tm). Though I do think he would have made a<br/>
decent point guard. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079602430">You made a great pont on a bad analogy. I could be beating a dead horse here but his title was samurai and he is known for his dueling capabilities. With this in mind doesnt that mean something toward his account. Ok put it this way if you did not know abt Japanese history or culture but that one name that is a house hold name has to be Musashi. Kind of like Einstien and Chemestry. I hope this makes more sense. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sure. It makes him worth study, I don't debate that.<br/>
Does it make him the GREATEST? No. Not until you can<br/>
explain WHY he's better than EVERY OTHER SAMURAI who<br/>
ever lived. That's what "GREATEST" means. We live in<br/>
the age of Sportscenter, where they throw that term<br/>
around constantly without regard to the meaning of it.<br/>
Some Joe Schmo gets considered the "greatest" for<br/>
making a tackle. Woo hoo. <br/>
<br/>
Ok put it this way if you did not know abt<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Japanese history or culture but that one name that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So...what your saying is that because Musashi is<br/>
featured in video games or martial arts magazines more<br/>
than other samurai, and his name is more recognizable<br/>
to people who KNOW NOTHING about Japanese history,<br/>
then that makes him the greatest? <br/>
<br/>
If I want to get opinions about who the greatest<br/>
running back of all time in the NFL is, I'm not going<br/>
to go ask people who don't watch football. I'm going<br/>
to ask the experts--the greats who've played the game,<br/>
the people who get paid to analyze, the<br/>
coaches...these are the people who really know what it<br/>
takes to be the best. <br/>
<br/>
Similiarly, I'm not going to accept the statement that<br/>
"Musashi is the greatest" because people ignorant of<br/>
actual Japanese history know his name. This is<br/>
precisely my problem with this whole topic. People who<br/>
KNOW Japanese history can come up with many other<br/>
examples (as I did in the previous email) of people<br/>
that, depending on your criteria, could be considered<br/>
"great samurai". Why would I go ask someone who's<br/>
knowledge of Japan and the samurai came from Onimusha<br/>
and the 3 weeks of karate classes he took in Hoboken,<br/>
New Jersey?  <br/>
<br/>
My dad once used this example with me: Do you know who<br/>
Chet Atkins was? I guarantee you that Eddie Van Halen,<br/>
Jimi Hendrix, and anyone else who became famous<br/>
playing a guitar knows. He was possibly the best<br/>
guitarist of all time--not the most famous, but the<br/>
best. All the great guitarists after him know who he<br/>
was, and studied him. The point is that most<br/>
famous/widely known does NOT equal best. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks. If someone puts forth a set of criteria and an<br/>
argument as to why Musashi were to best fit that<br/>
criteria for GSE(tm), then we'd have an intelligent<br/>
discussion going on. The problem is that it's<br/>
impossible to define GSE(tm) whatsoever.<br/>
Unfortunatlely, the fanboy crowd has this perception<br/>
gained from hollywood/games/etc. that is fed by the<br/>
Bushido mystique and Edo-period concepts of, as<br/>
Turnbull said, the "Lone Samurai", heavy on martial<br/>
arts and philosophical ideals that were codified in<br/>
the mid/late Edo period. Sadly, this neglects almost<br/>
600 years of samurai history. (If you take 1000 as a<br/>
base, 1877 as the end, that's almost 900 years. 600<br/>
years would be 2/3 of the history of the samurai, when<br/>
99% of the development, wars, etc. took place, and<br/>
we're just going to IGNORE IT? Insanity.)<br/>
<br/>
Using superlatives is always dangerous. It's hard<br/>
enough to define someone like Michael Jordan as the<br/>
best basketball player ever, and most people will<br/>
agree with you. It's infinitely harder to say that X<br/>
was the GSE(tm), especially when you don't explain<br/>
your reasoning and criteria. <br/>

Nate hit the nail on the head. You can't say anyone was the greatest<br/>
samurai, because samurai were a large group of people who did different<br/>
things. Not all samurai were soldiers/commanders/sword instructors etc.,<br/>
even in the 16th century and before. Some were purely administrators or<br/>
teachers or whatever. It would be like me asking who the greatest office<br/>
cubicle worker is. You could say that Musashi was the greatest swordsman<br/>
ever, but even that would be pure speculation.<br/>
 <br/>
When I think of "Greatest Samurai", I think of the samurai who had the<br/>
greatest impact on history, so guys like Tokugawa Ieyasu, Minamoto no<br/>
Yoritomo, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, et al. spring to mind straight away.<br/>
Musashi's accomplishments seem near non-existant when compared to the<br/>
likes of these figures.<br/>

In all of these categories, you are dealing with a variety of people. Who<br/>
did a variety of things, who played a variety of roles in history. What does<br/>
anyone mean by "the greatest?" Specifically, in dealing with Japanese<br/>
samurai, you are dealing with hundreds of years of history. How can any<br/>
samurai be "the greatest" (whatever that means)? <br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more meaning in studying the lives of Miyamoto Musashi, Oishi<br/>
Kuranosuke, Minamoto no Yoritomo (or his brother Yoshitsune), or Tokugawa<br/>
Ieyasu as individuals. Without labeling any of them as "the greatest samurai<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354933659">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than citing some martial arts site or other, it would be more <br/>
productive to recommend reading "Book of Five Rings (Go Rin no Sho)" <br/>
which is available in bookstores and libraries. A Japanese historical <br/>
novel called "Musashi" was published in the 30's and is also avilable <br/>
in English. I believe that Inagaki's movie is based on this novel.  <br/>
Last I heard, there is relatively little authoritatively available <br/>
about Musaashi's life. He is generally believed to have fought on the <br/>
loosing side of Sekigaraha and both battles of Osaka Castle, but to <br/>
have later served the Tokugawa's during the Shimabara no Ran (1637-8). <br/>
There are a number of artifacts especially paintings and calligraphy  <br/>
which are attributed to him. Please do not try to use the traditions of <br/>
modern martial ryuha to document Musashi. Lots of these groups claim <br/>
descent from him, but there is often little to show that this descent <br/>
is really authentic.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792408196">Hi,<br/>
Actually there are several good books out that are historical accounts of <br/>
Musashi's life.<br/>
"Miyamoto Musashi -His life and Writings" by Tokitsu<br/>
and "The Lone Samurai" by Wilson.<br/>
<br/>
Both have historical information about the Musashi but Tokitsu's is by far <br/>
the most detailed. Hope this helps.<br/>
