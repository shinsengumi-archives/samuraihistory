<br/>
Japanese Samurai and Anime Film Nights was organized by Dr. Takashi <br/>
Yoshida, WMU assistant professor of history, and is sponsored by WMU <br/>
Japanologists and by the Japan Club, a WMU registered student <br/>
organization. According to Yoshida, five more films are tentatively <br/>
scheduled for dates during spring semester.<br/>
<br/>
"There are many historical and cultural connections between <br/>
Kalamazoo, WMU and Japan," says Yoshida, who serves as faculty <br/>
advisor to the Japan Club. "The film series is a fun way to share <br/>
some aspects of Japanese culture with others and to help raise the <br/>
visibility of the Japanese community on campus.<br/>
