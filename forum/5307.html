<h3>Anointment of Daimyos</h3>
by <i>rami_efal</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738873462">Hi again! does anyone know of what would consist a ceremony of anointment of a daimyo in beginning of Edo period (mid 17th Centaury)? was it performed at Edo by the shogun himself? Could it be performed at the Daimyo's own premise by an official of the Bakufu? I would be glad to be referred to any literature about the subject.<br/>
(on the same note, some spell DAIMYO and some DAIMYU. which is correct the correct spelling?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don't believe there was one. Perhaps the bakufu<br/>
would send a message to the heir of the daimyo who<br/>
died, confirming that he would retain the possessions<br/>
of his father, but there was no "coronation" or<br/>
anything. Dad died, son took over. <br/>
