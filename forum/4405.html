<h3>Horsemen or infantry men???</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121947911">Hello guys!! I have been part of the members for a year but this is the first time i post an email. I have a question about the samurai. In pc games like Age of Empires and Empires: Dawn of the modern world they show samurai as infantry troops. But in the Code of Bushido (which I own) they say that the samurai must put importance in horsemaship. Here is my question:<br/>
 <br/>
Are the samurai horsemen that can shoot arrows and use swords from horses or infantry, or both?????<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let's put it this way: Are army soldiers infantry, or do they ride tanks and fly <br/>
helicopters?<br/>
<br/>
The answer is obvious. Some are this, some are that.<br/>

  Hello guys!! I have been part of the members for a year but this is the first time i post an email. I have a question about the samurai. In pc games like Age of Empires and Empires: Dawn of the modern world they show samurai as infantry troops. But in the Code of Bushido (which I own) they say that the samurai must put importance in horsemaship. Here is my question:<br/>
<br/>

 From this and your other message I get the sense that you are an avid <br/>
student of Japanese history. That's great! One thing to keep in mind <br/>
is that we have to think about this topic over a very long period of t<br/>
ime. It's very rare to be able to state with 100% confidence that <br/>
something is "just so". <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >They were both: <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Three major ranks: <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why three? How do you define "major"?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >kenin - meaning "housemen". They were the administrators or vassals.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kenin had different meanings over a period of some 1000+ years. When <br/>
talking about Japanese history we need to be pretty clear exactly <br/>
what period we're referring to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >mounted samurai - Only high-ranking samurai warriors were allowed to <br/>

>Japanese Name's<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mounted samurai is not a "rank". Higher level samurai (who were by <br/>
definition rich) might have horses that they fought on from time to <br/>
time, or used for transportation.<br/>
<br/>
By foot soldiers I'm sure you mean ashigaru. This we can agree was <br/>
usually the lowest rank of samurai or quasi-samurai, across alot of <br/>
Japanese history.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of other ways to group samurai, and many different <br/>
ranks or titles. For instance there is the ritsuryo system where each <br/>
title was given a very specific, and numbered, rank. These titles <br/>
existed for a thousand years after the ritsuryo system disintigrated. <br/>
Obviously the titles were in name only since the risturyo system <br/>
itself was gone.<br/>

totally agree with what you said in-regards to thinking about a topic <br/>
over a very long period of time, I will definitely keep this in mind. <br/>
Once again thanks</div>
