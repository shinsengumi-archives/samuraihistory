<h3>Okimoto and Byankottai</h3>
by <i>mahamayuri</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-935807972">Greetings<br/>
<br/>
At the site related to this list, I found that Okimoto family is somehow<br/>
related with the Clan of the Mori House!<br/>
<br/>
Was there a crest for Okimoto House related with the Mori Clan?<br/>
I don't know very well how Japanese Heraldic system works, but it seems to<br/>
be very different than the westerners counterparts.<br/>
<br/>
What people here knows about Byankottai?<br/>
(The White Tigers Brigade).<br/>
A group of youngsters Samurais (the last ones), who was loyal to the Shogun,<br/>
and fough to their deaths the threason of the Imperial Family against the<br/>
Shogun, and against the samurais.<br/>
<br/>
Am I right or wrong?<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29095282">In fact is what I though.<br/>
I know little or almost nothing about the history of my family since my<br/>
grandfather died without speaking anything. He loved Japan, since he lived<br/>
at Brazil since his adulthood, but speaking japanese, but dealed things of<br/>
the past as it was already buried.<br/>
<br/>
And searching on the web, it was the only place I saw "okimoto" mentioned in<br/>
History at the Samurai site..<br/>
<br/>
This was the only clue I have, and I take it  a little serious enough to<br/>
ask, because Okimoto family (not a clan) had its origin at the same region<br/>
of the Motonari's one. So, I am researching a possible conection.<br/>
<br/>
Very around Fukuoka region. If is a mistake or not, I don't know yet.<br/>
<br/>
It is about oyakoko. Even to know a little more about my origins, is to know<br/>
more about my soul, soul of my family, and the conection with one of my<br/>
roots that is Japan.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does anybody know any online reference to Byankottai History?<br/>
<br/>
thanks in Advance<br/>

	Lets say you are not exactly right but you are close. The <br/>
Byakko Tai were members of an irregular unit made up of boys 13-17 <br/>
created for the defense of Aizu han. In 1868 when the forces of the <br/>
Tokugawa Shogun and those supporting his cause were pushed out of <br/>
Edo, many fled north and gathered around the banner of Matsudaira <br/>
Katamori,the lord of Aizu. As the Impperial armies of Satsuma, Choshu <br/>
and others pushed north one by one the northern han opposed to them <br/>
succumbed.<br/>
	The Byakko Tai were sent to the outer line of defense on the <br/>
far side of iimoriyama hill, on the outskirts of Wakamatsu, to <br/>
relieve/reinforce regular troops fighting there. They were too little <br/>
too late, suffering many losses they were put in retreat. When they <br/>
reached the crest of the hill they could see Wakamatsu-jo burning. <br/>
Thinking all was lost, their homes, their mothers and sisters, they <br/>
resolved to die like men. 19 young boys either stabbed each other in <br/>
the throat or committed seppuku on the spot.<br/>
	We know their story because one of their number survived into <br/>
old age, though he moved far from Aizu as an adult he asked to be <br/>
buried among his friends as his dying wish. So there are 20 Names on <br/>
the memorial.<br/>
