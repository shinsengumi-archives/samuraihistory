There is no honor in wanting to start a war. There's<br/>
plenty of honor shown by many of those who fight it.<br/>
Not every soldier is honorable, just like not every<br/>
samurai was honorable. But usually it's not the<br/>
soldiers who want to go fight the war. Anyone who<br/>
doesn't believe that, I'll take a poll of my friends<br/>
and colleagues, and get back to you--I'll ask how many<br/>
of them in Iraq and Afghanistan right now are enjoying<br/>
themselves, how many wanted to go and be separated<br/>
from their families, etc. I doubt I'll get many<br/>
positive responses. <br/>

<h3>war on ancient Japan</h3>
by <i>tbsorrentino</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-115582511">Hello all, hello Nate,<br/>
<br/>
Bringing the topic back to the samurai, perhaps one of Mr. Clausewitz<br/>
insights may be helpful in understanding the role of war in ancient Japan:<br/>
"war is the continuation of politics by other means". During the warring<br/>
states period ("Sengoku Jidai"), japanese politics (understood as the<br/>
relationship between the social entities) could be traced back to constant<br/>
armed conflict. I seem to have lost track of the source, but I remember<br/>
coming across a statement claiming that "during the Sengoku era, specially<br/>
under Oda Nobunaga?s blossoming period, the internal diplomatic relations in<br/>
Japan almost ceased to be, as the driving force for change were war".<br/>
<br/>
In short, war was a way of life, a basis for assigning meaning to reality.<br/>
As such, the concepts of "honour" and "loyalty" were deeply woven amongst<br/>
the fabric of war. Perhaps before today?s standarts, "honour" and "loyalty"<br/>
have different meanings from what they used to have on those days. Even the<br/>
warlords and warmongers were subject to suffering the effects of defeat on<br/>
such era.<br/>
<br/>
Also, lack of honour which can be ascribed to a warlord or warmonger does<br/>
not entail lack of honour which can be ascribed to soldiers,<br/>
brothers-in-arms bound by something far greater than the conflict itself. I<br/>
beesech Shakespeare knowledge to make this point: "Those who shed their<br/>
blood with me today, on this field, shall be my brother - we, a band of<br/>
brothers".<br/>
<br/>
I hope this adds in a positive way to this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Thiago<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060530225">Exactly, surely a war fought in defence of one's honour is honourable, however undesirable. Waging war upon those who are perceived enemies or threats could be criticised but wars fought to create one's identity (eg; the Vietnamese against the French, US and Allies, then China, or even the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 or the Zulu Campaigns against British rule). Expansionist wars are driven by political and ecominc gluttony but wars to create national integrity are honourable, even if the means used to fight them are not.  War is always (hopefully) used as a last resort, but for those involved there is honour, not just towards the cause but towards one's comrades. <br/>

       There are such things as "evil" or "dishonourable" wars, this is true. <br/>
 One thing war always is, and that's UGLY.  There's no such thing as a <br/>
"beautiful war".  That's an oxymoron if ever I heard one.  If done for personal <br/>
greed and aggrandisement, yes, to start a war is dishonourable.  It is not, <br/>
however, dishonourable to END a war by any means necessary when the party in the <br/>
right is the victor, and it is not wrong to keep a war going until the party in <br/>
that right (whatever it may be) is victorious.  And I must agree with whomever <br/>
said that there are both honourable and dishonourable actions in wartime, on <br/>
the battlefield and off.  War is another part of life, however ugly it may be, <br/>
and there are honourable and dishonourable acts in everyday life.<br/>

<h3>Re: loyalty and honour</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978418849">Well said.<br/>
<br/>
I get confused by the anti-military sentiment that many seeemingly <br/>
intelligent people have.  I've been told by some Japanese people that <br/>
there shouldn't be any military in Japan.  Not U.S. or Japanese.  The <br/>
I wonder, so what will happen if you don't have a military?  Someone <br/>
with a military (probably North Korea) would love to help them <br/>
remember history.  Where small countries get trampled because they do <br/>
not have adequate means to deter a war (or better stated -a <br/>
slaughter).  Even a simple look south, at Okinawa could show them <br/>
that.  It had been conquered so many times that you can find <br/>
reminants of virtually every asian dynasty on the island.  Even the <br/>
language changed, the native dialect (hogan) has many borrowed words <br/>
from those cultures.  <br/>
<br/>
Another question:  Why would someone who hates war be interested in a <br/>
group discussion about samurai?  Samurai-the military class.  Having <br/>
one of the strongest military histories in the world.  Fighting many <br/>
more wars than the average society (albiet, mostly against <br/>
themselves).  While the rest of us are not "Warmongers", I think we <br/>
have an appreciation for the historical importance of war.<br/>

Yes I guess your right. I think the problem here is the definition of honour. This word is used frequently but I think that a lot of time it is used in the wrong context. I'm not sure if there is no honour in war or not. Perhaps it is the right hting to do but not honourable. It's hard to say until I have an exact definintion of the word.<br/>

Hey.<br/>
       There are such things as "evil" or "dishonourable" wars, this is true. <br/>
One thing war always is, and that's UGLY.  There's no such thing as a <br/>
"beautiful war".  That's an oxymoron if ever I heard one.  If done for personal <br/>
greed and aggrandisement, yes, to start a war is dishonourable.  It is not, <br/>
however, dishonourable to END a war by any means necessary when the party in the <br/>
right is the victor, and it is not wrong to keep a war going until the party in <br/>
that right (whatever it may be) is victorious.  And I must agree with whomever <br/>
said that there are both honourable and dishonourable actions in wartime, on <br/>
the battlefield and off.  War is another part of life, however ugly it may be, <br/>
and there are honourable and dishonourable acts in everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fair enough but how do you define a "right"side in a war. Surely that is just a matter of oppinion and if so then there is no correct honour, just how you percieve it?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depending upon one's perspective, while there is a notable difference <br/>
between duty and honor, the two generally tend to go hand-in-hand.  In <br/>
respects to the generalization of Japanese history, being honorable could be <br/>
viewed as a part of one's duty, depending upon the historical era and the <br/>
region involved.<br/>
<br/>
In respects to the subject of war, it's difficult to determine whether or <br/>
not it is for an honorable cause.  The 'facts' of all wars have been <br/>
notoriously biased in favor of the victor, so they will generally seem to <br/>
have had good cause.  It comes down to individual leaders and soldiers <br/>
rather than a war in general.  Should I define WWII by Germany's <br/>
extermination of the Jews or by America's use of atomic weaponry?  Should <br/>
either of those definitions drown out the actions of individuals who acted <br/>
honorably?  And, with more questions, how do we define honor in war and who <br/>
defines it?<br/>
<br/>
There are many more questions raised beyond these few.  With each answer, <br/>
we're going to find more differing opinions amongst the group members.  <br/>
This, of course, should help educate each of us in our own way.  Honestly, I <br/>
don't place much stock in the opinions of those who are going to throw <br/>
tantrums and exchange pre-schoolish insults.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm over-stepping my boundaries as a newbie who has been on the list <br/>
for less than forty-eight hours, but I joined this group because I have an <br/>
interest in japanese culture and history and felt I could learn a bit from <br/>
those more educated that I.<br/>
<br/>
-Matt<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Fighting in a war does not provide extra validation to one's opinions <br/>
or make them any more worthwhile.  Having been a soldier, I, of course, feel <br/>
everyone should serve some military service, but I don't use that as a <br/>
measurement of overall value of a person.  Nor should anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S.  This is a cultural history group, not a group of primates flinging <br/>
feces at one another.  I might be new here, but, please, can some of you put <br/>
aside aggressive differences and act as if evolution has actually been <br/>
beneficial?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10688084">It wasn't duty once the allied troops came across the concentration <br/>
camps. It was a rescue mission. I've heard this from the very mouths <br/>
of those there.<br/>
That's nice that you saw sick things on both sides. Its a very <br/>
tragic conflict there, similar to the Israel-Palestine problem. I <br/>
don't know which side you were on. So let's use the Holocaust <br/>
problem instead. You're a Jewish man who has led a good life. You <br/>
served your country (Germany) in peace and war.<br/>
You are thrown in a concentration camp. There, you make guns. You <br/>
start to smuggle parts of guns and whole guns away. Eventually, <br/>
before being transported to Aushwitz, you riot on the train, <br/>
ultimately jumping off to freedom.<br/>
Or say you're a soldier. You went to war for USA, and you are moving <br/>
into Poland. You come across a concentration camp. You never knew <br/>
they even existed. You never knew such a thing COULD exist. You free <br/>
the prisoners, do what you can for them. You learn there are more <br/>
camps, with more men, women, and children. With new motivation and <br/>
fervor you drive forward.<br/>
Both very dishonorable things, indeed. My two uncles were <br/>
respectively monsters. The Nazis should never have been stopped. <br/>
Jeeze, you're right. I do apologize.<br/>
Oh, and neither men even knew anything about the Japanese camps back <br/>
in California.<br/>
No, I'm too young to have fought in any wars yet. But it's looking <br/>
like I will, eventually.<br/>
And being the descendant of both the prisoner and the rescuer in a <br/>
war-time situation, I'll make as many worthwhile contributions as I <br/>
freaking please.<br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] Re: loyalty and honour</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-876872520">Loyalty, Honour ?<br/>
Take the book ''Tu passerai per il camino'' (plainly translated ''You'll<br/>
pass up thru the chimney''), Mursia edition, 1965.<br/>
The 6th picture starting from the end of the picture's section shows 4<br/>
people. Standing at right is Aldo Cardini. I can scan and send the<br/>
picture with the caption writed by him.<br/>
His family sheltered and fed my father during WWII, because my<br/>
greatfather completely relied on them, till to the point to leave his<br/>
family in their hands to avoid war dangers. The Cardini's family was in<br/>
a safe place but they were secretly communist. Notwithstanding this they<br/>
helped my greatfather that was sent to fight ''their hero Stalin'' in<br/>
Russia.<br/>
They understood the ''duty'' and had friendship above any other<br/>
consideration. <br/>
Aldo Cardini fought nazis and fascists ferociously and bravely as a<br/>
partisan, with faith in a future communist Italy. Captured, he was sent<br/>
to Mathausen. His extremely strong body survived till to the GI's<br/>
arrival, May 5th 1945. <br/>
His mother wasn't able to recognize him at his return.<br/>
Many years after, when my father was in his last moments for a cancer,<br/>
Aldo paid a visit to him. Watching at my father, said to me ''he seems<br/>
as me at my return''. And then, crying, ''Stalin have made it too...''. <br/>
After 40 years he had accepted the fact both parts had lagers. <br/>
He's still alive and healthy, he still wake-up from nightmares. <br/>
<br/>
Stop you to say ''idiot'' to each other. <br/>
You are both. And me too.<br/>
Never put too deep faith in something related to men.</div>
