<h3>Movie Review: &#39;The Last Samurai&#39;</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989729939">Hey Gang,<br/>
<br/>
The Last Samurai is a great flick. The music and cinematography are great, and you'll enjoy <br/>
the performances by Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka)... and Cruise (as Nathan <br/>
Algren) ain't half bad, either. <br/>
<br/>
You actually won't know most of the cast unless you're really into Asian theatre. Good actors, <br/>
but, of course, since it's set in Japan, not a lot of American actors in there.<br/>
<br/>
Is it based on a true story? Well...sort of. The movie IS historical fiction, so a little history, a <br/>
little (a lot) of fiction. Don't expect it to be completely true to the actual Satsuma Rebellion <br/>
timeline and history. Plus you've got a few oddities in there, like the Ninja attack, shuriken <br/>
a-flying and all...<br/>
<br/>
But basically it gives a nice romantic portrayal of Saigo Takamori (Katsumoto), through the <br/>
eyes of the western observer, Nathan Algren. Action abounds, romance is subtle, and <br/>
emotional contact is good. It's a bit melodramatic at points (like Braveheart and The Patriot) <br/>
but not intolerably so. What to expect? Think "Dances With Wolves" reset in 19th century <br/>
Japan. If you liked "Dances with Wolves" and "Braveheart", you'll love "The Last Samurai"<br/>
<br/>
Best scene: Partway through the movie, Katsumoto is with Algren in a temple courtyard, <br/>
surrounded by blossoming cherry trees. And he tells Algren, "One may search his entire life <br/>
for the perfect blossom, and he will not find it. But if he did find it, it would not be time wasted." <br/>
So then, towards the end of the movie, when Katsumoto lies dying, and his army has fallen, he <br/>
sees the wind blow through a blossoming cherry tree, and sweep all the blossoms away... he <br/>
sees it and says, in his dying breath... "Perfect" - speaking not so much of the cherry <br/>
blossoms as his samurai warriors. His army of samurai, like the bough of cherry blossoms, fell <br/>
in their beautiful prime... a samurai's glory.<br/>
<br/>
I'll give it **** <br/>
Do I want to see it again? "Hai."<br/>
So grab a popcorn, a coke, a date, and a ticket (and don't forget your wakizashes) and have a <br/>
good time.</div>
