<h3>&quot;just war&quot;</h3>
by <i>twheels2many</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-336961075">There are various "just war theories" that have been propounded throughout history. They usually have certain things in common, but ultimately, it's impossible to settle it on a philosophical basis. The idea of a "just war" is one of those things that will probably always remain a matter of opinion in the public realm, and which no one will ever prove conclusively to the world. Even among small groups that hold basically the same worldview, there is no real concensus. I myself believe in a particular just war theory, but it certainly isn't convincing to everyone else. <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, a "just war" is simply choosing a side in the lesser of two evils. If you consider WWII, which we would say was "just" on the part of the Allied forces, as they were defending rather than attacking... millions of innocent, unoffending people (meaning people who did not believe in the aggression and genocide) were killed, both on the Allied side and the Axis side. It certainly wasn't ALL the germans and italians and japanese that were the willing aggressors. Millions were conscripted against their wills who didn't really believe in the legitimacy of the Axis side. And on the Allied side, millions died defending against that aggression. And the Allied forces even sided with Stalin, who was a brutal murderer who killed some 40 million of his own people. Allying with such a man is certainly evil. But the enemy of my enemy is my friend... or so they say... If innocent people are unavoidably killed, then war cannot be "just" in a complete and unqualified sense.<br/>
<br/>
We would generally say war is just only for the defending side, and not for the aggressor. But what if one knows that war is coming, is inevitable, unavoidable, and you're left with the choice of being the aggressor or the one who is first struck? Then it seems that maybe it's okay to be the initial attacker, if war is inevitable. Such was the case for Japan and it's attack on Pearl Harbor... they felt or knew that war was inevitable, so chose to strike first rather than be struck first. We americans always call Japan the bad guys, but from a different perspective, their attack seems a little more acceptable (not that I'm saying they were right!!!)<br/>
<br/>
The question of whether or not there is a just war is a very difficult one. It's not easy to answer. I guess I would end up saying that war is an inevitable evil, an apparently necessary evil to combat other evils. Just? Only in a relative or highly qualified sense. But certainly not completely. <br/>

<h3>Re: &quot;just war&quot;</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714201108">I have two thing to say about your post.  <br/>
<br/>
First, you are correct in many ways.  I'd like to comment on the <br/>
"just"ness of a war based on the loss of innocent lives.  If it is <br/>
more "just" to inflict as little loss of innocents as possible then <br/>
America's military is moving very close to the over all goal of zero  <br/>
collateral damage.  In other posts, some say that war is ugly.  It <br/>
is, normally.  But I think if you watch our military you can see the <br/>
beauty of a "precise war".  Wars are no longer gauged in terms of <br/>
bridges bombed, buildings destroyed, or people killed.  We used to <br/>
count how many buildings were destroyed to judge our progress in war.  <br/>
But we have evolved to a point which we can destroy a single room in <br/>
a building.  Vastly reducing collateral damage while precisely <br/>
hitting our target.  I think that war in traditional, trench war <br/>
sense is very ugly due to the high number of casualties in such a <br/>
war.  Being able to stop specific people without hurting anyone else <br/>
is a thing of beauty but only  if the cause is morally right <br/>
(subjective, I know).  <br/>
<br/>
This election year President Bush will be critisized for the War on <br/>
Terror.  I'd hope that people look at the way we fight against <br/>
terrorists.  They cause mass casualties of innocent people, while we <br/>
target and kill only known terrorists and the rogue nation leaders <br/>
that support terror.  In fact, we aren't out there killing all of <br/>
them.  We are capturing them.  Surely a war against an enemy whose <br/>
primary goal is to kill innocent people, is a just war.  Reguardless <br/>
of weather we find Weapons of Mass Destruction or not.  <br/>
<br/>
The fundamental question is killing ever justified?  I think it is if <br/>
the death of one can prevent the suffering of many.  Sometimes you <br/>
have to cut the cancer out to save the patient.  If you don't, it <br/>
will spread until its evil pollutes all of mankind.<br/>
<br/>
Okay the 2nd thing.  My understanding is that America wanted Japan to <br/>
strike first because America needed the support for the war.  We <br/>
thought it was someone else's war until we were attacked.  So I <br/>
really doubt that Japan's attack was a pre-emtive strike.  I think <br/>
the leaders of that time wanted justice for the Russo-Japanese war <br/>
treaties that America had mediated.  The promises of monetary <br/>
reimbursement to the Japanese were threatening to our politicians.  <br/>
We were scared that if Japan had that money, they would build a great <br/>
military and eventually come after us.  We were afraid of a situation <br/>
that we ended up creating.  I don't think their attack was just in <br/>
the sense you mentioned but it was in the sense of retribution.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812405292">I can't leave my flag at home.  This is who I am.  It seemed relevant <br/>
although the  topic has wandered a bit.  I have to admit that I am <br/>
proud, but I am not campaigning or recruiting.  I'm just saying that <br/>
war doesn't have to be so ugly anymore.  If it is fought the right <br/>
way.  Battles like Nagashino are no longer standard warfare.  War <br/>
doesn't have to be a slaughter.  It can be executed and finished in a <br/>
proportional manner.  <br/>
In fact, I'm not even sure that I'll vote for Bush in the election.  <br/>
I am sure I have the right to share my thoughts.  Just as much as you <br/>
have the right to tell me that you don't like what I've said.  And <br/>
although there may not be an absolutely clear link to medieval Japan <br/>
let me make the indirect link evident.  This group discusses the <br/>
history of a military class and the wars they fought.  I think it is <br/>
important to be able to relate history into terms that I can <br/>
understand.  In my case I don't have any SCA experience or anything <br/>
of that nature.  The way that I relate to the samurai is through our <br/>
modern military and wars in recent history.  Being able to comprehend <br/>
the links that history may have to our present makes history even <br/>
more powerful in terms of revelance.  Some people don't like history <br/>
because they don't think it has any bearing on who they are.  I'm not <br/>
one of them and neither are you.<br/>
I'm just trying to tie things in so they make sense to me, and maybe <br/>
help others make the same link.  The topic of conversation was War.  <br/>
Is it bad, evil, ugly?  I guess I could have kept the conversation <br/>
abstract, like many others have.  I didn't want to be accused of <br/>
making statements "that sound good but have no substance".  <br/>
I really didn't mean to offend you but I won't apologize.  It is what <br/>
I believe.  I hope you don't hate me now.  I know that some of what I <br/>
brought up is probably closer to you than anyone else on the group.  <br/>
I do respect your opinions Cepo and I am actually flattered that you <br/>
read all the way through my message.  Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In part, Japan's assault on Pearl Harbor was motivated the United <br/>
States' discontinuation of oil exports to Japan.  In effect, you <br/>
could postulate America was responsible for the attack on Pearl <br/>
Harbor by practicing aggressive isolationism (I define aggressive <br/>
isolationism as the act of maintaining a neutral stance in a war <br/>
while providing the war-time equipment and supply requirements of the <br/>
warring nations).  We provided for England, to a degree.  We allowed <br/>
our soldiers to volunteer for service in a European front in <br/>
unofficial capacities.  We decreased or ceased importing and <br/>
exporting with nations in order to preserve our stockpiles, for the <br/>
most part, though, in agreement with you, there were probably more <br/>
intricate politics involved.<br/>
<br/>
For Japan, loss of oil imports from us wasn't immediately crippling, <br/>
but it was a potential blow to their economic future.  Japan was, by <br/>
all rights, defending their interests by engaging in war.<br/>
<br/>
I'm babbling a bit and slipping off-topic, but the main point deals <br/>
with a comment made on the 'justness' or 'unjustness' of war.  <br/>
A 'just war', by definition, is one in which the people of a <br/>
particular nation feel they were ethically correct in taking <br/>
aggressive action.  This can apply to both the victorious and the <br/>
defeated, depending on the perspective you want to defend.  When you <br/>
said a war to take out a single individual to preserve the safety of <br/>
others was morally just, which view point were you taking?  While I <br/>
don't agree with their values or politics, the terrorists and their <br/>
supporters feel they are right in the eyes of God (Allah, God, <br/>
Jehovah, Yahweh, the Kami...however you need to define it.  They feel <br/>
they are right in the eyes of the/a higher power).<br/>
<br/>
Who determines which side is "right" or "just"?<br/>
<br/>
Er, and I apologize for going a bit OT in this post.  Some of the <br/>
lines from your original post were stuck in my head and I hadn't <br/>
