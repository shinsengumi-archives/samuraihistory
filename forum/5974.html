I've never heard of December 5th being "Day of the<br/>
Ninja". There's no "Ninja Day" parades scheduled here<br/>
in Tokyo. Please elaborate on what the heck you are<br/>
talking about. <br/>

There is no "Day of the Ninja", at least not in the<br/>
sense like a specific holiday or something. It sounds<br/>
like a cross between a bad movie and a Hallmark<br/>
holiday gone horribly wrong. <br/>

the second annual 'Day of the Ninja' (Dec 5) which was begun last <br/>

of street fighting techniques, to be blunt dirty tactics. We are <br/>
taught that on the street anything can happen example, one person in <br/>
a park could confront you when all of a sudden three of his friends <br/>
appear from behind. Anyway we have this technique called the win-win <br/>
situation, deal with one with quick blows then move on. Aiming to <br/>
attack soft parts of the body (the groin, throat, arm pits. etc) <br/>
don't get me wrong that not all we are taught but is a significant <br/>
part of the art.  <br/>
Now to deal with this Ninja day, Have never heard of it, checked out <br/>
the website and from what I can gather seems like a lot of rubbish to <br/>
me. Will talk to my senses though and see if he knows anything about <br/>
it. Thing is though, there was a large workshop on Sunday the 4th <br/>
hear in Australia and no one mentioned anything about it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Apparently there are no techniques to recognize<br/>
sarcasm, irony, or satire. <br/>
<br/>
I'll spell it out for everyone: THE WEBSITE IS A BOGUS<br/>
JOKE! AS IS THE ULTIMATE POWER WEBSITE. ANY OF YOU WHO<br/>
CANNOT RECOGNIZE THAT AND TAKE IT AT ALL SERIOUSLY<br/>
NEED EITHER MENTAL COUNSELING, REMEDIAL LOGIC, OR A<br/>
GOOD SWIFT BASEBALL BAT TO THE HEAD!<br/>
<br/>
There IS NO NINJA DAY. STOP IT. NOW!<br/>
<br/>
(Zev: this last part isn't directly at you--it's at<br/>
everyone. Don't take it personally.)<br/>
