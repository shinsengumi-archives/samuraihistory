<h3>Hair</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683105250">Something that I have always wondered about, in both historical <br/>
records and the various movies I have seen over the years is about  <br/>
the samurai hairstyle.<br/>
<br/>
The now classic depection of kimonoed bushi with shaved head. except <br/>
for the long length of tied up hair resting atop thier head. And of <br/>
this i have always wondered why they had it in the first place and <br/>
why it changed? both the que and amount of shaved head over the <br/>
centuries.<br/>
<br/>
I have wondered that perhaps it was a mixture of both thier warrior <br/>
cult ways.( i use the term cult in the sence that after the Hideyoshi <br/>
sword edics and the rise of the bushi as top of the political and <br/>
social prymid. the bushi took the beliefs and ideals of Shinto, <br/>
Buddism, and a little Confusionism to make Bushido.) And thier <br/>
obvious religious underpinnings. If anyone has any idea's.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452405977">Just to let you know that the que resting on the shaved part of the <br/>
head was one of several hairstyles worn by the bushi.  It has come <br/>
down to us as the most seen in movies.  If you look at old prints <br/>
though a number of styles are shown.  The on that I personally have <br/>
seen the most in my limited experience ,other than the que on top, is <br/>
where the que basicaly sticks straight up in back and the end is <br/>
fanned out in a half circle.  There were however other styles that <br/>
were worn.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444439234">Ever wonder why a Japanese bandit covers his hair?<br/>
	One reason is the dust, under floorboards and under eaves, it <br/>
would stick in the heavily oiled hair and it would be obvious to <br/>
anyone that you had been crawling around above the ceiling. More <br/>
importantly though is the hairstyle. The Nihon Rekishi Zuroku shows <br/>
some 60 hairstyles for men and over 100 for women. Each is for a <br/>
particular caste or occupation. Edo residents would instantly <br/>
recognize a persons status and even occupation by their hairstyle. <br/>
For them it would be easy to see and remember even in the dark.<br/>
	By covering your hair you could enter and a house and even if <br/>
seen slip back into the crowd just by uncovering your head!<br/>
