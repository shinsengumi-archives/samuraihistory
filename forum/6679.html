<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925586940">Well "Boyz",<br/>
	I am sure you mean Sengo MuraMASA of Ise, who was no madman  but <br/>
rather a very gifted smith. Unfortunately for him and his fine works, <br/>
his swords figured in several accidents and a death or two involving <br/>
the Tokugawa family. Ieyasu was convinced they were bad luck for him <br/>
and his kin, so forbid anyone to wear them in his presence, this became <br/>
the law after awhile applied to all who served the bakufu. Playwrights <br/>
and novelists turned this into legend, spreading the infamy of the <br/>
swords and the idea of the mad swordsmith. A shame really because fine <br/>
works were surely lost or destroyed because of people who took the <br/>
tales too literally or who feared Tokugawa retribution.<br/>
	For the real story on the Sengo school and Muramasa I recommend <br/>
visiting www.jssus.org(www.afuresearch.com) and picking up The Art and <br/>
the Sword (their annual) with the excellent articles by Dr. Gordon <br/>
Robson DRE.<br/>
