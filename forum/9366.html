<br/>
First I would like to extend my thanks to everyone for their invaluable wealth of knowledge.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that someone could help point me in the direction of a resource where I can further research the samurai funeral.  To date I've been unable to find substantial information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478512878">Good point Barry -<br/>
	As I understand it most Samurai funerals were burials until the  <br/>
Meiji period when cremation became the norm for all classes across  <br/>
the country. Remember in Yojimbo, Mifune is hidden in a coffin, more  <br/>
like a big bucket in which the deceased "sat" into eternity. I think  <br/>
in Kagemusha the lord is breifly in a coffin before being placed in  <br/>
the jar, been a long time since I've seen that one.<br/>
	Sorry not the best sources, Sasama gives plenty of ink to executions  <br/>
but none to burials that I can find. Will keep looking.<br/>

in the Bakumatsu.)<br/>
	Cremation supposedly began with the monk Dosho in 700, spread to the  <br/>
upper classes and slowly<br/>
"continued with the popularization of Buddhism throughout the  <br/>
Kamakura and Muromachi periods, cremation became a practice of the  <br/>
masses. By the Edo period however the growing influence of Confucian  <br/>
ideology led to a tendency to avoid cremation and in certain areas  <br/>
burial was reinstated (probably the area I was thinking of) . In the  <br/>
Meiji period cremation was prohibited between 1873 and 1875 during  <br/>
the upsurge of anti-Buddhist sentiment that accompanied the early  <br/>
Meiji  governments's efforts to encourage Shinto (must be where I got  <br/>
the idea), but once again became a common practice after the  <br/>
government directed that fatalities from contagious disease be  <br/>
cremated to halt the spread of epidemics."<br/>
<br/>
	Quoted from the Kodansha Illustrated Encyclopedia of Japan (Eibun  <br/>
Nihon Daijiten). Not easy to admit when one is wrong but always  <br/>
appreciate the opportunity to learn something more...<br/>
