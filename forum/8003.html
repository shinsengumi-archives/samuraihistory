<br/>
In Araki Ryu Iaido, we have such a move (kata) in which we must defend ourselves from 4 attackers coming in different directions. The Kata is called Hagoromo. Three of the four cuts are repeated. I am not sure if this is what you mean.<br/>

<br/>
That's the idea. Is Araki Ryu Iaido a particular 'school' of<br/>
swordsmanship? What gives it its distinction? I mean, if you say you<br/>
follow Araki Ryu Iaido, what does that tell people who know about<br/>
these things?<br/>
<br/>
If 'three of the four cuts are repeated', then do you move in a<br/>
continuous circle until all four attackers are driven off? Can you<br/>
please describe it to me in more detail? I'm very interested. Once I<br/>
have enough info, I can explain a little better why I am asking. Thank<br/>
you for replying.<br/>

<br/>
I am sorry to have taken so long to answer your questions. I just got back from doing a sword seminar in El Paso, Texas.<br/>
Below is your letter with the answers you seek.<br/>
<br/>
Is Araki Ryu Iaido a particular 'school' of swordsmanship? <br/>
Yes, it's one of the three oldest classical sword arts. You can find much information about it.  On our site you can read it's history and see the genealogy  line. <br/>
<br/>
What gives it its distinction? I mean, if you say you follow Araki Ryu Iaido, what does that tell people who know about these things?<br/>
It tells student of iaido that we do a very old sword art. Again, it is a very formal and classical sword ryu.<br/>
<br/>
If 'three of the four cuts are repeated', then do you move in a continuous circle until all four attackers are driven off? Can you please describe it to me in more detail? <br/>
Its hard to describe a technique with words. We start off in a sitting position. Its like looking over head when we start to defend. If you can think of an X on the ground and you in the middle of the intersecting lines then you will have an idea of what is happening. We first make an over head cut to the top right of the X.  Then we turn around and cut to the bottom left of the X (overhead cut). This is followed by horizontal cut to the chest to the 3rd attacker - top left (we are still seating down). To finish we turn to the last attacker (bottom right) and make our final cut to the head. I hope all this makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Are you presently doing iaido? What city do you live in?<br/>
