<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998310112">In response to Tom Helm's point,  I would like to volunteer a  rough <br/>
definition of  bushi.  Of course,  no kanji here is carved on stone!  From the <br/>
earliest days,  figurines called haniwa were found in Japanese tombs.  Many of these <br/>
were likenesses of warriors in full armor.   We can assume that from at least <br/>
the Nara Period,  circa 700,  horses had already been introduced into Japan, <br/>
most likely from the three kingdoms on the Korean peninsula.  In a country <br/>
riven by war like Japan, inevitably the horses would be used by mounted warriors.  <br/>
Therefore, I would submit that this may be taken as perhaps the first <br/>
appearance of bushi, or warriors, into Japanese life. By the time of the Gempei War <br/>
of 1160-85,  the bushi began, in weapons, sword and bow, and in armor,  to take <br/>
on more of the characteristics of the samurai we recognize today.   Of <br/>
course, at no time does it appear that the world bushi actually was replaced by the <br/>
term samurai; by the same token, the English word "sergeant" has been used as <br/>
that of a commander of men at least from the time of the battle of Agincourt <br/>
in the Hundred Years War in 1415.   Certainly from the time of the Gempei War, <br/>
a samurai was considered a warrior who owed loyalty, fealty,  to his daimyo, <br/>
or lord.  Those samurai who lost their master were, of course,  known as the <br/>
ronin.  The period of the Age of the Country at War saw the greatest flowering <br/>
of the samurai in  Japanese military history.  Of course,  this definition is <br/>
subjective, and only intended to stimulate further discussion.  Concerning <br/>
Bushido,  I would invite Tom Helm to offer a definition.  All the best,  Jack <br/>
Murphy,  The Japan Foundation.<br/>

	There is some terrific info in the archive, takes a little effort put <br/>
some of it together, especially if one were new to the subject. The <br/>
problem  think our erudite webmaster faces is having to "dumb it <br/>
down"(god forbid). I suggest something like;<br/>
<br/>
Q. What is a samurai?How can I become a samurai?<br/>
<br/>
A. Samurai or more properly Bushi were a social class in pre-modern <br/>
Japan. All classes were abolished in Japan in 1877(?) there are no more <br/>
samurai only their descendants. For more on the samurai class see;<br/>

I realize there is some groaning going on out there, far be it from me <br/>
to place extra burdens on someone who has done a terrific job to date. <br/>
It is not my intent to step on any toes, just thinking out loud <br/>
really...<br/>
