<h3>Question about Two Books: Mushashi and Cleary</h3>
by <i>elizabethchase1</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418690333">Good afternoon!<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering: of all the translations of Miyamoto Musashi's book 'The Book of 5 Spheres (or Rings)....  which one is the most <br/>
accurate?<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I am wondering if anyone has read Thomas Cleary's 'The Art of Japanese War' (1992), and would like to hear your thoughts <br/>
on it.<br/>
<br/>
Obediently,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm sure someone here can help. I've got one<br/>
translation, but being as I haven't finished reading<br/>
it, and certainly haven't compared it, I can't help<br/>
you. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not surprisingly, I've got strong feelings about<br/>
Cleary. I haven't read his "Art of Japanese War",<br/>
because his "translation" of Sun Zi Ping Fa (THE Art<br/>
of War) is hideous. He's a philosophy nut, and if<br/>
you're looking for goofy easternish mystic<br/>
gobbledygook, then he's your man. Unfortunately, I<br/>
tend to think when an ancient Chinese strategist is<br/>
writing about war, when he writes about how to defeat<br/>
an enemy, that's what he's talking about. Cleary takes<br/>
it all as metaphor, expressing Taoist essence, blah<br/>
blah blah. When the man talks about killing people,<br/>
Tom, he's talking about killing people--not moon<br/>
viewing. <br/>
