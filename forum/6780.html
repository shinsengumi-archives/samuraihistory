<h3>Samurai vs Bushi</h3>
by <i>Haynes, A (Angus)</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345571875">Which term was most commonly used by the people of that time to describe<br/>
the warrior class in the 16th century forward, bushi or samurai? Were<br/>
they essentially interchangable? Why has samurai become the most<br/>
commonly used term these days, when most of the history books I have use<br/>
the term bushi, and you'd think with all the nonsense out there about<br/>
bushido that bushi would be the one people would be most familiar with?<br/>
Does samurai simply sound "cooler" and more Japanese?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Angus<br/>
