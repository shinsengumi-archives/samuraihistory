<div id="ygrps-yiv-586876403">Congrats to Ken Watanabe for being nominated for Best supporting <br/>
actor. Congrats to everyone who worked so hard to make The last <br/>
Samurai a success. Especially Tom Cruise who got shafted by not even <br/>
being nominated. And congrats to everyone who worked so hard on The <br/>
Twilight Samurai which should have won Best foreign language film for <br/>
Japan. Better luck next year hazu!-Keiman and Kei.</div>
