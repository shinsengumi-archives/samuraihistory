 </span></blockquote>I beleive Taisen Deshimaru Sensei was writing in the 1950's so all of his books<br/>
are readily available in English.<br/>
<br/>
The Katori Shinto Ryu is considered the oldest school of bojutsu, I recommend<br/>
"the Diety and the Sword" by Otake for info on this school and their use of the<br/>
Bo. The standard length is usually "roku shaku" or just over six feet.<br/>
<br/>
If you check bujindesign.com or other aikido related sites you may find videos<br/>
on bojutsu available.<br/>
