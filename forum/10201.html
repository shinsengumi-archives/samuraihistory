<div id="ygrps-yiv-417058228">Are you talking about Sakura Sogoro?  Took place in what is now Chiba Prefecture (Boso Hanto back then).  Taxes too high, he put a sign up on a bridge the daimyo was to pass iirc, taxes were lowered and he and his family were put to death from what I recall.<br/>

Nice little fantastical illustration here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dappan.net/research/tanaka/2.html">http://dappan.net/research/tanaka/2.html</a><br/>
 <br/>
There's a place in Chiba prefecture called Sakura (visited it when I was a boy and didn't pay as much attention as I should have) - believe it's a city now.  Has a shrine called the Sogo Reid Sanctuary (Toshoji, which the site calls Toshoji temple which is like saying Tosho temple temple):  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chiba-tour.jp/narita/sight/sight_top.html">http://www.chiba-tour.jp/narita/sight/sight_top.html</a><br/>

Hope this helps.<br/>

I cant remember what the officials name was but can anybody tell me the name of the guy who was some kinda official or a Lord that dident want to be cruel to his peasants cus of high taxes in a poor area. So he took their grevences all the way to the shogun himself. Then afterwords he had to kill himself for not going through the regular channels? Im guessing this is a repost but I cant remember who it was, a lil help? <br/>
