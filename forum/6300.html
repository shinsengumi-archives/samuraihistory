Thank you for the corrections.  If you can offer me a better translation - or better yet, a literal translation - of bunbu ichi, I'd be grateful, because "good as anything, I guess" is not really enough to satisfy me.  This shows up in the way you apply the term in your final paragraph:  my translation makes no grammatical sense in the way you use it, and I don't think it's because your grammar's bad.  There's something I don't understand there, and I'd like to.<br/>
And while it does not entirely surprise me that some houses despised that ideal, for my own part I think it one of the redeeming features of any warrior ethic; and of the sundry values held by sundry warrior societies, it's one of those I think most important to pursue today.  All fighting and no artistry makes Jack a dull boy, so to speak.  I've seen enough of Musashi's artwork to recognise real art in it, and those who regard Musashi as "soft and poofy" seem to be few and far between.<br/>
This is not to dispute your history - I'm not such a fool as that - but to reiterate the importance I feel that bunbu ichi carries through to the present day.<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

ichi."<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, but that's the whole point. "Bunbu ichi" was not a set rule. It was a<br/>
controversy. There were many houses that openly eschewed any appearance of the<br/>
"soft, poofy stuff" -- Some houses even maintained draconian punishments like<br/>
banishment or forced seppuku for those caught studying literature or playing<br/>
games or musical instruments; they deemed these pastimes as "unworthy" of the<br/>
warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Other houses felt that, well, "bunbu ichi."<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They lie. There is so much that's wrong with it historically that I almost<br/>
cried. Yeah, the armour's pretty. Yeah, the battles are fancy. But historically<br/>
it was totally crapola.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I'd think that Watanabe Ken and Sanada Hiroyuki ought to be<br/>
embarrassed. They've each made dozens of films -- some crappy, some really good<br/>
-- and the one they get international reputations for is this American "Dances<br/>
With Samurai" piece of steaming, fetid poop.<br/>
<br/>
I finally caught it on HBO last night, after months and months of refusing to go<br/>
pay to see it, rent it, or buy it.<br/>
<br/>
It made me sick.<br/>

Gereg, I think you're an otherwise intelligent human<br/>

sounds just as bad as any of the morons who believe<br/>
Hagakure and garbage like that.<br/>

A sword is a weapon; it can be a work of art. However,<br/>
it's not born, does not go through adolescence, learn<br/>
to drive, take dates to the prom, or have kids, age,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Traverse right! Make your range...<br/>
<br/>
One of the coolest things ever: The first two years I lived in Japan, I was in<br/>
Tokyo's far west suburbs, not too far from (Da)saitama. There was one stretch of<br/>
track on the Seibu-Ikebukuro Line that was elevated -- somewhere near Nerima, I<br/>
think. If you take the train at the right time in the late afternoon, you hit<br/>
the elevated section while the sun is going down behind Mt. Fuji. WAAAAAAY off<br/>
in the distance the sky is orange, with that distinctive silhouette on the<br/>
horizon. It was a view to live for.<br/>

  A little strong I'd say. Let's take a different approach. You pick up<br/>
*something* that you are trained to handle. The weight, balance and feel are<br/>
perfect for *you*, not in any way you can express. Something subliminal.<br/>
Then that object *speaks* to you. I know I felt that way the first time I<br/>
picked up a Glock 19 (and proceeded to put an extended clip in a silver<br/>
dollar sized circle at 30 yards. Some of my best shooting ever). Sure a<br/>
standard issue M1911A1 will do the job, but it doesn't feel the same. For<br/>
the same reason I haven't bought a takeyumi at Asahi. Nothing there *spoke*<br/>
to me. As a craftsman, lots of things *speak* to me on some level. I expect<br/>
it's projection, like people ascribing human emotions to thier pets.<br/>
<br/>
  I wouldn't worry about it unless the gollum conversations begin. ;)<br/>

Subject: Re: The Last Samurai, the movie. To: Tony Bryant<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hello tony,<br/>
  com'on man,...it was pretty good.?? I've seen a handful "samurai" movies in the past, (and yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but this is the 2000's, not the 1900's (lol). People like to see cool stuff like the Last Samurai even if it isn't all that accurate. You can't tell me you've seen any better Samurai "battle" scenes in another movies from the past?? (if so, please let me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great movie to boost the Samurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of people to respect them for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate history stuff & think i'm a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome movie. They were like...."Wow, those guys could really kick butt" I don't know,....maybe i'm wrong??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more insentive to practice kendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in the making,....delayed temp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watch it again and tell me that<br/>
 those battle scenes don't want to make you get up, build a time machine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hopefully a good one), and fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese back then were only like 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(lol). Well, my times up. Have a good one.<br/>
                                                             Yours,<br/>

it was totally crapola.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I'd think that Watanabe Ken and Sanada Hiroyuki ought to be<br/>
embarrassed. They've each made dozens of films -- some crappy, some really good<br/>
-- and the one they get international reputations for is this American "Dances<br/>

I finally caught it on HBO last night, after months and months of refusing to go<br/>
pay to see it, rent it, or buy it.<br/>

It made me sick.<br/>

I have hardly earned the right to address this forum.  However, I would<br/>
like to point out a book entitled "The Last Samurai" by Professor Mark<br/>
Ravina(sp?).  I believe that this book gives an albeit abbreviated<br/>
synopsis of the actual events.<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] bunbu ichi</h3>
by <i>johnandterumiperry</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-869083526">Hi everyone, I’ve been a lurker on this list for a couple of weeks and so far I’m finding everything very interesting.  I’m living in Fukuoka, Japan studying mainly Aikido and Calligraphy, but also Iaido, and Kyudo.  <br/>
 <br/>
This thread on Bunbu ichi is of interest to me, I’ve never heard of it said like that before but my Aikido Sensei who is also my Calligraphy Sensei has written many times “ Bun BU Ryo Do, &#25991;&#27494;&#20001;&#36947;  “ Which I believe translates into the brush ( literary studies ) and Budo are two parts of the same path.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway just my first 2 cents on a fantastic list,<br/>
 <br/>

Tony -<br/>
Thank you for the corrections.  If you can offer me a better translation - or better yet, a literal translation - of bunbu ichi, I'd be grateful, because "good as anything, I guess" is not really enough to satisfy me.  This shows up in the way you apply the term in your final paragraph:  my translation makes no grammatical sense in the way you use it, and I don't think it's because your grammar's bad.  There's something I don't understand there, and I'd like to.<br/>
And while it does not entirely surprise me that some houses despised that ideal, for my own part I think it one of the redeeming features of any warrior ethic; and of the sundry values held by sundry warrior societies, it's one of those I think most important to pursue today.  All fighting and no artistry makes Jack a dull boy, so to speak.  I've seen enough of Musashi's artwork to recognise real art in it, and those who regard Musashi as "soft and poofy" seem to be few and far between.<br/>
This is not to dispute your history - I'm not such a fool as that - but to reiterate the importance I feel that bunbu ichi carries through to the present day.<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
      Gereg<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, but that's the whole point. "Bunbu ichi" was not a set rule. It was a<br/>
controversy. There were many houses that openly eschewed any appearance of the<br/>
"soft, poofy stuff" -- Some houses even maintained draconian punishments like<br/>
banishment or forced seppuku for those caught studying literature or playing<br/>
games or musical instruments; they deemed these pastimes as "unworthy" of the<br/>
warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Other houses felt that, well, "bunbu ichi."<br/>

piece of art would, I'll buy it. If you tell me your<br/>
sword talks to you, you're nuts. Sorry.<br/>

<br/>
Gereg, I think you're an otherwise intelligent human<br/>
being. I'll agree to disagree on this--but to me it<br/>
sounds just as bad as any of the morons who believe<br/>
Hagakure and garbage like that.<br/>

A sword is a weapon; it can be a work of art. However,<br/>
it's not born, does not go through adolescence, learn<br/>
to drive, take dates to the prom, or have kids, age,<br/>
and die. IT'S NOT ALIVE. It's an object. It's a<br/>
physical entity, not a spiritual one.<br/>

<br/>
One of the coolest things ever: The first two years I lived in Japan, I was in<br/>
Tokyo's far west suburbs, not too far from (Da)saitama. There was one stretch of<br/>
track on the Seibu-Ikebukuro Line that was elevated -- somewhere near Nerima, I<br/>
think. If you take the train at the right time in the late afternoon, you hit<br/>
the elevated section while the sun is going down behind Mt. Fuji. WAAAAAAY off<br/>
in the distance the sky is orange, with that distinctive silhouette on the<br/>
horizon. It was a view to live for.<br/>

  A little strong I'd say. Let's take a different approach. You pick up<br/>
*something* that you are trained to handle. The weight, balance and feel are<br/>
perfect for *you*, not in any way you can express. Something subliminal.<br/>
Then that object *speaks* to you. I know I felt that way the first time I<br/>
picked up a Glock 19 (and proceeded to put an extended clip in a silver<br/>
dollar sized circle at 30 yards. Some of my best shooting ever). Sure a<br/>
standard issue M1911A1 will do the job, but it doesn't feel the same. For<br/>
the same reason I haven't bought a takeyumi at Asahi. Nothing there *spoke*<br/>
to me. As a craftsman, lots of things *speak* to me on some level. I expect<br/>
it's projection, like people ascribing human emotions to thier pets.<br/>
<br/>
  I wouldn't worry about it unless the gollum conversations begin. ;)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
hello tony,<br/>
  com'on man,...it was pretty good.?? I've seen a handful "samurai" movies in the past, (and yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but this is the 2000's, not the 1900's (lol). People like to see cool stuff like the Last Samurai even if it isn't all that accurate. You can't tell me you've seen any better Samurai "battle" scenes in another movies from the past?? (if so, please let me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great movie to boost the Samurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of people to respect them for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate history stuff & think i'm a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome movie. They were like...."Wow, those guys could really kick butt" I don't know,....maybe i'm wrong??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more insentive to practice kendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in the making,....delayed temp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watch it again and tell me that<br/>
those battle scenes don't want to make you get up, build a time machine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hopefully a good one), and fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese back then were only like 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(lol). Well, my times up. Have a good one.<br/>
                                                             Yours,<br/>
                                                                Mark<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They lie. There is so much that's wrong with it historically that I almost<br/>
cried. Yeah, the armour's pretty. Yeah, the battles are fancy. But historically<br/>
it was totally crapola.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I'd think that Watanabe Ken and Sanada Hiroyuki ought to be<br/>
embarrassed. They've each made dozens of films -- some crappy, some really good<br/>
-- and the one they get international reputations for is this American "Dances<br/>
With Samurai" piece of steaming, fetid poop.<br/>
<br/>
I finally caught it on HBO last night, after months and months of refusing to go<br/>
pay to see it, rent it, or buy it.<br/>
<br/>
It made me sick.<br/>

Subject: Re: The Last Samurai, the movie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have hardly earned the right to address this forum.  However, I would<br/>
like to point out a book entitled "The Last Samurai" by Professor Mark<br/>
Ravina(sp?).  I believe that this book gives an albeit abbreviated<br/>
synopsis of the actual events.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
James Hisatake<br/>

Subject: RE: Japan eras - bunbu ichi/bunbu no ichi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. Before I could not understand your criticism but now I see things<br/>
in a whole new light. That is of course what learning is about. And I am<br/>
well knowledgeable of "bunbu". I was thought it was the twin ways of the pen<br/>
and sword but that the same thing you are saying.<br/>
Pretty much - I think 'ichi' means 'one,' which has always led me to<br/>
question the "harmony" translation.  Tony, or any other speakers of the<br/>
language - I remain most curious about this.<br/>
However, I have already took these into consideration and since this issue<br/>
of my spelling aroused when I spelled a Japanese word wrong it seemed you<br/>
got picky. Not to start any thing but alot of people make spelling mistakes.<br/>
No argument - but by planning to be a teacher, you place yourself outside<br/>
the category of those in whom it can reasonably be accepted.  As I may have<br/>
mentioned, my mother and her father both taught elementary school.  It's<br/>
given me a certain sense of what's expected of teachers.<br/>
But enough about that let me talk about culturalistic Japan some too. I<br/>
loved Japan and lets see I have a bit I want to share. Hmm lets see how to<br/>
aproach... when you guys train do you train first your how do you say<br/>
external or internal. What I am saying is do any one here do any traing of<br/>
the chi or Ki, for it a Japanese site. OK wait I know that if you train in<br/>
external arts then you will be naturally strengthening your internal<br/>
abilities but i guess you already see the question thank<br/>
 you. We are the same in so much yet different in so many aspects. GOD BLESS<br/>
ALL<br/>
	Whether I start a student on internal or external training largely depends<br/>
on the student.  By and large, as an American teaching Americans, that means<br/>
starting with the externals... but there have been one or two exceptions<br/>
over the years.  In some cases, I never bring it up at all, as I simply<br/>
don't think these folks can wrap their heads around the idea.  (Some<br/>
Christians, for example, believe ki to represent diabolic power, and I don't<br/>
want to get into that argument.)<br/>
	The gods bless you as well.<br/>
<br/>
peace<br/>
	And peace be on your house.<br/>
<br/>
