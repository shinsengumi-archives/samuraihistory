<h3>Ming vs Toyotomi</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-4776509">It actually happened, in Korea, 1592-98. The Ming celestial army <br/>
crossed the Yalu River and pushed the Japanese samurai army way back <br/>
south. It might be said, thou, that the Chinese were 300,000, while the <br/>
whole Japanese troops who entered the conflict numbered some <br/>
150,000-and by no means they were all there to fight the Chinese. After <br/>
the push South, the situation stalemated, basically until Hideyoshi's <br/>
death in 1598.<br/>
A very good article on these battles is in the "Cambridge History of <br/>
Japan" vol .4. The book costs $150,- but its easily found virtually in <br/>
every university library.<br/>
Turnbull's "Samurai Invasion," instead, concentrates mostly on Japanese <br/>
and Korean sources-very few words abt the Ming army.<br/>
I am not aware of any movie about the Japanese invasion of Korea. Does <br/>
anybody know of any?? Maybe made in Korea or in China??<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Ming vs Toyotomi</h3>
by <i>Lee Changsub</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-750440967">Dear Cesare:<br/>
Ming dynasty had two separate divisons of the military<br/>
organizations. One group dealt with barbarians like<br/>
Mongols and Manchurians in the North, which favored<br/>
combining calvary and archers(usually on horse) and<br/>
the other group in the South was specialized in<br/>
dealing with the Japanese pirates who were very<br/>
skilled in using swords and spears.<br/>
<br/>
300,000 Ming soldiers were from the Southern group<br/>
specialized in the Japanese warfare.<br/>
After the war, Yi dynasty also adopted and started<br/>
manufacturing arquebus and put more emphasis on<br/>
training the use of swords and spears.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the topics of diplomatic issues among<br/>
Ming, Japan, and Yi dynasty, the following book will<br/>
be of use:<br/>
<br/>
The Book of Corrections: Reflections on the National<br/>
Crisis During the Japanese Invasion of Korea,<br/>
1592-1598 (Korea Research Monograph, No 28)<br/>
by Song-Nyong Yu, et al (Paperback - December 2002) <br/>
<br/>
Song-Nyong Yu was a prime minister during the war and<br/>
was also a very close friend to Admiral Yi, Sun-Shin<br/>
from the childhood. Admiral Yi did not hold any higher<br/>
commanding position until he was appointed to command<br/>
the western fleet through Prime minister Song's strong<br/>
recommendation only a few years before the war. He was<br/>
not even trained for the Navy.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Yi Royal court published the military<br/>
training manual for the use of spears and swords after<br/>
the war. Its English translation is also available:<br/>
<br/>
Muye Dobo Tongji : Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of<br/>
Martial Arts of Ancient Korea<br/>
by Muye Dobo Tongji, et al (Paperback - October 2000) <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, for the TV series on the war, MBC broadcasted<br/>
the TV series on the war in the late 80's when I was<br/>
in the middle school. It was so good that it got an<br/>
air through NHK(Japan). You may check both of<br/>
broadcasting companies for more information.<br/>
Also, KBS aired the documentray series on the war in<br/>
1995(?). It was not superb, but you can see real<br/>
weapons used and the battle scenes not great in<br/>
picture but constructed by a group of contemporary<br/>
military officers and war experts.  I hope that this<br/>
will help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
                         Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Yes, you can find information on the web. I presume<br/>
that there must be someone who can help you with<br/>
English.<br/>
Or if you can understand Japanese, you may find some<br/>
people either Korean or Japanese who would translate<br/>
it into Japanese at reasonable prices. Of course, this<br/>
applies only when I assume that you are not one of<br/>
under-priced scholars like most people in Academy. <br/>
Good Luck.<br/>
