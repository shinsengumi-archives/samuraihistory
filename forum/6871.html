<br/>
The reason for suicide is widely known as the last act to have <br/>
Nobunaga act as the respectful head of clan but there are several <br/>
conflicting stories. Some believe that he felt responsible for <br/>
Nobunaga's behavior and took responsibility with his own life, <br/>
others believe that Nobunaga had wanted the horse of Hirahide's <br/>
eldest son but Hirahide turned it down and this led to a cooling of <br/>
two men's relationship. Nobunaga still behaved oddly but built a <br/>
Buddhist temple, Seishuji(政秀) dedicated to Hirahide.</div>

 </span></blockquote>As Kitsuno said, the generally accepted theory is that<br/>
it was Hirate's last effort (literally) to get<br/>
Nobunaga to abandon his wayward ways. Hirate had been<br/>
like a surrogate father to Nobunaga while Nobunaga was<br/>
growing up, being in charge of his education, and<br/>
while you could interpret it as an admission of<br/>
failure and attempt to attone for the bad management<br/>
of his ward, I think it was less that and more an<br/>
attempt at a wake-up call for Nobunaga. The incident<br/>
Kitsuno mentions about the horse belonging to Hirate's<br/>
son is mentioned in Yoshikawa Eiji's novel "Taiko".<br/>
Essentially, Masahide's son (can't remember the name<br/>
at the moment) had procured a fine white horse, and<br/>
Nobunaga rather selfishly ordered Hirate to give him<br/>
the horse, as the master should have finer things than<br/>
the retainer. The novel recounts that Masahide's son<br/>
chafed at having to give up his horse, but Masahide<br/>
instructed him to do so, because his lord had so<br/>
ordered. That night Masahide committed seppuku--the<br/>
horse incident being just the final straw. The seppuku<br/>
was a final remonstration from an obedient servant<br/>
who'd simply seen his lord go too far. <br/>
<br/>
Now, that's the novel version--reality, I'm not quite<br/>
sure. I don't think I've ever heard about the horse<br/>
incident anywhere else. <br/>
