<h3>Snowfire</h3>
by <i>scorpialuna</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-294448369">The book is tentatively titled "Snowfire". That's just a working <br/>
title, though, I'm sure something else will come up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for the most excellent information, it helps <br/>
tremendously; and yet I have many more questions. (I'll ask those in <br/>
due time, though.) As for the book, I was wondering: I know this <br/>
isn't a writing critique group, but if I posted the backstory- about <br/>
how the revenge gets set up, the basic kernal of the story- would you <br/>
guys be willing to take a look and tell me if it's _logical_ enough? <br/>
I know there is a definite component of fantasy, and I am making very <br/>
free with some aspects of the Japanese culture, but I'd at least like <br/>
to get as close as I can to _some_ kind of historical accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is off-subject, but this is the best resource I have <br/>
for this book and I want to do it right. So you know I'm not a <br/>
weirdo: (or at least, I am a successful weirdo, LOL) my website is at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lilithsaintcrow.com">http://www.lilithsaintcrow.com</a> . I have three ebooks out, a four-book <br/>
contract with a romance publisher (even writers have to eat, guys) <br/>
and am negotiating with an agent for another book. If the <br/>
negotiations go successfully I might be able to sell this book to a <br/>
publisher too. So there is a very real chance of this thing acheiving <br/>
fruition- all of which I tell you so that you know I won't be wasting <br/>
precious list time and posts.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also be grateful for any help anyone would want to give offlist, <br/>
as I know this isn't the sort of thing you guys usually do here. If <br/>
I've offended by asking for this, please let me know, and forgive me. <br/>
I'm just really excited by this book and the characters, and I want <br/>
to do them justice.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Feel free within the limits of what publishers will<br/>
let you put up here--most of us here will be happy to<br/>
help, if we can. I'm just glad to see an author who<br/>
cares about the details, and am eagerly awaiting your<br/>
book!<br/>
