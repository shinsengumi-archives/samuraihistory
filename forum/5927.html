<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522800036">I have an original 2 poster set of "The 47 Ronin" The last time I <br/>
was in Japan, I tracked down the burial site of the 47, and was in <br/>
awe of the reverance still given these guys. It is my favorite story <br/>
of all time. If you haven't read it, I recommend it highly. For <br/>
those of you who have, and enjoyed it as much as I did, these <br/>
posters are a must have. They are in mint condition, all in <br/>
Japanese. This was purchased on site at the burial grounds. I also <br/>
have a tea cup, depicting a scene from the story. I have no idea <br/>
what these are worth, but a recent divorce forces me to sell.All <br/>
offers will be considered, but do not insult me, I really hate to <br/>
get rid of these. I have lots of other art work of the 47 ronin, by <br/>
an artist Hisashi Otsuka. If you are familiar with his work, we <br/>
could talk.<br/>
