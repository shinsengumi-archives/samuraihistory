<div id="ygrps-yiv-951216745">This was originally called, as I recall, 'Comrade Loves of the<br/>
Samurai'<br/>
<br/>
'Gay' is unfortunate as it's a modern term, denoting a modern<br/>
expression of homosexuality - and usually an overt one at that.<br/>
<br/>
To say samurai were homosexual is an over-simplification. Rather they<br/>
lived in an overtly-patriarchal society where masculine virtues were <br/>
held in high regard (higher than the feminine) and consequently found <br/>
a physical outlet.<br/>
<br/>
All overtly-patriarchal societies are marked by same-gender sexual<br/>
activity - Greece (as you mention) particularly Sparta, Japan, <br/>
the English Public School, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
Many notable samurai had 'close companions' - notably Oda Nobunaga<br/>
and Uesugi Kenshin, and I believe Takeda Shingen and Tokugawa <br/>
Ieyasu have been hinted at.<br/>
<br/>
There are instructions in "Hagakure" for the proper arrangements (can<br/>
we say courtship) between samurai, and the film Gohatto (which by <br/>
the way has some splendid sword-play sequences) focusses on just <br/>
this point.<br/>
