<h3>Toyotomi Hideyohi</h3>
by <i>Scott19NY</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029802792">Two things about Toyotomi.  There is a non-fictional book about his <br/>
life entitled HIDEYOSHI by Mary Elizabeth Berry.  It is not too bad.  <br/>
I used it for a history term paper last year.  About how he died.  I <br/>
do not know the details of it, but I believe he died of natural <br/>
causes at a fairly old age.  If I am wrong someone please correct <br/>
me.  I would like to know the details of his death as well if any <br/>
knows.</div>

privy was a rumor, but most likely he died of an<br/>
apopleptic fit on the can. Wonder if he had donuts,<br/>
like Elvis.<br/>
<br/>
Hideyoshi died of old age.<br/>

<h3>Re: Toyotomi Hideyohi</h3>
by <i>iganokami</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-557792710">You're getting confused with a (very) far fetched theory of how Uesugi Kenshin died...  Toyotomi most likely died of syphilis (also not a proven theory, but likely, considering how much of a 'playboy' he was) - that would account for his erratic and psychotic behavior at the end of his life.  Here is info from the syphilis info site (Not one I tend to hang out at all that often):<br/>
"If untreated, syphilis may lapse into a latent stage during which the disease is no  longer contagious and no symptoms are present. Many people who are not treated will suffer no further consequences of  the disease. Approximately one-third of those who have secondary syphilis, however, go on to develop the complications of late, or tertiary, syphilis, in which the bacteria damage the heart, eyes, brain, nervous system, bones, joints, or almost any other part of the body. This stage can last for years, or even for decades. Late syphilis, the final stage, can result in mental illness, blindness, other neurologic problems, heart disease, and death."  It says up to 20 years can pass before this 'latent' syphilis shows itself. <br/>
<br/>
just a thought.<br/>

died then Mitsunari would not have been a teen. Since Hideyoshi only <br/>
died a few years before Sekigahara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986191827">I agree...how would this have worked out, when at the<br/>
time Ishida Mitsunari was a page of Hashiba<br/>
Hideyoshi's, who in turn was a retainer of Oda<br/>
Nobunaga, who was at war with Kenshin at the time of<br/>
Kenshin's death. <br/>
<br/>
At the time, Mitsunari not anywhere near being<br/>
important enough to even converse with Kenshin, even<br/>
if their clans werent' at war. <br/>
