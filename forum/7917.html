Not only that, but all this top posting has to stop... It drives me crazy<br/>
reading a response then having to go down into the email to figure out what<br/>
they are responding to.  <br/>
<br/>
Let's stop the top posting, OK?  Do what Nate and Tony do, post below each<br/>
section you are responding to. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
I'll do the best that I can, though I've noticed that others also have this<br/>
problem. I do snip out the parts of previous postings that aren't relevant,<br/>
which I've noticed some others don't do. <br/>
<br/>
I have Outlook, and it's difficult, but if it's really so very, very<br/>
important, then I'll try to remember to cut-and-paste and move the original<br/>
posting to the top and my comments to the bottom. <br/>
<br/>
Though I will NOT be able to put my comments below each section that I'm<br/>
responding to. Outlook isn't set up to allow people to do that, so I would<br/>
have to format it by hand.  Which might be convenient for you but is quite<br/>
time-consuming and inconvenient to those who have to do this<br/>
hand-formatting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It wasn't aimed at you directly, just a general comment - and I'm <br/>
not in attack mode :-D And I use outlook express, and I can't <br/>
imagine it is that much different from Outlook, so I am at a loss as <br/>
to what exactly the problem is.  When I hit 'reply' in outlook <br/>
express, the original text is there with all the >>> and then I can <br/>
scroll to wherever I want, click just below the section of text I <br/>
want to respond to, hit enter a few times, and voila, I have space <br/>
to commment. I guess you are saying that in Outlook you can't touch <br/>
the text you are replying to, and have to type at the top?  Sounds <br/>
like a poor excuse for an email system (sorry to the Bill Gates fans <br/>
out there) It isn't a HUGE deal or anything so don't lose any sleep <br/>
over it, but it does keep the format standardized and is easier to <br/>
follow.</div>
