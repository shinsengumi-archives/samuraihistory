<div id="ygrps-yiv-6309207">Hi.<br/>
 Regarding Shogun Total war and the accuracy of it...I believe that if you <br/>
watch the titles at the end of the game or in the manual you will see that <br/>
the developers of the game use Stephen Turnbull in the refinement of the <br/>
details of the battles..Formations,  banners, language, weapons types..etc <br/>
are all very close to what is known of warfare during the Sengoku period <br/>
principally. <br/>
 The names of the clans that you can select are also historical <br/>
characters..Oda, Takeda, Mori etc..all being very well known Buke at the <br/>
time..Only a few quibbles on the game..regarding the Tokugawa house and the <br/>
line it follows from the Imagawa in the first version is wrong..Although on <br/>
the expansion pack I think this has been corrected depending on the era that <br/>
you choose to play in.<br/>
 Territories outlined in the newer version are also very close to reality as <br/>
we know it..Which is why so much of Japan in the earlier periods is claimed <br/>
by the Rebels and Ronin groups..In reality there were many families in many <br/>
areas and it would be impossible to recreate that type of game and make it <br/>
playable also!<br/>
 Overall I think it is easily one of the best recreations of Samurai warfare <br/>
and strategy that you can buy now..Well researched and well thought <br/>
out..Playable and containing easily enough information to keep those of us <br/>
interested in the history side absorbed also..<br/>
 An excellent game.<br/>
