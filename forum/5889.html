<div id="ygrps-yiv-22708939">Hello,<br/>
  My name is Mark. I've read your website on how to make samurai armour & I need some help.(by the way,awesome site!!)  If you could, please give me some more info. on how to lace lames together. I'm making almost every part of my armour out of them. I want to use the KOISHI gashari lame style. My biggest prob. is,... how many holes do i punch out in each lame, where to punch the holes, and if the Sugake Odoshi & Kebiki Odoshi styles of lacing are the right style for it & if so, could you show me how to lace these lames together on a larger scale using those methods???. I have chosen a "plain flat braid" about 3/8" wide. I've been trying to come up w/ a style of armour that i like & i finally came up w/ one..... have you seen the movie the "last samurai"? well..... Katsumoto's armor is the style i fell in love with. It just looks so samurai. I really appreciate your time. Hope to hear from you soon. <br/>
                                       Thanks,<br/>
                                            Mark<br/>

 <br/>
p.s. i'll email you a pic of the armour when i'm done so you can tell me if it looks authentic or not.<br/>
