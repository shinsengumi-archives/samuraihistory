<h3>Who was Goro Nyudo Kiyomitsushi</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182048716">I just joined the group and wondered if perhaps someone <br/>
would know who this man was in Japanese history? His name is <br/>
Goro Nyudo Kiyomitsushi or (Koumitsushi).<br/>
  Thanks, LB</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154003249">Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Firearms were an aid, not the deciding factor. The<br/>
terrain was not conducive to a Takeda charge, the<br/>
combination of the Rengo-gawa river, the mud, and the<br/>
Oda positions in the foothills, combined with the<br/>
palisade, made for a great disruptor. The effect with<br/>
the firearms was definitely a huge factor, but<br/>
considering the Oda had the terrain advantage in<br/>
ADDITION to outnumbering the Takeda 2 to 1, I firmly<br/>
believe that they would have won. Would it have been<br/>
as lopsided? No, it would have been much closer. As it<br/>
was, the fighting was very fierce, and the Oda had<br/>
over 6,000 casualties as it was. <br/>

   Thank You for your help.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that Koumitsu and Kiyomitsu appear to be the same name. <br/>
If I am correct, was the "Kou" used to set Masamune apart from the <br/>
Many Kiyomitsu's that came later?  Thank You, LB<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44689566">Hello.<br/>
I heard Goro Nyudo Masamune(Koumitsushi) had rarely carved his name <br/>
in his swords.But in some of his,the name "Koumitsushi" were used.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder"Kiyo" in Fujiwara Kiyomitsu may sound "Kou" to non-<br/>
Japanese ,but its Kanji is different from "Kou"'s in"Koumitsushi".<br/>

<h3>Royal armouries UK</h3>
by <i>umaryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756886458">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I was at the royal armouries Leeds UK yesterday. as<br/>
always i took loads of photos.<br/>
<br/>
The sword cabinet has changed since my last visit and<br/>
now contains part of a provate collection. This<br/>
included 2 swords by Gassan Sadakazu and Gassan<br/>
Sadakatsu. The Sadakatsu was made to commemorate the<br/>
birth of emperor Akihito.<br/>
<br/>
My favourite was the Nagamaki Naoshi which was<br/>
converted to a katana. Made in around 1300, it had a<br/>
dotanuki  style kissaki.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have privately had photos from me before,<br/>
but to save recieving and sending laods of emails I<br/>
have put them all into zipped files on my web site for<br/>
you to download.<br/>
<br/>
