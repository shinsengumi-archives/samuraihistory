Any true admirers of the Samurai would know the saying...<br/>
 <br/>
"Any Samurai who hopes to come out of a battle to survive it will surely die. A Samurai who knows that he may not survive it shall be victorious." Something along those lines.<br/>
 <br/>
A true Samurai does not fear death but embraces it in the face of his opponent! For it is an honor to die in battle than to run like a coward! Those who have shamed his clan are expected to commit Harikiri or sepuku! Suicide by his own Tanto. To save his and his family's honor! If he is lucky, he will have a "Kaishaku". A close friend or family member to cut off his head with a Katana to end the painful death by disembowelment. It was considered "humane" ironically!<br/>
 <br/>
For the Samurai, death is expected of him. Not failure, but death was thier way of life. They dont glorify death, but accept it as a part of thier duty and honor. Of course they expect to be victorious in battle always! But they also accept death as a part of that victory!<br/>
 <br/>
As for medicine, if a Samurai was not mortally wounded, I heard they used salt to stop the bleeding. A very painful but effective method. A Samurai is also trained to bear the most extreme pain. <br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

Actually, the question was geared toward fiction writing -- hence the need for accurate detail.<br/>
<br/>
The samurai philosophy is clear enough -- heaven knows, there are dozens of books about it.  But as a practical matter, men wounded in battle had to be treated.  Willingness to die notwithstanding, a dead samurai (or ashigaru) is worth less to his master than a living one.  As I understand it, seppuku was reserved for hopeless situations, where the only other option was capture or abject failure (the death of one's daimyo, say).  <br/>
<br/>
I imagine that battlefield medicine was very catch-as-catch-can and based as much on Chinese medicine as was practical, but still, the more specifics I can get, the better off I'll be.  Ditto info regarding disposal of the dead after mass-casualty events.<br/>
<br/>
And lest anyone think I'm some sort of poseur, I will say that I am an Active member of the Horror Writers Association (that is, a member considered to have professional credentials) with a couple dozen published short stories to my name.  Just so's ya know.<br/>
<br/>
Again, any details or good sources would be most helpful!<br/>

As for medicine on the battlefield, the details of that are sketchy at best. Most wounds were deep cuts. Some were bullet wounds by the rifles provided by the Portuguese. Not much was written about that as far as I know. As for the dead bodies, they were burned to stop the spread of disease and as an act of respect for the fallen warriors. For those who were highly sought after, a reward for that certain Samurai's head was offered by the Diamyo of his enemy. It had to be a fresh kill. Decomposition made identifying the face difficult. <br/>
<br/>
I have studied the history of the Samurai not only because it is fascinating but because I am from Samurai bloodlines. Specifically the Harubiyuna. Thier kamon is two arrow feathers inside a circle. One pointing upwards, and one downwards. I find myself both lucky and honored to be the descendant of Samurai. It's truly something to be proud of. Not for anything I have done but to be linked to such a rich history as the Samurai. I am half American, half Japanese. <br/>

Good luck in your writing! I look forward to reading it! Hope I was of some help!<br/>

As I recall there was some very interesting analysis of battlefield<br/>
statistics in "Hired Swords: The Rise of Private Warrior Power in Early<br/>
Japan" by Karl F. Friday. I don't remember if this included detail on<br/>
battlefield medicine or post-battle burial practices, but it did have one<br/>
very interesting revelation: the number one cause of battlefield fatalities<br/>
was ... not sword ... not arrow ... yes, you guessed it - thrown rocks!<br/>

As I recall there was some very interesting analysis of battlefield<br/>
statistics in "Hired Swords: The Rise of Private Warrior Power in Early<br/>
Japan" by Karl F. Friday. I don't remember if this included detail on<br/>
battlefield medicine or post-battle burial practices, but it did have one<br/>
very interesting revelation: the number one cause of battlefield fatalities<br/>
was ... not sword ... not arrow ... yes, you guessed it - thrown rocks!<br/>
<br/>
Worth reading for anyone interested in the period.<br/>
