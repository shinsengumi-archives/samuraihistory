<div id="ygrps-yiv-957874994">Well..... Seeing battle lines are being drawn up I had better take up my position on the defences!!<br/>
<br/>
Stephen Turnbull's books have done more to popularise the military history of the samurai and Japan in the western world than any other author.  Whilst I would agree with some, and I do make some critisism at times, that his work is not perhaps 100% academic, contains some errors and does suffer from a degree of repetition, it has never the less provided a firm foundation over the past 25 years for the "samurai enthusiasts".<br/>
<br/>
Stephen had an interest in Japan and the Far East from his early days and this no doubt helped him in his studies at Cambridge University and obtaining a Doctorate from Leeds with his thesis on the Hidden Christians of Japan. He has ben a member of the Japan Society for many years and is currently an Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of East Asian Studies at the University of Leeds.  So on one point a small correction, he is associated with a great university..  He is also associated with the Samurai Gallery of the UK National Armouries and has acted as consultant to the BBC, The History Channel and "Shogun" anmongst others...<br/>
<br/>
I first met Stephen in the early seventies when he and I were both members of the North Cheshire Military Modelling Society, there his infectious enthusiasm for the topic made me a convert. We still occassionally bump into each other up and down the country. His first book on the samurai published in 1977, "The Samurai: A Military History" was a mammoth task for those days and ignited a thirst for knowledge on the subject in the UK .<br/>
<br/>
My own reasonably extensive library has over 20 Turnbull publications on various aspects of the samurai competing for space with books in japanese, german, french, italian and polish as well as many others in english.  I have much respect for Stephen in that he "put pen to paper" and put "his head above the parapet!" (how's that for mixed metaphors...). It is almost a standing joke between us that my book has yet to come to fruition - but then I am an engineer!  <br/>
<br/>
I would recommend that you view his website and perhaps obtain a couple of the books from a library before you decide to purchase your first... I am presently making my way through the two great volumes of collected papers in his editorial work "The Samurai Tradition"  {published cost over £200} <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks so much Rod. I suppose I was the ignorant victim of (...ahem...) <br/>
American prejudice. Perhaps, because no reference to Cambridge and <br/>
Leeds can be found on most of his books, I believe people assumed he <br/>
was an independent. Thanks again for your comment!<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-729286939">Very very well put. Seems you've got a personal<br/>
connection with the man--that's great. <br/>
<br/>
Turnbull takes a lot of flak for not being very<br/>
"academic". That's fine, as far as most people are<br/>
concerned--how many of us here REALLY care to read<br/>
about the shift in the Kokudaka taxation system and<br/>
it's effects on Sanuki province in 1590? Fascinating<br/>
stuff, let me tell you. <br/>
<br/>
Turnbull has done excellent work in making Samurai<br/>
history ACCESSIBLE. It's popular history--not going to<br/>
win praise from people who shut themselves in academic<br/>
ivory towers, but if someone wants to read about the<br/>
Samurai, they have someone to read--between Turnbull<br/>
and Tony Bryant, that covers about all you'll find in<br/>
your average B.Dalton's. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, Turnbull's work IS repetitive, which can be<br/>
maddening--sometimes it appears that he is a master at<br/>
repackaging in order to make more money. He uses the<br/>
same anecdotes in many of his books--I can find at<br/>
least one that he uses three seperate times. And<br/>
someteimes what he writes is flat wrong, or<br/>
contradictory. I've heard many people criticize that,<br/>
as have I in the past. BUT--while I won't hold him up<br/>
as a paragon of research, did anyone ever stop to<br/>
think that maybe the reason he wrote one thing in 1979<br/>
and something contradictory in 1995 is that he found<br/>
NEW evidence or realized he was wrong? Could be...<br/>
<br/>
No one is perfect. But no one else has made available,<br/>
in English, the sheer amount of information that he<br/>
has--who cares if it's rehashes of Rekishi Gunzo or if<br/>
there are minor mistakes? I'm a qualified Japanese<br/>
linguist according to the US Army (just took my<br/>
recertification test and passed this morning! go me!)<br/>
and Rekishi Gunzo kicks my behind when I try to read<br/>
it! And I'd rather have people confused or mistaking<br/>
the date that a particular battle took place because<br/>
they read Turnbull than believing HALF the crap we see<br/>
come across the board about "ninjas" vs. "samurais"<br/>
and so forth. <br/>
<br/>
I don't think I'd use Turnbull as a major source in a<br/>
doctoral thesis--I'd probably go to HIS sources and<br/>
use them directly. BUT, I have many of his books, plan<br/>
to get more, and they are great to read to get good<br/>
information in an engaging way. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246651891">I'm going to limit my commments--<br/>
<br/>
"...did anyone ever stop to think that maybe the reason he wrote one thing in 1979 and something contradictory in 1995 is that he found NEW evidence or realized he was wrong?"<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure the issue was that he has been rewriting old mistakes - he HASN'T corrected them. He's been reproducing errors along with his other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There is also the issue of outright plagarism from Papinot (not only does he essentially take much of what Papinot wrote word for word, but he includes the errors as well) as well possible plagarism from at least one Rekishi Gunzo picture (an issue where he draws a picture and calls it the 'author's representation' whereas it is actually essentially a hand tracing from one of the Rekishi Gunzo books).  I have never found a citation for Papinot, and I don't know if a blanket citation from Rekishi Gunzo counts for the pic.  I might have missed the Papinot citation, though - and would greatly appreciate it if someone did find one. It would set my mind at ease ;) <br/>
<br/>
Also, although he cites nearly all the Rekishi Gunzo books, it is apparent that in reality he has barely touched them as a resource.

 </span></blockquote>Yep. That's why I said it. He's a good place to<br/>
START--but we should all realize that no author is<br/>
ever free from mistakes 100% of the time. Just because<br/>
you read it in Turnbull or whomever, doesn't make it<br/>
correct, necessarily. It should be cross-checked and<br/>
verified elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
I STILL stand by my point that I'd rather someone<br/>
mistake the date of a battle because they read it<br/>
several times in incorrect Turnbull editions than to<br/>
go off reading half the crap about ninja and samurai<br/>
that people THINK is real. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That's my impression also. That he was an independent,<br/>
and then got associated with some Univ as an outside<br/>
expert. My main problem with Turnbull is that he's<br/>
full of himself--I think it's great to have the info<br/>
in English and accesible, but when he does the above<br/>
mentioned things and tries to pass it off as his great<br/>
original research...<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I'll see your tuppence and raise you 10 yen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590916560">Hi <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Dave<br/>
<br/>
I too was drawn to the Samurai history by his books.<br/>
My girlfriend when I was 17 went mental went I bought<br/>
Samurai a Military history saying i had spent far too<br/>
much on one book.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of that one expensive book (at the time) I<br/>
now have over 180 books on japanese related subjects,<br/>
own several swords and have a successful martial arts<br/>
career that has taken me out of the UK over 30 times<br/>
all over eruope and the uSA to teach.<br/>
<br/>
I know some of the other authors and scholars dont<br/>
like his work, but with out Turnbull we would have a<br/>
small handful of books on Japanese subject<br/>
<br/>
What somepeople have to realise is that Turnbull is<br/>
providing a service to many that otherwise would not<br/>
be available. His books are cheap and full of plenty<br/>
of basic man on the street style info.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry but I think a lot of the attacks on him are<br/>
jealous because he is out there knocking the info out<br/>
and making moneyout of it. I am on several lists and<br/>
apart form one or two names that have a dig at him I<br/>
cant find anything published by the others who<br/>
complain. If you can do better then do it. Just think<br/>
of how many who are interested in Japanese history<br/>
wouldnt be with out Turnbull<br/>
<br/>
I will add however that his ninja books are crap and<br/>
so full of bad informatiion I was amazed he actually<br/>
put some of the stuff in them which he did<br/>

  Subject: [samuraihistory] An opinion on Stephen<br/>
Turnbull's work<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  After studying premodern Japanese history for a few<br/>
years through the texts of the <br/>
  classic American historians (Keene, Varley, Hall,<br/>
etc.), I finally got me a couple of <br/>
  books from Stephen Turnbull. While he is not<br/>
associated with any great University, his <br/>
  work seems to me quite interesting. Perhaps he is<br/>
not an amazing writer ( imean; his <br/>
  style), but he seems to be truly in love with the<br/>
subject, and I really like the way he <br/>
  fills his books with pictures. I am happy this kind<br/>
of (perhaps?) self-made scholarship <br/>
  is available.<br/>
  Since this is the first time I write, I was<br/>
wondering what you "samurai-maniacs" public <br/>
  think of Turnbull in general.<br/>
  Any book you would suggest in particular?<br/>
  Thanx,<br/>
  cepo<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-147223032">I beg to differ - I think the complaint is poor <br/>
scholarship. Like I said, just because you are the only <br/>
show in town, it doesn't make you a good show.  He has no <br/>
competition, so his lazy research gets him by.  There is <br/>
nothing wrong with faulting a scholar for poor <br/>
scholarship.  If you are going to do it, do it right.  For <br/>
whatever reason, he is very topical and misses a lot of <br/>
good research opportunities.  If I had the resources he <br/>
SHOULD have to put together a book on Samurai history, I <br/>
sure as hell would put as much effort into the research as <br/>
possible.  I and others don't get that feeling from his <br/>
books.  I am dissapointed that one would rest on their <br/>
laurels the way he has - a scholar should endeavor to <br/>
contribute more each time around.  But if he isn't a <br/>
scholar, and is just simply a popular writer who likes to <br/>
put out books on samurai history with no qualifications, <br/>
then that is absolutely fine. but if that is the case, he <br/>
should admit it. As it is, his website makes him out to be <br/>
the preeminent scholar of Japanese history in the West, <br/>
which he isn't.  I'd expect better scholarship from such a <br/>
person.  And if you noticed the issues with the "Ninja" <br/>
book (see below) you should understand why the people who <br/>
study japanese military history have issues with his <br/>
"samurai" books.<br/>
I think the issues that people have is not that he is <br/>
making money, but simply shoddy scholarship.  It IS good <br/>
for a solid general overview, but like they say "the <br/>
quality is in the details".<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The book on the Invasions in Korea (actually the invasion went up to <br/>
almost to the Yalu River, so, even if one judged by today boundaries, <br/>
it's not only S.Korea) is not bad. A lot of maps and info from Korean <br/>
sources too. Unfortunately, the crucial role of the Ming Celestial Army <br/>
is generally ignored. So, I'd say it's a good work, but partially <br/>
incomplete.<br/>
