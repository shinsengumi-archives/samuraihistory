<h3>Book Review: The Samurai Film</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-386419579">Here is a new book recently out I thought people here might be <br/>
interested in:<br/>
<br/>
The Samurai Film<br/>
Author:Alain Silver <br/>
Publisher:The Overlook Press <br/>
<br/>
Despite being the oldest, most recognisable and arguably the most <br/>
popular genre in Japanese film, the samurai film has had <br/>
surprisingly little written about in book form outside its home <br/>
territory. Most of what exists in English forms part of studies on <br/>
Akira Kurosawa, and for a very long time the only real publication <br/>
devoted to the genre remained Alain Silver's The Samurai Film, which <br/>
first appeared back in 1977. The situation is about to change <br/>
though, and not a moment too soon, what with the renewed interest in <br/>
the genre through the efforts of Quentin Tarantino and Tom Cruise. <br/>
The second half of 2005 not only sees the return of Silver's tome in <br/>
an updated and expanded third edition, but also the publication of a <br/>
brand new volume, Patrick Galloway's Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The <br/>
Samurai Film Handbook.<br/>
<br/>
You could easily construe the lack of coverage of the genre as a <br/>
testament to the thorough work Silver put into his tome. The Samurai <br/>
Film has always been one of the standard publications on Japanese <br/>
cinema in English, covering the genre with great erudition and <br/>
perceptiveness. With so many of the standard works on Japanese film <br/>
disappearing from the shelves due to a publishing industry <br/>
increasingly obsessed with bestseller rankings and Oprah's reading <br/>
list, Overlook Press deserves a big round of applause for <br/>
resurrecting Silver's study for a new generation. Granted, they <br/>
probably wouldn't have taken the chance if Kill Bill and The Last <br/>
Samurai had flopped. The author obliges by adding an entirely new <br/>
chapter in which both films feature prominently, but, characteristic <br/>
of the book's approach as a whole, he places these foreign tributes <br/>
into the proper context of the chanbara genre's evolution over the <br/>
past twenty-odd years.<br/>
<br/>
The Samurai Film is still every bit as thorough as it ever was. <br/>
Silver takes the time to define everything from narrative and <br/>
character types, via the use and function of violence, to the roots <br/>
of the celluloid samurai in fact, art and fiction - all before the <br/>
first film is even mentioned. Key directors (Kurosawa, Gosha, <br/>
Okamoto, Shinoda), series (including perennial fan favourites <br/>
Zatoichi - expanded to include the Kitano version - and The Sleepy <br/>
Eyes of Death), characters (like Musashi Miyamoto) and individual <br/>
films are scrutinised and discussed in great depth. The chapter on <br/>
Hideo Gosha (he and Kurosawa the only directors to have an entire <br/>
chapter dedicated to them) still stands as the single most important <br/>
and authoritative piece of writing on this great director (but what <br/>
a shame that almost no one has followed suit and actually released a <br/>
few of his films...).<br/>
<br/>
The author's approach regularly results in close textual analysis, <br/>
but he always works from the larger framework of demonstrating, by <br/>
way of his various test cases, how the genre functions and to what <br/>
ends. The results never cross the line into becoming ham-fisted or <br/>
bogged down in jargon. A great example are the few paragraphs <br/>
devoted to Throne of Blood, in which Silver very succinctly tells us <br/>
exactly why Kurosawa is a great filmmaker - without ever resorting <br/>
to hackneyed talk of humanism and rousing epics.<br/>
<br/>
Silver's point of departure for his analyses is always the film <br/>
itself. He never attempts to hammer his subjects into any kind of <br/>
theoretical mould, which is exactly why The Samurai Film is still <br/>
every bit as pertinent as it was thirty years ago. Had the author <br/>
placed his labours within any of the critical frameworks popular at <br/>
the time of its original publication, the text would by now have <br/>
felt badly dated and the book would have become a relic. Instead, it <br/>
achieves what all great film analysis does: it helps you understand <br/>
the genre and the films better, and thereby enjoy them all the more <br/>
as a result. With the updated text it's destined to hold up for <br/>
probably quite a few decades to come. Like many of the movies it <br/>
discusses, The Samurai Film is a bona fide classic. Mandatory <br/>
reading for anyone interested in Japanese film.<br/>

<br/>
I've read the book. It was interesting and I'm glad that more books are <br/>
coming out about samurai film. But I preferred Patrick Galloway's approach, as his <br/>
language was a lot clearer, not so much the language of a "film critic" in an <br/>
obvious way. Silver's book is sometimes almost incomprehensible and incoherent <br/>
to anyone who isn't a film student or critic, just my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
And also, I had several quibbles with his analysis of SEPPUKU, which I'll <br/>
post later if anyone is interested. <br/>
