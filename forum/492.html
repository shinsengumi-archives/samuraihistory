<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744368610">In no way do I mean to be rude by BCC-ing this mail to everyone, but it would be rather intensive to mail each list personally,<br/>
seeing as I'm on over 30 of them!<br/>
<br/>
So please do not be offended by this mail.<br/>
I formerly apologise for it's off-topic-ness, because this is a mail for a few reasons, some irrelevant. Please read on.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone that has ever replied to my queries. Your guidance on my many questions has helped me understand the little<br/>
and the large things in  life over the year that I've been on these lists.<br/>
To you, I say thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I need to leave you is because I need to brave the big world alone now, as I'm moving to pastures anew. I have left home,<br/>
and will be unable to continue my life of relative luxury as I have it now at home with my parents.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there are not the facilities in my new home to keep up with the huge volume of mail that I regularly get off of the<br/>
lists that I have subscribed to.<br/>
Thus, it would be best to leave for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I will miss reading the mails that have been posted on all the lists that I'm on, as they have held huge volumes of information for<br/>
me, and will continue to do so in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to EVERYONE who's helped either me and even everyone else, because in helping them, you've already shown me how to<br/>
overcome their ailment should it ever befall me.<br/>
<br/>
I will miss you all!!!!<br/>

But you're probably thinking of the big battle of Sekigahara in October of<br/>
1600.<br/>
