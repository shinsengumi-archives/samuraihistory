Hi.  One of the most famous individuals believed to have painted himself is <br/>
the well-known swordsman Miyamoto Musashi.  His (alleged) self-portrait can <br/>
be seen in D. T. Suzuki's 'Zen and Japanese Culture' (last published, I <br/>
believe, in 1993 by Princeton in their 'Mythos' series.).<br/>

<br/>
I have not looked at the book myself, but you may want to have a look at:<br/>
<br/>
_Samurai Painters_ by Stephen Addiss and G. Cameron Hurst III.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, the bibliography and notes should be useful.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
