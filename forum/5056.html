<h3>Kaishaku</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-997326107">In Muso Shinden Ryu iaido, at the Shoden level, taken from the <br/>
Omori Ryu, the technique for kaishaku is known as 'jun-to' and <br/>
we were taught it was 'bad form' to demonstrate this at a public <br/>
display.<br/>
<br/>
The previous post is right in that the neck is not completely <br/>
severed to prevent the head from rolling away.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the kaishaku is free to strike at a moment of his own <br/>
choosing, (and the condemned might state when). Usually this <br/>
was after the cut was made, but in later years it was acceptable <br/>
for the kaishaku to strike at the moment the condemned man <br/>
reaches for his own blade - this act demonstating the <br/>
condemned man's determination to take his own life.<br/>
