I have been living in Yokohama for 4 years and was quite surprised to hear about this bleak part of Yokohama`s past. I figure there must be some kind of memorial, shrine or, at least a sign marking the site - but, thus far, no luck at all in finding it. <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Seeking info on imperial court protocols and Kyoto imperial palace layout</h3>
by <i>omajinchan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500013569">Greetings --<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone can recommend a good resource on the protocols required of visitors to the imperial court during the Heian era and / or a map of the layout.  (It is visible on Google Earth, but none of the buildings are labeled, and of course it is not commonly open to the public.  I've been to Kyoto a half dozen times or more and have never been inside the palace grounds.)<br/>

Any help would be much appreciated!<br/>

for, but it sounds like the kind of information that could be found in the<br/>
appendix to *A Tale of Flowering Fortunes* trans. by William H. and Helen<br/>
Craig McCullough (the actual text will probably help as well, but is less<br/>
searchable).  The other one I would recommend is *World of the Shining<br/>
Prince* by Ivan Morris.  As I recall, they both give some information on the<br/>
layout of the palace.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the modern palace really doesn't resemble the Heian palace.  Too many<br/>
changes and the actual government offices are no longer present.<br/>
<br/>
Have you done a Google search for the Heian palace, yet?  Maps of the layout<br/>
are pretty common.<br/>

I have been living in Yokohama for 4 years and was quite surprised to hear about <br/>
this bleak part of Yokohama`s past. I figure there must be some kind of <br/>
memorial, shrine or, at least a sign marking the site - but, thus far, no luck <br/>
at all in finding it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks. <br/>

Just wondering if anyone can recommend a good resource on the protocols required of visitors to the imperial court during the Heian era and / or a map of the layout. (It is visible on Google Earth, but none of the buildings are labeled, and of course it is not commonly open to the public. I've been to Kyoto a half dozen times or more and have never been inside the palace grounds.)<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be much appreciated!<br/>

A very interesting article, and well written, but I am confused by the statement <br/>
that the prisoner was blindfolded, and then a little later, his eyes were <br/>
smiling. How is it possible to see such an expression on a face that has a <br/>

A macabre question I know but - does anyone have any information regarding the <br/>
exact location of the old Tokugawa era execution ground in Yokohama? In a book I <br/>
was recently reading, "Young Japan: Yokohama and Yedo" by John R. Black, the <br/>
author writes about witnessing an execution sometime in the 1860`s in the Tobe <br/>
area of Yokohama. Also a journalist in Japan in 1880 wrote a story about the <br/>
execution ground. You can see the story here: <br/>

I'd have to look at it again to see if it has exactly what you are looking<br/>
for, but it sounds like the kind of information that could be found in the<br/>
appendix to *A Tale of Flowering Fortunes* trans. by William H. and Helen<br/>
Craig McCullough (the actual text will probably help as well, but is less<br/>
searchable). The other one I would recommend is *World of the Shining<br/>
Prince* by Ivan Morris. As I recall, they both give some information on the<br/>
layout of the palace.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the modern palace really doesn't resemble the Heian palace. Too many<br/>
changes and the actual government offices are no longer present.<br/>
<br/>
Have you done a Google search for the Heian palace, yet? Maps of the layout<br/>
are pretty common.<br/>
