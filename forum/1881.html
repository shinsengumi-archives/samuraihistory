<h3>Care of a sword</h3>
by <i>samuariempath</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-232801407">Well, first thing to know, and you likely do, what the blade is made <br/>
out of. Some are Aluminium and some are steel, i'll talk about <br/>
shapening in a moment. Either way the blade should be taken out of <br/>
it's funishings every once in a while for a whole cleaning though <br/>
mostly leave it as is and do the blade. As to blade care, it should <br/>
be rubbed clean with silk or someother non marking cloth before being <br/>
oiled.This will remove any old oil or bits of dirt, dust ect. I know <br/>
you can buy various cleaning kits( i don't remember at the moment <br/>
which is the best oil, though likely rice oil or some such thing.<br/>
<br/>
After figuring out what type of metal the blade is then you can think <br/>
about sharpening. Aluminium you SOULD NOT SHARPEN as it will ruin the <br/>
blade and cause it to rust very quickly. As for steel if you intened <br/>
to use it in any sort of combat or otherwise you should get someone <br/>
to professionaly sharpen it. <br/>
<br/>
But maybe you should check with your friend see what they think, some <br/>
feel it to be a dishonor to sharpen something that came unsharpend. <br/>
It's likely that they could not have even gotten it to you if it was <br/>
sharpend, laws about that are very strict and every nihon has to be <br/>
registered anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Wisdom<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954561928">Perhaps you could post pictures of this sword ? That way someone will be<br/>
able to tell you immediately what you have. <br/>
 <br/>
If you have a true nihonto this might help for the care of it:<br/>
