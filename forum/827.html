<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379259192">Does anyone 'know' battle axes?  This is an interesting string - but <br/>
my image of a battle axe seems to parallel IGANOKAMI's.  I have the <br/>
image of a really unbalanced weapon, if you hit, you win, if you <br/>
miss, you are dead... or am I wrong about axes made for battle - are <br/>
they light enough to recover quickly from a missed swing?  Maybe a <br/>
thin blade that you grasp near the blade rather than low on the <br/>
handle like a baseball bat...?  I know swords and staffs, not cudgels <br/>
and axes...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466340910">Hi<br/>
<br/>
he only battle axe I know of is the Ono and masakari.<br/>
<br/>
The Ono is supposed to be quite big. Ihave apic<br/>
somewhere which I can find and post.<br/>
<br/>
I have been told that one branch of the Shindenfudo<br/>
Ryu once used the Ono but I have been unable to<br/>
comfirm it.<br/>
<br/>
I think I saw one in use in the Ghost story movie -<br/>
Kwaidan in the story called Hoichi the earless<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659086239">Well, I think that the weapon was more effective than you may think. The<br/>
"Vikings" from Scandinavia often used a large battle axe in their left<br/>
hand so as to catch their opponents on their unshielded side. At the<br/>
same time they could carry a smaller lighter weapon with which to defend<br/>
themselves whilst they were getting ready for another blow with their<br/>
axe. Does anyone know if the samurai ever carried two weapons at once<br/>
like this, especially an axe and a tanto? I think an axe and a katana or<br/>
nodachi would be too much to handle.<br/>
