<br/>
The big fight scenes in samurai swashbucklers used to unfold like<br/>
dance numbers, with the hero as the prima, the attackers as the corps<br/>
de ballet. The audience was expected to admire the virtuoso<br/>
choreography and bravura turns, while ignoring the absence of blood,<br/>
just as they would at a Kabuki play. <br/>
<br/>
Now the samurai movie and its variants are back, but the model has<br/>
changed. Films like Hiroyuki Nakano's "Red Shadow," Hideyuki<br/>
Hirayama's "Makai Tensho (Samurai Resurrection)" and Ryuhei Kitamura's<br/>
"Azumi" are closer to video games than Kabuki or ballet. The fighters<br/>
have highly distinct powers, costumes and physiques, but little depth<br/>
-- they are types, not individuals. The story is a series of fight<br/>
scenes, with the supporting players falling by the wayside (or<br/>
vanishing into a clouds of pixels), until only the hero and the leader<br/>
of the bad guys are left to duel it out. The ending, unlike the final<br/>
"boss" stage of a game, is a foregone conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Ten Shimoyama's "Shinobi," with its story of two warring ninja clans<br/>
in the early days of the Tokugawa era, follows this game formula --<br/>
but with differences that make it a cut above the genre run. A<br/>
king-of-all-media type who has directed everything from TV dramas to a<br/>
theme-park attraction, Shimoyama aspires to the epic, mythic quality<br/>
of Zhang Yimou's "Hero" or Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"<br/>
-- and attains it surprisingly often. I say "surprisingly" because<br/>
most Japanese films in this genre settle for the surface flash and<br/>
dazzle of the arcade. Shimoyama may be aiming at the same teen gamer<br/>
market, but takes his material more seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the effects supplied by CG director Hiroyuki Hayashi are in the<br/>
service of the story and characters, not simply for eye-popping<br/>
display. Some are dazzling, as when the hero, Gennosuke (Joe Odagiri),<br/>
uses superhuman powers of concentration to see water tumbling over a<br/>
waterfall in ultravivid slow motion. Or as when the heroine, Oboro<br/>
(Yukie Nakama), pierces a foe with her glance (her eyes changing color<br/>
in the process) and shorts out his synapses, in a sequence that<br/>
resembles an animated medical drawing in hyper-realistic 3-D.<br/>
<br/>
These and other feats derive from the ninjas' training and abilities,<br/>
not simply from cartoonlike superpowers. Impossibly exaggerated, yes;<br/>
verging on the absurd, no. Also, they defeat each other more with<br/>
their smartness than brute power displays. Again, not the standard<br/>
zap-'em-till-they-vaporize model.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Yukie Nakama, a TV drama queen whose film work has been on<br/>
the light comic side, exudes dynamism, passion and sensuality, as<br/>
though she prepped with the films of Zhang Ziyi. The usual strategy<br/>
for an actress in a superhero role is to butch up, either successfully<br/>
(Angelina Jolie in "Tomb Raider") or unconvincingly (Aya Ueto in<br/>
"Azumi"). Nakama never abandons her femininity, even when she is being<br/>
the fiery warrior. Conversely, she never loses her steely ninja<br/>
spirit, even as a woman in love.<br/>
<br/>
She plays Oboro, a granddaughter of Ogen (Lily), the matriarch of the<br/>
Iga clan. Early in the story, she meets and falls in love with<br/>
Gennosuke, the son of Danjo Koga (Minoru Terada), the leader of the<br/>
Koga clan. Living in the remote mountains, these two clans have, over<br/>
the centuries, perfected the arts of ninjutsu (or shinobi), which is<br/>
far beyond the reach of mere mortals. They are also ancestral rivals<br/>
and, under the order of Hanzo Hattori (Yutaka Matsushige), chief ninja<br/>
to Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, are forbidden to exchange secret techniques<br/>
-- not that they would anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Seeking to consolidate Tokugawa rule and seeing the two clans as a<br/>
threat to it, a powerful Tendai priest and Tokugawa adviser, Nankobo<br/>
Tenkai (Renji Ishibashi), schemes to set them against each other. He<br/>
commands the two clans to each choose five champions who will battle<br/>
to the death. The survivor will be elevated in rank and power.<br/>
<br/>
Both Oboro and Gennosuke are selected as champions, but neither are<br/>
aware, at least initially, of each other's position. Also, Gennosuke<br/>
doubts the shogunate's good intentions and refuses to take part in the<br/>
contest. But when his comrades begin to fall, he is forced into<br/>
action. He cannot, however, bring himself to battle at least one Iga<br/>
warrior: Oboro.<br/>
<br/>
The 10 contestants in this ultimate death match are radically<br/>
different from both the common run of humanity and each other, such as<br/>
the bizarro Saemon Kisaragi (Hoka Kinoshita) of the Kogas, who can<br/>
change faces without cosmetic surgery, and the mysterioso Yashamaru<br/>
(Taku Sakaguchi) of the Igas, who is the long-haired ninja equivalent<br/>
of "The Incredibles' " Elastigirl.<br/>
<br/>
The most memorable, however, are ones with the closest relationships<br/>
to the two principals, including the lovely-but-creepy Kagero (Tomoka<br/>
Kurotani), who is poison to her enemies, but sweet on Gennosuke, and<br/>
Tenzan Yakushi (Kippei Shiina), a silver-haired ninja master who knows<br/>
all and sees all, including Oboro's conflicted heart.<br/>
<br/>
For those less interested in the emotional interplay than the action,<br/>
"Shinobi" has much to offer beyond the usual wirework leaps and<br/>
bounds. Action director Yuji Shimomura has created fresh variations on<br/>
familiar ninja stunts that will have hard-core genre fans doing "did I<br/>
really see that?" takes.<br/>
<br/>
"Shinobi" does not require shinbo (patience): It flies across the<br/>
screen and ends, after all the mayhem, with a poignant moment of<br/>
remembrance and hope. Super ninjas may not be forever, but love endures.<br/>
