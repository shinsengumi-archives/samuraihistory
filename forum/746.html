<h3>Question for all of you</h3>
by <i>debunaru</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891567390">I'm a new member of this group. I'm studying japanese and I'm doing a<br/>
little research on sengoku jidai.<br/>
 <br/>
My question is : Who are the man behind Hideyoshi's success and why. And<br/>
like to know also reasons, why do you think that they influenced him and<br/>
helped him on his way to unification.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for cooperation. It would be a great help for me, if you could<br/>
answer my question.<br/>
