<h3>&#39;Sendoku Jidai&#39; Japanese question</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385681267">Hopefully someone here can read this:<br/>

<br/>
This is Kenshin talking about his hero Minamoto Yoshitsune.  My best <br/>
estimate is he is saying something to the effect of "I learned my <br/>
military affairs/skills from Yoshitsune.  People read the Heike <br/>
monogatari without utilizing it, I utilize Yoshitsune's military <br/>
[whatever]" The end of the last sentence in particular is throwing <br/>
me.  <br/>
<br/>
If the Japanese doesn't come out here, I've also uploaded it here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140410251">Hi there.<br/>
  Me again.  :-D  I tried both and neither came out.  But in any event, I <br/>
can't read japanese characters.  So could someone please tell me what Uesugi <br/>
was saying about Minamoto?  :-D   (Honestly, I'd love to learn to read <br/>
Japanese for myself, but I really don't have the time to ferret out the <br/>
resources and then learn it with my job and my writing and other hobbies.  If <br/>
I did, I would, though, b/c I've got a love of languages and histories that <br/>
won't quit, and I do desire to learn it, but just not enough of the other <br/>
stuff, like, as I said, time.  :-D)  Anyway, thanks.  :-D<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735336605">Hi,<br/>
My translation for the last sentence is "Reading his military <br/>
affairs,I compare myself with him".It's rather literally.<br/>
It implies his concideration like,"If I were Yoshitsune,how would I <br/>
fight in those sitiation?".<br/>
<br/>
Please be patient with my poor English,anyway,you've already got its <br/>
proper image.<br/>

I thought that I had Japanese text support installed and I have NJStar Asian Explorer, but I could not make the garbage that arrived on my PC from your email or your WEB Site even come near a set of japanese characters.....<br/>

Is it possible to give me some simple tutoring or even point me to a site that can assist!! My Japanes is pretty basic so a japanese site would not help greatly.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/,">http://www.microsoft.com/,</a> and do the 'windows update' thing ("Scan <br/>
for updates").  You need to download the 'Japanese language support', <br/>
and if you download the "Japanese IME", you will be able to input <br/>
Japanese as well.  Then when you hit a webpage that is in Japanese, <br/>
just right click on it, and choose 'encoding', then choose "Japanese <br/>
Auto Select", and you'll be able to see it.<br/>
