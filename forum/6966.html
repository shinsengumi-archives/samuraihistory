 </span></blockquote>You can't shorted Japanese names "according to English principles" <br/>
and have them mean anything to other Japanese.  If your story was to <br/>
take place in Japan, "Tad" wouldn't mean anything to another <br/>
Japanese person.  They don't shorten names like that. If it takes <br/>
place in an English speaking place around English speakers, then <br/>
obviously that wouldnt matter.  As for "Makoto", what's wrong <br/>
with "Mack"?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Does this mean that your character is in the present<br/>
time? Time period makes a big difference in Japanese<br/>
personal names. Not too many "Daisuke"s running around<br/>
in the 1400s, but there are plenty now. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I cannot use Makoto for the forename.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not? Knowing why not might help us suggest an<br/>
alternative. <br/>
<br/>
 I would prefer<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > the forename to<br/>
> be easily shortened according to English principles<br/>
> (i.e. "Tad" for<br/>
> Tadaka), <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As Kitsuno said, the Japanese don't shorten their<br/>
names according to "English" principles. If you are<br/>
having him interact with non-Japanese characters for<br/>
the most part, then I can see them giving him an<br/>
"English" nickname, like the example you use above.<br/>
(Being as "Tad" is unpronounceable by a Japanese, it's<br/>
not likely to stick--it would come out "Tada" or<br/>
"Taddo". I'm not familiar with 'Tadaka' as a given<br/>
name either, but I suppose it could be one...maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
More and more Japanese given names ARE short<br/>
enough--hard to shorten "Shinya" or "Jun", though<br/>
"Jun" could itself be short for "Junpei",<br/>
"Junichirou", or 1000 other names. You could take<br/>
"Daisuke" and make it "Dice" (kinda cool), or<br/>
Ryuutarou and make it "Ryu", or something like that. <br/>
<br/>
and I would like the surname to be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > connected to any<br/>
> well-known samurai family or clan in Japanese<br/>
> history, preferably<br/>
> someone heroic. Ideally in the Shimazu family, but<br/>
> not necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the Shimazu family? Then you've got your<br/>
name--Shimazu. If you mean connect ed to the Shimazu<br/>
family, I'm sure someone here can dig up the names of<br/>
a few of their retainer families. Something that<br/>
recognizable would be a little odd, but not unheard<br/>
of, and that may be the effect you are going for. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I do not read or speak Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Happy to help--but I'm not going to just throw random<br/>
names out there without getting a better idea of what<br/>
you are looking for. I don't know whether the others<br/>
who've chimed in (sans Kitsuno, who I know speaks<br/>
Japanese) have any knowledge or background, but for<br/>
myself, I live in Japan, speak Japanese, watch way too<br/>
much TV, and generally am surrounded by Japanese names<br/>
all the time. Let me know if your time period is<br/>
modern or historical, what meanings you're hoping to<br/>
include (you did in the email, so I can go with those<br/>
if nothing else) and clarify the "nickname" thing, and<br/>
we should be able to help.<br/>

Forgive me, I hadn't gotten to your reply here when I<br/>

Ken's a pretty reliable standby, isn't it? And<br/>

that many Japanese names are shortened according to<br/>

would be in the 16th century or so. Helps to know when<br/>
we're talking about.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um...yeah. If I used the name "Jim" in a story, that<br/>
doesn't mean anyone named Jim would be suing me if<br/>
they didn't like what I wrote. So yes, you need to say<br/>
more for me to understand why you can't use it. Though<br/>
I suppose "I don't want to" would explain it well<br/>
enough.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Canadian-born Japanese, not Japanese-born Japanese.<br/>
"Tad" isn't pronounceable to a native Japanese<br/>
speaker--the only final consonant in Japanese is "N",<br/>
so Tad would come out "Taddo". But, if he's being<br/>
given the nickname by non-Japanese, then it would<br/>
follow their patterns, not Japanese ones. Assuming the<br/>
American/Canadian/whatever in your story are the ones<br/>
giving him the nickname, this should be fine.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&#22823;&#21161;&#12288;"Great Help"--could almost be<br/>
stretched to "Savior", without getting biblical or<br/>
anything. Dai is Big, Great, etc.; Suke used above is<br/>
the same as tasukeru, to save. It's a given name, not<br/>
a family name--are you looking for family names also?<br/>

<br/>
&#29978;&#22826;&#37070; Jintarou<br/>
&#37325;&#22826;&#37070; Juutarou<br/>
&#29978;&#20116;&#37070; Jingorou<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a name dictionary, so I can only help a<br/>
little on the names he's given. "Tarou"<br/>
太郎 means "Eldest son" or "First Son".<br/>
When I typed in the names in Japanese, the above is<br/>
what came out. Not sure what the "Jin" is in the first<br/>
and third names, but "Juu" means heavy<br/>
(omoi--重い). The "Gorou" in the third<br/>
means "5th Son". <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Another person reccomended Reiichi as being<br/>

doesn't actually contain anything like -rou that says<br/>
son, but it's implied, really.) That's what I come up<br/>
with. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189734399">Thanks Nate, all very helpful.<br/>
Congratulations on being a Dad.. I've just found out<br/>
I'm going to be an Auntie.<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify, if you are interested -<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The character in the novel is based very closely on a<br/>
true-life person with the name Makoto. <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, as I said, the character (and the story) are<br/>
based on real events and people, and in this 'real<br/>
event / people' situation, believe it or not the name<br/>
Tad was used by the persons Japanese speaking/ born<br/>
friends. Perhaps they didn't originally give it to<br/>
him, but there you go. The Japanese in the story/truth<br/>
spent most of their lives in Canada, probably explains<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your help!<br/>
<br/>
all the best.<br/>
