Following up episode 3 which covered the history of gun in Japan up to the introduction of Western guns by the Portuguese in the 1540's, this episode examines the history of the gun during the Sengoku period.<br/>
<br/>
From the 1540's through the battle of Nagashino and on until the end of the Sengoku period (Approx. 1477-1615) , Western guns in Japan played a bigger and bigger role in war and revolutionized warfare during the 16th century.<br/>
<br/>
In this podcast, your hosts examine the use and distribution of Western guns during this time with records of the numbers of guns held by Daimyo armies and deployed in battle, and how warfare changed during this period.<br/>
