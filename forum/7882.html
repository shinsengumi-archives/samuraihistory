<h3>The &#39;Image&#39; of the Samurai</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367391410">Well here's a topic for contention.<br/>
<br/>
The classical warrior image is of the mounted archer, and really, from then on the samurai <br/>
went into decline. The Onin wars nearly finished him off, and in the Sengoku the ethos <br/>
reached its lowest ebb, and the emerging Tokugawa shogunate set about restoring the <br/>
image as one of virtue and propriety.<br/>
<br/>
But the heart of the samurai is personal pride and a profound sense of self-determination, <br/>
his alliances were always pragmatic - he served whom it suited him most to serve - and <br/>
the regularity with which he changed side and allegiance demonstrates.<br/>
<br/>
Aside:<br/>
Ieyasu seems always even-handed in his treatment of his retainers, which earned their <br/>
loyalty, because they could trust him. Of course, he had Nobunaga's example to go by.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, however - if Ieyasu could have done away with the sammurai after the bakafu <br/>
was safely established - would he have done so?<br/>
<br/>
To me 'the sword is the soul of the samurai' shifts the emphasis away from the man, and <br/>
is all part of the 'cult of the Tokugawa' in that the man now has something to live up to <br/>
outside of himself - and the person he should aspire to be was founded on Confucian <br/>
ethic of service to the state. - precisely because the Tokugawa did not want a military <br/>
class with such a strong sense of self-determination and self-reliance.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the occasions when samurai were brought before the court for acting 'properly' - the <br/>
instant redress of perceived offence - always put the bakafu in a difficult position - they <br/>
wanted a samurai bound by his code of honour, but they were stuck then when he acted <br/>
without asking their permission first.<br/>
<br/>
Just a personal view, but it seems to me the bakafu always 'fudged' the issue when faced <br/>
with the question of self-determination v subjugation to the state.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261445725">Great points. I'm not a history expert. But from what I've read and seen, it<br/>
seems that the Tokugawa shogunate was one of the most effective<br/>
authoritarian governments that ever existed. It survived for 250+ years. One<br/>
of the ways it survived was in "taming" the samurai class, once there were<br/>
no longer any wars. The daimyo were "tamed" by the system of every other<br/>
year having to live in Edo and his wife and children basically being kept<br/>
hostage there. The "common" ordinary retainers were "tamed" by instituting<br/>
codes of conduct that emphasized an interpretation of Confucian thought<br/>
where serving the bakufu was what a "superior man" must do. The bakufu<br/>
appears to have discouraged self-reliance and even discouraged service to<br/>
one's daimyo unless it also meant service to the bakufu. As you said,<br/>
sayings such as "the sword is the soul of the samurai" were used to shift<br/>
the emphasis away from the samurai as an individual toward having the<br/>
samurai subsume his individuality to serve the best interests of the<br/>
Tokugawa state. <br/>
<br/>
The huge "sword of Damocles" that the Tokugawa shogunate held over the<br/>
daimyo and their retainers was the threat of clan abolishment, where the<br/>
fate of the clansmen was either seppuku (mostly for the daimyo and higher<br/>
officials) or for retainers, being thrust into the essentially non-person<br/>
status of ronin. <br/>

Thomas!   Can you are do you have some historic examples of Samrai do these <br/>
acts  with ot seeking permission first.  I would be very interested in hearing <br/>
them.   I am thinking that there would be others new to this; who wold also <br/>
like to hear.  So looking forward to another great post...  although this one <br/>
was interesting;  hmm it raises questions.  Thanks   Robert<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-214776258">I'm not Thomas. But a prime example of this is the famous revenge of the 47<br/>
former Ako retainers. Mainly, they conducted a vendetta without official<br/>
permission. There were provisions in bakufu law where a person who sought to<br/>
avenge the death of someone else could seek a permit from the government.<br/>
However, these permits would put the enemy on notice that a vendeta was<br/>
being sought. The 47 ronin realized that by seeking a permit, they would<br/>
alert Kira, their enemy, who had far superior manpower. They depended upon<br/>
the element of surprise so they planned and carried out their vendetta<br/>
without the lawful permit. <br/>
<br/>
After the attack, there was a rather heated debate about what their fate<br/>
should be. Some argued for executing them as common criminals because of<br/>
conducting a vendetta without government sanction. Others thought that,<br/>
because they avenged their lord's death following cherished Confucian<br/>
principles, that they should be exonerated completely. A compromise was<br/>
struck and they were ordered to die, but could die by seppuku rather than<br/>
being executed as common criminals.<br/>
