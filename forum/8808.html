<h3>Information on Samurai from Fujii Family</h3>
by <i>steven_matsheshu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407216468">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
 I was wondering if you could supply me with any information on :<br/>
<br/>
 Fujii no Kogen<br/>
   and <br/>
  Fujii Taroemon<br/>
 <br/>
     They were brothers... but Kogen served the Amako Clan..and when <br/>
the Amako lost to the Mori, he was forced to shave his head and <br/>
retire... but then he meet with Oda Nobunaga who reinstated his <br/>
samurai status (hired him) and he faught against the Mori. He took <br/>
Kannabe Castle (which he had been running when the Amako were <br/>
around) from the Mori ..but they eventually took it back and he died <br/>
later during the following combat. This was in the Summer of 1569.<br/>
<br/>
      his brother, Fujii Taroemon... actually served the Mori from <br/>
the get go... he was a Naval Captain, I think.... I am pretty sure <br/>
he use to fight Oda's fleets in the waters between West Honshu and <br/>
Shikoku (from Hiroshima to Osaka).  I believe he eventually retired <br/>
and he and one of his sons shaved their heads and became <br/>
monks/priest.. one Shingon and the other to Pure Land... I think.<br/>
<br/>
      The third brother, Fujii Saburoemon... I know nothing about. I <br/>
think he ended up traveling from Bitchu to Hazu-gun in Nagoya.<br/>
<br/>
      The fourth brother.. I have no idea... although I think he <br/>
might be related somehow to Kurozaemon perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
     Anyway..this all took place in West Honshu out in the Mori <br/>
territories (like around Hiroshima and Okayama and Osaka)<br/>
<br/>
   Any info you could find/help me with.. I would appreciate it.<br/>
  <br/>
 Thank you !</div>

Hiroshima to Miyajima in Hiroshima prefecture (Aki<br/>
province). Checking around Hiroshima historical<br/>
websites might help. <br/>
