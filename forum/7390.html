<div id="ygrps-yiv-502325065">Thanks you Mr Eckman.<br/>
I will try to get this book, seems that it could be a<br/>
great support to my research. Until now I had been<br/>
doing cross references between the History of the<br/>
Catholic Church and the History of Japan. This fact<br/>
had made that my research turn to become a synthesis<br/>
effort of two different kind of sources. But it seems<br/>
a good approach to my tutor professors (research<br/>
project) anyway.<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
