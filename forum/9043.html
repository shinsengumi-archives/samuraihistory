Those whom you respect would however be horrified at you showing your <br/>

their respect for you by torturing small animals. Something they may be <br/>
"into" that you most definately wouldn't support. What would *your* reaction <br/>
be?<br/>

  In addition, a small note. A lack of correct punctuation is not the way to <br/>
garner respect on this board. If you wish to be taken seriously, you have to <br/>
show appropriate seriousness in your posts. That includes taking the time <br/>
for capitalization and punctuation.<br/>

   Cite instances of Samurai (not Yakuza who Claim to be following the <br/>
samurai tradition) wearing tattoos. Do you claim that during say, the <br/>
momoyama period, tattoos were socially acceptable by the bushi? The japanese <br/>
perception of tattoos as unclean is a modern only sensibility? The analogy <br/>
works unless of course he *is* into torturing small animals. My point was <br/>
simply something perfectly acceptable to someone in one time and culture <br/>
(tattoos, now, in the West) could be taken as bizarre at the least by <br/>
someone from another time and culture (tattoos in honor of something, then, <br/>
Japan).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Whether *I* feel respectable people don't get tattoos isn't the issue. The <br/>
issue is how tattoos are percieved in Japan. Note *I* have a tat and even <br/>
though most rules Japanese apply to themselves are ignored as baka gaijin <br/>
things when foreigners are concerned, there aren't many onsen I can visit <br/>
due to 1 small tat. Can you cite any "respectable" japanese who have tats <br/>
(entertainers excluded of course)? Note: respectable as it would be applied <br/>
in Japan. I have some japanese friends who have tats and they are great <br/>
people, but none are politicians, CEOs etc.<br/>

who wanted to get body art that reflected his interest in martial arts<br/>
and the Samurai as a personal (maybe even relatively private depending<br/>
on the location) symbol of his own interests, I didn't even consider<br/>
or see any relationship to Japan or the Samurai, which is why I had<br/>
trouble making sense out of what you meant.  I would agree with you if<br/>
he was in/going to Japan and/or wanted to show off his tattoos to<br/>
Japanese people to show how much of a Samurai he is, but I didn't<br/>
really get that impression. It seemed pretty innocent, actually. So<br/>
since it seemed to me that it was an innocent request by an american<br/>
in america, it was easy for me to take your statement as a statement<br/>
of your personal feelings for tattoos.  And I've seen plenty of people<br/>
in Japan with tattoos, it isn't as bad as it used to be.  I even knew<br/>
a Japanese highschool teacher with tattoos around his collarbone,<br/>
where he could hide it.  Schoolteachers are "supposed" to be<br/>
respectable. Anyway, you really can't make a blanket statement that<br/>
"NO 'respectable' Japanese person would get a tattoo", because it<br/>
would only take one person to get one to make your entire statement<br/>
false. I just percieved a subjective argument and played devil's<br/>
advocate and tried to poke holes in it.  That's all.</div>

Tattoos - what an interesting subject.  I've "bought in" to this thread because<br/>
I have seen lots of photos of glorious whole-body tattoos on Japanese men (don't<br/>
know about women) where in some cases the person's skin is willed to be<br/>
preserved.  In fact, I believe there is a museum in Japan where tattooed human<br/>
skins are exhibited.  So, always wanting to expand my knowledge I turned to<br/>
google with only two search keywords - 'tattoo' and 'samurai' inserted without<br/>
quotes.  I got well over 1 million hits!!!  Go here for a history of tattoo and<br/>
samurai in Japan:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tattoos.com/mieko.htm">http://tattoos.com/mieko.htm</a><br/>
One passage reads " Iizawa (1973) and Tamabayashi (1956) report that the custom<br/>
of tattooing is also found among samurai warriors in the sixteenth century. In<br/>
certain areas, the samurai had tattoos for identification."  I venture to<br/>
suggest that this is a very extensive article of considerable interest to those<br/>
on our list.<br/>
