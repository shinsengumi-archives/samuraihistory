Tsunayoshi a fascinating character and would like to know more about <br/>
him. Marius Jansen writes a bit about him in The Making of Modern <br/>
Japan (Harvard UP 2002) "in this case, birth from a plebeian (but highly <br/>
intelligent and famously beautiful) mother and an independent <br/>
upbringing that was not geared for heading the bakufu produced a <br/>
strong-willed and intelligent, albeit idiosyncratic, shogun."<br/>
<br/>
Jansen's sources are: Donald Shively "Tokugawa Tsuyanoshi, the <br/>
Genroku Shogun' in Craig and Shively "Personality in Japanese History <br/>
and<br/>
Beatrice Bodart-Bailey "The Laws of Compassion" in Mon Nip 40/2<br/>
<br/>
Jansen is very good, in the same book, on the Genroku period, and has <br/>
some information on the Shoheiko Academy, the bakufu school, <br/>
though he does not indicate that this was founded by Tsunayoshi.<br/>
<br/>
I guess for insights into contemporary culture the plays of Chikamatsu <br/>
would be invaluable. Donald Shively has written on this too.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a very good book called Edo Culture by Nishiyama <br/>
Matsunosuke (U of Hawaii Press 1997). It has all sorts of interesting <br/>
information on food, cooking, travel, theatre and music, and so on. Not <br/>
many references to Tsunayoshi but one of them tells of the Kashima <br/>
Oracle's denunciation of the dog kennels and bad policies of the Dog <br/>
Shogun.<br/>
<br/>
There must be lots of Japanese biographies of him - maybe even a <br/>
taiga :)<br/>
<br/>
please post any other information that you've discovered.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720760883">These may be a bit rarified, but probably the best place to start is "Shiryo ni Yoru Nihon no Ayumi."  This has a good overview of sources for the Tokugawa period, both primary and secondary.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Along with consulting the works cited, you probably should familiarize yourself with the Chu Hsi or the neo-Confucian movement, which Tsunayoshi was a major force behind.  This was also the period of the 47 Ronin and you might want to check out some of the historical sources and commentaries on this famous play.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Probably the most accessable source of the period of Tsunayoshi's reign would be the well-known memoirs of Engelbert Kaempfer, a Dutch trader who was one of the few people who got see what was happening in Japan outside Nagasaki.<br/>
<br/>
  From the Japanese side, I can only think that Arai Hakuseki's memoirs might be useful.  <br/>
   <br/>
  As always, my favorite general history of Japan is George Sansom's Three vol history from the beginning of time through the Meiji Resotration.  There is a brief overview of Tsunayoshi's career at the beginning of chapter XI.<br/>
   <br/>
  I hope this is a help to you. I would be interested in hearing what others might have to say about these sources. <br/>
