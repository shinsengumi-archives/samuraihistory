 <br/>
My name is Sheldon and I have recently become interested in the history<br/>
of samurai warriors and life in feudal Japan (especially the later<br/>
period). I can tell by reading your emails that you all know what u are<br/>
talking about and I would be very grateful if u could suggest some<br/>
websites books and anything relating to samurai history. I have already<br/>
got my hands on some books (by Stephen Turnbull who I am told is<br/>
somewhat of an expert in this field) but I am looking for books that<br/>
focus more on the armor and the mons of the samurai. Any information<br/>
will be greatly appreciated<br/>

<h3>Nagashino</h3>
by <i>ltdomer98</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-948428203">Ladies & Gentlemen of the Forum:<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for sources (published or online) on the<br/>
Battle of Nagashino (1575) for an Army research<br/>
project. I have Turnbull's "Nagashino 1575", in<br/>
addition to his "Samurai Battles" and "Samurai<br/>
Sourcebook". I also have Rekishi Gunzo #27 Shincho-ki.<br/>
I need something besides Turnbull as far as English<br/>
language sources go, and of course any Japanese<br/>
resources would be a plus. This is a battle analysis<br/>
paper for a US Army intelligence course, so I really<br/>
need sources that concentrate on the battle (in other<br/>
words, general histories don't do a whole lot for me.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your help is appreciated, <br/>
<br/>

The Takeda by Two Dragons (daisho publications) certainly mentions <br/>
this battle in some detail, but I do not have the booklet with me at <br/>
work and cannot remember what sources they used and the depth of <br/>
content.<br/>
<br/>
I am quite sure I have another set of writings on Nagashino but I <br/>
might be mixing up one of my Turnbull books.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not have the information you require by the weekend, drop <br/>
me a mail at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rob@...">rob@...</a> and I will check through my <br/>
books and also provide information on the Takeda booklet.<br/>
(I work away from home in the week so cannot look before Friday <br/>
evening)<br/>
<br/>
If you do find another source in the meantime, I would be interested <br/>
to know about it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978652292">I've checked all my English sources, and I'm starting to think that <br/>
there are no military historians studying the Sengoku period.  <br/>
Couldn't find any specifics on the battle itself anywhere, just <br/>
examinations of the result and its implications.  I could give you a <br/>
bunch of english sources for 'filler' in the bibliography (let me <br/>
know if you are interested).  <br/>
<br/>
I have a bunch that mention it, although none with much detail.  One <br/>
book worthy of note though is 'The Military Revolution - Military <br/>
inovation and the rise of the West 1500 - 1800' by Geoffrey Parker.  <br/>
Anyone interested in military history should be required to read it.  <br/>
Althogh it focuses on the 'West', it also touches on Japan.  It <br/>
credits Nobunaga (and Japan) with being at least 20 years ahead of <br/>
Europe in the way guns were deployed for battle.  It states, among <br/>
other things, that the Japanese were more interested in improving <br/>
accuracy, whereas Europe was focused on reload time, and Nobunaga's <br/>
use of riflemen in Nagashino in 1575 tackled both problems <br/>
(apparently the 'tanegashima' were considered very accurate).  <br/>
Nobunaga's use of ranks of men firing and moving back to reload wasn't <br/>
even suggested in Europe until the 1590's, and apparently not put into <br/>
general use in Europe until the 1630's.<br/>
<br/>
As for Japanese sources, I have Bessatsu Rekishi Tokuhon 85, "Sengoku <br/>
no Kassen" Japan: Shin Jinbutsu Ôrai Co., 1998.  A solid two page <br/>
description of the battle, with those involved and battle stats is on <br/>
page 144 - 145.<br/>
<br/>
And Rekishi Gunzo #1, "Oda Nobunaga" has a few articles on Nobunaga's <br/>
use of guns, and info on guns in Japan in general, but doesn't appear <br/>
to have any specific info on Nagashino itself.</div>

During Nagakute, Oosuka Yasutaka was in the vanguard in attack <br/>
against Miyoshi Hidetsugu whom he beat, but was then defeated <br/>
himself in a counter attack by Hori Hidemasa.  <br/>
Another time, he attacked Shinano's Ueda castle held by the Sanada, <br/>
but I don't have any other info on that (probably around the time he <br/>
died).  I also don't have any info on his alleged involvement at <br/>
Nagashino.<br/>

He died the the 23rd day of the 6th month of 1589.<br/>

Nobunaga realised the efficiency of salvoe fire after his troops suffered <br/>
from that particular firing technique (conflicts against religious <br/>
factions... Ikko Ikki?). But contrarily to his earlier opponents, he alone <br/>
achieved such a decisive result (thanks in part to the stubborn Takeda <br/>
Katsuyori who was not so "Great" by risking it all on that day).<br/>
Nagashino is a turning point mainly because a famous clan competing for <br/>
supremacy, the Takeda, was eliminated of the contenders and forced to defend <br/>
its lands until it's ultimate downfall several years later.<br/>

I'll take a look when I get home, but I'm assuming it is one of the two.  Unless <br/>
