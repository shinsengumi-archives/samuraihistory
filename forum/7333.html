<br/>

 <br/>
World-renowned director Akira Kurosawa was responsible for such <br/>
classic films as Rashomon, Ikiru, Seven Samurai and The Hidden <br/>
Fortress. Since his passing in 1998, the Criterion Collection has <br/>
done a superb job reissuing some of his most cherished works <br/>
including those mentioned above, as well as Red Beard, Throne of <br/>
Blood, Stray Dog, Sanjuro, Yojimbo and High and Low. Most recently <br/>
the Criterion Collection has released a double disc version of <br/>
Kurosawa's 1980 film Kagemusha. <br/>
<br/>
Although the film was plagued with delays during production, it <br/>
still remains as one of Kurosawa's most poignant works and is given <br/>
an overdue, brilliant treatment on this reissue. <br/>
<br/>
In 1968, Kurosawa collaborated with Japanese directors Masaki <br/>
Kobayashi, Kon Ichikawa and Keisuke Kinoshita to form the Yonki-no-<br/>
kai company. The company's only film, Dodes'ka-Den, released in 1970 <br/>
was a commercial failure. This event, in conjunction with his <br/>
decision to leave the set of the disastrous Tora! Tora! Tora!, sent <br/>
Kurosawa into a deep depression. His depression culminated in an <br/>
attempted suicide in December of 1971. <br/>
<br/>
However, three years later Mosfilm (the Soviet national film <br/>
production bureau) commissioned Kurosawa to make Dersu Uzala, which <br/>
went on to win the 1976 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless, Kurosawa still lacked the funding for he needed to make <br/>
Kagemusha due to the failure of Dodes'ka-Den.<br/>
<br/>
To relieve the frustration of this situation, Kurosawa began <br/>
painting furiously again. As a young man, Kurosawa had originally <br/>
been a painter within the Japan Proletariat Artists Group.<br/>
<br/>
Contemporary German Expressionism, Soviet Realism and French Avant-<br/>
Garde influenced his work as a painter. His paintings and <br/>
storyboards (some of which are featured in the 48-page booklet <br/>
packaged with Kagemusha) have characteristic calligraphic lines and <br/>
bold primary colors. Kurosawa cites political pressure against <br/>
artists and liberal writers, needing to find a dependable livelihood <br/>
and the suicide of his brother as the three factors that made him <br/>
switch from painting to film.<br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa learned film under Yamamoto Kajiro, a relationship he <br/>
describes more like that of an elder and younger brother rather than <br/>
an apprenticeship. <br/>
<br/>
It was based on these brilliant storyboards for Kagemusha that <br/>
Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas (huge admirers of Kurosawa's <br/>
work) approached Kurosawa about helping him fund the project. <br/>
<br/>
Essentially the funding for Kagemusha was garnered from the success <br/>
of Lucas' first Star Wars film, as well as Coppola's first two <br/>
Godfather installments and Apocalypse Now. <br/>
<br/>
Production for Kagemusha began in 1979 and was plagued by an <br/>
argument Kurosawa had with lead actor Katsu Shintaro who demanded <br/>
that his own personal camera crew be allowed on the set to keep a <br/>
video record of his work. Nakadai Tatsuya replaced Shintaro and <br/>
Kagemusha was ready to be transformed from static paintings into <br/>
living, breathing film.<br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa describes Kagemusha as a medieval samurai drama loosely <br/>
based on ideas in Shakespeare's King Lear. Kurosawa had already <br/>
successfully translated Macbeth in his Throne of Blood film and <br/>
Hamlet in The Bad Sleep Well. He would later more fully adapt King <br/>
Lear in his 1985 film Ran. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa made Kagemusha about the historical character of Shingen <br/>
Takeda that would have to display different faces in different <br/>
situations. <br/>
<br/>
Historically, Shingen was known to use many kagemusha, or doubles, <br/>
so that he could avoid surprise attacks. In the film, Shingen uses <br/>
his brother Nobukado as a double, as well as a ruffian from the <br/>
streets who looks uncannily like him. (Skip to next paragraph to <br/>
avoid SPOILERS). <br/>
<br/>
After Shingen dies, his brother refuses to continue impersonating <br/>
him. Having been so affected by Shingen as a person, the thief <br/>
agrees to continue impersonating him in order to keep the Takeda <br/>
clan alive. <br/>
<br/>
However, the family of Shingen begins to notice that the thief is <br/>
not truly their warlord and expel him from the clan. Later in time, <br/>
the thief is forced to watch the Takeda clan fall to Nobunaga and <br/>
his Tokugawa clan as they ignore the advice of Shingen and <br/>
strategist Sun Zi: "Swift as the wind, as silent as the forest, as <br/>
sweeping as fire, as immovable as the mountain." Kurosawa sees this <br/>
as historically fascinating because Japan would have been a much <br/>
different place had Shingen and the Takeda clan gained control of <br/>
Kyoto. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa's writing process always involved two or three partners, <br/>
but he "always left the translation of prose scenes into images to <br/>
himself." Since Kurosawa began losing his eyesight around this time, <br/>
his use of illustrated storyboards greatly aided him in <br/>
communicating how he wanted Kagemusha to look. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps his most visually stunning film, Kagemusha uses brilliantly <br/>
colored fabrics of blood reds and fiery yellows. In a dream <br/>
sequence, Kurosawa's use of black lights, Day-Glo paints, surreal <br/>
terrain, otherworldly backdrops and eerie reflections makes for one <br/>
of the most visually stunning scenes in film history.<br/>
<br/>
In a Tony Rayns interview with Kurosawa, the director shares how he <br/>
feels about young directors in the Japanese film industry. <br/>
<br/>
He explains that although these young "indie" directors are limited <br/>
by budget, they try to make their films abrasive to attract an <br/>
audience. <br/>
<br/>
However, Kurosawa believes that a director should always make a film <br/>
to attract as large an audience as possible, while sacrificing none <br/>
of his or her artistic vision. <br/>
<br/>
It is in this way that Kagemusha succeeds so well. It is an <br/>
accessible film with an engaging story based on true history and <br/>
beautiful cinematography to boot. Kagemusha went on to win the Palm <br/>
D'Or at Cannes in 1980.<br/>
<br/>
Disc one of the Criterion Collection re-release of Kagemusha <br/>
includes a new, restored high-definition digital transfer, audio <br/>
commentary, theatrical trailers and improved English subtitle <br/>
translation. <br/>
<br/>
Disc two is a fascinating collection of documentaries including a <br/>
discussion between Lucas, Coppola and Kurosawa, a making of <br/>
Kagemusha, a storyboard to film comparison, a collection of Suntory <br/>
Whiskey commercials and a gallery of storyboards painted by <br/>
Kurosawa. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134034810">I recently watched Kagemusha.I enjoyed it very much<br/>
and would certainly describe it as "visually<br/>
splendorous". Actually I have recently become<br/>
interested in Nobukado and know nothing other that he<br/>
was the brother of Takeda Shingen and one of his<br/>
twenty four generals. Could anyone give me information<br/>
on him? Also what his Mon looked like? <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
