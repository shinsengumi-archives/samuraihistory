 <br/>
 For four centuries Japan has guarded the treasures belonging to its <br/>
greatest statesman and Shogun, Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br/>
Now, the Nikko Toshogu Shrine - featuring 80 objects including <br/>
screens, costumes, weapons, armour, art, scrolls, furniture - have <br/>
left their sacred shrines for the first time for a major exhibition. <br/>
<br/>
The 'Shogun: the life of Lord Tokugawa leyasu' exhibition at the <br/>
Royal Armouries, Leeds, is seen as one of the most important <br/>
displays of Japanese heritage and culture ever to be seen within the <br/>
UK.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu created modern Japan, ruling over a single <br/>
nation forged from hundreds of rival factions. He founded its <br/>
capital and its political culture, influencing literature and art. <br/>
He was made a god, and is as honoured today as he was at the height <br/>
of his power.<br/>
<br/>
A busy schedule of events and activities, in a partnership with the <br/>
Japanese World Heritage Site, supporting the display (which runs <br/>
until 30 August) will bring to life Japan, its art, culture and <br/>
traditions. There will be a dedicated outreach and education <br/>
programme, as well as activities such as Yabusame (Japanese archery <br/>
on horseback), Kobudo and Kendo (martial arts), Japanese tea <br/>
ceremonies, calligraphy, swordsmanship, origami and Tanka poetry <br/>
workshops.<br/>
