<h3>Period fabric</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144067450">To anyone with experience in period kimonos (specifically, Yoroi <br/>
Hitatare and Kosode):<br/>
<br/>
I've come across a website with Kosode patterns, and they mention <br/>
what kind of fabric to use. They suggested habotai and silk taffeta. <br/>
My question is, when I went to www.silkconnection.com, they had all <br/>
kinds of weights for these two. They also mentioned that Habotai was <br/>
good for scarves and lining, which sounded kind of odd to me since I <br/>
wouldn't classify armor clothing and scarves together. Can anyone <br/>
inform me if Habotai is in fact a good idea, and if so, what weight <br/>
I should try and buy it in? Mucho domo in advance.</div>

 </span></blockquote>If "habotai" is a corruption of the Japanese "habutae"&#12288;&#32701;&#20108;&#37325;, then <br/>
this could be right. Habutai is a kind of silk that is sometimes <br/>
used in kimono, especially formal clothing like "dai-mon".<br/>
<br/>
As you know, hitatare or kosode is just a type of kimono with a <br/>
particular shape. The hitatare wasn't armor itself. Could it make <br/>
sense that a heavier weight of a particular weave could be used for <br/>
clothing and a lighter one for scarves?<br/>
