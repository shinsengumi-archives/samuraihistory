<h3>Unsolved History episode on Ninja</h3>
by <i>msr_iaidoka</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-633775554">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
  I was wondering if anyone happened to watch the Unsolved History special <br/>
on the Ninja that was one last night.  The historian "expert" was Stephen <br/>
Turnbull and the "Ninja Master expert" was Stephen Hayes.  I would like to <br/>
know what everyone thought of it.  Personally, it hurt me inside.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tony,<br/>
<br/>
  On a totally unrelated note, I have always liked the term "Second American <br/>
Revolution"  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like you needed to use the remote, to change<br/>
the channel. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I heard of some kind of mind control technics that was imploded by <br/>
Ninja's.  Weather it is true or not I don't know. In all my years of <br/>
martial arts experience I have never seen or been trained in these <br/>
technics. I believe there are a few books out at the moment on the <br/>
topic. If I'm not mistaken this remote reading sound very similar to <br/>
the remote viewing technics used by physic's during the cold war. But <br/>
once again I don't even know if that was true or just fiction.</div>

 </span></blockquote>On friday night (I think) I saw a show that was<br/>
basically counting down the silliest blunders in<br/>
history, or at least that's what I got out of it.<br/>
Anyways, one of their countdown was about<br/>
Nobunaga--basically, the theory went that the reason<br/>
Mitsuhide turned against him and attacked was that<br/>
Nobunaga "propositioned" Mitsuhide's wife, and she hit<br/>
him on the head with a fan. So after that, Nobunaga<br/>
did his best to humiliate Mitsuhide, including hitting<br/>
him on the head with...a fan. Hmm...<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this same show had Ieyasu stopping at a<br/>
food stall prior to the battle of Mikata-ga-hara,<br/>
hearing the Takeda army coming while mid-dango, and<br/>
running off without paying--the old lady running the<br/>
stall apparently chased him down after a couple miles<br/>
and made him pay. Later on, after the battle, he gets<br/>
back to his castle, and his retainers unsaddle his<br/>
horse, finding "unchi" on the saddle--and Ieyasu<br/>
claims it's "yakimiso"...<br/>
<br/>
I'd heard part 2 of that one before--just not sure of<br/>
the physics of it, being as he was wearing armor and<br/>
all. <br/>

  The thing that hurt me most of all were the close quarters combat <br/>
techniques demonstrated by Hayes.  Though the comparison between a special <br/>
ops raid on a building to eliminate a target and a ninja "attack" on a <br/>
building to take out a target was rediculous.  I guess I should be thankful <br/>
that the ninja "attack" did not include Hayes in a black uniform.<br/>
  Though I do not know what to think about the Ninja Museum in Iga.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's an educational tourist attraction. I trust their<br/>
displays a little more than I trust Hayes, but<br/>
partially they are there to perpetuate interest in<br/>
ninja, so they're going to play up the "cool" aspects,<br/>
as much as they can and try to keep some kind of<br/>
semblence to reality. <br/>
<br/>
Did you have a pink ninja cutie guide you around too?<br/>

  I have never been there.  I saw the museum on the show and some of the <br/>
artifacts they had on display made me a little skeptical.  Something about a <br/>
pink ninja cutie kinda kills the credibility<br/>
  One of these days I will manage to make my way over to Japan and see the <br/>
sites.  Probably after I finish grad school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247808083">There was some interesting stuff on the recent ninja spoof Akakage <br/>
DVD. On the commentary done by the director, he remarks that almost <br/>
all of the legends connected with ninja are untrue and that they were <br/>
actually quite ordinary and unobtrusive looking. No news there, but <br/>
the best part is when he goes on to tell of wannabe Ninjas wanting to <br/>
be involved with his production (like the self proclaimed Ninja Sword <br/>
Master whose ultimate goal was to make himself capable of <br/>
disappearing-hopefully the director helped him with that-and a card <br/>
