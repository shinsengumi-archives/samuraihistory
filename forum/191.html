| The eHistory Bulletin is a peer-reviewed, refereed academic journal of<br/>
| history that targets undergraduates, secondary school students, and the<br/>
| general public as an audience. As more people turn to the internet for<br/>
| research purposes, The eHistory Bulletin seeks to provide a reliable<br/>
source<br/>
| of historical information through the dissemination of general articles,<br/>
| book reviews, and critical reviews of websites related to history.<br/>
| Manuscript Submission Guidelines Manuscripts: The eHistory Bulletin<br/>
welcomes<br/>
| submissions of general history articles relating to any area or time<br/>
period<br/>
| of history. Authors should keep in mind that the audience of The eHistory<br/>
| Bulletin consists of undergraduates and the general public. Authors should<br/>
| include their name and institutional affiliation. All manuscripts will be<br/>
| subjected to peer-review that will ensure the anonymity of both the author<br/>
| and the reviewers. Manuscripts submitted to The eHistory Bulletin should<br/>
not<br/>
| be submitted simultaneously or previously published in other publications.<br/>
| Submissions must be sent as an attachment in an e-mail to:<br/>

| version 7.0 or higher for the PC. Macintosh users and/or other formats<br/>
