We have many Kings named Gustav in our history.<br/>
<br/>
However, the Swedish history classs are very biased. I live in southern<br/>
parts of Sweden, called Skåne or Scania in latin. We used to belong to<br/>
Denmark a few undred years bak, then sweden waged war against denmark<br/>
and took scania. We vere swedish for a few years and then danish and<br/>
then swedish. Untill around 1640 i think, whne we became permanetely<br/>
swedish. I happen to live in a town called Kristianstad. an old military<br/>
city founded by King Kristian II (the second). In denmark and Scania, He<br/>
is refered to as "Kristian den gode" (Kristian the good) for the<br/>
liberation of skane from sweden. In sweden they call him "Kristian<br/>
Tyrann" (Kristian the oppressor/tyrant).<br/>
So I was taught that he was a mean evil man, in grammar school and in<br/>
intermediat school, but in junior high I got a teacher who studied<br/>
scania history in the university, and he told me the opposit version of<br/>
what I had ben taught before. Thats when i realised that the winners<br/>
write history. USA and Russia fought the Nazis and won ergo they fought<br/>
for freedom. It is really just a matter of ponit of view. Never trust<br/>
history to tellyou what really happend.<br/>
<br/>
I stand corrected again. I really ought to go mideval on my old history<br/>
teacher, he told us that sweden was the only coutry to beat the russians<br/>
and to take moscow. I should have known better...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is not to piss anyone off, just a mere observation okay.<br/>
Togukawa versus Mideval Sweden is kind of like <br/>
The Taliban faceing USA, Old khalashinkov against<br/>
"missiles-that-can-be-directed-up-your-ass"<br/>
lol...<br/>
<br/>
Now lets get back to the good old days of Togukawa and foxy ladys in<br/>
kimonos... <br/>

<h3>Seriously OT: The concept of Evil...</h3>
by <i>chris_danyael_x</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136528520">I beg to differ.<br/>
<br/>
They are not evil. Just plain stupid in my view.<br/>
I dont belive in pure/diluted evil. I think that is a figment of the<br/>
christian church imagination.<br/>
Hitler was insane, yes. He hurt/killed alot of people and suronded<br/>
himself with people of the same belief. <br/>
<br/>
Besides, there is no really good definition on what evil is.<br/>
Is one Evil for wanting to kill some one?<br/>
Is one Evil for wanting world domination?<br/>
Is one Evil for wanting to make money at any cost?<br/>
Is one Evil for wanting to hurt someone ?<br/>
<br/>
But what about the reason of these desires?<br/>
What is the cause of them? And what will be the effect of them?<br/>
<br/>
During the mideval ages, Evil was everyone who opposed the church, since<br/>
they were in liason with the devil. If you said something that differd<br/>
from the church doctrin, say the earth is not the center of the univers,<br/>
or the earth is not flat. Then you were evil and in liason with the<br/>
devil. <br/>
If you were an unknown coutry with black/yellow/red/blue/green skin<br/>
colur, with unknown kultural standards and belief. You were evil<br/>
heretics until you accepted jesus christ savior bla bla..<br/>
Until then you made good slaves, and colonies. Teh concept of Evil was<br/>
used as a method of control.<br/>
<br/>
One could say that the British Empire was Evil, for using Opium to force<br/>
china into submission.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some People I know say that USA is evil for interfering with other<br/>
states internal buissness.<br/>
Like getting Noriega (he was a CIA operative, but defekted after he got<br/>
elected) elected president and then assainated. USA put Pinochet into<br/>
power, and as such made life a living hell for alot of people. <br/>
<br/>
There are always a cause and an effect. This to is important to<br/>
remember.<br/>
 <br/>
Take the now famous 9/11 incident. <br/>
The most elaborate, complex and best executed guerilla opperaiton ever<br/>
peformed by terrorists. Now why on earth would some one want to kill off<br/>
five to seven thousand people in a building? <br/>
Basically to make a point. The terrorists didnt care about the people in<br/>
the buildings, that only came as a bounus. It was what those buildings<br/>
represented that matterd. It was an awfull act, and persoanly I was in<br/>
chock for three days. I have relatives in the states so naturally I was<br/>
concernd. <br/>
<br/>
Was that an evil act? If you ask the americans, it was definatly the<br/>
ultimate and purest Evil. But it was nothing but a political statement<br/>
from a group of people who thinks that USA should butt out of their<br/>
internal buissness. <br/>
I mean come on! Do you really think that the midle east is a new<br/>
problem? Hell no!<br/>
It has been a hodgepodge of assorted violence and territorial aggression<br/>
for over 5000 years. And the only difference now from then is that they<br/>
have the capacity to wipe each other out totally.<br/>
They are pissed off at the americans/allied for getting involved in a<br/>
several thousand year old conflict, and were telling them, and any other<br/>
nation that might get the idea to get involved to "stay the fuck away"<br/>
(pardon my language). If you dont, we will make sure that you feel the<br/>
effects of your actions in our home, at your home. <br/>
<br/>
So the cause to ther 9/11 effect was all the acumulated actions the<br/>
USA/Allied had done in the past concentrated in one opretaion. <br/>
The effect after 9/11?<br/>
USA bombed two countries back to the darkages, and what to continue with<br/>
Iran.<br/>
Is USA Evil for doing so? Oh no would most people say, they are only<br/>
defending themself from evil.<br/>
Yeah, but you have to considerd what the other side will say about this.<br/>
<br/>
They say that they were defending themself from the ultimate purest form<br/>
of Evil. Gerorge W Bush Junior the apostel of satan. Sounds familliar?<br/>
<br/>
Now, we are all friendly peacefull people, arent we?<br/>
<br/>
I say everything is a matter of point of view. And in most cases,<br/>
economics and religion are the major contributers to so called "evil"<br/>
events. And in a few cases insanity with a little help from economics<br/>
and religon can end up in disatorus events. Like the world wars,<br/>
Togukawa regime and emperor Xiang of china. The guy who united al of<br/>
china and built the great wall of china. He did kill a lott of people,<br/>
was a cruel bastard, and probably slightly YoYo in the head. But he did<br/>
unite china, and gave it a very stable future. Evil or not? Point of<br/>
view. <br/>
(BTW, I have _no_ idea how to spell Xiang's name, I'm guessing this is<br/>
correct)<br/>
<br/>
The other question we must ask ourself is this.<br/>
Does the means justify the goal?<br/>
or does the goal justify the means?<br/>
Emperor Xiang probably thought that if he united the people of what was<br/>
to be "China", a period of peace and prosperity would come. And the<br/>
country would flourish in the fields of science and economics. But it<br/>
would all come at a high price. He aparently thought it was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
My point in all of this rambling is this.<br/>
1. Evil is a matter of point of view. <br/>
2. History is written by those who survive and comes out on top of<br/>
things.<br/>
3. Does the goal justefy the means, and does the means justify the goal.<br/>
4. Evil is a word used to describe "the others" in a way to de humanise<br/>
the opposit side.<br/>
<br/>
And as such I do not belive in evil, deluted or pure, it does not matter<br/>
for it is all a point o view.<br/>
For it is all just the effect of a prior event. <br/>

Political statement ? If this is the way to be politicians, lets go to<br/>
nuclear disarm using the surplus for wipe out all the muslim countries<br/>
concerned. Is this you means as ''political statement'' ?<br/>
It was a massacre of innocent people. And blood call blood.<br/>
If terrorists do not stop themselves, nor Israeli neither USA have to<br/>
stop bombing. The problem is to properly choose the target avoiding the<br/>
same atrocities. When muslim will stop to consider medieval doctrine as<br/>
a must for the today's world, we will stop to consider B2B and Merkava<br/>
as a solution. <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Seriously OT: The concept of Evil...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-194304724">And I beg to differ,<br/>
<br/>
There is evil in the world.  I would imagine if someone says there is no evil is either had nothing horrible ever happen to them, has no conscience (basically mentally insane), or is just trying to get a rise out of people.  Yes what is evil to one person may not be evil to another, but that is irrelevant.  Evil is based on moral truth, which doesn't change.  Human opinions can ebb and flow, but moral truth will not.  <br/>
<br/>
Its really easy to say there is no evil, its all how you look at it, its just a matter of opinion, blah blah.  The reality of it is that if there was no concept of good or evil, that everything is morally neutral, then I could break your nose because your hairstyle was upsetting to me and get away with it.  <br/>
<br/>
And to close yes I do believe in God, and luckily we live in a country where so did our founding fathers.  And I am sure that all those moral relativist are grateful too, because if not then all principle would be reduced to personal preference i.e. I am going to break your nose because your hairstyle upsets me.<br/>

<h3>Still Seriously OT: The concept of Evil...</h3>
by <i>chris_danyael_x</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048643731">Yes they did kill a lot of innocent people, and that is a sad thing.<br/>
Every death of a human beeing is a sad event.<br/>
<br/>
However the target was not the people, but rather the symbols that the<br/>
WTC was, and what the Pentagon is symbolising. The same as the atempt to<br/>
chrash into 1600 Pensylvania Avenue. And that my friend is a political<br/>
statment. Politics and Religion are the same thing when used to control<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
WTC was and still is a symbol of the capitalist world of trade and the<br/>
USA is the foremost country in the capitalist world. Pentagon is the<br/>
symbol of your (I asume you are american) military power. 1600<br/>
Pensylvania is the symbol of US policys, leedership and the very heart<br/>
of the USA. <br/>
<br/>
The exact things that the Al-Quaida opposes on RELIGOUS grounds.<br/>
Religion is what they use as a means to justify their actions agains the<br/>
USA. They see the USA as a threat to their way of life.<br/>
<br/>
Does that sound familiare? The USA say that the Al-Quaida and other<br/>
terrorist organisations is a threat to the "American Dream".  <br/>
<br/>
Is this not politics?<br/>
<br/>
And why is it politics? The USA have interfered with the internal<br/>
affaires of Mideast, when not invited. This is a series of cause and<br/>
effects dating back to neolithic age. If you fail to realise this and<br/>
don't study history you are doomed to repeat it. <br/>
<br/>
And you say muslime, it is not all muslime who wants to blow the western<br/>
devils to bits, but rather a small group of radical religous people.<br/>
Many muslim countries does not want to atack the USA. Egypt, Saudi<br/>
Arabia, Quatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, India (has some<br/>
muslims, but the majority is Hindu) only to mention some.  Granted, they<br/>
may not see eye to eye with USA, but thats only natural. <br/>
<br/>
Hell half of Europa doesnt see eye to eye, but we have a Union together<br/>
and have taken a revolutinary step to change the Currency of every EU<br/>
country. <br/>
<br/>
If one continues to follow the "eye for an eye" doctrin, wich by the way<br/>
is even older than the Koran, the world will come to an end sooner than<br/>
any of us really want.<br/>
<br/>
But thats besides the point. <br/>
<br/>
We are discussing Evil, and its nature. The Taliban and Al-Quaida are<br/>
not evil, they just follow an outdated religous law, that hasent been<br/>
revised since the days of muslim Spain. Understanding and respecting<br/>
each others differences is what will unite this planet, and it is our<br/>
diversity and conflicts (not necesarily armed militay conflicts) that<br/>
has made us as a human species so prominent. <br/>
<br/>
You see, things are always more complex in their nature than to say it<br/>
is evil. You must see the cause to understand the effect. Evil in it's<br/>
classical definition is very simplistic. Evil seeks the destruction of<br/>
man and her world.  But it does not give us an explaination as to why<br/>
the Evil seeks the destruction of the world of men.<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, there was this guy who suggested how nice it woulf be<br/>
if everybody just stoped fighting each other and started to be nice.<br/>
They _naild_ him to the nearest tree and fought for the next 2000 years<br/>
about how he said it. <br/>
<br/>
And you have caught me at a bit of a disadvantage, since I havent heard<br/>
of B2B and Merkava. Can you explain and if possible give me an internet<br/>
reference?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885616270">First of all terrorist are evil, a terrorist is someone who uses terror, threat of terror, to influence a people or peoples.  So any organization that does that, whether its al quaida or the united nations, is evil.  That also goes for individuals.  <br/>
<br/>
The terrorist my friend where trying to kill people, sorry to let down.  There mission was to kill as many Americans as possible.  That is what terrorist do.  Use terror as a weapon.  <br/>
<br/>
Anything or anyone that tries to control another person or people unjustly is wrong.  Religion, political group, whatever, its wrong.  What you seem to forget here is that the terrorist attacked the US.  <br/>
<br/>
And yes radical Islam is the problem most Muslims are not radical in nature.  But groups like al quaida that want to make all western Christendom Muslim are evil and wrong.  Again going to my point earlier that anybody that wants to control another unjustly is wrong<br/>
<br/>
And regarding Jesus Christ he was and still is for just war.<br/>

<h3>Seriously OT: The concept of Evil... (this is a long one...)</h3>
by <i>chris_danyael_x</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-949037389">Ah, now we are getting somewere.<br/>
<br/>
First off, I must say that I have experienced my fair share of horrible<br/>
events, and I have been treated very badly by some really sadistic<br/>
people. I do not say they are evil, I say they are either sick and needs<br/>
help, or misguided. I even go as far as to forgive them, but I never<br/>
forget what has happend in the past. I hope you understand if I do not<br/>
go into detail as it is some very unpleasant memories for me.<br/>
<br/>
Morals and Etics are standards of behaviour that define our relatuions<br/>
with each other. These standards are accepted as protocolls of<br/>
comunication and are based on the thought that we can all live together<br/>
if we have an unspoken law that govenrs our behaviour. I.E. I dislike<br/>
your hairdo, I punch you on the nose. BUT this leads to a new set of<br/>
events, it just so happens to be socialy unacceptable and<br/>
uncommunicative to hit people in the face if you dont like their hairdo,<br/>
I go to prisson. <br/>
Okay this is a very simplistic chain of events, but it makes your and my<br/>
point clear. I break the social protocoll of standardised behavioural<br/>
patterns established for the sake of us living together and for us to<br/>
comunicate, then I must face the consequenses. It is when these Morals<br/>
or standard protocolls are faceing each other that friction occures.<br/>
<br/>
Okay now to the nature of Evil part. You say that one must be devoid of<br/>
emotion (or mentally insane) or has never had something bad happen to<br/>
them. And that Evil is based on moral truth witchis absolute. But this<br/>
is where you falter, my friend. Moral truth is not absloute, different<br/>
cultures have different moral values.<br/>
<br/>
In a country guided by, say for the sake of exampel, the Sharia (Muslim<br/>
law provided by the koran and its comments). It is not moraly wrong to<br/>
slay a woman who has been in bed with a man outside of wedlock.<br/>
Au contrare, it is encouraged to slay her. It is not evil, it is<br/>
necessary for the clan/family to retain its honor.<br/>
In the western world it would be imoral to have a sexual relationship<br/>
outside wedlock, but the woman most sertainly would not be stoned to<br/>
death. She would be either thrown out of her family, or if it was the<br/>
old days, be the center of the village gosip and a subject of<br/>
harrasment. If you would rais your voice against the Ming dynasty, you<br/>
would be arrested for treason and probably killed, not moraly wrong<br/>
since he/she was a security threat. In Western world, the person would<br/>
be called an inconveinence and not untill actions against the government<br/>
had been taken, would imprisonment and possible death sentence be<br/>
deliverd.<br/>
<br/>
Different culture equals different moral codes. And as such there is no<br/>
absolut moral code.<br/>
And even the moral codes can be bent and deformed, the world wars are<br/>
excelent examples of that. The inquisition is an excelent example of<br/>
that to. By saying that the person that is the target of torture is not<br/>
a humanbeeing, but rather an animal or a demon, and that you are doing<br/>
this for your own survival, is in essence a defomation of moral code.<br/>
Christians say "Thou shalt not Kill" even so they have committed alot of<br/>
hideous crimes. The Germans during the second world war killed<br/>
homosexuals, communists, Jews, and political dissidents with the excuse<br/>
"they are not Arian". And this allowed them to act under the belief that<br/>
this is not a moral crime. <br/>
<br/>
Do you consider Cows to have a social valu? Yes, you consider them food,<br/>
and as such you kill them and eat them as food. Why? It is conciderd<br/>
moraly to be our perogative since we are on top of the food chain. Even<br/>
so, the cow does not have a sens of awareness and it doesnt play chess.<br/>
What do we know, have we ever spoken to a cow? Does it consider us Evil<br/>
for slaying it and eating it? No it is an animal, it doesn't feel a<br/>
thing...<br/>
<br/>
Same reasoning of morals different target of cruelty.<br/>
<br/>
So people outside these defined moralcodes are called Evil to make it<br/>
easier to kill, maim, torture and in other ways seriously hurt their<br/>
feelings. <br/>
I do not doubt that someone is capable in commiting acts of cruelty.<br/>
They can be a saidist. Someone who likes to hurt people. That doesnt<br/>
mean they are Evil. They could have a reason for hurting me, beeing<br/>
afraid or feeling cornerd. Political or religious pressure can also be<br/>
an incentive to hurt me. Forcing a difernet view on me, and I sease to<br/>
be a human, and become an "it", making it easier for the agressor to<br/>
hurt me.<br/>
<br/>
And if one does not have feelings, one can not commit acts of cruelty,<br/>
but acts of logic behaviour.<br/>
If there are no feelings, one have no concept of pain, suffering and<br/>
pleasure. If you have no notion of that, then you can not take pleasure<br/>
in hurting someone. Your acts will be governd by logic. And logic by it<br/>
self is a sort of moral code.<br/>
<br/>
If you on the other hand are mentally disturbed, and take pleasure out<br/>
of someones pain, and have no problem of killing me, you or a child.<br/>
Then that persona has a different set of moralcodes that he/she abides<br/>
to. And If that persona acts out in accordance to this moral code, he<br/>
has not broken it. It does not nessecarily mean that he is "Evil" but<br/>
more of a social problem that has to be adressed and contained since<br/>
he/she acts not out of the established commonly accepted standards of<br/>
behaviour, and as such poses a problem. Thats not Evil, its mentally<br/>
ill. <br/>
<br/>
And if different sets of moral codes exist, then two different points of<br/>
view exsists. QED.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For intrinsic Evil to Exist, intrinsic Good has to exist. <br/>
None of them exist to my knowledge. <br/>
Show me one intrinsicly good beeing that I as an agnostic can accept<br/>
does not have any flaws in its reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
Then I will admitt my reasoning to be faulty.<br/>
<br/>
/// Chris <br/>
<br/>
On a personal note: I really like to discuss with you people, its fun<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526255217">Where does this social protocal come from.  My point is that social protocol from you might be different then what it is from me.  So how do disagreements get worked out.  If there is no moral bases for us both to live by, then we both can live however we chose, and not be responsible to anyone or anything because we live according to our own needs, wants, culture, up bringing, whatever.  Your logic is flawed, you state that there is a social protocol we must adhere too in one statement, and then you go on to state that each culture has its own standard by which to live by.  So I guess in your logic I (being a country) can invade you (being another country) for reason that are only believed or adhered too by my country and be in the right.  Or I being a thief can invade your house and still money and say that society did it to me, I need to steal to survive, and not get punished.  Thank God there is a an ultimate moral truth or there would be complete anarchy.<br/>
<br/>
How are the world wars an example of the moral codes being bent.  They where unjust acts that where wrong.  Simple as that, it doesnt take rocket science to figure out that killing millions of people is evil.  <br/>
<br/>
The commandment is Thou shall not murder.<br/>
<br/>
Its always easier to do evil then good, and people are by nature going to do wrong before they do good.  But then again according to your logic there is no good or evil because we all have different opinions.  <br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] Still Seriously OT: The concept of Evil...</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886213575">B2B is the latest type of U.S. stealth long-range bomber and the Merkava<br/>
is the standard israeli battle tank.<br/>
I still not consider politics the use of criminals for wiping out a<br/>
''symbol'' with thousand of people in. What if a white, Christian man<br/>
drop some kiloton about Mecca in the Ramadan crowded days ? The reason<br/>
might be the same : they are a danger for my existence. I think justify<br/>
such actions by the poorest people using the word ''politics'' is a<br/>
silly thing. They can be poor but are not stupid. Economic ransack of<br/>
third world must be fight with economic weapons. But the richest arabs<br/>
prefer pay for terrorism rather than perform an economic war that will<br/>
result In heavy money loss for both.<br/>
The problem is not religious, not politics, not racial : is economic.<br/>
But by BOTH sides. Give to Osama Bin Laden the throne of Saudi Arabia<br/>
and he will ask also for Iran, and then for Iraq, and then...   <br/>
If you assume terrorism as the continuation of the politics with other<br/>
means, we can assume that also war can. And so humankind really have no<br/>
chance... Blood asks for blood. And white people is not known throughout<br/>
the history as a merciful one. Why beat it in such a manner giving so<br/>
exceptional excuses to use weapons ?    <br/>

Oggetto: [samuraihistory] Still Seriously OT: The concept of Evil...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes they did kill a lot of innocent people, and that is a sad thing.<br/>
Every death of a human beeing is a sad event.<br/>
<br/>
However the target was not the people, but rather the symbols that the<br/>
WTC was, and what the Pentagon is symbolising. The same as the atempt to<br/>
chrash into 1600 Pensylvania Avenue. And that my friend is a political<br/>
statment. Politics and Religion are the same thing when used to control<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
WTC was and still is a symbol of the capitalist world of trade and the<br/>
USA is the foremost country in the capitalist world. Pentagon is the<br/>
symbol of your (I asume you are american) military power. 1600<br/>
Pensylvania is the symbol of US policys, leedership and the very heart<br/>
of the USA. <br/>
<br/>
The exact things that the Al-Quaida opposes on RELIGOUS grounds.<br/>
Religion is what they use as a means to justify their actions agains the<br/>
USA. They see the USA as a threat to their way of life.<br/>
<br/>
Does that sound familiare? The USA say that the Al-Quaida and other<br/>
terrorist organisations is a threat to the "American Dream".  <br/>
<br/>
Is this not politics?<br/>
<br/>
And why is it politics? The USA have interfered with the internal<br/>
affaires of Mideast, when not invited. This is a series of cause and<br/>
effects dating back to neolithic age. If you fail to realise this and<br/>
don't study history you are doomed to repeat it. <br/>
<br/>
And you say muslime, it is not all muslime who wants to blow the western<br/>
devils to bits, but rather a small group of radical religous people.<br/>
Many muslim countries does not want to atack the USA. Egypt, Saudi<br/>
Arabia, Quatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, India (has some<br/>
muslims, but the majority is Hindu) only to mention some.  Granted, they<br/>
may not see eye to eye with USA, but thats only natural. <br/>
<br/>
Hell half of Europa doesnt see eye to eye, but we have a Union together<br/>
and have taken a revolutinary step to change the Currency of every EU<br/>
country. <br/>
<br/>
If one continues to follow the "eye for an eye" doctrin, wich by the way<br/>
is even older than the Koran, the world will come to an end sooner than<br/>
any of us really want.<br/>
<br/>
But thats besides the point. <br/>
<br/>
We are discussing Evil, and its nature. The Taliban and Al-Quaida are<br/>
not evil, they just follow an outdated religous law, that hasent been<br/>
revised since the days of muslim Spain. Understanding and respecting<br/>
each others differences is what will unite this planet, and it is our<br/>
diversity and conflicts (not necesarily armed militay conflicts) that<br/>
has made us as a human species so prominent. <br/>
<br/>
You see, things are always more complex in their nature than to say it<br/>
is evil. You must see the cause to understand the effect. Evil in it's<br/>
classical definition is very simplistic. Evil seeks the destruction of<br/>
man and her world.  But it does not give us an explaination as to why<br/>
the Evil seeks the destruction of the world of men.<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, there was this guy who suggested how nice it woulf be<br/>
if everybody just stoped fighting each other and started to be nice.<br/>
They _naild_ him to the nearest tree and fought for the next 2000 years<br/>
about how he said it. <br/>
<br/>
And you have caught me at a bit of a disadvantage, since I havent heard<br/>
of B2B and Merkava. Can you explain and if possible give me an internet<br/>
reference?<br/>
