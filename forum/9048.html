<h3>Ouchi Sadatsuna</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424581339">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Ouchi Sadatsuna was a vassal of Date Masamune, but he deserted him in <br/>
1584.  Masamune led a punitive campaign against him and captured his <br/>
castle, while Ouchi fled to the Hatakeyama.  He then fought against the <br/>
Date at Hitotoribashi.<br/>
<br/>
However, in 1589 he is seen again, but this time fighting for the Date <br/>
at Suriagehara.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know when and why Masamune accepted Ouchi back into his <br/>
service?<br/>
