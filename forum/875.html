<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540504683">Hello everyone, I am new to this site, and I hope that you can help <br/>
me with my research, I am a miniaturist working on a samurai project, <br/>

trying to locate a photo, drawing, painting.....etc........of a disc <br/>
that was found on Kato's helmet. The helmet is tall with a slight <br/>
bend towards the top, with a sun disc on either side, in front of the <br/>
helmet, is a round disc with writing on it. does anyone know what <br/>
this dsic represents and what the writing on the disc means,? Does <br/>

or on the web? your help would really be appreciated, any help at <br/>

And some other versions are shown in the books I have.<br/>
I think no letter was written on the sun discs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002637464">Hi,<br/>
The kabuto that you are refering to is based on a court cap that has not been folded down.  You can still see this style of hat in certain ceremonies in Japan.  You can find pictures of this helmet in:<br/>
Samurai the warrior Tradition, by Stehpen Turnbull on Page 104<br/>
Also you can see this helmet in :<br/>
On the cover and in the book: Samurai Armies 1550-1615, by stephen Turnbull.<br/>
Hope this is helpful.<br/>

    The The Nagai Eboshi Kabuto in the collection of the Tokugawa Museum is<br/>
considered THE helmet of Kato Kiyomasa. It is papier-mache' 2 shaku 5 sun<br/>
(75cm.) in height covered in gold foil, with two red discs on each side.<br/>
There is no maedate (forecrest) and no writing. There is another Kato helmet<br/>
without the bend, it is black with gold circles, no maedate and no writing.<br/>
There is a third which is Oshikamasu Nari, shaped like a rice bag made from<br/>
old woven mat, it too was covered in gold, no maedate and no writing.<br/>
    If there were any writing I would suggest "Namu Myoho Renge Kyo" as he<br/>
was a fervent follower of Nichiren.<br/>

I think the first repro was good I didn't much like the second...</div>
