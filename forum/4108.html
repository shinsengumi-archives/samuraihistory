 </span></blockquote>Sounds interesting! Some more details are probably what's needed <br/>
to help someone help you find out the history. What kind of helmet <br/>
is it (do you know the name? Can you describe it?) About how old <br/>
is it? What exactly is the family crest that is on the armor (do you <br/>
know the name? Can you describe it?)<br/>
<br/>
There are several different Ando's with various different types of <br/>
kamon.<br/>

	Pretty tough to appraise antiques online but, people do it all the <br/>
time. Pictures of the inside of your helmet bowl, in addition to <br/>
overall pics of the set and its individual parts will be the best place <br/>
to start.<br/>
	Keep in mind that a single mon is hardly evidence of provenance. Most <br/>
great families had three mon, some more, some shared by many other <br/>
families. To say for sure you would need to see three mon in <br/>
combination that pointed to one family, then you have the problem of <br/>
attributing it to a certain generation, the main house or a branch. <br/>
Copies and revivalist pieces are also a problem. I say this often, so <br/>
forgive me if I am stating the obvious; tracing an item from a single <br/>
mon is near impossible, so much so that most don't even bother.<br/>
	Studying and appraising your own set of armour (regardless of mon) <br/>
seems to me a much more interesting and potentially fruitful exercise.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tom,<br/>
I've begun to get interested myself in the subject of kamon and <br/>
this is a fascinating point for me.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that people (and families) tended to have more than one <br/>
kamon, especially in those cases where kamon were given as presents <br/>
from some more prestigious family/person.<br/>
<br/>
But I've not yet run across the "three mon in combination" phenomenon. <br/>
Can you say a little more about this? What would be an example of a <br/>
family that had three kamon that were used in combination?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

	There is a recent book out on the "emblems" of major daimyo, if you <br/>
look thru it you will see that most are listed with one primary and two <br/>
minor mon. usually these represent the main house, the mothers house <br/>
and the fathers house. In the case of direct lineage within the main <br/>
house, one might represent the generation in question. Any one might  <br/>
be given to retainers as reward further confusing the issue.<br/>
	When one looks at sword furniture,armour and other items we often see <br/>
a single mon applied, depending on age and quality the assumption is <br/>
these are made for retainers and only with convincing provenance said <br/>
to be those of some lord. for example;<br/>
	A daughter of the house of Shimazu, is adopted into the Kuge (court <br/>
families) and then married to the Tokugawa Shogun. Thus as a wedding <br/>
gift to her Shimazu father we see a koshirae with Shimazu, Aoi and Kiku <br/>
mon all applied to the saya and fittings. Based on late-Edo history one <br/>
wouldn't expect to see these three in combination...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is the situation I'm more familiar with and referred to <br/>
earlier. It's the situation where one family (or one person) has <br/>
several different mon, including some that are given as gifts from <br/>
someone else. But these are not necessarily used in combinations of <br/>
three.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That must be an amazing piece of work. I guess this must be the story <br/>
of Atsuhime?<br/>
<br/>
In your experience would these three mon then be used by the family <br/>
(I guess Tokugawa) to represent the famil?. For instance would the <br/>
three mon be used on mon-tsuki or other personal items by the children <br/>
of the marriage?<br/>
<br/>
Or is it more likely that these three mon, used in combination, were <br/>
basically symbols of the marriage - the coming together of the <br/>
families. Therefore they were symbols used to represent a particular <br/>
event but they were not really used to represent the families per se.<br/>
<br/>
Does that distinction make sense?<br/>
