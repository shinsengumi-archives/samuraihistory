<div id="ygrps-yiv-578666780">Just wondering...<br/>
       Is there enough info on Oda to do a book on how to use some of his <br/>
methods (albeit modified to suit the situation) in the business world?  As I <br/>
said, just wondering.  That alt-history novel question I asked a couple months ago <br/>
was a much more serious question.  (I have it in my spiral-bound of story <br/>
ideas, and do plan to someday write it.)<br/>
