<h3>&quot;Anachronistic&quot; Samurai?</h3>
by <i>snicholas@pdep.pacdun.com</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-855566736">I read Helen McCullough's translation of the "Tale of the Heike" <br/>
(Genji War 1180-1185) and in the introductory notes, she claims the <br/>
title "samurai" is "anachronistic" for this period. Japanese <br/>
literature uses another word for these warriors; sabuto(sp?)<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone explain to me why "samurai" is out of date for the late <br/>
twelve century? Its got me puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ihope that I can be of some help to you with a little<br/>
info.  <br/>
<br/>
Originally the warriors of ancient Japan went by many<br/>
different names as they became a military elite<br/>
serving a more ancient and august leadership(the<br/>
emperor).  These elite warriors where called many<br/>
different things in many different records.  The terms<br/>
that we start to see arrising the most out of these<br/>
recors is "bushi" and "Kyuba no Michi".  These two<br/>
terms as far as I know are the main precursors to the<br/>
famed "Samurai" and "bushido".  While there are many<br/>
terms used to describe ancient warriors of Japan these<br/>
appear to be the most common.  Samrai does come from<br/>
the meaning "to serve" and sybolized this idea<br/>
throughout the history of Japan.<br/>

<br/>
The earliest terms for warriors, dating from the records of the seventh<br/>
century and later, were "tsuwamono" or "mononofu", or occasionally "mosa."<br/>
<br/>
Bushi and samurai are of later development.<br/>
<br/>
Kyuba no michi, BTW, does not refer to the person, but to the occupation; it<br/>
is "the WAY of the bow and horse."<br/>

Just as a question.  Is the word mononofu related to<br/>
the word mononobe that is used in the nihon shoki or<br/>
are they just similar by coincidence.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's usually written with the same kanji (damn those Japanese writers).<br/>
<br/>
The Mononobe, however, was the specific kabane used by the -- well, Mononobe<br/>
"clan" -- the military "clan."<br/>
