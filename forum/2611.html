Japan was the only country in East Asia who managed to save its butt <br/>
thru modernization. I believe the kick came from seeing what the <br/>
British were doing in China. As far as romantic fans of the samurai <br/>
would always be disappointed when looking at the pragmatic Meiji <br/>
restoration, the alternative would have been a massacre at the hands of <br/>
the Western powers. There was in fact NO WAY the Japanese could have <br/>
resisted the weapons the Europeans had developed, and the only city <br/>
that was actually attacked by the British (Kagoshima) was badly damaged <br/>
in a few hours of cannoning. Fear of invasions and blockades was <br/>
exactly was pushed the Tokugawa government to deal with the foreigners <br/>
first (treaties), and to modernize as quick as possible.<br/>
One last note: there is yet another East Asia country that managed to <br/>
stay indipenedent, actually in the long run even longer than Japan <br/>
(that was occupied in 1942-1952). It's Thailand (Siam). In fact, in the <br/>
19th c., after British and French had occupied Burma and Indochina, <br/>
rather than entering Siam, they preferred to use it as a buffer zone. <br/>
For this reason (=it was not an European colony) the Japanese did not <br/>
invade in the 1940s, but rather settled for an agreement. Thus, <br/>
Thailand independence is remarkable, but mainly due to rather casual <br/>
factors--Meiji Japan, instead, had pull itself out of the middle-age.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Different types of samurai swords.</h3>
by <i>Lee Changsub</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456880407">Alternative to  Cepo's answer, I think that there is a<br/>
distinction between an individual and a society.<br/>
Traditionally, the North East Asians put more emphasis<br/>
on producing higly competent individual both in spirit<br/>
and intellects rather than building a system that<br/>
would guarantee a majority of many who meet the<br/>
minimum standard in terms of physical and intellectual<br/>
ability.<br/>
<br/>
Sutzu, Takeda Shingen, Tokugawa, Kenshin, etc. all<br/>
mastered martial arts and statragy before the age of<br/>
15. In the modern terms, they all got black<br/>
belts(really qualified not just those who got due to<br/>
seniority nowdays) and Ph.D.'s before the age of at<br/>
least 20 year old.<br/>
In the west, Napoleon also mastered mathematics,<br/>
tactics, stragegy, and literatures before the age of<br/>
17, which resembles some of traditions of the North<br/>
East countries before the industrial revolution.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > i was wondering if any of it was real?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it is real, even now for some people. That is why<br/>
some Southerners in America have hard time accepting<br/>
some foreign students(Not White) superior to them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Why were they trying to  become so Modern???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This question must be thrown to the government. After<br/>
the success of the British industrial revolution in<br/>
1820, everything had changed. A few highly qualified<br/>
individuals can no longer face with many above average<br/>
multitudes. They had to set up the public school<br/>
system, which degraded the physical and intellectual<br/>
standards but still give opportunity to more people.<br/>
<br/>
One last point to Cepo:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > yet another East Asia  country that managed to stay<br/>
 </span></blockquote>indipenedent, actually in the long run even longer<br/>
than Japan (that was occupied in 1942-1952). It's<br/>
Thailand (Siam).<br/>
<br/>
The indepence of Siam was indeed remarkable. But, in<br/>
many ways, the North East Asians are strictly<br/>
different from the South East Asians culturally. This<br/>
difference has been diluted becuase of many Chinese<br/>
immigrants to the South during 17-18 centuries. But,<br/>
the tradition survives. <br/>
Note that the only countries in Asia which made<br/>
success in modern economy are North East Asian<br/>
countries like Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, and<br/>
a few other southern countries but whose economy is<br/>
dominated by Chinese descendents.<br/>
That is why people from Taiwan would get offended very<br/>
much if they are confused with Thais in the actuall<br/>
life circumstance or in TV shows.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                            Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                            Changsub Lee<br/>

<br/>
 question is if such remara<br/>

	Bushido as others have pointed out was never a universally recognized <br/>
set of rules in Japan. So there is really no answer to your question. <br/>
If your question is why did the Samurai government of the Tokugawa <br/>
fail, then the answers are there but not easy to elucidate.<br/>
	Bushi households had their income tied to rice production on lands <br/>
alotted to them by the bakufu. Once peace was established these incomes <br/>
were set and most positions within the government became hereditary. <br/>
Essentially freezing political and economic conditions at their 1620's <br/>
level.<br/>
	With each generation the population grew, but rice production did not, <br/>
so Bushi families had to make ends meet for larger and larger <br/>
households on a salary that did not increase at anywhere near the same <br/>
rate. Heavy taxation, flood and famine placed onerous burdens upon the <br/>
farmer who began to rebel more often. Bushi houses and the government <br/>
borrowed heavily, increasing the power and prestige of the merchant <br/>
class, while draining national coffers.<br/>
	The policy of isolationism, handicapped efforts to modernize the <br/>
military and political power of the Shoguns. The threat of European <br/>
intervention in Japan, laid plain all the weaknesses of the Tokugawa <br/>
system. There were only three choices left; War with the Great Powers <br/>
and colonization, rapid and dramatic reform of the existing government <br/>
or revolution. The second was undertaken too late, bringing about the <br/>
third which we know as the Meiji Restoration...<br/>
