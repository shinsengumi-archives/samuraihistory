<h3>Japanese Online dictionary/translator/study guide</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971671647">A friend of mine has put together an extensive online Japanese Language database ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jdictionary.com">http://www.jdictionary.com</a> )that includes a japanese text translator, a japanese english - english japanese dictionary as well as a complete list of 'level 2' kanji for the level 2 japanese language proficiency exam - you can also mark kanji to add to a 'study list'.  In the future he is considering allowing people to have 'login names' to save your personal study lists. As it is right now, I think you lose your list if you close your browser.  This is what is 'in the works' in addition to what is already there:<br/>
<br/>
Have a quiz mode for each list that drills you on the common jukugo and kunyomi. <br/>
Allow user to save their study lists to retrieve at a later date. <br/>
Allow user to create multiple study lists and sort them by name. <br/>
Create a version of this tool that is an all purpose kanji lookup tool that queries all Joyou kanji.<br/>
<br/>
This would be a very valuable resource for anyone studying Japanese.<br/>
(you need japanese fonts installed in your browser to fully utilize the site)<br/>
