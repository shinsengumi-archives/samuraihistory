<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260495940">I am a psuedo Fan of Rurouni Kenshin.  I like the show but I dont go <br/>
out of my way to make sure I watch it.  But I do remember Saito <br/>
Hajime being a character from the series, and someone on here was <br/>
writing about him.  Was he a real person that used to be a member of <br/>
the Shinsengumi?  And about another Shinsengumi member.  Okita Soji <br/>
who is a major character in the movie Gohatto.  I have a friend that <br/>
told me he is very popluar in Japan, and they even sell dolls of <br/>
him.  Also she told me that he died of consumption before the <br/>
revolution ever happened.  Can anyone confrim of correct these?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523506365">Yes, Saito Hajime is a real person and the info presented in Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin is quite accurate.<br/>
<br/>
And the info on Okita Souji is also correct.<br/>
