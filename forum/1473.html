 </span></blockquote>You do realize that for most of history that samurai were <br/>
warrior/soldiers that basically killed for their lords and later on were <br/>
used to oppress the commoners. If that's something you think is cool, <br/>
well hmmmmm. You may want to study up on Confucius/Zen/etc. Otherwise I <br/>
suspect you will find this list of little use since we are interested in <br/>
history and except for a few weekend play samurai I doubt that anybody <br/>
here has your goal of being a samurai.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500688387">The forgotten were the protectors of the samurai way? <br/>
<br/>
It could be argued that those who were forgotten were<br/>
those who had deserted or been forced to remove<br/>
themselves from service, and thus became forgotten<br/>
outside the world of the written word, or legend.<br/>
Without providing their service, the term 'samurai'<br/>
becomes little more than a personal anachronism.<br/>
Service to oneself is not the way of the samurai.  <br/>
