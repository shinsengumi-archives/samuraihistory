<h3>samurai history questions</h3>
by <i>worldbringer</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365644954">I have a couple questions about Japan history:<br/>
In the chronology on the samurai archives (<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/chronol.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/chronol.html</a> ) "The First Year of ___" is<br/>
mentioned many times. What does this mean?<br/>
A certain encyclopedia on japanese history said that Samurai emerged<br/>
around the 10th century and became the ruling class around the 12th<br/>
century. However, the chronology begins in 645. Does that begin before the<br/>
samurai, or is the encyclopedia incorrect?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nengo, or "era names" have been in use in Japan since the 7th century, when they <br/>
were introduced by the Court following the Chinese custom of era names. They <br/>
changed periodically due to some auspicious (or inauspicious) event. Since the <br/>
Meiji period in the 19th century, era names have coincided with the reigns of <br/>
emperors -- we are now in the Heisei era.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to know more about the Japanese calendar and era reckoning, see my <br/>
calendar page on the Online Japanese Miscellany at <br/>
