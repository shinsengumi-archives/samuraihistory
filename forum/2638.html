Interestingly I read somewhere recently that there is a new phenomena happening in the last few years.  Japanese women attendants in these bath houses are getting large extensive & traditional artistic tattoos and it is spreading, because their presence is having a positive economic impact on those baths.  Go Figure...<br/>

The sento (public bath) near my house closed at 22:00, I always got <br/>
there late on Tuesdays. Sign says "No bathers after 21:45" and "No <br/>
persons with tatoos". I always got to stay after ten on Tuesdays <br/>
because like clockwork at 22:15, a young man with half-sleeve tattoo <br/>
would come in and take his bath. Though we were the only two people in <br/>
the place we never spoke, never shared the same bath and I never asked <br/>
the proprietess about him. I KNEW he was Yakuza full stop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629828777">LOL....  the tattoos are generally called body suits, but most usually stop about mid thigh and just above the elbow.  They are done that way to conceal from the general public, but some will reveal the edges of their tattoos when it suits their purpose to let it be known that they are Yakuza.<br/>
 <br/>
It is commonly known that Yakuza will sometimes gather in just loin cloth, revealing their extensive tattoo work among themselves. Sort of a secret fraternity ritual if you will for lack of better description.<br/>
 <br/>
Tattooing in general has long been looked down upon in Japan because of it's criminal association, however today many Japanese young people are getting tattoos, but not in the traditional Japanese style of large artistic pieces, but interestingly getting small individual western style tattoos, they call this "won pointo"  transliteration for "one point" tattoo.<br/>
 <br/>
I do have a few pictures of Yakuza in full body tattoos if anyone would care to see, email me.<br/>

I wouldn't have wanted to see the proprietess of MY sento half-naked <br/>
and tatooed. BUT I would certainly take my custom to a shop that <br/>
featured a tatooed beauty and ignored tatts on the guests....<br/>
