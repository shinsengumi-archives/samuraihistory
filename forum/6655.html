Local man opens shop fit only for a true shogun<br/>

Paul MacLardy slowly opened the wooden doors to the dusty nineteenth-<br/>
century Japanese cabinet and removed his weapon, cautiously <br/>
unwrapping the sheet protecting the 36-inch samurai sword. With <br/>
pride and reverence, he gripped the sharkskin handle and held up the <br/>
weapon capable of beheading a man in a swift motion.<br/>
<br/>
MacLardy is the owner of Arise, an Asian antiques store that <br/>
recently moved to College Park. The store houses thousands of relics <br/>
from a culture MacLardy has grown to love.<br/>
<br/>
The cluttered warehouse  hidden by an innocent-looking, building  <br/>
has everything from $5 silk candleholders to $6,000 seventeenth-<br/>
century Buddha statues, from a $20 small, ribbetting wood frog to <br/>
the sword, which is worth $10,000.<br/>
<br/>
Arise, which MacLardy has run for more than 20 years, mainly sells <br/>
wholesale to museums, catalogues and antique shops, but also boasts <br/>
an impressive list of celebrity customers.<br/>
<br/>
Hilary Duff, after noticing Madonna wear a kimono to the Grammys, <br/>
fell in the love with the Material Girl's dress and ordered her <br/>
people to contact Arise, said MacLardy. Duff then purchased a <br/>
decorative blue-and-white kimono from Arise, which she donned for <br/>
the Nickelodeon's Kid's Choice Awards in 2002.<br/>
<br/>
Arise has also supplied furniture for sets of motion pictures and <br/>
local plays. The Harrison Ford movie Random Hearts exhibited a few <br/>
furniture pieces from his warehouse, and MacLardy provided most of <br/>
the kimonos for the Arena Stage's production of M. Butterfly.<br/>
<br/>
All the kimonos are designed by MacLardy and produced by his <br/>
business partner in India.<br/>
<br/>
He purchases the other rare and avant-garde merchandise through <br/>
connections in Japan, China and Indonesia, and has it shipped back <br/>
to his warehouse in 20- to 40-foot-long containers.<br/>
<br/>
"I like the fact that we provide a lot of jobs overseas. That's <br/>
important to us," said MacLardy, who has a background in public <br/>
interest work. "It's creative. We do a lot of different things, so <br/>
it doesn't get boring, and that's my personality. If I had wanted to <br/>
get rich, I would have just done one thing."<br/>
<br/>
MacLardy first dabbled in the Asian antique business as part of a <br/>
fund-raising kimono sale for a food co-op he owned. His interest in <br/>
Asian culture began with books and television shows.<br/>
<br/>
"I got into it from the James Clavell novel Shogun. I couldn't <br/>
believe seeing the samurai and stuff," said MacLardy. "When I was in <br/>
college I would go to the Metropolitan Museum and I would see the <br/>
Chinese and Japanese art and I kind of fell in love with it."<br/>
<br/>
Now not only does he speak fluent Japanese, but he also co-wrote a <br/>
book about kimonos three years ago that sold 9,000 copies nationwide.<br/>
<br/>
MacLardy plans to reopen his store, which was previously in Takoma <br/>
Park, by hosting a university-only pre-sale on Feb. 21, and sell <br/>
items at wholesale prices with a 50 percent discount.<br/>
