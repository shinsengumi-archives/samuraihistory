<h3>Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-758797222">I'm currently reading a Japanese novel about the life of Oda <br/>
Nobunaga.  Nobuhide kidnapped (or intercepted, if you like) Takechiyo <br/>
(Tokugawa Ieyasu) and demanded that Tokugawa Hirotada give up Okazaki <br/>
in return for his son's life.  Of course he refused, but Nobuhiro <br/>
decided not to kill Ieyasu anyway. In the book (which is of course <br/>
fiction) the implication is that Nobuhide was ready and willing to <br/>
kill Ieyasu, but Nobunaga was the one that stopped his father from <br/>
killing the boy - although it doesn't say it straight out, the story <br/>
implies that he was fond of the kid and was hoping his father would <br/>
adopt him into the Oda clan.<br/>
My question is, is there any basis in fact for this, or are <br/>
Nobunaga's actions in the book artistic license on the part of the <br/>
author?</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-948864168">Sadler's biography of Ieyasu suggests that Oda Nobuhide was so<br/>
impressed by Hirotada's reply to his ultimatum, effectively showing <br/>
willingness to sacrifice his own son to preserve the alliance with<br/>
the Imagawa, that he decided the boy should not be harmed.<br/>
<br/>
Nobunaga would have been 14 at the time, and I doubt his argument<br/>
would have swayed his father or the Oda retainers.<br/>
<br/>
Nobuhide's reasoning might have been more pragmatic. If Hirotada had <br/>
exchanged Okazaki for his son, he would have lost control of Mikawa <br/>
altogether (I would guess), so perhaps Hirotada thought he either <br/>
loses his son, or he loses everything.<br/>
<br/>
Nobuhide might have decided it was worth hanging on to the child to<br/>
use as a pawn in other bargains.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that fate later decreed that it was Ieyasu who would<br/>
sacrifice his firstborn son to preserve the alliance with Nobunaga.<br/>
<br/>
Karma, as they say?<br/>
<br/>
I'd be interested to know the novel, too - I assume it's in Japanese?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984832076">Yes I think its probably fiction too, but I read manga which depicted a<br/>
boyhood friendship between Ieyasu and Nobunaga during his years as a<br/>
hostage. Then in a TV movie about Ieyasu (with Kitaoji Kinya) had Ieyasu and<br/>
Nobunaga exchanging fond memories of their childhood together like two<br/>
drunken salarymen.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101831030">The book depicts that same sort of friendship - which struck me as <br/>
interesting, because you have to wonder how those two years or so <br/>
affected thier relationship later in life, if at all.  And since it <br/>
is a Japanese novel, you have to assume that the author has access to <br/>
all sorts of japanese research that doesn't appear in english, which <br/>
was why I was wondering if maybe the thing about Nobunaga might have <br/>
come from some sort of real source.<br/>
