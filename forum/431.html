<h3>The big question!!</h3>
by <i>Matthew Dean</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071677650">Hi to everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Here it is the big question!!<br/>
So then just to get you all thinking,<br/>
Who was the greatest Samurai or Daimyo of all time?<br/>
and if that's not enough to get you thinking, then<br/>
Who would you most like to of been given the chance, and why?<br/>
<br/>
This is just a few questions to get people thinking,<br/>
I was asked them and I really was puzzled and for a while I<br/>
thought I had the answer. But like everything, the more<br/>
you research the more harder it is to make your mind up....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328051176">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Although this is a very opinion based question and not<br/>
historically relevant.  I have always thought of<br/>
Kusonoki Masashige as a good example of the early<br/>
loyalty of the samurai before the Sengoku jidai.  As<br/>
for Daimyo I feel either Toyotomi Hideyoshi or Date<br/>
masamune would both be good choices.  Some have said,<br/>
had he been born earlier Date masamune would have<br/>
ruled Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Just opinion.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664517702">I too would go with Date Masamune,<br/>
    Raised in the saddle he became a gifted politician and founded a<br/>
Daimyate that ruled until the restoration. Sparred with Hideyoshi and<br/>
Ieyasu, fought in Korea, witnessed the events up to and after Sekigahara,<br/>
witnessed the battles of Osaka castle, Sent the first mission to Rome and<br/>
dreamed of sailing there himself one day...<br/>
    Could i be anyone not just a Sengoku Daimyo I would go for Thomas<br/>
Glover, the merchant of death, who sold arms to the Satsuma and Choshu<br/>
armies. Oh to be there as a close observer. Tobaku! Tobaku! Matta Tobaku!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027583797">Hello,<br/>
 Good question!...<br/>
 My 'best' Daimyo would undoubtedly be Takeda Shingen (Harunobu)..where can <br/>
you begin with the accomplishments of this man? Organisational <br/>
skills..Earning of respect in his lands ( And from other Daimyo and his <br/>
retainers)..Developing of machinery of government and development of <br/>
agriculture (dam construction and road building etc..) Damn! the list goes <br/>
on!<br/>
 Who would I have been if I could? Sasaki Shiro Takatsuna of the Uji river <br/>
race fame.. What a Samurai! On the method he used to acquire his horse for <br/>
the race alone he would have my respect but that on top of being such a <br/>
warrior rates him highly on my list..Failing that (although it has already <br/>
been taken!) Yagyu Munenori without a doubt. And after that Miyamoto Musashi, <br/>
and after that...See what these questions do to me!<br/>
 Abayo!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216489039">There was no daimyo, like a Takeda Harunobu :)<br/>
<br/>
And samurai was either Kusonoki Masashige because of his idealism and tactical wisdom or Nishina Daisuke of his legacy.<br/>
<br/>
And naturally you can't forget Musashi.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756461708">I have to agree with all you've said about Takeda Shingen, however I'd also<br/>
throw out Oda Nobunaga.  It may be passe, but the fact is, Nobunaga was not<br/>
only flexible in war and politics - far more than most of his<br/>
contemporaries, but he also knew what it took to unify the country, and went<br/>
about it fearlessly and ruthlessly.  Before his attack on Mt. Hiei, where<br/>
[allegedly] 20,000 men, women and children were slaughtered, he stated, that<br/>
he (and I'm paraphrasing) basically threw any semblance of a normal life or<br/>
the pursuit of worldly pleasure away for the good of Japan (in order to<br/>
unify it, and bring peace to it), and since not only had the monks of Mt.<br/>
hiei stymied his attempts at subjugating the asakura, but done so even after<br/>
many warnings, he was forced to slaugher them because they stand in the way<br/>
of the peace of Japan.<br/>
Unfortunately, Nobunaga was killed before we could know what his true<br/>
intentions were, so the validity of that statement can't be measured, but<br/>
the fact does stand that the young upstart from Owari province who due to a<br/>
freak occurence (destroying Imagawa Yoshimoto on a fluke) changed the course<br/>
of Japanese history.<br/>
If Yoshimoto had gone through Mino instead of Owari, and challenged or<br/>
allied with Saito, things would have been completely different, the Oda may<br/>
have been crushed in the mid 1560's by an emperor sanctioned army sent from<br/>
Kyoto by the Imagawa...  <br/>
One could argue that Nobunaga sacrificed a 'normal life' (whatever that<br/>
would amount to during the sengoku) for the good of Japan - although that<br/>
was probably not his true motivation, but again, he died probably about 6<br/>
years too soon to know what his true intentions were - would he have tried<br/>
to become Shogun, or taken another title, or ursurp the depose the emperor<br/>
and make himself emperor?  What if, what if...?<br/>
