<h3>Simple Sengoku Daimyo Question</h3>
by <i>konohawolfie</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-385073491">Just a simple question about daimyo.<br/>
<br/>
So each province/kuni had their own leading daimyo, or the kuni functioned as a family base...<br/>
<br/>
Like the Uesugi has Echigyo, Tokugawa has Mikawa, Rokkaku had Omi.<br/>
<br/>
Since the kuni are large and are split into districts, did the Samurai clans have a leader in each district to spread their influence? <br/>
<br/>
Like, Kenshin could live at his castle (not sure where) in one distict and the others can be ruled by his loyal retainers?<br/>
<br/>
Or did a province had just one single daimyo leader?</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-312871421">From 1336 up to about 1500/1520, each kuni had a leading daimyo : the shugo (see the list in Grossberg's Japan's Renaissance). <br/>
The shugo title appears almost up to 1570 but, in most cases, it is an empty one during the XVIth century and a kuni belongs either to one or to several Sengoku daimyo who do not possess the shugo title i.e Mino to Saitô and Izumo to Amako but Shinano, Mikawa, Harima or Aki to several warrior families. There are some exceptions : the Shimazu, shugo of Satsuma and Ôsumi, the Takeda, shugo of Kai or the Imagawa, shugo of Suruga<br/>
To take another example : Etchû and Noto are officially under two members (shugo) of the Hatakeyama family but, in fact, the first province is splitted between various vassals of the Hatakeyama among which the leading familiers are the Jimbô and the Shiina. Similarly, in Noto, the leading families, among others, are the Chô and the Yusa.<br/>
Hope I have been usefull<br/>

Looks simple..lemme make sure I have this correct.<br/>
<br/>
Province control can be split with a main family's affliated vassals (from what I gathered, the result wasn't good)? And they can have their own castles too?<br/>
<br/>
What about Takeda of Kai? He had the kuni all to himself?!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627047183">Good job Takeda.<br/>
<br/>
I looked up some of the families' names that you and Kitsuno has mentioned, and it looked like were a ton of vies from Murakami and Osawagawa. Suwa became vassals when they were defeated.<br/>
<br/>
Being a Lord (or ruler-Shugo) of large influence like Takeda must've been something nearly unheard of and only a few has done it.<br/>

Good Morning,I wanted to show this photo of this Japanese Bronze Temple<br/>
Bowl.It is etched with the Tokugawa Mon.It is very large 2ft tall and<br/>
wide.The base is also 2ft. tall.It was a gift from a friend frem the Ash<br/>
Housh in Devon England.She has passed away and the history as well.<br/>
I have been given an estimation that it is from around 1659-1750.<br/>
I am very intrested to know how this bowl was used.I have never seen<br/>
another like it and have been looking for the last 5years.<br/>
Thank's for your assistance Holly<br/>

Does anyone have any information on this guy: Hiraoka Yorikatsu Born 1560. I have some info on him from Japanese Wiki. I heard that Tony mentions him in one of his books on Sekigahara. I am traveling right now, if anyone could quote or paraphrase, or if you have additional info I would be very grateful. Please also let me know your sources. Thanks. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444314809">The Hiraoka were apparently a western clan. Samurai archives (dictionary) mentions Michiyori, based in Iyo province in the second half of XVIth century. Yorikatsu was an officer of Kobayakawa Hideaki at the battle of Sekigahara (Sadler, The life of Tokugawa Ieyasu). The Kobayakawa were based in the south of Aki province and were separated from Iyo province by the Inland sea but had a long and friendly relationship with clans of Iyo (notably Kawano/Kono and Murakami). I presume Michiyori and Yorikatsu were members of the same family or of branches of the Hiraoka, as well as Yoriyasu who, circa 1620 held a domain of 10.000 koku in Mino (Mass and Hauser, The Bakufu in Japanese history). As usual, the family had a special kanji : yori in this case.<br/>
