Keigen-Shinto period (1596 - 1623)<br/>
Keigen is a name of an era in Shinto time made by mixing the initial part of<br/>
the eras Keicho and Genna. Swords made during these eras, Keicho and Genna,<br/>
are called Keigen-Shinto. In this period a lot of Tachi made in the<br/>
Nanbokucho period were shortened to adjust the size at about 70cm in order<br/>
to wear them in the waist as requested by the new fighting style (and<br/>
fashion). Mihaba near the Kissaki and near Nakago is almost same size and<br/>
Kissaki is O-Kissaki. This shape became to be popular, but the difference<br/>
between Nanbokucho blades and Keigen-Shinto is Kasane. Kasane in now is<br/>
thick. These shape will appear again in the end of Edo Era The influence of<br/>
the European culture increased with the increasing of commercial exchanges.<br/>
Goods where excanged between Europe and Japan in this period and european<br/>
iron was imported, too. The japanese name for this iron is Nanban-Tetsu,<br/>
"steel of the Southern Barbarians". Smiths begun to proudly sign on the tang<br/>
of their creatures "made with NanbanTetsu" because european items were<br/>
really fashinating japanese people, but Kokan Nagayama quotes in his "Token<br/>
Kantei Dokuhon" that such a steel wasn't better then Tamahagane for making<br/>
NihonTo due to the impurities in it, especially phosporus. This foreign<br/>
steel is brigter then the japanese one and soon the fashion went out. </span></blockquote></div>
