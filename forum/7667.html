<h3>Murakami Pirates</h3>
by <i>hsiensei</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720352549">I've been doing some research on piracy in general, and found some <br/>
very interesting information on the wako, and on the Murakami in <br/>
specific.  The only problem is that any information seems to stop after <br/>
Kuki Yoshitaka's victory in the second battle of Kizugawaguchi and <br/>
Hideyoshi's release of his anti-piracy edict.  I need to know what <br/>
happened to the Murakami in the time between their defeat, and <br/>
Tokugawa's rise to power.  Did they cease to exist as a naval power <br/>
altogether?  Also, any information on naval battles in the Seto area <br/>
during that time, especially those involving the Murakami, Kuki, or <br/>
Mori, would be useful. <br/>
   I'm afraid I've exhausted all of my resources on this, any help <br/>
would be tremendously appreciated.</div>
