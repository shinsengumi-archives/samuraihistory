<h3>My 5c about Ninjas</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272161525">I have JUST finished my MA course load on Japanese History. I have <br/>
studied with some of the best professors in the US. They made me read <br/>
dozens of books about Japanese history (especially about the "medieval" <br/>
period) written by all the greatest japanologists of the 20th century - <br/>
including the whole Cambridge History of Japan. I have read thousands <br/>
and thousands of pages...<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don't remember ONE WORD about ninjas.<br/>
May be that they're not so important in Japanese HISTORY?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

PS = Anyway, I loved the Old Ninja in Samurai Fiction... the ones in <br/>
Last Samurai, instead,  were baaaad: they all got killed, some of them <br/>
by Tom Cruise - what a bunch of morons!!</div>

<h3>Question for Tony (or anyone else) regarding the poles for a jin-maku</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-792511823">Hi Tony,<br/>
<br/>
I need your advice. I'm in the process of building a 62 metre jin-maku<br/>
(a "camp curtain" for those not in the know). It's in six parts (4x13m<br/>
and 2x5m)and we've gone for the more authentic structure, that is each<br/>
curtain is made of five narrow horizontal strips of linen fabric with<br/>
matching loops for its 6mm hemp suspension rope. Top and bottom panels<br/>
are dark blue, the middle three are sky blue, as will be the loops.<br/>
Black painted kamon, to be applied later.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the question is in regard to the poles. On your site, you say that<br/>
the authentic material for these would be iron/steel rather than wood.<br/>
Fair enough, the pictures I've been looking at would support that, as<br/>
they are quite thin and have a hook about a shaku from the top finial,<br/>
which seems to be a sphere or the like in shape. How thick do you reckon<br/>
these poles are? Half inch maybe? They can't be too thick as this would<br/>
make them very heavy to transport. Any ideas? <br/>
<br/>
What concerns me is that at around seven and a half feet above the deck,<br/>
plus I guess one and a half to two and a half in the deck, there is some<br/>
risk of bending? I don't yet know if I can get such a long length of<br/>
metal hardened and tempered to resist this, but I'm still looking in to<br/>
it, assuming that it is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there is the issue of just how many we need to get made, I was<br/>
working on one pole every 5 metres or so.<br/>
<br/>
Any input, or other suggestions on their design etc. would also be much<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has a view, feel free to dive in, ninja not<br/>
withstanding:-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW Kitsuno-dono, the "Ultimate Power" link is a true killer LOL<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
