Try to get hold of a video - Kobayashi's KWAIDAN - a trilogy of ghost<br/>
stories by Lafcadio Hearn.  One of the stories is "Hoichi the Ear-less One".<br/>
It is about Taira ghosts of  the Dan no Ura battle in the late Heian period.<br/>
The battle is recreated with ships of the time.  Try also to see a<br/>
"Strategic Weapons" video (TV program) about the Samurai and the Mongol<br/>
invasions of the Kamakura period.  There are ships shown from a scroll of<br/>
the battle.<br/>

Howevr, I am sure that we have some info on the earlier vessels... Tell me<br/>
more about your project.<br/>
<br/>
I'm helping a group of people set up a web site for a highly detailed low<br/>
fantasy RPG called Harn not so loosely based on earth (its a fan site. and<br/>
not put out by the comp. that created Harn). Unfortunately only 3 of over 50<br/>
sections of the world have been published. We've chosen one called Shoju<br/>
(Japan) to develop.<br/>
<br/>
In doing some research I've determined that Harns time line correlates with<br/>
earth at about the 10th to 12th century AD( the Kamakura period) and Shoju<br/>
is known for its major naval presence in the area of this world. So I've<br/>
started to look about for any sources with very little luck until now.<br/>
<br/>
what I'm looking for are types of ships, technology that might be different<br/>
that Europe at the time, or descriptions of the ships/boats ie. average<br/>
length/beam/depth/height or base # of masts or what is the gross burthen of<br/>
said ship is etc.<br/>
<br/>
if some one has any pic's or art of ships of the time period to give me an<br/>
idea of what working with. (I'll discard after my viewing them)<br/>
<br/>
I have very little to work with so if you can help please contact me<br/>
directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dbisaillon@...">dbisaillon@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>

<h3>Kabukimono</h3>
by <i>Keijiro Maeda</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-839025816">Thanks to Shogun for answering me.<br/>
<br/>
I searched and I found things about Toshie Maeda, but nothing about <br/>
his elder brother Toshihisa; In Hara's manga, Keiji is adoptive son <br/>
of Toshihisa. Toshihisa was the previous family-boss before Toshie.<br/>
Keiji is a kabukimono, an eccentric ronin that impose himself <br/>
everywhere and with every kind of people, also with important Daimyo <br/>
or ... the Kampaku Toyotomi Ideyoshi!!!!<br/>
I would like to know about kabukimonos....<br/>
<br/>
Keiji's best friend is another real historical character: Kanetsugu <br/>
Naoe. He was first under Uesugi family, and after he got a terrain <br/>
just for him from Ideyoshi; there is an important letter wrote by <br/>
Naoe for Ieyasu Tokugawa before Sekigahara's battle...<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the manga, Keiji cut his hair and become a budist <br/>
priest and change his name in Hyottokosai Ichimuan (or Mukuan). <br/>
"He will live other 12 years with Kanetsugu in Yonezawa, then he <br/>
died.."<br/>
Is something of this real? Where I can find an answer?<br/>
<br/>
Toshie's wife (Matsu) was Keiji's lover...<br/>
Is she real? <br/>
<br/>
Is this history untrue???<br/>
I just wanna know this.<br/>
<br/>
