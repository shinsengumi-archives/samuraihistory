"shuriken", you've got all sorts of shapes and sizes<br/>
of throwing knives, including the disc and star shaped<br/>

I'm glad--I'd be afraid of being killed in the night.<br/>
My SECOM security system is no match for a ninja<br/>
master!<br/>
<br/>
Basically the shaken/shuriken thing is what I meant.<br/>
Having nothing to quote, I went from memory, and added<br/>
the caveat about "other names". Thanks for the<br/>
update--correct info is never bad! (Unless you are the<br/>
government). <br/>

Hi<br/>
<br/>
the book was writen by Charles Gruzanski. He is dead<br/>
now but his son Robert has all of his material amd set<br/>
up this site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.robertg.com/">http://www.robertg.com/</a><br/>

masaaki who left the ryu and later gained fame as a<br/>
ninja dude - Bujinkan Dojo.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the reminder - and the link.  I'll have to check it out and<br/>
see what I think of it thirty years later.  It's unclear from this, though,<br/>
whether you regard Gruzanski's information as legitimate or not; nor on what<br/>
basis you make your judgement.<br/>
<br/>
Dont worry about being a wanna be ninja - it got the<br/>
bets of us hooked at one time or another<br/>
<br/>
I'll assume you don't intend that to be insulting.  But I'm no wanna-be<br/>
anything, Paul, and your comment is not calculated to go over well with any<br/>
serious martial artist.  I earn my meager bread as a teacher of<br/>
international sword arts (as well as naginata, spear, assorted peasant<br/>
weapons from Europe and Asia, Chinese weapons, archery, empty-hand, and<br/>
knife and stick styles - I even teach crutch self-defense from time to<br/>
time), and I'm pretty serious about my accuracy.  I also come from a family<br/>
of academics, so bad research is a very sensitive subject for me.  I've been<br/>
teaching one style or another for about thirty years, pretty informally<br/>
until the last ten years or so; and I've been practising longer than I can<br/>
remember offhand.  I got hooked, as you put it, on Japanese combat arts at<br/>
an art house that screened Inagaki's "Chushingura" every year back in the<br/>
late '60s and early '70s.  Musashi's _Book of Five Rings_ had a hell of a<br/>
lot more influence on me than the ninja craze that hit a few years later.<br/>
(And of course, my mother had Hiroshige and Hokusai prints around the house<br/>
from the time I was born.)<br/>
A few years ago, someone asked another teacher in the area, "What does it<br/>
take to open a Ninjitsu school?"  The teacher thought about it a second and<br/>
said, "A black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a business license."  Which pretty<br/>
well sums up my attitude to 90-plus % of what is called Ninjitsu today.<br/>
I've talked with Steve Hayes, and one of my old students ran Frank Dux's<br/>
second school back in the '80s, before he got disillusioned with Dux's cult<br/>
of personality.  Neither of them impressed me much with the quality of his<br/>
background.  (Dux's fighting skill was remarkable, but it was mostly<br/>
military; and "Bloodsport" represented neither his style nor his<br/>
wish-fulfillment history with any accuracy.)  As far as the craze for<br/>
Ninjitsu goes, in fact, I have seen precisely one "Ninja" film - some Sho<br/>
Kosugi silliness that turned up on late-night TV a few years back - and my<br/>
comment to Nate was precisely in hopes that I would _not_ be lumped in with<br/>
this sordid batch of bad research and willful myth-information by the<br/>
serious minds on this list.<br/>
So if being a ninja wanna-be got "the best of us" hooked, then I guess I'm<br/>
not one of the best of you.  And if that really were the best of you, I<br/>
wouldn't be on this list.<br/>
<br/>
the spikes and the stars are all known as shuriken.<br/>
<br/>
That is certainly true:  at least outside of Japan:  but then a great many<br/>
things are "known" inaccurately.  (Witness the person who found a web-site<br/>
claiming the 47 Ronin killed the Shogun!)  So permit me to ask if you have<br/>
positive knowledge that the term 'shaken' is incorrectly applied to the<br/>
stars, etc., and likewise that 'shuriken' is correctly applied to them.  As<br/>
I say, I'm pretty serious about my accuracy, and I always desire to learn<br/>
more and to refine my knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the spikes are better know as Bo-shuriken<br/>
<br/>
Again, I'm interested in learning the sources for this information.  No<br/>
offense, but what I have is your word on one hand, and Gruzanski's<br/>
Masaki-Ryu information on the other (and I do thank you for providing me<br/>
with that footnote).  If what you say about Masaki-Ryu as the source for<br/>
_Spike and Chain_ is correct, then why should that not be regarded as<br/>
accurate?  Have you reason to believe that Masaki-Ryu is not a legitimate<br/>
style, and that its terminology is therefore to be dismissed?  And if so, on<br/>
what grounds do you make that claim?  Another style's terminology that you<br/>
prefer, perhaps, or a genuinely superior knowledge of standard Japanese<br/>
martial terminology?  I'm prepared to adopt new terms and thank you for it -<br/>
but I'll need some documentation beyond what you've said here.  You've said<br/>
what your "correct" terms are without saying why the terms I cited are<br/>
"incorrect".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Havent we discussed Shuriken etc in the recent past -<br/>
maybe worth looking at the archive onthe yahoo site.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we have.  I believe I mentioned the same thing about shaken vs.<br/>
shuriken then, but nobody responded to it that time.  Look forward to your<br/>
response now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484427756">HI<br/>
<br/>
I am no wannabe ninja I was when I was a teen age but<br/>
times move on, but it was those times that got me<br/>
interested in all forms of budo.<br/>
<br/>
to be brief and answer quickly your question about the<br/>
terms shuriken etc. The term shuriken is not exclusive<br/>
to say Masaki Ryu which is featured in the book<br/>
mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who studies Katori Shinto Ryu IN Japan<br/>
unde Otake sensei, I have a friend in the kUkishinde<br/>
Tenshin Hyoho and they call them shuriken, witht he 4<br/>
pointed star being refered to as a teppan. <br/>
<br/>
Negishi Ryu for one is also a Shuriken schoola nd<br/>
mainly throws bo-shuriken.<br/>
<br/>
Shuriken seems to be the main term used for all forms<br/>
of throwing blade with it again broken down further in<br/>
to sub groups such as Shaken - teppan - senban- bo<br/>
shuriken etc<br/>
<br/>
personally i dont rate Hayes, anyone who does not have<br/>
permisson of the rank to issue menkyo and does is to<br/>
be avoided in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
As a member of the bujinkan I have found 'serious<br/>
martial artists' quite different to me. initially<br/>
those in koryu who are familiar with hatsumi sensei<br/>
may take a step back at first then they usually accept<br/>
me as I dont partake in any of the ninja boom or ninja<br/>
madness. In fact I shy away from that. This old ninja<br/>
is doing quite well with invites to some of the more<br/>
famous ryu in japan than the average wannabe could<br/>
possibly imagine possible. <br/>
<br/>
I am wondering what makes a serious martial artist<br/>
from your comment. Belive me when I tell you I am more<br/>
serious about what I have studied and what i do study<br/>
more than the average martial artist in any dojo. I am<br/>
not one of those who turn up train and go away till<br/>
next lesson.<br/>

and thank you for it -<br/>
but I'll need some documentation beyond what you've<br/>
said here.  You've said<br/>
what your "correct" terms are without saying why the<br/>
terms I cited are<br/>
"incorrect".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Havent we discussed Shuriken etc in the recent past -<br/>
maybe worth looking at the archive onthe yahoo site.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we have.  I believe I mentioned the same thing<br/>
about shaken vs.<br/>
shuriken then, but nobody responded to it that time. <br/>
Look forward to your<br/>
response now.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] shuriken vs. shaken</h3>
by <i>ghostweasel2k</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466126072">hello,<br/>
  the disc shaped ones are shuriken,the shaken is a form of shuriken that was more of a conical shape w/1 sharp point on 1 side & about 3-4 sharp barbs on the other side.the manriki gusari didnt really have a spike.there were of course many different variations or the manriki gusari.the throwing spike is called a bo shuriken.they were darts that were thrown from close ranges at about 8-10 ft away.the star shaped shuriken were thrown more or less from any range.technically speaking,anything that was thrown at the enemy was called a shuriken.the caltrops are called tetsubishi.they were normally used to slow attackers while the bushi or the ninja was trying to escape.the only reason why i know this is because we train w/some of these & other traditional japanese weapons.im a member of the bujinkan in cleveland ohio.<br/>

According to the one book I've ever seen that discusses the matter in any<br/>
detail - _Spike and Chain_  (covering manriki-kusari, shuriken and shaken) -<br/>
"shuriken" refers only to the spike, dart and knife types of throwing<br/>
weapon - basically, those which are only bilaterally symmetrical.<br/>
The radially symmetrical ones - discs, stars, triangles, squares- are<br/>
properly termed "shaken".  The book was out in the early '70s, before the<br/>
cresting of the wave of ninja silliness, and it appeared to be fairly<br/>
solidly researched.  I shed my copy back in '75, so I can't cite the<br/>
author's name.<br/>
Nate, don't go thinking I'm one of your "resident ninja masters" on account<br/>
of this, okay?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Caltrops are spikes placed/strewn on the ground to<br/>
impede/distract a pursuer, etc. The general shape of<br/>
"tetsubishi" ("iron diamonds") is a 4 pointed object<br/>
with the points such that if you throw them down,<br/>
there is always one point up and 3 points as a base.<br/>
Think of jacks, from the kids game, except sharper.<br/>
<br/>
The small discs with the sharp edges you refer to are<br/>
shuriken. There's several names according to the<br/>
shape, etc., and I'm sure one of our resident ninja<br/>
masters will pipe up and tell us, but I'm not sure<br/>
what all they are. I know under the heading of<br/>
"shuriken", you've got all sorts of shapes and sizes<br/>
of throwing knives, including the disc and star shaped<br/>
types.<br/>
