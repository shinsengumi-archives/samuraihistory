<h3>Article: Samurai cult or social evil in suicides</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370707081">Samurai cult or social evil in suicides<br/>
<br/>
The 2003 movie "The Last Samurai" has left a deep impression of Japan <br/>
in the Western world. The namesake last samurai is not Nathan Algren, <br/>
played by Tom Cruise, but Katsumoto, played by the Japanese actor Ken <br/>
Watanabe. The last samurai is a perfect figure who makes the American <br/>
born again as a samurai. The climax of the movie is the samurai's <br/>
suicide. Killing himself with his own sword in the fluttering cherry <br/>
blossoms, Katsumoto's last word is "perfect." He was talking about <br/>
the beauty of the cherry blossom rain and the equally splendid ending <br/>
of a samurai's life.<br/>
<br/>
The theme of "Chushingura," a classic Japanese revenge story, is "the <br/>
best of flowers is the cherry blossom and the best of men is a <br/>
samurai." Chushingura is based on a historical event about the <br/>
revenge of 47 samurai 300 years ago. A lord was wrongfully accused <br/>
and forced to commit seppuku, a form of suicide in which the victim <br/>
disembowels himself. As revenge for their master, 47 retainers bided <br/>
their time and attacked the foe on a snowy winter night. They offered <br/>
the head of the foe at the grave of their master and committed <br/>
seppuku together. The story of Chushingura is an eternal bestseller <br/>
in Japan, having been revisited by numerous novels, plays, movies and <br/>
television series.<br/>
<br/>
The recent group suicide of nine Japanese shocked Westerners. Youths <br/>
met on the Internet and planned their deaths. Westerners argued that <br/>
the samurai tradition, death as honor, lived on because there was no <br/>
religion in Japan that respected the value of life.<br/>
<br/>
According to World Health Organization statistics, the suicide rate <br/>
per 100,000 is 24.1 in Japan, compared to 10.4 in the United States <br/>
and 7.5 in Great Britain. Last year, 24 Koreans per 100,000 killed <br/>
themselves. When five youngsters met on the Internet and committed a <br/>
group suicide in March, suicide Web site became a social concern. <br/>
Last year, the suicide rate in the age group 61 and above grew <br/>
rapidly, largely because of financial difficulties, and made up 28 <br/>
percent of the total suicides. In the last five years, there have <br/>
been 340 suicides in the military.<br/>
<br/>
The high suicide rate is exceptional; Korea has no tradition of <br/>
idealizing death and religions that value life prevail. We cannot <br/>
rule out the suspicion that the suicides were "social homicides," a <br/>
last, belated call for help.<br/>

<br/>
I found the article very interesting, and posed the question to one of the Japanese doctors at the hospital where I am a nurse.<br/>
<br/>
He told me that while the Samurai 'code' was based on honor,  and selflessness for one's liege, one must recall that it was also a <br/>
system deliberately set up by the Tokugawan Shoguns for purposes of control.  This information is also on the 'newcomers must read' <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
This honor was ultimately, oh, what's the word.... starts with a 'p', I think.....    distorted  anyway,  the concept of 'shame' <br/>
gradually became the over-riding concept.  Japan was also badly humiliated in WW2. Since that time, he said, the drive to achieve, <br/>
to excel, to be the best has become almost psychotic.. There is so much competition for places in schools, then in jobs, that a <br/>
single failing mark can spell a lifetime at a lower economic level.  There is so much stress, and emphasis on the shame of defeat, <br/>
that these children are taught that it is weak to admit any sort of frailty, of fear, of differing opinion.<br/>
<br/>
One can see traces of this pressure in our own society, and indeed, the world.  We are ever pushed, and push each other, to <br/>
accomplish more, earn more, drive faster, kill each other more efficiently...... the list just goes on and on and on.....<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I realized 'The Last Samurai' was not about Algren, that he was merely a story vehicle.  Many historians, aficionados, re-enactors <br/>
and others were outraged at the lack of authenticity.  But, the director and producer made no such claim to authenticity.<br/>
<br/>
'To know life in every breath' is not the mindset of a person who seeks death.  It is the mindset of a person who knows that death <br/>
may take him at any time, and sees the world with a clarity of mind heightened and appreciative of the Present.<br/>
<br/>
This phenomenal state of mind is experienced to some degree by every person who has had a life-threatening experience.  It is <br/>
experienced more acutely by those who experience combat,  police, fire, and rescue personnel,  indeed anyone who consciously chooses <br/>
this way of life has contemplated the potential consequences.  It is also why some people become adrenaline junkies, because it is a <br/>
very real high.....  an organic high, produced by ones own hormones.<br/>
<br/>
I might start a flame here, but it is my niggling thought once in awhile, that even our revered Miyamoto Musashi was perhaps not a <br/>
very stable person, formidable though he was, even without a weapon in hand. Even if he was rock solid psychologically, perhaps his <br/>
communication skills were wanting. Perhaps, as in many languages, errors in translations of his works and intent have occurred.<br/>
<br/>
I think, or at least I choose to think, he was trying to say that if we live in the Present, and choose our actions according to our <br/>
honor, that path may lead to death: so be it, if that is our destiny.  But, in pursuit of our path, we must also notice, appreciate, <br/>
and revere that which around us is Life.  It is so tentative, that to lose a moment of it is wasteful.   One cannot Live if one is <br/>
already Dead; one cannot know Death without having Lived.  I definitely don't think his was a shame-based way of life.<br/>
<br/>
The fictional Katsumoto died with his honor intact for he would not compromise his principles, nor allow the possibility of the <br/>
smarmy Omura to take him prisoner for further humiliation.<br/>
<br/>
This is, to me, a distinct difference from the seppuku of shame, of despair, or correct me if I use the wrong work, the sempuku of <br/>
revenge. Way different mindset.  The contrast is stark.<br/>
<br/>

In the UK, at least, 'Last Samurai' was a minor Tom Cruise vehicle which fits nicely <br/>
into the formulaic Tom Cruise ethos - but I really don't think it had anything like the <br/>
impact of 'Shogun' when that was shown on TV a millenia ago.<br/>
<br/>
From another viewpoint - Master and Commander - which is a fantastic film (and is <br/>
on my DV player as often as a Kurosawa) ran longer locally - but has done little to <br/>
alter the British mindset about the Napoleonic-era navy - something which is much <br/>
closer to their 'experience'.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry - just an opinion.<br/>

Tom Cruise made a movie about Japan, and Ken Watanabe<br/>
got nominated for an Oscar...yay, Japan is in the<br/>
news!" No one is going off to seek their samurai roots<br/>
in the hills of Satsuma because of it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I highly doubt the group suicide had anything to do<br/>
with a Western movie set in Japan. To suggest<br/>
otherwise is hogwash. <br/>
