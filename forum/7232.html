Chuushingura: The Treasury of Loyal Retainers aka The 47 Ronin<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Noh, I also went to see Bunraku, Japanese traditional <br/>
puppet theater. Osaka, known for many things혰takoyaki, bargaining, <br/>
jaywalkers, and snoopy people혰is also famous for its Bunraku. <br/>
<br/>
I was excited for a number of reasons. One of course was the bunraku <br/>
itself. I'd attended a small introductory seminar the day before by <br/>
a bunraku troupe showing how the puppets moved and so on. It's not <br/>
like marionettes in the least. There is the head puppeteer who <br/>
inserts his hand into the body of the puppet [which is about 4 feet <br/>
tall] and controls the facial movements of the wooden head and the <br/>
right arm. There are two underling puppeteers, one who controls the <br/>
other hand and hands props to the right hand the true underling who <br/>
controls only the feet. I think the troupe said it takes about 10 <br/>
years of apprenticeship working on just the feet before you can <br/>
graduate up to left hand. A puppeteer is trained in using only one <br/>
particular puppet and plays that role for his career혰such as the <br/>
middle age man, young girl, married woman, and so on. <br/>
<br/>
The head puppeteer is the only one who shows his face while the <br/>
underlings are dressed in black with black gauze covering their <br/>
faces to perpetuate the willing suspension of disbelief that in <br/>
fact, they don't even exist. As apprentices, their contribution to <br/>
the puppetering is considered anonymous, and only the master is <br/>
allowed credit. [On a random note, on Japanese TV game shows, you <br/>
can sometimes see a random prop guy going out to hand something to <br/>
the contestants, and if that is the case, he wears a black gauze hat <br/>
thing covering his face. I wonder if it's a modern outgrowth of the <br/>
bunraku thing.] The troupe demonstrated a puppet crying, arranging <br/>
her hair, and reading a letter, and all her gestures were so in <br/>
keeping with real human movements that it was really quite eerie. <br/>
<br/>
The bunraku play I went to see was called Chushingura or, as it's <br/>
translated in English, The 47 Ronin. It's based on a real incident <br/>
that occurred in Tokugawa Japan [1600's or so]. In the presence of <br/>
the shogun, it was forbidden to draw swords. A young nobleman was <br/>
being bullied by an older courtier and was so insulted he pulled out <br/>
his sword and attacked the elder. For violating the rule, the <br/>
younger nobleman was forced to commit seppuku [ritual suicide] while <br/>
the elder was unpunished. In order to prevent violence, according to <br/>
the laws of that time, whoever engaged in a fight, the attacker as <br/>
well as the attacked both would be forced to commit seppuku. That <br/>
the corrupt elder courtier was not punished at all upset many <br/>
people. <br/>
<br/>
To reinstate the honor of their lord and avenge his death, 47 of his <br/>
loyal retainers planned, over the course of 2 years, an elaborate <br/>
scheme to kill the elder courtier. They avenged their lord's death <br/>
and paraded through town with the head of the elder courtier. All 47 <br/>
were forced to commit seppuku as well. The play explores the initial <br/>
stories of several of the 47, focusing particularly on the life of <br/>
the leader of the ronin [lordless samurai]. The lead role was <br/>
performed by a master puppeteer who is in his 80's and was <br/>
designated a Living National Treasure. It's simply soaked in bathos. <br/>
A kind of who can outdo who in self-inflicted suffering. By the way, <br/>
the above summary is of the play, not of the actual historical event혰<br/>
which obviously differs from the play in many key places, for <br/>
example, the young lord who's death was being avenged, was in fact <br/>
stupid and cowardly.<br/>
<br/>
The story has been wildly popular in Japan ever since. It was made <br/>
into both a Kabuki and Bunraku play, and airs in dorama form on TV <br/>
every few years. Because it has so many good roles, Chuushingura is <br/>
a good way for a TV station to bring out and showcase all of its <br/>
major actors. Every year, there's a Chuushingura parade in the town <br/>
of Yamashina [a little south of Kyoto] because that's where the <br/>
leader of the 47 ronin lived. It's held on Dec. 14, the day they <br/>
finally avenged their master's death. The parade was interesting <br/>
because it was just random people from the town of Yamashina dressed <br/>
as various ronin. You could see families in the crowd saying "look, <br/>
there's dad" as men marched by in costume. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to the bunraku. The puppetry truly was enchanting. The <br/>
stage is huge and elaborate, with layers and layers to indicate the <br/>
outside, the outside of a building, and rooms inside, all of which <br/>
the puppets and puppeteers can pass through. In one of the scenes <br/>
near the end, white confetti drifted down in just the "outside" <br/>
layer to look like snow. On the right of the stage are chanters, who <br/>
chant the dialogue much in the same way that Noh plays are done, <br/>
except that it's much faster than the elongated drawls of Noh. <br/>
There're also shamisen players who provide accompaniment for the <br/>
chanters.<br/>
<br/>
A full Bunarku play is a whole day-long affair. I was only going for <br/>
the second half of it, which started at 4. I thought it would end by <br/>
6 or 7 and then could eat dinner in and explore Osaka. It carried on <br/>
until 9 pm. I really enjoyed Bunraku, but 5 straight hours of it <br/>
pushed me a little over the edge. It was a battle not to fall asleep <br/>
especially because I'd stayed up much of the night before reading <br/>
the English translation of the play. And so, my only experience of <br/>
Osaka was the subway and the Bunraku theater! But fear not, I did <br/>
eventually explore Osaka, and will write it all up, probably several <br/>
articles from now.</div>
