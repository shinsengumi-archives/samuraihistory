please bear with me (although the newer members of the group may find it <br/>
interesting).<br/>

Follow this link and you will find an article I wrote back in 1991 about the <br/>
historical Satsuma Rebellion (that's how long I've been researching this <br/>
period of Japanese history.<br/>

	Tantalizing little piece, would love to know your source. Especially <br/>
the bit about the swords. Satsuma "rebellion" swords are often seen and <br/>
dismissed for their low quality. I had however never heard that they <br/>
were from the arsenal at Kagoshima, which would add a delicious new <br/>
wrinkle to the story...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80811814">There is something to be said for including at least part of the previous <br/>
message.  I'm afraid I have to ask "the source for what"?<br/>
<br/>
Between work and home, I get well over 200 e-mails a day and I can't always <br/>
remember what I've written to whom.<br/>
<br/>
If you will remind me of what I wrote, I'd be happy to track down the source <br/>
for you.<br/>
