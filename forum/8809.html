<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089712786">Hello, <br/>
<br/>
I've been a member of this mailing list for a fair while now, I don't post<br/>
much unless I'm sure about a subject and have referred to respected sources<br/>
for verification and I am always open to correction.... I do read a lot of<br/>
the posts as there are some real experts lurking in the shadows here.<br/>
<br/>
I've been a Martial Arts aficionado and amateur historian, as well as a<br/>
published author since my teens which is a while ago now, and normally<br/>
there's very little in this mailing group than makes me shake my head in<br/>
dismay.<br/>
<br/>
This week has been different, it would be nice if before posting for the<br/>
first time, second time, or at all, newcomers would take themselves to the<br/>
history books or even a well respected website and actually learn a little<br/>
about the subject they are posting on.<br/>
<br/>
As a separate point, if you learnt what you *believe* you know from anything<br/>
produced by Hollywood, think again.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing worse than appearing to be a fool and an imbecile in front<br/>
of your peers.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards.<br/>
<br/>
