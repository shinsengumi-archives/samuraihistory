<h3>The tetsubo in Japanese military history</h3>
by <i>cez_72</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632742163">Hi. I have been discussing the actual existence/use of tetsubo with <br/>
some fellow RPG players.<br/>
<br/>
Tetsubo ("iron staff"?) are those big and heavy iron studded staves <br/>
often seen in old samurai prints. They seem to have been popular <br/>
during the Gempei war and/or Kamakura period. I have also read that <br/>
they were used as a kind of psychological weapon, to intimidate the <br/>
enemies with a "big fu*king club". (I seem to remember that nodachi <br/>
blades were also used for a similar purpose, in later eras).<br/>
<br/>
According to another source found on the internet, the tetsubo was <br/>
also - and foremost - employed from horseback (which surprised me, <br/>
because I would have thought that a such a weapon would be too <br/>
cumbersome to be used effectively from the saddle), so the wielder <br/>
could add the mount's momentum to his swing, for a truly devastating <br/>
blow.<br/>
<br/>
I still wonder to what extent the tetsubos were actually used on the <br/>
battlefield.<br/>
Were they a common sight on the battlefield or were they limited <br/>
to earlier historic periods and/or specific tactical purposes? <br/>
Were there a specific martial style associated with the tetsubo, such <br/>
as to allow something like basic parries, counterattacks or "called <br/>
shots", or their use was simple and straightforward (a- lift weapon; <br/>
b- lower weapon on enemy's head; 3- repeat from 1.)? They don't look <br/>
like they could be used like a naginata, a bo staff or anything like <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Any info on the subject is appreciated.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

I did own a tetsubo some years ago but it was of late manufacture and actually had a sword blade inside. Whilst I may be wrong, I believe they were, like the naginata, a prefered weapon of the yama-bushi or warrior monks. I think towards the end of Edo period they were more used as ornaments in daimyo processions and the like. I have a Meiji period photo of an armoured samurai with a tetsubo, so they certainly did exist. I am surprised that it was used from horseback and am sure that tetsubojutsu was a minor martial way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is completely conjecture, but while on the whole,<br/>
tetsubo were limited to the Gempei War through Onin,<br/>
it's certainly conceivable that an eccentric warrior<br/>
would carry one even later. A modern analogy would be<br/>
the old, crusty Colonel who refuses to give up his .45<br/>
caliber pistol, despite the fact that the Army has<br/>
used the 9mm Beretta M9 for decades now. (this is a<br/>
true story, by the way--I know the guy, and he caused<br/>
his officer in charge of ordering ammunition all kinds<br/>
of heartache trying to find .45 rounds for the darn<br/>
thing.) While unusual, there's nothing that would<br/>
actually prevent someone from carrying a tetsubo in<br/>
1583, to use Tom's example of Shizugatake. The guy<br/>
would probably have thought he was being a badass.<br/>
