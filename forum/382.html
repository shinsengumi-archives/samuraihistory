<div id="ygrps-yiv-465575494">Confucianism wasn't big until the Tokugawa made it<br/>
big. Tony can correct me, probably, but I would hazard<br/>
a guess that THAT's the way IT WAS DONE, so that's the<br/>
way it was. Also, I don't know the credibility, but I<br/>
read somewhere that bumping scabbards was a big no-no;<br/>
having people with scabbards on either side of them<br/>
created a whole bunch of problems, so they were all<br/>
taught to have them on the left, requiring a<br/>
right-handed draw. <br/>
<br/>
I would also hazard a guess that much like Europe<br/>
lefties were considered "odd" and should be trained<br/>
out of it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122819380">Hi Nate, and all - <br/>
<br/>
"Also, I don't know the credibility, but I read somewhere that <br/>
bumping scabbards was a big no-no"<br/>
<br/>
Indeed it was. Saya clashing (saya-biki? I can't remember the <br/>
term) was an unforgivable offence and when it happened swords <br/>
would be drawn instantly - effectively it was an invitation to <br/>
a duel.<br/>
<br/>
'Gunsliger' type samurai would strut round the streets with the <br/>
sword worn almost flat across the stomach so the saya stuck out <br/>
as far as possible to the side. More restrained samurai would <br/>
wear their swords something over 45 degrees across the body - <br/>
utilising the curve of the blade to keep the saya to the rear <br/>
as much as possible, whilst a small move of the left hand on <br/>
the saya would move the butt of the hilt towards a potential <br/>
enemy to the front, ready for a draw.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a lovely move by a venerable old iai master who showed a <br/>
way to avoid this unfortunate occurance:<br/>
<br/>
Left hand sits naturally on top of the saya just below the <br/>
hilt, thumb next to belly, knuckles facing out. As the <br/>
'gunslinger' (or should that be saya slinger?) approaches, just <br/>
before the clash, the old man tightens his grip, turns the <br/>
knuckles downward and at the same time pulls his fist up <br/>
towards his shoulder. This action 'screws' in his saya and the <br/>
sword ends up held close in and parallel to the body, thus <br/>
avoiding the clash!<br/>
<br/>
Bad guy, who missed the move, also having missed his mark, <br/>
stumbles uncertainly and the old boy then draws his sword and <br/>
cuts him down with ease!<br/>
<br/>
It's all in a day's work.<br/>
<br/>
