<h3>Last Samurai - my take</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-862724429">Hi there - I've finally seen it. I am not going to discuss the story <br/>
here yet, because I couldn't do so without spoilers, but after reading <br/>
a few comments I've seen on IMDB and other movie website, I'd like to <br/>
say one thing.<br/>
That is, do not go to see 'Last Samurai' with the expectation to see a <br/>
super-realistic, super-historically-accurate movie. I really do not <br/>
think that was the idea of the producers/director/Tom.<br/>
I would really take it for what it is: historical fiction with <br/>
beautiful photography and cinematography, some memorable scene, a <br/>
simple plot, and some mainstream cliche'.<br/>
However, I really enjoyed it. For me, it's a 4,5/5.<br/>

 <br/>
Yours is the only post I've read about The Last Samurai that doesn't give the movie away for the rest of us who haven't seen it yet, and has taken the movie for what it is...entertainment. Thanks! :)<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Last Samurai - my take</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-722730389">I enjoyed the movie, too. I give 3 out of 5.<br/>
We are all grown-ups. I hope that people know what is<br/>
real and what is not.(although I am aware that there<br/>
are some under-aged people in this group without the<br/>
age restriction)<br/>
<br/>
My point is this, though. If you want to compare<br/>
yourself with say, Kenshin, limit your comparison<br/>
between you and Kenshin. Do not extend it to between<br/>
Japan and America. <br/>
It is like saying that hey I am from Japan. So,<br/>
everybody here has swords. Or I am from America.<br/>
Everybody here is intelligent... It is just silly.<br/>
<br/>
As a foreigner, when I meet American friends, I do<br/>
find very respectful and competent people. But, I do<br/>
meet some loser who just makes me uncomfortable by<br/>
tying his or her identity to that of America, saying<br/>
that I am a merely(?!) Korean... These losers have<br/>
obviously have problem with his or her self-esteem,<br/>
which I can not help.<br/>
<br/>
But, when I see America, I think of John. F. Kennedy,<br/>
Georgy Washington, Kenneth. Galbraith, Walt Rostow,<br/>
and etc... That is why I came to this country. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                           Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
