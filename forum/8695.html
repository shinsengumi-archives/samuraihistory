<div id="ygrps-yiv-835878631">Greetings. I have just discovered and joined the group. It looks great.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that someone might be able to tell me where I can locate <br/>
any books on Samurai in the Japanese "Gakken" series. In particular, I <br/>
am looking for books on Uesugi Kenshin and Shingen Takeda. I own just <br/>
about everything done on them in english.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can find all of the ones that are still in print at amazon.co.jp,<br/>
however the Shingen books look like they are out of print. Uesugi<br/>
Kenshin is still in print, and you can get it here:<br/>

<br/>
I have ordered quite a bit off amazon.co.jp, the shipping usually runs<br/>
about $10, and I get it within 7 days or so.</div>
