Not long ago I posted a question about the fires in the Yoshiwara or <br/>

someone has information regarding the historical timeline of those <br/>
fires. If anyone does please I'd really like to know. I've searched and <br/>
searched but to no avail. Thank you all.<br/>

I found a website for japanese art and it had a timeline that said there was <br/>
a fire in 1657 that destroyed Yoshiwara.The website is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428180916">Hi Nate:<br/>
  First of all let me thank you for your answer but I think I should have been more specific about my question regarding the fires of the Yoshiwara. Yes I am aware of the great fire of 1657 I have found information on that part of the history but there were also fires during the late nineteenth century one of them I believe occured in the year 1861. You see it has much harder finding that sort of information but if you Nate or anyone else has or knows of where I can find that information I would be most grateful.<br/>

Don't take this the wrong way, but there's quite a<br/>
difference between "Give me info about fires in Edo<br/>
and the Yoshiwara" and "I'm specifically interested in<br/>
the fire of 1861". It helps unbelievably to be<br/>
specific in what your question is. I was mildly<br/>
annoyed that you said you'd looked and couldn't find<br/>
anything, when a simple Google search came up with a<br/>
ton of sites (admittedly, mostly scanty info like<br/>
Wikipedia, but still). However, if you're looking for<br/>
a specific fire at a specific date, that changes<br/>
things quite a bit. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, not sure I've got anything that can help<br/>
you with your specific question. <br/>

  I feel bad that my question annoyed you or anyone else. I guess I assumed if I mentioned timeline it would be enough to mean the entire history of the Yoshiwara fires in Tokyo since there was more than one in the entire history of the Yoshiwara since its creation in the seventeenth century. But again let me apologize and assure that in the future I will be more specific and not allow myself to assume anything when it pertains to an inquiry. Thank you anyway for your help in this matter. Everybody have a great day.<br/>

It's no big deal. As a moderator, it's sometimes<br/>
frustrating when people come on here and ask<br/>
open-ended, general questions without doing any<br/>
research, like "Can someone tell me everything about<br/>
the Samurai???????" <br/>
<br/>
Obviously yours is not a case like this--have no fear,<br/>
there will be no smiting. It's much more<br/>
understandable that you can't find many sources if<br/>
you're looking for a specific fire (1861). When people<br/>
ask general questions (Tell me about fires in Edo!)<br/>
and say they can't find anything, I tend to do a quick<br/>
google search to see what comes up. In this case, I<br/>
found quite a bit about fires in Edo, most referencing<br/>
the 1657 fire. Your mention of a timeline, as opposed<br/>
to a specific time, indicated to me you didn't know<br/>
what year you were looking for. Since I found several<br/>
pages of hits in less than 2 minutes, it made me doubt<br/>
how hard you actually looked. Looking for specific<br/>
information about the fire in 1861, I can see how the<br/>
pages that came up (most of the Wiki variety) didn't<br/>
help at all, and you'd turn here for more specifics. <br/>
<br/>
Most of the regulars (and you've been here a while, so<br/>
you probably are familiar with the problem) will tell<br/>
you that we often get people here who have spent a<br/>
total of 30 seconds online, haven't found the answer<br/>
to whatever question they have, and ask here when if<br/>
they'd invested 5 minutes with a decent search engine,<br/>
they could find it. Again, I'm glad we are not dealing<br/>
with that--I'll poke around some more and see what I<br/>
can find for you, though. Will Japanese<br/>
sources/webpages work for you? <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Yoshiwara</h3>
by <i>g3mneye</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142151007">Hi Nate:<br/>
  Thank you for your explanation. And yes Japanese web sources would be alright. Finding this specific date is tougher than I thought it was going to be. I had encountered the timeline dating from the seventeenth century to the nineteenth concerning the fires in a book years ago and remembered that the yoshiwara had burned several times but never got the specific months in that timeline. I didn't care then but now my nonchalance has come back to haunt me when I require the information. Serves me right.<br/>
  Again thanks Nate and sorry for my comment on the hakamas. I had read about that fact in a book I had found in a library once. I can remember facts just not details like titles of books, I should improve that fault of mine. Thanks for you help.<br/>

It's no big deal. As a moderator, it's sometimes<br/>
frustrating when people come on here and ask<br/>
open-ended, general questions without doing any<br/>
research, like "Can someone tell me everything about<br/>
the Samurai???????" <br/>
<br/>
Obviously yours is not a case like this--have no fear,<br/>
there will be no smiting. It's much more<br/>
understandable that you can't find many sources if<br/>
you're looking for a specific fire (1861). When people<br/>
ask general questions (Tell me about fires in Edo!)<br/>
and say they can't find anything, I tend to do a quick<br/>
google search to see what comes up. In this case, I<br/>
found quite a bit about fires in Edo, most referencing<br/>
the 1657 fire. Your mention of a timeline, as opposed<br/>
to a specific time, indicated to me you didn't know<br/>
what year you were looking for. Since I found several<br/>
pages of hits in less than 2 minutes, it made me doubt<br/>

Don't take this the wrong way, but there's quite a<br/>
difference between "Give me info about fires in Edo<br/>
and the Yoshiwara" and "I'm specifically interested in<br/>
the fire of 1861". It helps unbelievably to be<br/>
specific in what your question is. I was mildly<br/>
annoyed that you said you'd looked and couldn't find<br/>
anything, when a simple Google search came up with a<br/>
ton of sites (admittedly, mostly scanty info like<br/>
Wikipedia, but still). However, if you're looking for<br/>
a specific fire at a specific date, that changes<br/>
things quite a bit. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, not sure I've got anything that can help<br/>
you with your specific question. <br/>

decline. What the black ships did more than anything else was reveal how<br/>
weak the shogunate actually was, which came as a real shock to many. The<br/>
enemies of the shogunate and the Imperial court were quick to seize on<br/>
this discovery and kick-start what was likely inevitable anyway, black<br/>
ships or no black ships - the bakumatsu, or 'last days of the<br/>
shogunate'.<br/>
 <br/>
The tozama clans, such as the Shimazu of Satsuma for example, had held a<br/>
grudge of sorts ever since the formation of the shogunate due to their<br/>

 <br/>
The shogunate became a very corrupt body, and as soon as it began to<br/>
lose it's true military nature (after the first three shoguns) it began<br/>
to lose it's effectiveness and really struggled to deal with the rapidly<br/>
changing conditions in Japan during the 18th and 19th centuries. The<br/>
structure of the shogunate - a ruling body loosely overseeing largely<br/>
autonomous states who each have their own military power - was long<br/>
outdated by the mid-19th century, especially when compared with the<br/>
England\Russia\France's of the world. If the shogunate had not fallen<br/>
when it did it could have been disastrous for Japan, because the lack of<br/>
a national military and true national government would have invited<br/>
trouble had the other world powers, Russia perhaps most especially,<br/>
attacked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481479193">True enough Nate. That's the reason I was looking for help concerning the Yoshiwara fires during the late 19th century. I can remember reading about it happening but can't remember exactly where or the specific detail like month or season. I think I need to visit the library, bookstore or the university of Hawai'i over here. Thanks again Nate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080521114">Oh yes never looked at it that way. But when we look back at this and the good if you will made them very imperialistic. Do you think this had something to do with the interventions of the west? In a span of lest than 50 of this new Japanese regiment they where defeating countries like Russia and invading China. However, I do want my next statement to do more than to relate; if there is a samurai nature or samurai spirit could or shouldn't it still be today. Like many newcomers espescially think when they spend a course of time in Japan learning culture and such (and they get the idea that they too are samurai: I myself included) that this spirit still lives on. I lived there for 3 years and did not know that the profession was no longer. But maybe the spirit is still very real. OH Oh I got it why dont we just make a new one? New aged samurai. HMM its a thought. <br/>

I found a book at my local library that explains a lot about the fires in the Yoshiwara throughout its history. the title is Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan by Cecilia Segawa Siegle. Its by University of Hawai'i press. Some of you might want to look it up it. Anyway thank you to all who lent me their precious time and patience in this matter. <br/>
