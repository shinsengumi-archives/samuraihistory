<h3>Questions for story</h3>
by <i>miburo_saitoh</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-968903324">Hi guys, as I said on my first post I'm writing a samurai story and I <br/>
need some help with a couple questions I have:<br/>
<br/>
1. In what year did Tokugawa Ieyasu pass the edict that allied lords <br/>
had to spend some time in or near Edo?<br/>
<br/>
2. How much time did they have to spend there?<br/>
<br/>
3. Where did these lords stay? A kind of "guest" castle, or where...?<br/>
<br/>
4. One of the fictional lords I will use has the surname Iwamura. I <br/>
know Iwamura was the place of a battle (I think this battle even took <br/>
place near the time frame of my story), I would like to know what <br/>
does Iwamura mean (or perhaps Iwa and mura separated, I think it has <br/>
to do something about a hawk?)<br/>
<br/>
5. Is an army of some five thousand men and six hundred cavalry big <br/>
(for one single lord)? I think that, at least, six hundred horses <br/>
sound like a lot...<br/>
<br/>
6. How many riflemen did lords have at their disposal? I know this <br/>
depends on the lord, but if you guys know of examples...<br/>

many like myself feel that whatever it is you are writing will suffer <br/>

beginning from zero; the story isn't per se a historical fiction, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734547807">." In what year did Tokugawa Ieyasu pass the edict that allied lords<br/>

<br/>
The Sankin Kotai system was a gradual process that developed over the reigns<br/>
of Ieyasu, Hidetada, and Iemitsu. Most of the regulations were established<br/>
by Iemitsu in the 1630's. For more info you might check out a book 'Feudal<br/>
Control in Tokugawa Japan' by Toshio Tsukahira. It will give you the whole<br/>
history of the system.<br/>
<br/>
". How much time did they have to spend there"<br/>
<br/>
It depended on the Daimyo. Most spent one year. Some for example the<br/>
Matsumae of Ezo, because of the distance, were exempt from attendance.<br/>
<br/>
"Where did these lords stay? A kind of "guest" castle, or where...?"<br/>
<br/>
They had there own permanent residence (sometimes even two). Remember the<br/>
Daimyo went back and forth to his domain but his family always lived in Edo.<br/>
<br/>
"I would like to know what does Iwamura mean (or perhaps Iwa and mura<br/>
separated, I think it has<br/>
to do something about a hawk?)"<br/>
<br/>
It depends on what kanji you use to write it. There are two historical<br/>
families by that name both written as 岩村 which can be translated as 'rock<br/>
village'. I wouldn't however worry to much about the meaning of the name.<br/>
Most samurai names were taken from the place they settled in.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other questions I can't answer offhand but again check our<br/>
Tsukihiras tome.<br/>
<br/>
If you are writing historical fiction may I suggest some writers that may<br/>
give you a feel for the genre. Ryotaro Shiba, Eiji Yoshikawa, Kunio Tsuji,<br/>
Shotaro Ikenami, Masuji Ibuse, Shusaku Endo. All of these have some works<br/>
translated into English.</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-711409325">Thanks a lot for your answers. As for a feel of the genre I have been <br/>
watching Kurosawa films, but I'm also eyeing Yoshikawa's "Musashi" <br/>
(that is set is the same timeframe). <br/>
<br/>
For references these are the ones I have come up so far that have <br/>
grabbed my attention:<br/>
<br/>
"Sekigahara 1600" - also set in the timeframe I'm looking for, and I <br/>
would also like some insight into samurai battle strategies. This <br/>
book apparently has this; do anyone here own the book?<br/>
<br/>
"Samurai Warfare" - again, a good insight into samurai....well, <br/>
warfare. <br/>
<br/>
"Samurai Warlords" and other Turnbull books.<br/>
<br/>
"Musashi" - as you said, a feel for the genre.<br/>
<br/>
p.d. I wanted to know the meaning of the name "Iwamura" in case I can <br/>
apply a metaphorical meaning to it. The meaning turns out to be <br/>
perfect (Rock village) for the story...in this way I would like to <br/>
find out meanings on other names, to make them "fit" the character <br/>
(another one is Makoto, which I believe means "honor").<br/>

Don't think too much about meaning and names. It gets obnoxious. Are girls named "Rose" really flowers? Are all guys<br/>

<br/>
It can get obnoxious, and I'm not planning on doing that on every <br/>
character, but remember that this is literature, so you can get away <br/>
with a person that has a name reflecting his/her personality, as a <br/>
symbolic gesture.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the correction on the meaning of "Makoto", now I <br/>
understand why a certain character was named that way in "Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin"...;)<br/>

It appears that you have picked several "popular" books on which to accumulate some background knowledge - and there is little problem with that.... However, I would recommend a recently published book to give you an overall feel and vision of the times: "Samurai, an illustrated history" by Mitsuo Kure, 2001; published by  Tuttle - plenty of full coloured photos of re-enactors, banners and battle plans.  And I suppose reading a few novels of the time would provide some faction base - Clavell's "SHOGUN" must be regarded as essential..<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the writing....<br/>

<br/>
As an aside I used to enjoy the old western movies - I knew they were mostly factually incorrect - but it was entertainment!! So it is not unexpected that I look forward to "The Last Samurai" [and I will probably buy the video (or DVD) when it comes out]. I didn't look for wrist watches, telegraph poles and jet trails in the sky on "Waterloo", so I enjoyed it....  Treat "The Last Samurai" as entertainment, we couldn't look to Shakespear for history lessons! And it may even give another generation interest in "our" subject as the novel SHOGUN did........<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-367064447">Well, now that I'm calmed down (indeed I was offended), I'll explain <br/>
to you what is the spirit of my story.<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke"? You wouldn't know <br/>
precisely which timeframe the story belongs to if it wasn't for a <br/>
brief mention of Emperor Tensho (who I think ruled in the late <br/>
1500s...). However, the story's a fantasy: the lead <br/>
character "Ashitaka" is cursed by the toach of a Boar God (who was in <br/>
turn cursed by hate, a tatarigami), and is banished from his village, <br/>
embarking on a quest to find a way to lift his curse. In the way he <br/>
encounters tons of people (including some samurai warlords) and gods <br/>
(wolf, boar, and dear gods), yet there is never a heavy load of <br/>
historical info; in fact, there is almost none, save the details of <br/>
daily living in that time.<br/>
<br/>
That's the kind of story I'm writing; the historical info is more of <br/>
a way to set myself into that timeframe, and to give the story <br/>
some "realistic" feel to something that is mostly fantastic <br/>
(werewolves, gods, etc...). Now, it if were something more along the <br/>
lines of "Ran" or "Musashi", your points would be very valid (and I'm <br/>
with you on that aspect completely), but it's just something else. I <br/>
apologize for the confusion, for I should have stated the nature of <br/>
my story more explicitely from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
And to answer your question, the target audience leans more towards <br/>
anime/manga people than samurai history scholars/fans.<br/>
<br/>
p.d. so what the banner of the Shinsengumi has written is "Makoto"?<br/>

to see if I can find at least one of these books. <br/>
<br/>
I think I enjoy westerns more now that I see some parallel between <br/>
them and samurai; and your sentiments are mine, even if - as it's to <br/>
be expected - "The Last Samurai" misses the mark in historical <br/>
details, what really matters is that the story be good, and immerses <br/>
you in it. "Gladiator" is my favorite movie, yet I'm well aware of <br/>
the historical liberties they took for the sake of their story...<br/>

	Since this flowed out of the "accuracy in movies" thread my <br/>
filters were on full bore and I missed the "fantasy" bit and I was <br/>
being a smart alec to boot, as often happens with email it doesn't <br/>
always come across that way. Don't forget that anime/manga fans and <br/>
Japanese history buffs are not always mutually exclusive <br/>
groups,though some are tougher critics.<br/>
	Yes the banner of the Shinsengumi reads Makoto; truth, <br/>
sincerity, "loyalty to one's beliefs". The last interpretation being <br/>
the meaning I think they had in mind, believing the Tokugawa Shogun <br/>
to be a just and rightful leader. Someone who deserved their loyalty <br/>
and the proper agent of the Emperors' will.<br/>
