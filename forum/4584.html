<h3>Time to throw things at the new guy!</h3>
by <i>satotetsutaro</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-896495747">Greetings Gents,<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in a previous email I have been reading Stephen <br/>
Turnbull's "Samurai a Military History."<br/>
<br/>
I have a question concerning the Battle of Uji, 20 June 1180.<br/>
<br/>
1) How long was the Uji bridge (width and length), or the width of <br/>
the Ujigawa at this location?<br/>
<br/>
2) The map on page 26 is not very detailed. Where is the Byodo-in, in <br/>
relation to the Uji bridge and the box representing Nara shown on the <br/>
map? Does anybody have a more detailed map of the region with the <br/>
places marked and the topography?<br/>
<br/>
3) Turnbull states that the Minamoto forces at the battle numbered <br/>
300. Does anybody know the composition of these forces? He does <br/>
mention that some were monks. How many?<br/>
<br/>
4) Turnball states that at the time of this battle the Taira were <br/>
raising an army of 20,000. How many fought at the Battle of Uji and <br/>
what was the composition of those troops?<br/>
<br/>
While I like the book and his writing style I do think that it lacks <br/>
the detail of a true military study. Any help with the above <br/>
questions would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Now for a couple of technical questions:<br/>
<br/>
1)	What was the average range for archers of the time? Turnbull <br/>
states 350 yards. Then in the chapter covering the Mongol invasions <br/>
he states that due to the period of relative peace between the Mongol <br/>
invasions and the Gempei War that this range had degraded and that <br/>
archers from Kyushu did not have the skill or range than archers from <br/>
the east.<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody shed any light on this?<br/>
<br/>
Well enough for now. Back to the book.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Bill M.<br/>

long.<br/>

If you can't read Japanese, then the Byoudou-in is in the lower-left <br/>

inflated just like most old histories are. It might have been closer <br/>
to 50 samurai. But I'll leave the rest to the experts. :)<br/>

This is a pretty neat picture. It is taken from on top of the <br/>
modern Uji Bridge. You can get a sense of how wide the river is <br/>
today (although again I don't know how wide it was in 1180). The <br/>
Byou-dou-in is one of the buildings in the right of the picture. <br/>
Personally I can't figure out which of the buildings it is -- but it <br/>
gives you a sense of the closeness of the building to the bridge.<br/>

THe link didn't work for me, but if you look at the<br/>
back of a 10 yen coin, you'll see the Byodo-in. It's<br/>
got a central building, flanked by two wings--at the<br/>
end of the wings are raised "turret"-like rooftops.<br/>
The whole structure is on, for lack of a better term,<br/>
stilts--it's on the water. Been a decade since I was<br/>
there, so I don't remember if it's on the river or<br/>
near it on another body of water. <br/>
<br/>
I'll try to hit that link again later.<br/>

<br/>
And I spent a few days in Kyoto last week, then hit<br/>
Miyajima again...it was nice to get away. You don't<br/>
REALLY realize how stinking huge Tokyo is until a. you<br/>
get away for a while and b. you ride above it in a<br/>
helicopter, as I did earlier today. The cool thing<br/>
was, I saw my house!<br/>

they mean "somewhat adjacent to, with sort of in the vicinity"....<br/>

Tried the link again, apparently I can get to it from<br/>
home, and not from work, where I was before. Now that<br/>
I SEE the picture, it makes more sense--how can you<br/>

Thanks for all this. It helps to see what you are reading about! I don't<br/>
think that Turnbulls map was oriented correctly, north being to the top,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Trains do that, especially subways, because you don't<br/>
SEE where you are going. You go down a tube, travel,<br/>
and come out another one. It throws off all perception<br/>
of distance. When I actually started riding my bike to<br/>
work, it was amazing to see how close everything was. <br/>

  Ok, checked a map. The complex actually "touches the river" (on the <br/>
  West Bank), thou the temple itself is a bit detached from it. The water <br/>
  in front of the temple is indeed a pond.<br/>

Since I'm not seeing what you're seeing it's hard for me to comment on <br/>
Turnbull's map. Do the two maps (Turnbull's and the above link) <br/>
basically match in orientation?<br/>

45' axis, SE to NW.  (later it bends to the SW, and merges with the <br/>
Kamo and the Kizu to form the Yodo in Osaka)<br/>
Thus, you can say that Byodo-in is on the W bank, but at the same time <br/>
it's on the S bank as well... Basically it's SW of the river that runs <br/>
SE to NW.<br/>
Hope I didn't confuse you any further...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's probably just a question of nuance. Right at the Byou-dou-in, <br/>
the river is rather more "up and down". <br/>

Thanks to you and others for al your help! I will scan the map and put it in<br/>
the files section so that you and all who are interested may see it and<br/>
offer their opinions and advice. I know that this seems like an awful lot of<br/>
questions for such a small engagement but it is fast turning out that the<br/>
Gempei Wars are becoming my favorite subject of study. Since starting<br/>
Turnbull's book I have purchased a copy of "The Tale of the Heike" in two<br/>
volumes translated by Hiroshi Kitagawa and Bruce T. Tsuchida with a forward<br/>
by Edward Seidensticker published by the University of Tokyo Press and a<br/>
copy of "Yoshitsune" translated by Helen Craig McCullough published by<br/>
Stanford University Press under the auspices of the Tokyo University Press.<br/>
I read through "Yoshitsune" in one night! I could not put it down. No<br/>
greater tale of chivalrous valor and adventure has ever come out of any<br/>
other time period including the knights of the roundtable! I will start "The<br/>
Tale of the Heike" when I finish Turnbull so please be prepared to put up<br/>
with more questions as I try to fully learn about and understand this most<br/>
fascinating history.<br/>

Dunno if it may help, however the Uji River runs almost exactly on a <br/>
45' axis, SE to NW.  (later it bends to the SW, and merges with the <br/>
Kamo and the Kizu to form the Yodo in Osaka)<br/>
Thus, you can say that Byodo-in is on the W bank, but at the same time <br/>
it's on the S bank as well... Basically it's SW of the river that runs <br/>
SE to NW.<br/>
Hope I didn't confuse you any further...<br/>

earlier than my main interest (late Sengoku). I'm not sure how much <br/>
I can offer - although I'm always glad to just chat about stuff.<br/>
