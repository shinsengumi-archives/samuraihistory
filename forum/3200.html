<h3>Militarty & court ranks.</h3>
by <i>muds_theaz</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956390933">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently researching The Sengoku period. When searching around <br/>
on the web, or reading through books I see mention of court titles <br/>
such as Gyobusho (court minister), and ranks such as vassals and <br/>
retainers. However, I'm finding it very difficult to actually find a <br/>
layout of the ranks in these sorts of hierarchies and what came above <br/>
them, below them. Such as: The Daimyo, below him he had vassals (how <br/>
did he choose who were to be his vassals?) and what is the difference <br/>
between a Vassal and a Retainer? Ideally I'd like to find out what <br/>
the ranking system was for both the court and the countries military <br/>
was (not just the Daimyos). And, even better, the Imperial Guards.<br/>
Also, does anyone know if this hierarchy changed when Yoritomo began <br/>
the trend of Shogun leaders rather then Royal heads of state?</div>

It looks like these are all more or less Kamakura-era ranks (or at <br/>
least pre-sengoku) and at one point were actually associated with <br/>
concrete positions. By the time the Sengoku came around, I think they <br/>
were more or less empty titles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344996727">Hello--<br/>
<br/>
All vassal and retainer mean are that you serve<br/>
someone--they are not "ranks". There is no difference<br/>
between the two of them--if I have a lord, I am his<br/>
vassal, and also his retainer. A vassal technically<br/>
speaking is someone who owes loyalty to someone else;<br/>
a retainer is someone who's services are "retained" as<br/>
opposed to a merceneray who is hired. Different<br/>
origins, same essential result. <br/>
<br/>
The military, per se, didn't have a rank structure<br/>
such as you would think of today. For instance, in the<br/>
Ashigaru ranks you'd have someone appointed Captain of<br/>
Ashigaru, or Ashigaru-kashira, and under him would be<br/>
an Ashigaru Kogashira, or "little captain", but it<br/>
wasn't necessarily that you went through these ranks,<br/>
got promoted or demoted or whatever. They were more<br/>
job descriptions than ranks. Above them would be an<br/>
Ashigaru-Taisho (Ashigaru General), who'd command a<br/>
whole lot of people. Generally speaking, a general is<br/>
a Taisho, but just about anyone could be a taisho--if<br/>
you commanded 1,000 or 100,000 men, you were a Taisho.<br/>
There was no difference necessarily in rank--just in<br/>
prestige or power. <br/>
<br/>
For court ranks, which are really what mattered to<br/>
most individuals, try<br/>
<br/>
www.sengokydaimyo.com<br/>
<br/>
Tony's got a whole huge explanation on there. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think he was the absolute first. He was 'sessho,' but the title was <br/>
then changed in 'kampaku' in 882. He had been 'udaijin' and later <br/>
daijo-daijin as well.<br/>
Those Fujiwara... ;o)<br/>

If anyone knows of a decent translation site, it would be excellent. <br/>
