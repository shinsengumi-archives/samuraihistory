<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446735305">Hello group,<br/>
 Just thought that I would introduce myself.  My name is John and I am <br/>
a student of Japanese language and Anthropology.  My main interest, of <br/>
course, is the history and culture of Japan.  What I plan to do with <br/>
this interest is unknown to me, but I was hoping to chat with some <br/>
like minded individuals in this forum. Hello.</div>
