 </span></blockquote>Interesting site, I've even heard of the style... It has a bit too much <br/>
of the one true way for me to feel comfortable with it.<br/>
<br/>
Quote from JKA site "Bushido: The Way of the Samurai /Bushido/ has been <br/>
the samurai code of conduct in Japan for centuries. Based firmly on the <br/>
teachings of Zen, /Bushido/ was intended to help the samurai master <br/>
their nature and understand their minds and the universe through direct <br/>
experienceâ€”as well as through fostering strength, self-control and wisdom."<br/>
<br/>
Is Bushido really based on Zen? Or is it just a nasty perversion created <br/>
to justify brutality and the abdication of personal responsibility? Zen <br/>
covers a wide range even in Japan, not counting some of the Chinese <br/>
versions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >     Because of recent e-mails about the relationship between Bushido and Karate, I have decided to write an essay on this subject, using evidence from JKA masters as well as extracts from respected books. <br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looking forward to it, I will read it if you write it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >This is my final attempt to prove to you all there is such a strong link between the 2. I hope you all will then decide to do your own research to compliment this essay. Thank you very much.<br/>
