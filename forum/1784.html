<div id="ygrps-yiv-366015022">Hi Tom<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you that Hollywood cartes nothing for<br/>
maintaining the accurate story.<br/>
<br/>
to proove my point all I have to do is mention<br/>
<br/>
Doctor Dolittle - wicked film lovd it but its not Doc<br/>
Dolittle is it (except the 0.5 sec shot of the 2<br/>
headed lama)<br/>
<br/>
The Jackel. strange how the story moved from Europe to<br/>
the USA. <br/>
<br/>
And yesterday my 7 years old daughter subjected me to<br/>
Barbies Rapuntzel - right character - but where did<br/>
the dragons, magic and talking rabbit come from. <br/>
<br/>
However I like Tom Cruise and I love the aspect of<br/>
this story line. it reminds me of the Sun Rises<br/>
trilogy by Christopher Nicol. In that stpory a USA<br/>
military ends up in Japan working witht he satsuma<br/>
samurai (if I remember right) and even becomes a<br/>
samurai thats a family - bit of shogun over flow there<br/>
I think<br/>

This was my fear as well, unfortunately, I'm not as informed with this aspect of japanese history as I'd like to be, so seeing the movie, I wouldn't be able to conclude much on the historical accuracy.  Now if an independant company had produced this, maybe I would have had a bit more faith.<br/>

<br/>
A quick response which may generate some discussion from our learnered body!<br/>
<br/>
I remember seeing a strange device at Snowshill Manor, Broadway, some years ago - it was a japanese, vertical device with an arrangement of springs and levers dating from the 17th century. On enquiring its purposer, I was told it was a device for measuring time elapsed... It appears that our "western" day of 24hours was divided into two parts, being night and day. Nothing strange there until it was pointed out that night = sunset to sunrise and day = sunrise to sunset. Now the "clever bit" - of course through the year the number of hours from sunrise to sunset varies but there had to be a similar time period night and day {whatever it was say for now 6 periods!} ie varying "hours". The device was so made to compensate for seasonal changes... I suppose thinking about it we had sundials (but little sun!) before chronometers came along.....<br/>
<br/>
Well thats a start anyway.... and if you are in the Cotswolds Area make sure you visit Snowshill (National Trust) it had a unique collection of "samurai" armour.<br/>

thanks for that. <br/>

Just to see the armour would be worth the visit. I<br/>
just found out Nottingham castle museum has several<br/>
sets that have been mothballed for maybe 20 years.<br/>
they havent a clue whats in the crates apart from -<br/>
japanese armour.<br/>
<br/>
The set they have on display in the castle is<br/>
beautiful but unfortunately the sunate are upside<br/>
down. Not that anyone would notice (same as in Trident<br/>

Yoroi mounted back to front LOL)<br/>

<br/>
Cjris Nicol is a welsh man (British to those who dont<br/>
know where Wales is) who worked as a journalist for<br/>
many years in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
He as far as I know still lives in Japan and works<br/>
with some nature company now.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldnt be surprised to find out that he read about<br/>
Thomas Glover and created this story.<br/>
<br/>
Just like Clavel did with Shogun.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks tom for that.<br/>

      I like the idea of the story as well. Why not<br/>
then tell the <br/>
true story of the actual American Arms dealer, Thomas<br/>
Glover, who <br/>
sold Civil war surplus to the anti-Tokugawa<br/>
forces?(this may be the <br/>
one and only time American arms dealers were supplying<br/>
the forces of <br/>
good) One of my favorite photographs from the period<br/>
shows him in <br/>
Nagasaki I believe, surrounded by Satsuma shishi, at<br/>
his side is his <br/>
very young son. I always wished I could be that kid.<br/>
      If one must create fiction from history imagine<br/>
all that <br/>
could be done, telling the tale of that young mans<br/>
life...<br/>

taken you just as much time to do a google search as<br/>
it would have to type your email. Zen Buddhism is an<br/>
EASY topic to find information on. If you were looking<br/>
for the specific quotes of a certain Zen cleric, or<br/>
opinions on how Zen relates to something else, I'm<br/>
sure no one would have an issue. But no one is going<br/>
to just hand you everything--if you want to know about<br/>
something as general as Zen, you need to look yourself<br/>
before you start asking. <br/>

Not trying to sound too harsh, but in the end it saves<br/>
everyone involved time and frustration.<br/>

Hi Josh -  A good start might be D.T. Suzuki's  "Zen and <br/>
Japanese Culture" and Eugen Herrigel's "Zen in the Art of <br/>
Archery". Both books are a bit old but regarded as classics. You <br/>
might also want to check out Philip Kapleau's "Three Pillers of <br/>
Zen" which is a much beloved primer in the West.<br/>
<br/>
If you live near an urban area, you might want to check and see if <br/>
there is a Japanese tea ceremony group in town. Personally, I <br/>
think you might get a deeper understanding of Zen by practicing <br/>
chado - i.e., The Way (do) of Tea (cha) than simply reading a <br/>
book on it..<br/>
<br/>
In "Zen and Japanese Culture", Suzuki  - in addition to such <br/>
chapters as "Zen and the Samurai", "Zen and Swordmanship" - <br/>
has two chapters devoted to Zen and the Art of Tea and also a <br/>
separate chapter on "Sen no Rikyu"  the legendary Sengoku-jidai <br/>
tea master. The Japanese film director, Teshigahara Hiroshi's <br/>
critically acclaimed movie "Rikyu" is based on the relationship <br/>
between Sen no Rikyu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! It's impossible to get into this "stuff" without a good <br/>
grounding in Zen, isn't it? :-)<br/>

  These books are decent starters but bear in mind the agendas of writers. <br/>
Herrigel went to Japan in search of mysticism and zen. Zen has very little <br/>
to do with Kyudo. As a book on zen it's ok, but don't fall into the "zen <br/>

Hi Michael - I think there might be  quite a few Japanese <br/>
practitioners who would disagree with you a bit. As a student in <br/>
Tokyo back in the early 80's I once attended a kyudo and kendo <br/>
demonstration at Yasukuni-jinja which was followed by a   <br/>
lecture  on the philosophical underpinnings of kyudo, kendo, <br/>
chado, etc.  by Nakamura Hajime (whose authority in Japan on <br/>
this subject is unquestioned). Nakamura-sensei (Toyo Bunka <br/>
Kenkyu-jo, Tokyo Daigaku) described the relationship between <br/>
kyudo-Zen, kendo-Zen, etc as being co-terminus. It seems that <br/>
you practice kyudo, desho? Wouldn't you say that the "goal" of <br/>
kyudo lies in the "cultivation" of "mushin", "munen"? These are <br/>
central Zen terms ... In fact, as you well know, the suffix "do" (kyu-<br/>
do) is a translation of the Sanskrit term "marga" which means <br/>
the "path to enlightenment". Also, the training halls of kyudo, <br/>
kendo, etc is called "dojo" which is translation of "bodhimanda" <br/>
(the site where Buddhas attain enlightenment ...<br/>
<br/>
A  member of our tea ceremony group in Tokyo back in the day <br/>
who was studying kyudo once asked our tea sensei about the <br/>
relationship between tea and kyudo. He answered, " Onaji desu <br/>
- Mattaku onaji". I think if you contacted a judan kyudo sensei, he <br/>
would probably answer the same way if asked about the <br/>
relationship between Zen and kyudo...<br/>
<br/>
This might irritate you a bit but it is intended with a bit of humor <br/>
and certainly much love: You wrote "bear in mind the agendas of <br/>
writers". The goal in Zen is to abandon all agendas. I think if a <br/>
person has an "agenda", he or she might  certainly learn - and <br/>
learn well -  the mechanics of a Japanese martial arts. However, <br/>
there is a point beyond where no progress is possible until <br/>
"agendas" are abandoned..<br/>
<br/>
Still working on my own agendas,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He might. However, the point he was trying to make, if<br/>
I'm correct, is that not everything in Japanese<br/>
culture/life is imbued with Zen, nor is everything in<br/>
Japanese history. Zen is a part of, but not the<br/>
entirety. Sometimes a duck is just a duck. Zen is a<br/>
small percentage of active Buddhist adherents in<br/>
Japan. Unfortunately, it receives so much print and<br/>
press that many people believe that all Japanese sit<br/>
and listen to the rocks grow, or harken to hear the<br/>
sound of one hand clapping. This is far from the<br/>
truth. Neither must one be a strict adherent of Zen<br/>
Buddhism to practice Kendo or Kyudo. Yes, the<br/>
philosophy is part of the practice, but they are not<br/>
one and the same. Do I have to renounce my<br/>
Christianity in order to pick up a shinai? I think<br/>
not. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>However, the writers mentioned certainly have a<br/>
Zen-biased agenda. That's not a criticism, but an<br/>
observation. Their purpose is to promote their image<br/>
of Zen. <br/>
<br/>
To me, it is JUST as unfortunate for people to be led<br/>
to the misperception that all Japanese practice tea<br/>
ceremony and kendo in some sort of mystical Zen quest<br/>
as it is for them to think that all samurai followed<br/>
bushido and committed seppuku if they coughed wrong.<br/>
While Zen captures the Western imagination, even<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu didn't belong to the Zen sect--he was<br/>
a follower of Jodo-shuu. Most samurai didn't study<br/>
kenjutsu in preparation for some musha-shugyo where<br/>
they found spiritual enlightenment, they did it so<br/>
they could kill and keep from being killed on the<br/>
battlefield. While Kyudo may have developed as a means<br/>
to putting Zen principles into practice, kyujutsu was<br/>
developed as a means of putting an arrow into your<br/>
enemy. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless, I hope the young person who started all<br/>
this is happy--with no effort on his part, we've given<br/>
him a lot to think about.<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Re: hey/Zen</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-734650649">Yes, I am a practitioner. Currently shodan, my nidan test is in November. As <br/>
I said there IS overlap. Some Zen practitioners use Kyudo as a tool for <br/>
spiritual development. In these cases Kyudo is no different than use of any <br/>
other koan.<br/>
  However, this is not the WAY. As put down in the writings of <br/>
Inagaki-sensei. Kokoro no Yumi is not zen although it does share some <br/>
aspects. Nate phrased it well when he mentioned what a small percentage of <br/>
Japanese follow Zen precepts. Do a search on Herrigel It has pretty much <br/>
been concluded that there were huge misunderstandings between him and his <br/>
teacher ( a man who was a laughingstock among the Kyudo community). In Kyudo <br/>
and kendo, there are serious mental/spiritual issues to deal with once <br/>
technique has been conquered, but cloaking things in mysticism is a disguise <br/>
for teachers who don't understand the core of thier arts.<br/>
<br/>
  Don't get me wrong I have respect for Zen practitioners. A friend of mine <br/>
from Spain who was doing Kyudo for spiritual aspects left to begin Chado <br/>
about 6 months ago. However, Zen doesn't permeate the air you breathe in <br/>
Japan, or even the air in dojo.<br/>
<br/>
This links in to some of my thoughts recently about why I love japanese <br/>
culture so much. When we are young we believe in magic. As we age we <br/>
discover there is no Santa Claus, no Easter bunny, no magic. Some people <br/>
turn to religion. Others to mysticism. When I was a teenager, I was one of <br/>
those wannabe ninja/samurai. (The ones who drive Tony and myself insane with <br/>
thier "facts")I believed in the mystic. I am fortunate in that when I <br/>
discovered it's smoke, mirrors and physics, I had already learned about <br/>
other interesting aspects of the culture.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] hey</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-786964378">Hi there! Zen buddhism was popularized in japan by the bushi, and became the basis of bushi-do.<br/>
What I heard was that a famous warrior who used a Bo-staff fled Japan in the 8th century a.d. for some unknown reason, perhaps he was being sought after by rivals of his dead lord or something like that.<br/>
At any rate this warrior went to china, where he met up with the shaolin monks, who were buddhists. Influenced by the Chinese philosophies of taoism and confucianism and impressed by the buddhist sharma of the shaolin, the warrior became the first zen-buddhist.<br/>
After a time the warrior was forgotten by his enemies and he returned to Japan. Now the faith of Japan at the time was and is still called "Shinto", shinto is the nature and ancestor worship practised by the ancient Japanese, who claim that the islandsof Honshu was in fact the body of a dead goddess, and that Kami or spirits live in the wild places of Japan.<br/>
This warrior-monk incorporated Shinto with the Buddhist/Taoists beliefs of the Chinese to form Zen-buddhism.<br/>
As the buddhists believe in re-incarnation and a progressive pattern of good/positive actions that lead to a better re-incarnation in a future life, Zen was quickly adopted by the bushi. Men who were to die valiantly in their lord's service need not fear death, as they would re-incarnate further along the path of Insamsara, the cycle of living and dying.<br/>
Zen is considered to be an austere and disciplined form of buddhism, perfect for the serious minded bushi, and incorporated many of the principles of taoism (ying and yang) and confuscist thought.<br/>
Zen teachers often use parables to impart their teachings to their students. For example one teacher wrote: " Before studying Zen, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers. During the studying, mountains are no longer mountains and rivers are no longer rivers. After having mastered Zen, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers."<br/>
Self-lessness, ego suppression, calmness of thought, sense of purpose; these were the goals of Zen students. Hope I answered some of your questions.<br/>
You might want to read...Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, The book of five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi, the art of war by Sun Tzu, and also the Dharma.<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
This might sound a little strange, but there is nowhere else i can found the answer.<br/>
<br/>
I want to buy a katana, i been saving some time ago, but i live in mexico, and cannot find a place, or information about it<br/>
<br/>
I'm not looking for an ancient sword, it has not to be old, but it has to be a good blade, manufactured in the traditional style, with the caracteristical resilience and sharpness that made it legendary<br/>
<br/>
You may wonder why and what for i want such a weapon, is a gift, a gift for my newborn son.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>

i know the perfect spot and that is www.samuraihistory.com then go to swords it will have a bunch but you can find what you are looking for and it has the price right beside the sword.   <br/>

were there,too. I sometimes miss those days but I wouldn't trade them for my <br/>

Unfortunately, I do feel some of the softer edges are suffering abrasion and <br/>
getting a bit sharper for me... I do have trouble with some of the more obvious <br/>
questions (doesn't anyone know how to use encyclopedia or search engines <br/>
anymore? :) ).<br/>

<br/>
Bugei are fine but they are seriously over priced, any<br/>
of the paul chen stuff can be found anywhere cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
In the USA <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.888knivesrus.com">http://www.888knivesrus.com</a> are one of the<br/>
cheapest, in the UK I am a dealer myself.<br/>
<br/>
There is however still a international shortage o chen<br/>
swords, this has been mainly due to the Kill Bill and<br/>
Last Samurai movies.<br/>
