It was on NHK this week that the drama will be on<br/>
Maeda Toshie.  Filming starts in August.<br/>

make yet another sengoku period drama when so many other periods have been<br/>
left untouched, especially since they had that other drama about Maeda a few<br/>

    Not only the same period but the same people and events get recycled over<br/>

TV for too long...<br/>
