<h3>Konishi Yukinaga and Kiyomasa Kato</h3>
by <i>squrpio_prince</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-190760413">I have read that the two had a fierce rivalry mostly because of <br/>
religion .With their  armies the two raced toward Seol, the capital <br/>
of Korea, to see who could reach it first. Even though Konishi's navy <br/>
helped Kiyomasa, kiyomasa still hated him. After Konishi was killed <br/>
in Sekigahara Kiyomasa persecuted the christians there since Konishi <br/>
was Christian and Kato was Buddhist.<br/>
 <br/>
With the battles they fought who won?<br/>
Could anyone provide any information on the two, especialy Konishi?</div>
