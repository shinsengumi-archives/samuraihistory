 </span></blockquote>My condolences. I don't wish to sound callous, but<br/>
your feelings seem to be more directed at suicide in<br/>
general, rather than seppuku in particular. Again, you<br/>
don't have to be Japanese to commit suicide (as you<br/>
tragically are aware) and you don't have to commit<br/>
seppuku to be Japanese.<br/>
		Thank you.  You don't sound callous, you sound analytical.  Not a problem.<br/>
Say rather that my feelings have to do with suicide as a way out of one's<br/>
problems or a method of redemption.  Where there's room to fight, or cause<br/>
to live on (as in dependents who will suffer from one's death), I'd prefer<br/>
to make my life count for every scrap of advantage or any injury to my enemy<br/>
that it can be made to count for.  I can think of cases where suicide would<br/>
be a perfectly rational response:  e.g. terminal illness, impending capture<br/>
by forces known to treat prisoners badly (as noted by another party) (and<br/>
indeed, I understand that this was the way in which the custom of seppuku<br/>
originated).<br/>
<br/>
Of course I agree that "sticking it out" is much more<br/>
honorable than what many in the west call suicide,<br/>
"taking the easy way out". Even if that way is neither<br/>
easy nor pleasant.<br/>
		Indeed.  I may have made it seem my father's suicide was cowardly:  this I<br/>
do not believe, particularly given his deep Christian beliefs (to say<br/>
nothing of the merciless self-honesty of his last letter).  "Neither easy<br/>
nor pleasant" is pretty accurate.  From his own perspective, I think it was<br/>
more the scenario of "The English gentleman, his family's finances ruined by<br/>
injudicious investments, retires to his study with his Webley service<br/>
revolver."  But to come to terms with it myself, I came to regard it as his<br/>
version of seppuku.  I feel he could have done wiser things, but he faced a<br/>
very tough and painful decision squarely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >       Thank you for the corrections.  Is it also<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It may have been, I'm not sure. I know that a short<br/>
while before, Mishima made a movie where the pivotal<br/>
scene was a seppuku (performed by him), a sort of<br/>
foreshadowing, if you will. The scene was intensely<br/>
graphic, and if I believe correctly he actually did<br/>
cut himself (on accident this time). Copious amounts<br/>
of fake blood were used. This is third hand info, as<br/>
I've not seen the scene, and only had it described by<br/>
my Japanese lit teacher in college (a few years back).<br/>
The recreation of the recreation is recreated in the<br/>
biographical movie of his life.<br/>
		Rumour being what it is, it would not surprise me at all to learn that<br/>
this filmed episode gained the second-hand (or third- or fourth-) reputation<br/>
of being a film of his actual death.<br/>
 The poet<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > who wrote _The Narrow<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Matsuo Basho is the poet you're looking for.<br/>
		Damn, was that Basho?  I'd completely forgotten that.  That was the only<br/>
Japanese poet whose name I could remember, and I didn't think it was he.<br/>
And I<br/>
agree, I've got no desire to emulate Mishima.<br/>
Personally, he was a nutjob, out of touch with<br/>
reality, as was proven when he attempted to cause a<br/>
coup and even the students at Ichigaya laughed at him.<br/>
The books of his I've read are, well, disturbing.<br/>
Hardly my favorite author, much less someone who'd<br/>
make me want to be Japanese.<br/>
		Well, that was approximately what I was trying _not_ to say to the party<br/>
who admired him...<br/>
<br/>

tell!<br/>

<br/>
Just to elaborate a little, I think hara-kiri was somthing of a slag usage.<br/>
'Belly-slitting' is not a very dignified description, and I've seen some<br/>
people get quite offended at usage of the term for something they still<br/>
consider to be very important.<br/>
				In case it's me to whom you're responding here, that was very much the<br/>
point I was trying to make.  The crude terminology was a deliberate attempt<br/>
to translate the crudity of (my understanding of) the term 'hara-kiri.'<br/>
To be honest, this attitude is perfectly accepted in<br/>
the military today--I've had several discussions with<br/>
fellow army officers where we all said we'd save a<br/>
bullet in our 9mm for us, should the prospect of being<br/>
captured by the north Koreans (I was stationed twice<br/>
along the DMZ) in the event of a war. However, the key<br/>
here really isn't the prospect of dishonor--to any<br/>
decent enemy, I'd fight until I couldn't fight<br/>
anymore, and then surrender if there was nothing else<br/>
I could do. However, Charles Jenkins notwithstanding,<br/>
the nK doesn't have a great reputation for treatment<br/>
of enemy soldiers, as with most communist regimes.<br/>
				To be fair, this is hardly unique to Communist regimes.  (Vlad the<br/>
Impaler comes to mind, to say nothing of the Osmanli Turks from whom he got<br/>
his, er, education.)  And in the context of this list - that is to say,<br/>
dragging myself back to Japanese history, I have read that among the<br/>
Japanese it is regarded as disgraceful to be taken prisoner.  Both prisoners<br/>
and captors, as I recall, tended to perpetuate this view - to the extent<br/>
that captives not infrequently became partisans of their captors, seemingly<br/>
requiring a new 'identity' to replace that which was lost when they were<br/>
captured.  (This is echoed in Kurosawa's "Sanjuro," where the captive ends<br/>
up cheering at a victory before he recalls whose side he's supposed to be<br/>
on.)  Another example comes from WWII:  I believe it was on Mindanao where<br/>
much of the civilian Japanese population chose to go off a cliff with their<br/>
children rather than be taken by the Americans.  Even if this view of being<br/>
taken alive is not correct - and I can't recall my sources - there are<br/>
enough instances of horrific and humiliating executions of important<br/>
prisoners in Japanese history that I can definitely sympathise with anyone<br/>
of significance who preferred not to be taken alive.<br/>
	And even in feudal Europe, for all the modern popular ideas of the<br/>
chivalric ideal, if you wanted to be taken alive in battle, you'd better<br/>
make certain to have been born with gentle blood in your veins:  the Lower<br/>
Classes (that'd be most of us) were rarely treated well.  For that matter,<br/>
the Italians didn't care how well-bred you were:  they didn't like taking<br/>
prisoners, and they didn't respect class.  Consequence of being a nation of<br/>
city-states, I gather, as opposed to a feudal monarchy.<br/>
I<br/>
admire men like John McCain quite a lot, but I'd be<br/>
sorely tempted to let my wife collect on my insurance<br/>
rather than face captivity under those conditions.<br/>
				But with all those provisos and exceptions, I'm with you on this one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another question--where the heck does this "Digest<br/>
Number XXX" stuff come from? That wasn't the original<br/>
title of this thread.<br/>
				No, but I receive the list in digest form:  so I got it all at once, and<br/>
responded in kind.  My apologies for any confusion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I personally have never heard of this. From a practical point of view<br/>
it seems like it would be next to impossible to carry off. Plus it<br/>
seems like it's confusing things a bit. If this is the seppuku done<br/>
on the battlefield, it's not always clear that there would be a<br/>
kaishaku-nin there to cut off the head. If it is the more formal<br/>
seppuku ceremony, then of course there would be no need to make such<br/>
a distinction -- and in fact the head viewing ceremony took place<br/>
at a relatively far distance from the body.<br/>
				For what it's worth, I've heard of this... but (surprise!) I do not<br/>
recall the source.  I can certainly see how the solemnity of the occasion<br/>
would be marred by the head rolling across the tatami.  I also think that<br/>
with decent practise, it would not be that difficult to 'pull' the cut so as<br/>
not to completely sever the neck.  Not to sound boastful, but I think with a<br/>
few months' practise I could duplicate that precision - at least, on a<br/>
target that would remain stationary for the purpose.  (You will understand<br/>
that my cutting practise does not generally focus on this detail - a<br/>
grievous oversight in my training, I grant you.  I humbly crave your pardon,<br/>
one and all.  My school focusses more on battlefield technique than on the<br/>
stylish execution of seppuku.)<br/>
Thank you all once again for a spirited and informative multilogue.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup, that was him. I haven't read it, so I just know<br/>
he wrote it, and the only other thing I remember about<br/>
him is that he wrote the "frog/pond" haiku that is so<br/>
often quoted. That, and he seems to be the "George<br/>
Washington" of Japan, in the sense that there seems to<br/>
be a "Matsuo Basho slept here" sign in every corner of<br/>
the country.<br/>

aside from his literary talent, that's how many<br/>
Japanese see him to, so it's not just Nate here. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My favorite Japanese author--modern work, not anything<br/>
to do with samurai or anything, though I think a<br/>
historical wourk by him would be absolutely hilarious.<br/>
Ranges from absurdist ("A Wild Sheep's Chase", "Dance<br/>
Dance Dance", "Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of<br/>
th World") to the poignant mid-life crisis tale with<br/>
just a touch of the absurd (The Wind-up Bird<br/>
Chronicle, Norwegian Wood, South of the Border, West<br/>
of the Sun, Sputnik Sweetheart...) <br/>
<br/>
"South of the Border, West of the Sun" rivals Miyabe<br/>
Miyuki's "All She was worth" for my favorite book of<br/>
all time. <br/>

once.  Notice I said nothing about FINISHING it.  As for Mishima, I've got one of <br/>
his books -- although where it is and what it's called both escape me at the <br/>
moment -- but I haven't read it yet.  I've got a book called The Master of Go <br/>
by Kawabata Yasunari, who, I believe, was a contemporary and friend of <br/>
Mishima's although what I've read says the two could not have been more dissimilar in <br/>
their personalities.  I have started it, but never finished it.  One of those <br/>
books where one says "Huh?" and not in a good way, although I may give it <br/>
another try and I suppose my attitude will change about it, but I wouldn't count <br/>
on it.<br/>
