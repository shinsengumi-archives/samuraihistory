<h3>Samurai status - Sengoku</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544475985">Two phrases sum up the Sengoku era:<br/>
<br/>
gekokuji  "the low overthrow the high"<br/>
jakuniku kyoshoku  "the weak become meat; the strong eat."<br/>
<br/>
In the wake of the Onin Wars, everything was up for grabs.<br/>
<br/>
I would hazard a guess that anyone who could lay hands on a sword and<br/>
defend himself might declare himself samurai, but once order begins to<br/>
emerge from the chaos, it's natural that the strong sought the means<br/>
to make sure that no-one else achieved what they did, to limit by<br/>
whatever means the aspirations of those below them.<br/>
<br/>
The promulgation of house codes, etc, all point at this, but they all<br/>
imply an authority which I would guess was not quite as extensive as<br/>
the author would like to think. Thus we have, in retrospect, the idea<br/>
of strictly delineated class boundaries, but I suggest the actuality<br/>
was a lot more fluid.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest that Hideyoshi's edicts, for example, was to some<br/>
degree inspired by his desire to prevent the emergence of another<br/>
Hideyoshi. On the other hand, Hideyoshi elevated non-samurai to<br/>
samurai status, as has been mentioned. Ieyasu did likewise. Who was<br/>
going to stop them?<br/>
<br/>
The one abiding fact seems to me that a samurai's survival depended on<br/>
his ability to sustain and defend himself, and then later, it depended<br/>
upon the grace and favour of his superiors. Only then did the status<br/>
become seriously fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Another view is that some samurai formed democratic councils with<br/>
farmers and artisans, exchanging services for food and goods, and all<br/>
having a say in the affaris of the han. This proto-democracy was<br/>
quickly stamped out as the larger daimyates subsumed the lower.<br/>
