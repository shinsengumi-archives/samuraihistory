<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022949835">Hi Group,<br/>
        In getting information on the Sammurai or Japanese history I suggest you read the James Clavell novel- Shogun. If you can get it,I believe they have the mini series Shogun , which starred Richard Chamberlain, on video. Clavell's novel- Gai-Jin may also be of use to you in your report. <br/>
       Being a Martial Artist, I found Clavell's entire Asian series enjoable. The novels in this series are: Shogun, Tai-Pan, King Rat, Noble House, Whirlwind and Gai-Jin.<br/>
       Write back and keep in touch. This is one of my favorite topics; the Orient as always been one of my areas of interest.<br/>
