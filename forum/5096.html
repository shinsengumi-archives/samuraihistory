<h3>takezaki suenaga and his mongol invasion scroll</h3>
by <i>samurai_dokoro</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404237300">was it really true that, as the scroll depicts, takezaki suenaga(the samurai who commissioned the scroll as an offering to his family shrine) had his horse shot under him while leading a charge against the mongol troops on the beach? or perhaps his horse was just stunned by the fireball missiles the invaders hurled against suenaga?<br/>
