Women Warriors<br/>
<br/>
A romanticised image of the Samurai as a fanatically loyal warrior with a <br/>
sword has come to represent Japan in the west. The samurai rose to <br/>
predominance during the late Heian and the Kamakura periods. It was the <br/>
Gempei war between two great provincial clans (the Taira and the Minamoto) <br/>
which resulted in the establishment of an hereditary Shogunate, and defined <br/>
the medieval era. In the war, women participated in political, economic and <br/>
not least, military roles. Standing beside many of the great men was an <br/>
equally great woman, but their stories are often documented unreliably (if <br/>
at all), and rarely filter through to English language sources. What was <br/>
women�s role in establishing the supremacy of the Samurai and how did their <br/>
position change? Discussed with particular emphasis on the martial sphere.<br/>
<br/>
Japan is often thought of as a strong patriarchy with a tradition of <br/>
oppression of women. Even today there are many areas of unresolved <br/>
discrimination against women. Japanese history centers on the deeds of <br/>
heroic warriors, and the Samurai is perhaps the most widely recognized <br/>
symbol of Japan internationally. Women, however, were not necessarily always <br/>
kept indoors practicing flower arranging. Alongside some of the most <br/>
legendary warriors fought women. Before the entrenching of the Shogunate and <br/>
Samurai dominated feudalism, women were soldiers, generals, strategists, <br/>
judges, Empresses and even Regent Shogun. Women contributed significantly to <br/>
establishing the social structure which would come to repress them.<br/>
<br/>
There was a significant change in the role of Japanese women over the Heian, <br/>
Kamakura and Muromachi eras as society moved from a matriarchal influence to <br/>
a patriarchal structure. Representative of this change was the social <br/>
upheaval around the Gempei war of the late twelfth century, and that period <br/>
is the focus of this paper. Were the women warriors of the period acting <br/>
according to ancient matriarchal principles in an attempt to maintain old <br/>
traditions in a period of chaotic change? Were they trying to enter a male <br/>
world upon the collapse of the old order with its certainties and clearly <br/>
defined roles? Or were they fighting because in an all out war every hand is <br/>
needed? What reasons may there be for these women either to be largely <br/>
ignored in standard historical accounts or for their histories to be turned <br/>
into myth? In seeking answers to these questions there will be an overview <br/>
of conditions extant in the period under consideration and the lives and <br/>
activities of a range of female protagonists who were active players during <br/>
the period will be examined.<br/>
<br/>
Before discussing these women's lives, the deeds for which they are <br/>
remembered and the background of the wars in which they fought, there is a <br/>
wider historical context which must be addressed: the status of women. The <br/>
twelfth and thirteenth centuries were turbulent times of great changes in <br/>
Japan, seeing the rise of the Samurai, Shogunate and warrior ethics and the <br/>
diminishment of the leisurely court life devoted to the arts for which the <br/>
Heian period is best known.  Not surprisingly, this was also an era of <br/>
significant change for women.  The status of women decreased rapidly through <br/>
this era into the oppression of the Sengoku and Edo (or Tokugawa) periods.  <br/>
It is the laws of those later years which people generally seem to associate <br/>
with Japan, projecting women�s status from those eras back to earlier times. <br/>
In fact, in the opening centuries of the CE the regions which then composed <br/>
Japan were under matriarchal rule (although possibly much earlier also, this <br/>
is the date from which Chinese written records provide primary evidence) . <br/>
This tradition was so strong that when a man inherited rule a bloody civil <br/>
war broke out, appeased only when a woman assumed the throne .  Skipping <br/>
1400 years, by the age of Sengoku Turnbull writes that there was no <br/>
equivalent to Tomoe, nor �any woman remotely approaching the status of <br/>
Masako� .  In contrast, Sengoku women were treated as objects, useful only <br/>
for seiryaku kekkon, political alliance marriages .  He goes on to give <br/>
often graphic examples of the negative treatment of Sengoku women.  The <br/>
period with which we are concerned is set between these extremes. Although <br/>
active in many areas, women were moving increasingly to the periphery of <br/>
society.<br/>
<br/>
With the rise of the Samurai and Bushido warrior ideology, women�s status <br/>
declined, and the intellectual women�s networks disappeared . However useful <br/>
women may have been on the battlefield they were still inferior. Although <br/>
Tomoe was among his last seven defenders, when the time came for him to die, <br/>
a man asks her �how would Yoshinaka be shamed if in his last fight he died <br/>
with a woman?� and sends her away . However, as Bingham and Gross point out, <br/>
�In a curious way�bushido created a parallel ideal for Japanese women of the <br/>
Samurai class� .  It is no coincidence that the legendary women of this <br/>
period were themselves warriors or military strategists. War was <br/>
all-important.<br/>
<br/>
In the lower classes gender was a less significant issue. Women worked <br/>
alongside men, inherited property and had property rights in divorces, which <br/>
were easily obtained .  After the mid-seventh century Confucian style Taika <br/>
reforms, �women were barred from becoming government officials, and a <br/>
women�s share of government-distributed land (kubunden) was set at <br/>
two-thirds of that for a man� . Despite this women in rural areas were <br/>
somewhat better off; if necessary they could hold the office of steward, <br/>
which in some areas was the highest local authority, and entailed tax <br/>
collecting, providing military services, and carrying out all law and also <br/>
infrastructure .<br/>
<br/>
Marriage had traditionally centered on women, with the husband joining her <br/>
family and daughters inheriting and having income rights . Although this <br/>
system continued in the lower classes until the nineteenth century, the <br/>
Samurai (increasingly and eventually exclusively) adopted the ie, an <br/>
exclusively patrilineal, primogenitural and hierarchical family structure .<br/>
<br/>
Although �Japanese women have traditionally had an unusually prominent role <br/>
in dealing with the supernatural� , Japan: An illustrated Encyclopedia <br/>
attributes the decline in women�s status to Confucianism, Buddhism and the <br/>
economic changes brought about by protracted warfare, which cause <br/>
primogeniture to be safer . How did the different religions affect women�s <br/>
status?<br/>
Religious beliefs may be assumed to have a significant influence over social <br/>
morality and values, including gender relations.  In the �native� religion <br/>
of Shintoism the first-born god is in fact a goddess, Amateratsu.  As the <br/>
eldest she inherited the earth and sent her grandson to rule Japan, giving <br/>
him the three items of the Imperial Regalia .  Thus members of the Japanese <br/>
Imperial Family are her descendants, and she is Japan�s principal deity.  <br/>
The best evidence for a positive Shinto attitude towards gender equality was <br/>
the existence of �female shamans who acted as powerful religious and <br/>
political leaders� .  The negative side however is the strong focus on <br/>
pollution, which excludes women from certain places and ceremonies because <br/>
of their �unclean� reproductive processes .<br/>
<br/>
In the early sixth century CE Buddhism was brought to Japan from Korea , and <br/>
became a major religion.  Because of the many different sects and <br/>
interpretations, Buddhism presented a more mixed view of women.  On the one <br/>
hand, Buddhist convents provided a refuge for women whose status had been <br/>
removed or who were seeking divorce; an outlet for charitable works, <br/>
learning, and leadership roles, and women even founded temples . On the <br/>
other hand, although some sects preached equality others focused again on <br/>
pollution or on female specific sins, elements which prevented female <br/>
enlightenment until they were reborn as men .<br/>
<br/>
Although Confucianism arrived in Japan from China at around the same time as <br/>
Buddhism, it did not become a dominant philosophy until much later , its <br/>
rise accompanying that of the Samurai.  According to Bingham and Gross, in <br/>
Japan �Confucianism seems to have been entirely negative for women� , <br/>
although they contradictorily discuss some benefits.  For example, in return <br/>
for her obedience, a woman could expect her male relatives to safeguard her <br/>
welfare; in old age she would be looked after; and as the mother of sons her <br/>
power within the family could increase . The price was severely reduced <br/>
independence, expressed through the Triple Obedience Doctrine.  This <br/>
prescribes that a woman should always be under the control of a male <br/>
relative (father, brother/husband, son) .  In addition, a new bride was <br/>
totally subservient to her mother-in-law, a system which caused centuries of <br/>
misery .  It is from Confusion philosophy that a plethora of very sexist <br/>
proverbs stem, and which promoted the idea that husband and wife not display <br/>
public affection for each other .  The impact of these attitudes is clear in <br/>
law and in the Tokugawa �house rules.�<br/>
<br/>
To take a closer look at some specific Samurai traditions, a philosophy now <br/>
associated deeply with Japan in general and Samurai in particular is Zen. <br/>
Its focus on austerity and, simplistically put, voidness, appealed to the <br/>
Samurai and became an important philosophical source in notions of <br/>
self-destruction.  In a philosophy that came to have such strong association <br/>
with warriors, it is interesting that a woman played an important role in <br/>
its early years in Japan.  Mugai Nyodai lived for most of the thirteenth <br/>
century , and rarely for a non-literary Japanese woman, is know in her own <br/>
right, rather than by her association with a man (in fact, her father and <br/>
husband are unknown) .  Although married to a Hojo, for some reason she <br/>
began to study Zen under Mugaku Sogen, a Chinese priest who had been invited <br/>
to Japan in 1279 to head a temple .  She became his star pupil, and he <br/>
acknowledged her as the heir to his teachings, giving her the character Mu <br/>
from his own name . Mugai was the first women in Japan �fully qualified not <br/>
as a nun but as a Zen priest (Zen so)� . She founded a network of temples <br/>
and convents, and served as Abbess of them .<br/>
The overarching philosophy of the Samurai was Bushido, and it is symbiotic <br/>
with martial training. How then did it apply to women? Nitobe Inazo�s text <br/>
�Bushido� on Samurai ethics first appeared in bookshops in 1900 .  It reads <br/>
very strongly as an attempt to justify Bushido and Japanese culture to <br/>
Christians and Europeans. �Bushido� contains an entire chapter on women,  <br/>
and it is largely concerned with arguing that Japanese women are just as <br/>
chaste and feminine/domestic as their Western counterparts.  Before this <br/>
however Inazo makes a revealing comment: �While the Samurai went on <br/>
practising and extolling martial traits�they went so far as to tinge the <br/>
ideals of womanhood with Amazonian character� .  His description of the <br/>
education of young girls� demonstrates many similarities to that of young <br/>
boys.  They �were trained to repress their feelings, to indurate their <br/>
nerves, to manipulate weapons�  and how to commit suicide .  Bushido most <br/>
valued women who �displayed a heroic fortitude worthy of the strongest and <br/>
the bravest of men� .  Inazo refers to the triple-obedience doctrine, <br/>
linking it to self-sacrifice and suicide with numerous examples .  Woman <br/>
annihilates herself for man, and he for his master .  Thus women have the <br/>
same moral duty as men, but directed by gender, not status.  Also woman were <br/>
thought to provide naijo, inner help, as their primary duty .  The examples <br/>
of many warrior women clearly indicate that a woman�s help was not <br/>
restricted to naijo � if it seemed necessary her martial training could be <br/>
put to immediate use.<br/>
<br/>
According to Tyler most Samurai class women received instruction in the <br/>
martial arts . Amdur points out that in the early days of the Samurai, women <br/>
were pioneers in dangerous new lands, where martial skills were extremely <br/>
necessary . Salmondson claims that every Samurai woman was expected to <br/>
master the naginata (see below) by the time she was eighteen . In fact, she <br/>
argues that Samurai women were vital to defense and offence throughout the <br/>
medieval era . To quote Ribner and Chin:<br/>
�As part of their position, the Samurai women were expected to be as <br/>
excellent with weapons as the Samurai men of their families. Starting when <br/>
they were young girls, they were taught how to use several traditional <br/>
weapons- the straight spear, the dagger, and, of course, the naginata. This <br/>
long weapon was usually hung over the doors of every Samurai household, and <br/>
women were expected to protect their homes with it if necessary. More than <br/>
this, women were sometimes important warriors in their own right, commanding <br/>
large numbers of men in huge battles� .<br/>
A naginata is a curved sword blade attached to a spear, is between five and <br/>
nine feet long  and was especially used by women and priests . There were <br/>
other weapons which were particularly favored for women also. The bow was <br/>
useful for defending the home at long distances, such as from the roof ; a <br/>
small dagger was always carried in case suicide became necessary ; and <br/>
finally the kusari-gama, which resembles a cycle with a weighted chain  and <br/>
is useful against a sword and in close quarters. This shows that although <br/>
their presence on a battlefield was unusual (as is shown by Hatakeyama�s <br/>
surprise at seeing Tomoe) women were actually expected to possess martial <br/>
skills. Samurai women maintained these skills until modernization (see <br/>
below).<br/>
<br/>
Without a doubt, Tome Gozen is the most famous of Japan�s women warriors. <br/>
There are two primary sources relating to Tomoe: The Heike Monogatari and <br/>
the Gempei Josui Ki. Sadly the only English translation I could obtain of <br/>
the Heike Monogatari is abridged and much (although not all) of Tomoe's <br/>
story has been left out, and no translation of the other is available, so <br/>
these works are only accessed through secondary authors. Tyler is a <br/>
particularly valuable source since his translations are his own. Tyler <br/>
cautions that the story of Tomoe has been much embroidered, and therefore <br/>
not all of the story which is to follow can be considered historical truth. <br/>
In the majority it comes, however, from primary sources. Tomoe fought with <br/>
Yoshinaka Minamoto. Tomoe is described as a horse-breaker who rode <br/>
fearlessly on the roughest ground; her handling of bow and sword a match for <br/>
a thousand warriors; she had won matchless renown in many battles against <br/>
the bravest captains; in short, she was "fit to meet either god or devil" . <br/>
Other descriptions add that she had commanded large forces ; including that <br/>
she was �commander of Minamoto forces in the earlier phases of the <br/>
Taira-Minamoto war�  and that her fierce horse kicked up so much snow that <br/>
the Taira thought they were facing a dozen men . As Yoshinaka retreated from <br/>
Kyoto with Yoshitsune in pursuit, Tomoe escaped injury through several <br/>
fierce battles , and in the "last fight, when all the others had been slain <br/>
or had fled, among the last seven there rode Tomoe" . It is for these last <br/>
skirmishes that she is famous.<br/>
<br/>
After a disastrous engagement with Yoshitsune, Yoshinaka and his forces rode <br/>
to meet Imai Kanehira who was commanding forces in Seta . They were pursued <br/>
along the way until, as the quote says, only seven accompanied the <br/>
dishonorably fleeing Yoshinaka . According to The Gempei Josui Ki, the head <br/>
of the force pursuing them was Hatakeyama, who was puzzled to see a <br/>
formidable warrior he did not recognize . Upon being informed that she was <br/>
Tomoe, a women, he appears to have been somewhat at a loss how to handle the <br/>
situation . He eventually decided to engage her in single combat, in the <br/>
process concluded that she must be a demon, and as a result retreated . A <br/>
little later the band of seven encountered around thirty-five riders, led by <br/>
Uchida, who despite being afraid of Tomoe had orders from Yoritomo to <br/>
capture her alive . This did not prevent him from trying to behead her, but <br/>
she returned the favor and presented the head to Yoshinaka, who was <br/>
profoundly unenthusiastic . He commanded her to leave so that dying with a <br/>
woman would not disgrace him, and sent her to inform his wife of what had <br/>
happened . The Heike Monogatari differs slightly, placing Tomoe's duel after <br/>
she has been ordered to leave, and she searches out a commander to fight to <br/>
prove her worth to Yoshinaka . Any number of naginata schools have claimed <br/>
her as their founder , despite the fact that she is described as using a <br/>
sword, bow and dagger, but not a naginata.<br/>
<br/>
There in a Noh play titled Tomoe which "is the only nibamme-mono <br/>
[warrior-genre] in which the shite (main character) is a woman" . In the <br/>
play the cowardliness the chronicles describe in Yoshinaka is ignored; in <br/>
fact he has been deified . Tomoe on the other hand is a ghost tainted by her <br/>
bitterness at his refusal to allow her to die with him . Thus although it <br/>
pays tribute to Tomoe's valor, "she is stained and, in an important sense, <br/>
humbled. In this manner the play restores proper harmony" . So although <br/>
Tomoe captured the popular imagination, it was inconceivable that a woman <br/>
could display more honor than a man, particularly a great General such as <br/>
Yoshinaka. Heroic warrior though she was, she was not worthy spiritually to <br/>
die with her lord as any male retainer could have done. Yoshinaka needed her <br/>
help but seems to have been uncomfortable about it.<br/>
<br/>
Tomoe was not, by any means, the only woman to fight in the Gempei war and <br/>
the surrounding years; it is the great number who did, in fact, which led to <br/>
my choice of this period. She is the best documented however, and warnings <br/>
about unreliability must be emphasized even further for the other women <br/>
discussed below. Tomoe was not the only woman to ride with Yoshinaka. <br/>
Another female commander was Aoi, who had however been killed before the <br/>
escape from Kyoto . It is interesting that most women warriors fought on the <br/>
side which lost. Perhaps the desperation of their side�s situation allowed <br/>
them to put their skills to the test.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side was Yoshitsune's mistress Shizuka Gozen, who did use a <br/>
naginata and to good effect, notably in the defense of Horikawa palace in <br/>
1185 . Shizuka was a very famous Shirabyoshi dancer, a style in which the <br/>
dancer dresses as a man . Her defiance after her capture by Yoritomo, <br/>
despite her pregnancy, is one of the most romantic episodes in the <br/>
thoroughly romanticized story of Yoshitsune, and two Noh plays Yoshino <br/>
Shizuka and Futari Shizuka retell the tale . After her interrogation she was <br/>
ordered to dance for Yoritomo and some of his favored vassals . She <br/>
accompanied the dance with a song in praise of Yoshitsune and longing for <br/>
their happy days to return, a deliberate insult to Yoritomo and a <br/>
potentially fatal act of defiance . Her life was spared allegedly because of <br/>
the intercession of Yoritomo�s wife and daughter , but her son was killed at <br/>
birth and she died a year later . Her decision to face death and remain <br/>
loyal to her lord exemplifies Samurai ethos.<br/>
<br/>
When faced with a rebellion in 1221, Masako Hojo over-rode her brother's <br/>
defensive plan to enforce her own aggressive tactical decisions, which <br/>
resulted in total victory . The fact that the army supported a female <br/>
General over a male one again indicates that in times of crisis martial <br/>
ability was more important than gender. Early in his career Masako�s husband <br/>
Yoritomo had his life saved by Ike Gozen, a Zen nun, warrior, and Fujiwara . <br/>
The famed first Shogun (in the modern sense) seems to have been surrounded <br/>
by strong women.<br/>
<br/>
Women attempted feats their male counterparts would not, caused desperation <br/>
among their enemies and did their duty as warriors even when death was <br/>
certain. At the battle of lake Biwa a woman named Koman saved the Minamoto <br/>
banner from the Taira, swimming to shore with it in her teeth as arrows <br/>
rained about her . In a battle between Yoshinaka and the Taira, a woman <br/>
named Hangaku, daughter of Moritsuna, earned renown, and even more so in <br/>
1201 when she defended her father's stockade with bow and naginata . <br/>
According to Jones, the enemy so despaired of felling her that they resorted <br/>
to shooting her in the back, "a very un-Samurai act" . The wife of Kajiwara <br/>
Genda Kagesuya, Fujinoye, defended Takadachi Castle in 1189 and killed two <br/>
famous warriors, Yemeto Juro and Nagasawa Uyemen-taro in a duel . A naginata <br/>
master named Itagaki was a female Taira general who commanded three thousand <br/>
soldiers in a suicide charge against ten thousand Hojo in 1199, an act which <br/>
has remained inspirational and maintained respect for her . Han Gaku fought <br/>
in around 1200 (unsuccessfully) against the Kamakura Shogunate . She was <br/>
sentenced to execution but saved when an enemy Samurai asked to marry her , <br/>
showing that martial valor did not lead the women to be perceived as <br/>
masculine.<br/>
<br/>
Many Taira women also fought in the sea battle that decimated their clan. <br/>
The number adds credence to the suggestion that women fought most in <br/>
situations where there was the least hope of victory and survival. An <br/>
interesting detail of the history of that battle is that in possibly its <br/>
most famous incident, where a Minamoto archer shoot down a fan bearing a <br/>
design of a red sun on white field (the origin of the national flag) , is <br/>
that the fan was hung by a teenaged girl in hakama , the split skirt still <br/>
worn by martial artists. More actively involved was Tamaori Hime, Atsumori's <br/>
wife, who fought on the beach with a naginata . Tenji-no-tsubone fought with <br/>
Sagami Goro  and Mochimitsu's mistress Sasaraye also fought; she is depicted <br/>
somewhat tragically in prints, wielding a naginata on a sinking ship . <br/>
Salmondson claims that others fought but with somewhat less convincing <br/>
evidence than she presents for the above cases.<br/>
<br/>
It may be observed that many of the warrior women discussed bare the title <br/>
or surname "Gozen". According to Salmonson, "Gozen" was "a title of high <br/>
respect given to many martial women" . However the possession of the title <br/>
by non-warriors shows that it was not isolated to them. The Heike Monogatari <br/>
provides a clue as to the title's origins. One of the first stories is that <br/>
of Kiyomori (the great leader of the Taira) and two Shirabyoshi. Shirabyoshi <br/>
were dancers, the pre-runners of Geisha , and bore the title "Gozen". These <br/>
dancers had originally danced with a white dagger in their belt, although by <br/>
medieval times this had been discarded . Given that Samurai class women all <br/>
had a dagger, often presented as a wedding gift, with which to kill <br/>
themselves if necessary , perhaps "Gozen" is connected to the possession or <br/>
use of such a weapon. Tyler either equates it with the English title <br/>
"mistress" or links it (by reverse association) to professional women <br/>
storytellers who related the tales of the warrior women , while towards the <br/>
end of The Heike Monogatari appears a young boy very confusingly given the <br/>
title Gozen .<br/>
<br/>
Probably much used in Japanese warfare (especially from the Sengoku era <br/>
onward), although their use was dishonorable and consequently only <br/>
sporadically recorded, were shinobi or ninja. The thirty-fourth Grand master <br/>
of the Togakure Ryu, Dr. Hatsumi, writes that "kunoichi or female ninja made <br/>
up an important part of the historical ninja families and clans of Japan" . <br/>
Kunoichi, while trained fully in fighting techniques, were also trained to <br/>
make the best use of "their own unique features and strengths" . He gives <br/>
illustrations of bunches of flowers used to conceal daggers and tea kit bags <br/>
containing explosives , and one can imagine any number of other advantages <br/>
women may have had in concealment, not least in their otherwise restrictive <br/>
layers of bulky kimono. Because of her sex, enemies often overlooked "her <br/>
potential as a destructive adversary. Women in feudal Japan were often <br/>
underestimated in terms of their capabilities for power, and this permitted <br/>
the kunoichi...to gain easy access to the very center of the enemy <br/>
stronghold" .<br/>
<br/>
The most famous kunoichi lived in the later half of the sixteenth century, <br/>
outside the main scope of this paper, however she has been included because <br/>
she was not just a female ninja but also a kunoichi jonin, or the commander <br/>
of a group of female ninja . Working for the Takeda family, she was the head <br/>
of a miko (female Shinto shrine attendant) spy-ring: "Chiyome gathered <br/>
orphaned and runaway girls...and trained them as miko vestal virgins while <br/>
also training them as kunoichi female ninja agents" . She is so famous that <br/>
she even turns up in a children�s book by Mayer titled "Women Warriors" . <br/>
Ninja were outcastes, so the participation of women in shinobi activities <br/>
shows that female martial prowess was not restricted to, or necessarily a <br/>
product of, the Samurai class alone. In fact, Omi province was especially <br/>
famous from its strong peasant women such as Okane and Oiko , and there are <br/>
stories of women brawlers and bandits also, such as Oroku and Omatsu <br/>
respectively .<br/>
<br/>
An area of martial life where abilities were put to the test was revenge. <br/>
Revenge was in medieval Japan �a solemn duty, both sanctioned and practiced <br/>
at the highest levels of the Samurai class� . Not only was it a duty, but <br/>
�its requirements were by no means confined to the male line of the family� <br/>
. Women avengers include Hatsu-jo, who�s story is the basis of the kabuki <br/>
play Onoye Iwafuji (her victim was Tsubone Iwafuji) and Tora Gozen who aided <br/>
the Soga brothers  (The Soga brothers� revenge occurred during an incident <br/>
which was initially thought to have killed Yoritomo  ). Revenge was also <br/>
possible between women. Haru-jo, also the basis of a play, avenged an insult <br/>
against her mistress that had caused her to commit suicide . The maid took <br/>
her revenge with a sword against the noblewomen who had perpetrated the <br/>
insult .<br/>
<br/>
The revenge story that is best documented is that of Miyagino and Shinobu, <br/>
which occurred in the Edo period and is told in the kabuki play Gotai Eiki <br/>
Shiro Ishi Banashi  . They were daughters of a farmer who was murdered by a <br/>
Samurai; further more Miyagino was a tayu, or courtesan of the highest <br/>
status . The sisters ran away from their respective occupations and studied <br/>
the martial arts . In 1649 they formally asked their Daimyo to authorize the <br/>
revenge . The Samurai was still in service; he was summoned and the duel was <br/>
�carried out in front of the approving daimyo and his senior retainers� <br/>
Miyagino was armed with a naginata� which by the Edo Period had become the <br/>
traditional weapon for women. Shinobu wielded a kusari-gama� . Shinobu <br/>
entangled their opponent�s sword in her chain while Miyagino finished him <br/>
off . The combination of these weapons was very popular. Sono-jo and Kiku-jo <br/>
also avenged their father in an arraigned duel using these weapons . Revenge <br/>
was made illegal in 1873 .<br/>
<br/>
A female specific form of revenge was uwanari-uchi. This was the socially <br/>
sanctioned custom (common in the Heian period) of a wife attacking a second <br/>
wife, concubine or lover, usually by attacking her house . The rival had the <br/>
right to defend herself and her property . Such attacks were not just <br/>
motivated by jealousy. Other reasons were to defend the succession of <br/>
children  or the family of the first wife�s economic interests . At that <br/>
time the man joined the women�s family, not vice versa, and they supported <br/>
him economically . Although the custom continued until the sixteenth century <br/>
, Masako�s command of a small army to destroy Lady Kame�s house  is the <br/>
best-known example.<br/>
<br/>
Masako�s husband was Yoritomo, who is considered a great example of a <br/>
Samurai, and is acclaimed as the first Shogun and the man who unified Japan <br/>
under a central government. He was a hard man who executed many, including <br/>
women, children and his own brothers. That is what makes it particularly <br/>
interesting that his wife repeatedly defied him, took armies to his <br/>
mistresses and after his death took over government. Although not a warrior <br/>
by conventional definition, Masako was an able general, and maintained the <br/>
loyalty of the Samurai in preference to male leaders. Because of her <br/>
significance, a brief biography in included.<br/>
<br/>
Masako Hojo was Yoritomo's wife, the daughter of his guardian as mentioned. <br/>
Historical and popular opinion has been divided on Masako, who is seen as <br/>
"either one of the most tragic or one of the most Machiavellian figures in <br/>
Japanese history" . Her family was quite insignificant, ruling only a small <br/>
area, and although descended from the Taira the Hojo were not of <br/>
distinguished lineage . Masako was only three when the thirteen year-old <br/>
Yoritomo was exiled into the care of her father . Her mother had died when <br/>
she was young , and when she was twenty her father met and married a woman <br/>
the same age as her while on guard duty in Kyoto . On his return Masako and <br/>
her stepmother Maki began an enmity which would eventually result in her <br/>
father�s disgrace and exile . At the same time her father, Tokimasa, also <br/>
discovered that Masako and Yoritomo had begun a relationship .<br/>
<br/>
Although some authors have maintained that Masako married Yoritomo because <br/>
of political ambition, her father's reaction shows the foolishness of the <br/>
idea. He was angry at the affair for good reason; Yoritomo was an exile with <br/>
no prospects, an alliance with the Minamoto would seriously jeopardize the <br/>
position of the Hojo and not least Yoritomo had already fathered a child <br/>
with the daughter of another local lord of superior power to Tokimasa, and <br/>
this lord had killed the child to maintain good relations with the Taira . <br/>
Masako and Yoritomo eloped .<br/>
<br/>
Their first son, Yoriie, was born in 1181 . Yoritomo appointed the daughter <br/>
of his own Menoto as Yoriie's . This was a great honor, as "the family of <br/>
his nurse would stand to gain tremendous power and influence...the choice <br/>
would later prove to have been a poor one" . The family spoilt the child and <br/>
grew "arrogant in their assumption of power" . Menoto relationships were <br/>
crucial, providing "an undeniably influential force in Kamakura politics" . <br/>
Masako, coming from a provincial and unimportant family, had not experienced <br/>
this system . She was already raising her daughter , and as the eldest child <br/>
had probably raised her brothers after her mother's death. Her life and that <br/>
of her family was radically changed, as she went from being the wife of an <br/>
exile to the wife of the most powerful man in eastern Japan was . While she <br/>
had been pregnant Yoritomo had established a house for a mistress, Lady Kame <br/>
. Under Masako's orders, a small army belonging to Masako's stepmother's <br/>
brother destroyed the house, although the mistress escaped . Yoritomo was <br/>
furious and snubbed his wife, resulting in the Hojo faction marching back to <br/>
Izu . Unable to lose their support, Yoritomo was reconciled with Masako . <br/>
The importance of their marital harmony to politics and to the course of <br/>
Japanese history seems bizarre in retrospect. This was the first incident of <br/>
the conflict which would continue throughout their marriage over the issue <br/>
of Yoritomo's mistresses. It is also the most famous recorded incident of <br/>
uwanari-uchi, the right of a first wife to defend her interests against <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Yoshinaka sent his eldest son Yoshitaka to Yoritomo, hoping to marry him to <br/>
Masako's eldest child, Ohime . Masako and Ohime were pleased with the idea <br/>
and continued to grow fonder of the boy over time, but Yoritomo considered <br/>
him a hostage . Keeping the example of his own life in mind, Yoritomo <br/>
decided to kill him . Masako and Ohime tried to help Yoshitaka escape, but <br/>
the plan failed and he was killed . Ohime became seriously ill in grief and <br/>
this caused another rift between Masako and Yoritomo . Another event which <br/>
pitted mother/daughter against Yoritomo was the sentencing of Shizuka. Both <br/>
Masako and Ohime visited Shizuka while she was captive, and according to the <br/>
Azuma Kagami Masako is supposed to have justified the woman's defiance to <br/>
her husband after the dance, pointing out that she would have done the same <br/>
. Ohime went further, offering to help Shizuka escape, an offer the dancer <br/>
turned down as she was resolved to die . In 1194 Ohime's parents tried to <br/>
marry her to her cousin, but she refused and threatened suicide .<br/>
<br/>
Ohime died in 1197 aged nineteen . In 1199 Yoritomo died . In the same year <br/>
Masako's second daughter Sanman, aged fourteen, also died . Yoriie succeeded <br/>
as Shogun, only to be assassinated in 1204 at the instigation of Masako's <br/>
father . His brother Sanetomo, who was a minor, replaced Yoriie . This gave <br/>
rise to the position of regent for the Shogun, filled first by his <br/>
grandfather Tokimasa . The son of Yoriie, who was in turn killed by Masako�s <br/>
younger brother, the second Regent Hojo Yoshitoki, had purportedly <br/>
assassinated Sanetomo in 1219 . This was the end of Yoritomo's line, and <br/>
Sanetomo was the last Minamoto Shogun . In the debate over who should <br/>
succeed Sanetomo, Masako and her father, apparently under the influence of <br/>
his wife, were pitted against each other, and Tokimasa was forced to retire <br/>
by Masako and her brother Yoshitoki . Masako began<br/>
<br/>
"immediately putting the finishing touches to the organizational machinery <br/>
of the Kamakura government which would assure the continued dominance of her <br/>
own family, the Hojo, for more than a century to come" .<br/>
<br/>
The governmental system seems bizarre, even by medieval standards! <br/>
Fitzgerald describes it thus:<br/>
"There was now an Emperor, almost always a child: an ex-Emperor, his father, <br/>
and often a senior ex-Emperor, who had more influence than the junior one. <br/>
Then there was the Minamoto Shogun, now also often a child, and behind him, <br/>
the real power in the land, the Regent for the Shogun, always...[a] Hojo" .<br/>
<br/>
If possible, during Masako's lifetime it was even more complex, because she <br/>
stood behind the Regent.<br/>
<br/>
In her political maneuvering, she worked with Kaneko no Fujiwara, also <br/>
called Kyo no Tsubone, the menoto of Emperor Go-Toba, and who controlled all <br/>
court appointments . According to Butler, contemporary sources refer to the <br/>
women as "the two women politicians of east and west" and he claims that <br/>
they were "two of the most powerful figures in Japan" . Kaneko had received <br/>
the Junior Second Rank (equivalent to the rank of the Three Ministers) in <br/>
1207, a tangible symbol of the influence she wielded at court . One could <br/>
parallel the women with the Emperor and the Shogun, the men they <br/>
manipulated. Mulhern describes them in these terms: "While Kaneko displayed <br/>
the quick wit and mastery of social stratagem highly valued in court <br/>
circles, Masako demonstrated the rugged pride of Bando warriors ...as well <br/>
as their pragmatic attitude" . The women had met in 1218 to find a successor <br/>
from the Imperial family, a "joint effort of these formidable women, both in <br/>
their sixties" . Keneko also arranged an award of the Junior Third Rank for <br/>
Masako, who, having become a nun on her second son�s death , was the first <br/>
tonsured person to receive court rank since the only other example in the <br/>
eighth century .<br/>
<br/>
Her successful tactical decisions in 1221 enhanced her reputation and her <br/>
pre-battle speech, maybe created by the authors of Azuma Kagami, shows her <br/>
understanding of the warriors� mentality . It is not surprising that she was <br/>
known as Ama-Shogun, the Nun-General . According to Sansom, �hers was a <br/>
supreme example of a women�s rise to eminence, but it was by no means <br/>
without parallel in early feudal Japan� . She died in 1225 . Dilts describes <br/>
her rule glowingly as an era of justice and lower taxation . Her biography <br/>
would be almost unthinkable in the Japan of later years, certainly for a <br/>
hero. She disobeyed her father, argued violently with her husband and went <br/>
against his direct orders to try and save people he had condemned. After his <br/>
death she took government and along with other politically capable women <br/>
successfully ran the country for the rest of her life. The Samurai preferred <br/>
to be commanded by a woman rather than by her brother.<br/>
<br/>
Women were therefore significant actors in medieval Japanese history, not <br/>
least in the martial sphere. As Mulhern writes:<br/>
�By no means isolated, unusual cases born of freakish twists of fate or <br/>
preternatural strength, these are�women who exerted their influence on <br/>
society, people, and nation far beyond the familial sphere. They are not <br/>
heroes who happened to be female nor who renounced their female identity in <br/>
defiance to bravely enter the male domain in pursuit of success and power. <br/>
Rather, their feminine identity was an essential factor in most of their <br/>
contributions significant enough to alter or shape the course of Japan�s <br/>
History� .<br/>
Women were pioneers in new lands alongside their husbands in the regions <br/>
where the Samurai class developed. They fought in the wars which brought the <br/>
ascendancy of the Samurai class, and were political forces to be reckoned <br/>
with. The course of Samurai, and of Japanese, history would have been <br/>
radically different had later standards regarding gender relations been <br/>
rigorously applied in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br/>
<br/>
The Gempei War and aftermath could be seen as the last fling of active, <br/>
participatory women in pre-modern Japan. The Heike Monogatari, the primary <br/>
source for the war, although �labeled as a war tale, described as a story of <br/>
the rise and fall of men, it is fundamentally a tale about women .  Although <br/>
there followed many other significant and powerful women, they became <br/>
increasingly the exception and isolated from one-another. Japanese Samurai <br/>
class women maintained their martial abilities and preparedness, but tended <br/>
not to take to the battlefield in such large numbers again. A notable <br/>
exception is the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, which saw a regiment of naginata <br/>
wielding women pitted against the Imperial Army�s artillery . Writing in <br/>
1899, Bacon relates discovering a military uniform, complete with spear <br/>
cover, among the clothes of a Japanese Lady . It was explained to her that <br/>
they were a vital part of the wardrobe of any Lady, to be used in defense of <br/>
the premises if necessary in the absence of the men . Another nineteenth <br/>
century traveler records a Samurai women showing off her sword. The Lady <br/>
explained that all high-ranking women wore them for self-defense, calling an <br/>
attendant to attack her daughter in example . Her defense was so energetic <br/>
that the retainer was �very glad when she cried out �Enough�� . These <br/>
examples, and the two million women who continue to study the naginata , <br/>
show that the martial legacy of women such a Tomoe lives on.<br/>
<br/>
Appendix A<br/>
Sources<br/>
<br/>
Because of the mono-linguistic restrictions of the author, it is impossible <br/>
to verify the accuracy of information all of which is based on primary <br/>
sources in Japanese, and most unavailable in translation.  In compensation, <br/>
care has been taken that the sources listed in the bibliography are of <br/>
scholarly standard. Nearly all of the authors are/were professors at <br/>
internationally acclaimed Universities, and the validity of those without <br/>
academic credentials is assured by virtue of their citation in other of the <br/>
sources whose authors do posses them. An example of this is Salmondson, a <br/>
central source but not an academic one. She is cited in many of the other <br/>
works, and her reliance on Mary Beard, an acclaimed author, from whose work <br/>
"Women Who Shaped Japan" most of the stories come (I was sadly unable to <br/>
obtain a copy of this work as it has been out of print for some time), lends <br/>
her legitimacy.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the authors are male, and while this does not necessarily mean that <br/>
they neglect the agency of women when discussing Japanese history, in this <br/>
instance it seems to be the case. The few female authors, such as Dilts, <br/>
show women to have been far more significant when narrating the same events. <br/>
The approach of many authors may be guessed at when Turnbull, the <br/>
pre-eminent authority on Samurai history in English language sources and <br/>
widely acclaimed for his Japanese works, can write a statement such as "the <br/>
only 'female warrior' in the whole of Samurai history - Tomoe Gozen" . There <br/>
are, of course, many explanations for this. Military history is not a field <br/>
which attracts many women and since 'women's history' became a separate <br/>
category those not concerned with it have more justification in neglecting <br/>
to mention women. The Japanese sources themselves provide little information <br/>
on those women who are mentioned, making it difficult to discuss them <br/>
confidently in an historical work without specifically researching them. <br/>
Therefore the focus must be somewhat sociological rather than strictly <br/>
historical. All Japanese names are given in the western format to save <br/>
confusion, that is, surname last.<br/>
<br/>
Appendix B<br/>
Historical Background<br/>
<br/>
Although the medieval age was �a time of considerable disintegration and <br/>
warfare, it also saw great economic, social, and cultural changes� . The <br/>
period between the Heian and Kamakura eras is significant because the Gempei <br/>
War was the crucible in which the Samurai, as they are known today, were <br/>
formed. It replaced the aesthetic court of The Tale of Genji with Shogunal, <br/>
military government which continued in various forms until 1868 . War often <br/>
defines or alters societal boundaries. Likewise �Japanese history provides <br/>
striking examples of how changes in the status of women can be linked with <br/>
other broad socioeconomic trends� . The following summery of the period <br/>
illustrates some of these changes.<br/>
<br/>
The rise of the great houses, the Taira and the Minamoto, occurred against <br/>
the background of the Fujiwara court dominance. The Fujiwara had modelled <br/>
their government on the Chinese (T�ang) model . Life at court was also <br/>
modelled on the Chinese example, even, as Dilts point out, when it was far <br/>
from practical . Maintaining the court�s life-style was very expensive and <br/>
placed an almost impossible burden of taxation on the peasants . From the <br/>
late eighth century onwards �aristocrats and princes with no prospects in <br/>
the Fujiwara dominated capital left to seek their fortunes in the outlying <br/>
regions� . As part of the Fujiwara policy of allotting large portions of <br/>
land to simplify tax collection, provincial territories were allotted to <br/>
these nobles, who were often younger or less favoured sons of Emperors . <br/>
Because of their more immediate presence and lower taxation demands (because <br/>
they no longer had to maintain an expensive court life-style), many peasants <br/>
chose to place themselves under the protection of the provincial lords <br/>
rather than the Fujiwara . These lords became powerful, rich and the centre <br/>
of significant military forces . The Fujiwara used these forces rather than <br/>
challenging them .<br/>
<br/>
The courtiers, having turned to more aesthetic pursuits, were unwilling to <br/>
accept a Shogunal commission, so the rural lords were �the men upon whom <br/>
fell the task of maintaining law and order� . In land wars against the Ainu <br/>
and sea battles with pirates, professional, hereditary soldiers (the <br/>
forbearers of the Samurai) emerged, in the service of local lords and not <br/>
the court . The most powerful of the military clans who emerged from this <br/>
background were the Minamoto (who gained territory from the Ainu) and the <br/>
Taira (who fought pirates on the inland sea and coast) . Eventually the <br/>
clans gained a sense of their own power and importance  and inevitably the <br/>
day came when they were called in to settle a court dispute . This battle is <br/>
known as the Hogen Incident , and occurred in July of 1156 . The conflict <br/>
was not strictly divided along clan lines, with a significant Minamoto named <br/>
Yoshitomo and others supporting the Taira, and vice versa , but the Taira <br/>
family was the clear victor .<br/>
<br/>
The Minamoto retaliated in 1160 led by Yoshitomo and his sons ; he had not <br/>
been successful in court politics and moreover had been obliged to execute <br/>
is own father, which was particularly difficult given the cultural emphasis <br/>
on filial piety . This was termed the Heiji incident , and again resulted in <br/>
defeat of the Minamoto, who were subject to �a savage series of executions� <br/>
. Of Yoshitomo�s nine sons , all who were considered adults were executed , <br/>
leaving thirteen year-old Yoritomo (who had fought beside his father) and <br/>
three younger half-brothers who escaped with their mother before being <br/>
dramatically captured . The younger boys were sent to different monasteries  <br/>
while Yoritomo was exiled into the custody of a Taira ally . By 1164 �there <br/>
was but one adult Minamoto left alive� .<br/>
<br/>
In 1180 this survivor, then seventy-four, led an insurrection which was the <br/>
opening conflict of the Gempei war . It was not a widespread rebellion and <br/>
was crushed by the Taira . However, because of the support that the warrior <br/>
monks of Buddhist temples had lent the Minamoto, the Taira forces indulged <br/>
in a vengeful rampage against the monasteries . In one burning, 3, 500 <br/>
people of all ages and both genders were killed .  The Taira leader <br/>
Kiyomori, Yoshitomo�s old enemy, also ordered that Yoritomo be executed . <br/>
With the support of his custodian, whose daughter he had married, Yoritomo <br/>
killed the local Deputy Governor and raised the Minamoto banner, to which <br/>
supporters flocked . On the ninth of November 1180, the massed armies of the <br/>
great houses faced each other for the first time since the war began, and <br/>
the Taira fled in the night .<br/>
<br/>
Over the following years two other Minamoto played pivotal roles. The first <br/>
was Yoritomo�s cousin, Yoshinaka. A great general, Yoshinaka and his <br/>
supporters formed the third power-bloc (between the Taira and Yoritomo�s <br/>
supporters) in Japan by 1181 . A series of natural disasters interrupted the <br/>
war until mid 1182, and popular resentment was directed at the monk-slaying <br/>
Taira . As soon as action resumed, Yoshinaka rapidly expanded his territory <br/>
until he was only forty miles from Kyoto, the capital . To face him, the <br/>
Taira press-ganged a huge army, which, however, �was probably deserting <br/>
faster than it was marching� . Yoshinaka defeated this army in a victory <br/>
which marked the turning point of the war . He took the capital and the <br/>
Taira escaped with most of the Royal Family and the Imperial Regalia .<br/>
<br/>
The second man mentioned was Yoshitsune, Yoritomo�s brother. He was the <br/>
youngest child of Yoshitomo, having been born the year his father died . <br/>
Yoshitsune was an exceptionally gifted general; in fact, he won most of <br/>
Yoritomo�s battles for him. His first mission from his brother was to <br/>
eliminate the rival Minamoto, Yoshinaka . When that was done, Yoshitsune was <br/>
sent after the Taira . On April twenty-fifth 1185 the last battle took place <br/>
at sea, resulting in �the most tragic mass suicide in the history of the <br/>
Samurai� by the Taira and the Royal Family . After their defeat, �the name <br/>
of the Taira disappeared from Japanese history. No other victory in the <br/>
story of the Samurai was so complete and so decisive� .<br/>
<br/>
Yoritomo established a hereditary military dictatorship with the title <br/>
Shogun, and removed government to Kamakura . There he established the first <br/>
central government of unified Japan, called the Bakufu (tent government), <br/>
and �the institutions of Japanese feudalism derive in a great part from his <br/>
work� . As reward for his contribution, Yoshitsune was hunted down and <br/>
beheaded . In 1193 Yoritomo also had killed his last remaining brother . <br/>
Having eliminated all competition, in 1199 he fell off his horse and died . <br/>
After such promising beginnings, �within thirty years of the founding of the <br/>
Kamakura Shogunate the third and last Minamoto Shogun had been assassinated, <br/>
and his place taken by the Hojo� .  Thus the outcasts of the Heian court and <br/>
the warriors who gathered around them became the rulers of Japan.<br/>

<h3>Miyoshi Chokei</h3>
by <i>ltdomer98</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677253550">In volume II of Sansom's History of Japan, he asserts<br/>
on page 291 that "[Jesuit Priest] <br/>
<br/>
Vilela, in the early days of his sojourn in Kyoto, had<br/>
made a good impression upon a number of warriors and<br/>
had converted Miyoshi Chokei, who was then acting as a<br/>
kind of guardian to the Shogun."<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression that Chokei was a Buddhist<br/>
lay-monk, like Shingen or Kenshin, and that Chokei was<br/>
his monastic sobriquet. Did he then convert? I've<br/>
never heard this about him before. Of course, others<br/>
were Buddhist monks who converted to<br/>
Christianity--Otomo Sorin specifically. <br/>

Anyone have any insights?<br/>
