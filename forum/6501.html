 </span></blockquote>Not the Sanada, as far as I know. The Ii took the<br/>
idea, I believe, from the troops of Yamagata<br/>
Masakage--I could be wrong on the name. The Ii then<br/>
made the wearing of uniform armor their thing. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Essentially, when the Yamagata and Ii started doing<br/>
it. Prior to that, it was mainly only a concern to<br/>
equip your men with whatever you could--buying<br/>
matching sets of armor gets expensive. Earlier in the<br/>
16th cent daimyo would mark the armor they issued to<br/>
their ashigaru with their mon; that was probably the<br/>
beginning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Conceivable? I suppose. Not likely--at that point,<br/>
it'd be enough just to make sure they all had armor of<br/>
some sort. Usually the retainer himself was<br/>
responsible for his own armor. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-510549424">Actually further research has found my last position to be false I<br/>
think, re: the Shimazu. Black and white sashimono only; their armour<br/>
in the 16thC being generally black due to the lacquer and lack of<br/>
coloured lace compared with earlier eras - no different from other clans.<br/>
<br/>
The Ii wore red armour and lace in the 16thC, instigated by Obu<br/>
Toramasa (1504-1565) and his brother Yamagata Masakage who inherited<br/>
this "red regiment" (red armour and horse harness for everyone;<br/>
samurai, followers and ashigaru). <br/>
<br/>
So my question should really be: was there any uniformity of lace<br/>
prior to the 16thC, or did it start with Obu Toramasa?<br/>
<br/>

bring home toilet paper from the store. I suppose<br/>
that's why my wife gets frustrated. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
It's important to keep in mind that it was a feudal<br/>
master-retainer relationship. I would take you into my<br/>
service, give you land or a stipend, etc. In return,<br/>
you'd provide military service--and that included<br/>
providing your own equipment, horse, weapons, armor,<br/>
and sub-retainers (your attendants, etc., depending on<br/>
your station) and their equipment. Since it's all<br/>
coming out of different pockets, it's highly unlikely<br/>
I would be able to tell all my retainers "You must all<br/>
be the same". You could standardize your band of 5<br/>
guys or so, but at that time, why? Even the sashimono<br/>
didn't really come into being prior to the end of the<br/>
Onin War, when armies got bigger and bigger and needed<br/>
clearer ways of identifying. Uniforms seem natural to<br/>
us today, but even in European armies, you didn't<br/>
really see uniforms until the late 17th/early 18th<br/>
centuries. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depends on what you mean by "loyal". Did the<br/>
Matsudaira (they weren't the Tokugawa yet) do what<br/>
Imagawa Yoshimoto told them to do? Yes. Ieyasu was a<br/>
hostage at Sumpu, and unless they wanted him back in<br/>
pieces they didn't have a choice. Did they do it out<br/>
of loyalty to the Imagawa? Most decidely not. They<br/>
captivity of their young lord was a sore point for<br/>
many Mikawa bushi, from what I've read. Loyalty, to<br/>
me, implies a desire to serve. I doubt many Matsudaira<br/>
felt any desire to serve the Imagawa.<br/>
