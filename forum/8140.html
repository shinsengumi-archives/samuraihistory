 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I would consider Masashige the samurai ideal. He's definately one<br/>
of my favourites, along with Yoshitsune and, for some reason, Imagawa<br/>
Sadayo. I think my fondness for Sadayo, which has seen me get my hands<br/>
on everything that's written about him even only briefly in English, has<br/>
a lot to do with Sansom's write-up on him in this History of Japan<br/>
volume 2. I'd kill for a translation of his travelling diary.<br/>
