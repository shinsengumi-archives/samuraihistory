WOW Miss Chase for new President of samuraihistory forum. GOD BLESS all and<br/>
go vote<br/>

Poor lad.  Who gave you the sublime misapprehension that this was a<br/>
democracy?<br/>
<br/>
 ...And it's a damned good thing too:  because with no offense to the lady<br/>
in question, and as pleasant as I (for one) find her posts, scholarship does<br/>
not flourish in such a democracy.  Scholarship - which for our purposes here<br/>
I'll define as the pursuit of genuine, accurate information - consists of<br/>
uncompromising minds seeking uncaring facts, then double-checking them in a<br/>
variety of sources:  whereas "democratic scholarship" leads, almost<br/>
invariably, to consensus misinformation.<br/>
I've seen it happen on other lists - the facts that can be documented get<br/>
lost in the ridiculous idea that everybody's opinion carries equal weight<br/>
and validity, and soon the big mouths have half the readers convinced that<br/>
they know as much as the experts.<br/>
That helps no one - it frustrates the experts, it deceives the ignorant, it<br/>
encourages the B.S.ers, and it degrades the transmission of historical<br/>
facts.  There's plenty of bad research out there on the web these days,<br/>
proving my point far more decisively than I could wish.  (Look up a few<br/>
sites on Celtic history, for instance, and you'll find more fantasy than<br/>
fact by a factor of five to one or worse.)  As someone said here not long<br/>
ago - and I've been quoting it merrily ever since - "If you want<br/>
information, this is a good place to get it.  If you want affirmation, get a<br/>
good therapist."<br/>
One of the great things about this site is that there are some genuine<br/>
experts here, who are not afraid to tell people when they're wrong.  Now<br/>
when the folks don't take that well, or politely... then they get slammed.<br/>
And deservedly so.  If you go to an expert for facts, then do nothing but<br/>
try and disprove or ignore those facts, _without being able to defend your<br/>
views as thoroughly as those experts you've asked_, then from my point of<br/>
view you've asked for whatever you get.  You've certainly earned no mercy at<br/>
that point.  If you disagree, then you'd better be able to offer<br/>
documentation to match the documentation of the experts.<br/>
That's straightforward enough, one should think.<br/>
