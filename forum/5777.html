<div id="ygrps-yiv-826765273">G'day Jason,<br/>
Welcome.  I know how much my life and sword interests broadened when I found<br/>
the first sword lists back in 1995.  This Samurai History list came much<br/>
later.  But to your question re the Yakuza and their history.  I have only<br/>
one book and it seems to cover them from Go to Whoa (well, still going!).<br/>
They began to attract the attention of officials around 1612...  Well, go<br/>
find a copy of the (paperback, 414 pages):<br/>
<br/>
YAKUZA<br/>
The explosive account of Japan's criminal underworld<br/>

Hello Brothers;<br/>
   Firstly i am new to the forum and as i have been reading along the past<br/>
few days i have seen truly, in my humble opinion...the best gathering of<br/>
shared knowledge, truth, and comraderie since my days as a U.S. Marine.<br/>
Stating that everyone here has a passion for the subject and era(s) would be<br/>
a gross understatement. I have been reading & researching Japanese history<br/>
for the better part of my life and i am finally within a group where i feel<br/>
i can converse openly, freely & most of all...continue to learn. Please<br/>
pardon me for being overly ecstatic, but this forum is just truly what i<br/>
have been looking for in a nutshell. I have recently returned from Okinawa,<br/>
Japan...but luckily for me i am sure none of you will hold that against me<br/>
(i hope that was funny to some, give me a little face...please) but have<br/>
been over mainland Japan as well and there are not many places in Japan or<br/>
Asia period that i have not traveled. On my own or through the U.S.<br/>
Military. So i offer my modest thanks and praise for being able to exist<br/>
within the forum...<br/>
     Secondly; i agree with the statements of Mr. Wayland...to request for<br/>
information one must truly want to seek the truth. As i am sure we all know,<br/>
one of the staples of Bushido was that it was commonplace to seek<br/>
constructive criticism from your peers...for as Tsunetomo said: "If you<br/>
judge and manage every affair while depending only on your small learning<br/>
and wisdom...etc." The point is that you cannot ask a question with the<br/>
intention of getting only the answer you desire.<br/>
     Thirdly; i wanted to acquire some books or writings if possible<br/>
explaining the history of the Yakuza as a sort of "police force" in their<br/>
origination, i am not sure if this is correct, but i am really looking for a<br/>
sort of timeline from their beginning and how they progressed and changed.<br/>
Any assistance in this manner would be extremely grateful. Continued<br/>
Blessings!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

My use of the phrase "bad romance novel" in no way,<BR><br/>
shape, or form, justified an attack on my person using<BR><br/>
foul language. That is not the act of someone who<BR><br/>
wants answers. The impression is that this person read<BR><br/>
something somewhere, potentially fictional, and<BR><br/>
believes it to be real. Fine--no problem. To me, it<BR><br/>
doesn't sound real. It certainly doesn't sound like<BR><br/>
anything I'm familiar with, at least with no further<BR><br/>
information to draw from. However, I'm fully willing<BR><br/>
to grant it may be a story based on some real events,<BR><br/>
and would be happy to help find what those events<BR><br/>
were, if I could. I cannot, especially when told "I<BR><br/>
know more about this, but won't tell you." Please.<BR><br/>
<BR><br/>
It is not the responsibility of anyone on this board<BR><br/>
to soothe egoes or confirm erroneous beliefs. You have<BR><br/>
the right to incorrectly believe geisha existed in<BR><br/>
1600--you do not have the right to call people who<BR><br/>
tell you that you are incorrect and present facts<BR><br/>
dirty names. <BR><br/>
<BR><br/>
My reply may have been sardonic, but was not<BR><br/>
offensive. I didn't call anyone any names. As a<BR><br/>
subordinate list moderator, I was well within my<BR><br/>
rights granted by Kitsuno to simply delete the email<BR><br/>
and ban the person from posting. I did not, as it was<BR><br/>
an attack directly on me--I chose not to act so I<BR><br/>
could not be accused of acting out of malice. Kitsuno<BR><br/>
can decide to ban or not ban, delete or not delete. <BR><br/>
<BR><br/>
If you want information, this is a great place to be.<BR><br/>
If you want affirmation, go see a therapist. <BR><br/>

of one of my favorite flicks, and I am going to sit down to it right <br/>
now, Sydney Polak's "the Yakuza" with Robert Mitchum and Takakura Ken. <br/>
It may or may not be accurate, but I think it is a great flick.<br/>
