<div id="ygrps-yiv-768421584">Am trying to assess sources available in English on the Japanese sword, and <br/>
we are not sitting high in the cotton here.  The only really available book is  <br/>
John M.  Yumoto,  The Japanese Sword:  A Handbook, Tuttle,  1958,  which has <br/>
undergone many reprintings.  Unfortunately,  Yumoto's  book is very <br/>
short---191 pages.  His terminology is obscure.  The only explicit mention of  tachi is <br/>
in the Glossary on page 184:  well at least he got it in somewhere,  right?   <br/>
Quote is "a tachi  [is]  an ancient slung sword housed in a jindachi <br/>
mounting."  Now that is like saying Julius Caesar lived in Rome, nothing else!  If you <br/>
delve into the text [!],  you find mention of the Koto [Old Sword]  period on <br/>
page 27;  Yumoto says the period lasted from 900 to 1530 [AD].  On page 28,  <br/>
"swords which had a cutting edge of four feet or more were often employed."  I <br/>
assume that,  based on what Tom Helm has written, this is our friend Mr. <br/>
Tachi-san.  On page 47-8,  Yumoto writes: "in this period the sword was worn <br/>
suspended from the hip by cords which passed through two rings on the scabbard <br/>
(Plates 7 and 8).  The best part of The Japanese Sword is the extensive number of <br/>
plates.  The prettiest of the illustrations are those of the tsuba, the <br/>
elegantly wrought hand guards that adorned the swords.  That reminds me of the pal <br/>
who used to play the tsuba in my high school band--he didn't get much music out <br/>
of it, but it was pretty to look at.   As My Ichiban, My Significant Other <br/>
[SO],  would proclaim now,  "self slap!"  And I would deserve it,  too,  Ollie.  <br/>
Later and greater,  Prof.  Murphy,  The Japan Foundation<br/>

For more on koshirae and swords in general the next step should be "The <br/>
Japanese Sword" by Sato Kanzan, trans. Joe Earle. Takes all the ideas <br/>
of Yumoto sensei's book a step further. There are many good books <br/>
available in English nowadays, something for every taste and level of <br/>
interest. I would be happy to make recommendations, is it more on the <br/>
koshirae you are looking for?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289049358">Check out www.ecmas.com<br/>
It is largely a martial arts supply site, and as such has a very<br/>
interesting selection of books on Japanese swords as well as on the<br/>
samurai. <br/>
I am sure you're bound to find at least a few good books on the subject!</div>
