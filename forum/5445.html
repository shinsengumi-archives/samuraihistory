	Interesting take on the character.<br/>
	Insane?  I certainly didn't see him as any more insane than anybody else<br/>
engaged in that line of work.  (That is to say, a soldier for a mob family.)<br/>
Which, being a line of work with ancient and honourable feudal antecedents,<br/>
would scarcely seem to indicate insanity within the context of bushido -<br/>
ancient or modern.<br/>

insane that would not find, say, the average highly-dedicated hanshi of the<br/>
Edo period equally schizophrenic?<br/>
	Myself, I found admirable the clear-sighted honesty with which he<br/>
recognised the growing outcome of the whole little war, and the courage and<br/>
integrity with which he faced his own end.<br/>
<br/>
	Note that I do not say I find his profession admirable - only the qualities<br/>
I specified.  I don't choose to be put in the position of defending the<br/>
profession of hit-men, but I am always interested in people in the modern<br/>
world who are trying to live out the ancient codes.  I thought, and think,<br/>
that "Ghost Dog" presented that idea far better than most attempts made at<br/>
that theme.  In a cinematic climate of special effects, gimmicky ninja, bad<br/>
swordplay presented as essential martial art, and a very imperfect grasp of<br/>
the difference between personal glory and personal honour, "Ghost Dog" stood<br/>
out with well-drawn characters who remained true to themselves (for better<br/>
or worse) throughout.<br/>
	So I am most interested in your reasoning on the question of the<br/>
character's insanity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It just seemed painfully obvious that the main character was <br/>
suffering from some form of mental illness and was dillusional.  It <br/>
has been over a year since I have seen it, but he displayed all sorts <br/>
of signs of mental illness.  He was solitary and obsessive, incapable <br/>
of fitting in to society.  "Normal" assassins tend to be sociopaths <br/>
who can function in society - watch any Mafia movie. Ghost Dog was <br/>
delusional - he structured his reality around the notion <br/>
of "Bushido", not as a philosophy of life like any normal person, but <br/>
as an obsession. He was not even close to "normal".  I liked the <br/>
movie as far as movies go, it just seemed to me that he was playing <br/>
the part of an insane character.</div>
