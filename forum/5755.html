very dodgy affairs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dates about right so your memory is better than mine! Sadly while the <br/>
older technology history books cover the West in detail, they tend to <br/>
gloss over the East generally with toss off sentences showing a deep <br/>
lack of knowledge. The language barrier along with the instability of <br/>
China probably plays a big role in this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This sounds confusing to me. Is it not one piece? Or was it cast? I know <br/>
at a slightly later date that screws were chiseled out or filed to <br/>
shape. Somebody wrote a book on the making the Indian trade gun which I <br/>
believe were forged tubes very similar to this.<br/>

Various precursor info:<br/>
HANDGUN - around 1128. "The gun did not appear until the twelfth century <br/>
A.D. For this three things were needed: a metal barrel, gunpowder with a <br/>
high nitrate content, and a projectile that neatly filled the barrel so <br/>
that the powder charge could exert its full propellant effect. Until <br/>
very recently it was believed that the first Chinese gun ... dated to <br/>
A.D. 1290. Continuing exploration of the Buddhist caves of western China <br/>
has now revealed a remarkable temple at Ta-tsu in Szechuan Province, <br/>
containing evidence that revolutionizes the history of the gun. Among <br/>
the many reliefs in the cave are two showing gunpowder weapons. One <br/>
depicts a small demon with two horns cradling a handgun while a second <br/>
devil holds a grenade. The date of this extraordinary find, according to <br/>
the inscriptions in the caves, is A.D. 1128." [James, Peter and Nick <br/>
Thorpe. /Ancient Inventions/, 1994.]<br/>
<br/>
Gunpowder is thought to have been invented by Chinese alchemists of the <br/>
9th century during their preparation of mixtures of sulfur, charcoal, <br/>
and saltpeter for use as an elixir for immortality. A Taoist book warned <br/>
that mixing three specific elixir ingredients was too dangerous for <br/>
experiment: “some have heated together the saltpeter, sulfur, and carbon <br/>
of charcoal with honey; smoke and flames result, so that their hands and <br/>
faces have been burnt, and even the whole house burnt down.”<br/>
<br/>
The use of gunpowder for military purposes was first recorded in 919, <br/>
and the first detailed description of using a “firing cannon” in warfare <br/>
was in connection with a battle fought in 1126 when the Song army used <br/>
it against the invading Nuchens. The Chinese invention of gunpowder <br/>
never went much beyond its crudest form, and it was abandoned as a <br/>
military weapon shortly afterwards. It reached Japan, Islam, and then <br/>
Europe in the 13th century, and the Arabs improved gunpowder for <br/>
military use. Rockets appear in Arab literature in 1258 as a description <br/>
of their use by Mongol invaders’ on February 15 to capture the city of <br/>
Baghdad.<br/>

<br/>
Glad you found my stuff of interest. A dam fine contribution by yourself<br/>
causing much enlightenment.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Or was it cast? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope again. <br/>
<br/>
As I understand it these early screws were made in two pieces, firstly a<br/>
separate spiral of V sectioned wire, which was in turn wrapped around<br/>
the cylinder of in this case the breach plug, and soldered/welded in to<br/>
position to form a screw; sorry, don't know how, neither an engineer nor<br/>
a metallurgist. But this was done so that the V shaped wire would engage<br/>
to the inside face of the tube. Whether or not the tube was pre cut, or<br/>
if the screw was self tapping, not being intended for removal I don't<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that I can't be of anymore help than that.<br/>

Yours<br/>
