Speaking of big blokes:  I'm far from expert enough to know how accurate<br/>
Robert Shea's research is (in Japan, at least:  elsewhere it tends to be<br/>
pretty decent), but his _Shike_ is a fictional life of the huge monk - I<br/>
forget his name - who was Yoshitsune's companion.  (I cite Yoshitsune's name<br/>
with trepidation; I'm not 100% sure I've identified him right, which is a<br/>
trifle embarrassing when I'm sitting right under a print of him training<br/>
with the Tengu.)  What I recall of the two-book novel matches reasonably<br/>
well with what I've read of the Taira-Minamoto wars since then, but it was<br/>
my first exposure to the period, so I make no promises.<br/>
Shea is generally focussed on what one might call the 'underside of<br/>
history' - secret societies, etc. (he was the better-informed co-author of<br/>
the _Illuminastus!_ satire back in the'70s).   I have my reservations, for<br/>
example, regarding his order of Zinja monks... he relates them to a<br/>
Ch'in-cha sect in China.  Does anybody better-informed than I am happen to<br/>
recall these books, and have any views on their historical value?  Might be<br/>
one for your list, Thomas, and on the other hand, it might be one to teach<br/>
me the limitations of my knowledge.  Either one's good.<br/>

Subject: Lists, lists<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have posted 2 lists in the files section -<br/>
<br/>
One is of films, the other is of 'samurai fiction' - set in the<br/>
'samurai era' by which I mean I have not bothered with<br/>
Lustbader's Ninja, or such like - nor with stuff like Hayes'<br/>
'Wisdom from the Ninja Village' lest I incur the wrath of<br/>
P Richardson of this list - I've met him and he's a big bloke!<br/>
<br/>
In both I have avoided anime/manga stuff, cos I don't know<br/>
anything about it!<br/>
<br/>
Email me any additions/comments, and I'll update.<br/>
<br/>
If we should do a list of factual/reference books, which will be<br/>
quite lengthy, i think, let me know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don't know that I'm better informed, but I recall<br/>
reading one at one point. It was decent fiction, but<br/>
historically....um, it was decent fiction with a<br/>
historical background, how's that?<br/>

G:  That would be better than most, but not suited for Thomas's list, is how<br/>
that sounds to me.   (By the way, all, I'm starting to identify my comments<br/>
with an initial initial, because I don't like the way some of my posts come<br/>
across:  it's hard to tell who's said what.  I conceive that this may<br/>
clarify things a trifle.  If what it does instead is irritate or confuse,<br/>
let me know.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075111141">HI<br/>
<br/>
what about adding<br/>
<br/>
'The sun rises' by Chris Nicol<br/>
<br/>
I bought this book about 13 years ago. (it is actually<br/>
a trilogy)<br/>
<br/>
the first one tells the story of an American soldier<br/>
in the 1860's/70;s who has to escape from thr uSA then<br/>
arrives in Japan. he becomes a samurai and helps the<br/>
satsuma fight against the government in the Satsuma<br/>
rebellion, he wears armour in battle fighting for the<br/>
satsuma and survives<br/>
<br/>
' Play Twilight zone music '<br/>
<br/>
Oh my god sounds just like the last samurai<br/>
<br/>
hehehe<br/>
<br/>
makes you wonder if someone out there has been<br/>
stealing ideas for a story.<br/>
