according to one source (上杉"N) the famous attack on Shingen by <br/>
Kenshin at the fourth battle of Kawanakajima where shingen blocked <br/>
with his fan, was actually made by Kenshin's "kagemusha", Arakawa Izu <br/>
no Kami.  In another source (kzRL), Shingen apparently met with <br/>
the monk Tenkai, and told him that the man who fought shingen was <br/>
HIS "kagemusha".  So for all anyone knows, they were BOTH kagemusha, <br/>
and Kenshin and Shingen were somewhere else completely.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715706448">Yup, you've got at least two on Ieyasu - one by A. L. Sadler and one <br/>
by someone who's name I can't think of off the top of my head (conrad <br/>

one on Nobunaga that I know of by Jeroen Lamers, which I haven't read <br/>
(and probably won't until the price drops way below its current $60 <br/>

the sort of outdated overview of the 16th century by Sansom, but it <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037187089">Hi There<br/>
<br/>
There is a wonderful biography of Toyotomi - in pictures with English subtitles.  It is a facinating work comprising of over 600 Kunioshi B/W prints in about A4 size covering his full life (and more!). The copy I have is taken from the original Japanese Woodcut edition "Ehon Toyotomi Kunkoki" and published in 1975. I managed to borrow a copy from the British Library long time back - and dare I say that I photocopied several pages.. When I saw a copy for sale in Ken Trotman's List just over five years ago at £70 I jumped at it.... Well that's the overview, so the title is:<br/>
<br/>
"The Pictorial Biography of Toyotomi Hideyoshi - the Unifier of Japan" - W.M.Hawley 1975.... and well worth the search!!<br/>

"The Maker of Modern Japan - The Life of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu" - A.L.Sadler; Charles E Tttle Co. 1981 (ISBN 0-8048-1297-7).

    Are there any biographies of Nobunaga, Toyotomi, Tokugawa or Takeda in <br/>
  English?  Just wondering, b/c I'm thinking about reading one and am open to <br/>
  and looking for suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
  Later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209082619">as for the nobunaga bigraphy, "Japonius Tyrannous", I've had it ordered <br/>
from Amazon since before Christmas and it keeps getting pushed back. <br/>
this really makes me worry that they can't get it because i know the <br/>
publisher of the book is going out of business.<br/>
that's what happens when they charge sixty bucks......<br/>
