<h3>bushido thesis</h3>
by <i>kakiser</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-733921836">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am working on a thesis regarding bushido as a site of ideological <br/>
contest between Japan and the West; I am especially interested in <br/>
the way notions of bushido have been disseminated through film.  <br/>
Currently I am in need of an authority on the subject to interview, <br/>
with questions to include:<br/>
<br/>
1) how do accounts of bushido/samurai differ inside and outside <br/>
Japan?<br/>
<br/>
2) Where do public conceptions of bushido originate (i.e., How do <br/>
most people learn about bushido?), and is this different for Japan <br/>
and the West?<br/>
<br/>
3) How has the useage/meaning of the terms bushido and samurai <br/>
changed over the years since Nitobe Inazo popularized them in 1900?  <br/>
<br/>
4) Why do samurai retain such a hold on the popular imagination?<br/>
<br/>
And so forth...<br/>
<br/>
Naturally I'd be happy to receive any direction from group members!  <br/>
And I am curious as to your own answers to these questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What do you mean by "authority"? We've got one<br/>
published author that I know of, and a few others who<br/>
have academic credentials that can weigh in--is that<br/>
what you're looking for? If you plan on using them for<br/>
a source, make sure whomever you use can establish<br/>
their expertise--otherwise, you get a bunch of wannabe<br/>
hacks (like me, I'll admit) answering your question,<br/>
and you quoting them without knowing they aren't<br/>
formally educated in the matter. Just want to make<br/>
sure you're careful :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 1) how do accounts of bushido/samurai differ inside<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Outside Japan, too many people only understand it from<br/>
either movies and television, or from Hagakure, or<br/>
from study of pre-WWII Japan, and think it's an<br/>
all-encompassing lifestyle still followed today, or<br/>
they think it's a religion, or that all samurai were<br/>
paragons of bushido. <br/>
<br/>
Japanese have a much better grasp of the reality, I<br/>
think--that it is a vague set of warrior ideals<br/>
created throughout samurai history, codified in the<br/>
Edo period by those who felt a need to explain the<br/>
existence of a warrior class with no wars to fight, <br/>
then coopted by the political elite to speed the<br/>
buildup of military and industry to catch up and<br/>
surpass the West. While it's by no means completely<br/>
irrelevant to modern Japan, it's not any more invoked<br/>
by Japanese than any Western virtues are invoked by<br/>
Europeans or Americans. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2) Where do public conceptions of bushido originate<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The West: Movies, anime, and reading bad Cleary<br/>
translations. Seriously, part of it is because the<br/>
image is more interesting than the reality--so the<br/>
image gets perpetuated, and the reality gets<br/>
forgotten. <br/>
<br/>
Japan: History class? Of course it's much more<br/>
prevalent in their pop culture, but there's a<br/>
historical understanding of it that tempers it a bit. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3) How has the useage/meaning of the terms bushido<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, well, both words existed before 1900. Samurai<br/>
ceased to exist about 25 years before 1900, so I'd<br/>
hardly say the word was popularized then. In the West,<br/>
I'd say, Bushido is either mentioned in the context of<br/>
the "wonderful" martial virtues of the Samurai, or the<br/>
same "horrific" values of the WWII era Japanese<br/>
military. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 4) Why do samurai retain such a hold on the popular<br/>
> imagination?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because they're freaking cool! As we've discussed on<br/>
the Archives board before, just about everyone has a<br/>
different reason they are interested in the<br/>
subject...some because they collect swords, others<br/>
because they are history buffs, some because they read<br/>
a certain book or movie (if you took a poll, about 40%<br/>
would say "Shogun", in book or movie format, was the<br/>
key for them), etc. <br/>
<br/>
But to attempt to really answer the question, for much<br/>
the same reason that gunfighters of the Old West or<br/>
knights in shining armor do--because the ideal image<br/>
of a brave warrior fighting for "right" against the<br/>
odds is a common human ideal archetype. <br/>
<br/>
Interesting questions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191307008">Greetings Katie,<br/>
Your questions are very interesting and I hope I can<br/>
help. Though, I must say that I am no 'authority' yet<br/>
and still an undergaduate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3) How has the useage/meaning of the terms bushido<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>World War II, or the Pacific War (if you prefer).<br/>
Perhaps the meaning of the terms didn't change, but<br/>
the popular image was certainly damaged for a time.<br/>
You should especially look into the use of bushido in<br/>
the militant policy of State Shinto and its<br/>
ramifications during the war and the questions the<br/>
Japanese were forced to ask themselves afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

> imagination?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Japanese in recent decades have been increasingly<br/>
attracted to a feeling of nostalgia that recalls the<br/>
'better days' when life was simple. In modern Japan<br/>
the fast paced lifestyle most are forced to lead seems<br/>
to be causing some discontent and longing for the<br/>
'furusato', homeland of their forefathers. This is of<br/>
course an idealized homeland and often seems to refer<br/>
to agricultural Tokugawa villages. This is often<br/>
expressed in enka music and I recommend the book by<br/>
Christine Yano, "Tears of Longing" on the subject.<br/>
This nostalgic desire though does explain some of the<br/>
fascination with samurai/bushido that survives in pop<br/>
culture. <br/>
<br/>
These might be a few directions to look into, if I<br/>
think of anything else I'know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564748498"><blockquote><span title="ireply">>Hi Katie,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is an interesting piece in the Daily Yomiuri on the web this week <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/index-e.htm)">http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/index-e.htm)</a>> about a budo teacher called <br/>
Alexander Bennett. You might like to do a search on him and have a <br/>
look at his forum.<br/>
<br/>
My own experience in Japan (purely anectdotal, I'm afraid) is that most <br/>
of my friends my age find foreigners' interest in "samurai" (mine <br/>
included) rather strange. For a start, they never call them "samurai", <br/>
always "bushi". But the same people (mostly women) love kabuki drama <br/>
and watch taiga (the NHK many episode period drama). The young <br/>
actors I was working with last year (in their 20s) thought bushi heroes <br/>
very cool, and were especially keen on the shinsengumi - the plays for <br/>
children in this theatre company's repertoire often include samurai <br/>
stories in all sorts of forms, Boys' festival keeps alive the interest in <br/>
swords, helmets etc, thousands of manga and anime have historical <br/>
themes, which can be comic, heroic, ghostly, whatever. So perhaps the <br/>
real, ongoing cultural history of the country should be seen separately <br/>
from the admiration of bushido which is more common among <br/>
foreigners than among Japanese where, I suspect, it is seen as verging <br/>
towards fascism. (This was definitely the view of the occupying forces <br/>
after the war when samurai drama and films were banned.)<br/>
<br/>
My own interest came from Kurosawa movies!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So perhaps the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an excellent point--'samurai' does not equal<br/>
'bushido'. While there is an almost 1000 year old<br/>
history of samurai/bushi culture to draw upon,<br/>
"Bushido" as a codified system is only a few hundred<br/>
years old, and wasn't popularized until preWWII<br/>
fascists got a hold of it. <br/>
