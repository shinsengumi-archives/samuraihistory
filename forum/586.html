>Not to attack the sacred cow, but Turnbull can definately not be accused of <br/>
>being an acedemic, or a 'true' historian.  Many of his books are filled <br/>
>with small errors and innaccuracies that he very obviously took verbatim <br/>
>from Papinot - although he NEVER mentions Papinot in his sources...  <br/>
>Looking at his books, his information, and his sources together, one has to <br/>
>wonder if he can even read Japanese at all...<br/>
><br/>
>*ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of Inabayama <br/>
>took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in Japanese, <br/>
>including a few he lists in his bibliography state it happened in 1567.  So <br/>
>you may be thinking, 'what's two or three years?'  Well, what if I told you <br/>
>the battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!<br/>
><br/>
>You could write a treatise on just the errors and uncited Papinot sources <br/>
>alone.  Not to mention a picture listed as an 'authors representation' of <br/>
>something that actually looks suspiciously like a tracing of a picture in a <br/>
>Rekishi gunzo book. (Dont have his book or the Gunzo book on hand right now <br/>
>to cite which one)<br/>
>Guess because he's the only game in town he thinks he doesn't have to work <br/>
>at it anymore...?  I've seen him mentioned as Stephen "buy my books" <br/>
>Turnbull in some post before, and I can see why.  Just take a look at his <br/>
>website.  You can't help but get the impression scholarship takes a <br/>
>definate backseat to profit.  guess I can't really blame the guy, though.  <br/>
>Gotta put food on the table somehow.<br/>
><br/>
>Anyway, I'd rather read 'dry' histories if they are more accurate than <br/>
>'popular' histories, although I'd prefer to read an accurate popular <br/>
>history! (like A.J. Bryant's stuff!  At least you get the impression that <br/>
>he has a real interest in the subject, and can actually read japanese, and <br/>
>actually puts in the research!)<br/>
><br/>
>Oh well, just a rant on my part, and I could very well be totally wrong.<br/>
