<h3>Fwd: Hasekura Tsunenaga</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148397533">I came across this posted on the PMJS list, and it looked interesting:<br/>
<br/>
"....I have come across an  <br/>
interesting comment on descendants of the Keicho mission in Spain while  <br/>
I was reading through the Nihonshi thread  concerning the film The Last  <br/>
Samurai on the notorious 2ch site.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that Hasekura Tsunenaga and other Japanese left offspring in  <br/>
Spain while they were there. In a town in Andalucia called Coria del  <br/>
Rio where the Keicho mission arrived, many people bear the surname  <br/>
"Japon" from the Spanish word for Japan. They claim that they are the  <br/>
descendants of samurai. Their children have a clear Mongolian spot  <br/>
(MOKOHAN) which no Spanish children have. In a park in the town, there  <br/>
is a statue of Hasekura in haori, hakama, with two swords.<br/>
<br/>
