<h3>Parallels in US and Japanese history</h3>
by <i>joemaps273</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563588510">I am often struck by a number of parallels between US and Japanese<br/>
history.  For example, the role of the Meiji Restoration leaders seems<br/>
analogous to the founding fathers of the US.  Toshimichi Okubo strikes<br/>
me as a Thomas Jefferson type of character.  Saigo Takamori reminds me<br/>
of George Washington.<br/>
<br/>
The analogies are not, of course, perfect.  But they are strong enough<br/>
to be interesting.  This evening I was comparing the Battle of<br/>
Sekigahara (East vs West) with the Battle of Gettysburg (North vs<br/>
South).  These are the two key large domestic battles in both countries'<br/>
histories.  I was surprised to learn how close the troop numbers were. <br/>
At Gettysburg, it was 93K (north) vs 71K (south).  At Sekigahara, it was<br/>
88K (east) vs 81K (west).  How coincidental that such analogous battles<br/>
had troop numbers that were so comparable!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865693390">Yes, exactly.  I've thought of that parallel too.  In particular, there<br/>
is a similar type of "lost cause" romanticism about the Confederate Army<br/>

government, but both are now revered in prominent statues.  Both of them<br/>
are thought of as having high moral character, worthy of emulation.  And<br/>
both rebellions figure prominently in films and TV shows.  The Boshin<br/>

  Regarding the similarity between Saigo and Robert Lee, please let me know the following thing if you have any idea .<br/>
<br/>
  As to Saigo, he was dead through the war against New Government , Meiji Government , even he was the main guy to have established that government as a result that he formed very strong enough military power to upset old Edo govenment , Bakufu.  That war was named as Seinan Senso.  The reason of cause of that war was attributed to the difference of thought of between Saigo and the leaders of Meiji Government.<br/>
One was that Saigo proposed to send himself to Korea to negotiate with the government of Korea at that time to open her in order her to contact with  foreign countries instead closing , but Meiji government refuged his proposal.  Second was that Saigo hoped to revolute Meiji government another time and creat new government formed by just regular civilians like France's revolution  instead by ex-buke , Bushi in Meiji Government.<br/>
<br/>
  How was Robert Lee ?  Did he die because of war against government of U.S.  at that time ?  or what?     How did he die ?<br/>

I feel that that is generally correct in terms of Saigo, but the parallels being discussed are in individuals' motivations and similarities in situations rather than great trends in the flow of nation-states' histories; Saigo was looking to modernize Japan in a way which his Meijijidai compatriots in government couldn't accept. General Lee was a soldier loyal to his home state, not to any profound concept of where the Union should be directed towards. <br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Parallels in US and Japanese history</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624146166">Gentleman, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have been reading the discussions with a keen interest. I believe I have mentioned before of my PHd thesis which is a comparison of the warriors of the Illiad and the Samurai of the 16th century (with interjections with the Viking's as I am currently living in Norway).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The point I wish to make is this. One can establish links fairly easily from most cultures, wars, leader, religions, e.g the above, if one wishes to find them, but I think it's a little redundant merely to say and think that. For example, I began my thesis with a crique of Karl Marx. In his Grundrisse, he askes would Achilles be possible with powder and lead? Part of my thesis lies in me comparing the warriors of the Illiad and those of the Samurai to argue yes, an 'Achilles' type of hero was indeed possible in the age of guns: e.g the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, or the Satuma rebellion which is the event, and its leader of the discussion, also, I think its interesting to note, that Marx died five years after the Satsume rebellion, an interesting illustration to demonstrate that Western thinking rarely glanced Easrwards to the Japans (though Nietzsche does say he would move there if he had the capital). But merely to say that the Greek warriors and Samurai warriors are similar is not very groundbreaking.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What I am suggesting is that while it is interesting merely to look and compare cultures, Japan of this period and the American Civil War are too areas of deep historical interest too me, we should be looking at what we can learn from such comparisons. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What does it tell us? <br/>
<br/>
How does a comparison help our understanding?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What makes a man challenge the governement?<br/>
<br/>
What makes a man lead a rebellion killing his own people?<br/>
<br/>
Look at the power of the ideologies, are there common ideas, what does this tell us about these men?<br/>
<br/>
Look at the literature is closer detail, history is written by the victor, and both Lee and Saigo were heroic losers.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A book by Cliford Geertz, 'The Interpretation of Cultures' from the 70's may prove interesting to the some members.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just a few ideas...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501472122">I think he means small, hunter-gatherer communities. However, as you perhaps rightly point out, evidence on equality is non-existent and indeed highly unlikely as most anthropologists agree that even as this early juncture in societal evolution there were clear role differences based upon gender.  <br/>
I feel much of the basic beliefs about a kind of utopian hunter-gatherer community is simply a mirror on the clearer evidence for social stratification which occurred in sedentary, dare I say 'civilized', lifestyles.<br/>

This is an over simplified explaination to a complex problem. I refer the members to Karl Marx, Communist Manifesto; Kieth Hopkins, Conquer's and slaves; and Fredich Nietzche, On Competivism and Aggression for general reading.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Slaves did not simply become so because they were weak. Some were brought, traded, became indebted to the state, and yes trophies of war. The earliest slaves I can think of is the enslavement of Messina by the Sparta in 8th century BC, but Homer talks about slaves in the Illiad which could be talking about the 1300's bc. And slaves were not always barbarians. The Greek slaves of the Ancient world were often tutors, doctors and specialists.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Aslo, rice an asian suppliment, not a European. The first settled people were in what was know as the Fertile Cresent, subsisting on Emmer and Eincorn.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Terrorism: the clue is in the title. One doesnt have to be rich or poor. The idea is too terrorise the enemy. I refer you to the pirates attack on Rome in 70's bc; the Spanish during the Napoleonic war, the Vietcong, and more recently the terrorists in Iraq, Afganistan and Pakistan.<br/>

As far as slaves are concerned, this is the parallel not only in US and Japanese history, but in world wide of human history since ancient world.<br/>
<br/>
Until Humans invented so called civilizational tools, or rice crop, they used to live under helping each other concept and equally.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, they formed strong powered people vs weak people gradually, resulting in coming out slaves from weak people. <br/>
<br/>
Even now, the rich people and poor people exist in world wide. The gap between rich and poor has never been narrowed since occured in world wide. <br/>
This is the real cause of Terrorism by poorer side against richer side.<br/>
<br/>
Now , the fellow friends of this community must ask what you can do how to settling out this terrorism problem.<br/>

One sad similarity between US and Japanese history is the displacement and attempted genocide of the native people by the "new government". I am of course drawing a parallel between the policies and actions of the European settlers/US government towards Native Americans and the Emishi/Ainu/etc....<br/>
<br/>
Not just in the land-grabbing and killing--- but we also saw many Emishi come to work for the new Emperor(s) --- just like some natives allied with the new US.<br/>
<br/>
We also see that the tactics brought in from the old country (Europe for US, China for Japan) were no match against the guerilla tactics of the natives---and newer devices and strategies had to be made to fight them.<br/>
<br/>
Also--the idea that many Ainu hid their ethnic origins to avoid problems reminds me of many native families (that can) hiding their origins to avoid problems.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know though...there are not any "Japanese reservations".. but both groups still fight over "indigenous rights"...<br/>
<br/>
Etc.etc....<br/>
<br/>
However, I would say this pattern is common anytime a foreign invader comes in and "colonizes" an area..<br/>
<br/>
But, still.. I would say that is applies. <br/>
<br/>

This is an interesting question. Earliest records are in the Akkiadian around 4000 bc. This was a time of turmoil and expansion for the sedentary cities of the region. There is no evidence as far as I am aware of humans helping one another, but the is nothing to the contrary. I refer you to a theory a few years ago which stipulated that the mongoloid race that came across the Bearing strait around 30,000 bc, may have exterminated the indigonius population around 12,000. the evidence for this is a pink layer (evidence of burning) and arrows heads and primitive weapons sealed within the layer.<br/>

I think he means small, hunter-gatherer communities. However,�as you perhaps rightly point out, evidence on equality is non-existent and indeed highly unlikely as most anthropologists agree that even as this early juncture in societal evolution there were clear role differences based upon gender.� <br/>
I feel much of the basic beliefs about a kind of utopian hunter-gatherer community is simply a mirror on the clearer evidence for social stratification which occurred in sedentary, dare I say 'civilized', lifestyles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-112639409">1. First time I read a SH group post in a year, and it'd devolved to Tony having to break up social utopian discussion? I guess I haven't missed much. <br/>
<br/>
2. Forgive me for top posting, but what the hell is with the new formatting? I can't bottom post, it seems. The entire previous message (below) is inserted like a picture--I can't even go in and screw around with your words, Tony. Apparently Yahoo thinks your word is law. Yet I can't follow it. <br/>

Did it really happen like that?did they go to be more infantry based? I think maybe each clans have their own elite forces. Like the oda,they are well known for their ashigaru. But some others are known for their heavy cavalry like the naginata cavalry.. So maybe it depends on the battle situation they are facing at that moment.. But it just my thoughts.. <br/>
