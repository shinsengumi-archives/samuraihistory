<br/>
For the record, "Musashi" wasn't his name, anyway.<br/>

Yes, the Kaga was obviously named after the province,<br/>
but what about other aircraft carriers? Any idea as to<br/>
the Shokaku, Zuikaku, Shoho, Zuiho, Soryu, Hiryu,<br/>
Akagi? <br/>
<br/>
I don't recognize any of the words...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
