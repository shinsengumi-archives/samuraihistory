You said, "the way of the samurai and all was working just fine! Why were they trying to <br/>

<br/>
The samurai were feudal warriors... basically Japanese fighting other Japanese, hidden behind <br/>
a curtain of isolationism. Well, the long-practiced isolationism ended with the intrusion of  <br/>
Perry's ships. When that curtain fell, Japan saw a bigger world with a lot of potential enemies. <br/>
Japan realized it could not defend itself. Japan had to unify and modernize in order to defend <br/>
itself from invasion. The samurai tactics of war were well-suited for fighting other sword-bearing <br/>
foes on the island of Japan. But if could do very little against a navy fleet.  <br/>
The Japanese were no longer concerned with how to defend themselves from other Japanese. <br/>
They had to know how to defend themselves from everybody else. Emperor Meiji simply <br/>
responded to the impetus of potential attack from other nations.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690652637">I'd like to add my 2 cents worth.  The Imperial government in the 1870s <br/>
abolished the hereditary samurai privileges.  They also stopped paying the annual <br/>
stipend that every samurai received (the government did make a one time <br/>
payment).<br/>
<br/>
Worst of all, from the samurai viewpoint, the Imperial government started <br/>
recruiting peasants into the military.  This had been the sacred province of the <br/>
samurai for centuries.<br/>
<br/>
The samurai couldn't stand the changes that were leaving them behind, so they <br/>
rebelled (I should add that not all samurai rebelled.  The Tokyo policemen <br/>
were former samurai and fought with the government forces against the rebels).<br/>

The samurai were fighting for their honor, their privileges, and for their <br/>
way of life.<br/>

The majority of the samurai were broke. In fact, the salary of the <br/>
low-ranks samurai barely sufficed to survive--that's wahy so many of <br/>
them had to sell their beloved swords (sigh). How ironic: they were <br/>
supposedly on top of the Tokugawa hierarchy, and by the 19th c. they <br/>
were the poorest of the four medieval classes, making much less than <br/>
artisans, merchants, and often even less than farmers.<br/>
No surprise they were pissed off.<br/>
Of course the samurai ideology played its role, but I believe economic <br/>
reasons were important as well. They were angry, and hungry too.<br/>

Yes, they rebelled because they were poor and hungry.<br/>
But, it was not an event that characterized the change<br/>
in the traditional Japanese social system.<br/>
It was rather limited modification to their existing<br/>
social structure schematized by one groups of<br/>
samurais(nobles) against the other.<br/>
Meiji restoration was possible only through some<br/>
samurai groups. Those who suppresed brutally other<br/>
rebelling samurais were also samurais.<br/>
<br/>
A real social change did not mature to exist until<br/>
General MacArthur passed the land reform bill after<br/>
World War Two...<br/>
