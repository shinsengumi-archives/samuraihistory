<h3>A little digest from all the posts I&#39;m on about the Ninja straight blade sword...</h3>
by <i>Eamon Murray</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-959322815">Dear List-ka,<br/>
                This post has been sent to many of the ninja-related lists<br/>
I'm on, so's to share some of the good the bad and the downright ugly (I'm<br/>
joking...of course...  ;)  ) points raised on the ninja straight bladed<br/>
sword. Just to share all the ideas, in a sort of cross-post digest. Sorry<br/>
it's a little large, and you may be reading some posts for the second time.<br/>
Bear with me, and enjoy the knowledge and ideas shared...<br/>
(And if your post isn't here, sorry, I just threw in the most striking posts<br/>
but left out the many which shared very similar viewpoints.)<br/>
<br/>
E.<br/>
<br/>
Digest thingy starts here...:<br/>
<br/>
Hey listka,<br/>
               Does anyone here know the origin of the ninja straight sword?<br/>
And would they share this information? Did the ninja actually train with or<br/>
use the straight sword?<br/>
<br/>

It is my understanding that the ninja developed the straight sword as the<br/>
antithesis to the samurai katana, even though many ninja families still held<br/>
their family katana very sacred.  But, understanding that ninjutsu was<br/>
developed for survival and practicality, the straight sword was more<br/>
practical, shorter, and lighter in weight than the samurai dai-katana.  And<br/>
since it had not been embued with the spiritual qualities of the katana, it<br/>
was more like a utility knife than a symbol of honor.  I believe the<br/>
straight ninjato came into serious use in the 1500s, and were usually forged<br/>
from a single piece of steel, blade and tang together, for the greatest<br/>
efficiency.  The could be produced very quickly and in great numbers (not<br/>
having to go through the elaborate forging and honing of the curved samurai<br/>
katana).<br/>
<br/>
And it was not usually carried on the back, as most ninja movies would have<br/>
you believe.  It was carried thrust into the sash at the side of the ninja.<br/>
It was carried on the back usually just to keep it out of the way while<br/>
climbing.  (Have you ever tried to effectively draw a ninjato while sheathed<br/>
on your back?  It ain't as easy as it looks.  You have to pull the scabbard<br/>
down at the same time that you are drawing up, and heaven help you if you<br/>
have short arms.)<br/>

straight sword..it is not in any history or any museums.The ninja did not<br/>
form any of their own swords..the closest you can get to a ninja using a<br/>
straight sword would be a gardening blade but it looked nothing like the<br/>
straight blades you can get today.The common blade used was a shoto with a<br/>
curved blade.Train with the Samurai curved blade it is easier to manuever<br/>
and pull from the sheath.<br/>
