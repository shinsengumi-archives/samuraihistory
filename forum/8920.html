<h3>Question about Politics (Fujii/Mori-- late 1500s)</h3>
by <i>steven_matsheshu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-856568601">Can we shed some light on the politics of Hiroshima/Okayama in the late <br/>
1500s.... why did Kogen throw all his resources into dying with the <br/>
Amago why the rest of the Fujii family were vassals of the Mori ?<br/>
<br/>
   I understand the principle of a family sending its members to <br/>
different Daimyo and such... and of the honor and loyalty to one's <br/>
master... but I am also wondering of any other less obvious and <br/>
possibly less "fantasy-sounding" reasons why the Fujii home base near <br/>
Yoshii would fall to the Mori Army while.... within the Mori Army <br/>
itself, you had Fujii commanders and Fujii shinobi/samurai.<br/>
<br/>
         Any insight would be awesome.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.</div>
