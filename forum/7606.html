<h3>Samurai - sword and soil</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-991104954">One aspect of the samurai is the notion that once removed from the<br/>
land, the rot sets it. Samurai do not thrive in cities, as the Taira<br/>
were the first to demonstrate.<br/>
<br/>
The Tokugawa did not originate the residency system, but they<br/>
certainly brought it to fruition, but if one looks at Shikoku, and<br/>
especially Tosa, there is a fine example of what is involved.<br/>
<br/>
Hideyoshi's edicts laid the foundation, and samurai were required to<br/>
live in the castle town (Urado, which did not exist at the time!), and<br/>
any who refused were demoted to farmers - remove the land from the<br/>
sword, or the sword from the land - didn't matter, but a land and<br/>
sword together means independence and a degree of autonomy which<br/>
nobody likes.<br/>
<br/>
When Yamanouchi took over the Chosokabe, a split developed between the<br/>
traditional idea of the samurai, reconstructed and remodelled on<br/>
Tokugawan lines (surviving on a stipend from his employers) who were<br/>
called joshi (upper class) and the local rustics, both farmer and<br/>
warrior, the goshi (lower class), led by the shoya, village headmen<br/>
entitled to ceremonial dress and to carry one sword. (Other rules<br/>
allowed joshi to have an umbrella when it rains, but not goshi; joshi<br/>
can wear tabi, but not goshi; pretty petty all in all, and surely<br/>
bound to cause friction?)<br/>
<br/>
Throughout Japan the better-off classical samurai - the ruling class -<br/>
lived a life of increasing comfort and idleness, whilst his rustic and<br/>
downtrodden counterpart continued living on the land and practicing<br/>
those very skills and virtues that properly define the notion of<br/>
'samurai' today.<br/>
<br/>
By this time goshi status could be bought - Ryoma Sakamoto's father<br/>
was a merchant who bought his - whilst samurai status was strictly<br/>
hereditary - yet who considers Ryoma not to be samurai?<br/>
