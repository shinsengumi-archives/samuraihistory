<div id="ygrps-yiv-283471418">What I think is nuts is the total lack of respect this group has shown each other! 1 person makes a comment, and now, in my honest opinion, the "know-it-all's" are pissed off because someone voiced their opinion on "lifestyle"? If we can't respect each others opinions, why have a group at all? EVERYONE is wrong for this, not just one person...and if I've offended anyone, please tell me! <br/>
Let's get back on track, folks. This is about samurai "history", which I've greatly been schooled on and it's been much appreciated. I'd hate to quit this group over "punk shit", and I think others would, too. I've learned alot and I'd like to continue that...<br/>

this is tim heaton......again.<br/>
i once learned that being a samurai meant being the<br/>
way of the sword,in which had so much history and<br/>
respect as well as fear behind it.and a man to choose<br/>
this path was not quit yet discoved in completeness as<br/>
the chinese had lessoned,so many joined armies and<br/>
such to try and futhermore their accomplishments in<br/>
the way of the sword but because it was man ruling<br/>
more so than teaching the lesson reamained abscent and<br/>
man just became powerful with the sword and just a<br/>
fragile amount of the awarness in being with the sword<br/>
but still the samurai became and few to be the way.the<br/>
respect of the blade is not just its temperment and<br/>
threat in being in the wrong hands.<br/>
i learned from hopes of those who influence the<br/>
samurai had in mind to study these things together<br/>
like alchemy to term the way of the sword(iron<br/>
dragon,tai chi,kung fu,the buddahs palm,and<br/>
zen)stillness of the blade with man having the mind to<br/>
observe how dangerous he is even to himself to take up<br/>
the sword. in being is a method not quite tought to<br/>
keep the secret of masturing the sword but still many<br/>
have almost mastered it through years of practice,but<br/>
the feeling of the sword in mind of too many men<br/>
became dangerous.in conclusion to ones eye your no<br/>
one,to your own you may be all or nothing as well,and<br/>
to many you may be awsome ,to god you too cruel or a<br/>
real man,and again who and what was a samurai.and from<br/>
what i have studied i am going to do my best at<br/>
becoming a true samurai someday and leave this modern<br/>
world behind for its own self ruining. sincerly tim heaton.<br/>

low tide. It's supposed to get a bit nastier later on. I'm pretty sure <br/>
Endo-sensei didn't write a single happy book. Of course I'm American, so <br/>
I like heros and happy endings. Something hard to find in most other <br/>
cultures writings. For those on the list interested in historical <br/>
fiction, he also wrote a book called Samurai which is a story about some <br/>
low level flunkies sent to Mexico and then Rome to negotiate treaties <br/>
for their lord. I think this one and Chinmoku have English editions. He <br/>
was at one time considered for the Nobel Prize.<br/>

violent warrior type. How do you get one lifestyle from this variety?<br/>

his name, hmmm,... seems to be several! Jiha, Koushi, Sensei (not the <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Shinto might be a background, but how could it be distinguished from Animizm ?<br/>

rampant fascism.<br/>
