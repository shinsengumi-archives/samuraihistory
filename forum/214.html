<h3>Greetings, and army color schemes...</h3>

<br/>
Just want to say that I'm thrilled to have found this list, even <br/>
though I'm at best a pseudo-amateur historian of Japanese military <br/>
history.  My main interest in this group is that I'm an avid <br/>
wargamer, and am putting together miniatures to recreate samurai <br/>
conflicts from the feudal era (just ordered 800+ miniatures).<br/>
<br/>
At first, I probably won't have a good mix of troop types to <br/>
represent what would have appeared on the battlefield at any given <br/>
time.  I have a small contingent of monks, lots of mounted troops, <br/>
and an assortment of ashigaru spearmen, bowmen, and some samurai <br/>
retainers.  While I have a couple ashigaru arquebusiers, my thought <br/>
is that with all the mounted troops I'd best represent earlier <br/>
periods of warfare (1300-1450ish or so).<br/>
<br/>
My conundrum is this: I'd like to paint the miniatures so that they <br/>
reflect what a real army would have looked like on the battlefield.  <br/>
With only a few exceptions, such as Ii's Red Devil's in the later <br/>
period of samurai warfare, I've run across almost no accounts of <br/>
organized uniforms or the like.  I've even having a hard time <br/>
figuring out how sashimono's and other field standards would be <br/>
used.  Anyone mind giving me some tips on how they would be used, and <br/>
what a typical army might look like?  My guess is assorted colors, <br/>
but I'm not sure.  Like I said, I enjoy the history of the period but <br/>
am not well versed in it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395647640">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
 you are correct that many armies did not have uniform<br/>
colors.  In fact at that time so many different armies<br/>
would join forces and then split that the armies were<br/>
really just coalitions of different forces.  <br/>
<br/>
The sashimono was a device used buy a single samurai<br/>
to identify his position on the field.  During this<br/>
period for the most part warrior attentandts had been<br/>
gotten rid of and the individual warrior would carry<br/>
his own sashimono on a ring and post on the back of<br/>
the armour.<br/>
<br/>
Anouther form of device was the o uma jirushi.  This<br/>
was the identifyibng device of a daimyo or high<br/>
ranking general in the army.  This device was usually<br/>
positioned at the center of an army near were the<br/>
general was positioned.  This position was usually the<br/>
point of the most conflict.  The holder/holders of the<br/>
uma jirushi were considered very important and<br/>
honored.  <br/>
<br/>
Earlier in the e-mail I said that attendants were<br/>
mostly gotten rid of.  This is true except ing the<br/>
case of the daimyo or some high ranking personages who<br/>
still had quite a few, dependant upon there income of<br/>
koku.<br/>
<br/>
There are few books that talk about the actual<br/>
formatio ns and positions in early samurai warfare. <br/>
You can find some strategy maps and battle formations<br/>
in books like "sekigahara" by anthony J. Bryant. <br/>
"Nagashino" by stephen turnbull and the "Samurai<br/>
sourcebook" by stephen turnbull.<br/>
<br/>
Well I hope that this has been helpful.<br/>
There are more identifying devices like religous<br/>
sayings such as namyo ho renge kyo but for the most<br/>
simple this is it.<br/>
