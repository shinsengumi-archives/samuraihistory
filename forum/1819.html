<div id="ygrps-yiv-861731929">Greetings Tom<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Tom, but I STRONGLY disagree with ya.<br/>
Although personatelly, unlike most people of my country, I was pro the<br/>
league USA/UK against terrorism and Saddan, and proud of my japanese<br/>
ancestry when Japan did diplomatic support to USA at this event against the<br/>
terrorism, I am impartial.<br/>
<br/>
In THIS specifical case, USA was totally evil, because Tokugawa was not a<br/>
bad man. Much of his deeds was in part, responsible for the greatness of the<br/>
Japan of nowaddays.<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa was responsible for the end of the several wars inside Japan and<br/>
the unification of it. Tokugawa did great deeds for the cultural<br/>
preservation of Japan, and there is much of Tokugawa's hand in therms of<br/>
incentive about the development of Samurai Culture and heritage.<br/>
<br/>
Ieyassu Tokugawa is a name to be listed between the great historic statesmen<br/>
leaders just like Julius Caesar Augustus, Alexander The Great and others.<br/>
<br/>
Even Sid Meyer's Civilization I for Windows95 mentioned Tokugawa.<br/>
<br/>
And the Tokugawa procedures against christianism's infiltration and<br/>
political conspiracy avoided the several atrocities that happened against<br/>
the other religions that christianism promoted in other countries just like<br/>
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Spain and others, just to name a few cases.<br/>
<br/>
To be anti-tokugawa is to be against the samurai spirit and culture.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerelly<br/>

I like the idea of the story as well. Why not then tell the<br/>
true story of the actual American Arms dealer, Thomas Glover, who<br/>
sold Civil war surplus to the anti-Tokugawa forces?(this may be the<br/>
one and only time American arms dealers were supplying the forces of<br/>
good) One of my favorite photographs from the period shows him in<br/>
Nagasaki I believe, surrounded by Satsuma shishi, at his side is his<br/>
very young son. I always wished I could be that kid.<br/>
If one must create fiction from history imagine all that<br/>
could be done, telling the tale of that young mans life...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not the Tokugawa we had anything to do with, Ieyasu died LONG before the <br/>
USA was a gleam in anybodies eyes. Most of it was still filled with <br/>
Native Americans! Yoshinobu inherited a corrupt and doddering system <br/>
that sooner or later would have had another civil war, which it did. I <br/>
would argue in many ways that Japan wasn't really a nation until the <br/>
Meiji restoration. Also one of the reasons we forced Japan to negotiate <br/>
with us was to insure fair treatment of our castaways. Japan enslaved or <br/>
killed them. Will Adams was one such in an earlier period and the people <br/>
he was with were badly mistreated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but I'm sure there are dead clans and monasterys that would curse <br/>
his name. He killed a lot of people, as did his two predecessors.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have no disagreement with that. Christianity is a plague of some kind <br/>
in that period, the Spanish had used that conversion trick many times <br/>
before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ieyasu was an incredibly pragmatic warlord of the Sengoku jidai who rose <br/>
to the top by commiting treachery against his master. The things you <br/>
think of  'samurai spirit' and all of that are an Edo jidai construct of <br/>
a government that wished to stop the endless revolts against the current <br/>
shoguns. Unless betrayal and murder are the spirit your talking about.<br/>

<h3>Autrocities in Seden by the Catholic Churc? Plz Explain... Was: Tokugawa Evil? was:/Re: hey</h3>
by <i>chris_danyael_x</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-268635960">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I'm a lurker of this mailing list; that means i read it but shut up<br/>
since I realize i really cant add anything to the discussions here.<br/>
Until now that is.<br/>
<br/>
Note: This is mainly written in an Ironic and sarcastic tone, and the<br/>
dates ar approximately right, I may be off by +<br/>
+/- 75 years or so. Never really botherd with dates. <br/>
<br/>
I just so happen to live in Sweden, the southern part of Sweden. History<br/>
is my favourite hobby, and I really cant recall any autrocities done by<br/>
the catholic curch to us. In teh begining when some monks came to our<br/>
country (were talking 600-800AD) we killed the anoying ones direktly,<br/>
and left the harmless ones to to what ever they wanted, as long as they<br/>
didnt piss us off. Not untill the 1300AD I think (Not sure on exact<br/>
dates, may be later may be sooner) A swedish king said I'm gonna be<br/>
baptised, and everybody who has a porblem with it, chop! chop! One head<br/>
shorter. I.E. your king is catholic, now the rest of sweden is catholic.<br/>
This held up for a time, and we had the usual witchhunts and stuff, but<br/>
noting to out of place in Europe during 1400-1600. Then a jolly good'ol<br/>
chap named Gustav Wasa, decided to change from catholic to protestant,<br/>
and the chatolic got thrown out. tyhis was maily done outof economic<br/>
reasons. The catholic curch is sinfully rich, but the protestants favour<br/>
poverty, ie more taxes to the King. yay! If i remember correctly this is<br/>
some where during the begining of 1500. And since then we have had wars<br/>
with polen, Turkey, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Finland, And a few others<br/>
that just so happend to be on the way to Polen and Turkey. I have no<br/>
recoolection what so ever of autrocities of the scale of the spanish and<br/>
portugal in South america, or the english men in China, or the french<br/>
and Dutch in Africa. Who, in the name of the pop enslaved ppl for the<br/>
sake of christianity.<br/>
<br/>
Nope, we are friendly, peacefull people in Sweden, and as such we have<br/>
been treated nicely by the Father.<br/>
<br/>
 Well thats what I remember from my history lessons in my 12 year carer<br/>
of grammar school, junior high and highschool. <br/>
<br/>
Now what was the autricities you were talking about?<br/>
Apart from the usual witchhunts and heretic slaying, of the dark ages?<br/>
