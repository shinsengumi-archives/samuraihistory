 </span></blockquote>Hi, fellow chinese.<br/>
<br/>
First off, we tend to use the term ABC for American<br/>
BC, not Australian BC ;) (we as in Singaporeans :p)<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I am of a similar situation, interested more<br/>
in Japanese history (started by Shogun Total War) and<br/>
culture in general (anime fan myself), than of the<br/>
history of my own culture.<br/>
<br/>
One good thing about living in Singapore is that we do<br/>
get to watch historical dramas made by PRC (far more<br/>
authentic than what ROC and HK churns out).<br/>
<br/>
As someone else said, ask your parents and<br/>
grandparents on they know. Likewise, libraries and the<br/>
internet offers quite a lot of information to begin<br/>
with. Of course, there are a lot of less than<br/>
authentic information out there. A little experience<br/>
will help you to separate the wheat from the chaff.<br/>

Don't think your swords and clothes should be as good as those of other people. Be content as long as they don't look awful. Once you start acquiring what you don't have and become even poorer, you'll become a laughingstock.<br/>

Chinese. How naive am I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You wont believe me when I tell you this but my grandparents and two <br/>
uncles live in Singapore. Ang Moo Kua, actually (think that how you <br/>
spell it) have been there a few times. What a coincidence<br/>
