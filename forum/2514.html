<h3>tsutsui retainers</h3>
by <i>jdsalvador3</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533774154">Greetings All,<br/>
I'm doing some research on the Tsutsui family of<br/>
Yamato, with primary interest in the pre-Nobunaga<br/>
years.  <br/>
My questions: I can find little data on the families/<br/>
retainers allied to the Tsutsui, does anyone know<br/>
names (or where I could get the info)?<br/>
<br/>
Also, where were the Tsutsui's primary holdings? I<br/>
have come across some info that points to holdings in<br/>
Northern Yamato.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747563238">Hi there<br/>
<br/>
This is a hard question but I will try to help you a little. <br/>
The Tsutsui were established in the province of Yamato this province <br/>
is traditionally where Nara was the old capital of Heian period. It <br/>
was close by to the capital and thus was important to protect the <br/>
Shogun and the emperor. The Ashikaga were shoguns in control during <br/>
the early Sengoku period, they retained control until 1573 when <br/>
Nobunaga marched into Kyoto. It is a complicated area, as the Miyoshi <br/>
and Matsunaga clans + Hatakeyama, Hosokawa, Rokkaku all were <br/>
competing for land and power. The Tsuitsui had to resist all these <br/>
efforts, but in 1568 when Nobunaga entered the Kinai region he allied <br/>
with him, and became daimyou of the Yamato territory. As regards to <br/>
his retainers, their is not much info as to many but Shima Sakon is <br/>
well known a retainer of Tsutsui Junkei's later became one of <br/>
Ishida's lieutenants for Sekigahara.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I knew more, but can't think of anymore, does this help?<br/>
I think you have to realise it won't be easy finding info about this <br/>
family unless you speak Japanese or find a good source book.</div>
