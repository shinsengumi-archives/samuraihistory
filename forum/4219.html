       Actually, Nate, the book wasn't bad.  But get the Norton Paperback <br/>
version.  From what I understand, it's the first American edition to include the <br/>
entire book.  For some reason known only to God Himself, the FIRST American <br/>
edition (the one Kubrick's adaptation is based on) left off the last chapter.<br/>
       I did rent Kubrick's ACO for my dad when I worked there, but he didn't <br/>
care for it.  As I said, not being a movie fan (aside from the occasional), <br/>
I've not seen it, but I may buy the DVD someday just to have it.  And who <br/>
knows, I may watch it someday.  :-)  And even like it as much as the book.  :-)<br/>
