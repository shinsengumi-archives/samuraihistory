<h3>Samurai William</h3>
by <i>cebrann</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-93469060">Some time ago I posted in this forum a comment about the book/movie, <br/>
Shogun. I recalled that on one of my trips to Japan, a hill, (I <br/>
believe it was in Kyushu.), was pointed out to me as being Pilot <br/>
Hill, named after Anjin-San. At that time it was my distinct <br/>
impression that the English pilot in Shogun was based on fact. <br/>
Someone, I do not recall who, said they thought it was strictly <br/>
fiction.<br/>
<br/>
I finally was able to get my hands on "Samurai William" a history <br/>
book by Giles Milton. This book left no doubt that not only did Anjin-<br/>
San exist as a real person, but that James Clavell covered the <br/>
important events of William Adams experience with remarkable accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
Should any of you not have read it, I highly recommend doing so, as <br/>
it does a wonderfull job of discussing events during many years of <br/>
Tokunaga Ieyasu's "rein" (It goes beyond that into the rein of <br/>
Ieyasu's son Hidetada, but I haven't finished the book yet so do not <br/>
know how far it extends.<br/>
<br/>
The number of events of historical accuracy are many and so far I <br/>
have only found two significant departures from history.<br/>
<br/>
Events of historical accuracy include:<br/>
<br/>
1. Adam's was an English "pilot" (navigator) on board a Dutch Ship.<br/>
2. He was indeed made Samurai and Hatamoto, not just the first <br/>
foreigner to be so honored, but the first person, not trained in "the <br/>
way of the Sword" to be so honored.<br/>
3. Adams early enemy was indeed a specific Jesuit priest whose <br/>
personality was virtually identical to that displayed by the movie <br/>
Jesuit. This priest did indeed act as interpreter in Adam's first <br/>
meeting with the Shogun, and Adam's did tell Ieyasu that the Priest <br/>
was his enemy. What was less clear in the movie was that Adam's <br/>
eventually learned the Japanese languge well enough that he replaced <br/>
the jesuit as Ieyasu's interpreter.<br/>
<br/>
There are numerous other instances of historical accuracy but let me <br/>
now turn to two inaccuracies.<br/>
<br/>
1. There was apparently no Lady Mariko. Adams did marry a Japanese <br/>
woman, (making him a bigamist as he had a wife and daughter in <br/>
England.) He had two children with his Japanese wife. But his wife <br/>
was not  of a noble family, although her father did have a position <br/>
of some importance.<br/>
2. Ieyasu did not have Anjin-San's ships destroyed to keep him in <br/>
Japan. To the contrary he had Adam's build two ships, one an 80 ton <br/>
vessel and the other a 120 ton vessel.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that Adam's was refused persmission to leave Japan for 15 <br/>
years, but Ieyasu eventually relented and gave permission for him to <br/>
leave. This was done shortly after the first English ship arrived in <br/>
Japan. Adam's was prepared to return home on the ship, but quickly <br/>
found the Captain to be such a "jerk" that he decided he prefered to <br/>
stay in Japan to spending a year aboard a ship with the idiot.<br/>
<br/>
This Captain was immediately a odds with Adam's. Although he had no <br/>
experience what ever in Japan he continually disregarded Adam's <br/>
advice and made a great deal of trouble for himself and his success <br/>
in so doing.<br/>
<br/>
Much more recently history repeated when I was "presented" with a <br/>
boss who also had no exprerience what so ever in foreign countries, <br/>
(at that time I had 10 years experience), and he also failed to <br/>
follow my advice, eventually losing a lot of international business.<br/>
<br/>
There are also interesting tidbits about the real Anjin-San's <br/>
experience not covered in the book or movie. Adam's influence with <br/>
the Shogun may well have played a role in the Shogun's eventual <br/>
decision to ban Christian's from Japan. This apparently applied <br/>
mostly to Roman Catholics who were indeed enemy to England.<br/>
<br/>
This in turn led to the last major war when Osaka Castle, under <br/>
Hideyori, became a refuge for disaffected Christians. That battle <br/>
pitted 180,000 troops under Ieyasu against Hideyori and 120,000 <br/>
troops, with the added benefit of the impregnable Osaka castle. <br/>
Ieyasu won.<br/>
<br/>
I am finding Samurai William to be an excellent and facinating book <br/>
and recommend it to all who are interested in that period of Japanese <br/>
history. I have read quite a bit about Tokunaga Shogun, but only in <br/>
this book have I actually found a physical description of the man. <br/>
(In his later years he became too fat to mount a horse).</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, there are piles of them -- mostly in the interests of making a novel<br/>
that would be marketable and appeal in the West. See below for the biggest (and<br/>
one of the ones that explain much as to why the Japanese were ambivalent about<br/>
the book.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3. Adams early enemy was indeed a specific Jesuit priest whose<br/>

><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hardly. Joao Rodriguez was a key interpreter -- and quite possibly the best<br/>
foreign speaker of Japanese in this time frame -- but he was by no means the<br/>
only one. There were, by the early 1620s, many Japanese who had had training at<br/>
one of the Jesuit seminaries but left them, and any of them could have done<br/>
interpretation -- as well as any number of non-seminary-trained samurai who'd<br/>
been educated in the Portuguese and Spanish languages just for that purpose (as<br/>
would later happen to those who were taught Dutch).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>
> There are numerous other instances of historical accuracy but let me<br/>

><br/>
> 1. There was apparently no Lady Mariko.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, there was. An incredibly famous woman who is still highly regarded in<br/>
Japanese historical circles. Her name was Hosokawa Gracia, the Christian<br/>
daughter of Akechi Mitsuhide (Akechi Jinsai in the book, assassin of the<br/>
dictator Goroda, the novel's version of Oda Nobunaga), wife of Hosokawa Tadaoki<br/>
(Buntaro), and daughter-in-law of Hosokawa Fujitaka (Hiromatsu).<br/>
<br/>
She was held hostage by Ishida Mitsunari (Ishido) in his castle, and committed<br/>
suicide and burned her home down (with her in it) to prevent Ishida from being<br/>
able to hold her prisoner to keep her husband from acting.<br/>
<br/>
That such a high-born lady would have had an affair with a foreigner like<br/>
"Anjin" was an affront to Japanese sensibilities of propriety. It is the<br/>
greatest historical inaccuracy -- or rather, the most obvious fiction created --<br/>
in the book.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Adam's influence with<br/>

><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hardly. There was much more to it than the piddling influence Adams was able to<br/>
create. Most critical, possibly, was the San Felipe Incident, and as likely the<br/>
personality of Coelho the head of the Jesuit Mission in Japan, who liked to show<br/>
off Portugal's military might to impress the Japanese. The ultimate end was the<br/>
fact that the Catholics wouldn't lend the shogunate ships to attack Shimabara<br/>
and the Christians holed up in there; neither would the British. The Dutch,<br/>
however, more interested in trade than in souls, gave the bakufu whatever they<br/>
needed, thus securing their position as "foreigners we can work with."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You're conflating Shimabara and Osaka. Different campaigns.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-766667439">Okay, I held my comments until I finished the book.<br/>
<br/>
Observation #1: Milton obviously did an excellent job<br/>
doing the research on the letters, accounts, etc., of<br/>
the European travelers who made it to Japan. What is<br/>
equally obvious is that he didn't do nearly as much<br/>
research about Japan itself, especially the background<br/>
of what was going on in the country during the time<br/>
Adams, et al were there. Several places he obviously<br/>
takes what was written in the letters by Europeans as<br/>
the facts about Japanese politics of the time, when<br/>
really they were not accurate at all--kind of like me<br/>
trying to describe the politics of South Korea, in<br/>
which I live, but don't speak the language, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Observation #2: MUST he refer to things as if he's a<br/>
16th century European himself? I thought I was going<br/>
to puke if I read "scimitar" describing a katana one<br/>
more time. "Scimitar"? We couldn't just say "sword"?<br/>
It didn't have enough "period" flavor, I suppose. And<br/>
how hard would it have been to use the JAPANESE names<br/>
(since, in actuality, they were their names) for<br/>
Japanese historical figures, and not the stupid "King<br/>
Foyne", "Matinga", etc.? Beyond the fact that I have<br/>
no idea how phonetically challenged the English must<br/>
have been at this time for them to come up with those,<br/>
it just HURT reading that. Like when people pronounce<br/>
my favorite restaurant in Sierra Vista, AZ, which is<br/>
Tanuki, as "Ta NOOOO ki". AARRGH.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough of that--overall I thought it was very<br/>
informative, and fairly well done except for my petty<br/>
gripes above. Worth reading as long as one understands<br/>
not to take what Milton writes as a history of Japan<br/>
during that time, but a history of the Europeans in<br/>
Japan, told COMPLETELY through their eyes. <br/>
