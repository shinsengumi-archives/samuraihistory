<h3>hanzo Hattori</h3>
by <i>umaryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-214473081">Hi <br/>
<br/>
hanzo hattori did not use women in any way.<br/>
<br/>
He was a senior advisor regrading Ninja style<br/>
activities to Tokugawa ieyasu<br/>
<br/>
this is what I have on Hanzo Hattori<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo Hattori came from the Kamihattori branch of the<br/>
Hattori family. It is not fully known if he came from<br/>
the Heitaro or the Chigachi line (another branch of<br/>
the Kamihattori family).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the<br/>
three branches of the Hattori family dispersed to<br/>
different area's of Japan. The Kamihattori fled to<br/>
Nagaoka in Echigo Hattori Masanari, and his son <br/>
Hattori Hanzo (both from the Kamihattori), swore<br/>
allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while working for<br/>
the Tokugawa held the rank of 'Shinobi Metsuke', and<br/>
he had served Ieyasu's grandfather Matsudaira<br/>
Kiyoyasu. Hanzo later, with a friend, Shiro Tarao who<br/>
was a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa Ieyasu flee across<br/>
Japan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely,<br/>
utilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting up<br/>
special defensive formations along the road, and by<br/>
using Ninja methods of running. This all helped the<br/>
Tokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. The Hattori<br/>
were not "Watari Ninja" (Ninja who moved around from<br/>
one Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the<br/>
Tokugawa, and remained in their service for many<br/>
generations.<br/>
<br/>
When Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at<br/>
night, Hanzo was young man of 16 years. For the skills<br/>
that he used during the battle, he earned himself a<br/>
commendation. He was given the name "Hanzo the Ghost".<br/>
Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the<br/>
province of Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in<br/>
use. In his later years Hanzo was also known as "Hanzo<br/>
the great lancer" (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai,<br/>
and then came to be known as "Hattori Hanzo Iwami no<br/>
Kami".<br/>
<br/>
At one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him,<br/>
each held the rank of Doshin. He developed problems<br/>
with these Ninja and he found it difficult to control<br/>
them, and he relieved them of their services. He then<br/>
employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in<br/>
his life, he became a Monk.<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo Hattori was so famous that in the province of<br/>
Mikawa songs were written about him<br/>
<br/>
Some say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th<br/>
December 1596, while trying to bring the Ninja of the<br/>
Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must be wrong as Hanzo<br/>
helped Ieyasu in the early 1600"s. The story of his<br/>
death says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding<br/>
teeth), and his Fuma Ryu originally came from<br/>
Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and his men chased the<br/>
Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf of<br/>
Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of<br/>
water, and several swam under water, and began<br/>
dismantling the rudders of the boats belonging to<br/>
Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo's men<br/>
decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by<br/>
shore. When they entered the water, they discovered<br/>
that the water was covered with oil. To which the Fuma<br/>
Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the Tokugawa<br/>
Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>

<br/>
also look at some of the bujinkan sites with history<br/>
info www.hanako.co.uk is a start for you<br/>
<br/>
Turnbull recently wrote a book titled 'Ninja AD<br/>
1460-1650'. My personal impression of this book is<br/>
that he is using material that was circulated in the<br/>
mid 1980's and has since been dispelled as crap. I<br/>
remember rading and hearing this sort of stuff when I<br/>
started training in the Bujinkan in 1985, we have<br/>
moved on by Turnbull hasnt.<br/>
<br/>
But saying this I would recommend the book before<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319676166">Hey- thanx heaps. Did Hanzo have a nephew (or uncle) known as the demon Hanzo or is that a mistranslation of Ghost? I know there are very subtle differences in the Japanese language and Demon does not neccessarily  imply Evil.In the Shinto faith there seem to be about a million Demons or spirits for every thing under the sun. Was the Iga Ryu ever formally known as the Shadows of Iga or is that a modern group-I know they exist now as a self defence school decended from Steven Hayes..............I understand that Women were used at some point in Intelligence and "informant" type positions- when did that start?(If I am correct)  thanx - EJ  <br/>

Tokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. The Hattori<br/>
were not "Watari Ninja" (Ninja who moved around from<br/>
one Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the<br/>
Tokugawa, and remained in their service for many<br/>
generations.<br/>
<br/>
When Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at<br/>
night, Hanzo was young man of 16 years. For the skills<br/>
that he used during the battle, he earned himself a<br/>
commendation. He was given the name "Hanzo the Ghost".<br/>
Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the<br/>
province of Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in<br/>
use. In his later years Hanzo was also known as "Hanzo<br/>
the great lancer" (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai,<br/>
and then came to be known as "Hattori Hanzo Iwami no<br/>
Kami".<br/>
<br/>
At one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him,<br/>
each held the rank of Doshin. He developed problems<br/>
with these Ninja and he found it difficult to control<br/>
them, and he relieved them of their services. He then<br/>
employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in<br/>
his life, he became a Monk.<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo Hattori was so famous that in the province of<br/>
Mikawa songs were written about him<br/>
<br/>
Some say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th<br/>
December 1596, while trying to bring the Ninja of the<br/>
Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must be wrong as Hanzo<br/>
helped Ieyasu in the early 1600"s. The story of his<br/>
death says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding<br/>
teeth), and his Fuma Ryu originally came from<br/>
Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and his men chased the<br/>
Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf of<br/>
Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of<br/>
water, and several swam under water, and began<br/>
dismantling the rudders of the boats belonging to<br/>
Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo's men<br/>
decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by<br/>
shore. When they entered the water, they discovered<br/>
that the water was covered with oil. To which the Fuma<br/>
Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the Tokugawa<br/>
Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944807599">I should also add that "Hanzo" was both men's given<br/>
names--not their family names. There is no relation<br/>
between myself and Nathan Lane, the actor, for<br/>

related. If it was a Hattori Hanzo and a Hattori Jubei<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] hanzo Hattori</h3>
by <i>umaryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-776921563">HI<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo himself was known as hanzo the ghost.<br/>
<br/>
The Shodows of Iga was  foundeed in the late 70's or<br/>
early 80's by Stve Hayes. This was the first<br/>
organisation he started in the USA as part of the<br/>
Bujinkan Dojo. In Japan the Bujinkan Dojo is headed by<br/>
Hatsumi Masaaki who claims 34th Soke of Togakure ryu<br/>
Ninjutsu.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with Togakure Ryu is that until the last<br/>
soke (Takamatsu Toshitsugu) it was classed as Kuden.<br/>
this means nothing was written down, all passed by<br/>
word of mouth from one generation to the next.<br/>
Takamatsu was thre first we know to write down the<br/>
forms. Even within the Bujinkan Dojo many non-japanese<br/>
doubt the true origins of the school. he Togakure Ryu<br/>
contains Taijutsu (jujutsu style waza), Biken (sword),<br/>
Shinobi Gaeshi (escapes) Gotonpo (escapes using the 5<br/>
elements). Togakure Ryu videos can be obtained from<br/>
www.ninjutsu.com and www.jinenkan.com. As far as I<br/>
know apart form the current soke there are only two<br/>
others with menkyo kaiden (Manaka and Tanemura).<br/>
<br/>
As for the use of women. Mochizuki Chiyome wife of<br/>
Mochizuki Moritoki  (died in 1561) used miko (shrine<br/>
attendants) to gather informaton from passing samurai.<br/>
Most probably gathered by means of pillow talk.<br/>

Hey- thanx heaps. Did Hanzo have a nephew (or uncle)<br/>
known as the demon Hanzo or is that a mistranslation<br/>

the Japanese language and Demon does not neccessarily <br/>

a million Demons or spirits for every thing under the<br/>

<br/>
hanzo hattori did not use women in any way.<br/>
<br/>
He was a senior advisor regrading Ninja style<br/>
activities to Tokugawa ieyasu<br/>
<br/>
this is what I have on Hanzo Hattori<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo Hattori came from the Kamihattori branch of the<br/>
Hattori family. It is not fully known if he came from<br/>
the Heitaro or the Chigachi line (another branch of<br/>
the Kamihattori family).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the<br/>
three branches of the Hattori family dispersed to<br/>
different area's of Japan. The Kamihattori fled to<br/>
Nagaoka in Echigo Hattori Masanari, and his son <br/>
Hattori Hanzo (both from the Kamihattori), swore<br/>
allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while working for<br/>
the Tokugawa held the rank of 'Shinobi Metsuke', and<br/>
he had served Ieyasu's grandfather Matsudaira<br/>
Kiyoyasu. Hanzo later, with a friend, Shiro Tarao who<br/>
was a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa Ieyasu flee across<br/>
Japan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely,<br/>
utilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting up<br/>
special defensive formations along the road, and by<br/>
using Ninja methods of running. This all helped the<br/>
Tokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. The Hattori<br/>
were not "Watari Ninja" (Ninja who moved around from<br/>
one Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the<br/>
Tokugawa, and remained in their service for many<br/>
generations.<br/>
<br/>
When Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at<br/>
night, Hanzo was young man of 16 years. For the skills<br/>
that he used during the battle, he earned himself a<br/>
commendation. He was given the name "Hanzo the Ghost".<br/>
Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the<br/>
province of Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in<br/>
use. In his later years Hanzo was also known as "Hanzo<br/>
the great lancer" (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai,<br/>
and then came to be known as "Hattori Hanzo Iwami no<br/>
Kami".<br/>
<br/>
At one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him,<br/>
each held the rank of Doshin. He developed problems<br/>
with these Ninja and he found it difficult to control<br/>
them, and he relieved them of their services. He then<br/>
employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in<br/>
his life, he became a Monk.<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo Hattori was so famous that in the province of<br/>
Mikawa songs were written about him<br/>
<br/>
Some say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th<br/>
December 1596, while trying to bring the Ninja of the<br/>
Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must be wrong as Hanzo<br/>
helped Ieyasu in the early 1600"s. The story of his<br/>
death says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding<br/>
teeth), and his Fuma Ryu originally came from<br/>
Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and his men chased the<br/>
Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf of<br/>
Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of<br/>
water, and several swam under water, and began<br/>
dismantling the rudders of the boats belonging to<br/>
Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo's men<br/>
decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by<br/>
shore. When they entered the water, they discovered<br/>
that the water was covered with oil. To which the Fuma<br/>
Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the Tokugawa<br/>
Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Actual Oniwabanshuu history facts</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413878594">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I think the main problem is that most of what is known<br/>
as general facts about the ninja in th ewqest was<br/>
promoted by members of the Bujikan in the early 80's <br/>
- mis-translated from Japan, and also soe facts spread<br/>
that was obtained from manga. the you also have the<br/>
crap hollywood put out which people belived. Then 20<br/>
years later when some people have done serious<br/>
research to fix the problem you get sites like<br/>
www.entertheninja.com sprouting up and sites made by<br/>
15 year old school boy wannabe ninja's and every one<br/>
reads these and they must be real - I mean why would<br/>
any one make a false web page.<br/>
<br/>
The truth of the matter is Iga and Koga were the main<br/>
areas of development. some fo these 'clans' did sell<br/>
thesleves out per contract, then there were some<br/>
schools that were created within a samurai domain and<br/>
was either made up of samurai or peasents. picked for<br/>
certain skills they had or were told to develop. many<br/>
of these schools survived for several generation many<br/>
were only in existance for a small number of years. <br/>
<br/>
some of them did have codes of ethics, some didnt.<br/>
some used there skills to be cat burglers, after all<br/>
some ninjutsu skills required the skill to enter a<br/>
building and escape unseen. Then you have the ninja<br/>
that were information gatherers. Kagemusha by kurosawa<br/>
is a great film to see this. there is a scene where 3<br/>
men are watching the samurai army. All dressed in<br/>
common every day cloths watching from a distance. all<br/>
from different clans. some of these guys couldnt even<br/>
fight properly other than the same skills of the<br/>
everyday man or samurai. and before any one asks.<br/>
Ninja did not run around wearing black suits with<br/>
masks. That is a Meiji period Myth.<br/>
<br/>
Look at a street scene out of a kurosawa movie.<br/>
Imagine someone dressed in pure black in the middle of<br/>
that. he would be as moticeable as if he were naked.<br/>
the men in kagemusha are a good example of the way<br/>
Ninja dresssed.<br/>
<br/>
Some records by ninja have survived - Shoninki -<br/>
Ninpiden - Bansenshukai. Translation example are<br/>
available from www.ninpo.org<br/>

Weren't some ninja's (shinobi?) servants of hans? And<br/>
they weren't <br/>
all bad were they? They had a code of ethics, I mean,<br/>
not engagment-<br/>
wise, but they're based around a type of<br/>
militia/guerilla tactics. <br/>
Generally speaking, I don't think all samurai were<br/>
honorable either. <br/>
I'm sure there must have been a handful of "dirty"<br/>

<h3>Re: Actual Oniwabanshuu history facts</h3>
by <i>shogunmasami</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532918579">I was just stating that generally (in most cases, but not all) <br/>
samurai and ninjas didn't get along. And I didn't mean to paint a <br/>
picture that ALL Samurai were honorable and followed Bushido, many <br/>
were "dirty" samurai, whether they were ronin-criminals, or high <br/>
ranking corrupt officials. But most samurai followed Bushido and <br/>
were the "ideal" samurai most think of today. I also didn't mean to <br/>
say ALL ninjas were underhanded, deceitful, and un-honorable. But <br/>
most samurai thought this, hence most were "bitter enemies" with <br/>
ninjas.  Now we all know that ninjas were employed by samurai, and <br/>
if they did have some kind of code they followed (anyone know the <br/>
name?) they were still cast in a negative light by samurai, for <br/>
instance if a ninja was sent to assassinate someone, they would <br/>
certainly seek up on the victim and quietly dispose of him, which is <br/>
quite understandable. However this goes against Bushido, you should <br/>
declare your presence, challenge your opponent, then fight him in <br/>
one-on-one combat.  <br/>
<br/>
I am also sure ninjas casted samurai in a negative light as well. <br/>
Generally ninjas were not of samurai class, (anyone know any <br/>
exceptions?) they were made up of the other classes, since they <br/>
couldn't become samurai, they trained and became ninjas instead, and <br/>
I'm sure being oppressed by the samurai class led to animosity <br/>
towards them, therefore once again, "bitter enemies."<br/>

<br/>
one reason they didnt wear black was because it shows<br/>
up at night.<br/>
<br/>
try it get someone to wear jet black cloths in the dea<br/>
dof night and you can actually see them.<br/>
<br/>
according to shoninki or ninpiden (I foget which) the<br/>
favoured colours for night work was red, green and<br/>
grey. these are more natural colours and more common<br/>
to every day life in japan.<br/>

So when ninja went to kill someone they just dressed<br/>
with normal <br/>
kimonos? Sorry, I have been corrupted by the<br/>
"westernization" of <br/>
ninja, that's why I ask...although, now that I think<br/>
of it, the Oniwa <br/>
Banshuu in "Rurouni Kenshin" did dress "normally" (if<br/>
the Gambit coat <br/>
that Aoshi used can pass as "normal")...<br/>

This ninja stuff is certainly interesting, I would<br/>

This again is a fiction!<br/>

If you're a spy, you don't exactly go around carrying a sign that says "Ninja" <br/>

<br/>
Samurai and Ninja were co-workers, both doing the work of their lords.<br/>
<br/>
Ninja were often from samurai families and there was little if any animosity <br/>
because most of the time the samurai, and in some cases even individual ninja, <br/>
didn't know who else in their lord's employ were actually ninja!<br/>
<br/>
Most Samurai knew that their lords employed ninjas, but they rarely if ever <br/>
knew who the ninja(s) were. They could be anyone from a lowly kitchen worker, <br/>
to a fully ranked and privleged Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
For a historical example of how ninja and samurai worked, read the book "Taiko" <br/>
it contains fairly accurate accounts of how ninja and samurai worked together.<br/>
<br/>
FYI: Ninja rarely if ever wore outfits like the movies show them wearing. They <br/>
simply dressed like everyone else did.<br/>

I am also sure ninjas casted samurai in a negative light as well. <br/>
Generally ninjas were not of samurai class, (anyone know any <br/>
exceptions?) they were made up of the other classes, since they <br/>
couldn't become samurai, <br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
Otamo no Saijin, Saburo Yoshimori, Kusunoki, Togakure Daisuke II aka. Minamoto no Kanesada, Hattori Hanzo and so on... There used to be 45-66 shinobi families (22? Ryuha's) in Iga area and 53 families (6? Ryuha's) in souhern Shiga (Koga) area, most of them from buke glass. And also there was many other families/ ryu's (69-73), in other locations (17+) .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241192536">Very much so. Ninja that did their job well were never heard about or<br/>
discovered.<br/>
<br/>
There's also this big misconception that Ninja clans were organized and out<br/>
in the open. While one can point to the historical existence of the Iga and<br/>
Kaga, the majority of what we call ninja today often learned their skills<br/>
from other family members, passing them down from generation to generation.<br/>
<br/>
There's also the terms themselves "Ninja" and "Shinobi" in reality both were<br/>
really generic terms that meant pretty much the same thing - Spy.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing mystical or magical about ninja. They simply were everyday<br/>
people who acted as scouts and spies. Some had formal training, some didn't.<br/>
<br/>
In fact the last known historically accurate account of a "Ninja" mission<br/>
involved a ninja trying sneaking onto a portugese ship in order to steal<br/>
what were thought to be invasion or battle plans. While the ninja was<br/>
successful in sneaking in and off the ship, when he presented the "battle<br/>
plans" to his lord, it turned out that he had swiped the galley menu for the<br/>
week...<br/>

<br/>
No, No, No!<br/>
<br/>
This again is a fiction!<br/>
<br/>
If you're a spy, you don't exactly go around carrying a sign that says "Ninja" <br/>
and then complain to the "Ninja Union" when the samurai make fun of <br/>
your "pajamas".<br/>
<br/>
Samurai and Ninja were co-workers, both doing the work of their lords.<br/>
<br/>
Ninja were often from samurai families and there was little if any animosity <br/>
because most of the time the samurai, and in some cases even individual ninja, <br/>
didn't know who else in their lord's employ were actually ninja!<br/>
<br/>
Most Samurai knew that their lords employed ninjas, but they rarely if ever <br/>
knew who the ninja(s) were. They could be anyone from a lowly kitchen worker, <br/>
to a fully ranked and privleged Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
For a historical example of how ninja and samurai worked, read the book "Taiko" <br/>
it contains fairly accurate accounts of how ninja and samurai worked together.<br/>
<br/>
FYI: Ninja rarely if ever wore outfits like the movies show them wearing. They <br/>
simply dressed like everyone else did.<br/>
