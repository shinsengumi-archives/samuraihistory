<h3>Daimyo standards and warrior sashimonos?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-409734163">I have a question about the Daimyo's standards and the retainers <br/>
sashimono. Would the colour of the sashimono for his samurai and <br/>
ashigaru generally be the colour of the lord's banner? Ex. For Takeda <br/>
who had a red banner with black symbol, would his followers have the <br/>
Taekda black lozenge on a red background?<br/>
<br/>
Who else would have a Takeda lozenge mon? Any direct family member <br/>
but with a background colour as per the lord's banner? I have a print <br/>
of a Takeda army crossing a river with Shingen's men having white <br/>
backround on their mon with a red symbol. Also present are men in <br/>
another area that have a white background with a black lozenge. Are <br/>
these men from a different Takeda general????????<br/>
<br/>
Would the mon of Takeda's 24 generals ashigaru and samurai be a <br/>
Takeda mon or something similar to the specific general's mon?</div>
