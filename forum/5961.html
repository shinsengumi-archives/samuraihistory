<div id="ygrps-yiv-575631097"><blockquote><span title="ireply">> Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just back from a long trip away, including a quick visit to Japan on the <br/>
way home. Found over 600 messages in the inbox, mostly from this <br/>
group. <br/>
<br/>
Tom (Helm), I got quite intrigued by Keiki and went to Shizuoka on his <br/>
trail. I don't know how much time he could spare communing with the <br/>
spirit of his ancestor, considering how occupied he was with his <br/>
hobbies of photography, cycling and so on, and his three wives and <br/>
dozens of children. It is fascinating to reflect on what a modern <br/>
personality Keiki seems; less than ten years after the assassination of Ii <br/>
Naosuke by the Mito ronin (surely an archetypal feudal event!) Keiki has <br/>
abdicated and retired to live an apparently serene and blameless life. <br/>
<br/>
Tom (Davidson) Don't know if you have done your research trip yet, but <br/>
if you are in or near Nagoya there are some good atmospheric places <br/>
within easy reach by train.<br/>
<br/>
The Kiso valley: you can walk on the old Nakasendo from Magome to <br/>
Tsumago. Gives a very good feel of travel in the Edo period ( I know it's <br/>
later than your era but the mountains etc are unchanged!) Narai is a <br/>
very unspoiled small town.<br/>
<br/>
Kanazawa: apart from the gardens (very beautiful) lots of atmosphere. <br/>
<br/>
Inuyama: everyone's favourite castle<br/>
<br/>
In Nagoya the Tokugawa Art Museum has a good collection of <br/>
artefacts, clothes, weapons etc, mainly from the highest ranks of <br/>
society. Not much here on how the poor folk lived.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in Kansai the Osaka Museum of History is excellent for an <br/>
overview of lifestyles throughout Japanese history. And I found Hikone <br/>
castle and museum particularly inspiring (maybe because I was there in <br/>
a Kurosawa-esque downpour)<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto is unparalleled - but overwhelming on a short trip. Some of the <br/>
older towns particularly on the Japan sea (Hagi, Matsue) are easier to <br/>
take in. But I found the Kyoto Musuem of Traditional Crafts again very <br/>
good for lifestyles.<br/>
<br/>
There are many places in rural Japan (in my case Yamaguchi-ken) <br/>
where an insignificant sign saying something like "remains of castle" <br/>
will take you to some stones on a hill top or the head of a valley where <br/>
a 15th c castle once stood. It gives you a good sense of the defensive <br/>
use of the terrain. Unforgettable. So it's a good idea to base yourself <br/>
for a few days in the country and hike or bike around.<br/>

<br/>
No, the trip hasn't happened yet, and a recent redundancy would<br/>
signify some postponement.<br/>
<br/>
On the upside, snippets such as yours (and others here) is just the<br/>
sort of stuff I've catalogued towards the great day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for that.<br/>
