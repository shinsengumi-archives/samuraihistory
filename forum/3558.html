<div id="ygrps-yiv-601888631">I think that the Imperial staff has already said that.  I certainly <br/>
hope that the Emperor doesn't waste his time on this loser.  When the <br/>
truth comes out, I'd expect that dork to lie about some other claim <br/>
to fame.  Maybe he was dubbed a Conquistador by the King of Spain <br/>
too.<br/>
