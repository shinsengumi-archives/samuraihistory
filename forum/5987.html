There's some 30,000 current active members within the SCA not to mention <br/>
associate people (non paid) - whom I was for 5 years (currently an active 'paid' <br/>
member for 2 years) - along with another couple of thousand folks who are semi <br/>
active but not current. Which would make the SCA one of the (if not the) <br/>
largest re-enactment societies with a world wide base. I would hazard to guess that <br/>
the UK Sealed Knot and other English Civil War Societies would be next at <br/>
6,000 actives (including children).<br/>
<br/>
Being in the SCA is similiar to most other re-enactment societies or groups <br/>
with an opportunity to 'recreate' living history - in combat, day to day <br/>
living, etc.<br/>
And I would also guess based on personal experience with others both on and <br/>
off this list - that many people have 'explored' one or more 'personas' with in <br/>
the SCA - being myself both interested in western and eastern culture.<br/>
As a member of the SCA - I've been able to actively pursue (with others of <br/>
similiar interest)- blacksmithing, armoursmithing, period woodworking, heavy <br/>
combat, leatherworking, archery, casting, and more....<br/>
<br/>
If you have some real interest in the SCA you can get some answers at <br/>
www.sca.org - or search for a local group in your area.<br/>

I don't think she was asking for a history of the SCA.<br/>
Her question was about how many of "you", meaning, I<br/>

Giving her the numbers of how many people are in the<br/>

question. She didn't ask how many people were in the<br/>
SCA. She asked how many people on this list were in<br/>
the SCA. And while you may not have given the full<br/>
history of the SCA, you certainly gave a dissertation<br/>
on it's international scope and size. Not relevant to<br/>
the question. It may appear redundant that I made the<br/>
clarification after another poster also pointed it<br/>
out, but I will point out that I can only read one<br/>
email at a time. Yours came first. I answered it. Then<br/>
eventually I got to the email where the other<br/>
individual also clarified it. So you got clarification<br/>
twice. Some would think that a blessing, and move on. <br/>

I do appreciate your taking the time for such a detailed reply.........   and I have noted that people who 'play' or do reenactments <br/>
seem to have a different perspective on history that do people who don't.  Many I have spoken with, or read their articles seem more <br/>
grounded and comprehending of --- oh, how shall I say it---  how the political, religious, and social milieus affected daily like, <br/>
and in turn,  how those things affected regional and ultimately global politics.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad to say that my own study of Japan and from an SCA perspective is having a positive effect on my own martial training, and <br/>
daily life.  It's a very curious process to me, and I am also curious how others approach history and how, if at all, it affects how <br/>

 My original question wasn't answered in quite the way I wanted, but I got more information than I had previously.  My perception is <br/>
that I could have asked a better question to begin with ---- but then perhaps I would have missed out on something else.<br/>
<br/>
Not to worry.  I'm happy and playful tonight.  Spent two hours at iaido tonight and eased on into a wonderful place in my head.<br/>

I scrolled back through the previous post to notate whether in response to<br/>
the intial query if you addressed it or simply applied your assistance to<br/>
'correcting' - from me what 'imho' was an honest answer to what I assumed was an<br/>
honest question (the intial inquiry).<br/>
<br/>
In your correction you point out that I offered more information than was<br/>
required and in doing so overstated your 'clarification' by saying that she<br/>
didn't 'need' a history of the sca.<br/>
<br/>
What's amusing to me is that your incorrect in your generalization about<br/>
correcting me about mine. I hope my finding that funny puts me in good company:)<br/>

most Americans ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's certainly fun to study and some of the most fun my friends and I <br/>
had were playing with science fiction cultures trying to come up with <br/>
methods of describing interactions and effects in some objective <br/>
fashion. One good effect that Marx and others had on the study of <br/>
history is that numbers are important as well, adding to the study of <br/>
history a different perspective from the lifestyles of the rich and <br/>
famous. Fernand Braudel's books are a good example of this. I hope that <br/>
one day there is the equivalent type of book for Asian studies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >I am glad to say that my own study of Japan and from an SCA perspective is having a positive effect on my own martial training, and daily life.
