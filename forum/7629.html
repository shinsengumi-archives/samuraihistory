<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943154012">To anyone who might be interested in the life of Miyamoto Musashi. Just type <br/>
in "Miyamoto Musashi" into Google or any other search engine. You will come up <br/>
with some sites that offer historical information about his life. They are <br/>
varied and you simply have to use your logic to figure out which ones make the <br/>
most sense after reading several of them. <br/>
<br/>
You can even read Miyamoto's own version of his life in his "Book Of Five <br/>
Rings." Which is widely available, translated into several languages. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of individuals, this is one individual whose life fascinates me.<br/>
