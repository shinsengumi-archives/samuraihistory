demanding, say practitioners <br/>

The sign of respect signals the start of Kendo practice for the <br/>
Maltby Middle School seventh-grader. <br/>
<br/>
Minutes later, DeBruhl, 12, is in full attack mode, dishing out <br/>
blows to his opponent's head with his bokken, a bamboo stick used <br/>
for practice. DeBruhl appears tiny next to the bulking size of his <br/>
sparring partner - his tall, lanky father, Perry DeBruhl. <br/>
<br/>
As the two take turns trading blows in traditional forms of Kendo <br/>
called kata, Perry stops his son for a quick pointer. <br/>
<br/>
"Don't pull off (during your strike). Go here,'' he says as he bangs <br/>
his bokken on Troy's head with aggressive precision. <br/>
<br/>
The DeBruhls are the only Livingston County connection to a small <br/>
band of loyalists in EMU's club called Kendo Dojo. Kendo, which <br/>
translates to "the way of the sword'' in Japanese, is the art of <br/>
samurai swordsmanship. People who practice the martial art say it's <br/>
both exhilarating and demanding to learn. <br/>
<br/>
According to the Web site, www.kendo-usa.org, modern Kendo has roots <br/>
with the samurai and evolved over several centuries. The <br/>
introduction of protective gear like the men (head gear), kote <br/>
(wrist) and doh (chest protector) during the late 18th century <br/>
allowed warriors to deliver full blows to one another without <br/>
injury. This forced the establishment of new regulations and <br/>
practice habits. <br/>
<br/>
Perry DeBruhl, who works at Home Depot in Brighton and attends EMU <br/>
to study construction management, became interested in the martial <br/>
arts as a U.S. Marine stationed in Okinawa, Japan, years ago. <br/>
DeBruhl, a black belt in tae kwon do, introduced Kendo to his son <br/>
after finding out about the club in the summer of 2003. Today, they <br/>
travel the Midwest, competing in tournaments together. <br/>
<br/>
To win a match, Kendo warriors must strike an opponent in either the <br/>
men (head), kote (wrist), belly (doh) or throat (tsuki) to score. <br/>
Not only must the warrior hit the correct spot, they must do so with <br/>
Zanshin or "zeal and intent'' by shouting the proper kiai, or war <br/>
cry, according to EMU assistant coach Charlie Kondek. <br/>
<br/>
Troy DeBruhl said the most challenging parts of Kendo are learning <br/>
the footwork and war cries. He enjoys it so much, he did a science <br/>
project at Maltby about it. <br/>
<br/>
"It is the hardest sport and the most fun sport I've ever tried,'' <br/>
he said. <br/>
<br/>
Although Kendo appears to be violent, Perry DeBruhl says the sport <br/>
teaches many lessons. He added without reigi - the force behind <br/>
Kendo etiquette - the sport "is just two people hitting each other <br/>
with sticks.'' <br/>
<br/>
"I enjoy the competition,'' he said. "There are a lot of lessons in <br/>
Kendo that you can learn in life - respect, courtesy and manners. <br/>
Once you've made the decision to attack, you have to commit your <br/>
heart and soul. You go 100 percent.'' <br/>
<br/>
In his Kendo garb, a blue robe, protective pads and black mask, <br/>
Perry DeBruhl is an imposing figure. He towers over most of the <br/>
others in the class. His ability to deliver down blows from above <br/>
has earned him the nickname the "blue bomber from Brighton.'' <br/>
<br/>
"Not only did Perry have prior athletic background, but with a <br/>
background in martial arts, he knew exactly what it took to <br/>
discipline himself (for Kendo),'' Kondek said. "He's come a long way <br/>
in a short time.'' <br/>
<br/>
The club's younger members, including Troy, have done well in <br/>
tournaments. "The youth in our club have put the adults to shame,'' <br/>
Kondek admitted. "Troy's picked it up quick.'' <br/>
<br/>
Troy said he loves battling his dad in practice, especially after a <br/>
little motivation from home. <br/>
<br/>
"I've had my PS/2 (video game) taken away, so I had reason for anger <br/>
about that,'' he said. "We do go at it pretty hard, and we always <br/>
talk about it afterwards.'' <br/>
<br/>
Perry DeBruhl said he will test to become a shodan, like a black <br/>
belt, at a tournament in Chicago in November. Troy said he can't <br/>
wait to move up in rank, so he can start teaching others. <br/>
<br/>
"There are a lot of people who come to Kendo from other martial <br/>
arts,'' Perry DeBruhl said. "The Japanese sword is a classic.''</div>
