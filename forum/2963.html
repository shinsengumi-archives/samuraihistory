What I experienced with western style sword trainning (fencing) and kendo,<br/>

I doubt very much the people who did such mockering concerning kendo and the<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945433548">1 million layers ?? That is (very) unlikely, since the tamahagane would<br/>
have had to be folded 20 or 21 times depending how you count. The point<br/>
being that everytime the steel is folded you are adding carbon (and<br/>
losing impurities), making it tougher / harder and thus more difficult<br/>
to fold each time, and making the swords cutting edge eventually more<br/>
brittle. (the inner core of a sword is not folded as often as the<br/>
outside 'skin' for this reason - keeping it simple). <br/>
<br/>
I believe you will find that the average no. Of times the outer steel is<br/>
folded will range from 12 - 16. Indicating just over 65.000 layers of<br/>
steel when folded 16 times.......... <br/>

Without being extreme and bringing in the "Mystical East," I believe <br/>
that it is  a matter of fact that in East Asia, people put more <br/>
emphasis on "focusing" than people in the West.<br/>
<br/>
We might have opened a huge can of worms here, but it's a very <br/>
fascination discussion, so, you all please throw on the table your <br/>
ideas and, even better, your experience.<br/>
<br/>
To keep it simple (for now) I believe you need a sharp steel, but a <br/>
sharp soul too. And besides that, you need a sharp soul to make sharp <br/>
steel (or to trim grass efficiently and elegantly).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  If that were true, all the stuff coming out of China wouldn't be junk. <br/>
I've also seen junk modern reproduction armour made in Japan.  That said <br/>
there is MORE of a tendency to take pride in your work simply for the sake <br/>
of doing your job well than you encounter in the West. There is more respect <br/>
for the craftsman. But a TRUE craftsman, whether it's swords, armour, <br/>
weaving, cooking, carpentry, even chadou FOCUSES. It is the MIND not the <br/>
soul. If you believe Robert Mcpherson or J.D. Hrosilous (sp?) don't focus at <br/>
the same level of armourers and swordsmiths in Japan you are sorely <br/>
mistaken. Also if you think the average Japanese focuses well you should see <br/>
all the idiots trying to ride bicycles while reading e-mail on thier keitai<br/>
  Perhaps this is because we DO tend to over-intellectualize things in the <br/>
West. My poor Japanese HAS forced me to use ishin denshin while studying <br/>
Kyuudo, but my focus is the same it has been for years while armouring or <br/>
training in different martial art systems.<br/>
  Side observation. It often seems that the people who believe (key word <br/>
believe) in the "Mystical East" are people who would LIKE to believe in <br/>
magic but have too much sense yet are too much of the romantic to give up <br/>
the idea that there is SOMETHING more so they transfer that desire to a far <br/>
distant and strange land. I undestand that hope. I shared it when I was much <br/>
younger, but I have travelled too much and seen too much to give it any <br/>
credence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206603915">Hi Michael <br/>
<br/>
I would not condemn ya for cepticism. <br/>
However in Japan (and there is not the only place), the conceptions of <br/>
spirituality is very different than in the Western World. <br/>
<br/>
They do not sepparate "material world" from "spiritual world". <br/>
All is same to them. <br/>
<br/>
So, to incorporate technique into the mind, heart or inner essence, is a <br/>
part of the standard procedures. <br/>
<br/>
In Karate, there is a several of standardized movements called Kata, and <br/>
sparring trainning called Kumite, however there is also a meditation to be <br/>
performed before do all of this. The effect of it was that, in time of need, <br/>
when some thugs attempted to assault me and take my money late at night, it <br/>
was just instinctive. I was not thinking in what do do if the thief do this <br/>
or that, or in technical therms when fighting for my life. Things just went <br/>
naturally before I even knew what was really happening and the thugs got out <br/>
of there, and I was no black belt, much less any kind of "super martial arts <br/>

Just an standard trainner as any other student. <br/>
<br/>
So, I know it is very far than what those of ancient called as "sharpness in <br/>

"magick" to perform that. LOL <br/>

  You merely prove my point. It is technique. Your technique and training <br/>
allowed you to rout the "thugs".<br/>
  As I've studied various martial arts  for over 20 years and unfortunately <br/>
needed to use them on occasion, I don't REALLY need an explanation of kata. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699340317">Kata can be interpreted as simulation actualizing<br/>
various scenarios of fighting. Kumite is also designed<br/>
to sharpen the real battle skill. <br/>
So, both of them are training methods to prepare for<br/>
real fight.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that we can judge the efficacy of either<br/>
method by quoting mere street fights although I admit<br/>
that there are some in street naturally born to be<br/>
good fighters. However, a better judgement can be made<br/>
if we consider who possible oppenents are for various<br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if someone needs to fight with Tyson, I<br/>
would recommend strenuous and rigorous training<br/>
combining both Kata and Kumite.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

                            Sincerely,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would recommend a .45 automatic if I were feeling sporting,  a slam <br/>
fire shotgun if I wasn't. No amount of exercise or training will let me <br/>
defeat somebody that good with bare hands. I doubt many on this group <br/>
would stand much of a chance. He's big, fast and trained, youch! Having <br/>
seen how fast a boxer can be, they are not to be taken lightly. Also <br/>
they might be sneaky and have studied other martial arts to improve <br/>
their boxing.<br/>
