<h3>New Sengoku Figures</h3>
by <i>William Letham</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060690085">Del Prado publishing is coming out with a new series of die cast samurai figures. The first one on sale this week is Maeda Toshie. The figure comes with a data file on each samurai, a year by year 'newsfile' of the sengoku era, and another pamphlet on differant aspects of the period, the first one is a guidebook to all the major battles. This is a series and will come out once a week, like the Visual Nihon Rekishi series. The idea is that you collect the files into a binder. I can't tell how many they have planned altogether, but they have planned at least 20. The next figure is Takeda Shingen, others on the way include Date Masamune, Uesugi Kenshin, II Naosuke, Sanada Yukimura and others. The man at the bookstore told me it depends on how successful the series is. The first one cost 950 yen. <br/>
