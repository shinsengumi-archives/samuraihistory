<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348675552">I think the true answer you all have been looking for as of late has eluded you, because everyone in the group has no idea what each other is saying.  Yes the Japanese people are not the society  they were a couple hundred years ago, and yes it is wrong to assume that all Korean's are crazy war-mongers, just as it is also absurd to assume the same thing about all Iraqi people.<br/>
The real issue at hand here is what is it to be a samurai in the modern age.   Well as it stands to be a true Samurai in the historical sense just is not possible, since we have left the dark ages long behind us and it is no longer nessecary to serve a Lord since feudalism is dead!  The only lord you need serve now is yourself.  Being a Samurai in the modern age is more of a philosophy  of living, your sword is your will and intellect, so use it, sharpen it and don' t dull it on mindless sense pleasures like television.  To be a Samurai means nothing more that to live a honorable live, respecting the honor and beauty of others and the world in which we live, while maintaning the ideal that a Samurai faces life head on and does not back down from anyone, anything, or any challenge.  <br/>
<br/>
ps. There has also been alot of talk about spelling and punctuation lately and I see no reason to complain about it.  Some members, I would assume are new to the english language and have yet  to master it, and some who are native to the language aren't as masterfull of their own language as they should be.  I guess what I am really saying is that like all things a Samurai does we should all work harder to master our writing like a Samurai would master a sword.<br/>
<br/>
A quote from the 'Hagakure' would sum this up beautifully<br/>
<br/>
A Samurai advances through each day, piling effort upon effort, becomong ever more skillfull, this is never ending.<br/>

<br/>
YO! Out there in SAMURAI WORLD? In Korea another dumb war, our unit <br/>
or at least some of us in a B.J.U.were trained and worked with two <br/>
Samurai in mind control and mental img. as we got to know each other <br/>
we learned these men for the last few 100years came from people who <br/>
were brought up from birth to do a job like most of us, they loved <br/>
each other and ladys also could control there minds to sit in winter <br/>
cold water in nothing on but undergarments for an hour or more. They <br/>
were probably good fighting men in the close arts of killing. but <br/>
they were men like all of us no more no less do not make somthing out <br/>
of them they were not? Kind of tunnel vis. like a monk with out being <br/>
limited to a monk's life style.<br/>
2003 WOW! the guy that lives with out a car prob. lives inner city i <br/>
have lot's on N.Y. friend's who have not had a car for 30 years do <br/>
you think a Samurai would not ride a horse because it poops on the <br/>
road? Or not get in a Jeep to go some were, or use some of our winter <br/>
gear when cold? You sound like the people that went back to mother <br/>
earth in the late 50 & 60 to live with out elec, grow, and kill there <br/>
own food i was there what a joke that was.Most lasted about 2to3 <br/>
weeks and a few 4to6months and back to MOM & DAD and $$$$.I work out <br/>
with some people that you might call 2003 Samurai they make a liveing <br/>
as body guards and teaching murk's. but when the go home they have a <br/>
comp, car, lights, and mybe a Big Mack WOW! You should do what my son <br/>
did when he was young, GO to CHINA and live at a monestery for a year <br/>
to learn healing with herbal healing and understaning life. OR for <br/>
the real SAMURAI out there go around the world as a pit fighter as <br/>
some of my friends have. [Live the good life with honor and careing <br/>
and be true to your self we are not and can never be Samurai! <br/>
Remember reading is not doing it's the problem in the U.S. to much <br/>
reading and liveing in ones mind, life is short go out and enjoy it.I <br/>
lived in Hong K.for 2 years in the 50's never saw any of the <br/>
Hollywood stuff that's out there.and very few have.In 50 Hong K. was <br/>
china today it's a shopping mall how sad. Cheers Joseph<br/>

I concur. People are just nuts. The Japanese aren't bushido-crazy <br/>
sword-carrying, Karate-chopping Kimono-wearers anymore (No matter <br/>
what your ninja master tells you) - if anything they are the somewhat <br/>
sad end result of 250 years of xenophobic self-isolation, and for the <br/>
most part have forgotten their past except for what shows up in the <br/>
history books or on the NHK Taiga dramas. Oops, probably stepped on <br/>

take me too seriously ;) <br/>

And as a side note, I'm starting to have trouble telling the <br/>

Okay, I'll concur. I've been mystified recently by the<br/>
horrible English, but haven't wanted to say anything<br/>
because I realize that not everyone on this list is a<br/>
native English speaker, and while I can make myself<br/>
somewhat coherent in Japanese, I'm by no means going<br/>
to appear on NHK any time soon. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the idea of "becoming" a samurai is as<br/>
ridiculous as the idea of "becoming" a Jedi or a<br/>
wizard or a klingon. <br/>

The forgotten were the protectors of the samurai way? <br/>
<br/>
It could be argued that those who were forgotten were<br/>
those who had deserted or been forced to remove<br/>
themselves from service, and thus became forgotten<br/>
outside the world of the written word, or legend.<br/>
Without providing their service, the term 'samurai'<br/>
becomes little more than a personal anachronism.<br/>
Service to oneself is not the way of the samurai. <br/>

Subject: Re: Samurai Life in 2003? maby in the mind?not in the real world<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I put my mind into what I'm writing and now I<br/>
need some help with Japanese legends, I live in the<br/>
real world but my mind wanders into the fantasy. I'm<br/>
writing a samurai legend and I'm still looking on the<br/>
Internet and I can't find what I'm looking for, were<br/>
there samurai that had legends written about them?"<br/>
