<h3>Hideyoshi&#39;s men</h3>
by <i>debunaru</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-108441352">Hi everybody. Few days ago I stated a question and there<br/>
was now feedback so I'll try to ask again and in different way. I'm<br/>
doing some research on Toyotomi Hideyoshi and I'd like to write<br/>
something about those men who helped him on his way. Undoubtedly he was<br/>
the warrior with great talent and he is the one who managed to rule the<br/>
whole country. But there were also some man who figured as advisors or<br/>
helped him or just acted in way, which gave Hideyoshi great chance to<br/>
accomplish his mission (for example Sakuma Morimasa). I don't think that<br/>
without those men, Hideyoshi won't be the ruler of Japan, but I just to<br/>
know something about them and for my work I'd like to know opinions of<br/>
you on this subject. So if you could write me some names and the reason<br/>
why do you think they helped him, I'll be grateful to you.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879438100">Hi there..<br/>
 On this issue you would certainly have to consider Oda Nobunaga. There can <br/>
be little doubt that without the help of Oda, Hideyoshi would NEVER have <br/>
risen to the postion that he finally did..From bringing him onto the stage as <br/>
a Samurai through to Hideyoshi's vengeance that lead to his achieving the <br/>
unification of Japan, Oda Nobunaga was THE pivotal figure in Hideyoshi's rise <br/>
upwards.<br/>
 A few good books on both men are available; I would suggest that you start <br/>
with 'Hideyoshi' by Elizabeth Berry...A thorough look at the man and his <br/>
policies and those who helped him in his rise. Also I would read 'Japonius <br/>
Tyrannus-Nobunaga reconsidered' By Jerome Lamarrs (?) another very good book <br/>
on Oda and his ties to the Toyotomi house.<br/>
 Another possible candidate in your question would be Tokugawa Ieyasu as the <br/>
eventual Shogun aided Hideyoshi throughout as an equal commander under <br/>
Nobunaga before finally outgrowing and out living Hideyoshi...I am sure that <br/>
the influence of both of these men helped Hideyoshi and his understanding of <br/>
Japanese politics at that stage in Japanese history.<br/>
 Others? Kato Kiyomasa perhaps, Inaba Ittetsu, or any of the Samurai that <br/>
helped in the Osaka battles of 1615...Many of the generals there had strong <br/>
ties to the Toyotomi and gave aid there due to the debt they felt they owed <br/>
to Hideyoshi and his family....Rather than Tokugawa.<br/>
 Long issue but the books I recommended will help you out. Also try to read <br/>
up on the Korean invasions of the late 16th century as many of the Samurai <br/>
involved there were staunch supporters of the Toyotomi.<br/>

Good point on libraries.<br/>

Any idea on this request I posted a while ago.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else can help that would be great.<br/>

I am also looking for decent reproductions of some of the battle screens<br/>

Tonys books they are not to hand right now) for the same reasons.<br/>

Hi<br/>
<br/>
Just reading through the new Stephen Turnbull Samurai Invasion korea war<br/>
1592- 98.<br/>
<br/>
He shows a number of details of the Ehon Taikoki - Takenouchi, Kazusai<br/>
(woodblock printed edition edition- Kobayashi Roekubei, Osaka, Printed<br/>
edition Yuhodo Bunko Series no 81- 1917.) 1802<br/>
<br/>
My question, any suggestions where I can get a copy or photocopy so I can<br/>
study the illustrations more closely?<br/>
(getting older, need larger pictures!)<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for any suggestions or guidance or help.<br/>
<br/>
