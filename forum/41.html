<br/>
The Kukishin Ryu likes to use several Bo. Octogonal, I have one made out of<br/>
Peach wood. Strange choice I know but it was a gift, the usual Rokushakubo,<br/>
and a Bo wihich has nine rings on it. 4 at each end spaced apart evenly, and a<br/>
ninth one in the middle. Not too sure why they have the rings, maybe to<br/>
reinforce it. They have also in the past used kyushakubo. I tried to twirl one<br/>
once. I found it hard being 6ft (180cm)m so how a smaller Japanese managed,<br/>
who knows. Not very practical. Mostly the Bo are made from Oak.<br/>

Hello My name is Penteado, Antenor Penteado. I am a new member of this <br/>
group, so I would like to say nice to meet you to all the members and wish a <br/>
merry christmas and happy new year. I am a brazilian lawyer who love Samurai <br/>
Culture and history and along my 61 years of age I have been reading about <br/>
such involving culture that I love.<br/>
It is a pleasure to be in touch with other people that enjoy getting to know <br/>
more and more about the Samurais and their history! There is a very <br/>
interesting book about Bushido that I would like to recommend you highly. It <br/>
is published in Spain and its title is " Zen y Artes Marciales" (Zen and <br/>
Marcial Arts) The writer is Taisen Deshimaru a master in Zen. Luiz Cï¿½rcamo <br/>
Editor. San Raimundo, 58 - Madrid. This is one of the books I like the most <br/>
about Zen and Marcial Arts. I know that there is a french edition, but I am <br/>
not quite sure if there is an english edition yet.<br/>
I have just read the new biography written about Miyamoto Musashi that has <br/>
some information about "Bo-jutsu".<br/>
I like Bo-jutsu and I would like to receive some information about the <br/>
wooden bastons, its size and interesting information about this art!<br/>
so, once more nice to meet you!<br/>
I am sorry for my poor english<br/>
best wishes.<br/>
Antenor C. Penteado<br/>
