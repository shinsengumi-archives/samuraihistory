<h3>Compare & Contrast: Feudal Japan vs. 20th Century America</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500974403">Hello All...i am currently writing a paper (as the title suggests) for my college English class an i am seeking some assistance in ensuring my desired point is obtained. I wish to illustrate (in my humble opinion) how a melding of aspects of both societies doctrines would produce a better 21st century America. My query is this: should i just explain it point to point (i.e., Japan's feudal caste system vs. America's free democratic society) or should i find an actual period in Japan's history to compare to 20th Century America? Like the Heian period or the Kamakura period? Any assitance or constructive criticism will be greatly appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally, I believe that whichever aspects of the past of Japan you <br/>
compare with contemporary US is probably going to generate a weird <br/>
paper.<br/>
As far as you don't want to go for a George W Bush vs. Nobunaga <br/>
comparison.. (<- joke).<br/>
I think a more interesting compare-contrast paper could be one between <br/>
Mujadeens (such as the Talibans) and some religiously fanatic Ikki <br/>
during Sengoku.<br/>
Anyway, just my ideas. Good luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can't help feeling intrigued by this -partly because an economist friend <br/>
of mine is studying how the Japanese economy arrived at the 21st <br/>
century by a different route to Western countries, but competitive with <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
My next thought was that a feudal system is not really a stable system <br/>
in itself as it is usually in a constant state of self-defence and then <br/>
replaced fairly rapidly by centralised government.<br/>
<br/>
 The Japanese central government under the Tokugawa shogunate was <br/>
successful in that it brought 250 years of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could look at the Tokugawa period (1603 to 1868) and <br/>
consider the characteristics of the Tokugawa system which made it <br/>
relatively easy for the Meiji government to strong-arm the country into <br/>
modernising: vertical hierarchies, neo-Confucianism, a relatively docile <br/>
and obedient population, a thriving pre-industrial merchant economy <br/>
etc, and some of the costs to the population - stifling of individual <br/>
opinion and protest, often with great cruelty, a repressive society with <br/>
elements of a police state, much informing on neighbours and so on, <br/>
all of which have made it really hard for the Japanese to embrace <br/>
Western style democracy in any realistic fashion or to have many forms <br/>
of public protest.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this relative ease with which government decisions are <br/>
enforced won't make life simpler  for countries like Japan and China as <br/>
the century continues and really difficult decisions re consumption and <br/>
environment have to be made by the world's governments. A tokugawa <br/>
style despot who can make laws and enforce them may be the "best" <br/>
form of government, but I hope he/she is an enlightened one!<br/>
<br/>
Just some random thoughts. Anyone want to discuss further?<br/>

<h3>Re: Compare & Contrast: Feudal Japan vs. 20th Century America</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-625327496">Hi all -<br/>
<br/>
In Ikegami Eiko's 'The Taming of the Samurai' she points to the <br/>
emergence of a kind of fledgling democracy at village level, in <br/>
associations of mutual protection (ikki), signified by a 'round <br/>
robin' document (rensho kishomon) signed by all but with no <br/>
indication of priority or seniority.<br/>
<br/>
This process began to spread, but was ruthlessley put down by <br/>
the stronger daimyo who had no intention of delegating power <br/>
on any kind of equal basis.<br/>
<br/>
Feudal systems survive as long as those at the top crush all <br/>
resistance below, and any kind of 'progress' is anathema to the <br/>
system unless it is instituted from above, in which case its <br/>
sole raison d'etre is the continuance of the status quo.<br/>
<br/>
In short, time marches on, but feudal systems do not.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that pre-Meiji Japan was ripe for change, all <br/>
that was required was something big enough to throw the <br/>
balance, Usually this is a popular uprising against repression <br/>
and nothing acts as a catalyst more than the idea that another <br/>
way might be possible.<br/>
<br/>
The degree of ensuing change, or its speed, is a result of the <br/>
ground that has to be made up - and the greater the ground, the <br/>
greater the impetus for change.<br/>
<br/>
In my own experience, I witnessed something of a distant cousin <br/>
of this effect in the typesetting industry in the UK, dominated <br/>
by 2 trades unions who had divided up 'Fleet Street' (the <br/>
newspaper business) between them and who refused to accept <br/>
technological developments that weakened their powerbase. <br/>
<br/>
This resistance went on until the appearance of the PC, at which <br/>
point the dam broke as it were, and a whole industry was swept <br/>
away overnight to vanish almost without trace.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, the battle was brought on by a major newspaper <br/>
publisher who built a new premesis founded on new computer <br/>
technology. He knew there would be strikes and <br/>
demonstrations, and military strategists have noticed that his <br/>
building fulfilled all the requirements of a fort built to withstand<br/>
a siege - not only walls and fences, but lines of approach, <br/>
everything - it was quickly dubbed "Fortress Wapping" and was <br/>
the site of the last stand of those particular unions.<br/>
<br/>
In short Despotic regimes, however benign, serve only one <br/>
purpose, themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gilian, I agree with most of your Email, however it seems to me that <br/>
(after a couple of century of rest) from the middle of the 19th <br/>
century, protest has been a constant of Japanese history. From <br/>
Sonno-Joi to the AMPO protests in the 60s. The situation cooled down <br/>
only in the 70s, possibly because wealth tamed most rebellious <br/>
Japanese. Today, the only form of protest in Japan seem to be limited <br/>
of individual exploits of violent madness.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of course you are right (anyone interested there's a good brief account <br/>
at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.willamette.edu/~rloftus/ampo.html)">http://www.willamette.edu/~rloftus/ampo.html)</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Mine was rather a generalised statement based on a politically active <br/>
friend who regrets it is so hard to get Japanese people to care about <br/>
social issues these days. Though the suggestions that the constitution <br/>
may be changed to allow more military activity seem to be arousing a <br/>
lot of opposition.<br/>
<br/>
re your earlier remark on the Taliban: I often wonder how much the <br/>
sonno joi extremists could be compared with Islamic extremists now - <br/>
highly xenophobic, impatient with their moderate, compromising <br/>
leadership, hating the disrespect shown to the holy places/ Emperor, <br/>
and believing that acts of violence against individual foreigners would <br/>
cause the whole lot to leave. The differences I suppose are not <br/>
following a monotheistic religion and having far less access to the <br/>
media.<br/>
<br/>
Contemporary accounts in English are full of terrified descriptions of <br/>
the "two-sworded ruffians" striding the streets of Yokohama and Edo.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to think of some benevolent despots and came up with: Marcus <br/>
Aurelius, Elizabeth I, Kemal Ataturk, Lee Kuan Yew and the Sultan of <br/>
Brunei. (Some of the German princelings might qualify, but I can't <br/>
remember that history from high school days). Not a very convincing <br/>
list. Guess we'll have to stick with democracy: may be sadly flawed but <br/>
it's better than anything else. :)<br/>

should have. They know nothing about history, culture, and can barely <br/>
speak their own language. And they know very little of the people they <br/>
rule because they all come from the upper class.<br/>
<br/>
That was quite true of the Japanese 'feudal' leader as well. Hideyoshi <br/>
was a good 'pacifier' at home, and the fact that he was of lower <br/>
extraction might have helped him to deal successful with people, but <br/>
his ignorance in geography and history of China and Korea costed him <br/>
dearly.<br/>
<br/>
Alexander the Great did pretty well. His main teacher was Aristotle...<br/>
