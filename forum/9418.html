<h3>Information fonts</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-672981198">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I'm sorry for my english because I don't practice it so<br/>
much and I've forgotten it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a History student from Spain, very interested in Japan History<br/>
and, especially, in Muromachi period. I'm studying the society of XVI<br/>
century, when first europeans arrive to Japan. But I have a problem.<br/>
There's no much fonts in spanish. I know that there are more in<br/>
eglinsh, but not here in Spain. Can you tell me book titles or other<br/>
information fonts (in spanish or english) that talk about japanese<br/>
culture, please? With treatments (-san, -sama, -dono...), the emperor<br/>
court, rituals, clothing...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much<br/>
<br/>
Miguel</div>

I'm not sure what you mean.  I don't think "fonts" is the word you <br/>
want.  In English, "font" usually means typeface (fundici√≥n o estilo <br/>
de letra), though it is also used for "una pila" in a church.  Perhaps <br/>
you mean "sources" or "resources" (recursos).  In Spanish I'm sure you <br/>
are using the word "fuente", but "font" in English is a little <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I'm not the one to recommend resources for you, but I'm <br/>
hoping this clarifies things for those here that can help you.<br/>

<br/>
No need to apologize.  I've had my fair share of gaffes in Spanish.  <br/>
And soon expect to be making them in Japanese.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889593906">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of information would you like to start with? I have rather  <br/>
a few books about Japanese<br/>
stuff that I can recommend depending on what precisely you are  <br/>
interested in learning about<br/>
and for what purpose. For some odd reason, I've taken it into my head  <br/>
to catalog my library and<br/>
put the catalog online. This is a long term project and I have more  <br/>
than 100 more titles cataloged<br/>
now than when I last uploaded it, and I just started this project.  <br/>
Regardless, if you are interested<br/>
in what I'm more or less reading at the moment, you can take a look at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.demoivre.org/toshokan/">http://www.demoivre.org/toshokan/</a><br/>
<br/>
I should mention that the books are not sorted by subject and not all  <br/>
are in English.<br/>
Also, I have quite a few that are not catalogued yet.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes.</div>

Some interesting titles there. Bookpedia looks to be quite useful, i  <br/>
am very much tempted to try it myself.  One question, does it only  <br/>
give you the latest edition of each title? or does it allow you to  <br/>
plug in earlier dates?<br/>
any help appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bookpedia allows you to put in all sorts of stuff including individual<br/>
editions, &c. First of all, the ISBN system requires different numbers<br/>
for each edition. So, this can help you out. However, Bookpedia is<br/>
set up to handle the needs of both small libraries and used book<br/>
dealers. Consequently, it has over a dozen list formats and you<br/>
can come up with your own format as well.</div>
