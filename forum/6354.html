Ladies and Gentlemen<br/>
I have thought long and hard about commenting on this threat as it appears<br/>
that misunderstanding and ridicule may be the only rewards. However, I trust<br/>
that the following might be relevant.<br/>
<br/>
Sir:<br/>
Your name rings a distinct bell, and I find myself wondering if you were<br/>
over in northern California a couple of years back teaching at a European<br/>
Martial Arts Symposium.<br/>
But be that as it may:  more to the point in this context:  aside from the<br/>
potential misunderstanding and ridicule, there's the satisfaction of<br/>
speaking up on a subject that matters to one... and likewise, the shame of<br/>
sitting silently by while someone speaks ill of an article of one's faith.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a student of Japanese swords for many years and having handled and<br/>
closely studied thousands in this time, this is what I think.<br/>
<br/>
In the Shinto religion, many things are credited with having a spirit and<br/>
the sword is not an exception. However, this was then and now is now. When<br/>
one picks up a sword of great antiquity and of historical importance, a<br/>
sensitive and sympathetic person cannot help but be greatly impressed. The<br/>
sugata, texture of the steel and the activities in the hamon will convey the<br/>
beauty and grace of the sword if the viewer has the necessary expertise to<br/>
understand and appreciate it. It is possible in some cases to see and begin<br/>
to understand the spirit the maker has imbued in the sword and maybe his<br/>
character also. For instance, a sword from the often flamboyant Osaka Shinto<br/>
school quite obviously reflects the somewhat brash nature of that city at<br/>
the time. However, I think in many ways this is similar to seeing the<br/>
tortured emotions of Van Gogh in one of his paintings. But to attribute this<br/>
to a mystical force is probably ill-advised in this day and age.<br/>
<br/>
Now simple honesty requires me (in such a context) to state that my own<br/>
personal theology has a great deal in common with Shinto - so much so that<br/>
it came as a great delight for me to discover that rich tradition of faith a<br/>
couple of decades back - and as such it only seems reasonable, to me at<br/>
least, for us still to recognise the spirit in certain objects not currently<br/>
widely regarded as possessing the same.  I envy you the experience of<br/>
handling those fine old swords.  I've only handled two blades older than a<br/>
century or so, myself, so I can't say much on that score.  To attribute any<br/>
such thing to a "mystical force" could definitely be regarded as<br/>
ill-advised, as subsequent evidence has indeed indicated.  But to shrink<br/>
from a truth simply because it's unpopular could be regarded as worse - as<br/>
cowardice - and I'd far rather be ill-advised than cowardly.<br/>
<br/>
It<br/>
surprises me that martial arts people feel that a "sword is talking to them"<br/>
when this does not seem to be the case with those more familiar with swords<br/>
unless being able to learn when, and where it was made and maybe its<br/>
historical context by close scrutiny, may be considered as communication<br/>
with the sword.<br/>
<br/>
I must ask you if it seems to you that "those more familiar with swords"<br/>
possess the same variety and intensity of familiarity as those who live with<br/>
them and work with them daily.  My own thought is that these are two very<br/>
different species of familiarity; and that those who study the blades may<br/>
not always be as "sensitive and sympathetic" to the nature of swords as<br/>
those who handle them constantly.  Teaching a variety of international sword<br/>
styles provides me with my livelihood, and while I admit that I've only been<br/>
teaching for thirty-odd years, and practising on a more-or-less daily basis<br/>
for a mere forty years or so, still I can't help feeling that in that time<br/>
I've developed just a little bit of familiarity with swords myself.  I<br/>
freely acknowledge the practitioner's bias against the academic here, and I<br/>
hope that my caution in stating all this does not come across as sarcasm.<br/>
<br/>
I have always considered that in Japanese sword study, kendo<br/>
(or Iai-do) is the practical side of the academic study of Japanese swords,<br/>
but that it is all kendo in the final analysis and both are equally<br/>
important and need to be undertaken together. In other words, kendo people<br/>
are missing a great deal by having no understanding of the Japanese sword<br/>
and the reverse also applies.<br/>
<br/>
Hear, hear.  Indeed, it is my own experience that kendo does not accurately<br/>
represent the martial swordplay of Japan, any more than fencing represents<br/>
European rapier or small-sword combat, with the result that (even though our<br/>
full-speed sparring is carried out with shinai) I term mine a kenjutsu<br/>
style - including iai-jutsu, cutting practise, regarding the entire body as<br/>
target, attempting to block blows with the ridge when possible, and concerns<br/>
over the breaking of a sword due to abuse or carelessness in combat.<br/>
<br/>
We are taught to view swords calmly and in a relaxed and unexcited manner<br/>
whether we are looking at a National Treasure or a kazu-uichi-mono. In this<br/>
way we will see everything that the sword has to offer. It may not talk to<br/>
us, but the educated and informed viewer will know the sword intimately.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I've not bored you to death with the above and that it at least makes<br/>
a modicum of sense.<br/>
<br/>
Not a bit of it, and a great deal:  in that order.  And may I say that I<br/>
both respect and greatly envy your formal education in these matters.  I<br/>
think you've made some important points, whether or not I find myself in<br/>
entire agreement.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, this presents a (to me) very interesting point. It's traditional in <br/>
Japan (or at least used to be) for smiths to purify themselves before creating a <br/>
sword, and they had (have?) Shito shrines in their smithies. They even wore the <br/>
traditional priestly white when working.<br/>
<br/>
Yet they were making swords -- the purpose of which was to kill. And death <br/>
(along with blood) are two of the greatest pollutants in Shinto.<br/>
<br/>
To me, that's a very interesting dilemma.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Many years ago, I had a koshigatana that had been made in 1368. The mei read <br/>
"Bishu Osafune Munemitsu saku." It was short, very slim (essentially, a katana <br/>
at about 69% scale), with a really deep curve. I loved that sword.<br/>
<br/>
When I went off to Japan in '86, I left it (along with my original ten-volume, <br/>
1700 printing of Arai Hakuseki's "Honcho Gunki-ko") with my old roommates for <br/>
safekeeping. A mutual friend showed up a few weeks later and told them that I'd <br/>
said she could hold on to them for me.<br/>
<br/>
Never saw 'em again.<br/>
