<div id="ygrps-yiv-616241942">Well, the Samurai class, or bushi, didn't come onto the historical <br/>
stage untill 750 after the Gempei War. <br/>
In the early days samurai could be of any class, much like the roman <br/>
legions, but it wasn't until 1200's(could have been as early as the <br/>
1100's) when the class system became more ridged. And from then until <br/>
1868 with the Meiji Restoration(some records show the restoration and <br/>
the various rebellions post and prior that the end of the bushi came <br/>
in 1867-9) the Samurai where the ruling class. though of course the <br/>
court nobles and Emporer still had power they had been reduced to <br/>
figureheads.<br/>
<br/>
To answer your question, and i am sorry for the long explination <br/>
prior, people where trained as Samurai(as a prior post has said) by <br/>
being born into a Samurai family. Both sexes where trained though <br/>
diffrently. Men where trained in horsemenship, kyudo( long bow) and <br/>
kenjitsu(sword) amoung other unarmed techniques such as Aikido, <br/>
jujitsu, ect. Woman on the other hand where taught Niganata(long <br/>
spear with curved blade) the use of tanto, and other small knives and <br/>
also horsemenship(the japanese name escapes me at the moment) and <br/>
both where taught Yarijitsu(spear).<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps. Another point to make is that unlike medival <br/>
knights, who where given power to an extent i.e. a lord would pay for <br/>
thier training and armor ect, while still not giving him power in and <br/>
of himself. the Bushi in effect, after the gempei war half took it <br/>
and half where given it, as the nobles felt that they should still <br/>
run the country from kyoto but as the latter periods of unrest proved<br/>
the Bushi really controlled the goings on of the country(while still <br/>
paying yearly homage to the Emporer).<br/>

<br/>
Horsemanship - Bajutsu<br/>
archery on horseback - Yabusame and Kishajutsu<br/>
<br/>
Many schools still exist in Japan today that study<br/>
these arts. Others such as the Kukishin ryu no longer<br/>
study the Kishajutsu, but maintain study in the other<br/>
martial arts<br/>
