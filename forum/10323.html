    I am wishing that someone might be able to assist me in my quest to find<br/>
the origin of this Tokugawa Keisu Bowl.It was a gift to me about 6 years ago<br/>
from a lady who has since passed away and the history of the bowl along with<br/>
her.The last home that i know of for them both was<br/>
Iddesleigh,Winkleigh,Devon England.I have since found it to be from the<br/>
Tokugawa Shogunate because Mon. It has 4 of the circle Hollyhock lleaf's and<br/>
2 water dragons etched around the sides of it.<br/>
    It is vert large 2ft tall and wide and weighs 50 lbs.The stand is<br/>
2ft tall as well.<br/>
  Any assistance that you could provide would be greatly appriciated.I<br/>
do wish to sell it if anyone is interested please feel free to email<br/>
