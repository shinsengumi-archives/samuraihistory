<br/>
As you all know there are quite a few sites selling sword on the net. <br/>
I am looking at purchasing a set of swords from a reputable supplier. <br/>
So would like to ask you guys who have purchased your own sword/s <br/>
where you got them from and if you would recommend that supplier. If <br/>
you could tell me what type of sword/s you purchased, the cost (using <br/>
US currency) and the website if they have one, that would help me <br/>
alot. Thank you in advance</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769851282">I for one am a big sword collector. My opinion however on Paul Chen is that yes he makes alright practical katana, but there are swords out there a hell of alot better. I<br/>
recently bought a new iaito as i do study iaido, but that was about an $800 sword.<br/>
It really depends on what you want to do with it. You also have to consider your budget<br/>
as they can get extremely pricey. So if you're looking for something to cut with, you'll <br/>
want to get a live blade. If you are intersted in Iaido or just a decorative item, you might <br/>
get an iaito. Regardless of what purpose you're getting it for, you will be spending alot.<br/>
As for practical blades, yes Paul Chen has some good ones, but Pual Chen isn't very<br/>
authentic. I myself have had 2 Paul Chen blades for Tameshigiri (rice straw cutting) and <br/>
I wasn't very impressed or satisfied. Not to mention that one of them came with scratches <br/>
already imbeded in the blade. So try to stear clear of those; to expensive for crap. But if you're looking for a good practical katana, or even an iaito, go to www.swordstore.com,<br/>
www.bugei.com, www.samurai-store.com, and www.tozando.com. Bottom line, you're not <br/>
going to get even a decent sword for under $250. Well good luck! <br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] Swords</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-42980105">Hi Nate. Mr. Clive Sinclaire is by far the ultimate authority on NihonTo<br/>
that post here. But I want to say my opinion.<br/>
In another Forum in which I'm in, Sword Forum International, a lot of<br/>
topics are on Paul Chen or Last Legend, Bugei or Cicada Forge or<br/>
DGuertin modern REPLICAS.<br/>
They are made in several different types of carbon steel, almost all in<br/>
Marugitae, the best ones in the line even folded, a very few in<br/>
Kobusegitae but NOONE with Tamagahane. Some have Koshirae quiet good,<br/>
and tight enough for the purpose they are made : TAMESHIGIRI.<br/>
They are made to be used, scretched, ruined, bended, chipped and all the<br/>
bad nightmare's things you really wantn't to happen to your beautiful 5k<br/>
Shinsakuto, or to any other REAL (and beautiful) NihonTo. I'm planning<br/>
to buy a DGuertin for training, too.<br/>
But I found there that exists a collector market for these items too.<br/>
Some people elaborate and customize so much their pieces reaching<br/>
considerable amounts of bucks. Others orders the blades to American<br/>
Tosho (far from the japanese standard in my opinion) and than ask for<br/>
customized mounts and koshirae, made sometimes in a more "modern" way.<br/>
Here too the amount of bucks requested is high, reaching (ormore) the<br/>
amount for a good ShinsakuTo. But these are much higher in quality and<br/>
deserve an higher respect as they are uniques. De Gustibus Non Est<br/>
Disputandum but in my opinion the above mentioned Paul Chen etc etc are<br/>
merely something better than a Bokken.  <br/>

I for one am a big sword collector. My opinion however on Paul Chen is that yes he makes alright practical katana, but there are swords out there a hell of alot better. I<br/>
recently bought a new iaito as i do study iaido, but that was about an $800 sword.<br/>
It really depends on what you want to do with it. You also have to consider your budget<br/>
as they can get extremely pricey. So if you're looking for something to cut with, you'll <br/>
want to get a live blade. If you are intersted in Iaido or just a decorative item, you might <br/>
get an iaito. Regardless of what purpose you're getting it for, you will be spending alot.<br/>
As for practical blades, yes Paul Chen has some good ones, but Pual Chen isn't very<br/>
authentic. I myself have had 2 Paul Chen blades for Tameshigiri (rice straw cutting) and <br/>
I wasn't very impressed or satisfied. Not to mention that one of them came with scratches <br/>
already imbeded in the blade. So try to stear clear of those; to expensive for crap. But if you're looking for a good practical katana, or even an iaito, go to www.swordstore.com,<br/>
www.bugei.com, www.samurai-store.com, and www.tozando.com. Bottom line, you're not <br/>
going to get even a decent sword for under $250. Well good luck! <br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
As you all know there are quite a few sites selling sword on the net. <br/>
I am looking at purchasing a set of swords from a reputable supplier. <br/>
So would like to ask you guys who have purchased your own sword/s <br/>
where you got them from and if you would recommend that supplier. If <br/>
you could tell me what type of sword/s you purchased, the cost (using <br/>
US currency) and the website if they have one, that would help me <br/>
alot. Thank you in advance   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
