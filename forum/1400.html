<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839320493">The daugter who married Katsuyori was Nobunaga's stepdaughter.Her <br/>
father was Naegi Kantaro(he is said to be either Touyama Naokado or <br/>
Touyama Tomokatsu).And her mother was Nobunaga's sister,Okatsu-no-<br/>
kata.Nobunaga adopted her and said to cherish more than his real <br/>
children.<br/>
She was called Touyama-bunin in Takeda.Takeda Nobukatsu was the son <br/>
of Katsuyori and her.<br/>
<br/>
As for Matsuhime,Shingen's daughter,Shingen undid the promise of her <br/>
marriage to Nobutada when Oda helped Tokugawa in Mikatagahara battle.<br/>
It is said Nobtada and Matsu loved each other,and Nobutada proposed <br/>
marriage to her again after Takeda clan was extinct,but on her way to <br/>
see Nobutada,she knew his death in Honnouji incident.She remained <br/>
single all her life.<br/>

<h3>Clan Genealogies - Takeda</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730449313">Here is what I have so far for The decendants of Takeda Nobutora so <br/>
far (just the first two generations) - one problem I have is I don't <br/>
know which of his children were from the daughter of Ooi Nobutatsu, <br/>
and who were from other women, so I currently have them all lumped <br/>
under her.  Same as before, the * means that they show up more than <br/>
once, and the index at the end of the section helps to make more <br/>
sense of the whole thing - basicaly 1.1 and 1.2 would be siblings, <br/>
and 1.1.1 would be the child of 1.1 - it all makes sense after a <br/>
while).  <br/>
<br/>
Any help or pointing out of mistakes is greatly appreciated:<br/>

<h3>Re: Clan Genealogies - Takeda</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782806072">From a strictly technical standpoint, "Nobu" isn't any more popular <br/>
than any other.  Each clan had certain characters that they used to <br/>
excess.  The Oda clan used "Nobu" to death ---  if you look at any <br/>
major Sengoku clan, you see this.  Look at the Mori clan.  "Moto" was <br/>
used at least as much with them as "Nobu" with the Oda: Hidemoto, <br/>
Terumoto, Motonari, Okimoto, Takamoto, Motoharu, Motokiyo, Motoaki, <br/>
Motoyasu, Mototomo, etc.  Another example is the Hojo clan.  You'll <br/>
find at least a dozen instances of "Uji".<br/>
