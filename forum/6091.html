since you've managed to express it so much more kindly, maybe - just maybe -<br/>

Subject: History/Shotokan Re: new subject<br/>
<br/>
Actually, Mr. Berryman, each generation of masters since Funakoshi-sensei<br/>
has altered some of the Shotokan techniques and kata.<br/>
Shotokan is modern in the historical sense, but perhaps you are young, and<br/>
four or five generations feels like a great deal of time.<br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate your enthusiasm and ardor on the subject, but perhaps you<br/>
might want to read more than one or two books to form your<br/>
opinions. Especially so since you argue with some people who have spent<br/>
their lives studying things Japanese. I would suggest some<br/>
history, rather than those with a martial arts focus.<br/>
<br/>
Your skin might want to get less sensitive as well; you're quite twitchy and<br/>
reactive. I wouldn't trust you around me with neither<br/>
bokken nor blade.  Do calm down, sir. You have nothing to prove, and by<br/>
professing to know much, you prevent yourself from further<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Good day,<br/>

Yes I do know that Karate began before this. But what I am saying is that<br/>
master Funakoshi's style is derived directly from the old<br/>
ways of Okinawa. Just because JKA was formed in the 20th century does not<br/>
mean that it has lost the old ways.<br/>

Aye, lad.  I find myself hoping he either flunks his boards if he has to<br/>
take them, or failing that, remaining unemployed.  My 9<br/>

Could be worse I learned Japanese from a very nice lady who forgot to tell<br/>
me the difference between male and female inflexions and<br/>
other subtle differences between the sexes. Consequently I talked like a<br/>
woman would and most of the guys I worked with in Japan<br/>
thought I was gay.    Nothing like being pulled away by your boss and being<br/>
told that the company doesn't like to employ perverts.<br/>

I graciously accept your compliment, and I assure you it is a learned trait.<br/>
<br/>
I spent far too many years as an 'Angry Woman'.   I can't say wasted, for in retrospect I learned much.  The Deputy will understand <br/>
when I say I am a former army field medic (and instructor), and former PLDC instructor.   The segue into those slots was natural for <br/>
me, because of my upbringing.  I had much to undo, as I was once a macho-smart-mouth brat who liked control moreso than the usual <br/>
person, and had 'something to prove to the men'.<br/>
<br/>
In my early years of Shotokan training I was engaged to a nidan who was an Angry Young Man.  My development of kumite skills was the <br/>
result of regular 'training sessions' by my intended mate and his friends.  I did learn,  became tough, and as a purple belt (4th <br/>
kyu) was capable of defeating many who outranked me by a wide margin.  However, I may have had technique, but there was no peace, no <br/>
serenity in my heart. That relationship didn't survive, thank the fates, and let's just say his anger and attitude has brought him <br/>
no happy life.<br/>
<br/>
I've had the good fortune to have excellent tutelage and example set for me in several dear friends.   I don't know that I follow <br/>
'The Way', but I strive to be the same person from the core of my being to what others see, and with my actions.  I try to be <br/>
honest, and act with integrity. I don't claim a permanent state of serenity, kindness, dignity, or clarity of mind.  I have learned <br/>
the concept of 'beginner's mind', and have been rewarded with teachers of all ages, cultures, and species.<br/>
<br/>
I'm grateful to be here, and look forward to learning more from some very fine people.  I may not be very knowledgeable, but if <br/>
someone else benefits from my input,  the clichÃ© 'I am honored' applies.<br/>
<br/>
