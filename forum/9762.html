<div id="ygrps-yiv-906372649">In order to get maximum participation, the deadline for submissions<br/>
has been extended to August 31st, 2008.  As an added bonus, if we can<br/>
get 10 entries, I'll donate $100 from my own pocket to go to the<br/>
prizewinner. Tell your friends!<br/>
<br/>
So, to reiterate, deadline for the contest has been changed now to<br/>
