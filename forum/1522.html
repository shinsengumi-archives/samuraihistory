	The Shinsengumi did exists unfortunately Ruroni Kenshin and <br/>
many of the characters in the comixs did not. When the Tokugawa <br/>
bakufu began to lose control of the country in the 1850s, Kyoto <br/>
became a magnet for Anti-Tokugawa ronin. The Bakufus' hold on the <br/>
city became rather tenuous. Thye Shinsegumi was a group of Tokugawa <br/>
loyalists banded together to act as counter-terrorists in the capitol.<br/>
	They were known for their harsh rules and strict <br/>
traditionalism. I would recommend the movies "Shinsengumi" with <br/>
Mifune, "Shisengumi Shimatsuki" with Ichikawa, "Bakumatsu zankoku <br/>
monogatari" and even the recent "Gohatto". There are many more, but <br/>
if these stimulate your interest I think you'll find the true story <br/>
of the Shinsegumi more interesting than any manga.<br/>
