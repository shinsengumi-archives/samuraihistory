The winner will be selected through the public voting at the event for (August 22 )The 400 Year Anniversary After Katuyori's Death (sponsored by the Association of Takeda Katsuyori in Tosa) and will be chosen by the executive board of the association<br/>
 <br/>
We are going to commoditize the illustration and sell it in the event on October 10th.(The 400 Year Anniversary event)<br/>
