<h3>Where can one purchase a period accurate pair of *costume* swords?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274000384">I'm working on a Momoyama period samurai street dress, and while I have the skills to <br/>
sew most of what I need, I'm not exactly equipped to make swords.<br/>
<br/>
I don't need a sword for iado; nor do I need it for combat reenactment; nor do I need <br/>
a museum quality piece.  A duraluminum blade would be just fine; it's for a costume, <br/>
after all.  I'm more concerned with the proper shape and reasonably accurate <br/>
furniture.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, most of what I see for sale is crap, and the stuff that isn't crap I can't <br/>
afford (I could probably swing up to $150 per blade, but $500 per blade is out of my <br/>
league).  <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, the things people have the gall to label "samurai sword" astounds me.  <br/>
Some of 'em look like freaking steak knives.  :-/<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
