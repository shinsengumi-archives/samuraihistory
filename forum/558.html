<div id="ygrps-yiv-118075825">Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for the feedback. I've found this books, <br/>
-Samurai Warriors,   Guild Publishing; 1987   <br/>
-The Book of the Samurai - The Warrior Class of Japan,   (?)1982  <br/>
-The Sumurai: A Military History.   Guild (BCA) , 1988, at a good <br/>
price and would like to know if anyone has them and if they are any <br/>
good. I ordered "Samurai Warfare" and "The Samurai Source Book" <br/>
through Amazon and was wondering if the above complete each other or  <br/>
are redundant.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Nuno</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113711614">I have read all those books and yes they are all very redundant, especially<br/>
if you read them back to back.  Essentially he's been writing the same book<br/>
over and over, each one though having a tidbit of more info then the others.<br/>
Of his books I would recommend his first The Samurai, Samurai Warfare,<br/>
Samurai Sourcebook, Battles of the Samurai, and Ashigaru. Again I wouldn't<br/>
read the all together as they do repeat themselves. If you're going to get<br/>
The samurai a molitary history, Turnbull has written a revised version,<br/>
1996/Japan Library,  that takes in a lot of new info since he wrote the<br/>
original in 1977.<br/>
