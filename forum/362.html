It has been my experience of martial arts (for 11 years, through 8 different arts), that the samurai used to wear them for all<br/>
of the above purposes, but also for one other.<br/>
<br/>
There is a sitting posture that the ninja adopted when impersonating a samurai, so that it was easy to move if attacked<br/>
unexpectantly, or preparing to attack unexpectantly.<br/>
<br/>
Although I can't reveal the seated posture, I can, however, tell you about it.<br/>
<br/>
This seated posture looks identical to the casual seated posture in modern day Japan, with the legs crossed at the shins, and<br/>
knees almost resting on the ankles.<br/>
<br/>
This is still alive in martial arts that have techniques adopted from the samurai arts. The hakama hid whether or not they<br/>
were seated like this in particular, or  _however_  they were seated in fact.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543347703">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry but I have practiced Budo for over 12 years<br/>
of my life.  I have to disagree.  There are all kinds<br/>
of ideas that the Hakama was worn to disguise movement<br/>
or position.  This is simply not true.  The Samurai<br/>
when going in to combat without armor preffered to<br/>
were there hakama tucked up some under the Obi.  This<br/>
allowed full movement without tripping on the hakama<br/>
itself.(anyone who practices Aikido has had this<br/>
happen)  When wearing armor they didn't even wear<br/>
hakama so it did not apply.<br/>
<br/>
The Word "ninja" is not hstorically correct and<br/>
neither is their movie incarnation.  They were usually<br/>
reffered to as Shinobi and originally were not as<br/>
specialized as the movies make them appear.  They were<br/>
used to set fire to enemy encampments and castles in<br/>
order to cause confusion.  Sometimes rarely they would<br/>
be employed to kill.  But I have heard of very few if<br/>
any cases with the latter.  A good book on the subject<br/>
of the origin and truths behind the "Ninja" is Stephen<br/>
Turnbulls, Ninja.  It is very hard to get ahold of and<br/>
has to be ordered from Europe but is worth the price.<br/>
<br/>
There are alot of myths regarding the history of the<br/>
Martial arts.(Ninja Especially)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone looks back through the emails they will find<br/>
an explanation given by me on the general usage of the<br/>
hakama as well as from Anthony J. Bryant, Both of<br/>
these are good.  There was really nothing mysterious<br/>
about it.  If you look at the clothing from the yayoi<br/>
period forward you will see similarity's leading to<br/>
the advent of the Hakama.  The Japanese as with every<br/>
othr nation were very practical in the development of<br/>
their clothing.  A good example of this is the Long<br/>
Hakama worn in the Shoguns palace during the Tokugawa<br/>
period which restricted movement making attacks on<br/>
others impossible.  Also the short hakama worn in the<br/>
Summer by some foot soldiers and attendants in the<br/>
kamakura period.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Musashi<br/>
<br/>
P.s. I left out alot of other examples.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How does practicing a martial art relate to Japan, Japanese history, <br/>
and samurai in such a way that you would 'know' the answer? Being a <br/>
martial artist alone doesn't qualify one to answer on matters of <br/>
Japan. (although I will concede it will give you the ability to infer <br/>
what types of clothing will be fitting for defending yourself while <br/>
sitting, etc.)  I spent 6 years as a dedicated martial artist before <br/>
spending two years living in Japan as a student and was utterly <br/>
shocked about how warped martial artists in the USA view japan and <br/>
the beliefs they hold of it (for the record, I was one of them). I am <br/>
qualified to say this because I was, as I mentioned, a dedicated <br/>
martial artist, who before moving to japan listened to and believed <br/>
all that I heard about Japan from fellow martial artists - who also <br/>
had never been there.  If you have lived in Japan, then forgive me.. <br/>
if not, don't believe everything that you hear from the martial arts <br/>
community. There is no other way to say it but to say that it is for <br/>
the most part wrong (inane arguments about how to pronounce 'ryu', or <br/>
the etiquette of bowing 'like they do in Japan', or most importantly <br/>
western views on how the martial arts are percieved in Japan -- most <br/>
Japanese either don't care at all, or view it as a 'sport' - <br/>
something like wrestling or hockey).  From what I 'knew' before <br/>
living in Japan, all Japanese take martial arts, and the samurai <br/>
practiced in karate dojos all day... Japan is a country like any <br/>
other, life does not revolve around nature and buddhism and the <br/>
martial arts, etc.  I'm not saying that your argument is invalid, <br/>
however the way you phrased your response struck a chord with me.</div>

<br/>
I have to apologize for any confusion from My last<br/>
email.  I did not mean to infer that because i<br/>
practice a martial art my knowledge was anymore valid.<br/>
 I have studied Japanese culture and history very<br/>
intently for a long time.  I try my best to give<br/>
informative responses to any thing I choose to respond<br/>
to.  I also try to be helpful.  I meant no disrespect<br/>
towards anyone.  The reason I wrote about the ninja is<br/>
because I to agree that there are alot of unusual<br/>
misconceptions in the martial arts community about<br/>
Japanese history.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to many japanese about their history and<br/>
Most admit that in Japan there is a lack of knowledge<br/>
among the common community about their own history. <br/>
For example many Americans have a basic idea about<br/>
their history and know certain names like thomas<br/>
Jefferson etc... but if you were to go into detail<br/>
most would be at a loss.  This is true also of<br/>
Japanese they know a basic outline and some names but<br/>
generally they are not that knowledgable.(I am<br/>
speaking of the general public not those who study and<br/>
have sources to study from in japan)  So living in<br/>
japan really is not a source of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
To finish though I really meant no disrespect to<br/>
anyone and am sorry to have casued any confusion.  I<br/>
have looked over my email and could have worded it<br/>
better.  I am sorry to have upset anyone out there.<br/>
<br/>
Musashi<br/>
<br/>
I still recommend that book though.  It is really an<br/>
excellent work.  (ohhhhh and I don't think anyone will<br/>
argue the validity and expertise of stephen turnbull)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rod, where did you get this from? I'm a little<br/>
skeptical--it sounds like something out of Martial<br/>
Arts Illustrated or something. Most images of samurai<br/>
you see preparing for a battle or a duel have their<br/>
hakama tied back with leggings to keep them out of the<br/>
way (assuming they aren't in armor, which would keep<br/>
the clothing out of the way by definition.) Kobakama,<br/>
or shorter, tighter hakama, were frequently worn when<br/>
"expecting action". <br/>
<br/>
Were hakama worn exclusively by the samurai class,<br/>
then maybe I could see your answer making sense. But<br/>
how would that explain nagabakama, worn by courtiers<br/>
and samurai during court functions? I'm no clothing<br/>
historian, but I know we've got some here. Tony? Lady<br/>
Solveig? Care to enlighten us further? <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I could just look at Tony's website: <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html">http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/garb/garb.html</a><br/>
<br/>
"Hakama worn by commoners and laborers in Heian were<br/>
two panel, and typically only reached to the mid-calf<br/>
or a bit lower. During the sixteenth century,<br/>
low-class warriors often wore a knee-length two- or<br/>
three-panel hakama which were sometimes called<br/>
kobakama, a terminology problem as regular hakama were<br/>
also called kobakama in the Edo period owing to the<br/>
formal nagabakama being the formal norm."<br/>
<br/>
If hakama were being worn by commoners and laborers,<br/>
then I hardly think a critical part of their design<br/>
would be to hide the movement of the legs from an<br/>
opponent. <br/>
<br/>
Continuing: <br/>
<br/>
"Earlier hakama, unlike modern martial arts hakama,<br/>
had two clearly defined legs, rather than having the<br/>
pleats overlapping left and right so that one cant<br/>
tell where one leg ends and the other begins. Another<br/>
modern feature is the koshita, the solid panel at the<br/>
small of the back. This seems to have appeared<br/>
sometime in the early Edo period or at the earliest in<br/>
the very late days of the sixteenth century, as<br/>
earlier hakama were merely cut straight across the<br/>
back as at the front."<br/>
<br/>
If these things were developed in the Edo period, and<br/>
hakama were being worn in the Heian period, then they<br/>
could hardly be part of the development of hakama. <br/>
<br/>
I'd still like to see what Tony and others have to<br/>

  Again maybe I should have specified. I believe hakamas were used during duels thus adding more difficulty. Obviously on the battlefield this would have been a detriment but in a situation like a duel it would have been more proper. <br/>

<h3>Re: hakama</h3>
by <i>onnak</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611666446">I just read in a number of sources that hakama were not initially <br/>
split between the legs, but were worn like a skirt.  They became <br/>
split to allow samurai to wear them while on horseback.  <br/>
   The thing with the foot movements may be one reason that hakama <br/>
were adopted by many of the martial arts like kendo - rather than, <br/>
for example, sumo.  <br/>
   The horseback explanation makes sense to me because hakama were <br/>
not originally split like pants.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but as stated, the hakama was invented Heian<br/>
period or before. Our common image of samurai dueling<br/>
is from the Edo period. Therefore, this cannot be part<br/>
of the CREATION of the hakama. <br/>
<br/>
Also, as I stated, the vast majority of images I see<br/>
where samurai are preparing for action, they have<br/>
their kosode sleeves and hakama tied up. This<br/>
statement was meant to include dueling. Watch some<br/>
jidai-geki. If someone knows they are getting into a<br/>
fight, they're prepared for it. The flowing hakama are<br/>
usually on people not expecting to throw down. <br/>
<br/>
Here's a statue of Miyamoto Musashi, illustrating what<br/>
I mean:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Notice the leggings holding in the hakama, and the<br/>
tied sleeves. This is a fairly common sight in<br/>
contemporary prints, and the standard jidaigeki<br/>
indication of someone about to get in a fight. Here's<br/>
another pic, just the top half, unfortunately:<br/>

<br/>
Regardless, the original question was about the<br/>
origins of the hakama. The image you've got in your<br/>
head is from the Edo period. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here is something I've got from the "Online dictionary of history and<br/>
traditions"<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/search?dbname=histg&sword=hakama)">http://www.docoja.com:8080/jisho/search?dbname=histg&sword=hakama)</a> :<br/>
<br/>
"As  attested  by  Haniwa  doll  of  Kofun  period,  origin  of hakama<br/>
(Japanese  trousers)  was  very old. Under an influence of the Chinese<br/>
civilization, the usage of hakama had declined during Heian period and<br/>
replaced  by  kimono  with  a long skirt, especially among women. When<br/>
samurai  clans  took the power in the middle ages, the usage of hakama<br/>
became  again  popular  among  men. Hakama for women resurfaced during<br/>
Meiji period as a girl's school uniform."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another source (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shindai.com/articles/hakama.htm)">http://www.shindai.com/articles/hakama.htm)</a> states the<br/>
following (+ some more info):<br/>
<br/>
"A  hakama  is  the  skirt-like pants that some aikidoka wear. It is a<br/>
traditional  piece of samurai clothing. The standard gi worn in aikido<br/>
as well as in other martial arts such as Judo or Karate was originally<br/>
underclothes. Wearing it is part of the tradition of (most schools of)<br/>
aikido.<br/>
<br/>
The  hakama  were  originally  meant to protect a horseman's legs from<br/>
brush, etc., - not unlike a cowboy's leather 'chaps'. Leather was hard<br/>
to  come  by  in  Japan,  so  heavy  cloth was used instead. After the<br/>
samurai as a class dismounted and became more like foot-soldiers, they<br/>
persisted  in  wearing  horseman's  garb because it set them apart and<br/>
made them easily identifiable.<br/>
<br/>
There were different styles of hakama though. The type worn by today's<br/>
martial  artists  -  with  "legs" - is called a joba hakama, (roughly,<br/>
horseriding  thing  into  which  one steps). A hakama that was kind of<br/>
like  a  tube  skirt - no legs - another and the third was a very long<br/>
version of the second. It was worn on visits to the Shogun or Emperor.<br/>
The  thing  was  about  12-15  feet long and was folded repeatedly and<br/>
placed   between   the   feet  and  posterior  of  the  visitor.  This<br/>
necessitated their shikko ("knee walking") for their audience and made<br/>
it  extremely unlikely that they could hide a weapon (retainers suited<br/>
them up) or rise quickly to make an attack."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope  some pieces of this info might be useful to you, guys. And it is<br/>
interesting that I also heard soe time ago from one of my friends that<br/>
hakama  was  used to camouflage your legs' moves, but I never actually<br/>
read about that...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.s.  My first post to the group. Please, do not take too skeptical...<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

proving my exact point. Rod's impression that the<br/>
hakama were developed to hide the martial artist's<br/>
legs in a duel is false; that is an Edo period image,<br/>
whereas hakama were developed early enough to be<br/>
depicted on haniwa, as your nice research points out. <br/>

As for skepticism...lol. Can't help that. <br/>
