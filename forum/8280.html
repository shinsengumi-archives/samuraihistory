<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don't get me wrong. I really liked THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. I saw it as a <br/>
teenager (which was a long, long, LONG time ago  :)<br/>
<br/>
But the idea of a "cowboy with a conscience" who has a clear sense of "right <br/>
and wrong" isn't at all like a 17th century Japanese ronin. The cowboys with a <br/>
conscience and a clear sense of right and wrong weren't thrust into their <br/>
roles as hired gunfighters. They were American, with the unique American culture <br/>
of having freely chosen this path. Usually they were searching for adventures. <br/>
<br/>
A typical 17th century Japanese ronin usually started out life as a samurai <br/>
who lived in a castle and served a lord. Then something happened in his life; <br/>
in the 17th century, it usually was that his clan was defeated and abolished. I <br/>
remember one of the ronin in SEVEN SAMURAI telling his old pal Kanbei (the <br/>
leader of the band of ronin) about how his castle fell and he barely escaped -- <br/>
and thus became a ronin, a samurai with no lord to serve.  Unlike the American <br/>
gunfighters, neither clan samurai nor ronin would choose their path; they <br/>
were born into it. And in the case of the ronin, fate came along and cast them <br/>
into the path of ronin. Mostly a ronin would want to survive.<br/>
<br/>
And then we get to the "code." One of the biggest misconceptions by <br/>
westerners is that Japanese samurai all lived by a written code of "Bushido." In the <br/>
17th century, no such code had ever been drawn up at all. Most clans had their <br/>
own codes of conduct, mainly about how to behave as members of the particular <br/>
clan. Some of these particular codes would discuss dealings with commoners, but <br/>
some did not. You can read some of these documents in the Samurai Archives <br/>
Message Board. But there were plenty of samurai who never bothered with these <br/>
codes. Same with the ronin of the 17th century. <br/>
<br/>
You notice that, in THE SEVEN SAMURAI, when the farmers come to recruit some <br/>
ronin, most of the ronin turn up their noses -- that last thing on this earth <br/>
that they would want to do is defend some farmers. Especially when the farmers <br/>
offer nothing more than room and board. These ronin are searching for fame <br/>
and fortune and want to be recruited by a feudal clan, not some peasants. So the <br/>
idea that most ronin would come eagerly to the aid of farmers is another <br/>
myth, another misconception. <br/>
<br/>
And it's probably true that in the Old American West, most hired gunfighters <br/>
wouldn't want to come to the aid of some Mexican peasants. But for different <br/>
reasons. Western gunfighters didn't look for positions with a feudal clan -- <br/>
mainly because feudal clans didn't exist in the U.S.A.  Most western American <br/>
gunfighters chose their paths and were looking for adventures. Unlike the 17th <br/>
century Japanese ronin, who were looking mainly to survive. Any American <br/>
gunfighter could retire when he wished and take up farming or work in a bank or go <br/>
to college if he chose. A Japanese ronin had none of these choices. <br/>
<br/>
In short, 19th century American gunfighters and 17th century Japanese ronin <br/>
lived in entirely different cultures. These factors must be remembered when <br/>
comparing THE SEVEN SAMURAI with THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I agree with you.  Sorry that what I wrote didn't make that <br/>
clear.  Hollywood cowboys are famously "free agents" who decide "a <br/>
man's got'ta do what a man's got'ta do" after some outrage committed <br/>
by the bad guy of the piece.  To say they are anything like samauria <br/>
as a culture or a class of warriors is just a sloppy <br/>
western "shorthand".  Sorry I didn't make that clearer.<br/>

You are absolutely correct that film are not really good guides to actual<br/>
history. Both films, in many ways, deal with mythologies. But the<br/>
mythologies come from different cultures, different sources. <br/>
<br/>
MAGNIFICENT SEVEN comes from Western American mythology, that of the noble<br/>
gunfighter who helps Mexican peasants. When in fact most Western gunfighters<br/>
were quite mercentary and many of them hated Mexicans. <br/>
<br/>
SEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the noble ronin who helps<br/>
peasants. When in fact, most Japanese ronin were mostly interested in<br/>
connecting with a clan. And they saw themselves as being apart from and<br/>
superior to the farmers. <br/>
<br/>
However, the realities from which these mythologies spring from are quite<br/>
different. Once again: 19th century Western gunfighters were not the same at<br/>
all as 17th century Japanese ronin.<br/>

plots of  Mizoguchi or Ozu even if he made the settings American he <br/>
would probably be known as a 'Japanese' director. Kurosawa films are <br/>
great as films but weak on history and place many times.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the case of several of the Kurosawa chanbara films the myths are <br/>
western, King Lear, MacBeth and Red Harvest. So your watching western <br/>
myths in this case. Once again not good for studying historic Japan.<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since I'm actually not sure of Kurosawa's source for the plot for this <br/>
one, I won't make any definitive statements.  The noble ronin who helps <br/>
peasants doesn't play much of a role in traditional stories, why would <br/>
you think its Japanese in this case?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never said they were. Just that Kurosawa's chanbara films are more <br/>
grounded in Western roots than in Japanese roots on the average. His <br/>
films about modern subject are more distinctly Japanese with plot <br/>
resolutions that most Americans won't enjoy. A good example would be <br/>
'The Bad Sleep Well".<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899150677">I read in Donald Richie's Japanese film book that there were some<br/>
"left-wing" movies made in the 1920s and 1930s that showed down-and-out<br/>
ronin aiding farmers. One of them, I forget the name, but it was directed by<br/>
Ito Daisuke, about a ronin who is avenging a death. He finds himself a<br/>
fugitive and is sheltered by some farmers and he and the farmers join forces<br/>
to combat the lord of the fief, who is taxing the farmers practically to<br/>
death. I haven't seen this film and I'd like to someday. <br/>
<br/>
Also I've read about "noble ronin who help peasants" films in some of the<br/>
other film books. They apparently started to appear in Japanese film around<br/>
the late 50s/early 60s or so. Gosha Hideo did THREE OUTLAW SAMURAI around<br/>
that time, which is about some ronin who come to the aid of farmers.<br/>
Apparently he and some of the other directors used the portrayal of ronin as<br/>
a way to show a political viewpoint. <br/>

I forget exactly when SEVEN SAMURAI was made.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923742447">I realize that this isn't a film list but a history list. Still, I have a<br/>
few comments as it relates to western conceptions/misconceptions of Japanese<br/>
samurai. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa may have used some Western sources for some of his movies i.e.<br/>
Macbeth, Red Harvest, King Lear. But he put a Japanese slant on all of these<br/>
stories. I doubt that he was actually trying to emulate Shakespeare or<br/>
Dashiell Hammett. If he were, he would have set his films in England rather<br/>
than in Japan. <br/>
<br/>
Same with John Sturgis, the director of MAGNIFICENT SEVEN put an American<br/>
slant on the SEVEN SAMURAI story. If he had really wanted to make a Japanese<br/>
film, he would have set the film in Japan.Just because MAGNIFICENT SEVEN<br/>
came from a Japanese source, this doesn't make Sturgis a "Japanese<br/>
director." So therefore, I don't think that, in the same way, that you can<br/>
call Kurosawa a "western director." Instead, one might say that these<br/>
directors were influenced by the different cultures. <br/>

plots of  Mizoguchi or Ozu even if he made the settings American he would<br/>
probably be known as a 'Japanese' director. Kurosawa films are great as<br/>

King Lear, MacBeth and Red Harvest. So your watching western myths in this<br/>
case. Once again not good for studying historic Japan.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since I'm actually not sure of Kurosawa's source for the plot for this one,<br/>
I won't make any definitive statements.  The noble ronin who helps peasants<br/>
doesn't play much of a role in traditional stories, why would you think its<br/>
Japanese in this case?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never said they were. Just that Kurosawa's chanbara films are more grounded<br/>
in Western roots than in Japanese roots on the average. His films about<br/>
modern subject are more distinctly Japanese with plot resolutions that most<br/>
Americans won't enjoy. A good example would be 'The Bad Sleep Well".<br/>

I read in Donald Richie's Japanese film book that there were some<br/>
"left-wing" movies made in the 1920s and 1930s that showed down-and-out<br/>
ronin aiding farmers. One of them, I forget the name, but it was directed by<br/>
Ito Daisuke, about a ronin who is avenging a death. He finds himself a<br/>
fugitive and is sheltered by some farmers and he and the farmers join forces<br/>
to combat the lord of the fief, who is taxing the farmers practically to<br/>
death. I haven't seen this film and I'd like to someday. <br/>
<br/>
Also I've read about "noble ronin who help peasants" films in some of the<br/>
other film books. They apparently started to appear in Japanese film around<br/>
the late 50s/early 60s or so. Gosha Hideo did THREE OUTLAW SAMURAI around<br/>
that time, which is about some ronin who come to the aid of farmers.<br/>
Apparently he and some of the other directors used the portrayal of ronin as<br/>
a way to show a political viewpoint. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm not sure that relegate is the right word. Mizoguchi and Ozu were <br/>
great directors in their own right and if I had to use jidai-geki films <br/>
to get a feel for historical Japan, I think these directors do a much <br/>
better job than Kurosawa getting the social feel right. Along those <br/>
lines, something like Twilight Samurai is probably a bit better as well. <br/>
As for the phrase Japanese director, I would give it two meanings, the <br/>
obvious one and the one that means a director that copies Japanese film <br/>
style and plot to the extent that their movies seem more like Japanese <br/>
films that would normally only be made in Japan. I doubt they would play <br/>
well in America since the only great imported hits from Japan seem to be <br/>
the violent ones, anime excepted.<br/>
<br/>
If I could make films as well as Ozu or others, I would take pride in it <br/>
even if they were copies, but I'm not Hollywood.<br/>

 You are absolutely correct that film are not really good guides to actual<br/>
 history. Both films, in many ways, deal with mythologies. But the<br/>
 mythologies come from different cultures, different sources. <br/>
 <br/>
 MAGNIFICENT SEVEN comes from Western American mythology, that of the noble<br/>
 gunfighter who helps Mexican peasants. When in fact most Western gunfighters<br/>
 were quite mercentary and many of them hated Mexicans. <br/>
 <br/>
 SEVEN SAMURAI come from Japanese mythology of the noble ronin who helps<br/>
 peasants. When in fact, most Japanese ronin were mostly interested in<br/>
 connecting with a clan. And they saw themselves as being apart from and<br/>
 superior to the farmers. <br/>
 <br/>
 However, the realities from which these mythologies spring from are quite<br/>
 different. Once again: 19th century Western gunfighters were not the same at<br/>
 all as 17th century Japanese ronin.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I agree, but many Japanese think of Kurosawa as a WESTERN director so his<br/>
 chanbara films is some ways don't either. So maybe when comparing the two<br/>
 films they are a bit closer than one would think. Of course a better example<br/>
 would be to read Dashiel Hammet's 'Red Harvest' and watch Yojimbo knowing<br/>
 that Kurosawa is a fan of detective novels.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I think films in general are poor guides to history. Anerican westerns are<br/>
 for the most part phony as well having known people who actually lived in<br/>
 the period there. For really quick reads Anthony Bryant's books are pretty<br/>
 good and for a sloppy but readily available introduction one of the Turnbull<br/>
 books is OK. Just don't bother with the ninja one, the rest are pretty much<br/>
 rehashes of his previous ones.<br/>

There's a small well done book about the film in the BFI Film Classics <br/>
Series (simply Seven Samurai-BFI Film Classics). You should be able to <br/>
get it through Amazon.com or a large bookstore.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The Seven Samurai DVD from the Criterion Collection has the best and<br/>
most interesting commentary that I've heard on a DVD. You should get<br/>
your hands on that.</div>

 </span></blockquote>US theatrical release was November 19, 1956, which<br/>
likely means it was out in Japan in 1954-55. <br/>
