It's not uncommon for Japanese to have two (or more) gravesites. Even <br/>
Will Adams, the English ship captain that James Clavell based Shogun <br/>
upon, has at least two gravesites. My wife's birthmother's ashes are <br/>
buried in her family 'plot' and also in her husband's 'plot'. Since <br/>
cremation was quite common, ashes could easily be buried in several <br/>
locations. If someone died far from home, the body would usually be <br/>
buried or cremated where it was and sometimes only a lock of hair or <br/>
keepsake would make it back to their family. This would usually be <br/>
cremated/buried as well. More than a few 'gravesites' are purely <br/>
symbolic as well, particularly if they are on the grounds of a shrine.</div>
