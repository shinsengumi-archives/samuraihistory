<br/>
Japanese martial arts, particularly those descended from classical-<br/>
era ones, are a distinctive combination of art and science. Borne of <br/>
hundreds of years of internecine warfare, there were (at <br/>
conservative estimates) over 1000 different systems of combative <br/>
technique, each with their own peculiarities. What survives of these <br/>
are fascinating artifacts of the time and place of their development <br/>
that offer modern students a unique opportunity to practice an <br/>
ancient form.<br/>
<br/>
According to a myth, the islands of Japan were formed by the two <br/>
deities Izanagi and Izanami. They dipped their spear into the ocean, <br/>
churned it, and created the first island, Onogoro, from the drops of <br/>
salty water which fell from the spear. In those early myths, gods <br/>
are described as partaking in ritual combat (wrestling, probably a <br/>
very ancient forerunner to modern Sumo) and using weapons as tools <br/>
for creation as well as destruction.<br/>
<br/>
From 1200-1600, Japan was at war with herself, and large-scale <br/>
armored combat flourished. Martial arts of this period all featured <br/>
effective use of pole arms (spears, glaives and the like), some <br/>
sword, and general rudimentary grappling. By the time of the Battle <br/>
of Sekigahara in 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved into the final stage of <br/>
unifying a large number of independent fiefs under a central, <br/>
consolidated power. He established a new capital, Tokyoto (or Edo), <br/>
and contrived ways to keep the local rulers unable to mount <br/>
challenges to his authority.<br/>
<br/>
As the relative peace and isolation of the Tokugawa era took hold <br/>
(trade was shut-down with outside countries except through two very <br/>
tightly controlled ports), the warrior class had less to do. <br/>
Individuals began to develop combative skills that were less <br/>
applicable to battlefield-use and more geared toward defending one's <br/>
employer and duelling. Warriors traveled from province to province <br/>
and challenged the best instructors; this was known as Musha Shugyo <br/>
(warrior's austerities). If the shugyosha (person undergoing the <br/>
training) lost, then he would become a student of the victor. Thus <br/>
famous systems were modified to suit specific needs for this type of <br/>
encounter. Arts also specialized in only a few weapons. <br/>
<br/>
This was a contrast to the preceding warring-states period, where <br/>
Bushi (martial experts) of higher class were expected to be familiar <br/>
with everything from archery to dressage, and spears to dirks.<br/>
<br/>
For the next two centuries, the role of the warrior caste changed, <br/>
which was reflected in the arts that they practiced and taught. In <br/>
the mid 1800's, Japan was reopened to the rest of the world. By the <br/>
late 1800's many members of the recently-abolished Samurai class <br/>
suddenly found themselves without stipends, so began teaching <br/>
commoners (which was previously considered in poor taste). It bears <br/>
mention that what was taught publicly was the Omote (outside, front-<br/>
face) of an art; the Ura (rear, what is not immediately apparent) <br/>
was still held in reserve for a select few.<br/>
<br/>
While more comprehensive arts were still being taught, Kano Jigoro <br/>
founded the Kodokan (house for study of the way) in 1882. Kano <br/>
adapted the dangerous techniques of classical jujutsu into the sport <br/>
of Judo (a kind of jacket wrestling). By doing so, Kano contributed <br/>
a critical element of bringing obscure war arts to the general <br/>
populace. Japanese combative disciplines were also taken abroad <br/>
(U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was an active student of Judo).<br/>
<br/>
In the late teens, the arts of Okinawa (tode, te or karate- <br/>
originally meaning China hand, now empty hand) were imported to the <br/>
main islands of Japan. These civilian boxing systems became popular <br/>
in Okinawa in primary and secondary schools (as Judo had done in <br/>
Japan). Note that karate is really outside of the purview <br/>
of 'Japanese fighting disciplines', but has become strongly <br/>
identified with Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Other popular Japanese arts that emerged during the last century <br/>
include Shorinji Kempo (founded by a Japanese monk who combined <br/>
Chinese and Japanese methods), Aikido (based on classical jujutsu) <br/>
and Kendo (way of the sword, based on classical swordsmanship; kendo <br/>
has been in existence for 200 years but was standardized in the <br/>
early 1900's). Though none of these arts have the depth or <br/>
complexity of their forbears, they still manage to provide a glimpse <br/>
into the ancient Japanese fighting arts and are accessible to people <br/>
of all ages and backgrounds.<br/>
