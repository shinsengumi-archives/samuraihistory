<h3>samurai curse</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500127266">I was born in Japan, Japanese mother, caucasian father.  My mother told <br/>

That aside, I've noticed that Japanese families have this concept of <br/>
a "family curse" that I've never seen in the US (except in movies), <br/>
and have obsessions that they are afflicted by it, and have thier <br/>
little "put the salt on the door" rituals to keep the evil spirits at <br/>
bay. I've seen it firsthand (the obsessions, not the results).  Not <br/>
much more to say, other than I don't think family curses are real... <br/>
at all, but that is my own possibly eccentric and idiosyncratic <br/>
opinion. To be cliche, the more you believe in it, the more real it <br/>
becomes.<br/>

I don't think John Edwards posts to the list, but someone here more <br/>
attuned to the supernatural might be able to help you out more than I.<br/>

<br/>
Do what any superstitious Japanese person would do-go to any local Shinto priest (in your case, have the 'family still in Japan' do it) and have them remove the 'curse' through a purificiation ceremony. In fact, I find it hard to believe that it hasn't already been done (generations ago) if it is indeed taken so seriously.<br/>
Although I don't believe in curses (most are directly linked to people attributing the bad events in their life to outside sources rather than the cold hard facts-in the old days, genetic disorders passed down through bloodlines were also considered curses), just having the ceremony can help break the chain of negative thought.<br/>
As Kitsuno said, the salt would be good too-the Shinto priest would likely suggest it be done as well.</div>

likely not to make funny faces and roll his eyes, is <br/>
probably more than happy to take a consulting fee, and might <br/>
even come up with something (the old "egg in a sock under <br/>

about itself and its misfortunes. Otherwise, you must be kidding? Of <br/>
course, you can dedicate yourself to holy acts to try to offset your <br/>
bad karma if that will make you feel better. <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] samurai curse</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767420574">Natalie-<br/>
	Let me say that I am no believer in curses myself, and I was just as  <br/>
skeptical as others who have already responded. One way to look at  <br/>
this though, would be to accept it as a very cool way to find out  <br/>
about your Japanese heritage.<br/>
	You need to look into your family history and see if you can  <br/>
identify the people or events responsible for the curse. Then of  <br/>
course you'll have to learn about esoteric religious practice in  <br/>
Japan, which ceremonies of exorcism have been performed and which  <br/>
ones might help to lift the curse.<br/>
	You'll want to study the language and necessarily will have to know  <br/>
your  cousins better. this might make a cool documentary done  <br/>
correctly or a good book. The idea at least is more interesting than  <br/>
many of the "I lived in Japan" books out there.<br/>
	Be careful of course, you could end up spending a lot of money on a  <br/>
fraud or get caught up in a cult, but the chance to learn about who  <br/>
you are, and perhaps face a real demon is too tempting. I say this  <br/>
has to be your personal mission, not one we can help much with but  <br/>
that I would love to hear about.<br/>
	Go for broke!<br/>

unbiased observer rather than a believer.  Having had firsthand <br/>
experience with a Japanese family with a "curse" (and therefore, <br/>
contrary to what Natalie says, am less "ignorant" of such things <br/>
than she is) I noticed that half the people don't believe it at all, <br/>
and the other half ONLY bring up the "curse" when something goes <br/>
wrong. Then they stress and put bags of salt on the doors and <br/>
windows, and at least one joined a psuedo-born again christian cult <br/>
in order to exorcise the curse.  It would be absolutely interesting <br/>
and worthwhile for her to explore her family's roots in documentary <br/>
form, but she seems too caught up in it to do so.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942510167">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
The real problem with the Samurai Curse story as given so far is that <br/>
it is just too generalized. Most of these curse things are attached to <br/>
some specific wrong or other which is often reversed in Shintoh <br/>
practice by holding some sort of annual commemorative festival. A good <br/>
example of this is the Soga brothers. This is written about in the book <br/>
Avatars of Vengence. So, even in a Japanese context it doesn't make a <br/>
whole lot of sense. As for Buddhist practice, the idea here is that you <br/>
inherit things from your own past lives not from your ancestors. There <br/>
are a few ancestor worship religious traditions in Japan which might be <br/>
of interest in the context of this ancestor's curse business.</div>
