<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018660596">"A film that I did not see mention. I beleive that it is a recent release. Is TABOU think I am speeling it correct. Has anyone seen this moive and what are your thoughts on it."<br/>
<br/>
I think it's "Taboo" (as in 'forbidden') although it was released here in the UK under its Japanese title of Gohatto. The title refers to the subject matter, 'manly love' between samurai.<br/>
<br/>
From a martial arts perspective, I rate Gohatto as the best 'swordsmanship' film there is. The difference between dojo fencing and the real thing is marked, as if the different styles of the combatants themselves. Gohatto, along with Master and Commander and Band of Brothers is wearing out my CD player. After that comes any of the (earlier) Kurosawas.<br/>
<br/>
On this issue of the subject matter of the film there can be no question, although quite how we discuss the issue without a 21st century mindset is problematic. Samurai were not homosexual, but the practice of male love was known and widespread, even though frowned upon. Almost every great name in Japanese history has some connection (that might be an overstatement) but I have heard it suggested that Oda Nobunaga, Uesugi Kenshin and even Ieyasu had 'close' (if you will allow that as an euphemism) male companions.<br/>
<br/>
Saikaku has written a book 'Comrade Loves of the Samurai' and the Hagakure devotes a chapter to it. As I say, it was discreet, but by no means uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
Note to Moderators: Perhaps, in an attempt to disuade ninja wanabees, we suggest they follow the Hagakure's advice of finding an older and more experienced man to 'educate' them?<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: The practice was widespread in Europe also, and where men were sexually active then partners of either gender were acceptable. In London in the 17th century there were more 'gay bars' than today - the discrimination we have inherited is Victorian, and we have to shake this off if we are to view the past with a proper historicity. The practice survives, of course, in the English Public School system!<br/>
<br/>
ASIDE NOTE: If anyone remembers the furore over the film 'Interview With The Vampire' and the implied homosexuality, this is a case in point. The homosexuality was not implied, nor was it active, but what was portrayed was a close relationship between two male friends prior to the 'distancing' that occurred post Victorian era.<br/>
<br/>
Strong matriarchal cultures tend towards the practice. Greece, and specifically Sparta, for example.<br/>
<br/>
There are military men on this list. Now I am NOT saying that they are homosexual, but I AM saying (from what I have come to understand) that the bonds between men who have seen combat draws them closer than the usual social restrictions would be comfortable with - such men can show care, kindness, consideration and compassion with and for each other, with no hint nor taint of sexuality, but simply a 'togetherness' that most women treat as normal - please don't read me wrong, I am not implying any sexual content, but I am saying a soldier will hold and comfort a wounded comrade without fear or question of his or his comrade's masculinity.<br/>
<br/>
Likwise, a samurai would cry at the drop of the hat, but no-one would think of calling him a sissy.<br/>
