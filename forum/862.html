<h3>dishonorable samurais</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787040567">Althought the emperor was shifting alliance as was needed and no one daimyo (province) truly represented the interests of the emperor against the shogunate.  <br/>
~~~i am quite confused. isn't a daimyo a some sort of a land-owner not a province?<br/>
<br/>
~~~i have read that a daimyo gives a samurai benefits for fighting and protecting his land. in case the daimyo becomes injured, paralyzed or sick, can a powerful and strong samurai sort-of rebel, in such a way that he would demand more benefits from the disabled daimyo? i know that he could be severely punished for this but what if his fellow samurais support him? is that possible? i know that they have their code but what if there are some dishonorable samurais out there. can they do that?<br/>
what would be the implications of their actions?<br/>

I was simply saying province or daimyo controlling the province depending on how you wished to say it.  I did not intend to make them appear to be the same.<br/>
