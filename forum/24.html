 </span></blockquote>Sure.  Here is a stack of stuff from my "BOOKS" archive.  BUT FIRST - I should say a thing or two about myself.  I have collected Japanese swords for 35 years, which means of course a passionate interest in "the Samurai" and all things pertaining thereto - although I do not "do" martial arts.  I was curious to see this new list and subscribed immediately.  In what follows below, not all the words are mine.  I have trawled through my voluminous archive to peel out the references below.  I have more, but this will do for a start.  If I have breached "your" list etiquette with too long a post please let me know...<br/>

Blaker, and published by Charles E. Tuttle Company. ISBN 0-8048-1094-x<br/>
0297-000333-4615.  This is a more recent version, possibly an authorised<br/>
reprint.  A copy I had some years ago was a 'second edition' published in<br/>
about 1934 but the details are not immediately to hand.  I am tempted to<br/>
think that this book was Clavell's inspiration for his "Shogun".  However,<br/>
"The Needlewatcher" is a better book by far.<br/>

<br/>
"Japanese Sword-Fittings and Associated Metalwork" by "Collections Baur<br/>
and B.W. Robinson", Viking Penguin, 1980  $265.00  (I take it this is NOT<br/>
the same as the much cheaper BW Robinson book that's recently out-of-print?)<br/>
<br/>
(They have the Compton 100 Masterpieces book for $60)<br/>
<br/>
"Swords of the Samurai" by Washington State University Press (editor),<br/>
1981, paperback, $14.95<br/>
<br/>
Most of those are special-order books (2-6 weeks).  Stuff that they stock<br/>
(including Yumoto, Yoshihara & Kapp, etc) they can ship in 2-3 days and<br/>
is often 20-30% off list price (including Yumoto and Yoshihara & Kapp).<br/>
Another interesting book I noticed was a translation of the screenplays<br/>
for the 7 Samurai and some other Kurosawa films.<br/>
==================================================<br/>
(4).  There is a charming autobiography of an Edo period con man called<br/>
"Misui's Story" and published by the University of New Mexico Press.  He<br/>
tells about hustling sword fittings and doing "mix and match" that truly<br/>
sound like the Chicago Show in the old days.  High flown assertions of<br/>
the "art of the sword" and finger waving lectures about moral purity being<br/>
the base of sword appreciation might ought be balanced by this other reality<br/>
of sword appreciation.<br/>
==================================================<br/>
(5).  the local antique bookshop has turned up a copy of "Rodrigues the<br/>
Interpreter " by Michael Cooper (Weatherhill. Tokyo 1974).  The book is the<br/>
true life story of Joao Rodrigues who was a Jesuit priest and was the<br/>
interpreter for Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.  This is an<br/>
interesting part of early Japanese history.<br/>
==================================================<br/>
(6).  If you can find a copy in your library, get "They Came to Japan"<br/>
I do not remember the author, but it is a compilation of letters and<br/>
documents sent back from Japan up until the Tokugawa closed the country<br/>
down. The material is divided into various subjects, rather than various<br/>
complete letters. There are vivid descriptions of body mutilations, and the<br/>
opinion of some of the correspondents was that to know a Japanese was to<br/>
know an executioner. Remember, part of this period was during the Sengoku<br/>
Jidai, and at one, Kyoto was in ruins, and the Emperor was reduced to<br/>
begging with a bowl. If these accounts do not satisfy your blood lust<br/>
concerning the swords, nothing will.<br/>

Hi All,<br/>
I like the idea of a first edition but they can get pretty expensive<br/>
especially when one wants to read and study it. So Amazon.com also can get<br/>
this title for less than $20. However you may have to wait a couple of weeks for<br/>
shipping.<br/>

Hello Chris, Cary, Peter, Barry, Gordon and all:<br/>
I was looking through Japanese reference books in the Yale library stacks<br/>
with my friend, Hideki Takei, and we found a very interesting little two<br/>
volume edition (about 2" x5") from 1696 called "Ambassades des Hollandaises<br/>
vers l'Empereur du Japon" - that's French for "Dutch Embassies to the<br/>
Emperor of Japan". Does anybody know of this book, and whether there were<br/>
ever any more modern reprints? I just barely had time to glance at it<br/>
before pressing it on a reference librarian to place in the rare book and<br/>
manuscript library.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Shirogitsune<br/>

Dear Phil:<br/>
It is my understanding that part of the special relationship that the Dutch<br/>
maintained with Shogunate whilst Japan was closed to others was an annual<br/>
report. It was through these reports that the Tokugawa kept abreast of<br/>
developments outside of Japan. Perhaps this book set is a record of such<br/>
report(s).<br/>
<br/>
Sounds interesting. Please keep us informed should you go back for another<br/>
look.<br/>

Hi Jim:<br/>
Thanks for the note. What little I read of the book I mentioned was<br/>
pretty interesting but I was translating from the French "freehand" (no<br/>
Larousse by my side, although I suppose if I'd had more time, I could have<br/>
dragged that off the shelves too) and that made the reading really slow -<br/>
actually just a few glimpses but it looked quite detailed, descriptions of<br/>
clothing were particularly interesting, although old hat to us now.<br/>

Subject: A naive look at the Samurai of a bygone era.      [1863_edo.doc]<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The following excerpt is from the November, 1863 issue of Harper's New Monthly Magazine. It is part of a lengthy article entitled "Pictures of the Japanese". While the article as a whole is extremely complimentary of all aspects of Japan's lifestyle, I found the following paragraph to be refreshing in a naive sort of way. I would love to see this article republished in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
"One of the first things which strikes us in our studies of street life in Yeddo is that there are two classes wholly distinct in manners, habits, and character. The official class, consisting of the nobles, with their throngs of idle retainers, and the common people. The retainers of the nobles, known as Samourai or Yaconin, are entitled to wear two swords. They are the perfect types of the Swashbucklers once so common in the European cities; swaggering, blustering bullies, usually drunk, and always insolent, loitering about the drinking houses, ready to give a thrust or a blow to any one who comes in their way, and especially prone to insult foreigners. They constitute the only dangerous class in Yeddo; to them is to be charged the long series of outrages and murders which have marked the history of foreign missions to Japan.<br/>
<br/>
"The common people, on the other hand, are a remarkably good-tempered, quiet race; ingenious, industrious, and courteous always..."<br/>
<br/>
Interesting? I can't help but wonder if the Samurai of a previous era would look upon these later "Samurai" as something of an anomaly. Is this the same group of guys who ushered in such concepts as being "insulted" if someone's scabbard touched theirs, and some of the other mannerisms emulated today as proper Samurai etiquette?<br/>

<br/>
For those who are interested there was a nice little book published after <br/>
the TV mini-series by Univ. California Berkeley Press called I believe <br/>
"Learning from Shogun". It is a series of essays by Japanese history <br/>
scholars and one Elizabethan scholar comparing the "history" in Shogun <br/>
with real Japanese history. Very interesting, as I remember they thought <br/>
Cavell (sp) had done his homework, but had changed things for dramatic <br/>
purposes, though heaven only knows the real history was dramatic enough. <br/>
The Toranaga character was based upon Iyeyasu and the time frame of the <br/>
novel/series was the 6-8 months before Sekigahara. A big example of how <br/>
history was changed is the character of Mariko. This character certainly <br/>
is based upon Gracia Hosokawa, but her story is considered one of the 3 <br/>
greatest love stories in Japanese history. Her husband Hosokawa so loved <br/>
his wife that he did not have her killed when Akechi killed Oda. Instead <br/>
he had her sent to a remote castle for 5 years. Out of sight is out of <br/>
mind, and when the political heat came down after Hideyoshi was totally <br/>
in power, the Gracia re-appeared in her husband's family. The prudent <br/>
thing for the Hosokawa to do would have been to kill her immediately. <br/>
After all the Hosokawa themselves could have been destroyed with such a <br/>
ready made excuse. This husband and wife love story is at complete odds <br/>
with the Shogun story. Then there was the problem that Gracia Hosokawa <br/>
is supposed to have become a Christian, but there is no record of her <br/>
ever even seeing a Jesuit from a distance. Her baptism was via one of <br/>
her ladies in waiting who was a Christian. There is no record of her <br/>
knowing any language but Japanese. But, Shogun is a rip roaring yarn <br/>
that certainly catches the flavor of Japan in 1600.<br/>
<br/>
BTW the Blackthorne character is real also and based very nicely on Will <br/>
Adams. An example of Chavell (sp) homework: the name of the Dutch ship <br/>
was "Erasmus" in the novel. Adam's Dutch ship was called "Das Liefe", <br/>
but it had a different name earlier in its career as a ship--"Erasmus"!<br/>

Subject: Books (was Obit)<br/>
<br/>
Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of good reads, I just finished a book someone recommended to me at<br/>
last year's SF sword show when he saw me walking around with a reprint of<br/>
one of Hiroshige's 53 stations of the Tokaido series of prints (a gift,<br/>
BTW, from that notorious print bandit Prof. Shirogitsune).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's called Japanese Inn, by Oliver Statler (ISBN 0824808185), and<br/>
tells the story in a way reminiscent of the late James Michner of an inn<br/>
along the Tokaido, the famous road that connects Kyoto with Tokyo (Edo).<br/>
<br/>
Spanning the time from the mid-1500s through the 1950s, he manages to<br/>
convey many of the important occurrences of Japanese history as they<br/>
touched the inn, including the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate and fall of<br/>
Takeda, Will Adams (mentioned below), the 47 ronin, Tesshu, Saigo,<br/>
Hiroshige and many more I can't remember.<br/>
<br/>
The book also describes many aspects of day to day Japanese life during the<br/>
period.<br/>
<br/>
I found a hard back copy in a used bookstore for $9, but Amazon sells the<br/>
paperback for $9.56. Not too much specifically about the sword, but a<br/>
wonderful book. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else read it?<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Michael A.<br/>
