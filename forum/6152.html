<div id="ygrps-yiv-495814952">Yeah, I apologize, Mr. Wilson.  You did make an effort.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I came home from work extra tired and cranky.  I spent the day taking care of a couple of newborn infants whose stupid drug-infested <br/>
mothers do stupid things to them.  Like one of them putting methadone in her infant's formula to shut him up.....  and it almost <br/>
worked permanently.  Mom tried to pin it on her 7 year old.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't justify my being rude, though. I should have taken my nap before I checked my email.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for taking a potshot at you in my frustration, Mr. Wilson.  I will try to play nice again.<br/>

Now, now, let's all be nice. I think the spelling<br/>
thing has been beaten to the ground (mostly by me).<br/>
He's making an effort, and that's what I ask for.<br/>
