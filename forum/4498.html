<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Japanese of old was not stupid. They recognized tyrant leaders when <br/>
happened, and there is why so many villagers suicidal revolutions happened <br/>
in Japan history against bad daimyos when things got really bad! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a thing ye hast forgot.... <br/>
He was not "playing in his own country". Japan was not a country at that <br/>
time, but MANY countries. Many nations. <br/>
So, he did exactly the same, including genocide against people who disagreed <br/>
with him or hated religions... Just like Hitler... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup! That is why I say that Tokugawa was the one who did the right thing, <br/>
And also, doing Japan cultural preservation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who�s "modern-enlightenment-christian influenced standard"? <br/>
<br/>
My Individual Liberties line of though is not christian in any way. <br/>
And I think the guy of Sweden guessed what I am. Just would say that I am <br/>
not even an monotheist. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a book saying something different. But is not at this house I am now. <br/>
So I must someday go to my parents house, research the book and tell its <br/>
sources. Lets say that this book is one that also promote Hatsumi Massaaki <br/>
Sensei. <br/>

circumstances. That said, I'd look for a less extreme analogy-For <br/>
instance Julius Caesar: Someone who is seen as ambitious and <br/>
ruthless, but known as both as a destroyer of an old order(republican <br/>
rome) as well as a pioneer of a new order(roman empire). Also, like <br/>
Nobunaga, Caesar's ambitions were fully realized by another not long <br/>
after his demise.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This would be a much better analogy, especially if you think of the way <br/>
they both died....<br/>
But more than this, to return at the beginning of the discussion, <br/>
Caesar is generally seen as a great conqueror, and a brave, fearless <br/>
man. (He was probably more cultivated than Nobunaga as well ;o). Thus, <br/>
the opinions we have in the West about Caesar might somehow <br/>
***resemble*** the ones the Japanese have on Nobunaga.<br/>
Of course, -as you have said- these analogies are always tricky. After <br/>
all, even here the scenario is different, and the temporal difference <br/>
is greater (even thou life and warfare in Nobunaga's times probably <br/>
resembles more Ceasar's Rome than Hitler's Europe...).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... phew... just mention Nobunaga, and see what happens... :oD<br/>
