<h3>I need some lineage info.</h3>
by <i>Alexander M. Frazier</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-565454425">Hello,<br/>
    I am attempting to put together a full family tree ... or one as full as possible with our current information today.<br/>
    In putting this together on the Takeda clan, I have run into a wall. I know that the Takeda family continued through Takeda Kunitsugu 1551-1592. According to the information I have, he was nephew to Takeda Shingen. The problem I'm having here is that None of Takeda Shingen's brothers had any children that lived, and as far as I can tell, none of them had any sons named Kunitsugu.<br/>
    The best that I can figure is that Takeda Kunitsugu was from the female half of the line . . . the son of one of the married daughters. I don't know if that works correctly, though. He still bore the name Takeda, and in other societies, a woman married into another family took on the name of that family.<br/>
    If you have the information I'm looking for, please email me. I very much want to trace the line of the Takedas up to Takeda Kunitsugu, going through Takeda Sokichi and finally Takeda Sakaku and his son Takeda Tokemune.<br/>
    I also would not mind it if you had some information on the Aizu clan. The house Saigo specifically. Takeda Sakaku, according to the facts I have, was sent to live with Saigo Tanomo during the wars.<br/>
    Any info you have will be helpful. This is for a martial arts study of Daito ryu. I know that the art passed from Kunitsugu to Soemon, then passed to Sakaku through Saigo Tanomo who had learned it from Takeda Soemon.<br/>
    Again, any info you have would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Alex Frazier<br/>

<br/>
I am new to this group and should perhaps wait to see what happens <br/>
with this, but I will throw in my two cents anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What sources have you used so far?  Where did the "information that <br/>
you have" come from?  Can you read Japanese?  Modern _and_ Classical?<br/>
<br/>
Be much easier to point you in the right direction with these things <br/>
included in your mail (for the newcomers at least).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497145198">I'd skip the middleman altogether, and go strait to Turnbull's <br/>
SOURCE - Papinot's "Historical and Geographical Dictonary of Japan" <br/>
It's where most of Turnbulls bio's and information came from - he <br/>
also faithfully reproduced some of the mistakes... yet doesnt <br/>
actually SITE the book in his 'references' section....<br/>
