<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007926068">Hello Chris, hi everyone.<br/>
<br/>
  I would like to address some of the questions pointed by Chris on the<br/>
herein below message. I hope they will add in a positive manner to this<br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
  May it please the fellow list members (smile)<br/>

  1. Did samurai exist before they were made into a class?<br/>
  ---<br/>
  It depends on your concept of Samurai. This step supercedes mere lexical<br/>
speculation. Defining a term avoids ambiguity and rhetoric usage of words<br/>
("doublespeak", as in "1984"). For this brief discussion, I hold "Samurai"<br/>
as a social class, and, hence, any statement containing to members of a<br/>
Samurai class before its ascension unto a social class cannot be considered<br/>
valid. If you define "Samurai" as "retainer", then there were members of a<br/>
Samurai class before it was turned into a social class. What should be<br/>
avoided, if possible, is the usage of the word "Samurai" with both meanings,<br/>
under a single context.<br/>
<br/>
  ---<br/>
  2. Why is legitimacy by the government so important to the abolishment of<br/>
the class of samurai?<br/>
  ---<br/>
  Please consider the "Language Systems" Philosophical School of Thought, if<br/>
you will. Think of any given "due process of law" - if the highest court in<br/>
a country utters "the sky is yellow", no matter any what other language (as<br/>
the scientific) holds, the sky is yellow, because the State will have the<br/>
power to enforce the ruling. Will it make the sky turn yellow before other<br/>
language systems (as the ones pertaining to human perception)? Definitely<br/>
not. However, the given State may enforce the ruling, for, before the Legal<br/>
Language System, "the sky is yellow".<br/>
  ThatÂ´s why the person uttering the language is so important: dynamic<br/>
validity arises from the utterance process and uttering person. Static<br/>
validity - the contents of the ruling - is assessed at a later stage. Sure,<br/>
this may be unjust, unfair, incorrect and inefficient - however valid,<br/>
nonetheless.<br/>
  Such School of Thought, although supported by many researchers, is not an<br/>
unanimity. Please do not take me as a zealot for it, but it is an<br/>
interesting tool of investigation which should be considered.<br/>

  3. Why did some samurai families hide their swords instead of obeying the<br/>
government?<br/>
  ---<br/>
  Sorry, I do not hold enough data in order to address this topic.<br/>
  ---<br/>
  4. When the WW II officers carried swords did they, the military, or<br/>
anyone else consider them samurai?<br/>
  ---<br/>
  Again, sorry, but I do not hold enough data in order to address this<br/>
topic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Again, I hope those ideas are proper to this tread.<br/>
<br/>
  Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

  I'm trying to grasp the whole "There are no Samurai" argument by patching<br/>
up some holes in my thought process.<br/>
<br/>
  1. Did samurai exist before they were made into a class?<br/>
<br/>
  2. Why is legitimacy by the government so important to the abolishment of<br/>
the class of samurai?<br/>
<br/>
  3. Why did some samurai families hide their swords instead of obeying the<br/>
government?<br/>
<br/>
  4. When the WW II officers carried swords did they, the military, or<br/>
anyone else consider them samurai?<br/>
