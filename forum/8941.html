believe in the fact that there have been *any* greeks or romans who ever <br/>

record of that, it sure would be a sensation.<br/>

And the fact that you say you recovered the records in Hungry of the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one travelled to Japan with an army in the 1500s - I think you are<br/>
mistaking some sort of folk tale with history.  Definately a folk tale<br/>
never told in Japan, maybe one told somewhere else, sort of like<br/>
Gulliver's travels or something.</div>

off. Yoshitsune is one of the best documented and written <br/>
about guys of the period. There's not that much that's NOT <br/>
known about him. His birth and upbringing are without question.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-591852364">In terms of "Tengu" being caucasian... check this out :<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This may be more trouble than help, but I know that alot of the X-<br/>
kans for "Ninpo"...specifically the Genbukan... make claims to some <br/>
kind of  ?Macedonian? king comming to Japan and being a major player <br/>
in the formation of the country.<br/>
<br/>
   Actually, I think that the alleged "Amatsu Tatara" scrolls pretty <br/>
much say this King and his group is responsible for most of what <br/>
makes Japan Japan..<br/>
<br/>
  I hold this scrolls in high question mainly because the Genbukan <br/>
claims that only Takamatsu had the scrolls...<br/>
<br/>
 ....but if you research, you will find that the scrolls that <br/>
allegedly make up the "Amatsu Tatara" can be found still in the Kuki <br/>
Family Archives.<br/>
<br/>
    Also, the Kuki family itself claims that the Amatsu Tatara <br/>
scrolls are simply just random Kuki Family (and thus, Nakatomi <br/>
Family) scrolls that Takamatsu copied and compiled randomly.<br/>
<br/>
 So.... what actually happened? What do the scrolls actually <br/>
contain ?<br/>
<br/>
  I have no idea.<br/>
      Kuki family says its crap.<br/>
       Genbukan says its real and teaches that westerners began most <br/>
of the Japanese tradition.<br/>

      I, of course, REALLY REALLY REALLY advise that people not take <br/>
any folk tales or alleged legends immediatly to heart.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805173804">Well, first off I would stop looking at Samurai History sites and  <br/>
even Japanese history and start looking at Folklore and Folktales of  <br/>
Japan. That site is a good start, I think you are on the right path  <br/>
and you'll find more references to Tengu that that one...<br/>

Tengu was originated to Chinese folk tale.<br/>
The first Japanese book that mentions Tengu was Nihonshoki.<br/>
It's just an imaginary creature.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184404097">I agree, the notion that the Kurama Tengu are supposed to be "White Greek <br/>
swordsman" is quite farfetched. I have heard a theory that the Tengu originated <br/>
from stories of Bandits and their terrible deads. What do you think about this <br/>
theory?<br/>
