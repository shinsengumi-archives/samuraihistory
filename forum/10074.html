<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229369386">Greetings All--<br/>
 <br/>
Please pardon a bit of self-promotion, but it IS topical:<br/>
 <br/>
For anyone interested, my samurai tale "Shadows From Firelight"  has just <br/>
appeared in the e-zine Heroic Fantasy Quarterly.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you opt to give it a read, please remember that it's fantasy with a dash <br/>
 of Japanese history.  I've tried to maintain a certain historical  <br/>
verisimilitude, but that said, I've also taken liberties where it benefitted the  <br/>
story.  In essence I've tried to do what has largely been done with the  <br/>
Arthurian legends, combining different myths and elements from various periods  <br/>
in history to create my own world of high adventure.  If nothing  else, I <br/>
hope some of you may enjoy the spirit of it.<br/>
 <br/>
And allow me to pretend than any substantial inaccuracies are really just  <br/>
intentional literary liberties. (Some of them probably are.)<br/>
 <br/>
Should you be interested, just visit HFQ's table-of-contents here:  <br/>

Happy 2010, all!<br/>
