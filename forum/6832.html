Digital Database of Nara Ehon Around the World is an open digital archive <br/>
which makes available works of Nara ehon ("Nara picture books"),<br/>
short illustrated narrative manuscripts produced during the Muromachi to Edo <br/>
periods, in collections from all over the world.<br/>
In terms of format, Nara ehon may be grouped into three categories of <br/>
horizontal books, vertical books, and large vertical books. While the <br/>
bindings of the manuscripts also vary, the most common are ones with navy <br/>
blue covers with designs of autumn grasses in gold pigment and attached with <br/>
vermillion title slips that were sometimes called yomeiri-bon ("trousseau <br/>
books"). The illustrations, provided on a single page or as a spread, may <br/>
generally be grouped to those either executed in the so-called "Nara-e <br/>
style" using inexpensive opaque pigment (doroenogu) or in a more delicately <br/>
rendered luxurious style. Both styles employ the standardized composition of <br/>
framing the top and bottom of the pictorial surface with trailing mist <br/>
(suyari-gasumi). Vivid colors such as vermillion and green are combined with <br/>
lavish uses of gold and silver foils and pigments in Nara ehon, not unlike <br/>
miniatures.<br/>
