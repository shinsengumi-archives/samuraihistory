<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678429376">Does anyone have any suggestions for trying to learn classical Japanese<br/>
language, with the ultimate goal of reading material such as Murasaki<br/>
Shikibu? I found the following on Amazon. Anyone have any experience using<br/>
these books, or have any alternative suggestions? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My impression is that these are the two main texts used for classical <br/>
Japanese teaching in the states.  My professor didn't like them (and <br/>
the Bungo manual is pretty short) and made his own materials to teach <br/>
the class.  I haven't seen the Shirane book, so I can't speak to it, <br/>
but the other has only limited utility.  Get yourself a good classical <br/>
Japanese dictionary (be advised that the iwanami one lists verbs by the <br/>
renyokei) and just start reading texts.  I would suggest that you read <br/>
the introductory matter and the back matter (explains verbs <br/>
conjugations and the joshi and jodoushi) of whichever dictionary you <br/>
buy thoroughly.  Also, it will probably help you to start with texts <br/>
that have translations already so that you can check your progress.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
