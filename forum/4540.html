<div id="ygrps-yiv-304392901">Hey.<br/>
       I don't care for me too posts, but I agree, Nate.  Enough of this <br/>
already.  FROM ALL SIDES.  We've been on this topic for a week and more now, and <br/>
quite frankly, I'm getting really sick of it.  From the posts I've read, we've <br/>
gotten exactly nowhere except to the point of bickering and going off-topic <br/>
(widely!).  The question about whether Nobunaga and Hitler or Vlad Tepes <br/>
(Dracula) or Ivan IV (the Terrible) are comparable are good for a couple days or so <br/>
as long as they stay on topic.  But when we get to what's going around now, it <br/>
is to the point of asking "WHO CARES?!", a point we passed a long time ago.  <br/>
I'm to the point of deleting the messages simply whenever I see this subject, <br/>
I'm so sick of how this subject is turning out.<br/>
<br/>
Peace out.<br/>
Tim<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was the whole idea of my messages: there is nowhere to go when you <br/>
compare different historical figures.<br/>
