	My thanks.  I'm always up for finding another author (that is, above and<br/>
beyond those of us on this list - a goodly number, it would appear, even<br/>
taking into account that at least one published author has declined to toss<br/>
his hat into this particular ring [hi, Tony!]).  As to Basho, I'm guessing<br/>
that the "he slept here" phenomenon is connected to the fact that he appears<br/>
to have been a popular travel writer.  _Narrow Road_ reads like kind of a<br/>
pre-photographic travelogue. (Granted that woodcuts were in vogue; still,<br/>
you can't have every view [for example] of Fujiyama on your walls.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup, that was him. I haven't read it, so I just know<br/>
he wrote it, and the only other thing I remember about<br/>
him is that he wrote the "frog/pond" haiku that is so<br/>
often quoted. That, and he seems to be the "George<br/>
Washington" of Japan, in the sense that there seems to<br/>
be a "Matsuo Basho slept here" sign in every corner of<br/>
the country.*snip*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My favorite Japanese author--modern work, not anything<br/>
to do with samurai or anything, though I think a<br/>
historical wourk by him would be absolutely hilarious.<br/>
Ranges from absurdist ("A Wild Sheep's Chase", "Dance<br/>
Dance Dance", "Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of<br/>
th World") to the poignant mid-life crisis tale with<br/>
just a touch of the absurd (The Wind-up Bird<br/>
Chronicle, Norwegian Wood, South of the Border, West<br/>
of the Sun, Sputnik Sweetheart...)<br/>
<br/>
"South of the Border, West of the Sun" rivals Miyabe<br/>
Miyuki's "All She was worth" for my favorite book of<br/>
all time.<br/>
