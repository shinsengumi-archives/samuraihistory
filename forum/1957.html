<h3>Musha</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209983283">Musha is another word for a warrior.  Another example of its use is <br/>
in the term Musha Shugyo.  Which I see most commonly translated <br/>
as "Warrior Pilgramage".  It is when a warrior travels all over the <br/>
place training with different teachers and/or challenging other <br/>
warriors to duels to improve their skills.  It was very common <br/>
(Compared to earlier times, although it did happen before)in the <br/>
Tokugawa period when samurai had little else to, and the ones that <br/>
took their training seriously saw the extended peace as an <br/>
enivronment in which to travel and perfect their skills.  Actually <br/>
there are some martial artists that still do this today, although <br/>
very rare (and trains with different teachers, but the challenge part <br/>
has died off for obvious reasons).</div>
