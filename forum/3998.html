<h3>Samurai etc..</h3>
by <i>robbroomuk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726700135">There is no honor in wanting to start a war. There's<br/>
plenty of honor shown by many of those who fight it.<br/>
Not every soldier is honorable, just like not every<br/>
samurai was honorable. But usually it's not the<br/>
soldiers who want to go fight the war. Anyone who<br/>
doesn't believe that, I'll take a poll of my friends<br/>
and colleagues, and get back to you--I'll ask how many<br/>
of them in Iraq and Afghanistan right now are enjoying<br/>
themselves, how many wanted to go and be separated<br/>
from their families, etc. I doubt I'll get many<br/>
positive responses. <br/>

I would totally agree with this, soldiers/service personnel rarely start a<br/>
war, but bear the brunt of the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
As Samurai spent a considerable part of their time doing things other than<br/>
actual war, I would suggest they, like all soliders through time, accepted<br/>
their duty with good grace and loyalty to their Lord/Commander, when asked<br/>
to serve in combat.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently reading Karl Fridays new/recent book, Samurai, Warfare and<br/>
the State in Early Medieval Japan, and there he discusses how Samurai were<br/>
more interested in progressing up the Court polictical ladder of power and<br/>
viewed service in war as a means to an end..<br/>
<br/>
Whilst I am only into the second chapter, based on what I have read so far,<br/>
I would recommend it and am looking forward to finishing it off, along side<br/>
the various other titles I have to read.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>
