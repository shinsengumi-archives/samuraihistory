<h3>Sharpness in soul or in the steel? was: Re: Hi</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102536643">Hi Josh and all <br/>
<br/>
Once I had a parlance about this issue with some Sensei of Iai-D�, and what <br/>
I could understand about it is that yes, of course, the craftsmanship level <br/>
of the crafter is important. <br/>
<br/>
But the most important thing is the soul of a samurai! <br/>
It is inside the soul that there must be the REAL and most important <br/>
sharpness! <br/>
<br/>
And I was able to saw even an practical demonstration of that. <br/>
<br/>
At unskilled hands, even a good blade of a true traditional Katana would <br/>
shatters blowing an slice at a bamboo, however an master of Iai-do is able <br/>
to slice an piece of iai-do in public with an very thin and fragile replica <br/>
of a katana blade made with wood!!! <br/>
<br/>
Remember also that Miyamoto Musashi was able to kill more than 200 people <br/>
alone with only his Bokuto-no-ken (a wood-made katana just like the initial <br/>
sword of Chrono at the old Sness RPG called Chrono Thrigger by Square <br/>
Software, the same of the nowaddays Final Fantasy X) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess much that nowaddays lads gets as "just symbolic" information on <br/>
the classical texts, may have an more literal meaning than much people even <br/>
suspect... <br/>
<br/>
Good Festivities to ya all <br/>
