<h3>Old manga comic book</h3>
by <i>raijin31</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-68919246">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I have an old manga comic book, that was gifted to me by my mother.  <br/>
I don't read japanese, and have no idea if this thing is 10 years old <br/>
or 100 years old.  It has the old style string binding, and the paper <br/>
is very thin, but remarkably strong for such thin paper.  It *feels* <br/>
old...<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone here who can read Japanese be willing to let me mail <br/>
them some color photocopies of some of the relevant pages of this <br/>
thing and see if they can date it?  I don't have access to a scanner, <br/>
or I would do it that way....<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about a digital camera, or many camera stores could probably <br/>
convert a copy into a digital image for you. You could post it to <br/>
the 'files' section of this group - and then i'm sure someone could <br/>
tell you what it is.</div>
