Tony's point. Specifically, the term "samurai" is not synonymous with <br/>
"swordsman" or "one who tries to adhere to Bushido" or anything similar. <br/>
Samurai were a caste, and one that no longer exists. So in the strict <br/>
definition of the term, one cannot "become" a samurai any more.<br/>

The term 'samurai' does not regard simply to those men (and some women) who trained with, and deployed their swords.  The word comes from the kanji meaning literally 'to serve', whether it was the Emperor, a daimyo, or even one of the equally mighty temples. <br/>
However, upon this point of 'to serve', would you classify the likes of the Miyamoto Musashi as a 'samurai' since his carrer with the sword was one essentially without a master?? <br/>

So theoretically the descendants of the samurai class could therefore still consider themselves to be samurai, although not with a legal foundation, with the laws enacted during the Meiji Restoration being formulated by the winners, if not nessarily/hypothetically those in the 'right' ??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173924770">I think that you can often hear Japanese people refering to others as <br/>
having a "Samurai bloodline" but they don't consider them Samurai.  <br/>
They are descendents of the Samurai and maybe even a famous Daimyo <br/>
but they are never considered Samurai themselves.  I've been told <br/>
that there is some influence in modern politics based on Samurai <br/>
bloodlines.  Most of these families still use the Mon that their <br/>
Samurai ancestors used.  But as Nate said, the class is extinct! Even <br/>
though we may still see some of its influence in modern Japan, a <br/>
Nihonjin(or any other person) cannot belong to a class that does not <br/>
exist.  So, let me sum up.  No, they cannot still consider themselves <br/>
Samurai.<br/>

This is going to seem as if I am against samurai, which I am not. I am<br/>
rather intrigued by them, in their day. Follow me on this for a moment<br/>
if you will...<br/>
<br/>
When Slavery was abolished in the United States, there were people who<br/>
still thought slavery was a good idea, and people who didn't. After<br/>
the abolishment of slavery, for the most part, former slave owners<br/>
rarely went about saying they were members of a class that proudly<br/>
owned other human beings and had the right to life or death over them.<br/>
The law didn't allow that any more, and for the most part, and the<br/>
general populace would not stand for that. The abolishment was drilled<br/>
into the public psyche, as was the concept that slave owners were not<br/>
needed in a changed society, and that all races and classes should be<br/>
free and theoretically equal. Owning slaves was made not-noble.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai had an equal right of life or death over those of lesser<br/>
class, held all of the benefits of the current society, and when<br/>
Samurai were abolished, the general psyche of the public thought they<br/>
were as un-needed as slave owners were in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
So I suppose one could say they were still slave owners if they were<br/>
the descendants of slave owners...but the public would not look kindly<br/>
on that, nor would I suspect the public would look kindly on Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
There were good samurai, and the parts of samurai life that were noble<br/>
should be celebrated but lets not forget it was a package deal. - just<br/>
like there were, I suppose, some good slave owners, but the society<br/>
evolved around them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just other thoughts...<br/>
Christopher <br/>
(who celebrates the good parts of samurai life, but is aware there are<br/>
bad ones...)<br/>

after the Meiji Restoration.<br/>
Today, 80% of the Japanese politicians still come out of that <br/>
University.<br/>
I believe that is the main correction, and -yes- you're probably right. <br/>
A few politicians today descend from the Samurai class, even thought <br/>
gradually more and more sons of merchants and commoners went to Todai <br/>
as well.<br/>
