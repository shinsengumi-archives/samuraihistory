Dracula Tape_ is a rather nicely researched satire that purports to be Vlad<br/>

Stoker and "that old sadist Van Helsing."  If you can find the novel, it<br/>
might give you some pleasure.<br/>

<br/>
For the record, many years ago I wrote a term paper on Vlad Tepes. As a former <br/>
Orthodox seminarian, I thought his was a rather interesting story of trying to <br/>
walk a tightrope between the Orthodox Church and the RC Church with the Turks in <br/>
the pit below waiting to gobble him up if he fell...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  And gobble up they did, until only the head was left, to be taken <br/>
to Constantinopole as a proof. Anyway, although his reign was bloody <br/>
(not really as bloody as the westerners think), we cherish his memory <br/>
because he was able to deal with the many corrupted nobles and common <br/>
thieves of the time (on a more lay approach, of course). Nice <br/>
metaphor, Mr. Bryant :) I think you already are aware of the fact <br/>
that Vlad Tepes remained orthodox and built some monasteries and <br/>
churches, and the exagerations of his cruelty were dued to the <br/>
benedictine and capucin monk orders, which refused to obey the <br/>
country rules and fled to german lands, where they spred legends of <br/>
horror. It seems that a monk named Jacob is the author of the <br/>
manuscript found in 1462 in the Saint Galin monastery in Switzerland, <br/>
which was the first of the many that formed the "Anti-Dracula" <br/>
campaign, with major impact on ther german world.<br/>
  Ok, I am really sorry I took up so much space with non-samurai <br/>
text, but I somehow felt the need to try to redeem the name of one of <br/>
our most loved historical figures, which has been terribly misjudged. <br/>
If the message is deleted, I would not take any offense, and also <br/>
from my part, the subject is closed.<br/>
  Thank you very much,<br/>
<br/>
  I will now return to learning of the ancient Japan and its <br/>
warriors...<br/>

  I thank you, Mr. Bryant, and in return, seeing as you are <br/>
interested in orthodoxism, I ask your permition to post a few sites <br/>
with photographs regarding our beliefs:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
1.<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nistea.com/media/photos/icoane_pe_sticla_din_colectia_fam">http://www.nistea.com/media/photos/icoane_pe_sticla_din_colectia_fam</a><br/>

(some "crucifixes" -I don't know the word in english, so I'll use <br/>
this one, in our language they are called "troite"- from the Apuseni <br/>
Mountains in the Carpatian Chain of Mountains)<br/>
<br/>
3.<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nistea.com/media/photos/manastirea_rimet/index.html">http://www.nistea.com/media/photos/manastirea_rimet/index.html</a> (one <br/>
of the oldest monasteries in Ardeal -a region of our country-, called <br/>
Rimet Monastery)<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe you would like to know more about the symbolism of the <br/>
Orthodox Crucifixes, as some of the symbols are ancient, predating <br/>
Christianity. I'd be happy to help, although I'm no a professional <br/>
historian, but an amateur who has studied some Religions History. By <br/>
the way, are you familiar with our Mircea Eliade?<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry for digressing, but I think the knowledge has to be shared <br/>
both ways, and since I am a beginner regarding Japan... :)<br/>

a reasonable period, digress all you want. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, this is a GENERAL REMINDER (don't<br/>
take it directed against you, please) that since the<br/>
poster's email is at the beginning of a message, if<br/>
you'd like to follow a digression further than a few<br/>
emails, you're more than free to do so off-list. These<br/>
couple of digressions (caravelles, Dracula, Orthodoxy)<br/>
have been within tolerance, for the most part--I<br/>
certainly can't complain, since I've been known to<br/>
digress about tanks, the US Cavalry, and Iijima Ai. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222793499">Howdy all hope your all Fine. Ok im a little curious about samurai funerals. erm what i would like to know is on how a Samurai ( or retainers) funeral day is likw, eg what type of wake is there? Whom is present? how the body is buried or cremated? Is it a sorrowful affair or joyful? and how does a normal funeral differ from someone that is forced to commit seppuku ( spelt wrong but very tired), thanks all i enjoy your comments (most times lol)<br/>

Hokkaido. It was very beautiful there. Especially during the spring. That's <br/>
very nice that you like my last name. I traced it back to a very long time <br/>
ago...I am related to a Japanese Samurai family. I'm still not sure which <br/>
one though. I just need to do more research on that. Anyways. Thank you very <br/>
much for your time.<br/>
