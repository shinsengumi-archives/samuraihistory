 </span></blockquote>Well, for starters, I gotta tell ya...<br/>
<br/>
If it's an *ancient* history class you shouldn't be doing anything on samurai,<br/>
who didn't really come into their own until the 11th century or so.<br/>

  Despite the time period of the class not coinciding with "Feudal Japan" I <br/>
can offer one good book on the daily life of the Samurai, as well as <br/>
everyone else in Japan at that time.  The book is called "Everyday Things in <br/>
Premodern Japan: The Hidden Legacy of Material Culture" and it is by Susan <br/>
B. Hanley  ISBN:  0520218124<br/>
<br/>
  As for the "training," a very brief overview (academically speaking) can <br/>
be found in the book "Secrets of the Samurai: A survey of the Martial Arts <br/>
of Feudal Japan" by Ratti and Westbrook  ISBN: 0785810730<br/>
<br/>
  I hope that this helped you in some way.  If I can assist you further <br/>
please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>
Matt<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878671500">Hi There<br/>
<br/>
Another good book readily available is ""Everyday Life in Traditional Japan": Charles J. Dunn (Tuttle Books)- my 1980 copy was $4.95. It has a large chapter coving daily lives of the Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

<br/>
No, but we can help point you in the direction you<br/>
need to go for your research. Start here:<br/>
<br/>
www.samurai-archives.com<br/>
<br/>
There's an extensive section on battles that you'll<br/>
want to look at, plus the links and the suggested<br/>
reading will provide you with more than enough<br/>
sources. <br/>
<br/>
If you want assistance with a particular question,<br/>
we'd be more than happy to do that. You have to be<br/>
more specific than "What were all the major samurai<br/>
battles?" <br/>
