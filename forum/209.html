<h3>minamoto yoshitsune</h3>
by <i>Yoshitsune Lion</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-672118893">i am doing research on Minamoto Yoshitsune but have been unable or <br/>
overlooked information detailing what number son he is. Eg - is he the <br/>
youngest son, Yoshitomo's fourth???<br/>
Also - i know that Yoritomo at the age of 13 fought with Yoshitomo in the <br/>
insurrection/disturbance - but did Yoshitomo have any elder sons who also <br/>
fought???<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou<br/>

<h3>minamoto yoshitsune</h3>
by <i>akodo99@hotmail.com</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810196827">in my research of yoshitsune and the minamoto as a whole - i have so <br/>
far not found any information detailing what number son was <br/>
Yoshitsune born. i know that noriyori is 3 years older - and yoritomo <br/>
12 - but is Yoshitsune the youngest? Was there any elder brothers <br/>
that died in the insurrection/disturbance?<br/>
<br/>
Also - in my readings i have found that it states that yoshitsune and <br/>
yoritomo are half brothers. Is this fact? If so - does this make <br/>
Noriyori Yoshitsunes half brother also?<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated! Thanx</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yoshitsune was the ninth son.<br/>
<br/>
Eldest was Yoshihira, then Tomonaga, then Yoritomo, Yoshidako, Mareyoshi,<br/>
Noriyori, Zenjou, Gien, and Yoshitsune. There were also two daughters.<br/>
<br/>
Yoshihira (1140-60). Executed after the Heiji insurrection.<br/>
Tomonaga (1144-1160). Killed by his father after the Heiji insurrection<br/>
rather than be left behind.<br/>
Yoritomo -- nuff said. <G><br/>
Yoshikado (?) Died young (early teens?) after appointment as lieutenant of<br/>
the Left Palace Guard.<br/>
Mareyoshi (?-1182) As yet a noncombatant, he was murdered in Tosa by Heike<br/>
loyalists.<br/>
Noriyori (1156-1193). Executed on Yoritomo's orders.<br/>
Zenjou  (ne Imamaru, 1160-after 1180) Took Buddhist orders, supported<br/>
Yoritomo during the Genpei War.<br/>
Gien (ne Yoshimaru, 1160-1187).<br/>
Yoshitsune -- nuff said.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the genealogical chart I have on hand doesn't say who was<br/>
mother to which. I'm not sure off the top of my head if Noriyoshi was<br/>
Yoshitsune's full brother or half, or Yoritomo's.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-263435153">I believe that Minamoto Yoshitsune was the youngest of the three named here, <br/>
although the Minamoto clan was not only confined to the Seiwa branch of the <br/>
clan that produced the three here...Yoshitsune would have been a half brother <br/>
to Yoritomo because of the system of marriage in Heian Japan, that would have <br/>
meant that Yoshitsune was born to a consort of Minamoto Yoshitomo. However <br/>
there were, I believe, four sons born to Yoshitomo and one Daughter, Gien. <br/>
The sons names were Yoshihira, Yoritomo, Noriyori, and Yoshitsune (Who was <br/>
the youngest). Yoshihira lived between 1141-1160 (Full name; Kamakura no <br/>
Akugenda.) He was captured and killed after the Heiji disturbance of 1159. <br/>
Sorry not to help out more but there are plenty of books to look at in <br/>
research, the best being Heike Monogatari (The tale of the <br/>
Heike-H.C.McCullough, Stanford uni. press.). good luck on the project!!<br/>

<br/>
I have consulted E. Papinot's "Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan"<br/>
on your question (it is all I have!!) and found the following:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Ise no Saburo<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No reference.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > the Sato brothers<br/>
 </span></blockquote>page 547:  "Sato: Daimyo family, descended from Fujiwara Hidesato, possesing the<br/>
fief of Shinobu (Mutsu) since the 11th century.  Besides Saigyo-Hoshi, the best<br/>
known members of the family are the two brothers Tsuginobu (1158-1185) and<br/>
Tadanobu (1160-1185), sons of Motoharu.  They both belonged to the 4 bodyguards<br/>
(shi-tenno) of Miyamoto Yoshitsune, and died in his cause."<br/>
