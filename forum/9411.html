<div id="ygrps-yiv-503031234">hello everyone. I was wondering if you guys could help me find a <br/>
certain samurai? I remember reading aout him but cannot remember his <br/>
name. From what I remember he was 13 when he first became a samurai <br/>
and he had a form of yoshi in his name somewhere. If you could ell me <br/>
his name or even give me some information on him I would appreciate it <br/>
very much! Also I would like some really good information on the <br/>
Minomoto familly evolving around Yoshitsune Minomoto,as well as <br/>
something about Taira no Shigemori and temoe Gozen. Thank you!</div>

 </span></blockquote>The first question, well, without more info, you've just described<br/>
probably between 5-15% of every samurai ever born. For the rest, take<br/>
