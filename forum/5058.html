<h3>Snowfire Premise</h3>
by <i>scorpialuna</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042714660">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me post this. I appreciate all the wonderful help <br/>
and support I'm receiving from this list! And for the listmember who <br/>
asked about copyright: if I can prove I am the owner of this email <br/>
address, posting a short chapter here actually proves my copyright, <br/>
so no worries about that. Good question, though!<br/>
<br/>
Below please find a short chapter that details the premise of the <br/>
book, tentatively titled "Snowfire." If there is anything that seems <br/>
illogical in it, or you would like to correct for historical accuracy <br/>
(even though this _is_ a fantasy) please don't hesitate! I'm only <br/>
10,000 words into the book and want to catch any illogicalities (is <br/>
that even a word?) while the work is relatively young. So, without <br/>
futher ado...<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
My father had once been a retainer to the Emperor. The o'Diserah were <br/>
an old and noble clan, known for their faithfulness to the Peerless. <br/>
Endless feudal wars had reduced the o'Diserah to a single family, and <br/>
of that family my father was the last to survive. Such is life.<br/>
<br/>
My father took service under the Emperor and was given the position <br/>
of Kanhake- one of the Emperor's bodyguard. It was honorable, and my <br/>
father was a skilled swordsman.  He protected the Emperor as he would <br/>
have protected any lord- fearlessly, with honor.<br/>
<br/>
Then my father fell in love.<br/>
<br/>
The Emperor's youngest sister and favored concubine, Azami, returned <br/>
his affection, though neither dared to make their feelings known. <br/>
Still, it is hard to hide anything at the Winter Palace; and my <br/>
father had enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Chief among those enemies was o'Shotomori Shanjushi Ieyasu, not yet <br/>
Jogun. He was an adept at intrigue and suspicion, and had risen far <br/>
to the position of Master of the Imperial Police. And he too burned <br/>
with a double passion- to serve his own ambition, and to have Azami.<br/>
When she rejected him- whether out of loyalty to the Emperor or love <br/>
of my father- he retaliated.<br/>
<br/>
o'Inanke Kohenaki Azami was found guilty of intriguing against the <br/>
Emperor. False letters were produced, witnesses as well- though the <br/>
witnesses were all Ieyasu's creatures. The Emperor had no choice but <br/>
to pronounce her anathema- since her blood was his, he could not <br/>
order her suicide. Azami left the Winter Palace and vanished into <br/>
Edon. By the time the Emperor suspected he had been misled, she was <br/>
gone and Ieyasu was Jogun- the War Lord, and too powerful to be <br/>
dismissed. For the Jogun had become emperor in all but name, and the <br/>
Emperor an empty puppet.<br/>
<br/>
My father, then, made his choice.<br/>
<br/>
He resigned, left his post as Kanhake and left Odokyo the great city. <br/>
He searched Edon for Azami, and when he found her- driven mad, <br/>
trapped in a bordello, no longer able to return to her former station <br/>
even if she had been able to understand- he retreated to this <br/>
mountain village, far away from Edokyo.<br/>
<br/>
I learned something that was not common knowledge that night: that <br/>
the Emperor had sent my father to find Azami. Find her he did, but he <br/>
did not return her to the Winter Palace. For she was broken in health <br/>
and in madness, a child-woman forced to live in the streets and <br/>
gutters, unprepared for the harshness of life.<br/>
<br/>
"Azami had little steel in her," my father said, staring into the <br/>
fire. "It was why the Emperor loved her, I think. She was sanjin, of <br/>
course, and honorable... but she was a summer flower."<br/>
<br/>
I nodded, pouring my father another cup of saki. I don't think he <br/>
would have told me some of the things he did that night had he not <br/>
been drinking steadily since the tale started.<br/>
<br/>
My father stayed with her, barring her from taking further customers <br/>
and earning his living-and hers- by the swordmaker's trade, for which <br/>
he had been trained when young. The o'Diserah believed that to wield <br/>
a blade, you must know how it is made, despite the dishonor of <br/>
selling your skill like a merchant.<br/>
<br/>
And eventually, Azami and my father produced me.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know if my father cursed himself for breaking his honor with <br/>
the Emperor's sister. In his defense I will say that it was his only <br/>
lapse in a long and honorable life, and that had I been born a boy, <br/>
my father's dishonor would have even somewhat erased. The fault is <br/>
mine.<br/>
<br/>
It was in the last year of Azami's life, as she grew round with <br/>
pregnancy, that my father learned the Emperor had been slain by <br/>
treachery. A new Emperor- a concubine's son- was enthroned in the <br/>
Winter Palace. And this new Emperor was the creature of- who else?- <br/>
the Jogun.<br/>
<br/>
o'Shotomori Shanjushi Ieyasu, whose star had climbed so high.<br/>
<br/>
I understood far more than another child perhaps would have, having <br/>
grown adept at reading my father's silences as well as his words. My <br/>
father's enemy was my mother's enemy, and my father's enemy was also <br/>
mine.<br/>
<br/>
"We are all that is left," my father said. "Last of the o'Diserah, <br/>
and last of the Emperor's retainers. What is our duty, o'Kohe-chan?"<br/>
<br/>
I shifted slightly in seiza, easing an ache in my right <br/>
leg. "Revenge," I answered.<br/>
<br/>
"Hai." My father examined the empty saki bottle. "If your mother's <br/>
name were to be known," he said, "you would be in grave danger. The <br/>
Jogun's spies know that I have a bastard child, but they have been <br/>
duped into thinking that her mother was a common low-born prostitute, <br/>
that I left the Winter Palace in disgrace for my complicity in <br/>
Azami's supposed treachery. The Emperor was careful to let them think <br/>
so. When he was murdered, my duty became clear. So I have raised you."<br/>
<br/>
"Dai-pa," I leaned forward a little, "is that why I'm dressed like a <br/>
boy?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hai."<br/>
<br/>
"And why I learn the sword?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hai."<br/>
<br/>
"Do I look like my mother?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hai."<br/>
<br/>
"What am I to do now, Dai-pa?"<br/>
<br/>
"Wait. Watch. Learn."<br/>
<br/>
I set my tea bowl aside and put my hands on the floor, bent forward <br/>
until my forehead touched the mats. "Hai, Dai-pa."<br/>
<br/>
He grunted. "Go to bed, o'Kohe-chan. Tomorrow we will start."<br/>
<br/>
"Hai, Dai-pa."<br/>
<br/>
I bowed again, then rose and backed away from him, three steps. Then <br/>
I turned and ran from the room.<br/>
<br/>
I ran up the stairs and threw myself down on my bed. My eyes were <br/>
terribly dry. I lay across my bedding and sobbed without a sound. It <br/>
is a horrible thing, to learn that you have failed through no fault <br/>
of your own.<br/>
<br/>
I should have been born a boy. A boy could learn the sword without <br/>
trouble and carry out revenge with little but the law and the Jogun's <br/>
retainers to dissuade him.<br/>
<br/>
I, however, had been born female. And in doing so, I had failed both <br/>
my parents terribly.<br/>
<br/>
I lay in the dark, eyes burning, body shuddering with silent sobs, <br/>
and heard the tinkling crash downstairs as my father threw the saki-<br/>
bottle against the hearth.</div>

Ummmm...<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Here's the deal. I'm a past member of SFWA. I used to be a magazine <br/>
editor. Specifically, one of the magazines was Dragon Magazine. I got to read a <br/>
lot of fiction. I got to read some really good stuff, and got to read some <br/>
really bad stuff. There was very little that was in between. Some of the really <br/>
bad stuff we all (the magazine editors) tended to save up and present bits and <br/>
pieces -- anonymously, and in good humor -- at panels called "It Came from Over <br/>
the Transom" at WorldCon and other conventions.<br/>
<br/>
I have to tell you, upon looking at this... what's the idea? Is it Japanese or <br/>
not? If it is, use Japanese names. If it's not, DON'T use Japanese names. <br/>
Especially really FAMOUS ones. It's that simple.<br/>
<br/>
Don't use cutesy "kinda" Japanese words ("jogun"? come on! -- and it's spelled <br/>
"sake" not "saki" -- but if this isn't Japan, WHY is there "saki"?) instead of <br/>
the real one. As one of my mentors once said when I tried something like that, <br/>
either "do it," or get off the pot.<br/>
<br/>
The pseudo Japanese will alienate the Japanophile, and only confuse those who <br/>
don't care one way or another about Japan as they'll think they're missing <br/>
something. If you want to see how to pseudo-fantasize Japan, look up a book <br/>
called "Ladylord" by a good friend of mine, Sasha Miller. The names aren't <br/>
Japanese. The words and titles are English. But the fantasy world in which the <br/>
tale takes place is a very sinified Japan (if you know Japan) and just a cool <br/>
fantasy world if you don't.<br/>
<br/>
One of the great rules in fiction is "show, don't tell." This is far too <br/>
expository. By the third paragraph I was already skipping and scanning.<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty (and since you asked for feedback), here it is:<br/>
<br/>
As -- I think -- the only one in this group who actually dealt professionally <br/>
with fantasy fiction on the purchasing and publishing end, I have to say that my <br/>
reading would not make it to the second page, and it would be returned the next <br/>
morning with a form rejection letter.<br/>
<br/>
Before you think that's not nice, consider this: I've actually given you more <br/>
solid feedback on what's wrong and needs fixing in this e-mail than just about <br/>
any professional editor who sees the ms will.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but that's the way it is, in the eyes of this grizzled old veteran of <br/>
editorial panels at SF cons.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tony got to you first--however, I'll say a lot of the<br/>
same things, I'm sure. But let me start by saying that<br/>
if you listen to ANYONE, please listen to him! I've<br/>
got no official research background or writing<br/>
history--he's got both, been published several times<br/>
in history, at least, and will tell you like it is.<br/>
Anyways, on with my comments...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > My father had once been a retainer to the Emperor.<br/>

> Such is life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Names. Ouch. What's with the "o'everything"? Are we<br/>
Japanese or Irish? This needs serious work. Not to be<br/>
harsh, but speaking, as Tony put it, from the<br/>
"Japanophile" side of the house, I would pick up this<br/>
book, turn to the back cover, see that it's about<br/>
someone in the "o'Diserah" family, and immediately put<br/>
it down, lamenting the fact that no one writes good<br/>
fiction about Japanese history. <br/>
<br/>
And strictly speaking, the Emperor himself didn't have<br/>
direct retainers. Everyone was technically a servant<br/>
of the Emperor, but he wasn't a feudal magnate, and<br/>
didn't maintain his own warrior house. Think of him<br/>
more like the Pope than a European king (and ignore<br/>
the whole Pope maintaining standing armies in the<br/>
1400's or so thing). <br/>
<br/>
Kusunoki Masashige is one of the few examples I can<br/>
think of of someone truly dedicated solely to the<br/>
Emperor, and that was to GoDaigo, who TRIED to regain<br/>
rule from the Bakufu, in essence trying to act like a<br/>
king, rather than what the Emperor by this point<br/>
normally did. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > My father took service under the Emperor and was<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this supposed to be something like the Praetorian<br/>
Guard? Because that's what I'm picturing. There were<br/>
several Imperial guard forces, but service in them<br/>
wasn't REALLY how we imagine a bodyguard, following<br/>
around the Emperor like the Secret Service or P.<br/>
Diddy's posse. They were more like police or palace<br/>
guards, not personal ones. I can dig up descriptions<br/>
of them, if you like--Sansom's volume 1 history gives<br/>
a basic outline, but Karl Friday is a better<br/>
explanation. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > The Emperor's youngest sister and favored concubine,<br/>
> Azami, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She's his sister, AND his concubine? Um....yech. While<br/>
there doesn't seem to have been any issues marrying<br/>
cousins (since for a long time the Emperors married<br/>
women of the Fujiwara family, making their sons<br/>
half-Fujiwara, who then married back into the Fujiwara<br/>
family...you get the idea...), this wouldn't have<br/>
worked. <br/>
<br/>
However an affair of the Emperor's wife/consort/etc<br/>
with another courtier isn't out of the realm of<br/>
possibility--look at the Genji Monogatari for an<br/>
example. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Chief among those enemies was o'Shotomori Shanjushi<br/>
> Ieyasu, not yet <br/>
> Jogun. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, names. Ouch. Especially famous ones. I'll give<br/>
you a website to peruse at the end that will help you<br/>
with developing real-sounding Japanese names, and of<br/>
course you can run them by us all  to make sure they<br/>
weren't real people, or at least really famous ones.<br/>
Ieyasu is a bad choice....also, I agree with<br/>
Tony--what the hell is Jogun? Either use Shogun, or<br/>
use another title--by using Jogun, you just look like<br/>
you can't spell correctly. <br/>
<br/>
He was an adept at intrigue and suspicion,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > and had risen far <br/>
> to the position of Master of the Imperial Police.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your book, your fantasy. But my understanding (someone<br/>
can correct me if I'm wrong) is that head of the<br/>
Imperial Police was a decent, but not fabulous, title<br/>
during the Heian period. During the later Sengoku,<br/>
which if I remember is your target timeframe, this<br/>
really wouldn't have meant a hill of beans. But, as<br/>
you said, you're creating this world. I would read<br/>
this and go "hmm, that's not right", but then move on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
since her blood was his,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > he could not <br/>
> order her suicide. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never really stopped anyone in reality, but okay. <br/>
<br/>
 For the (SH)ogun had become emperor in all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > but name, and the <br/>
> Emperor an empty puppet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Proudly puppeteering since 1185!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > He searched Edon for Azami, and when he found her-<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even a banished court lady wouldn't have been driven<br/>
to prostitution. Banishment meant being away from the<br/>
political and social center, Kyoto, not destitution<br/>
and complete misery. Again, your story.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > She was sanjin<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh? You explain the title of (SH)ogun, which everyone<br/>
just about will understand, but no explanation here of<br/>
what this means. Just something to follow up on later.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I nodded, pouring my father another cup of saki. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It's "sake". Saki is a literary pseudonym. <br/>
<br/>
 The o'Diserah<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > believed that to wield <br/>
> a blade, you must know how it is made, despite the<br/>
> dishonor of <br/>
> selling your skill like a merchant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone may correct me, but your sword maker's were<br/>
held in much higher regard than your average rice<br/>
broker. <br/>
<br/>
 A new Emperor- a concubine's son- was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > enthroned in the <br/>
> Winter Palace. And this new Emperor was the creature<br/>
> of- who else?- <br/>
> the Jogun.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds very Fujiwara...interesting. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > "Dai-pa," I leaned forward a little, "is that why<br/>
> I'm dressed like a <br/>
> boy?"<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>"Daipa" is how the Japanese refer to Pampers, not how<br/>
you'd address your father. <br/>
<br/>
The message got cut off--I'll go back and see if there<br/>
is anything else I had to add, but here's the website<br/>
I promised:<br/>
<br/>
www.sengokudaimyo.com<br/>
<br/>
Go to it. Now. This instant! Ordinarily I recommend a<br/>
part or a piece of it, but this will seriously help<br/>
you understand the world that your writing about.<br/>
There's a page on names and titles in the Miscellany<br/>
portion. There's pages on etiquette, manners, dress,<br/>
armor, games, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the author? He's that other guy that critiqued<br/>
your passage. <br/>

<br/>
In the first place, this is the seventh chapter of a book in the <br/>

little bit of telling is in order. I just wanted a critique of the <br/>
_chain of events_.<br/>
<br/>
As for names, if I'm not writing a book set in historical Japan, I <br/>
think the fantasy names are probably a better idea. Hear me out: <br/>
look, if this was a remake of Shogun I would certainly try to use <br/>
Japanese names. It isn't. It's a fantasy world very much like a <br/>
certain period in Japanese history, and I think trying to use real <br/>
Japanese names would actually cloud the issue.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if I write a fantasy novel that uses the term "Shogun" I <br/>
am reprimanded for having fantasy aspects in what should be a work of <br/>
historical fiction. If I write with the term "Jogun" (which I thought <br/>
was a fair fantasy bastardization, if one exists) I'm slammed for it <br/>
being a knockoff. Help me win, guys. Help me find the right thing to <br/>
do here.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is the seventh chapter, in rough draft, taken out of <br/>
context, and a fantasy novel. I appreciate the critiques, and <br/>
apologize for not being clearer in defining my terms. It's great that <br/>
you guys are tkaing the time to set me straight on such important <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, fair enough. But you did come to a history<br/>
thread saying you wanted to make things "accurate".<br/>
We're GOING to base our comments off of history, and<br/>
what was real. If you don't want to do things a<br/>
certain way, don't--it's your fantasy world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > As for names, if I'm not writing a book set in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here's my take: either use Japanese names, or don't<br/>
use them. Don't make "half" names. If you want to use<br/>
a slightly Japanesey setting for your fantasy novel,<br/>
but don't want it to "BE" Japanese, that's cool--no<br/>
issues. But then don't have one character be an<br/>
Ieyasu. That's not a fantasy name, that's a historical<br/>
Japanese name, one what anybody who knows anything<br/>
about Japanese history will recognize. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think you should go with Japanese<br/>
names--just make them non-historical figures. People<br/>
understand, or should understand, that it's<br/>
FICTION--by giving them actual Japanese names, that<br/>
doesn't mean they have to be real people, or even<br/>
based on real people. There's nothing wrong with<br/>
having a Shonai Masayori (a perfectly possible, yet<br/>
made up name) as a main character. If you use Ieyasu,<br/>
however, people are going to associate that with the<br/>
REAL Ieyasu, and look for parallels/connections to<br/>
reality, which is apparently not what you want. <br/>
<br/>
Go one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > For example, if I write a fantasy novel that uses<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Using the term "Shogun" doesn't mean you need to make<br/>
events match history. But like I said with the names,<br/>
if you don't want to be held to any history standards,<br/>
use something completely different. Jogun isn't a good<br/>
one--it's fairly obvious it should be Shogun. My<br/>
opinion, but the right thing to do is either use<br/>
Shogun (and I'm about as much of an accuracy Nazi as<br/>
you can get, but wouldn't have an issue with the use<br/>
of the term in an obviously fantasy/parallel world) or<br/>
make up something completely unrelated for use in your<br/>
world. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And again, write for your audience. Your audience may<br/>
not care if you spell "sake" as "saki". But understand<br/>
your audience here, as well. That's the kind of thing<br/>
that might make me put a book down at the bookstore<br/>
rather than take it to the register. Does it matter in<br/>
the grand context of your story? Probably not. But you<br/>
said you wanted help with accuracy, and, well, that's<br/>
what we're trying to give you. It's up to you then to<br/>
take it and go "no, my fantasy world doesn't need<br/>
that", or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I don't read fantasy fiction, and as such, I'm<br/>
probably not your audience. But again, it's so easy to<br/>
get some little details right that make all the<br/>
difference in wether someone like me would read it or<br/>
not. The storyline itself seems fine--parents<br/>
dishonored, kid raised to take revenge, etc. It's the<br/>
details that are going to make me throw it away or<br/>
stay up all night to get to the end. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853454922">Hi Lilith - <br/>
<br/>
I've been away and so out of this debate, but before anything <br/>
should point out I'm writing my own samurai fiction, which you <br/>
can read at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/jzm.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/jzm.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Re persons:<br/>
In an early incarnation, I decided to create a fictitious clan <br/>
and insert it into history. The name was 'Kabima', a concoction <br/>
from the names of my daughters, but on checking it out with a <br/>
native speaker, the word means something like 'mouldy cloth' or <br/>
'mouldy clothes' - not a good idea - if you're going to have <br/>
cod Japanese names, better make sure you know what they <br/>
mean.<br/>
<br/>
(As it stands now, the Toda existed, and a daughter did marry <br/>
the father of Tokugawa Ieyasu, but there's a couple of extra <br/>
family members of my invention). <br/>
<br/>
Re places:<br/>
I can't vouch for this, but I once had a discussion with an <br/>
avid fantasy reader who was amazed when I told him the plot of <br/>
a novel without having read it, because from the snippet he <br/>
told me I could see it followed the events of the Gempei War <br/>
(1180-1185). The author had lifted the whole thing, changed the <br/>
names and location, and wrote a fantasy bestseller which <br/>
no-one would identify with Japan.<br/>
<br/>
(As mine stands, I have to make guesses, although my study <br/>
wall is plastered with maps, pictures, etc. and my wife has <br/>
okay'd a solo holiday in Japan for me!)<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
I think if you're going to base a fantasy on Japan, then you <br/>
have to identify what it is that you like, and transpose it to <br/>
your own world - and identify it with your world, not back to <br/>
Japan - this is my opinion only, personally I put down 'Across <br/>
the Nightingale Floor' for that very reason - it's neither one <br/>
thing nor the other.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise 'The Last Samurai' - it's a vehicle for Tom Cruise, <br/>
and that's all it is. What realy jars is when they change not <br/>
only the culture but the ethos to suit. 'Zatoichi' is a lot <br/>
more fun, just as much a fiction, but offers no offence to <br/>
Japan (which TLS does before the opening credits have even <br/>
finished).<br/>
<br/>
My own work stemmed from what I understood of the the <br/>
samurai and his arts, through my martial art practice and <br/>
reading history - japanes ein translation - and the realisation that <br/>
most European fiction on the subject was grossly inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could write like James Clavell, but from a purist <br/>
perspective Shogun is a crap book serving up the same old <br/>
nonsense stereotypes that perpetuates a load of bull about <br/>
Sengoku Japan which people mistakenly assume to be <br/>
'historically accurate'.<br/>
<br/>
I neither read nor write Japanese, so am massively limited if <br/>
not totally hamstrung, but I follow the Bernard Cornwell rule - <br/>
I write what I'd like to read, and what I like to read is based <br/>
on history and reality, not fantasy, so I do as much research <br/>
as I can.<br/>
<br/>
All that aside, good luck with the project,<br/>
<br/>

Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me post this. I appreciate all the wonderful help <br/>
and support I'm receiving from this list! And for the listmember who <br/>
asked about copyright: if I can prove I am the owner of this email <br/>
address, posting a short chapter here actually proves my copyright, <br/>
so no worries about that. Good question, though!<br/>
<br/>
Below please find a short chapter that details the premise of the <br/>
book, tentatively titled "Snowfire." If there is anything that seems <br/>
illogical in it, or you would like to correct for historical accuracy <br/>
(even though this _is_ a fantasy) please don't hesitate! I'm only <br/>
10,000 words into the book and want to catch any illogicalities (is <br/>
that even a word?) while the work is relatively young. So, without <br/>
futher ado...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I believe they already have.<br/>
<br/>
   As a publisher, I concur with Tony and Nate's comments. I trust my <br/>
editors, as a rule, and if they were my editors then their opinions would <br/>
shape whether or not my company accepted a manuscript for publication.<br/>
<br/>
   FWIW, I have written or co-authored 12 published books and I have <br/>
contributed (as an editor, graphic designer and/or developer) to 48 <br/>
additional published works. I do have some experience in this realm as well.<br/>
<br/>
   One of the hardest things about being an artist (including authors) is <br/>
rejection. The only thing that I find harder to deal with (other than <br/>
crappy sales <G>) is critique. When I create something I put a lot of pride <br/>
in it, and I love my "baby." So when people come along and tear it to <br/>
shreds it's easy to take personally. But as one must make an effort to step <br/>
back and remove the emotional filters, and re-evaluate the criticism.<br/>
<br/>
   Editors' words can feel scathing, but ultimately they are uttered with <br/>
the intent of providing an unbiased evaluation -- and from an objective <br/>
observer at that! Such critiques are priceless.<br/>
<br/>
   Someone once told me that if I'm writing for me, then it doesn't matter <br/>
how it reads, if it's accurate, etc. As long as I like it that's all that <br/>
counts. But if I'm writing for someone else -- especially someone whom I <br/>
expect to PAY for the privilege -- then the standards go up dramatically <br/>
and I better be prepared to make a lot of changes if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
   One question that comes to mind (putting on my publisher hat for a <br/>
moment) is: Who is your target audience? That is, who do you hope will buy <br/>
your book?<br/>
