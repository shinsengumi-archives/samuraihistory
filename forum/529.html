 </span></blockquote>Nobunaga did had several sons. Since he was assassinated <br/>
unexpectedly, an heir to the Oda family had yet to be chosen. After <br/>
Hideyoshi (then a general of the Oda) rushed to avenge Nobunaga's <br/>
death, there was a big dispute about who would succeed him. <br/>
Nobunaga's eldest son Nobutada was killed during the attempt on his <br/>
father's life, so he was out of the question. The second and third <br/>
sons (Nobukatsu and Nobutaka) were left to quarrel over who was <br/>
worthy of succeeding Nobunaga. Hideyoshi's solution to this was to <br/>
suggest that Nobutada's son Samboshi should succeed him, since <br/>
Samboshi was the eldest son of Nobunaga's eldest son, and thus had <br/>
the most direct lineage. (Hmm, did that sentence make sense? I hope <br/>
so.) The problem was that Samboshi was still an infant, so he would <br/>
need regents to rule in his place until he grew old enough to take <br/>
over. Hideyoshi's opinion eventually won out, and Hideyoshi himself <br/>
ended up as one of the regents ruling in Samboshi's place. Hideyoshi <br/>
took up the reins where Nobunaga left off, and through that position <br/>
of power ended up playing a big role in the unification of Japan. So <br/>
I guess that once Hideyoshi rose to power in his own right, the issue <br/>
of who became head of the Oda family kind of just faded into the <br/>
background. <br/>
<br/>
That's all I know, and I doubt it's helpful, but I'm sure the smarter <br/>
people here can clarify things (and tell me where I'm wrong! -_^)<br/>
