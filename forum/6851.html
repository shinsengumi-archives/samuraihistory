<h3>Hi All</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907073775">My nickname is Nahless, 28 yrs. old, and I'm from the Netherlands. <br/>
I'm very interested in Japanese (samurai) history and culture; <br/>
specifically the Sengoku era. I'm hoping to find some people here <br/>
who share my interests (looks like the right place!) since i've <br/>
driven my girlfriend nuts with my 'samurai talk'. To start off with <br/>
a question: I've read Mitsuo Kure's 'Samurai' (Tuttle books) and he <br/>
writes on page 174 (near the top of the page) that Takeda Shingen's <br/>
adult name (zokumyô) was Nobuharu. I was under the impression that <br/>
his zokumyô was harunobu (as it is stated on samurai-archives).<br/>
Strange error of Mitsuo Kure or am I wrong?<br/>
