<h3>Significants of sageo knots.</h3>
by <i>zeninmansfield</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120974551">Do the knots tied in the sageo on a traditional katana sword sheath <br/>
have any special meaning? I have seen some that are very intricate. <br/>
Also in some Japanese prints I see mounted samurai wearing a large <br/>
ring over their sword. What is it for?<br/>

What you're seeing is likely the reel samurai used for their spare <br/>
bowstrings.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Not as far as I know, but they may have acquired meanings during or post<br/>
the Edo era, as so many things have done. But I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Also in some Japanese prints I see mounted samurai wearing a large <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This device is the "tsurumaki" or "bow-string wrap". It's used for<br/>
carrying a spare string for the bow. It is made with a deep channel<br/>
(circa 30mm deep) around the outer edge, so the string can be wrapped<br/>
within the trench and be protected by it. This is done because the tsuru<br/>
is coated in resin which means that you can't just stuff it away in a<br/>
pouch/pocket without it being possibly damaged. The resin which is to<br/>
some degree still fluid, flows away from creases, and you have to wipe<br/>
the crease smooth again before using it. And you really don't want to be<br/>
doing this in the middle of a battle! Tsurumaki can be made of rattan<br/>
(split vine), wood, or lacquered paper. They are normally suspended by a<br/>
strip of printed leather or other textile, from the obi (when worn with<br/>
a katana), or from the sword's waist cord (forgotten the name) in the<br/>
case of a tachi. Go here to see a couple of modern made rattan tsurumaki<br/>
as used in kyudo for a close up view:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321737715">Thank you Dean for explaining that to me. I would have never guessed <br/>
it was a spare bow string.<br/>
But no one has come forward to explain what the significants of the <br/>
sageo knots are yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487199434">Hi Michael<br/>
I believe that the more intricate knots to which you refer are mainly used<br/>
when the sword is "at rest" on the katana-kake and is mainly decorative.<br/>
However, it is designed to come undone with a single pull if the sword was<br/>
needed in an emergency. This is known as cho-musubi (butterfly knot).<br/>
Daimyo-musubi is a simpler knot where a knot is tied close to the kurikata<br/>
and another is wrapped and knoted near the end of the saya. They are not<br/>
always easy to tie and new, stiff sageo make better and easier knots.<br/>
