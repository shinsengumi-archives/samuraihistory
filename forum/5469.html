<h3>Oda Nobunaga and the Ikkou Ikki</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656970550">After doing some reading on the Ikkou Ikki vs. Oda Nobunaga, I have <br/>
to wonder if anyone else would have been able to defeat them had <br/>
Nobunaga been killed at Okehazama, etc.  The Ishiyama Honganji, <br/>
Enryakuji, etc.  would have either required anyone who wanted to take <br/>
control of Japan to let them keep thier power, or would have gone to <br/>
war with them.  It took Nobunaga 10 years of fighting, had Imagawa <br/>
Yoshimoto plowed over Nobunaga and went to Kyoto, would he have had a <br/>
chance against them? Most likely, he would have had to give up some <br/>
control or authority to please them, I dont see him being able to <br/>
defeat them the way Nobunaga did, and I dont see them idly sitting by <br/>
as Yoshimoto cuts into thier power and profits.  Maybe Japan would <br/>
have ended up as a semi-theocracy?<br/>

Any thoughts?</div>

 </span></blockquote>This, I'll agree with. <br/>
<br/>
 It took Nobunaga 10 years of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that's assuming Yoshimoto would have made it<br/>
past the Saito, Rokkaku, Asai, Miyoshi, et al. But<br/>
saying he did, who knows? Let's remember that Nobunaga<br/>
wasn't just occupied with war for that 10 years--he<br/>
was defeating people, yes, but then he was taking<br/>
their lands, getting stronger, etc...conceivably, if<br/>
Yoshimoto had taken Kyoto and environs and all points<br/>
in between, then HE would be the one getting stronger.<br/>
And eventually, conceivably, he would be the one with<br/>
the better generals, the bigger battalions, and would<br/>
be able to subdue the Honganji, et al. <br/>
<br/>
Of course we all know that Yoshimoto was no Nobunaga,<br/>
so it's not bloody likely. I think with no Nobunaga,<br/>
it would have been much easier for a certain Tiger of<br/>
Kai to attack Yoshimoto from the rear and march into<br/>
Kyoto himself. And I think it's safe to assume that<br/>
the Takeda clan was no less talented general-wise than<br/>
the Oda, nor less spectacular in martial prowess. Who<br/>
knows?<br/>
<br/>
I think you're point is not necessarily about<br/>
Yoshimoto, it's more that anyone stepping into the<br/>
breach would be hard pressed to subdue the monastic<br/>
armies, and would be forced to compromise at some<br/>
point--right? I'd agree that most likely WOULD<br/>
compromise--if the burning of Mt. Hiei was as shocking<br/>
as the chroniclers would have us believe, then it's<br/>
not likely someone else would have come up with that<br/>
extreme methodology. And being as the only other way<br/>
was to work with the various militant monastics, I'd<br/>
agree that would be likely. The religious groups had<br/>
secular power since before the Heian jidai--why stop<br/>
then? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Maybe Japan would <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, now you're just being silly. Not even Yoshimoto<br/>
would have bowed to that one. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly, I was just thinking in general, not Yoshimoto specifically, <br/>
but he was the easiest 2nd choice after Nobunaga.  And keep in mind <br/>
that the Honganji, the Enryakuji, ikko ikki, etc were all over the <br/>
country - Omi, Ise, Aki, all over.  They could cause major problems <br/>
for anyone who wants to take control.  They were allowed to grow and <br/>
thrive because no one was really in control.<br/>
<br/>
As for Mt. Hiei, having been there myself, I can't stress how much <br/>
sheer *audacity* he must have had to even THINK of attacking Mt. <br/>
Hiei.  This is no hill, it is nearly a full mountain range.  It is <br/>
HUGE. He must have been suffering from delusions of gradeur to think <br/>
that he could walk an army up the MOUNTAIN and burn it down, I can <br/>
almost guarantee that no one else would have taken that route.  The <br/>
place is really huge, with cliffs and sharp drops all around, and way <br/>
way up there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>C'mon, there are plenty of theoretical cases where this could happen. <br/>
Someone gets to Kyoto with the assistance of the Honganji, for <br/>
example and in return for the title of Shogun, the Shogun is "given" <br/>
monastic advisors and keeps funds flowing to the monasteries around <br/>
the country.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366214608">Indeed it would be almost impossible to imagine a theocracy in terms on a post-Revolutionary Iran per se, but the "theocratic" element plays a strong role throughout Japanese history. As has been mentioned, the Emperor was ("is" if you were to read some nationalist writers or some of nationalist elements you bump into around Hiroshima) an incarnate descendant of the kami. During the Heian/Kamakura/Muromachi jidai, the Kenmon temples (see Kuroda Toshio or Adolphson "Gates of Power") played a huge role in the formulation of government methods and activities, and the 'goso' were seen as an 'acceptable', if unwelcome, disturbance to the streets of the capital, in terms of expression of aims and objections.  Their objections were listened to, not just because Kyoto was so poorly policed, but because the authorities feared the presence on the streets of the mikoshi (portable shrines). Of course, this didn't make for a theocracy (or "semi-theocracy"; can one have a state that is<br/>
 'semi-communist' or 'semi-fascist'?), but the religious institutions held a large sway, and Buddhist/Shinto/Taoist/Confucian/Shamanist religiousity permeated society from the rituals of the court to the  matsuri in the fields. When the Ikko-Ikki erupted in the 1480s (until the destruction of Nagashima and the Ishiyama Honganji, the Hokke-Ikko overwhelmed in the capital (1532-36), and Enryakui assisted the enemies of Nobunaga, they were then destroyed. Nobunaga undertook measures not witnessed since the Taira destruction of Nara, and for similar reasons; the sects had overstepped the mark and become too embroiled in the secular world, and interferred in their plans. This said, other than the Hokke-ikko of the 1530s, none of the sects marched on the capital with an eye to its capture and the installation of a national regime based upon any particular sect's beliefs. Even Nichiren in the 13th century did not oppose the Shogun because of his authority, but objected to the bakufu's<br/>
 alleged slander of the Dharma. Opposition was one thing; outright theocracy (in terms of Iran, or at a push the Vatican City State) was a step the sects didn't (at least openly) contemplate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I meant it in the lightest sense (hence "SEMI-Theocracy) ;) <br/>
Could one have really united the country under one rule without the <br/>
cooperation or destruction of the Ikko Ikki?  That was sort of my <br/>
point, or one of them.  Meaning, in the invented theoretical case <br/>
above, if the Shogun is a puppet for the Buddhists, they have <br/>
control, and it therefore would be in thier interest to be theocratic <br/>
about things. Unlike all of the previous times, Japan was broken up <br/>
completely by independent Daimyo, and I guess you could look on the <br/>
Enryakuji, etc. in a similar way.  That being the case, they are as <br/>
much an impediment to one uniting the country as an enemy daimyo.  In <br/>
which case you either work with them or against them. And what <br/>
would "working with them" entail?<br/>
<br/>
But all that is just a side question/comment to the original - which <br/>
was what would the most likely event be if someone else not as <br/>
completely and utterly iron fisted against the Ikko Ikki et all as <br/>
Nobunaga had tried to unify the country.  Nobunaga didnt stop at <br/>
Enryakuji, it was policy for his armies to slaughter men, women, <br/>
children, and the old who were in any way associated with the ikko <br/>
ikki fortresses he brought down.</div>

If Nobunaga had'nt destroyed the Ikko-Ikki, another daimyo would, we also could go as far as wonder: what if Nobunaga were killed trying to destroy them?, would hideyoshi become the next power on the land?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, I can work with this...and my answer is no. Too<br/>
strong of a "national" movement (in the sense of it<br/>

nationwide, rather than being a political force in the<br/>
"national" capital), I think. <br/>

While most still held some respect for their religious<br/>
position, Nobunaga simply saw them as an impediment to<br/>
political consolidation (under himself, of course!). <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good question. Um...most likely, confirming their land<br/>
holdings, possibly/probably giving them more, and<br/>
trying to convince them to at least not attack you<br/>
from behind, if not help against your enemies. Same<br/>
things you do to get another daimyo on your<br/>
side--convince him helping you is to his advantage<br/>
with land and stuff. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the ikko ikki, etc. are a little different than a clan headed <br/>
by a Daimyo, they dont really have "lands" per se, nor do they really <br/>
have a "daimyo" who you can kill to send the armies scattering to the <br/>
winds. They are almost like a hydra, every time you cut off a head, <br/>
two more grow back - just like any good fanatical religious <br/>
movement.  I think Nobunaga did the only thing that would have really <br/>
worked - wipe them off the map - because they had been independent <br/>
and growing for so long, I doubt they would have bowed to anyone, <br/>
hence the idle thought of a semi-theocracy - but not so much to teach <br/>
and force religion, but just so that they could consolodate political <br/>
power and thier own lands, profits, and holdings, etc.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I should have been more clear. I was<br/>
specifically thinking more of the established temples<br/>
like the Enryakuji, which DO have a daimyo (an abbot),<br/>
DID have lands, etc. You're correct, the Ikko-ikki<br/>
were more a localized phenomenon that spread<br/>
nationally, but they DID have a national HQ in the the<br/>
Ishiyama-Honganji, and a national leader in Abbot<br/>
Kenyo. I'll point out that once he surrendered to<br/>
Nobunaga, you don't hear too much about Ikko<br/>
uprisings. <br/>
<br/>
I think Nobunaga did the only thing that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did he wipe them off the map? I think they just<br/>
accepted they weren't going to win. They continued to<br/>
exist--apparently strong enough that Ieyasu had to<br/>
manufacture a split in the sect later on, hence the<br/>
Nishi and Higashi Honganji temples...<br/>

       Assuming the Imagawa had won at Okehazama (and Nobunaga anyway, but <br/>
possibly also both the then-future Toyotomi and Tokugawa, killed, as were they <br/>
not on the same side at this time?) and continued on toward Kyoto, was the Asai <br/>

understand, being the daimyo in southern Omi.  Would the Asai not have been too far <br/>
west?  And the Saito all but out of the way completely?  Or was it just that they <br/>
were other power-broking clans that would have to have been dealt with?  Or <br/>
would the Asai have been trouble for them by virtue of being a Nobunaga ally?<br/>
       And as far as the Ikko Ikki needing to be dealt with, it wasn't a <br/>
choice of cooperation.  Either you wipe them out or they wipe YOU out.  So in that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don't have to be directly on the road to Kyoto to<br/>
be a problem. Look at Asakura Yoshikage for Nobunaga.<br/>
The Saito controlled the road to Kyoto--the Tokaido<br/>
and Nakasendo intersect at this wee village named<br/>
Sekigahara, which is smack in the middle of Mino. And<br/>
the Asai, well, they are close enough that they'd be<br/>
an issue if they wanted to be. As for allies--they<br/>
weren't allied to Nobunaga until much later, so that's<br/>
not it. <br/>
