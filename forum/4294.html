<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081603739">As far as the samurai archives goes, the short answer is no.  There <br/>
are too many sword sites and sword experts out there to warrant a <br/>
treatment from us, who lack said sword expertise.  We would accept <br/>
articles for the featured articles section in regards to weaponry, <br/>
however, as it is lacking from the page.<br/>
