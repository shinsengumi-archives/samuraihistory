Be born into a samurai family (or be adopted by one). It was a hereditary class.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it's all academic, as samurai were legislated out of existence in 1868.<br/>

really static? Or were the farmer/samurai always of that status?<br/>

Remember old John Belushi skits? Samurai bookkeeper!<br/>

<br/>
I think ya mean Hideyoshi Toyotomi, right?<br/>
<br/>
According to what I know, to be adopted into a samurai family, or being born<br/>
into a samurai family is not enough.<br/>
<br/>
The Bushido, Honour, Obligation, Loyalty first to the Ways, second to the<br/>
Lord and third to the family is the main important things.<br/>
<br/>
A person being born into an samurai family,  but without the behaviour of an<br/>
true samurai is NOTHING more than a boo-chan, no matter what age he/she<br/>
would be.<br/>
<br/>
And Honour is more than etiquete, more than self-dignity, it is<br/>
responsability with our own duties, word given and a behaviour that would<br/>
make the one a desserver of such respect.<br/>
<br/>
It is to live in death and die in life. Or at least, be ready to die if<br/>
needed be, when the time comes, in the defense of the Honour that also,<br/>
includes the Lord who pay the expenses of the samurai in question.<br/>

What makes a samurai a samurai is almost only bloodline or adoption. There<br/>
were honourable samurais and dishonorable samurais,  but only buke or<br/>
adopted .<br/>
<br/>
To think that honour was the main condition to be a samurai is like to think<br/>
that in middle age or arthurian europe, knights had to be brave and respect<br/>
a code of chivalry... knights (especially errants) were just like samurai :<br/>
sometimes honourable, sometimes looter, sometimes robbers, sometimes raper<br/>
but  tight as a "class" by some kind of image of the brave "courtois" (sorry<br/>
i don't know how to translate this from french, it is related to love code<br/>
of chivalry) knight.<br/>

<br/>
What you have to bear in mind is that all these grand ideas like bushido and<br/>
honourable combat only exist after the wars once the samurai had their teeth<br/>
pulled.<br/>
<br/>
During the Sengoku era you'd likely be in trouble if you didn't kill an<br/>
enemy when he had his back to you.<br/>

Sounds like Bushido was a little bit like the "Code of the West".  The Code <br/>

By the way, I'm not knocking either one.  We need ideals to live up to.  We <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438372842">Toyotomi Hideyoshi was born a samurai, although he was born into a <br/>
poor samurai family that, like many other poor samurai families, <br/>
also farmed.  But eventually he rose through the ranks to become <br/>
Kampaku, the highest rank Hideyoshi could receive since he didn't <br/>
descended from any imperial families, like all previous Shoguns. But <br/>
he was pretty much the "Shogun". <br/>
<br/>
Later on, Hideyoshi slammed the door shut on social mobility, <br/>
abolishing the concept of the ji-zamurai, or 'samurai of the land' <br/>
who tilled the soil when not at war. Even lowly ashigaru were made <br/>
samurai, albeit low-ranking ones, and were forbidden to do village <br/>
work and were eventually ordered to live in the castle town of their <br/>
lords. The status edict guaranteed that there would not be another <br/>
Toyotomi Hideyoshi. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529708796">I know later in the Tokugawa era, some merchants, who were well off, <br/>
were given the status of the two swords, but I'm not sure peasants <br/>
would be granted the title of Samurai. But it makes sense that if <br/>
they did something like save a daimyo's life, he would reward them <br/>
with the title, anyone know for sure?<br/>
