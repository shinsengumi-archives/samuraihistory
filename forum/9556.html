<h3>Death of Nobuhide?</h3>
by <i>mijalo_jp</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835075340">Dear all,<br/>
   <br/>
  Just a little confusion here. Can anyone tell me when Oda Nobuhide died, as on the Oda Timeline (samurai-archives.com) it says 1551, but at a number of other sites it says 1549???<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks in advance<br/>

 The Shinchokoki (A contemporary record of the life of Oda Nobunaga<br/>
and  a primary source) has Nobuhide's death the third month, third day<br/>
of Tenbun 20, which was 1551.  The Sengoku Jinmei Jiten also has 1551.<br/>
 Papinot's book is good, but is dated and does have a lot of errors.</div>

 </span></blockquote>According to member Tatsunoshi, Jeroen Lamer's book on Oda Nobunaga<br/>
has the correct info.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is safe to assume that any books published by a university<br/>
press since the 60's or so should be pretty reliable. Probably some<br/>
before that, but I'm just sort of arbitrarily assigning a date. <br/>
Turnbull relied(s) heavily on Papinot, at least for his early Samurai<br/>
books, so it is generally a good idea to get a second opinion on his<br/>
books.</div>
