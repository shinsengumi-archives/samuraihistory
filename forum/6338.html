<h3>Good blades, bad blades</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-183802171">A story goes:<br/>
<br/>
Long ago, two smiths met near a small stream.<br/>
<br/>
They were Masamune and his student Muramasa, and each of them <br/>
brought one of their finest blades. To show the quality of his craft, <br/>
Muramasa placed his blade in the streambed in such a way that the <br/>
edge just broke the surface. As the leaves floated by, they were<br/>
neatly cut in two, and Muramasa recovered his blade, proud of his<br/>
craftsmanship.<br/>
<br/>
Masamune then placed his blade in the stream. This time, as the<br/>
leaves floated along, the were deflected to the left and right,<br/>
slipping past the blade, as it were, without harm.<br/>
<br/>
This story is used to exemplify the difference between the two<br/>
smiths, but the tale is apocryphal, the two men lived about 200 years <br/>
apart, but it does demonstrate the reputation of their blades.<br/>
<br/>
Muramasa was noted for 'bad luck' blades, and I have read somewhere<br/>
he might have suffered from some mental disability, perhaps<br/>
schizophrenia (quite how this is arrived at, I have no idea).<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu had an antipathy towards Muramasa blades, he cut<br/>
himself with one as a child, his grandfather was killed with one and<br/>
when his son committed seppuku, the kaishaku used a Muramasa blade. <br/>
<br/>
Ieyasu let it be known that his men should get rid of them if they<br/>
owned one, and Muramasa blades became prized possessions amongst his<br/>
enemies.<br/>
<br/>
My question - is the 'ill luck' reputation of Muramasa blades founded<br/>
on Ieyasu's antipathy, or is there evidence of this prior to the<br/>
Tokugawa?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603865858">From what google taught me:<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, that story is used to illustrate the difference between <br/>
compassionate power and brutal power, as well as studying martial <br/>
arts to preserve and respect life and studying martial arts to <br/>
destroy life, etc.<br/>
<br/>
From what I read, the curse begins with Tokugawa because of <br/>
connections to his relatives' deaths. To add one more to the death <br/>
toll, Ieyasu's wife was sentenced to death for adultry (same for his <br/>
son), and of course the blade used was a Muramasa.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the best website I found:<br/>

You can get a bunch of hits on google with a search for<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It may or may not have been a Muramasa sword that she<br/>
was executed with, but she wasn't killed for adultery.<br/>
She was killed for being suspected of plotting against<br/>
Nobunaga with her son, and in order to keep the heat<br/>
off of himself, Ieyasu had both of them killed. <br/>

<h3>Re: Good blades, bad blades</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833700879">According to Ieyasu's biographer, A.L. Sadler:<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa Nobuyasu's seppuku was overseen by Hattori Hanzo, who <br/>
had been despatched by Ieyasu, along with one of Ieyasu's <br/>
retainers, Amakata Michitsuna, to see the matter through.<br/>
<br/>
Hattori is, of course, Ieyasu' famous 'ninja chief' and <br/>
Nobuyasu requested the man to act as his kaishaku. When it came <br/>
to it, Hattori was so emotional he could not act, and Amakatsu <br/>
stepped forward to administer the coup de grace.<br/>
<br/>
Ieyasu had told both men before their despatch that his son was <br/>
innocent and that the plot would at some time be shown to be a <br/>
slanderous rumour.<br/>
<br/>
On their return, there was not a dry eye in the house. Both men <br/>
were troubled by the task undertaken, and both Honda Tadakatsu <br/>
and Sakakibara Yasumasa (2 of the shi-tenno - 'the 4 pillars of <br/>
the Tokugawa') wept aloud.<br/>
<br/>
"And of what make was the wakizashi with which the second <br/>
struck off his head?" asked Ieyasu. "Muramasa," came the reply. <br/>
"How ominous!" he remarked. "It was a Muramasa blade that <br/>
struck down my grandfather, and when I was a child I cut myself <br/>
with one by accident, and now my son is killed by one. Muramasa <br/>
blades bode ill for our house. If any of you possess one, he <br/>
had better get rid of it."<br/>
<br/>
Later Ieyasu observed "Even such a devil as Hanzo does not care <br/>
to cut off the head of his master," (which does little to <br/>
reinforce the idea of the ninja as heartless murderers).<br/>
<br/>
Amakatsu, on hearing this, sensed an ominous tone in Ieyasu's <br/>
words and took himself off with all haste to Mount Koya, and <br/>
later took service with Hideyoshi.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
The lady Tsukiyama was put to death at another time and another <br/>
place, and another retainer, Nonaka Shigemasa, oversaw <br/>
proceedings - so the Muramasa link to her might be apocryphal.<br/>

My understanding is that it was a Tokugawa thing although the first<br/>
generation Muramasa was reputed to have a dark and brooding character.It<br/>
seems that many Muramasa signatues were altered to disguise their true<br/>
maker's identity. Interestingly when there was open opposition to the<br/>
Tokugawa in the Bakamatsu period, Muramasa blades became very popular with<br/>
the Royalist supporters.<br/>
