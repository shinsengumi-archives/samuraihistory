<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They weren't *honorary* surnames. The Minamoto family<br/>
was descended from a son of the Emperor Suwa who took<br/>
the name "Minamoto". Hence them also being referred to<br/>
as the "Suwa Genji", Genji being how you read the<br/>
characters for "Minamoto family".  <br/>
<br/>
The Taira clan was descended from a grandson of<br/>
Emperor Kammu, who took the name. "Taira" can also be<br/>
read "Hei", and you often see them referred to as the<br/>
"Heike" (Taira House) or the "Heishi" (Taira Family).<br/>
The most influential branch of the Taira originated in<br/>
Ise, so you see them referred to as the Ise Heike<br/>
often. <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, the Emperor didn't just go out and say<br/>
"Poof, you're now a Minamoto" or "Shazzam, you're now<br/>
a Taira". You weren't given these names like titles,<br/>
for a "job well done". These were hereditary family<br/>
names--you simply didn't just "become" a Minamoto or a<br/>
Taira. Same with the Fujiwara--Toyotomi Hideyoshi had<br/>
to arrange to be adopted by a Fujiwara nobleman, to<br/>
give legitimacy to his title of Kampaku. Tokugawa<br/>
Ieyasu had several family tree charts drawn up to<br/>
support claims of descent from either the Minamoto,<br/>
Taira, or Fujiwara, as the situation<br/>
dictated--everyone is taught that the Tokugawa were<br/>
descended from the Minamoto because that was state<br/>
orthodoxy for 200 years, to legitamize the Tokugawa<br/>
bakufu. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, realized I needed to clarify the above point.<br/>
Hideyoshi couldn't simply have been "named" a Fujiwara<br/>
or Minamoto or whatever--he had to contrive a scenario<br/>
where he legitimately became one. It wasn't the<br/>
Emperor who made him a "Fujiwara", it was his adoption<br/>
into the family. Similarly, nobody could "make" Ieyasu<br/>
a Minamoto--he had to concoct a family history that<br/>
"proved" he was one by birth, whether it was true or<br/>
not. Both were fairly inventive about how they did it,<br/>
in my opinion.<br/>

Thanks for that great response! I had wondered why there were so many<br/>
Minamoto and Taira in the history books, and it was a Wikipedia article<br/>
on 'Minamoto' that I was looking at earlier that stated that the name<br/>
was honorary... proving once again to take all Wikipedia articles with a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interestingly enough, I had to go to a Wikipedia<br/>
article to jog my memory on the Emperor the Taira were<br/>
primarily descended from--I couldn't remember Kammu,<br/>
for some reason. <br/>
<br/>
Wikipedia is great for fast, shallow knowledge, but<br/>
you do need to take it with a grain of salt.<br/>
Unfortunately, like many people here who have read a<br/>
lot for pleasure but not for research, it'd hard for<br/>
me to remember where I read what :) <br/>
<br/>
When in doubt, I plead with Tony to give me a source.<br/>
Or I just use him, and the blame goes his way. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the context of the question, it is true. The<br/>
question was about awarding of the name by the<br/>
Emperor. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > For instance I have a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The fact that swordsmiths use the Minamoto or Fujiwara<br/>
name doesn't mean it's an "honorary" title given to<br/>
them by some authoritative figure. You'll have to<br/>
provide more information than that--WHY do these<br/>
swordsmiths use the names? Did they just decide to, or<br/>
did someone from the families lend them the name, or<br/>
adopt them, or some such? You'd have to show me some<br/>
evidence that the Emperor "granted" these swordsmiths<br/>
the names for it to contradict my point. There are<br/>
umpteen "Bizen no kami" swordsmiths, but none of them<br/>
actually governed the province--I think the topic of<br/>
swordsmiths is ancillary to what Angus was trying to<br/>
ask. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No need to keep your head down, Clive--heck, we rely<br/>
on you whenever anyone asks ANYTHING about swords (You<br/>
and Carlo, that is). I'm simply a stickler for<br/>
precision when answering someone's question, and while<br/>
introducing new info (ie. about the swordsmiths taking<br/>
the names) is good and adds to the discussion, it<br/>
helps if you give it the proper context so as not to<br/>
confuse the questioner. <br/>
