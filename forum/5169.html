Reading 'between the lines', did not the run-up to Nagashino <br/>

Takeda 'ninja' were working the subversion operation, and <br/>
Tokugawa 'ninja' were working counter-insurgency? Or am I <br/>
being over-romantic?<br/>
<br/>
Such being the case, the Tokugawa managed to manouvre the <br/>

intelligence rather than assassinations, wall-climbings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise the eventual seppuku of Tokugawa Hideyasu was <br/>
brought about by a 'plot' that was believed unlikely (by Sadler, <br/>
anyway), but was considered a necessary expedient by Ieyasu to <br/>
secure the Oda-Tokugawa alliance. Might this not have been a <br/>
plot to destabilise the two, and where would history have gone <br/>
if they had fought each other?<br/>
<br/>
Again, as Paul pointed out an age ago (hi Paul) there's a scene <br/>
in Kagemusha where 3 peasants (in the employ of the Oda and <br/>

convinced it is he, which is the report that goes back to HQ.<br/>

No doubt Hollywood would have them attempt to assassinate <br/>
Shingen with blow darts, exploding geisha, or something of that <br/>

goes, I resemble that remark!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There may have been intel/counterintell involved (GOD<br/>
I would love to find data on that...drool) but<br/>
essentially it wasn't a "ninja", but a well placed<br/>
Tokugawa administrator who had agreed to set a fire<br/>
and open the gates to the Takeda army. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really. The Takeda executed a tactical withdrawal,<br/>
once they saw they couldn't take Okazaki like they had<br/>
hoped. Katsuyori simply didn't want to leave empty<br/>
handed, so they attacked Yoshida-jo first, then<br/>
Nagashino. At Yoshida-jo, it was too well defended for<br/>
a quick siege, and Katsuyori was afraid of the<br/>
reinforcements coming up from Nobunaga. Nagashino,<br/>
however, was too good to pass up, with the personal<br/>
history between the Takeda and the keeper of the<br/>
castle for the Tokugawa. Katsuyori could have simply<br/>
retreated back into Kai--he wasn't "maneuvered" into<br/>
fighting at Nagashino by Ieyasu, per se. <br/>

"shinobi no mono" or "kusa". I'd LOVE to do research<br/>
on the intell techniques of the sengoku, but man,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>During WWII the Brits wanted to take out some lock gates in <br/>
France. The lock was too close to a civilian site to bomb, too <br/>
heavily defended for the Resistance to attack.<br/>
<br/>
At the Royal College of Art in London, a special department was <br/>
working on disguises - timers that looked like pens, and, I kid <br/>
you not, anti-personnel mines that looked and smelled like <br/>
cowpats.<br/>
<br/>
MI attained drawings of the locks, and the guys at the RC saw <br/>
that the canal was topped up by a river, the overflow sluiced <br/>
through a tunnel beneath the lock itself.<br/>
<br/>
Solution: A dead dog was packed with explosives and a <br/>
pressure switch, and parachuted to the resistance, who dumped <br/>
it in the canel above the lock. The dog floated down, under the <br/>
nose of the guards, was sucked into the sluice where the water <br/>
pressure triggered the switch and bang! Success!<br/>
<br/>
(Not sure about the exploding cowpats, though)<br/>

course there were covert messages between Katsuyori<br/>
and said administrator. Incidentally, it's killing me<br/>
that I can't remember his name. For some reason Ota<br/>
Yasusuke sticks in my head, but that's wrong--Yasusuke<br/>
was a Hojo retainer. I'm currently not able to get to<br/>
my crutch, the Turnbull book on Nagashino, and when<br/>
the first hit on Google that comes up is a report that<br/>
I myself wrote (and neglected to mention the name),<br/>
I'm out of luck. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Generally I find reality more interesting. I'd rather<br/>
read about how someone bribed the maid of Lord<br/>
so-and-so to gain access to a room where they<br/>
overheard x conversation, then snuck out dressed as a<br/>
monk and such, than to hear some silly story about<br/>
sneaking in dressed in black pajamas, killing guards<br/>
with magical incantations, then disappearing in a<br/>
cloud of smoke. Bah.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Possibly, yeah. However, speaking as a member of the<br/>
US Intel community, the "journalist" cover is frowned<br/>
upon, though it was used. Too easy to get into<br/>
trouble. At least you didn't say Red Cross worker or<br/>
Priest--both of those are right out. <br/>

<br/>
you now this scene in Kagemusha is maybe one of the<br/>
most accurate depictions of ninja ever in a film.<br/>
<br/>
you have 3 guys dressed in every day cloths, I think<br/>
one is even a priest.<br/>
<br/>
Not a single black suit anywhere. Its fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
Just wish people would accept this as fact and not<br/>
just some guys in a movie scene watching some<br/>

Ohh well off to watch Ninja 3 the domination for my<br/>

Again, as Paul pointed out an age ago (hi Paul)<br/>
there's a scene <br/>
in Kagemusha where 3 peasants (in the employ of the<br/>
Oda and <br/>
the Tokugawa) are watching 'Shingen' review his troops<br/>
and are <br/>
convinced it is he, which is the report that goes back<br/>

HIGHLY doubt he'd be any good as a Japanese, be it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always thought the reality is so much more amazing than any <br/>
fiction.  i guess 100 years of civil war truly does work a certain <br/>
social darwinism.  It took almost 80 years after the Onin war for <br/>
someone like Nobunaga to come along and start busting heads and <br/>
taking names.  The treachery, strategy, epic battles, and reality of <br/>
the Sengoku is probably more interesting and epic than most fiction <br/>
books could ever hope for - although LOTR is way up there :P <br/>
<br/>
You'd have to work backwards into ancient history to find much <br/>
comparable, where war was everyday life for entire lifetimes.</div>

<br/>
From the swordsmanship angle the Sengoku is, I think, THE era, <br/>
and certainly produced the great names (Musashi aside).<br/>
<br/>
I also think it far more pragmatic in outlook. The Sengoku <br/>
Samurai touches the depths as well as the heights, and here we <br/>
find the best and the worst ... and most of the 'names' have a bit <br/>
of both about them, which to me adds the depth and colour to the <br/>
tales.<br/>
<br/>
I can't remember precisely the where or when, but there was a <br/>
time when Ieyasu went to visit Hideyoshi(?) and a number of <br/>
Hideyoshi's women were the hostages of the Tokugawa.<br/>
<br/>
Sakai used to go and sit with them, chat and pass the time to <br/>
ease their nerves, meanwhile outside Honda was stacking <br/>
firewood against the walls, ready to torch the place if anything <br/>
should happen to his lord. What days!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It happened (I believe) in 1586, when Hideyoshi was having all of the <br/>
Daimyo come to him to essentially swear allegiance.  Ieyasu was the <br/>
only Daimyo who refused the "inviation", so Hideyoshi was stuck with <br/>
a choice - Does he attack Ieyasu, or find another way to get him <br/>
to "submit"?  Hideyoshi's choice was to send his own mother to <br/>
Ieyasu, essentially as a hostage.  Today I was watching a TV show <br/>
that I had taped a few days ago called - "Kono Hito o Miyo - Toyotomi <br/>
Hideyoshi" which covered the incedent.  It basicaly said that <br/>
Hideyoshi was a master at reading people.  It stated that Hideyoshi <br/>
knew that Ieyasu was taken from his own mother at a very young age, <br/>
and that because of this he would take care of Hideyoshi's mother.  <br/>
The incedent you mentioned happened while his mother was at <br/>
Hamamatsu, although the TV show didnt mention it - it was brought up <br/>
on the Samurai Forum a few days ago.  Basically, Ieyasu showed up at <br/>
Osaka castle, and everyone saw this as a significant event showing <br/>
that Ieyasu was submitting to Hideyoshi.  So Hideyoshi basically won <br/>
without fighting, and his mother came back without a scratch.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I dont understand the reason the the other daimyo didnt <br/>
see Hideyoshi's mother going to Hamamatsu as Hideyoshi submitting to <br/>
Ieyasu, particularly because it was very well known how greatly <br/>
Hideyoshi cared about his mother....</div>

 </span></blockquote>Along the lines of Sengoku spies, I came across an interesting bit on <br/>
Mori Motonari and his use of spies.  In 1554, he used spies to spread <br/>
rumors about a certain Era Fusahide, who was a skilled and powerful <br/>
vassal of Sue Harukata, saying that he was intending to turn against <br/>
Sue, and join the Mori.  Then Mori Motonari sent a <br/>
letter "discussing" an offer to join the Mori to Fusahide, which was <br/>
intercepted by Sue Harukata.  With this letter and the rumors spread <br/>
by Mori spies, Harukata had Fusahide excecuted, and this took a <br/>
strong ally of Sue Harukata out of the picture for Motonari.</div>
