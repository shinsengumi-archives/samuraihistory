For all it's frightening look, the ono doesn't seem to have had much use. It<br/>
wasn't a standard weapon the armies were equipped with. I believe that, like<br/>
the tetsubo, it was something that had been more in use earlier when armies<br/>
were less rigidly made.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was definitely a weapon. The thing is, as you suggest, was it an<br/>
*efficient* weapon? It clearly could be a devastating one, but it would be<br/>
one hard to wield and control. Swords and lances made for much better<br/>
infantry weapons. Otherwise *all* our infantrymen might be carrying bazookas<br/>
instead of M-16s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990942214">On the use of the battleaxe, it may or may not have<br/>
been used but in terms of its use against a swordsman<br/>
it could be a very effective weapon in the hands of<br/>
the right men .  Probably no equivalent corps existed<br/>
within Sengoku Japan but the value of the battleaxe is<br/>
demonstrated by the Anglo-Danish/Saxon Huscarls<br/>
introduced into eleventh-century England by Cnut, or<br/>
the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine emperors .  I<br/>
have never heard of its useage within Japan, but its<br/>
value should not be discounted, even against a katana<br/>
wielding swordsman .<br/>

    Masakari also read etsu. When used for battle it was called Masakari or<br/>
fuetsu (big axe) when used for wood cutting, ono.<br/>
<br/>
    The name (reading) masakari some believe comes from the similar sounding<br/>
"ma saki wari" or "cuts dead straight".<br/>
<br/>
In ancient China an "ono" was presented by rulers to their lead generals as a<br/>
symbol of their commision to subdue enemy forces...<br/>
<br/>
They were used to break down obstalces, bamboo fences and stakes, or to attack<br/>
the walls and gates of fortifications. (He places them as Kamakura period<br/>
weapons-tch)<br/>
<br/>
The kogata masakari had a 3 or 4 shaku handle with a 3 sun wide blade<br/>
<br/>
The Omasakari had a 1shaku blade.<br/>
<br/>
These are mentioned in the Taikeiki and other old chronicles...<br/>
<br/>
( I have seen these illustrated but never seen an actual "masakari" in any<br/>
museum. There is a book on weapons that should have at least one example but I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221837706">the ono, i guess ill use this one post to refrence the<br/>
whole subject.<br/>
 a couples of years ago i purchased an ono that was<br/>
told was based on measurements from a period piece.<br/>
that being said i cant know for certain that it is an<br/>
accurate replica.  The ono i have is mounted on a<br/>
approx. 5ft pole, per orional specs and it is<br/>
prohibitively heavy. for those who dont know me,,, im<br/>
not exactly small at 5' 11" and 300 lbs and i find it<br/>
excedingly too heavy to use well.   it would be<br/>
excellent in destoying  wooden structures as your<br/>
source mentions. but i  personally would never take it<br/>
on an open battlefield. its only application there i<br/>
can think of would be to give it to relatively<br/>
untrained men figuring that if they do hit something<br/>
skill, placement or knowledge will have little to do<br/>
with it so just do maximum damage. and you can guess<br/>
how well that would work.<br/>
the masakari ive seen seem to be more odf a standard<br/>
one handed axe with a long back spike. not my favorite<br/>
type of weapon but practical.<br/>
