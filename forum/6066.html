Yes I do know that Karate began before this. But what I am saying is that master Funakoshi's style is derived directly from the old <br/>
ways of Okinawa. Just because JKA was formed in the 20th century does not mean that it has lost the old ways.<br/>

<h3>Change in Japanese Army & Navy swords</h3>
by <i>woneil38</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-854126753">When the Japanese formed their modern army and navy in the late 1800s they <br/>
initially adopted Western type swords along with Western style uniforms. At <br/>
some point in the early 1900s, however, they changed to samurai-type <br/>
swords. Does anyone know when this took place?<br/>

The army Shin-gunto was introduced 1933-34 and generally replaced the<br/>
Kyu-gunto or European style of sword, however, the Kyu-gunto continued to be<br/>
used by some, probably higher ranking individuals,  right up to the<br/>
surrender of 1945. At about the same time the naval Kai-gunto was<br/>
introduced. (see Fuller and Gregory Military Swords pf Japan 1868-1945).<br/>
Hope this is of some help.<br/>

Exactly what I was looking for -- thanks very much. I'm writing a review of <br/>
a book (Haruo Tohmatsu and H[edley] P[aul] Willmott, _A Gathering Darkness: <br/>
The Coming of War to the Far East and the Pacific, 1921-1942_, Total War: <br/>
New Perspectives on World War II, edited by Michael A. Barnhart and H. P. <br/>
Willmott, Lanham, Maryland: SR Books, 2004) in which the claim is made that <br/>
the changeover occurred in 1936. It matters because they are taking it as a <br/>
marker for a shift in orientation. I was sure that 1936 was too late and <br/>
it's nice to know the facts.<br/>
