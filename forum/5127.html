 </span></blockquote>Can't say I blame you--after a quick search, I came up<br/>
with a billion hits for Onimusha or other video games,<br/>
but only found one or two things that had any claim to<br/>
reality. 2 sites mention the "Toshiie to Matsu" NHK<br/>
drama from 2002. Apparently Maeda Keijiro made an<br/>
appearance in one episode, though it doesn't explain<br/>
much. While it is a TV show, generally the NHK dramas<br/>
can be viewed as "mostly" historical, and so I'd<br/>
assume that he was a real person. <br/>
<br/>
A little while later I found this site:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shungansho.fc2web.com/meguruhito/maeda.htm">http://shungansho.fc2web.com/meguruhito/maeda.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I've not got the time to get out the denki jisho and<br/>
translate it, but a brief glance shows he was an<br/>
adopted son of Maeda Toshiie, and at the time of<br/>
Sekigahara served Uesugi Kagekatsu. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps. <br/>

<h3>Women&#39;s names</h3>
by <i>ltdomer98</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403273976">While doing some research on Akechi Mitsuhide, I came<br/>
across a website that lists his daughter Hosokawa<br/>
Gracia's original name as "Tamako". I'd always thought<br/>
her Japanese name was "Tama", no ~ko. I noticed also<br/>
that many of the women's names mentioned in Sansom<br/>
(just finished volumes 1 and 2 recently) have the ~ko<br/>
suffix, which I always thought was a rather modern<br/>
phenomenon, dating largely from the beginning of this<br/>
century. While I know ~ko names existed back<br/>
throughout history, I didn't think it was all that<br/>
common. And then I see "Tamako" instead of Tama, so<br/>
know I'm wondering if this is a "modernization" after<br/>
the fact by some historians/authors/whomever, who<br/>
assume that all Japanese female names have a ~ko (and<br/>
haven't been following pop Japanese naming trends,<br/>
with the proliferation of Amis, Ayumis, Ais, Hatsumis,<br/>
Juris, Nanas, Sayuris, etc.) so they just added it on<br/>
their own. I'm fairly sure Mitsuhide's daughter was<br/>
"Tama" with no ~ko. <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keiji was a real person. He was born under the name Takigawa in 1540 <br/>
and died in 1612. He was the adopted son of Maeda Toshihisa (brother <br/>
of Maeda Toshiie) and became a ronin after Toshiie took over control <br/>
of the clan (seems as if he was a great fighter but lousy at <br/>
following orders). Around the time of Sekigahara he served the Uesugi <br/>
under yet another name, Hyottosai Kokuzoin. After Sekigahara he <br/>
became a ronin again. Like Yagyu Jubei (and to an extant Musashi), <br/>
his wanderings as a ronin and disappearances from mainstream history <br/>
led to a lot of idle speculation and exaggerated stories.<br/>
Game designers sure like him-he's been in Kessen along with Samurai <br/>
Warriors and the Onimusha series.</div>
