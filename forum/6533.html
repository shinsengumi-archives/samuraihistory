<h3>DVD Release: &#39;Twilight Samurai&#39; offers both action, romance</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481931700">'Twilight Samurai' offers both action, romance<br/>
<br/>
Among the many primo Asian films to reach our shores and vidstores <br/>
over the past few months, Yoji Yamada's 2002 The Twilight Samurai, <br/>
newly released by Empire Pictures ($26.98), earns a spot at the top <br/>
of the list. <br/>
<br/>
It's our... <br/>
DVD pick of the week <br/>
<br/>
    Seibei Iguchi (Hiroyuki Sanada) is not your typical screen <br/>
samurai. A low-ranking office worker in a late-19th-century Japanese <br/>
village, the widowed Seibei spends his spare time caring for his <br/>
beloved young daughters and elderly mother. Potential romance enters <br/>
the picture when recently divorced former childhood friend Tomoe <br/>
(Rie Miyazawa) seeks to reconnect with Seibei. The only problem is <br/>
Tomoe's abusive, hard-drinking ex, a high-ranking samurai who's <br/>
determined to challenge Seibei to a duel.<br/>
<br/>
While his film concludes with an intense action sequence, director <br/>
Yamada lavishes far greater attention on the rhythms of daily life <br/>
during a period of dramatic sociopolitical upheaval. Star Sanada, <br/>
who followed "The Twilight Samurai" with a prominent supporting role <br/>
in the Tom Cruise epic "The Last Samurai," gives a particularly <br/>
wrenching, textured performance as the decent family man torn <br/>
between his personal wishes and professional obligations. <br/>
Interesting interviews with actor Sanada and director Yamada <br/>
comprise the disc's only extras, but the film supplies sufficient <br/>
rewards in its own right to justify its purchase price.</div>
