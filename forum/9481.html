only writings I've done will just expose how stupid I am to everyone.<br/>
 I can't stop writing funny stories lately.  I don't have time or<br/>
patience to write a detailed story with good development.  Description<br/>
isn't a problem, I just can't come up with an interesting story unless<br/>
it's about something funny. :( Oh well.  I'm still relatively new at<br/>
writing samurai fiction.  I have never been inspired to try until I<br/>
came to the Citadel.  Next time I'll be ready.</div>

Anyway, there is a comedy genre, so don't count yourself out.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Is there anyone else I would be competing with in the comedy genre? <br/>
It would be nice if there was a bunch of competitors.  I have things I<br/>
can submit, and I have money.  I just don't want to spend it unless<br/>
it's really worth a good challenge.  <br/>
<br/>
As long as we're on th subject of competition.  I'm afraid I may have<br/>
to resign from the cover art contest.  I don't have the spare time or<br/>
resources to get good original art for your cover.  I'm pissed,<br/>
because I know I could do it if I was able to get to some good art to<br/>
get some good shots with my digital camera.  All the art I can find is<br/>
too cliche or copyrighted and I won't submit anything that isn't as<br/>
good as it should be.  I knew what I wanted to do and maybe you might<br/>
consider doing this.  I wanted to use old, but crisp looking<br/>
caligraphy art to cover the back behind the book description.  Not the<br/>
whole kanji, but a corner of the piece that would show enough to make<br/>
word and not simply brush strokes but not the entire piece.  It would<br/>
be up close and askew.  I thought that would be stylish and still<br/>
offer a good background behind the book description.  On the front,<br/>
ranger's post inspired me to do something a bit similar.  Remember the<br/>
one we both liked with the zoomed in gold piece and black backdrop.  I<br/>
had been considering something similar before that because of the<br/>
birds.  When I saw that I knew what I wanted to do.  I took pictures<br/>
of menuki pieces I got off the tsuka of one of my swords and created a<br/>
similar looking cover as the one ranger posted, but I need the back<br/>
art not only to make the back but also to match the color for the<br/>
background in the front or possibly use a shot of the free space on<br/>
the calligraphy art to give it more texture.  Anyway, I can't find<br/>
what I need to make it as good as it should be.</div>
