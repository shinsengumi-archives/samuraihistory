<h3>Inu-Yasha Question</h3>
by <i>keiman0</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-959015527">I warn you gang, this one is really really dumb and yes I did diligently <br/>
search google and dogpile for the answer as well as the IY shrines. Here <br/>
'tis:-<br/>
<br/>
What year is Inu yasha laid in? I mean I know it's the warring states era <br/>
twixt 1500 and 1600 something but is it before Sekigahara in 1600, the Osaka <br/>
battle in 1604, the uniting of the clans in 1615 (Tokogowa era) or is it <br/>
earlier or later than that? The only clue seems to be that in the eppy about <br/>
the Toad Prince the kid NobuNaga (Kag thinks he's 'the' NobuNaga) may the <br/>
young warlord himself. He could be unrelated or a descendant or even an <br/>
ancestor of old NN. Anyone know for sure when IY is set? I say around 1550 <br/>
when the seven samurai were prevalent. I believe Kurogawa did in fact base <br/>
his 7 Samurai fim and later the Samurai 7 anime on a real life incident in <br/>
history. By the way the Risen 7 leader Bankotsu is voiced by Matt Hill. He's <br/>
best known as the voices of Eddie and Big Ed on the cartoon shows Ed, Edd <br/>
and Eddie. The gal doing Jakotsu's voice is familiar and I know her name but <br/>
cannot place her in any animes I've seen. Any help greatly appreciated as <br/>
Mom is sure that IY is laid after Demon Eyed Kyo (Samurai Deeper Kyo). <br/>

<h3>Re: R: [samuraihistory] Inu-Yasha Question</h3>
by <i>keiman0</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917941476">Sorry but it is a basic IY query and is really nitpicking so if ya <br/>
ain't a diehard anime and/or IY fanatic, take no mind. For the rest <br/>
of us- We now have two distinct dates. 1545 and 1615. Remember <br/>
jakotsu's encounter with the matchlock wielding riflemen? There were <br/>
no flintlocks in Japan before the Portugese came in 1545. In 1615 the <br/>
Tokogowan victor's (NobuNaga) first act (after using rifles to win <br/>
the Great Battle which united the clans in 1615) was to ban and <br/>
outlaw 'all' firearms. Therefore it is twixt 1545 and 1615 that IY is <br/>
laid. Another one for you- why are IY and his bro considered 'Lords'? <br/>
More later. Toodles-K&K<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I gather that Inuyasha takes place in the early Sengoku, more like pre<br/>
1500, because the time portal in the well supposedly goes back 500 years.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can narrow it to 1560 - 1575.<br/>
Remember the encounter with the young "Nobunaga"? Oda Nobunaga's name <br/>
seems to be pretty famous already, especially considering Kagome must <br/>
be somewhere near Edo, some 250km away from Owari province, which means <br/>
that the battle of Okehazama (1560) must have already happened.<br/>
And since, according to what the boy says, the Takeda clan still seems <br/>
to be a powerful force to be reckoned with, the battle of Nagashino <br/>
(1575) supposedly hasn't.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, the Hojo are holding Edo in these years...<br/>
