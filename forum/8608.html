<br/>
You're smart to be wary of Wiki, but this seems okay<br/>
to me (at a glance, it jives with most of what I know<br/>
about Yari--I'm no expert though). It seems consistent<br/>
with what I've read in Bottomley & Hopson, which I<br/>
prefer as my source for info about weapons. The only<br/>
part I have a major issue with is:<br/>
<br/>
"The original warfare of the Bushi was not a thing for<br/>
'commoners'; it was a ritualized combat usually<br/>
between two warriors who would challenge each other<br/>
via horseback archery and sword duels. However the<br/>
invasions of Mongols in 1274 and 1281 changed Japanese<br/>
warfare and weaponry."<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty simplistic view of things, and the<br/>
statement about warfare not being a thing for<br/>
"commoners" is a fallacy. "Commoners" simply aren't<br/>
mentioned in the chronicles and histories, because who<br/>
wants to read about Kichibei the grunt? Certainly no<br/>
one who wrote or read said chronicles. Footsoldiers<br/>
certainly did exist, and carried a variety of<br/>
polearms--notably before the mid-1400's they carried<br/>
the naginata. It's true that warfare changed after the<br/>
Mongol invasions, but it's not like in 1281 they<br/>
challenged each other to archery duels, and January<br/>
1st 1282 all of a sudden they started using yari. <br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend finding a copy of "Arms and Armour<br/>
of the Samurai" by Ian Bottomley and Anthony P.<br/>
Hopson, who I mentioned above. It's a bit of a coffee<br/>
table book, but it does give a great outline of the<br/>
development and timeline of Japanese weapons, and<br/>
would tell you likely all you want to know about yari. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279872301">There is a newer book called 'Japanese Spears' by  Ronald Knutson. I dont own it yet, but it I would love to have in on  the coffee table because it looks impressive. Supposedly, it is a  history of the spear from the naginata-yari. It is really the only book  I have seen on just the spear class of weapons in Japan.<br/>

this one in my library. Do get a copy when you can.<br/>
Its an excellent book.<br/>
<br/>
While arms and armor of the samurai is  a good overall<br/>
text, If you want information specifically on yari...<br/>
knutson's book is a great english resource.<br/>
