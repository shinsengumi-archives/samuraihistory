Meeting Hollywood halfway<br/>
<br/>
By MARK SCHILLING<br/>
<br/>
Hollywood and history have never gotten along very well. Hollywood <br/>
makes entertainment and history has a tendency to be boringly <br/>
complex, so accuracy and authenticity often gets lost on the way to <br/>
the multiplex. <br/>
Some Hollywood filmmakers, however, are trying harder to get it <br/>
right. One is Edward Zwick -- the director of "Glory," "Legends of <br/>
the Fall" and, as I learned by e-mail from Zwick himself in June <br/>
2002, "The Last Samurai." Zwick said he needed people in Japan -- <br/>
including me -- to help him with the Japanese dialogue and the <br/>
historical details. In short, to get as much as right as possible <br/>
without sacrificing the drama. <br/>
He admitted to heavily fictionalizing the real-life rebellion, led by <br/>
Saigo Takamori, that inspired the film. "I know full well that [the <br/>
rebels] took up modern arms to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate, and <br/>
that I've fudged the dates of conscription and the edicts," he <br/>
wrote. "What I need is for you to highlight those descriptions, <br/>
interactions, issues that will evoke giggles, if not outrage, from <br/>
the Japanese audience." <br/>
This, he added was not just a commercial consideration, but "a <br/>
personal and artistic one." "I honestly believe," he continued, "(and <br/>
this is, perhaps, the greatest hubris of all) that I can present <br/>
rounded, complex, heroic Japanese characters to an international <br/>
audience; that 16-year-olds everywhere might just come away with an <br/>
awakened sense that our history and that of Japan were intertwined <br/>
long before Pearl Harbor; that words like honor and duty have <br/>
resonance throughout history; and that the birth of the modern and <br/>
such wrenching transitional moments have resonance and application to <br/>
our present circumstance." <br/>
How could I not sign on? My first job was to send Zwick notes on the <br/>
script. I picked a few nits, found a few howlers. One of the <br/>
characters, a young samurai, was called Yoritomo, the name of a <br/>
famous 12th-century warrior and statesman. It was, I wrote Zwick, <br/>
like calling a character in a 19th-century British period drama "the <br/>
Sheriff of Nottingham." <br/>
Zwick ditched the name. He also accepted several other of my <br/>
suggestions, such as changing the martial art the samurai practice <br/>
from karate -- which was then known only in Okinawa -- to jujitsu. <br/>
Several others, however, he passed over in silence. In one scene, the <br/>
rebel leader flings his sword end-over-end at an enemy. Couldn't <br/>
happen, I said -- samurai weren't knife throwers. But Zwick liked the <br/>
image -- and it stayed in. <br/>
More importantly, I found him a Japanese scriptwriter who could <br/>
rewrite the Japanese-language script -- a direct translation from the <br/>
English that Zwick admitted was "horrible." Yo Takeyama is a period-<br/>
drama veteran whose credits included the hit NHK drama "Hideyoshi" <br/>
and the Kon Ichikawa film "Ka-chan." Meeting several times during the <br/>
summer at a Tokyo ryokan, we went over the script line by line. I had <br/>
to make sure Takeyama's rewrites were reflected accurately in the <br/>
English script. In several scenes, he not only corrected the <br/>
Japanese, but added new dialogue, all of which had to be translated. <br/>
We also met with Zwick once in Tokyo. Late for our appointment in the <br/>
lobby of the Imperial Hotel, I spotted a short, bearded, dark-haired <br/>
man eyeing me through the crowd, rushed over to him and starting <br/>
apologizing in Japanese. <br/>
It was Zwick. In my panic I had taken him for a vaguely Japanese-<br/>
looking assistant -- but he loved being mistaken for one of the <br/>
natives. He also hit it off with Takeyama, a tall, lanky former actor <br/>
who is an engaging raconteur and had the answers to his questions <br/>
about Meiji court etiquette. <br/>
Early in September, Takeyama and I sent off our final batch of <br/>
corrections. That October, we went to see the final day of shooting <br/>
in Japan, which took place at a temple in Kyoto. When I got to the <br/>
set, at around 7 in the morning, Zwick was preparing a simple scene --<br/>
 Tom Cruise walking up the temple steps with two foreign companions. <br/>
Beaming, he introduced me to his star, who was being frantically <br/>
fussed over by three women -- one in charge of his Army officer <br/>
costume, the other his makeup, the other his hair. <br/>
I had the odd feeling of stepping out of sleepy, early morning Japan <br/>
and into a hyper-charged Hollywood moment. I noticed that Cruise had <br/>
tiny crow's feet around his eyes, wore a retainer on his teeth and <br/>
was looking straight at me with that trademark burning gaze. No <br/>
surprise there; I had never expected Cruise to be laid back. I was <br/>
even ready for the retainer, having read about it on an Internet <br/>
gossip column. <br/>
What shocked me, first, however, was his height -- I had thought it <br/>
was about the same as mine. I later realized that his boots had made <br/>
him stood several centimeters taller. <br/>
Second, he really wanted to talk, asking me where I was from, how <br/>
long I had been in Japan, and how I liked Tokyo. He was trying to put <br/>
me at ease, but a normal conversation with Tom Cruise was my idea of <br/>
the bizarre. Also, I had my own questions -- but it wasn't the time <br/>
or place to ask about Nicole. <br/>
That brief encounter, and a check, were two of my big rewards for <br/>
being what Warner Brothers called a "Japanese script liaison." I also <br/>
got several later revisions of our own revisions, considerately <br/>
forwarded to me by Zwick's company, Samurai Pictures. <br/>
At least one of my ideas made it into the final version, as I <br/>
recently saw at screening for the press: Samurai practicing jujitsu <br/>
in the tall grass. In Hollywood, scriptwriters commonly get rewritten <br/>
out of existence -- I felt lucky to have, in some small way, <br/>
survived. <br/>
But will they spell my name right in the credits?</div>

Well, it's a good thing that my knowledge of japanese history (or at <br/>
least details like those) is very limited and I won't be bothered by <br/>
them >:D<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with the comment of "dumbing down" history for the <br/>
moviegoers, specially when the true historical fact was much more <br/>
interesting than what the movie ended up being. Too bad the money is <br/>
held by dumb people mostly...<br/>

I "spelled" that right...)<br/>
