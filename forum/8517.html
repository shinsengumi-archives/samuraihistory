<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978705985">I am Hidetomo Yoshimitsu. I reacently moved to southern virginia from <br/>
North Carolina.  The local sca group is all a&s and has no fighters.  <br/>
I am trying to find anyone in the area to practice with.  I Have been <br/>
playing a Japenese persona for around 5 years now.  I love it and <br/>
enjoy the art of heavy combat.  Hope to meet some of you on the list <br/>
field.<br/>
