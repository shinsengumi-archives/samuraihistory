I was wondering what system do you all use to measure your blades, seeing as <br/>
no-one really wants to use shaku and Japans secondary unit is CMs. I believe <br/>
that you are doggedly keeping the feet and inches part of imperialism (as <br/>
well as gallons), is this still the case when it comes to Japanese swords, <br/>
or do you make the exception in this case and use the metric system?<br/>
