<h3>Divorce in Japan at the XVI. century</h3>
by <i>Dr. Sófi Gyula</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-593151123">Dear friends,<br/>
<br/>
if somebody have informations (and sources!) on how divorce could occur in<br/>
Japan, at the XVI. century, please write me details.<br/>
<br/>
Other thing what would be very interesting to me is concerning on STD-s<br/>
(sexually transmitted deseases). Is there any information on whether the<br/>
Europeans spread to Japanese p.e. the syphylis and other STD-s, after ther<br/>
Black Ship arrived at the west coast of Japan?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for every cooperation you will do for helping my research work!<br/>

Yes, wives were moved from one husband to another depending on who the Daimyo was trying to make alliances with.  Marriage was a political tool.</div>

<br/>
That's a common misconception.  It was believed to come from the New<br/>
World at one point but they've found signs of syphilis on bones from<br/>
13th century Europe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074478018">Its a pretty safe bet that Europeans brought venereal disease among the plethora of other<br/>
diseases they took throughout the world. From what I can see the japanese are extremely diligent in their clealiness.<br/>
Albeit Typhoid malaria and the like would be hard to keep at bay.<br/>
 <br/>
However here in Australia disease and germ warfare common, the British practiced it in north America. They learnt it from the Romans who would dip their arrow heads in dirt or some other unpleasant mix so if the arrow failed to do the job the bacteria could have a second go.<br/>
