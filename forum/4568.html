<h3>A German Samurai??</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155947496">Just thought you guys would enjoy this, reported by Reuters Oddly <br/>
Enough today. I know it's not technically samurai history, but it's a <br/>
great illustration of how the term 'samurai' is being bandied about <br/>
nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
BERLIN (Reuters) - A camouflage-clad German man wielding a samurai <br/>
sword attacked at least seven hikers in forests west of Berlin, <br/>
performing sword tricks before ordering them to leave the woods, <br/>
police said Friday. <br/>
They suspect a 46-year-old local man who trained in martial arts and <br/>
survival skills in camps in Papua New Guinea and Vietnam to be the <br/>
attacker. <br/>
<br/>
"He's dangerous and has been hard to find because he wears <br/>
camouflage," said Catrin Feistauer, spokeswoman for the Nauen police <br/>
department. Police have used infrared cameras mounted on helicopters <br/>
to try and track him down. <br/>
<br/>
The man pushed two elderly people off their bikes and, flashing his <br/>
sword, shouted at them to leave the forest. He later tried to drive a <br/>
young couple out of the woods. No one was seriously hurt. <br/>
<br/>
"It's frightening because the violence level has increased each <br/>
time," Feistauer said.</div>
