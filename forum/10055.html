 <br/>
First, I must say that despite having lived for almost 5 years in Japan and <br/>
 having read what seemed at the time like a great deal about Japanese <br/>
history and  the samurai legacy, I feel rather like a rank novice compared to the <br/>
depth of  information I've found here -- so forgive me if I sound niave.  <br/>
 <br/>
My principle interest in samurai history is as a jumping-off point for  fi<br/>
ction, so my interests are roughly 50% history, 50% mythology and  folklore.  <br/>
Which overlong self-introduction brings me to this  question: I gather that <br/>
the name Rokuro Kubi translates as "Six (ro)  neck" -- which suggests to me <br/>
that a "ro" is a unit of length.  But  numerous sources (including good ol' <br/>
Google) have NOT led me to any definition  of how long a "ro" might be.  <br/>
 <br/>
Any help?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508822759">Actually, "roku" translate as "six." I believe that the "ro" after "Rokuro" is simply a masculine suffix to "roku" (six). However, the actual meaning would depend upon the kanji and hiragana used to form the name. I know a bit of spoken Japanese but am quite illiterate in written Japanese. Your best bet would be to have someone who is literate in Japanese kanji/hiragana to look at the written name. <br/>

So it comes out sounding like roku roku bi rather than just roku kubi  <br/>

Well, it all depends on the length of the oars -- the longer the oar,  <br/>
the farther the ro.<br/>

Good point.  I sometimes forget how much the Japanese love puns and  <br/>

In fact, I consulted a number of dictionaries, but apparently the meaning  <br/>
of "rokuro" was considered too obscure, and for the life of me I couldn't <br/>
find  the name written in kanji, only in hiragana or romaji, neither of which  <br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Rokuro Kubi</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150559087">One of my favorite sources for yokai question such as these is: "Yokai World"Its in Japanese, so you can usually find the kanji involved. Its listed "alphabetically," in the left column, by order of beginning phonetic sounds so its in the second-to-last group under "ra" (listed in romaji as "I" for some reason...). Alas, here the "rokuro" portion is written in hiragana. (BTW, for those with limited[...] or no Japanese reading ability, having google "translate" this page can be both moderately helpful AND amusing.)Next stop, Kanji DB.Here the only kanji combo with actual meaning is indeed (as Tony pointed out): 轆轆, "potter's wheel;" but also "pulley," which I think seems a little more likely for this particular critter.The Obakemono Project lists rokurokubi with the hiragana just like at Yokai World. However, you'll notice the English subtitle under the name is indeed "pulley neck."The last of my at-hand resources is the "book" "Yokai Attack: The Japanese Monster Survival Guide" by Hiroko Yoda and Matt Alt (a fruitful and amusing source for this subject). Here she is indeed listed as: &#36678;&#36678;&#39318;, "pulley (or perhaps "potter's wheel"...) neck." They include a list of English versions of the name such as: "Long-neck Woman," "Snake-necked Woman," "Flying-head Woman," and "Rubberneck Woman." They also interject that "Some scholars believe: that the Rokuro Kubi is related to the Japanese idiom 'kubi wo nagakushite matsu.' Although it colloquially means 'eagerly waiting for something,' the literal translation is 'stretching one's neck out to wait.'"<br/>
One last personal, and doubtful, theory I just formulated upon reviewing the links provided is this: on the link to Kanji DB provided, the third listing you'll notice is &#20845;&#21570;&#24107;. I'm not sure why, but they don't include the "shi" sound for the final kanji (some more proficient at the language may be able to explain), but I find the combination of the first two characters interesting: "roku" (six) and "ro" (spine). Could this 呂 be what there are six of and essentially the unit of length you were inquiring about? So it'd be &#20845;&#21570;&#39318;: "Six-Spine-Neck?"Probably not, but it's fun research anyway. (BTW, as I typed the hiragana into my Japanese IME program, the only meaningful selection I have available for rokurokubi IS in fact &#12429;&#12367;&#12429;&#39318;, so this is likely the common contemporary writing, though it still could be derived from something more specific.)<br/>
Sorry for the lengthy post, but I though I'd include several of the resources I use in such situations for your (and those with similar interests) future reference.It's also worth noting the forums at the Obakemono Project, though often tangental, CAN be resourceful as well. (As if this isn't tangental to samurai history...)I prefer the SA!... :P 		 	   		  <br/>

kanji used are shown in Joly's "Legend in Japanese Art" under his entry for<br/>
Rokurokubi:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/7Kj6QG">http://bit.ly/7Kj6QG</a><br/>
<br/>
The link is to the scanned copy at archive.org, which is the 1908 edition,<br/>
on p. 291. It's on p. 433 of the reprint editions by Tuttle. Joly<br/>
categorizes Rokurokubi, "long-necked goblin," as Bakemono, or "transformed<br/>
things," which include all manner of ghosts, goblins, etc., which he covered<br/>
more fully in a paper presented to the Japan Society, printed in the<br/>
Transactions, Vol. IX.<br/>

Joly categorizes Rokurokubi, "long-necked goblin," as Bakemono, or "transformed things," which include all manner of ghosts, goblins, etc., which he covered more fully in a paper presented to the Japan Society in 1909, printed in the Transactions, Vol. IX.<br/>

Actually, it turns out this "roku" has nothing to do with six at all. The<br/>
kanji used are shown in Joly's "Legend in Japanese Art" under his entry for<br/>
