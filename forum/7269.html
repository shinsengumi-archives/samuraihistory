While Richard Cohen's By the Sword isn't directly related to the <br/>
topic of military history, it does provide the reader with a rare <br/>
and fascinating glimpse into the development of the sword, a weapon <br/>
that played a pivotal role in warfare for at least three millennia. <br/>
<br/>
A former Olympic fencer himself, the author starts off by telling us <br/>
that it was the ancient Assyrian king, Nimus, who first made fencing <br/>
into a formal sport and hired fencing masters to teach his troops <br/>
swordsmanship. Cohen then tells the reader that the classical <br/>
Greeks, for all their record of military success against the <br/>
Persians and in producing brutally efficient soldiers like the <br/>
Spartans, looked down on the art of swordplay. They admired skill <br/>
with the javelin more than the sword, feeling that it was a weapon <br/>
of last resort only. <br/>
<br/>
Cohen devotes an entire chapter to the art of sword-making. He tells <br/>
the secret of the Damascus steel, used to make some of the most <br/>
highly prized swords of the Middle Ages. The city's famous sword <br/>
smiths would use special steel ingots imported from India that were <br/>
a mixture of low-carbon and high-carbon iron alloys that gave <br/>
Damascus blades the combination of strength and flexibility that <br/>
made them so highly valued in their time. Each culture would have <br/>
its own unique way of testing the sharpness of a newly forged sword. <br/>
Arab smiths would place a new blade point down in a stream to see if <br/>
it could cut a drifting leaf. The Japanese used what had to be the <br/>
most gruesome method of all to test a blade's quality: one medieval <br/>
Japanese sword smith certified his blades through the use of the <br/>
iai, a special upward thrust that involved chopping a condemned <br/>
criminal in two by slicing him from hip to shoulder. <br/>
<br/>
One of book's charms is that Cohen populates it with interesting <br/>
characters. We learn that d'Artagnan, the famous hero of Alexandre <br/>
Dumas's The Three Musketeers, actually existed. Born in 1615, the <br/>
French swordsman led a life just as adventurous as the one described <br/>
in Dumas's novel, including service as a secret agent for Cardinal <br/>
Mazarin, the successor to the fictional d'Artagnan's nemesis, the <br/>
real-life Cardinal Richelieu. <br/>
<br/>
One truly strange personality was the 18th century French swordsman, <br/>
the Chevalier d'Eon. The best fencer of his day, the Chevalier was <br/>
also Europe's most notorious transvestite. In 1787, when he was 59, <br/>
he participated in a duel in London witnessed by the Prince of Wales <br/>
and other members of English high society; Dressed like a <br/>
grandmother, and nearly 20 years older than his opponent, d'Eon <br/>
still won the match, outscoring his adversary by seven hits to one. <br/>
<br/>
As the stories of d'Artagnan and the Chevalier d'Eon show, it is the <br/>
idea of the duel that ties Cohen's book together. Long after the <br/>
sword began to lose its military utility, the ability to use a blade <br/>
remained a mark of character and skill. Otto von Bismarck, Germany's <br/>
Iron Chancellor, was a duelist during his student days. Even Karl <br/>
Marx learned to fence. In pre-Civil War New Orleans there was a <br/>
dueling ground called "The Dueling Oaks" where at one point up to a <br/>
dozen duels were held every week. <br/>
<br/>
And sometimes the art of the sword was an aid to the imagination. <br/>
The duels in Alexandre Dumas's books were more than just the <br/>
products of a vivid imagination. T he French novelist took fencing <br/>
lessons three times a week. The tradition of using swordplay to <br/>
settle matters of honor survived throughout the 20th century. Duels <br/>
were being held in Italy as late as the 1920s. Even modern Germany, <br/>
the land of Siemens and BMW, still quietly maintains the custom of <br/>
the duel. Cohen notes that between 1500 and 2000 non-lethal duels <br/>
are still fought in Germany and Austria every year. And though it's <br/>
never mentioned in their quarterly reports, some German companies <br/>
require a dueling background if a person wants to become a senior <br/>
executive. Settling affairs by the sword seems to fulfill a primal <br/>
need for personal combat in some very modern people. <br/>
<br/>
It's when By the Sword discusses fencing as an Olympic sport that it <br/>
is at its weakest. The last few chapters of the book turn into a <br/>
litany of famousto a fencer at leastfencing masters and Olympic <br/>
duels that are of only mild interest to a non-fencer. But even here, <br/>
Cohen makes things lively by dropping in an interesting character or <br/>
two, including the beautiful Helene Mayer, a German Jew who competed <br/>
for the Nazis at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. <br/>
<br/>
Overall, By the Sword is a gold mine of information about a world <br/>
that has generally only been available to the public through the <br/>
lens of a movie camera. It's the only book you're ever going to need <br/>
about the history of the sword. Unless you plan to take up <br/>
swashbuckling, of course. <br/>
