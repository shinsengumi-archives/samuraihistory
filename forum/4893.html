<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862867670">Hi<br/>
I've just signed up otday for this group but I haven't been able to check <br/>
the archived messages because I don't have a yahoo account (or so it seems) <br/>
so I thought I'd check here before I posted a large-ish message. A few years <br/>
ago I did some (very basic) undergrad research into the martial roles of <br/>
women durring the emergence of the samurai as a dominant class. Characters <br/>
people might recognise include Tomoe Gozen and Masako Hojo, although my work <br/>
gives a little more detail then is generally published on these women and <br/>
looks and several others. If this is appropriate content for this group and <br/>
anyone is interested in a read, I'll post it.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funnily enough, the role of the female was the subject of discussion <br/>
here a few weeks ago. Although this is earlier than the period I am <br/>
most curious about (sengoku), I personally would love to read what <br/>
you've pulled together in your reseach.<br/>
