<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you imbue your sword with some kind of mystic<br/>
dogma?<br/>
	Hmm.  Well, that's not at all the way I'd describe it, Nate, but I have a<br/>
sneaking suspicion that you would regard my answer to that question as a<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
Do you believe that once drawn a sword has to<br/>
be used, or it will implode?<br/>
	Heh.  I've met a couple of guys like that.  "Sure you can see my sword:"<br/>
(here you get the benefit of the best Dark Smouldering Glance he can<br/>
manage:)  "but it must taste blood before it is sheathed again..."   Good<br/>
manners only require you to get out of earshot before you start laughing.<br/>
No, unless the person is known to come out of an unbroken cultural tradition<br/>
(and I think the Ghurkas are the about only ones this still applies to<br/>
today... and at that, I'm not sure the oral tradition is true regarding them<br/>
either), then I've found this view to be one of the surest signs of an ego<br/>
on legs rather than a martial artist.  Almost without exception, there's a<br/>
lot less skill than mouth wearing that blade.<br/>
...Sure, my swords let me know if they haven't been used in too long, but<br/>
it's not as if they have to be used _on_ somebody.  What _is_ the proper use<br/>
of a sword, indeed?  The Heiho Kaden Sho of the Yagyu discusses the idea of<br/>
the "Life-Giving Sword" - and I think Munenori (wasn't it he?) was working<br/>
toward an idea that is still worth developing today.  If the sword is<br/>
important still - and I am not alone in a profound conviction that it is -<br/>
then it's important that the idea of using a sword should continue to<br/>
evolve.  This is the line of thinking that has led to every "michi" (or<br/>
"do") approach growing out of the old "jutsu" forms of the Japanese weapon<br/>
arts.  Yes, a good sword should be used.  It's an insult to the sword not to<br/>
do so.  But the best use of the sword is not - with blessed few exceptions -<br/>
to cut down a life.  That, as the Yagyu book suggests, ought properly to be<br/>
reserved for those times when one person's evil has come to a peak.  And<br/>
modern law generally puts it in rather similar, if less poetic, terms.<br/>
Do you really think that<br/>
piece of steel is your soul?<br/>
	Mine?  No, my soul is complicated enough without having to incorporate a<br/>
dozen or so good pieces of steel.  A decent sword tends to develop its own<br/>
soul, or something suspiciously like one, if used with respect.  It could be<br/>
something of an awakening process rather than development, I'm not honestly<br/>
sure.  I only know that I get a sense when someone's "home" in a blade, and<br/>
it leaves me with a very clear understanding of why the tradition might<br/>
arise of the sword being the soul of the bushi.<br/>
As long as you answered "no" to these, you're not a<br/>
freak.<br/>
	And your point would be...?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > How to handle this sense of wounded dignity in a<br/>

>       Gereg<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only if I get to choose weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I choose Main Battle Tank. Mine's an M1A2--yours?<br/>
	Y'know, I had a strong suspicion you were going to take this kind of<br/>
unsporting attitude.  Nah, I figure, we're on a Japanese history list, so<br/>
those Euro-centric, "I-challenge-so-you-choose" rules don't apply.  There's<br/>
only one weapon suited for a civilised disagreement between gentlemen:  the<br/>
sword.  It's the Mythically Correct solution.<br/>
	...Of course, if you're going to remind me that neither of us could in fact<br/>
be considered a gentleman under the very definitions I'm calling for (and it<br/>
would be just like you to do that), then I'll have no more telling response<br/>
than to run like hell (unless I can arrange to be closer to you than you are<br/>
to your M1A2 when our negotiations reach this unhappy stage).<br/>
	This is what I hated about the Boxer Rebellion, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The sword itself--not your practice of the art.<br/>
		Still have to stick with my answer, I'm afraid.  I think there's a spirit<br/>
in most swords - particularly well-made ones - and I think it becomes more<br/>
'awake' with love and use.  That's the impression that's grown on me over<br/>
the past thirty-some years of practise.  I will admit that it's an<br/>
interpretation of available phenomena that is open to argument, but that's<br/>
my view.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > ...Sure, my swords let me know if they haven't been<br/>
> used in too long, but<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*cocked eyebrow* Um, and HOW exactly do they do this?<br/>
	Until you've been guilt-tripped by a sword that feels neglected, you've<br/>
never been guilt-tripped.  "How" is a very reasonable, but somewhat<br/>
difficult, question to answer, as the most natural response falls into the<br/>
"If you have to ask, I can't explain it" category - a category that holds so<br/>
much specious crap in this world that I really hate to place another datum<br/>
into it.  Particularly one that I care about.  Let's just say - until I get<br/>
my brains back again as I kick this flu - that the spirit of the sword makes<br/>
it very clear to my own spirit that it hasn't been out dancing in too long.<br/>
Not, to be honest, that I believe that description will convince you:  but<br/>
there it is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >       And your point would be...?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You asked me what my criteria was. Or rather, you were<br/>
offended without knowing the criteria. So I gave it to<br/>
you.<br/>
	Well, truth to tell, I didn't get offended.  (Maybe I should use some of<br/>
those silly 'emoticons' after all... NAAAAH.)  That was my sense of humour,<br/>
such as it is, at work.  I regret that you took this aspect of what I had to<br/>
say even remotely seriously.  Swords have spirits?  Serious.  Offended?<br/>
Challenge you to a duel?  Joke.<br/>
<br/>

Use a sword if you wish. It's magical soul will<br/>
protect you from 120mm APFSDS-T, I'm sure.<br/>
	Nate - apostrophising the possessive "its"?  Tsk, tsk.  Now:  having struck<br/>
at you on the battleground of words, allow me to answer you more directly:<br/>
my swords' spirits I regard as no more "magical" than my own.  (As I recall,<br/>
the term 'kami' can technically be applied to anything possessing a spirit,<br/>
including humans and trees:  the idea here is not dissimilar.)  Please bear<br/>
in mind that while I have seen considerable magic in my life, I do not<br/>
believe in the supernatural.  I do, however, regard nature as a much bigger<br/>
box than human science has succeeded in enclosing... or ever will.<br/>
	As to protecting me from whatever ammo that is (isn't it?), I repeat my<br/>
complaint about the Boxer Rebellion. Likewise the Amerindians' Ghost Dance.<br/>
I tend to believe that the sheer fact of belief itself has a fair amount of<br/>
power, so that (and I'm oversimplifying grossly here) if a man with a sword<br/>
faces off with a man with a rifle, and they both believe in the power of<br/>
their weapons, the power of each belief tends to cancel out the belief of<br/>
the other, leaving the functional power of certain forces that do not rely<br/>
on belief... or have been believed in for long enough to have established<br/>
more of a foothold in reality...  I refer here to mundane matters like the<br/>
laws of physics, muzzle velocity and the kinetic energy inherent in a sharp<br/>
piece of steel swinging.<br/>
	There's an equation in there that I do not fancy.<br/>
	"Unsporting..."  Well, let's put that in perspective:  that is the<br/>
favourite cry of the losing sides in the technology wars throughout history,<br/>
is it not?  The French knights said it about the English longbowmen, the<br/>
longbowmen said it about harquebusiers (and so did the samurai, for that<br/>
matter)...  It's an ancient and well-worn excuse, and I think it's good for<br/>
another round or so yet.<br/>

	Um... truth to tell, within the utterly facetious scenario I was<br/>
envisioning, by positioning myself closer to your chosen weapon than you, I<br/>
had some hopes of preventing _you_ from starting the damned thing!  Knowing<br/>
nothing whatsoever about your hand-to-hand skills, I'd still rather take you<br/>
on with no weapons aside from our bodies... than let you get inside a tank.<br/>
Call it shallow and narrow-minded of me.<br/>

Nate - apostrophising the possessive "its"?  Tsk,<br/>

mistake? No. Do I consistently do this, to the point<br/>

No. You're starting to push my buttons, Gereg. <br/>

 Please bear<br/>

<br/>
Gereg, I think you're an otherwise intelligent human<br/>
being. I'll agree to disagree on this--but to me it<br/>
sounds just as bad as any of the morons who believe<br/>
Hagakure and garbage like that. <br/>
<br/>
A sword is a weapon; it can be a work of art. However,<br/>
it's not born, does not go through adolescence, learn<br/>
to drive, take dates to the prom, or have kids, age,<br/>
and die. IT'S NOT ALIVE. It's an object. It's a<br/>
physical entity, not a spiritual one. <br/>

  A little strong I'd say. Let's take a different approach. You pick up <br/>

standard issue M1911A1 will do the job, but it doesn't feel the same. For <br/>
the same reason I haven't bought a takeyumi at Asahi. Nothing there *spoke* <br/>
to me. As a craftsman, lots of things *speak* to me on some level. I expect <br/>
it's projection, like people ascribing human emotions to thier pets.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand *THIS* perfectly. I've got no problem<br/>
with *THIS*. You appreciate the weapon as a fine piece<br/>
of machinery, or as a superb instrument for putting<br/>
lead on target--agree completely. The M1 Main battle<br/>
tank is a BEAUTIFUL thing, and there's nothing quite<br/>
like the feel of launching 120mm downrange and nailing<br/>
a moving target centermass from 3 km away. <br/>
<br/>
The difference is that when you say something *speaks*<br/>
to you, you are using asterisks around the word. I<br/>
understand you don't literally mean it has a mouth and<br/>
words come out. I don't really thing Gereg means that,<br/>
quite, but with some people I wonder. And I find it<br/>
highly troubling. <br/>

If people can worship differntly then that means they can feel differntly about things right. Say for instance, you have something you love. You do have a love dont you? Be it your wife or your sword and what ever that love my be you probably look at it as more than just what it is.  My wife to me is more than just a woman, my GOD is more than just a spirit and my sword is more than just a piece of steel. GOD BLESS YOU ALL.<br/>

<br/>
Tom et al-<br/>
I found a few things I couldn't agree with here, I offer here my opinions <br/>
which grow from my own experience, as a counterpoint, and I hope you'll<br/>
take <br/>
them in the spirit offered;<br/>
<br/>
"I have often wondered whether the mystique - the mystery - of the<BR><br/>
sword stands in some way as a marker of man's removal, or distance, <BR><br/>
from that which the sword represents.<br/>
I don't think the sword carried quite as much 'spiritual<BR><br/>
significance' to the Sengoku and earlier samurai. Their approach was <BR><br/>
somewhat more pragmatic. The sword represents them, rather than <BR><br/>
they being symbolised by the sword."<br/>
<br/>
I think you'll find that in addition to being tough and pragmatic the <br/>
Sengoku warrior was also very superstitious. It was during this period that <br/>
we see the greatest number of carvings on sword blades and the majority of <br/>
these were religeous in nature. The sword in addition to being a weapon was <br/>
a talisman. At the time the signature, carvings, fittings and even temper-<br/>
line were seen to carry good or bad fortune. Not just the sword but his <br/>
armour as well often carried symbols of his belief in certain deities or <br/>
sects. Yes they stood in the line and saw for themselves the awesome power <br/>
of the sword and for that reason they fervently said their prayers and were <br/>
convinced a good sword was more than just good steel. The swords passed<br/>
down <br/>
to us today were preserved because they were of better make but also<br/>
because <br/>
they saved Great-Granpas rear on some long ago battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
 "The names of sword, as discussed,<BR><br/>
owe nothing to mystique, more to about how someone came into<BR><br/>
possession of the blade."<br/>
<br/>
The great swords of old were appreciated from the time of the first Shogun <br/>
and before. Onimaru Kunitsuna and Dojigiri Yasutsuna to name two, were<br/>
famed <br/>
for their cutting ability. The Hi no Moto cherished spear of Kuroda Bushi <br/>
fame proved it's worth in battle and recieved it's name and fame before the <br/>
"poofy" days of the Tokugawa. Yes there are the Matsui Go and Ikeda<br/>
Masamune <br/>
but also the Dragon-fly cutter and the Devil's Butcher knife!<br/>
<br/>
"Mystique - I don't think so - just the sepia-tinted voice of<br/>
ignorance, sentimentality and nostalgia."<br/>
<br/>
Again, I would point out that the famed swords which we know today, were <br/>
famous BEFORE the Tokugawa and recieved their names from the<br/>
battle-hardened <br/>
Sengoku samurai we like to hold-up as the ideal.<br/>
<br/>
"If one hand to examine the effect of the sword close up, I bet that<BR><br/>
goes some way to dispelling the mystique)<BR><br/>
<BR><br/>
In fact, I wonder whether 'mystique' occurs when one doesn't know<BR><br/>
enough about the object to appreciate it properly?"<br/>
<br/>
I would agree with this last bit especially as it concerns modern man<br/>
making <br/>
a show of naming his newly acquired "samurai sword." However it is a matter <br/>
of historical fact that Tokugawa Ieyasu (a very practical fellow by all <br/>
accounts) forbid anyone to carry a Muramasa blade in his presence because<br/>
he <br/>
was convinced that they were especially unlucky for members of his family.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: swords (was ...Eras)</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132393799">Ladies and Gentlemen<br/>
I have thought long and hard about commenting on this threat as it appears<br/>
that misunderstanding and ridicule may be the only rewards. However, I trust<br/>
that the following might be relevant.<br/>
<br/>
As a student of Japanese swords for many years and having handled and<br/>
closely studied thousands in this time, this is what I think.<br/>
<br/>
In the Shinto religion, many things are credited with having a spirit and<br/>
the sword is not an exception. However, this was then and now is now. When<br/>
one picks up a sword of great antiquity and of historical importance, a<br/>
sensitive and sympathetic person cannot help but be greatly impressed. The<br/>
sugata, texture of the steel and the activities in the hamon will convey the<br/>
beauty and grace of the sword if the viewer has the necessary expertise to<br/>
understand and appreciate it. It is possible in some cases to see and begin<br/>
to understand the spirit the maker has imbued in the sword and maybe his<br/>
character also. For instance, a sword from the often flamboyant Osaka Shinto<br/>
school quite obviously reflects the somewhat brash nature of that city at<br/>
the time. However, I think in many ways this is similar to seeing the<br/>
tortured emotions of Van Gogh in one of his paintings. But to attribute this<br/>
to a mystical force is probably ill-advised in this day and age. It<br/>
surprises me that martial arts people feel that a "sword is talking to them"<br/>
when this does not seem to be the case with those more familiar with swords<br/>
unless being able to learn when, and where it was made and maybe its<br/>
historical context by close scrutiny, may be considered as communication<br/>
with the sword. I have always considered that in Japanese sword study, kendo<br/>
(or Iai-do) is the practical side of the academic study of Japanese swords,<br/>
but that it is all kendo in the final analysis and both are equally<br/>
important and need to be undertaken together. In other words, kendo people<br/>
are missing a great deal by having no understanding of the Japanese sword<br/>
and the reverse also applies.<br/>
<br/>
We are taught to view swords calmly and in a relaxed and unexcited manner<br/>
whether we are looking at a National Treasure or a kazu-uichi-mono. In this<br/>
way we will see everything that the sword has to offer. It may not talk to<br/>
us, but the educated and informed viewer will know the sword intimately.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I've not bored you to death with the above and that it at least makes<br/>
a modicum of sense.<br/>
Regards<br/>
Clive Sinclaire<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with the above.  Arguing about spiritual <br/>
otherworldly forces and divine powers in this situation is <br/>
apparently tantamount to arguing about religion. Some believe, some <br/>
don't, and there is no way to prove it one way or the other.  I <br/>
think it is reasonable to say that a crafted sword is a work of art, <br/>
and many people attribute power and emotion to works of art - i.e. <br/>
Van Gogh's angst.  It is actually quite subjective.  One can "sense" <br/>
power in a sword - but that is very likely because of the symbolism <br/>
of the sword in both Japanese history and world history as well.  We <br/>
LOOK for it. Carl Jung talked about symbolism and the subconcious, <br/>
humans look for symbolism - objectively speaking a piece of sharp <br/>
metal should invoke nothing, but subjectively the sword is a symbol <br/>
of power, that can invoke various emotions and feelings.<br/>
I agree that swords are awe inspiring and have an aura about them <br/>
because of the history and symbolism, but I think it is reasonable <br/>
to say that a sword doesn't contain otherworldly spiritual energy.  <br/>
But again, arguing something like this is tantamount to arguing <br/>
religion, and will go nowhere.<br/>
So everyone can feel free to go back and forth on this, but I find <br/>
it doubtful that this will go anywhere too useful.</div>

That would appear to be the case, all right.  In some ways I wish it had<br/>
never come up, as I had no intention of parading my religious views here -<br/>
let alone any desire to feel I needed to defend them.  However:  please note<br/>
that from my point of view, and likewise from the Shinto perspective as I<br/>
understand it, there's nothing "otherworldly" about it.  It's a perfectly<br/>
natural part of this world.<br/>
<br/>
Some believe, some<br/>
don't, and there is no way to prove it one way or the other.  I<br/>
think it is reasonable to say that a crafted sword is a work of art,<br/>

metal should invoke nothing, but subjectively the sword is a symbol<br/>
of power, that can invoke various emotions and feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once described Jung as a Taoist mystic masquerading as a<br/>
psychoanalyst.  And I can't argue that I, reared on King Arthur, Beowulf and<br/>
the Greek myths from childhood as I was, do tend to look for the magical in<br/>
the everyday world.  But one can look at that two ways:  it could be said<br/>
that we see things like symbols of power because we look for them (with the<br/>
implication that they might not be there if we didn't project them there),<br/>
or on the other hand, it could be said that if we're trained to the correct<br/>
sensitivity, any of us can be capable of perceiving things that others, who<br/>
lack that training, may overlook.<br/>
No, it cannot be proven one way or the other.  And I profoundly doubt that<br/>
my experience is going to persuade anyone who has not shared some similar<br/>
experience.  (In fact, I think I'd be a little nervous about anyone whose<br/>
worldview was so easily shaped by others:  that sounds like raw material for<br/>
the nearest odd cult.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that swords are awe inspiring and have an aura about them<br/>
because of the history and symbolism, but I think it is reasonable<br/>
to say that a sword doesn't contain otherworldly spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
It is no more reasonable to deny that a sword might have a spirit than to<br/>
assert that it must.  Neither is ultimately a statement of reason at all.<br/>
Both are statements of faith in a particular paradigm, or worldview.  That<br/>
one of these views is more prevalent today does not make it right, any more<br/>
than the Church was right when it forced Galileo to recant his heretical<br/>
views about the earth revolving around the sun.  "Reasonable" ideas change<br/>
with every generation.  I dare say there isn't a one of us who embraces<br/>
every "reasonable" idea that our parents held:  let alone our grandparents.<br/>
Nor is it clear that every such change in cultural paradigms is for the<br/>
better:  that concept is part and parcel with the paradigm that holds that<br/>
progress moves us always onward to better and better things.  And if that<br/>
were so, then I imagine the quality of the air and water today would be<br/>
greatly improved since our great-grandparents' time...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But again, arguing something like this is tantamount to arguing<br/>
religion, and will go nowhere.<br/>
So everyone can feel free to go back and forth on this, but I find<br/>
it doubtful that this will go anywhere too useful.<br/>
<br/>
It may at least serve the useful purpose (as I see it) of keeping us all<br/>
from getting too confident that our worldviews are complete and absolute.<br/>
I've had to reconsider some of my views, and that's always a good thing, as<br/>
it keeps me from getting complacent; and it's possible I'm not the only one.<br/>
One can hope not, at any rate.<br/>
If I've waxed a little sharp on this subject - and under provocation, I<br/>
have - I hope you will all pardon me.  But please bear in mind that much of<br/>
the commentary I've seen on this subject has taken for granted that a number<br/>
of ideas related to my own religion are unquestionably and obviously false:<br/>
and I think most of us are liable to get a little touchy when we hear that<br/>
sort of thing.  After all, any religion (and any paradigm) can be made to<br/>
look ridiculous if one addresses the matter with certain assumptions firmly<br/>
in place.<br/>
        Blessings and good faring, all.<br/>
