<br/>
Stereotypes die hard, and none more so than outsiders' stereotypes of<br/>
Japan. Time and again, they are not so much reinvented as recycled,<br/>
using potent but often semi-mythical symbols from a potpourri of<br/>
favorite bygone eras. In the end, they tell us more about the<br/>
foreigners who have dredged them up than about anything genuinely<br/>
Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
As with the samurai, in whose image of stoic fearlessness many Western<br/>
men see a kind of quiet, macho ideal, the geisha is stood on a<br/>
pedestal as the acme of an artful and exquisite femininity. She is, in<br/>
this view, the embodiment of genteel, refined expression.<br/>
<br/>
This notion of the geisha has been rehashed in several works of<br/>
fiction and non-fiction in recent years, the most successful being<br/>
Arthur Golden's mega-bestseller, "Memoirs of a Geisha." The film<br/>
version of the novel, directed by Rob Marshall, opened on Dec. 10 in<br/>
Japan (under the title "Sayuri") and some two weeks later in the<br/>
United States. This coming week will see its release in Britain.<br/>
<br/>
"Memoirs of a Geisha" has been written up on these pages in an<br/>
excellently argued and incisive film review by Kaori Shoji ("Welcome<br/>
to Kyoto, California," Dec. 15, 2005). But this film as a phenomenon<br/>
of misunderstanding and misinformation bears further examination.<br/>
<br/>
As its Web site tells us, the movie is "set in a mysterious and exotic<br/>
world" of geisha houses before, during and immediately after World War<br/>
II. It is a fairytale take on what was at best a demeaning and<br/>
soul-destroying institution. Yet among the many popular<br/>
misrepresentations of Japanese reality since the country came out of<br/>
its international isolation 150 years ago -- from "Madame Butterfly"<br/>
to "The Last Samurai" -- this is one of the most blatantly pernicious.<br/>
<br/>
A chance encounter<br/>
In short, its storyline focuses on a determined and sympathetic little<br/>
girl named Chiyo (later Sayuri) who is sold by her destitute parents<br/>
into the okiyacho (red-light district). As a servant-girl she is<br/>
abused by the madam, as well as by the cruel geisha in the house. A<br/>
chance encounter on a bridge with a kindly entrepreneur, who gives<br/>
Chiyo his handkerchief, leads her on a lifelong pursuit to gain the<br/>
status necessary to approach this generous gentleman once again.<br/>
<br/>
Two key themes of prewar Japanese life are whitewashed in "Memoirs of<br/>
a Geisha."<br/>
<br/>
First, the entire system of recruiting young girls for work in the<br/>
okiyacho was one of institutionalized slavery. While it is true, as<br/>
the film points out on a number of occasions, that the elite among the<br/>
geisha were not prostitutes (though many, as the favorites of wealthy<br/>
patrons, were kept women), the institution lent an aura of cultural<br/>
legitimacy to the enslavement of hundreds of thousands of girls and<br/>
women who were forced into the sex trade in the major cities and<br/>
virtually every provincial town in arch-sexist traditional Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Sayuri's enemies are other women, who show only a sadistic<br/>
vindictiveness toward her. Even her patroness, Mameha, supports her<br/>
because a wealthy man has paid her to do so. The two male protagonists<br/>
are positive characters, depicted as tender, if sometimes gruff or<br/>
aloof, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a story set in United States in the pre-Civil War South in<br/>
which the slaves are portrayed as locked in internecine in-fighting as<br/>
one of them, the most innocent, longs to be rescued by a Prince<br/>
Charming in the guise of a noble white plantation owner. Would there<br/>
be anything mysterious and exotic about the everyday life of the<br/>
slaves? This is analogous to what "Memoirs of a Geisha," transposed to<br/>
20th-century Japan, is doing.<br/>
<br/>
The second issue arises from a gross omission. The generous<br/>
entrepreneur, known as The Chairman, is beholden to his<br/>
comrade-in-arms, Nobu. The latter's face has been disfigured in<br/>
battle. Nobu apparently saved The Chairman's life when they were<br/>
fighting for the Imperial cause in Manchuria. In fact "Memoirs of a<br/>
Geisha" skirts the issue of war responsibility entirely, save for a<br/>
few voice-over broadcasts of Hitler's progress through a distant Europe.<br/>
<br/>
A vicious military occupation<br/>
However, the Japanese military establishment was the major customer of<br/>
the okiyacho around Japan, and tens of thousands of women were forced<br/>
to be so-called comfort women by and for the Japanese military, having<br/>
to endure mass rape in Japan and its far-flung colonies for the glory<br/>
of the empire.<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in the film is there mention of the fact that the two<br/>
admirable gentlemen were getting rich thanks to a vicious military<br/>
occupation of continental Asia.<br/>
<br/>
After the war, most of the geisha, of every rank, were forced by the<br/>
Japanese police into the service of Allied Occupation soldiers. The<br/>
only thing that had changed was the color of the uniform flung hastily<br/>
onto the tatami.<br/>
<br/>
The reasons for Westerners choosing mystery over reality have varied<br/>
since Japan's abandonment of the policy of national isolation.<br/>
<br/>
In the Meiji Era (1868-1912), the West, for the most part, wanted to<br/>
keep Japan quaint, picturesque -- and on its knees. Virtually all<br/>
Westerners allied themselves with the most reactionary social<br/>
institutions and their propagators, seeing that as a sure way to<br/>
arrest Japan's entry into the West's exclusive club of the Great Powers.<br/>
<br/>
But what obliges film producers like Steven Spielberg to spin a sick<br/>
little tale like "Memoirs of a Geisha" now that Japan is in many<br/>
respects a full-fledged member of the Western club? Spielberg, who in<br/>
his movies generally deals with bizarre fantasies and heroic<br/>
historical figures, seems to have inadvertently mixed the two together<br/>
in this film.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the filmmakers' motive in recycling an antiquated<br/>
fabrication, there was nothing mysterious or exotic about the world of<br/>
the okiyacho to those who were chained to its walls. By producing this<br/>
visual and moral euphemism, its creators have not only prettified and<br/>
distorted what was a ruthless institution akin to the modern<br/>
trafficking of women; they have also raised yet another opaque screen<br/>
in front of what Japan once was -- and what it is today.<br/>
