<h3>Rousseau and Ryoma</h3>
by <i>William&Mikiko Letham</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685184898">Somebody was talking about whether Ryoma had read Rousseau or not. I just<br/>
came across something in George Uyeharas book 'The Political Development of<br/>
Japan', page 115  says that his book 'Social Contract was translated in<br/>
Japanese in 1882 by Nakai Tokusuke. However I think that some people in<br/>
Bakumatsu Japan were aware of his ideas from other sources.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156915205">Thanks Bill,<br/>
	Since there were French scholars in Japan at  the time and <br/>
interest in Western forms of goverrnment it is possible but I guess I <br/>
still need to fine it in the print which originally set to reading <br/>
the book so many years ago...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886499674">I don't  know if you will find that info in print. There were so many people<br/>
coming into Japan at that time as well as quite a few Japanese travelling<br/>
legally and illegally to America and Europe. Also Japan was fairly well<br/>
informed of outside events during the saikoku period thanks to the Dutch.<br/>
The Uyehara book was quite interesting discussing the different western<br/>
political theories debated in the Meiji period. George Sansoms Japan and the<br/>
Western World was quite good on this general topic as well</div>
