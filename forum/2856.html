<h3>Hello, New Member with a question</h3>
by <i>Ryan Cone</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-638538669">Hey guys, my name is Ryan, and I am not necessarily new, but I have not really participated in any mailing, I have just watched the posts. Well, I have a question about samurai tactics in battle. Did they ever fight in unison, or did they mostly fight on their own? Also, did they use a variety of weapons, polearms and the like? or were they mainly melee? Thanks guys<br/>
