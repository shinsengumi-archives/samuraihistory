<br/>
I found John Perry's website tip on snakes to be of great interest.  A friend of mine has a katana with the scabbard covered in a snakeskin.  A little damage lets one see that the wood underneath has been gilded giving a warm, yellowish glow ("underpainting", I guess in art terminology) to the skin.  The most amazing thing is that NO SEAM can be found anywhere in the skin, so how the artisans managed to cover the rounded end of the scabbard I'm blowed if I know.  It's a brilliant piece of workmanship.  Fascinating.<br/>

  This is a link to a web page I found about snakes in Japan and if you scroll<br/>
  down you will find a family <br/>
<br/>
  of poisonous snakes and a brief description of there geographic<br/>
  distribution.<br/>

  Sorry for my first post to be a bit off topic but I though it might be<br/>
  relevant to this current discussion.<br/>
<br/>
  Cheers,<br/>
