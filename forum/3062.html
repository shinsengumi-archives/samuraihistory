<div id="ygrps-yiv-957722015">Prof. Murphy, the rifles in the beginging of the movie were indeed the springfield, but they had not been converted yet as they were putting caps on the rifles to prime them. Thank you for the dates on the bolt action rifles, I knew they did not exist as early as the 1870's..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518551956">I read an article about an American knife and sword maker, who had been <br/>
trained by some of the best sword makers in Japan and he was able to make a Katana <br/>
that was able to cut a one inch steel cable.  The cable was suspended and <br/>
allowed to hang freely.  This was one of the tests he used to test some of his <br/>
blades.  So maybe it is possible to cut the barrel of a gun with a good downward <br/>
force swing of a Katana.  This is just something that I read and as of right <br/>
now I don't claim to be an expert on Samurai, but I am reading as much as I can <br/>
afford to buy.<br/>
