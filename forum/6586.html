My first sword was a paul chen, although not brilliant the quality is a lot better than the good awful things on ebay. You best bet <br/>
would be to save , your uk based so if clive picks this up he maybe able to help out. but like all good things you get what you pay <br/>
for. Personally buy a few books and learn what to look for in a good blade also check out the excellent sword display at the british <br/>
museum. To cap it off better to invest in some good books on the subject and save for a better blade that way you wont get ripped <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339026826">Ladies and Gentlemen<br/>
I am just picking up on this thread and wholly concur with Mr Helm regarding<br/>
the books. It seems to me that the urge to collect Japanese swords should be<br/>
curbed until a decent sword may be obtained. I think to collect anything,<br/>
you must buy the best quality you can with the money available. Therefore if<br/>
you only have £200-£300 you might be better advised to buy a reasonable<br/>
kogai or tsuba rather than a repro sword which really is not a Japanese<br/>
sword at all, only a pale facsimile. Early collectors are rather vulnerable<br/>
in this respect and should curb their enthusiasm until they can make<br/>
informed judgements. Now, although I am a lifetime collector of Japanese<br/>
swords, I know that the swords that I really would like to have, are way<br/>
beyond my reach unless a miracle involving the national lottery occurs and<br/>
probably even then, they are unobtainable. However, this by no means<br/>
prevents me seeing, handling, studying and appreciating these objects and<br/>
the need to possess them becomes less of an issue. As has been said many<br/>
times before, as the swords will outlast our lifetimes, we never really own<br/>
them and are simply caretakers for a certain time. Further, I would advise,<br/>
only look at good swords and do not waste your time on poor quality swords<br/>
such as Showa-to. Looking at poor quality swords will effect your judgement<br/>
in a negative way.<br/>
There is no short cut to learning about swords, even with the help of the<br/>
internet. The internet will provide vast amounts of information but this<br/>
will not give you knowledge. For instance, you may read that there is a<br/>
feature in swords by certain Rai school swordsmiths known as Nie-utsuri and<br/>
you will know this fact but until you see this on a sword, you will never<br/>
really know what Nie-usturi is or be able to recognise it.<br/>
Reading the above it sounds rather pompous and I don't mean it to be. Many<br/>
these days, influenced by films and other things, glimpse the fascination of<br/>
the Japanese sword but are not prepared for the long and hard study involved<br/>
in the subject. My concern is that they get their hands onto swords and<br/>
unintentionaly but through ignorance, impart ireperable damage on these<br/>
artistic and cultural icons. Ignorance is the greatest enemy of the Japanese<br/>
sword in the 21st centuruy.<br/>

        You are probably referring to  the kata "Sanchin", which is done <br/>
primarily by the Karate styles descending from  Naha-te. The breathing style used <br/>
during the performance of this kata has been  under debate for many years, <br/>
regarding it's health related issues, and the  early passing of some of those <br/>
practioners.<br/>

You are probably right, I know of this kata. It's a slow hard breathing and<br/>
muscled kata am I right? he may have been confused from this one instead of<br/>
Sochin kata, which I do believe is a 4th Dan kata in Shotokan Karate.<br/>

are you asking me how I know this kata? simple, I am a Sandan (3rd Dan) in<br/>
Shotokan Karate. there are 15 kata taught before Black and the rest are<br/>
taught after black. Actually I have most of them on Video tape. If I<br/>
remember rght Sochin is a 4th Dan Kata but I have most of them if not all. <br/>
But again I have not heard of health problems from this kata, not saying it<br/>
s never been true for some, but I haven't heard of it. has someone you know<br/>
been ill from it?<br/>

<h3>to Mr. Morgan</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812748036">Wow Fayetteville! it had to be a fellow North Carolinian to know what I ment. I did a little more reasearch just on last night and found that there is a deference between Sochin kata and Sanchin kata. I do only Sochin as to I was only trained in Japan. Dont think that would have any thing to do with it though. Thanks for your humble enlightenment and to all others that I have not gotten around to reading yet. Next thing though where is the Dojo in which you attend?. Fayetteville is not my fav city but I do not have a formal training home here in America. Well again thanks for all replys God Bless you<br/>
