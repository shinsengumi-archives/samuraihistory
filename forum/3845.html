<br/>
I think we could relate this situation to modern day politics.  The <br/>
Shogun held all of Japan's power (the Emperor had some minor powers <br/>
that were dictated by the Shogun), somewhat similar to the U.S. <br/>
President.  We could compare Samurai to politicians (unfair <br/>
comparison, I know) vying for the position of power.  Some <br/>
politician, let's say he/she's a Senator, could have an interesting <br/>
position.  In most situations, it is best for the Senator to be <br/>
aligned with and endorsed by the current president.  To be recognized <br/>
by a person of such power and authority is good for the political <br/>
future of the Senator.  If that same Senator were to run for office <br/>
against the current president, they would be rivals.  The Senator <br/>
would then attempt to seperate him/herself from the current <br/>
president.<br/>
<br/>
It would be in a samurai's benefit to be aligned with the Shogun.  <br/>
But if that samurai wanted to be Shogun (and I'm sure almost all of <br/>
them had that aspiration) then they would be rivals.  I think this <br/>
would be on an individual or perhaps sect basis but not the entire <br/>
class of Samurai againt the Shogun.  The Shogun was the top dog in <br/>
the Samurai class.  For this reason I'm sure there was jealousy and <br/>
hatred but he still belonged to that class.  At some point, a Shogun <br/>
realized how dangerous it was to be Shogun.  To reduce rivalry, the <br/>
practice of housing "family guests" (i.e. hostages) in the immediate <br/>
house of the Shogun was common.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I'm not an expert on the Meiji period but wasn't that when the <br/>
Samurai class was abolished.  The Shogun was overthrown first so <br/>
there would be no Shogun to disagree with.  The Emperor had the <br/>
disagreement with the Samurai and the Shogun, probably because his <br/>
office, although diefied, held no power for almost 1000 years.  Here, <br/>
the direct descendant of the Sun God saw an opportunity, with <br/>
technology and the weakness of the current Shogun; to take power back <br/>
and once again rule Japan.  According to "Japanese History, 11 <br/>
experts reflect on the past" a kodansha book, "The period commenced <br/>
with the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate... "</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-178637833">The only thing I could say is that during the meiji era the shougun didn't exist anymore.<br/>
In the past, I think, problems were between shougun and daimyou, not with the samurai...but here I probably am wrong.<br/>
