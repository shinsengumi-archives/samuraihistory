<h3>Samurai identity</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981654797">Was a samurai only classified by his sword, or could he be <br/>
considered a warrior in our modern world. Is what made a samurai not <br/>
the quality of his sword, but the state of his mind and soul in <br/>
everyday life. Sorry this question is so corny but i couldnt think of <br/>
any better way to type it. At first this doesnt sound like history but <br/>
i suppose it could be if you consider edo period samurai in the <br/>
question. Also i cant ask a question straightforward.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I'm not sure if I understand the question, but it seems to <br/>
smack of Hollywood myth backgrounds.<br/>

A samurai was a member of an elite social class. It was a <br/>
social CASTE. A sword was a weapon. NSome non-samurai had <br/>
swords, some samurai used weapons other than swords.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968078721">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
On the issue of swords. Pretty much all samurai had swords, but they  <br/>
frequently had something else as their primary weapon. Also, as Tony  <br/>
pointed out, before the sword hunts at the end of the sixteenth  <br/>
century, lots of peasants had swords. Further, before the end of the  <br/>
sixteenth century, the distinction between peasant and samurai could  <br/>
be a bit blurry as the "ji-samurai" engaged in farming.</div>
