<h3>Okay... Questions...</h3>
by <i>holydemon13</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567240150">Hey all...<br/>
       I've seen several dates mentioned, but there are things which still <br/>
puzzle me about this one topic... QUESTIONS: When was O-ichi given in marriage <br/>
to Shibata the FIRST time, when were they made to divorce and when was she made <br/>
to marry Asai?!  I've seen dates as early as 1557 for the first, and anywhere <br/>
from 1563 to 1567 for the second two... and how many kids did she give Asai?  <br/>
I've seen 3 daughters pretty consistently, but was it one son or two?  Thanks <br/>
in advance!  :-D  Take care, y'all...<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm fairly sure it was one--Manpukumaru. Dates, I<br/>
can't help you off the top of my head. <br/>
