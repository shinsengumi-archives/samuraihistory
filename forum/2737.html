<br/>
This year marks the 150th anniversary of Commodore Matthew<br/>
Perry's fabled "opening" of Japan. If you said, "Commodore<br/>
who?" you wouldn't be alone. Commodore Perry - Matthew<br/>
Calbraith Perry, to be exact - has faded from American<br/>
memory, even though every Japanese school child knows his<br/>
name. <br/>
<br/>
In 1853, Perry brought a fleet of four heavily armed "Black<br/>
Ships" into Edo Bay, near present-day Tokyo, and demanded,<br/>
in the name of President Millard Fillmore, that Japan open<br/>
its ports to American ships. Japan, which had been closed<br/>
to foreigners for more than two centuries, complied, and<br/>
Perry steamed home expecting a hero's welcome. <br/>
<br/>
He was disappointed, for Washington had more pressing<br/>
concerns than a tiny archipelago across the Pacific:<br/>
namely, the extension of slavery into the West and the<br/>
threatening noises about secession from Southern senators.<br/>
Perry decided he needed public relations help. He asked<br/>
Nathaniel Hawthorne, then United States consul in<br/>
Liverpool, England, if he might consider writing a book<br/>
about the opening of Japan, with Perry as hero. <br/>
<br/>
Hawthorne was tempted. As he wrote in his journal on Dec.<br/>
28, 1854, "It would be a very desirable labor for a young<br/>
literary man, or for that matter, an old one; for the world<br/>
can scarcely have in reserve a less hackneyed theme than<br/>
Japan." But Hawthorne had other books on his mind, and<br/>
suggested that Perry approach Herman Melville, who knew<br/>
something about the Pacific. Perry, stupidly, decided to<br/>
write the book himself, a wooden performance that did<br/>
nothing to enhance his reputation. <br/>
<br/>
Today, Perry's image still needs burnishing in his own<br/>
country. He has what you might call a Columbus problem: he<br/>
is seen as more an invader than an explorer. This is<br/>
unfair. Perry came in search of treaties, not territory.<br/>
However imperious his manner, his aims - at least with<br/>
regard to Japan - were not imperialist. Backed by his guns,<br/>
he opened Japanese ports to foreign goods and ideas; but he<br/>
also opened the way for Western understanding of Japan. <br/>
<br/>
It's worth remembering that the United States did not<br/>
occupy Japan. Instead, Japan took one look at Perry's<br/>
steamships and cannons and decided to modernize the country<br/>
- and quick. In the span of 50 years, Japan turned itself<br/>
into an industrial power, learning watch-making from the<br/>
Swiss and war-making from the Prussians, and won a place<br/>
among the world powers in the ghastly battles of the<br/>
Russo-Japanese War. <br/>
<br/>
Yet some Japanese questioned whether this was progress. In<br/>
"The Book of Tea," published in 1906, Kakuzo Okakura<br/>
observed that the average Westerner was accustomed "to<br/>
regard Japan as barbarous while she indulged in the gentle<br/>
arts of peace: he calls her civilized since she began to<br/>
commit wholesale slaughter on Manchurian battlefields." <br/>
<br/>
The truth is, though, that Perry didn't really open Japan.<br/>
He did the easy part: showing off American firepower to the<br/>
gaping samurai on shore, and forcing a trade agreement on<br/>
the emperor. But there was a second, slower, more<br/>
significant opening, which required actual understanding -<br/>
of Buddhism, for example, and the traditional arts of judo<br/>
and the tea ceremony. <br/>
<br/>
This cultural opening was the result of patient effort by<br/>
dedicated men and women who saw more in Japan than good<br/>
harbors and coal for whaling ships. They were people like<br/>
Edward Sylvester Morse, who traveled to Japan in 1877 to<br/>
teach Darwin's theory of evolution to the Japanese and<br/>
ended up as the world's authority on Japanese ceramics, or<br/>
his younger contemporary, Ernest Fenollosa, who taught<br/>
Emerson and Hegel at Tokyo Imperial University before<br/>
falling in love with Buddhist painting and sculpture. <br/>
<br/>
This sort of opening is as much an internal process as an<br/>
external one. People talk about the Japanese influence on<br/>
America; you might call this the "particle theory" of<br/>
cultural exchange. But what we see in the 150 years of<br/>
Japanese-American interaction is something more complicated<br/>
and harder to name. Maybe we need a "wave theory" of<br/>
cultural exchange, to explain the constant oscillation<br/>
between East and West. <br/>
<br/>
That oscillation continues today, in movies like "Lost in<br/>
Translation" and "The Last Samurai." Both movies take as<br/>
their heroes broken-down Americans, hired by the Japanese,<br/>
who find unexpected regeneration in opening themselves to<br/>
Japan. In "The Last Samurai," Nathan Algren, the<br/>
hollowed-out Civil War veteran played by Tom Cruise, comes<br/>
to Japan to modernize its army. He is typical of those<br/>
oscillating 19th-century Americans who found that Old Japan<br/>
had more to teach them than they could offer in return.<br/>
Like his samurai sword, inscribed "I belong to the warrior<br/>
in whom the old ways have joined the new," Algren forges<br/>
himself into an alloy of East and West. <br/>
<br/>
Not long ago we learned that Bob Dylan, in his album "Love<br/>
and Theft," had taken some lines from a Japanese book<br/>
called "Confessions of a Yakuza," by Junichi Saga. These<br/>
similarities gave rise to some understandable hand-wringing<br/>
about plagiarism and cultural appropriation. But Bob Dylan<br/>
is just another example of the great wave of<br/>
Japanese-American cultural oscillation. This is Bob Dylan,<br/>
for crying out loud, the guy who was born Robert Zimmerman<br/>
in Minnesota, adopted as his last name the first name of a<br/>
Welsh poet, and modeled himself on Woody Guthrie. <br/>
<br/>
Could it be that his saga, not to mention the flurry of<br/>
movies about Japan and self-discovery, are signs that<br/>
finally, 150 years after Perry cracked open the door to<br/>
Japan and sailed away, the real opening has taken place? <br/>
