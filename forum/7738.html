<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495705141">Maybe we could get into a discussion of what constitutes the "best" samurai,<br/>
or even what constitutes a "good" samurai? There would be plenty of argument<br/>
here over the issue of what makes a "good" samurai. Is it skill in weaponry?<br/>
Is it courage? Is it loyalty? Is it general character? <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] hitokiri kawakami gensai?</h3>
by <i>federicotrejos</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009871127">Good afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
This what I find about him, hope this will help you.<br/>
And also, you can find more info about other swordsman<br/>
as well. <br/>
I took the information from this webpage :<br/>
www.sword.ne.jp, so please be patient whit the english<br/>
traslation from the guy who made it.<br/>
<br/>
Here it goes :<br/>
<br/>
  Kawakami Genjiro ( 1834- 1871 )<br/>
  <br/>
 Komori Genjiro, he changed his name into Kawakami<br/>
Gensai(Hitokiri-Gensai). He changed his name further<br/>
into Takada Genbe. <br/>
<br/>
He was short, his jaw and cheekbone was sharp. He was<br/>
always calm and he was unyielding. And, he was very<br/>
gentle.<br/>
<br/>
Though He was born in Komori Family in Kumamoto, he<br/>
became a foster-child of Kawakami Family, and became a<br/>
Buddhist priest. (When there was a big earthquake and<br/>
all people were running away, he extinguished the fire<br/>
of a brazier, and he was accepted by many people. It<br/>
was said that it was regrettable that He's a Buddhist.<br/>
Buddhist priest's position was convenient to study.<br/>
Then, a study of the soldier was learned by Miyabe<br/>
Teizo, and literature and swordsmanship were learned<br/>
by Todoroki Muhe. He didn't get the permission of his<br/>
clan though he tried to do overseas inspection to know<br/>
the circumstance of foreign countries. If a foreign<br/>
circumstance can't be known, he thought that he should<br/>
exile a foreigner from Japan, and he recommended the<br/>
thought of "Sonno-jyoi(Reverence for the Emperor and<br/>
expulsion of the foreigner)". Then, he fought to<br/>
overthrow the shogunate together with "shishi of<br/>
kinno" which his mind was suitable for. Though he<br/>
killed many people, a clear record about his<br/>
assassination does not exist. (The incident that a<br/>
Sakuma Syouzan was assassinated at midday is famous.)<br/>
Then, many battles were finished, and He succeeded in<br/>
overthrowing the shogunate admirably. However, he<br/>
became bothering existence for new government because<br/>
his thought wasn't changed after the Restoration.(The<br/>
government completely changed a policy suddenly.)<br/>
Then, he was killed by the follower of "Kido<br/>
Takayoshi" who was gensai's company. At this time, he<br/>
didn't have the crime which was worth the death<br/>
penalty. <br/>
<br/>
 Best regards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

by <i>ahelly69</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854090676">I found this in internet, if you need translation let me know:<br/>
<br/>
Kawakami Gensai (1834 - 1871)<br/>
<br/>
Komori Genjiro, he changed his name into Kawakami Gensai(Hitokiri-<br/>
Gensai). He changed his name further into Takada Genbe. <br/>
<br/>
He was short, his jaw and cheekbone was sharp. He was always calm <br/>
and he was unyielding. And, he was very gentle.<br/>
<br/>
Though He was born in Komori Family in Kumamoto, he became a foster-<br/>
child of Kawakami Family, and became a Buddhist priest. (When there <br/>
was a big earthquake and all people were running away, he <br/>
extinguished the fire of a brazier, and he was accepted by many <br/>
people. It was said that it was regrettable that He's a Buddhist. <br/>
Buddhist priest's position was convenient to study. Then, a study of <br/>
the soldier was learned by Miyabe Teizo, and literature and <br/>
swordsmanship were learned by Todoroki Muhe. He didn't get the <br/>
permission of his clan though he tried to do overseas inspection to <br/>
know the circumstance of foreign countries. If a foreign <br/>
circumstance can't be known, he thought that he should exile a <br/>
foreigner from Japan, and he recommended the thought of "Sonno-jyoi<br/>
(Reverence for the Emperor and expulsion of the foreigner)". Then, <br/>
he fought to overthrow the shogunate together with "shishi of kinno" <br/>
which his mind was suitable for. Though he killed many people, a <br/>
clear record about his assassination does not exist. (The incident <br/>
that a Sakuma Syouzan was assassinated at midday is famous.) Then, <br/>
many battles were finished, and He succeeded in overthrowing the <br/>
shogunate admirably. However, he became bothering existence for new <br/>
government because his thought wasn't changed after the Restoration.<br/>
(The government completely changed a policy suddenly.) Then, he was <br/>
killed by the follower of "Kido Takayoshi" who was gensai's company. <br/>
At this time, he didn't have the crime which was worth the death <br/>
penalty.<br/>

The Furanui style of Kenjutsu he was supposed to have been a master of would have given him some claim to fame but his opposition to the Tokugawa Shogunate and the way he was murdered on manufactured charges certainly gave him the status of an honored martyr.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285485095">It is a matter of opinion you are asking.  Most people who know of/have heard of Kawakami Gensai the most well known of the hitori, believe him a fictional character made up by someone with an imagination (and a very good one at that).  But then there are the exeptional few who believe he is a true person in our history that helped bring the knew era.  The only thing about this person is that there is very few facts that says he was a real person or not.  so its up to you to decide in your own mind was this person real or fictional.  My own believes are that this person helped bring the age of the new era,  That he was the best japanese swordsman that there was,  and most importantly I blieve that he is a Real historical character/a real Person that was there to experiance the      shed of Japans battlefields.<br/>

---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Aaaah, don't get me started on "bushido." I may raise a few hackles with the<br/>
following, but one of my pet, pet peeves is someone quoting from "Hagakure"<br/>
by Yamamoto Tsunetomo as if this were THE definitive manual on "bushido." I<br/>
keep hearing people quote from this work, especially the famous line, "the<br/>
way of the samurai is facing death."<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, Yamamoto wrote this treatise as a private correspondence<br/>
to members of his clan. It never was intended to be read by the general<br/>
public in feudal Japan, much less by people all over the world in many<br/>
languages.<br/>
<br/>
But more importantly, in my humble(?) opinion, Yamamoto had never been in a<br/>
battle and thus knew nothing first-hand about facing death. He lived in a<br/>
peaceful castle during the 18th centurey, some of the most peaceful times in<br/>
Japanese history. It's not that difficult to write stuff about how a samurai<br/>
should face death when ensconced in a place where facing death doesn't come<br/>
into the equation of one's existence at all.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to know about facing death, read some of the accounts by the<br/>
47 Asano retainers who avenged their lord (whom Yamamoto had the temerity to<br/>
criticize from his own relatively comfortable spot). Or else read any<br/>
account from any common battlefield soldier in history, one from Japan or<br/>
from any other country.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303223391">What is Bushido? You might as well ask me to explain Zen to a two year old.  <br/>
I know it's the soul and character of Japan and the reason for why it <br/>
fascinates  me to no end. It's a sense of indentity to a country, a sense of duty, <br/>
honor,  and love of country. To explain Bushido, explain Zen. These are my own <br/>
rambling  thoughts that may or may not answer the question. But I do believe <br/>
that Bushido,  Soul of Japan, is the core to understand a Sumurai and what he is <br/>
or believes. A  good book on the subject is "Bushido; Soul of Japan," By Inazo <br/>
Nitobe. Also  worth reading, "Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai." By Yamamoto <br/>

I don´t think so, he was just a executor. <br/>
<br/>
There were several good warriors in Japan, for example Miyamoto Musashi,<br/>
Tsukahara Bokuden, Toshitsugu Takamatsu, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don´t think someone in special was the "best in the world". <br/>

<h3>What can we define as the best samurai ???</h3>
by <i>federicotrejos</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051720954">Good afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Have anyone seen the last movie written by Akira<br/>
Kurosawa : "Ame Agaru" ( After the Rain )???   The<br/>
best samurai I ever seen is the one reflected on that<br/>
movie, although the movie is fictional.   It is<br/>
imposible not to fall in love with that carachter.<br/>
His mood, the way he behaves, what he does for<br/>
others... even when he is in Sanchin ( martial<br/>
attitude ).   I think he covers all the aspects of<br/>
been a samurai and yet reflect a human side.<br/>
That´s a very interesting movie, I recomend it to all<br/>
of you who have not seen it.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards to all.<br/>

I disagree. I think the Bushido (I did read Hagakure too) are specifical rules accord the Honor Code,  is true that the Honor and Loyalty are abstract elements in the people, were actitudes too in the Samurai class but the Bushido was more especifical (No kill without necessity, not arson, not kidnapping, etc).<br/>

What is Bushido? You might as well ask me to explain Zen to a two year old.  <br/>
I know it's the soul and character of Japan and the reason for why it <br/>
fascinates  me to no end. It's a sense of indentity to a country, a sense of duty, <br/>
honor,  and love of country. To explain Bushido, explain Zen. These are my own <br/>
rambling  thoughts that may or may not answer the question. But I do believe <br/>
that Bushido,  Soul of Japan, is the core to understand a Sumurai and what he is <br/>
or believes. A  good book on the subject is "Bushido; Soul of Japan," By Inazo <br/>
Nitobe. Also  worth reading, "Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai." By Yamamoto <br/>
Tsunetomo.<br/>

Aaaah, don't get me started on "bushido." I may raise a few hackles with the<br/>
following, but one of my pet, pet peeves is someone quoting from "Hagakure"<br/>
by Yamamoto Tsunetomo as if this were THE definitive manual on "bushido." I<br/>
keep hearing people quote from this work, especially the famous line, "the<br/>
way of the samurai is facing death."<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, Yamamoto wrote this treatise as a private correspondence<br/>
to members of his clan. It never was intended to be read by the general<br/>
public in feudal Japan, much less by people all over the world in many<br/>
languages.<br/>
<br/>
But more importantly, in my humble(?) opinion, Yamamoto had never been in a<br/>
battle and thus knew nothing first-hand about facing death. He lived in a<br/>
peaceful castle during the 18th centurey, some of the most peaceful times in<br/>
Japanese history. It's not that difficult to write stuff about how a samurai<br/>
should face death when ensconced in a place where facing death doesn't come<br/>
into the equation of one's existence at all.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to know about facing death, read some of the accounts by the<br/>
47 Asano retainers who avenged their lord (whom Yamamoto had the temerity to<br/>
criticize from his own relatively comfortable spot). Or else read any<br/>
account from any common battlefield soldier in history, one from Japan or<br/>
from any other country.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love this movie, but the main character only<br/>
reflects what a western view of a samurai should be.<br/>
<br/>
As for Bushido, like Chivalry of European warriors, it<br/>
was something talked about and practiced by young and<br/>
peace time samurai and probably joked about by older<br/>
samurai.<br/>
<br/>
The 47 Ronin sacrificed their honor and reputations to<br/>
give themselves the opportunity to avenge their<br/>
Master.  Then instead of taking matters into their own<br/>
hands, they allowed judgment to be passed on them and<br/>
as ronin they could not have HOPED to be allowed to<br/>
commit seppuku.  They must have expected to be<br/>
executed (ronin do not have the right to seppuku) and<br/>
they must have been grateful for the privilege of<br/>
seppuku.<br/>

mention that there was no "bushido" until the Edo period, although <br/>
before then various Samurai lords had plenty of rules that were to be <br/>
followed, and it could be argued that they were Bushido-ish.</div>

In some ways, yes. But facing death from a comfortable castle  -- which is<br/>
where Yamamoto was situated when he wrote "Hagakure" is not the same as<br/>
facing death under direct attack, such as in a battle against an enemy who<br/>
is using swords, spears, guns, other weapons against you. Or facing death<br/>
when your castle has been confiscated, your lord has died via seppuku at the<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] What can we define as the best samurai ???</h3>
by <i>ninaboal21044</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256445998">Sorry, but my Outlook system won't let me format this the way I want to. So<br/>
I'll comment up here to the two specific points that I copied below:<br/>
<br/>
First, Why do you think that the main character reflects what a western view<br/>
of a samurai should be? Was the director western? Was the scriptwriter<br/>
western? I don't believe so. So what makes the viewpoint "western"?<br/>
<br/>
Second, a ronin had (not "has"; we don't have any more ronin or samurai in<br/>
this present day) the right to commit seppuku, just as any member of the<br/>
bushi class had. <br/>
<br/>
The question involving the 47 Ako ronin who avenged their lord, then turned<br/>
themselves in, was a question that faced any samurai or commoner who<br/>
performed a vendetta without registering it first with the bakufu; doing a<br/>
vendetta without registering it first was a criminal act in 1702 that would<br/>
merit execution as a common criminal. So the bakufu had to decide whether<br/>
the Ako ronin were to be executed as common criminals or allowed to go free<br/>
or what the punishment should be. According to what I've read, there was a<br/>
sharp debate about this. A compromise was reached that the ronin had to die,<br/>
but instead of being executed as criminals, they would be allowed to die by<br/>
seppuku. <br/>

---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Aaaah, don't get me started on "bushido." I may raise a few hackles with the<br/>
following, but one of my pet, pet peeves is someone quoting from "Hagakure"<br/>
by Yamamoto Tsunetomo as if this were THE definitive manual on "bushido." I<br/>
keep hearing people quote from this work, especially the famous line, "the<br/>
way of the samurai is facing death."<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, Yamamoto wrote this treatise as a private correspondence<br/>
to members of his clan. It never was intended to be read by the general<br/>
public in feudal Japan, much less by people all over the world in many<br/>
languages.<br/>
<br/>
But more importantly, in my humble(?) opinion, Yamamoto had never been in a<br/>
battle and thus knew nothing first-hand about facing death. He lived in a<br/>
peaceful castle during the 18th centurey, some of the most peaceful times in<br/>
Japanese history. It's not that difficult to write stuff about how a samurai<br/>
should face death when ensconced in a place where facing death doesn't come<br/>
into the equation of one's existence at all.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to know about facing death, read some of the accounts by the<br/>
47 Asano retainers who avenged their lord (whom Yamamoto had the temerity to<br/>
criticize from his own relatively comfortable spot). Or else read any<br/>
account from any common battlefield soldier in history, one from Japan or<br/>
from any other country.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>while one of the great film makers in the world, was<br/>
often criticized in Japan for being too western and<br/>
had trouble getting some of his films made without<br/>
western backing.  The idea of an accountant that uses<br/>
a ploy to trick kenjutsu masters into feeding him<br/>
(effectively begging) then when he finally can fence,<br/>
fencing for money is all despicable in the eyes of<br/>
samurai (as they made clear at the end of the film). <br/>
The samurai (masterfully portrayed by Mifune Shiro)<br/>
was an amazing swordsman and a very nice man, but by<br/>
period samurai standards, not a worthy samurai. <br/>
This is not a story about a great samurai, it is at<br/>
its heart a love story and the relationship between a<br/>
man and his wife and how she grows to respect him and<br/>
love him not for who she wants him to become but for<br/>
who he is.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the rest of it goes Nina (the 47 Ronin<br/>
story), I can see you have let ego get involved and<br/>
you are picking nits with grammer so I will not<br/>
comment on what you said next.  Somehow I feel it is a<br/>
tone unworthy of this topic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269435707">I never said that your statement was an empty psuedo-philosophical<br/>
platitude. Someone else did, not me. <br/>
<br/>
What I was saying is that statements about facing death are a lot more<br/>
meaningful when coming from someone who has the experience of actually<br/>
facing imminent death in battle or facing an enemy. Of course we all will<br/>
die eventually. <br/>
<br/>
I just happen to think that Yamamoto's statements in "Hagakure" about how<br/>
"death is the way of the warrior" and his writings about how too many<br/>
samurai "act like women" and his criticisms of the 47 Ako ronin were not<br/>
very meaningful in light of the fact that he had never faced an<br/>
imminent-death situation.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a meaningful statement about facing death, written by Oishi<br/>
Kuranosuke and his colleagues in 1702. I found the statement within the<br/>
following link:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blackmask.com/thatway/books162c/taja.htm#1_0_3">http://www.blackmask.com/thatway/books162c/taja.htm#1_0_3</a><br/>
<br/>
   The 15th year of Genroku, the 12th month, and 15th day. We <br/>
   have come this day to do homage here, forty-seven men in all, <br/>
   from Oishi Kuranosuke down to the foot-soldier, Terasaka <br/>
   Kichiyemon, all cheerfully about to lay down our lives on your <br/>
   behalf. We reverently announce this to the honoured spirit of <br/>
   our dead master. On the 14th day of the third month of last <br/>
   year our honoured master was pleased to attack Kira Kotsuke no <br/>
   Suke, for what reason we know not. Our honoured master put an <br/>
   end to his own life, but Kira Kotsuke no Suke lived. Although <br/>
   we fear that after the decree issued by the Government this <br/>
   plot of ours will be displeasing to our honoured master, still <br/>
   we, who have eaten of your food, could not without blushing <br/>
   repeat the verse, 'Thou shalt not live under the same heaven <br/>
   nor tread the same earth with the enemy of thy father or lord,' <br/>
   nor could we have dared to leave hell and present ourselves <br/>
   before you in paradise, unless we had carried out the vengeance <br/>
   which you began. Every day that we waited seemed as three <br/>
   autumns to us. Verily, we have trodden the snow for one day, <br/>
   nay, for two days, and have tasted food but once. The old and <br/>
   decrepit, the sick and ailing, have come forth gladly to lay <br/>
   down their lives. Men might laugh at us, as at grasshoppers <br/>
   trusting in the strength of their arms, and thus shame our <br/>
   honoured lord; but we could not halt in our deed of vengeance. <br/>
   Having taken counsel together last night, we have escorted my <br/>
   Lord Kotsuke no Suke hither to your tomb. This dirk,[7] by <br/>
   which our honoured lord set great store last year, and <br/>
   entrusted to our care, we now bring back. If your noble spirit <br/>
   be now present before this tomb, we pray you, as a sign, to <br/>
   take the dirk, and, striking the head of your enemy with it a <br/>
   second time, to dispel your hatred for ever. This is the <br/>
   respectful statement of forty-seven men.<br/>

Hello, Mr. James<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, yes. But facing death from a comfortable castle  -- which is<br/>
where Yamamoto was situated when he wrote "Hagakure" is not the same as<br/>
facing death under direct attack, such as in a battle against an enemy who<br/>
is using swords, spears, guns, other weapons against you. Or facing death<br/>
when your castle has been confiscated, your lord has died via seppuku at the<br/>
Shogun's order, and you are on the outside without clan or master -- and it<br/>
is your duty to avenge him.  <br/>

Hello Ms. Nina but isnt everyday to live is to face death? And If you are a<br/>
samurai or merchant then you face death no matter who or where you are.Being<br/>
the best assin shouldnt have any thing to do with something such as<br/>
honorable becasue you are the person doing the dirty work. So the best assin<br/>
should be the best at his job or the one who got the most kills and got away<br/>
with it something to that sort. <br/>

Aaaah, don't get me started on "bushido." I may raise a few hackles with the<br/>

Seriously though the samurai was part of the class structure in japan, just as say a roman soilder was ( if not native born) given citizenship after their TofD, Or a feudal knight, even though the title of knight still exist's and bestowed on the few , you dont really expect elton john after becoming sir elton john to get fully clad in armour and ride of in service of the queen?<br/>
 <br/>
It's all about class and the postion in society, the samurai class was seen as a high social status, many tried to marry(merchants i believe) into the position of a samurai family, but once japan had modernised as with all nations that move on from it's feudal system, there was no need to have the financial burden of samurai, as japan became westernised, conscript army's etc replaced the samurai. Whilst I am no expert on japanese history nor do i claim to be, I am always amazed by so called modern day samurai, it was simply a class, anyone today claiming to be samurai maybe if japanese from a samurai background, but they are not samurai, and all the japanese that i am friends with whom claim samurai heritage , do not call themselve's samurai, in fact the samurai class being disbanded was probably one of the biggest steps in japanese history to modernise the nation.<br/>

Your post makes a lot more sense than the so-called "modern samurai" do. My <br/>
ancestors fought in the American Revolution and more recently, in the American <br/>
Civil War (with the Union side) and a few more recent wars. This does NOT make <br/>
ME an American Revolutionary Patriot nor does it make ME a Union Soldier.  I <br/>
haven't, myself, served in the Armed Forces so no matter how many ancestors I <br/>
may have had who were in the services or fought in wars, it does NOT make ME <br/>
into a soldier. <br/>
<br/>
The Japanese who descend from samurai are correct when they do NOT call <br/>
themselves "samurai." <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990248313">please read....<br/>
 <br/>
as for Kawakami Gensai's sword. its unknown. Born under the name Komori Genjirou in 1834 he changed it to Kawakami Gensai, and finally to Takeda Genbe. his appearance was described as short with long black hair. from what ive gathered, he was in his early 30's at the time of the Bakumatsu and most likely kept his hair in Chonmage, or a samurai topknot, however, some records say that he was somewhat feminine in his appearance which suggests that his hair may have hung free. He was probably of typical height, between 5' 2" and 5' 5". his sword judging by his height was probably between 26 and 28 inches long. its maker, origin, wieght and true length are all lost to history. his swordsmenship was called Furanui Ryuu and was a style he created. his starting stance was a very low iai stance. This suggests that Furanui Ryuu was a iai school, but this isnt certain. <br/>
<br/>
he was one of four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu, and was considered to be the most fearsome of all of them. He is most well known for cutting Kuma Shouzan in broad daylight, whether or not hes resposible for the numerous other assissnations that took place is unknown. When the transition of power came, his ideals of Isolationism conflicted with the Meiji Government and he was tried on false charges and beheaded sometime in 1871.<br/>
<br/>
he definitly wouldnt have used a Muramasa or a Masamune. firstly, even as little as 100 years after Masamune's death his blades were considered the finest ever made and were sought by all and during the Bakumatsu were considered national treasures. as for Muramasa, at the begining of the Tokugawa Shoganate, Tokugawa Ieyasu banned all samurai from carrying Muramasa blades. he had a deathly fear of them, he had relatives that had been killed by them and he himself had been seriously wounded with one. his first son whom he ordered to commit seppuku, was beheaded with a Muramasa blade. because of this ban hundreds of Muramasa blades were destroyed and anyone who was associated with Muramasa such as Masatoshi was also banned. but the cutting ability of Muramasa's blades were legendary, they didnt have the "spirit" that Masamune had but from a technical standpoint they were the best blades ever created. <br/>
<br/>
as for using different "Types" most samurai were presented with a sword from their lord when they came of age and began serving him. while this may have been the case with Gensai, most likely he was a ronin, but nothing is sure. eitherway, he would have used on blade and only one blade. The Nihontou is considered to be the soul of Japan and it was considered to be the soul of the Samurai, so they blade they used was respected above all else, even their wives and family. when a samurai returned home his wife would slide the sleeves of her kimono over her hand so she wouldnt touch even the scabbards. so, he probably carried only one blade his whole life, but again this is all not verified.__________________<br/>

Hello, Mr. James<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, yes. But facing death from a comfortable castle  -- which is<br/>
where Yamamoto was situated when he wrote "Hagakure" is not the same as<br/>
facing death under direct attack, such as in a battle against an enemy who<br/>
is using swords, spears, guns, other weapons against you. Or facing death<br/>
when your castle has been confiscated, your lord has died via seppuku at the<br/>
Shogun's order, and you are on the outside without clan or master -- and it<br/>
is your duty to avenge him.  <br/>

Hello Ms. Nina but isnt everyday to live is to face death? And If you are a<br/>
samurai or merchant then you face death no matter who or where you are.Being<br/>
the best assin shouldnt have any thing to do with something such as<br/>
honorable becasue you are the person doing the dirty work. So the best assin<br/>
should be the best at his job or the one who got the most kills and got away<br/>
with it something to that sort. <br/>

<br/>
Aaaah, don't get me started on "bushido." I may raise a few hackles with the<br/>
following, but one of my pet, pet peeves is someone quoting from "Hagakure"<br/>
by Yamamoto Tsunetomo as if this were THE definitive manual on "bushido." I<br/>
keep hearing people quote from this work, especially the famous line, "the<br/>
way of the samurai is facing death."<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, Yamamoto wrote this treatise as a private correspondence<br/>
to members of his clan. It never was intended to be read by the general<br/>
public in feudal Japan, much less by people all over the world in many<br/>
languages.<br/>
<br/>
But more importantly, in my humble(?) opinion, Yamamoto had never been in a<br/>
battle and thus knew nothing first-hand about facing death. He lived in a<br/>
peaceful castle during the 18th centurey, some of the most peaceful times in<br/>
Japanese history. It's not that difficult to write stuff about how a samurai<br/>
should face death when ensconced in a place where facing death doesn't come<br/>
into the equation of one's existence at all.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to know about facing death, read some of the accounts by the<br/>
47 Asano retainers who avenged their lord (whom Yamamoto had the temerity to<br/>
criticize from his own relatively comfortable spot). Or else read any<br/>
account from any common battlefield soldier in history, one from Japan or<br/>
from any other country.<br/>

as for Kawakami Gensai's sword. its unknown. Born under the name Komori Genjirou in 1834 he changed it to Kawakami Gensai, and finally to Takeda Genbe. his appearance was described as short with long black hair. from what ive gathered, he was in his early 30's at the time of the Bakumatsu and most likely kept his hair in Chonmage, or a samurai topknot, however, some records say that he was somewhat feminine in his appearance which suggests that his hair may have hung free. He was probably of typical height, between 5' 2" and 5' 5". his sword judging by his height was probably between 26 and 28 inches long. its maker, origin, wieght and true length are all lost to history. his swordsmenship was called Furanui Ryuu and was a style he created. his starting stance was a very low iai stance. This suggests that Furanui Ryuu was a iai school, but this isnt certain. <br/>
<br/>
he was one of four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu, and was considered to be the most fearsome of all of them. He is most well known for cutting Kuma Shouzan in broad daylight, whether or not hes resposible for the numerous other assissnations that took place is unknown. When the transition of power came, his ideals of Isolationism conflicted with the Meiji Government and he was tried on false charges and beheaded sometime in 1871.<br/>
<br/>
he definitly wouldnt have used a Muramasa or a Masamune. firstly, even as little as 100 years after Masamune's death his blades were considered the finest ever made and were sought by all and during the Bakumatsu were considered national treasures. as for Muramasa, at the begining of the Tokugawa Shoganate, Tokugawa Ieyasu banned all samurai from carrying Muramasa blades. he had a deathly fear of them, he had relatives that had been killed by them and he himself had been seriously wounded with one. his first son whom he ordered to commit seppuku, was beheaded with a Muramasa blade. because of this ban hundreds of Muramasa blades were destroyed and anyone who was associated with Muramasa such as Masatoshi was also banned. but the cutting ability of Muramasa's blades were legendary, they didnt have the "spirit" that Masamune had but from a technical standpoint they were the best blades ever created. <br/>
<br/>
as for using different "Types" most samurai were presented with a sword from their lord when they came of age and began serving him. while this may have been the case with Gensai, most likely he was a ronin, but nothing is sure. eitherway, he would have used on blade and only one blade. The Nihontou is considered to be the soul of Japan and it was considered to be the soul of the Samurai, so they blade they used was respected above all else, even their wives and family. when a samurai returned home his wife would slide the sleeves of her kimono over her hand so she wouldnt touch even the scabbards. so, he probably carried only one blade his whole life, but again this is all not verified.__________________<br/>

Hello, Mr. James<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, yes. But facing death from a comfortable castle  -- which is<br/>
where Yamamoto was situated when he wrote "Hagakure" is not the same as<br/>
facing death under direct attack, such as in a battle against an enemy who<br/>
is using swords, spears, guns, other weapons against you. Or facing death<br/>
when your castle has been confiscated, your lord has died via seppuku at the<br/>
Shogun's order, and you are on the outside without clan or master -- and it<br/>
is your duty to avenge him.  <br/>

Hello Ms. Nina but isnt everyday to live is to face death? And If you are a<br/>
samurai or merchant then you face death no matter who or where you are.Being<br/>
the best assin shouldnt have any thing to do with something such as<br/>
honorable becasue you are the person doing the dirty work. So the best assin<br/>
should be the best at his job or the one who got the most kills and got away<br/>
with it something to that sort. <br/>

---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Aaaah, don't get me started on "bushido." I may raise a few hackles with the<br/>
following, but one of my pet, pet peeves is someone quoting from "Hagakure"<br/>
by Yamamoto Tsunetomo as if this were THE definitive manual on "bushido." I<br/>
keep hearing people quote from this work, especially the famous line, "the<br/>
way of the samurai is facing death."<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, Yamamoto wrote this treatise as a private correspondence<br/>
to members of his clan. It never was intended to be read by the general<br/>
public in feudal Japan, much less by people all over the world in many<br/>
languages.<br/>
<br/>
But more importantly, in my humble(?) opinion, Yamamoto had never been in a<br/>
battle and thus knew nothing first-hand about facing death. He lived in a<br/>
peaceful castle during the 18th centurey, some of the most peaceful times in<br/>
Japanese history. It's not that difficult to write stuff about how a samurai<br/>
should face death when ensconced in a place where facing death doesn't come<br/>
into the equation of one's existence at all.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to know about facing death, read some of the accounts by the<br/>
47 Asano retainers who avenged their lord (whom Yamamoto had the temerity to<br/>
criticize from his own relatively comfortable spot). Or else read any<br/>
account from any common battlefield soldier in history, one from Japan or<br/>
from any other country.<br/>
