<h3>More saya trivia</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502698224">We were once shown a move used by experienced old samurai to <br/>
avoid saya clashing.<br/>
<br/>
Under peacetime Tokugaawa administration the samurai were stuck <br/>
as a solcial class with nothing to do, men of honour with no <br/>
way to prove it, so there was periodic unrest among them.<br/>
<br/>
The 'punks' of the day were called kaubuki mono (deviant <br/>
persons) and characterised by bizarre and faddish dress and <br/>
unruly behaviour. They shaved their heads, or wore fanciful <br/>
hairstyles, or just let their hair flow loose, and they wore <br/>
over-long swords with bright red saya and frequently were the <br/>
cause of street fights.<br/>
<br/>
So the seasoned old samurai sees one of these hotheads coming <br/>
towards him, the distinctive red saya sticking out a mile! As <br/>
they are about to pass on the saya side, the old man, who's <br/>
left hand has been resting easily on top of the saya, grips, <br/>
twists his knuckles outward, and at the same time pulls his <br/>
hand up towards his shoulder. This move ends with the sword <br/>
parallel to the body, close to the side, and has two <br/>
advantages:<br/>
<br/>
1 - It avoided the saya clash (and thus a fight)<br/>
2 - Some men carried saya that were designed to split. They <br/>
would brush passed and bump their victim, twisting the body and <br/>
levering the hilt as they did so. The saya would split and the <br/>
blade would be in contact with their victim's waist as the <br/>
assasin turned, and thus deliver a debilitating wound.<br/>
If this was the hothead's intention, the old man's own sword, <br/>
carried vertically from chest to knee alongside the body's <br/>
edge, would act as a shield.<br/>
<br/>
Either way the hothead, tricked by the sudden defensive move, <br/>
would lose the initiative and the old man could cut him down at <br/>
his leisure (or walk away).<br/>
