<div id="ygrps-yiv-675502173">As Tony said, 'No Kami' was a title that designated the owner as a governor <br/>
of a given province.  By the 16th Century this had become mostly honorific, <br/>
though certain lords carried a given governorship from generation to <br/>
generation that was based in fact (such as the Shimazu of Satsuma, who were <br/>
styled 'Satsuma no kami' and the So of Tsushima, who were styled 'Tsushima <br/>
no kami' - as well as Chosokabe Motochika, who assumed the title 'Tosa no <br/>
kami' after being confirmed in that province by Toyotomi Hideyoshi).  While <br/>
any number of men in Japan might have the same title at any one time, they <br/>
tended to be unique within a given clan - that is, and for example, Takeda <br/>
retainer Baba Nobufusa became 'Mino no kami' after the death of the previous <br/>
holder of that title within the Takeda, Hara Toratane.  This occured in 1564 <br/>
- from this point on Nobufusa is almost always described as 'Baba Mino' or <br/>
'Baba Mino no kami'.  An individual might in fact be awarded a number of 'no <br/>
kami's in his life time, depending on his fortunes.  We know that, for <br/>
example, Hatakeyama Takamasa (1527-1576) carried the titles Kii no kami, <br/>
Harima no kami, and Owari no kami at various points in his career.<br/>
Another, similar, title, was 'Deputy Governor' - or 'no suke', which <br/>
applied, among other things, to certain provinces in the Kanto (such as <br/>
Kozuke).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm.. I think i'd like the "long" answer ;)  - - I've noticed, for <br/>
example, at one point Mori Motonari had / was given the title "Mutsu <br/>
no Kami" - I assume that Motonari had never been to Mutsu considering <br/>
it is on the other side of the country.  Also, Shimazu Takahisa seems <br/>
to have held this title around the same time - give or take some <br/>
decades - not to mention the fact that Hojo Ujiteru and Date Masamune <br/>
apparently held this title at roughly the same time.  I can see Date <br/>
Masamune holding this title considering he LIVED there, but these <br/>
other guys...  (another example would be 'suruga no kami' - held by: <br/>
Usami Sadayuki, Mogami Iechika, Kikkawa Motoharu, Itagaki Nobutaka, <br/>
Imagawa Yoshimoto,Daidoji Masashige, and Asahina Nobuoki(and probably <br/>
others) - in this case Yoshimoto and Asahina Nobuoki, and possibly <br/>
Itagaki Nobutaka had ties to Suruga).    <br/>
<br/>
Was there a medeival "Bureau for the giving of governorships" that <br/>
kept track of all these titles, (and were the titles 'bestowed' at <br/>
all) or were they random honorary titles given by someone of higher <br/>
authority? - sort of a 'psuedo-rank' to let them feel important? (or <br/>
to let the emperor feel important by having the power to give out <br/>
titles?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617288181">I have the same questions as West-san....though the<br/>
information by FW Seal-san was great! I didn't know<br/>
the difference between no suke and no<br/>
kami...interesting. However, even Hashiba<br/>
Chikuzen-no-kami Hideyoshi didn't "rule" his named<br/>
province; what was the rationale behind giving these<br/>
titles to samurai nowhere near the location? And was<br/>
it given by the daimyo or the court? Not that I use<br/>
games as a historical reference, but my Japanese copy<br/>
of Nobunaga's Ambition for the PlayStation has the<br/>
court give out titles...what's the real deal?<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: what is no kami</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-217006376">Well, as I mentioned, the '-no kami' title was for the most part honorific <br/>
by the sengoku period.  The title seems to have become widespread in the <br/>
Kamakura Period, when it was based in fact (often being given to shugo <br/>
houses). By the Ashikaga age, the title was simply a sign of esteem.<br/>
In a similar vein, even more ancient titles were still being used in this <br/>
honorific fashion - Nakatsukasa, for example, was one of the 8 offices <br/>
established by the ancient Yoro revision of the Tiaho Code.  As an example, <br/>
Tokugawa retainer Honda Tadakatsu was awarded the title Nakatsukasa-taiyu in <br/>
1586 on a visit to Toyotomi Hideyoshi.  Obviously, Tadakatsu really had <br/>
nothing to do with the 'Ministry of the Central Office' (Nakatsukasa), nor <br/>
did Shimazu retainer Hishijima Gunai-shoyu Kunisada (d.1600) have much to do <br/>
with the ancient 'Ministry of the Imperial Household' (Gunai/Kunai).<br/>
As for who exactly handed out these titles, I actually have not read much on <br/>
that. My assumption is that the Court was petitioned in individual cases to <br/>
Ok the awarding of the titles in question (as opposed to the Court doing so <br/>
of its own volition as a rule, as literally hundreds - if not thousands - of <br/>
'-no kami''s were walking around at any given time, if one is to judge by <br/>
retainer registries).  I do know of any number of specific examples, one of <br/>
which involved Takeda Shingen.  At the time of his coming of age, <br/>
representatives of both the the court and shogunate were in attendance.  At <br/>
that time he was allowed to use the 'Haru' from the name of the then-shogun, <br/>
Yoshiharu, as well as the title 'Shinano no kami'.  Around 1560 the Court <br/>
awarded Mori Motonari and his eldest son Takamoto various titles (including <br/>
'Mutsu no kami' for Motonari and 'Daizen-daibu' for Takamoto) in recognition <br/>
of gifts and donations they had sent on the occasion of the Emperor <br/>
Ogimachi's enthronement in 1559.<br/>
Perhaps the liberal use of titles harks back, at least in spirit, to ancient <br/>
China, where one saw a bewildering array of colorful titles in circulation.  <br/>
Certainly, sai-tai-shogun seems to have a Sino-inspired basis.<br/>
