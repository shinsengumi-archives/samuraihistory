Chinese artists I have studied under. My first sumi-e teacher emphasized <br/>
being in a contemplative and relaxed frame of  mind, possibly not <br/>
surprising since the class was at a Soto Zen church and her husband was <br/>
the Reverend. My second painting teacher, who is Chinese, really <br/>
emphasizes expressing your feelings and to paint freely. "Drink more <br/>
wine", as he would say! My calligraphy teacher is very analytical, <br/>
concentrating on formal styles and techniques and figures the artistic <br/>
part has to come from you.<br/>
<br/>
While all three teachers use copying as part of their lessons, it is <br/>
never intended to suppress your ego, but to simply help you practice a <br/>
certain stroke or effect. Obviously I'm not that widely experienced, I'd <br/>
be interested in any personal accounts about training people have received.<br/>

Experience and practice helps, no need for any 'mysticism' there. <br/>
Practice makes perfect is a western expression as well.<br/>

that's 'mystic'. I don't percieve my materials as speaking to me though. <br/>
I just know, this paper is heavy and has lots of sizing, I must use lots <br/>
of dark ink. This paper is light and unsized, I must work fast and <br/>
lightly. If I'm working in metal, plastic or wood, I've worked enough <br/>

Practice, tools, and technique, and if your lucky a bit of art as well.<br/>

it could be said that if we're trained to the correct<br/>

lack that training, may overlook.<br/>
<br/>
        Blessings and good faring, all.<br/>
                Gereg<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**** snipped to shreds for brevity****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gereg,<br/>
<br/>
I've followed this thread with no little amount of interest, and wondering<br/>
how I could chime in halfway sensibly, when I came across the part of your<br/>
message I didn't snip out.  Still not sure if I can write in a sensible<br/>
manner, but I'll try.<br/>
G:  The evidence is in your favour.  It all looks pretty sensible to me.<br/>
If I recall correctly, you had early on in your writing alluded to 'the<br/>
artist's eye', and to perceptions that others might miss.<br/>
G:  I don't recall the phrase, but I might have used it.  I don't dispute<br/>
the gist of this.<br/>
Some people seem<br/>
to have an ability to perceive that is so sensitive as to appear<br/>
'supernatural', or 'mystic'.  Artists, particularly those of Eastern arts,<br/>
including martial,  are taught (or advised) to learn to put aside their own<br/>
ego and absorb their environment, especially in the beginning, of their<br/>
training.  Later on they have learned, or should have learned, to<br/>
incorporate their ego into their perceptions 'properly', and 'become one'<br/>
with the world around them.  Clumsily and said in clich√© form, forgive me,<br/>
but that means to me that the person has become the same ego inside and out,<br/>
and is in a state of 'constant harmony' with their environment....   a place<br/>
in their existence where perception of and response to their environment is<br/>
so well ingrained that the individual appears to have some kind of 'power'.<br/>
  It's not power; it is 'mushin'.....   at rest,  this concept is<br/>
'zanshin'.............   but this you know already.<br/>
G:  I'm with you so far, but I'll note this:  as I see it, that is 'some<br/>
kind of power.'  I believe I've said (though perhaps not here) that I've<br/>
seen a good deal of magic, but I don't believe in the supernatural.  This is<br/>
a nice example of the sort of thing I mean.  The terminology my Aikido<br/>
sensei used to use - centring, grounding, gathering ki (often translated<br/>
'life force') - always reminded me a great deal of the way my Wiccan friends<br/>
talked about European paganism.  They called it magic, he always hastened to<br/>
say it wasn't.  From their respective approaches, I think they were both<br/>
right.  Focussed will produces results, it's as simple as that.  And those<br/>
results are not always limited to obvious - or even rational - cause and<br/>
effect.<br/>
As a person who has knit, crocheted, embroidered, and sewn since she was 7<br/>
years old,  the catalog of impressions my brain has stored about fabrics,<br/>
yarns, and threads is more than I can consciously recall. We in the<br/>
knitter's realm have a concept of yarn 'telling us what it wants to be'<br/>
such that we say the yarn 'speaks to us'.  Other knitters I know scoff at us<br/>
about 'mysticism', and proceed to knit with yarn obviously unsuited to their<br/>
project and they are wailing and complaining about a 'troublesome project'.<br/>
They wonder at how others of us can 'make it look so easy'.  I try to<br/>
describe the way I personally 'hear' my yarn or fabric is not in words per<br/>
se, but in a mind-full picture conjured by that store of impressions already<br/>
there.  If the needle size is wrong for the yarn, it will appear to 'fight'<br/>
being knit.<br/>
<br/>
Another person who paints, draws, or writes is tuned to a different store of<br/>
information, as are swordsmiths and all other artisans.   Persons who<br/>
develop several avenues of pursuit get better at amalgamating information<br/>
and perceptions of those arts into a cohesiveness, a 'way' of responding to<br/>
their environment that to others can seem a bit unreal, but it is not.  It<br/>
is simply being and staying aware and responsive to the cues given by one's<br/>
environment.<br/>
Health care providers, particularly nurses, also undergo a barrage of<br/>
sensory input that is beyond conscious recall, but some of them can take in<br/>
the appearance of a patient, and the summation of impressions that 'come up<br/>
on screen' 'tells' them that something is not going well.  It's that 'gut'<br/>
feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Soldiers also develop that catalog, unfortunately, with experience in<br/>
battle; Nathan can undoubtedly expound on this subject  much better than I.<br/>
Some groundwork is certainly laid with intensive training.<br/>
<br/>
What do my previous words have to do with swords that  seem to 'speak'?<br/>
<br/>
I think it has more to do with the person who is handling the sword, than it<br/>
does with the sword itself.  I think it is that awareness, that catalog of<br/>
physical and visual impressions gathered over time, and the ability to allow<br/>
one's mind to create a meaningful picture.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I have a lot more to say,  also about the way a samurai may have<br/>
perceived his blade,  but it mostly enters into the realm of psychology, so<br/>
I won't go there unless there is interest in further discussion.  This is,<br/>
after all, a history list.<br/>
<br/>
Off to work with me....<br/>
<br/>
Lizzie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
G:  The yarn analogy is amusing, partly because my wife's recently started<br/>
spinning, but mostly because I've lately found myself regrinding some stock<br/>
blades - mostly Windlass Cutlery swords - that are tip-heavy and unwieldy.<br/>
A student gets a blade, it's not suited to him or her - but with a little<br/>
work it could be...  I've been told I bring out the "inner blade," and while<br/>
that may be a little excessive, I do find I have a pretty clear feeling for<br/>
what that sword wants to be.  As far as that goes, I agree with your<br/>
analysis completely.  That's the sense that tells me how much taper's<br/>
needed, what kind of ricasso to leave, whether a new pommel's necessary,<br/>
etc.<br/>
...But it's not the same sense as that I get of the personality of the sword<br/>
itself.  Consider your analogy to health care:  that experienced unconscious<br/>
analysis - to use a clumsy explication of 'intuition" - may tell you what<br/>
treatment a patient will respond to, but it isn't how you can tell the<br/>
patient's in the room with you.<br/>
That analogy isn't as stretched as it might seem, either, since the obvious<br/>
counter to that would be:  "Well, I can see the patient."  Fair enough:  an<br/>
ex-wife did hospital work, much of it with seniors; she said she could<br/>
immediately tell when a patient had died, as soon as she walked into the<br/>
room, by a feeling of absence that didn't seem to be related to sound or<br/>
smell or sight.  I have no trouble believing this, and I doubt that her<br/>
sensitivity is unique:  I'm guessing that's a pretty common phenomenon among<br/>
nurses - am I right?<br/>
Now I find this idea so credible (even if I'm wrong about it) not because<br/>
I've been around enough death to sense the absence myself, but because I<br/>
feel a corresponding sense of presence in many (not all, but many) blades.<br/>
After considering Mr. Sinclaire's post, I've come to wonder if a blade as<br/>
old as he's speaking of might not have developed sufficient 'presence' -<br/>
perhaps a less inflammatory term than 'spirit' - that it might be more<br/>
conspicuously perceptible.  It is certainly my experience that a blade that<br/>
has been lovingly used for any length of time always carries with it a<br/>
proportionately more intense presence.  That focussed will that I mentioned<br/>
earlier is also a factor here.<br/>
<br/>
Now as a general note on this thread, I'd like to apologise for an<br/>
unintentional trap I set.  I didn't originally want to get into the subject<br/>
of religion here, because that's not what this list is about.  But it is a<br/>
fact that these ideas are connected to my personal faith, and in retrospect<br/>
I've come to think that if I'd been clearer about that to begin with, the<br/>
responses I got might have been accordingly more respectful, and I wouldn't<br/>
have been in a position to take such offense.<br/>
My regrets and apologies for the resultant unpleasantness:  to Nate in<br/>
particular, and to the rest of you.  I look forward to more civil<br/>
disagreements, and to even more civil agreements.<br/>
	In honour,<br/>

things that others, who lack that training, may overlook."<br/>
<br/>
I think the traditional means of training in the <br/>
martial arts differs from the west. We perceive <br/>
'knowledge' as, in a sense, 'objective data', to be <br/>
learnt, imparted from sensei to student, and upon <br/>
this foundation one can speculate with a lesser or <br/>
greater degree of accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
Thus we are head or question based.<br/>
<br/>
In the dojo nothing is said, you are shown, and learn <br/>
by example, and emulation. I have memories of sensei <br/>
stopping me, then showing me the form. I do exactly what <br/>
he does, and he shows me again, I do the same again and <br/>
he shows me again. I do EXACTLY what he did, and he shakes <br/>
his head and walks away.<br/>
<br/>
Well, not quite, but the assimilation of knowledge <br/>
through training and kata is not 'head knowledge' <br/>
but 'heart' or 'body knowledge'.<br/>
<br/>
There is a phrase in Japanese 'hand knowledge' - <br/>
it's to do with how one holds the sword. Although there <br/>
is the basic, most dynamic grip, the position of the <br/>
hands change all the time as one performs the <br/>
technique - the training is to stop bad habit (weak grip)<br/>
but once the hands understand what they're supposed to do,<br/>
best leave it up to them.<br/>

I was going to 'wax lyrical' somewhat further, but now I have <br/>
a cold, and my daughter returns from university with mumps! <br/>
Hopefully I will not be wearing hakama as a medicinal necessity <br/>
in the near future!<br/>
<br/>
I think I did not quite agree with the notion of the sword <br/>
talking to the swordsman -<br/>
<br/>
In none of the stuff I have read, re training in swordsmanship, <br/>
is there any presentation of this idea.<br/>
<br/>
With the smith, however, I think there is a strong connection. <br/>
As has been stated previously, some smiths undertook Shinto <br/>
practices of purification before making a sword, and i have seen <br/>
at least one print of the goddess engaged with the smith in <br/>
forging the blade.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't think inanimate objects have a 'soul' <br/>
(this from a Catholic lay theologian - so if we want to <br/>
discuss lets do so offline) whereas I do believe objects have <br/>
spirit - imparted to them by their maker/owner.<br/>
<br/>
In Buddhist philosophy there is tariki - other power - <br/>
and jiriki - self-power.<br/>
<br/>
I think the notion of referring to a sword as 'talking' etc, <br/>
as tariki.<br/>
<br/>
The superstitious samurai used every means to sway the fates <br/>
in his favour - tariki - prayers carried in the helmet or close <br/>
to the body, carvings on the tangs of swords and also on castle <br/>
walls. This is the way I read your post with regard to the <br/>
sword having a soul of its own. I'm not saying that religion is <br/>
superstition, but rather their response to the arbitary nature <br/>
of death in battle shaped their superstitions.<br/>
<br/>
The great swordsmen had to rise above superstition - their <br/>
training of the great swordsmen was jiriki - self-power. <br/>
They realised that a Musashi or a Nobutsuna could be undone <br/>
by a moment of psycholigical weakness, and all their training <br/>
was towards a state of constant readiness.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way as the smith forges a blade, the swordsman <br/>
forges himself, or rather his 'self', and all the literature <br/>
of the martial ryu reflect this notion as the foundation of the <br/>
way of the warrior. If we introduce the notion of the sword <br/>
having its own soul, which it imparts to the swordsman, then we <br/>
stand in danger of confusing the disciplines and rendering the <br/>
whole thing a nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do agree that swordsmen could appreciate the <br/>
qualities of a blade that do not lend themselves to physical <br/>
observation.<br/>

As you point out later, you can't know until your hands know. This <br/>
method was widely used in thes West as well until fairly recently. I <br/>
knew some much older machinists who would let you watch them perform an <br/>
operation but sure as hell wouldn't explain it. Nowadays students expect <br/>
more explanations.<br/>

<h3>Re: Hey just thought you all might like this one - OT</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211815363">hi James - <br/>
<br/>
I am a typographer/designer by trade, and used to lecture on <br/>
type and legibility.<br/>
<br/>
People read not by stringing letters together, but by <br/>
recognising word shapes. The eye skims across the top of a line <br/>
of type like a stone skimmed across the water. As you say, first <br/>
and last letters are important, as is the top half of the line - <br/>
try reading covering up the top half and bottom half of the line.<br/>
<br/>
That's why technical or specialist subject books can be 'difficult' <br/>
to read - it's not that we don't understand the content, it's that <br/>
the brain's working harder because it doesn't recognise all the<br/>
shapes, so reading is 'difficult' and more tiring.<br/>
<br/>
We misread things when we mistake the word shape. And as reading <br/>
is a habit, we read easiest what we read most (forming our<br/>
vocabulary), and often mistake strange words for known ones.<br/>
<br/>
I used to illustrate the lecture with the following story:<br/>
<br/>
As a martial artist, I know every martial art shop in London, <br/>
so I was surprised, riding in a bus one day through a part of <br/>
town I thought I knew, to see an MA shop that I didn't know of.<br/>
<br/>
Run downstairs (double decker bus), leap off, run across road and <br/>
into shop, and whoa! This can't be right (unless it's ninja <br/>
supplies?) Step outside shop and look up at sign, which says not<br/>
'martial arts', but 'marital aids'.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Any skill that requires physical coordination has to be taught this way.<br/>
As you point out later, you can't know until your hands know. This<br/>
method was widely used in thes West as well until fairly recently. I<br/>
knew some much older machinists who would let you watch them perform an<br/>
operation but sure as hell wouldn't explain it. Nowadays students expect<br/>
more explanations.<br/>
<br/>
G:  A contrasting perspective on this idea is that the people who do things<br/>
best are not always the ones who are capable of explaining it best.  I think<br/>
it highly probable that the original teachers of martial arts fell into this<br/>
category, and that this became the accepted model for such teaching.  ...I<br/>
also confess to a sneaking suspicion that this served to cover a great deal<br/>
of poor teaching over the generations.  And that's not necessarily an insult<br/>
to any of the teachers, in my mind, because what other model for the art of<br/>
teaching did they have themselves?  Here's a case where I think mystique<br/>
served no good purpose.  Teaching is an art unto itself, and can be applied<br/>
with good results to pretty much any external discipline.  (Internal<br/>
disciplines are more tricky.)  Myself, I come from a teaching background,<br/>
and I find that if I can explain a concept clearly, I can get the student to<br/>
learn faster.  (In many cases, this means less of a straightforward verbal<br/>
explanation and more of a method of evoking the correct kinesthetic<br/>
sensation:  I don't want to suggest that anyone can simply be talked through<br/>
learning - say - to cut correctly.)  I find that this approach involves far<br/>
less frustration for me and the student both.  So my experience, at least,<br/>
James, is that most skills involving physical co-ordination can be taught<br/>
with good results, using a very different method than the one you've<br/>
described here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Correct practice makes perfect. A slightly improved saying.<br/>
G:  I'd say both of those have merit; I don't think they're quite the same.<br/>
The former speaks more to me of training the intuition, the latter of<br/>
training the form.  The art would be incomplete without both.<br/>

keeping the mysteries a secret. Knowledge was job security. Human nature <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm not that mystical, training is training, but what do you expect from <br/>
some literal minded engineer ;) Several reasons for very indirect in the <br/>
West, I suspect apply in period Japan as well, we just have documented <br/>
evidence for them in the West. Somebody on the list may know of the <br/>
Eastern evidence as well.<br/>
<br/>
1. Job security<br/>
2. I know something you don't know! Childish, but powerful motives.<br/>
3. Worry about skill being inappropriately used without complete training.<br/>
4. Technique is more effective than the usual methods, more money or <br/>
victories possible.<br/>
5. Forcing the student to pay attention and respect their teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Just random thoughts.<br/>
