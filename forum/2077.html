<h3>Mizuage</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345336754">Since this was brought up some clarification is needed.  Mizuage did <br/>
NOT become a common practice until the early 20th century. While it <br/>
may have happened earlier it was when nationalism swept Japan that <br/>
the Geisha were seen as one of the symbols of old Japan, and were <br/>
seen as the quintesential Japanese.  This popularity of the Geisha <br/>
caused a boom of 80,000 women in their ranks.  It also caused the <br/>
wide spread practice of mizuage by the women that owned the geisha to <br/>
cash in even more on the patriotism of their patrons.  And, I have <br/>
not heard of it happening since the end of WWII.  So to say that <br/>
every Geisha *SELLS* her virginity it might give the impression that <br/>
it is still a wide spread practice that continues to this day.</div>
