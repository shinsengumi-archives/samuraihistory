<h3>Auction Fundraiser for the S-A Journal - Japanese history related Manga</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-564348612">I've listed a batch of two Manga for sale on Ebay to do some<br/>
fundraising for the costs of the forthcoming Journal of Japanese<br/>
history. These are two manga that deal with the bakumatsu period. From<br/>
the Ebay description:<br/>
<br/>
These are two Japanese Bakumatsu era themed manga - "Sono Toki Rekishi<br/>
ga Ugoita - Bakumatsu Edition", which covers seven historical events<br/>
from the Bakumatsu era of Japanese history, including the now<br/>
legendary Ikedaya Incident, in which the Shinsengumi killed and<br/>
captured Choshu loyalists at the Ikedaya inn, the assassination of<br/>
Sakamoto Ryoma, and "The Last Battle of Hijikata Toshizo". The "Sono<br/>
Toki" manga series is based on the NHK television series of the same<br/>
name which dramatically examines seminal moments in Japanese history<br/>
from a purely historical perspective. This manga was published in<br/>
2003, and is 504 pages.<br/>
<br/>
The Second manga is "Hidamari no Ki", a fictionalized account of<br/>
events during the Bakumatsu period by Tezuka Osamu, with stories about<br/>
Henry Heusken, Townsend Harris, and other notable Bakumatsu era<br/>
figures. This manga was published in 2002, and has 336 pages. There<br/>
are some minor stains on the outside edge, but it is in good<br/>
condition. Both manga have colorful dust jackets which are in good<br/>
condition, and are Japanese imports.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
