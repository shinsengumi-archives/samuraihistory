<div id="ygrps-yiv-312307073">hello,<br/>
     i just purchased a paul chen wind & thunder katana off ebay. it came new in the box. when i opened it, the factory had heavily oiled it up plus there are little woodchips from the Saya(scabbard) all over it. I shook the Saya out as much as possible but the blade is a whole different story. I don't want to try to clean it untill i know what i'm doing. It came with a cleaning kit but i don't know what is for what. anyone who has any knowledge on basic sword cleaning kits and would like to give me a short explanation of how it all works please do so.<br/>

To clean a blade, first strip the blade of all fittings including the<br/>
habaki. The cleaning kit should contain a "powder puffer", probably on a<br/>
stick. This is called uchiko and is basically for removing oil. If the blade<br/>
is heavilly coated, take a soft cloth or tissue and remove the excess by<br/>
wiping, from the habaki area to the kissaki in one stroke. Do not make a<br/>
backwards and forwards type of motion. When most of the oil is off, tap out<br/>
the uichiko liberally onto the blade, including the mune or back edge. With<br/>
a fresh piece of cloth or paper (nugui-game may be supplied in your cleaning<br/>
kit in which case it will need crumpling up to soften it) wipe from habaki<br/>
area to kissaki, again using one stroke. Eventually this should remove all<br/>
the oil although several applications may be necessary. After studying the<br/>
now clean blade you may wish to re-oil the blade with the choji-abura that<br/>
should be supplied in the cleaning kit.<br/>
As the uichiko comes in many grades and qualities and is slightly abraisive,<br/>
be sure not to grip the blade too tightly when wiping it and always use the<br/>
single stroke method to avoid unsightly scratches. Do not apply any paper or<br/>
cloth that has touched the nakago to the rest of the blade as you may<br/>
introduce grit onto the polished surface. Never clean the nakago.<br/>
I would emphasise that this is how to use a cleaning kit on a real Japanese<br/>
sword. I have no knowledge of  Paul Chen swords but assume the same method<br/>
applies.You should always clean the sword in this way after use in Iai-do as<br/>
contact with your hands will quickly rust if not cleaned. Of course, this<br/>
does not apply to stainless steel blades.<br/>
It is a matter of personal taste as to whether a blade is kept permanently<br/>
oiled or dry. Personnely, in the UK where there is generally a moderate<br/>
climate I prefer to keep my swords dry although, I have started oiling them<br/>
for the summer months in recent years. I know that many derive great<br/>
pleasure from cleaning and oiling their swords in an almost ritualistic way.<br/>
The smell of the choji-abura (clove oil) is quite pleasant but avoid getting<br/>
into any open wounds, scratches etc as it may have an unpleasant reaction.<br/>
I hope this is of some interest.<br/>
Regards<br/>
Clive Sinclaire<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084507215">Hi Mark. You don't quote if the blade has Bohi. If your blade has Bohi,<br/>
and as it's a working blade that'll see a lot of cleaning, is better to<br/>
polish inside the Bohi (ONLY this part, inside the Bohi) *from tip to<br/>
Nakago* , the reverse as the rest of the blade, because if you polish<br/>
the correct way Hi too, the result in the long time will be a change in<br/>
the polish at the very end of the Hi. As Mr. Sinclaire quoted, Uchiko<br/>
(and Paul Chen's one isn't a top level one) is very slightly abrasive.  <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new katana HELP PLEASE!!!!</h3>
by <i>federicotrejos</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020391210">Good morning.<br/>
<br/>
I think Mr. Sinclaire explanation is quite excellent.<br/>
All I want to tell you is this : It seems that you are<br/>
a "rookie"<br/>
in this matter, I know Katana are very beautiful and a<br/>
master piece.   But never forget her primary use : to<br/>
kill trough cutting.   Be very respectful with her and<br/>
around her.   Remember<br/>
what you have in your hands is a Shin Ken and although<br/>
it is a recent made blade I know for shore it has a<br/>
very sharp and excellent edge.<br/>
   Also please avoid trying tameshigiri if you do not<br/>
know what you are doing, you can ruin your blade and<br/>
even worst, get very seriously injured.<br/>
   Finally, if you are not practicing any martial art<br/>
such as Kendo or my beloved Iaido, I strongly<br/>
encourage you to do it in order to learn more about<br/>
your Shin ken.   Only through the right path you will<br/>
enjoy it the most.<br/>
<br/>
   Best regards.<br/>
<br/>
 Federico.<br/>

    I've asked the same ? many times to a lot of different people. I've been told that Howard Clark(out of Morgan Valley Forge) makes an excellent katana. Go to his website at mvforge.com. If i can remember, his new L6 katana goes for about $3800 & that's for the blade only. I also know a company out of Japan(i'll get back to you w/ the web address) that makes great katana's also. They run for about $10,000-$15,000 completed. Go to bugei trading company's website(bugei.com), they have a whole array of very high quality katana's all hand made. They start off at around $925 and go up from there. They also work w/ Howard Clark. Anyways,... these are just a few places where you might want to look if you want to purchase a amazing katana. I don't actually own any of them b/c of the prices.( i've a kid's and a wife that doesn't work) This is just what i've heard from A LOT of people. Good luck & if you can actually afford one of them,...i'm jealous. :)<br/>
                                              Thanks,<br/>

  Hi Mark. You don't quote if the blade has Bohi. If your blade has Bohi,<br/>
and as it's a working blade that'll see a lot of cleaning, is better to<br/>
polish inside the Bohi (ONLY this part, inside the Bohi) *from tip to<br/>
Nakago* , the reverse as the rest of the blade, because if you polish<br/>
the correct way Hi too, the result in the long time will be a change in<br/>
the polish at the very end of the Hi. As Mr. Sinclaire quoted, Uchiko<br/>
(and Paul Chen's one isn't a top level one) is very slightly abrasive.  <br/>

Oggetto: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new katana HELP PLEASE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
hello,<br/>
     i just purchased a paul chen wind & thunder katana off ebay. it<br/>
came new in the box. when i opened it, the factory had heavily oiled it<br/>
up plus there are little woodchips from the Saya(scabbard) all over it.<br/>
I shook the Saya out as much as possible but the blade is a whole<br/>
different story. I don't want to try to clean it untill i know what i'm<br/>
doing. It came with a cleaning kit but i don't know what is for what.<br/>

to give me a short explanation of how it all works please do so.<br/>

  Mark<br/>
To clean a blade, first strip the blade of all fittings including the<br/>
habaki. The cleaning kit should contain a "powder puffer", probably on a<br/>
stick. This is called uchiko and is basically for removing oil. If the blade<br/>
is heavilly coated, take a soft cloth or tissue and remove the excess by<br/>
wiping, from the habaki area to the kissaki in one stroke. Do not make a<br/>
backwards and forwards type of motion. When most of the oil is off, tap out<br/>
the uichiko liberally onto the blade, including the mune or back edge. With<br/>
a fresh piece of cloth or paper (nugui-game may be supplied in your cleaning<br/>
kit in which case it will need crumpling up to soften it) wipe from habaki<br/>
area to kissaki, again using one stroke. Eventually this should remove all<br/>
the oil although several applications may be necessary. After studying the<br/>
now clean blade you may wish to re-oil the blade with the choji-abura that<br/>
should be supplied in the cleaning kit.<br/>
As the uichiko comes in many grades and qualities and is slightly abraisive,<br/>
be sure not to grip the blade too tightly when wiping it and always use the<br/>
single stroke method to avoid unsightly scratches. Do not apply any paper or<br/>
cloth that has touched the nakago to the rest of the blade as you may<br/>
introduce grit onto the polished surface. Never clean the nakago.<br/>
I would emphasise that this is how to use a cleaning kit on a real Japanese<br/>
sword. I have no knowledge of  Paul Chen swords but assume the same method<br/>
applies.You should always clean the sword in this way after use in Iai-do as<br/>
contact with your hands will quickly rust if not cleaned. Of course, this<br/>
does not apply to stainless steel blades.<br/>
It is a matter of personal taste as to whether a blade is kept permanently<br/>
oiled or dry. Personnely, in the UK where there is generally a moderate<br/>
climate I prefer to keep my swords dry although, I have started oiling them<br/>
for the summer months in recent years. I know that many derive great<br/>
pleasure from cleaning and oiling their swords in an almost ritualistic way.<br/>
The smell of the choji-abura (clove oil) is quite pleasant but avoid getting<br/>
into any open wounds, scratches etc as it may have an unpleasant reaction.<br/>
I hope this is of some interest.<br/>
Regards<br/>
Clive Sinclaire<br/>

<h3>Re: R: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new katana HELP PLEASE!!!! ok quick question</h3>
by <i>Clive Sinclaire</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478185294">James<br/>
I think it is worth being realistic when discussing Paul Chen swords. They<br/>
are of course, very good for Iai-do and I hear (although I have no personal<br/>
experience) that they are improving in quality. I even hear that certain<br/>
mukansa level Japanese swordsmiths are regularly visiting Shanghai and<br/>
teaching the making of Japanese swords to local craftsmen, presumably for<br/>
commercial considerations.<br/>
<br/>
However, the point that I am struggling to make is that Chen swords are in<br/>
no way comprable to fine swords from the pre Meiji period or even the hand<br/>
made swords from post Meiji jidai. These swords are known, because of their great beauty, as Token Bijutsu and those of particular historical or<br/>
cultural importance are of great value. There is, therefore, a world of<br/>
difference between the more practical swords of Paul Chen and "real"<br/>
Japanese swords. I just think that it is importanat that those who buy<br/>
Chinese made Japanese swords, if that is not a contradiction in terms, are<br/>
labouring under no illusions.<br/>
<br/>
I write the above in answer to James's question But if its not the best or a top level one what is? Who can I look for. <br/>
If I have the wrong end of the stick on this discussion, please forgive me.<br/>

I am not a sword guru but I have seen a sword by Paul Chen and its the best<br/>
you can get where I am from. But if its not the best or a top level one what<br/>
is? Who can I look for. GOD BLESS ALL<br/>

  Hi Mark. You don't quote if the blade has Bohi. If your blade has Bohi,<br/>
and as it's a working blade that'll see a lot of cleaning, is better to<br/>
polish inside the Bohi (ONLY this part, inside the Bohi) *from tip to<br/>
Nakago* , the reverse as the rest of the blade, because if you polish<br/>
the correct way Hi too, the result in the long time will be a change in<br/>
the polish at the very end of the Hi. As Mr. Sinclaire quoted, Uchiko<br/>
(and Paul Chen's one isn't a top level one) is very slightly abrasive.<br/>

Oggetto: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new katana HELP PLEASE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
hello,<br/>
     i just purchased a paul chen wind & thunder katana off ebay. it<br/>
came new in the box. when i opened it, the factory had heavily oiled it<br/>
up plus there are little woodchips from the Saya(scabbard) all over it.<br/>
I shook the Saya out as much as possible but the blade is a whole<br/>
different story. I don't want to try to clean it untill i know what i'm<br/>
doing. It came with a cleaning kit but i don't know what is for what.<br/>
anyone who has any knowledge on basic sword cleaning kits and would like<br/>
to give me a short explanation of how it all works please do so.<br/>
                                       thanks a bundle,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164136378">hi again,<br/>
     i just "cleaned" the katana. I think i did ok. the only thing that concerns me is that i don't think i used the little hammer thingy right. it's a three piece thing,....right? I unscrewed the little punch from the top and thwacked the pins out of the handle. The hammer part kept unscrewing from the handle part as i thwacked away. Plus,....when i tried to put the pins back in i bent the little punch thing and now it won't screw back into the hammer! YIKES! do you think that it was a cheap hammer or am i just doing it all wrong? Another thing,....i first took the katana apart, then wiped the oil off with that soft paper stuff, then i powdered it up, then i wiped again. I used the soft paper to re-oil it up. Was that the correct way? The tang looked a little rusty. I oiled it up a little bit. Was that bad? How do i get rid of those little rust spots on the tang? Wire wheel or brush or nothing at all? Can i use regular metal polish on the brass fittings or should i use oil? Any<br/>
 feedback would be very very greatful.<br/>
                                            Thanks again, <br/>
                                                   Mark<br/>

Clive Sinclaire <<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:CSinclaire@...">CSinclaire@...</a>> wrote:<br/>
  Mark<br/>
To clean a blade, first strip the blade of all fittings including the<br/>
habaki. The cleaning kit should contain a "powder puffer", probably on a<br/>
stick. This is called uchiko and is basically for removing oil. If the blade<br/>
is heavilly coated, take a soft cloth or tissue and remove the excess by<br/>
wiping, from the habaki area to the kissaki in one stroke. Do not make a<br/>
backwards and forwards type of motion. When most of the oil is off, tap out<br/>
the uichiko liberally onto the blade, including the mune or back edge. With<br/>
a fresh piece of cloth or paper (nugui-game may be supplied in your cleaning<br/>
kit in which case it will need crumpling up to soften it) wipe from habaki<br/>
area to kissaki, again using one stroke. Eventually this should remove all<br/>
the oil although several applications may be necessary. After studying the<br/>
now clean blade you may wish to re-oil the blade with the choji-abura that<br/>
should be supplied in the cleaning kit.<br/>
As the uichiko comes in many grades and qualities and is slightly abraisive,<br/>
be sure not to grip the blade too tightly when wiping it and always use the<br/>
single stroke method to avoid unsightly scratches. Do not apply any paper or<br/>
cloth that has touched the nakago to the rest of the blade as you may<br/>
introduce grit onto the polished surface. Never clean the nakago.<br/>
I would emphasise that this is how to use a cleaning kit on a real Japanese<br/>
sword. I have no knowledge of  Paul Chen swords but assume the same method<br/>
applies.You should always clean the sword in this way after use in Iai-do as<br/>
contact with your hands will quickly rust if not cleaned. Of course, this<br/>
does not apply to stainless steel blades.<br/>
It is a matter of personal taste as to whether a blade is kept permanently<br/>
oiled or dry. Personnely, in the UK where there is generally a moderate<br/>
climate I prefer to keep my swords dry although, I have started oiling them<br/>
for the summer months in recent years. I know that many derive great<br/>
pleasure from cleaning and oiling their swords in an almost ritualistic way.<br/>
The smell of the choji-abura (clove oil) is quite pleasant but avoid getting<br/>
into any open wounds, scratches etc as it may have an unpleasant reaction.<br/>
I hope this is of some interest.<br/>
Regards<br/>
Clive Sinclaire<br/>

Ok.   If you bent the pin, the best thing to do now is<br/>
buy a new one.   Next: never, never, NEVER; clean the<br/>
Tang.  That rust is a good indicative of how old is<br/>
your sword.   Since your sword is a very recent piece,<br/>

  Hi Mark. You don't quote if the blade has Bohi. If your blade has Bohi,<br/>
and as it's a working blade that'll see a lot of cleaning, is better to<br/>
polish inside the Bohi (ONLY this part, inside the Bohi) *from tip to<br/>
Nakago* , the reverse as the rest of the blade, because if you polish<br/>
the correct way Hi too, the result in the long time will be a change in<br/>
the polish at the very end of the Hi. As Mr. Sinclaire quoted, Uchiko<br/>
(and Paul Chen's one isn't a top level one) is very slightly abrasive.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] cleaning a new katana HELP PLEASE!!!!</h3>
by <i>Clive Sinclaire</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396178317">Mark<br/>
On an old blade there is much useful information to be found on the nakago<br/>
(tang) which may be lost through cleaning. Each school of swordsmiths shaped<br/>
their nakago in different and individual ways. Also the file marks<br/>
(yasurime) are often an indication of school, swordsmith and age. Of course,<br/>
any inscription is important as well as the natural patination of the nakago<br/>
which can indicate the age as well as wether the nakago has been interfered<br/>
with. All these things may be damaged by cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
Further, although a polished blade should never be touched with the bare<br/>
skin, for reasons that have already been given, it is quite acceptable to<br/>
hold the nakago in the naked hand. In this case the natural oils and sweat<br/>
in the skin will actually (over many years) aid the patination.<br/>
For your own peace of mind, I cannot believe you will have done any damage<br/>
in the short time you seem to have had your sword.<br/>
<br/>
As for your other question, I am afraid I cannot comment on Paul Chen swords<br/>
which I do not really class as Japanese swords. However, I can say that<br/>
swords made in the immediate pre Meiji period, the Bakamatsu period, and<br/>
which we call shinshinto (new new swords) were made to be used and that some<br/>
very fine blades were made by such swordsmiths as Masahide, Kiyomaro,<br/>
Naotane and Munetsugu. These swords were often of sturdy proportions and<br/>
attempts to opy the styles of  blades of the Kamakura and Yoshino<br/>
(Nambokucho) periods.<br/>

Ok.   If you bent the pin, the best thing to do now is<br/>
buy a new one.   Next: never, never, NEVER; clean the<br/>
Tang.  That rust is a good indicative of how old is<br/>
your sword.   Since your sword is a very recent piece,<br/>
it really does not matter to date it now... but who<br/>
knows the future.<br/>
Finally, you already buy a very beauty, expensive and<br/>
fine sword.   Do not ruin it. The only way to clean a<br/>
japanese sword is the one Mr. Sinclaire explain you.<br/>
Do not do anything diferent than that.<br/>

Do not worry. It will not damage the rest of the<br/>

Another important thing.  I do not recomend you to<br/>
untie the Tsukaito, since it is very difficult to<br/>
re-tie it properly.  There are even, people who<br/>
specialize in this matter; as there are people who<br/>
specialize in polishing blades.   Speaking of wich, do<br/>
not try to sharppen your blade, this is a very hard<br/>
thing to do.  And you can get seriously injured<br/>
trying.<br/>

  Mark<br/>
On an old blade there is much useful information to be found on the nakago<br/>
(tang) which may be lost through cleaning. Each school of swordsmiths shaped<br/>
their nakago in different and individual ways. Also the file marks<br/>
(yasurime) are often an indication of school, swordsmith and age. Of course,<br/>
any inscription is important as well as the natural patination of the nakago<br/>
which can indicate the age as well as wether the nakago has been interfered<br/>
with. All these things may be damaged by cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
Further, although a polished blade should never be touched with the bare<br/>
skin, for reasons that have already been given, it is quite acceptable to<br/>
hold the nakago in the naked hand. In this case the natural oils and sweat<br/>
in the skin will actually (over many years) aid the patination.<br/>
For your own peace of mind, I cannot believe you will have done any damage<br/>
in the short time you seem to have had your sword.<br/>
<br/>
As for your other question, I am afraid I cannot comment on Paul Chen swords<br/>
which I do not really class as Japanese swords. However, I can say that<br/>
swords made in the immediate pre Meiji period, the Bakamatsu period, and<br/>
which we call shinshinto (new new swords) were made to be used and that some<br/>
very fine blades were made by such swordsmiths as Masahide, Kiyomaro,<br/>
Naotane and Munetsugu. These swords were often of sturdy proportions and<br/>
attempts to opy the styles of  blades of the Kamakura and Yoshino<br/>
(Nambokucho) periods.<br/>
They had true hamon having gone through the quenching process and I am<br/>
unsure even if swords from China are hand made and water quenched or, in<br/>
other words, made in the traditional manner. Today, there are some 350<br/>
licensed swordsmiths making swords in Japan and they are quite strictly<br/>
controlled but all use traditional methods in order to keep the craft alive.<br/>

Remember what we both have in our hands are replicas. <br/>
They could be very well done, very beautiful to watch<br/>
and I do know for shore, they cut very well !!! But<br/>
that is what they are :<br/>
replicas.   Our swords are mostly made for Iaido and<br/>
Kendo practice, usually to practice tameshigiri.  <br/>
This, because a real sword is considered as a master<br/>
piece and in their time they were tested, so it is not<br/>
necesary to test them again.<br/>
Besides, it is unthinkable that a regualar Iaido or<br/>
Kendo Sensei will employ a real blade for this kind of<br/>
practice. ( Although I have heard that some japanese<br/>
Sensei use real blades, mostly beacause they are from<br/>
Samurai families, so a real sword is part of their<br/>
heritage ).<br/>
Also keep in mind that; is very hard that a now days<br/>
blade is very hard to be considered as made as in the<br/>
old days, even if it is hand made.   Perhaps Mr.<br/>
Sinclaire can help us here.  There are many things to<br/>
consider here :  Kinds of steel, techniques employed<br/>
in the forge process and even the enviroment<br/>
temperature and humidity plays an important role.  <br/>
And just to say someones.<br/>

<br/>
Anthony is more of an arms and armour buff than I am, so he can tell <br/>
you about armour in detail. However, there are several things that you <br/>
should take into account when writing your book. One is that chain mail <br/>
plays much less of a role in Japan than it did in England and France. <br/>
The other is what exactly is this girl doing with a military equipment <br/>
and why? Here you should pick your time period with a bit of care. A <br/>
lot of the legendary female soldiers come from the time of about the <br/>
Genpei War or the rather earlier early Imperial period. Finally, are <br/>
you more interested in writing a generic North American story dressed <br/>
up in Japanese finery, or are you interested in exploring more <br/>
typically Japanese motivations?</div>

<h3>Why no tents?</h3>
by <i>drnostrand</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293051988">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
People keep wanting documentation for Japanese tents, because they want <br/>
tents and they want them to be Japanese. However, just because you want <br/>
Japanese tents does not mean that the historical Japanese are going to <br/>
have done much if anything to oblige you. Japan is 90% mountainous and <br/>
has, to the best of my knowledge, never supported a particularly <br/>
nomadic or otherwise pastoral culture. There is even reason to believe <br/>
that the Jomon Jidai hunter gatherers were essentially sedentary. Such <br/>
people have relatively little reason to embrace tents. This is <br/>
especially true when you realize that much of Japan was thickly <br/>
forested.</div>
