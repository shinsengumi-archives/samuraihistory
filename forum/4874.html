<h3>The &quot;spears&quot; of Shizugatake</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035177447">There are seven men commonly referred to as the "Seven Spears of <br/>
Shizugatake", but I was reading a Sengoku history book at the <br/>
bookstore today, and it stated that there were really nine, but two <br/>
were killed in the battle, and so they all ended up being known as <br/>
the "Seven". Unfortunately the book gave no names.  Anyone heard of <br/>
this and know who the extra two might be?</div>
