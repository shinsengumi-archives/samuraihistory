<h3>Bushido in modern Japanese spciety</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042441198">hello!<br/>
I'm doing a research about bushido and its effect in their society. <br/>
However, I wanted to know if it stil applicable today. Is the <br/>
virtues that bushido taught the Japanese in 16th and 17th century is <br/>
still evident in the modern Japanese society? or does it instill <br/>
some of those teachings in the Japanese but have evolve and adopted <br/>
into the changes of the modern society. <br/>
I hope you'll give me some views about it. Your ideas would be <br/>
greatly appreciated and especially if its coming from people who has <br/>
knowledge about it especially if you are japanses or have relatives <br/>
who are japanese. Thank you very much.<br/>
