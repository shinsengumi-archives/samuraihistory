 </span></blockquote>You should say their current attitude since in periods Japanese history <br/>
the Buddhists showed very little tolerance for other beliefs including <br/>
other Buddhist sects!<br/>

shapes that were dressy rather than useful. If I remember correctly <br/>
George Patton redesigned it in the early 20th century so that it was a <br/>
better weapon!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is interesting about how the social aspects of being in the cavalry <br/>
vary from country to country. Being in England it's considered <br/>
prestigious, while for a long time in the US it was the province of <br/>
runaways, neer-do-wells and criminals. (My grandfather and granduncle <br/>
were in the US horse cavalry prior to WW1) Was there ever this split <br/>
between foot and horse in the various Japanese periods? Or was it just a <br/>
matter of money and usage when you used a horse?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As was the ARMY in general...same for England. Other<br/>
than your officer ranks, generally ALL soldiers in the<br/>
English Army, whether infantry or cavalry or whatever,<br/>
were from the "bottom" of society. It's just that the<br/>
ones who could ride became cavalry. As a "current"<br/>
cavalry officer, I STILL think it's the PREMIER place<br/>
to be. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just like in Europe, I would assume, in the feudal<br/>
period, if you had money, you rode. If you were poor,<br/>
you couldn't afford a horse, so you didn't. If you<br/>
look at the breakdown of what samurai were expected to<br/>
provide based on stipend, the more money, the more<br/>
horses they were supposed to provide. <br/>
