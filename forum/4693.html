Well, the answer veers off-topic, so I'll aim for brevity; but it's central<br/>
to why I've come to this list, so I'll answer:  it's a school I run,<br/>
focussing primarily on international sword arts (with a lot of offshoot<br/>
arts - naginata, for example, and a number of the kobu weapons).  I'm a<br/>
history junkie from a family of history junkies, and when I have a student<br/>
practising kenjutsu, I want it to be understood in a larger cultural<br/>
context.  My main obsession - my own Way - lies in the comparative study of<br/>
sword arts from all cultures, and the ways in which the underlying<br/>
principles manifest themselves in similarities and differences from nation<br/>
to nation and blade type to blade type.<br/>
(I found this list, for example, because I was looking for information on<br/>
16th-century samurai clothing among the lower ranks of samurai - I want an<br/>
older style of hakama than some of the modern arts practise in, because<br/>
experience from other cultures' historical clothing tells me the old hakama<br/>
and dobuku will feel different to move in.)<br/>
My particular obsession in Japanese arts is Musashi Miyamoto, and the ways<br/>
in which his Book of Five Rings represents both divergences from the main<br/>
stream of Japanese martial practises (on the one hand) and the very essence<br/>
of those practises (on the other).  So the Silk Road School practises (among<br/>
other things) a great deal of nito technique based on my imperfect<br/>
understanding and reconstruction of Musashi's niten ichi.<br/>
...All right, not so brief as I'd hoped.  But for me... pretty darned brief.<br/>
I did not come here to advertise, so anybody with further questions, or who<br/>
wants to take up the subject with me further, please feel free to contact me<br/>
off-list.<br/>
For the moment, and with an eye toward moving back onto topic, allow me to<br/>
say that it's a great pleasure to find a list with so many well-informed and<br/>
articulate contributors.  I'm new here, and I'm looking forward to learning<br/>
a great deal.<br/>
