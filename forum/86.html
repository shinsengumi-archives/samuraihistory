<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126601382">In the Japanese Language, there are plenty.  One series worth <br/>
mentioning is the "Rekishi Gunzo" series, which is a series of <br/>
Japanese history books. Each book covers a particular person, or <br/>
battle, with full color maps, pictures, and especially Genealogies.  <br/>
I found a treasure trove of Mori genealogy in the 'Mori Motonari' <br/>
Rekishi Gunzo book - It had information on not only the Mori <br/>
genealogy but on the Amako and Ouchi as well.  We actually have some <br/>
genealogies which we have translated on the Samurai Archives page: <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samurai.bigsitecity.com/clanindex.html">http://samurai.bigsitecity.com/clanindex.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Most of these only cover the 'sengoku' timeframe, and the "offline" <br/>
versions go farther back, and some are far more complete than others.<br/>
I have some in depth genealogy from (if I remember correctly) the <br/>
10th - 12th century on a few clans that a friend was able to get for <br/>
me, I believe they covered the Minamoto and Taira, but I don't have <br/>
them with me right now, (I'm at work).  I'd have to scan them into my <br/>
computer to make them available.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Be warned that Papinot is rife with errors large and small, and is a<br/>
product of its time. Unfortunately, there is nothing else in English that<br/>
is both so concise and so detailed.<br/>
<br/>
If you speak Japanese, there are many excellent sources I can point you to,<br/>
but if not, it's a bit more difficult. Any particular area or period you're<br/>
most interested in?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155278307">Hi, Tony,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your prompt reply.  I am particularly<br/>
interested in the lineages of the various mothers of<br/>
the Emperors, from the time of TEMNU TENNO up to MEIJI<br/>
TENNO.<br/>
<br/>
As you know, they usually have either a FUJIWARA or a<br/>
MINAMOTO family name.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844378902">I've added the second page of the genealogy, and will add the rest as <br/>
time permits - otherwise, you can find more emperor genealogy on <br/>
the "Ogasawara Clan Genealogy site" - <br/>

emperors of Japan.<br/>
