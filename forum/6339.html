<h3>Keiko and Kamiza</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876160551">For the samurai keiko, or practice, would be first from his father,<br/>
then from others in the han, and perhaps then, if he had the time <br/>
and the inclination he would seek out a sensei, either individually, <br/>
or enrol in a dojo.<br/>
<br/>
Central to the life of the dojo is the kamiza - the spirit corner -<br/>
one bows on entry, one bows on departure. it's the first and last <br/>
thing you do. <br/>
<br/>
The kamiza of a dojo will reference the founder of the Ryu  a<br/>
portrait, some caligraphy, anything that recollects the founder, <br/>
or founding spirit, will suffice.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever, the kamiza signifies the essence of what the ryu is about.<br/>
<br/>
The sensei, that is the principal teacher, is the embodiment of that<br/>
which is presented by the kamiza. This does not mean the sensei <br/>
is a kami, a figure of divine reverence, but the meaning of sensei is <br/>
'one who is born before', the sensei is further along the road than<br/>
his disciple.<br/>
<br/>
The stories of a disciple's devotion to his sensei are many and<br/>
legendary. Almost every ryu has some tale of such, and alongside <br/>
them are the tales of the rigours endured by the disciple along the <br/>
path at the hands of his master. Kil Bill II shows how this has<br/>
entered popular consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
(Mention should also be made of the soke - the direct descendant of<br/>
the founder. The soke is not necessarily the senior instructor, but<br/>
the superior swordsman will show all due reverence towards his soke <br/>
out of respect.)<br/>
<br/>
This relationship is founded on Shinto principle, of reverence<br/>
towards one's ancestor, be it by birth or by calling. It was later <br/>
developed by Shingon and Zen, then later again by Confucian and <br/>
Taoist principles, this last by which the Tokugawa bakafu managed to <br/>
build the cult of obligation and obedience with which to control the<br/>
fiercely independent samurai - a class marked by its vanity and its<br/>
pride.<br/>
<br/>
Towards the end of the Sengoku Zen become the language of the<br/>
swordsman's development, even if the practice was founded in Shinto, <br/>
Shingon, etc. Dave Lowry, in Autumn Lightning, expresses it thus:<br/>
<br/>
"Katsujinken, satsujinken (the sword that gives life, the sword that<br/>
destroys life) is an adage that has been brushed on inspirational<br/>
scrolls hung in Yagyu ryu dojo and on certificates and teaching <br/>
licenses awarded to its bugeisha.  It is found in the treatises<br/>
written by Munenori and others. More importantly than anywhere <br/>
else, katsujinken, satsujinken must be inscribed on the hearts of the <br/>
practitioners of the ryu. In a way, it is at the very core of what<br/>
the Yagyu tradition is all about."<br/>
<br/>
It is these structures, I think, that largely precluded the mystique<br/>
of the sword as we westerners view it. The devotion to an object<br/>
simply does not fit the mindset. The object of mystery, and the<br/>
object of the swordsman's devotion, in any literature I have read, <br/>
is always the master, be he a distant founder or one's immediate<br/>
sensei.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts on recent discussions.<br/>
