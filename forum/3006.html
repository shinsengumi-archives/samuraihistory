  Are you coming over this winter? I'm in Bangkok now but will return to <br/>
land of the "ever-sitting bureaucrat" the 11th. We could get together with <br/>
Katsu to discuss armour.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wish. I'm doing the job search thing right now, and pennies are tight. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I keep fantasizing about winning the lottery and making it all irrelevant...<br/>
<br/>
How's Bangkok after Tokyo? Does it feel like home again, or do you feel a bit <br/>
out-of-element? <G><br/>

  Out-of-element? Nah, I'm here, I'm broke,I'm in the shop, I'm to busy to <br/>
do anything but armour. Same old, same old. I go back tomorrow and greatly <br/>
look forward to it although I hate being away from my family.<br/>
  BTW, you might consider changing your pattern for a nodowa. What you have <br/>
on the website is great as a visual for what the finished product should <br/>
look like. As a pattern, with the way metal moves (even hot worked) it <br/>
doesn't work. It closes up too much in the back. I was going to make one for <br/>
Evil-Merlin but that pattern closes up so much my 5 year-old can't get it <br/>
on. I've made another pattern but run out of time to make another. (sigh)<br/>
  Well anyway, good luck on the job hunt. Talk to you later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I can understand that. If I had a family someplace I'd miss 'em in japan. <br/>
As it was, I only had my friends in Japan and no family "back home." (I had a <br/>
lot of friends in my neighborhood bar who kept threatening to "fix me up" with a <br/>
daughter or a niece. I don't know if I should have taken one of 'em up on it. <G><br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oops, you're right. That pattern is off. Sigh. I'll try to fix it as soon as I <br/>
can. Sigh....<br/>
