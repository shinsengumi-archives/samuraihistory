<br/>
Who knows who wrote it. The business about "secrets" is common to <br/>
pretty much all Tokugawa period art forms. You generally had to have <br/>
certain elements, and "secrets" was one of them,. to be licensed to <br/>
open some arts school or other in Tokugawa Japan. You were also <br/>
supposed to have a book of theory and here the more high minded the <br/>
better. Ideally, you were also "ancient". As for shinai, they were <br/>
developed so that people in schools would not actually maim and kill <br/>
each other during practices. During the Tokugawa period, the samurai <br/>
mostly became petty burocrats. Some of them did perform police <br/>
functions, but that was about it.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't really in the interest of the Tokugawa Bakufu for 10% of the <br/>
population to constitute an effective fighting force.</div>

	Training in the sword these days, at least with Iaido, is primarily  <br/>
training for encounters in an urban setting against one or a handful  <br/>
of attackers. If you are perceptive enough one can winnow out the  <br/>
core combative techniques that would apply in a battlefield encounter.<br/>
	We may train on flat level ground, most days, but what we are  <br/>
building is a foundation for a proper cut delivered with all the  <br/>
strength of the bodys' musculature behind it. Technique discovered on  <br/>
the battlefield, but refined for generations by serious swordsmen.<br/>
	It is easy enough to train in different settings, changing elements  <br/>
like adding overhead obstructions, even so the "programming" should  <br/>
kick in and in spite of the obstruction the best possible strike will  <br/>
be delivered.<br/>
	There are schools like the Yagyu Shingan ryu that practice  <br/>
battlefield technique in armour, Their forms include strikes to the  <br/>
vulnerable areas of Japanese armour and grappling. I am certain they  <br/>
practice most of the time on flat level ground and probably use foam  <br/>
mats too. Few if any would argue that they are not authentic.<br/>

<br/>
	I believe that schools of swordsmanship followed similar paths of  <br/>
development in other places. Combat techniques were refined and  <br/>
stylized and the mystique of the swordsman grew in importance. I  <br/>
think if you'll look deeply into the questions you raise here you'll  <br/>
see that among the 400 and more schools you mention that many have no  <br/>
spiritual connections and teach only technique. Most place an  <br/>
emphasis on etiquette as a means to guarantee  safety within the  <br/>
dojo. However there are those that focus deeply on the teachings of  <br/>
zen buddhism or connexions to Shinto gods. After-all many of the  <br/>
great swordsmen at the end of the age of battles developed their  <br/>
mastery in pursuit of spiritual development. I am not really sure how  <br/>
it is a bad thing to wish to behave in a gentlemanly fashion and to  <br/>
seek to enrich ones spirit.<br/>
	There are good and bad teachers, and unscrupulous people in all  <br/>
ages. You have to choose your path carefully in all things. If you  <br/>
have lived in Japan then you will be familiar with the surprising  <br/>
number of frauds and wannabees there, samurai culture is a commodity  <br/>
to some, even in the land of the samurai.<br/>
	It seems that you have a poor opinion of Kendo as well. One could  <br/>
argue that many Kendo-ka today lack the spirit and physical toughness  <br/>
of the swordsmen of say the rough and tumble Bakumatsu period.  <br/>
However if lyou ook closely at the practice today the top Kendo-ka  <br/>
demonstrate more speed, power and technique than has been seen  <br/>
before. The rules and technique have been refined, and the athletes  <br/>
groomed from childhood, in the same way as world-class sports  <br/>
figures. Just as todays football players run, hit and throw better  <br/>
than players past, todays top level Kendo-ka are arguably faster,  <br/>
keener and stronger than their predecessors.<br/>
	One wonders where Ijin you have faced a naked blade and the fear of  <br/>
death? There is death everywhere even if we don't go about toting  <br/>
swords any longer.<br/>
<br/>
>       I posted this to show one reason the samurai became weak and<br/>

<br/>
	If you know your history, you will know that throughout the period  <br/>
we suppose the samurai as a class became weak, there were elements  <br/>
within it that studied western science and military technology. These  <br/>
men and their students emerged as leaders with the strength of ideas  <br/>
to oppose western encroachment even as the upper structure of samurai  <br/>
society was collapsing.<br/>
	In the world of swordsmanship also, there were fads and fashions but  <br/>
it seems that the practical won out in the end; Jigen Ryu, Hokushin  <br/>
Itto Ryu and Eishin Ryu are known to us because their techniques were  <br/>
tested in the streets of Kyoto and on the battlefields of the  <br/>
restoration war.<br/>
	Many of the restoration leaders were dojo mates or known to each  <br/>
other from fencing cicles. So when the time came for strength, for  <br/>
"men of spirit" to lead the country they were to be found among the  <br/>
martial artists...<br/>

Swords are over-rated. You are better off with either: a matchlock, a <br/>
bow, a naginata, or a yari as your primary weapon. Also, free-for-alls <br/>
are not something that classical and medieval strategists were <br/>
particularly fond of. Free-for-all approaches came about largely after <br/>
the development of modern firearms when tacticians realized that they <br/>
did not have to mass troops in order to mass strength. If you look at <br/>
battle paintings from Japan you will notice that unless a route is in <br/>
progress that you generally see troops on both sides drawn up in some <br/>
sort of skirmish line or other. Incidentally, battle paintings from the <br/>
Sengogku period pretty clearly show massed formations using similar <br/>
weapons. Think the battle scenes in Kagemusha except in 400 year old <br/>
paintings. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I know swords are over-rated on the battle feild and that the yari were the primary weapons. I myself use a spear in training sometimes, but a sword is just easyer to use (not all the time tho). As for the free-for-all after the Battle of Sekigahara the losers were hunted by the refugee hunters and they were just farmers and other villagers who village had been destoryed by the samurai fighting. So they really didnt care about one-on-one fights they justed wanted the rewards and must of them were armed with bamboo spears. And what I was talking about before was modern swordsmanship and how the poeple who study it would fair in a environment like that. And pictures aren't always true. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I recall you had criticized organized martial arts<br/>
and stated something about how life in the battlefield<br/>
was far more dangerous since the opponents were not in<br/>
a nice comfy dojo play training with each other. Let<br/>
me tell you friend fighting is fighting and usually it<br/>
ends with death if no one breaks it up. And why would<br/>
you want to face a blade anyways. Growing up, in the<br/>
slums of New Jersey I learned from early on to run<br/>
rather than face anyone with a weapon, even if you are<br/>
an experienced fighter. Save the dramatics for Steven<br/>
Segal, he gets paid for it. You don't want to be<br/>
stabbed, it doesn't feel nice. Believe me I have been.<br/>
I'm a former slum kid. Don't focus so much on being<br/>
thought a tough person but rather a level headed one.<br/>
No offense but how old are you, man? Glory is just a<br/>
word man and really nothing more.<br/>
