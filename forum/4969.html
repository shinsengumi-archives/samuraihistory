<h3>Seppuku</h3>
by <i>msr_iaidoka</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-147732521">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
  As for the weapon used for seppuku it was usually a tanto (knife) or, if <br/>
no tanto was available, a wakizashi (short sword) with cloth wrapped around <br/>
the lower part of the blade to keep from slicing open your hands.  The <br/>
angle(s) of the cut to the stomach are highly debatable but the most common <br/>
one that I have seen is horizontally left to right then vertically up the <br/>
center into the heart.  The general idea is to do this without showing the <br/>
pain that this would be causing.<br/>
  The assistant has the most important job.  He watches over the one <br/>
performing the seppuku and if he sees the man about to lose face by giving <br/>
into his pain he decapitates him immediately.  If the one performing seppuku <br/>
manages to go through the whole procedure then the second decapites him to <br/>
end his misery.  The decapitation must be done just right or else the head <br/>
will roll away and disgrace both men.  Ideally the neck must be cut and the <br/>
head drop down into the lap.<br/>
  Muso Shinden Ryu, an Iaido (swordsmanship) style, teaches the proper <br/>
methods and technique of being a second.<br/>
  Just my two sense on seppuku.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>

Much too much is made of "the" ceremony of seppuku. There are <br/>
relatively few first hand accounts of this kind of ceremony. What <br/>

particulars.<br/>
<br/>
I think that our modern notions of the seppuku ceremony are <br/>
tremendously impacted by the fact that seppuku was formally outlawed <br/>
in the Tokugawa period. It seems to me that the ceremony became a <br/>
kind of romanticized part of the warrior past; made to look more <br/>
uniform than it actually was.<br/>

<br/>
 It's my understanding that the angles are pretty limited by <br/>
biology and physics - there's not much debate in what I've read <br/>
about the angle per se that has to be taken.<br/>
<br/>
If by debatable angles, you mean there are various ways that seppuku <br/>
was actually done then yes I agree. It appears that the most "popular" <br/>
cuts were the ichimonji which is the cut straight across from left to <br/>
right, and the juumonji, which is the 'cross' cut you describe <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>

Tell that to the guy slicing his gut open. :)<br/>

<br/>
This again is a bit stylized. As the seppuku ceremony evolved and <br/>
changed, there were cases where instead of a sword, a fan was placed <br/>
in front of the person committing seppuku. In other words there was <br/>
not a bit of the ideal described above. The man was trotted out and <br/>
his head sliced off without any opportunity to show his bravery.<br/>
<br/>
There are said to be over 50 ways that this could play out: i.e., with <br/>
a second (kaishaku) or not; straight cut or cross cut; further <br/>
stabbing of the throat, or heart, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, just like most things in life, there was no one way <br/>
that seppuku (or even more broadly, ritualized suicide) was, ehem, <br/>
executed. It's a complicated picture that surely had an idealized, <br/>
romantic, stylized archtype. But the reality that we can see via <br/>
historical record doesn't necessary match that archtype.<br/>

	as you say there were any number of ways for this to be done, many of <br/>
the different styles were developed to take into account rank and <br/>
priviledge, the circumstances of the "crime" and  any number of other <br/>
factors. In the case mentioned above I think it is wrong to say there <br/>
was no opportunity to display ones courage. My understanding of the use <br/>
of the fan was that it was often used for ladies or persons of high <br/>
rank who weren't expected to perform the same rough ceremony of the <br/>
rank and file soldier. Whether man or woman by reaching for the fan one <br/>
signalled for all to see their sincere intent to cut themselves, there <br/>
was no further need for a demonstration and the coup de grace was <br/>
delivered.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm interested in this statement as A.B.Mitford in Tales of Old Japan <br/>
relates being a witness to what he calls hara-kiri - a judicial execution <br/>
on the orders of the Mikado in Hyogo in 1868. He also describes other <br/>
similar executions of the same period of a hatamoto, a daimyo's <br/>
retainer and a daimyo. ('translated from the Japanese" he tells us). Of <br/>
course Mitford is often seen in hindsight to have slightly <br/>
misunderstood what was going on (a familiar feeling in Japan!), but his <br/>
description is quite vivid and moving.<br/>
<br/>
And what I've read on the Choshu daimyo of the same period indicates <br/>
that there was a real fear they would be called on to commit ritual <br/>
suicide, presumably by seppuku, for their offences against the shogun <br/>
and the Emperor.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know when seppuku was made illegal? Or is it still legally <br/>
permitted along with other forms of suicide?</div>

familiar with the case you mention. But the edict banning seppuku <br/>
was published in 1663 by the 4th Tokugawa Shogun, Ietsuna. To be <br/>
precise it is actually all ritual suicide (junshi) that was outlawed, <br/>
not seppuku only.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, there were numerous exceptions to this edict, but as far <br/>
as I can tell it was never formally repealed.<br/>
<br/>
Might it be that in 1868 - after the formal close of the Bakufu - the <br/>
laws established by the Bakufu were now obsolete and seppuku was now b<br/>
ack in play, or at least the status was now unclear?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Correct me if I'm wrong, Jay, but junshi does not<br/>
equal seppuku, and seppuku does not equal junshi. The<br/>
definition of junshi, as I understand it, is the<br/>
specific act of suicide (usually seppuku) committed by<br/>
a retainer upon the death, natural or otherwise, of<br/>
his lord. Junshi was committed by 'loyal' retainers<br/>
who felt they couldn't serve another master. The<br/>
Bakufu's point in outlawing junshi was that the<br/>
daimyo's heir needed experienced counselors, etc, to<br/>
maintain the government of the han, and if they all<br/>
killed themselves upon the death of the daimyo, there<br/>
would be no governmental continuity and the han would<br/>
suffer. <br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't make sense to outlaw the act of punishment<br/>
 (i.e. seppuku) the bakufu used to punish it's own<br/>
retainers. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, junshi seemed to have been 'legal', though the<br/>
whole counry was shocked when Gen. Nogi and his wife<br/>
committed junshi in 1910 following the death of<br/>
Meiji-Tenno. But they still revered him enough to<br/>
build a shrine, name an area, and a subway stop<br/>
(Nogizaka) after him...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Junshi is a bit of a tricky word. It certainly holds the meaning <br/>
that you describe above. It also is used to refer to ritual <br/>
suicide in a looser way. It is my understanding - and I could be <br/>
wrong - that the edict from Ietsugu was meant to stop all forms of <br/>
ritual suicide not just the one you describe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Agreed. Although I'm not keen on Edo history, this has always been <br/>
an interesting thing to me. It has always struck me that the Bakufu <br/>
outlawed (or prohibited) seppuku, but felt comfortable making <br/>
exceptions to the edict whenever the circumstnaces made sense. But <br/>
maybe I've been interpreting the situation incorrectly?<br/>

have to do a little research. Can you send me the<br/>

I'll see if I can dig up the original and figure this<br/>
out. <br/>

As to your other question - Ietsuna&#12288;&#23478;&#32177; (not Ietsugu - I was gonig <br/>
