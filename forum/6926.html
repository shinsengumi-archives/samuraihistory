<h3>Kitabatake Chikafusa&#39;s Jinno Shotoki (Chronicle of Gods and Sovereigns)</h3>
by <i>Haynes, A (Angus)</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-197805674">Anyone have an opinion on this book, the Columbia University<br/>
translation? I have an interest in Chikafusa, however the book is only<br/>
available in hardcover, and so is quite pricey... does it contain enough<br/>
worthwhile information to justify the price?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Angus<br/>
