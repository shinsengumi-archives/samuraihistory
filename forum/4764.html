None of those things you mentioned are actually<br/>
"ranks". I know it's confusing, but I'll try to help.<br/>
<br/>
Emperor isn't a rank--you don't get "promoted" to it.<br/>
It's a JOB, really. A hereditary one. <br/>
<br/>
Shogun, also, isn't a rank--not in the sense of a<br/>
court rank, which is what was being discussed. Kampaku<br/>
also isn't a "rank", it's a job. Ieyasu didn't<br/>
necessarily "outrank" Hideyoshi because he made it to<br/>
Shogun and Hideyoshi was Kampaku--the two are<br/>
essentially seperate entitites, with little or no<br/>
ties. <br/>
<br/>
Daimyo, again, is a description of someone's military,<br/>
economic, and political status, but not necessarily a<br/>
"rank". A daimyo was a daimyo was a daimyo, whether<br/>
you held 15,000 koku in Sado, or 3 million koku in the<br/>
Kanto--you were still a daimyo. What mattered was your<br/>
income and military strength. <br/>
<br/>
Taisho, again, is translated as general, but not in<br/>
the "Brigadier General, Major General, etc." sense. It<br/>
means someone who led a large group of soldiers into<br/>
battle. If you led 1,000 or 15,000, you were a taisho<br/>
either way. It describes someone who led the<br/>
troops--in other words, like the rest, a job.<br/>
<br/>
Ranks, as we mean with "lower second rank", were ranks<br/>
according to the imperial ranking system devised in<br/>
the Heian period. I'm by no means an expert--actually,<br/>
I know very little. However, there were various<br/>
gradations of rank, and each gradation was further<br/>
subdivided into lower, middle, and upper. So you could<br/>
be of "Lower 5th rank", but that was more impressive<br/>
than someone of "Upper 7th rank". <br/>
<br/>
Tony's website, www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany <br/>
has a pretty good explanation on this, much better<br/>
than I could do. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
