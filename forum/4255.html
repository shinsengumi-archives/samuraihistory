	Are we talking existance or extinction? Samurai really existed, many <br/>
of the tales are just tales but many are true.The samurai as a <br/>
political class were abolished but they are not "extinct." There was <br/>
quite a lot of discussion on this subject not long ago right here on <br/>
this list. A lot of the influential families are still around but the <br/>
power now resides elsewhere. The traditions and costume may yet be seen <br/>
today but no one is living the life of a samurai...I am sure you have <br/>
heard all this before.The archive, linked above, is a really great <br/>
place to get info, and don't forget the gear!<br/>
