 </span></blockquote>Interesting choice of words. What period (specifically) do you <br/>
define as "classical"? When you say "before Heike" do you mean <br/>
"before the setting of the Heike Monogatari"? Or do you mean before <br/>
the Taira clan itself existed? Are you looking in English, Japanese, <br/>
or other languages?<br/>
<br/>
The question "when did the samurai first come about" could be one <br/>
that you never really get answered. It depends on what you mean (and <br/>
what the people who reply to you mean) by the word.<br/>
<br/>
An anectode: the first known use of the word 'bushi' 武士 was from a <br/>
proclomation from Emperor Genmei, in 721. But there is no reason to <br/>
think that this use of 'bushi' really equates to samurai per se - <br/>
it's rather thought to be something more like a generic "warrior".<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Find "History of Japan to 1334" by George Sansom. It's<br/>
volume 1 of a 3 volume history of Japan, by one of the<br/>
best. <br/>
<br/>
Also, try "Hired Swords: The Rise of Private Warrior<br/>
Power in Japan" by Karl Friday if you want to know<br/>
about how the samurai class came about. <br/>
<br/>
