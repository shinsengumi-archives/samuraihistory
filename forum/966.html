<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893389657">Mitsuhide might have just wanted power, but the fact that Nobunaga sacrificed Mitsuhide's mother might have had something to do with it.  Mitsuhide got the holders of some castle to come out to negotiate by giving over his mother to them as a hostage.  Nobunaga promptly had them all exectued.  Of course, Mitsuhide's mother was then killed in retaliation.  Mitsuhide probably justifiably held Nobunaga at fault for that.<br/>
