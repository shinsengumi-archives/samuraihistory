<h3>Looking for Uesugi and Takeda prints</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100270805">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I've been looking for quite some time for prints of Uesugi and Takeda.  <br/>
There are 2 in particular that I've been after but I can't seem to find any <br/>
website or local store (Kansas City, MO) to purchase.  The Uesugi print <br/>
shows him facing forward on a stool, he has a mostache in this print.  It <br/>
looks rather basic, I'm sorry that I can't describe it any better but it's <br/>
been a long time since I've seen a picture of it and don't remember the <br/>
details.  The Takeda print shows him facing away on a deerskin stool looking <br/>
at Mt. Fuji.  He's wearing a red cape.  If anyone knows where I could shop <br/>
in this area, or point me to a webstore, I'd appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
