<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365942468">I know it's a novel, but you may want to try to get a hold of a copy of a <br/>
book called "Taiko" by Eiji Yoshikawa.  The copy I have is from the <br/>
University of Massachusetts Library and it's about 30 years old, so it may be <br/>
rather difficult to come by.  From what little I've perused it, it was good <br/>
-- good reading and good in terms of background info -- and may offer some <br/>
ground-level insight to how (some) people lived during that time period, but <br/>
I haven't read it all, even though I intend to at some point real soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207128716">I've read Eiji Yoshikawa's "Taiko" many times over, and enjoyed it very<br/>
much... but beware using it as a historical resource. Though based strongly<br/>
on events of history (and I myself use it a lot to remind myself of events<br/>
that I've read about extensively elsewhere), it is still *fiction*, and as<br/>
thus it presents a very idealized version of Hideyoshi and those involved in<br/>
his cause. You may notice upon completing the novel that it ends after<br/>
Hideyoshi negotiates peace with Ieyasu, thus leaving out later events such<br/>
as Hideyoshi's two disasterous attempts at invading Korea, his obsessive and<br/>
even irrational affection for his heir Hideyori, and his condemnation of the<br/>
famous tea master Sen no Rikyu, among other things.<br/>
<br/>
This is no criticism of "Taiko", though. I absolutely love the book, it's<br/>
one of my favorite reads of all time! But take it for what it is... an<br/>
enjoyable novel based on, but not necessarily accurately representing, the<br/>
facts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It shouldn't be too hard to find.  Last time I was at the local Borders they had <br/>
_Taiko_ and not _Musashi_.  I loved _Musashi_, but had a hard time getting into <br/>
_Taiko_.  I've read about half of it twice.  I don't know whether it's the <br/>
translation or what.  <br/>
Anyway, how the Samurai affected society is not like asking "how did the <br/>
discovery o gold in California affect society in the US." (weird example I know)  <br/>
The Samurai were not an external force shaping society, they were part of the <br/>
society.  You really need to ask more specific questions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420391872">Hello,<br/>
Thank you for your reply.<br/>
After agreeing to help my son with this, I found myself lost in information.<br/>
I was dumbfounded.<br/>
I asked him what kind of evil teacher would give a child a task like this.<br/>
He said "I just made up the subject myself"<br/>
Everything in the world has a reason. Perhaps the experts should look at the <br/>
effects of the Samurai on society. Was it good? Bad? Etc.<br/>
some say they intimidated and murdered. He says they taught them Zen<br/>
Interesting topic, don't you think?<br/>
Lacking information, he is just making up something so he can get his paper <br/>
finished and a good grade.<br/>
If you experts would like any input on the matter the paper will be presented <br/>
12-8-02<br/>
I think it's a very important history lesson and would not like to see anyone <br/>
get the wrong information.<br/>
Thanks For your help ~Ray~<br/>

<h3>Re: How the Samurai effected society</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-806146687">I think it's problematic to classify the effect of Samurai on <br/>
Japanese Society to be good or bad.  As in any warrior class or <br/>
military group; you have both good and bead individuals.  There were <br/>
some Samurai that intimidated and murdered.  There were others that <br/>
we well known for being sophisticated and artful.  <br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to say that Samurai affected Japanese Society because <br/>
they were very much a product of society.  Japanese society today <br/>
still has some "Samurai" values incorperated and ingrained in their <br/>
image as individuals and society accepted group behavior.  I'm not an <br/>
expert but even after the Meiji Restoration (when the Emperor crushed <br/>
the Samurai class and returned Military power to the throne) Samurai <br/>
values were still important to the Japanese.  <br/>
<br/>
If you wanted to talk about the ways that Samurai values have <br/>
survived into modern Japan, I'd discuss the ideas of honor, chivalry, <br/>
service, and ferocity in battle(in the business world now).<br/>
<br/>
The Samurai were a wide and varied class of warriors.  There were low <br/>
Class Ashigaru to the very high class Nobles.  But I think that the <br/>
conditions the Japanese were subjected to caused a unique <br/>
specialization of the feudal system.  The harsh weather, constent <br/>
internal military conflict, and repeated invasion attempts, changed <br/>
the Samurai and Japanese culture both.  They can't quite be seperated <br/>
because the occured simultaniously.  To simplify; until the lat 1800s <br/>
(Meiji Restoration) they were the same.  Samurai ruled the society at <br/>
that time and the Samurai Culture was Japanese Culture.<br/>

Society effected the Samurai more than the Samurai effected society.<br/>
