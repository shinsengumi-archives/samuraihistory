<h3>Who out of the three unifiers can be claimed as the ultimate military conqueror?</h3>
by <i>burmileche</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752210013">I am currently studying Japanese history at University and was wondering who out of the three unifiers Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu was more militarily astute and could be crowned as the ultimate military leader amongst the three? Are there any examples to suggest why either is the ultimate unifier because of their military conquests? Also what military conquests and battles highlight the Sengoku periods including these three daimyo? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058115610">Of course, the big battle for Ieyasu was Sekigahara in 1600...  This is the campaign Clavell fictionalized in SHOGUN as "Crimson Sky."  Lots written about it.  The battle at Nagashino (1575) in which Takeda Katsuyori laid seige to Nagashino castle also demonstrated some of Nobunaga's cunning (and his decision to buy firearms from the Portugese)...  <br/>

by <i>strategos_02</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600543970">Sekigahara 1600<br/>
Location: Gifu Province, Japan<br/>
Type of Battle:Extended meeting engagement<br/>
Combatants: Western Army commanded by Ishida Mitsunari. Eastern Army commanded by Tokugawa Ieyasu, assisted by Kobuayawaka Hideaki<br/>
Result:A resounding victory for Tokugawa faction, leading to eventual victory in the Sengoku Jidai – a long series of civil wars.<br/>
Accessiblity:Good, by rail and road<br/>
Other: Battlefield monument, museum and ‘Warland’ battle theme park with excellent display of arms and armour. Shrine to the defeated Western Samurai near railway station. <br/>
<br/>
Introduction <br/>
Japan in the 16th Century was torn apart by almost continuous civil war between rival clans and<br/>
their daimyo, or warlords, each<br/>
seeking to establish a military governorship of the islands with the title ‘Shogun’. <br/>
Ruling over them all was the<br/>
semi-divine Emperor, who legimitised temporal power by his presence, but took<br/>
very little part in day-to-day politics. Some families by clever political<br/>
intrigue had managed to elevate themselves to high status social rank, and<br/>
establish governorship over large areas of Japan. By the later 16th century chief among these clan leaders were Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen,<br/>
Uesegi Kenshin, Toyotomi Hiyedoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. From 1573 onwards, Oda<br/>
had established control over most of the islands, but was murdered in 1583 by<br/>
rebellious followers. He was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who became ruler<br/>
of most of the country and established his capital at Kyoto, with Osaka Castle<br/>
as his chief fortress. On his death in 1598  a regency for his infant son was established<br/>
under Tokugawa Ieyasu, Maeda Toshiie, Uesegi Kagekatsu, Mori Terumoto and Ukita Hideie, each vying with the other<br/>
for supremacy. It was a poisonous mixture that could only lead to further<br/>
bloodshed.<br/>
Soon Tokugawa Ieyasu had<br/>
attracted by far the largest number of followers and tried to set himself up as<br/>
heir to the Hideyoshi shogunate on the death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599. Faced by<br/>
potential risings on every quarter, Ieyasu left Osaka with the bulk of his<br/>
troops to menace the Uesegi clan. His enemies gathered an enormous force of<br/>
128,000 men, mostly from the Western part of Japan, hence known as the ‘Western<br/>
Army’. They camped around the pass of Sekigahara in October 1600, east of<br/>
Kyoto, in order to try conclusions with the ambitious Ieyasu.<br/>
<br/>
The Battle <br/>
Ieyasu had received intelligence of his enemy’s intentions,<br/>
and knew that Kobayakawa Hideaki was prepared to come over to his side, along<br/>
with all his samurai and ashigaru,<br/>
the ordinary foot soldiers. Early in the morning of 21 October Ieyasu’s forces<br/>
moved into the attack and after some delay Hideaki’s forces treacherously<br/>
joined the general melee against his erstwhile allies.<br/>
Outnumbered and outflanked, Mitsunari fled and his troops<br/>
surrendered – about 9,00had been slaughtered on the field. Soon afterwards<br/>
Ieyasu was able to assume the regency, hunting down  Mitsunari and having him executed. Ieyasu set<br/>
up his capital at Edo, the site of  modern Tokyo, and in 1603 was appointed Shogun by the emperor. Rivalry<br/>
with the Toyotomi clan brought further conflict at Osaka in 1615, but the the<br/>
Tukugawa Shogunate remained in place and lasted after the death of Ieyasu until<br/>
1867, overseeing a lengthy period of peace and stability. Under the aegis of<br/>
the Tokugawa shoguns, the warrior elite of Japan turned their energies to less<br/>
warlike pursuits, becoming loyal servants of the state.<br/>
<br/>
Sekigahara Today <br/>
The Tokugawa camp is now the site of a public park<br/>
opposite the town’s museum, where there is a significant collection of arms and<br/>
armour from the time of the battle. Extensive battlefield trails exist for<br/>
walkers to explore the area, and the kessen-ba,<br/>
the site of the final denouement of the fighting, is marked by a stone obelisk.<br/>
The entire site can be viewed from Mount Sasao after a brisk walk, where Ishida<br/>
had his camp. Opposite here, the slopes of Mount Matsuo give a panoramic view<br/>
of the battlefield from the point of view of Kobayakawa Hideyaki.<br/>
<br/>
Sekigahara ‘Warland’ is a modern theme park near the<br/>
battle field with plaster statues of various warriors in authentic poses, and<br/>
while this will not necessarily appeal to everyone, it does house a very<br/>
impressive display of armour of the period.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733870541">When I visited in... 2003, I checked out the Odani ruins and the Anegawa "battle site".  The land in that area is really beautiful, but there was not (at the time) too much preservation or many displays.  Supposedly there may have been some renovation of the site(s) since then.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Gifu was a really great site.  I loved the sky cable car I had to take to get to the top, and you could see how powerful of a position the castle was.  This great little mountain surrounded by lush fields and a nearby river (or at least that's how I remember it).<br/>
<br/>
I also saw Nagahama.  It was nice, nothing special.  The best part of Nagahama was a map they had inside the castle showing the locations of other important castles (and how far away they were).  It really hit home that the big players were fighting over very small stretches of land--and the major castles were often no more than a day or two apart (by horse) and no more than a few hours away by car.<br/>
<br/>
I skipped Sekigahara (train went by it) because it looked toooo touristy.  I like to be able to explore on my own, and my japanese was good enough back then to talk with the occasional random person when I got lost or confused.<br/>

Subject: [samuraihistory] Who out of the three unifiers can be claimed as the ultimate military conqueror?<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
I am currently studying Japanese history at University and was wondering who out of the three unifiers Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu was more militarily astute and could be crowned as the ultimate military leader amongst the three? Are there any examples to suggest why either is the ultimate unifier because of their military conquests? Also what military conquests and battles highlight the Sengoku periods including these three daimyo? <br/>
<br/>
Help would be much appreciated... Cheers! <br/>
