Sorry to clutter your emails but since some of you might be interested:<br/>
<br/>
I have several well painted 28mm Samurai armies going up for sale soon. The figures are individually mounted and each army can have either Takeda or Uesugi sashimonos on each warrior. They are a base line 2500 point WAB army but you can add additional weapons options to bring it up to 3000 points or configure it to play games with fewer points. Contact me off line if you are interested.<br/>

2 Samurai Cavalry units (6 each) (or 1 unit of 12)<br/>
2 Samurai Infantry units (15 each)<br/>
4 Ashigaru units (20 each)<br/>
