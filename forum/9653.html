<br/>
That is a difficult question because Japan was isolated from the outside world for such a long period of time. There is really not much to compare outside of a few brief conflicts including the Mongol invasions (which aren't an accurate comparison really) and Hideyoshi's foray in Korea. I guess you could also mention a few conflicts with pirates if you wanted to be picky. Any comparison to the warriors of Japan and other groups would make for an excellent thesis though.<br/>
<br/>
If I may throw out some ideas though... Their unique blend of religious/social beliefs, sword making/use, years of armed conflict and civil wars (practice, you might say), a "Spartan-like" mentality regarding death (in some cases). Of course, we all know what happened when these great warriors met up with a more technologically advanced force in the mid-late 1800's. <br/>
<br/>
An alternative question might be... What made Japan a successful warrior nation? It did survive for a long period of time, and the Tokugawa regime lasted "peacefully" for more than 250 years. <br/>
<br/>
Just a few thoughts... An interesting question.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182447572">Although all of us are here because of varying degrees of interest <br/>
in samurai I think that your question is a little subjective. It <br/>
depends on in what way you consider them superior, and when compared <br/>
to who? Many of us are familiar with the whole samurai v. knight <br/>
debate. I would like to make a suggestion though. I suggest that you <br/>
look at samurai from within the proper historical and cultural <br/>
context rather than trying to compare them to others. There is <br/>
always someone that will top who ever you think is the best in some <br/>
form. Plus, a lot of what lead to the idea of the samurai being so <br/>
much greater than say their western couterparts was very very <br/>
heavily influenced by 19th century romaticism. Just for an example. <br/>
A lot of people talk about how dedicated and loyal samurai were. <br/>
That they would rather die then give off even the slightest <br/>
impression of slacking in their duties or rebellion. Once again this <br/>
was influence by 19th romanticizing of the samurai. For much of <br/>
their history most samurai were oppurtunists. They fought for their <br/>
lord as long as it was in their best interests to do so, or out of <br/>
fear of what would happen if they did not. During the Sengoku period <br/>
there was not the horrible stigma if a samurai changed sides that <br/>
would later be applied during peace time. It was not uncommon for <br/>
warriors who were defeated in battle to be offered employment by the <br/>
victor. This is not something horrible for the time. It is simply <br/>
the way most,if not all, known feudal societies.which were <br/>
inherantly fractured, functioned.</div>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] What made japan a superior warrior nation?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281043610">Chris, I am not meaning to rain on your parade with my evaluation of your question. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But I am afraid that, "What made japan a superior warrior nation?" or even Jonathan's "What made Japan a successful warrior nation?", both are subjective. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Were the Japanese warriors "superior" and was Japan a "successful warrior nation"?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just think that the question could be aimed more to encourage discovery rather than controversy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My suggested alternative topic would be:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
"What created the Samurai warrior class in Japan." <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What were the major historical points of change in the development the character this institution of ancient Japanese culture. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who, what, where, when, and how did this all happen?<br/>

  In all honesty, I don't think that they were a superior warrior nation.<br/>
<br/>
  I believe that the warrior ethic of unquestioned loyalty that preferred death to failure was, however noble sounding, the undoing of the Japanese in dealing with the rest of the world.<br/>
<br/>
  They had long lived grand feudal societies because of their physical isolation, and brutal swift justice systems that maintained them. But these enabling factors did not produce a warrior class superior to any other.<br/>
<br/>
  There are many other reasons to study and admire the Samurai, and the culture that created them. But comparing them as individuals or as a national body, to those of any other nation, will only bring you to similarities, not superiorities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647603240">To Chris, in that light, I think the Heien period is an essential<br/>
period to see how the Samurai came to be in a political sense--this of<br/>
course wasn't where their martial arts were developed, but I think it<br/>
is still an important period to see the origins of the class...<br/>
<br/>
Also, for the origins of other such things like their martial arts, I<br/>
can't recall any sources or periods to look into other than to look at<br/>
the origins of how the traditional Japanese sword was developed. which<br/>
would shed light on their preferred method of war; which was to use<br/>
the bow. Either way, I don't know full well what I'm talking about,<br/>
maybe someone can take over: Their old martial art was the way of the<br/>
horse and the bow, but I was under the impression that horses were not<br/>
present in Japan until after the Mongol invasion... This just hit me.<br/>
<br/>
**ended up with questions rather than answers**<br/>
