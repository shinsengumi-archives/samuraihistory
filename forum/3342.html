<h3>Rules and restrictions for the samurai in edojidai</h3>
by <i>Karsten Helmholz</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488417179">Dear members of the list,<br/>
please excuse my bad english. As you will see it is not my native language.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to your group and I would like to ask for your support on the following matter.<br/>
The other day I had a discussion on the rules and restrictions the samurai faced in daily life concerning the use of swords. The guy I was talking to insisted on the idea, that they were forbidden by law to draw their swords, unless told to by their superiors.<br/>
My point was that there were only resctrictions to the drawing of swords on certain occasions like being at the shoguns palace or in the court. I guess there are many more times when it was forbidden but those are the points that instantly came to my mind. I think that apart from that, there were no laws that restricted the drawing or the use of the sword. One example here would be kirisute gomen. <br/>
My request to the members of this list would be to name any kind of source that proves my point as I don´t want to rely only on one or two sources I have at hand right now. I can use english, german, french or japanese texts. Especially original sources or their modern day transcriptions would be great (i.e. osadamegaki, buke shohatto). Any help will be appreciated. <br/>
Thank you very much for your time<br/>

	You are quite correct in your thinking, unfortunately I haven't a clue <br/>
as to which source might support your idea. I have good references for <br/>
everyday life but they to be cursory in their explanations and <br/>
definitions. I think you'll need access to a Japanese Public Library to <br/>
find what you are looking for.<br/>
	BTW I think your name is quite manly and virile sounding...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128232828">Hello,<br/>
I am a little confused about this list. Some days ago I posted a question<br/>
here and so far only received one answer. Although two others reacted to it,<br/>
it was not abut the question. Maybe it was the way I asked, maybe nobody<br/>
knows anything to help me. Just in case some of you overread it I give it<br/>
anopther try:<br/>
<br/>
The other day I had a discussion on the rules and restrictions the samurai<br/>
faced in daily life concerning the use of swords. The guy I was talking to<br/>
insisted on the idea, that they were forbidden by law to draw their swords,<br/>
unless told to by their superiors.<br/>

	I don't think people are ignoring you, you have to keep in mind that <br/>
everyday law in Tokugawa Japan is a B****H to research. The one place I <br/>
would look is in the Tokugawa Nikki, this is volumes and volumes of <br/>
daily record from the Tokugawa bakufu. If you do not know the year and <br/>
date of the item you are looking for there is no way to find it, there <br/>
is no index. Even if you have a date you may have to look thru pages <br/>
and pages to find your entry. I spent days in the library attempting <br/>
this and in the end it wasn't worth the effort. There may be something <br/>
at the National Library in Tokyo that will speed a search like this but <br/>
you have to be in Tokyo. The information is out there but you really <br/>
have to want it...<br/>

"prove that UFOs don't exist"). Tell your friend to find citations for his point.<br/>

thank you for your mail. I see your point. I think I settled the thing for<br/>
now anyway. The thread the whole thing took place in got really quiet since<br/>
i came up with some minor citations to prove my point.<br/>
That of course doens´t mean that I lost the interest in finding material to<br/>
have a closer look on jurisdiction and laws concerning those of samurai<br/>
status in the edo-period.<br/>
So if anyone has further material on that (perhaps a little easier), please<br/>
don´t hesitate...<br/>

in the legal researches done by the Japanese lawers or<br/>
scholars might help rather than the historical<br/>
research sources.<br/>
Although the law structures after the Japanese<br/>

Edo period, the civil or criminal cases relevant to<br/>
the drawing or the use of swords in the early moder<br/>
time transition period may exist.<br/>
