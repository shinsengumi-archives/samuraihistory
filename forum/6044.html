<h3>Essay on the relationship of Bushido and Karate</h3>
by <i>luke berryman</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017221810">To all.<br/>
What follows is an essay which I have writen on this subject, it will contain extracts and quotes from books, interviews and websites. Please take the time to read it as I have gone to a lot of trouble to get it finished. Please enjoy.<br/>
 <br/>
The JKA of which I belong to their branch in the UK the JKAE has long had an association with the old samurai traits. Master Funakoshi's father was a Samurai from a long family of Samurai and so his style incorporated these ideals. As a young boy he studied under his grandfather in the Chinese classics and the Japanese Classics. He studied Taoism, Confucianism as well as Zen and undoutbably Bushido. This all formulated into the Shotokan style of Karate, in 1949 the JKA was born from him and master Nakayama and other promonent masters such as Taiji Kase, Kanazawa and others besides. The JKA and Master Funakoshi developed the Dojo Kun and the 20 Precepts both of which have a strong influence from Bushido.<br/>
The following is an extract from the JKA website directly;<br/>
"True karate is based on Bushido. In true karate, the body, mind and<br/>
spiritthe whole personmust be developed simultaneously. Through kihon, kumite and kata we learn to control our movements. But more im-<br/>
portantly, we learn to give up con-<br/>
trol too. We can perform the tech-<br/>
niques without thinking about them, and remain focused without having<br/>
to concentrate on any one thing. In essence, the body remembers how<br/>
to move and the mind remembers<br/>
how to be still.<br/>
<br/>
This harmonious unity of mind and body is intensely powerful. Even the greatest physical strength and skill are no match for the power of wholeness.<br/>
<br/>
The result of true karate is natural, effortless action, and the confidence, humility, openness and peace only possible through perfect unity of mind and body. This is the core teaching of Zen, the basis of Bushido, and the  of the JKAs karate philosophy"<br/>
This is evident in many texts. In the western world we expect thing to be there infront of us, however with most eastern philosophy and in particular Ja[anese Zen philosophy it is hiden and can only be revealed through intensive study of the chosen art. Some similarities are clear to see, such as undying discipline and concentration. Similarties have been noticed by myself between Karate and Iaido the philosophies and the influences therein. I will follow uo with another extract from JKA website;<br/>
  <br/>
"Bushido has been the samurai code of conduct in Japan for centuries. Based firmly on the teachings of Zen, Bushido was intended to help the samurai master their nature and understand their minds and the uni-<br/>
verse through direct experienceas well as through fostering strength, self-control and wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Bushido is based on seven essential principles:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
seigi : The right decision and rectitude<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
yuki : Bravery and heroism<br/>
<br/>
3.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
jin: Compassion and benevolence to all<br/>
<br/>
4.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
reigi : Courtesy and right action<br/>
<br/>
5.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
makoto: Truthfulness and utter sincerity<br/>
<br/>
6.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
meiyo: Honor and glory<br/>
<br/>
7.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
chugi: Devotion and loyalty<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Martial spirit and courage were, of course, essential aspects of Bushido. But for the samurai, Bushido's highest goal was complete virtue in thought and action. Each samurai followed a carefully-designed regimen of polite ceremony and etiquette intended to promote such virtue. With its emphasis on prescribed form, Bushido helped the samurai harmonize mind with body, enabling them to maintain a certain calmness, or heijoshin (literally, "ordinary everyday mind"), even in the face of hardship. Sincerity, kindness, honesty, filial piety and honor all formed part of the core of Bushido. And they were the seed from which the karate tradition grew. These attributes, and the wisdom, understanding and peaceful strength they promote, are some of karate's greatest benefits. They are also among Japan's greatest gifts to the world."<br/>
<br/>
So this is from the experts themselves so why do you argue?<br/>
<br/>
The last extract from JKA now as I know you must be getting bored; These are the 20 Precepts as laid down by Funakoshi sensei.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"1.  <br/>
Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)2.There is no first attack in karate 3.Karate supports righteousness4.First understand yourself, then understand others5.The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique6.The mind needs to be freed7.Trouble is born of negligence8.Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo9.Karate training requires a lifetime10.Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness12.Genuine karate is like hot water; it cools down if you do not keep on heating it12.Do not think of winning; you must think of not losing13.Transform yourself according to the opponent14.The outcome of the fight depends on one's control15.Imagine one's arms and legs as swords16.Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies17.Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions18.Do the kata correctly; the real fight is a<br/>
 different matter19.Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique20.  <br/>
Always be good at the application of everything that you have learned."<br/>
<br/>
Sensei Ohta , head of JKAE has been disgusted by the reaction of some people to the fact that Karate is related to Bushido and the Samurai. He says that the influence of Bushido is in every Japanese art as is Zen.<br/>
