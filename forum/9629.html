<h3>New Japanese History Discussion Group</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-455211823">The Samurai Archives forum ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forums.samurai-archives.com">http://forums.samurai-archives.com</a> ) is<br/>
implementing a private discussion group for (approximately) monthly<br/>
discussions on specific aspects and personalities of Japanese history. <br/>
Previous discussions include the following:<br/>
<br/>
2006<br/>
1. December 1st-December 31st: Kofun<br/>
<br/>
2007<br/>
1. January 5th-February 5th: The 47 Ronin<br/>
2. February 10th-March 10th: The Shinsengumi<br/>
3. March 15th-April 15th: Sakamoto Ryoma<br/>
4. June 1st-July 1st: Samurai Films and Thier Remakes <br/>
<br/>
In order to join the group, there is a one time multiple-choice<br/>
history test. Once the test is passed, you will be granted permanent<br/>
access to the private forum. The test consists of 50 multiple choice<br/>
questions. A score of 45/50 is required to pass and gain access, and<br/>
you will have 24 hours to complete the test. If you fail, you must<br/>
wait 10 days before re-taking the test. To take the test, join the<br/>
forum and see this thread:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forums.samurai-archives.com/viewtopic.php?t=2518">http://forums.samurai-archives.com/viewtopic.php?t=2518</a><br/>
Of course, you are free to join and participate in the public forums<br/>
without taking the test.<br/>
<br/>
The next discussion will be "Hideyoshi's Korean Invasions",<br/>
12/1/07-12/31/07. A reading list and some academic articles will be<br/>
provided.<br/>
<br/>
Members have the option of volunteering to moderate and run discussion<br/>
groups on their interests.</div>

<h3>[Hanwei Yari</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425689019">Greetings All,<br/>
<br/>
I run a tiny Japanese historical re-enactment society here in the UK, <br/>
and to date all of our weapons have been custom made, as the mass <br/>
produced stuff has simply not been up to standard.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I was chatting with a chap name Hector Cole, a well known <br/>
blade smith here in the UK, who is about to make us a batch of authentic <br/>
arrowheads (yanone), when the subject of Yari came up.<br/>
<br/>
My original plan was to contact Thom Richardson and Ian Bottomley (Royal <br/>
Armouries) for advice, diagrams and photo's for Hector to work from, but <br/>
I decided to do a Google search first.<br/>
<br/>
I found that Hanwei (Paul Chen) now offer two Yari, one with a longer <br/>
blade, but plain fittings, and the other shorter, but with rattan <br/>
bindings. Can anyone advise me as to the pro's, con's and quality of <br/>
these yari? Are they worth considering or are they better avoided?<br/>
<br/>
Here's the US source:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.casiberia.com/product_details.asp?id=SH2312">http://www.casiberia.com/product_details.asp?id=SH2312</a><br/>
<br/>
In the past nothing I've seen from these folks has peaked my interest, <br/>
until now. I confess that due to design and quality issues I've not <br/>
looked at their stuff for years, but I'd be happy to be pleasantly <br/>
surprised.<br/>
<br/>
Price wise I've seen these Yari on sale via UK websites from 230 - 450 <br/>
GB pounds. So, does anyone know of a good UK supplier, just in case?<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, my thought is:  most yari weren't necessarily made to as<br/>
stringent a standard as swords, were they?  They aren't usually<br/>
thought as highly of and though there are exceptions, many are fairly<br/>
unremarkable, that I've seen.  That would seem to make it just right<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The yari I've had a chance to examine in the past at museums etc. did <br/>
indeed vary wildly in terms of quality. The issue for us with replicas <br/>
is their authenticity. We're not looking for perfect copies with <br/>
properly folded blades and real urushi lacquer, but Hanwei have a habit <br/>
of cutting really big corners, for example in terms of  the materials <br/>
use, such as plastic and aluminium etc.<br/>
<br/>
After a bit more wandering around the web, I've so far failed to find <br/>
out anything about the materials used for such things as the haft, which <br/>
judging from the wording of some reviews may not be made of wood as it <br/>
should be.<br/>
<br/>
So unless anyone can advise me differently, it's back to plan "A":-(<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input.<br/>

You're absolutely right!...I read and responded to the topic half-awake and rushing out the door to work, and in my haste to reply did not yet check the link YOU provided.Since you opened with arrowheads and I am no expert in Japanese weaponry I assumed the"ri" in yari was modifying the "ya" meaning arrow and was related aspect or specific type of arrowhead, rather than simply spear...
