<h3>Interesting Story in Navy News</h3>
by <i>jimhathaway2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485647269">I saw this item yesterday on Navy News, and thought it might be of <br/>
interest-<br/>
<br/>
From USS Kitty Hawk Public Affairs<br/>
<br/>
USS KITTY HAWK (NNS) -- Famous Japanese swordmaker, Yoshi Yoshihara, <br/>
and Vice Adm. Tsutomo Tamura, president of the Japan Maritime Self <br/>
Defense Force (JMSDF) Staff College, saw firsthand the U.S. Navy's <br/>
quality craftsmanship in action when they visited USS Kitty Hawk (CV <br/>
63) March 7. <br/>
<br/>
Tamura and Yoshihara were invited to visit Commander, Fleet <br/>
Activities, Yokosuka and Kitty Hawk by Rear Adm. James D. Kelly, <br/>
commander, Naval Forces Japan. Kelly, who has a deep interest in the <br/>
Japanese culture and swordmaking, was eager to have Tamura and <br/>
Yoshihara visit and see what U.S. 7th Fleet American Sailors do.<br/>
<br/>
"It was a great honor to have Vice Adm. Tamura and Mr. Yoshihara <br/>
aboard Kitty Hawk," said Capt. Ed McNamee, Kitty Hawk commanding <br/>
officer, who led the tour.<br/>
<br/>
McNamee kicked off the ship tour with a brief in Kitty Hawk's combat <br/>
direction center. Following the brief, the group visited the ship's <br/>
flight deck.<br/>
<br/>
"Because the ship is undergoing maintenance right now, it was a <br/>
great opportunity to show off a lot of work being done by our <br/>
Sailors, Japanese contractors and Ship's Repair Facility (SRF) <br/>
personnel," said McNamee.<br/>
<br/>
Following a tour of the flight deck, Tamura and Yoshihara visited <br/>
the ship's No. 4 Main Machinery Room.<br/>
<br/>
"I didn't know how many Sailors it takes to keep a ship this size <br/>
operating, such as on the flight deck and in engineering," said <br/>
Yoshihara.<br/>
<br/>
"It was a great honor to have Vice Adm. Tamura and a craftsman of <br/>
Mr.Yoshihara's caliber visit our propulsion plant," said Capt. Pete <br/>
Schupp, Kitty Hawk's chief engineer.<br/>
<br/>
Schupp, along with McNamee, led Tamura and Yoshihara to see No. 4 <br/>
main condenser in the process of being re-tubed, a significant <br/>
amount of maintenance on a boiler water drum. <br/>
<br/>
"We're currently undergoing considerable work, so we had the <br/>
opportunity to highlight the work of our Japanese contractors, SRF <br/>
workers, and Kitty Hawk Sailors," Schupp added.<br/>
<br/>
"I was surprised to learn and see how young most of the Sailors are <br/>
aboard the ship," said Yoshihara. <br/>
<br/>
Born in 1945, Yoshihara started making swords at the age of 12. <br/>
Since then he has become recognized as one of Japan's finest master <br/>
swordmakers. <br/>
<br/>
"There was much I didn't know about the closeness of the cooperation <br/>
between the JMSDF and the U.S. Navy," said Yoshihara, "and how much <br/>
work our Sailors do together."<br/>
<br/>
The Kitty Hawk Strike Group is the largest carrier strike group in <br/>
the Navy and is composed of the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, Carrier <br/>
Air Wing (CVW) 5, the guided-missile cruisers USS Chancellorsville <br/>
(CG 62) and USS Cowpens (CG 63), and Destroyer Squadron 15. <br/>
