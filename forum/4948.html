 </span></blockquote>7 pages of hits on Yahoo (English), but 50% of them<br/>
were about the anime "Ranma 1/2", which apparently has<br/>
one character named Soun and one named Hojo. Who knew?<br/>
<br/>
The other range from, well, SAMURAI-ARCHIVES.COM (I<br/>
was really tempted to post THAT for you, he he) to<br/>
some pages claiming Hojo Soun was a model samurai and<br/>
a textbook practitioner of Bushido (this from the same<br/>
site that COMPLETELY butchers the Chushingura<br/>
story--did you know the 47 ronin killed the Shogun?<br/>
It's true--I saw it on the web). One excerpt I found<br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
" 1507-51 <br/>
 <br/>
A typical Sengoku daimyo, who rose by his wits <br/>
<br/>
Soun founded the 'later' Hojo. This clan is to be<br/>
distinguished from the Hojo of the Kamukura Period.<br/>
His original name was Ise Shinkur�, but he took the<br/>
tonsure and assumed a monk's name, Soun. He was<br/>
probably born into the Ise family of Kyoto, although<br/>
this is not certain and details are unclear. In the<br/>
Sengoku Period there were many who rose to prominence<br/>
from humble beginnings, and so whose early life is not<br/>
recorded. Skill in war assured such men a place among<br/>
the 'upstart' daimyo class. <br/>
Soun won the trust of the Imagawa when he interceded<br/>
in their internal familial disputes. He was given<br/>
charge of Kokokuji Castle, which had a strategic<br/>
location guarding the Kanto. In 1491, he built<br/>
Nirayama Castle to reside in. Soun gained control of<br/>
Izu, and took Odawara Castle in Sagami, thus mounting<br/>
the first step in the unification of the Kanto. He<br/>
organised the development of towns around his castles,<br/>
conducted land surveys, and laying the foundations of<br/>
long-lasting rule. <br/>
In 1518, control of his house was usurped by Hojo<br/>
Ujitsuna. Soun died the following year at Nirayama<br/>
aged 88. He was regarded as a calm and honest man who<br/>
would rather govern in peace than attack, and he is<br/>
said to have been love by his people. He rose from<br/>
being a nameless wanderer to being the master of the<br/>
entire states of Izu and Sagami through his wits, and<br/>
his efforts ensured Hojo rule for five generations and<br/>
over a century. He was also a man of great physical<br/>
beauty, without which none of this might have been<br/>
possible."<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sengoku-expo.net/text/person/E/172.html">http://www.sengoku-expo.net/text/person/E/172.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I wasn't aware that Soun's son, Ujitsuna, "usurped"<br/>
power. Takeda Shingen, yeah, he usurped power from his<br/>
father. My recollection is that Soun retired while he<br/>
could "mentor" his son, and that became a practice in<br/>
the Go-Hojo family. <br/>
<br/>
I'm next going to hit Japanese Google, but I think you<br/>
may be out of luck when YOUR website is the best<br/>
source on the web in English--fabulous accomplishment,<br/>
but it's not going to help YOUR knowledge that much!<br/>

 </span></blockquote> From "100 Selected Japanese Generals" edited by Wakamori Taro pg. 136<br/>
<br/>
	The Izu campaign began long before the death of Masatomo. After the <br/>
death of Imagawa Yoshitada (1480) there ensued a power struggle between <br/>
Ise Nagauji (Hojo Soun) , Nagauji's son, and Nagauji's cousin, when <br/>
this spilled over into Izu, Horikoshi Gosho Ashikaga Masatomo called in <br/>
the Ogigayatsu and Uesugi (really two branches of the Uesugi). Nagauji <br/>
sent them packing and thru his influence placed Imagawa's son Ryuomaru <br/>
at the head of the family and he became his regent and lord of 12 <br/>
counties. Nagauji desiring to pursue his ambitions upon the Kanto, <br/>
struck into Izu (1493)to punish Chachamaru for assasinating his <br/>
father(1491), which proved the perfect excuse for his actions.<br/>
<br/>
	A very free translation BTW, but it is clear Wakamori at least saw it <br/>
as pure ambition on Soun's part and the campaign to punish Chachamaru <br/>
was a thin veil adopted to give legitimacy to his move...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That's odd because a book I found at the library today "Sengoku <br/>
Bushou Retsuden #3" Printed in 1989, specifically says that Masatomo <br/>
died of illness in 1491 (Quite a concept, get a library card in <br/>
Japan, and you have free reign over the 1,000-odd book on the <br/>
Sengoku - I should have thought of that one earlier).  The two that I <br/>
currently own (the one previously cited and one I picked up today but <br/>
dont have with me) basically say something to the effect of "after <br/>
the death of Masatomo in 1491, Chachamaru killed his younger half-<br/>
brother and his (the younger half brother's) mother.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Japanese internet sources I have seen in the past <br/>
made it look like he was killed by Chachamaru.</div>

town and wanted a card, and they gave me one.  Either a case of small-<br/>

  For the National library you don't need a card just ID(no books leave the <br/>
building). The computer filing system is ..............unpleasant. The card <br/>
catalog is rather strange as well. '81 on is all katakana, roughly '45-'81 <br/>
is katakana for foreign books hiragana for japanese, '00-'45 is dewy decimal <br/>
system (I think), before 00 is just strange.<br/>
  Lots of well lit pleasant reading rooms though.<br/>

Thanks. The National Library is the one over by the<br/>
Kokkaigijido, correct? <br/>
<br/>
I'll be heading to the Harajuku library probably this<br/>
weekend, to try to get the card. We'll see how it<br/>
goes. <br/>
