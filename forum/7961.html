<div id="ygrps-yiv-443105053">Yes, Its a Chinese copy and poorly made too. The  swastikas are not<br/>
swastikas .  They are the reverse of the German swastikas. In Japan, it<br/>
is a<br/>
Buddhist symbol. They are also found in the Southwest area of the United<br/>
States on Indian pottery. Japanese swordsmiths never did gold engraving<br/>
on<br/>
blades. Again, it is not worth the trouble to restore it since it is<br/>
badly<br/>
made.<br/>

Sooo,What are you trying to tell us? Were you going to show this Sword or<br/>
what?  Kee...<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 No, not at all. It's not my sword, and I hadn't seen one like it. He<br/>
didn't pay that much for it, so it's unfortunate, but at least someone is<br/>
able to tell the difference. I haven't held it, or seen it in person, and<br/>
just wanted to know what the story was about it, not having seen one<br/>
before, like that. I think my Iaito is also a Taiwan blade, not worth a<br/>
lot, but it was a gift from my Sensei, so that's all it needs to be for<br/>
me. This one, my friend just picked up at some sale in the West Bottoms<br/>
in Kansas City. Does anyone know what the reverse swatstikas signify? I<br/>
hadn't seen them, either, but then, I don't do a lot of looking, a sword<br/>
is not something I'm into collecting, if it isn't functional, it's not<br/>
worth much to me. It's too bad, I think he had hoped it was a treasure,<br/>
but that's clearly not the case. <br/>
I really appreciate the information, though. I have no investment<br/>
emotionally or financially, in the katana, but I promised him I'd ask til<br/>
I found out what the story about the sword was. As a friend. It's great<br/>
that there are so many knowledgeable people on this list, I got nowhere<br/>
asking on E Budo. My sincere thanks to you that helped me with the<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
sincerely<br/>

Your sword is likely of Chinese or South-Asian manufacture as has been<br/>
said. The inlay suggest south Asia as this was popular there. The inclusion<br/>
of a date is also very interesting though all the kanji cannot be made out<br/>
from the photo.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I am an expert but what this looks like is what is known as an<br/>
occupied territory sword. Swords made in the areas occupied by the Japanese<br/>
before and during the Pacific War made by local craftsmen with local<br/>
materials after the Japanese fashion. The very same techniques used then<br/>
are being applied now to make the knock-offs we so often from Chinese<br/>
sellers. This looks like it may in fact be older (40 or 50 years) but<br/>
someone has clearly gussied up the scabbard and etched the blade (hence the<br/>
very visible striations). The tsuba looks like a charcoal brick because it<br/>
has been burnt, likely in an attempt to age it artificially. Also the sharp<br/>
angle of the kissaki is a bad sign, not likely the blade was originally<br/>
Japanese but if it were the value is lost because the tip would have to be<br/>
drastically reshaped to save it.<br/>
<br/>
Key questions are; what does the tang of the blade look like and what are<br/>
the kanji given in the date? Clearly this is not treasure to sword<br/>
collectors but may be an interesting bit of history and not just pure and<br/>
simple fakery.<br/>

I believe that the "manji" is a depiction of the "wheel of life" hence its significance as a <br/>
Buddhist symbol. Actually, you will find the swastika of both orientations used in this sort <br/>
of context in quite a few places across Asia over a remarkably long period. Or so I recall. <br/>
While orientation is significant in Japanese kamon, it does not make the opposite <br/>
orientation in any way impossible for use as a kamon. First time visitors to Nara may be <br/>
taken back to find a swastika on all of the manhole covers in the city. This has no political <br/>
significance beyond the manji being the traditional civic symbol for Nara.</div>

<h3>Buddhist &#39;Manji&#39;</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914774131">"I believe that the "manji" is a depiction of the "wheel of life" hence <br/>

The wheel of life (the Dharma Wheel) is eight spoked-it's not <br/>
a 'swastika' (manji). The swastika was called the 'wheel of the sun' <br/>
and was around before Buddhism came into being, being an auspicious <br/>
symbol in many cultures of Asia. It was adopted by Buddhism and besides <br/>
the 'heart and mind' of Buddha, it it also used to signify the <br/>
footprints of Buddha in Japan.<br/>
We have a small shrine out in front of our house in Kyoto and when <br/>
showing a picture of our home to American friends, the first thing they <br/>
always want to know about is the 'swastika'. Kyoto is loaded with them, <br/>
just like Nara ^_^.</div>

<h3>Re: Buddhist &#39;Manji&#39;</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742218626">Here are some more interesting meanings for the 'manji' (Buddhist swastika) courtesy of Alternative Religions.com:<br/>
"The swastika used in Buddhist art and scripture is known as a manji (whirlwind), and represents Dharma, universal harmony, and the balance of opposites. It is derived from the Hindu religious swastika, but it is not identical in meaning. <br/>
The Manji is made up of several elements- a vertical axis representing the joining of heaven and earth, a horizontal axis representing the connection of yin and yang, and the four arms, representing movement- the whirling force created by the interaction of these elements.<br/>
When facing left, it is the Omote (front facing) Manji, representing love and mercy. Facing right, it represents strength and intelligence, and is called the Ura (rear facing) Manji. <br/>
In Zen Buddhism, the Manji represents the ideal harmony between love and intellect."<br/>
     I found it interesting that even though the manji is not the wheel of Dharma, it still represents part of the concept. The manji also seemingly has different meanings for different Japanese sects (which really shouldn't surprise me, but does).</div>

<br/>
I do not doubt that you will find plenty of interpretations of the <br/>
manji in Japan. You will find interesting interpretations for gasho as <br/>
well. However, as someone already pointed out, the symbol itself is old <br/>
and, as I recall, can be found in Iran before the historical buddha was <br/>
born. That said, its incorporation into Buddhism is probably rather <br/>
more straightforward than being suggested by some here. While sun <br/>
symbolism could link the maji with Amaterasu in Japan, the symbol <br/>
itself appears to have come across from the continent.</div>
