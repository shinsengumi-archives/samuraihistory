Japanese emperors: Between the people and the gods<br/>
<br/>
By HUGH CORTAZZI<br/>
<br/>
ENIGMA OF THE EMPERORS: Sacred Subservience in Japanese History, by<br/>
Ben-Ami Shillony, Global Oriental, 2005, 312 pp., (cloth).<br/>
<br/>
This well-researched and scholarly study by Ben-Ami Shillony of the<br/>
Hebrew University of Jerusalem will interest not only students of<br/>
Japanese history but also all those concerned for the future of the<br/>
Imperial institution in Japan. The book, which evolved out of earlier<br/>
research first published in Japanese under the title of "Haha Naru<br/>
Tenno," covers the political, cultural and religious background to the<br/>
"emperor" system in Japan from mythological times down to the present<br/>
day. I have put the term "emperor" in quotes as whatever else they<br/>
were, Japanese emperors were never equivalent to emperors in China or<br/>
Russia. Nor were they ever emperors in the Roman sense of the term<br/>
"imperator" or generalissimo.<br/>
<br/>
Shillony emphasizes that "The political weakness of the Japanese<br/>
emperors was balanced by the extraordinary stability of their dynasty.<br/>
The effete emperors occupied an unchallenged throne. An emperor could<br/>
be deposed, exiled or even murdered, but his institution could never<br/>
be abolished and his family could not be replaced."<br/>
<br/>
He concludes that the "strange survival" of the dynasty was due to the<br/>
fact that Japanese emperors combined sanctity with passivity to such<br/>
an extent that they were "too subservient to rule, but too sacred to<br/>
be deposed." These conclusions are based on his study of how the<br/>
emperors behaved over the centuries.<br/>
<br/>
The author has much to say about the divinity of the emperors. He<br/>
points out that in Japan the "kami," which is generally translated as<br/>
"god," were transcendental beings. The term could be applied to any<br/>
dead person, object or natural phenomenon. He notes the differences<br/>
between the divinity ascribed to Japanese emperors to that ascribed to<br/>
the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and notes the stress laid in Europe on<br/>
the "divine right of kings" resulting from their claim to be God's<br/>
representative on earth carrying out His orders.<br/>
<br/>
The emperor in Japan was not the representative of the kami but "an<br/>
intermediary between the people and the gods." He was venerated but<br/>
not worshipped. However his body was regarded as "sacred and neither<br/>
knives nor scissors could be applied to it." This seems to have been<br/>
one of the causes of the high rate of infant mortality in the imperial<br/>
family down to the 20th century.<br/>
<br/>
Shillony discusses in detail the occasions during which women were<br/>
ruling empresses. There seem to have been shaman queens in early times<br/>
but the first person to hold the title of "tenno" (The Emperor) was<br/>
the Empress Suiko in 593. Between that time and 770, six women were<br/>
titular empresses, but the last of these, Koken-Shotoku, was a<br/>
controversial figure and there no titular empresses until the Tokugawa<br/>
Era. One reason for this was the influence of Confucian attitudes<br/>
adopted by the Japanese; these gave precedence to men and led to male<br/>
chauvinism, which is still a strong element in Japanese culture today.<br/>
<br/>
We tend to think that Japanese emperors since the end of the 6th<br/>
century have always been called tenno but as Shillony points out,<br/>
various different terms have been used over the ages. The old Japanese<br/>
title for emperor was "sumera mikoto." According to the Yoro code of<br/>
718, "tenno" was to be used in imperial rescripts, "tenshi" in<br/>
ceremonies, "kotei" in correspondence with "barbarians"' and "heika"<br/>
in addressing the emperor. At the beginning of the Meiji Era, the term<br/>
"mikado" was in general use when the English title of "emperor" was<br/>
adopted to give the Meiji Emperor an equivalent status to that of the<br/>
sovereigns of China, Russia, Germany, France (at the time of Napoleon<br/>
III) and Britain (Queen Victoria had been proclaimed Empress of India).<br/>
<br/>
Shillony points out that the continuation of the Imperial dynasty<br/>
depended on the birth of sufficient sons in the family. "To avert<br/>
biological extinction, the emperors had to have access to many noble<br/>
and fertile women." Even so sometimes the succession was remote,<br/>
although the ancestral chain was never apparently broken. The Meiji<br/>
Emperor had 15 children by various concubines but only five survived.<br/>
The Showa Emperor was not prepared to follow his grandfather's example<br/>
and the practice thus ended in the 20th century. After World War II,<br/>
the collateral branches of the Imperial family, which could provide a<br/>
successor, were abolished.<br/>
<br/>
In the last 40 years there have been no male children born into what<br/>
has become a very limited Imperial family. This has made it necessary<br/>
to consider the possibility of a female eventually once again becoming<br/>
the tenno. This would not require a constitutional amendment but it<br/>
would require a change to the Imperial House Law. At present Imperial<br/>
princesses cease to be "imperial" when they marry, and for some<br/>
Japanese the adoption of a matrilineal line of succession instead of a<br/>
patrilineal could be a sticking point. It would also lead to the end<br/>
of the unreasonable pressure apparently still being placed by Imperial<br/>
Household officials on the Crown Princess to produce a male heir.<br/>
<br/>
Shillony considers that the most important issue for the continuance<br/>
of the Imperial institution is to ensure its continued relevance for<br/>
Japanese people. In 1977, while he was Crown Prince, the present<br/>
Emperor declared: "When we look at the tradition of the Imperial<br/>
family, we see that it is mainly a tradition of gakumon (learning) and<br/>
not of bu (fighting). Very few emperors donned military uniforms. I<br/>
would like to continue this tradition . . . The phenomenon of symbol<br/>
emperors is not a postwar creation. In my view, the emperors have been<br/>
symbols since antiquity." This may well be the case, but at least the<br/>
emperor should be accepted by the Constitution as "head of state" as<br/>
in practice he has been by foreign countries to which he has paid<br/>
state visits.<br/>
<br/>
A "symbol" also needs to be able to fulfill a meaningful role and not<br/>
be totally hedged about by Imperial Household bureaucrats. Shillony<br/>
thinks that the Imperial family might regain relevance through its<br/>
support for the protection of the environment and he suggests that:<br/>
"The archaic rites of the Japanese emperor [e.g. in relation to<br/>
Japan's rice culture], which for a long time have been a source of<br/>
embarrassment to modern-minded Japanese, may in the future appear as a<br/>
symbolic ceremony of paying tribute to mother nature." Perhaps so, but<br/>
while we do not need or want to see the Imperial family becoming a<br/>
more frequent source of scandal and gossip as has happened to the<br/>
royal family in Britain, Japan's Imperial institution would benefit<br/>
from a more open culture.<br/>
<br/>
A beginning was made when the present Crown Prince stayed in Britain<br/>
as a student at Oxford from 1983-85. This showed him how ordinary<br/>
people lived and enabled him to gain a better understanding of the<br/>
world around him. His memoir "Thames to tomo ni," which will be<br/>
published in English later this year under the title "The Thames and<br/>
I," reveals his natural human charm and sense of humor. Perhaps it was<br/>
this fact that led the Imperial Household to delay for many years<br/>
permission for a translation.<br/>
<br/>
Hugh Cortazzi, a former career diplomat, served as Britain's<br/>
ambassador to Japan from 1980 to 1984. He translated "The Thames and<br/>
I," which will be published later this year by Global Oriental.<br/>
