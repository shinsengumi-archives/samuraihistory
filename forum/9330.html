<div id="ygrps-yiv-224196717">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I need help on something important, its for a short movie im making... <br/>
I was wondering if any of you could help me out.<br/>
<br/>
My story involves two boys undertaking lessons from a sensei near <br/>
Kyoto, what i need to know is was there any sort of trial or test to <br/>
see which one learned more than the other and claim his sword when he <br/>
passed?</div>
