<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865050294">Here is what I have for Ukita Hideie (1572-1662):<br/>
<br/>
(Much of this comes from the "Sengoku Biographical Dictionary," <br/>
Nishimura Keiko, Abe Takeshi, 2000 as well as the "offline" samurai <br/>
registry we've been working on for too many years now)<br/>
<br/>
Titles: Chûnagon, Sangi <br/>
Battles: 1st Korean Campaign (1593-94), 2nd Korean Campaign (1597-<br/>
98), Odawara Campaign (1590), Sekigahara (1600) <br/>
<br/>
Hidie was a son of Ukita Naoie and was largely raised by Toyotomi <br/>
Hideyoshi as something of a protegé. He recieved the title of <br/>
Chûnagon in 1594 and acted as overall commander 'on the ground' in <br/>
the 2nd Korean Campaign. He served as one of the five regents (San-<br/>
tairo) following Hideyoshi's death in 1598 and from Okayama Castle <br/>
ruled over Bizen, Mimasaka, and part of Bitchû (yielding an income <br/>
of around 575,000 koku). He sided with Ishida Mitsunari in 1600 and <br/>
commanded 17,000 troops at the Battle of Sekigahara (the largest <br/>
loyal - and active - 'western' contingent present). The Ukita troops <br/>
fought very well in the battle but were overwelmed when attacked by <br/>
the turncoat Kobayakawa Hideaki. Following the general defeat of <br/>
Mitsunari's army, Hidie went into hiding, seeking refuge with the <br/>
Shimazu. In 1603 he was revealed by Shimazu Iehisa and Tokugawa <br/>
Ieyasu at first ordered his execution. That sentence was reduced to <br/>
exile, and Hideie died at the age of 90 on Hachijô Island - possibly <br/>
the last of the Toyotomi-era daimyô to die.<br/>
<br/>
Ukita Hideie's mother was Housenni (Died 12/11/1594) - She was <br/>
originally the wife of Miura Sadamune. When Sadamune died in 1565, <br/>
she became the wife of Naoie.<br/>
Hideie's wife was the fourth daughter of Maeda Toshiie and Matsu.<br/>
