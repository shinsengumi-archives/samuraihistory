<h3>Sono Toki.... Oda Nobunaga and Saito Dosan</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-294990060">Just finished watching this weeks episode of "Sono toki rekishi ga <br/>
ugoita".  It examined the relationship between Oda Nobunaga and Saito <br/>
Dosan, as well as the 4 years leading up to Nobunaga's invasion of <br/>
Mino.  It said recent scholarship points to Nobunaga being heavily <br/>
influenced by Dosan (as opposed to his father, Oda Nobutora), who was <br/>
very brutal in his own right.  Definately an interesting show, anyone <br/>
with NHK should take a look, although next week is Lawrence of <br/>
Arabia...</div>
