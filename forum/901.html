<div id="ygrps-yiv-636534111">I would like to know how can I find info about a ronin by the name <br/>
KawaKami GenSan , that fought for the Meiji during the Bakumatsu.<br/>
<br/>
He was a superb swordsman of the Shiranui Ryu school and seems to <br/>
have been killed after the restoration by his former allies (he <br/>
wasn't satisfied with the Meiji politics).<br/>
<br/>
Any information about he or his school, or means to get it, will be <br/>
greatly welcome.<br/>
