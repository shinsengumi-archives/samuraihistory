<h3>Mikatagahara - Year Fought</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465499424">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I was surfing the web looking for info on Mikatagahara and it left me <br/>
unclear on the year it was fought. About 50% of the sites I looked at <br/>
said it was 1572 and the other half said 1573. Does anyone know why <br/>
this is and what year the battle was actually fought?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>

 </span></blockquote>It depends on if you are talking "Japanese" years or "western" <br/>
years.  "6th day of the first month of 1573" in "Japanese" reckoning <br/>
falls sometime near the end of 1572 (or vice versa - I don't remember <br/>
which was ahead of which).</div>

 </span></blockquote>...in fact, when we first started the Samurai Archives, we didn't <br/>
discriminate between the two, so a lot of it is mixed between Japanese <br/>
and western dates.  This intro to the biographical dictionary (which <br/>
used mostly contemporary Japanese dates) helps to explain:<br/>
<br/>
DATES <br/>
Most dates are given in their western equivalents for the sake of <br/>
clarity for western readers. However, when dates are listed by their <br/>
contemporary reckoning, they are given as follows: era name and the <br/>
year of that era, followed by the month and day, thus, Eiroku-3 6/1 <br/>
would be the 1st day of the 6th month of the 3rd year of Eiroku. Eiroku-<br/>
3 6 would indicate the 6th month of the 3rd year of Eiroku. Where a <br/>
month alone is indicated, e.g., the 10th month, that, too, is to be <br/>
considered by the contemporary reckoning (and not, in this case, <br/>
October by the Gregorian calendar.) There really isn혖ft any simple way <br/>
to convert these dates into their Gregorian equivalents, although a <br/>
very rough rule of thumb is to add between 20 and 30 days. For <br/>
instance, Takeda Shingen, by contemporary Japanese reckoning, died on <br/>
the 12th day of the 4th month of the 4th year of Genki. By our <br/>
reckoning, he died on 13 May 1573. However, note that his rival Oda <br/>
Nobunaga was killed on the 2nd day of the 6th month of the 10th year of <br/>
Tensho, or, 21 June 1582. That혖fs may give one a sense for the <br/>
complexities of date conversion.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975065171">Thanks fot the help. I didn't realize the Japanese calendar was that <br/>
much different than the Gregorian calendar.   This is a really neat <br/>
forum by the way. <br/>
