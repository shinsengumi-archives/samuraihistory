 </span></blockquote>You can see I'm a little behind in the posts, but anyway, Shingen <br/>
didn't actually kill his father. (although he did kill his son <br/>
Yoshinobu) I researched this fairly thouroughly at the library, and <br/>
this is what I found, basically cut and pasted right from what I <br/>
added about it to the Takeda Shingen bio.  Shingen was actually one <br/>
of the few that let his father live, from what I can tell:<br/>
<br/>
"In 1541 Harunobu suddenly rebelled, supported by a great many of <br/>
his father's retainers. Nobutora submitted with little bloodshed and <br/>
Harunobu exiled his father to Suruga. In this act he had the aid of <br/>
the top Takeda retainers, many of whom held personal grudges against <br/>
Nobutora or at least saw some gain in assisting the young usurper to <br/>
power. Nobushige, for his part, seems to have borne his brother no <br/>
ill will, and became a valued retainer. Sources conflict on what the <br/>
exact events where which led to the replacement of Nobuhide with <br/>
Harunobu. One version of events is that in the 5th month of 1541, <br/>
Nobutora and Harunobu went on a campaign together to attack Unno <br/>
Munetsuna in Shinano province. Unno Munetsuna lost and fled the <br/>
province, and by the 4th day of the 6th month, they were on thier <br/>
way back to Kai. However, on the 10th day of thier trip back to Kai <br/>
province, Harunobu suddenly rebelled in a coup supported by his <br/>
ashigaru and retainers, forcing Nobutora to flee to Suruga Province, <br/>
and in to the care of his daughter's husband, Imagawa Yoshimoto. <br/>
This generally follows the Koyogunkan, which essentialy states that <br/>
Harunobu uncovered a plot by Nobutora to dispose of him and <br/>
eventually give control of the Takeda clan to his younger brother, <br/>
Nobushige. According to the Koyogunkan, Harunobu and loyal vassals <br/>
drove Nobutora out of Kai province into Suruga. Another version of <br/>
events states that during the 6th month of 1541, Harunobu and <br/>
Nobutora travelled to Suruga province to visit upon Nobutora's son <br/>
in law, Imagawa Yoshimoto. Little did Nobutora know, Shingen and <br/>
Yoshimoto had a secret agreement, and upon arrival, Nobutora was <br/>
forcibly retired to Suruga castle, and his son Harunobu was given <br/>
control of the Takeda clan. Although what really happened is not <br/>
clear, historians seem to be in agreement that Imagawa Yoshimoto had <br/>
a hand in the removal of Nobutora. Regardless , Harunobu took <br/>
control of the clan in what is often specifically cited as <br/>
a 'bloodless coup'."<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hence my use of the word "deposed".<br/>
