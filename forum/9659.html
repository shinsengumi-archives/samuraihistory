<div id="ygrps-yiv-148698639">The answer to that is that no one type/class/profession of people are <br/>
all heroes.  Some samurai could be considered heroes while others could <br/>
be considered villains.  It all depends on the samurai and your point of <br/>
view on them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543897790">To elaborate on what Mr. Cooper said, a social class and in this day in <br/>
age, profession does not determine whether people are heroes or <br/>
villains. Look at it this way. A lawyer can be seen as a hero by his <br/>
client and as a villain as the plaintiff. It's a matter of perspective, <br/>
and where this person stands in your life. <br/>
