<h3>great collection of miniature kabuto</h3>
by <i>sinseism</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-472176632">Hello group.<br/>
I found a good collectible series of miniature Kabuto(Samurai helmet) <br/>
at a supermaket today.It is called "Gekisen"series and sold as a <br/>
candy with a prize.It costs 300yen.very reasonable.I got one and was <br/>
surprised at its high quality.It has 13 versions including Kato <br/>
kiyomasa's model and Kuroda Nagamasa's.Unfortunately it seems only <br/>
available in Japan currently.<br/>
<br/>
This page introduces the series.<br/>

    I know this may be an outlandish request, but I was wondering if anyone who has access to buying those mini kabuto would be willing to buy the whole series for me, and I would pay them back in full. I do not live in Japan, unfortunately, and I have fallen in love with those kabuto. If anyone would be willing to help me out, I would appreciate it very much and be forever in your debt. Thank you for your time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680256708">If you buy them for me then of course you could have the candy. How much money would it come out to for all 13 of the kabuto? I am kinda tight on money right now, but I really want them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48234478">Hello JJ<br/>
<br/>
Those little kabuto are higly detailed.The quality is beyond that of <br/>
prize because they are made by Kaiyodo,known as one of the Japanese <br/>
greatest model makers. <br/>
One problem is that we can't tell which kabuto is included until we <br/>
open the box.So It is a little hard to get a whole series even for <br/>
me.I have already doubled some kabuto.It costs $2.5 or so each,but I <br/>
will have to spend much more money to complete.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want them,I might be some help.Contact me.<br/>
<br/>
But I can't eat the candies up.LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307310710">Ohayo, <br/>
 I went to take a look at the web site also. Wow  those are really nice. They would look great on my self here at home, among my smaller pices. I too would like to buy some if possible. I will pay what they cost and the shipping upfront(via money order), and pay you something for your time and effort. If this can be done please contact me. I would probley buy 10 of them at a time, (don't care if I get doubles) That way it would be cheaper on the shipping and your time. Can we do this?? Thank you<br/>
