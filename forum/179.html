<h3>Question of credentials...</h3>
by <i>fifthchamber@aol.com</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-129820851">Hello again all,<br/>
 I have been reading Elizabeth Berry's excellant book 'Hideyoshi'<br/>
along with a biography of Tokugawa Ieyasu and I got to thinking about <br/>
the possible reasons why Hideyoshi decided to take the title <br/>
of 'Kampaku' (Regent) over 'SeiiTai Shogun'. The obvious answer is <br/>
that Hideyoshi did not come from the Genji lineage that would have <br/>
allowed him to hold the title...But I also read that Ieyasu's own <br/>
lineage was never too clear cut in a line from the Minamoto. (a <br/>
suspect link to a clan called 'Nitta' was his claim to power)<br/>
 In Berry's book the idea is presented that Hideyoshi was not <br/>
concerned with the position of Shogun because that of Kampaku would <br/>
permit him the power but without the trouble of upsetting the <br/>
delicate balance that he had achieved with the Daimyo. <br/>
 If Ieyasu could 'alter' his lineage what other reasons can you all <br/>
suggest for why Hideyoshi decided not to follow the same route?<br/>
 Something to think over for a while maybe...<br/>

Samurai in a series at; www.dickyjjamison.homestead.com/artwork.html<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-349922856">Just a couple of thoughts by way of reply:<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa was in a far stronger position to 'massage' his <br/>
lineage than Hideyoshi - Ieyasu was the son of a minor but <br/>
well-respected daimyo, his family were part-rulers of Mikawa, <br/>
whereas Hideyoshi had no bloodline to speak of.<br/>
<br/>
As you say, in the delicate balance of power politics between <br/>
the daimyo, Hideyoshi probably played the wiser game of not <br/>
aggravating a situation (by assuming a title to which he had no <br/>
hereditary claim). By the time Ieyasu declared himself Shogun - <br/>
after Sekigahara he was in a much stronger position than <br/>
Hideyoshi ever enjoyed - there was perhaps only one family in <br/>
Japan who could challenge him. One might ask why Ieyasu did not <br/>
assume the title Kampaku, having emerged from the Council of <br/>
Regents. Perhaps he wanted the whole affair put away.<br/>
<br/>
Had Hideyoshi's son succeeded him, perhaps the title Kampaku <br/>
would have eclipsed Shogun - Regent is royal commission, <br/>
whilst General is a military one - so perhaps Hideyoshi actually <br/>
saw Kampaku as being a greater appelation than Shogun.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Question of credentials...</h3>
by <i>William Letham</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-140145291">I have read somewhere that the concept that the Shogun could only come from<br/>
'Minamoto' lineage was a fiction created later by the Tokugawa heirachy to<br/>
confirm their own grip on power, and to legitimize Ieyasu taking of the<br/>
title over Hideyoshi and Nobunaga (ignoring the fact that neither wanted the<br/>
rank). During the first years of the Tokugawa Bakufu there was a struggle<br/>
between Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son Hidetada and Toyotomi Hideyori over<br/>
securing different ranks from the court. This seems to imply that the title<br/>
of Shogun was not as important as it would later become. After all Ieyasu<br/>
had the title only for two years before handing it over to Hidetada to the<br/>
chagrin of Hideyori and Yodogimi.<br/>
Why Nobunaga and Hideyoshi didn't become shogun; there have been several<br/>
reasons given. I think the main reason was the example of the ineffectual<br/>
later Ashikaga Shogunate. The position had become so bereft of power that<br/>
neither wanted it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648435817">You bring up some valid points. It is a<br/>
well-established fact that Hideyoshi could never be<br/>
shogun. You brought up about his own lineage & I can<br/>
confirm that not only HE but Ieyasu were not of<br/>
Minamoto blood. Tokugawa basically threatened the life<br/>
of the emperor into altering his lineage. Since the<br/>
shogun was considered to be the source of all 'true'<br/>
power during the era, the emperor had no choice but to<br/>
make Tokugawa a 'Minamoto.'<br/>
     I find it interesting that centuries after the<br/>
great Minamoto-Taira wars that people wished to use<br/>
these names, not only to exploit them for personal<br/>
gain, but, also for sovereign protection. Meanwhile,<br/>
they clearly held no reverence for the honor which<br/>
their names derive from a mere mention. Yet, it eludes<br/>
me that Oda Nobunaga, of Taira descent did not so<br/>
clearly connect himself with his heritage in both name<br/>
and nostalgia. It is no wonder then that he is the<br/>
most famous of all Japanese, for the simple fact that<br/>
he is both an enigma and a wonder to us all...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Simple. Using the Taira name didn't give you any real<br/>
political advantage or claim to an office. Not like<br/>
the Minamoto claim to Sei-i-taishogun or the Fujiwara<br/>
Kampaku offices. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883642397">Personally, I'm very much into the Fujiwara/Minamoto/Takeda lineages.<br/>
Although I can not confirm it beyond any shadow of a doubt, it was my<br/>
understanding that a Tokugawa son married a Minamoto daughter some time<br/>
around 1000-1100. My dates could be off since I don't have the information<br/>
right in front of me. Further, I could very well be mistaken ... but I seem<br/>
to recall something of that nature during my studies on the Takeda lineage<br/>
which ranges back through the Minamoto to Fujiwara Seiwa.<br/>
This piece of information is pure speculation. I cannot verify it. Please<br/>
keep that in mind. It's just something I remember reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818286768">On the subject of Takeda lineage, yes I was pretty sure that I have heard of <br/>
lineage directly linked to the Minamoto Buke (Or perhaps to a vassal of the <br/>
Minamoto) and I am sure that the Takeda (being a very old provincial ruling <br/>
clan) had links to the Genji that would have allowed them to claim the post <br/>
of SeiiTai Shogun. However I am pretty certain that there were no members of <br/>
the Tokugawa clan that are named in extant sources (Dating before the Sengoku <br/>
era anyway). This does not mean that the Matsudaira were not an old family, <br/>
only that they were not able to draw any direct links to the Minamoto...Back <br/>
to my first point, it was my impression that Tokugawa Ieyasu 'found' a line <br/>
of his family that was linked to a Buke named 'Nitta' (I think as vassals-not <br/>
too sure..) from the Mikawa area and that he claimed his links to them in his <br/>
efforts to convince Japan (Not least the Emperor.) of his right to rule.</div>

He did however have the men doing his lineage "find" a<br/>

to the taira.  The taira/minamoto battles ended with<br/>
the complete destruction of the taira lineage.  Also I<br/>
beleive that nobunaga's family was a "gekokujo" family<br/>

Yoritomo's wife's family, the Hojo, were of Taira extraction.  (Yes, the<br/>
great irony being that the "Minamoto" Kamakura bakufu, the result of<br/>
overthrowing Taira control, was in fact controlled by a Taira family.)<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377425170">Thank you for writing back to me. It is said that<br/>
Nobunaga is of Taira descent. Something I was told<br/>
that may or may not be true. I felt I should mention<br/>
it but it may not be true. What I CAN tell you is the<br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
1) The Minamoto and Taira were NOT destroyed after the<br/>
Genji-Heike wars. One thing that must be understood is<br/>
that with almost EVERY Japanese name, there are<br/>
relatives that took on other names similar to the<br/>
original names...& sometimes, took on whole new names.<br/>
There are people still even today of the descent of<br/>
these two families, as there are existing people of<br/>
various other families.<br/>
<br/>
2) Tokugawa DID threaten the emperor with changing his<br/>
lineage. Its not like the emperor really had a choice<br/>
anyway: at that time (like many other periods in<br/>
history) the emperor had no true power so therefore<br/>
not only was Tokugawa Ieyasu SHOGUN by default, but,<br/>
had the lineage to defend it (not that many were<br/>
foolish enough to challenge HIM). Perhaps Ieyasu<br/>
wished to save face with the people by allowing their<br/>
ultimate religious leader (the 'divine' emperor) to<br/>
exist as a figurehead.<br/>
<br/>
     My point to you is there are many stories that<br/>
abound even today about these men. Some are true,<br/>
others are not. I leave to you what you shall decide.<br/>
But from what I have learned and what I truly KNOW, is<br/>
true. These were not friendly men, nor friendly times.<br/>
The sad fact is they acted in ways that people today<br/>
still do, so is it really so hard to imagine the<br/>
chosen behavior(s) that were taken to such lengths,<br/>
really hard to believe?<br/>
<br/>
I ask you to ponder this and reply...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629804573">I did some checking and found that the oda family was<br/>
a vassal of a family called the shiba.  In a classic<br/>
case of gekokujo they took the shiba land and made it<br/>
their own.  Within the mess of paper work and fighting<br/>
they did claim a descent from the taira.  Whether this<br/>
is true is up for debate.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to point out that although I knew the<br/>
Minamoto were not destroyed because they were the<br/>
victors.  I did find out after my last response that<br/>
some small factions of the taira did survive.  An<br/>
example of this is the hojo.  This correction was give<br/>
to me by Mr. Bryant(thanks alot).  I also wanted to<br/>
point ot that the ieyasu's family claimed descent from<br/>
the minamoto long bfore he had enough power to<br/>
threaten the emperor.  However, whether he threatened<br/>
him to back up the families past claims is unknown to<br/>
me.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course their are many stories in japanese history<br/>
that are made up as well as family's with no real<br/>
