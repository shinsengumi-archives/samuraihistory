<h3>My Disk Crash</h3>
by <i>sengokudaimyo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-308103122">This is a general note to all the groups I'm on in case anyone has sent me anything I've not replied to in the past<br/>
couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
After coming back from Pennsic, I noticed that my computer was acting wonky; I was planning to try to archive my<br/>
files to CDs when I could get out to the store and grab some, but it didn't seem to be a major threat. And there were<br/>
a lot of messages saved from before and during the war I was hoping to get to, but... well, read on.<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday afternoon, we had a double whammy Chez Effingham.<br/>
<br/>
The phone went out, and they fixed the line today (someone, it seems, cut the outside line). On Tuesday evening, the<br/>
BIG whammy hit. Disk Crash.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that worked was recovering the Hard Drive. That returned the computer to its status as of December,<br/>
2000. Three years of work was gone in a flash.<br/>
<br/>
All the files are gone. All the work. All my armour material. All the garb designs. All the costume reference and<br/>
patterns. All my webpages. All my font work. All my manuscripts and translations. All the music. All the graphics.<br/>
Except for a single CD of selected archived files to transfer to the laptop (made a year ago!) It is only by the<br/>
grace of God that I have a CD of my thesis, as someone recently asked me for a copy and I burned off a CD for him and<br/>
haven't yet mailed it... but everything else -- my translation of Hojoki, my in-progress translations of Japanese<br/>
literature and two chapters of the new armour book, all my correspondence, all my bookmarks, all my addresses... all<br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
So, friends, there is a moral here. For the love of God, backup your files. Early, and often.<br/>
<br/>
And, if you've sent me anything that I haven't replied to, send again. I'll try to get a reply out as soon as I can.<br/>
For now, I'm using the laptop (which has always been the backup and has only a few surviving files on it), as the<br/>
desktop is still acting unstable and is going in for a brain dusting ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I'm going to try to catch up to the last few days of e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Suicidally Yours,<br/>
