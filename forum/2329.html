<br/>
I think that we would need a little more information on the particular device to be able to provide a little guidance. Remember, the device on the helmet was not necessarily a "Mon" - or we would have some strange "Mon" to research!!<br/>
<br/>
Worth checking out "our" web pages... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/crest1.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/crest1.html</a><br/>
<br/>
There are several MOn which portray the crescent moon - depending on the shape, angle and thickness. Families that used such Mon include Okudaira, Amano, Ono, Nonaka, Ohara, Mochizuki, Yamanashi for a start!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck..<br/>
