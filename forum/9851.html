<h3>Rate of march</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-20008848">Does it seem that Japanese armies were able to move any faster down the <br/>
centuries, given an improved road system? I would like to establish the <br/>

Given the short stature of soldiery I would imagine they could leg it.<br/>
I know that in modern western warfare, the shorter regular infantry <br/>
often outmarched Guardsmen selected for their height.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894703391">Don't go by me, I am not an expert. But I would say that it depended on the war.  In Japan, war was almost always literally in your back yard, and you didn't have to go far to find it.  But I think that they marched faster back in the day (Genpei wars-end of Sengoku Jidai), but in relative peace time, things seemed to be slower and less organized.  For example, the shimabara rebellion of 1638 was for the most part a disaster for the Tokugawa forces (and other assorted allies) because it was in the middle of peace time, and Soldiery had already degraded to an extent.  The time it took for reinforcements to get to Shimabara was ridiculous, as well as the initial force to begin with.  Compare this to the Genpei wars (1180-1185); if you look at the timeline, many of the battles happened pretty quickly one after another, often involving many of the same combatants as well as the same commanders.  Sorry, I know this was lengthy, but I hope it helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769693602">It's such an interesting culture. Thank you Takezo, you have been a great help.<br/>
It seems that striking fast at several targets in a series was a skill of these armies.<br/>
They must have relied on living off the land, as it is difficult to see how a baggage train could keep up.<br/>
Again, thank you.<br/>
