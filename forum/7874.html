<h3>Films and &#39;History Books&#39;, relative accuracy</h3>
by <i>rntihg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-863856415">Well,<br/>
<br/>
It seems that I have touched off a bit of a firestorm.<br/>
Unintentional, but I think that the debate has a lot of merit, so I <br/>
will continue in the spirit of exchange of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I will address some of the things that "onnagozen" said in reply to <br/>
Nate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>

><br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing whatsoever is wrong with entertainment, and anything that makes <br/>
one curious is good in my book.  It is only a problem when we take a <br/>
genre like samurai movies (or Westerns in the US) and assume that the <br/>
depictions are historically accurate and not filled with anachronisms <br/>
and misrepresentations of the time period in which they are set.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > And how does something that inspires an interest, like a good film<br/>
> does, automatically become suspect?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because there is nothing stopping a film maker from including <br/>
inaccurate depictions in his/her film.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > And how do you know (and I mean<br/>
> KNOW, without any doubt) that the historical things you read are<br/>
> accurate and truthful and not slanted to suit the political agenda of<br/>
> the writer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One never knows with a capital K.  However, assuming that one can not <br/>
read primary materials, one has to rely on scholarship.  Good <br/>
scholarship does not say, for example, "The sword was the soul of the <br/>
samurai" and leave it at that.  There would be supporting data taken <br/>
from as many different sources as possible (eg. e-maki, diaries, <br/>
historical accounts, official administrative documents), the sources <br/>
would be subjected to scrutiny and placed in their historical contexts <br/>
(who wrote them, why, were they meant to be read by others, were they <br/>
part of some ongoing discourse of the day, etc.).  Which doesn't give <br/>
the capital K know, but provides a level of certainty greater than that <br/>
of a movie or piece of fiction (historical fiction or otherwise).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > How many documentaries have you seen where they get the<br/>
> basic, fundamental things wrong and the narrator can't even pronounce<br/>
> simple things correctly?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too many.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > How many books about a specific subject have<br/>
> you read, and then found another with an opposing view?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very few.  The books that I read on Japanese history (or any <br/>
history-related topics) always contain opposing viewpoints.  To pretend <br/>
that opposing views don't exist and to fail to address them is not <br/>
scholarship.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Does any of<br/>
> this really matter, unless you want to think of yourself as an<br/>
> "expert" or a definitive source of knowledge?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It matters because accuracy matters.  As I said above, it is impossible <br/>
to know history with a capital K, but we should still strive after <br/>
accuracy.  It is that thing that we can't reach in history, but the <br/>
pursuit of it makes the endeavor worthwhile.  Since this is a history <br/>
forum, I suspect that people come to this group expecting that we take <br/>
historiography seriously and that our discussions (which may endure ad <br/>
infinitum on the web), while perhaps not 'expert', strive to be a <br/>
source of knowledge for those who visit here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > And finally, since we<br/>
> are all capable of telling the difference between a film made for pure<br/>
> entertainment and one made with loftier ideals, isn't turning your<br/>
> nose up at all films a bit pointless?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We can?  How?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>
> Whether Kurosawa used poetic licence or not in order to make a more<br/>
> entertaining film, who on earth cares?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Noone.  But to assume that his depiction of anything samurai-related is <br/>
based on anything more than prevailing views of the samurai in popular <br/>
culture is speculation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I wasn't aware that he was a<br/>
> documentary maker who had sworn a blood oath to only depict all the<br/>
> truths that anyone ever wrote about the latter days of Takeda Shingen.<br/>
>  I've seen any number of films about Shingen, all of them give you a<br/>

> entertainment value.  Why does it matter?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don't bet.  Also, it depends on what you mean by 'viewpoints'.  Of <br/>
course authors (biographers and historians) insert their opinions and <br/>
speculations into their work and it goes without saying that every <br/>
human being has biases that they bring to their every endeavor.  <br/>
However, the 'meat' of history is about what can be corroborated and <br/>
narrowed down to be a description of what likely occurred.  From the <br/>
historical pursuit we are unlikely to find out what kind of person <br/>
Shingen was, but we can find out what campaigns he engaged in, what <br/>
documents he sent to others, what his rules for his men were, etc.  The <br/>
reason that narrative histories have been supplanted in recent decades <br/>
is that their style leads the reader to believe that 'this is how it <br/>
was' and requires the writer to fit whatever data they have into a <br/>
coherent story adopting tropes that are familiar to the readers.  While <br/>
easier to read, and very entertaining, this is where one tends to run <br/>
into vastly different 'viewpoints' among writers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Are you concerned that we<br/>

> If I couldn't tell the difference I'd need locking up.  My point is<br/>

><br/>
><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Films are a less reliable source than books written by historians, at <br/>
least those that are peer-reviewed.  While anyone can write and get <br/>
published in a popular press a book on a topic from the past, academic <br/>
presses have experts review their monographs and check citations.  <br/>
Conclusions that the writer chooses to make from the data are, <br/>
necessarily, his/her own, but data supporting as well as contradicting <br/>
his arguments must appear in order for the work to be considered <br/>
scholarly.  That way, if the reader disagrees or is unconvinced, they <br/>
can go to the sources and see for themselves.  It is not so much that <br/>
films are necessarily untrue as much as we have no reason to assume <br/>
that they are accurate.  And the only way available to us to judge <br/>
their accuracy is to go either to primary or secondary sources (history <br/>
books).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Recent historical big-budget blockbusters like "Braveheart," <br/>
"Elizabeth," and "Kingdom of Heaven" come to mind immediately. Though <br/>
those were historical personages, and the stories had a bit of history <br/>
about them, they were so a-historical and error-ridden -- to say nothing <br/>
of actual rewriting of history -- that it makes the historian in me weep.<br/>
<br/>
And there are people who have gotten their "history" from these films, <br/>
and don't know how bogus they are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >  It matters because accuracy matters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hear, hear.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone now thinks Balian of Ibelin was a bastard son -- a French <br/>
blacksmith -- of Godfrey of Ibelin, and that he bonked and settled down <br/>
with the Queen of Jerusalem. In fact, Balian (the Younger) was the <br/>
legitimate son of Balian (the Elder) of Ibelin -- one of three brothers <br/>
-- and was married (quite happily) to the dowager empress of Byzantium.<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, I'm watching Kingdom of Heaven right now...)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh dear. I'm yet to watch this but I was looking forward to hiring it<br/>
out sometime... so much for that. I'll never understand why writers feel<br/>
obliged to change history to fit their vision for a story. If they had<br/>
any talent, they'd do it vice-versa.<br/>
