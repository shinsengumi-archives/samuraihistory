<div id="ygrps-yiv-193450400">Yeah ika would probably be written in hiragana when in doubt.<br/>
However, although katana is reserved for words originating from  <br/>
languages other than japanese (as previously stated), it is sometimes  <br/>
used to emphasis a word (like italic writting in english), and is  <br/>
considered quite trendy.<br/>
my dictionary  gives me both, along with the kanji. hiragana/katana  <br/>
is also used when the kanji is not considered common, or is rarely used.<br/>
finally, ika has several meanings in japanese, and I think the katana  <br/>
writting for ika is considered to mean squid (since the other "ika"  <br/>
are always written in kanji (or hiragana if you can't remember).<br/>
<br/>
another example of this is ebi (shrimp) which is written in Katakana  <br/>
in restaurants.</div>

 </span></blockquote>You are most likely to see this when Japanese is written horizontally. <br/>
When written vertically, other typographical conventions such as <br/>
putting dots next to the word or putting a line next to the word are <br/>
available.</div>
