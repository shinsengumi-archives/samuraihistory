<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry I got carried away with my answer, but hopefully you'll find it<br/>
all useful:<br/>
<br/>
The same 12 animals as used in the zodiac and for marking the hours of<br/>
the day were used for directions as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1st direction/hour Rat = nezumi = north = 23:00-01:00 (midnight @ 00:00)<br/>
2nd direction/hour = ox = ushi = 01:00-03:00<br/>
ox/tiger = ushi tora = north east = 03:00<br/>
3rd hour = tiger = tora = 03:00-05:00<br/>
4th hour = rabbit = usagi = east = 05:00-07:00 (sunrise @ 06:00)<br/>
5th hour = dragon = tatsu = 07:00-09:00<br/>
dragon/snake = tatsu hebi = south east 09:00<br/>
6th hour = snake = hebi = 09:00-11:00<br/>
7th hour = horse = uma = south = 11:00-13:00 (midday = 12:00)<br/>
8th hour = sheep (not goat) = hitsuji = 13:00-15:00<br/>
sheep/monkey = hitsuji saru = south west 15:00<br/>
9th hour =  monkey = saru = 15:00-17:00<br/>
10th hour = garden bird (rooster) = niwa tori (sometimes just "tori") =<br/>
west = 17:00-19:00 (sunset @ 18:00)<br/>
11th hour = dog = inu = 19:00-21:00<br/>
dog/boar = inu inoshishi = north west 21:00<br/>
12th hour = boar = inoshishi = 21:00-2300<br/>
<br/>
Okay when folks say "at the hour of the X", what they mean is the mid-<br/>
point of that time slot. So the hour of the rat is in fact midnight. But<br/>
you also get "early" and "late" rat. Its important to note that the<br/>
times specified above only apply at the spring and summer equinoxes, as<br/>
the day and the night were divided in to 6 equal "hours". Which means<br/>
that at mid-summer the daylight hours were twice as long as the nightime<br/>
ones! Actually the easier way to grasp this system, is to forget the<br/>
numbers above and simply go outside and look up at the daytime sky. Then<br/>
divide the path of the sun's travel across it from sunrise to sunset as<br/>
though it were super-imposed upon the top half of an old style clock<br/>
face. Sunrise as the middle of the hour of the rabbit, midday is the<br/>
middle of the hour of the horse, and sunset is the middle of the hour of<br/>
the bird. The others just slot in between (one and two thirds up the<br/>
curve of the sky). The hour of the rabbit actually starts with the first<br/>
light of the day (morning twilight) and the hour of the bird ends with<br/>
the last light of the day (evening twilight).<br/>
<br/>
Again I hope all this stuff helps<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>

section to make it 24 total hours. I will have to look it up again.<br/>
