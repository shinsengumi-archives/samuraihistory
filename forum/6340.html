<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577345098">Gentles:<br/>
		I receive this list in digest form, so before I answer anybody's notes<br/>
directly I'd just like to note that I'm delighted at where this thread is<br/>
starting to go.  Whatever I feel from my blades is only one person's<br/>
perception - and a modern person's at that, however deeply immersed (some<br/>
would say submerged) I might be in ancient traditions.  Whether anybody<br/>
believes me or not can make no difference to my perception, of course; and<br/>
likewise, my individual - and entirely subjective - perception is highly<br/>
unlikely to sway anyone else's belief.  And that's fine too.<br/>
	What I'm seeing here is, I think, of more importance to the group.  I<br/>
didn't intend to start - or to contribute to - an argument.  I did hope to<br/>
see this dialogue come up:  informed discussion of the idea in the context<br/>
of Japanese (and, by way of perspective, other cultures') beliefs in the<br/>
matter.<br/>
	I'm learning here, gentlemen; and I thank you.<br/>
		Gereg<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  For you other 'digest' recipients:  _please_, when you're answering a<br/>
post, delete the other irrelevant posts.  I've been getting a string of five<br/>
or six consecutive messages unrelated to current topics for the better part<br/>
of a week.  I mean, sure, those are some good messages:  but.<br/>

Whatever I feel from my blades is<br/>

threads like this one arouse more emotion than they<br/>
should, especially since there isn't a "right" or<br/>
"wrong". Now, if you want to start quoting Stephen<br/>
Hayes and tell me that Nobunaga's son Katsuyori<br/>
attacked a ninja clan because his dad fell off a<br/>
horse...<br/>
<br/>
(Explanation: I'm currently putting myself through the<br/>
agony of reading his book--and I use that term only<br/>
because it has pages and is bound--about the mystical<br/>
origins of Ninjutsu--insert appropriate oohs and ahs<br/>
here. The endstate is a review on Amazon so that no<br/>
one every BUYS this filth--I borrowed it from my<br/>
library. Anyways, none of Nobunaga's sons, as most of<br/>
you know, were named Katsuyori. Takeda Katsuyori was<br/>
the enemy he defeated at Nagashino. Anyone doing<br/>
"research" for a "book" might want to at least know<br/>
THAT much history, but I digress.)<br/>

Please, if you can, delete whatever in the message you<br/>
are replying to that doesn't actually have a bearing<br/>
on your reply. This includes those annoying little<br/>
signatures at the bottom of emails, the Yahoo ads,<br/>
etc. And for most, it's helpful if you either<br/>
in-context post, or bottom post. If you post at the<br/>
top of a reply, one has to search through the message<br/>
at the bottom to see the message to which you are<br/>
replying, and that can get confusing. <br/>

<br/>
He now has his won org which he calls Toshindo, he is<br/>

He has been slammed on Tendai buddhist and mikkyo<br/>

I know this because I have been a member fo the<br/>
bujinkan for 20 years. i have researched the history<br/>
of the 9 ryu within the bujinkan extrensively<br/>
including some ninja history. The guy has a japanese<br/>

still cant get it right, Hatsumi snesei is as he<br/>
claims a ninja soke, so considering this and the fact<br/>
hayes was training with Hatsumi in 75 he should have<br/>
got something right by now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617167660">yeah,it gets really frustrating.ive thought about just staying w/whatever he wants to do.but it just doesnt sit well w/me,ya know?its hard to find people to train w/here in ohio.i still practice everyday regardless.i have a few friends that i "teach"little stuff here & there(even though im not licensed to teach).i called up rick & he said that we could talk about training....but i know what hes gonna say.theres also another school here in cleveland called gaijin ryu.i spoke w/the sensei there....it sounds about fishy.he kept telling me that he teachs a dead style(koga ryu).when i asked him some questions about just minor stuff,like about the 9 traditions...about rokusho bo & hanbo,he didnt give good answers.i have a few friends that goto the quest center in dayton,& a few in different dojos here & there in the US but the distance is pretty far to travel ,just to train for a few hrs.my buddies up here that i train w/arent all that bad.ive taught them stuff like ukemi,sanshin,some<br/>
 kihon happo...ya know just really basic fundamental stuff.its cool,because i dont ever tell them any of the kuden.out of 4 people,only 1 truly has a grasp of what budo truly is.well,i gotta goto work.so,hopefully ill ttyl.<br/>

Now, if you want to start quoting Stephen<br/>
Hayes <br/>
(Explanation: I'm currently putting myself through the<br/>
agony of reading his book--and I use that term only<br/>
because it has pages and is bound--about the mystical<br/>
origins of Ninjutsu--insert appropriate oohs and ahs<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Nate please stop reading the book you iwll damage your<br/>
brain cells and its so close to christmas you really<br/>
shuoldnt oput yourself through such agony.<br/>
<br/>
Hayes book are not facutal they are all made up to<br/>
make money. his 5 set series has about 4 pages of real<br/>
info (at a push) this is the guy who told the world<br/>
that ninja used straight swords.<br/>
<br/>
He now has his won org which he calls Toshindo, he is<br/>
not licensed to issue menkyo but if you read his site<br/>
you will get the impression that he doies (I know form<br/>
old students of his that he does issue menkyo in ryu<br/>
he is not licensed to issue them in)<br/>
<br/>
HIs book are full of indian and tibetian religion<br/>
which he is trying to pass off as Ninja kuji.<br/>
<br/>
He has been slammed on Tendai buddhist and mikkyo<br/>
sites for the crap he spouts and this is also<br/>
considerintha he is an ordained tendai priest.<br/>
<br/>
I know this because I have been a member fo the<br/>
bujinkan for 20 years. i have researched the history<br/>
of the 9 ryu within the bujinkan extrensively<br/>
including some ninja history. The guy has a japanese<br/>
wifde who can translate old and new ninja books and he<br/>
still cant get it right, Hatsumi snesei is as he<br/>
claims a ninja soke, so considering this and the fact<br/>
hayes was training with Hatsumi in 75 he should have<br/>
got something right by now.<br/>
<br/>
Anything Hayes writes I would take with a pinch of<br/>
salt.<br/>
<br/>
Yep I know I am slamming the man, and it may be wrong,<br/>
but so many people have been duped by him that he has<br/>
made a vast fortune from his crap<br/>
