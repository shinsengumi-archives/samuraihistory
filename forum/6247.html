<div id="ygrps-yiv-957508071">if you buy the movie book(or just go to your local book store and look at it), it will tell you what is accurate and what is not(to some extent). I have the DVD w/ the directors comentary and extra stuff on a 2nd cd, & it goes into some detail on the realness of the movie. They said that 1/2 is fake & 1/2 is not.I can't really tell which is which, but it was a great movie in my mind. I take kendo & are into samurai swords and armour, that's maybe why it was good to me? All in all, don't tell one of the samurai actors in the movie it was cheesy b/c they all knew what they were doing(all of them were trained to use swords ie...kendo,iaido.....)good stuff!!! <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai, the movie. To: Tony Bryant</h3>
by <i>depos42300</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933419039">hello tony,<br/>
  com'on man,...it was pretty good.?? I've seen a handful "samurai" movies in the past, (and yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but this is the 2000's, not the 1900's (lol). People like to see cool stuff like the Last Samurai even if it isn't all that accurate. You can't tell me you've seen any better Samurai "battle" scenes in another movies from the past?? (if so, please let me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great movie to boost the Samurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of people to respect them for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate history stuff & think i'm a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome movie. They were like...."Wow, those guys could really kick butt" I don't know,....maybe i'm wrong??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more insentive to practice kendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in the making,....delayed temp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watch it again and tell me that<br/>
 those battle scenes don't want to make you get up, build a time machine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hopefully a good one), and fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese back then were only like 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(lol). Well, my times up. Have a good one.<br/>
                                                             Yours, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I apologize for not getting back sooner. This thing<br/>
called "work"...<br/>
<br/>
For BATTLES, since this is what you're looking for, I<br/>
take it: <br/>
<br/>
Throne of Blood--decent "Storming the castle" scene. I<br/>
love when Mifune gets riddled with arrows at the end. <br/>
<br/>
Ran--several great ones. Graphic, too. <br/>
<br/>
Kagemusha: It's a bit contrived at the end with the<br/>
way the teppo look like machine guns, mowing down the<br/>
Takeda cavalry, but it's great all the way around. <br/>
<br/>
That does it for Kurosawa. If I'm missing one, someone<br/>
will let me know. <br/>
<br/>
Others:<br/>
<br/>
Samurai Banners (Fuurinkazan): Great flick--Mifune as<br/>
Yamamoto Kansuke. Great battle scenes, including<br/>
Kawanakajima.<br/>
<br/>
Heaven and Earth (I just hear Tony groan): If you<br/>
overlook the facemasks to hide the Canadian extras,<br/>
it's decent enough. <br/>
<br/>
If you can get your hands on the "Aoi sandai" taiga<br/>
drama scenes of Sekigahara, it's the first one I think<br/>
that used computer animation to display a battle.<br/>
Nice. <br/>
<br/>
These are just a few, that I know can be found in the<br/>
US. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106100392">Problems with Last Samurai?<br/>
<br/>
The military advisors to the Meiji Army were German, Navy? British.<br/>
Americans taught agriculture.<br/>
<br/>
The samurai who fought against the government in the rebellions that <br/>
followed the restoration, were not from a single village, never controlled <br/>
territory or terrorized the Imperial Army as depicted, they fought with <br/>
modern weapons and they absolutely did not wear armour two hundred years<br/>
out <br/>
of date.<br/>
<br/>
None of the rebellion leaders I know of spoke English.<br/>
<br/>
White men weren't left alone with Japanese women of the time unless they <br/>
were "in the trade." A Japanese woman of the time would gouge your eyes out <br/>
if you killed her husband, not serve you rice in a soup bowl. Japanese <br/>
children wouldn't eat at the same table as "the man of the house" and the <br/>
woman probably wouldn't even eat in the house, more likely in the dirt <br/>
floored kitchen. The actress used would have been a giant in Meiji Japan, <br/>
she was far too tall and well fed to be a nineteenth century female.<br/>
<br/>
No man, not even Tom Cruise, would be allowed in the presence of the <br/>
Emperor, unanounced and carrying a sword!<br/>
<br/>
The true last charge on which the films finale was based amounted to six <br/>
men, their leaders seppuku was conducted with a sword so dull from use that <br/>
his neck looked like a stair-step.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They lie. There is so much that's wrong with it historically that I almost<br/>
cried. Yeah, the armour's pretty. Yeah, the battles are fancy. But historically<br/>
it was totally crapola.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I'd think that Watanabe Ken and Sanada Hiroyuki ought to be<br/>
embarrassed. They've each made dozens of films -- some crappy, some really good<br/>
-- and the one they get international reputations for is this American "Dances<br/>
With Samurai" piece of steaming, fetid poop.<br/>
<br/>
I finally caught it on HBO last night, after months and months of refusing to go<br/>
pay to see it, rent it, or buy it.<br/>
<br/>
It made me sick.<br/>
