<h3>middleman</h3>
by <i>rami_efal</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256003579">Hi group!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering: I have never read of any middle-man between the Daimyo <br/>
and the Shugon in Edo era. Were the individual estates directly under Edo's <br/>
jurisdiction, or were each several estates clustered under, shall we say, a <br/>
province or a regional lord. (example: every borough of New York City has a <br/>
Mayor of Borough, by NYC still has ONE mayor [New York being Japan). <br/>
<br/>
I guess the lack of mentioning of this structure hints at its non-existance, but I <br/>
was still wondering.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Rami.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758540367">Hi Rami - <br/>
<br/>
I think you might be in a 'can't see the wood for the trees' scenario, as the Edo era <br/>
shogunate was a highly stratified, hierarchical bureaucracy.<br/>
<br/>
The first point is 'daimyo' means big name, but it is not a social rank as such, but <br/>
rather signifies that you're on the ladder. The Shogun himself is a daimyo, and he sits <br/>
at the apex of power.<br/>
<br/>
The layers beneath can be very complex. Tokugawa Ieyasu, for example, when he <br/>
set up his shogunate, put those he wanted to keep on his side in positions of great <br/>
wealth, whilst those he could tust, his allies from the beginning, had relatively frugal <br/>
rewards, but were placed in positions of great strategic importance should trouble <br/>
flare up. I would also suggest they received rewards 'in kind' that made any sacrifice <br/>
worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
As for middlemen - the Tokugawa house had daimyate houses who were allies from <br/>
the very first - Ishikawa, Sakai, Sakakibara and notably the Honda. The latter family, <br/>
until they fell from grace, possessed considerable authority as middlemen between <br/>
Ieyasu and the rest, and if you fell out of favour with a middleman you might count <br/>
your days as numbered.<br/>
<br/>
Put another way - the shogun is the daimyo at the top, the daimyo at the bottom <br/>
probably doesn't even get a mention in the history books, and EVERY other daimyo is <br/>
somewhere 'in the middle' between these two and working hard to preserve if not <br/>
advance his position along an often very greasy pole, whilst his every neighbour <br/>
seeks and hopes for his dislodgement.<br/>

<h3>Parting words</h3>
by <i>crazoftheages</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491471930">To the Buke,<br/>
  This will be my last letter for some time.  As most<br/>
should be aware, Takeda Katsuchiyo will be taking my<br/>
place as the Daimyo of Tokaido fief and head of the<br/>
household/clan of Hara while I am gone.  I have<br/>
enjoyed being a part of this society a great deal<br/>
these past few weeks, and I hope to see it thriving<br/>
upon my return.<br/>
<br/>
I should request that my name be taken off the<br/>
emailing list while I am gone, simply because by the<br/>
time I return, there will have been too many for me to<br/>
read, and probably overflowing my mailbox quota on<br/>
this Yahoo email account of mine.  If there's anything<br/>
of significant importance that actually has relation<br/>
to me even after a long period of time, I'd welcome<br/>
it, but general discussion emails should probably be<br/>
cut off from me.<br/>
<br/>
As I leave to go on musha shugyo, I can think of only<br/>
these parting words to give you all, nagorioshiku<br/>
soro.<br/>
<br/>
Hara Katsusada<br/>
