    The answer to your question is 'yes' and 'no'.<br/>
    Japan had very few actual horses. Rather they had ponies, which are much smaller than the horses seen on the continent.<br/>
    Also to be taken into account is the arable land needed to graze & raise horse. Which Japan has rather little. So the 'warhorse' was usually kept for<br/>
high-ranking people, or the very rich (which many times meant the same thing). Even then horses used were just ponies trained & groomed for war (read a<br/>
little bigger)...  Japanese people are small... :)<br/>
    Note that I am no authority on this, but those were my 2cents (in euro)<br/>
