<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] I have another question</h3>
by <i>holydemon13</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793345485">Hey there!<br/>
  It's me again, and I'll try to make my two cents worth of nonsense somwhat <br/>
comprehensible.<br/>
  That's certainly possible, although I've noticed in other cultures, women <br/>
have also walked a step behind the men, for whatever reason.  The most <br/>
notable one of recent memory is Raisa Gorbacheva, who, when appearing in <br/>
public with Mikhail Gorbachev, ALWAYS walked a step back of him, and very <br/>
rarely was seen even standing level with him.  I'm guessing it was (and may <br/>
still be) a show of deference for whatever his position is -- even if the <br/>
society (in whatever way) dictates (or the man himself dictates, whichever <br/>
the case may be) that simply his being a MAN makes him worthy of walking the <br/>
step ahead.  (Although I would hope that of the two, it is the first rather <br/>
than the second.  The first is undesirable and avoided not without a great <br/>
deal of difficulty.  The second, though, is insufferable and avoidable.)  <br/>
Although, I must say, tsukiyo's notion is at the VERY least, romantic and <br/>
VERY laudable that a man would want to protect his lady like that.  Although, <br/>
I would hope that he would only step the step ahead in the case that it were <br/>
necessary, and the rest of the time he was with her, that they'd walk <br/>
even-up.  That's about it.<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>

we still have this kind of thinking even not all men do it but we still do it <br/>
and maybe in certain places these are their custom and men should walk 1 step ahead from women <br/>
but still its up for your thinking <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-930484515">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>
deleted at the moderator(s) discretion without explanation. <br/>
Please do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a refresher of the rules of the list.  PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:<br/>
<br/>
RULES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. <br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a history list. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. <br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. If not, we'll give you<br/>
one more chance. Failure to comply will result in<br/>
banishment. <br/>

<br/>
This is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>

Please do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic.<br/>
<br/>
Following is the constitution of the Samurai History Group of Yahoo, RATIFIED 2004-2005<br/>
POSTING TO THIS GROUP MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS WITHIN, <br/>
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POSTS ARE ACCEPTED AT THE SOLE WILL OF THE MODERATOR(S).  This is a group of over 850 people, therefore order <br/>
will be maintained.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS YOUR FUTURE ON THIS FORUM DEPENDS ON IT.<br/>
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
However, if you comply with the rules, it is guaranteed that there will be no problems.  <br/>
We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>

especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213267128">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>
deleted at the moderator(s) discretion without explanation. <br/>
Please do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic.<br/>
<br/>
Following is the constitution of the Samurai History Group of Yahoo, RATIFIED 2004-2005<br/>
POSTING TO THIS GROUP MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS WITHIN, <br/>
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POSTS ARE ACCEPTED AT THE SOLE WILL OF THE MODERATOR(S).  This is a group of over 850 people, therefore order <br/>
will be maintained.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS YOUR FUTURE ON THIS FORUM DEPENDS ON IT.<br/>
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
However, if you comply with the rules, it is guaranteed that there will be no problems.  <br/>
We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531934364">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>
deleted at the moderator(s) discretion without explanation. <br/>
Please do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic.<br/>
<br/>
Following is the constitution of the Samurai History Group of Yahoo, RATIFIED 2004-2005<br/>
POSTING TO THIS GROUP MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS WITHIN, <br/>
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POSTS ARE ACCEPTED AT THE SOLE WILL OF THE MODERATOR(S) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html</a>  <br/>
This is a group of well over 1000 people, therefore order <br/>
will be maintained.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS YOUR FUTURE ON THIS FORUM DEPENDS ON IT.<br/>
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
However, if you comply with the rules, it is guaranteed that there will be no problems.  <br/>
We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm">http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm</a><br/>

<br/>
9. See rule #8.<br/>

BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS A MODERATED FORUM:<br/>
Because this is a moderated forum, your post may not show <br/>

<br/>
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS YOUR FUTURE ON THIS FORUM DEPENDS ON IT.<br/>
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
However, if you comply with the rules, it is guaranteed that there will be no problems.  <br/>
We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>

We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action. Furthermore, this IS NOT a<br/>
list for pseudo-philosophical Hagakure reading Samurai wannabe<br/>
martial artists. If you want to bandy about how well you follow the<br/>
tenets of Bushido, and how that makes you a 'modern Samurai', <br/>
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>

<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action. Furthermore, this IS NOT a<br/>
list for pseudo-philosophical Hagakure reading Samurai wannabe<br/>
martial artists. If you want to bandy about how well you follow the<br/>
tenets of Bushido, and how that makes you a 'modern Samurai', <br/>
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>

<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>

First, be sure to join the Samurai Archives Citadel, the online community for people interested in Japanese history, culture, martial arts, language, entertainment, and current events: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/">http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Second, ask yourself why you are here. If it is to learn about and discuss<br/>
JAPANESE HISTORY, you are in the right place. If you are here to discuss<br/>
martial arts, Anime, or your dedication to the ways of Bushido you are in the<br/>
WRONG PLACE. Join the Samurai Archives Citadel:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/">http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/</a><br/>
The Samurai Archives Citadel has forums that cover every subject related to Japan. <br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>
deleted at the moderator(s) discretion without explanation. <br/>
Please do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic. The posting of SPAM will get you<br/>
immediately banned without exception.<br/>
<br/>
Following is the constitution of the Samurai History Group of Yahoo, RATIFIED 2004-2005<br/>
POSTING TO THIS GROUP MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS WITHIN, <br/>
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POSTS ARE ACCEPTED AT THE SOLE WILL OF THE MODERATOR(S) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html</a>  <br/>
This is a group of well over 1500 people, therefore order <br/>
must be maintained.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS YOUR FUTURE ON THIS FORUM DEPENDS ON IT.<br/>
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
However, if you comply with the rules, it is guaranteed that there will be no problems.  <br/>
We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action. Furthermore, this IS NOT a<br/>
list for pseudo-philosophical Hagakure reading Samurai wannabe<br/>
martial artists. If you want to bandy about how well you follow the<br/>
tenets of Bushido, and how that makes you a 'modern Samurai', <br/>
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>

First, be sure to join the Samurai Archives Citadel, the online community for people interested in Japanese history, culture, martial arts, language, entertainment, and current events: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/">http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Second, ask yourself why you are here. If it is to learn about and discuss<br/>
JAPANESE HISTORY, you are in the right place. If you are here to discuss<br/>
martial arts, Anime, or your dedication to the ways of Bushido you are in the<br/>
WRONG PLACE. Join the Samurai Archives Citadel:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/">http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/</a><br/>
The Samurai Archives Citadel has forums that cover every subject related to Japan. <br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>
deleted at the moderator(s) discretion without explanation. <br/>
Please do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic. The posting of SPAM will get you<br/>
immediately banned without exception.<br/>
<br/>
Following is the constitution of the Samurai History Group of Yahoo, RATIFIED 2004-2005<br/>
POSTING TO THIS GROUP MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS WITHIN, <br/>
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POSTS ARE ACCEPTED AT THE SOLE WILL OF THE MODERATOR(S) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html</a>  <br/>
This is a group of well over 1500 people, therefore order <br/>
must be maintained.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS YOUR FUTURE ON THIS FORUM DEPENDS ON IT.<br/>
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
However, if you comply with the rules, it is guaranteed that there will be no problems.  <br/>
We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action. Furthermore, this IS NOT a<br/>
list for pseudo-philosophical Hagakure reading Samurai wannabe<br/>
martial artists. If you want to bandy about how well you follow the<br/>
tenets of Bushido, and how that makes you a 'modern Samurai', <br/>
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm">http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
8. Have a sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
9. See rule #8.<br/>

2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action. Furthermore, this IS NOT a<br/>
list for pseudo-philosophical Hagakure reading Samurai wannabe<br/>
martial artists. If you want to bandy about how well you follow the<br/>
tenets of Bushido, and how that makes you a 'modern Samurai', <br/>
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>

8. Have a sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
9. See rule #8.<br/>

<br/>
Second, ask yourself why you are here. If it is to learn about and discuss<br/>
JAPANESE HISTORY, you are in the right place. If you are here to discuss<br/>
martial arts, Anime, or your dedication to the ways of Bushido you are in the<br/>
WRONG PLACE. Join the Samurai Archives Citadel:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/">http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/</a><br/>
The Samurai Archives Citadel has forums that cover every subject related to Japan. <br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>
deleted at the moderator(s) discretion without explanation. <br/>
Please do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic. The posting of SPAM will get you<br/>
immediately banned without exception.<br/>
<br/>
Following is the constitution of the Samurai History Group of Yahoo, RATIFIED 2004-2005<br/>
POSTING TO THIS GROUP MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS WITHIN, <br/>
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POSTS ARE ACCEPTED AT THE SOLE WILL OF THE MODERATOR(S) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html</a>  <br/>
This is a group of well over 1500 people, therefore order <br/>
must be maintained.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS YOUR FUTURE ON THIS FORUM DEPENDS ON IT.<br/>
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
However, if you comply with the rules, it is guaranteed that there will be no problems.  <br/>
We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action. Furthermore, this IS NOT a<br/>
list for pseudo-philosophical Hagakure reading Samurai wannabe<br/>
martial artists. If you want to bandy about how well you follow the<br/>
tenets of Bushido, and how that makes you a 'modern Samurai', <br/>
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>

Second, ask yourself why you are here. If it is to learn about and discuss<br/>
JAPANESE HISTORY, you are in the right place. If you are here to discuss<br/>
martial arts, Anime, or your dedication to the ways of Bushido you are in the<br/>
WRONG PLACE. Join the Samurai Archives Citadel:<br/>

<br/>
This is a moderated forum. Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>
deleted at the moderator(s) discretion without explanation. <br/>
Please do not take offense if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep everything on topic. The posting of SPAM will get you<br/>
immediately banned without exception.<br/>
<br/>
Following is the constitution of the Samurai History Group of Yahoo, RATIFIED 2004-2005<br/>
POSTING TO THIS GROUP MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS WITHIN, <br/>
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POSTS ARE ACCEPTED AT THE SOLE WILL OF THE MODERATOR(S) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/ultmods.html</a>  <br/>
This is a group of well over 1500 people, therefore order <br/>
must be maintained.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS YOUR FUTURE ON THIS FORUM DEPENDS ON IT.<br/>
CONSISTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>
However, if you comply with the rules, it is guaranteed that there will be no problems.  <br/>
We don't tend to be THAT serious.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLES: <br/>
<br/>
1. Compose your emails using proper English, to<br/>
include punctuation, spelling, spacing,<br/>
capitalization, and grammar. Allowances will be made<br/>
only for those who are not native English speakers. If<br/>
you are above the age of 10 and a native English<br/>
speaker, there is no excuse for composing like you are<br/>
4. If you are under 10, you probably should not be on<br/>
the internet without supervision. <br/>
<br/>
2. Limit your "internetspeak". Using abbreviations<br/>
such as "lol" (Laugh out loud), "ROTFLMAO", etc., are<br/>
acceptable in limited usage and proper context. This<br/>
is not a license to abbreviate everything you write or<br/>
take spelling/punctuation shortcuts because you are<br/>
lazy--see Rule 1. "Smileys" are similarly acceptable<br/>
in limited usage. Also, be sure to erase unneeded extra <br/>
text from posts you reply to. There is no need to include <br/>
the past 7 emails when you are only responding to the last <br/>
2 sentences of the most recent email.<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not make personal accusations or insults.  As<br/>
moderators, we are here to enforce the rules and<br/>
ensure proper discussion and debate, and will not<br/>
tolerate "flaming" or personal attacks by anyone on<br/>
anyone. Don't do it. <br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
5. Remember this is a HISTORY LIST. While digressions<br/>
are allowed to a limited extent, please keep things on<br/>
topic. Gaming topics, anime, popular culture are fine<br/>
as long as there is some connection with Japanese<br/>
history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action. Furthermore, this IS NOT a<br/>
list for pseudo-philosophical Hagakure reading Samurai wannabe<br/>
martial artists. If you want to bandy about how well you follow the<br/>
tenets of Bushido, and how that makes you a 'modern Samurai', <br/>
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>
<br/>
7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm">http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
8. Have a sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
9. See rule #8.<br/>

BANISHMENT FROM THE FORUM.<br/>

history; however, these are not "historical" sources.<br/>
Do not get offended if someone says what you saw on<br/>
"Ninja Hattori-kun" was inaccurate, because it<br/>
probably was. If things get too far off topic, the list <br/>
shogun will take appropriate action. Furthermore, this IS NOT a<br/>
list for pseudo-philosophical Hagakure reading Samurai wannabe<br/>
martial artists. If you want to bandy about how well you follow the<br/>
tenets of Bushido, and how that makes you a 'modern Samurai', <br/>
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.<br/>
<br/>
6. Argue logically. "I saw it on an anime", "My sensei<br/>
told me so", or "that's what it says on my Playstation<br/>
game" are NOT acceptable bases for arguments. You will<br/>
recieve derision and sarcasm in return, and you will<br/>
deserve it. Do not misunderstand--any of these are<br/>
good reasons to bring up a question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
the main character uses a symbol on his banner--what<br/>
is that called?" is a good question. "In my PS2 game<br/>
you have to follow Bushido to win, so all samurai<br/>
followed Bushido" is a statement which will get you<br/>
laughed at for a month.<br/>

7. READ THE TOP 11 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SAMURAI.<br/>
The link is below. This is not negotiable. If you post<br/>
something idiotic like "samurai hated guns", We will<br/>
ask you if you read the list. <br/>
