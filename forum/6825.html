<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335206491">'The Taming of the Samurai' was one of the first books on the topic of<br/>
samurai that I picked up, and I thought it was excellent. It can be a<br/>
little tough to read at times, especially the first couple of sections,<br/>
but after putting it down I felt like I knew a heck of a lot more than I<br/>
did before I picked it up.<br/>
<br/>
What did you think of the first half Cesare?<br/>
