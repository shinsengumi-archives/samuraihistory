Kitano turns blind eye to tradition<br/>
By WALLACE BAINE<br/>
Sentinel staff writer<br/>
Imagine for a moment Mel Gibson reviving the "The Lone Ranger" <br/>
series and casting himself in the lead under a pseudonym. <br/>
<br/>
That's roughly the effect in Japan with "Zatoichi: The Blind <br/>
Swordsman," a weird little samurai melodrama that combines the <br/>
talents of one of Japan's most respected actor/directors Takeshi <br/>
Kitano and one of its most well-known film characters, the itinerant <br/>
blind swordsman played for years in film and TV by the late Shintaro <br/>
Katsu, another icon of Japanese popular culture.<br/>
<br/>
In a culture often characterized by its overt reverence, Kitano is <br/>
going against the grain here. Far from an homage to the Shintaro <br/>
Katsu films, this new film is a goof, maybe even a satire, mixing <br/>
slapstick-ish comedy and horror- flick bloodletting, not to mention <br/>
a showy but incongruous Riverdance-style dance number that's still <br/>
got me scratching my coconut. <br/>
<br/>
It's as if Kitano  one of the masters of the gangster-film genre <br/>
in Japan  wants to counter the earnest, Quentin Tarantino-esque, we-<br/>
are-not-worthy super-reverence often afforded to the samurai genre <br/>
by dropping his pants at the idolaters.<br/>
<br/>
Kitano  working, as is his wont as an actor, under the name Beat <br/>
Takashi  plays the title character, a wandering masseuse who, <br/>
despite his blindness, is a deadly assassin with the sword. (It's a <br/>
good thing the old man's blind, considering what someone did to his <br/>
hair. Kitano wears a burst of pillowy white hair, making him look <br/>
like Billy Idol's Japanese grandpa.)<br/>
<br/>
The story, set in the pre-industrial 19th-century Japanese <br/>
countryside, will be somewhat familiar to any fan of samurai epics <br/>
(or Hollywood Westerns). A small village is being intimidated by the <br/>
corrupt Ginzo gang, regularly extorting money from townspeople who <br/>
barely have any. Meanwhile, a brother-sister pair of geishas (the <br/>
brother is a cross-dresser) plot revenge against another gang for <br/>
murdering their family. <br/>
<br/>
Zatoichi just happens to be passing through. Thanks to a kindly <br/>
widow and her affable but screwy nephew, he gets involved in the <br/>
town's struggles against the Ginzo gang and meets the aggrieved <br/>
geishas.<br/>
<br/>
As played by Kitano, Zatoichi is stooped and unremarkable, always <br/>
laughing at some internal dialogue. He seems serenely unaware of his <br/>
surroundings, until he attacks, then he's possessed of exquisitely <br/>
calibrated senses that allow him to kill with precision without <br/>
getting a scratch.<br/>
<br/>
The violence here is a mix of brutal realism and cartoony absurdity. <br/>
For some unfathomable reason, Kitano created computer-generated <br/>
flows of blood that look faker than anything you'll see in a Pixar <br/>
film, as if the film were little more than an exercise in <br/>
incongruity (cheesy CGI blood in a period film?). <br/>
<br/>
Zatoichi's fight scenes are done with swift and deadly force, but <br/>
when he tosses his sword across the room and it slides effortlessly <br/>
into his sheath on the fly, well, I only envision "Three Stooges" <br/>
tricks.<br/>
<br/>
Only someone with the creative verve of Kitano  an accomplished <br/>
painter, poet and cartoonist and a highly visible TV presence in <br/>
Japan  could get away with such slapdash audacity. The film's <br/>
jerky changes of tone will likely prevent you from relaxing and <br/>
enjoying the narrative. But if you like to see what happens when an <br/>
artist is unbound by notions of dramatic consistency, this one will <br/>
have you dancing in the aisles, like everyone else on screen.<br/>
