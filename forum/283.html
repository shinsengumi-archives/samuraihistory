<h3>Book Reply was  New Oda Nobunaga Book</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436106088">|The problem I have with the field of<br/>
| Japanese historiograpy is that there are few (very few) well written<br/>
| narrative histories like the type done by say Robert Massie, Simon Schama,<br/>
| David McCollough, or Stephan Ambrose. While I*am*not a historian I do love<br/>
a<br/>
| good book on history.<br/>
<br/>
But I see a couple of reasons for this.  One, you don't have as many people<br/>
trained in Japanese history in the West as say European or American history.<br/>
Your pool of potential writers is much smaller.<br/>
<br/>
Second, for the authors you list above, while writing good introductory<br/>
books, these would not necessarily make tenure committees or promotion<br/>
committees happy.  In fact, one could advance the thesis that the more<br/>
popular and well received a non-fiction book is by<br/>
the general public, the less academics will like it.<br/>
<br/>
Third, is there a market for books as you want on medieval Japanese history?<br/>
Publishing is a money making enterprise and most publishers seem to shy away<br/>
from books that don't sell well over 10,000 copies.<br/>
