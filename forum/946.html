<h3>&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (Movie)</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804198795">(From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/364/364194p1.html">http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/364/364194p1.html</a> )<br/>
<br/>
"The Last Samurai is the best script I've read in months. It's a <br/>
captivating work of historical fiction that allows Westerners a peek <br/>
inside a foreign world and provides an opportunity to learn about the <br/>
samurai, a group often portrayed onscreen but seldom understood. What <br/>
I enjoyed most was the story's (rather overt) parallels to <br/>
contemporary issues as it recounts America's first foray into <br/>
Southeast Asian affairs. Allusions to World War II, America's <br/>
involvement in Vietnam, and the influx of Japanese businesses into <br/>
the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s are clearly evident in this draft.<br/>
<br/>
I had worried that these harbingers of things to come might become <br/>
overbearing but they just lent further tragedy and poignancy to the <br/>
story. The spectator knows what the characters' actions will <br/>
ultimately lead to and the horrible toll it will have on both Japan <br/>
and the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
The Last Samurai is a rousing adventure yarn, an intriguing <br/>
commentary on a key turning point in the history of Japan and its <br/>
relationship with the United States, as well as an enlightening <br/>
lesson on Japanese culture and the titular samurai. I simply can't <br/>
wait to see this film."<br/>
