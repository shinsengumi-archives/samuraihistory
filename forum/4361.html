<br/>
The Twilight Samurai: Starring Hiroyuki Sanada, Rie Miyazawa. <br/>
Directed by Yoji Yamada. Written by Yamada and Yoshitaka Asama. (Not <br/>
rated. In Japanese with English subtitles. 129 minutes. At the Bridge <br/>
and Rafael.) <br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
Films about samurai rarely provide insight into their economic <br/>
circumstances or household concerns. "The Twilight Samurai,'' a <br/>
nominee for best foreign-language film at this year's Oscars, <br/>
presents its own, somewhat revisionist samurai legend as a thoughtful <br/>
and moving domestic drama. <br/>
The picture offers not a requiem for a lost era but regret that it <br/>
didn't end sooner for born-again pacifist Iguchi (Hiroyuki Sanada), <br/>
an impoverished widower in the lower caste of the samurai class in <br/>
the waning days of the feudal Edo period. An economic hierarchy among <br/>
samurai is an intriguing concept on its own, but the beauty <br/>
of "Twilight Samurai,'' directed and co- written by Yoji Yamada, lies <br/>
in its timeless questions about the qualities that measure a man. <br/>
<br/>
Actor Sanada ("Ringu'') invests his character with a quiet grace <br/>
under torn robes and unkempt hair. Iguchi has been dubbed "twilight <br/>
samurai" for neglecting his studies to care for his two young <br/>
daughters and mother with dementia. He takes his greatest pleasure, <br/>
he declares, in watching his children grow. <br/>
<br/>
Constantly warned that his poor hygiene is an offense, Iguchi is too <br/>
busy to care, or more precisely, too caring to bother. After a busy <br/>
day as a clerk in his clan's warehouse, he crafts wooden baskets he <br/>
sells to pay off debt incurred by his late wife's long illness. A <br/>
scene of the samurai working by firelight with his children is the <br/>
movie's most intimate. With great affection, Sanada's samurai advises <br/>
his older girl to study Confucius, even though the clan elders <br/>
discourage women's education. But awareness is also a source of <br/>
turmoil for this philosophical man. Even the gentlest soul must rise <br/>
to a challenge, especially if he is a samurai. When Iguchi must <br/>
defend a woman (Rie Miyazawa) from her abusive ex-husband, he is <br/>
loath to display his swordsmanship. Instead, he triumphs with a <br/>
wooden bat against a sword. The woman, a childhood friend, responds <br/>
by caring for his daughters and cleaning his house. <br/>
<br/>
Sanada and Miyazawa bring a shy gratitude and growing mutual respect <br/>
to their characters' interactions, but the presence of the lovely <br/>
young woman also provokes new money concerns. She is from a higher <br/>
caste, and he fears she would be left wanting if they married. More <br/>
worrisome still is an order from the clan that he kill a wayward <br/>
samurai who has refused to commit hara-kiri. Iguchi's outlook is <br/>
suspiciously evolved for a man of his time, but filmmaker Yamada <br/>
provides sufficient context. His comrades view Iguchi as eccentric at <br/>
best and a half-wit at worst -- the "twilight'' tag extends their <br/>
assessment of his mental faculties. But Yamada offers visual <br/>
counterpoints in wide shots of the tattered warrior before a backdrop <br/>
of orchards and sky, bathed in golden hues as the sun sets. The <br/>
period between day and night is a time to mourn the fading light or <br/>
glory in its remaining glimmers. "The Twilight Samurai'' chooses the <br/>
latter. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it is...once I actually opened the file and<br/>
looked at the pictures...<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I watched "Owl's Castle" this<br/>
weekend, after buying it. Loved it...wow!<br/>
