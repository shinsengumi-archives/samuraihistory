<div id="ygrps-yiv-542676153">I can only think of the 'old standby' answers:<br/>
<br/>
1. He shipwrecks and is knocked out, and some nice fishermen find and hide him OR <br/>
He shipwrecks and somehow ends up saving a samurai who is being attacked by <br/>
bandits (this would be cheezy enough to end up in a highlander episode, which then <br/>
answers #2 and #3 for you.)<br/>
<br/>
4. YOU'RE the author, make it up ;)<br/>

<br/>
Have you ever heard of Ranald MacDonald? He was an American/Canadian/native<br/>
American who came to Japan in the 1840's. Somehow he managed to traverse<br/>
Japan from north to south winding up in Nagasaki. There is a new book on<br/>
him. I can't recall the author or title of hand. What I read about him from<br/>
other books his adventures sound quite interesting.<br/>
<br/>
There was also a British doctor who lived in Okinawa for some time prior to<br/>
1853. His name was Bernard Bettlehiem. You can find his story as well as<br/>
MacDonalds in "Yankees in the Land of Gods" by Peter Booth Wiley.<br/>
<br/>
1) arrive in the country and not be immediately executed<br/>
<br/>
As far as I recall no intruders into 19th (pre 1853) Japan were executed.<br/>
Most were incarcerated and later repatriated through Nagasaki.<br/>
<br/>
2) endear himself to someone who would teach him the ways of the<br/>
samurai<br/>
<br/>
Doubt it. Most of the people that befriended the two mentioned above were<br/>
peasants and fisherman. Besides at this time many "samurai" were starting to<br/>
question the need for the samurai class and the so-called ways of the<br/>
samurai. Read Toward Restoration by Harry Harootunian and The Western World<br/>
and Japan by George Sansom.<br/>
<br/>
3) Perhaps be involved in the battle of battle of Tonegawa (1844)<br/>
<br/>
Well if its a work of fiction why not. However any such act by a foreigner<br/>
in Japan at that time would be considered very serious.<br/>
<br/>
4) perhaps meet Tokugawa Iesada<br/>
<br/>
Most unlikely. By this time the Shogun lived a fairly secluded life in Edo<br/>
castle. permission to see him was limited to a few senior advisors.</div>

	First let me say I count myself among the grumps who advise you to do <br/>
your own research, it will in the end make for better writing...<br/>
	Were it my character he would arrive as an American ships-doctor on a <br/>
Dutch(British) vessel making a regularly schedulled visit to Deshima. <br/>
He accompanies the Captain and others on a visit to the Shoguns court, <br/>
along the way he aides an important personage who is ill or injured. He <br/>
befriends the personal Physician of this "Great name", who is also an <br/>
accomplished swordsman(or swordsmith IE; Kaboku). The doctor <br/>
apprentices under the American learning western medicine, the American <br/>
studies the new culture he finds himself immersed in. He witnesses the <br/>
battle as a physician/corpsman. I think of Kitabatake Akiie when I <br/>
think of Tonegawa, wasn't the 1844 "battle" just a gang war? As <br/>
attendant upon a "great name" he might come to the attention of the <br/>
Shogun himself...<br/>
