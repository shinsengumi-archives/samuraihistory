<h3>Nobunaga´s army</h3>
by <i>mayalan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098937335">Hi!<br/>
 <br/>
I got a question regarding nobunaga�s army size.<br/>
 <br/>
We al know that in 1560 Nobunaga�s men were about 3,000, but in subsequent battles their numbers increased, (30,000 in Nagashino for example); How did Nobunaga managed to increase their army that way?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
As you win, you control more land. You therefore<br/>
control more people. Losers who don't die need someone<br/>
to work for, why not go with the winner? Nobunaga<br/>
absorbed many of his enemies troops/leaders. When you<br/>
look at the land he controlled in 1560 vs 1575, it's<br/>
easy to see how his army would have grown. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, in 1560 he defeated Imagawa--many of<br/>
those Imagawa forces split and followed his ally<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu, who had been under Imagawa control.<br/>
In 1568 (?) He took Mino from the Saito, and absorbed<br/>
most of their retainers. As he continued, he followed<br/>
this pattern. In 1560 it's doubtful anyone such as<br/>
Matsunaga Hisahide, Takayama Ukon, Bessho Nagaharu,<br/>
Araki Murashige, Ukita Naoie, etc., would ever have<br/>
given Nobunaga the time of day, but all at some time<br/>
were under his control (though not all stayed that<br/>
way). <br/>
