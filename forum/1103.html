<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] bakumatsu background</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328067650">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
I've received a cultural exchange fellowship to spend three months in<br/>
Yamaguchi-ken from October to December this year to research a novel<br/>
which will be based on events in Choshu in the 1850s and 1860s. I'll<br/>
also be in Tokyo,  Osaka, Nagoya and Kagoshima for short periods. I've<br/>
been to the area I'm staying in before and know Hagi and Yamaguchi quite<br/>
well. I've been reading Craig, Jansen, Wilson etc. Has anyone got any<br/>
suggestions for:<br/>
1)further reading, especially social and women's history, or historical<br/>
novels (Japanese is a bit of the one page a day variety, but it's not<br/>
impossible - I'll have plenty of time for reading in rural Japan, and<br/>
can either buy books in Tokyo or get friends to order them for me)<br/>
2) places to visit that give a sense of everyday life in pre-Meiji and<br/>
Meiji times. museums, samurai houses, villages etc.<br/>
3) historians or writers who'd have time to talk to me (preferably in<br/>
English, but again, Japanese is not impossible.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
btw I've got a second hand copy of a book called Secrets of the Samurai<br/>
by Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook, published by Tuttle in 1973. Does<br/>
anyone know this book and what's your opinion of its accuracy?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Gillian<br/>

    I enjoy reading the various jounals of the European visitors in Japan at<br/>
that time, if you haven't I would look into Bird, Huesken and all the travel<br/>
books written just after the opening.<br/>
    For towns lost in Time try UCHIKO in Ehime pref. Be sure to check the<br/>
Japan Times for the "On the Archipelago" series for lots more.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] bakumatsu background</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-736962578">For books I recommend<br/>
<br/>
Women of the Mito Domain by Yamakawa Kikue, translated by Kate Wildman,<br/>
Stanford Un Press,  Shows a lot on the domestic side. the author was a<br/>
granddaughter of one of the samurai of mito<br/>
<br/>
Remembering by Shiba Goro translated by Teruko Craig, Hawaii Un Press. Gives<br/>
a view of the losing side.<br/>
<br/>
For novels try Shiba Ryotaro. he is Japans most popular historical writer.<br/>
Two books set in the bakumatsu period have been translated into English,<br/>
`The Last Shogun`and `Drunk as a lord`.<br/>
<br/>
You might already be familiar with the works of Totman, Beasley, Huber,<br/>
Statler, Akamatsu, Harootunian, Busch, Miyoshi, Barr, Williams.<br/>
<br/>
As for places to visit, well I live here in Osaka so I can recommend places<br/>
in Kansai. There is a Bakumatsu museum in Kyoto called Reizan Rekishikan. In<br/>
Osaka there is a new Prefecture Historical Museum. There are so many<br/>
preserved houses and buildings its hard to include them all, but there is<br/>
one newly reconstructed samurai house from the edo period near my home in<br/>
Neyagawa.<br/>
<br/>
As for people, there is a man here in Osaka, not an historian but a gude<br/>
interpreter with a good knowledge of local history. he organizes tours of<br/>
the area. His name is Paul Satoh, and his address is 3-6 Kori-Moto Machi<br/>
Neyagawa City 572-0083 Osaka Japan. He might not be available for personal<br/>
tours though. If not I could show you around. I have been here 8 years and<br/>
know my way around esp Kyoto, I go there almost twice month. If you are<br/>
interested let me know.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646612612">I forgot to mention in Kyoto there is Toei Eigamura, a movie theme park<br/>
where they film a lot of samurai dramas. You can see a lot of recreations of<br/>
various Edo and Meiji houses and buildings. Also in Gifu there is Meiji mura<br/>
where many buildings from the Meiji period have been transplanted and<br/>
preserved. That was quite an amazing place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55421550">Tom, that's good advice, - have read Bird and will track down the<br/>
others. Uchiko looks pretty interesting - may have to put Shikoku into<br/>
the itinerary.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

by email and let you know my dates.<br/>

Many thanks again, I'm really grateful.<br/>
