<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701130844">To make it clear Zen was and is a religion. I have so often heard <br/>
this idea that Zen is a philosophy, not a religion. This comes in <br/>
America mostly from the 60's and 70's and the explosion of what one <br/>
of my teachers called Californian Buddhism. Psuedospirtual wannabes <br/>
who wanted to rebel against Jeudo-Christian thought read a book or <br/>
two and started teaching their misunderstandings to others. A <br/>
perfect example that is thrown around a lot in America... "the world <br/>
is only an illusion". No the world is very real, Zen does not teach <br/>
that the world is in any way an illusion. What is the illusion is <br/>
how we see the world due to our own mental attachments, which keep <br/>
us from seeing how it really is. Zen is a religion, just because <br/>
there is usually no mention of god/s, devil/s, heaven or hell doe <br/>
not keep it from being a religion. Zen does not teach these things <br/>
do not exist, but rather if they do or not is unimportant to the <br/>
goal of Zen. With some alterations Zen can be practiced as a <br/>
philosophy instead of a religion, i mean the idea of rebirth life <br/>
time after life time is religious and would have to be removed to <br/>
practice it purely as a philosophy, in its original context Zen is a <br/>
religious teaching. This is not to say that the idea of <br/>
philosophical Zen is wrong.... rather keep in mind that it is a <br/>
philosophy based on a religion. As much as I don't like to do <br/>
this... it would KIND OF (and I am stressing kind of)be like someone <br/>
saying they followed the teachings of Jesus without believing he was <br/>
the son of God. That's the best Western comparison I can think of. <br/>
So yes, if you change some things Zen can be practiced as a <br/>
philosophy and not a religion.... but to say that it IS NOT a <br/>
religion is a misunderstanding of Zen.</div>

This group is probably not the proper place for is. That being said <br/>
though I have to mention some of the faluts in the arguement presented <br/>
agasint Zen as a religion. There are teachings. A follower of <br/>
religious Zen takes part in such rituals as the Boddhisatva vow and <br/>
seeking refuge in the three jewels. There are books. Just to list a <br/>
few: Shobogenzo, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, Perfection of <br/>
Wisdom is also used sometimes, some times even the Lotus Sutra. I will <br/>
ignore the argument about gods because that is complex and I want to <br/>
keep this short, other than saying you are correct that generally gods <br/>
are not represented. If you have the 27 years of experience you claim <br/>
to have, I would think you would have heard of at least a few books <br/>
written by Chinese and Japanese Zen masters. Such masters also do <br/>
write about past and future lifetimes and karma and duhka and samsara <br/>
and many other core Buddhist concepts. One thing Zen strongly rejects <br/>
that is often common in Chinese/Japanese Buddhism is the comcept of <br/>
mappo.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I used to study sumi-e at a Zen Buddhist church, sorry Zen is an <br/>
offshoot of Buddhism. It is a religion, check out some of the official <br/>
websites for the various sects or visit a Zen temple and find out.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sotozen-net.or.jp/kokusai/kokusai.htm">http://www.sotozen-net.or.jp/kokusai/kokusai.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Go halfway down and see:<br/>
Words from the Buddhist Scriptures and Records of the Patriarchs  	<br/>
<br/>
Oops these look like writings to me, oh no! they have patriarchs as <br/>
well. I'm not sure if you can call the original Buddha a prophet or not, <br/>
mostly they think of him as a teacher. Are there Buddhist gods? Good <br/>
question, I would say some sects think there are, but Japanese gods <br/>
aren't the all powerful beings like Western religions.<br/>
<br/>
Even a cursory hunt for information on Japanese Zen Buddhist sects in a <br/>
good library or a local temple will turn this information up, so you <br/>
don't have to trust the web.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend studying English, your e-mail gives the impression that <br/>
you are rude and illiterate, certainly not someone who has seriously <br/>
studied Zen for many years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988799631">Well said my friend. Very good. at least now we have someone who <br/>
writes the real stuff about Zen. Zen is derived from the teravada <br/>
buddhism. Just like the tibetan buddhism, chinese/japanese <br/>
buddhism.After buddhism came to their countries, it mixed with their <br/>
culture. That is why i always encourage people to learn from the <br/>
original. The root of all. besides the teravada buddhism(original), <br/>
all are called/catogorised under the Mahayana. Some have lost the <br/>
essense of the Buddha's teaching.  <br/>
<br/>
           The story is long. Just know that Zen is a type of <br/>
buddhism. Like all types of buddhism. There is no god. So it is not <br/>
right to say that Zen is a religion. Like all Budhism, the mind is <br/>
utmost important. Yoga practisioner, Kung Fu masters, martial <br/>
atists.....blah blah blah.....etc are practicing Samatha meditation. <br/>
Only buddhist do Vipasana meditation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. The religion <br/>
which based on experience, which refuses dogmatic. If there's any <br/>
religion that would cope the scientific needs it will be Buddhism."-<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Zen and Samurai Warriors</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-135606049">Zen is Buddhism. Zen is not something seperate from Buddhism. <br/>
 <br/>
 Any claim against this shows a deep lack of the Buddha's teachings and the nature of reality-itself... and ultimately, it shows a deep lack of experience with Zen.<br/>
 <br/>
 Simple as that.<br/>
 <br/>
The same thing that is happening to Zen (westerners trying to colonize Zen) is happening to the Tibetan's Dzogchen teachings.<br/>
����� It is not an issue of actual doctrine--- it is an attempt to colonize the parts of the religion that are "cool" without keeping the parts that are "uncool" (the vows and logic). <br/>
 <br/>
 ����� The same thing also happens to native american spiritual teachings. People always just read a little  bit in a book and they colonize the "cool" parts and leave behind the "uncool" parts.<br/>
 <br/>
 This is usually because the colonizers want to "look cool" and "feel cool" with the looks and fun parts... but, because they are ultimately atheist or Christian, they disregard the actual religious traditions because they are still afraid to go to Hell.<br/>
  For example, people like to "mellow out and just relax"... and pretend that they are doing some kinda of Zen ... but they don't  believe in reincarnation because "They are Christian".. <br/>
 Seriously.. Zen without Dharma ? No such thing. <br/>
   ����� Zen without Dharma is only a corrupted mental image of Zen.<br/>
������ ����� It does not correspond to the reality .... and it lacks direct perception.   <br/>
 <br/>
   ����� Dzogchen is Buddhism.  Zen is Buddhism.<br/>
 <br/>
 Why?<br/>
 <br/>
 ����� Because Garab Dorje was a Buddhist. Bodhidharma was a Buddhist. Manhjushrimitra was a Buddhist..etc.etc.etc..<br/>
 <br/>
 These are Buddhist teachings.<br/>
 <br/>
 ����� Buddhism = Triple Refuge, Four Seals, Four Truths, Eight fold-path on a minimum...<br/>
 <br/>
 ����� Just because the form and path may be various, as long as a teaching is in accordance with those 4 minimums listed above, it is a "Buddhist" teaching.<br/>
 <br/>
  ����� So, "Buddhism" just means "Teachings in accordance with the Buddha's Teachings".<br/>
 ����� <br/>
   Where the word Buddhism is used, we should insert the word "Dharma".<br/>
 <br/>
��������� So..<br/>
 <br/>
 Zen is Dharma.<br/>
 Dzogchen is Dharma.<br/>
 <br/>
���������������� ����� If your Zen is not Dharma, it is not Zen.<br/>
��������������������� If Dzogchen is not Dharma, it is not Dzogchen.<br/>
 <br/>
���������� ����� Please stop getting "religion" from a book. <br/>
���������������� Please stop "spiritual shopping"--- you disrespect these ancient traditions by piece-n-piece patchwork quilting them into YOUR desired result. <br/>
������  ����� <br/>
������������   ����� Since this forum is about Samurai... let us end on that note :<br/>
 <br/>
����������������� "Make your choice. Follow it correctly and follow it to its conclusion.<br/>
Any variation along the way is nothing more than your inability to commit showing forth."<br/>
 <br/>
