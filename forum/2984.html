<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-529117374">According to the 'Sengoku Jinmei Jiten', the dates for Ujizane are <br/>
1538-1614 --<br/>
<br/>
IMAGAWA Ujizane 1538-1614 <br/>
Daimyô of Suruga and Tôtômi Ruled: 1560-1570 <br/>
Battles: War with Takeda (1568-1570) <br/>
Notes: Ujizane was the son of Imagawa Yoshimto and became Daimyô <br/>
following the death of his father at Okehazama in 1560. He suffered <br/>
the loss of his Matsudaira vassals soon afterwards and managed to <br/>
alienate many of his retainers due to his often thoughtless nature. <br/>
Between 1561 and 1565, he felt compelled to execute or quell a <br/>
number of his men, including Ii Naochika (1562) and Iiô Tsurutatsu <br/>
(1565). He came into conflict with the Takeda and although Ujizane <br/>
was the son of Takeda Shingen's sister, the latter invaded Suruga in <br/>
1568 while Tokugawa Ieyasu attacked Tôtômi. As Ujizane was married <br/>
to a daughter of Hôjô Ujiyasu, the Hôjô offered the Imagawa <br/>
assistance but to no avail. By 1570 Shingen had taken Sumpu and <br/>
Ujizane essentially surrendered to Tokugawa Ieyasu from Kakegawa <br/>
Castle. He retired to Kyoto in 1575 and had hopes that he might <br/>
recieve Sumpu once the Takeda were defeated in 1582, but Nobunaga <br/>
refused to allow Tokugawa to do this. He eventually joined Tokugawa <br/>
at Edo, having taken the name Sôkan and the tonsure. He was <br/>
supported by Ieyasu until his death in 1614.<br/>

he has 11 years and Ujizane 10 years.But I think sometimes it's <br/>
<br/>
konnichi wa, tomodachi,<br/>
While I generally like Mr. Turnbulls works in print (although I <br/>
dissagree with him on many points...) and while I enjoy the <br/>
game he helped author - it is a fine. playable game... I cannot <br/>
say that I agree with the games historical accuracy. <br/>
Turnbull had to take many ideas and try to combine them into a <br/>
playable thing...but it does not follow in any real way a plausable <br/>
time line...and the added bits in the "gold" edition are bung...<br/>
By setting up scenarios that could be played out in a game like <br/>
fashion, Turnbull turned aside historical accuracy, and settled for <br/>
a paycheck.<br/>
I am sure he knows that, and I am not trying to take him to task...<br/>
I would truely like to see a game set up that involves much more <br/>
detail - political intrigue...more families...more plausable <br/>
variations on time line and equipment...<br/>
The evolution that occured in terms of equipment, morals and <br/>
strategy were profound during the sengoku jidai...and the game <br/>
could easilly show that...(and for buddha's sake, either make the <br/>
lovely geisha in the palace room interactive or get rid of her...she <br/>
is a distraction!!! :-) )<br/>
The game is a good start, and I hope he sees fit to add much <br/>
more to it...then it could be a historical teaching tool...and then <br/>
would be much more enjoyable...<br/>
Even if scenarios end up differently from real history after a solid <br/>
start...so be it...at least then one could have a real sence of..."if I <br/>
did this under these circumstances, then what might have <br/>
happened..."<br/>
And if he would like to include the mongol invasions, then <br/>
perhaps he should confine them to the real historical setting...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just ranting thoughts...<br/>

The first record of the word Geisha dates 1751. Geisha were <br/>
subsequently recognized as professional entertainers by the Tokugawa <br/>
govt in 1779. Sure, before geisha there were entertainers and <br/>
courtesans 'similar' to them (tayu, etc.), but they were no Geisha <br/>
(=artists), more likely, fancy prostitutes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(1) Again: geisha were NOT active in the Sengoku period. Here is what <br/>
the Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan has about their history: "The geisha <br/>
system emerged around the mid-Edo (=Tokugawa) period (1600�1868). The <br/>
first geisha were male entertainers and thus the first such women were <br/>
designated onna (female) geisha. Gradually such entertaining became a <br/>
female occupation. By the 1700s the profession of geisha was associated <br/>
with the government-licensed brothel quarters. From the end of the Edo <br/>
period to the present, geisha have had considerable connection with <br/>
politics, as the teahouses provided convenient gathering places for <br/>
political meetings. Geisha find it professionally in their interest to <br/>
be closemouthed about what goes on at these gatherings, but even so, <br/>
opposition factions seldom patronize the same geisha."<br/>
--- So, as you see, they are a 18th c. phenomenon, as I wrote in a <br/>
previous message.<br/>
<br/>
(2) The areas you mention, the Pleasure Quarters as well, were <br/>
organized once again during the Tokugawa period. The whole popular <br/>
genroku cultured emerged from such settlements.<br/>
<br/>
(3) Geisha had played an important role politically, during the Meiji <br/>
Restoration, and even in more recent times in 20th c. Tokyo (tea <br/>
politics).<br/>
<br/>
(4) Finally, I believe is a good idea to point out how today's geisha <br/>
(and maiko) are NOT prostitutes, but high-class entertainers. While <br/>
sexual services were a part of their work in the past, they had always <br/>
been different from ordinary prostitutes, for the simple reason that <br/>
geisha are trained in the traditional arts - prostitutes are not. <br/>
Today's geisha are professional musicians and dancers, and testimonial <br/>
of a disappearing past. I know a few of them personally, and I can <br/>
guarantee they're fantastic women, whose lives are dedicated to art - <br/>
not to selling their bodies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921063116">I am relatively new to the scene but I found this which will help I think.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-Geisha<br/>
<br/>
Whilst geisha are relatively modern in their emergence, dating back to the <br/>
early 1700�s, �geisha-type� women have existed since the earliest history of <br/>
Japan. Two notable predecessors to geisha were the Saburuko, who came onto <br/>
the scene at the end of the seventh century, and the Shirabyoshi, who <br/>
emerged during the late Heian � early Kamakura period (1185-1333AD).<br/>
<br/>
Saburuko, (ones who serve), were the result of an increasing social <br/>
displacement towards the end of the seventh century. Many women found <br/>
themselves having to become wanderers, who, in order to survive, had to <br/>
resort to trading their sexual favours. Whilst most of these women were from <br/>
the lower class, there were among them women who were quite educated and <br/>
talented. These particular Saburuko who were talented dancers and singers <br/>
often found themselves invited to entertain at aristocratic gatherings.<br/>
