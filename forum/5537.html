<h3>Samurai Saturdays on IFC</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102587565">Roll out of bed and into feudal Japan every Saturday morning with <br/>
IFC's Samurai Saturdays. Each week we present a classic samurai film <br/>
from the masters of Japanese cinema. <br/>
<br/>
The Life of Masseur Ichi<br/>
The first of the legendary Zatoichi movies introduces Shintaro Katsu <br/>
as the blind masseur/swordsman and reluctant hero who, while trying <br/>
to practice his trade as a masseur, finds himself involved in a gang <br/>
war. <br/>
Saturday, Dec 4 at 8am ET<br/>
<br/>
The Return of Masseur Ichi<br/>
Zatoichi tries to resume a peaceful life, but when he discovers that <br/>
that the feudal lord employing him is mentally deranged, the lord's <br/>
samurais try to kill him to protect the secret and themselves. <br/>
Saturday, Dec 11 at 8am ET<br/>
<br/>
Masseur Ichi Enters Again<br/>
Zatoichi returns to his home village and Yajuro Banno, his mentor. <br/>
He finds himself falling in love with Banno's sister, but his <br/>
teacher derides his proposal, more interested in enlisting <br/>
Zatoichi's help in a kidnapping scheme. <br/>
Saturday, Dec 18 at 8am ET <br/>
<br/>
Masseur Ichi, The Fugitive <br/>
When a defenseless woman is killed by an assassin sent after <br/>
Zatoichi, the blind swordsman's rage is such that he goes after the <br/>
every member of the gang that hired the man until he can finally <br/>
face him in the ultimate duel. <br/>
