Punishment and Power in the Making of Modern Japan <br/>
<br/>
By Daniel V. Botsman <br/>
<br/>
Princeton: Princeton University Press <br/>
<br/>
ISBN 0-691-11491-9, 319 pp, $35 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Daniel V. Botsman, associate professor of Japanese history at <br/>
Harvard University, has written a crisp, nuanced account of Japan's <br/>
transition to modernity by focusing on the transformation of the <br/>
country's penal system. Disputing accounts that stress there were <br/>
already roots of modernity before the Meiji Restoration of 1868, <br/>
Botsman argues that many Meiji Era (1868-1912) reforms-specifically <br/>
the establishment of a modern penal system-represented a clear <br/>
rupture with the past. Even as Botsman emphasizes the discontinuous <br/>
nature of many Meiji Era reforms, however, he challenges simplistic <br/>
accounts that interpret the modernization of Japan's penal system as <br/>
marking a shift from barbarism to civilization. <br/>
<br/>
Like their counterparts throughout the world at the time, Tokugawa <br/>
Shogunate (1603-1867) authorities developed horrifying ways of <br/>
punishing and executing criminals. Botsman provides graphic details <br/>
of those punishments, including extreme forms such as the <br/>
domestically developed type of crucifixion pictured on the book's <br/>
cover (numerous graphics augment the book's strengths). In addition, <br/>
public display of criminals' corpses was a means for the authorities <br/>
to warn people to behave. <br/>
<br/>
Botsman concludes: "Tokugawa punishments were never acts of <br/>
unthinking violence. They formed part of a sophisticated system for <br/>
maintaining order that was not entirely lacking in restraint or <br/>
compassion. For example, the fact that a retainer would be punished <br/>
far more harshly for stealing from his lord than from a social equal <br/>
represented the need to uphold a particular status system. Moreover, <br/>
there was considerable room for benevolence in the system, and the <br/>
authorities often overlooked various offenses." <br/>
<br/>
Botsman details how in the mid-19th century, representatives of <br/>
Western countries, without understanding the complexity of the <br/>
Tokugawa system of punishment, labeled it uncivilized and invoked it <br/>
to justify extraterritoriality. This was the provision in the <br/>
unequal treaties requiring that foreigners accused of crimes be <br/>
tried by consular officials from their own countries rather than by <br/>
Japanese officials. <br/>
<br/>
To win the confidence of the Western powers, Japan's new leaders <br/>
created a system of punishment characterized by modern jails based <br/>
on European and American models. They outlawed dramatic forms of <br/>
public punishment and decreed that executions be carried out only <br/>
for particularly heinous crimes and only by hanging. They otherwise <br/>
eliminated corporal punishment. In its place, however, the state <br/>
jailed more people, including thousands for dissenting against the <br/>
new government. <br/>
<br/>
It took decades for Japan to convince the West that its modernized <br/>
legal system, which included a system of jails advertised as <br/>
reforming criminals by putting them to work, showed the nation had <br/>
reached a level of civilization that merited elimination of the <br/>
unequal treaties. <br/>
<br/>
Western visitors to Japan such as Isabella Bird, after observing <br/>
prisoner work gangs, wrote approvingly of the practice, which <br/>
supposedly served both to better the prisoners and develop the <br/>
country. Botsman, however, questions whether the practice of <br/>
literally working thousands of prisoners to death to extract coal <br/>
and build roads, especially in newly colonized Hokkaido, represented <br/>
a higher stage of civilization. <br/>
<br/>
The author's interpretation of the intersection of penal systems and <br/>
modernity becomes most fascinating with his account of Japan's <br/>
acquisition of an overseas empire, the quintessential marker of a <br/>
civilized country in the late 19th century, as a result of its <br/>
victory over China in 1895. With its appropriation of Taiwan, Japan <br/>
earned the right to institute a colonial penal system. <br/>
<br/>
Botsman's account of the double standard used to justify such <br/>
practices as flogging, first applied to colonial subjects in Taiwan <br/>
and then used extensively in Korea, demonstrates the blatant <br/>
prejudice that underlays the placement of some countries into the <br/>
category of civilized and others into the category of uncivilized <br/>
during the heyday of imperialism. <br/>
<br/>
Japan initially built a showcase prison in Taiwan's capital and <br/>
applied the same system of punishment used in the homeland. Before <br/>
long, however, the colonial authorities concluded that the local <br/>
Chinese and Taiwanese were at such a low level of civilization that <br/>
incarceration in a modern prison, far from being a reforming <br/>
punishment, was a luxury. <br/>
<br/>
Japanese colonial authorities thereby decided in 1904 to institute <br/>
flogging, which was outlawed in Japan proper, in Taiwan. According <br/>
to Botsman, most Western commentators, far from condemning this <br/>
hypocrisy, as did some ideologically consistent Japanese members of <br/>
the penal-reform movement, applauded the Japanese for having come to <br/>
understand that civilized forms of punishment were ineffective in <br/>
keeping the natives in place. Far from undermining Japan's place in <br/>
the self-appointed club of civilized nations, the use of harsh <br/>
punishments against colonial subjects earned Japan additional <br/>
respect from other imperialist powers that employed similar brutal <br/>
methods. <br/>
<br/>
This is a sophisticated and yet accessible work of history that I <br/>
recommend heartily. <br/>
