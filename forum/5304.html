 </span></blockquote>True--which is easier when you can pack it on a horse<br/>
as opposed to putting it on a ship, but point well<br/>
taken. The problem would be how much foraging would<br/>
they be able to do, while harassed by samurai guerrila<br/>
fighters? Who knows. <br/>

mounted archers didn't fare so well against clouds of<br/>
arrows launched by mass formations of Mongols, as the<br/>
samurai found out to their chagrin. Nor did the<br/>
Mongols respond to well to a samurai riding out,<br/>
shouting his lineage, and challenging them to<br/>
individual combat. They had to adapt, and did so. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833655733">Hi Lilith, The Mongol army numbered some where in the region of  a hundred<br/>
and forty thousand men + horses ,  armouries , medical personnel, cooks,<br/>
grooms etc etc.etc. It would have been impossible to feed and supply this<br/>
amount by foraging. They would have needed to transport  supplies by sea, no<br/>
mean feat in those days with storms etc. Although Nate made the valid point<br/>
that the sailors would have been Chinese and Koreans, who were excellent<br/>
seafarers. I still think it would have been a mammoth task. They would have<br/>
been dependent on good weather and as the "Divine wind" proved, you cant<br/>
rely on that.    Denny. - Original Message ----- <br/>
