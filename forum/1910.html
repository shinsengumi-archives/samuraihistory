<h3>Think about it...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914093699">Thinking about coming to SanFrancisco for the big sword show in August?<br/>
<br/>
It just got a whole lot easier to get around; as of Sunday BART our <br/>
local rapid transit system goes all the way to Millbrae, just south <br/>
of the airport and a short 3 dollar cab ride from the Marriot.<br/>
<br/>
Now you can stay anywhere in the bay area at the cheapest hotel you <br/>
like and you won't need to rent a car to see all those undiscovered <br/>
treasures! The Steehead Brewery is the same distance away from the <br/>
train station so at the end of the day you don't need to go home <br/>
hungry or most importantly THIRSTY!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all there...<br/>
