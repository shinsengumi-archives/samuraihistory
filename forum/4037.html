<div id="ygrps-yiv-332605639">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
  Personally I would have to go with the Ikeda (Ikedaya) Incident.  Since it <br/>
was during the bakumatsu it still, techincally, involves samurai but I do <br/>
not think Okita (the character I admire from this story) himself was a <br/>
samurai which is why I did not vote for him in the famous/favorite samurai <br/>
poll.  The part of the event that captures my attention is the actions of <br/>
Okita Souji, first squad leader of the Shinsengumi.  He was in his very <br/>
early 20s, mayhaps even late teens, when he participated in that raid.  He <br/>
had been suffering from tubercluosis for years but had kept it hidden from <br/>
all but the highest members of the Shinsengumi.  He fought that night and <br/>
managed to survive unharmed up until he took out his last opponent.  From <br/>
what I understand after he delivered the killing blow he coughed up a <br/>
substantial amount of blood and proceeded to pass out.<br/>
  Call it what you will.  Bushido.  Honor.  Loyalty.  Whatever.  I call it <br/>
being a man.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>
