<h3>Japanese Swords</h3>
by <i>zevlord</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-963790647">Hi all,<br/>
	I understand there are three main types of swords:<br/>
<br/>
Long Sword (Daito): over 2 shaku in length; there are the longer of <br/>
the two swords commonly worn by the samurai; difficult to temper a <br/>
daito because of its length. <br/>
<br/>
Medium Sword (Wakizashi): 1~2 shaku in length; worn by samurai as <br/>
auxiliary sword, or by non-samurai, who were allowed to wear no more <br/>
than one sword of this length. <br/>
<br/>
Short Sword (Tanto): less than 1 shaku in length; the shorter of the <br/>
two swords worn by the samurai as auxiliary swords. Women and <br/>
tradesmen used them as protective weapons. Commonly called as hara-<br/>
kiri knives. They are usually the hira-zukuri (without ridgeline) <br/>
types.<br/>
<br/>
Was just wondering if anyone can elaberate on the names, styes and <br/>
types of these swords used between the Muromachi period and the Edo <br/>
period.</div>

<br/>
Almost all. Especially the Edo period shows a drop in the quality but<br/>
the styles and types are all represented, more or less frequently,<br/>
following fashions and law restrictions. Nodachi, Nagamaki, Ken are<br/>
probably the less copied, but even them were produced. A few in<br/>
Kirihazukuri and in Kogarasuzukuri too, both in katana and wakizashi<br/>
length. Think that donation to Shrines were common in peacetime too. <br/>
Naturally the term "used" is quite inadequate to the Edo period swords.<br/>
Muromachi saw more practical blades and mountings.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577798243">The short answer is "Yes",<br/>
	there is alot more to it though, many better writers have covered <br/>
this. I suggest you visit the sword index and look under glossaries and <br/>
READ the section on Sugata; changes in the shape if nihonto. There are <br/>
endless links there to follow as well. The Muromachi period encompasses <br/>
some tremendous changes, I am sure you'll get a handle on it by <br/>
visiting here;<br/>

  There is also the no-daito (no-dachi) which is around 3 shaku or longer.  <br/>
It was used primarily as a cavalry sword though there are instances that I <br/>
have heard of where it was used on foot.  Though I am sure that they were <br/>
extreme cases since weilding 3+ shaku katana is a muchly different <br/>
experience than the more typical 2.0 - 2.5 shaku katana.<br/>
  As a matter of general court procedures during the Edo (Tokugawa) period <br/>
the daito was removed when entering someone elses house and the visitor was <br/>
left with the shoto (wakizashi) and their tanto.<br/>
  There are two other "blades" that are often overlooked as being part of <br/>
the common accoutrements of the samurai, the kogai and the kozuka.  The <br/>
kogai is, for the most part, the stick that you often see in the topknot of <br/>
the Edo period men.  It is adorned with the kamon of the carrier and, <br/>
according to what I have been told by my Iaido sensei, it was used to mark a <br/>
slain opponent by sticking it into their Achilles' tendon.  Also, if the tip <br/>
had enough of an edge, it could be used as a shuriken since the original <br/>
shuriken were merely short knives, not throwing stars.<br/>
  The kozuka is basically a 3 or 4 inch blade that was stored in the saya <br/>
(sheath) and could be pulled out through the tsuba (hand guard).  This knife <br/>
was often used as a utility knife for cutting rope, fruit, etc.  Though in <br/>
the hands of a skilled samurai it could be used as a close quarters weapon <br/>
or as a shuriken.<br/>
  Hopefully this has helped in some way.  If anyone knows something that I <br/>
have mis-stated please do correct me.  I do not yet have the wealth of <br/>
knowledge that some on this list have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
