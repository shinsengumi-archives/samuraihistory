<h3>Question</h3>
by <i>dconfrost_chasez21</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740222219">I've just browsed through the Top Ten Misconception about samurais, <br/>
and one of it discusses about bushido. I'm kinda confused...<br/>
It states that bushido was "meant to keep samurais subservient to <br/>
their employing daimyos," however, when I read the book by Inazo <br/>
Nitobe, "Bushido: the Soul of Japan," it never mentions anything <br/>
about it.. he mentioned that bushido was practiced by some samurais <br/>
even before the edo era. It only flourished during does times but <br/>
not exactly created during those periods. Does it mean that Bushido <br/>
was created not to refine the samurais but to stop them form doing <br/>
atrocities?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632551732">The Bushido as we've come to know it is entirely an Edo invention. <br/>
When I wrote that it was meant to keep samurai subservient to their <br/>
employing daimyo, I didn't mean the whole thing, I meant the more <br/>
famous aspects such as serving your master to the ends of the earth. <br/>
Certainly, some ideals in the Bushido existed before the Edo era <br/>
(for example, the Confucian ideal of putting the group/clan ahead of <br/>
the individual was a basic notion amongst all Japanese for quite a <br/>
time before the Edo era), but the general ideal did not.<br/>
I'd be careful about reading books about the Bushido... for example, <br/>
I don't think Yamamoto Tsunetomo was too eager to admit that <br/>
the "glorious bushido" he preached didn't exist in the Sengoku era <br/>
that he apparently longed for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	"Bushido" really is an Edo period idea, prior to that there were codes <br/>
of conduct written and unwritten, explicit and implied. They were never <br/>
universal or absolute, often differing ideas took hold in different <br/>
parts of the country. During the Edo period, it became much more <br/>
"codified" and infused with Tokugawa-esque confusianism and was <br/>
promulgated nationwide. The overall message was one of obedience to <br/>
social mores and law and lord. It is seen today as a political tool <br/>
used to suppress opposition but may have only been a sincere reflection <br/>
of the ideals of the House of Tokugawa and not a calculated policy.<br/>
	I think you'll find the true ideals of the samurai in the chronicles, <br/>
art and music from prior to the Pax Tokugawa...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231195404">Hi All,<br/>
   <br/>
    No one came from U.S.A. as the commander like Tom Cruise  to become the warrior helping the old power like Ken Watanabe in real History of Japan.<br/>
  However,  the civil war ? between the old power and the new power was occurred really at the end of Edo era.  And the new power defeated the other one to establish New Government , Meiji Government.<br/>
   <br/>
  By the way ,  do you know who did open Japan's door which used be closed against foreign countries ?<br/>
   <br/>
    Since then,  Japan really were forced to be changed, to be revoluted to face with barbarians through The pacific Ocean's war.<br/>
   <br/>
    Japan got  the tiny bud   of destiny to fight against them later at that time.<br/>
   <br/>
    Your comment on the above will be highly appreciated.<br/>

Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
No one came from U.S.A. as the commander like Tom Cruise to become the warrior helping the old power like Ken Watanabe in real History of Japan.<br/>
However, the civil war ? between the old power and the new power was occurred really at the end of Edo era. And the new power defeated the other one to establish New Government , Meiji Government.<br/>
<br/>
By the way , do you know who did open Japan's door which used be closed against foreign countries ?<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Japan really were forced to be changed, to be revoluted to face with barbarians through The pacific Ocean's war.<br/>
<br/>
Japan got the tiny bud of destiny to fight against them later at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Your comment on the above will be highly appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
The events in the movie? No. Some of the characters and events are VERY LOOSELY based on real history, but 99% of it is Holywood fantasy. Read the book 'The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori' by Mark Ravina for the real history behind the character Katsumoto was based on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-229553941">" However,  the civil war ? between the old power and the new  power was <br/>

one to establish New Government , Meiji Government."<br/>
 <br/>
Yes and no. Many of those who rebelled were those who support the  emperor. <br/>
Both sides used firearms, it wasn't like the movie were they rebelled  <br/>
because of the modernization. Too many times we put simple answers to complex  <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
"By the way ,  do you know who  did open Japan's door which used be closed <br/>
against foreign countries ?"<br/>
 <br/>
The Dutch had a trading post since the 1400's in Japan. The shogunate  at <br/>
the time of the opening had a model of a working steam engine (that they  <br/>
built), a working blast furnace and a model of wire communication. They also <br/>
had  access to modern (at the time) medical books. They knew what was coming, <br/>
but  they wanted to control the information as to keep  power.<br/>
<br/>
Since then,  Japan  really were forced to be changed, to be revoluted to <br/>
face with barbarians  through The pacific Ocean's war.<br/>
<br/>
Forced? Not really,Once again it comes down to power and the control of  <br/>
it. The shogunate held information so they could control it and prevent the  <br/>
daimyo's from getting it and using it to over throw them (which they did). <br/>
The  best example is firearms, which the at the end other Daimyo got a hold of <br/>
and  used them to challenge the shogunate. <br/>
<br/>
There is much out there that is misunderstood about the Samurai. My  <br/>
personal favorite is the way Bushido was twisted to serve the daimyo so they  <br/>
could better control those below them. For example the myth of a "Samurai would  <br/>
rather die than face surrender or defeat". This was not at all true, many <br/>
diamyo  and their forces surrendered, switched sides and lost battles and <br/>
guess  what? They live! With no shame. It was later, that this was put in. By <br/>
people  (Nobles) who wanted to ensure loyalty. <br/>

It's not often I feel I can contribute to a thread, but I do recall reading that before 1600 an oft heard call on the battlefield was "Uragiri" - treachery, or betrayal!!  Yo - yet another faction had changed sides...<br/>
<br/>
Here is a movie about betrayal:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304318/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304318/</a><br/>
<br/>

(tiny url:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tiny.cc/qIsZb)">http://tiny.cc/qIsZb)</a><br/>
<br/>
I found this movie title with Toshiro Mifune<br/>
SURONIN MAKARI TORU: YATATE TOGE NI URAGIRI O MITA (1983) Directed by Tachikazu Takamori<br/>
Lowly Ronin Returns: Betrayal at Yatate Pass (Toshiro Mifune).<br/>
<br/>
So it seems betrayal is a strong theme in both samurai history still represented in current cinema.<br/>
