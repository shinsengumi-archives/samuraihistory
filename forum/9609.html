<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683379998">I'm not sure if any of you are aware, but there is a company called Osprey Publishing that <br/>
specializes in military history books.  I am currently attempting to persuade them to issue <br/>
some books on the Battle of Ueno since I have hardly been able to find any books on the <br/>
battle in English.  If you have an interest in seeing an English-language book written about <br/>
them, please send them an email.  You can get their conact info at <br/>
www.ospreypublishing.com.  Just a few minutes of your time and we might be able to <br/>
persuade them to make a valuable contribution to military history students.</div>
