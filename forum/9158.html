 </span></blockquote>If the war tales like the Heike Monogatari and the Taiheiki are to be<br/>
believed, then a samurai might ride ahead of the army, announce his name<br/>
and pedigree, and challenge someone from the opposing army to attack<br/>
him. One example from Helen Craig McCullough's translation of the<br/>
Taiheiki, where two warriors race ahead of their own army to be first in<br/>
to battle:<br/>
 <br/>
"We are the lay monk Hitomi Shiro On'a, aged seventy-two, a resident of<br/>
the province of Musashi, and Homma Kuro Sukesada, aged thirty-six, a<br/>
resident of the province of Sagami, who since leaving Kamakura have been<br/>
resolved to perish in battle ahead of our comrades! Let those who are<br/>
self-confident come forth to observe the degree of our skill!"<br/>
 <br/>
Challenges like this were an attempt to earn recognition on the<br/>
battlefield, which was the best way for a samurai to be rewarded for his<br/>
service. If the samurai died the rewards earned by his valour would be<br/>
passed on to his family, which was the intent of the two warriors above.<br/>
 <br/>
Acts like this would likely have been far more usual in Kamakura &<br/>
Muromachi (12th through 15th C.) times when armies were smaller and<br/>
battles more intimate than in Sengoku times when armies consisted mainly<br/>
of ashigaru foot soldiers acting in mass formations.<br/>

practice proved such a liability in fighting the mongols in the 13th<br/>
century, that this was largely abandoned after that. There are<br/>
occasional acts of this type recorded even into the Sengoku, but by<br/>
then it was probably so rare as to be a novelty. Yamanaka Shikanosuke<br/>
was challenged by Shinagawa Daisen during a seige of Gassan-toda<br/>
castle, and were allowed to fight it out in front of the two armies.<br/>
This was a little different, as they didn't march out and declare<br/>
names, I think the challenge to Shikanosuke was specific. But similar<br/>
concept.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621287527">Thanks for taking the time to respond. My work takes place in 1520, kinda hard to find info on this period. Could be why I chose it! Anyway, the 'battle' I have my hero in is not really a fight but a duel, first blood ends the challenge. It's done before the Court so I think the stating of lineage would be called for.<br/>
Again I appreciate everyone's time.<br/>
