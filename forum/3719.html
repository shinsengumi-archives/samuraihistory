<h3>Question concerning The Last Samurai</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297682184">Hi, I haven't checked this group in a while so I don't know if this<br/>
question has been address or not. It's about the movie The Last<br/>
Samurai, the lead samurai Katsumoto's head's shaven. I though that<br/>
this was a sign of disgrace among samurai, or that they had<br/>
relinquished to a priest's life...why did he have his head shaved?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That bothered me too (and I notice these things,<br/>
having no hair and all that). It usually was shaved if<br/>
the person took religious vows. <br/>

<h3>Re: Question concerning The Last Samurai</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-119548205">I believe the samurai would also cut their hair to swear or make a <br/>
vow.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but is that a possibility?   The <br/>
only other film that I can think of with a shaven samurai is the <br/>
Seven Samurai.  But he shaved his head to disguise himeslef as a <br/>
monk.  Plus, he was ronin which could change his attitude entirely.  <br/>
Long out of service with a lord, he didn't seem to think like the <br/>
average samurai.  To him, at that moment it was more important to <br/>
save the child in danger.<br/>
Is it possible that Saitoh Hajime could have shaved his head in a vow <br/>
or rebellion against some samurai traditions?  Perhaps, refuting one <br/>
of the more "important" samurai trademarks could emphasize his own <br/>
conviction to a greater degree.  A simple statement, "My commitment <br/>
to the Emperor and the Samurai class are more important than the <br/>
symbol of my rank in society."  <br/>

Of course, they could always have put one of those<br/>
fake samurai hairpieces on him, like in the Taiga<br/>
Drama. <br/>

story, like when Mark Hamill had that motorcycle accident and had<br/>
reconstructive surgery in his face (which is why it looks different<br/>
after Star Wars), Lucas made all that ice monster scene in The Empire<br/>

<h3>hair cut</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989926957">i suppose i missed most of the last samurai discussion, yet i guess<br/>
that a lot more went into that movie behind the facade of strong<br/>
speeches (which aren't that much cliché after all when you're not<br/>
quite an unsuspecting bystander to bushidô etc).<br/>
<br/>
by the way, what was a "samurai's haircut". in last samurai you see<br/>
the people having full hair (and losing it is regarded shameful), on<br/>
the other hand i have read that a samurai's forehead was shaven. so<br/>
this changed through the years, i suppose. or not?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
oh and by the way, yep, i'm new to this group. hail all you folks. as<br/>
an afterthought, excuse all typing and other errors, my left wrist is<br/>
malfunctioning (blame kendo), i'm not a native english speaker and i<br/>
don't ever read my emails twice before sending.<br/>

<h3>Re: hair cut</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125781360">Konnichi wa, tomodachi,<br/>
It has always been my understanding that there were several types of<br/>
haircuts for samurai as they went through their life. Most for men<br/>
involved shaving the pate of the head, but young boys would leave the<br/>
forelock intact, and draw it over the top and tie it with the rest of<br/>
the cue...<br/>
Keep in mind that there were samurai woman, too, and they did not<br/>
shave their heads.<br/>
It has also been an understanding that it was a shamefull thing to<br/>
have the top knot (wage) removed under combat circumstances, but a<br/>
samurai, on taking buddhist vows would shave their head.<br/>
This did not have to be polished, and obviously grew back in over<br/>
time, requiring maintenance, so could look bushy. I do not think this<br/>
would have been a disgrace, though.<br/>
Also, there were men who naturally went bald...and that would hardly<br/>
be a disgrace...<br/>
So, I do not think that the Samurai in the movie was living in shame,<br/>
as he had removed his own hair. <br/>
When the soldiers removed the son's wage, it was more of a fact that<br/>
he was humiliated in public, in front of other people. Not cool...yet<br/>
he chose to help his father in the final end-game, rather than just<br/>
kill himself.<br/>
Just thoughts<br/>
