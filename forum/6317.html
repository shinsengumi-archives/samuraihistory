You raise a credible point regarding just when that mystique enters the<br/>
matter, at least in some cultures:  but in European history, the mystique of<br/>
the sword definitely predates the decline of its use.  There are plenty of<br/>
medi√¶val works to support that.  As to the Japanese aspect - which is, after<br/>
all, what counts most here... well, I'd be very interested in the opinions<br/>
of some of the experts here on that score.<br/>
For my own part, well... back in college I was young and stupid enough to<br/>
fight in a duel.  (I wrote the girl a sonnet, her boyfriend challenged me<br/>
"in the name of her honour and the honour of the English language" ... well,<br/>
in retrospect he might have been right about the sonnet, gods know I've done<br/>
better since.)  It had a tremendous effect on my sense of appropriate<br/>
fighting range, but no appreciable effect on my sense of the mystique.<br/>
That, I've been hooked on since childhood.  I got pretty close to the<br/>
effects of the sword during that duel at dawn (and no, it was not to the<br/>
death, just blood); I've also taken a rapier thrust in the palm, and I once<br/>
had to sew up a friend's hand after some foolish horseplay because he<br/>
refused to go into a hospital.  Admittedly, I have not seen any<br/>
life-threatening or maiming injuries (at least from swordplay - as regards<br/>
bare-hand arts, that's another matter), but no:  none of it has reduced my<br/>
sense of the mystique of the sword.<br/>
I am certain that there are those who would say that I don't "know enough<br/>
about the object to appreciate it properly"...  but if you are using that as<br/>
a yardstick for this issue, then you would have to say also that pretty<br/>
nearly all the serious sworders I've encountered over the past thirty-odd<br/>
years don't know enough to appreciate swords properly either, since they all<br/>
seem to be subject to a view similar to mine (and in some cases, rather more<br/>
extreme)... at which point I have to ask, exactly who is in a position to<br/>
appreciate the thing properly, if not its serious practitioners?<br/>
I freely admit that my worldview leaves me subject to a fair bit of mystique<br/>
of one variety or another.  Suits me just fine.  There is ample mystery in<br/>
the world, and it pleases me to honour and respect that.<br/>

<br/>
There is a significant difference between appreciation and mystique.<br/>
<br/>
One can appreciate the craftsmanship of a sword, a piece of<br/>
calligraphy, a poem, a blossom, a tank, and F1 racing car ...<br/>
in fact just about anything.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favourite sights, when working in an office overlooking<br/>
S London (low skyline) was Conorde on the Heathrow approach.<br/>
<br/>
But that does not mean I am subject to the mystique of the thing.<br/>
<br/>
I have often wondered whether the mystique - the mystery - of the<br/>
sword stands in some way as a marker of man's removal, or distance,<br/>
from that which the sword represents.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the sword carried quite as much 'spiritual<br/>
significance' to the Sengoku and earlier samurai. Their approach was<br/>
somewhat more pragmatic. The sword represents them, rather than<br/>
they being symbolised by the sword. The names of sword, as discussed,<br/>
owe nothing to mystique, more to about how someone came into<br/>
possession of the blade.<br/>
<br/>
There was probably one called 'the shop on the corner'.<br/>
<br/>
Mystique - I don't think so - just the sepia-tinted voice of<br/>
ignorance, sentimentality and nostalgia.<br/>
<br/>
(If one hand to examine the effect of the sword close up, I bet that<br/>
goes some way to dispelling the mystique)<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I wonder whether 'mystique' occurs when one doesn't know<br/>
enough about the object to appreciate it properly?<br/>
