<h3>Listserve Rules</h3>
by <i>Christopher West</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169182143">I noticed that on other forums moderators randomly send out <br/>
the 'rules' of the forum for whatever reason, so I figured that since <br/>
I have never done so before, I would follow suit.  Here we go:<br/>
<br/>
-Ahem-<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the samuraihistory group at Yahoo! Groups, a <br/>
free, easy-to-use email group service.  Please <br/>
take a moment to review this message.<br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated forum.  Any off-topic posts may be ruthlessly <br/>
deleted at the moderator(s) discretion.  Please do not take offense <br/>
if one of your message is deleted, we are just trying to keep <br/>
everything on topic.  Follow up posts like "Thanks!" etc. are not <br/>
necessary and may be deleted at the discretion of the moderator(s). <br/>
<br/>
Moderated status is more or less temporary and hinge on the whim of <br/>
the moderator(s) - after you post a few interesting and useful <br/>
posts / replies you will be removed from moderated status, and be <br/>
free to post unmoderated at will. In VERY rare cases, you may be put <br/>
back on moderated status in cases of obvious abuse.<br/>
<br/>
If you do post consistently and feel you are contributing but have <br/>
not been removed from moderated status, blame the moderator(s) - <br/>
we've probably just overlooked you ;)<br/>
<br/>

status? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good question...  I guess only the moderators can check that... I <br/>
guess one way would be to post a message and see if it is available <br/>
within 1 or 2 minutes on the yahoo groups page, because it usually <br/>
takes one of us moderators somewhere between minutes and hours <br/>
to 'approve' a message - we have to log onto our email or the page to <br/>
check for messages, and then approve them - we don't do this full <br/>
time ;)<br/>
