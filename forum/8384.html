 </span></blockquote>I remember hearing this story from my father. Ushiwakamaru is the birth <br/>
name of Yoshitsune Minamoto and Musashibo Benkei was a monk famous for <br/>
his skill with the naginata. If I remember correctly Benkei had vowed <br/>
to collect 1000 swords to sell and build a temple. Ushiwakamaru had run <br/>
away from his home in Kuramayama temple and learned to be a skilled <br/>
swordsman from Tengu the samurai God of the forest. When Ushiwakamaru <br/>
and Benkei met at the Gojo bridge in Kyoto Benkei tried all of his <br/>
skill against the young boy to no success. Knowing he was in the <br/>
presence of greatness he threw down his weapon and became Ushiwakamarus <br/>
most trusted companion. <br/>
<br/>
I am going from memory and I'm sure the more highly educated people in <br/>
this group will send a multitude of messages correcting what I've <br/>
written. So make sure you read these corrections because as like a <br/>
baseball fan who can recite the batting average of a player in a game <br/>
played 75 years ago, these people really know their stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Was the birth name of Musashibo Benkei Oniwaka? And wasn't Ushiwakamaru<br/>
Shanou Yoshitsune or was it Yoshitsune Minamoto? If I am not mistaken, was<br/>
the event of Benkei's collecting swords at Gojo bridge after Heike clan<br/>
defeated Genji clan? And Yoshitsune was from Genji clan, and Benkei only<br/>
confiscated swords from the members of Heike clan.<br/>
<br/>
I also heard about this but not remember from where or who. I want to hear<br/>
the complete story from Japanese history masters of this group.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yoshitsune went by the adult name of Kuro (9th son) no Yoshitsune. His<br/>
birth name was Ushiwakamaru (dear young ox) and his coming of age name<br/>
was Shanao.<br/>
 <br/>
Benkei's collection of the Heike swords was, according to legend, prior<br/>
to the outbreak of the Gempei war, but some years after the defeat of<br/>
Yoshitomo (Yoshitsune's father) by the Taira.<br/>
