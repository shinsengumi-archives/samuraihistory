<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286872080">I'm not quite sure what point you are making, so please excuse me if my<br/>
reply is rather scatter-shot. From what I can see, you were questioning the<br/>
usefulness of citing two films, AFTER THE RAIN and SEPPUKU as possible<br/>
historical sources for dealing with the lives and conditions of Edo-period<br/>
ronin and also the Edo period ethic of "the sword is the soul of the<br/>
samurai."<br/>
<br/>
For your information: I cannot read in Japanese so my written sources are in<br/>
English or in English translation. <br/>
<br/>
Using fiction and film as historical sources: You are correct in that they<br/>
are films and not the same as historical documents. But many times<br/>
historical documents from the time period do not exist. As for the two films<br/>
I cited, they concern the life of Edo-period ronin. There are hardly any<br/>
historical sources that outline the lives of Edo period ronin. So therefore,<br/>
historians have usually had to read what little is available and draw<br/>
conclusions from little bits of information that they have found, here and<br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
One historical source I did find was in SOURCES OF JAPANESE TRADITION, which<br/>
is a compilation of historical sources in English translation. Included in<br/>
this book are some writings of Fumazawa Banzin, a ronin and scholar who<br/>
lived in the 17th century. He wrote about the conditions of people during<br/>
the Edo period and particularly discussed the conditions for the ronin, many<br/>
whom he said were starving to death. There are loads of other historical<br/>
documents in this book on various topics. <br/>
<br/>
Another source of historical writings is LEGENDS OF THE SAMURAI compiled by<br/>
Hiroaki Sato. He compiled English translations of many original documents,<br/>
including the 18th century scholarly debates that occurred concerning the 47<br/>
Ako ronin and their revenge.   <br/>
<br/>
As for using films and other historical fiction: You cannot draw definitive<br/>
conclusions from anything seen in a film or a piece of fiction. For the most<br/>
part, films and other fiction aren't designed to give out definitive<br/>
conclusions about history. What they do is "fill in the gaps" in many cases,<br/>
and they raise issues and possibilities. The films SEPPUKU and AFTER THE<br/>
RAIN are made by Japanese, in Japanese. I have to use sub-titled versions as<br/>
my understanding of Japanese is quite limited. <br/>
<br/>
So therefore as an example: in SEPPUKU, the author of the orignal novel, and<br/>
the director of the film, challenge the concept of "the sword is the soul of<br/>
the samurai" as a precept that has been frequently empty of any true<br/>
morality, as a hypocritical "hammer" used by those in positions of privilege<br/>
during the Edo period, over those who are powerless. In the novel and the<br/>
film, there is a depiction of an impoverished 17th century ronin forced by<br/>
the Ii clan to commit seppuku with his bamboo-blade wakizashi (because he<br/>
had pawned his real blade, replacing it with bamboo) after he came to their<br/>
mansion begging for money. So this does raise a question: did this sort of<br/>
event ever actually happen in historical times, or is this event purely from<br/>
the imagination of the author, echoed by the movie director? On an ethical<br/>
level, would this response by the Ii clan, be considered by those living in<br/>
the time, as an apropriate response? In modern times, would this be<br/>
considered an appropriate response? There are no proven answers, just<br/>
speculations. But they can be valuable to ponder, at least to some.<br/>
<br/>
Or we could dismiss this whole thing, stating that it's from a novel and a<br/>
film, and say that it's just fiction, unproven. And move on, using only<br/>
definitive historical documents in their original language for the study of<br/>
history. Which is fine as well. To each their own.<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have been absent from the list for at least a year, but have decided to<br/>
see what's what here (albeit from a new email address).<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to comment on the premise of Ms. Boal's questions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To which historical accounts are you referring?  Written when?  In Japanese<br/>
or English?  For a popular or academic audience?  Peer reviewed (as in<br/>
university and other scholarly presses)?<br/>
All of these (and many more) are the first questions one normally would ask<br/>
about sources quoted in support of any statement or hypothesis.  Without<br/>
some idea of the sources that you are using, a statement such as 'some<br/>
historical accounts I've read' has an indeterminate authority and leaves me<br/>
(and I suspect others) curious as to the accuracy that we can expect from<br/>
the sources.<br/>
<br/>
The next thing that I would point out is that these are just movies. <br/>
While I like Kurosawa and Tokugawa-set period pieces, I don't beleive anyone<br/>
would put much faith in their historical accuracy.  That is not to say that<br/>
the things that movies depict are necessarily untrue, but simply that they<br/>
can't be relied upon as historical documents in the same way that<br/>
contemporaneous materials can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819472932">Thank you for putting a bit of reason into this discussion. <br/>
<br/>
There is an old Aesop's Fable on the subject of historical documentation. It<br/>
goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
One day a man and a lion were walking together. They spotted a statue that<br/>
showed Hercules slaying a lion. The man said to the lion, "this statue shows<br/>
that humans are superior to lions because you see a man slaying a lion."<br/>
Whereupon the lion replied. "A human being made that statue. How different<br/>
the portrayal would have been if a lion had made that statue."<br/>
<br/>
In other words, historical documents are usually written by those who have<br/>
reason to write their particular viewpoint into history. They are not always<br/>
any more accurate than a maker of movies or a writer of fiction. Even a<br/>
document that is contemporary to the period being studied could be filled<br/>
with propaganda, agendizing, and half-truths in order to push a particular<br/>
point of view. Also, a scholarly, non-fiction work could be written by<br/>
someone with a ton of PHD letters behind their name and still be filled with<br/>
agendizing for whatever point of view the writer is advocating. <br/>
<br/>
If I were to view a film i.e. SEPPUKU or THE SEVEN SAMURAI or ZATOICHI or<br/>
whatever, and state without questioning or examining that "this is the<br/>
absolute truth; it all happened just as the film depicted," that would be<br/>
careless to say the least. But if I were to read a historical work, let's<br/>
say by Yamamoto Tsunetomo or else by a modern writer with tons of letters<br/>
behind his/her name, tons of degrees, etc. and state without questioning or<br/>
examining that "this is the absolute truth; it all happened just as the<br/>
writer depicted" then I would be equally careless.    <br/>
<br/>
What a person must do is examine MANY of the existing sources, in whatever<br/>
form that they exist. Then apply logic. Though being human beings, each with<br/>
our own viewpoints and agendas, we will end up applying logic in different<br/>
ways. That's what makes discussions such as those on this list interesting.<br/>

<br/>
I think that the main point of contention that I would have is that history<br/>
books all have the intended purpose of being correct whereas fiction's<br/>
purpose isn't to be correct, it is to entertain.  You are drawing a sharp<br/>
line here where a less sharp, more blurry line (so to speak) is needed. Or<br/>
perhaps I should say that in making this sharp distinction, you are using a<br/>
katana where a surgeon's scalpal would be more useful. <br/>
<br/>
Many history books are intended to push a particular agenda. I suppose that<br/>
one can say that the writer of a book that is labeled "history" usually<br/>
believes that their main point and their main agenda are both correct. <br/>
<br/>
How many times have you read history books that, for instance, state that<br/>
"the following IS the story of the 47 Ako ronin's revenge" and then read a<br/>
description that is full of suppositions, assumptions, unfounded facts.<br/>
Mainly because all of the details simply are not available. I don't know how<br/>
many contrasting and conflicting "historical" accounts of the revenge of the<br/>
47 ronin that I've read in who knows how many history books. Like fiction<br/>
writers, historical writers will "fill in the gaps" with suppositions when<br/>
the actual empirical evidence doesn't exist. So to say outright that each<br/>
and every history book is "to try and be correct" misses the point because<br/>
that is not the case with all of them. <br/>
<br/>
There really isn't any problem with historical writers doing some "filling<br/>
in" with suppositions and assumptions when actual sources aren't available.<br/>
If a writer is actually trying to write a correct account, then he/she will<br/>
tell us that the account that has been written is speculative. What is<br/>
probably the best way to tell us about a certain event is to present several<br/>
versions that could be deducted from what empirical facts are available and<br/>
then discuss which version makes the most sense to the writer. <br/>
<br/>
But in my experience, most history writers don't do this. Instead, they<br/>
present a single version of an event as THE FACTS. And thus there are about<br/>
50 or so "factual" versions (at least) in several "history" books of how the<br/>
dispute between Lord Asano and Lord Kira took place, what caused Lord Asano<br/>
to draw his sword, what happened afterward, how the 47 Ako retainers who<br/>
planned an attack on Kira actually accomplished this, what happened after<br/>
the attack, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
One of the other posters mentioned "peer review" as if somehow that makes<br/>
the historical work certified in some way as "accurate" and therefore not to<br/>
be questioned. Peers can be just as human, have just as many agendas of<br/>
their own to push as the author does. Even those peers with tons of letters<br/>
and degrees behind their name can have agendas. <br/>
<br/>
I hate to say it, but history isn't like computer programming or mathematics<br/>
(my fields of expertise) with clear-cut divisions between "true" and<br/>
"false." So we're going to have several different versions of "the facts"<br/>
and we're going to have to learn to use our own heads to read several<br/>
sources and decide for ourselves. We will each come up with different<br/>
conclusions and therefore, we can have lists like this one to exchange<br/>
ideas. <br/>
<br/>
So we get to film and other works clearly labeled as "fiction" and "novels."<br/>
To say that the purpose of ALL fiction writers is only to "entertain", that<br/>
also misses the point. <br/>
<br/>
Some films, mainly most anime or ZATOICHI or similar films were made mainly<br/>
to entertain. If I were to watch a Zatoichi film and then decide on the spot<br/>
that there truly existed a blind masseur named Zatoichi who became a master<br/>
swordsman, then I would truly be jumping the gun in this conclusion.<br/>
Unfortunately, too many people do this, watch a film, or read a book and<br/>
unquestioningly decide that it contains "the truth." So we occasionally<br/>
encounter someone on this list (or elsewhere) who want to know the "true"<br/>
history of Zatoichi. And we have to gently advise them on looking at other<br/>
sources that explain that Zatoichi was purely a fictional character. <br/>
<br/>
But some historical fiction, including some historical films, do attempt to<br/>
discuss history and cast a light on it. A lot of it is written purely to<br/>
entertain. But not always. Back to a film like SEPPUKU, I doubt that anyone<br/>
who has seen this film would say that they were "entertained" by it; being<br/>
entertained was not my own reaction. This film wasn't designed to entertain,<br/>
it was designed to present ideas, reflecting upon speculative history and<br/>
then attempting to apply it to contemporary times. <br/>
<br/>
Now to say after watching SEPPUKU that there definitively existed a samurai<br/>
named Tsugumo Hanshiro and that he avenged the death of his son-in-law<br/>
against the Ii clan -- that would be jumping the gun. But to use the events<br/>
presented in a film like this and question as to whether or not similar<br/>
events may or may not have happened. And then look for historical sources in<br/>
this questioning and draw conclusions. That isn't jumping the gun, that is<br/>
using a film as a jumping-off point to explore history.      <br/>
<br/>
Now to get on a level of my own experience. When I decided to write "Stray<br/>
Dogs," a fictional account of the life of one of the 47 Ako ronin, Fuwa<br/>
Kazuemon (anyone can read the story on the Samurai Archives web site), I<br/>
didn't write the story to "entertain." I also did NOT write the story to<br/>
state that this is THE FACTS about his life. I couldn't do that and I don't<br/>
know any historian, even those with multiple degrees in history who could.<br/>
Simply because so many gaps exist in his life. I wrote the story because I<br/>
am interested in this man's life and thus wanted to delve into it a bit<br/>
more. <br/>
<br/>
I've been a bit long-winded here and I apologize if I bored anyone. But it's<br/>
difficult to do that "surgeon's scalpal" thing and I don't always accomplish<br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Nina<br/>

Nowhere did I say that history books were 100% correct--the point is, their<br/>

spent trying to edit my posts to get to the point!  Thank you for<br/>
making it clearer.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I left out, and shouldn't have done, is that I was referring<br/>
to those of us on this particular forum would know the difference, not<br/>
every "stray cat" who wandered in having seen some anime.  <br/>
The main point that seems to have been lost in the flurry:  if a film,<br/>
however inaccurate, silly or simple it is, inspires someone to read up<br/>
on the subject and actually learn about it, then surely that is a good<br/>
thing?  It's what got me started 35 years ago and I've never stopped<br/>
reading and learning since.  I don't understand the references to<br/>
Hollywood blockbuster type films though - even I, in my condescending<br/>
and snotty manner, would never deign to imply that they were worthy of<br/>
inclusion in this discussion......I'm sorry if anyone finds me<br/>
condescending, and a little surprised, because to be honest, I've been<br/>
embarrassed at the bad tempered way some posters have been treated<br/>
when they ask a simple (and simplistic) question, or merely try to<br/>
drum up a bit of controversy just to get a discussion going.  To those<br/>
people I would show infinite patience, because I really, really want<br/>
more people to get into the subject that I've loved almost all of my<br/>
life.  It won't help them to continue learning about the subject if<br/>
their every mistake is howled at, and it certainly doesn't encourage<br/>
me to keep posting if, by not agreeing, I'm seen to be condescending.<br/>
 I think "cut out quotes" as favoured here are part of the problem,<br/>
they ignore a long and reasoned argument and make the one snippet<br/>
quoted sound like an unreasonable shriek.  Speaking of shrieking, I've<br/>
read several people on different forums howling with rage because<br/>
their preferred historical source was not the same as someone else's.<br/>
 How can they know which is right, and ultimately, does it matter?  In<br/>
my clumsy way, that was what I was trying to get at, being dogmatic<br/>
over a particular version of history to the extent of insulting others<br/>
who don't agree, or prefer an alternative source.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one has argued that it's not a good thing. However,<br/>
if that person then refuses to accept multiple<br/>
historically accurate arguements to hold on to the<br/>
"ninja can fly" belief that first inspires him/her,<br/>
then that IS a bad thing. Clavell's Shogun is what<br/>
started me, along with many others, down this path.<br/>
Because I like the work, I still read it about every<br/>
18 months or so. However, I've matured in my studying<br/>
to realize that 90% of his story is preposterous, and<br/>
though thinly based on the general political situation<br/>
circa 1600, none of the actual STORY itself is<br/>
anywhere near accurate, not are the details of<br/>
linguistics, dress, weaponry, etc. I can be inspired<br/>
by it all I want--that doesn't mean it is correct in<br/>
fact or detail, nor does it excuse me if I claim that<br/>
it is. Inspiration is good-dogmatic clinging to that<br/>
inspiration in the face of fact is bad. While you may<br/>
think this never happens, I assure you it does on<br/>
about a weekly basis. You don't see the posts I and<br/>
Kitsuno delete for sheer inanity. <br/>
<br/>
It won't help them to continue learning about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > the subject if<br/>
> their every mistake is howled at, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mistakes aren't howled at. Unwillingness to correct<br/>
them is. <br/>
<br/>
  Speaking<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > of shrieking, I've<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those people you mentioned are arguing over versions<br/>
of history, correct? In that case, I am in your<br/>
camp--you have to read them, compare them, compare<br/>
their sources, and make a reasoned decision, but can<br/>
you ever know which one is correct and which one<br/>
isn't? Perhaps--if you're Tony. Mortals like me,<br/>
probably not. <br/>
<br/>
However, that wasn't the issue I addressed. I<br/>
addressed the issue of historical works versus fiction<br/>
works. You can point out all the issues with various<br/>
historical works you wish, the simple fact is that<br/>
historical works, by definition, in a historical<br/>
context, have greater value FOR THE PURPOSE OF<br/>
SEARCHING OUT HISTORICAL FACTS, then fiction works do.<br/>
Anybody who's more inspired by Sansom's Volume I than<br/>
by Kurosawa's Rashomon has no heart--however, Rashomon<br/>
is a work of fiction--inspiration is the point, not<br/>
facts. Each accomplishes their goal admirably--and<br/>
confusing the two is where we run into issues. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147981616">Ooops, sorry!  <bows deep and low>  <g><br/>
<br/>
I agree that people who read Ruroni Kenshin or see a Zatoichi film and say<br/>
"this is THE TRUTH as it happened" need to be reminded that this is not<br/>
necessarily so. But also, saying that "Author X wrote this in his Japanese<br/>
history book" also does not make it necessarily the truth. <br/>
<br/>
It looks that we essentially agree. We need to examine all sources and then<br/>
use our logic to evaluate the likely worth of each source and then draw our<br/>
own conclusions. Then we can discuss them here on the forum.<br/>
<br/>
But also remember that many times a surgeon's scalpal frequently works<br/>
better than a single slice with a katana.  <br/>

However, that wasn't the issue I addressed. I addressed the issue of<br/>
historical works versus fiction works. You can point out all the issues with<br/>
various historical works you wish, the simple fact is that historical works,<br/>
by definition, in a historical context, have greater value FOR THE PURPOSE<br/>
OF SEARCHING OUT HISTORICAL FACTS, then fiction works do.<br/>
Anybody who's more inspired by Sansom's Volume I than by Kurosawa's Rashomon<br/>
has no heart--however, Rashomon is a work of fiction--inspiration is the<br/>
point, not facts. Each accomplishes their goal admirably--and confusing the<br/>
two is where we run into issues. <br/>

Not that you necessarily did this, but Onnagozen did.<br/>
You simply followed on with his/her post, so therefore<br/>
came across as doing the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
Onnagozen replied directly to me, but as we've said,<br/>
with a tangentially perpendicular point. If you reply<br/>
directly to me, I'm going to directly answer,<br/>
especially when addressed in an argumentative and<br/>
combative manner. I've got no problem if you or he/she<br/>
or anyone wants to argue the merits and foibles of<br/>
history books, in specific, or in general. I DO have a<br/>
problem when this is couched as a counterargument to<br/>
my statement, because it doesn't counter my statement<br/>
whatsoever. <br/>
<br/>
What we had was this: <br/>
<br/>
Nate: "Tangerines are not red." <br/>
<br/>
Dissenter: "Well, neither are all apples red! So how<br/>
do we really know which ones are red and which ones<br/>
aren't? Does it matter? What does it matter if your<br/>
apple is red and my tangerine is blue, as long as it<br/>
inspires me? And certain tangerines may be of such<br/>
hues of orange that they may be very very close to<br/>
red." <br/>
<br/>
Simple facts: not everyone can tell that tangerines<br/>
are not red. Many tangerines may be so orange they are<br/>
close to being red, but being red is not the point of<br/>
a tangerine. For purposes of this analogy, all apples<br/>
SHOULD be red--the fact that many are green or brown<br/>
is a warning to the partaker that they need to check<br/>
their apples before they eat them, but not grounds for<br/>
saying that a. all apples are bad, or b. all<br/>
tangerines are equally red with apples. <br/>

While B is a tangential logical step that may outgrow<br/>

my statement of Part A by stating Part B, makes no<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393573833">First, I'm not "attacking" any of your statements. I'm just questioning,<br/>
seeking clarification. And sometimes disasgreeing with them. That's not an<br/>
"attack."  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, a point of disagreement: Saying "but also" concerning Part B is NOT a<br/>
dividing line between the two statements, and wasn't intended to be.<br/>
Instead, I'm trying to say (perhaps not so clearly, though I'm trying) that<br/>
the line between fiction and history books is not ALWAYS so clear as far as<br/>
using them to study history. It looks like that it's in this one area where<br/>
we disagree.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The "But also" is a clear connector, and therefore also the dividing line<br/>
between two parts. You may be a math major, but I'm a language major. <br/>
<br/>
While B is a tangential logical step that may outgrow from Part A, I stopped<br/>
at Part A. And to then attack my statement of Part A by stating Part B,<br/>
makes no sense, and of course raises my hackles. B does not mean that A is<br/>
incorrect.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951733926">No, no--you're misunderstanding me. Onnagozen<br/>
specifically addressed me by name, in the post<br/>
replying to me which I summed up in the logical<br/>
syllogism below. When I said "how else ought I take<br/>
it?" I was referring to Onnagozen's post, not yours. <br/>
<br/>
You've been simply arguing a point--and not a bad one,<br/>
though we're on occaision coming at cross purposes. No<br/>
problem. However, Onnagozen attacks my point that<br/>
fiction is not the proper place to study your<br/>
historical facts by saying that history books aren't<br/>
all correct, so who cares? That a. makes no logical<br/>
sense, and b. was done in such a flippant,<br/>
overbearing, condescending manner (to have the gall to<br/>
suggest that I was saying fiction was a BAD thing is<br/>
simply unnerving) that yes, I take issue with it. <br/>
<br/>
The only argument I can see that he/she is trying to<br/>
make that makes sense would be: History books have<br/>
flaws, so they are worthless, so you might as well<br/>
learn your history from movies. <br/>
<br/>
That leaves us with everyone getting their origins of<br/>
WWII from "Pearl Harbor" and "Schindler's List".<br/>
Whether you liked or disliked or were inspired or<br/>
think they are great or bad for fostering historical<br/>
discussion, to say that this alone suffices and you<br/>
can get a grasp of history without trying to find<br/>
actual historical fact is plain mystifying to me. <br/>

The only argument I can see that he/she is trying to make that makes sense<br/>
would be: History books have flaws, so they are worthless, so you might as<br/>
well learn your history from movies. <br/>
<br/>
That leaves us with everyone getting their origins of WWII from "Pearl<br/>
Harbor" and "Schindler's List".<br/>
Whether you liked or disliked or were inspired or think they are great or<br/>
bad for fostering historical discussion, to say that this alone suffices and<br/>
you can get a grasp of history without trying to find actual historical fact<br/>
is plain mystifying to me. <br/>

*MAY* have thoughts A and B, and may have them<br/>

<br/>
It's 11 PM, I've got to catch a flight in the morning,<br/>
and honestly, I really don't care anymore. Your (the<br/>
two of you) arguments are interwoven--I can't argue<br/>
one without bringing out the other. However, I simply<br/>
don't care anymore. Fine--look everyone, Nate hates<br/>
fiction. Nate believes all history books, even<br/>
Turnbull's crappy Osprey copies, must be 100% correct.<br/>
That's how I've been characterized, and I'm not going<br/>
to fight it anymore. <br/>

Because you've been agreeing with his statements?<br/>
Backing up his misguided arguments?<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* <br/>
<br/>
It's 11 PM, I've got to catch a flight in the morning, and honestly, I<br/>
really don't care anymore. Your (the two of you) arguments are interwoven--I<br/>
can't argue one without bringing out the other. However, I simply don't care<br/>
anymore. Fine--look everyone, Nate hates fiction. Nate believes all history<br/>
books, even Turnbull's crappy Osprey copies, must be 100% correct.<br/>
That's how I've been characterized, and I'm not going to fight it anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Damn.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Academic paper links?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992523927">As the title states, I'm looking for links to online academic papers <br/>
published in the field of Japanese history. I've got to do some serious <br/>
research into what exactly IS out there before finalizing a choice to <br/>

  Of course if I could do a comparative analysis of parallels in armour <br/>

But however, fiction has inspired me to read and explore and even hear this arguments out. Because of the two sides here it makes history as a whole I guess that much more real. Hmm. In any event, I lived in Japan for almost 3yrs and tried to visit every musume and castle I could but didnt even know enough Nihongo to know that being a samurai was abolished. Isn't that something? Well most people here that have never been to Japan with out much historical studies get their based on historical facts from anime and various movies? Its what started me out. There is a saying i have read once and dont remember from where it came but it goes like this: To the novice all things seem posible; but to the expert not so much.<br/>

think). JSTOR keeps online PDFs of the entire contents of HUNDREDS of <br/>
journals, including Asian-related ones like Monumenta Nipponica and so <br/>
on. Universities usually subscribe to JSTOR, so you should be able to <br/>
access the files from your school account. One of the greatest <br/>
