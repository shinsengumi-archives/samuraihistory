<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From my home email address. I operate all my Yahoo groups from two addresses, <br/>
switching back from one to the other. <br/>
<br/>
For whatever it's worth, my own interests in both fiction and history, tend <br/>
toward individuals. I see history as made up of individuals facing certain <br/>
conditions and making individual choices. I tend to shy away from broad <br/>
generalizations based on sweeping tendencies based on large groups of people. <br/>
<br/>
When I wrote "Stray Dogs," it was about a single individual, Fuwa Kazuemon, <br/>
who happened to be a real person from history. I was not interested in broad, <br/>
sweeping sociological or political statements or conclusions about 18th century <br/>
Japanese society or politics. I didn't intend even to discuss whether or not <br/>
Lord Asano was "correct" or not in drawing his sword against Kira or in any <br/>
discussions as to whether the former Ako retainers should have waited to strike <br/>
(as they did) or if they should have all commited seppuku on the spot (as <br/>
some, including Yamamoto -- author of "Hagakure" -- had said). <br/>
<br/>
According to Fuwa Kazuemon, a man loyal to his former lord, Lord Asano can do <br/>
no wrong, so to HIM, it was obvious that Kira was the "bad guy" in all of <br/>
this. My story was clearly using Fuwa Kazuemon's own views of the world at the <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
And why choose Fuwa Kazuemon? Because I find that he had a remarkable <br/>
history. He was thrown out of the Ako clan by Lord Asano 5-6 years before the events <br/>
that led to Lord Asano's own death. According to the sources I read, he was <br/>
thus consigned to the life of a masterless ronin for these years, with the extra <br/>
stigma of having offended his former lord. So it was not likely that a <br/>
different lord would take him into a clan. So he faced the hardships that most ronin <br/>
faced, povery and living on the edge in marginal occupations to sustain <br/>
himself. <br/>
<br/>
But this was the life of quite a few people during that time. What made Fuwa <br/>
Kazuemon's life unique and worthy of note? It's because despite all of this, <br/>
he maintained his loyalty to the daimyo who had cast him out and consigned him <br/>
to exile and poverty. This is loyalty beyond what could be expected of a man <br/>
who had been banished from his clan. <br/>
<br/>
Even during the time right after Lord Asano's death and the iminent seizure <br/>
of the Ako castle, Kazuemon came to the castle to offer his support -- and was <br/>
repeatedly rebuffed by Oishi Kuranosuke (chief retainer of the Ako retainers, <br/>
who had taken on the duty of leadership of the Ako ex-retainers at the time). <br/>
Even then, he remained loyal. This is true and remarkable loyalty in the face <br/>
of such rejection. <br/>
<br/>
Fuwa Kazuemon persisted in spite of all and finally was re-admitted among the <br/>
Ako ex-retainers and was one of the 47 (some say it was 46) who took part in <br/>
the final attack against Kira, to avenge his lord's death. My sources indicate <br/>
that he killed more of Kira's retainers during the attack than any other of <br/>
the Ako men.  With the other Ako ronin, he committed seppuku in February after <br/>
the attack. <br/>
<br/>
Then the question can arise. Why write historical fiction? Why not just write <br/>
a non-fictional biography? Partly because I am a fiction writer; it suits my <br/>
style of wishing to concentrate on individual humans and get more "into their <br/>
minds."  There are too many gaps where available historical sources have <br/>
failed to record details of this man's life. So as a historical fiction writer, I <br/>
do research and come up with speculations that seem logical and appear "right" <br/>
to fill in these important details. <br/>
<br/>
Fuwa Kazuemon's life boggles my mind with his extraordinary loyalty. And thus <br/>
I am drawn to him as an individual and I wanted to study him. The actions of <br/>
individuals do impact other individuals and the ripple can go forth to affect <br/>
history in general. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, for those who might be interested. It appears that my 2006 entry <br/>
to the Samurai Archives Fiction Contest will be a further tale in the life of <br/>
Fuwa Kazuemon. <br/>

love for those around in the 12th century.  Although I know that I<br/>
have to view them within the context of their times and circumstances,<br/>
and although I know that their reactions will come from being immersed<br/>
in a culture and age totally different to mine, I can't help but try<br/>
and identify something within me that draws me to them.  I guess it's<br/>
human nature, to seek to find a small connection within that huge<br/>
historical background.  Whether it's a scruffy ronin, a peasant or a<br/>
shogun, whether we admire them or despise them, it seems that there is<br/>
something about them that singles them out for us.</div>
