<h3>IMPERIAL REGALIA</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-161521566">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about Nihonto in the context of Japanese culture and the Imperial<br/>
Family, can anybody comment on how the three Imperial regalia of beads, mirror<br/>
and sword came to be chosen and when??  What is the purpose and significance of<br/>
the sword in this role?<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

herre goes;<br/>
	The tama (rhymes with and looks like comma) was considered to <br/>
have magical powers by the early Japanese and may have been a symbol <br/>
of tribal leaders/kings before the invasions from the continent.<br/>
	The mirror represents Amamterasu Omokami the ultimate diety <br/>
in Shinto, also a very ancient symbol predating continental influence.<br/>
	The sword too would naturally have been a symbol of the <br/>
military might of prehistoric kings. It plays a role in the ancient <br/>
creation myths and in the story of the First Emperors who used it to <br/>
slay dragons and subdude unruly tribes...<br/>
	These became set in the earliest days of Yamato rule. I think <br/>
it absolutely natural that an "invading" authority would cloak <br/>
himself in the symbols and myths of the indigenous peoples he was <br/>
trying to gain sway over.<br/>

	You asked the question, so I thought I was on that "other" <br/>
list. Which is where G and others may have better answers for you...<br/>
