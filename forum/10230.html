<h3>Samurai Hairstyles</h3>
by <i>konohawolfie</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-316171423">Hi Sam Archives!<br/>
<br/>
This was something I meant to ask a long long time ago, but I luckily came across a sticky note that made me remember. What I'm trying to figure out is the distinctive hairstyles of samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, I read that samurai shave their hair in a "half moon style" when they reach a particular age or rank? This is also very noticed in Feudal Japan art.<br/>
<br/>
Is this the only hairstyle or are there others? I am also especially curious in youths hair (like teen samurai).<br/>
Also, why decide on shaving their head?<br/>
<br/>
If they have very short hair, can they keep it?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146562880">From what I know the shaving of the top of the head was not a real set in cultural norm for samurai until the Edo Period. There were some before, and it was starting to become popular in the late 16th century, however it was not the "set" hairstyle until later. There were a number of ways in which to fashion the top knot. From descriptions the most popular in the pre-Edo period was the "tea whisk" which was named that because that is what it looked like. I have a picture of a portrait that a friend sent me of Oda Nobunaga. It was done by an Italian Jesuit who was commissioned by Nobunaga to do a realistic picture of him, which was something that Japanese art was lacking. While we of course cannot say for sure that it is 100% accurate, it is safe to say, since it was done under Nobunaga's orders and probably his approval, that it is more than likely the closest that we will have of an accurate picture of him. The portrait shows him with his typical mustache, and even though he is wearing a top knot, the top of his head is not shaved. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072234461">That is an interesting piece of info. Thank you Scott. I'm starting to get curious about references. I think I read somewhere that a majority of the daimyo art (or just Japanese) was from 17th or 18th century artists.<br/>
 <br/>
What about those with shorter hair?<br/>
 <br/>
Also, hairstyles of youths?<br/>
 <br/>
What was the hairstyle before late 16th century/Edo peroid?<br/>
 <br/>
Was it illegal to have men wear their hair long? <br/>
