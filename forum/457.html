<br/>
The samurai were well aware of the The Art of War from well before the <br/>
Sengoku era.  Though the exact entry date into Japan is unclear, the work <br/>
attributed to Sun-Tzu (as well as the other 6 Chinese Military texts from <br/>
ancient China) were extant in Japan at least by the 12th century.  Of <br/>
course, these texts came to Japan in their original classical Chinese form, <br/>
which was unreadable to most.  Only those people with "classical" education <br/>
would have had any chance to read them.  Before the Tokugawa era it was only <br/>
the select few, (e.g. - Imagawa Ryoshun, Kusunoki Masashige) who were <br/>
erudite enough warriors to have a chance to have read them for themselves.  <br/>
These men were generals -- great leaders of men -- and in that sense a bit <br/>
closer to the courtiers in terms of education.  As for the more "common" <br/>
fighting men, though they may have learned of the strategic principles <br/>
inculcated in Sun-Tzu and the like, there was almost no possibility for them <br/>
to have read them individually.<br/>
<br/>
I heard recently, though, that by the 15th century there existed a sort of <br/>
"cheat book" (Japanese name escapes me) -- similar to the books we have <br/>
nowadays of useful quotations -- that had commonly quoted sayings from <br/>
Chinese classics (Military, Confucian and otherwise) as well as works of <br/>
Japanese "high" literature.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that in his book _The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China_, <br/>
Ralph Sawyer mentions that there is info in Samuel Griffith's translation of <br/>
the Sun-Tzu about its dissemination into Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
