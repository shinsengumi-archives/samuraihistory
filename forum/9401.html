<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420092867">hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
can anybody please help me on my info gathering about Uesugi Kenshin<br/>
and Takeda Shingen. their most trusted generals and their battles (<br/>
kawanakajima ) and everything else about them. i am composing my own<br/>
story ( fictional but the timeline is during Kenshin and Shingen's<br/>
rise ) i am kinda having trouble trying to find the right material and<br/>
book's   are kinda hard to get for my stature. so i rely more on the<br/>
net. if you can help with accurate info or other links that i can<br/>
search and study, i'd be greatly thankful...<br/>
<br/>
thanks and god speed!<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] needing more info...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466013409">The best source for information regarding the Takeda side would probably be the Koya Gunkan which has not been translated into English in its entirety. It is a Takeda-written work, so be wary of that if you take that route.<br/>
<br/>
If you want English sources, then the easiest thing to do would be to get the Osprey books on each individual battle (Kawanakajima 1553-64, for example), or the two volume set dedicated to samurai warlords. They are inexpensive and easy to read. Not only that but they are highly concentrated with information, maps, illustrations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are also other sources if you are interested in digging. There are scattered passages about Kenshin and Shingen in works relating to Nobunaga, such as the piece in Japan Before Tokugawa and, of course, Japonius Tyrannus. Sansom's A History of Japan 1334-1615 may also be of use.<br/>
<br/>
Those are just some ideas...<br/>
