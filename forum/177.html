| Book announcement and TOC: Akira Hayami, The Historical Demography of<br/>
| pre-modern Japan, University of Tokyo Press, 2001, 191 p.<br/>
|<br/>
| In this volume, Akira Hayami, one of the pioneers of historical demography<br/>
| in Japan, reports on the findings of researchers who are working with rich<br/>
| sources of data. He explains the importance of their conclusions not only<br/>
| for historical studies but also for the understanding the demography of<br/>
| contemporary Japan and its foreseeable future.<br/>
|<br/>
| Beginning in 1638, under orders from the central government, town and<br/>
| village officials in Tokugawa Japan collected data annually on their<br/>
| residents. Although the government original purpose was to ferret out<br/>
| adherents to the forbidden religion of Christianity, the information<br/>
| collected in the census books known as SAC (Shumon Aratame Cho) has<br/>
enabled<br/>
| researchers to trace the life histories of individuals and familes for<br/>
| several generations, looking at their migration and employment patterns,<br/>
| family size  and composition, education, and other aspects of community<br/>
and<br/>
| family life.<br/>
|<br/>
| Contents:<br/>
| Chapter 1  Introduction to historical demography: history and population<br/>
| Chapter 2  The establishment and development of historical demography<br/>
| Chapter 3  Population trends based on macro-data<br/>
| Chapter 4  A demographic overview of early modern Japan based on<br/>
| micro-data: population, family reconstitution, and households in Suwa gun,<br/>
| Shinano province<br/>
| Chapter 5  Demographic aspects of Tokugawa Japan based on micro-data:<br/>
| Nishijo mura, Ampachi gun, Mino province<br/>
| Chapter 6  Historical demography and family history: a conclusion<br/>
