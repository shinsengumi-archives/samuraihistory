<h3>Nojiri Family ??</h3>
by <i>steven_matsheshu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779054075">Does anyone know info about the Nojiri Familiy? <br/>
<br/>
  I have found lineages that appear in both Western Honshu <br/>
(Hiroshima) and Northern Honshu/Hokkaido.<br/>
<br/>
      I am looking for any info on the family's history.<br/>
<br/>
 The particular branch I am interested in is the branch which merged <br/>
with the Ono Family...and some of their descendents reside(d) in <br/>
Sapporo.<br/>
<br/>
         Any info would be helpful. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
   p.s.<br/>
    When Nojiri and Ono came together, I am pretty sure that the Ono <br/>
was a male and the Nojiri a female, but that for some reason (why?) <br/>
the name of the family was Nojiri (and not Ono..he took her name).<br/>
            Any info ?</div>

	Have no real genealogical info for you except to say that it was not  <br/>
uncommon for families without a male heir to adopt an adult male as  <br/>
their next head of the household and seal the deal by giving him one  <br/>
of their daughters...<br/>
	Many a line of craftsman and artists were carried on in this manner  <br/>
for generations.<br/>
