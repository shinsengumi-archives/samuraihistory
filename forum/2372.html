<div id="ygrps-yiv-970266004">I believe Dr Turnbull has done a valiant effort  in bringing samurai studies <br/>
before the public------and academics like me------who  are far from familiar <br/>
with the Japanese tongue.  However,  two points bothered me from his work.  In <br/>
his Battles of the Samurai,  he stated that the raid on the army of Takeda <br/>
Katsuyori was staged by Oda Nobunaga the night before the battle of Nagashino in <br/>
1575.  However,  in his The Samurai  Sourcebook he went with the other authors <br/>
and stated it  took place in the morning of the battle.  This was a critical <br/>
raid---since it relieved the castle that Takeda was besieging, and also <br/>
crippled the Takeda clan forces still back at the castle.  To misstate this would be <br/>
akin to saying that JEB Stuart's cavalry raid did not affect General Lee's <br/>
Confederate army at Gettysburg in the American Civil War in 1863.  Furthermore,  <br/>
in his Sourcebook,  Turnbull shows an elaborate painting of a Japanese castle <br/>
siege, complete with European siege engines, which he says is based on the <br/>
research he is doing in the Tower Armories in London. I have not had access to <br/>
those records---however,  in the research I have done in Japanese pictorial <br/>
sources (again I admit to no language facility!)  I have not yet seen depiction's <br/>
in the Japanese pictures that show anything similar to what Turnbull <br/>
portrays.  Any comments?  Prof John Murphy,  The Japan Foundation<br/>
