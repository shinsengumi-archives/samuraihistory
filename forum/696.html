<h3>Samurai&#39;s and ninja&#39;s - the link?</h3>
by <i>Ben Hertschap</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081083525">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
My name 's Ben and I'm from Belgium.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question concerning the link between samurai's and ninja's.<br/>
<br/>
When I look at the web about this I generally get 2 different statements:<br/>
<br/>
1) Ninja's didn't really exist, their are just a mysterious entity created<br/>
in Japanese (ancient) culture.<br/>
2) Ninja's are just like samurai's - exept that the ninja works when the<br/>
shogun can't doe something the legal way.<br/>
3) none of the above but - ...... (your story)<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know a thing about it; so I'm asking you to please clear this<br/>
up for me.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ben</div>

 Ninja had really existed ,but some descriptions in mangas and movies <br/>
are a little exaggerated.<br/>
Ninja was often called Shinobi (same kanji character is used in "nin" <br/>
of "ninja" and "shinobi",meaning "hide" or so. Many daimyo warlords <br/>
in Sengoku era had ninja corps.<br/>
Generally, their social status was much lower than samurai.But among <br/>
them,like Hattori Hanzou ,the most famous ninja who was the head of <br/>
Iga ninja corps, some ninjas were regarded as samurai.He was one of <br/>
the most important men of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the 1st Tokugawa shogun.<br/>
<br/>
 Ninja worked mainly as a spy and an assassin.Some say Takeda Shingen <br/>
and Uesugi Kensin,known as the warlords who used ninja effectively, <br/>
were killed by ninja.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682514281">In addition to this insightful reply, I'd like to add what I know of the <br/>
Ninja origin.   From what I have read, Ninja began as militant <br/>
monks or warrior monks, who were pretty much hated by most of <br/>
the Samurai.  In fact, it is said that Nobunaga had many battles <br/>
with these types of monks.  Because of their zeal, militant <br/>
prowess, and great numbers; many of those in power regaurded <br/>
them as a serious threat.  Out of persecution and thus the need <br/>
to be  less obvious, the Ninja developed techniques which were <br/>
akin to today's stealth technology.  They were later hired into <br/>
service to use these skills for the purposes of the Samurai.  <br/>
They seemed to be a necessary evil.  I say evil because the way <br/>
of the Ninja fully contradicts Bushido.  It is a system without <br/>
honor.  And many Samurai were defenseless, afraid, and <br/>
disgusted by Ninja tactics.  The Samurai seek glory through one <br/>
on one victories over great opponents in open combat.  While a <br/>
Ninja would sneak into one's home under the blanket of night to <br/>
namelessly slaughter whoever he was hired to kill.  They were <br/>
also spies as before mentioned by sineism.  <br/>
The only simalarity between Ninja and Samurai are that they <br/>
were sometimes both under conscription of a lord.  Samurai are <br/>
more often regaurded as retainers but Ninja would sometimes <br/>
also be retainers instead of the more common mercenary Ninja.  <br/>
Great Diamyos and Shoguns are usually rumored to have used <br/>
Ninja.  This was not normally  public knowledge until the <br/>
Tokugawa government was well in place.  This is because it <br/>
was shameful for a great lord to stoop to such tactics in a world <br/>
dominated by Samurai with thier unique code of ethics.  Most <br/>
would openly deny use of Ninja, but it seemed to be a common <br/>
practice.  Ninja if caught by the enemy were certain to recieve the <br/>
most heinous death that his captors could imagine.  They were <br/>
most often regaurded by the Samurai as despiccable and <br/>
disgusting.<br/>
From my experience with Japanese jidai (period) films, one <br/>
theory is that some Samurai were also Ninja(being of a Samurai <br/>
family but having the special mission of  being Ninja) .  <br/>
One thing I am absolutely certain of is that Ninja did exist.  It <br/>
would preposterous to suggest that such a well documented <br/>
class of warrior did not exist.  Ninja films have  been in <br/>
Japanese cinema since the 1920's.  If you go to any of the <br/>
weapon's or antique dealers in Japan you are likely to find an <br/>
authentic Ninja jacket.  There are countless other examples as <br/>
proof of thier existence.  The origin however is suspect ; clouded <br/>
by mystery and superstition.  Hard facts are sometimes difficult <br/>
to find.<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-112971901">Hi Ben,<br/>
 Regarding your post...Ninja most certainly DID exist in Japan and the <br/>
evidence that supports this begins to pick up around the time that the <br/>
Sengoku Jidai really started in Japan. The classic idea of Ninja however was <br/>
a recent image that was most commonly used in the Kabuki plays of Tokugawa <br/>
Japan from around 1700 onwards..Ninja were called by many various names, some <br/>
of those including; Kusa (Meaning 'grass' ...was used by the Hojo clan to <br/>
describe the men), Iga no Mono meaning 'Men of Iga province' was a general <br/>
term for the warriors from Iga that could perform Ninja activities, Shinobi <br/>
meant those using the Ninjutsu techniques either in infiltration or spying <br/>
activities or in battle. Indeed there are many terms for those men/women used <br/>
as Ninja by the warlords...Further 'proof' if you need it is the existence of <br/>
'Ninjutsu' techniques still contained in the syllabus of the oldest Japanese <br/>
Martial art school the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu which took form in <br/>
the 14th century and still contains the espionage teachings in its <br/>
curriculum...And then there are the teachings used in Ryuha like the Bujinkan <br/>
and Genbukan Ninpo Bugei that are said to be far older than the 1600's in <br/>
their history...<br/>
 There is NO doubt that men using 'Ninjutsu' were used in Japan..The <br/>
histories written at the time contain mention of them also. The only real <br/>
'debate' here is whether to accept the modern idea of Ninja as the black clad <br/>
super magician killer spies..This is however a very recent role given the <br/>
Ninja to promote better audience attendance at Theatres in Japan and this <br/>
translated well into modern film and television...Ninja are described as <br/>
Samurai in the war tales..They wear the clothing that would help them to <br/>
blend in and not be noticed by their enemy..They are often described as <br/>
expert guides to the forests they lived in and are used as such by warlords <br/>
in the tales..They possess knowledge of infiltration tactics and battle <br/>
tactics that were required to win the battles or sieges they helped <br/>
with..However they are most often called Samurai and I believe that it is <br/>
most likely that a majority of them were men of great prestige in their own <br/>
communities...leaders of men that commanded a force large enough to be a <br/>
great help to those they supported.<br/>
 Even the books written by these so-called 'Ninja' are dated as being from <br/>
the 17th century and at that time the term Ninja was in use by the authors of <br/>
such books as the 'Bansenshukai', and 'Ninpiden' for example, This proves <br/>
beyond a reasonable doubt that there WERE those who accepted the name and <br/>
title of Ninja.<br/>
 Hope this helps to clear you on a few points..<br/>
 websites to visit on this are; www.genbukan.com, www.ninjutsu.com, <br/>
www.e-budo.com, or the best one at www.ninpo.org<br/>
 Have fun.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-36570546">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I think we all know that the ninja in one form or<br/>
another did exist.<br/>
<br/>
In fact there are several documents that have survived<br/>
from various Ninja Ryu-ha. Momochi Sandayu regarded as<br/>
onther of the most famous Ninja has left us with<br/>
plenty of evidence of his existance. In fact one of<br/>
this houses was until at least the late 70's still<br/>
inhabited by his descendants. It was also earlier in<br/>
the 20th century that a family member sold the<br/>
families collection of documents.<br/>
<br/>
With regards to Ninja documentation there are three<br/>
very famous books. <br/>
<br/>
SHONIKI- Correct Ninjutsu memories<br/>
<br/>
In 1681, a book entitled Shoniki, was written by<br/>
Fujibayashi Masatake (also known as Notari Sanjuro<br/>
Fujibayashi). He was also a Samurai from Kishu. It is<br/>
also possible that these two authors Fujibayashi<br/>
Masatake, and Fujibayashi Nagato (Bansenshukai) may<br/>
have been related.  It contains the secret teachings<br/>
of the Kishu Ryu.<br/>
<br/>
BANSENSHUKAI - 10,000 rivers gather in the sea<br/>
<br/>
The Bansenshukai (10,000 rivers gather in the sea) <br/>
was written in 1676 by Fujibayashi Yasutake a Samurai<br/>
from Iga Ueno castle. As the name is the same, as the<br/>
famous Fujibayashi Iga Ninja family, and it is one of<br/>
the most intensive books on the secret teachings and<br/>
tools written solely on the 49 Iga Ninja Ryu. It is<br/>
possible that the author was a relative of the<br/>
Fujibayashi Ninja family, if not one himself. But as<br/>
with all history this is only speculation.<br/>
<br/>
NINPIDEN - Secret teachings of Ninjutsu<br/>
In 1653 Ninpiden was written by Hattori Hanzo<br/>
Yasukiyo. It is believed to contain the teachings of<br/>
Hattori Hanzo, the Ninja chief of Shogun Tokugawa<br/>
Ieyasu.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm not an expert in samurai scouts. I've only studied<br/>
what has been written by others on how they employed<br/>
them. But I DO know scouting. I served as a tank<br/>
platoon leader in a division cavalry squadron, and<br/>
worked extensively with cavalry scouts. I'm now an<br/>
intelligence officer and my job is to gather<br/>
information about the enemy, using scouts to do so.<br/>
Yeah, radios, UAV's, etc are great, but the principles<br/>
of recon don't change. You'd have strategic and<br/>
operational recon (otherwise known as spies) and have<br/>
an idea of what the opposing force had. Katsuyori had<br/>
to know the available forces that Nobunaga and ieyasu<br/>
had, and would make a guess as to how many of them<br/>
he'd have to face. <br/>
<br/>
Next you'd have tactical scouts, what we think of as<br/>
scouts. If I was surrounding an enemy emplacement,<br/>
you'd be darn skippy that I would not only focus on<br/>
that. I'd have scouts out in all directions, waiting<br/>
to report on that reliving force I KNOW would probably<br/>
be coming. You wouldn't have to count to 38,000,<br/>
especially not with a Sengoku army. Look at the<br/>
banners....yeah, that's hashiba's banner, and he has<br/>
8,000 men under him...I know that from my strategic<br/>
recon. Okay, that's Sakakibara, and he has 1000. The<br/>
banners made it easy, because not only could you get<br/>
an idea of unit size, you knew who was in command.<br/>
Nowadays I have to count vehicles, and maybe I'll get<br/>
lucky and identify a certain type  of vehicle that is<br/>
only in at a certain echelon, and I can determine the<br/>
size. <br/>
<br/>
so in a battle such as Nagashino, at what<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > point does one realize<br/>
> they are outnumbered? (not only that, but by the<br/>
> time you are close enough<br/>
> to count, you have to contend with bullets and<br/>
> arrows.)<br/>
> <br/>
> c.w.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you're not. You've seen Kagemusha, I assume.<br/>
Remember the scouts from Ieyasu and Nobunaga? The<br/>
dingy little peasant spies and the monk? There you<br/>
go...there is your HUMINT. They observe and report<br/>
back...behind them, you have actual scouts, maybe your<br/>
tsukai-ban or another group, mounted for speed...it's<br/>
amazing how easy it is to sneak up on someone, even<br/>
mounted...and get away unnoticed. If I can do it in a<br/>
bradley fighting vehicle, he can do it on a horse. <br/>
<br/>
My point is this: Takeda Katusyori had to know full<br/>
well how many men Nobunaga and Ieyasu had. He would<br/>
have had an idea of the composition, ie weapons and<br/>
the like. He would have known this all before 0500 on<br/>
the 28th of June when he launched his charge. He could<br/>
have retreated the night of the 27th. And he should<br/>
have, in my opinion. Yes, it's hindsight, but speaking<br/>
as a military officer, you simply don't attack 38,000<br/>
men when you have 15,000. Not unless they have spears<br/>
and you have tanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I agree sorry to be pessimistic but I find winning this battle is <br/>
almost impossible.  Perhaps if Takeda Shingen was still around and <br/>
hadn't carelessly been shot by a lowly arquebussier (I think)Maybe <br/>
the battle could have been won, One of his famous quotes is "A man <br/>
with deep far-sightedness will survey both the beginning and the end <br/>
of a situation and continually consider its every facet as important."<br/>
If Katsuyori had taken his fathers advice he would not have charged <br/>
into the valley of death so to speak. Although he showed great <br/>
samurai spirit and followed the code of (Bushido) I.e to advance and <br/>
die in battle.  He really was fated I am afraid to lose.  Perhaps if <br/>
he had taken the castle at Nagashino earlier defeated Okudaira <br/>
Sadamasa and then spent time fortifying it and courting alliances <br/>
with other Daimyo then he may have held ground, but in the end the <br/>
superior Oda-Tokugawa army would have won out.  Also the battle could <br/>
have been won if alot of what-if's happened, for example if the <br/>
messenger Torii Suneemon hadn't warned Ieyasu and Nobunaga the battle <br/>
would have been over and the Takeda could have perhaps swept onto the <br/>
kanto plain (I doubt but maybe) If accounts of the battle are true <br/>
then Katsuyori was in a difficult position he had a classic problem <br/>
facing any general How to use cavalry as defensive troops? in my <br/>
opinion he had no option but to become the attacker as he was <br/>
outnumbered out gunned, perhaps out planned? (Sorry all you Takeda <br/>
Loyalists) The use of arquebussiers behind screens with pike men and <br/>
spear men was I think innovative on a scale never seen before, (I <br/>
haven't found out who masterminded this scheme it seems like a <br/>
Nobunaga scheme, opinions?) Therefore in conclusion Katsuyori could <br/>
not have won the battle unless a number of what if's had occured and <br/>
he had taken the castle.  He was undoubtebly a brave soul but all to <br/>
often in the history of the Bushi it seems that tragic heroes have a <br/>
place to play, they are there to be swept aside by the great warriors <br/>
who become myths then legends and eventually get to take the prize of <br/>
being remembered as they say history is not written by the losers, (I <br/>
wonder what Katsuyori would say if he was around, do we really have <br/>
any right to judge him, Poor Katsuyori)<br/>

<h3>Nagashino/ new samurai book, was Re: Question to you all...</h3>
by <i>robbroomuk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-335322940">Nate,<br/>
<br/>
you are right, but as we know from history, many commanders did not <br/>
listen to their advisers,<br/>
<br/>
Did you get any luck with your search for Nagashino information?<br/>
<br/>
I have just got a book called Samurai by Mitsuo Kure, in hard back <br/>
with a lot of colour pictures of Samurai reenactors and text. <br/>
(similiar to his earlier Europa special.<br/>
In the UK it cost 30 pounds, which is I guess 43 US dollars.<br/>
<br/>
There is some text on the battle, including the following. (para <br/>
phrasing)<br/>
<br/>
Charged because enemy army threatened his rear.<br/>
Because Katsuyori was a young man and over confident in his army.<br/>
All Takeda Nija scouts had been killed before reporting depth of <br/>
enemy position.<br/>
Rainy season obscured view.<br/>
Most interesting he refers to documentation that says there were only <br/>
1500 gunners and not 3000, and possibly only 1000. so gunnery was NOT <br/>
decisive.<br/>
He discusses topography and excavations at the site as well as style <br/>
of warfare at the time.<br/>
After the first cavalry charge, its likely the samurai would have <br/>
dismounted and fought in the style traditional with the times, on <br/>
foot, supported by retainers. (this was done to avoid guns)<br/>
After all they now knew the problems in crossing the battle field on <br/>
horseback from the first failed charge.<br/>
<br/>
If you need more info, let me know. I actually have the book with me <br/>
here at work.<br/>
Good excuse to start reading it, it was only published last week I <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
<br/>

by <i>robbroomuk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056453251">OK, just checked out the pages.<br/>
it says recent study has revealed that the actual figure was 1500, <br/>
and the original document states there were 1000 <fujimoto masayuki> <br/>
and there is proof that some one changed it to 3000 later.<br/>
<br/>
There is no further detail about this in this section.<br/>
<br/>
I have not started reading the book yet to see what other differences <br/>
on Samurai history there are!<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of translations, I have a book in a slip case, in <br/>
Japanese. Published in 1969 First edition.<br/>
<br/>
The title is Sengoku bushi jiten by Sasama Yoshihiko (translated by a <br/>
Japanese friend here at work).<br/>
<br/>
My question, does anyone know if an English Language translation of <br/>
this book exists?<br/>
If so can you provide some details for me.<br/>
<br/>
If not any detail on the book and if it is worth me getting it <br/>
translated. (Note looking at the book, and illustrations, I think the <br/>
answer is yes, I also assume it might be valuable.)<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Question to you all...</h3>
by <i>Lee Changsub</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-87281626">I think that there is a great conceptual fallacy of<br/>
combining statsitical facts and tactical decisions<br/>
that affects both military practitioners and theorists<br/>
or historians.<br/>
 Yes, it is important to obtain a good measure of<br/>
comparison on the size of troops. But, I would say<br/>
that the decision of whether or not taking offensive<br/>
or withdraw must be "independent of" information on<br/>
the troop size obtained through recon.<br/>
 <br/>
The troop size is only one of factors that the field<br/>
marshall has to consider for her or his tactical<br/>
decision. But, it is not the only factor that will<br/>
determine the success or the failure of any type of<br/>
tactical decisions that would be made by the field<br/>
marshall.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, historically or statistically, in most of<br/>
battles, the larger sized troop have been quoted as<br/>
winners over the smaller sized troops. But,also in<br/>
many of famous battles directed by those 'famous'<br/>
generals, you would find that they often had to fight<br/>
against the more powerful or larger sized enemy<br/>
troops. I think that this is where we can distinguish<br/>
between competent and incompetent field marshalls.<br/>
Remember Nopoleon Bonaparte's 1805 Ulm-Austerlitz<br/>
campaign. Also Judah King Abijah's war againt Israel<br/>
King Jeroboam. (You will find plenty of such<br/>
references if you try.)<br/>
<br/>
In general, I would say that the field marshall must<br/>
try to avoid facing and fighting the larger sized<br/>
enemy if possible because of there is more odds for<br/>
defeat. But, if his or her tactical decision<br/>
forces(you will need more interpretation for this<br/>
word) him or her to take offensive or defensive, then<br/>
he or she would need to excercise his or her ingenuity<br/>
with all efforts. That is why we train generals and<br/>
officers at the academy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely NOT independent. All information is<br/>
integrated together and factors into a commanders<br/>
tactical decisions. Being outnumbered by a few, and<br/>
knowing you have better quality troops, and maybe<br/>
determining how to use surprise, mass, and economy of<br/>
force can mitigate these factors. Nobunaga did the<br/>
last three at Okehazama, in what I consider one of the<br/>
most brilliant battles fought by any commander<br/>
anywhere. However, Katsuyori didn't think it all<br/>
through. He was outnumbered by more than 2 to 1, not<br/>
by a few; granted his troops were probably more<br/>
disciplined and better trained, especially the<br/>
cavalry; however, and most crucially, he failed to do<br/>
ANYTHING other than what Nobunaga expected him to do.<br/>
Did he try to maneuver to get in Nobunaga's rear and<br/>
reduce him piecemeal, negating Nobunaga's force size?<br/>
No. He let Nobunaga make his preparations, and then<br/>
charged first thing in the morning right into the<br/>
defense Nobunaga had laid out. I will grant that<br/>
without the defensive preparations (and the river, and<br/>
the muddy ground...) it would have been much more<br/>
even, and as it was the idea that the gunfire<br/>
"slaughtered" the Takeda is a fallacy. But the point<br/>
is he did NONE of this. Those good commanders you<br/>
mention would not have done the expected, charge<br/>
straight up the middle at waiting arqubusiers. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never said it was. The North Koreans have many more<br/>
men under arms than the South Koreans, yet I fully<br/>
believe the South Koreans would run over them<br/>
(provided NK artillery was negated first).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and many times those generals weren't exactly<br/>
given the choice, and maneuvered themselves into<br/>
success. As I said, Katsuyori did not.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly what I am saying. Is it possible that<br/>
this could have turned out different? Yes, of course.<br/>
The prudent course would have been to retreat and<br/>
fight when the odds were better. Katsuyori had this<br/>
option. If forced to fight, could he have done better?<br/>
Without a doubt, yes. But then again, all of this is<br/>
in hindsight. My original point in my original post<br/>
was that given the information he should have had (and<br/>
if he didn't, he sure did not follow Sun Tzu's<br/>
precepts of using scouts and spies) he should not have<br/>
made the decision to fight. If he did decide to fight,<br/>
he should have done something, anything else. Rush the<br/>
castle and take it, then defend from inside. Determine<br/>
where Nobunaga was and attack before he could prepare,<br/>
or maneuver around and hit him from another side.<br/>
Anything. I wouldn't take my tanks on a frontal<br/>
assault of fortified positions with AT missiles and<br/>
artillery. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731082083">My point was simply if somebody esle had been in<br/>
Katsuyori place, how he would have done better.<br/>
As for my use of word, 'independence', I meant<br/>
basically the same point you made as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > All information is<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As you say, all information must be 'Integrated<br/>
Together'. I want to emphasized that information on<br/>
enemy troop size should not be 'disproportionally'<br/>
taken too serisouly for a tactical decision. This was<br/>
what I meant by being 'Indepedent'. The use of<br/>
suprise, mass, and etc would be some of options<br/>
available to a field commander. <br/>
<br/>
Katsuyori was lack of all these qualities. But, we may<br/>
analyze his situation and can get some lessons from<br/>
his defeat.<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I am not a trained military historian. I<br/>
have background in political science, statistics, and<br/>
mathematics. I liked reading a lot of books on ancient<br/>
Chinese stategies and military history (both eastern<br/>
and western). Now, I am working on a Ph.D. in<br/>
mathematics. I intend to work on something<br/>
interdisciplinary in the future. Anyway, it was good<br/>
to hear from you. <br/>
<br/>
ps. My father was also a Lietenant Colonel in the<br/>
South Korea Army. So, I have very friendly sentiment<br/>
toward the military figures.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I've always been impressed with the ROK Army.<br/>
Expecially after being stationed in Korea, near<br/>
Munsan, myself. All I've seen from the South Korean<br/>
Army, and I'm sure your father was the same, has been<br/>
outstanding!!!<br/>
