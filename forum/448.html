<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518148974">I have heard that only samuri had the right to weild swords...But I have seen numerous examples of Kenshi (swordsman) who are not samurai but still fight & know the sword arts... So were there really kenshi or were the samurai the only ones allowed to wield swords?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456343437">Hello,<br/>
 The 'basic' answer to the question here is that the Samurai WERE the only <br/>
ones allowed to hold the 'Daisho' (two swords)..with the exception of members <br/>
of the Doshin police, and other people associated with the court allowed to <br/>
wear one sword.<br/>
 However I think that the reason you seem confused on this point is that <br/>
these edicts really only were enforced throughout the Tokugawa <br/>
period..starting roughly at the time of Hideyoshi's great 'Sword Hunt' at the <br/>
end of the 16th century.<br/>
 Before the Edo period many 'Kenshi' were trained in Kenjutsu and many became <br/>
famous..despite their 'non-Samurai' status. During the Edo period it was <br/>
still possible to be trained in these systems as the authorities clamp down <br/>
was not 100% successfull and could not be enforced. <br/>
 I am not too sure about this but I believe that it was only the Daisho set <br/>
up that was the sole right of Samurai..Peasants may have been 'allowed' one <br/>
sword (usually the Wakizashi) if their public duties required it of them.<br/>
 Yagyu Shingan Ryu Heijutsu was a system that taught to many various classes <br/>
of people and the ryu has slightly different techniques depending on the <br/>
'needs' of the trainee...i.e Higher class members such as Daimyo or high <br/>
retainers were taught techniques both with the Katana and also the Muto-dori <br/>
that would have to be used in the presence of ones senior if attacked..Lower <br/>
classed trainees were taught techniques that could be used by them in <br/>
circumstances they could be caught up in.<br/>
 The term used by the school for this is 'Bushi yawara' or Warriors Jujutsu <br/>
to seperate it out from, say, Suhada Jujutsu (or Jujutsu in 'everyday' clothi<br/>
ng)<br/>
 Since the sword was also taught in the Yagyu Shingan ryu it can be assumed <br/>
that there were similarities there with the Jujutsu...<br/>
 So basically wether the person was allowed to wear the swords depended more <br/>
on the time he is shown in and the position he occupies..Tokugawa society was <br/>
far more stratified than the organization had ever been before and the <br/>
classes were kept quite distinct during the period..It would have been 'bad <br/>
form' to train students in weapons they could not be expected to carry <br/>
openly..so the training was probably hidden or hushed up by the trainees.<br/>
 Hope this helps ya!<br/>
 Abayo.<br/>
