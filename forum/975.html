<h3>Heaven under Earth</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89330385">I have seen that movie.  At least I think it is the same one.  I have <br/>
seen it advertised as Heaven and Earth.  The movie is at least <br/>
loosely based on the rivaly between Takeda Shingen and Uesugi <br/>
Kenshin.  The charater of Kagetora is ,of course, Uesugi.  As to how <br/>
much of the movie is real about the battle, and other things I am not <br/>
sure.  But Kagetora's banner is the same as Uesugi's, and is a <br/>
religious fanatic... just like Uesugi was.  Takeda and Uesugi fought <br/>
several  battles against eachother, but grew to respect eachother a <br/>
great deal.  Another good samurai movie is Taboo.  However, it does <br/>
not take place durring the Sengoku Jidai.  Rather it takes place <br/>
durring the Tokugawa period involving the Shinzen Gumi.  1860 <br/>
something to be as exact as I can off the top of my head.  Which <br/>
makes it at the tail end of the Tokugawa period.  Akira Kurasawa <br/>
movies are really good if you want to see movies set in the Sengoku <br/>
Jidai.  I dont know of any other though, and wouldlike to find out as <br/>
well.</div>
