<h3>Knutsen&#39;s + Kure&#39;s books</h3>
by <i>biz_in_japan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951884989">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
While looking around for Knutsen's 'Japanese Spears:<br/>
Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan' that was highly<br/>
recomend by a few on this list, I came across another of<br/>
his books, 'Japanese Polearms'.  Does any one have this? <br/>
Is it highly recomended?<br/>
<br/>
The only problem is that most places don't have it in stock<br/>
(it's from 1963), the one place I did find it is selling it<br/>
for US$395.00.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also does anyone have Mitsuo Kure's 'SAMURAI: An<br/>
Illustrated History'?  What's your impression of this one?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616208117">I don't have this one. I do have Kure and Kruit's  The Samurai in colour <br/>
photographs. It's not structured as a history but it has lots of good photos <br/>
from various jidai matsuri. I'd imagine An Illustrated History has <br/>
equivalent quality photos.<br/>

from the newest one, but I'm quiet sure others information are available<br/>

If you aren't really deeply concerned in Yari, not sure if it worth the<br/>
money. There are 2 sites in which is available but the price is high on<br/>
both. <br/>

<h3>Knutsen&#39;s + Kure&#39;s books</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-814362487">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I've been somewhat "off-planet" for several months, good to be back in<br/>
the land of samurai-history again; anyway...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >While looking around for Knutsen's 'Japanese Spears:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fortunately I'm lucky enough to have both of these books, and to have<br/>
bought them when they were way more affordable. The second is in essence<br/>
an update of the first, with some differences in content, but not 400<br/>
dollars worth. I would recommend getting his latest book and borrowing<br/>
the other through inter-library loan if you can, so you can compare the<br/>
two without crashing your bank account.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Also does anyone have Mitsuo Kure's 'SAMURAI: An<br/>
>Illustrated History'?  What's your impression of this one?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again a nice book, and worth having for the photographs. Unlike his<br/>
previous work, this is laid out in chronological order, so you can see<br/>
the development of the kit. The book also has sketches by Dr Sasama, aka<br/>
Mr Japanese armour, who sadly died last year.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is of some help.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607285403">Gentlemen<br/>
The book JAPANESE POLEARMS by Knutsen was quite innovative at its time of<br/>
publication, maybe 30 years ago and is still worth having today, but not<br/>
essential. I declined to revue the 2nd book and although I know and admire<br/>
Knutsen quite well, felt this was not his best work.<br/>
