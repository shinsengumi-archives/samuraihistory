<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746704599">Mutsuhito by a top knot.  He steered Japan on a liberal course toward a <br/>
parliamentary democracy.  His armed forces in the  Russo-Japanese War earned renown <br/>
from all foreign correspondents and war observers, like our Black Jack <br/>
Pershing,  for the chivalrous way they handled Russian prisoners.   His death in <br/>
1912 and the suicide of the general Nogi and his wife heralded the true end of <br/>
the Age of the Samurai.  Had Hirohito had an ounce of the courage and character <br/>
that Meiji had,  there would have been no invasion of China nor war  in the <br/>
Pacific.  Of course my opinion is clouded a bit here by the fact that Hirohito's <br/>
minions tried to kill my dad twice, at Leyte Gulf and Okinawa.  Jack M.<br/>
