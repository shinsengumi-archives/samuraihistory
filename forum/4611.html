 </span></blockquote>Think about what you're asking here--it's like asking<br/>
"Who was the most famous soldier in US History?"<br/>
<br/>
George Washington, since he was the commander, and<br/>
later was first President? Robert E. Lee? Grant or<br/>
Eisenhower, who ended their respective wars and went<br/>
on to be Presidents? Audie Murphy, because he was the<br/>
most decorated? Benedict Arnold, for being a great<br/>
general, and then betraying the US? Patton, because<br/>
there was a movie about him, and he was the most<br/>
kick-ass? MacArthur? Westmoreland, for losing?<br/>
<br/>
There are any number of ways to answer your question,<br/>
depending on what you are looking for. Do you want to<br/>
know about samurai who were particularly good<br/>
duelists? Try Miyamoto Musashi, Tsukuhara Bokuden, or<br/>
Kamiizumi Nobutsuna. Great Samurai Generals? Try Oda<br/>
Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu,<br/>
Minamoto Yoshitsune, Minamoto Yoshinaka, Takeda<br/>
Shingen, Uesugi Kenshin, Date Masamune, Mori Motonari,<br/>
Ashikaga Takauji, Nitta Yoshisada, Kusunoki Masashige,<br/>
Taira Kiyomori....and on, and on...and on....<br/>
<br/>
Samurai who were famous for loyalty? Yamanaka<br/>
Shikanosuke, the 47 Ronin (look under "Chushingura"),<br/>
Hashiba/Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Benkei, Shimizu Muneharu,<br/>
The Tsuchiya family, etc., etc....<br/>
<br/>
Samurai who were famous for being inept or for not<br/>
being loyal, etc: Akechi Mitsuhide, any of the<br/>
Ashikaga after Yoshinori, The Akamatsu, Matsunaga<br/>
Hisahide and Miyoshi Nagayoshi, Anayama Baisetsu...<br/>
<br/>
Samurai who were most often the subject of<br/>
movies/plays/TV shows/Manga/anime? Wow...way too many<br/>
to list.<br/>
<br/>
Refine your question and you'll get plenty of<br/>
opinions, probably all conflicting, but at least it<br/>
will give you an idea of where to look. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Buhahahaha... true... true... how unfair!! :oO<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the bias is due to the fact that some people here knows that I <br/>
am European, and as you know we Europeans are famous for getting away <br/>
smoothly even when we act like complete morons<br/>
;o)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, SORRY!!! I WAS JUST KIDDING!! Thought it was too tempting... <br/>
couldn't resist... the question was too cute...<br/>
