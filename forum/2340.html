<div id="ygrps-yiv-914123957">I have been definitely able to confirm the use of matchlock pistols by <br/>
samurai during the Age of the Country at War!    A samurai is depicted shooting a <br/>
matchlock pistol  in a painting by the famed artist Kuniyoshi  Utagawa  <br/>
(1797-1861).  One is clearly shown firing such a pistol  in an illustration from the  <br/>
Budo Geijutsu hiden sue in the library of the National Diet (Parliament) in <br/>
Tokyo.  Furthermore, an actual specimen is displayed in the Victoria and Albert <br/>
Museum in London.  Cheers,  Prof John F. Murphy Jr.<br/>
