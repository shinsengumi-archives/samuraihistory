<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015778500">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
  In a video game of mine and throughout a couple of books I have <br/>
read and seen Naomasa. He was a great daimyo and lead the "Red <br/>
Devils". What happened to him? There is nothing in the archives about <br/>
him even though he was a great samurai. Any thoughts?<br/>

I know, I have to put a search function in there...<br/>
<br/>
Here is some info:<br/>
<br/>
 Naomasa was born in Hôda village in the Inasa district of Tôtômi province,=<br/>
 the only son of Ii Naochika and the daughter of Okuyama Chikatomo; he enter=<br/>
ed the service of Tokuagwa Ieyasu around 1578, and quickly distiguished hims=<br/>
elf as a brave fighter; he commanded 3,000 men at the Battle of Nagakute and=<br/>
 did great damage to the ikeda troops he faced with gunnery fire; following =<br/>
the Tokugawa transfer to the Kanto in 1590, Naomasa was given Minowa Castle =<br/>
in Kôzuke province, worth 12.000 koku; at the start of the Sekigahara Campai=<br/>
gn, he participated in the attack on Gifu Castle and at the actual Battle of=<br/>
 Sekigahara commanded 3,600 men; at Sekigahara he acted as an escort to Ieya=<br/>
su's son Tadayoshi but managed to draw first blood, outpacing the troops of =<br/>
Fukushima Masanori and attacking Ukita Hideie's contingent; at the end of th=<br/>
e battle he was shot and wounded by a Shimazu sniper; he was afterwards awar=<br/>
ded Sawayama in Ômi province but died in 1602, evidently as a result of his =<br/>
Sekigahara wound; he was noted from dressing his men in red armor, and his c=<br/>
ontingent was often known as Ii's 'Red Devils' for its fighting spirit (Ii h=<br/>
imself was sometimes called 'Akaoni', or Red Devil/ogre) <br/>
Sons: Naotsugu (H), Naotaka <br/>
Other names: Ii Manchiyo <br/>
