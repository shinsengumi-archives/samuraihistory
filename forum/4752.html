<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although Hideyoshi is the most well known person to receive the <br/>
title of Kampaku, it was actually passed down between several houses <br/>
in turn in pretty much an unbroken line until Hideyoshi.<br/>
<br/>
The houses of Konoe, Takatsuka, Kujo, Nijo, and Ichijo (offshoots of <br/>
the Fujiwara) all held the title, as well as Sessho (the aid to a <br/>
child emperor, as opposed to Kampaku, who was the aid to an adult <br/>
emperor).<br/>
<br/>
On this page, you'll find a full list of Sessho and Kampaku from 858-<br/>
1868 (it's near the bottom):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.friesian.com/sangoku.htm">http://www.friesian.com/sangoku.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Ichijo Fusaie is listed under a different name, I think. I can't <br/>
verify the accuracy of this list, but the post-Toyotomi Kampaku seem <br/>
to stack up with other sources.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Kanpaku is not a unique title. It's like asking about Benjamin Harrison having <br/>
held the title of president, which Abraham Lincoln is known to have had. Lincoln <br/>
wasn't the only one, and neither was Hideyoshi -- not by a long shot.<br/>
<br/>
A kanpaku the regent for an adult emperor (some translate it as Chancellor). <br/>
Since the office was instituted the late 9th century, there have been  over 200 <br/>
kanpaku appointmemnts (I was counting, and stopped at 100 when there was at <br/>
least another page of small typed names).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As others have mentioned there were plenty of people who held <br/>
the title of Kanpaku. There were something like 150 who held <br/>
the title Kanpaku - and another 50 or so who held the title <br/>
Sesshou. The difference between the two titles is that the Kanpaku <br/>
"advised" an adult emperor but a Sesshou "advised" an emperor who <br/>
had not yet come of age.<br/>
<br/>
I looked up Ichijo Fusaie. It appears that there were 31 members of <br/>
the Ichijo family who held the post of Kanpaku or Sesshou. I can't <br/>
find a person named Fusaie on the list. Not to say it didn't happen - <br/>
but I haven't been able to confirm it for myself after some looking.<br/>
<br/>
Ichjijo Fusaie &#19968;&#26465;&#25151;&#23478; lived from 1475-1539. His farther Norifusa 教<br/>
房 was Kanpaku between 1458-1463. His son Fusamichi 房道 was Kanpaku <br/>
between 1545-1548. But it looks like Fusaie himself never held the <br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Here's another list - I didn't compare the two but Fusaie doesn't <br/>
appear on either of them:<br/>

Here is a timeline that includes some information about Fusaie <br/>
himself:<br/>

<br/>
It looks like his highest rank was "Ken-Dainagon"<br/>

remarkable for a retired dainagon) but that's it.<br/>

Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I just checked his bio in the sengoku jinmei jiten. I think what might <br/>
have messed you up is that the first line (and second) identifies him as the <br/>
second son of Kanpaku Ichijô Norifusa -- you might have missed the line split <br/>
that identifies him as a son rather than the kanpaku itself.<br/>
