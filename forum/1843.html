<h3>Atrocities in Sweden and Tokugawa</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400420408">Your comments already were an atrocity by itself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"A swedish king said I'm gonna be<br/>
baptised, and everybody who has a porblem with it, chop! chop! One head<br/>
shorter. I.E. your king is catholic, now the rest of sweden is catholic."<br/>
<br/>
Ya say like this is not an atrocity?!? I think nowaddays christians like ya<br/>
are the same like the Adolf Hitler and that ol' norwegian knew as Olaf, the<br/>
Missionary King (who killed more than 4000 at his own country just because<br/>
they refused to be baptised on this new faith of "love"). (read Snorri<br/>
Sturlusson Olaf's Saga)<br/>
<br/>
Does  ye call "some few witchhunts" as just something boring at all?<br/>
Is it not an atrocity?<br/>
<br/>
The total UNPROVOKED destruction of the Old Holy Upsala Temple of Ingve<br/>
Freyr, lord and the TRUE patron of Sweden of Sviþjód, like Amaterassu<br/>
Omikami is for the entire Japan is NOT an atrocity?<br/>
<br/>
Of course! I remember! We non christians don't have a soul, then if we are<br/>
buddhists or shinto, or any other non christian religion, it is not a sin,<br/>
nor an atrocity if somebody kill us...<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyassu avoided the total cultural and religious diversity<br/>
destruction of Japan, don't allowing this travesty.<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa gave total incentive to cultural development with the peace he<br/>
achieved with his policies. And even much of the Kenjitsu styles enriched<br/>
themselves in an cultural way that was rarelly compared to other ages.<br/>

<br/>
Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I'm a lurker of this mailing list; that means i read it but shut up<br/>
since I realize i really cant add anything to the discussions here.<br/>
Until now that is.<br/>
<br/>
Note: This is mainly written in an Ironic and sarcastic tone, and the<br/>
dates ar approximately right, I may be off by +<br/>
+/- 75 years or so. Never really botherd with dates.<br/>
<br/>
I just so happen to live in Sweden, the southern part of Sweden. History<br/>
is my favourite hobby, and I really cant recall any autrocities done by<br/>
the catholic curch to us. In teh begining when some monks came to our<br/>
country (were talking 600-800AD) we killed the anoying ones direktly,<br/>
and left the harmless ones to to what ever they wanted, as long as they<br/>
didnt piss us off. Not untill the 1300AD I think (Not sure on exact<br/>
dates, may be later may be sooner) A swedish king said I'm gonna be<br/>
baptised, and everybody who has a porblem with it, chop! chop! One head<br/>
shorter. I.E. your king is catholic, now the rest of sweden is catholic.<br/>
This held up for a time, and we had the usual witchhunts and stuff, but<br/>
noting to out of place in Europe during 1400-1600. Then a jolly good'ol<br/>
chap named Gustav Wasa, decided to change from catholic to protestant,<br/>
and the chatolic got thrown out. tyhis was maily done outof economic<br/>
reasons. The catholic curch is sinfully rich, but the protestants favour<br/>
poverty, ie more taxes to the King. yay! If i remember correctly this is<br/>
some where during the begining of 1500. And since then we have had wars<br/>
with polen, Turkey, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Finland, And a few others<br/>
that just so happend to be on the way to Polen and Turkey. I have no<br/>
recoolection what so ever of autrocities of the scale of the spanish and<br/>
portugal in South america, or the english men in China, or the french<br/>
and Dutch in Africa. Who, in the name of the pop enslaved ppl for the<br/>
sake of christianity.<br/>
<br/>
Nope, we are friendly, peacefull people in Sweden, and as such we have<br/>
been treated nicely by the Father.<br/>
<br/>
 Well thats what I remember from my history lessons in my 12 year carer<br/>
of grammar school, junior high and highschool.<br/>
<br/>
Now what was the autricities you were talking about?<br/>
Apart from the usual witchhunts and heretic slaying, of the dark ages?<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-908275034">i am not a christian i am not baptised or have undergone the communium<br/>
of jesus.<br/>
I am an agnostic. Protagaros was an agnostic in ancient greece. He said<br/>
that he could neither say that the gods exist or that they do not exist.<br/>
Thomas H. Huxly natural scientist and agnostic, said that the knowledge<br/>
of the existance of god or any deity can not be obteind by man, for man<br/>
is not advanced enough to be able to obtain that knowled of an<br/>
omnipotent and omniscifient beeing.<br/>
<br/>
In other words I do not accept nor deny the existance of God.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I should have frased it differntly. For that I apologise. <br/>
<br/>
What atrocities other than those common to ther era and nature of the<br/>
mideval age, has happend in Sweden? If we were to disseminate all the<br/>
bad things that happend during the mideval ages, I dare to say that all<br/>
countries are guilty to some extent. I mean totally choking massslaying<br/>
of people, that in the mideval ages would be called an autrocity.<br/>
<br/>
So you found my funny little email adress. Yes i am very proud of that<br/>
little joke ^_^<br/>
It was given to me by a friend in Estland (Estonia), since baka is the<br/>
word i use when i swear, instead of the usual swedish "Faan också!" and<br/>
that the Anime portal he is building in Estland happen to have the same<br/>
domain name, he gave it to me as a joke. I am very proud of it, since it<br/>
is befitting to my sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
And when we are on the topic of emails, you sign your email as "Octavio<br/>
Augusto Okimoto Alves de Carvalho" but in the From space it says "Meðal<br/>
Mikit Stór-ljon Oddhinsson" and that if my maind hasen't gon YoYo in the<br/>
light of day, is an Icelandic name. And that does explain why you know<br/>
more about Swedish history than I do. I know a bit, but not nearly as<br/>
much as you do.<br/>
