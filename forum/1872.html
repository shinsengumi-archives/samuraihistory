	My point was that it is a little hypocritical to say it is ok <br/>
to chat about mopeds because they are Japanese, but not politics <br/>
because they are European. After all the discussion of European <br/>
history and politics started from a posting about things Japanese and <br/>
may well have returned to that subject in time.<br/>
	This list has been quiet for so long I thought it was dead. <br/>
Once people are talking we ought to be able to draw the conversation <br/>
into areas more on topic. The Swiss are the Pope's samurai don't you <br/>
know...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281761634">As a moderator of this forum, I'd prefer we don't start labeling some <br/>
discussions "Not Samurai Related", because then that opens the door <br/>
for hundreds of completely off-topic posts.  As long as a topic is <br/>
even vaguely or marginally related to Japanese history or culture or <br/>
Japan or Japanese, it is free to go (and I think that gives a lot of <br/>
leeway in discussion, and I'm not against history-related posts that <br/>
are more or less off-topic).  Allowing a free-reign of completely off-<br/>
topic posts opens a can of worms I'd prefer to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
