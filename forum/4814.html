 </span></blockquote>Two branches of the Honda family served Ieyasu - one, as you said, <br/>
was led by Honda Tadakatsu. The other was headed by Honda Masanobu, <br/>
who wasn't known as a great warrior (due to an illness he suffered <br/>
during his youth, I vaguely recall reading that this might have been <br/>
polio, but I might be confusing that with Date Masamune), but <br/>
Masanobu acted in a diplomatic and administrative role for the <br/>
Tokugawa. He was also known as a political schemer, but was very <br/>
close to Ieyasu, and later Hidetada. Another fairly vague <br/>
recollection I have is that the founder of Honda Motor Corp. was <br/>
descended from this branch of the family.</div>

 </span></blockquote>My understanding, though there is a high chance I'm<br/>
confused, is that Honda Tadakatsu (�{&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;jand Honda<br/>
Masanobu (�{�c&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;M�jwere in fact NOT related, as<br/>
evidenced by the different kanji for "Honda" that you<br/>
see. What I'm not sure about is the actual kanji for<br/>
Masanobu's "Honda"--I've seen it both ways, and not<br/>
sure if it's just carelessness on one side or the<br/>
other. I'm currently at work and not able to look for<br/>
the correct kanji, so if someone could help out?<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I believe the car company is �{�c, so<br/>
possibly a relation to Masanobu, but definitely not<br/>
one of Tadakatsu. <br/>

I looked in a fairly abriged but well done biographical dictionary I <br/>
have - &#26085;&#26412;&#20154;&#21517;&#36766;&#20856; by &#12467;&#12531;&#12469;&#12452;&#12473;. It appears that both Tadakatsu <br/>
and Masanobu are written 本多, and they seem to be vaguely related <br/>
though it's not clear how. See for example<br/>

I made my own search and net browsing about this Honda Toshitugu and found nothing about this name. Yeah, you are quite right; theres nothing about this person but only the flag. Is it not quite strange that the date and place of his birth is unknown but a flag or a banner that usually represent a group or a tribe, a clan and even a national identity is attached to this single person(perhaps a head of the family Im not really sure), yet nothing is recorded of him? We are familiar that banners or flags are used as a rallying point in a military charge or as a symbol of unity and solidarity. But the identity of the man linked with a flag had been neglected. Quite strange, isnt it?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some in our group have already given their share with regard to this persona yet they still admit that the answers theyve provided are only tentative at best & dont really hit the target. Mine is also one of them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Naomasa mentioned already the two Hondas that served under the Tokugawa Ieasu. So this family may have been well known during the Edo period. Theres another Honda that also lived during this period; his name is Honda Toshiaki (born 1744 in Echiga province,died in Edo 1822). He is a mathematician & a scholar who advocated Western ideas and techniques to be adopted by the Japanese government. He studied the Dutch language that influenced him to become open-minded Japanese pertaining to other cultures especially Western cultures. (During that period Japan was in isolation and the only Western country they have in contact with is Holland or the Dutch). This Toshiaki is also interested in economics and his study of the relationships between food supply and the growth of population led him to the same conclusion as the English economist Thomas Malthus. He advocated many ideas prompting the Japanese government to end the isolation policy of the Tokugawa; improve their coastal defenses and<br/>
 the imperial expansion of Japan. He proposed many ideas to improve the economic status of Japan by utilizing many Western ideas and techniques.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now I wonder if this Toshiaki is the same as Toshitugu, (I just hope so. Still Im aware that Im standing on a shaky ground.) But the Japanese already had a custom of changing their names so it might be probable that with some sleight of circumstance Toshiaki had been changed to Toshitogu. (Still Im not very sure). Im not an expert of the Japanese language but I came to observe that Japanese words especially verbs changes their suffixes to change the form of tenses, sometimes to negate the affirmative word that are used in negative sentences. And Japanese names are not given haphazardly to individuals but that the character of the person or the character he is supposed to posses is closely linked with the appellations that are given to the person. We see this prevalent in many traditional cultures. Im only speaking in a general sense & claim no any expertise in this subject. Anyone who might have some linguistic background in analyzing this can please confirm or reject this<br/>
 proposition.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, at least; we are headed in the right direction. Honda may have been an illustrious family name. We can trace it back to the Edo period and perhaps even beyond, and that there are families of Hondas who served in the administration of the Shogun. The Honda mentioned by Naomasa whom he barely remembered as the founder of The Honda Motors Corporation is Honda Soichiro who may also have been connected to this family. By checking to the lineage of this family we may arrive to the identification of this Honda Toshitugu.       <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, if it was the person's personal standard<br/>
(uma-jirushi), then there is nothing odd about it at<br/>
all. Personal standards were used by most well-known<br/>
generals as a big "I AM HERE" marker, for both friend<br/>
and foe to see. Hideyoshi used the golden gourd (be it<br/>
1 or 1,000 is up to which version you read), Ieyasu<br/>
used a golden fan, Nobunaga used an umbrella...but we<br/>
also have examples where generals used flags. Takeda<br/>
Katsuyori used a big square flag with the character ��<br/>
"Dai" on it. It's quite possible that this Toshitsugu<br/>
had a similiar uma-jirushi to identify his location to<br/>
his troops in battle. Of course, the flag description<br/>
(Can the original person who asked the question post<br/>
the description of the flag, as it may help ID him)<br/>
may be a description of the sashimono his retainers<br/>
wore, or of a personal sashimono he wore. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, it's possible, but I wouldn't say it's probable.<br/>
You could conjecture, with some certainty (51%<br/>
anyways), that being as they both had the surname<br/>
Honda, and the character "Toshi" in their given names,<br/>
that they were related. Beyond that, it's simply<br/>
conjecture to say he was the same person, or the son,<br/>
or father, or brother, or whomever. You can't get that<br/>
out of the names. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This doesn't have anything to do with Japanese naming<br/>
conventions. You don't "conjugate" names. While it was<br/>
common for Japanese of the period to change their<br/>
names (Kinoshita Tokichiro -- Kinoshita Hideyoshi --<br/>
Hashiba Hideyoshi --Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Matsudaira<br/>
Motonobu -- Motoyasu -- Tokugawa Motoyasu -- Tokugawa<br/>
Ieyasu being the two most commonly known cases), it<br/>
had nothing to do with conjugating or negating prior<br/>
meanings. <br/>
<br/>

Now I went to the Japanese google, and tried a few<br/>
different combinations of Honda Toshitsugu. Nothing<br/>
came up for �{�c&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;@or �{&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;. <br/>

It looks like he paid for renovations to the Zenkou-ji<br/>
temple in Shinano (Nagano) in 1661. Funnily enough,<br/>
the background on this site is the Honda mon, but I<br/>
thought that was only the Tadakatsu branch. <br/>

That seems to be all for him. <br/>

Let me wade through the descriptions for the other<br/>
Honda ("da" being the character for much, "ooi"), and<br/>
I'll post them. This email is getting way too long.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay--actually, it appears there were THREE branches. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/h_ohta/rekisi/kamei/honda.htm">http://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/h_ohta/rekisi/kamei/honda.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
All seem to come from a common Honda Sukemasa<br/>
(�{&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;), but branch off at various points.<br/>
Tadakatsu is the first famous person in one of the<br/>
branches, Masanobu is the start of branch 3, and<br/>
branch two is started by Honda Tadatsugu (&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;), the<br/>
grandfather of out Toshitsugu. His father's name was<br/>
Yasutsugu (�N��). Toshitsugu was born in 1595 as the<br/>
oldest son. In 1621 he inherited Yasutsugu's 35,000<br/>
koku fief in Mikawa. In 1636 he moved to Kameyama-jo<br/>
in Ise, and his fief increased to 50,000 koku. In 1651<br/>
he moved to Omi province, and increased to 70,000<br/>
koku. In 1664 he relinquished head of the family to<br/>
his 2nd son, Yasu(?) �i�N��) (Someone help me with the<br/>
reading..."sho" is the only one I know), and died in<br/>
1668.<br/>
<br/>
And that settles my question about the different "da"<br/>
kanji also--both Masanobu and Tadakatsu used ��. �{�c,<br/>
with the "field" character, however, is the Motor<br/>
Company (I checked), so it's doubtful that it's<br/>
connected with the Honda family above. Unless, of<br/>
course, as is possible, someone changed the character.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Would that be any relation to the Honda Yasutoshi who is currently <br/>
the featured samurai on the Samurai Archives homepage? It would <br/>
suggest that Yasutoshi was Toshitsugu's (adopted) uncle, but I'm <br/>
getting confused with all these Hondas now...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, then, my findings should have helped a little. I<br/>
gave you born/died, father, and son...I'll see if I<br/>
can dig up anything on other kids, etc. As fas as at<br/>
any major historical happenings, you could argue he<br/>
missed all those--too young for Sekigahara, being born<br/>
in 1595. Though he would have been 20 at the siege of<br/>
Osaka, so that gives you something there to work with,<br/>
possibly. <br/>
