<br/>
Two replies to my Namban Tetsu post on other lists may be of interest to some Samurai History listeros.  I copy them below FYI.  One is from Dr John P. Lissenden (author of  "The Namban Group of Japanese Sword Guards: A Reappraisal" - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Namban-Group-Japanese-Sword-Guards/dp/1554043654/sr=1-20/qid=1172019544/ref=sr_1_20/203-3814316-7928767?ie=UTF8&s=books)">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Namban-Group-Japanese-Sword-Guards/dp/1554043654/sr=1-20/qid=1172019544/ref=sr_1_20/203-3814316-7928767?ie=UTF8&s=books)</a>.  The other is from Dr. Philip Vos Fellman.<br/>
<br/>
I also noted a large number of new books about Japan on amazon <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s?ie=UTF8&rh=n%3A271274%2Cp_3%3A%C2%A330%20-%20%C2%A350&page=1">http://www.amazon.co.uk/s?ie=UTF8&rh=n%3A271274%2Cp_3%3A%C2%A330%20-%20%C2%A350&page=1</a><br/>

Dear Barry<br/>
<br/>
I was very interested by the article that you posted on namban tetsu, <br/>
but am a little unhappy about the implied supposition that cannon from <br/>
the 'De Liefde' were the original source of this metal.<br/>
<br/>
I had believed that bronze - a mixture of 90% copper and 10% tin - was <br/>
the preferred metal used for the casting of cannon. Although cast-iron <br/>
cannon became available ca 1550, these were much more difficult to <br/>
cast, and bronze remained the metal of choice until the mid to late <br/>
C17. Since the 'De Liefde' arrived in Kyushu in 1600, is it not highly <br/>
likely that its cannon were of bronze rather than of iron?<br/>
<br/>
Is there an expert on cannon out there somewhere who can clarify this <br/>
point for me?<br/>
<br/>
Regards, John L.<br/>

Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
  You can get a better picture of Japan's comparative<br/>
trade position, in part from a book I found in the<br/>
Cornell University library (actually translated into<br/>
English believe it or not) "Japan Must Fight Britain"<br/>
by Lt. Commander Tota Isshimaru, Imperial Japanese<br/>
Navy, 1926.  A lot of good discussion on the British<br/>
use of Singapore to promote trade monopolies.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Phil<br/>

 <br/>
The cannon on the 'De Liefde' were indeed made out of bronze. This was verfied by a cargo manifest prepared by a Jesuit that was sent on board to inspect the ship. </span></blockquote></div>
