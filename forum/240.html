<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268634595">Hi Christopher - <br/>
<br/>
I've got a copy of 'Ryoma', and I'm afraid I don't rate it much. It<br/>
falls between trying to be a biography, a history, and a novel, and <br/>
thereby (IMHO) doesn't achieve any of them.<br/>
<br/>
I am not familiar with the period, but would say the author has done<br/>
his homework, however I just didn't get a 'feeling' for the<br/>
characters, they just didn't catch me. A shame, really. And by a<br/>
third of the way in if another character 'snickered' one more time, <br/>
I was ready to rip the thing in half.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry<br/>
<br/>

are correct and his subject interesting, will let you know what kind of<br/>
writer I think he is after I finish both books.<br/>
    BTW he will be doing a book signing at the Northern California Japanese<br/>
Sword Club Annual taikai in August.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721745003">I have read both books and had the same feeling as the other replies, good<br/>
history but not such a great novel. In some respects the Ryoma book was<br/>
easier to read than Jansens book. Instead of writing a 'novel' he should<br/>
have just wrote a straight history. I would have been more pleased with<br/>
that. Same for the Samurai Sketches. All in all anybody who likes samurai<br/>
would like these books. Yes he did overuse the word snicker. Guess he<br/>
couldn't afford a decent thesaurus.<br/>
<br/>
Along the lines of samurai historical fiction have you read the new<br/>
translation of Shiba Ryotaros Drunk as a Lord. Now there is a true author. I<br/>
highly recommend that one. Too bad more of his books aren't available in<br/>
English.<br/>

Wow, A wide divergence of opinion on this book, I found it to be a very <br/>
enjoyable read, in fact I am on my second go around.<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>
