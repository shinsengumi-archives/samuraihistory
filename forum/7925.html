[snip very good comments about the film SEPPUKU as "entertainment". Though I <br/>
personally don't see it as "entertainment" but we're probably just talking <br/>
semantics here.]<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I agree with one of the other posters that in this regard, films are best <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That's exactly the point I was trying to make. And probably was not very <br/>
clear about it. Which actually is the reason why I see SEPPUKU as more than just <br/>
"entertainment." It certainly isn't claiming to be a depiction of exact <br/>
history. It's not saying that, in real life, there truly existed a ronin named <br/>
Tsugumo Hanshiro who avenged the death of his son-in-law Chijiiwa Motome by taking <br/>
several top-knots and slaying several other members of the Ii clan. <br/>
<br/>
There are some points of entertainment. I also loved the part where Tsugumo <br/>
tosses the topknots at the Ii clan, and loved their shocked reaction. But <br/>
unlike most "noble ronin" chambara films (which I LOVE, by the way), SEPPUKU goes a <br/>
lot further. I don't get that "jumping off" inspiration to study real history <br/>
when watching most of the chambara/jidai-geki films that I watch.   <br/>
<br/>
SEPPUKU goes way beyond just "noble ronin" entertainment. It has raised <br/>
issues. It has made me want to do actual historical research. It was a "jumping <br/>
off" point. And in that way, it has value to me as a tool for studying history. <br/>
<br/>
I hope I'm making myself a bit more clearer than mud.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have a great point here. I also saw (and really enjoyed) THE PATRIOT. On <br/>
one hand, it used a historical background. But it was a fictional account set <br/>
against this historical background. I think that SEPPUKU had a similar format <br/>
and intent. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >even here the well made chanbara film, such as Yojimbo, can expose the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that films like SEPPUKU, SEVEN SAMURAI, and YOJIMBO raise issues <br/>
rather than intending to be depictions of actual history. SEVEN SAMURAI raises the <br/>
issue of class differences and YOJIMBO raises the issue of the ending of an <br/>
era. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, SEPPUKU raises more issues than the other two do. It's such a <br/>
multi-level film, which is why it is a masterpiece. Just in my opinion, and <br/>
I'm neither a crendentialed historian nor a film expert, but I believe that <br/>
SEPPUKU outdoes either YOJIMBO and SEVEN SAMURAI. But all these films are <br/>
masterpieces.  <br/>
<br/>
Films like these were not intended to be accounts of actual history. Instead, <br/>
they pose a "jumping-off" point for researching actual history.<br/>
