<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676082621">Hi!I'm new to this group. I would like to exchange information and <br/>
opinions.<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested in the revenge of samurai, such as Chushingura. Some <br/>
say the revenge of samurai showed thier royalty to thier samurai <br/>
spirits, admiring it. Others say there was no need or reason to do so <br/>
but the social custom forced samurai, critisizing it. <br/>
What is your opinion about the revenge of samurai? How do you feel <br/>
about it? <br/>
   Thank you...</div>

	I feel at its heart the revenge of the Ako Roshi was an <br/>
attack on the Tokugawa system. Hence their immediate popularity. The <br/>
Bakufu had no choice but to silence them lest they influence others <br/>
who may have been thinking of taking the law into their own hands...<br/>
