<h3>TLS armor problems</h3>
by <i>elizabethchase1</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-497447589">Hey, I appreciate anyone's knowledge...<br/>
<br/>
I guess the thought I had with respect to armor had more to do with someone 'back then' wearing a suit of yoroi that was several <br/>
generations old.   I don't know much yet about identifying armor, so I cannot tell what was wrong about the armor in TLS.   And <br/>
remember, that production had it's own technical advisor, and none of us know what went on between that/those person/s and the <br/>
director.  What I need to do is get my arse over to a good library and set some books out side by side....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, time to move on.....    I have to go study medieval history by watching 'Return of the King'.....<br/>

<br/>
Taken care of, it could last quite a long time. As for<br/>
how impoverished were they? Well, there were rich<br/>
samurai, and poor ones. The Shogunate doesn't enter<br/>
into this, since as you point out it was defunct for 2<br/>
decades, so I'm not sure where you are going with that<br/>
question.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349504452">I went into the movie with one thought.... Edo jidai was the birthplace of <br/>
some abominations in the armour realm, so most anything should be <br/>
acceptable. Right?.......<br/>
<br/>
The mixtures of styles was acceptable. The plain poor construction of the <br/>
suit you see the most of (The red nuinobe worn by Cruise) was not. I cringe <br/>
every time I see a still of the film. The armour of the non-key members of <br/>
the rebellion on the whole wasn't bad. There was a preponderance of *odd* <br/>
styles (Saiga-bachi etc.). ....And haven't we already had this discussion?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don't you just hate typing out long replies, and then<br/>
losing it all because your net goes down? Arrgh.<br/>
<br/>
It's tricky because of the time of the movie. Yoroi<br/>
weren't in common use once the samurai stopped being<br/>
mounted archers and became mounted spearmen--the Yoroi<br/>
was designed all wrong for that. In the Sengoku, you<br/>
don't see too many yoroi--most of those you do see<br/>
were worn by upper ranking general types who didn't<br/>
actually expect to be in the thick of things. It was<br/>
kind of a "see how rich I am, that I can afford an<br/>
antique like this in pristine condition? And I have a<br/>
full bodyguard to keep me from having to rely on<br/>
it..." deal. <br/>
<br/>
After warfare stopped for the most part in the Edo<br/>
period, armor became more for presentation and<br/>
display. "Arms and Armour of the Samurai" by Bottomley<br/>
and Hopson does a great job of explaining why Edo<br/>
period pieces are mainly presentation and highly<br/>
impractical. Some of this presentation stuff went into<br/>
yoroi becoming popular again, among many other things.<br/>
Tokugawa Yoshimune was known to wear a yoroi at times,<br/>
when out on "maneuvers". <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the armor in TLS could conceivably have<br/>
been a reflection (as I think someone else points out<br/>
in another response) of the eclectic array of display<br/>
armor created over the last 200 years. Is it well-made<br/>
Sengoku armor? No. Should we expect it to be? Not<br/>
really. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably a lot of<br/>
<br/>
"But that's not right!"<br/>
<br/>
"Shutup, I'm the director, and that's what Americans<br/>
want to see"<br/>
<br/>
"okay"<br/>

the French. <br/>
