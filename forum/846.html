<h3>Leeds Royal Armouries 12th May</h3>
by <i>ray_samuraiuk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074066284">Hello Rod<br/>
<br/>
               My name is Ray King and I'm from Washington in Tyne & Wear.It's pointless descibing myself so I will   <br/>
               ask around first for the North Herts scale modelling club and then for you.It would be great to meet up<br/>
               with you and any other fellow members of the samuraihistory group.<br/>
               As you already know I am interested in the battle of Nagashino (Shidarahara) and own Ospreys<br/>
               Campaign Book No.69 "Nagashino 1575 (Slaughter at the Barricades) writen by Stephen Turnbull".<br/>
               This book is of great value in my research,but the battlefield diagram on page 70-71 shows the charge<br/>
               and Sakai Tadatsugu as being on the right flank behind Okubu Tadayo.This is misleading as Sakai<br/>
               was in overall command of the raiding party on the forts of Tobigasuyama.<br/>
               I am also having problems acounting for all the troops involved in the battle.As yet I have only<br/>
               researched the Oda/Tokugawa contingents as follows.................................................................<br/>
               Mizuno Nobumoto.........................................................................................................1,000 men<br/>
               Sakuma Nobumori.........................................................................................................2,000 men<br/>
               Niwa Nagahide..............................................................................................................2,000 men<br/>
               Oda Nobunaga..............................................................................................................4,000 men<br/>
               Hashiba Hideyoshi.........................................................................................................2,000 men<br/>
               Takigawa Kazumasu.....................................................................................................2,000 men<br/>
               Torii Mototada...............................................................................................................  800 men<br/>
               Tokugawa Nobuyasu.....................................................................................................1,000 men<br/>
               Ishikawa Kazumasa......................................................................................................1,000 men<br/>
               Tokugawa Ieyasu..........................................................................................................2,000 men<br/>
               Honda Takakatsu...........................................................................................................1,000 men<br/>
               Sakakibara Yasumasa...................................................................................................1,000 men<br/>
               Osuka Yasutaka.............................................................................................................1,000 men<br/>
               Okubo Tadayo...............................................................................................................1,000 men<br/>
               Est.Total of Troops in battle line...................................................................................21,800 men<br/>
               Add to this the Arquebus Corps......................................................................................3,000 men<br/>
               The Raiding Party..........................................................................................................3,000 men<br/>
               The Rear Guard.............................................................................................................4,000 men<br/>
               Shibata Katsuie.............................................................................................................2,000 men<br/>
               This gives an est.grand total of....................................................................................33,800 men<br/>
<br/>
               In the text Shibata Katsuie is mentioned as supporting Hashiba Hideyoshi when the Takeda<br/>
               cavalry under the command of the Sanada brothers managed to break through into the Oda<br/>
               lines where they engaged in hand-to-hand combat for a short time before being killed.<br/>
               Unfortunately there is no mention of him being in charge of any contingent,but being one of<br/>
               Oda Nobunaga's Fudai-shu (Hereditary Vassals) along with Niwa Nagahide and Sakuma<br/>
               Nobumori who both had positions in the battle line,surely Shibata Katsuie had the same amount<br/>
               of men under his command and was given a position on the battlefield.<br/>
               It is estimated that Oda Nobunaga had 30,000 men and that Tokugawa Ieyasu had 8,000 men<br/>
               which gives me a shortfall even allowing for (Shibata Katsuie having 2,000 men) of 4,200 men.<br/>
               I realise that the mounted samurai of the allied sides fought dismounted during the 8 hour <br/>
               battle supporting the ashigaru spear and arquebus in their position behind the palisade fence<br/>
               and only mounted for the pursuit of the Takeda once these had begun their retreat.<br/>
               Are these unaccounted men therefore horse holders for the dismounted samurai ?<br/>
               Of the Tozama-shu (the "Outer Lords") only Takigawa Kazumasu is mentioned and given a <br/>
               position in the battle line, so where were the others "Nagaoka Fujitaka,Akechi Mitsuhide,<br/>
               Ando Noritoshi and Mori Yoshinari".<br/>
               My last question concerns the colours of various sashimono's, the samuraihistory group<br/>
               have provided the mons of the lords and their clans, but what of the colours ?<br/>
               Was Tokugawa Nobuyasu's mon the same as his fathers at the battle and was Hashiba<br/>
               Hideyoshi's mon the same as his later Toyotomi mon.<br/>
               Sorry this has been so long winded,but I do need this information!!!<br/>
               See you on Sunday at the Royal Armouries at Leeds.<br/>
<br/>
                                                                                                                           Ray King.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296950476">I believe Stephen Turnbull will only be at the Armouries in the <br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
I also hope to attend subject to family commitments.<br/>
<br/>
Any other details about the event would be most helpful as the <br/>
armouries web site mentions nothing.<br/>
<br/>
During May the Armouries are having jousting events on weekends, so <br/>
thats an added attraction for going!<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>
