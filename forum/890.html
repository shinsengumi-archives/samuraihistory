<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475586135">Hi Everyone<br/>
<br/>
   I am trying to compile a map of Japan during the sengoku jidai <br/>
that I am happy with, the maps I have found are good but I always <br/>
want them to go a bit further listing more than the old province <br/>
names.  Anyhow I have found this site which has links to loads of old <br/>
maps <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.duke.edu/ias/eac/jpnmap.htm">http://www.lib.duke.edu/ias/eac/jpnmap.htm</a> it is excellent the <br/>
detail on the maps is superb, shame I can't read Japanese as well as <br/>
I'd like.  Anyhow Edo stretts digital , from Tokyo university in <br/>
Tokyo has maps of samurai houses and daimyo residences cool I would <br/>
say. If anyone has any good maps I'd appreciate a post ,anyhow I'll <br/>
continue working on my project Later then.<br/>
