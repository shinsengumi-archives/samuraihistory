<h3>Tough one: shincho vs. shinsen gumis</h3>
by <i>merridewe</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-337689602">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
I'm new. Hope I'm in the right place to ask this. I'm researching <br/>
key figures of the Shinsengumi, particularly Isami Kondo and <br/>
Kamo Serizawa. They were of course members of the <br/>
Shinsengumi, but I've also run accross something called the <br/>
Shinchogumi. It that the same thing? If not, what is it?<br/>
<br/>
Any help much appreciated,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861621895">Shinchogumi is not Shinsengumi. Shinchogumi was also derived from the <br/>
Roshitai, just like the Shinsengumi, but the Shinsengumi members <br/>
stayed in Kyoto while the Shinchogumi ones retreated back to Edo.<br/>
<br/>
I believe you have already got this book, but if not perhaps you can <br/>
give a look at "Samurai Sketches", by Romulus Hillsborough. It is a <br/>
bit novelized, but still a very interesting depiction (and very well <br/>
researched) of some Shinsengumi members, including Isami Kondo and <br/>
Kamo Serizawa.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helped...<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921060611">After the arrival of Commodore Perry, Japan was thrown into chaos <br/>
and fear. Many samurais, especially those of lower ranks, began to <br/>
doubt the power of the Shogunate in defending the country against <br/>
foreign powers, especially when they had seen the armed blackships. <br/>
The slogan "Sonno-Joi" (Rever the emperor, dispel the barbarians) <br/>
was winning more and more support, such that samurais desert their <br/>
hans to come to Kyoto to join the revolutionary movements. (In those <br/>
days deserting your han can be one of the most condemned sins - once <br/>
you desert, you can never return to it, on pain of death.) <br/>
<br/>
Such roshis (masterless samurais, but not ronins and definitely not <br/>
rurounis) increased in Kyoto, causing more and more disturbances at <br/>
the capital. In those early days of unsatisfied feelings, most of <br/>
the roshis still did not have a clear idea of what movement or who <br/>
they should follow. All they knew was that they were impatient and <br/>
eager to do something to defend Japan. There were myriads of schools <br/>
of thought - Sonno-joi, open up the country to learn from the gaijin <br/>
and in turn attact them using the same technologies, support the <br/>
Bakufu - as Watsuki once remarked, it was an era where 100 people <br/>
may hold 100 different arguments and you can't say who's wrong. It's <br/>
one factor which makes this era as tumultuous and interesting as it <br/>
is. The Bakufu decided that it would be to their advantage if they <br/>
took such roshis without any stand yet into their service, rather <br/>
than letting them roam about the capital. Hence, Roshi-tais (bands <br/>
of wave samurais) were formed and roshis enlisted under respective <br/>
Bakufu samurais, where the "entry requirements" were one's sword <br/>
skills (kenjutsu matches, something like an exam, were held.) This <br/>
happened in 1863 or 3rd Year of Bunkyuu, one year after Kaoru's <br/>
birth. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671074744">I thought that "rurouni" was a word Watsuki Nobuhiro "invented" for <br/>
his manga RUROUNI KENSHIN, yet apparently there's a slight difference <br/>
between it and "ronin" ("roshis", I assume, mean that this are <br/>
unemployed samurai by choice), and it may not have been "invented" at <br/>
all by him. What is that difference? I think that this info was taken <br/>
from a RK site, so maybe you don't know the answer, but in case <br/>
anyone knows, can you clarify?<br/>
<br/>
p.d. how many messages one (more or less) has to post to get out of <br/>
the moderated list? I understand the reasons behind it, but it's a <br/>
bit unnerving posting something and then having to wait a while to <br/>
see it on the boards. Just asking!<br/>
